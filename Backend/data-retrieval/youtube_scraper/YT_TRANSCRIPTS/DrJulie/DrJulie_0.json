    "transcript": "so I don't usually share personal things\non here but some time ago I found a lump\nin my breast and my first thought was I\ndon't have time for this I was six weeks\naway from handing in my new book and I\nconsidered for a moment waiting until I\nwas finished before calling the doctor\nbut a few weeks later I did have some\ntests and about a week before handing in\nmy book I got the news that I had early\nstage breast CID\nand the reason I'm sharing this with you\nis only because I read that one in five\ncancer patients wait more than three\nmonths before seeing a doctor about\ntheir symptoms and I can't stop thinking\nabout how many other people will be in\nthe same position that I was I made this\nvideo purely to share the message that\nif you notice something please don't\ndelay make it a\npriority because it could save your life"
