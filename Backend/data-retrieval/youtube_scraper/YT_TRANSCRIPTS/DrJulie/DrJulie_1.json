    "transcript": "here's four signs you might be\nself-sabotaging number one delaying or\navoiding the stuff that matters to you\nbecause you're choosing Comfort over the\nstress of responsibility and number two\nmaking promises to yourself with the\nbest of intentions and then repeatedly\nbreaking them number three refusing to\naccept help that's available to you even\nwhen you know you'd benefit from it and\nnumber four justifying it all to\nyourself by saying I never wanted those\nthings anyway even when you know deep\ndown that's not true"
