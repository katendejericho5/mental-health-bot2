    "transcript": "this is you and this is life\n[Music]\nbecause sometimes life does that right\nsometimes we get chips and cracks and\nother times we get completely shattered\nand all we want to do is go back to the\nway things were but it's impossible\nright all we can do is start doing the\nwork to rebuild now kimsugi is a\njapanese process of repairing broken\nobjects and turning them into something\neven more beautiful than the original\npiece so they repair not to hide the\ncracks but to highlight them with gold\nand celebrate their values so they\nbecome a part of the story and not the\nend of the story now the repair just\nlike healing takes a lot of work and\neffort but instead of throwing things\naway or pretending the worst never\nhappened we give those cracks meaning by\nusing them to enhance the thing as a\nwhole and celebrating the fact that they\nhelped you to become who you are today\nhit like and follow for more"
