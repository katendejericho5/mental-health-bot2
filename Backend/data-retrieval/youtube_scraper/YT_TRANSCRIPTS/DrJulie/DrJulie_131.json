    "transcript": "if you get anxious around other people\nI'm a psychologist and here are three\nthings you need to know number one when\nyou feel socially anxious you tend to\nhave an inward Focus that means you're\ntotally focused on how you're being\nperceived by other people so it helps to\nmake a conscious effort to shift your\nfocus to one of outward curiosity so\nquestions like what do I want to know\nabout other people in the room number\ntwo you're also prone to the spotlight\neffect which means you overestimate how\nmuch others are judging you in fact the\nresearch shows we get this wrong most of\nthe time in reality people are less\nconcerned with us than we think simply\nreminding yourself of that enables you\nto recognize the bias and take the power\nout of it and number three after a\nsocial interaction you probably spend\ntime worrying about what that person\nthought about you that's going to make\nyour anxiety worse so instead try\nrewarding yourself for every social\ninteraction whether it went well or not\nbecause every time you interact with\npeople you are tackling your anxiety\nhead-on"
