    "transcript": "you know how sometimes it feels like\nlife is doing this to you loads of\nthings happen all at once you get really\nshaken up and you think\none more thing and i'm gonna explode\nbut then\nnothing\nyou manage to hold it all in keep it all\ninside and from the outside no one would\nknow what you're dealing with\nbut just because it seems okay on the\nsurface it doesn't mean that what we've\nbeen through hasn't had an effect on us\nsometimes we get so good at hiding it\nthat we even fool ourselves into\nthinking that everything's okay but it's\nnot until something unexpected happens\nthat everything comes to the surface you\nfeel completely out of control don't\nwait until breaking points before you\nseek help and do something about it that\nway you don't have to be completely\noverwhelmed by everything all at once"
