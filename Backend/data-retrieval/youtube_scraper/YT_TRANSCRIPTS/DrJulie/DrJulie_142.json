    "transcript": "if you never feel good enough in your\nfamily and you're constantly trying to\nseek their approval then i want to show\nyou this box that has changed people's\nlives now imagine that you were given\nthis box from a very young age and you\nwere led to believe that there was\nsomething really special inside all you\nhad to do was find a way to get in so as\nyou grew up you tried so hard from every\nsingle angle to try and work out how to\nget in but nothing ever seemed to work\nwhat if i took that box after all this\ntime\nand opened it up for you and i showed\nyou\nthat there was nothing inside meaning\nthat no matter how hard you had tried\nthat special thing the approval you've\nbeen seeking was never available to you\nanyway\nrealizing that the box is empty feels\ndevastating after all that time spent\ntrying to get into it\nbut it's also liberating because your\nlife choices no longer need to be based\non what's inside there\nthey can now be based on what matters\nmost to you"
