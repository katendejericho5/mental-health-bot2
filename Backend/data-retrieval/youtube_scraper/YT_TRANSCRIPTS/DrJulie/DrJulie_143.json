    "transcript": "here's four reasons people stay in\nunhealthy friendships number one it\nstarted as a friendship of convenience\nand now you feel trapped so maybe it\ndeveloped because you see each other\nevery day at work or at school or maybe\nyou share lots of the same friends but\nthat then makes it hard to move away\nfrom that friendship even if it's\ndamaging for you number two feels easier\nto stay in a damaging friendship than it\nis to try and make yourself vulnerable\nby starting to make new ones and risking\nthe prospect of being alone number three\nthe person has been a friend for years\nand helped you through some tough times\nso now you feel like you owe them this\nfriendship even though it hurts you and\nnumber four nobody ever talks about the\nfact that friendships come and go in\nlife and so to consider that a\nfriendship may end is scary and unknown\nand full of grief and sadness"
