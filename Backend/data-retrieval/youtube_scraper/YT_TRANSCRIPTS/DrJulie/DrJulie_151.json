    "transcript": "you know something i've come to realize\nover the years of being a psychologist\nis how much people struggle with low\nmood and never tell us all\ntheir friends and family would never\nknow they mask it push it away\njust focus on meeting expectations\nsome people arrive at therapy after\nyears of doing that\nthey feel like they're getting something\nwrong they compare themselves to all the\npeople who appear to have it all\ntogether all of the time you know the\nones who are always smiling and always\napparently full of energy they buy into\nthis idea that some people are just like\nthat and happiness is some sort of\npersonality type you either have it or\nyou don't\nbut when we see low mood in that way as\nsome sort of fault in the brain\nthen we never see that there's any\nchance of changing it\nso instead we get to work trying to hide\nit so you go about your day doing\neverything you should and smiling at\neverybody you think you should\nand all the while just feeling really\nempty inside\n[Music]"
