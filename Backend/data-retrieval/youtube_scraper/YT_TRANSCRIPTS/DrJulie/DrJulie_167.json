    "transcript": "if you buy things online i'm a\npsychologist and you need to know this\ntake something like amazon they're\nalways the cheapest right they work\nreally hard to give you that impression\nby understanding the psychology of their\ncustomers\nlet me give you an example so\ntraditionally retailers charge more for\npopular products but when my book first\ncame out something weird happened as it\nbecame more popular you'd think the\nprice would go up but it actually went\ndown why well it's down to something\ncalled price perception they know that\nif they price the best selling and most\nsearchable products lower than the\ncompetition even if they're losing money\nyou'll assume that all their other\nproducts are the best price too\nand it's those less popular products\nwhere more profit is made so as my book\nis currently on the amazon bestseller\nlist that means it's also at its best\nprice yet\njust saying"
