    "transcript": "welcome to your 10-minute guided\nmeditation all you have to do is find a\nquiet spot where you can get into a\ncomfortable position either sitting up\nor laying down and please don't do this\nwhile you're driving because hopefully\nyou might find it a bit relaxing and at\nsome point I'll offer you to close your\neyes you don't have to do that if you\ndon't feel comfortable but just follow\nmy voice and enjoy\nso finding yourself in a comfortable\nposition I want you to take a couple of\nslightly deeper breaths and we're going\nto focus that spotlight of your\nattention on how it feels to breathe\nand then in one of those out breaths I\ncould just allow your eyes to close and\nreally draw their attention in to how it\nfeels to breathe\nand when your mind wanders from your\nbreath that's normal just notice where\nyour mind is gone and gently guide it\nback to refocus on the sensation\nbreathing\n[Music]\njust notice that natural rhythm of your\nbreathing\n[Music]\nnotice which parts of your body move to\nenable you to breathe\nand again when your mind wanders just\nnotice where it's gone gently guide it\nback to focus on the breath\nnotice that your body just does it for\nyou you don't need to try notice the\ntemperature of the air that you're\nbreathing\nand notice the difference in the\nsensations between breathing in and\nbreathing out and then we're going to\nexpand that spotlight of your attention\nto focus on\nthe rest of the body I just want you to\nnotice\ndifferent areas of your body\n[Music]\nhow it feels to be sitting or laying\ndown with you feel warm or cold\n[Music]\njust notice if there's any tension\nanywhere any pains and we're not trying\nto change any of those just noticing\nthem what they are in this moment\njust allow him to be there\nand keep returning to the breath\nand then I want you to notice what\nemotions you might have in the room with\nyou here now just notice what you feel\nand then if you have a name for that\nemotion I want you to notice where you\nsense that feeling in your body where\nyou feel it still breathing that might\nbe a feeling that\nis pleasant or it might be a feeling\nthat's unpleasant either way we're going\nto allow that feeling to be here for\nthis moment\nit's noticing\n[Music]\nnotice that it's an experience within\nyou it's not who you are\nit's a sensation but not the fabric of\nyour body and then I want you to place\none hand on the part of your body where\nyou feel that emotion and just allow\nthat palm to radiate that warmth\nloving-kindness\nto that emotional experience\nnow that wants of your palm\nto just represent your kindness to\nyourself\nif your mind wanders that's normal\nthat's okay just notice where your mind\nis gone and come back to the here and\nnow noticing that rhythm of your\nbreathing\nand the emotions in your body\n[Music]\nand then drawing the attention back from\nyour body and the emotion just your\nbreathing\nonce again again noticing that physical\nmovement happens every time you breathe\nallowing for that sensation of relief\nwith each out breath\nif your jaw is clenched together to\nallow that to open slightly\nand again if you mind wanders just\nnotice gently guide it back to the here\nand now\nand then I want you to become aware\nagain of how it feels to be sitting or\nlaying I notice which parts of your body\nare in contact with the chair or the bed\nwherever you are\nmaybe the feet on the floor just notice\nno sensation of your surroundings then\nexpand that awareness again to the\nsounds that you can hear around you and\ntaking some slightly deeper breaths one\nmore time\nwhen you're ready and one of those out\nbreaths if you've had your eyes closed\njust allow your eyes to open familiarize\nyourself with the room one more time\nnotice what you can see what you can\nhear and what you can touch\nand I hope you enjoyed this meditation a\nuseful exercise can sometimes be to just\nreflect on where your mind wandered to\nwhile you're trying to be present not\ntrying to change that just noticing as a\ngood learning experience and I hope you\nall enjoyed this let me know in the\ncomments how you found it and whether\nyou'd like me to do some more of these"
