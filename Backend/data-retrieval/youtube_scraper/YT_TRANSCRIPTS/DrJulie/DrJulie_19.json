    "transcript": "I'm Dr Julie and here are my top five\nsigns of high functioning depression\nnumber five you do everything the world\nasks of you so no one would ever know\nbut most days you feel empty inside\nnumber four you work hard but never\nreally feel energized or enthusiastic\nwhere you used to find pleasure now\nyou're just going through the motions\nnumber three you find yourself scrolling\non social watching hours of TV and\neating junk food to numb those feelings\nand number two social events can feel\nmore like hard work than fun because it\ntakes so much effort to keep up the\nappearance of being happy and number one\nthe high functioning ends when no one is\nlooking that's when the self-neglect\nbegins"
