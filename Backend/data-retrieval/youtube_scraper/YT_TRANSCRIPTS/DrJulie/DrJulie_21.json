    "transcript": "so what is high functioning depression\nnow depression doesn't start the day you\ncan't get out of bed in reality very few\npeople suddenly become debilitated by\ndepression mostly that builds up over\nyears of struggling to keep your head\nabove the water while meeting all of\nlife's expectations at the same time so\nyou can be deeply suffering with the\nsymptoms of depression even though\nyou're still getting by doing everything\nthat you're supposed to do that's why\nit's called high functioning depression\nand because outwardly everyone can see\nhow well you're coping with life so we\ncan be even harder to tell anyone\nbecause you feel this deep shame and you\ncan't imagine how anyone would even\nbelieve you so your suffering stays\nsilent but high functioning is not the\nsame as happy and healthy the term high\nfunctioning is not a clinical diagnosis\nbut depression is and the fact that you\ncan make it to work or school every day\ndoes not mean that your mental health\ncouldn't benefit from some work and some\nsupport"
