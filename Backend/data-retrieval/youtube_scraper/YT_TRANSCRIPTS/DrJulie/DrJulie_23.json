    "transcript": "you know when you feel low in mood or\nanxious and your thoughts just become\nall-consuming it's as if you can only\nsee the world through that lens and\nthere's no room for any other\nperspective your family seemed to be\nlooking through a completely different\nlens and your friends have their own way\nof seeing things that you just can't\nrelate to when you're feeling like this\nso inevitably you keep coming back to\nyour own perspective now a big mistake\nthat most people make is they think they\nhave to control or eliminate those\nthoughts you can't control the thoughts\nthat pop into your mind right the good\nnews is that you don't have to there's a\ntechnique taught in therapy called\nthought diffusion and it teaches you how\nto Simply get some distance from those\nthoughts and feelings and when you step\nback you get to see those thoughts for\nwhat they are which is just one possible\nperspective that means that instead of\nbeing controlled and driven by any one\nof those thoughts you get to choose how\nyou respond"
