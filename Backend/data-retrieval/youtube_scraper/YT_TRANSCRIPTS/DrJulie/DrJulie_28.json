    "transcript": "when it comes to relationships do you\never feel like you get hurt in the same\nways over and over again almost as if\nyou've been in the same relationship on\nrepeat with different people\nyou see we don't always seek out what's\nhealthy you know\nwe seek out what's familiar\neven when the familiar is damaging and\nwe try to heal Old Wounds by making sure\nthat this time this relationship ends\ndifferently\nbut instead of trying to give a\ndifferent ending to the same story we\nneed to break the cycle and write a\nwhole new one"
