    "transcript": "if you're constantly worried about how\nother people feel yet when somebody asks\nyou you always say I'm fine even when\nyou know you're definitely not fine\nit's possible that you grew up in a\nfamily where the adults didn't talk\nopenly about their problems but they let\nresentment build up and then come out in\nthese outbursts of Rage\nso what you learn as a child was it's\nnot safe to talk about things but you\nsure as hell better be attuned to when\nthose adults might be bubbling over\nand now you're an adult yourself that\nshows up in the I'm fine lies and a\ntotal disregard how you feel and the\nultra sensitivity to how everyone feels\naround you"
