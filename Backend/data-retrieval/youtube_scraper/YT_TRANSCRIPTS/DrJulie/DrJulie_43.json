    "transcript": "anxiety attack or a panic attack what is\nthe difference I see a lot of\nmisinformation about this across social\nmedia and if you're having a panic\nattack what's the quickest and most\neffective way to bring it back down\nagain I'm Dr Julie I'm a clinical\npsychologist and I'll talk you through\nit so let's start with that first\nquestion what's the difference between\nan anxiety attack and a panic attack now\nan anxiety attack is a term that's being\nused more and more online and on social\nmedia often to mean slightly different\nthings and the reason for that is\nbecause it's not a clinical disorder or\na diagnosis so it's not a term that's\nrecognized or used by professionals to\nmean anything in particular when there's\nno set agreed definition or criteria for\nsomething it's really important to be\naware of that because when you hear\npeople using the term unless they State\nwhat they mean by it different people\ncan use it to mean different things I\nsee people on social media listing\ncriteria for what it means to have an\nanxiety attack but that's not a criteria\nthat mental health professionals would\nrecognize I see it used a lot to\ndescribe a general buildup of anxiety\nyou like in the lead up to some sort of\nsocial event maybe your exam or an\ninterview and something I see people\nsaying on the internet that's just not\ntrue is that an anxiety attack has a\nspecific Trigger or a clear circumstance\nthat's directed towards and that panic\nattacks don't usually have a clear\nidentifiable trigger that's complete\nrubbish it's never that clear-cut there\nare plenty of people who experience high\nlevels of anxiety and have no idea why\nit's happening and in the same respect\nthere are lots of people who experience\npanic attacks that are highly\npredictable and specific to a situation\nthat they're fully aware of so again\nwhether you can pinpoint a specific\nTrigger or not does not determine\nwhether you're experiencing a panic\nattack or not so a panic attack is this\nabrupt surge of intense fear and\ndiscomfort that reaches a peak within\nminutes and then during that time you'll\nexperience a range of intense symptoms\nwe're looking for around four from the\nfollowing list so that might be\npalpitations that pounding heart feeling\nsweating trembling shaking sensations of\nsort of shortness of breath like you\ncan't catch a breath feelings of choking\nchest pain nausea abdominal distress\nfeeling dizzy or lightheaded or like you\nmight faint derealization which is\nfeelings of sort of unreality or\ndepersonalization so that feeling of\nbeing detached from yourself or fear of\nlosing control or going crazy or that\nfear of dying and numbness or tingling\nsensation you might get chills or heat\nSensations so hot flushes so while you\ncan be in a pretty high state of anxiety\na panic attack is where that anxiety\nreally Peaks to such an intensity and\nthe symptoms are so intense that you\nstart to think you might be dying or you\ncould be completely losing control so\nexperiencing a panic attack does not\nnecessarily mean that you have a panic\ndisorder panic attacks can be related to\nlots of other things like trauma\nreactions separation anxiety oh CD or\nspecific phobia but if you get more than\none panic attack it's really helpful to\ngo and talk to a doctor or a\npsychologist who can help you work out\nwhat's going on and what it's related to\nso if you experience panic attacks what\ncan you do about it I'm going to take\nyou through some of the top tips from\ntherapy now one of the most important\ntips when it comes to panic attacks is\nfirst understanding how anxiety can\nspiral into a panic attack so the\ntrigger for a panic attack could be\nsomething outside of you like an event\nor a specific situation maybe the\nsupermarket or a crowded place but it\ncould also be internal by that I mean it\ncould start with a physical sensation\nmaybe that feels like anxiety one\nexample might be you had a strong coffee\nat breakfast and later on that day your\nheart starts pounding in your chest if\nthat happens and you've struggled with\nanxiety before you might notice that\nthose palpitations and immediately think\noh no I'm getting anxious this is really\nbad I'm gonna lose control either way\nwhat you're perceiving is some sort of\nthreat whether that is and how you feel\nor something that's threatening around\nyou then what happens is you become\napprehensive about the build up of\nanxiety so you're becoming hyper\nVigilant to any other symptoms of\nanxiety and when you do that you start\nto notice them more which in turn makes\nyou feel even more anxious so as your\nthreat system is ramping up into action\nThe crucial part of all this is the next\npart this is when it can cause anxiety\nto spiral into Panic it's when you start\nto misinterpret one or two of those\nsymptoms as catastrophic that means you\nstart to fear either complete loss of\ncontrol total humiliation or even death\nso for example many people experience\nchest pain and naturally start to think\nI'm having a heart attack others feel a\ntightness in their throat and a dry\nmouth and that shortness of breath and\nthey start to think I'm going to\nsuffocate but whatever the fine details\nare if you're telling yourself that\nyou're about to face death or total\nhumiliation and your anxiety is going to\ntake off and you have yourself a panic\nattack so if you do have a panic attack\nwhat can you do about it well number one\nis remember that when you're having a\npanic attack your body's actually\nworking really well it's doing what it\nwas built to do so when your heart's\npounding and your throat is dry because\nof anxiety you are safe building up a\nreal awareness around what those signs\nare for you actually helps you to\nrecognize them as anxiety when they come\nup again in the future and if you can\nsee them as anxiety Then you can break\nthat cycle of misinterpreting those\nsymptoms that can then lead to panic\nattack number two is breathing so one of\nthe quickest ways to calm the mind is\nthrough the body if you can extend your\nout breath meaning that you breathe out\nfor slightly longer than you breathe in\nthen after a few minutes your brain is\ngoing to start telling your heart to\nslow down you could try doing something\nlike the 7-Eleven to get you started\nwhich is when you breathe in for counter\nseven and out for a count of 11. the\nspecific numbers don't matter so much do\nwhat feels most comfortable but you're\nreally looking to breathe out for longer\nthan you breathe in for and do it for a\nfew minutes so give it some time before\nit starts to work it won't work\nimmediately so take your time with it\nnumber three is to stop the odd panic\nattack from turning into something more\nregular you have to make sure that you\ndon't start avoiding the thing that\ntriggered it in the first place if that\nsituation is a safe one so for example\nif you went to the supermarket and you\nhad a panic attack it might feel like a\ngood decision to not go back there for\nas long as possible but avoidance feeds\nanxiety in the long term because you'll\nnever get the chance to be in that\nsupermarket and have it go well and then\nfeel better about it when you start to\navoid lots of things because of anxiety\nThen that anxiety grows and you find\nyourself stuck in a terrible situation\nwhere you can't leave the house or you\ncan't do all the things that give you a\nmeaningful life so don't avoid get\nsupport if you need to take it slowly\nbuild up to things really gradually but\ndon't let anxiety make parts of your\nlife out of bounds to you I took in\ndepth about anxiety in my book and I\ncover lots of tools from therapy in\nthere so check out the link in the\ndescription or the link in the bio if\nyou're
