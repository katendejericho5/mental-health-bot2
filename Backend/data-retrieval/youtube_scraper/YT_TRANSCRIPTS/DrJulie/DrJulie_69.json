    "transcript": "if you learned as a child that it was\nyour responsibility to prevent the\npeople in your life from feeling upset\nor disappointed then as an adult saying\nno to something in order to meet your\nown needs is going to bring up feelings\nof intense guilt and when we feel that\nguilt we assume that it must be because\nwe're doing something wrong when in fact\nthose feelings can be a reflection of\nthe past experience not what's best for\nus now"
