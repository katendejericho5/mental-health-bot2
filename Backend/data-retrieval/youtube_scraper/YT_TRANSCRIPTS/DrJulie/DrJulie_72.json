    "transcript": "when you need to set a boundary and say\nno but it feels uncomfortable to do that\nyou might notice that you go into\npeople-pleasing mode and you start to\nover-explain why you can't do something\nthis happens when you believe that your\nown health is not a good enough reason\nto disappoint other people\nbut all that over explaining yourself\nchips away at your self-confidence\nbecause it reconfirms your belief that\nother people need to buy into those\nreasons for them to be valid"
