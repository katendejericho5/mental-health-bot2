    "transcript": "did you know that if you fly a plane\nbetween london\nand new york but you tilt the plane just\nslightly so that it's a few degrees off\ncourse that tiny change over the course\nof the entire flight adds up so that by\nthe time you arrive you can land in a\ndifferent state or even a different\ncountry now think about the changes you\nwant to make in your life you don't have\nto make big grand gestures to see\npositive change you have to make one\nsmall promise to yourself every day that\nyou can keep over time those small\nactions add up to big change but we all\nknow that planes don't really fly in a\nstraight line right different conditions\ncan take it off course when the pilots\naware then they just make the necessary\nadjustments to get back on track and\nwhen you're working towards something\nyou don't have to progress perfectly you\nhave to notice when you're being pulled\nin a different direction and then shift\nback towards what you're aiming for and\nkeep going"
