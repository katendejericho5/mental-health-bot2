    "transcript": "i'm a psychologist and here's four signs\nyou're being manipulated number one they\nundermine you relentlessly or get you\nright where it hurts with a very\npersonal attack and then follow up with\nsomething like i'm just saying don't\noverreact not just once but repeatedly\nover time\nnumber two they do things for you maybe\neven things you didn't even ask for and\nthen use that as currency to get you to\ndo what they want you to do so every act\nof kindness seems to have strings\nattached number three they might dismiss\nyour problems and play up their own with\nthings like oh you think you've got it\nbad try being me\nnumber four playing the victim role they\nrefuse to take responsibility for\nthemselves and then ask you to do things\nfor them that you wouldn't normally say\nyes to if you thought they could do it\nfor themselves\n[Music]"
