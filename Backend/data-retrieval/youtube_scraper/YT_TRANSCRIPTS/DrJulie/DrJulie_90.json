    "transcript": "okay here's four things not to do when\nsomeone has depression number one don't\ngive them advice that they haven't asked\nfor even if you mean well it can be\nreally invalidating and they're less\nlikely to act on it than if you help\nthem find their own solutions to their\nproblems\nnumber two you don't need to have all\nthe right words don't underestimate the\npower of listening just let them know\nthat you're willing to hear what they\nwant to say and that you care about how\nthey feel\nnumber three don't take their withdrawal\npersonally it can be really hard to\ninitiate contact when you're depressed\nso except that for the time being you\nneed to be the person to call them\nnumber four it's okay not to be talking\nabout it all the time it's really hard\nto generate joyful experiences when\nyou're depressed so they might be\ngrateful for a bit of distraction from\nhow they're feeling right now it can be\njust as helpful as talking about painful\nstuff"
