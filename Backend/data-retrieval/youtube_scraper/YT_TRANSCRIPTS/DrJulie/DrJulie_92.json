    "transcript": "here's one of the biggest mistakes\npeople make when they're trying to make\npositive changes in their lives see we\nset ourselves up with these expectations\nthat when we're working on something\nevery new day should somehow be a little\nbit better than the last we constantly\nimprove until we reach some sort of peak\nwhere everything is fine the problem\nwith that is it's not how humans learn\nand progress\nthis is how it happens every single time\ngood days bad days\nimprovements\nand setbacks\nbut expecting it to be that smooth line\nis so damaging because when you\ninevitably hit those dips you tell\nyourself you're going backwards and\nyou're not making any progress and so\nyou're much more likely to give up on\nthe spot when actually what's needed is\nfor you to learn from that dip and get\nback on track knowing that whether it's\na good day or a bad day you're heading\nin the right direction"
