    "transcript": "here's three reasons you're\nprocrastinating and here's a hint it's\nnot because you're lazy number one you\nhave a strong drive for success but an\neven stronger fear of failure which is\npreventing you from even getting started\nnumber two you believe that your\nperformance says something about who you\nare as a person so putting it off\nbecomes a form of self-protection and\nnumber three you're avoiding the\nfeelings that come along with doing that\ntask like boredom anxiety or stress"
