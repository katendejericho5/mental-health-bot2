    "transcript": "so this is the first problem when it\ncomes to help-seeking especially if\nyou're a man which is that often times\nwe don't know how to communicate\neffectively we're incredibly vague with\nour language we ourselves don't realize\nwhat kind of help we need and so it puts\npeople in a very difficult situation\nwhere when you say I'm stressed and\noverwhelmed what is that person supposed\nto do they have no idea and what that\nsort of means is it's kind of really\ntricky because if they have no idea what\nto do you're not giving them a frame to\nhelp you it makes it difficult for them\nto help you and the harder you make it\nfor someone else to help you the less\nlikely you are to ask for help and if\nyou don't ask for help and they don't\nknow how to help then you end up saying\nthis is absolutely a mess it's never\ngoing to work nothing good comes of it\nanyway so I'm done and then we lead to a\nlife of loneliness isolation and\neventually getting crushed because life\nis a multiplayer Co-op game human beings\nhave evolved to help each other out and\nas a man if you don't know how to get\nhelp from other human beings you are\nplaying at a huge disadvantage"
