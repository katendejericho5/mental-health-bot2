    "transcript": "trust is not something you can do it's\nnot a friggin action it's a state of\nconfidence in another human being it's a\nstate of vulnerability so this is where\nwe see this kind of stuff when like\npeople end up in the friend zone we're\nfriends\nlet me get you flowers for valentine's\nday as a friend right and then the other\nperson is like wait are you sure this is\njust like a friend thing like this is\nkind of giving me weird vibes and then\nno no don't have weird vibes anything\nbut that don't cheat for me i'm in love\nwith you so since i'm in love with you\nand i see you retreating so absolutely\nas a friend it feels like long-term\nrelationships where you're doing all the\nwork is because first of all you are\ndoing all the work so i'm not\ndisagreeing with that i'm not saying\nit's all in your head so then like this\nperson's like asking like what do i do\nand the good news is there's a lot of\nstuff you can do\nso how do i stop being hyper independent\n24 m due to childhood trauma and abuse\ni've learned to depend on myself and by\ndepend on myself i mean wanting to do\neverything and anything on my own for\nmyself and those around me\ni never want to ask for help and when i\ndo i feel some sort of shame\nobviously this is unhealthy as excessive\nindependence can lead to many problems\nwhich include loneliness\nburnout loss of trust and love in others\nfeeling tired all the time not being\nable to feel vulnerable around others\netc\ni've always suspected that there's\nsomething wrong with the way i think of\ncertain things when it comes down to\nindependence but now that i'm aware of\nthis trauma response and i'm able to put\na name on it what should my next steps\nbe\ni understand that the gist of the advice\nis just going to be just trust people\nand watch how not scary it is but\nobviously that's easier said than done i\nwant to pause here for a second and\noffer some thoughts so the first thing\nis like i really want to commend this\nperson for coming this far\nright so this is like something that i'm\nreally proud about this community at\nlike\npeople are recognizing what's going on\nin them\nthey may not be able to fix it yet but\nthis is like\nour community is like leveling up and\nthis post is a prime example of that\nwhere they've recognized okay i'm hyper\nindependent it's leading to these things\nso what we used to see a year ago or\neven still today depending on how long\npeople have been in this community is\ni'm lonely i'm burnt out it's impossible\nfor me to trust\nhow do i fix my loneliness whereas now\npeople are sort of starting to realize\nokay this is because i've learned to\ndepend on myself this is a consequence\nof my upbringing it's an adaptation but\nhow do i unadapt\nright and then this is also where we're\nseeing something that's really\ninteresting which is that\na lot of people will give simple answers\ni can't trust anyone just learn how to\ntrust\nright that's what the internet will say\nlike you got to learn how to trust\ntrust it's\neasier than that don't worry\nhow do i even trust people in the first\nplace when do i know when i need help\nhow do i depend on others how do i deal\nwith others when they let me down how do\ni provide help without any strings\nattached\ni sometimes have expectations for others\nto have my back like i did\nbut i often feel disappointed i feel\nlike there are dozens of other questions\nto ask\nbut i can't think of them right now\ntotally fine because these are all\nsufficient and enough and hard enough\nquestions right these are fantastic\nquestions\nso hard to answer though\nin my head i don't ever need help pain\ngoes away things get learned on my own\nand i can just power through but i can't\ntell when i should power through\nsomething or just ask for help instead\ni can learn stuff by googling i can\nexperience stuff by researching and\ndoing it myself i can have fun on my own\netc although that gets lonely and\nextremely tiring\nthis especially gets bad in long-term\nrelationships i just feel like i'm doing\nall the work as i don't accept much help\ni don't know how to even accept help at\nthis point and i kind of forget forgot\nhow it feels to fully trust someone and\nhave them help me at a satisfactory\nlevel without any feelings of shame or\nweakness linked to it\ni've improved over the years as i've\ni've improved over the years as i've\nbeen recognizing my limits good job\nand how others have their own\nexperiences and unique outlooks also\ngood job on situations that would teach\nme better than a simple google search\nfunny thing is that the google search\nmight lead to a forum which is filled\nwith people's opinions and thoughts but\ni want to improve a lot more i don't\nwant to be hyper independent anymore i\njust want to trust people i want to be\nable to let my next girlfriend through\nthat big door i've locked for years\nfantastic post\nso let's understand this a little bit\nokay\nwhat's going on here\nso sometimes we don't really have too\nmany details about it\nbut i think that's okay we don't need\ntoo many details about it the person\nsort of says\ndue to childhood trauma and abuse i've\nlearned to depend on myself\nokay\nso sometimes we grow up in situations\nwhere we lose trust in other people\nand the reason we lose trust in other\npeople is because we used to have trust\nin other people and then our brain\nlearned that trusting other people is\nnot a good idea\nright so like when you grow up in an\nabusive\nchildhood or not even like overtly\nabusive\nyour trust can be let down in subtle\nsubtle ways even by quote-unquote loving\nor picture-perfect parents\nright this is the kind of thing where i\nmean there's all kinds of stuff like\nwhere you can have parents who are very\nsuccessful and want you to be the best\nbut when you share with them that you\nactually don't want to go to medical\nschool and you want to become an artist\nthey look at you and they sign\nsign they shake their heads and they're\nlike ah i'm so disappointed i don't\nunderstand you're ruining your life all\nthis kind of stuff like they're like\neven stuff that this like i say this\nbecause i love you you just have no idea\ni have more experience than you do and\nlike even like good parents can do this\nokay\nso then like\nyou're smart right so you figured out i\ndon't know how to trust people i don't\nknow how to accept help\nand then what happens is\nin my head i don't ever need help the\npain goes away right so like in those\ntimes where i don't ask for help\nit hurts\nit's extremely tiring\nburn out\nright because you're doing it all on\nyour own\nso that leads to burnout and stuff but\neventually the pain goes away like\ni'm resilient i'm a survivor\ni've thrived i've grown i've become self\nreflective i've improved over the years\nright\ni'm gonna learn things on my own and i\ncan power through i can because here's\nthe thing i've learned that if i depend\non other people\ni often feel disappointed but if i\ndepend on myself\nand i'm hyper independent\ni never have to feel the shame\nor weakness\nof receiving someone's help\ni never have to open myself up to the\ndisappointment and betrayal of trusting\nsomeone\nso i've got two options in life\ni can either be completely independent\nhyper-independent i love the phrase\nnot rely on a damn soul because here's\nthe thing i can do it\nbut it sucks\nthat's the problem right it sucks i hate\nbeing lonely\ni survive i even thrive and i grow and i\nimprove\nbut it sucks\nand that's absolutely true right like\nit's not about capability\nit's about loneliness it's about freedom\nit's about not being exhausted all the\ntime\nand so then the question is like what do\ni do about it well i need to learn how\nto trust this is a smart person\nright so even you yourself say i need to\nstop being so hyper independent i need\nto learn how to trust if i can trust if\ni can accept help i need to learn how to\naccept help\nright and the internet will say the same\nthing they'll say just\njust trust people and watch how not\nscared it is like i know it's going to\nbe scary but learn how to trust man have\nfaith in humanity and humanity will\naccept you\nright like and then you learn to trust\nlike you have to put yourself out there\nput yourself out there that's the only\nway\nyou have to open yourself up to the pain\nand i'm sure i've said that too\nso here's the first thing to understand\nwhen we recognize that we need to attain\na goal\nthe goal is not the action\nokay so this person is saying like i\nfigured this out now what what do i do\nso here's the thing that i just want to\nexplain very simply okay this is like\nkind of a yogic perspective but like i\nthink it's true\nbut we just don't think about this in\nwestern psychology quite as much\ntrust is not something you can do\nyou all get that\nso people say just trust\nput yourself out there give give love a\nchance\ngive it a chance\nlet people love you\ntrust is not something you can do it's\nnot a freaking action\nlike you can't trust people\nlike\nyou can say hi to people you can\nyou know ask someone to pick you up from\nthe airport\nbut like trust is not a verb\nlike i mean it sort of is i trust you it\nis a verb\nbut it's not an action let's put it that\nway\nright like it it's it's a state of\nconfidence in another human being it's a\nstate of vulnerability\nit is superb\nbut it's not something you can do like\nit's not like oh yeah i i met these\nthree great people at at you know at the\ngrocery store\nand i trusted them for three hours\nlike we i i man\ndude i had the best trust i had the best\nyou know i\ni'm so good like he's a professional\ntruster like that it's not that's not\nit's not something you can do\nright it's kind of weird\nand this is why when people say just\ntrust it's like\nhow\nbecause it's not something you can do\nokay\nand we kind of struggle with that right\nso then like this person's like asking\nlike what do i do and the good news is\nthere's a lot of stuff you can do so\nthis is where oftentimes when we're\nmissing something in our life and we\nlook at that as a goal like oh like i\nneed to learn how to trust\nand it's like way over there what we're\nlooking at is over there\nbut we're not like looking like over\nhere this is where we need to look we\nneed to look at the first step not the\nlast step\nbecause trust is like an emergent\nproperty\nit's like flight like trust is the\ndistillation of all kinds of other stuff\nhappening you'll get that\nyou don't just do it\nit's not like i'm going to do 100 reps\nof trust\ntoday\nlike that's not how it works trust is a\nconsequence\nof a lot of other things happening and\nso when you're stuck in the situation of\nbeing hyper independent the question\nit's a damn good question is like what's\nthis down here like what's the first\nstep\nand the answer in short is communicate\nthat's what you can do\nright so let's understand what's going\non with this person i engage in a\nrelationship with someone\nthere's a lot of tricky stuff going on\nhere\nokay so we're going to try to tunnel\ndown into this i'm going to try to show\nthis to you\nhow can i provide help without strings\nattached\nso when this person engages in a\nrelationship\nthey help the other person\nthe post isn't i can't help other human\nbeings i'm a selfish [ __ ]\nposters i can't accept help but they do\nhelp others\nokay\nso\nwhen you help someone you create an\nexpectation\nand when you create an expectation\nother people disappoint you\nright so i helped you\ni want so there's an expectation like i\npicked you up from the airport\nyou should pick me up from the airport\nand then they say hey can i give you a\nride and then you say no\nbecause i don't know how to accept help\nand then they don't pick you up with the\nairport\nnext week you drop them off again they\nask hey can i pick you up from the\nairport you say no\nand then you feel disappointed\nthen you feel this is especially bad for\nlong-term relationships because i just\nfeel like i'm doing all the work you're\ndamn right you're doing all the work\nthat's the reason you feel that way but\nwhy are you doing all the work it's\nbecause you won't let them do the other\nhalf of the work\nthis is tricky we'll get to this okay\nso then what happens is we create this\nexpectation in our mind\nand then the other problem is we don't\ncommunicate that expectation\nand then what happens is like i don't\nknow if this makes sense but\nunless you communicate your expectations\nto other human beings it's really not\nfair\nto hold them responsible for not living\nup to them\nright like it's really easy for others\nto disappoint your expectations when you\ndon't tell them what your expectations\nare\nlike\nand that's where a lot of relationships\ni know it sounds super basic but that's\nnot actually how we operate right\nlike we don't actually tell people hey\nthis is what i'm expecting from you\nwe're not transparent with it\nso someone's saying covert contracts\nabsolutely\nso this is where we see this kind of\nstuff when like people end up in the\nfriend zone we're friends\nlet me get you flowers for valentine's\nday as a friend\nright and then the other person is like\nwait are you sure this is just like a\nfriend thing like this is kind of giving\nme weird vibes and then no no no don't\nhave weird vibes anything but that don't\nretreat from me i'm in love with you\nso since i'm in love with you and i see\nyou retreating\nno no no it absolutely is a friend\nand then we become resentful\nbecause we don't tell them what we\nexpect\nand then how are we expecting someone\nelse to know\nwhat we expect\nare they supposed to be telepathic\nit gets twice as bad if you can't accept\nhelp because i'm guessing that part of\nthe reason that it feels like long-term\nrelationships where you're doing all the\nwork is because first of all you are\ndoing all the work so i'm not\ndisagreeing with that i'm not saying\nit's all in your head\nbut the question is what does how does\nyour behavior and your communication\ninfluence you doing all the work\nright so i have a family member who's a\nwonderful person\nand they get any time they see me like\ndoing work\nthey try to do that work\nso i don't know if you guys have family\nmembers like this where it's like if\nyou're visiting their house and you\nstart\ntaking dishes out of the dishwasher\nthey're like no no you sit down let me\ndo that\nand then it's like oh okay so you stop\ndoing it they're taking out the\ndishwasher you start taking out the chat\nno no no i can take care of the trash\nyou don't need to bother\nand they're like they always want to do\nthe work that you're doing\nand it's like\nand then if you let them they feel like\nthey're doing all the work and then they\nget burnt out because you're not doing\nanything\nright classic mom tactic absolutely\nright\nand so then like they're signing\nthemselves up like it's not wrong that\nthey're doing all the work it's also not\nwrong where they're coming from they're\nnot like a mean person who's an idiot\nthey care about you they don't want you\nto do the work but then they're gonna\nend up doing all the work\nso if you can't accept help your\nrelationships are going to be one-sided\nand then you get mad at your partner\nbecause your relationships coincide\nand oddly enough i don't blame you for\nit but it's like it's a problem of your\nown creation\nand that's what's really tricky right is\nbecause if if we say like it's your it's\na problem of your own creation does that\nmean i'm blaming you it's like sort of\nbut there's also power there\nbecause if you have the power\nto fix it you also have the power to\nbreak it like the power is just the\npower\nit's shakti energy\nand so like this is what's kind of wild\nis like then you feel ashamed and stuff\nlike that no it's just like you just\nhaven't learned yet right it's not your\nfault but you absolutely have the power\nto fix this\nbut if you have the power to fix it you\nalso like have to accept responsibility\nfor your actions creating the situation\nso what do you do at the end of the day\nthe answer is communicate\nso you need to speak\ni'm not saying if you can't accept help\ndon't accept help if you can't trust\ndon't force yourself to trust\nbecause that's going to end up with\nproblems too i need to learn how to\ntrust i need to learn how to trust i\nneed to learn to trust hey person who\ni've never met before come into my house\nand you can stay as long as you want to\nand by the way this is where i keep all\nmy petty cash and here's where my wallet\nis oh my god\ni've been taken advantage of you don't\nwant to just blindly start going out\nthere and practicing trust i mean i\nguess you can be interesting but that's\nnot what i would advocate\nwhat you need to do is actually\ncommunicate\nright so this is where like\nwhen you're in a long-term relationship\nand someone tries to help you and you\ndon't want to accept that help\nacknowledge it to them and say hey\ni really\nappreciate you wanting to help but i\nreally feel like i can handle this on my\nown and like\nit makes me feel\nkind of weird if you help me with this\nif you want to you can even say it makes\nme feel a little bit ashamed of myself\nand then your partner may be a little\nbit confused by that like not sure what\nto do they may say you don't need to\nfeel shame oh baby you don't need to\nfeel ashamed oh that's okay\ni'm your significant other like i can i\ncan like take care of it for you like\nyou don't have to feel ashamed when you\nknow\nyou can't change a tire and you're a big\nmanly man\nand i'm not a manly man and i can change\nthe tire like you don't have to feel\nashamed\nwhen i'm bigger than you and stronger\nthan you and can drink you under the\ntable you don't have to feel ashamed\nright\nand so\njust communicate share with your partner\nthat hey\ni recognize that\nyou're offering to help me but it's\nreally hard for me to accept help you\ncan even just say that\nand then like at least you are\nbeing authentic in that moment it's\ngonna help deal with the resentment\nright and then ideally what you can do\nis get to a conversation where you and\nyour partner sit down and then this is a\nrelationship problem the two of you are\ngoing to solve together\nso if it's hard for you to accept help\ni'm really confused about how to help\nyou and this is where you also want to\nvocalize the other side where i feel\nlike i'm doing all the\nthe work in the relationship and then\nyour partner is going to get\nunderstandably pissed at you and they're\nlike yeah you are doing all the work in\nthe relationship because you never\naccept my help and then they're going to\nget pissed at you and that's going to\nfeel bad for a little while and then\ny'all are hopefully going to talk to\nthrough it and you all are going to sit\ndown and you're going to acknowledge\nthat\ni'm resentful for you for a situation in\nwhich i am creating\nand not letting you fix\nand i'm blaming you for\nnot fixing an impossible situation\nyou need to acknowledge that to your\npartner and then your partner is going\nto be like then what the hell do we do\nabout it you need to shut the [ __ ] up\nand accept my help and then you're going\nto be like okay because now they're\npissed and then they help you\nand then it's gonna feel good\nit's weird\nright because they're not gonna let you\nnot accept their help anymore which is\nexactly what you want them to do\nyou want them to swat aside i can do it\nmyself\nyou want them to swat it aside you want\nthem to plow right through that and i\ndon't care what you think i'm going to\nhelp you because i love you\nand you deserve it and despite all of\nyour feeble protests no no no don't kiss\nme don't kiss me please\nright\nyou want to be swept off your feet\nand you want them to help you despite\nall of your protests because that shows\nthat they care\nand then you can trust them\nright\nit's kind of weird and if we want to get\nsuper like\nanalytical about it\nthis is where like probably that's what\nthe trauma was that despite\nyou know like there was this weird\nimpossible situation where you felt like\nyou were\nstuck between a rock and a hard place\nand someone maybe created that rock in a\nhard place and they didn't smash through\nbarriers to come and save you and so now\nwhat you want from a relationship is to\nfix that problem from the past we have\nno idea if that's actually the case if\nthat resonates with you and you're\nlistening to it great\nif it's an epiphany fantastic chances\nare it's completely off base\nbut generally speaking there is this\nthing called the repetition compulsion\nwhere we create in our current\nrelationships problems that we try to\nsolve uh problems that were not solved\nproperly from past relationships\nokay so if you're hyper independent the\nanswer is communicate more than anything\nelse right if you're asking what do i do\nbecause you can't just start trusting\nyou can't just like accept people's help\nyou can try a little bit for sure that's\nalso where like from in terms of\naccepting people's help you can also try\nlike accepting small amounts of help for\ninsignificant things\nor even asking\nfor it which is another like interesting\ntechnique so i would sometimes it's\neasier to ask for things that don't\nmatter as much to you in terms of\nreducing the shame and or weakness\nso you can even start by like asking\nsomeone that you care about to like grab\nsomething from you from a different room\nif you're sitting down\nor like you know\ncan you grab me this while you're up\nand just let them do something small for\nyou that doesn't evoke a whole lot of\nshame or weakness you can actually\npractice that a little bit but i think\nat the end of the day it's communicating\nthat hey it's hard for me to accept your\nhelp and letting your partner know that\nso at least they're aware\nthat this is going on because right now\nwhat's going on is you have this whole\ninternal cascade\nin your mind about this relationship\nall this stuff that you're doing for\nthem and they're not doing for you and\nthen you feel alone you can't talk about\nit and you're setting these expectations\nyou're attaching all the strings\nto all the things that you do for your\npartner\nand you're not letting them help you and\nthere's just this mountain of stuff\nthat's growing in your mind\nand then you feel let down and\ndisappointed because they can't keep up\nwith that crap\nright\nbecause they're not psychic\nand then you feel frustrated with them\nyou feel frustrated with yourself you\nrecognize that oh if i could trust this\nwouldn't be a problem if i was better\nthis wouldn't be a problem you beat\nyourself up you feel stuck you don't\nknow what to do then you're burnt out\nthen you're alone\nand then it's like\nyou throw your hands up i don't know\nwhat to do\nit's just so much easier to\ndo this\nwhy bother with all that crap\nit's going to suck for a while but the\npain will go away i'll learn on my own i\ncan just power through\nright\nand of course like that's not stupid for\nyou to think that way like obviously\nlike think about what i'm describing\nit's a mess why don't you just do it\nyourself\nright easier\ncommunicate is the answer\ncommunicate that you can't accept help\ncommunicate that\nwhen you help them and you\nyou don't let them help you that you\nfeel resentful communicate that you\nacknowledge that that puts them in a\nhard position an impossible position\nand that you're working on it\nright and that you need their help if\nthey can can you help me figure this out\nand maybe that's going to be weird to\nask but oddly enough i think that you\ncan ask for their help there i think\nyou're going to feel less shame when you\nown it and when you're authentic it's\ngoing to be there\nso just talk talk\ntalk about what your expectations are\nlet people know what they can do to make\nyou happy or disappoint you in a\nrelationship\nwhereas like half of what i see like on\nthese horror stories from online dating\nis like people are jumping through hoops\nand like playing games that like they're\nnot even aware of what the rules are\nlike i'll see this crap where it's like\noh you want to meet up sometime like\nwhere would you like to go\nthat's pathetic\nyou don't ask me where i want to go you\npick a place and you take me there\nand then you're like\nmy bad and you're like\ni need someone who's more assertive and\ncan be like\nyou know is confident in themselves and\nnot\nsomeone who's waffling around and can't\ndecide where to go unmatched\nand then you're like\nand then you match someone else and\nyou're like\nhey i'd like to take you to this place\non tuesday and you're like and then what\nyou guys\nhow dare you\ni'm an independent human being who has\nmy thoughts and feelings and you have\nthe presumption\nto\ntake me somewhere without even asking me\nwhat my preferences are like what stuff\nunmatched and it's like we're playing\nall these games well like we don't know\nthe rules and like different people have\ndifferent rules\nright\nand for those of y'all saying women this\nisn't women this is also like there's a\nfemale side of this that's equally\nfrustrating\nhi how are you good how are you oh what\nare you into i'm into anime oh cool i'm\ninto anime too here's my dick pic\nwhat\nand then you\ngo up to the next you talk to the next\nperson and like\nit's like equally confusing it's like\nhey [ __ ]\nhere's my dick pic\nthere's no hey how are you\nright it's y'all making it about women\nit's not about women\nthis is just like what's happening to\npeople\nright\nand then there's even like the i matched\nwith a person\nhere's my dick pic like no hello\nright where it's like\nit happens too where like like you know\nwomen are confusing because men are also\nlike they don't they don't tell you what\nthey're like oh yeah like i'm totally\nfine for any kind of relationship i'm\nopen i'm looking to meet anyone you know\ni'm supportive i'm an emotionally\navailable man\ni'm really great that way\ni think like you know i think all women\nare to be treasured\nand i respect women and i love women and\ni'm treasuring you and i'm loving you\nwhich is why i don't want you to go out\nor talk to any other men\nbecause you need to be treasured and\npreserved and cared for and i'm going to\nput you on a pedestal\nand i'm going to place really\nunrealistic expectations\nbased on the scarring that my mother did\nto me about what love is and i'm going\nto put all those expectations on you and\ni'm going to expect you to navigate them\nwithout ever telling you about them\nand therefore what i'm going to do is\nsince i don't know how to communicate\ni'm going to hold you to standards and\nwhen you don't meet those standards i'm\ngoing to get passive and aggressive\nbecause i talk about being emotionally\nsupportive and emotionally available but\nactually\nthat's just bs\nand i don't actually ever admit my\nfaults\nand i blame them on you\nbecause that's what my mother did to me\nright like there's\ny'all may want to gender it\nwhich is fair right because i sort of\ndid things that i guess people associate\nwith women but there's absolutely\nanother side of the story\nit's not gender related\nthere's all kinds of like random crap\nright and it's like\nand i i think based on the women that\ni've talked to the frustration is just\nthe re it's like rng like dick pic rng\nlike every text message could be a dick\npic\nopen loot box is it gonna be a regular\ntext message or is it a oh i'm a super\nnice guy i respect women hey answer me\nback hey answer me back hey why aren't\nyou texting me hey\nexpletive expletive other words that'll\nget me banned on twitch\nor youtube\nhey hey give me a chance like why don't\nyou give me a chance\nlike\nyou know i'm a good communicator\nhey hey hey communicate communicate\ncommunicate you're a bad communicator\nbecause you don't understand what my\nemotional needs are and i'm placing all\nof my emotional needs on this match\nwhich happened four hours ago and now\nit's two in the morning\nand i don't really acknowledge that you\nhave a job that you have to wake up for\nand that you could be asleep but if my\nemotional needs aren't being met i blame\nyou for that because i i don't care\nabout the fact that you have a life and\nyou have other things going on i have\nemotional needs and you don't seem to\nunderstand that\ntherefore you are a b word or a c word\nor whatever kind of word s word\nthey're all the words that get tossed\nout right\nso it's like people are playing games\nthey're\nthey're measuring you against standards\nthat you have no idea what they are\nand so you're gonna disappoint them\nso this is where like communicate what\nyour standards are communicate what your\nexpectations are and that's also where\nlike i guess now we're talking about\ndating advice but\nalso like not all at once and right up\nfront right i need you to be this i need\nyou to be this i need you to be this i\nneed you to be this\nyou know i need you to be six feet tall\nsix inches six figures versus i need you\nto cook i need you to clean i need you\nto respect i need you know sexual\ngratification whatever i ask for like\nunrealistic expectations bombarding\npeople on the internet with them is not\ngender specific it happens to both\npeople\nit's like or not just both genders\nthere's more than two whatever\nhappens it's human\nto stop doing that right so start to\ncommunicate your expectations recognize\nthat your expectations is not a job\napplication where like people are\nchecking off boxes so that they have the\nprivilege of being your mate\ni saw a post recently i don't know if\nthis was on the hg subreddit but someone\nwas talking about they feel like you\nknow women in their 30s have unrealistic\nexpectations that's not entirely fair\nit's sort of true but not entirely fair\nbecause generally what's what happens is\nif you have very stringent expectations\nthat you're not willing to compromise on\nyou're more likely to be alone\nso as you get older there's all kinds of\nexceptions to this rule right so i don't\neven know that it's a rule it may be the\nminority of people that apply to this\nbut if you're someone who\nis not willing to compromise on your\nexpectations it's going to be harder for\nyou to find a relationship and then i\nwould assume that generally speaking\nover time maybe the older people get\nthe more likely you are to find people\nwho have very stringent expectations\nyou"
