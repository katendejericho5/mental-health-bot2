    "transcript": "gonna do about it what most people think\nabout the doing is like changing the\noutside right so if i if i feel lonely\nwhat am i gonna do about it like i'm\ngonna go get in shape and i'm gonna make\nmore money and then i'm gonna like you\nknow take all these classes so i know\nhow to make small talk and then like i'm\ngonna become like this awesome external\nhuman being i'm gonna fix all the\nproblems on the outside so i can connect\nwith other people\nthe weird thing is that in a weird way\nlike that's not an option for you right\nlike you can't fix fundamentally like\nthe body that you've been given\nand so in a weird way i think that\nyou've actually gone like internally and\nso we hear a lot about these journeys\nwhere you kind of talk about you know\nbeing really upset with yourself like\nlearning to accept yourself and then\nsort of saying there is no answer there\nis no reason but i'm tired of being\nlonely\nand i'm tired of like being upset with\nmyself and something has to change\nwelcome iron mouse no\nyou're do you have a tail\ni do i have a tail and i have wings i\ncan make them go away\noh oh that's cool\nbut whatever whatever makes you feel\ncomfortable\nand\nokay\nso um\nso let's\nstart by what do you want to what would\nyou like me to call you today what do\nyou go by\nwell you can call me mouse okay\nyeah\nand thank you very much for speaking\nwith us today mouse oh thank you thank\nyou for having me i'm i am honored to be\nhere well we're honored by your presence\nno just it's just it's just me i'm\nnothing special\nwell i i think\nthe internet would disagree\nokay\num thank you\nso tell me a little bit is there\nsomething in particular that you want to\ntalk about today or anything that we can\nhelp you with oh my god i don't i don't\neven know cool that's\nthat's totally fine because i have so\nmany questions\nreal yeah\nokay so can you tell me a little bit\nabout um how you decided to become a v\ntuber\nuh well\num\ni have uh i think the main reason why i\ndecided to become a youtuber\nwas well i decided that i wanted to\nstream uh because i was really lonely\nand i wanted to make friends\nand uh i\ndid not feel comfortable uh being on\ncamera uh because i have a\ni have a lot of health problems uh so\nuh i was very apprehensive about uh\nbeing a\nflesh tuber as i call it\nuh i i i just i did not feel comfortable\nuh i have a bit of a of a long history\nwith not feeling comfortable with myself\nuh so\na friend of mine a friend of mine\nactually\nsuggested to me\nthat they were like oh there's this\nprogram that you can use and you can be\nlike a character you can be an enemy\ngirl and at the time i saw there was a\nanother youtuber her name was kizunai\nand she was like a really big thing and\ni was like wow if i could do that i\nwould love to do that but i just figured\nit would be like it would cost a lot of\nmoney but a friend of mine got me a\nprogram and\ni was like okay well maybe i'll try to\nstart the streaming thing as an anime\ncharacter and uh\ni did and it was a lot of fun uh at\nfirst i\ni i don't know i just did it because i\nwanted to make friends and i was just\nlike really nervous to be on camera and\nuh\nit uh here we are now\nyeah so so tell me what was your\nexperience help us understand how we got\nto where we are now and what where now\nis so what was it like when you first\nstarted out\nwell well you know i when i first\nstarted streaming i did it because i\nwanted to make friends and uh\ni was very lonely uh because of my\nhealth issues uh\ni never used to talk about my health\nissues before uh i was always very\nnervous because i kind of like to me i\nwanted to be seen like a normal\nuh\na normal person so\ni would never talk about it and i just\nreally wanted to be friends and and\nand talk to different people and i\ndidn't really think i was particularly\ninteresting uh\nbut uh i kept on streaming and i started\noff very small and it wasn't until the\npandemic happened but uh things started\nuh\ngetting\nthings started picking up and uh\ni started growing a bit more and\nnow i am\ni have a wonderful community that\nsupports me\na lot and i feel\ni've never felt more myself than i have\nin my whole entire life as\niron mouse\nyeah that's so interesting can so can\nyou tell me a little bit about what the\npandemic was like you mentioned that\nthings started to change a little bit\nduring the pandemic\nuh well uh\ni guess because\num i've always had to be kind of\nisolated uh because of my condition but\nuh it\nbecause of the pandemic i had to be even\nmore isolated than usual and\nmy family had to stay home\nand i guess\nuh i i don't know it was just like a\nshift because there were so many more\npeople online and\ni think at the time that's when like\nyoutubers started like really picking up\nand uh i started getting a lot more uh\npeople watching me and it was it's been\na really interesting uh turning point in\nmy life\nuh because i uh finally was able to\nstart you know making money streaming\nwhich i never used to do\nand uh i was able to afford uh\nbetter medical care for myself and i've\nslowly been improving in my health\nbecause of that and it's thanks to my\ncommunity so i'm just very grateful and\nuh\nyou know uh\ni don't know it's a lot of stuff a lot\nof stuff has happened and it's kind of\nlike it kind of like happens so fast and\nit just feels like cool\nyeah\noh this is so\nthat's so interesting so i assume that\nyou just moved and then the v tuber\nmoves with you\nyeah\nit tracks my movement like\nokay exactly\nwow does it track your facial\nexpressions yes\nso\nif you're smiling right now can you make\na sad face i'm curious what that\noh interesting okay thank you so much\nfor demonstrating that so uh mouse\nthere's\na lot of different\nthings that i'm curious about and i i'm\ni'm wondering if like um\nwe could\nyou know which of these you'd feel\ncomfortable with or which ones sound\ninteresting to you\nthere's a lot from your story that i\nthink we could learn a lot about so a\nlot of times people try to figure out\nwho they are\nso people will sort of say like you know\nhow do i determine like is this my true\nself or is this like me being\nconditioned how do i know what i want\nversus like\nwhat society wants so there's a lot of\nstuff about identity\nand who we are and and so it's so\ninteresting to hear you say that\nyou feel more like yourself than you've\never felt before\nand so i think that we sort of have at\nour disposal\nalmost like an entirely new way\nof\nunderstanding or experiencing identity\nand whether\nwhat we can sort of learn from\nyour experience of your identity could\nlike\nwe could learn something that could\nbenefit everyone\num yeah\nso that's like one thing you know you\nmentioned early that you were really\nlonely and kind of nervous and you\nwanted to make friends and stuff\nand so i was a little bit curious about\nthat and what your experience of\nstreaming what like that was like you've\nalso mentioned your health problems and\nand i just wanted to clarify whether\nyou're comfortable talking a little bit\nabout that in more detail i know it's\nmore medical information but\num\nand so those are kind of the three\nthings that i'm sort of curious about\nyeah i don't mind uh touching upon that\na little bit you know it's uh i do get a\nlittle nervous talking about things but\ni think i'll be okay\nsure so so and because you also\nmentioned earlier that you used to be\nnervous talking about your health\nbecause\nyou wanted to feel normal and so i'm\nalso a little bit curious about what\nabout your health makes made it hard for\nyou to feel normal earlier\nuh well uh i was born with a genetic\ndisease called cvid\nuh it's a uh\nprimary immune deficiency disease\nmy body doesn't make antibodies to fight\nagainst infection or bacteria\nor viruses so\ni have to uh\ni have to be apart from people a lot\nbecause i catch things very very easily\nand uh\ni've uh lived my life getting sick a lot\nand because of that i developed a lung\ncondition and\nuh i'm on a\nbreeding breathing uh an oxygen\nconcentrator and i'm on like uh\nuh\ni get so embarrassed talking about i\nhave like a\nit's very embarrassing for me to talk\nabout\ni just feel very like uh\nwell so first of all we don't have to\ntalk about it if it embarrasses you but\ni'm i'm kind of curious\nso can i just clarify a couple of things\nso you said you have cvid so that's\ncommon variable immunodeficiency\nyeah okay\nand\nwhat what makes you embarrassed as you\ntalk about that can you help me\nunderstand what makes that embarrassing\nfor you\ni think i think it's just uh\nit's hard to say for me because i feel\nlike\nuh\nmy whole life i've uh had to see people\nyou know live their life normally\nand to me i always felt like\nan outsider like looking\nat other people living their life and\ni've always felt kind of like\nstuck\nuh\nand uh\ni you know growing up and like uh\nbecoming an adult i noticed that a lot\nof people's experiences are way\ndifferent than mine because\ndue to my uh condition i haven't really\nbeen able to live as much as a normal\nperson\nso i feel like i can't really like\nconnect with others that well\nand uh it's it's\nit makes me feel you know\nkind of sad about i feel kind of sad but\ni also just feel really embarrassed\nbecause i feel like\ni feel like society like\nplaces like this pressure on us that we\nhave to be\nwe have to hit certain milestones and we\nhave to be\nsome type of person\nand because the fact that i have never\nhit those particular milestones and the\nfact that i'm not uh\nlike i like to say i'm not a normal\nhuman i've always felt like an alien\ni've always felt like\nnot\nnormal\nand uh\nwhen i talk to people i i feel that like\na lot and it just\ni feel kind of ashamed and i think it's\njust because of the pressures of society\nuh\ni've talked to other people that have\nlike chronic illness as well and they've\nshared a similar\nviewpoint to mine so i you know it's\nstreaming has really like changed my\nlife where i'm able to\ni'm able to communicate with people more\nand i feel like i've connected with so\nmany people and\npeople\ntalk to me\nto talk to me and i feel like they're\nnot focused on\nmy medical devices and they're not\nfocused on the fact that i\nuh you know might do things a little\ndifferently and live my life a little\ndifferently\nand uh\nit's it's really nice it's really nice\nto have uh somebody treat me normally\nand not like uh\ni'm about to like break\nat every step you know\nyeah wow\nit's clear to me that so first of all\nmiles you're you're very eloquent\nwell thank you\num\nyou know i've i've seen i've worked with\npeople with chronic medical conditions\nas well and i think you've\nyou know after a year of group therapy\nthe conclusions that we'll come to is\nsomething that you know i think you\nshare very very beautifully this sort of\nidea that\nand i'm kind of curious\nabout a lot of things that you said but\ni think it's really profound to hear you\nsort of say that\nyou know life\nwe sort of had this expectation that\nlife is supposed to go like this like if\nyou're six years old you go over to\nfriends birthday parties and when you're\nnine or ten you have a sleepover and\nthen there's just all these experiences\nwhich like normal life is what we call a\nnormal life\nand that you were essentially denied\nthose experiences right so then how do\nyou feel about yourself how do you like\nrecognize you know you don't feel normal\nand then furthermore society\nkind of judges you for that right there\nare all these as you said milestones\nand so if a normal person if a healthy\nperson if a good person right because we\nalso place value judgments\non a lot of these milestones\num if you're not able to participate in\nthose how do you start to feel about\nyourself\nyou know like there's a certain amount\nof like shame that comes with\nnot\nyou know i i don't know the best example\ni can think of is is there's a certain\nage at which\npeople start asking you okay like when\nare you gonna get married and stuff like\nthat right and then like if you're not\nfollowing that standard track or when\nare you gonna get a job\nwhen are you dot dot dot there are all\nthese assumptions right about what your\nlife is supposed to be like and there's\nkind of this like idea that if you're\nnot going to do those things no one ever\nasks you do you want to get married\nright people just are sort of like they\ntry to bucket you based on\nwhat society kind of expects\nand then if you don't\nfall into one of those buckets then you\nkind of like are a weirdo\ntrue\nand\nand so it's really interesting to hear\nyou kind of share your experience about\nbeing an outsider\nyeah i've uh\ni've had i've had a lot of time\nuh to myself uh i've had a lot of time\nto think about things and to reflect\nyou know cause it's like when people\nwith my condition like uh as much as\nsometimes the medical system wants you\nto believe that you don't have time\nsometimes all you have is time because\nyou kind of like when you live with the\nlife that i've lived where it's like i'm\nbasically isolated most of the time\nuh it feels like\na moment is like forever and not\nit's like time is like so strange\nbecause it feels like a day can be a\nmonth but a month can be a minute it's\nso weird\nand i've had a lot of time to think\nabout myself and to think about uh\nall the stuff that i've been through and\nuh it's a lot of thinking\nyeah i'd love to hear more about that\ncan you tell me a little bit about\nwhat have you discovered\nas you\nyou know you have time and you you think\nabout yourself i'd love to learn more\nabout what you've discovered about\nyourself identity the nature of humanity\ni mean i don't i don't think i have any\ngood answers uh because\nwhy why not\nwhy do you think you don't have any good\nanswers uh i don't know i just feel like\ni'm not uh\ni'm not experienced enough uh i feel\nlike i'm always learning and uh\ni just have horrific self-esteem issues\nit's it's pretty bad uh but it's because\nof of everything that i've been through\nuh i feel like when when\nwhen a person has to deal with a chronic\nillness their whole life\nit's like their stages of like disease\nprocess where it's like at first it's\nnot that bad but then when the severity\nuh increases\nthings start getting taken away\nand it's\nit's traumatic\nwell it's like uh\nyou start feeling like you're losing\nthings like you're losing your freedom\nand you're losing your ability to do\nnormal human things\nuh which is something that i experienced\nuh basically you know because there was\na moment in my life where i was kind of\nnormal and my life was you know i was\ngoing to school and uh\ni had i had friends here and there but\nit wasn't like\nas normal as i wanted it to be\nbut uh you know as as i grew up and i\ngot older uh my the severity of my\ncondition\ngot worse\nand uh i slowly started like losing\nthings i started losing\nuh the ability to be able to go out uh\nuh connect with other people\nuh\ni had a moment of my life where i\ncouldn't really speak i had a moment in\nmy life where i couldn't\nwalk i've had\nvery uh\ntraumatic experiences happen to me\nwhere it's like you just feel like\neverything's just being taken away from\nyou\nand uh you have to kind of like\nyou have to learn how to\nbe you have to learn how to accept the\nfact that you're not the same person\nthat you were before\nand you're going through changes and you\nmay not like the changes\nbut unfortunately this is what's\nhappening and uh\ni've had to try to like pick up whatever\npieces of myself i had left\nto be able to continue and to be able to\nuh be here right now\nyeah what what's it like to have things\ntaken away from you like that sounds\nhorrifying\nit's it's like a nightmare it's\nit's very scary\nuh\nbut um\nit's\nit's something that uh\ni couldn't i couldn't stop it from\nhappening because\nyou know when you when you get diagnosed\nwith something and they tell you well\nin this amount of time this is what's\ngonna happen and this is what's gonna\nhappen and eventually this is gonna\nhappen and you kind of know\nwhat's gonna happen you kind of expect\nthings to happen but you don't you're\nnot truly prepared until it starts\nhappening\nso it kind of like\nit's it's a lot can you tell me mouse if\nyou feel comfortable like i'd love to\nhear an actual example or like tell me a\nstory because i'm so curious because\nwhat i'm getting from you is sort of\nlike\nthe lessons that you've learned and kind\nof the conclusions that you you've come\nto the ways in which you've grown and\nlearned to accept things\nbut what i'm really curious about is\nlike how you got to where you are\nright so i'm really wondering because i\nthink that\ncertainly your your situation sounds\nquite severe but\ni think there are\npeople out there who\nhave had things taken away from them and\ni'm so curious it's almost like\nin a sense the reason it's kind of sad\nbut the reason that you're so good at\ngrowing and learning from it is because\nit happens to you like over and over and\nover again\nyeah\nyou know\nright\nso that sucks but at the same time i\nthink you really do have something to\noffer and something that we could learn\nfrom in terms of like what is that\nexperience like for you because when you\nsay you learn to accept it it's like\ni mean not everyone\nright\nand\nright\nyeah i think i like some somehow a long\ntime ago something my brain broke so i'm\nkind of like\nwhat do you mean by that i don't know i\ni i used to be very uh i still think i\nam emotional at times but there was just\na moment where i just\nsomething in me was just like\ni i gotta do something with my life\nbecause\nyou know if i just sit here and i'm just\ncontent with everything that's hot if i\njust accept everything that's happening\nto me i'm never going to do anything and\nit's just going to get worse and uh\nuh\ni'm not going to be happy so uh that's\nonce i don't know i feel like uh\nsomething kind of like\ncan you tell me about that more about\nthat moment what was going on in your\nlife and and um\ndo you remember\nwell kind of it kind of goes hand in\nhand with\nmy previous\nmy previous life which is kind of like\nhow i want to refer to it but uh so when\ni was in school i was studying opera uh\nat school\ni really wanted to become an opera\nsinger it was like my dream\nand uh\nwhen my condition started getting worse\nunfortunately i had to quit school and i\nhad to quit singing\nand i just thought\nthis is it for me that's it um there's\nnothing else left for me\nuh\ni'm just gonna\nfade away and never\naccomplish anything in my life\nand it took me a very long time\nto accept my situation i was very upset\nfor a long time\ni was very sad very angry i was very\ni was questioning i was just like why\nis this happening to me and why\nwhy doesn't it stop and why doesn't it\nget better i don't understand what did i\ndo you know\nand uh\nand\nyeah what kind of answers did you come\nup with when you ask you know why is\nthis happening to you what did i do why\nisn't it getting better\nit just got to the point where i just\ndecided\nthere is no answer and it happened\nbecause it happens and i could either\njust keep on wondering why or just say\nwell it happened what do i do now\nand uh i slowly started\ntrying to find things that made me happy\nagain and trying to find\nthings that i liked again and trying to\nfind myself as a person which i kind of\nlost myself for quite some time uh\nbecause i fell into like a very uh\ndark part of my life uh when my\ncondition started getting worse or i was\njust like i just i just uh\ni couldn't i just didn't i wasn't happy\nat all\nbut uh with that's why with streaming\nslowly i found myself again i was able\nto talk to people which is something\nthat i really wanted to do i really\nwanted to connect with people again and\nyou know feel like i have friends and\nuh i wanted to\ni don't know uh\ni guess i try to like\nbe more\nopen and be more\naccepting of myself and\njust really like\nexperience\nmyself and learn what do i like what\ndon't i like\nand\nwith streaming i started singing again\nand uh\nit's funny because it's like i feel like\nall the things that i wanted to do\nthat i was dreaming about doing\nuh when i was a kid uh i'm doing it but\ni'm just doing it in a really strange\ndifferent way than i ever thought that i\nwas that i would be able to do it so\ni thought i wouldn't be able to do the\nthings that i want to do but i kind of\nam doing them i'm just doing them\nextremely differently\nand in a way that i never thought i\nwould ever do\nyeah what i'm i'm kind of hearing is\nthat there's like\nyou know there's like an essence\nof what we want like if you think about\nbeing an opera singer\ni don't know necessarily that it's opera\nbut there's something about\nyou know there's like what is it about\nbeing an opera singer that appealed to\nyou\nand that we can oftentimes sort of find\nthat same essence in a different path\nyeah\nof of you know\nbeing on stage or or sharing something\nwith the world and something that also\nwhen i think about opera i don't think\nabout\nyou know there's something kind of\ntragic\nabout opera\nyeah a lot of tragic stories yeah right\nand i mean if i'm listening to this\nstory i think like this could definitely\nbe an opera you know\nthat's right\nlike you know it's it's almost like your\nyour whole life has become an opera oh\ngod\noh dear\ni mean i don't know too much about opera\nbut\nright maybe\nbecause there's certainly there's like\nthere's like tragedy and like you know\nwe don't even the other thing that i'm\nterrified of is if your life is operas\nmy understanding is that most operas\ndon't end well\nwhich is where i hope you live happily\never after but\nyou know i mean well i have dark humor\nit's fine you know yeah i think you need\nto to survive what you've been through\noh god i do i i i have a very uh\ni make a lot of dark jokes uh sometimes\ni feel bad because i typically keep them\nto myself but they've been moments where\nit just slips on stream and people like\nmouse what are you saying no don't say\nthat i'm like\nsorry\nyes\nyou know i i think there's a there's a\ncorrelation between dark humor and how\nterrible thing how dark things are you\nknow i think sometimes\nthe the most the darkest humor that i've\never seen is from people who are\nterminally ill and people who are taking\ncare of people who are terminally ill\nand so it's yeah there's something about\nhow humanity\ngrapples with that\nbut\nyeah so that's so interesting so and and\nso\nwhat i'm kind of hearing is that in a\nsense you're living your best life like\nkind of right now\nkind of yeah uh you know\nyou know i'm i'm still going through a\nlot of things uh but\ni've\ni've never felt more\ni feel alive\nand it's something that i haven't felt\nin\nsuch a long time\nit's i didn't even think it would ever\nbe possible for me to feel alive again\nand i feel like i'm actually living my\nlife and\ni don't feel like a spectator anymore\nyou know\ni felt like i was like\nyeah i felt like i was it's kind of why\nlike it's funny because i kind of tied\nin my normal my my life into like my v\ntuber lore you know because\nwhen you're a veto very kind of playing\na character and my lore is kind of like\nmy real life where it's like\nuh i'm on\nwhat do you mean by lore\nmike and my character my youtuber\ncharacter uh i'm supposed to be satan\nand uh i was trapped in a box in hell\nand uh i was released from a box in hell\nand now i live on earth and uh i\nuh\nam a live streamer and in in a lot of\nways it's kind of like\nuh a parallel to my real life because\ni've always felt like\ni was trapped in a box certainly\nand uh it's it's it's it's a way that\ni've been feeling my whole life where\nit's like i feel like\ni was inside this box just looking at\neverybody living their life and seeing\nmy family go through their lives and\nand experiencing things and i'm just\nwatching just watching everybody do all\nthese things and\ni can now\nyou're taking the internet and the rest\nof the world by storm i'm gonna take it\nall\nyeah or or not i don't know\nyeah that's so interesting you know i\nwonder if\ni mean you talk about this person as a\ncharacter right your your mouse is a\ncharacter but what i'm kind of hearing\nfrom you is i i don't know i mean it\nreally makes me wonder about\nblurring the lines of what's real and\nwhat's yeah\nshe is me uh she is me i am her it's\njust a more\ni feel like mouse is like\nshe's just uh\nme dialed up to like a hundred which\ni'm dialed up to 100 all the time anyway\nbut this is like uh\nwell i mean i would imagine you know\nhere i'm just just tossing this out that\ni think there are parts of you that\nsound like they're dialed up 200 but i\nimagine that mouse also helps you dial\ndown parts to zero that is true\nyeah that's very true\nthat's like go hand in hand\nyeah\nmakes me wonder a lot about just you\nknow\nquote-unquote normal people\nand\nand and whether\ni think sometimes we may take it for\ngranted how\nmuch we're actually doing what you do as\nwell i think you're closer to normal the\nmore that i talk to you i mean i don't i\ndon't think you're\nweird\nreally i have people tell me that all\nthe time but it's just i it's just\nsomething that i felt i've always felt\nlike i was not a human i felt like\nwhen did you start feeling that way\na creature oh\ni started feeling like a creature\ni want to say since i was like four\nyears old when i could like\ni feel like at four years old i\nlike i officially like was aware that i\nwas alive\nlike you know with\ni had thoughts because\ni feel like before that i didn't really\nhave any thoughts so i i can't say\nuh i only go by stories that my mom\ntells me\nbut uh\naround four years old i think because\nthat's when\nthat's when stuff started getting very\ncomplicated and\nuh\nuh you know uh so\nmy condition like it\nit had stages where it was like when i\nwas very young i was very sick but then\nuh at around a certain age it kind of\ncalmed down but then when i hit another\nage it got worse and it's been like\na downward spiral ever since\nbut around four years old that's when\nthings started getting pretty uh\ndifficult\nand uh i started to\nuh\ni started to feel i started to realize\nthat i\nwas i affected my family like a lot\nand i was very aware\nuh but i was very aware of the stress\nthat my parents had to endure because of\nme\nand have kind of are you aware of that\nas a four-year-old i'm curious what is\nthe ex like how does a four-year-old\nunderstand that\ni just i i don't even know how i knew i\njust knew that my parents were always\nmy parents\nso i come from a a\npuerto rican household uh so uh my\nmy parents are always very\nthey're very\nthey're very catholic\nokay\nthey're very catholic and they are very\nuh worrying they they worry a lot uh and\nthey are very emotional they're very\nemotional people\nuh\nand what does that mean emotional people\num they they they're very open with\ntheir emotions\nyeah they're they're very open so\nexpressions of love expressions of fear\nyeah very very open about it uh\nand i think it was a lot for me\nuh to handle uh\ni appreciate the fact that they were\nvery open with me\nuh because i feel like i feel like it\nmade me aware of their feelings a lot\nand i don't know i i feel like there was\nsome good in it but i also feel like\nit was kind of not that\ngood\nhow so\nuh\nbecause it made i felt a lot of pressure\nuh growing up because of that because\npressure to do what\npressure to\nbe healthy\nso that my parents wouldn't worry about\nme because i felt like a burden on my\nfamily my whole life so i'm\ni'm almost i can imagine that you maybe\nfelt responsible for their stress\nlike maybe if you were healthier they\ncould all relax and chill out and\nwouldn't have to cry\nor other things\nyeah that's part of the reason why now\nuh i i take care of my parents uh\nso much uh i\ni\nam doing everything in my power to\nmake their\nown\nold age years be as comfortable as\npossible\nbecause i just felt like\ni was um\ni was very\nrough i was a very uh difficult child to\nhave\nhelp me understand what made you a\ndifficult child to have\num\nuh i you know uh\nthere was a lot of moments with my\nparents where they were worried about me\nand worried about my health and uh\ni you know i saw things growing up where\nuh\nmy parents were very desperate to see\nhow they could fix me\nand uh\nthey they don't they didn't understand\nwhy i was born this way\nuh\nthey felt\nyou know there were moments in private\nthat i witnessed that i know i wasn't\nsupposed to see\nwhere uh my mom was like\nmy mom felt like she did something and\nthat's why\ni'm the one that was paying for it and i\nthink it's because of like the whole\ncatholic guilt thing you know yeah so\nthere's a lot of like catholic guilt\ngoing on\nand uh you know uh i was taken to a lot\nof like faith healing which was very a\nshame on them for praying on my mom\nbecause\nit made me very sad can you\nor do you feel comfortable talking about\nthat i find myself being very curious\num\ni could talk about a little bit i don't\nwant to go too much into detail but uh\nyou know when when\nmy parents were very\nthey tried everything my mom thought oh\nwell if i take her to this uh prayer\ncircle or this healing thing uh she's\ngonna be fine or uh oh somebody from\nchurch\nuh said if i just get her like this type\nof plant and i make it in like a tea\nshe's gonna she's gonna get better and\nit was just like a lot of like\nthings where\ni could see\ngrowing up i could see the increasing\namount of stress\nthat was weighing upon my mom where she\nwas she felt like she was trying\neverything\nand nothing was working\nand uh it\njust grew more and more anxiety in me\nuh to the point where i\ni was just\ni think that also attributed to the\namount of like guilt and embarrassment\nthat i felt because i\njust kept thinking well you know if i\nif i try what they want to try and if it\nworks then that's great and they're\ngoing to be happy and it's going to be\ngreat and it's going to be fine but\nunfortunately that's not how things work\nand uh\nyou know i've had to feel guilty for a\nvery long time\ni felt like\ni was a cause of a lot of stress uh\nin my family's life and uh\nyeah\ni mean i'm just kind of imagining that\nyou know in a weird way it's like\nthe the harder they try there's like\nmore desperation and more desperation\nand more desperation\nand in a weird way like the more\ndesperately they try to fix you i'm just\nsort of thinking that the one thing that\ngets reinforced each time they try\nsomething\nstranger and stranger and stranger is\nthat the one truth at the end of the day\nis that you're broken in some way\nso\nin a bizarre way i'm almost wondering if\nlike that's kind of what gets reinforced\nthere right which is like\nand then you're sort of left with this\nburden of you see your parents like\nbending over backwards and doing this\nand that and like they clearly want you\nto get better\nand you really want to get better but\nyou sort of can't but you kind of feel\nlike responsible for not being able to\nyeah\nyeah that's uh that's basically\nwhat i went through i felt very uh\nresponsible for\na lot of\nuh pain that my family went through and\nin turn you know i had my own pain but\nthen i also had the pain that i felt\nlike i was inflicting upon others\nbecause of my\nissues\nand it was just a lot of\nit grew a lot of like self-hatred in me\nand\nmy self-esteem suffered so much because\nof that\nand i\nit took a very very long time for me to\nlearn to\nbegin to\nlike myself because i can't really\nhonestly say that i love myself\nyet\nbut i do like myself a little bit more\nthan i used to because i really used to\nhate myself like a lot\nhow did that start to change for you\num\ni think for me it took some time uh\ni think\nin starting streaming and then becoming\na youtuber i was really able to\nuh connect with other people\nand i got to know\nother people and i feel like\nin learning\nyou know more about other people i\nlearned more about the things that i\nliked and i learned more about myself as\na person\nand\neverybody was so nice to me and uh i\nit it was almost like you know people\nwould be like oh mouse you know\nyou're so funny almost you know we we\nlike you\nand\nthere were so many like wonderful words\nfrom people that i've\nlike met\nand\nin my brain i would always be like yeah\nthat's not true they're just\nyou know just pretending to be nice or\nwhatever but\nuh\ni don't know i slowly\nstarted to see myself in a different way\nuh with the help of my community and uh\ni i just i'm really thankful for that\nand i'm not i've met a couple of really\nwonderful\nuh people that are also like streamers\nand stuff and creators that\ni've gotten to know uh\nuh privately and uh we've become really\nclose friends and\nit's like\nit's it's just really nice to be able to\ntalk to other people because i feel like\nin learning more about them i learned\nmore about myself and\ni don't know i i can't really like\npinpoint when i started feeling\ndifferently\ni just know that slowly without even\nrealizing it like i\nstarted liking myself a little bit more\ni don't think i'm completely there but\nuh i definitely don't hate myself\nanymore but uh\ni don't love myself but i'm i'm i'm in\nthe middle i'm getting there i think\nyeah i think that's actually very very\nimportant in a weird way like\nif you were frustrated with yourself for\nnot loving yourself already\nthat actually like moves you more\ntowards self-hatred\nyeah does that kind of make sense and so\nin a weird way like accepting yourself\nfor not being able to love yourself is\nactually like the way to move towards\nself-love\nyeah\nright it's kind of weird but we that\nalso we can slip into this sort of thing\nwhere it's like well i'm supposed to\nlove myself like what the hell is wrong\nwith me i can't love myself\ni think that was just like very\ni think it was more like\ni had years of my life where i was just\nreally mad at myself and i was just\nreally angry what were you mad at\nyourself for\nit wasn't really like myself it was like\ni was mad at my body\nbecause i just felt like it was\nbetraying me and i felt like\ni just felt like uh somehow\ni was be you know i was betraying myself\nand even though it was it wasn't\nanything that i can control\nuh it things happen you know and\nit took me a very long time to learn to\naccept that sometimes\n[ __ ] happens and\nthere's nothing that i could do to\nchange it but the way that i react\ntowards the change that's what i can\ncontrol\nwhere did you learn that\nuh\nit's just something that i've learned\nover time i think because i just\ni just felt like there was just\nsomething that i needed to change\nbecause i was very unhappy and\ni just didn't want\nto remain\nalone and upset\ni hate saying angry i don't like saying\nthe word angry i don't like using the\nword angry i always say upset\nfor some reason\nanger scares me for some reason not sure\nwhy\nbut yeah i don't know i uh\ni just uh learned that i could\ncontrol\nthe way i react to things and\ni mean sometimes i can't control it but\ni try my best to you know but uh uh i\ndon't know i\ni'm just really weird\nwha what\ni think i'm just weird\nwhy\nlike weirder than normal people\nah yeah i think so\nwhy why do you think that i mean i\nrespectfully i disagree but help me\nunderstand why yeah oh yeah\nwhy\nso\nokay can i think for a second\nyeah you can think for a second\ni'm a confusing individual i'm sorry\nno i i mean i don't\ni\num\nwhat's so funny i like to laugh\nokay\nso here's\nand so mouse i'm going to just share\nsome thoughts about\nhow i understand you which a couple of\ncaveats the first is we've been talking\nfor about 45 minutes so\nthere's really no way for me to like\ntruly understand who you are\nand at the same time i think that part\nof the reason that i i feel\nlike i understand something about you is\nbecause i think that\nwhat you share is like actually very\nauthentic and very relatable and in a\nsense quite normal\ni mean i i think that despite all of the\nchallenges that you've faced you've sort\nof like\nso you're inspiring and i think that\nsometimes what happens is human beings\nlike really really struggle right and\nthey suffer\nand as a result of that suffering\nthey're sort of like tested on the most\nbasic levels\nand some some people crumble and some\npeople don't\nand if we look at it historically the\npeople who don't when they open their\nmouth\nthey're able to like connect\nto other people\nand so in a strange way i think that you\nputting on essentially the mask of a v\ntuber\nallows you to be\nvery authentic\nright so there's there's something like\nal almost like\nyou can truly be yourself because you're\nkind of hiding so like clearly behind a\nmask\nyeah and so the funny thing is it's\nactually like in a sense you fix\nso much of what is wrong with the world\nwhich is that we all put on what we\npretend to be our authentic faces\nbut we're like shady on the inside\nright so i'm gonna walk around with this\nface\nand then like but what i display with\nwhat the way that i interact with this\nface is gonna be like fundamentally\ndifferent from the way that i feel\ninside\nright so like i put on an act even\nthough i'm wearing my real skin\nand the weird thing is that somehow\nyou've managed to flip it where you put\non a fake skin and therefore\nyou can actually be like the closest\nversion of your real self\nand so i think what what connects with\npeople is that\nyou know what you're talking about being\nan outsider\nfeeling like an alien\ni'm going to steer clear of the anger\nbut\nyou know like having\nas you put a horrific self-esteem and\nthen like like even this i mean there's\nso many journeys that i've heard you\nwalk\nwhich like you kind of i mean we haven't\ngone into too much but even this sort of\nidea of like\ni don't want my life to be this way\nanymore\nand why is my life because there are so\nmany places where people get stuck like\none place where people get stuck is like\nwhy is my life this way why me why can't\nmy body be different\nand in a weird way i mean i i don't i\ndon't think comparison is very helpful\nbut you know a lot of people can be\nuncomfortable with their body or their\nbody can fail them in some fundamental\nway and so people find themselves asking\nthat question i just don't know that\neveryone makes it through that right so\nsome people never like some people\ndevelop an eating disorder or like some\nother you know some problem\nand then they just kind of like they're\nsort of stuck there but somewhere along\nthe way you kind of like made it through\nthat and you're just sort of like well\nlike it doesn't have to have a reason it\njust is\nand so then the question kind of becomes\nwell what do i do about it\nand that's where at some point you sort\nof realize and this is what's so\nterrifying for people and i i don't i'm\njust gonna keep going\nbut like\nwhen you think about okay what am i\ngonna do about it what most people think\nabout the doing is like changing the\noutside right so if i if i feel lonely\nwhat am i gonna do about it like i'm\ngonna go get in shape and i'm gonna make\nmore money and then i'm gonna like you\nknow take all these classes so i know\nhow to make small talk and then like i'm\ngonna become like this awesome external\nhuman being i'm gonna fix all the\nproblems on the outside so i can connect\nwith other people\nthe weird thing is that in a weird way\nlike that's not an option for you right\nlike you can't fix fundamentally like\nthe body that you've been given\nand so in a weird way i think that\nyou've actually gone like internally and\nso we hear a lot about these journeys\nwhere you kind of talk about you know\nbeing really upset with yourself like\nlearning to accept yourself and then\nsort of saying there is no answer there\nis no reason but i'm tired of being\nlonely\nand i'm tired of like being upset with\nmyself and something has to change\nand you discover that you can't you know\nbecause life is like in a weird way i\ndon't want\ni was about to use the word lucky but\nthat's not really the right word\nyou know in a weird way like there's\nexternal change and fixing things on the\noutside is was not an option for you\nright\nand so the only place you had to look\nwas like internally and in a sense i\nthink that's actually like really really\nuseful hopefully for people to\nunderstand is because what i see is i\nsee people who try to go fixing things\non the outside fixing things on the\noutside fixing things up on the outside\ni recently for example was talking to\nsomeone who you know was thinking about\ntraveling to india and and getting\nsurgery so that they could could get\ntheir shins lengthened they felt they\nwere too short and they could get like\nthey could literally like there are\nsurgeons in india that will break apart\nyour bones\ninsert rods and make you like three\ninches or four inches taller yeah that's\nlike a that's a year recovery that's\nrough\nthat's a yeah i mean some people don't\nrecover at all like some people have\nlifelong pain from that kind of surgery\nand debilitation and stuff like that\num but it sounds like you're\nknowledgeable about it\noh i know a lot of things oh yeah i can\nsee that because you have infinite time\nright you have nowhere to go but yeah\ni've experienced a lot of uh\nmedical things and uh i i've seen a lot\nof stuff and i've it's so strange\nbecause like through the medical system\ni've met a lot of inspiring interesting\npeople\nand uh it's\nit's it's it's\ni didn't really like think about it as\nconnections until now you know what do\nyou mean by that what do you mean by\nconnections because when\nwhen you're in the moment of going\nthrough\nthe motions of like being sick\nand you're in like a hospital like i've\nhad stays where it's like sometimes i'll\nbe in\nthere have been times where i've been in\nfor like five months or six months or\nyou know for quite some time uh very ill\nyou don't really think about the people\nthat you meet on the inside at the time\nuh it's now that uh i reflect upon the\npeople that i met\nin my time there because i spent so much\ntime there and i had such a desire to\nget out of it that i just didn't really\nlike\nthink about\nthe people that were there and now is\nwhat i'm thinking about the people that\ni met and thinking about oh yeah you\nknow i remember meeting so and so\nuh they were on the same floor as me and\nthey were going through this and i\nremember they always used to act a\ncertain way or or say this to me or\nand it isn't until now that i\ni think men i was i was making\nconnections back then too\ni just didn't see the less connections\nbecause to me\npeople i would meet\nin the hospital was it was such like a\nfinal thing to me you know i didn't\nreally think about\nthat\nit's it's weird yeah i mean i\ni think that makes sense the hospital is\njust a separate universe\nyeah right\nyeah you enter a place where time and\nrelationships like\ni mean i i sort of know this from i mean\na little bit from the patient side but\nmore from the doctor side that you form\nreally powerful connections but they're\nlike\nin this artificial world\nand and i still remember patients that\nyou know i'd grown very very close to\nand just learned so much from that had\nsuch a profound impact on me becoming\nthe person that i am today and i've like\nyou know you'll see them every day for a\nmonth and then you'll never see them\nagain like i haven't seen them in a\ndecade\nso it's kind of\nweird um\nlike a parallel universe yeah\nbut i i think it's so interesting to\nhear\nyou know your experience of like being\nan outsider i'm kind of curious do you\nfeel like an outsider now\num there are times that i do it's\nstrange because for the most part i feel\ni don't feel that way but\ni do at the same time but it's not\nit's not\nas\nbad as i\ni don't necessarily see it as a bad\nthing like i used to feel back then like\ni'm very much aware\nthat i'm not like other people\nbut uh i also feel\ndifferently it's so it's so hard to\nexplain to me\nbecause i have moments where it's like\noh i'll be talking to another streamer\nor you know i'll talk to a friend of\nmine and we'll talk about taking a trip\nand\ndoing certain things and\nthose are just some things that i just\nmight never be able to do\nand i'm very much aware that they're\nthings that i might not ever be able to\ndo\nbut that's okay\nbecause i'm doing other things and uh\nit's it's strange because it's like i\nfeel different but i don't necessarily\nfeel like an outsider it's it's it's\nweird\nuh i i i wonder if this is where\nsometimes what i'm sort of hearing is\nthat you may still actually kind of\nunderstand and in a weird way feel like\nyou're an outsider but you just it\ndoesn't you know it doesn't cause you\nsuffering anymore\nno it doesn't i mean i do have my\nmoments sometimes because you know\nas i get closer to people uh i've met so\nmany great friends streaming and i have\na desire to see them and have a desire\nto you know uh recently like so my\nfriends went on a trip and\ni was like man i really wish i could\nhave been there and\nit makes me sad for a moment but\nyou know\nthey're so they're so nice to me and\nthey accommodate me and you know we'll\nfacetime and we'll do different things\nso it's it's just really nice to see\nthat you know they care\nand they understand that i am this way\nand they accept me for this way\nand uh\ni'm\nliving my life a little differently but\ni'm a human\nyeah i mean\nor very differently but\nyou know\nyeah any questions for me\nanything that you in particular that\nwe've talked about that you want to talk\nabout more or\ni don't even know my brain is all over\nthe place it's uh it's it's interesting\nuh\ni don't really get to talk\nlike this much\nwhat does like this mean\nuh\nyou know about\nmy my feelings and my thoughts and uh my\nlife\ni don't really dive into it too much\ni've only recently started talking about\nmy illness on stream\nuh cause not just because i you know i\nwon't be able to see me normally but\nalso you know because of the shame thing\nbut\nit's like\ni just\nyou know i i'm also very much aware\nthat uh you know when\nsometimes\nyou just can't talk about these things\nbecause they're very heavy and it it's\nit's difficult to bring them up and it's\ndifficult\nto talk about on stream\nand people come to watch sometimes\nbecause they want to escape and they\nwant to have a good time and\nnot necessarily listen to me\ntalk about stuff like this yeah\ncertainly i i the thing that made me\nlaugh a little bit is it's difficult to\nbring up\nyeah how are y'all doing today well\ni'm filled with an internal existential\ncrisis about why my body fails me at so\nmany levels and i'm not able to have a\nnormal human life\nhow are you today\nlike hey guys i had like a horrific\ninfection and uh i lost my voice for a\nyear and that's why i sound funny and uh\ni'm\ncurrently\nanxious about my life every day and in a\npanic so how are you doing yeah right\nand i think that kind of goes back to\nbut i think that goes back to the mask\nthat we put on\nyeah so we we ask each other all the\ntime like when we're moving around in\nour our what is that flesh tuber\nwhen i'm a flesh tuber\nand i'm i don't even know if the two so\nif i'm just interacting with someone at\na grocery store am i a flesh tube or\nthat or am i just a flesh you're in your\nflesh prison flesh prison so when i when\ni'm in my prison of the flesh\nyou know which\nis a i don't even know what to think\nabout that but\num\nyou know because we we don't share who\nwe are right like when we are struggling\nor if we aren't sure about what we're\ndoing in life and stuff like that you\ncan people ask you how are you and what\nyou sort of say is like\noh i'm good how are you\nyeah\nand so it kind of makes sense\nand that's where like at this point i'm\nkind of wondering about a couple of\nthings mouse like\nyeah i have other questions but\nand i also have kind of other\nyeah is there something in particular\nthat you want to talk about more or\nanything that i could help you with\nuh\ni don't know you could you can ask me\nanything you like if i don't feel\ncomfortable i just won't say anything\nokay\num\nso let me offer like a couple of\ndifferent\noptions\nand let me know what if anything if you\nwant to talk about the stuff so um\nlet me just think for a second\nso the first thing that that i've kind\nof been steering clear of is anger but i\nthink anger is very very important it\ndoesn't have to be important now\nthe other thing that i'm kind of curious\nabout is\nso sometimes when i like when i talk to\npeople on stream what i find i want to\ndo more than anything else is hug them\nat some point in my life\nlike i feel like that's really what's\nmissing from stream is like i just want\nto give people a hug\nand\ni also remember like even as when i was\nlike a psychiatrist you know we're we're\ntaught i mean i guess i'm still a\npsychiatrist but when i was like doing a\nlot of clinical practice\nwe're sort of trained that we're not\nsupposed to like touch our patients\nand that that you know that that sort of\nunspoken rule is is there is good and is\nthere for a reason but i spent some time\ntalking to my supervisors and stuff\nabout it and i think that like i found a\nway to you know respectfully talk about\ngiving hugs and and sort of like\nyou know hugs or handshakes or whatever\nand and now after having like sort of a\ncalm conversation with a patient i you\nknow we may decide like hugging or not\nhugging\num and so i'm i'm a little bit i find\nmyself being very\nhaving an internal sense of wanting to\nknow what you quote unquote really look\nlike\num wanting to give you a hug\nand i'm not saying that we need to talk\nabout that but it's just something that\ni'm i'm\nyou know i wonder\njust something about this bear like so\non the one hand you're authentic\nyou know and i think you're very very\nhonest and you share your experiences\nvery very authentically and i think\nthat's actually what allows people to\nconnect with you i think that's what\nallows\num you to make friends\nyou know you feel connected you don't\ni'm getting the sense that you don't\nfeel quite as lonely as you used to is\nthat fair to say\nyeah yeah i don't i don't i do feel it\nfrom time to time but uh not not so much\nanymore and it's nice\nyeah so i'm just a little bit curious\nabout\nyou know that connection between sort of\nlike on on the one hand it's very\nauthentic and even in a sense more\nauthentic than you can get with two\npeople who are in flesh prisons\nbecause there is you've almost like\nleaned into this idea of like this is a\nmask that i'm going to put on and we're\nall going to kind of do that and\nparadoxically when you sort of put that\non is like when you get to be the most\nyourself\nyeah right\nso i think we could talk a little bit\nmore about that we could talk about\nanger um\nyou know i think there's also like\nquestions that we haven't really talked\nabout you mentioned that your family is\nvery catholic uh yeah\nand we sort of you know you kind of\nmentioned a little bit about how you\nmake sense of what happened to you but i\ndidn't hear anything about god or the\nwill of god in there so i'm a little bit\ncurious about from a spiritual\nperspective or religious perspective how\nyou've come to understand your life\num\nand if you're comfortable talking about\nany of that\nyou know but i don't mind i don't mind\ntalking about uh religion it's\njust something that i've always felt\nlike it's a very uh personal thing uh\ni i am the type of person where it's\nlike whatever you choose to believe in\nthat's that's up to you\nuh\neverything is valid uh\nmaybe that's me being weird\nbut uh uh i just think\nuh\ni don't know\nyou would think that a person in my\nposition would be very anti-god\nuh\nhowever uh i believe that there is\nsomething out there i don't know what it\nis\nuh there has to be something because i'm\nstill here and that's very strange\nso so why why would someone think that\nsomeone in your position would be\nanti-god\nuh\ni get a lot of comments i've i've gotten\na lot of comments in the past from\npeople like that have told me man if i\nwould have gone through all the things\nthat you that that you've been through i\nwould never like what though\nyou know\nit's a lot of like and i've i've met a\nlot of people\nuh with my\nuh\ncondition or something similar to my\ncondition\nand uh they they're very\nuh\nthey're very different they think very\ndifferently than i do\nuh how do they think differently from\nthe way you do\num i i've had a couple that uh they are\nvery\num very\nanti-anything\nand very upset\nvery angry\nuh\nand\nyou know it's it's normal when you go\nthrough these things\ni feel like it's very normal to feel\nthat way it's very normal to be upset\nand it's very normal to start\nquestioning\nexistence and to start\nbeing like what the f\nwhat the f higher power what's happening\nwell\nfirst say i don't believe in you at all\nso\nbut that's you know i\ni don't i i don't like judge anybody\nbecause of that and\neverybody's able to think whatever they\nwant but i just think for me\nthere has to be something out there\nbecause i'm still here and that's really\nstrange\nhelp me understand that a little bit\ni guess i don't know\nbecause no i mean i think i think you\nfeel pretty strongly about it\nyeah i do uh i respect my parents and\nand their beliefs and stuff like that\nand\nuh\nyou know but i uh\ni am\ni just feel like\nthere are a lot of odds stacked against\nme there have always been a lot of odds\nstacked against me i've always had a\nlife where it's like\nmy life has always been\nin like this strange little place where\nit's like\nwell\nsomething really bad is gonna happen to\nher supposed to happen or i'll have like\na doctor tell me well this is\nthis is the trajectory of your life and\nthis is and what would they say do you\nmind if i ask i mean you don't have to\nshow that if it's uncomfortable but\num uh a lot of uh stuff about uh\ni i i would get a lot of talks uh\na lot of we just want you to be\ncomfortable talks\nand\nyeah that's\nthat's uh\nwe just i feel like so how did you\nunderstand that when they would say\nsomething like that\num well uh and how old were you when\nthey started telling you that\nfairly young when it started happening\nuh very young and uh\nit was very frustrating for me because\nwhen i would start hearing that\ni feel like that was when my parents\nstopped having expectations for me\nand that really bothered me a lot it was\nmore like we just want you to be happy\nwe just want you to be okay\nuh they weren't\nthey used to be very like growing up my\nparents were pretty strict with me with\nlike grades and stuff and like school\nbut the second i started getting the we\njust wanted to be comfortable talks\nthat's when they were like it's okay\nit's fine it's fine everything was\nalways like it's fine\nit's gonna be okay you don't have to you\ndon't owe them anything you don't have\nto do anything you you're not you know\nnobody's judging you like it was just a\nlot of like uh\nit's okay because something\nyou know\nbecause of yeah\nlike what did that do to you dude\nit just made me feel it made me feel\nvery sad uh\nbecause um\nyou know my family is very\nuh into like achievements\nand to just have that taken away from me\nreally upset me\nand it made me feel very sad what what\nexactly was taken away from you the the\npossibility of achievement or the\nexpectation that\nyou should achieve\nyeah expectation uh\nthe desire to want me to achieve things\nor to have goals\nuh for a long time in my life\ni just felt like i wasn't allowed to\nhave any goals or any\nsounds like your parents gave up hope\nit it's strange because in a way they\ndidn't but then in other ways they did\nit was more like they they were\nsearching so hard to help me\nbut it just got to a point where\nin in them trying to search\nthey kind of\njust\ngot discouraged and uh it was just\nit was just a\nlot of\nsad\nstuff\nyeah so mouse i'm i'm gonna um is it\nokay if i kind of challenge you a little\nbit\nyeah\nokay\nso i i think that there's like i'm\ndetecting sort of like a\nabsence of emotion\nin particular directions\nso yeah and at the same time i want to\nlike respect some of your boundaries so\nif it's okay with you instead of asking\nyou questions about it like i'll share\nsome thoughts or hypotheticals what do\nyou think about that or do you not want\nto touch it with a 10-foot pole\nno you can if you if so like if i feel\ncomfortable let you know okay thank you\nso here's the first thing like i didn't\nrealize until just this moment how\ndevastating and that's the word like\nlike when you said\nmy parents stopped like when they're\nlike oh we just want you to be\ncomfortable like the first thought is\nlike that's not sad that's like\ndevastating\nlike oh my god\nyou know like to have no for your\nparents to like be focused on grades and\nstuff and then all of a sudden be like\nit's okay\nit's okay darling you don't have to\nworry about school\nlike that's not sad that's like\nterrifying\nlike what the hell is going on here like\nwhat's like\nyou know i i can't imagine what it's\nactually like for you know a kid who's\ngrowing up with these expectations to\nsuddenly like have those expectations\ntaken off the table and that to me\nsounds like the most terrifying\nprognosis ever\nyeah it was\nit was a lot\nuh i pretty much\nhad to basically\ni\nit's\ni was having this conversation with\nsomebody a couple nights ago where i was\nlike i felt like my whole life\ni just had to work 10 times more than\nthe average person\nbecause i had to do it for myself\nbecause nobody else was expecting\nanything out of me\nand i felt like if i just sit there and\naccept\nif i just sit there and accept being\ncomfortable\ni will never do anything and i am going\nto die\nand\ni didn't want that\nand uh\ni said no and i\nstarted\ntrying really really hard uh\ni sometimes i tried\ntoo hard where i would get in trouble\nfor it and i would get uh\nvery ill what do you mean by that\nuh\nwell i i eventually had to like drop out\nof school\nbut uh i was supposed to leave school\nsooner but i didn't because i wanted to\ntry to finish\nand i tried to force myself to finish\nschool\nand it got to the point where\nmy body was just like you cannot be here\nyou cannot be in school it is\nyou are\nit's bad you need to stop and i was very\nangry for a long time\nthat i couldn't finish school\nuh it really hurt me\nit was something that i really wanted to\ndo\nbut uh i ended up\nuh\ni ended up uh worsening my condition\nbecause i\nwas forcing myself to try to finish\nand uh\nyou know after that i kind of like went\nthrough a period where\ni was just\ni was just like you know what i\ni don't care anymore\nbut then\nin saying i don't care\ni started realizing i do care and\ni was like well i'm gonna try\ni'm gonna try to see if i could\nsomehow\ndo something to to\nto get out of this and\nit was it seemed hopeless for a while\nbecause my health got worse\nand things uh got worse for me\nbut uh i had like a moment\nof\nkind of like rest\nwhen i found streaming and i can say\nwith certainty streaming and v-tubing\nliterally saved my life\nit really did\ni i don't think i would be here if it\nwasn't for that\nand what did what it's how did streaming\nsave your life\nit it gave me something to work towards\nuh because i just\ni just felt like my whole life\ni had doors being shut\nleft and right everything was always\nbeing taken away from me\neverything was always no you can't do\nthis no you can't do that no you can't\ndo this because this is gonna happen if\nyou do this and you can't do that and it\nwas just like when i found streaming it\nwas like i'm gonna do this for myself\nand i'm gonna see\n[Music]\nwhat i can do and i didn't even go into\nit thinking that i was\ngoing to grow up uh audience i didn't\nthink about that i just wanted to make\nsome friends\ni just wanted to just\ndo something with my life because\nat the time uh when i first started\nstreaming\nuh i was uh very ill\nand uh i had gone through a moment in\ntime where i was uh completely bedridden\nfor\na while\nand uh\nit just\ntook out took a lot for me it took a lot\nout of me\nand uh\ni slowly with streaming\nwhich i started a few years ago\nuh i you know and my health improving\ni'm finally able to walk a little bit\nand get out of bed and\ndo things that i wasn't able to do\nbefore like\nyou know take a shower by myself and\nuh self-care by myself and now i can do\nthose things now and\nit was a very difficult journey\nand i'm still i'm still on it and i\ndon't think\ni'll ever be\na normal\nperfect\nhuman\nthat can do whatever but\ni want to return to\nmy normalcy you know something that i\ncan\nsomething that i can be happy with and i\nthink i'm getting there slowly but\nit's been very difficult\nyeah i mean you know mouse i know this\nis going to sound kind of weird but i\nfind myself almost like\ni think if you ever became a completely\nnormal human\ni think a big part of what you give to\nthe rest of the world would be sort of\ntaken away because i think what is is\nmost\nkind of powerful about your story at\nleast to me is that\nyou don't have to be normal to find a\npath\nand and it's sort of this idea that like\nyou don't you know let go of normal\ncompletely and what i've sort of really\nappreciated about your journey is you\nkind of have like leaned into what the\nhand that life has dealt you\nyou know\nand by leaning into the hand that life\ndeals you like paradoxically the whole\nproblem is that we try so hard\nto adhere to a standard\nand that actually doesn't\nthat doesn't\nthat doesn't work\ni don't know where else to put it\nand you know paradoxically what works is\nlike in a sense abandoning that standard\nand just trying to figure out okay like\nwhat am i going to do for myself\nand just going back to this whole thing\nabout no expectations like you know when\ni've worked with kids that have really\nbad behavioral problems like these are\nkids that have been like you know\njuvenile you know they've been in juvie\njail like three times by the age of 15.\nusing drugs and all this other kinds of\nstuff what i tend to find is the most\ncommon\nelement in their life is at some point\npeople stopped expecting anything out of\nthem\nso adults were just sort of like this\nkid is going nowhere and there's no\npoint\nin expecting this child to step up and\naccomplish anything\nand then what happens is is children\nstrive to meet expectations\nand when we give up hope on a kid\nthey're gonna live up to that\nexpectation as well and start living a\nlife that becomes completely hopeless\nbecause that's what we expect of them\nand\nand it's devastating and like\nparadoxically this is why like sometimes\nyou know when i work with kids like that\nwhat i'll actually try to do is give\nthem leadership roles\nand you'll be amazed at how effective\nthat is at getting their behavior in\nline like we sort of think about these\npeople as\nbeing\nincapable\nbut the more responsibility you give\nthem like it's amazing how much they\nstep up but someone has to believe that\nthey can do it\nyeah\ni i you know i i wish uh\ni wish my parents would have been\nmore\nthey were always pretty like hard on me\nbut it was just when things just started\ngetting very\nit was when things got very difficult it\nwas more about\njust me being comfortable and i i know\nthat they love me that they love me and\ni know that they they\nit's just it's such a difficult it's\nsuch it's so difficult i i i feel for\nthem i\ni love my parents so much because it's\nnot easy to be a caretaker and\nuh you know especially having to be\na caretaker for so long to somebody\nwho's been so ill it's very uh hard\nand my parents are very old-fashioned\nand they don't do not believe in uh\nmental health\nuh help\nbecause they're very old and uh they're\nfrom the old world\nso\nthere's a lot of uh they have a lot of\nemotions that uh\nthey have not dealt with uh pertaining\nto\nour family situation and me\nand uh you know i\ni'm just really i'm happy that now i am\ni feel more stable\nin my life that i could be a support\nsystem for them because they've been\nthere for me for so long\nand i just want them to be comfortable\nand it's weird because\nnow i'm the one saying i just want them\nto be comfortable and i just want them\nto be happy and i know that that's what\nthey were saying to me what's weird\nabout that\ni don't know it's so strange it's like\nour roles have been reversed and it's\nsomething that we never expected and i\nnever expected it to happen and they\nnever expected it to happen it's funny\nbecause the other day\nuh my mom uh my parents are you know\nthey're getting older and uh their\nhealth is not great\nand it's really affecting me emotionally\nbecause\ni just remember seeing them young and uh\nbeing so strong and helping me and now\nthey are very old and\nuh\nit's like my mom still kind of wants to\ntake care of me but she's realizing that\ni'm i'm a little bit more independent\nnow and\ni'm i'm actually like getting better so\nshe doesn't really know what to do\nbecause my mom has been like a\nprofessional mother for so long yeah\nshe's you know she's she's she's always\nhad\nto take care of me\nso now that i'm you know it's so strange\nthat like she's like i can't believe\nlike\nyou essentially you have a job now and\nyou're working and you're making money\nand it's just things that they just\nnever expected to see out of me that\nthey're just very\nshocked but also they don't really know\nhow to deal with it and sometimes\nyou know they they just don't know what\nto do\nyeah what about you do you know what to\ndo\nuh i don't i don't even know what to do\ni'm still trying to figure it out uh you\nknow i i just want i you know i just\ni'm just very thankful for everything\nthat they've done for me and i just want\nto\ntake care of them and they want to be\nthere for them and\nlove them like they love me even though\nyou know we went through a lot of hard\ntimes\nyou know\nyeah\nso\nlet me think about this for a second\nokay\ncan i share some thoughts\nyeah\nso the first is like you're gonna take\ncare like so\nin families in general\num so i'm gonna just talk about families\nin general okay we don't need to go too\nmuch into detail about your family and\nstuff is that okay\nyeah yeah that's okay\nso in general like\nwhat we do is what we're taught or what\nwe're shown really more so than taught\num and so i think that like you know in\nyour family what i'm hearing is that\nthere were very clear roles there was\nlike a very lopsided like caretaker and\ncare\nreceiver\nyeah right and and so\nthis is a challenge for for basically\nall families and all parents but at some\npoint as your kids grow up like\nsometimes people will just flip\nand you'll you know the person who used\nto take care of people\nare are now being taken care of but a\nlot of times what really has to happen\nin healthy relationships is we have to\nsort of almost become like colleagues or\nat the same level as our parents\nwhere there isn't really like a and that\njust may be foreign because for such a\nlong time you've needed to be taken care\nof and is it beautifully said by the way\nthat your mom is a professional mother\nright like so she needed to be like a\nlevel 100 mother like you couldn't be a\nlevel 25 mother like you got to leave\nthe noob zone and start being like you\nknow\nserious like end game mom content kind\nof stuff i don't even know what that is\nbut it feels right\nright she's man she's been at it for a\nlong time it's the only thing she never\nknows she's been grinding right she's\nbeen like\nyeah it's adorable\nand\ni i love her for it and it's also very\nfrustrating yeah\nbecause i wanted to relax and i just\nwanted her to to you know to enjoy a\nlife but she's like i i don't know what\nto do i don't know what to do what do i\ndo how do i take care of you and i'm\nlike you don't have to\nyou don't have to do it much anymore\nyou're right and and so it's confusing\nbecause for her it's like she's been\ndoing this for so long she doesn't know\nhow to do anything else\nyeah you know\nand so i think it's like i'm not\nsurprised that you just want them to be\ncomfortable because like when when\nthey're people that you love you know so\nwhen your parents loved you i mean they\nstill do obviously but you know when\nwhen you were growing up they they\ndemonstrated like you kind of like in\nyour family dynamic what i'm sort of\nhearing is that taking care of someone\nand loving them go hand in hand right\nthat's how you demonstrate your love is\nby taking care of them and so now it's\nkind of confusing because if you don't\nneed to be taken care of it's like how\ndoes mom show you that she loves you and\nfurthermore how do you show your parents\nthat you love them without like taking\ncare of them because that's what you do\nand if they're getting older you know\nthat's what you sort of should do and\nstuff if you believe in that kind of\nthing which it sounds like that's great\ni did\ni i think the other thing that we got to\nbe a little bit careful about i think\nand i'm just going to mention this that\nwe don't have to go into it um but i i\nthink it's just in in terms of your\njourney mouse i think that like\ndeveloping a healthy relationship with\nanger is probably very important going\nforward\num and so i don't want to ask you too\nmany questions about it but in terms of\nfeeling like you know we're here to\neducate and we're here to help i'd love\nto share just a couple of general\nprinciples about anger is that okay\nyeah\nso the first is that\nit's clear to me that you love your\nparents it's clear to me that you're\ngrateful for what your parents have\ngiven you fair\nyes\nso when we love people and we're\ngrateful for what they've given us\nsometimes it can be very confusing to be\nangry with them does that make sense\nyes\nand so it can feel\nespecially if we have like\nproblems with low self-esteem or feeling\nguilty\nanger is the hardest thing to sit with\nbecause if you feel angry with your\nparents i'm just talking hypothetically\nor this is more general education for\neveryone okay so if we like think about\nit like if i feel like i've got\nyou know if i have like so here here you\nare and we're hypothesizing here because\nwe're not going to actually ask you but\nyou know here you are growing up you see\nwhat impact your health is having on\nyour parents you recognize that like oh\nit's my responsibility to get better and\ni'm putting them through all this kind\nof stuff and why can't i get better why\ncan't i be healthy and so you start to\nfeel guilty for not being healthy and\nthen if you feel guilty\nlike getting angry with them doesn't\nwork right you're not gonna like let\nyourself do that\nso oftentimes what we see in these kinds\nof like caregiver care receiver\nrelationships\nis that anger is like absent from this\nkind of relationship\nsimilarly your parents aren't allowed to\nbe angry with you and you're not allowed\nto be angry with them does that make\nsense\nyes because they surely like oh poor\nmouse is like so sick like you know\nlike we can't be angry with her like\nthat's not fair\nbut but like let's\nthis we're gonna hypothesize a little\nbit but let's be clear like if you're a\nkid\nyou're gonna do some things that piss\nyour parents off\nand if they're parents they're gonna do\nsome things that piss you off like\nthat's part of the relationship right\nyep\nbut the problem is that when we have\nthese kind of caregiver care receiver\nrelationships we don't allow ourselves\nto be angry with it because that feels\nbad right it's like\nit's like what what kind of [ __ ]\nparent am i going to be like here my kid\nis with this autoimmune deficiency and\ni'm getting pissed at them for not\ncleaning up their toys\nright like oh i should be like more\nforgiving and stuff and so in a weird\nway\ni think over time i think you're going\nto get there on your own i don't think\nyou really need any help with this and\nwe don't need to force this or anything\nlike that but i i just want to say i\nthink it's okay for you to just as\nyou've come to accept\nsadness you've come to accept so uh you\nknow guilt you've come to accept like\nyou know some self-esteem problems and\nstuff like that like i think you you own\nthat really well\ni think it's okay for you and anyone\nelse out there to also own anger like\nanger doesn't mean an absence of love\nanger doesn't mean\nyou know like there can be anger in\nthere and there's a healthy way to to\nsort of have it there and the first is\nto like not blame yourself for being\nangry or your parents to be angry with\nyou and and stuff like that like\nyou know i think anger is is like it's\nokay like it doesn't make you a bad\nperson this is i guess what i mean to\nsay and this is what i really want to\nshare with you is i don't think you're a\nbad person it doesn't make you a bad\nperson if you're angry with yourself if\nyou're angry with your friends if you're\nangry with your parents like it doesn't\nmake you a bad person it's just part of\nlike the experience of life like\nwhat do you think about that\ni think it's like it's so hard for me to\nex to accept uh\nanger i don't know i i have such an\naversion to it like it's funny because\nit's like i could\ni could be on my stream and i could like\nfake rage\nit's not even fake rage it's like it's\nlike i'm mad at a game but like to be\nangry with myself or to be angry towards\nanother human it really bothers me and\nit\nmakes me feel kind of sick inside\nand it scares me it's an emotion that\nreally\nterrifies me for some reason uh and i\ndon't really know why but\nit is\nand uh\nit's why most of the time i i whenever i\nexpress that i'm unhappy with something\ni usually say oh i'm upset i hate saying\ni'm angry i hate\nexpressing anger it\njust doesn't feel right to me\nbut uh i'm trying to learn that it's\nnormal and i'm trying to\nnormalize it in my life\nbut it's difficult\nyeah so uh mouse this is where i\ni want you to please think about the\nquestion that i'm going to ask you for\nabout five to six seconds before you\nanswer\nso\nfirst of all do you want to talk about\nthis at all secondly do you want to talk\nabout this in a more personal way and\nthirdly do you want to talk about it in\na more general way\nuh we could talk about it in a general\nway perfect\nokay so let's try to understand this is\nit okay if i i'm gonna ask you a couple\nlike more academic questions so we're\ngoing to enter i'm going to put on my\nprofessor hat as dr k is that okay\nyeah so it's not going to be personal so\nwhat do you think it is that makes\npeople so you mentioned that you\nsometimes get really uncomfortable\naround anger and you're almost scared of\nit does that make sense\nyeah what makes people uncomfortable\nwith emotions or scared of emotions\ni'm not really sure\nso let's so i think that's because let's\nstep out of your head for a second\nso like let's say that\ni'm scared of love like oh my god i met\nthis person at work and like they make\nme feel this way\ni'm so frightened\ni'm scared of love why do you think that\nis\noh i don't know because\nthey don't they don't wanna\ni don't know\ni don't know so so\nsorry i i may have set you up to fail\nthere but\num so so this is where you know i think\nthe simplest reason that people are are\nafraid of things is because they're just\nlike inexperienced with them\nyeah\nright so like that's the number one\nreason so if you even if you think about\nyou know i remember when\ni was spending some time with some\nfamily in india many years ago and like\npeople in india that my my family\nmembers were like quite racist towards\nparticular ethnicities and then like it\ni realized after talking to them that\nyou know the reason that they have these\nbeliefs is just because they have no\nexperience with like people of these\nethnicities like in india you just you\nknow you've got some white people but\nbasically everyone is like indian\nand and\nso you know i think there's just there's\njust a lack of like experience or\nfamiliarity that makes you scared\num and i i can't imagine also that if\nyou kind of think about it like in your\nhousehold kind of growing up that people\nwho tend to be uncomfortable with anger\ngrow up in places where we're not like\ntaught how to deal with it so we're\ntaught how to deal with sadness there\nare displays of sadness\num things like that but you know i think\nit's like okay for you to feel afraid in\ngeneral it's okay for people to be\nafraid of anger for a couple reasons one\nis because anger oftentimes causes us to\nlose control\nand sadness and stuff does as well it\njust sounds like you're kind of like\nyour sadness resistance is pretty high\nyou know\ni mean it's it's it's funny because like\nwhen i told people that i was gonna come\non\nhere they're like oh you're gonna cry so\nhard you're gonna cry so much\nand uh\ni i i'm a very strange person because i\ni can be pretty emotional\nuh but when it just depends on the\nsituation and sometimes\nwhen i talk about\nreflecting upon my life and reflecting\nupon experiences\nsometimes\nuh i do this thing because i'm so\ni\nokay\ni'm gonna expose myself for a second\nyes i'm emotional and i am aware that i\ncould be emotional uh of course i got it\nfrom my parents\nbut uh\num i think there was a moment in my life\nwhere i would cry all the time i i\nremember\nthere was a long period of my life where\ni spent\nevery day of my life crying\nand uh\ni didn't like that period of my life\nand then i went through a period of my\nlife where i had no emotion at all after\nall that it was almost as if uh my brain\nwas trying to protect me yeah like a\nprotective numbness yeah i couldn't take\nany more sadness and i couldn't take any\nmore emotion i felt like i i was it was\ngonna destroy me so i went a period of\nmy life without feeling anything i was\nlike a zombie\nand i slowly started gaining\nmyself again through streaming and\ni've cried on stream multiple times but\nsometimes there's moments where it's\nlike especially if i feel like i'm\ntalking about something particularly\ndeep about myself and about my life\nit's almost as if i go out of my body\nand i like talk about it as if i'm not\nin it\nand i'm like observing and\nsometimes\nit's me talking\nbut it doesn't necessarily like i can't\ncontrol what i'm saying because i'm at a\ndistance where it's like\ni'm trying so hard to control my\nemotions so that i don't cry\nthat uh i'm not controlling what i'm\nsaying and\ni don't know if that makes sense that\nprobably doesn't\ni don't know no i think it makes a lot\nof sense\ni'm not on autopilot because i i i am\naware but\ni um\nsometimes when i talk about things like\nthis\ni have this fear that if i start crying\ni'm not gonna stop crying\nso\ni\ndon't want to cry yeah of course\ni just rather laugh\nand then i'll cry later\nyep\nyeah no i think that makes a lot of\nsense so\num let's just try to understand that\ntogether is that okay\nyeah\nso i think the first thing is that\nyou know when we learn\nthat emotions\ntake control of us we develop systems to\nnot lose control\nyeah\nand one of those symptoms uh one of\nthose uh systems\nalmost sounds a little bit like\ndissociation have you heard that term\nbefore yes\nwhat's your understanding of that term\nuh when i disassociate\nus\nand uh it's almost as if i the way that\nit was explained to me is uh i'll face\nsomething that's uh rather\ntraumatic i have a lot of trouble\nbecause of the things that happen in my\nlife\nand sometimes i sort of lose myself and\nmy thoughts and\ni tend not to\nfocus in order to\nretreat into myself or out of myself\nso that i'm not really present\nin the moment\nas much as i should be\nuh\nyeah so that that's where i i think so\nyou know this is where we know that for\nexample like through research of you\nknow mental health and mental illness\nand trauma and stuff like that we know\nthat the dissociation response\ncan be protective in nature\nand it's basically like\nyou know if the emotions are too much\nfor us to handle our mind will kind of\nseparate ourselves from it\nand and i've i've worked with a fair\nnumber of people who you know even\nparticular moments in time where they'll\nthey really need to dissociate to\nprotect themselves and generally\nspeaking it's like a protective\nmechanism is the way that i think about\nit the other really interesting thing\nmouse is that um\nso\nwhen i was training to become a\npsychiatrist it was kind of strange\nbecause out of all of my colleagues in a\nsense i was the best\nat being able to understand\nuh people's experience with dissociation\nso like when when we would do like work\nwith patients and stuff and what i\nrealized is like actually that this\nwhat they were describing reminded me a\nlot of meditation\nthat in meditation what happens is the\nawareness separates from the mind\nand if we really think about\ndissociation it's like you can you sort\nof said that you lose control of your\nmind right you're kind of like on\nautopilot but it doesn't hurt you\nanymore does that make sense\nyeah it's strange because like i'm aware\nof what i'm saying and stuff i just\nuh i i'm just\nvery aware that uh at any moment\ni could cry and if i do cry i won't stop\ncrying\nso i don't want to cry so i'm\nhere but i'm here in a different way\ni don't know if that even makes sense no\nit is so so i think what what happens\nthere is that\nwhat's so i this is gonna speaking of\nnot making sense now it's my turn to not\nmake sense\nso we have we have consciousness and we\nhave mental activity and those are\nactually two separate things\nso my ability to\nthink\nand my ability to like observe are\nactually like two different things\nbecause we can observe our thoughts\nright so there's like there within our\nmind there's like a watcher\nand then there's or not even within our\nmind actually outside of our mind\nthere's like a watcher\nand even if we look at\nuh for example mental illness what we\ntend to find is that the more that you\nlose yourself in your thoughts the\ncloser you get to mental illness\nso\nif i'm able to reflect on my thoughts\nand recognize that my thoughts are not\nreal they're just thoughts that's sort\nof healthy does that make sense\nlike if i'm feeling anxious like my mind\nmay think oh my god everyone is annoyed\nthat i'm here but that's not actually\ntrue does that sort of make sense\nbut the more that we start believing\nthat the more that we move towards\nmental illness\nso if we think about someone who has\nlike psychotic delusions\nthis is a person whose thoughts and\nreality have no difference whatsoever\nbecause they 100 believe they're being\npossessed by the devil\nthen what happens is as we like get\nhealthier so even like the most severe\nkind of depression is called a psychotic\ndepression so that's the point at which\nlike their thoughts become reality\nand then like as we get less depressed\nwe start to separate out we still have\nreally powerful thoughts we have\npowerful emotions but we're able to\nacknowledge that our thoughts are like\ndistorted in some way\nso then there's separation from like\nmind and awareness does that make sense\nuh a little bit yeah okay\nif it doesn't make sense please let me\nknow\nit kind of does yeah and and then as we\nget sort of healthier like we're able to\nsort of see like oh my mind isn't really\nthinking clearly so this is where we\ntalk about things like cognitive\ndistortions or cognitive biases\nor sometimes i think the best example is\nlike sometimes you'll have people that\nafter a breakup they're like oh my god\nthe world is ending i'll never love\nagain like this relationship was\neverything to me i'm worthless i'm\nuseless there's no point in living life\nand then six months later they're like\noh my god that relationship was the\nworst thing that ever happened to me i'm\nso glad i really dodged a bullet there\nand so even if you kind of think about\nit there's like there's a certain amount\nof awareness\nthat we don't have when we're kind of\nlike\none with our thoughts does that make\nsense\nuh yeah kinda\nkind of okay yeah and so\nmy point here is that you know when you\nhave these experiences where you kind of\nlike don't you don't want to lose\nyourself in your mind right so then what\nhappens is you kind of separate out from\nthe mind and you kind of like\nare able to see it but then you kind of\nlike retain some control\ndoes that\nsort of make sense\nyeah kind of okay\ni'm dying\nthat's okay it's it's kind of weird\nyeah what i'm saying i mean a lot of\nwhat i'm saying this is kind of a\nroundabout way of saying have you\npracticed meditation before\nuh\ni\ni never it's so weird because like i i\ni never have\nuh but i do recall sometimes\nin the past with my parents like you\nknow\nuh they they'll bring like their prayer\ncircle over and they'll do\nuh these uh long prayer sessions where\nyou know\ni would have to be silent for a long\ntime and they would be around and\ni feel like in a way that was like a\nform of it kind of\nuh so sometimes i just think about that\ntime when i'm very very stressed and\ni just try to\nquiet myself but i've never like\nformally done any sort of meditation i\nthink i'm kind of like afraid\nwhat are you afraid of with meditation\ni don't know i'm just always afraid of\nlike\nbeing overwhelmed with\nmy stuff\nbecause i feel like\nuh\ni've always gotten you know people tell\nme oh you're so you're so like uh\nyou know how to like verbalize what\nyou're feeling so well and stuff but\nit's like\ni feel like\nuh i only take things\ni spent so much in my life\nbeing bombarded with garbage and with\nhorrific experiences\nthat i have\ntrauma and\nnow\ni don't\ni try not to uh oh i'm sorry\ngive me a second\ni'm so sorry\nit's okay\nuh\ni i don't know uh\ni try to take things\nin small amounts because i feel like if\ni try to work on everything at once\nit'll be too overwhelming for me\nand it scares me\nyeah no i i think that that's something\nthat you should respect so\nhere's the thing so i think\nmouse i think you've\nhow can i say this\nso your internal landscape\nhas like rough patches does that make\nsense\nyeah\nright no i i am very much aware\nand and so so what i get the sense of is\nlike in your internal landscape i'm\nalmost like envisioning like colonizing\nmars\nwhere like you've you've sent like\nexpeditions where you've built these\nhabitats that have greenery and like\nyou know like you've you built places on\nmars that you can exist safely in\nfunction but then there's also like the\nwalls of the city and like outside is\nlike the titans and we don't go there\nyeah\nright and yeah\nand so this is this is the the\ninteresting thing so when i work with\npeople who have a history of of trauma\nwhat i'll actually do is be very careful\nabout meditation\nbecause here's the thing when when we\nhave trauma what our mind does is it\nputs up all these walls to keep the\ntitans out\nand what meditation does is bring those\nwalls down\nyes and they're very afraid right so so\ni think that's where there's even\nspecific kinds of meditations that are\nspecifically geared towards people with\ntrauma\nbut the whole point is like in\nmeditation we become one with ourselves\nand like the barriers of the mind get\nbroken down and we like achieve these\nhigh levels of consciousness and like\ntranscend the mind and like all this\ncool stuff men\nbut the whole point is like in trauma\nour bodies like no no our mind is like\nlet's put up these walls let's keep the\ntitans at bay don't knock the walls down\nand so sometimes what i found\nis is i mean i not so much in my\npersonal practice but when i work with\npeople who have meditated with other\npeople\nwhat we found is that when you create a\nvacuum in the mind the trauma can come\nup and then you can lose control\nyeah so so i think it's actually\ncompletely healthy in a sense\nfor you to be wary of meditation i would\ntrust your instincts\nbecause your mind is going to be sending\nyou information and it's like we're not\nready for those titans and like there's\nan anger titan out there\nbut i think over time the one thing that\ni did want to share with you is i think\nwhen you're ready for it i think that\nyou will find\nthat you are an adept meditator\nand that a lot of what you've\nessentially stumbled through or work\nthrough at some point meditation may\nhelp you do\nbetter\nbut\nbut not necessarily not yet if you're\nnot ready you don't have to rush it\ni i have like a lot of like um\nuh\naversions to rushing into stuff like\nthat because\nit's just a lot yeah and\nit's a lot it's a lot and i feel like\ni've slowly been working on things but\nit's just very difficult um\nbecause\nat the same time as much as i've\nimproved a lot and i feel like a lot of\naspects of my life has improved i'm\nstill kind of going through it and going\nthrough the motions it's like even more\nstuff\nbut then i have to like go through stuff\nthat's happening now and then deal with\nstuff that happened before and it's just\nlike\ni'm not ready so yeah 100 so mouse can i\ngive you just one piece of like\nsupporting\nadvice\nso so there's there's\none general thing that i tend to think\nabout in terms of like whether you need\nto confront your problems or not right\nbecause everyone's like so like many\nyears ago you were at this point where\nyou're like i'm tired of being lonely i\ni'm tired of having no one have having\nexpectations about me and like i'm gonna\ndo something with my life i'm not\ncontent with the way of things and you\nstarted to like make a change in your\nlife right with me yeah yeah so when do\nyou need to do that when do you need to\nsit down and grapple with yourself and\nlike wrestle with yourself and like send\nexpeditions beyond the wall like when do\nwe need to send expeditions beyond the\nwall\nwell that depends on how things are\ngoing on the inside\nso if the trajectory of your life is\nmoving in the right direction you don't\nneed to go sending things beyond the\nwall\nso what i'm hearing from you is that\nyour life like you're you're growing as\na person you're like you know you've\ndiscovered\nbeing a v tuber you've discovered this\nawesome community your health is getting\na little bit better you're working at it\nyou're like making friends you're\nfeeling less lonely feeling good about\nyourself like you know learning how to\nbe with your parents in a different way\ntaking care of them so the direction\nthat you're moving in is positive right\nfair yeah okay so if it is don't mess\nwith it\ndon't\nyou don't need to go confronting anger\nor any of this other stuff like you know\nyou can just let sleeping dogs lie for\nnow and if at some point you find that\nyou're unsatisfied with the direction of\nyour life or if you feel like there's a\nparticular bottleneck like so for\nexample like if you're unable to trust\nor unable to love or like unable to like\nyou know if all this weird anger\nsuppression crap is like causing\nproblems in your relationships or things\nlike that that's when you need to go\nsend an expedition beyond the wall\nbut for now it sounds like you're you\nknow you're on your journey and it's\nmoving in the right direction so like i\nwouldn't rock the boat\nyeah\n[Music]\ni feel like uh\ni might have to start\nhaving an expedition soon because\nuh i i have realized that uh\ndue to past trouble and stuff like that\nuh i do as much as i love making friends\nand uh i've said this on my stream\nbefore that um\ni am uh\ni am a\nextrovert that has been forced to live\nan introvert's life and it really it\nreally like took a toll on me mentally\nand emotionally\nthat uh\ni i i think like all those things\ncombined and the fact that i had to like\nchange my my lifestyle and stuff i have\na little bit of an issue with trust when\nit comes to meeting new people\nand\nit's a little bit of a block and\nit's something that in the future i'm\nnot really ready to work on it yet\nbut i'm i'm meeting\npeople certain individuals in my life\nthat i\nreally respect them and\ni have begun to care about them a lot\nand i want to begin to start trusting\nbecause\ni want to be able to\nuh\ni want to be able to\nshare\nmyself more with them and\nshare more about what i've been through\nin my life and\nbe more open so that they can understand\nme better and understand why i am the\nway i am\nand uh\ni i don't think i'm ready quite yet but\ni know that i'm gonna have to face it\neventually because\nit's just i'm getting closer to people\nand they're just some people that\nuh i feel like if i continue to get\ncloser to them\nit's harder for me\nto communicate with them and i don't\nreally want to have that sort of block\nwhen the time comes you know i don't\neven know if this makes sense i think it\nmakes a lot of sense do you want do you\nwant me to tell you what i heard what\ndid you hear\nso the first thing is i was like it's\nokay mouse you don't have to confront\nyour anger you don't need to send\nexpeditions and you're like well\nactually\nactually\nmaybe we're coming up on the time where\nwe need to send this in an expedition\nyeah so that that's good because that's\nyour internal voice kind of telling you\nokay like maybe we do need to deal with\nthis stuff but here's here's what i\nwould really think about mouse is that\nso if we think about what makes it hard\nfor you to open up and trust people do\nyou have a sense of that\nuh\nit's\nit's hard to explain because there's so\nmany different like reasons\nbut um\nokay uh i think my main reason is\nthis is gonna sound kind of\n[ __ ] up\nbut um\nbecause of the fact that i never had any\nexpectations on me\nto a certain point\nuh i was also very much aware uh\nand was very much\nas much as my parents my parents love me\nso much and they care about me\nbut they were also very\nopen with sharing with me\nthat uh being close to people with\nmy condition\nuh me\nhaving to live the life that i live\nit's very stressful on others and it's\nvery difficult\nand that uh kind of made me have trust\nissues because\nuh\nthey were telling me they told me but\nalso it's a conclusion that i came to\nmyself as well where it's like\nit takes a lot to be\nclose to me it takes a lot to\nuh be able to share\nstuff because i feel like\noh man this is gonna be difficult to say\nand this is where i probably make my\nuh\nit's just i just uh\ni have issues where i feel like\npeople won't want to\nuh\ngo through the links that\nis required in order to get close to me\nand uh\npeople will\nbelieve and\num\ni've experienced in the past people that\ni used to be close to\nand uh when\nuh [ __ ] gets hard\nand uh\ntheir my life is very uncertain\nuh i've had people\nstop coming around and stop checking in\nchecking up on me and uh\nit's i know that it's very emotionally\ndraining and it's a lot of stress and a\nlot of strain\nand it's something in my heart and in my\nmind that i said\ni will never force anyone to\nuh\ngo through\nuh the pain of being my friend\nuh i would i would never\nforce that upon anybody\nuh because i am aware that it's\nvery stressful and it's a lot\nso i in turn am afraid of trusting\npeople because i'm just afraid that\nif i do get close to somebody and i do\ngive them\nthe trust and tell them hey\nso this is what's going on this is\nwhat's wrong with me this is what i've\nbeen through\nuh\ni'm afraid they're just gonna be like\nyikes\nno thank\nyou don't know if that means anything if\nthat means yeah i think that's that\nmeans a lot but and this is going to\nsound kind of weird respectfully i\ndisagree\ni know\ni i figured you would do you know what i\ndisagree with\nwhat do you disagree with i disagree\nwith so here's the thing\nso there you are being considerate right\nbecause you're like oh my god being\nfriends with mouse is hard\nso i'm not gonna hold anyone to that\nexpectation\nright which is like you being a\ncompassionate person you're like\nwell how can i ask anyone to sign up to\ndeal with me\nright i could never\nthat's gotta change you\noh you should absol absolutely man\nlike i know it's you don't have to do it\ntoday\nbut at some point\nto be blunt\nthat's the price that people need to pay\nfor being your friend and you need to be\nokay with having people pay that price\nbecause here's the wild thing\nyou're worth it\nright like it's okay\nfor\nlike you're so just because your life\nmakes other people being being friends\nwith you makes other people's lives\nharder that's actually okay\nokay right i i you may not be able to\nlet that sink in now but that's that's\npart of life like we don't\nyou know the people that we're friends\nwith\nare not people because they just make\nour life like net positive\nright that's not what friendship is\nyeah it's\nit's like yeah you know like part of\nand this is where i mean i sort of get\nit right because you don't want to put\nanyone through that but the whole point\nis that\nyou know i get that\nbut also like\nyou know that's okay\nlike that's something that\nyou know don't don't make the same\nmistake with people that people made\nwith you which is like don't hold them\nto any expectations\nlike just because\nyou're sick and we talked about how\nalmost damaging it is for people like\ngive up hope on what you're capable of\nand that's also where like if you give\nup hope on what people are capable of\nthen you're never gonna give them a\nchance to like show you that you kind of\nlike are worth it you know\nwell man but that's it's gonna be hard\ndon't get me wrong\nit's gonna be terrifying\noh god yeah i know right so like it's\ngonna be hard to like like approach\nsomeone and be like yeah you know my\nlife is [ __ ] right now it's gonna be\nvery emotionally draining but you owe me\nthis [ __ ]\ni had a friend of mine basically be like\nwhy not just just trust me it's fine i'm\ni'm okay i can handle it and i'm like\ni don't know and they're like you need\nto stop\ni'm willing to go through this i'm okay\nand i'm i'm still in my head i'm just\nlike\noh god they're gonna\nyeah so\nthat's where you know that person also\nneeds to understand and both y'all need\nto understand when they say i can handle\nit like they may not be able to\nbut this is the important thing\nhandling it doesn't mean\nlike that shouldn't be the\nthe whole point of being friends with\nsomeone and like loving someone is that\nyou share with things them [ __ ] that\nthey can't handle but like that's okay\nlike that\nthe prerequisite shouldn't be whether\nthey can handle it or not the\nprerequisite should be like you're just\nsharing it if they can't handle it like\nthat's okay like that's just what life\nis right you don't you're not always\nable to handle everything\nyeah\ni know i know it's kind of weird but\nyou'll get there\ni want to get there eventually yeah\nyou'll get there just go slow don't\ndon't don't send everyone beyond the\nwall it's dangerous out there\nyeah no you'll get eaten by the titans\ndude\nthey'll just have their like manic grins\nwhile they stuff you into their mouth\nand just gobbling you know\nbut but i think at some point like\nyou know i i get that it's terrifying\nthe other thing that i'd just like to\nshare with you is i i wonder how much of\nit's\nyou know you've mentioned that you've\nlost control in the past and so i i\nwonder\nhow much of it's hard for you to trust\nother people\nactually because you're afraid that like\nif you cross a particular line with them\nyou'll lose control\nand then you'll be subjecting them to\nall of the crap\nyou know and you don't want to do that\nto them\nno\nwhich is\nwhere i say gently [ __ ] him let him have\nit\nit's just it's just like this thing\nbecause it's like\nmy whole life i felt like a burden to my\nfamily that like\ni feel like i'm a burden to people yeah\nand anyone in the world\ngo for it\nthat's that's that's the whole point of\nbeing friends with someone oh god\nright like\nlike friendship the whole point of\nfriendship is that it's not like a\nyou know it's not like a net positive\ninteraction in that way like that's not\nfriendship is is about\nyou know like\nyou know go for it\nit's okay\ni mean i know it doesn't feel that way\nbut anyway\nfriendship is not about people like\njust making your life better in terms of\nlike money and happiness and stuff like\nthat the whole point is that\nyou know you're you're going to be a\nburden to people like that's okay and\nlike people sign up for that and that's\nwhat you do as someone's friend\nright lane like think about like the\nreverse position and then i'll stop\ntalking but\nyou know if someone was a burden to you\nlike how would you would you be like oh\nman like you're such a burden to me like\nno i'm not gonna see you anymore\nah i could never absolutely\nand that's where like feeling loved and\nfeeling accepted\nmouse you gotta give people the chance\nand here's the thing if all you ever do\nso i was working with someone who was\nvery wealthy\nand like the problem is that when you're\nvery wealthy like you don't know if\npeople are friends with you because of\nyour wealth or because of like you right\nmakes sense\nbut here's the thing if all you ever\ngive your friends is just like the\npositive version of you and you never\nburden them\nhow are you ever gonna know like who\nthey accept\nthat's true\nright so you gotta\nyou gotta give them the scuffed version\nand then like oh god\nand and then like that's when you're\nreally going to feel loved because like\nwhen you're scuffed and there are people\nlike yeah i'll take it anyway\nyeah i'm really scuffed\nright but if you if all you give people\nis polish like you're they're you're\nnever going to give them a chance to\naccept you\nyou go god yeah i i get that you're\nterrified which is fine like you don't\nneed to force yourself into it i'm just\nletting you know for when that day comes\nlike you know\nwe're all scuffed\nthat's true\nyes sorry\noh my god i'm internally like freaking\nout now yeah sorry about that\nit's okay it's okay this is good no no i\nmean i i i yeah i mean\ni'm not really sorry but i i should feel\nsorry i felt like the right thing to say\nno it's good it's good i'm i'm excited\nfor you personally like i'm not i don't\nfeel regret honestly i feel excited i\nfeel hopeful\num\ni feel like\nsomewhere along the way\ni think what you really have to give is\ndifferent from what you think you have\nto give which obviously makes me a dumb\nass because you know better your life\nthan i do but i think part of what\nyou've demonstrated through what you've\ndone as a vtuber is that when you\nauthentically share a piece of yourself\nthat\nis a little bit scuffed is a little bit\nmessed up that's actually what causes\npeople to respond to you right because\nso many of your experiences about being\nan outsider you didn't show up and start\nsaying like oh my god i'm such an\nawesome person and i have so many\nfriends no it's like i'm an outsider i'm\nsick i can't live a regular life\nyou know sucks to be me i'm a i'm gonna\ndo the best that i can but i can't make\nany promises that it's gonna be perfect\nand and that's interestingly enough\nwhat's so damn authentic and like what\nis so damn engaging for people\nwell thank you\ni say that every day when i wake up i\njust say i just want to do my best\nthat's all that's all i want to do\nthat's really what you owe people you\ndon't owe people a good job what you owe\npeople is doing your best\nand and i really hope for you that at\nsome point in the future you're able to\nhave friends\nwho can accept you for doing your best\ninstead of doing a good job\nthey already do it's just i i\nhave to accept that they do yeah that's\non you dude it's not\ni also just i have wonderful friends now\nthat they that they\nthey're just so\ni always get surprised at the kindness\nthat i received because i just don't\nexpect people to\nbe kind and i don't expect people to be\nso\nso nice to me\nand like even even um\neven so i i belong to a company called\nvisjojo as a youtuber company uh with\nother girls\nand uh even even a ceo uh who's our boss\nhe's so nice to me and it it just blows\nmy mind that uh\npeople are so nice and even though\nyou know they\nthey know me and they learn about me\nthat\nthey're still so kind to me and\nthey're just willing to help me and\nthey they just want they just want to be\nmy friend and it's\nit blows my mind that anybody\nwould ever want that uh with me because\ni just uh i never felt like i was uh\ngood enough or worthy enough to have\nfriends and to have a life\nand i'm just still trying to come to\ngrips with\nthat right now that's it's\nit's uh it's hard i'm i'm i feel like\ni'm coming to terms with it now\nbut it's just it's just i just never\nexpected any of this to happen\nso it's uh ah\nyou got me [ __ ] no no no i i'm not\ntrying to do anything\ni was i lacked compassion and and\npushed you into\nplaces i didn't do anything\nthis is you dude\ni know\ncan't blame me for this\nnot my fault\noh god\noh no\nyeah so that uh all that that i just\nsaid yeah no i mean i i think it makes\nand that's just where\nyou know i think it's going to be\nconfusing for a while but that's like\nyou know i think\nyeah i i think you just said it well i\nhave nothing to say i got nothing\nyou know it's just it's gonna take a\nlittle little time for you to really so\nhere's here's what i will say okay\nso you know how earlier like\nlike when life was hard and like you\nwere like oh my god like i can't live\nregular life and you had to like accept\nthat\nyeah accepting doom in your life is way\neasier than like accepting that you\ndeserve love it's true accepting that\nyou deserve nothing in life\nand letting go of all your expectations\nis the easy part\naccepting that people\nthat you deserve love despite the fact\nthat your life may not amount to\nanything is like so much harder so i\nthink this is just you know you're just\nat the\nend of elden ring now this is just the\nlast boss\nso it's gonna be tough\nyou're gonna wipe like over and over and\nover again and that's just you know\nat some point you just got to get good\nyou know what i'm saying\noh god yeah i feel like i've been trying\nto get good my whole life yeah dude\ni i hear you\nthat's just that's just life\nhas been rough you can't you can't mimic\ntear your way through everything\nno i wish i could yeah no it's\nyou know\noh god\noh god\n[Music]\nyeah i wish that were the case but it\nisn't you know\ni wish i was\ni always i say\nstuff like that i would say man i wish i\ncould uh\nif only i it could have been this or\nthat or this or that but it's like\ni'm not i'm this yep\nand this is\nokay\nabsolutely right\noh goodness\ni'm not crying i'm not crying either\nlook at my face\ni think if you're crying a little bit\nthat's okay but you know yeah\nit's good it's okay\nyou guys\njust you gotta wipe a few more times\nthat's all yeah you'll get it you'll get\nthere it's just a little dehydration\nit's okay\nwell\noh god\ni\ni think\nare we done\ni\ni feel like this is the end there's no\ni don't know\ni don't know\noh dear\nare you okay\nyeah okay\ni don't\ni feel like this is this is where i\ndon't think we can push past this\nis what i mean to say\nyeah i i feel like i'm i i'm very i feel\nvery exposed right now yeah yeah i mean\nthat's why we have to like because we\ndon't want to keep going you get what\ni'm saying like\nso i think\nyeah i think so\nyeah\noh my god i uh did we overstepped that\nno no not at all not at all because that\nwould be you know\nno no not at all i you know of course\nthere's just things that i just can't\nsay yeah\nyeah\nyeah\ni i you know we're we're good\nwe're good\nokay yeah\nokay well any any last kind of thoughts\nor comments\ni laugh a lot when i'm very nervous and\ni'm very i'm very laughable laughable\ni'm a laughable person\ni'm a laugh person yeah\nthat's\nthat's totally fine\nyeah yeah\ni just want to say that so i won't cry\nmiles thank you so much for coming on\ntoday thank you so much for\nsharing your story i i think um if i can\njust offer like some simple closing\nthoughts i think it's like\nit's really fascinating because\nin so much of life\nwe wear a mask on our\nreal face\nright and we don't actually like\nconnect with people or we don't show\nauthenticity\nand and i think what you've sort of\nmanaged to do is is kind of rediscover\nwho you are through like being a v tuber\nand like connecting with people and\nsharing like so much of your struggles\nwhich i think a lot of people actually\nrelate to especially this stuff of sort\nof being an outsider being denied in a\nsense a regular life\num\nand sort of having to work through some\nof that\nloss of expectation and sort of really\nhaving to work through like okay i can't\nlive a normal life so what am i gonna do\nam i just gonna like you know people\nhave sort of almost given up on you and\nlike even doctors are sort of telling\nyou like our goal is making you\ncomfortable which is which\ni'm sort of hearing you weren't really\nwilling to accept that\nno\nand on the one hand you had to like give\nup on a normal life\nand interestingly enough i think what's\nsort of like really inspiring about that\nis that by giving up on a normal life\nwhat you've really allowed yourself to\ndo is\ncarve a pathway to\nliving your life\nwhich may not be normal but that doesn't\nmean that it isn't wonderful or\nbeautiful in some way\nand and that's really what i'm taking\naway from this conversation\nyeah\n[Music]\nthank you thank you very much you're\nvery welcome thank you very much oh god\nno thank you i appreciate\nthe time with that we talked
