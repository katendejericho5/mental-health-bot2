    "transcript": "you know there's an argument to be made\nthat since we don't use marijuana we\ndon't really understand the benefits and\nwe don't really understand what we're\ntalking about\nhow would you what do you think about\nthat would hate for us as doctors to\nlike recommend something and then all of\na sudden we find out later how bad it is\nand we've seen that being the case for\nopioids let's say i've got depression or\nptsd and people say like oh i you know i\nuse marijuana to cope what do you think\nabout that again you know the studies\nare limited it's very difficult to study\ncannabis in the us it's still a schedule\none driller meaning has high abuse\npotential in the same category as lsd\nyou know if if i'm using a substance\njust at a very high level if i'm using a\nsubstance\nto numb my emotional state my brain's\nability to control and regulate my\nemotional state becomes less necessary\num how do you know if you're kind of\nlike addicted to marijuana or not\nam i is this live or is this still part\nno we're live\nokay\nwe're good to go\nokay so i'm gonna go ahead and switch\nover so people why don't we just start\nuh welcome\nmichael or dr shu how do i how do we\npronounce your last name\nyeah dr shu you um you said it just\nright the first time okay um\nso\nyeah do you want to say a couple quick\nthings up front maybe sure\ni think first of all just a quick\nuh disclaimer for viewers one thing is\nthat um you know i recently joined the\nscientific advisory board of healthy\ngamer didn't want to put that out there\num and i know that's something that\nmight be announced later on this week as\nwell sure um i am\nyou know a physician at brigham women's\nhospital um and part of the harvard\nmedical school sort of residency\ntraining\nprogram here but all the opinions that\ni'm going to put out here are mine\nmind alone\nand um\nyou know i think uh there's a lot uh\nto talk about with cannabis and i think\nthere's\nsort of\nways that people are talking about in\nterms of how it's like a completely\nharmless substance and i think you know\nthat may not that's you know not sort of\na helpful way of thinking about it but\nat the same time\ni might challenge something you said a\nlittle bit earlier too that it's a\ncompletely bad thing\nas well and i think that sort of the\ntruth is probably somewhere in the\nmiddle and sure i hope we can sort of uh\nbe able to\nconverse around that\num today and uh sort of also\nuh acknowledging you know both\nuh both of us are psychiatrists so\nthere's always sort of biases that we\nhave you know going into these things we\nhave biases towards mental health and\nhealth in general um\nyou know some people might have biases\ntowards autonomy or\nfreedom of choice and things like that\nor biases based on personal experience\num\nyet biases based on you know looking to\nevidence of literature which i believe\nis the right thing to do when you're\ntalking about drugs maybe not so much\nspiritual experiences or things like\nthat that don't have sort of the harmful\neffects that drugs could have but\ncertainly when thinking about\nmedications and drugs i think it's\nhelpful to um to do that um and bias is\nbased on obviously personal and\nspiritual experience and i think it's\njust helpful to put out there sort of\nwhat our biases are because without\nacknowledging that arriving at the truth\nmight be a little bit challenging and i\nthink acknowledging all of our violence\nis in it so well said i mean i i think\nwhen i have conversations with people\nabout marijuana oftentimes\nit's interesting you use the word bias\nwhereas i wonder if like value i mean i\nthink there are biases but also like\nthere are differing values so like as\nmental health professionals\nwe're probably going to\nhave a value that health is\nnot i wouldn't say\nactually i i don't think i value\nnecessarily health over autonomy because\nultimately when i work with many\npatients you know it's their choice what\nthey put into their bodies\nbut at the same time i think like you\nsaid i've sort of noticed that sometimes\npeople are kind of coming with a certain\npersonal experience\ni wouldn't quite say agenda but\nsometimes when i work with people who\nuse substances\nthe conversation almost turns into\nlooking for any kind of justification to\nbe able to continue to use the substance\num\nthat's been my experience sometimes with\npeople so i i really appreciate you kind\nof pointing out biases and how people\nare coming at it from different angles\nand so if we're trying to figure out\nwhat's right or not right that we have\nto really consider\nthe personal perspectives of the people\ninvolved and that the right answer for\none person may not be the right answer\nfor someone else\nyeah i think that's that's well said\nand you know i think we all sort of\nvalue autonomy we value health and i\nthink some people might value one\ncertain things over others and i think\nthat's just what yeah yeah exactly\nso uh michael let me just start by so\ncan you just tell us a little bit about\nmarijuana like\nsure just\nin terms of uh\nlike do you want to dive to you want to\ndie for like specific questions or you\nwant to talk generally first what do you\nthink would be better\num\nwell i think one thing\nthat would be helpful to sort of lay out\nthere alphabet is just sort of\ndefinitions and word choice sure um and\ni think it's helpful to think about you\nknow marijuana is such a broad term and\neven like the term medical marijuana can\nsort of be unhelpful because like what\nare we talking about here are we talking\nabout like recreational marijuana that's\nused for medical purposes are we talking\nabout prescribed cannabinoids that are\nused for medical purposes are we using\nare we talking about like medical\nmarijuana cards that we're getting and\nusing for medical purposes so i think\nit's sort of helpful to sort of break\ndown what are the different types of\nsubstances that marijuana contains one\nof the different forms of it and sort of\nhow yeah that would be awesome can you\ntell us that\nyeah so it says marijuana what are the\ndifferent things that that could refer\nto\nsure i mean i think one thing to think\nabout is like first off that there's\nsort of this whole plant version of\ncannabis and that's sort of the\ntraditional\nuh sort of way that we that one might\nsort of inhale or smoke it and you know\nthere's different versions of it um\ncertainly the thing is sort of the most\ncommonly talked about are like sativa or\nindica versions there's other types of\nwhole plants that might include tarpons\nwhich are like oils from like animal or\nplant products that might affect the\naroma or the taste of those products as\nwell and you know these whole plant\ncannabis products i think what a lot of\npeople don't realize is that it contains\nlike\nhundreds of\ncannabinoids in them like hundreds of\nchemicals that\num that are potentially sort of\npsychoactive and so we don't we haven't\nreally scratched the surface in terms of\nwhat many of them do but what the most\ncommon ones that we have been able to\nisolate and do a little bit of research\non are things like delta nine uh thc\nwhich is sort of what we think about in\nterms of thc there's delta eight which\nis sort of less studied and sort of less\navailable and the whole plan as well\nthere's also cbd kind of\ncan have a dial which is sort of\nsomething that's sort of a lot of\nexcitement around\na lot of media attention and things like\nthat around cbd and then you also have\ncannabinol as well which is sort of an\nemerging area so i think it's sort of\nhelpful to think about like whole plants\nand there's different ways to take that\nwhether it be\nsort of inhaled or whether it be through\nedible use or or sort of other means and\nthen you have like these other cannabin\ncannabinoids uh these sort of\nuh compounds that you can sense you can\nsort of uh distill out of\nout of the cannabis products that can be\ncreated or made into drugs that contain\nonly sort of those types of\nuh cannabinoids uh some for example\ndrenavinol also known as marinol is a\nsynthetic form of thc\nepidiolex which is like the only\nuh\nfda approved version of cbd that we have\ncurrently on the market the only one\nthat we've studied um you know that's\num you know that's cbd that's from\nsynthesized so it's kind of helpful to\nthink about\nyou know what are the different products\nyou know cbd can be used in edibles and\nother oils and tinctures and\ni'm happy to get into the weeds of that\nif we need to but i think it's helpful\nso\nmichael let me just ask you this so so\nin terms of when so one of the things\nthat i remember learning when i was in\nresidency is that a lot of the original\nresearch on marijuana was done like 30\nor 40 years ago\nand that there's been like\num basically as marijuana became more of\na controlled substance at least in the\nunited states\nthat the amount of research on it like\nmaybe in the 90s and early 2000s\nbasically like kind of decreased\nsignificantly\nand so one of the takeaways i remember\nhaving through some of my lectures when\ni was learning about this stuff is that\nthe studies that we have on marijuana\nare maybe less applicable now because\nover the last 30 years we've bred\nmore potent strains\nuh concentrated the amount of thc so\nthat even like\nso so in a sense\nthe the effects of marijuana that we\nsort of have well characterized from the\n60s and 70s may not be quite as\napplicable today like can you comment on\nthat or is that kind of your experience\nbecause i'm i i don't keep up too too\nheavily i'm sure not as much as you do\nin terms of marijuana research\nyeah absolutely that's i think that's\nexactly right i mean when people talk\nabout marijuana that's been used for\nthousands of years we think about like\nchina being using it in 2000 bc for\nthings like rheumatoid pain um or other\nsources of pain or even sort of uh\nmental health reasons you know the type\nof cannabis that was naturally growing\nin china or like southern russia like\nhad very little content of like thc and\nyou know we're talking about like less\nthan two or three percent um fast\nforward you know to the 60s or 70s you\nknow people are using\ncannabis pretty widely uh sort of um\naround the streets we might have you\nknow hear people say like back you know\nback in the day people are using all the\ntime it's not super harmful like\nand um using it recreationally and you\nknow even around that time like the thc\naverage content you would found on the\nstreets of somewhere around three to\nfive percent\num fast forward to today and i think a\nlot of this has to do with\num sort of the big industry of cannabis\nand sort of how we see\ntrends in other areas of substance as\nwell in the sense that you know\ntrending towards higher potency and\nhigher use and and sort of desire to\ncreate those products you know a lot of\nuh if you're looking for like for\nexample whole plant cannabis like the\nstuff that people are using in the\nstreets back in the 70s the average\nnowadays is like 20 30\nand certain vapes can even go up and\nother products can go up to 60 90 so\nwe're talking the products that we're\ntalking about today that are people are\nusing and wondering\nif it could be helpful for mental health\npurposes are totally different from the\nthings that you know we were talking\nabout back in those days and so just\ndoing research off of just so to\nmake sure i understood that correctly\nlike so when we're talking about like\n60s and 70s or even like ancient\ncannabis use we're talking thc in the\nyou said two to three percent range\ntwo to three percent a lot of it's sort\nof like hash she should like um\nsort of derive from the natural plant\nitself and a lot of that you know has a\nlot of\ncbd and a higher cbd to thc ratio\npotentially as well\num\nbut you know strains of the higher thc\ncontent have been\nbred and used a lot more commonly\nand less and so you said that the the\nthc\nconcentration now is like 20 to 30 so\nwe're talking about like\na ten-fold increase in potency\nabsolutely yeah and then even in vapes\nand stuff you can you can get a 20-fold\nor 30-fold\nincrease in\nyeah when you get a hit or a dab of that\nand potency\nexactly you're getting\nwhat you're taking in that moment is is\nmuch higher than people were ever sort\nof using in terms of concentration and\nyou said that has to do with the\nindustry can you talk a little bit about\nthat what do you mean by the industry\nyeah i mean there's a lot of sort of\nopinions on this and\nwhy this may be the case but i mean one\nthing\nto think about is\nyou know as\nweed was sort of decriminalized\nand um\nlegalized in many of the states and i\nthink uh people were really like hoping\nthat\nuh sort of these dispensaries could be\nopened by like grassroots and that sort\nof treatment and healing can be taken by\nthe people and there's sort of this\nanti-government even this whole rhetoric\naround that and i think it's kind of uh\nunfortunate that with the legalization\nof medical marijuana on a state estate\nbasis that\na lot of\nthe sort of dispensary licenses that are\nbeing handed out are being given to\nlarge industry cannabis dealers which\nmany of which have been bought out by\ntobacco by big tobacco and big tobacco\nas sort of many of us know are\nincredibly good at marketing they're\nincredibly good at social marketing\nthey're fairly good at like\nyou know\nyou know coming up with ways of sort of\nmitigating sort of the ideas of how\nsomething could be harmful\nand trying to play up some of the ideas\nof how something could be helpful\nand so\ni think that's a part of it and another\npart of it is you know\nuh cannabis use also sort of like it\nfollows demand as well and we see i mean\nwe look at the opioid sort of crisis\nyou know and thinking about like what's\navailable on the streets you know there\nused to be\nyou know a lot of times it used to be\nlike heroin on the streets and then sort\nof drug dealers were realizing that you\nknow if they can increase the potency of\nopioids\non the street the more people will buy\nand then more people will get sort of\nhooked on it and there's also sort of\nthis tolerance that develops on\nopioids as well whereas where like\nthe more you use it the more\nsort of desensitized the receptors in\nyour brain are to using opioids so the\nmore you kind of need in order to get\nthe same effect\nso what drug dealers were realizing is\nthat you know\npeople need higher higher doses and\npotency of opioids and\nand today if you look on the streets\nthere's almost no like heroin at least\nhere in massachusetts it's like mostly\nfentanyl and fentanyl is again by orders\nof like 10 degrees\nor like a higher much higher order\npotency than even heroin was and that's\nwhy part of the reason why we're seeing\na huge increase in overdoses on opioids\nas well and i think you know when\nthinking about\num\nsubstances that where you can develop\ntolerance and substance kids that that\nsort of people are trying to\num either potentially chase a symptom\ndown or chase like a high\nyou know and develop tolerance over time\nthere's going to be a demand for and i\nthink industry kind of knows this and i\nsuspect that the potency in cannabis\nwill get higher higher and that might\nhelp explain it but that's only part of\nthe\npicture yeah so so michael you're kind\nof so if i'm hearing you correctly like\none thing is that as we increase potency\nand\nit's interesting i didn't know that big\ntobacco had purchased a lot first of all\ni didn't know much about the landscape\nof\ncannabis dispensaries and stuff but i\nmean if big tobacco has essentially like\npurchased those and are kind of\ndisseminating them it makes me really\nwonder about as you mentioned they're\ngood at marketing like\nyou know how much of what we hear about\nthe benefits of marijuana and things\nlike that are a result of\nmarketing or other things like that i'm\nalso curious so so as potency kind of\nincreases\nsome people will say that marijuana\ncannot be addictive\num do you have thoughts about that\nyeah i mean we've certainly seen um\ncannabis addiction in our clinics here\nand\nwhat we know about sort of addiction to\ncannabis is that not everyone gets it\nbut uh the more\nthe more you use um thc containing\nproducts typically we're talking about\nlike\neither you know the inhalable versions\nof\nwhole plant cannabis\nor vapes and the more that you use it\nthe more frequently they use it and the\nhigher content of thc\nin these products lends to a higher\nchance that you might develop addiction\nto it and people that do use it\nfrequently say over two or three times a\nweek we see around like 30 percent of\npeople developing an addiction\nto it and i think you sort of\ntalked about a little bit of the\nmechanism of addiction and cannabis on\nthe stream before um yeah why don't you\njust tell us a little bit about that so\nlike like so a lot of people will say\nyou know\num i don't i use marijuana for medical\nreasons\nlike i i you know because it is\nit is decriminalized now you can get\nmedical marijuana cards at least in the\nunited states\nand so like what do you you know how do\nyou tell if someone is using it and\noftentimes people who use it for medical\nreasons won't be it won't be prescribed\nthey'll have never seen a mental health\nprovider they'll sort of say oh i have\nanxiety and like marijuana helps with\nanxiety and that's why i use it\num how do you know if you're kind of\nlike addicted to marijuana or not\noh\ni'm not hearing anything are you all\nhearing anything\ndid we get jim muted somehow\nhello\nsay something hello hello yeah there we\ngo\nkeep going so can you tell us how how\nyou determine if someone's addicted\nsure um\ni mean some of the signs that someone\ncould be potentially\naddicted to cannabis are\none having cravings especially early\nmorning cravings like waking up to\nwanting cannabis as soon as you get up\nthat's a potential sign another is using\ncannabis despite sort of knowing the\nconsequences of it so examples of that\nare like you know i've\npatients who have been using cannabis\nfor a long time and it's impairing their\nwork and as they use cannabis more and\nmore and become more dependent on they\nwere taking more and more risks with\ncannabis like using it right before\nmeetings at work or during meetings even\nor stepping away and knowing that it's\nimpairing their ability to function at\ntheir job\nbut sort of not being able to\ndetermine like be able to make a sort of\ndecision on that and that goes back to\nthe neurobiology of addiction that we\nmake it to at some point but\num\nalso\num\nwhat else\nusing higher and higher doses of it over\ntime\nwhat about like i mean what about people\nwho say like let's say\ni have anxiety at work\nand i find that\nyou know actually like\nusing marijuana at work like helps me\nperform better in a meeting\nokay so\ni think it really depends again on this\nwhat we're talking about when we're\ntalking cannabis\nin this moment so\nyou know we know that there's some\nevidence that sort of\num cbd or higher cbd ratio\nuh cannabis products or even sort of\num\nsort of the newer kind of cannabis\nproducts are using kind of this\nentourage effect of various different\nterpenes and cannabis products to sort\nof lower the\nrate of getting high or the the chance\nof getting high while minimizing the\npsychoactive elements of cannabis like\nthc and sort of the addictive potential\nthat thc has and using utilizing other\nsort of cannabinoids that could be\npotentially helpful for social anxiety\nthere\nthere are some early\nevidence trials that that some of these\nproducts could potentially be helpful\nfor social anxiety\nbut again\num\ni think one thing to mention here\nwe'll just take the example of social\nanxiety that\nyou know in the studies that we have for\nsocial anxiety and other anxiety and\ndepression especially\nwe'll just focus on cbd for now um cbd\nedible products for this are\nbut you could probably also apply for\ninhalable versions of high cbd to thc\nratio\nproducts is that um what we see in these\nstudies is that and we're trying to\nstill figure out the dose range for\nthese elements\nfor treating these symptoms but\nwhat we see is that oftentimes you know\nin order to get a therapeutic effect you\nneed a certain on on a magnitude of like\nhundreds of cbd milligram and milligrams\nto sort of get the desired effect of\nsome of these\nuh products but um a lot of sort of\nwhat we're seeing and at least from my\nexperience even going to dispensaries is\nthat a lot of these products that are\nbeing sold at dispensaries um have\na range of like five to ten milligrams\nof cbd\nand you know you really don't know what\nyou're\ngetting\nout of these uh dispensary products\neither because it's not it's not\nregulated so it's really frustrating\nit's frustrating\nfor me as a clinician in terms of\nhelping a patient to navigate through\nusing cbd knowing that\nsort of it's an unregulated space and\nthere was sort of this\nstudy done out of uh mississippi i\nbelieve that we're looking at different\ncannabis dispensaries and their cbd\nproducts and they looked at 25 different\nproducts of cbd um at a dispensary and\num only three out of the 25\nand they were measuring the cbd and and\nsort of the thc content of these\ndifferent products and only three out of\n25 of those products specifically in\nthat area had cbd content that was like\nwithin 20\nof what they were saying wow and there\nwere like some products that were like\nthat had zero percent\nof like cbd and it was just pure like\nberry gummies or something and i think\npart of the you know i think part of\nwhat i'm getting at is like one the sort\nof\nfrustration of working in this space\nit's kind of like it kind of reminds me\nof i can like old school runescape or\nlike diablo days where you're like\ntrying to make trades and things like\nthat but everyone out there guys have to\nscam you like after every 10 people who\nactually wants to make a good trade with\nyou i've gotten scammed like numerous\ntimes in the runescape trying to trade\nirons but like i ended up somehow uh in\nthe wilderness somewhere and someone\nkills me i'm like how the heck did i\nfall for this one again and it's like\nit's like the wild west out there and\nlike the fda has shut down like anyway\nthat's shut down or not shut down but\nthey've really worn they've worn sort of\nthese dispensaries based off of it and\ni'm getting back to my point and that is\nthat um\nthe reason that we're seeing\num even people who are taking this\ni believe we're seeing even people are\ntaking this completely sub therapeutic\ndoses meaning like 5 milligrams or zero\nmilligrams of cbd and reporting like oh\nmy anxiety is so much better like i'm\ngetting you know i'm feeling so much\nbetter and i think we really have to\nacknowledge that there's a huge placebo\neffect that we see um even in our like\nclinical trials for antidepressants i\nmean we're talking about like\neven thinking about like the uh\neffects of antidepressants on depression\nlike about half of that effect is is\nsort of due to placebo meaning like like\neven if you just gave like 100 people\nwith social anxiety or with depression\nwater pills there was going to be a\ncertain proportion 20 30 40 of those\npeople would say like this is this is\ngreat this is really working for me and\nyou know yeah\nso this i can i can totally see how if\npeople like marijuana the placebo effect\nfrom the therapeutic dose\nwould be very high\nyeah it's twice as high i think studies\nshow that like if you believe\nsomething's gonna work\nlike it the likelihood of it actually\nworking is twice as high so you have not\nonly are you getting water pill but\nyou're you're being told by somebody\nthat it's gonna help with anxiety\nthere's a chance that it'll certainly\nhelp and there's a much higher chance\nthan if you were just giving a water\npill on its own so\nso michael\njust like so let's just let me ask a\nquestion so\nlet's say i've got depression or ptsd\nand people say like oh i you know i use\nmarijuana to cope what do you think\nabout that\nyeah um i think i'll start with ptsd um\ni think ptsd is a hot topic\nfor cannabis\ni think anywhere between like a third\nand\nlike a half of people who are getting\nmedical marijuana cards put down ptsd as\ntheir reason so it's it's definitely\nsomething out there\nand you know i i really wish i could say\nand i'm going to be focusing first on\nwhole plant cannabis for now\nbut you know i really wish i could say\nthat like\nit's effective for ptsd but but honestly\nthe trials have not really panned out\nwell\nagain you know the studies are limited\nit's very difficult to study cannabis in\nthe u.s it's still a schedule one drug\nmeaning it has high abuse potential in\nthe same category as lsd\nfor example um\nand so doing any clinical trials with it\nis very\ndifficult\nto say the least\nbut at the same time what we've seen is\nthat you know in studies for example\nthere are two big studies out of the\nveterans affairs hospitals where they\ntracked people who had ptsd\nsymptoms and started using cannabis and\nover time\npeople who use more cannabis and more\nand used it more frequently this is\nagain talking about whole plant smoked\ncannabis\nthe higher thc content and the more that\nthey were using it the worse and\nthe worsening of their symptoms over\ntime and\none study even showed out of like it was\nlike a few hundred patients that they\nlooked at when they stopped\nusing cannabis many of them actually got\nhad improvement in nightmares\nand anxiety and then so you so you\nwonder like you know why is it that we\nhear\num\nyou know a lot of people with ptsd find\nsome\nsort of reprieve from\nwhole plants smoked cannabis and feel\nlike they're you know really improving\ntheir functional lifestyle but why is it\nthat this is not panning out in the\nstudies in the same way that even other\npsychedelics or antidepressants are are\npanning out in the site it's like why is\nthere this like discrepancy here and i\nthink you know it's it's still sort of\nunclear but i think if we dive into the\nneurobiology of it um it starts making\nsense how so i'm gonna do that so\nall right so um\nso cannabis let's start with like thc um\nthc operates on a receptor in the body\ncalled cv1\nand cv1 is located in many different\nplaces in the central nervous system one\nof those places is located on is the\namygdala\nso\nwe know that\nsort of low doses at low doses of thc\nwhat happens is that there seems to be\nsort of an anxiolytic effect to the to\ncannabis um for example you know they've\ntried to take they've tried to extract\njust\nthc into a pill called nabalone and very\nsmall doses like 7.5 milligrams\nmay be helpful for anxiety and stress\nand stress symptoms\nbut what happens is that\nat higher\ndoses of thc\nthe effect on\nthe cb1 receptor actually flips we see\nthat it can create anxiogenic effects\non the amygdala and the amygdala again\nis is our fear center it's it's sort of\nour emotion center right and so\nthinking about like the short-term\neffects on\ntrauma and ptsd and i think you might\nhave mentioned this on stream outlook\nmaybe once like\nin that some patients especially in the\ninitial dose of a whole plan cannabis\ncan have a\nanxiety response or even a trauma a\ntraumatic response and that can linger\nover time so there's definitely a risk\nto that\nthen sort of what people were saying\nbefore for a while is that like okay\nif you get past that first stage things\nstart getting better for you and\nneurobiologically what is going on there\nis that\num the receptors on let's pause for a\nsecond michael let's just make sure we\nrecap okay so\nour amygdala so i i noticed you're using\nsome terminology so let's explain that\nso the amygdala is your fear and\nsurvival center of the brain so when we\nexperience negative emotions oftentimes\nour amygdala is acting up or is lit up\nright so when it's active we'll\nexperience things like fear\num you mentioned\nanxiolytic and anxiogenic so\nanxiolytic is the term\nanxio which is anxiety and lytic which\nmeans to lyse or break apart\nand so anxiolytic agents are things that\nreduce anxiety or break down anxiety\nbreak apart anxiety and anxiogenic are\nthings that generate anxiety so if i\nheard you correctly there's a cb1\nreceptor which is a particular kind of\ncannabinoid receptor that's found in the\namygdala which is our fear center of the\nbrain and at low doses of thc\nwhat that essentially does is\nacts on that receptor and reduces the\namount of anxiety we feel is that\ncorrect\nyeah\nthe problem is that at higher doses it\nappears that the effect on the receptor\nchanges which for people who are out\nthere listening is common\nthat at low doses like particular you\nknow pharmacological or like herbal\ncompounds will work in a particular way\nand then at higher doses they'll start\nto work in different ways or even\nthey'll start to act on other receptors\nand so if we take like low-dose thc it\nmay have some kind of\nanxiety-reducing property but at higher\ndoses of thc it actually makes people\nfeel more anxious\nand can almost have like a negative\nexperience or traumatic experience is\nthat fair to say\nyeah that's that's fair to say\nand and can i just ask one or two\nquestions about that real quick\nso you're familiar with k2 i'm sure\nbecause you're doing residency in boston\nand i did res can you tell us a little\nbit about what k2 is like chemically\nwell uh my understanding of k2 is that\nit's a synthetic\nform of basically a cannabinoid so so\nwhen i was like working in emergency\nrooms in boston several years ago i\nremember seeing people who used k2 and\nthey would be like very very paranoid\nvery afraid and like quite psychotic and\ndelusional\ndo you have any idea if k2\nacts kind of in the same way that you're\ntalking about where it like\nhyperactivates\nuh cb1 like do we know anything about\nhow k2 works cause like k2 seems to\ninduce i've worked with patients who\nwill have\nk2 and then it's a synthetic cannabinoid\nand they'll have like ptsd after using\nit\nyeah absolutely i mean yeah i've seen\nthis too as well\nyou know we had a patient who took k2\nreally high functioning woman and\ndeveloped some really bad\nreally bad psychotic trip and had to get\nelectroconvulsive therapy for weeks\nbefore they were sort of able to come\ndown\nto somewhat sort of\nbaseline and you know i i'm not entirely\nsure in the mechanism of k2 but it makes\nsense to me that it's probably working\nonce in a similar way on the cb1\nreceptor and you know i haven't\nmentioned that cb the cb1 receptor is on\nmultiple areas of the brain\nboth like\nwe talked about the amygdala\nalso in like the frontal cortex where a\nlot of our decision making\nsort of our ability to like navigate\nthings our visual spatial our motivation\ndrive\nall of that a lot of those things as\nwell as\nregulating our emotions a lot of those\ncenters are in the frontal cortex\nthere's a lot of cb1 receptors there and\nthere's also cb1 receptors in our\ntemporal lobes and these are the areas\nwhere you know\nthat that are associated with visual\neffects or even like potential like\npsychotic effects and we see\num sort of that\nthat function as well so\num\nabsolutely i think they're they're very\nrelated so you were saying um so\njust uh so at higher doses of thc we can\nget kind of anxiogenic or like it almost\ncreates anxiety or paranoia or things\nlike that and how does that relate to\nptsd again\nyeah so um\nwhat i was getting at is that\nwhat happens is um that once you get\npast that hump and people say like okay\nthe first trip might be bad but if you\nkeep trying it\nyou won't have bad trips anymore okay\nand like you start developing tolerance\nand it gets better and maybe even starts\nhelping the symptoms but\num\nwhat happens is um\nthat's\ni'm gonna give an example like like\nganking and moba and like league of\nlegends or in dota right like if\nsomebody is\nsomebody's calling for a gank once and\nand you're like there's a reason for it\nyou'll go to the lane and you'll help\nthem out with ganking but if if\nsomebody's like asking for a gank every\ntwo minutes because like oh my god like\nthis is a terrible matchup i need your\nhelp so badly we're never gonna win like\nwhat happened since you start getting\ndesensitized to listening to\nto this person asking for your gank for\na gig and you're like\nall right i do i like i cannot keep\nganking your lane we're just gonna lose\nthe game and i also just like hearing\nyour voice is really troubling so\nyou know we see the same thing happen\nwith receptors like the more you\nthe more you activate the cv1 receptor\nthe\nit sort of desensitizes it to to um\nto the the cannabinoid and it down\nregulates i mean there's there's less\nreceptors as well\nso\ni know this is getting deep into the\nscience and i'll get to why\nyou know why i think it's important and\none thing is that\nover time we see that\nthere's also the cb1 receptors on\nthe part of the brain that regulates\nemotion so this is called the\nventromedial prefrontal cortex and\nstepping back a bit and thinking about\nlike\ntrauma and like ptsd a lot of\nyou know trauma is our inability to\novercome some overwhelming situation or\nor um or emotion and our inability to\nprocess that and trauma a lot of sort of\nlike when i understand like when i\ntrauma when i call for a gank on my lane\nover and over and over again and no one\nshows up\nwhat i said uh you i was just making a\njoke i was like you're like you were\nsaying that trauma is our inability to\novercome a profound emotional experience\nand i was just saying like when i'm\ncalling for ganks over and over and over\nagain my team is afk\nthat's that that is all the drama\nyeah okay\num\nso trauma is\nyou know it a\na uh and tell me if i need to clarify\nthings but there's a part again it's\nit's where our amygdala\nis over firing and there's we lose a\nconnection with the part of our brain\nthat regulates emotion the ventral amino\nprefrontal cortex so\nwe're firing the middle amygdala on its\nown and we lose this connection\nso in terms of treating ptsd we want to\nstrengthen these connections between the\npart of our brain that can process the\nmotions and the feeling of the motion\nitself\nwe um that's this kind of simply so how\ndoes how does how do cannabinoids fit\ninto that\nthe ability for our frontal lobes to\ncontrol\nor process our emotional experience\nso what we see\nin ptsd is that over the long over the\nlong term because you have a\ndesensitization of receptors on the\nventral medial prefrontal cortex the um\nthe actual amount of neurons\nneuronal density in that part of your\nbrain actually decreases\nso the part of so the part of your brain\nthat is there to regulate and identify\nnegative emotions\nbecomes\ndesensitized and decreases in size\ninteresting so ventromedial prefrontal\ncortex shrinks\nif you use marijuana regularly\nyeah no this we yeah this is sort of\nimaging studies that have\nsort of suggested this and and what i'm\ntrying to get at here\nis that um\nis that\nwhat happens when you when you take uh\nsort of high thc products of the long\nterm is that\na lot of times you experience uh people\nexperience sort of this emotional\nblunting\nand sort of a difficulty being able to\nregulate the emotion itself\ntheir perception of the emotion of\ntrauma and these symptoms can go down\nbut\num\nwe're not actually addressing the\nunderlying issue which which is through\nthe work of being able to regulate these\nemotions\ninteresting so no\ni'm making sense yeah let me just see if\ni i kind of got you so\nand i i think this kind of makes sense\nso\nyou know if if i'm using a substance\njust at a very high level if i'm using a\nsubstance\nto numb my emotional state\nmy brain's ability to control and\nregulate my emotional state becomes less\nnecessary right if i'm numbing it like\nmy my ventromedial prefrontal cortex\ndoesn't need to do anything\nyeah\nand as a result like so gen i mean i\ndon't know if we're really talking about\natrophy or this is you know if we're\ntalking about fmri studies i don't think\nanyone is looking at one patient\nlongitudinally right it's like average\ntaking a hundred people who use\nmarijuana versus a hundred people who\ndon't use marijuana and comparing the\nrelative averages of their brain size in\nthis area so i think sort of what i what\ni would assume is that\nyou know if our brain doesn't need to\nregulate our emotions the part of our\nbrain that regulates emotions kind of\nlike checks out and possibly is smaller\nor something like that\nright and so we don't need to regulate\nour emotions\nthe thing that i'm kind of curious about\nwhich you sort of already answered in a\nsense is that\nso i'm kind of curious michael do you\nthink that it's people who have\nmore trouble\nregulating emotions\nthose are the ones who reach towards\nmarijuana because\nthey need a substance or like since if\nif i have an inability to regulate my\ninternal emotional state\nis that the cause of me using marijuana\nor is that a consequence of me using\nmarijuana to numb myself and therefore\nlike don't need to develop that part of\nmy brain as much like what do you think\na little bit of both\nprobably a little bit of both\nand\nyeah i think we see that\num\nnow in other realms of research as well\nfor example um\nin in terms of uh\nuh in terms of looking at how isolation\nduring the pandemic affects substance\nuse\nand we see that people who\nfeel a lot more isolated\nduring the pandemic might have an even\nhigher like reward response to using\nsubstances themselves as well and it\nmight sort of go to\nsubstances as a way almost to help them\nself-regulate\num too\nand yeah there's actually this\ninteresting article\non at the new on the new york times um\nthat was talking about how like\nopioids which is sort of you know\ndifferent a different beast than than\ncannabis but\ntalking about how uh people sort of view\ntheir relationship with opioid like like\nthat of a good friend\nin that like over time you sort of\ndevelop an attachment\nthe substance um and a lot of that has\nto do with\num you know the substance being the\nsort of the pseudo person that's helping\nyou process and or most mostly regulate\nthe feelings and and um and i think that\nmakes a lot of sense in terms of\nthinking about\ncannabis as well and i've talked to\npeople who who also have a similar sort\nof\nexperience that like you know\nthings aren't really going well in their\nrelationships you know irl and\num a lot of times people sort of look to\nand find these\nthings that can sort of help replace\nthat but then it's sort of like\nthat friend that sort of\nseems really attractive at first and\ntells you really nice things but then\nkind of talks behind your back and\nbefore you realize that you start losing\nyour other friends and you're also like\nwhat the heck man like what happened to\nall these other things so it's like that\nkind of friend so i mean do you think\nthere is a\nbecause a lot of people are wondering so\nlike\nif i'm hearing you michael like\nyou know i'm not surprised at some of\nthese conclusions because i think\nthey're the similar ones to that what i\ncame to is that you know a lot of people\nwill experience some benefit from using\nmarijuana but really if you look at the\nstudies and stuff\nwhat you find is that if we look at some\nof these ptsd studies in in in the\nveteran population which you were\ntalking about that there's a correlation\nbetween worsening ptsd and in a higher\nexposure to thc over time\ni wonder a little bit about that's a\nchicken or egg thing too is it that\npeople who have\nworse ptsd are more likely to reach for\nmarijuana\nor is it that using marijuana sort of\nnumbs yourself and reduces your ability\nto control your emotions and then can\nmake ptsd worse over time\ni think you kind of addressed that\nbecause you mentioned that if you stop\nusing marijuana and have ptsd that\nyou'll see an improvement of symptoms so\nthere does seem to be more of a causal\nrelationship there\nsuggesting that marijuana is like really\nnot good for ptsd\nand again we're talking about whole\nplant higher content of thc products\nusing used frequently and\nuh chronically for the diagnosis of ptsd\nyes yeah i mean it's hard to it's hard\nto make causal relationships with\nstudies where you're not you know\ntesting out yeah\ncannabis but this is sort of a current\nunderstanding of the impact and and so a\nlot of people are just wondering like is\nthere a healthy way to use marijuana or\nis it okay if i just use marijuana to\nhelp me sleep at night like that's\nsomething that i hear a lot what do you\nthink about that\nyeah i mean certainly possibly there\nthere are healthy ways to use\nmarijuana\ni'd say that\nusing\nproducts that are\nyou know i would caution\nagainst sort of again high content thc\nproducts with whole plant for people who\ndo have ptsd for people who have\npsychotic disorders like schizophrenia\nor have family history of schizophrenia\nor other psychotic disorders or people\nwho have bipolar disorder\nas well um\nalso you know i think it's important to\ntalk about some of these harmful effects\nbecause\ninto these dispensaries you might not\nhear about some of these things from\nthose people and if i were to go to a\ndoctor and talk about medication i would\nwant to hear both sides so before i kind\nof go into\nthe helpful aspects i do want to lay\nout some of these things and\nyou know there are associations with\nwhole plant cannabis use for people who\nhave asthma\nthat could worsen their symptoms people\nwho have cardiac a cardiac history it\ncould lead to more arrhythmias and\nthings like that\ni would caution against using it if\nyou're under the age of 25 uh because of\nits impact on the brain development can\nyou talk a little bit about that\nyeah sure um\nagain you know this is sort of\npreliminary data but the the data that\nwe have right now is certainly\nconcerning that\nyou know during the development of the\nbrain which is\nfor uh for men you know up until the age\nof 25\num but\nduring the development of the brain\nthe\nthe mechanism is not clearly known but\ncannabis use can\ndysregulate\num\nthe dopamine pathways that help develop\nthe parts of the brain especially in the\nprefrontal cortex that are required for\nemotional processing\nfor motivation\nand for\nmotor functions as well and\nwhat we see for example there was a\ncouple studies that were done that took\na look\nin new zealand that\ngave\nthat attract kids that were using\ncannabis over time\nearly teenage years to\nall the way up until their 30s and 40s\nwhat they saw was that um\nin these people they had you know\nexecutive\nfunction like what i just talked about\nlike deficits but there was also uh for\npeople who used cannabis from an early\nage and two when they were older there\nwas a\nslight but there was a significant drop\nin iq from five to eight points and when\nthey stopped using cannabis later on in\nlife that didn't recover\nso i think this is sort of the body of\nevidence that\nyou take a look at and we're like okay\nwe need to maybe\nbe a little bit more hesitant in terms\nof you know\nand more mindful in terms of how we're\nusing cannabis especially or again we're\nback to talking about whole plant\ncannabis here but when our kid you know\nand we're talking about potential\nlasting effects of cannabis for people\nwith the developing brain you know again\nthinking about like the impact on that\nand so um there's certainly\naddiction psychiatrists um\nmy field who are uh pushing for\nsort of\na higher like age limit for for\nlegalization i'm not going to go into\nmuch of that rhetoric there but other\nbut all to say is that there's certainly\nsome concern\nand that's why that's why that's being\nsaid yeah\nso\nnow now\npeople who are listening to this are\nterrified i think\nyou know people who want to learn about\ncannabis oftentimes use cannabis and\npeople are now wondering\nhow big is five to eight points\nlike what do we what are we talking\nabout here what does that what does that\nmean for people practically\nlike\nyou know if you have someone who's so so\nwhat is uh and so this is where you know\nwe say kyle we sure\nlet me just\njump in with this actually before i give\nmichael a chance to answer but\nso when we say like if you all have\nquestions you should go see a licensed\nprofessional and have an actual\nconversation i want to talk about that\nfor a second so we don't say that just\nas a medical disclaimer i think that\nthis is like\nif i'm hearing one thing from michael\nthat's very loud and clear\nit's that\nyou can't get a simple answer to these\nquestions so if you say if you ask a\nquestion which i get a lot like is it\nokay to use marijuana to sleep\nwell i think michael's already\ndemonstrated that when\nthere are so many things about that\nquestion that\nwarrant individual evaluation or or\npersonalization a personal answer and\nthe first thing that he's kind of\nemphasized is okay what do you mean by\nmarijuana are you talking about you know\nlike\nwhat thc content are you talking about\nwhat thc to cbd ratio are you talking\nabout\nyou know like when you say to sleep are\nwe talking about are you using it every\nday to fall asleep or just certain\nnights what are the reasons that you're\nhaving difficulty sleeping do you have\nan actual like insomnia is it depression\nis it poor sleep hygiene like what's\ngoing on there\nand so the biggest concern that i have\noftentimes around marijuana usage just\nin terms of like my clinical work is\nthat a lot of people will say and i\nthink we kind of see this even from some\nof the studies that he's citing that oh\nyou know i have ptsd like it helps me\nlike with my emotions it helps me with\nmy anxiety if i'm going to a party or\nsomething like that\nwe'll see people say things like that\nwhereas you know my perspective as a\nclinician is like\nokay i'm not disputing that it helps you\nin some way but the real question is\nlike what are we signing you up for long\nterm\nis there some kind of underlying\nproblem here that you're not addressing\nis it essentially a band-aid that over\ntime can cause problems i've seen some\nreally bad cases of things like cyclic\nvomiting syndrome which you know i think\npeople who use marijuana thankfully most\npeople don't get that but once you get\nthat it's like very very difficult to\ndeal with\num and there are you know really bad\noutcomes from using band-aids which is\nbasically how i tend to view marijuana\nis that you know i've seen some clinical\nbenefit\ngenerally speaking the best clinical\nscenarios in which i've seen marijuana\nuse tend to be in cancer patients or in\npeople who have\nuh really really bad opiate addiction\nthat's refractory to treatment\nand sometimes you can use marijuana to\nreduce the opioid dependence and kind of\nlike\ntake the lesser of two evils i've seen\nthat done a couple of times\num and that's just because the the risk\nof being addicted to opiates is just so\nhuge that you kind of like you know need\nto get people off of it\nbut\ni i think it's like really important i\nhopefully all are taking this away as\nwell that like what i'm getting from\nmichael is that it's like subtle and\nnuanced and individualized and so\npeople will ask questions like is it\nokay if i do xyz\nand that's where my answer is like it\nkind of depends on what's the\ncircumstances you know what's your\nlong-term plan is it like okay like even\nif you're using marijuana to sleep right\nnow\nyou know is your plan to just continue\nto use marijuana to sleep for the next\n40 years of your life like that doesn't\nsound like a good plan to me\nanyway i i kind of jumped in and\ninterrupted you um but\nyeah no i think that's a great point and\ncoming back to the idea of sleep there\nis certainly\nsome evidence that again going back to\ncbd products and high-end\nmilk products that are higher in cbd to\nthc can potentially sort of decrease the\namount of time it takes for you to fall\nasleep and\nprolong the amount of sleep you have\nbut what we see in thc products is that\nit can get in the way of\num\nwhile it can potentially help somebody\nfall asleep it does give people like\nless quality sleep over time by reducing\nwhat do you remember\nthe rem is like rapid eye movement\npart of your sleep and that that's\nimportant for\na lot of a range of things including\nlike processing contextual processing\nand um\nuh like filtering and and processing\nlike emotions that happen during the day\num as well as physical benefits as well\nranging from the immune system to\ncardiovascular etc and\nwe see this a lot in medications in\ngeneral for sleep that\nyes they can be used short term\nyou're going to use it like talk to your\ndoctor obviously first of all but you\nknow thinking about short term like a\nfew weeks not up not any higher than\nlike three to six months you know try to\nyou could try to use something like that\nin conjunction with uh working with your\ndoctor but knowing that you know there\nare sort of long-term\nside effects to that and focusing on\nother sort of behavioral\nuh interventions to sleep which included\nlike sleep hygiene for example um you\nknow reducing the amount of\num sort of electronic exposure late at\nnight um yeah i think you had like a\ntotal uh you i think you've talked about\nsleep uh before but um\nyeah like associating your bed just for\nsleep insects and nothing\nor else don't you don't do work and\nthings like that with uh\nin your bed sort of this uh\narousal response mechanism um\nassociating your bed with things that\nare that help you relax and get to sleep\nso\num so i would say you know i would try\nto avoid whole plant smoked cannabis for\nfor sleep as of this time there's not\nreally great evidence for it\nuh for most of those products again you\nknow there's some\nexcitement around sort of this like\nhired cbd to tc ratio or these like\nproducts that have these terpene\nentourage effects that can mitigate\npotentially thc levels and reduce the\namount of time the high\nhealing\nbut i think the jury is still out on\nthose kinds of products and i mean what\ni mean by that is like they've tested\nthese on rats so far um in mice and you\nknow i think it needs more evidence in\nthe human sort of clinical setting\nbefore we can make conclusions on that\nand we know anyone who's worked in the\nbiotech space\nat all knows that things that work in\nanimal models rarely sort of pan out\nwell in human trials so i think i think\nthere's just there's a lot of excitement\ni i think i'm with like\nsome of that for sure but um in terms of\na doctor recommending it for sleep like\nit's it we're\nnot really at that level yet and i do\nwant to mention right now there's only\nfour fda approved\nindications for cannabis like at this\nmoment and what are those epidiolex for\nchildhood seizures there's two rare\ntypes of childhood sutures with french\nnames i'm not going to try to butcher\ni believe there's\nyou know appetite stimulation\nin\npatients with eating disorders and\nnausea in patients with chemotherapy and\nyou know i mentioned some of the um\nsynthetic uh forms of cannabinoids that\nhave come out to help treat to help\naddress these things\nbut interesting outside of that so the\nfda has basically taken a look at all\nthe evidence so far and they basically\nsaid there's nothing outside of those\nfour\nthat we have enough evidence to suggest\nthat to say to people like it actually\nworks for these things\nso that's that's kind of where we're at\nwith a lot of this so michael like so um\nyou know\nif we say that okay marijuana is like\nnot good to use long term for sleep like\nwhat do you think about people who kind\nof\nequate or assume that marijuana is going\nto be the same as like sleeping\nmedications or or you know sleep meds\nlike that both of those are going to be\nbad they're kind of equally effective or\nineffective you don't want to develop a\ndependence on a sleep medicine as well\nwhat do you think about that\nyeah i think you know we see i i think\nyou mentioned like sort of the band-aid\neffect and i think that's how a lot of\npeople who are doing the science of the\nstudies matter are really seeing\ncannabis and cannabis is very different\nfrom benzodiazepines in terms of the\nmechanisms of action but they they both\nalso work on similar neurotransmitters\nas well and we see this\nas well with benzodiazepines but that\nyes it can be helpful for sleep but long\nterm we really try to minimize use over\nthe long term\nbecause of those things but you know if\nyou\nyou know if you have\nuh if you're if you're given like the\noptions of different sleep medications\nthat have been well studied and that\nhave potential use you know if you tried\nall of those and you want to try\ncannabis because those are not working i\nthink that's that's sort of the place\nwhere i would recommend people\nwell let's try it out and navigate it\nwith their\ntheir doctors just because we just have\nmore\nstudies on other things than we do for\nthings like\ni'll plan thc for for sleep now cbd\nmight be a different story um but kind\nof similar story in that you know again\ntry other things but you're not gonna\ndie from trying cbd i mean you're not\ngoing to die from thc but the harmful\neffects of cbd don't seem to be as\nas high as that of thc um both like in\nthe short term and\num and you know jury's still out in\nterms of long term but there's nothing\nthat's come out yet that is completely\njarring\nso and the reason to go for sleep\nmedications that are prescribed if i'm\nhearing you is that we basically have\nmore science behind them\nyeah i would say that's the case i mean\nyou mentioned uh other things as well\nlike cannabis for opioid use disorder\nlike if somebody came to me with opioid\nuse disorder you know i would really do\nthem in this justice by saying like hey\nlet's let's try cannabis for this like\noff the bat because\nyou have life-saving medications like\nyou know we have suboxone buprenorphine\nyou know we have so much evidence for\nthese other life-saving medications for\nme not to\nlook at these medications that have oh i\nwasn't talking about\nopioid use disorder by the way\ni was talking about pain management\npain management yeah sorry\noh okay yeah i'm sorry okay i may have\nactually misspoke but yeah\nno that's fair but but it's a similar\nway like i\ni think typically how doctors like us\nyou know how we see new medications\nespecially ones that are unstudied is\nthat\nyou know um\ni think we want to be cautiously\noptimistic about it because we don't\nwant to do harm to our patients and we\ndo want to provide the most like\nevidence-based medications for\nsomebody's\num\nsymptoms so\num\nyeah so so\nmichael what do you think about so we've\nwe've got kind of like two or three\ndifferent tracks which i think people\nare really curious about one is um\nyou know the relationship between\nparticular illnesses so for example you\nmentioned that\nif you have like a family history of\nschizophrenia like you should really\nreally stay away from marijuana\num can you talk a little bit about that\nuh so i think that the two kind of\ndivisions that we've got and maybe what\nwe can do is pull chat if we've got a\nmod but we can ask kind of like about\nquestions around you know what's the\nrelationship between marijuana use and\nthings like schizophrenia or marijuana\nuse and bipolar disorder or the the\nother route that we can go down is a lot\nof people have questions about you know\ncan i safely use it\num\nyou know is what what about recreational\nuse\nuh\nand then other things that people have\nalso talked about which is like you know\nincorporating i'll see this basically\nevery now and then maybe one at least\nonce a month on the meditation subreddit\nwhere people are talking about using\nmarijuana versus not using marijuana\nwhile meditating or\num we also know that for example some of\nthese more psychedelic compounds that\nhave been used in spiritual traditions\nfor a long time are now being studied\nfor certain things like depression and\nptsd\num\ndo you have a particular direction that\nyou'd prefer to go or do you think it's\nimportant to talk about\num\ni'm happy to to\ngo with whatever the chat wants so\nwhatever\nokay\nall those topics are interesting to me i\ndon't think there's a one particular\nuh um let me see if i can set this okay\nwe've got a poll running so it looks\nlike\nuh so it looks like um people are\ncurious about safe recreational use\nthe most so what do you think i mean if\nsomeone asks can i use weed safely\nrecreationally what do you think about\nthat\ni think like you said before it's a\ntough question uh to to address because\nthat really depends on\nuh what\nis sort of the wreck what what are we\ntalking about in terms of the\nrecreational use of a\nuh of a substance and what sort of\nunderlying conditions do people have\nthat could that could corroborate with\nthat now let's say in a perfect world\nsomebody you know you know doesn't have\nptsd or bipolar family history or\nschizophrenia perfect world you know\nthey don't have any history of\ncardiovascular disease they're above the\nage of 25\nthey're not pregnant um and\num don't have sort of the pulmonary\nthings that we'd be worried about in\nterms of smoke cannabis use\num can you use it recreationally i would\nsay one that like um\nas much as you can kind of use it to the\npoint where you're not getting high\nlike that like\ni think using cbd for example maybe if\nyou're\npeople quite like drinking red wine or\nsomething like that like could that be\nsomething to using it at night to help\nsort of\nrelax you\nmaybe\nat low doses like that it's kind of like\nchamomile tea\nif you're going to use\ncannabis products if you're going to use\nsmall canvas products and that's kind of\nwhat you've decided recreationally then\ni would just say try to stick with ones\nthat are lower in thc content like less\nthan 10 or 20 and try not to go\nabove that amount because again the risk\nthat we see with it are sort of in the\nhigher doses\nthan that and try to use it as\nless frequently as possible and be\nhonest with yourself why are you using\nit because if a lot of people do say\nlike they're using it recreationally or\nfor pleasure\nthen you know they ask themselves it's\nprobably some symptom that they're\naddressing and unless like\nthe symptoms are sort of like addressed\nand talked about um in other ways like\nthat\nhold on a second michael did i hear you\ncorrectly so so you think recreational\nuses\ni was kind of confused by some of the\ndosing you talked about so i'm not\nreally too familiar with marijuana like\nin terms of people don't you really use\nit in my social circles and stuff like\nthat but i mean i thought the whole\npoint behind recreational use is that\npeople like to get high like they like\nto be\nyou know and and so\ni\nand\nisn't that sort of what we're talking\nabout here is like\nusing it to\nthe point of\nyou know high potency kind of thc sort\nof stuff\nlike when people say recreational use to\nme i don't think i've never heard of\nsomeone who uses recreational marijuana\nmaybe this is uh due to the selection\nbias and like i mentioned it's not like\ni i in my social circles they're very\npopular to use but um\nyou know i've never heard of the\nmarijuana equivalent of\ndrinking one glass of red wine with\ndinner\nlike it's almost always what i hear\nabout is people\nyou know using for the purpose of of\nreally getting high like they're\nshooting for that sort of effect\nrecreationally\ni i don't know\nit's just strange maybe it's once again\nthe selection bias of who i've hung out\nwith in the past and\nyou know\ni know who i haven't hung out with but\nyeah sure um i'd say people have various\nreasons why they might use cannabis um\none could be the sort of the euphoric\neffect from getting high other people\nmight use it sort of a\ncalming or sort of relaxation kind of\nlike a couch\nsort of relaxation mode that and some\npeople might not be necessarily chasing\nthe high for it so i would\ni would consider that there are other\nways of using it recreationally okay\nand\nthere are certainly ways of micro dosing\ncannabis so that it doesn't\nget you sort of that euphoric effect\num\nthat comes with the high\nand you know if you're\nin terms of just re specifically\nrelating to mental health\num it's it's really unclear and it's\nhard for me as a doctor to say like okay\ngo\ngo and get high like every day like it's\nprobably not going to affect like where\nevery other day it's just the data there\nis just really unclear and so i can't\nreally say\nlike\ncertain what the impact of mental health\nwill be if you're chasing a high and if\nyou're doing that daily but what i can\nsay is that many people do develop over\ntime\nand effects from that and it's hard for\nme to tell people that like okay this is\nsafe to do if that makes sense\nno i i would just say caution if if\nyou're gonna use it to get high like\nwhat i i would\ncaution ads with like\num\ni think one you know i guess we talked\nabout one thing that happens\nbut when you're getting high there's\nsort of this like\ninhibitory mechanism that happens in\nyour\nbrain um the\ndifferential cortex helps like inhibit\nyour thoughts right\nbut like\nyou're chasing the high for creativity\nor euphoria\nit's kind of like playing\nit's like it's kind of like opening loot\nboxes but like ones that are like\ncompletely\nlike kind of a little bit more rigged\nsometimes against you what i mean by\nthat is like\nit helps so a lot of people experience\nthe high as like this this idea of like\nopenness and having a lot of interesting\ninsights and thoughts about\nself-reflection and other thoughts that\ncould be like completely\num divergent um meaning like for example\nlike we've we've heard about like\nartists and ceos like using it for\ncreative reasons in terms of getting\nhigh because a lot of it has to do with\nthe divergent form of like creativity\nmeaning like getting all sorts of\ndifferent ideas out there that are sort\nof an out of the box\nstyle thing but the tough part about it\nis that\num i get that it's fun and it's\nenjoyable and like to each their own but\nthe tough part about\nabout like being open to all these ideas\nis that you know you talk about your\nstream like\nmachines and we've talked about like\nparanoia and psychosis and all of these\nthings like you're like rolling the dice\neach like you're kind of gambling a\nlittle bit because you don't know\nlike\num\nlike you're\nthe openness is is very inclusive and\nwhat we're not hearing is like the\npeople who do use it to get high that\num ultimately like may\npotentially give them certain thought\nmachines or ideas about themselves that\nthey start to believe and then maybe\nlater on develop into other things and\nso\num\nno\nit's it's\ni think that\nwhether or not you know getting high\nwill have a significant impact on your\nhealth if you're just doing it like once\na month or something like that and you\ndon't have those other conditions i've\ntalked about is it gonna have a\nsignificant impact on your mental health\nper se probably not but is that\nsomething you're chasing very frequently\nand that's something that\nit's it's like a little bit of a gamble\neach time you're doing it and so we're\nyou hear a lot of positive examples\nof like people like having creative\nthoughts on it but then i think as\nclinicians we see\nsometimes these negative examples of\npeople who use it recreationally and\nhave a hard time engaging with us in\ntherapy or or being able to\nmake\nfamiliar function at work and things\nlike that so it's a tough question\nuh when in terms of in terms of the high\naspect yeah i think a couple of thoughts\nabout that one is that\nso in my experience like\nlike you mentioned so some people will\ntalk about the benefits of it and and\nwhat i tend to find is that there's like\nif someone successful\ntalks about marijuana use\npeople love it so much that it kind of\nfloats to the top of the internet\nbecause everyone who loves marijuana is\nlike see\nthis person did it and they're okay\nwhereas you know what you don't see\nfloating to the top of the internet is\nyou know like the vast majority of\nyou know i mean we see the stuff right\nin the emergency room when we're on call\novernight about\nwhether they be college students or\nhomeless\npart of the homeless population or just\nall the people that use marijuana\nregularly who sort of don't end up in a\ngood place\ni think another thing that really\nconcerns me is that what i've what i\ntend to find especially like a little\nbit in our community is that\npeople will say that they have\nparticular problems which i you know i\ntotally respect they'll say oh you know\ni struggle with social anxiety or i\nstruggle to find motivation\ni i can't put together my life\nand what i oftentimes will find is if i\nassess them for marijuana use there's\nlike a significantly higher\npercentage than let's say the average\npopulation\nand so so one of the things that\nconcerns me about marijuana is that\nit\ni don't think it's directly responsible\nbut i think it sort of synergizes with a\nlot of other problems\nso for example like there's a very high\ncomorbidity between video game addiction\nand marijuana addiction\num\nand so i even remember looking into the\nneuroscience of this and was really\nsurprised so one thing that i sort of\nnoticed is that there's a group of\npeople that i worked with that had a lot\nof trouble like forming new habits\nso that they were kind of in this bad\ncycle\nand like they couldn't get out of that\nbad cycle and i got kind of curious\nabout that a lot of them would use\nmarijuana very regularly as well\nand so was really surprised to discover\nthat a lot of the habit circuitry in the\nbrain is actually like governed by\ncannabinoid receptors\nso the formation so when you\nare doing something for the first time\nand you get that sort of like reward\nfrom it\nthat's like if you do something for the\nfirst time and you kind of enjoy it or\nlike that behavioral reinforcement in\nthe early stages is actually governed by\ndopamine and the nucleus accumbens\nbut as we start developing habits we\nkind of shift from the nucleus accumbens\nin our dopamine circuitry\nto\ncannabinoid circuitry in different parts\nof the brain\nand i almost got the impression that\nwhen you mess up mess with your dopamine\ncircuitry and cannabinoid circuitry it\nmakes it hard for you to learn from your\nmistakes and form new habits\nnow there's some neuroscience like basic\nscience kind of support of that when the\nyou know if you look at broadly speaking\nthe receptors involved but i don't think\nthat there's i haven't really seen many\nstudies that go into that degree of\nsophistication on habit formation and\nthe brains of people who are using\nsubstances but it really seems to make\nsense to me because\nwhen those people end up getting sober\noff of marijuana i tend to find that\ntheir motivation and their ability to\nform healthy habits seems to improve\ndrastically now whether that's a direct\neffect of like no longer having\ncannabinoid stimulation in your habit\ncircuitry or it is a consequence of no\nlonger numbing yourself\nand like getting in touch with your\nemotions more doing more emotional\nprocessing so that you can find your\nmotivation and stuff i don't know\nbut those are the the couple of things\nthat i think about and then the last\nthing is that you know i get this\nquestion a lot where people will ask me\nlike can i use marijuana recreationally\nand i think you kind of touched on this\nor mentioned it some but\nwhat is recreationally right what are we\nreally talking about and i i've almost\nyou know when i ask more details and\nthis could be a selection bias as well\nbecause you know being a psychiatrist\ni'm going to get a particular kind of\nperson in my office but\nwhat i tend to find is that when people\ntalk about recreationally like they're\nusually referring to multiple times a\nweek like they're not talking about once\na month\num\nand and that that's it's just a you know\nand i'm curious maybe we can do a poll\non that too when for those of you that\nare recreational marijuana users how\noften are you talking about using it\nrecreationally\nyou know is it more than once a day once\na day multiple times a week\nonce a week or\nlike once a month\nokay so everyone seems to be we'll see\nif that an actual poll comes up but\ni mean people are talking i can't tell\nif they're trolling or not but\ni mean it seems like\nthe majority of them are saying daily if\nnot multiple times a day\nbut we'll see if there's a poll comes up\nwhat do you think about that\nso\nyeah are we talking like\nwhole plants inhalable\ncannabis use daily or multiple times a\nday\ncan you be doing that\nin a way that is\nis healthy okay so so it looks like so\nhere's the poll results okay so how\noften do you use recreational marijuana\n50 of people say more than once a day\num\nsixteen percent of people say once a day\nsixteen percent of people say once a\nweek\nuh five percent of people say\nonce a month\nand\nsixteen percent of people say less than\nonce a month\nso i'd say that you know\nthe numbers are changing a little bit\nbut 60 of people who talk about\nrecreational marijuana use are referring\nto it at least once a day\nand it looks like about 40 percent of\npeople are once a week or less\nwhich has been my experience so i'd say\ntwo-thirds of people are like using it\nonce a day or you know a few times a\nweek\nyeah\ni think one thing we talked about is\nlike not everyone who does use it every\nday develops an addiction to that so in\nterms of thinking about like is it going\nto be problematic from that perspective\nthat you have\npeople have to just kind of know their\nown limitations and know what's going on\nthere and and certainly you know that\ncould be done potentially\nfrom an addiction\nperspective\nnow uh will how would that impact your\nbrain\nin the long term how will that impact\nyour mental health\nthe long term i mean it's really hard\nnot to think about\nsort of what we have with our\nassociation studies with like daily use\nand a lot the studies have usually used\nlike two or three times a day or like\nthree times a day or more as like sort\nof a heavier use of cannabis\nit's hard not to think that there's\ngoing to be some risk\ninvolved with motivation\nsome risks involved with\njust like executive function or thinking\nsome risks involved with um being like\nemotional processing when you're using\nit that much\nyou know those risks and you feel you\nfeel like\nrisks don't outweigh the benefits like\nwho am i to say like that this is not\nsomething that that you should be doing\nbut um it's i think that there are\ncertainly\njust risks that you have to be aware of\nyou know as you're doing that and i\nthink another thing that's worth\nmentioning is that we are really bad\nhuman beings are really bad at assessing\nour own cognition like we have parts of\nour brain that can assess maybe how\nsleepy we are we have parts of our brain\nthat can maybe assess like what our\nemotions are you know when we're in a\ngood place but there's when when our\nfrontal cortex which is processing\nthings is like failing there's no part\nof your brain that's saying like okay\nyour executive functions at sixty\npercent of normal now there's we are\nreally bad at it i mean like you look no\nfurther than like people who are like\nyou know challenging like professional\nsmash players if you're a complete noob\nand because you think that you're\namazing you know because your friends\nare amazing like like because because\nyou're amazing amongst your friends like\num you know we we're just not good at\nassessing our own abilities and\ncognition or like if we're like playing\nvideo games since like the eighth or\nninth hour we're like okay let's do one\nmore game i'm fine dude like i'm totally\nfine i'm with it like we we're not great\nat doing this and we see this also in\ndriving studies and sleep studies as\nwell that we're just not great at\nassessing it and so\nwhat do we what should we look at as a\nmarker for like how we're doing\ncognitively when we're on these things\nuh my opinion is that you know just as\nwith gaming we have to look at like the\npeople around us and what they think\nabout how our use is is affecting our\ncognition and\ncome up with objective markers either\nthrough\ngetting a diary and like doing you know\nputting out your own feelings during the\nday writing out like your thoughts and\nhow you're doing functionally\nand things like that and\nwe also see you know there's a study\num i think in 2017 where they looked at\npeople who were using cannabis for\ncreativity\nand\nwhat it showed is that the people who\nused this felt like they had more\ndivergent\nmeaning like more different ideas in\nterms of creativity especially among uh\ncreative arts but when they assessed\nlike during that time like\nif they actually just looked back and\nassess like what products of art they\nmade and whether or not they would\nconsider that to be a productive or\ncreative art in retrospect\nthere was no difference with with like\nplacebo like essentially essentially\nwhat the study suggested was that\nthat like when we're when when\nwe use cannabis you know we feel more\ncreative we feel this euphoria it's a\ngood feeling but whether or not like\nwe're actually producing something\ncreative whether or not we're actually\ndoing something productive with the time\nlike and i've talked to people who are\nlike yeah like i felt really good but\nthen writing a song or like doing\nsomething with it but then when i got\nout of that trip and i looked back i was\nlike okay wait this is just kind of\ngarbage like you know so i think we just\nhave to just you know all i can talk\nabout are the risks like\nevery person is different and you know\nif you weighed all this risk and for\nyourself the benefit's still our way\nlike who am i to say well i mean i i\nyeah i mean i think that's that's i i\nget what you're saying in terms of you\nknow the most we can do here is sort of\nshare the risks but i think that's kind\nof important to understand like what you\njust said i want to kind of like\nfocus on that for a second so\ni think the challenge with a lot of\nsubstances is that we just have poor\nawareness right of what the substance\nfirst of all like if we're really using\nit recreationally or not i mean\nwhen i think about so 40 43 of chat\nwas saying that they use it more than\nonce a day when they think about\nrecreational use so that's like a\nstaggering\nnumber right that's like higher than\nwhat i was expecting but\num\nand so we're sort of poor judges you\nmentioned i think the cognition studies\nare important because i i have found\nthat when i work with people who are\nusing substances\nand are especially like don't really\nthink that they have a problem\nor maybe\nyou know they're kind of like in the\npre-contemplative stage of stages of\nchange but they sort of don't really\nlike\nthey think it's recreational\nand they sort of what i oftentimes find\nis that there's very poor awareness of\nlike what's actually going on with its\nuse and if you sit down and really\ntunnel down into okay like what allows\nyou like what makes it recreational\nthere's a lot of\nthings that you're using\nit for\nlike even if it's that okay yeah i use\nit because i want to have fun but like i\ncan't have fun because i'm so worried\nabout my future and the only way that i\ncan like\nenjoy myself on a day is like in and\nhave recreation is to get rid of the\nexistential dread of everything that's\ngoing wrong in the world and in my life\nand then like\nyou know i do that through marijuana\ni agree completely it's a tricky\nbusiness too because when you\nthat's in people who you know once you i\nthink you talked about sort of\npathway of like chronic heavy use in\nterms of the dependency you know\ninitially there's sort of a positive\ndopamine spike to it there's sort of a\npleasure\nfeeling to it but over time\nyou know these dopamine receptors like\nthey become down regulated and yadda\nyadda i'm just gonna say that end result\nis that you know our the dopamine\nresponse that we have to things outside\nof the substance becomes way lower\nour our ability to derive pleasure\noutside of whatever it is that substance\nthat we might be dependent on is lower\nand you know people sort of describe\nthis\nhypodopaminergic depression that can\nhappen so what that means is that once\nyou get that stage\nyeah so once you get to that stage where\nsort of you're not deriving\nmeasure from other things because\na dopamine response to things outside\nthe substance is just mitigated because\nof the neurobiology that goes on we\nstart feeling depressed and the only\nthing that can get us to sort of even a\nbaseline level of feeling is that\nsubstance itself see this with opioids\nwe see this cannabis so\nso\nthe tricky part is that when you're at\nthat stage um\npicking cannabis or taking other things\nlike it feels like it's improving your\ndepression because without it you feel\nreally depressed nothing gives you\npleasure\ncannabis\nthe tricky part too that i found in\nterms of especially like helping people\nto understand how cannabis might be\naffecting their mind is that\nwhen they stop taking it there's this\nwithdrawal effect too if you if if if\ndependence and and and the use disorders\nis at play here there's this withdrawal\neffect makes people feel depressed and\nanxious so what happens is it's like\npeople come to me and tell me like hey\ni've been trying to come off of this but\ni'm actually way depressed and way more\nanxious off of it than i'm on to it so\ni'm going to come back on to it\nbut\nyou know part of part of the discussion\nof like you know if somebody does have a\ndependence or addiction is is is talking\nthrough that there is a withdrawal phase\nwhere you will feel much worse and that\ndoesn't mean\nthat like the cannabis has been treating\nyou the whole time and has been doing a\ngood job of that it could very well mean\nthat you're withdrawing from it and part\nof our job here together is to to kind\nof slowly come off of it in a way that's\nsafe and that in a way that can help\nmitigate some of those effects as well\nin your experience michael how long does\nit take to recover from that\nhypodopaminergic\ndepression that you're talking about\nlike how long does it because what we're\ntalking about here is neurobiological\ntolerance right\nso so it's almost like caffeine where\nlike\nif i never drink caffeine and i drink a\ncup of coffee it'll keep me up all night\nbut if i drink coffee every day and i\nwake up i'm barely functional without\ncaffeine whereas if i detox off of\ncaffeine i'll be perfectly functional in\nthe morning\nso we're talking you're referring this\nhypo dopaminergic depression you're\ntalking about tolerance right\nyeah i guess caffeine is kind of a\nmicrocosm of it but yeah yeah\noh sure so so\nyou know what so like there's some\npeople who were you know terrifying\nwith our discussion people who have been\nusing marijuana since their teenage\nyears and are afraid that they've burned\ntheir iq points and are very hopeless\nbecause they're used every day and\nyou know when they stop using they\nexperience a lot of these like negative\nemotions like anxiety or depression wha\nwhat are we what are they kind of in for\nballpark in terms of like if i stop\nlet's say i'm a daily user of marijuana\njust kind of gut check and i recognize\nthis is probably highly individual as\nwell but you know what am i in for like\nhow long before i start equilibriating\nand can sort of get rid of that\nhypodopaminergic depression\nin terms of hypodopatic depression\nbecause we're talking about regulation\nat the receptor level this can\noftentimes take months\neven up to a year like it's it's a tough\nprocess and\ni think that's why you know coming off\nof sort of a high level of\nheavy cannabis use safely and or not\nsafely like in a way that's sort of more\ncomfortable it does take time and it and\ntypically like a tapering effect can be\nhelpful like coming down by like\nenter 20 like every month or two\nsomething like that a gradual taper with\nyou know there's medications out there\nas well that can help mitigate these\nwithdrawal symptoms too and that can\nhelp make it a little bit more tolerable\num obviously doing this\nwith somebody who\nwho's experienced um you know\nthe counseling of therapy is going to be\nimportant\nthings like that but you know a lot of\nthese\nif if there are symptoms of like lack of\nmotivation executive function\num\nemotional processing a lot of these\nsymptoms especially like people who\nstarted using you know in their adult\nyears can be reversible like once you\ncome off of it um so there's def there\nis hope and you know my hope is that\nyou know that\nin terms of the field of medicine that\nwe can be better at um\nbeing able to manage these these aspects\nbecause you know frankly speaking you\nknow many\nproviders out there you know they did\nthey did like a survey study like a few\nyears ago within like the last few five\nyears and like only half the primary\ncare doctors were comfortable really\ntalking about cannabis with their\npatients so\nin terms of thinking about like\nhow can we\nbe able to engage with people in an\ninformed way help them to think about\nthe risks and benefits properly with\ntheir cannabis use i mean obviously we\nhave a lot of research to do to be able\nto do that but a lot of it also has to\nbe like\nwe we need to be more informed and and\nmore helpful to people in terms of\nnavigating these spaces than\nwe have been and i think that's um\ni think that's the frustration point as\na provider but\ntotally a frustration point for people\nas well who are just wanting to use\nthese substances or wanting to use them\nfor helpful things but finding that\neither access to them or getting\ninformation from them is really\ndifficult\nso let's let's turn to a couple of these\nother things that you mentioned so you\nyou mentioned that uh\nyou know having a family history of of\nschizophrenia as like basically a\ncontraindication is the medical term we\nuse so\nyou know if you've had a history of\nschizophrenia either yourself or in your\nfamily members you should steer clear of\nweed what's the relationship between\nuh illnesses like schizophrenia and\nmarijuana use\nsure so i think there's a couple\nsort of links that we\nuh understand here and again like the\nevidence is still the body of evidence\nis still growing but you know one thing\nthat is really\nkind of signaled out in the studies are\nthat people who have a family history of\nschizophrenia or have a genetic\npredisposition to schizophrenia\nbased on a dose-dependent manner meaning\nthe higher thc content of cannabis you\nuse and the more frequently you use that\nand develop sort of are more likely to\nexpress their underlying genetic\nsort of predisposition to and express\nschizophrenia earlier in their life and\nare more likely to express it like four\nto six times\nhigher likelihood than if they didn't\nuse cannabis at all so that's why we try\nto\nquestion against using for people who\nhave uh psychotic disorders but\npsychosis is\nwe talk about long-term psychosis but\nthen in terms of short-term\nuh we also caution people who have\nschizophrenia you know from using hc\ncontaining whole cannabis products\nespecially of high thc content again\nbecause\nit can increase the\nthe um the likelihood of them expressing\num psychotic symptoms i have a patient\ni've been you know treating with for\nlike a few years now and\nevery time this person decompensates\nbecause they're using cannabis and it\nleads to sort of more sort of uh\nhallucinations and voices and things\nlike that i think one thing we haven't\nmentioned that's important to mention as\nwell is that cannabis can interact\nmedications as well\nthat's sort of an important point to be\ntalking to your doctor about and i'll\ngive you an example of this that like\nyou use a smoked product like cannabis\ncan\nbasically\noperate on an enzyme in your liver that\ncan\nthat can\nchange the doses of certain medications\nthat you're taking so for example in\npatients schizophrenia coming back to\nthis example\nthis person was on zyprexa or lanzipine\nwhich is an antipsychotic and using\ncannabis and higher doses of it can\nactually reduce the amount of the\nantipsychotic that you're getting in\nyour system so another reason why you\nknow we caution people from using\ncannabis especially on certain\nmedications is that it can it not only\ncan contribute to these episodes but it\ncan also limit the amount your\nmedications are actually helping you so\nit's kind of a double whammy there um in\na difficult way so that's kind of why we\nwe sort of see it that way for\nschizophrenia um another psychiatrist\nand let me just make sure i got this so\nit sounds like if you have a family\nhistory of schizophrenia and you use\nyou know as you mentioned whole\nwhat did you call it whole plant\nyeah whole plant forms of cannabis that\nhave hot or high thc contents\nit increases so if we just think about\nthis for a second\njust because you have a family a history\nof schizophrenia does not mean like if\nyour parents or one of them had\nschizophrenia let's say it doesn't mean\nthat you're gonna grow up and and have\nschizophrenia but what we do know is\nthat there's a genetic component that\nincreases your risk of having\nschizophrenia\nthen the problem is that studies show\nthat essentially if you\nlet's say i have one let's say i have a\nparent with schizophrenia so i have a\ncertain risk of getting it myself and\ni'm not sure exactly what that is i\nimagine it's less than 50 percent it's\nprobably what like 20 30\nuh i i i think it's it's still you know\nsignificantly less than 50 percent of\nmemory serves\num\nand then\nthe challenge though is imagine you have\ntwo kids in that family and they both\nare let's say born with a 20 risk of\ndeveloping schizophrenia and one of them\nuses a heavy amount of marijuana during\ntheir developmental years what you\nmentioned is a four to six-fold increase\nin risk\nright\nso\nand increasing risk of developing in\ntheir lifetime and\nincreased risk of them developing\nexpressing it early on in their lifetime\nis also something\nso so the other interesting thing there\nwhen he when i think when michael's\ntalking about expressing it early on so\nthere's also data that shows that\nthe earlier you get\naffected by schizophrenia generally\nspeaking the worst that you do\nso like people who get schizophrenia at\nan early age and for example don't\nfinish college\num and aren't able to enter the\nworkforce in like a substantial way like\nthose people tend to have worse outcomes\nin life like they're not as financially\nindependent their symptoms can get worse\nand things like that too\nso part of what we also see with people\nwho use marijuana is that they'll get an\nearlier\num\nthey'll get earlier they'll sort of get\nschizophrenia earlier which then sort of\nimpacts their life\nkind of more profoundly it's almost like\nyou know it has like a snowballing\neffect\nis is kind of the takeaway that i had\nfrom the people that i've worked with\nand so really using it early is like\ncan have a profound negative impact on\nthe trajectory of your life even though\nit feels like at the age of 14 or 15 if\nyou take a week or a month that you're\nusing versus not using it may not feel\nlike that big of a deal but if it\nincreases your risk and you manifest\nschizophrenia earlier and you're unable\nto finish school and things like that\nthat kind of stuff like snowballs\nand then like you're 20 years old like\nyou're not in college and then you kind\nof feel behind and you have difficulty\nlike socializing with other people and\nthat stuff then then you kind of get\nlike more depressed and i've seen these\ncases unfortunately a fair amount where\npeople just really struggle\nand\nthe the better cases i've seen\ndefinitely happen to people who are\nyou know get schizophrenia a little bit\nlater in life and have more stability\naround them\nhave more sort of social supports and\nthings like that around them and they\ntend to do a lot better\nyeah certainly the earlier you start\nusing it sort of the\ngreater especially starting during\nchildhood um\nand what about things like bipolar\ndisorder like what's your what's your\ntake on marijuana usage and depression\nor other kinds of mood disorders\ni mean there's um\nstarting with depression uh there's not\nreally good evidence that whole plant\ncannabis use is helpful for depression i\nthink we talked about this\nhypodopaminergic depression that we see\ni mean people who do use it sort of\nchronically and long term um\nsome small evidence uh i think we talked\nabout\nwell there's some\nuh trials especially short-term use of\ncbd for\nptsd the same thing with uh depression\nthat\num you know cbd uh operates on like the\ncb2 receptor but it also operates on a\nserotonin receptor called the 5ht1\nwhich\num you know can\nbe implicated in depression can be\nimplicated in anxiety uh cognitive\nflexibility as well or sort of our\nability to change the way we perceive or\nthink about things and that's sort of\nhow we think that ketamine might work as\nwell so working on sort of a receptor\nthat could potentially have therapeutic\nbenefits for i'm sorry can you say that\nthe 5ht 1 receptor you said is affected\nby cbd\nyes interesting\ndoes it have\nis there some suggestion that there's a\ntherapeutic benefit there or it like\nmesses with the receptor in a negative\nway or do we not know\nno we there's there's certainly a signal\nthat there could be a therapeutic\nbenefit i think the\nmost\nagain you know these are sort of sort of\nlimited evidence open label meaning not\ncontrolled trials people know what\nthey're taking so there is that placebo\nrisk but\num you know social anxiety cbd for\nsocial anxiety is one area of like a lot\nof interest and i think there is um\nevidence that that could be used\npotentially\nfor ptsd symptoms as well especially\nnightmares flashbacks things like that\ni've had patients who\nhave used cbd and that's been helpful\nand\ndepression somewhat insomnia is sort of\nthere's some evidence for that as well\nbut it's sort of not as fleshed out as\nsome of these anxiety\ndisorders are but there's definitely\nsome excitement around that and i think\nsome of that is\nis founded um\nyou know there's some evidence for\nyou know in autism and sort of\naggression irritability\num maybe adhd i mean we have like a\nsmorgasbord of different things um\nbut um\ni think the especially social anxiety\nand ptsd um\nthat's sort of where we seen garnered\nsome\nsome interesting like positive evidence\nfor so um so so michael i notice i i\nmean maybe you can explain this you'll\nsay there's some evidence for or there's\nexcitement can you help us understand\nlike what that means does that mean that\nthere's some evidence for\ncbd's benefit on the 5ht\none serotonin receptor therefore\ni can smoke weed as long as it's got cbt\nin it like what is it when you say some\nevidence for or excitement what do those\nterms mean help us understand okay so\ni'm meaning like uh concentrated so\nforms of cbd\nin like\nuh like epidiolex for example which is a\ncbd\nversion of it is basically cbd that's um\nsort of a prescribed uh\npharmaceutical and\nlooking at\nuse in\nin in conditions like social anxiety and\nptsd we've seen in short term like we're\ntalking about eight week trials like\npeople who take\nsomewhere in the range of like 200 to\n400 milligrams ish and we're still\ntrying to figure out where this dose\nrange is like the the and we as in like\nthe medical community\nthat um you know there there is some\nevidence that that that um people who do\nuse\na cbd over a period of time can\nand\nyou know develop improvements in in\nthese symptoms and not have\nsort of the um sort of the psycho act\nthere so cbd itself sort of\ndoesn't have the kind of psychoactive\neffect um that thc has\num psychoactive as in like sort of the\npsychotic producing effects or the\nanxiety producing effects\nthat thc have and sort of our\nunderstanding right now is that it\ndoesn't have sort of the addictive\npotential not nearly as much as we see\nin thc and cbd can even\nyou know there's some evidence that\nshows that it could even sort of start\nreversing some of these aspects when\ncombined with thc so i think that's\nwhere\nyou know\nthere is some excitement meaning like\nexcitement as in in the media or in sort\nof even like\nvery early\ntrials and animal models that like if\nyou combine cbd\nthc and other elements as well you might\nbe able to come up with a personalized\na product that may be able to\nalleviate certain symptoms you have\nwithout giving you that high that could\nthen produce you know that may have\nother problematic effects\nand um that might you know help you with\nthat condition but it's still very early\non in terms of evidence yeah in the\nsense that like it's too early for\npeople to like start recommending it\nyeah dude so so just to kind of like add\nsome context around that\nso you know if we think about a clinical\ntrial or we think about how science is\nconducted\nyou can have so michael mentioned an\nopen label kind of trial so so we think\nabout the gold standard of scientific\nevidence as the randomized controlled\ntrial which i personally don't think is\na gold standard but that's a\nconversation for a different day but um\nso the whole point is that you know you\nhave two groups they're randomized so\nthere's no selection bias into who gets\nput into one group versus another group\nwe have controls in place so like we're\ncontrolling for things like age and\ngender\nand other kinds of things so there are\nways that we can conduct science that\ngive us a strong amount of confidence\nthat we can make a recommendation\nand and right now what i'm getting from\nmichael is that the trials on cbd and\nstuff haven't reached that level of\nscientific vigor\nso what we sort of have is we may have\nwe'll take uh we'll do a survey\nof let's say\n30 people who use cbd and we'll ask them\nhow much does it help your anxiety and\nthose 30 people will say it seems to\nhelp a lot and so then what we'll do is\nis scientists will say okay so there's\nlike some kind of signal here\nbut we have no idea we haven't\ncontrolled for biases we haven't\ncontrolled for doses we haven't\ncontrolled like we don't really know\nwhat they're using or how often they're\nusing so we haven't controlled for all\nthis stuff so like even though there's\nthere's kind of like a bright point on\nthe horizon\nthat hey maybe there's something here of\nvalue\nwe haven't conducted enough rigorous\nscientific\ntrials\nto sort of really determine okay this is\na good idea or this is safe\nand and i what i'm getting from and even\nif we look at like a lot of the research\non psychedelics and stuff like that's\nkind of where things are now although\npsychedelics in some cases are a little\nbit further along but\nyou know it's like it's sort of like\nwe'll do an initial study with a small\nnumber of people without adequate\ncontrols and we'll sort of figure out\nokay is there something here worth\nlooking into a little bit further and\nthen we'll do a bigger trial with more\npeople and more controls and then we'll\ntry to duplicate that trial and then\nwe'll do a bigger trial and then we'll\nreally start to do like dose kind of\ntrials where okay what about 200 versus\n100 or 200 versus 400 or 200 versus five\nand then so what's the right dose that\nyou need to get this kind of like\nbenefit that we're talking about in\nterms of 5ht\none kind of activity that makes like\nreduces anxiety and so this is really\nfor for us to have scientific confidence\nthat hey as a medical doctor\nwe can or is the medical profession we\ncan say that this works or doesn't work\ni think this is where like there's a lot\nof confusion i think in in the lay\npublic about like you know the levels of\nevidence that we really have to get to\nand that you can have a trial that's\nvery promising early on\nbut and even michael mentioned like\nanimal models so people will do things\nwith rats\nand they'll they'll you know assess\ndepression and rats and they'll give\nthem cbd\nat megadoses because the other thing\nabout rat trials if you ever look at the\ndosing is it's absurd\nthey'll give rats you know\na hundred times the dose per weight that\nyou would give a human\nand then they'll sort of see some kind\nof like promising effect\num\nand anyway so i just wanted to kind of\nlike make sure that people understood\nthe context around\nyou know promising and excitement and\nand\nthat looks\nlike there's some possibility and for\npeople to really understand that you\nknow when michael says something like\nthat\ni i as much as people we got just got to\nbe a little bit careful about like\nto what extent people are interpreting\nthat as oh this is safe to do or this is\na good idea because i don't think we're\nreally there yet\nabsolutely i agree that completely um\nand so so you we've talked a little bit\nabout mood psychotic disorders anything\nelse that you kind of want to talk about\ntoday we've been at this for about\nalmost two hours now\num\ntrying to\nthink yeah i think\none thing to mention just along the\nlines of just cbd is that you know as\nmuch as i think\nuh people are feeling sort of the\nfrustration that there's like a lot of\nthese\nuh\nideas and products out there and you\nknow as doctors we're not kind of ready\nto\nstart prescribing using them at the same\ntime you know\ni'm feeling that as well in the sense\nthat like\neven if the evidence were to be there\nwe're still kind of far from being able\nto prescribe something like\na dialect\nor something like anxiety or social\nanxiety epidiolex is again the only\nthing that we could get on formulary\nhere\nin the hospital but even now like\ninsurance would not cover\nthe dialects which is cbd again you know\nthey wouldn't cover\nlike at this time\nuh that for like indications in sort of\nthe mental health realm so and and the\ncost is like tens of thousands of\ndollars we're talking like very\nexpensive so i think\ni think some of the frustration is that\nlike\nyou know even obtaining the cbd for\ntrials or even trying to use it in\nclinical practice in\nwith patients that maybe you know are\nnot responding well to other medications\nor wanted to use it in addition to those\nmedications is very difficult right now\ni think that's kind of why like we have\nwe as kind of doctors have to\nreally yeah at this time like really\nhelp our patients to navigate this field\nin a way that's so some people are also\nkind of talking a little bit about here\nwe are as two doctors talking about this\nstuff\num how do you think\nso how i'm trying to figure out how to\nphrase this question so you know there's\nan argument to be made that since we\ndon't use marijuana we don't really\nunderstand the benefits and we don't\nreally understand what we're talking\nabout how would you what do you think\nabout that right so here we are like\nwe're sort of like\nin our ivory towers in academia\nsort of talking about these studies and\nstuff like that how do we weigh\nyou know what we have to say against\nsomeone who's actually like used\nmarijuana and is familiar with it\nand can speak much more personally to\nthe benefits of creativity and\nyou know how it sort of helped them in\nso many different ways and help them\nmake friends and stuff like that because\nthat is the experience that some people\nwill describe right\nabsolutely and i think what we i think\nas doctors we\nsort of\nand to talk in terms of like probability\nand in terms of studies and we\nkind of like public health\nsort of promoting people and that's sort\nof a bias because we want to look at\npopulations and we want to have\npopulations grow sort of in a healthy\nway\nthat there is bias in that in\nacknowledging that there are people who\nmight be using these things\nsafely and not really like impacting\nsort of their mental health or other\nthings in ways that were\nare coming out of these trials but sort\nof\num are using it in those ways but you\nknow we you know obviously without our\npersonal experience in its in that in\nthat sort of way\nand um in our bias there like we're\nthat's something that we we don't have\nsort of\ninsight into um i think\nwe we have like a high bar for like\nevidence and trials and things like that\nbefore we use things we're very sort of\nadverse\neffective sort of people as a field it\ntakes a while for us to be convinced\nthat something works and that something\nhelps\nand i mean part of that reason is that\nwe\nwould hate for us as doctors to like\nrecommend something and then all of a\nsudden we find out later how bad it is\nand we've seen that being the case for\nopioids for example and i'm not saying\ncannabis is like opioids but i'm all i'm\nsaying is that like we have a pretty\nhigh bar for being able to say like\nokay this is something that's\nsafe to do this is something that you\nshould be doing among all these\nconditions and i think that\ni think there's certainly a bias for\nthat as well and\nbut you know i think i think it's\nhelpful to\nlisten to different sources and\nconversations about it and we might be\nable to speak to the harmful effects a\nlittle bit better and other people might\nbe able to be able to speak to the per\ntheir personal experiences better way\nbetter than us and\nyou know i think it would be completely\nthis is why i talked about bias in the\nbeginning because it would be completely\nsort of untruthful to say that\nyou know that we are able to provide a\nfull picture of the experience of\ncannabis and\nan unbiased source if anyone tells you\nthey're unbiased they are lying to you\nbecause it's either it's going to\nthere's going to be bias to every sort\nof every experience so i hope this is\nsort of just a part of people's\nexperiences they engage with so i i i\nthink you i liked a couple of the things\nthat you mentioned michael like so the\nfirst is that\nas medical professionals we tend to be\nmore sensitive to the adverse effects\nthan the benefits\nright so our profession is one where\nyou know if something helps people 75\npercent of the time\nbut hurts people 25 of the time that is\na terrible medical treatment so if we\njust look at like the rates of like\nadverse events\nwe ten you know that's not something\nthat we would i think almost ever use\nright the only examples that i can think\nof of you know things that have that\nkind of therapeutic index or like\nchemotherapy and stuff like that where\nit's like dire dire situations but\ngenerally speaking\nyou know i i think that's that's a big\npiece i think another big piece is\nuh so we tend to be\nmore risk averse as physicians than i\nthink some sometimes people use\nmarijuana are go ahead\nyeah so\nwe tend to be like very like medicine\nhas a bias of being like very\nrisk-averse right if you think about\nlike you go to your doctor and they give\nyou a treatment and has an 80 chance of\nworking and a 20 chance of causing harm\nlike no one would ever go to that doctor\nas as a field\nwe tend to be we have a bias towards\nbeing risk averse so we would rather do\nsomething that is effective like 95\npercent of the time and even like less\neffective\ni would take half\nefficacy at a 95 success rate over like\nyou know 95 efficacy 50 of the time\nand then like\nof a high chance of like causing damage\nlike we just that's a good inherent bias\ni think the other thing to remember is\nthat a lot of people who are you know\nproponents of marijuana use i don't know\nexactly what their sample size is\nand this is where in medicine we also\nhave a bias towards public health right\nso\ni i've worked with people that have had\nvery very positive experiences with\nmarijuana that they say you know hasn't\nnegatively affected them at all that's\ngreat\nbut what i'm really concerned about this\nis also true i mean so i've done a lot\nof this in terms of alternative medicine\nas well where\nthere's a ton of alternative medicine\nwhich i've found to be very very\nefficacious\nand shockingly so which i almost never\ntalk about because it has low\nreliability\nso\nit may be transformative\nfor one person's life\nbut like\nhalf of the people who try it get no\nbenefit or it even can hurt them and so\ni think the the other big bias that we\nhave in in medicine is that we tend to\nbe like\nso we're gonna undervalue an\nindividual's experience compared to\nwhat the average expected experience is\ngoing to be so we make decisions\nprobabilistically like i remember when i\nwas in residency\nyou know i learned a very important\nlesson which is that someone could ask\nme a question\nif i have major depressive disorder and\nyou start me on this medication\nor if if there's a patient\nthat has major depressive disorder and\nyou start them on an antidepressant\nmedication\nwhat is\nwhat amount of benefit can you expect i\ncan answer that question but if someone\nwalks into my office and says i have\nmajor depressive disorder if you start\nme on this medication what what benefit\ndo you\ndo you think i'll get and that's like\nactually a lot harder of a question\nbecause we can answer questions about\npopulations at whole because that's what\nclinical trials look at they look at 10\n000 people and what's the average effect\nsize but what happens in that 10 000\nperson trial is that you know 3 000 of\nthose people get way better 3 000 of\nthose people get like a little bit\nbetter and 3 000 of those people don't\nreally get better at all and then we\naverage all those numbers together and\nwe get sort of this like\nthis effect size which we then expect\nbut once you start practicing clinically\nwhat you begin to realize is that\neven though you can expect an average\neffect size there's actually like a high\ndegree of variance between individual\npeople and their experience their\nresponses to something like marijuana\num\nyeah\nthoughts\nyeah absolutely um and i think for any\nlike and i think you know\napplying that bias then to sort of whole\nplant cannabis you know\nif we see something like you said that\ncould have potential adverse effects our\nbar for being convinced that the\nbenefits are going to outweigh that risk\nis going to be much higher okay our bar\nfor whole plant cannabis to like\nlike saying that it could be safe and\nhelpful for people with mental health is\ngoing to be a lot higher if we see that\nthere are also a lot of people who may\nbe having these adverse effects\nand you know with cbd our bar\ni mean our bar for like\nsort of helping someone navigate through\nthat is going to be slightly lower than\nwith whole plant cannabis because we\nknow that the side effects mostly are\nlike gastrointestinal when we get to the\nhundreds of milligrams or like liver\ntoxicity and things like that but we\nkind of know how to manage that a little\nbit and there's a little bit you know we\nwe've seen clinical trials of cbd and\nepidiolex for seizure disorders we kind\nof know like short term maybe a little\nbit like longer term what it's going to\ndo and there's some certainty around\nthat\nwhole plant again has so many chemicals\nbeyond thc and cbd we just don't know\nyet given the uncertainty and given the\npotential adverse effects you know as\nclinicians it's like our bar just goes\nthat much higher in terms of like\nthinking about it and whether or not\nit's going to be safe or effective so\nmichael have you talked about delta 8\nthc have we talked about that because a\nlot of people are curious about delta 8\nthc\nyeah i mean i i don't know too much\nabout that to be very honest and you\nknow we as a field you know it's\nsomething that's hard to\nsort of purify out of the plant itself\nbecause there's very low amounts of it\ncompared to delta nine so it's not\nthat's not something i\nwould be comfortable sort of talking\nabout in a second like i don't i don't\nknow of the good evidence for against it\nso i'll sort of leave out myself out of\nthat conversation\nyeah i mean i think that's fair right so\nso and i think one thing to remember uh\nas as michael mentioned is that\ni remember seeing this study there was a\na paper i think by\nrich saper\ni don't know if you ran across him but i\nthink he's at brigham or bi but who is\nlooking at like the\namount of like what's in herbal\nformulation so if you like go to the\nstore and you like buy a bottle of\nyou know turmeric or something like that\nwhat they actually found is very similar\nto what you were describing which is i\nthink nine out of 16\nbrands that they randomly sampled\nhad little to know\nof the compound that was advertised if\nyou actually like check it by i think uh\ngas\nspectrometry or something like that i\nforget or chromatography i forget what\nthey used but\num\nand you know 7 out of 16 had some of it\nbut oftentimes like three or four of\nthose had like lower amounts than what\nthey claimed was in it so i think the\nother thing to just be super careful\nabout and and this is why you know i\nthink some people are also concerned\nabout us being like anti-marijuana and i\nthink that's where like you've got to be\ncareful i i don't know that we're\nanti-marijuana but at some point like\nyou can look at the evidence and you can\nsort of form a conclusion\nand so we've i think michael's done a\ngood job of sort of sharing what our\nbiases are right so we tend to be risk\naverse we tend to be population focused\nso any individual person may say oh but\nmarijuana works fantastic for me i think\nthe problem is that when you follow what\nthat person says\nwhat is the likelihood that your\nexperience is going to mirror that\nindividual person's experience i think\nthat's where and you can make an\nargument against this but i think that\nlike\nyou know the experience of\nyour experience isn't going to match\nperfectly the average of 10 000 people's\nexperiences but i think over time if you\nbase your decisions on the average\nyou're more likely to do well over time\nright so we're gonna have that kind of\nbias and you just have to be super\ncareful with things like delta eight thc\nbecause i have no idea who's regulating\nthat right what are you actually getting\nand the other problem that we see a lot\nwith this stuff like you know fentanyl\noverdoses and things like that is not\nonly is fentanyl more potent but like\nthere's no like i don't know how to say\nthis but when you get stuff from a drug\ndealer there's no guarantee of quality\nright there's you just don't have that\nso so that's where the risk is so much\nhigher for delta 8 thc maybe what you're\njust getting is is you know\nsome inert substance that because of\nyour placebo effect and because of the\necho chamber of your social circle you\nthink has this awesome effect\nbut there's just no way of like\ncontrolling that information and so\nthat's why you know i think that\ngenerally speaking\ni'm very hesitant about marijuana use\ni'm very hesitant about recommending it\num on balance i'd say like don't do\ndrugs kids\nand there's a reason why we say that\nright and the good news is that\nthankfully i think science is sort of\nprogressing to where we're we're\nopen-minded about stuff so we are\nstudying these things like psilocybin we\nare studying these things like mdma and\ntheir therapeutic effects\num\nwe are studying marijuana and its\ntherapeutic effects some i mean it's\nhard to do that research i think as as\nmichael mentioned but\nin the meantime like it's just i i've\njust seen so many people get screwed so\nhard by marijuana that like\ni can't recommend that anyone uses it\noutside of these specific as michael's\nmentioned you know fda approved kind of\nsituations\nbecause those are the situations in\nwhich on balance like the the risks far\nout i mean the benefits far outweigh the\nrisks\nand uh\nyeah with you uh there and you know\nthere are companies out there uh that\ntried to\num like test\nlike using sort of lab results like the\ndifferent contents of like cbd sort of\ngoing off of what you were saying\nearlier\num you know i'm not going to promote\nsort of any resources per se but like\nconsumer lab is something that it is\nunfortunately like a paid subscription\nbut something that that i've used to\nto navigate like what um how much\ncontent of cbd or thc are in certain\nproducts and they they try to do a good\njob and i can't say like how accurate\nthey are with it but i um all to say is\nlike as a consumer like definitely\nbe as informed as you can about these\nproducts and don't take for face value\nlike um sort of what you're told about\neven here in this room and\num and you know there's always going to\nbe biases i mean\nthe opposite end of things as well like\nwe see\nwe we recommend let's say like people\nwith depression antidepressants but\nthere's going to be small proportion of\npeople you know even though we see that\nantidepressants are effective for many\njust have a negative effect from it or\ndon't have any effect at all\nand sort of from their experience they\nmay feel like you know it's something\nthat's not helpful at all or even have a\nnegative expense uh negative\nfactors you know develop suicidal\nthoughts later on and you know can have\ntheir own experiences of it that you\nknow we don't capture and we you know i\nthink there's certain biases\nthere as well and it's totally fair to\nsay that like you know their experiences\nare completely valid\num and um you know and sort of their you\nknow people's understanding of the field\nof psychiatry or even cannabis in\ngeneral and\neveryone sort of is\napproved sort of to their own\nperspectives and views and and should go\nto different sources to get information\nones that are more valid than others so\nwell thanks a lot michael um do you want\nto\nor do you want to share a little bit\nabout if you want to where people can\nkind of find you in terms of socials and\nstuff like that or you want to just\nsteer clear of that\num i mean i do have a twitter it's\nsomething that i you know haven't been\nusing that often but it's something that\nif people want to engage in more\nconversation about i'm totally up for it\num it's you know i've mostly been using\nthat to share\npapers and journals and things like that\nand to connect with people in the field\nbut\nit's at michael hsumd\non twitter so happy to\ndo that and um\nyeah yeah thank you so much for coming\non and and sharing you know your your\nexperience and expertise on cannabis\num\nand\nyeah we really appreciate it man take\ncare yeah yeah thanks for having me alex\nyeah\nyeah so\num\nyeah i mean what did you what did y'all\nthink about that like\ni think we talked a little bit about\nschizophrenia\nright\nyeah so you know just to kind of like\nso i've been following chat and some\npeople are saying wow chad is so so\ntoxic so let's let's like\ngo\nreach to some of our\nhg roots for a second\nand talk a little bit about\nokay so\nif\nyou're watching something like this\nand you feel\ncombative or you feel\nupset or you feel\nattacked\nright so what i've what i tend to find\nis that when people talk about subjects\nthat are charged for some people the\nmost important thing for you to do is to\nlike understand why is what they're\nsaying bothering me\nlike i've seen these different kinds of\nyou know comments about like\nyou know\nanyway just people will say oh there's\nsuccessful people who use weed and stuff\nlike that so like just think about that\nfor a second like forget about the\nstatement and whether it's true or not\nand that's kind of i think what michael\nand i's point was we're not saying that\nthere aren't successful people who use\nweed that's not what our job is as\nmedical professionals i mean even here\ni'm not really acting as a medical\nprofessional but when i'm\nyou know\nwhen we think about when i'm sitting\nwith a patient the reason that i can't\nrecommend it is not\nlike we don't recommend things based on\nthe fact that there are successful\npeople who have done it so for example\ni've also met successful people who have\nbeen divorced twice and are on their\nthird marriage and are happily married\nand at the same time just because there\nare people who are who have been married\nthree times and are happy in their third\nmarriage does not mean that i can\nrecommend\nmarrying someone who's been divorced\ntwice\nin search of a happy marriage\ndoes that make sense\nlike there are going to be cases of that\nright but they're still like you can\nplay the odds\nand and that's where i think like in my\nopinion you know marijuana's kind of\nproblematic there because if you look at\nthe odds we tend to be it tends to not\nlook great\nso that doesn't mean that it doesn't\nhave a place somewhere it's just\nbased on the odds it's not\ngreat\nthe the next thing that and kind of\ngoing back to what i'm saying is like if\nyou feel like\narguing with us or you feel like this is\nbig pharma or whatever whatever whatever\nyou all want to do it's fine you can\nhave those opinions but what i would\nreally focus on if you really want to\nlike understand yourself better which is\nultimately what we're we're just going\nto disseminate the information based on\nour experience and expertise and you can\ndispute that if you want to that's\ntotally fine neither of us ever claim by\nthe way that we're you know know\neverything about marijuana it's just\nwe're sharing what we've learned\nbut if you get super charged or\ntriggered by what we're saying like i\nwould start by exploring where that\ncomes from\nright so if if you because i think like\nmichael was fantastic he's like at the\nvery beginning he's like everyone's got\nbiases we've got biases\nand we've done our best to even share\nwhat those biases are but if you kind of\ndefault to like oh big pharma like i\nmean i've seen comments that you know\nsleeping medication and marijuana is no\ndifferent like that i disagree with\nright because like and that's where like\ni i do think there's a big difference\nbecause one of them has been rigorously\nstudied and the other has not one of\nthem when you get a prescription for a\nsleep medication the dose that you're\ngetting is is\nbasically speaking guaranteed\nwhereas when you buy marijuana i mean\none of the big things that michael\nemphasized is that even the studies that\nwe have on marijuana are from like the\ndays when the thc\nconcentration was two to three percent\nnow it's like 20 to 30 percent so like\nhow does that affect\nwhat we can expect in terms of\ntherapeutic value we have no idea\nso i think there's a lot of stuff that's\ndifferent about medication versus\nmarijuana and y'all can say oh my god\ni'm i'm a\nshill for pharma which is fine but i i\nmean we don't really we're not here\nrecommending particular medications on\nstream right like we may at some point\nwho knows but generally speaking like\nthat's not something that we do\nand so this is where you know if you're\nreacting strongly to this\ni and even if you're reacting strongly\nin like a positive way like i would\nexplore where that reaction is coming\nfrom so if you watch this stream and\nthen the next thing that you're gonna do\nis go to your friend brother sister\nsignificant other kid and say hey watch\nthe stream see i've told you that\nmarijuana is bad and now these two\npeople on twitch are saying that\nmarijuana is bad see see i told you so\ncheck yourself there because what are\nyou reacting to\nso we're just sharing information\nand if you're reacting strongly to this\nin either direction like start by\nunderstanding what that reaction is like\nwhy do i feel so strongly about the\nsubject\nand sometimes it's you know it comes\ndown to like what was like recreation\nuse like we mentioned there's a question\nabout oh like what do you think about\nrecreational use and and like you know\nmichael was like oh i guess if you like\nuse it once a month like i can see how\nand then we ask chat but like no one\nwho's talking about recreational very\nfew people or not very few we have the\nstatistics right so based on a\npoll of twitch chat\n40 43 of people who are talking about\nrecreational use are talking about more\nthan once a day\nanother 16 to 70 are talking about once\na day so we're sitting at like 60\npercent of people are talking about\ndaily use which when they're talking\nabout recreational which is very\ndifferent from the answer that michael\ngave in terms of his assumptions about\nwhat recreational use was that was my\nexperience as well which is like\ngenerally speaking it's like the\nnumber's high right and and like 16 or\n17 was like less than once a month now\nthis wasn't a scientific study it's not\na random sampling\nwho knows who's trolling in this kind of\nthing\nbut this is my point is that like\nthere's\nthis is such a nuanced and individual\ntopic\nthat\ni think first of all y'all should be as\ninformed as you can be\nsecondly be critical\nof it right so everyone keeps on\nmentioning snoop dogg which is like sure\nlike\nyou know i would love to talk to snoop\ndogg about his experiences of marijuana\nright because he may have a different\nperspective to share\nand and that's where it's like you know\nthat's the whole point is like what we\ntry to do here share perspectives even\nwhen we talk about things like ayurveda\nor even like clinical explanations of\npsychiatry or meditation what we're\ndoing is sharing perspective we've never\nclaimed to be the arbiters of truth\nwhat we've done is a fair amount of\nresearch we have a fair amount of\nexperience and it's our job to try to\nshare that with y'all and for you all to\nthink critically about what we say and\ndecide what works for you and what\ndoesn't and especially when it comes to\nmarijuana usage highly highly recommend\nfor all of the reasons that we've said\nwhen we say go see a doctor about this\nstuff the reason for that is not like\njust go see a doctor it's like to\nunderstand that you know if you are\nusing it to having trouble difficulty\nsleeping there could be all kinds of\nreasons that you're having difficulty\nsleeping why not address the the root of\nthe insomnia\nmaybe you've got sleep apnea like who\nwho knows\nif you've got social anxiety maybe\nyou're hyperthyroid did you all know\nthat feeling anxious like part of the\ndifferential diagnosis for that is\ngetting is\na high level of thyroid hormone\nthis is why we recommend medical\ntreatment and sort of individualized\npersonalized decisions especially when\nit comes to things like marijuana\nbecause i don't think there is a\none-size-fits-all answer because even if\nwe say on average we wouldn't recommend\nit there are people out there who are\nsaying but there are successful people\nwho are on weed i use it recreationally\nit doesn't really bother me things like\nthat so on and so forth which is fine\nwe're not disputing that at all\nit's just if you're trying to make a\ndecision\nhow do you know what the odds are\nright because you have no idea like if\nsomeone else uses\nlike you know snoop dogg uses marijuana\nor so i have heard\nand the very successful very creative\nyou know\nif he says it's a huge part of his\nsuccess like\nthat's fine like the question is though\nif i were to take you know a thousand\npeople who make music and use marijuana\nlike where are they in terms of their\nsuccess\nright so i've heard i've never seen him\ndo it i've never seen a drug test right\ni don't know\nand and that's the real challenge with\nthis stuff because what happens is once\nyour mind likes a substance\nthen what it does is elicit its own\ncognitive biases\nso i don't like so this is like we're\ngoing to talk for a second about the\naddict's mind\nso the addict's mind once it likes\nsomething it will find whatever\ninformation it can\nto\nlike support what it wants to do and\nwill vigorously attack anything that\ndisagrees with it and if you guys have\nhad someone who's like in denial before\nyou'll sort of see that right and so how\ndo we know whether we can trust our mind\nthat's what i'm saying is judge your own\nreaction to what we're saying forget\nabout what i'm saying what i'm saying is\nright or wrong what's your reaction to\nit because that'll give you an insight\ninto your own bias\nright\nand like\nit's not our place to say you should do\nsomething or you shouldn't do something\nlike in terms of a moral personal\njudgment\nwe can say that okay and that's why i\nthink michael if you paid attention\nshe's talking about the risks right this\nis what we know from the research this\nis kind of why we say what we do and if\nyou're like pushing back against what\nwe're saying it's kind of like you know\njust think a little bit about where is\nthat pushback coming from\nand if you start to say that we're you\nknow farmer shells like that's you know\nthey surely aren't paying me enough if\ni'm a pharmaceutical but that's just\nwhere being a clinician i've worked with\na thousand people who've smoked\nmarijuana i've worked with a thousand\npeople who've taken antidepressants and\ni've seen like on average there's a\npretty different effect from both of\nthose generally speaking when i work\nwith people\nyou know who come in\nsmoking marijuana they tend to do better\nwhen we stop\nand and there's even you know if you\nlook at like the va the veterans affairs\nthe veteran study that michael talked\nabout people will use it\nto manage their anxiety or ptsd or\nwhatever right because it gives you the\nsubjective sense of okay this is really\nhelping my anxiety but then over time\nyour symptoms are actually getting worse\nand that's where that's a really\nimportant bias to understand about the\nmind which is that we don't know when\nour our cognition is impaired we don't\nactually know we have a subjective sense\nof what our creative output is but we\ndon't actually like measure it right we\ndon't do that as humans we just have a\nsense\nmy mind is like oh this is good and then\nif your mind likes something and is\naddicted to something it's going to over\ninflate the value of it\nin terms of an objective sense\nand so it's just tricky like it's sneaky\nsneaky mind so be careful about that\nyou"
