    "transcript": "how do you manage your emotions you must\nbecome adapt at managing your emotions\nwhat happened is there were people who\nwere addicted to substances\nand they leaned into oftentimes nowadays\nchristian ideology and they found that\nthat christian ideology was very very\nhelpful so it's kind of weird because if\nyou look at alcoholics anonymous what\nthey'll start with is that i'm powerless\nin the face of my addiction\nand that there's a higher power and only\nthrough the grace of that higher power\ncan i overcome this addiction\nand that sounds kind of like weird right\nso like if you're admitting\npowerlessness how is that a winning move\nwhen it comes to addiction an addiction\nhijacks your power\nright like that's how the addiction\nthrives the addiction tells you don't\nworry about it we got this we can handle\nit you'll be okay they won't find out\n[Music]\nwhat we're gonna do is talk about\neuphoria so for those of you that don't\nknow euphoria is a tv show\num on hbo and it centers around a lot of\nlike substance use\nand things that make people euphoric and\nwhat i really like about it is that it\nreally captures i think a lot of what\nmental health\nand mental illness\nlooks and feels like\nso i think the challenge with like\nclinical approaches to mental health is\nthat we don't really capture what the\nexperience\nof some of these things is so we'll have\nlike you know we'll have these\ndiagnostic criteria like if you check\nfive out of nine\nyou know boxes\nfor a particular\nfor depression then you have major\ndepressive disorder like if you have\ntrouble sleeping if you've had a weight\nchange if you're an hedonic which means\nyou have difficulty getting pleasure\nfrom things if you're suicidal if you\nfeel restless they're all these like\ncategories right and so we kind of like\ncheck them and it's very scientific and\nit's very clinical\nbut i think the challenge is that if we\nlook especially at psychiatry like\npsychiatry is not as\nscientific as other disciplines of\nmedicine so it's very scientific i don't\nmean to mean say that it's not\nscientific but it's not as like\nmaterialistic i should say it's probably\nas a better term so like psychiatry is a\nlot more like lived right so it's not\nlike i can biopsy you and diagnose you\nwith depression\ni can do surgery and remove a piece of\nsomething that will take away your\ndepression\nthat's not how it works so depression or\naddictions which we're going to be\nfocusing on today is such a huge part of\nlike who we are as people and not just\nwho we are as people but the people we\nsurround ourselves with as well as like\nthe society that we grow up in\nand so what i really liked about\neuphoria is that it really\ncaptures how entangled addiction is with\nevery dimension of someone's life\nso addiction is sure there's a genetic\nvulnerability but there's also like if i\nhave existential dread about my future\nhow do i manage those feelings and as\nwe'll see they even sort of touch on\npsychoanalytic theory based on you know\npsychoanalysts that were writing books\nabout this like 100 or over 100 years\nago so a lot of interesting concepts\nabout psychoanalytic theory genetics\ncircumstances\npeer pressure\nand just\nwhat drugs do for us and and why we use\nthem how they manage our how they impact\nour social relationships so just\nthe thing my experience as an addiction\nclinician has been that\naddictions can permeate every element of\nyour life who you hang out with how you\nmanage your emotions\nyour family relationships\nyour success\nyour in like your difficulty with\ndealing with the uncertain certainty of\nthe world and i think it really captures\nall of those things so let's kind of\nlike dig in to\neuphoria and specifically like what i'm\ngoing to talk about today we're just\ngoing to focus on the first 20 minutes\nof the show and the cool thing about the\nfirst 20 minutes of the show is you're\ngoing to learn so much\nabout mental health and how people\nnavigate mental health in a very like\num what's the right word in a\nnon-clinical way because mental health\nand mental illness is so much more than\njust like the clinical diagnosis and\ntreatment and that's what i really think\nis great so we're gonna learn kind of\neverything you need to know about mental\nhealth\nin 20 minutes okay\nso\nlet's start with this\nokay\nso it's kind of interesting so the show\nstarts off so there's gonna be spoilers\nby the way but not too many spoilers\nit'll be like the first 20 minutes\nso it's kind of interesting so the show\nactually starts off with\nthis image\nand it starts off with like\nthis\nfetus presumably rue who's kind of the\nprotagonist\nbeing in the womb right and what happens\nwhen we're in the womb is\nwe're content so if we think a little\nbit about like the womb right so the\nwomb is like a place where\nwe have an umbilical cord that's\nconnected to our parent our parent our\nmother usually\nand that umbilical cord kind of supplies\nus with everything that we need so all\nof our waste products like all of our\nthe results of cellular metabolism are\nsent out through the umbilical cord all\nof our glucose our fats are\nour everything that we need even\nhormones and things like that are sort\nof transmitted through the umbilical\ncord\nwhere we're very protected in this\nenvironment so we're filled the the\nuterus is filled with something called\namniotic fluid and the amniotic fluid\nlike protects us from things like bumps\nright so if if i'm if my mother is\nwalking down the street and and the\npavement is kind of rocky the amniotic\nfluid is going to protect me against\nvibration it's going to protect me\nagainst sound it's going to protect me\nagainst everything\nand so what sort of people realize is\nthat like the womb is sort of the\nperfect environment right it's dark it's\njust kind of filled with relative\ncontentment\nand the interesting thing is that\neven like psychoanalysts a hundred years\nago were talking about that and there\nwas a guy named otto rank who basically\nposited that the first major traumatic\nexperience that all human beings go\nthrough is birth\nso prior to birth we're perfectly\ncontent\nright and like we don't have any needs\nthere's nothing wrong in the world\nbecause we're not even aware of what we\nare but all of our needs are getting met\nand the second that we were born\nsuddenly like something drastic changes\nright so we're not\nthis is where things kind of like\nevolve\ninto discomfort so all of our needs are\nmet and then when we're born suddenly\nlike we're capable of feeling cold we're\ncapable of feeling hungry we're capable\nof feeling\nalone we're capable of feeling\nfrightened\nsuddenly like all of these things change\nlike we're not perfectly protected in a\ntemperature stable environment sites can\nbe scary lights can be bright sounds can\ndisturb our rest whereas in the womb\nnone of these things happen\nso otto rank sort of showed up and he\nkind of hypothesized that the most basic\ntrauma that human beings experience\nis the process of being born and there's\nsome interesting physiologic kind of\nconnotations to this so for example\nwhen children are born they have spikes\nof cortisol so cortisol is a stress\nhormone and literally that cortisol\nhelps with things like lung maturity so\neven the process of being born the\nstressful experience and all the crying\nthat you\nexperience has a physiologic effect of\nboosting your cortisol level and that\nboosting of your cortisol level actually\nhelps our lungs understand hey we need\nto start breathing and prepare some\nprepares our lungs for breathing which\nis why if we have premature babies\nsometimes what we'll do is we'll have to\nuse cortisol injections to prepare them\nfor birth and like being able to\noptimize optimally survive in the\nexternal world\nso there was a there are a lot of other\ninteresting psycho analytic theories\nabout birth trauma so people sort of\nposited that\nthe most basic\nform of anxiety or discomfort happens\nduring birth trauma so there was another\nanalyst named beyond\nbayern i'm not quite sure how to\npronounce it bion\nwho basically talked about how the basic\nimprint of anxiety and trauma is like\nthrough birth trauma so what he sort of\nnoted was that as we look at\nas we're born if you think about the the\nthe infant brain within hours of birth\nor even days or weeks of birth we don't\nreally like have the capacity to\nunderstand what's going on we don't even\nunderstand like what emotions are all we\nhave are these raw unfiltered\nexperiences\nso in this infant brain like you just\nyou just feel hungry right and you don't\neven know what hungry is\nall you know is that there are all these\nsignals\nthat are working their way through your\nbody that make you feel discontent and\nyou have no control like you can't\nyou don't understand what's going on you\nfeel bad you don't even know in what way\nthings are bad and you're completely at\nthe mercy of the world right do you get\nfed or do you not get fed you get cold\ndo you get changed do you get warmed up\ndo you get do they put a beanie on your\nhead do they not put a beanie on your\nhead so it's kind of this unfiltered\nroller coaster of negative experience\nfollowed by contentment hopefully in\nwhich you kind of like get milk drunk\nand you pass out and then you wake up\nagain and you're hungry and then you're\nback to this like unfiltered state of\ndiscomfort\nand so this was very very fundamentally\nanalysts sort of believe that this is\nincredibly traumatic and lays the\nfoundation on a very core level of\nanxiety\nand so if we think about what anxiety is\nanxiety is like worry about the future\nright what if things don't work out what\nif and if we think a little bit about\nhow does the human brain learn to fear\nthe future how does it learn to be\nanxious it's through this birthing\nprocess or at least that's the theory\nthat these people would posit right that\nsuddenly now you're in this world where\nlike you don't know how long the\ncontentment is gonna last and you're\njust getting bodied by all of these\nweird sensations you know frustration\nbeing hungry needing to get changed\nfeeling uncomfortable feeling afraid but\nyou don't even know what those are so\nthose experiences when sort of put into\nthe fetal mind or the infant mind are\njust so incredibly traumatic because\nthere's no way to process them\nthere are also like you know\ncriticisms or other perspectives on this\nbut i think it's really interesting that\nthe show\nessentially talks about this contentment\nas the beginning of things\nnow the interesting thing is that if you\nlook at a lot of this traumatic birth\nkind of stuff\nwhat they sort of talk a little bit\nabout is\nthe way that children learn to navigate\nthis in a healthy way or unhealthy way\nthe way that we learn that anxiety is to\nbe feared above all else or the way that\nour anxiety gets reassured is actually\nthrough our original like maternal\nparent or paternal bonding so when\nchildren are born they bond\nand this show also is kind of really\ninteresting because they talk a little\nbit about\num\nthis the state into which the main\ncharacter was born so the main character\ni think was born right around 9 11 and\nso they talk a little bit about how\ntheir parents for the first 48 hours of\ntheir life were just watching\nstuff related to the twin towers and the\nterrorist attacks\nand this kind of makes me wonder because\nlike you know this sort of\nbonding that happens between children\nand parents is so important and so what\nhappens to a child who is bonding with a\nmother or father\nwho\nare like concerned about 9 11 right so\nthe world was shocked people are\ngrieving people are like worried there's\na lot of uncertainty in the world people\nlike sort of think the world is going to\nend\nyou know it's very very shocking and if\nif the parents are sort of for 48 hours\nsitting in a hospital room where they're\nobsessing over 9 11 what impact does\nthat have on maternal\nchild bonding right because the\ninteresting thing to remember is that\nchildren when we're born we don't really\nhave logic we don't have really\nemotional awareness we have no way of\ncommunicating or understanding other\npeople\nall children have is empathy right so\nlike the most important circuit the most\nimportant way to communicate and\ninteract with a child is empathy so\nparents sort of develop a feeling for\nokay is this kid doing okay is it that's\nnot doing okay and similarly kids will\nbe exquisitely sensitive to the moods of\ntheir parents\nand for those of you that sort of grew\nup in households where unfortunately you\nexperienced some amount of abuse or\nmaybe like drinking in the house you'll\nyou'll remember that you were\nexquisitely sensitive to your parents\nmoods\nso we've had people that we've\ninterviewed and you know this is not\njust people we've interviewed here but\nthis is my experience as a clinician you\nknow if you talk to kids who grew up in\nabusive households they know within\nseconds of\nseeing the parent\nwhether they're in trouble that day or\nnot they they're exquisitely sensitive\nto the mood of others and so it starts\nto beg the question like if we grow up\nin a particular situation where our\nparents are grieving our parents are\nparanoid our parents are concerned what\ndoes that do to the anxiety that was\nlaid down by our birth trauma\nand this is where it's kind of\ninteresting because from the get-go\nwe can explore things like attachment\ntheory so attachment theory is this idea\nthat\nhow we relate to other human beings\ndepends on something called attachment\nand so whether we have secure attachment\nor anxious attachment or avoidant\nattachment or fearful attachment the way\nthat we fundamentally relate to other\nhuman beings gets kind of determined\nvery early on so let's explain this a\nlittle bit\nbecause this is important for for drug\naddiction as well\nso when i'm a kid\ni don't really understand the world\nright like the world sort of doesn't\nmake sense to me so the most important\nthing that reassures me the way i\nfundamentally get my internal anxiety\nabout the world re being reassured or\nnot is the consistency of the world\naround me\nso for example if you think about a\nchild who becomes confident with gravity\nright so like if i have a three-year-old\na three-year-old is like happy to jump\noff of sofas you know jump onto things\nroll around jump around jump on a\ntrampoline they're happy to throw balls\npick up balls\neven one-year-olds will like pick up\nfood and like drop it on the ground\nright so like\nkids are confident when it comes to\ngravity and why are kids so damn\nconfident when it comes to gravity even\nto the point where parents are like you\nknow have to you have to really watch\nyour kid because they'll do things that\nare unsafe when it comes to gravity\nthey'll jump off of things they'll jump\ninto things like you have to be really\ncareful about kids right where does that\nconfidence with gravity come come from\nit comes from consistency so the cool\nthing about gravity is gravity doesn't\nhave moods right like gravity isn't\nhappy one moment in pissed one moment\ngravity isn't sober one moment and like\ndrunk the next moment\nso consistency of parenting is what\nleads to confidence in the child the\nsecond aspect of of attachment theory\nthat's really really important is\nemotional mirroring which is related to\nthat consistency so the other thing to\nremember is that a one-year-old doesn't\nknow what they're feeling so how does a\none-year-old understand what they're\nfeeling what they actually do is look at\nthe facial expressions of the people\naround them so when a one-year-old gets\nhurt\nwhat do other adults do they pick up the\nchild and they're like oh a poor baby\nwith a baby\nis what to baby okay are you all right\nwith the baby\nright so as we do that kind of thing\nwe sort of like we show the child what\nthey should be feeling and so they\nunderstand what anger is because if\nthey're upset you know maybe we're gonna\nhave to discipline them if they're\nacting out and angry a child may have to\nbe disciplinary if the child is hurt and\nfalls down a parent will like pick them\nup and cuddle them and be like oh it's\nokay baby it's okay and then the other\nthing that happens is positive\nreinforcement is also emotionally\nmirrored in like a greater way so let's\nthink a little bit about you know when\nthe kid\ndraws something that is illegible and\nthey bring it to you with pride they're\nlike look daddy like look at this weird\nthing that i drew\nand as you show the weird thing that you\ndrew the parents are like oh my god\nthat's amazing look at that what is that\nby the way i can't really tell\nso what we tend to see with kids and\nearly on is that if parents respond to\nthem consistently in an emotionally\nmirroring and supportive way those\nchildren become\nsecurely attached they become\nconfident about the world and the reason\nthey're confident about the world is\nbecause the world makes sense right and\nyou compare that to\num you know children who grow up with\ninconsistent caregiving so this is like\na good example of\nwe'll kind of talk about a couple of\nthese examples\nso what we tend to find is that you know\npeople who are\nsecure have\nlow avoidance and low anxiety right so\nthey're like willing to engage they're\nwilling to try new things they're not\nlike they have confidence in themselves\nand then we also have like an anxious\nattachment which is like when people are\nare very very high anxiety\num but they're also they may be willing\nto engage with other people so this\ncomes from sort of inconsistent\nparenting\nand then you'll also have like avoid an\nattachment so i think avoidant\nattachments are very very classically\ncommon in terms of men who have\ndifficulty forming strong emotional\nbonds\nso in avoidant attachments what\nsometimes will happen is you'll have a\nchild that shares their emotional needs\nwhich are not met by the parent\nand so then what happens is the the the\nchild starts to resent the parent for\nnot meeting our emotional needs and then\nthey avoid the parent altogether so this\nis the kind of thing where if like if i\nshare emotional vulnerability and you\ndon't meet me where i'm at then i'm\ngonna start resenting you and then what\ni'm gonna learn is to be fiercely\nindependent right because like the\nlesson that i learned is if i share my\nemotional needs with people\nand they don't they don't meet them then\nlike i can't rely on people so it\ndoesn't necessarily make me anxious\nbut it keeps me like separated from\nother people so these are people who\nhave struggled to form connections and\nif we kind of think about it it's almost\nlike a protective model\nwhere people with avoidant attachment\nstyles will be like very very careful\nabout you know what kind of\nrelationships they form because they're\nafraid that like if i am vulnerable with\nyou like what's gonna happen i don't\nknow so the best thing to do is not be\nemotionally vulnerable to begin with\nso there are some interesting\nexperiments that kind of go into this my\npoint here is that generally speaking\nyou know this is protective\nagainst drugs\nand these three are not protective\nagainst drugs and the cool thing about\nthe show is that the show has different\nattachment styles that you'll see with\ndifferent characters that all relate to\nsubstance use in some different way okay\nbut the key thing here is that if we're\ntalking about the show like i don't know\nwhat impact you know growing up with 911\nhas on attachment now this doesn't you\nalso have to be careful i'm kind of over\ngeneralizing here because you know there\nare all kinds of kids that grew up after\n9 11 that have good and secure\nattachment who are alive today so you\ncan't really draw that one-to-one\ncorrelation but it just sort of makes me\nwonder a little bit because if we kind\nof look at the show the show really\nemphasizes some of these concepts right\nand like even in this is the first two\nminutes of the show or 160 seconds 90\nseconds of the show where they kind of\ntalk about the hand that rue was dealt\nwhen rue came into the world and that's\nsomething that i think is really really\nimportant to think about in terms of\naddictions so we tend to think about\naddictions as diagnoses right and we\ntalk about brain stuff and\nneurotransmitters and genetic\nvulnerabilities but the truth is there's\na lot of really core stuff involving\naddictions that i think the show really\nsets up very well\nnext up\nnow this is fantastic\nso\nwhat happens next in the show\nright\nso\nthis is actually before we kind of get\nto this i want to talk about one other\nthing\nso the other challenge right now that we\ntend to see i think with substance use\nis that\nif you really look at it objectively\nthis is this show sort of shows okay 9\n11 happened roo grew up in this kind of\nsituation it she grew up sort of in a\nworld of fear right so in the first 10\nyears of her life\nfor those of you in the u.s like you\nremember what the not post 9 11 world\nwas right was like right so we went to\nwar is the united states there was an\nemphasis on terror the department of\nhomeland security was created there was\na lot of like racism\nthere was a lot of discrimination that\nhappened and so like we kind of grew up\nwith this like once in a lifetime event\ni think if you look at substance use\nright so we're seeing that substance use\nis generally speaking getting worse or\nnot just substance use let's just talk\nabout addiction as a whole so it's not\njust like chemical addictions which are\ngetting worse for all kinds of reasons\nso some of the reasons that\nchemical addictions are getting worse\nsubstances are getting worse it's all\nkind of fascinating stuff so the first\nis that we've been breeding stuff to be\nmore\naddictive so if you look at the potency\nof marijuana the potency of marijuana\nhas increased drastically over the last\nlike 40 years right so people have been\nlike\nbreeding stronger and stronger strains\nand that doesn't even include the\nsynthetics so the other thing that we\nstarted doing is getting very very\ncreative with what kind of synthetic\nsubstances will make so there's like\nnative american you know spirits journey\njourneys that involve ayahuasca\nand now we've isolated dmt and people\nwill take dmt and they'll take different\nmetabol i mean a different kind of\nchemical modifications of dmt and so\nwhat we're seeing\nfrom addictions is that like\ndrugs are getting stronger they're\ngetting more potent they're also\nbecoming more nuanced so this is where\nwe'll get get into this in a little bit\nbut when you get into addiction you know\npeople have a drug of choice\nright so some people will really get\naddicted to one substance over a\ndifferent substance and why is that it's\nbecause their neurochemistry the way\ntheir brain is wired is just a little\nbit different there's studies that show\nthat you know the\ndopaminergic or reward response that a\nparticular addict gets from alcohol will\nbe different from what they get from\nmarijuana whereas another person may get\na huge response from marijuana and very\nlittle from alcohol\nnow what you do is you take a world\nwhere we have all these different kinds\nof drugs right so it's not just one type\nof drug it's not just marijuana now you\nhave sativa blends and you have indica\nblends you have cbd heavy stuff and you\nhave thc heavy stuff not to mention all\nof the different kinds of synthetic\nmarijuanas like k2 for example which is\nhighly psychotic and like doesn't really\ncalm people down it's like the opposite\nof cbd\nwhere people it gives people very very\npowerful experiences but also makes them\nlike kind of crazy\nwhen i was in residency so a huge\ndisclaimer by the way like don't do\ndrugs kids and this is a really really\ngood example of this so when i was in\nresidency in massachusetts\nyou know people would use k2 and like\nthey would get really really messed up\nlike mess themselves up permanently\nand it just messes you up so bad and\nwhat we're seeing right now in substance\nuse\nis that as we make five or ten different\nvariants of drugs what we're essentially\ndoing\nis selecting for all of the different\nvariants right so if you start using\ndrugs and you try out five different\nvariants of marijuana you may be able to\nfind the perfect marijuana blend for you\nwhich we'll get to in a second in terms\nof why people use it but then what that\nactually does is opens you up to more\naddictive potential and more\npossibility to like really screw up your\nlife so you got to be careful about that\nstuff\nbut the other thing that the show kind\nof highlights if we kind of think about\nit\nis some of this stuff about you know\ntragedy in the world so if we think a\nlittle bit about what environment rue\ngrew up in she grew up in the post 9 11\ndru\npost 9 11 world\nand this is the interesting thing about\ngrowing up in this generation not uh\ntalking about gen z so mostly all who\nare listening to this\nis that we've had like\nfour once in a lifetime crises within 20\nyears\nright it's kind of wild like if you\nthink about\nyou know\nwhat we what this generation has had to\ndeal with\nit's been like thing after thing after\nthing after thing\nand if we talk we'll get into this a\nlittle bit more but if we talk a little\nbit about what predisposes us to drug\nuse okay\nwhat we're gonna find is that like you\nknow this is the happy and content world\nand then you get born into a world but\nwhat kind of world do you get born into\ndo you get born into a world that's like\npost 911 and then like you know after 9\n11\nwe had the\n2007-2008 you know economic crash at\nleast in the united states and so that\nwas like a once-in-a-lifetime black swan\nunpredictable economic crisis\nand then we've got like climate change\nright so the world is like it's a little\nbit unclear whether the world will just\nstraight up end at some point right\nwhether there's some kind of\ncatastrophic collapse to our ocean\nsystem\nif there's a catastrophic collapse to\nour ocean system and like all the algae\ndies that's what actually produces like\ntraps the most greenhouse gases right\nalgae like or carbon fixers so they take\nco2 out of the environment they produce\noxygen and then like if they die like\nyou know the fish die and all that kind\nof stuff we could see a catastrophic\ncollapse\nto the world like we could be like\nliterally like apocalyptic kind of times\nright and no one really knows whether\nthis is going to happen or not happen\nsome people think we're overblowing the\nrisks other people think that this is\nwe're definitely on the path to destroy\nourselves within 100 years i don't\nreally know i've looked at a lot of\nscience it concerns me but it's not my\narea of expertise\nthe point here what we are focused on is\nnot whether the world is going to end or\nnot but growing up in a society where\nthere's like a lot of very strong\nscientific evidence that we're on the\npath to screwing ourselves\nright there's economic crises\nthere's climate change there's stuff\nlike 911 and by the way there's also\nthis global pandemic which basically\nshut down the world for two years\nright and like\nthe human rights related stuff that's\nhappening with covet as well like\nthere's all kinds of stuff going on\nand this is the the problem is that\nlike\nwhat is that doing to our psychology\nwhat is it like to be a 20 year old kid\nexisting in the world today\nand there's a counter argument here as\nwell where you can say that well like\nhumanity on the whole has gotten a lot\nbetter and like there's definitely an\nargument for that right so if you look\nat medical advancement like it's pretty\ncool that you know we've basically\neliminated polio through vaccines we've\nbasically we can catch we've essentially\neliminated cervical cancer or reduced\ncervical cancer drastically through the\nhpv vaccine so that's huge right people\nare dying of cervical cancer like i\nremember in culturally and like\nreligiously kind of the same thing\nyou don't name a kid until they're like\n30 days old in several cultures right\nwhy is that like why don't we why don't\neven we even give kids names it's\nbecause infant mortality used to be\nthrough the roof now people think about\ntheir kids names before even they're\npregnant like we take it for granted\nthat our children will survive right\nwhich is that is an assumption that\nhuman beings didn't have a hundred years\nago so there's absolutely been progress\nlike there's no question about that\nright so we've got like solar panels\nlike that's pretty cool we've got\nelectric cars like that's pretty cool\nwe've got technology and video games and\nvirtual reality and medicine is\nimproving that's pretty cool we're in\nthe days of like uber and uber eats and\nwe we have so much cultural exchange\nlike i can watch a korean soap opera if\ni want to like that's pretty cool\nso life has definitely gotten better by\na lot of objective measures as well\nbut when we think about the psychology\nof what it's like to grow up in the\nworld today we get bombarded by like\nsome really really scary stuff\nand what do we do about that right what\ndo we how do we manage that like it's\nlike okay so you're telling me i have to\ngo to college right and the reason i\nneed to go to college is so that i can\nget a good job the reason i can get a\ngood job is so that i can be financially\nindependent and then presumably get\nmarried and have kids and all this kind\nof stuff but like what if the world ends\nin 20 years\ni've had several patients talk to me\nabout they're afraid to have children\nand it's like why is that well it's like\ni don't want to bring a child into a\nworld that's like apocalyptic because\nthe\nthe climate is collapsing and then like\nhuman beings die like that's terrible\nlike i don't want to do that\ni've had patients who talk about\nthe anxiety and concern about bringing\nchildren into this world which i'm sure\nto some degree has always been there\nright so every generation is concerned\nabout the world ending\nlike\nin the next hundred years i'm sure that\nthere are people who sort of do that but\nare concerned about that but i really\nthink that\nour exposure to this kind of information\nthe volume at which we get it because\nit's always one disaster after another\nright which is has something to do with\nthe internet in the way that we consume\ninformation the way that information\nfloats to the top so what information\nfloats to the top the information that\nis emotionally charged\nthat's what we react to\nand so what ends up happening is we see\nthe most emotionally charged stuff\nfrom all over the world day after day\nafter day after day\nand what impact does that have on our\npsychology well it's like\nokay i've got a choice between this\nor this and this is what i want\nright i want to go back to the womb\nwhere like\nthere was no sense of you know things\nare going to hell in the womb in fact\neverything was perfectly content\nokay\nso now you get kids\nwho are growing up with some amount of\nexistential dread\nand this is where things are gonna get a\nlittle bit tricky\nso then what happens is like you'll get\nsome kids right and here's the thing\nkids are unique not all kids are the\nsame i don't know if you guys can kind\nof see this one but she's just she's\ncounting up here so she's just like\ncounting things\non the\nceiling and then the parents like look\nat the kid and they're like wait a\nminute i don't understand what my kid is\ndoing\nso i want you to think a little bit\nabout you know if roo was born 200 years\nago and she was counting\nobjects right maybe a little bit of like\nobsessive-compulsive tendencies\nwhat would a parent do a parent would be\nlike i don't really know what's up right\nwe didn't have answers for everything\nback then but now living in the\ninformation age it's very subtle\nbut we look at something and we see a\nkid and we don't understand what they're\ndoing they're maybe a little bit unique\nit's a little bit of a strange behavior\nand then like the parent is like okay\nwhat is going on because there's sort of\nthis assumption that there is an answer\nout there and i don't know if that makes\nsense to y'all but like 100 years ago\nyou know there wasn't wikipedia like we\ndidn't have answers at our fingertips in\nfact like most human beings like didn't\nreally have answers to stuff which is\nwhy religion used to be so big so\nreligion would give us some vague sense\noh this is just like god makes each and\nevery one of us in in a particular\nunique way okay\nperiod right is rue really doing\nanything that's problematic in this\nscene like no she's just like counting\nstuff maybe a little bit distracted from\nher dinner like maybe that's you know\nthere's just something like a little bit\nweird like our kid is doing something\nthat's a little bit sus completely\nnormal\nbut\nnowadays we need answers for everything\nright because we've grown up with the\nassumption that there are answers for\neverything there's a reason i'm doing\nthis there's a reason my kid is that way\nand what's even more terrifying is if\nyou're a parent\nwhat if you're like\nmessing up right so you want to be a\ngood parent and your kid is doing\nsomething that you don't understand so\nwhat do you do if your kid starts doing\nthings that you don't understand you\ncan't let uncertainty be a part of it\nbecause what if you screw up what if\nyou're missing something what if\nsomething is going on because everyone's\ntalking about mental illness what do we\ndo\nwe take him to see a psychiatrist\nright\nwe're like oh i don't understand what's\ngoing on here\nso let me go take my child to get help\nand so now we get into the bucket of\npediatric diagnosis\nand this show i think does a good job of\nsort of sharing some of the frustrations\nwith it the reality of it is that this\nwould never happen in real life like\nthis would never ever ever ever ever\nhappen but i think it captures or is\nhyperbole for one of the points\nso this is where she gets diagnosed with\nocd\ngeneralizing anxiety disorder adhd\nbipolar disorder but maybe she's a\nlittle bit too young we can't really\ntell\nthere's also this sort of idea that we\nthink that psychiatric diagnoses\nhave to happen because of drastic\nnegative things so she talks a little\nbit about like she wasn't physically\nabused or like didn't grow up grow up in\nlike a situation where she didn't have\nclean water like there was nothing\nreally traumatic right\nand so we sort of assumed that okay the\nkids who get psychiatrically diagnosed\nor kids that like grew up with traumatic\nsituations like parents who are using iv\nheroin and that's how you get kind of\nmentally ill as a kid so there's kind of\nlike a lot of really good things in this\nimagery where where essentially what\nhappens is is we you know take people to\npsychiatrists\nthey see something unusual\nand they like\nyou know they go looking for a diagnosis\nand this is where there's kind of this\nfunny sort of thing about medicine which\nis that if you take people\nif you if you take someone to a doctor\nthat doctor will diagnose them with\nsomething right so this is kind of like\na funny sort of scenario but a family\nmember of mine about it\n10 15 years ago\nwas having a medical problem and what\nthey did is they went and saw three\nspecialists\nand each of the specialists gave them a\ndifferent diagnosis they gave them a\ndiagnosis from their specialty so i'll\ngive you all like kind of a good example\nof this a simple example so there's now\na condition called ibs which is\nirritable bowel syndrome\nso irritable irritable bowel syndrome is\nsort of like this non-specific condition\nwhere your bowels are kind of irritable\nlike that's just what they are so\nsometimes you get diarrhea sometimes you\nget cramps sometimes you get\nconstipation there's no like real blood\nin the stool biopsies don't really show\nanything\nlab tests are pretty\nnon-specific it's not like you have an\ninfection you know if you do a stool\nculture you're not going to grow out\nlike parasites or anything like that but\nsomething's just like our bowels are\njust kind of messed up right so it's\nlike you go to a gi doctor they'll\ndiagnose you with ibs\nyou go to a psychiatrist they'll\ndiagnose you with generalized anxiety\ndisorder because anxiety has\nstomach components with it so sometimes\npeople with anxiety can get their bowels\nmessed up right so you can get diarrhea\nand stuff like that\nyou can go to an endocrinologist and\nthey may diagnose you with something\nelse so this is the kind of thing where\nif you like show up to\na see a psychiatrist they're gonna do\ntheir job which is diagnose you with\nsomething\nand there's another like subtle problem\nhere which is that\npeople tend to get tacked on like\ndiagnoses so you'll see this a lot\nunfortunately maybe you all have been\nthrough this as well\nwhereas like you'll you'll get diagnosed\nwith the first thing like you'll get\ndiagnosed with anxiety generalized\nanxiety disorder\nyou get started on a medication and then\nif something happens like let's say\nyou have a traumatic breakup and then\nyou end up feeling suicidal and you go\nto the hospital\nwhat the people at the hospital are\ngonna do they're gonna say okay you've\ngot generalized anxiety disorder you're\non medication for anxiety so and you're\nin the hospital\nso like there must be something else\nright because the the medication you're\non is treating the anxiety so there's\nlike another disorder that has been\nmissed\nand since there's another disorder that\nhas been missed because the anxiety was\nbeing treated by this let's tack on\nanother diagnosis oh so now you have\nbipolar disorder and generalized anxiety\ndisorder but it's really hard to go back\nand wipe away the generalized anxiety\ndisorder because that's also where like\nas a clinician if you're diagnosing\nsomeone with bipolar disorder\nyou don't know\nwhat the person who diagnosed them with\ngeneralized anxiety disorder saw right\nso you don't know if they were seeing\nbipolar\nand just misdiagnosed it or\nout of like your own humility you're\nlike maybe they just saw anxiety and i\ncan't see the anxiety because the\nbipolar is active right so it's like a\nreally like i don't know if i'm missing\ny'all here if that's a little bit\ncomplicated\nbut if there's like active bipolar\ndisorder like that may drown out the\ngeneralized anxiety disorder so then as\na clinician you're left kind of confused\nbecause you're like is this anxiety plus\nbipolar\nor was it bipolar all along well i don't\nknow because i wasn't there i didn't see\nwhat that person saw so maybe that\nwasn't bipolar\nand then what happens is you like the\nsafest thing to do because you don't\nwant to like under diagnose right so\nlike think about it you don't want to\nlike\ntake away generalized anxiety disorder\nfrom their chart if that's what they've\ngot because then you're signing them up\nfor suffering because now we're just\ntreating generalized we're treating\nbipolar disorder and then their anxiety\nis now untreated and you're sending them\nout the door like setting them up to\nfail because you've taken away treatment\nthat could be really helpful for them so\nwhat do you do\nyou tack on bipolar\nand then something else happens another\ntraumatic breakup\nright\nand then like they get sent back to the\nhospital because sometimes people get\nsuicidal\nand then it's like well okay well hold\non a second they've got anxiety they've\ngot bipolar there are medications for\nboth of these things that's not enough\nwe're missing something else aha\nas we tunnel down further tunnel down\nfurther ah there's trauma so now you get\ntacked on a ptsd\nright and so what happens is we build up\nthese diagnoses for people\nover time and you get diagnosed with\nthis and this and this and this and in\nthe show i mean there's there's no way\nthat this would actually happen where\nlike you know they're diagnosing a kid\nwith like four things at the same time\nnot gonna happen\neven people are not that negligent\nbut i think the show does a good job of\nhighlighting that this is what happens\nespecially to like kids right where like\nwe don't know what it is the parents are\nconcerned so like it kind of fits some\ncheck boxes and this is a problem with\npsychiatric diagnosis because there's no\nbiopsy there's no x-ray\nall we have are check boxes and i'm sure\nthat y'all can understand that like i\nmean maybe maybe i'm taking this for\ngranted but\nyou know the check boxes for anxiety the\ncheck boxes for bipolar and the\ncheckboxes of ocd\ncan overlap quite a bit\nright like if i'm ocd\nand i'm not able to control things\nproperly i'm gonna get really really\nanxious\nthe experience\nof people with ocd is oftentimes anxiety\nbecause if you think about it like if i\nhave ocd and i have to turn on the light\non and off the light switch 15 times\nright\nbefore\nlike and if i don't do that everyone in\nmy household is going to die from a\nmeteor strike that's literally the kinds\nof thoughts that people with ocd have\nwhat do you imagine my internal\nexperience is going to be it's going to\nbe anxiety\nso i i go to a psychiatrist and say i'm\nanxious all the time or my friends\nsee me and they say oh you're like\nyou're super anxious you need to relax\nand you go see a therapist\nand then you go to the therapist and you\nsay\nhey and the therapist asks you like why\nare you here today and you're like well\nmy friends think i'm super anxious so\nthen i need to chill out\nand the therapist is like okay so tell\nme about your anxiety well i'm like\nworried that people like bad things are\ngoing to happen to people that i love\nokay tell me more about that now\nhopefully you have a competent clinician\nand the competent clinician actually\nassesses you for ocd which is what\nthey're supposed to do\nbut this is where like unfortunately we\nlive in the real world where you know\npeople get a certain amount of time for\na diagnostic assessment sometimes\nclinicians are burnt out\nlike and you just answer questions in a\nparticular way and like you think you\nhave anxiety and one of things you learn\nin medicine is that learn to trust the\npatient right honestly i'm not kidding\nso i've had like patients come in and\nyou know they're like i'm afraid\nsomething's wrong with me and we do\ntests and stuff and we're like we don't\nthink anything's wrong with you like\nsomething's wrong with me it's like okay\nlike let's take that seriously let's do\nlike more tests let's try to figure this\nout because patients know their bodies\nbetter than doctors do\nright so we listen to the patient\nso sometimes they get diagnosed with\nanxiety when really what they have is\nocd\nand so they get treated for the anxiety\nbut they don't get treated for the ocd\nand then\nlater on a clinician comes along and\nthen like\nassesses them for ocd and this is oh\nthey've got ocd and then that clinician\nhas the same problem\nnow okay so i diagnose ocd but does that\nmean that the anxiety was the ocd or did\nthis person see something else\nthat is now being medicated and treated\nby this treatment so it's actually like\ngeneralized anxiety under control\nyou all get that\nlike it's really hard as a clinician so\ni'm not sort of blaming that i'm not\nblaming clinicians here but\nunfortunately like this is way too\ncommon\nwhere kids will like get diagnosed with\none thing and another thing and another\nthing and we don't have biopsies to\ndiagnose you with major depressive\ndisorder or ocd and we sure as hell\ndon't have x-rays to rule out\npsychiatric diagnoses so it is so hard\nto get a psychiatric diagnosis taken off\nof your chart\nright like it's like how do people know\nlike we don't know\nfmri doesn't do it my friends\nsorry\ni'd love it if it did but it just\ndoesn't do it\nokay\nso i think the show does a great job\nthis is also like the first two minutes\noh man so the next part is even worse\nokay\nso\nthe most terrifying thing\nas a child\nis when your parent starts\nmanically reassuring you\nfor something that isn't wrong\nright\nso they're like like you're just a kid\nyou're just you\nand then suddenly your parent shows up\nand says honey it's just the way that\nyou're brought\nyou were hardwired plenty of great\nintelligent funny and interesting people\nhave what you have struggle with the\nsame things you struggle with but like\nhere's the thing i want you all to\nunderstand this this is not a struggle\nthe kid is fine they're just counting\nright\nyou'll get that\nlike i'm not saying that the kid doesn't\nhave ocd and doesn't need treatment and\nstuff like that but this is the other\nthing that tends to happen is that\nkids who get diagnosed with something\nthey're not broken in some way like and\nthat that maybe is a statement that i'll\nget in trouble for but i really as a\npsychiatrist i don't view that child as\nbroken\nand these statements are true right like\nsometimes people are just wired\ndifferently\nbut then it's like you're you're the kid\nand you're like\nwhat's going on like i'm confused\ni went and i saw the doctor and now i\nhave to take these pills\nand there is mom with a huge smile on\nher face right look at how oh honey\nhere take this medicine your brain is\nwired differently and there's nothing\nwrong with you you can be so successful\nlots of brilliant people\nwho are just like you are hun\nand then like it confuses\nthe hell out of the child\nthey're like what is going on here i\ndidn't think that\ni'm just counting yo\ni like to count it makes me feel good\nabout myself\nand this is what parents do because\nparents it's not their fault\nbecause parents are terrified right when\nthey see like\nlook at this look at this facial\nexpression right the parents are\nterrified they're terrified of all of\nthese diagnoses what does this mean for\nmy child oh my god i'm so scared i'm so\nscared i'm so scared and look at the kid\nthe kid has no idea what's being said\nbut what's the kid's facial expression\nkid is matching dad kid doesn't know\nwhat the hell is going on but they know\nit ain't good and then mom shows up with\nsmiles hey everything's gonna be okay\nbecause the parent too the parent wants\neverything they're devastated parents\ndevastated on the inside but we can't\nlet the child be devastated we can't let\nthem know that oh my god they're taking\nall these pills because they're crazy\nso we see this like false positivity\nthat the parents are like oh like\npeople have struggled with what you've\nstruggled with right like you can be\nokay like everything's gonna be great\nlike you're gonna be awesome there's\nnothing to worry about\nand the kid was like i'm just counting\ni wasn't worried to begin with\ni was okay\nright\nand so there's this this discrepancy\nbetween the way the parent feels and the\nway they act and that can really mess\nkids up\nso now it's like confused\nbut there are a couple of other things\nthat the kid learns right okay so if i\nfeel bad\nmaybe these are the antidote\nand then we get into this which is\ndevastating so like\nit's so beautifully written so just that\nthe world move moved fast and my brain\nmoved slow\nright and so like what starts to happen\nwhen you when you get medicated\nis that like some of these medications\nso i don't know what this i don't know\nwhat these are\nbut let's assume that they're started on\na mood stabilizer you would we wouldn't\ndo this all at once this is terrible no\nclinician would do this\nyou get started on a mood stabilizer\nan ssri may be like some kind of\nanxiety anxiolytic medication\nand what are those going to do they're\ngoing to slow you down a little bit\nso the hardest thing that i've struggled\nwith as a clinician is like\nmy patients with bipolar disorder really\nreally dislike the medicine some of the\nmedicine anyway\nbecause they feel like it slows them\ndown especially if they have a creative\ninterest and this is really interesting\nbut you know this statement this isn't\nwrong\nso a lot of like very funny interesting\nand creative people do have mood\ndisorders\nand i call it something called the\nartistic temperament i've worked with a\nlot of people and i work really hard to\nreally minimize their medication\nbecause the truth is that\nthose experiences of depression or mania\nare what\nis what inspires these people to create\ntheir art\nit's like understanding the depths of\ndespair and suicidality which then you\nput into a piece of art that is powerful\nand resonates with the community and\nlike\nmakes your art magnificent\nright and it's the price that we pay for\nbeing geniuses and like our mental kind\nof gets busted as a result or there's\nsomething there where i've just seen\ntoo many successful artists\nstruggle with mental illness\nand and it's it's it's really hard but\nlike i think that there's absolutely a\nway to kind of navigate that in a for\nforward and a healthy way the first is\nit helps the artists that i work with\nwhen i'll sort of share with them like i\nthink you have the artistic temperament\nand they'll be like what is that it's\nlike yeah we can diagnose you with\nsomething sure\nbut i think that you need to understand\nthat like this is what makes you great\nright these experiences that you have i\nunderstand they make you suffer we're\nnot going to try to like let them go\nunchecked\nright and the real the real pathway\nforward\nis\ntrying to figure out how we can act\naccess that authentic\nsuffering part of you\nand yet not let that part take over your\nlife\nand my goal as a clinician when i work\nwith people who have the artistic\ntemperament\nis to somehow let them create art\nwithout sacrificing everything else\nbecause that's oftentimes what they have\nto do\nbecause they're like you know when\nthey're when they're you know hypomanic\nand they're painting for 20 hours a day\nand they create this like\nlife-affirming artwork it's like they're\nnot paying their bills they're ruining\ntheir relationships\nthey're losing custody of their kids and\nlike that's not worth it or maybe it is\nit's not for me to say but as a\nclinician my job is to help you create\nthat art while at the same time like\nhelping you put together a life that is\nlike stable and worth living\nand so this is the experience of people\nright that the world moved fast and my\nbrain moves slow\nand then you find yourself like trying\nto outrun your anxiety and the truth is\nit's exhausting\nit's just exhausting that's the best\nword for it\nso now what happens is i want you all to\nthink about this for a second\nso like you're a what 12 year old 13\nyear old kid you're in you're in middle\nschool\nand like middle school is hard enough\nbut if you have anxiety\nif you have medication everything\nbecomes harder\nboth of them make things harder right\nideally i mean in a good clinical\nscenario you know i've seen this for\nkids as well where medication can be\ndrastic and it just makes your life feel\nfantastic like you just it really fixes\nthe problem and allows you to live life\nthat's the purpose of medication\nright we want to use it to the point\nwhere it doesn't make your brain move\nslow it just makes it so that you don't\nhave to outrun your anxiety\nlike that's the goal of medication is to\nlet your brain\nbe calm so that you can enjoy\nlife\nbut oftentimes what we tend to see is\nthat it makes life just exhausting\nyou're outrunning your anxiety one\nmoment you're struggling to understand\nmath the next moment because you're on a\nmood stabilizer that slows your\ncognition a little bit\nright and that's just how you feel\nand so like this is your life like you\nforget about existential dread and all\nthat crap\nwhich has been baked into this person\nfrom birth\nbut life is just hard\nyou're tired of it\nand so this is where we start to get\ninto identity\nand so at some point\nyou know this is the this is the scene\nin the movie where\nmom distrusts rue and rue basically\nsmuggles fake urine in to dodge a drug\ntest\nand this is this captures so much about\nwhat it's like to be an addict\nso the first thing that i want you to\nunderstand is that\nyou know at some point your symptoms\nstart to become you\nso at this point\nwe have a diagnosis the diagnosis is\nseparate from you\nand then it's the way our brain is wired\nand now you find yourself trying to\noutrun your anxiety\nright so there's still your anxiety and\nthere's the you\nand at some point\nit becomes who you are\nso you become an addict it becomes the\nperson that you are if i could be a\ndifferent person i promise you i would\nthey don't ask for this\nright rue didn't ask for this she didn't\nask for this she didn't ask for this she\ndidn't ask for this\nshe didn't ask for this and she sure as\nhell didn't ask for that\nright\nand so\nwe hate being addicts\nwe wish we were different\nwe wish\nwe were so different\nright\nbut\nthis is where i think things get really\nchallenging\nso\nthe challenge is that like we're in this\nworld\nthat is full of existential dread\nour brain is hardwired a particular way\nwe didn't ask for it\nwe just kind of show up one day\nand\ni just showed up one day without a map\nor a compass or to be honest anyone\ncapable of giving me an iota of good\nadvice\nright and we have our mom who's like did\nyou eat breakfast this morning\nand this i think is a consequence of\nthis is i it's a it's a beautifully\nwritten\nset of dialogue because i i think it\ncaptures\nso much about what's wrong wrong with\nour world right now\nand what's going on is like rue is a\nperson\nright that this is a whole person\nthe problem is that what we've managed\nto do\nis separate out all of the aspects of\nthe person\nso if you've got a disease go see a\npsychiatrist and take these pills and\nit'll fix that\nright\nlike if you have body image issues like\nor peer pressure things like that that's\nsomething that the school should handle\nso the therapist should handle this the\nschool should handle this\nthe psychiatrist who's prescribing your\nmedication is supposed to handle that\nremember those aren't even the same\nanymore\nand then the parent is supposed to make\nsure that you eat\nright but like\nwho is supposed to help you with all of\nit\nbecause the psychiatrist isn't going to\nbe asking about your diet\nyour coach in gym class is not going to\nbe asking about your medication\nand your mom is not going to ask you\nlike it isn't like gonna help you with\nthe existential dread\nright because mom is just worried about\nmaking sure you get your meds\nthere's a\nyou know like\nthey're just gonna make sure that you're\ngetting fed which is all they can handle\nthere's another scene here where mom is\nlike frustrated on the phone trying to\nfigure out like how to get how to pay\nfor rue's treatment\nright so mom's got a lot on her plate\nlike i'm not really faulting her\nand this is the problem is that if we\nlook at a human being like it's all of\nthis stuff\nright it starts with here it starts with\nthis it moves on to this\nmoves on to this moves on to this moves\non to this\nand like how do you who is going to help\nyou with the fact that you're just\nexhausted as a 13 year old and the world\nis moving fast and you're moving slow\nand your brain is moving slow\nwho's going to help you with the fact\nthat you're trying to outrun your\nanxiety but you take it with you\nwherever you go so you never succeeds\nwho's going to help you with all this\nlike what am i supposed to do with my\nlife how do i handle these feelings what\ndoes this mean for my future forget\nabout the feelings like they're the\ntherapist is talking to you about your\nfeelings but like what is the therapist\nactually going to do about climate\nchange\nbecause that's a valid fear right\nit's like sure i can go see a therapist\nbecause i'm depressed because i have\ncrushing student loan debt\nu.s once again\nbut like what is the therapist gonna do\nabout that oh my god that must be so\nhard for you yeah you're damn right it's\nso hard for me like what are we gonna do\nabout it\nand so like this is where we end up\nwe don't know how to navigate life\nright\nand i'm not trying to\nto crap on therapy i'm just saying that\ntheir like therapists are great don't\nget me wrong it's just that therapists\ncan't fix climate change and this is a\nreal subtle problem which is that\ntherapists can help you with cognitive\ndistortions\nthe problem is that the anxieties that\nyou have may not be distortions\nyou all get that\nlike a lot of what we struggle with like\nhalf the problem the reason that mental\nhealth is getting so much worse is\nbecause these are not malfunctions of\nthe brain people aren't\nlike misinterpreting stuff\nthis is actually what's going on\nif you look at things like\ngrooming\nhow old were you if you're a girl i\nguess applies to guys too but generally\nspeaking i think about girls how old\nwere you when you got your first dick\npic\nright like\nthat's a reality like you have to deal\nwith that this is not a cognitive\ndistortion it's not a malfunction of\nyour mind\nright you guys get that like these are\nreal problems that we don't we're not\ngiven\nadvice or a compass\nor map right and we see like people like\n9 to 13\nshocking but that is like really\nconsistent with most of the people that\ni've worked with\nright it's it's staggering\nhow bad of a place the world can be\nand so this is beautifully said\nand at some point you make a choice\nabout who you are and what you want\nright and this i assume is\nrue's mom right so we see that there's a\ngenetic predisposition to anxiety\nthat our mom uses xanax\nand you make a choice about who you are\nand what you want\nand\nyou take a substance\nand everything you feel and wish and\nwant to forget it all just sinks\nand then over time it's all i wanted\nthose two seconds of nothingness\nand you're just so happy\nand thus\nis an addict born\nbecause for two seconds\nafter you take this pill\nit's back to the womb\nand this is the interesting thing i was\ntalking to you know there's one person\nthat one patient that i really learned a\nlot from\nand you know it's kind of weird so i'm a\npsychiatrist sure i'm qualified and\nstuff like you know i've got\ngood training behind me and i'm a\nmedical doctor and all that good stuff\nbut the truth of the matter is that if\nyou really want to understand any\naddiction or any disease\nthe psychiatrist is not the expert the\npatient is the expert\nand it's a patient that i was i was\ntalking to a patient once\nand we'd gotten close right so i'd been\nworking with them for a while and i was\njust stunned and i said\nyou have such an amazing life\nyou have such an amazing life you know\nyou've got\na career that i know you enjoy you've\ngot a family that loves you\nand you know all this kind of stuff and\nyou're throwing it away\nright so you're going through divorce\nproceedings\nyou're now in debt\nyou've like had one of your cars\nrepossessed and things like that you had\nto sell off some stuff your children are\nbeing alienated from you\nwhy don't you stop using\nand then\nthey blew my mind but they said it's\nbecause of that that i can't stop using\nbecause you're right that like my life\nis turning into a mess\nand every hour of every day my life is a\nmess\nexcept when i get high\nand so i have all i have to do is put a\nneedle into my veins and like\nfor a few hours like none of those all\nthose things cease to exist\nright i'm just so happy\nin those two seconds of nothingness\ni'm just so happy\nand this is where i want to sort of take\na let me just see where this is going\nlet's see\nokay hold on\nokay\nso we're gonna talk for a second about\nwhat addiction does for people okay\nso\nthese seconds of nothingness\nin which you're just so happy\nhas a sanskrit word for it\nand that sanskrit word is samadhi\nsamadhi is a temporary state of\nenlightenment where the ego dissolves\nyou dissolve and all you are is\nunadulterated experience\nyou're just sort of this weird like\ncosmic awareness which is also\nnothingness so keep in mind that\ndrugs are not addictive so people talk\nabout nothingness but they think it's\nlike\noblivion but it's not oblivion so\nremember that drugs don't put people to\nsleep that's not why they use them\nthey keep people awake\nright like you want to stay awake when\nyou use drugs\nbecause what it puts you into is a state\nof consciousness where you're beyond\nmind\nwhere you're beyond time\nand you're just existing in nothingness\nwhich sounds like kind of an oxymoron\nright like how can you exist in\nnothingness or the other way to call it\nis like it's like pure existence\nwithout like\nattachments so there's no like\nconsequences to things right you can\njust appreciate the colors\nand everything that you wanted all of\nyour wish wishes all of your desires\nall of your sufferings all of them\ndisappear\nand this is what's so confusing for a\nlot of people who meditate as they're\nlike i don't want to get rid of my\ndesires right it's my desires that\nmotivate me it's my desires that make me\nwhat i am it's my desires that make me\nhappy\nbut as people meditate and as they\nattain states of samadhi their desires\nbegin to melt away\nand you don't know how to continue\nliving if you until you've experienced\nit you don't know what that means for\nyou\nand so you can appreciate things\nwhen you're high like colors and the\ntaste of food and the feeling of wind on\nyour skin\nand the other people that talk about\nexperiencing this stuff are the yogis\nbecause they say oh look\nyou know like just just be with just be\nyou know enjoy\ntranscend ego\nand so i think for a lot of people drugs\nare basically like a budget samadhi\nthey're like a temporary shortcut to\nbring you to a place\nwhere like\nthe yogis like buddha has been trying to\nteach people how to do this for\nthousands of years\nand then like here's the problem is that\nyour brain is like okay so i can do\nhardcore meditation for 15 years and\nmaybe i'll get to this state because\nremember when you start to meditate you\ndon't know what this feels like\nright so like this is all a myth to you\nit's a hope it's like telling someone\nthat you know sail to the end of the\nocean and you'll you know the world is\nround and like you won't fall off it's\nfaith but you have to embark on that\nvery very long voyage on faith and you\nhave no idea what you're going to be\ngetting at the end of it\nand then what you have is you've got a\npill\nthat can bring you there\nit's so much easier\nlike why bother meditating when you can\nget high\nlike because it's so immediate it's so\nenjoyable it allows you to forget\nall of your body image issues\nhere you are exhausted\nworried that you're overweight worried\nthat your brain is moving slow\nand disappears\nit's a pill to make it go away\nright why bother\nit's bliss samadhi\nand so then we get into trouble\nright we use for a while\nin rue's case she has an overdose that's\na medical emergency that she possibly\ncould have died from\nand then parents get freaked out and\nunderstandably so right because they're\nparents and they love you\nso what do we do\nyou've got a diagnosis\nyou're an addict\nthere's treatment for it let's not judge\nlet's give you treatment\nand so they send you to rehab and oh\nchat\ncould i talk about rehab\nso here's the thing about rehab\nman where do i even begin\nokay let's talk about rehab\nso rehab is fantastic in some ways and\nawful in others\nso the first thing is that if we look at\nsome of the rehab traditions\nwhat happened is there were people who\nwere addicted to substances\nand they leaned into oftentimes nowadays\nchristian ideology and they found that\nthat christian ideology was very very\nhelpful\nand it was for a lot of good reasons so\ni'll give you guys just some example of\nsome of the ideology behind alcoholics\nanonymous that i think is very kind of\nlike scientifically validated\nso it's kind of weird because if you\nlook at alcoholics anonymous what\nthey'll start with is that\ni'm powerless in the face of my\naddiction\nand that there's a higher power and only\nthrough the grace of that higher power\ncan i overcome this addiction\nand that sounds kind of like weird right\nso like if you're admitting\npowerlessness how is that a winning move\nwhen it comes to addiction\nand it's interesting because it\nabsolutely is and this is where the\nyogis have been talking about this for a\nlong time as well surrender this the\npower of surrender\nand so the tricky thing about an\naddiction\nis that an addiction hijacks your power\nright like that's how the addiction\nthrives the addiction tells you don't\nworry about it we got this we can handle\nit you'll be okay they won't find out\nyou'll be able to handle it you'll be\nable to handle it it'll tell you\nwhatever you need to do to get to that\nnext hit\nright it says don't worry about it i\nhave things under control i'm in control\nsure i got a dui but i just won't let\nthat happen again it's fine if i\ncontinue drinking as long as i don't get\nanother dui\ngot another dui oh yeah i slipped there\nwere like some\nyou know mitigate there was some\ncircumstances there wasn't really my\nfault\nuber's from now on\nand you'll even adjust a little bit\nright that's how you become a functional\nalcoholic\nas you adjust and you adjust and you\nadjust the one thing that you're not\ngoing to give up you'll adjust all these\ndifferent dimensions of your life except\nfor the alcohol that's got to stay\nbecause you're in control\nand if we look at where a lot of\naddiction gets out of control it's from\nthis fundamental idea that i am in\ncontrol because as long as you're in\ncontrol you can keep doing it\nright because you're in control like\nit's okay\nand so aa stumbled upon this or\ndiscovered this you know whatever\nand they sort of start with these things\nlike\nthe alcohol is going to win any any\ncombat\nwe engage in and that's actually\nincredibly powerful\nso they discovered like some of these\nthings and they sort of leaned into\nreligiosity and like they developed you\nknow aaa\nand so that's what the rehabs are like\nthey're they tend to and they develop\nthese systems\nright and so there's a lot of\nreligiosity to it\nare there are the steps and the coins\nand this can be really powerful stuff\ndon't get me wrong\nbut the tricky thing here is that\nyou can like and then rehab becomes a\ntreatment right so people do studies and\nstuff and as we do studies on rehab we\nrealize okay this is how you fix an\naddiction this is the best evidence\nbased people will go there you're going\nto be sober for 30 days you're going to\nget clean it'll turn your life around\nbecause some people that leave sing the\npraises right they say oh my god it\nworked so well for me\nit'll turn your life around it fixed my\nkid\nand so you're a parent\nand\nyou're terrified that your child almost\ndied so you'll pay whatever you drop 50\ngrand for one month of treatment\nand you send your kid there\nbut this is the this is the same problem\nas before it's the same problem as\nyou know like this\nwhere now it's like there's another\nproblem that shows up\nlet's ship our kid off to rehab\noutsource the addiction treatment\nthey'll fix my child at rehab my child\nwill come back and everything will be\nfine\nbut here's the problem with rehab\nit's going the wrong way\nwhat you want when you go there is\nreally important so i've seen this\nunfortunately time and time and time\nagain\nwhere people come to rehab but do they\nwant to get clean\nhalf the reason that people come to\nrehab is not because they want to get\nclean\nit's because someone is making them get\nclean\nand so here's the trickiest thing about\nrehab is you can participate 100\nand you can be completely sober at the\nend of it or you can be a complete\naddict at the end of it\nyou can go through all of the motions of\nrehab and not be rehabbed one iota\nyou all get that this is the problem\nwith rehabs in addiction treatment in\ngeneral is you can show up to every\nmeeting you can talk about your feelings\nyou can hold hands with other people and\nsay and chant god grant me the serenity\nto accept the things that i cannot\nchange and in your [ __ ] mind\nnot buying one bit of it and no one will\never know\nthe only person that will know is you\nthis is the problem with rehab\ncan it be helpful absolutely is it an\nevidence-based intervention that helps\npeople with addictions absolutely have i\nworked at rehabs where i have helped\npeople make substantial and\ntransformative changes to their life\nabsolutely\nand i've worked at rehabs where i've\nseen people who walk i mean talk to talk\nbut aren't going to walk the walk\nbecause on the inside is where it\nmatters\nand if you actually\nwhen you say this prayer there are two\nways to say this prayer right god grant\nme the serenity to accept the things i\ncannot change you can say it as words\nand in your mind be thinking about\nwhatever you want to or you can actually\nlike think about it\nand recognize that when i use a\nsubstance it is because it is\nintolerable for me to not use it\nand that if i can accept that\nintolerability then i have a pathway to\nsobriety\nit's simple\ni cannot tolerate this and the problem\nwith the drug the problem with the\n[ __ ] drug is that the drug\nmakes you need to never learn how to\ntolerate you don't need to tolerate it\nbecause if you take the medicine\nif you take the drug you don't need\ntolerance anymore because it puts you in\nthis state it puts you into a state of\nsamadhi\nand so you say this prayer because\nthey're like they just like toss this\nstuff out at you right because even in\nthese rehabs they're like they're like\nfactories\nyou get oh we've got 14 newbies today\ngo get checked in over here they're you\nknow room checks every two days\nthursday is lasagna night\nyou'll get your one day chip your one\nweek chip in your 30 month chip and then\nthey have graduations\nand all these other kinds of like\nceremonies and things like that which\nmatter to some people and don't matter\nto other people\nand so it's like this script\nbut like in\na script is not a substitute for a map\nor a compass\na script is not a substitute for anyone\ncapable of giving one iota of good\nadvice\nbut this is what's happened\nis we become scripted\nand so you go and you go through the\nmotions\nright\nand then like are you are you better off\nafter who knows\nwho knows this is a problem with rehabs\nthe other subtle problem i mean rehabs\nare great in general just to be clear\nwe're sort of talking about the\ndownsides which remember that has a lot\nto do with her\nright it's not so much that the rehab\ndoesn't work\nthe downside though is that there are\nsome rehabs whose business model is to\nnot work\nso i've seen this unfortunately in some\nvery upscale very expensive rehabs that\ncater to executives\nbut their business model is like you're\ngoing to come to this beautiful place\nlike on an island off the coast of\nflorida or something like some beautiful\narea of california like in napa valley\nand we're going to like you're going to\nget sober we're going to do this like\nspiritual kind of like talking about\nstuff you're going to talk about your\nfeelings you see a therapist you're\ngoing to do an infrared sauna and you're\ngoing to do this and you're going to get\nmassages and you're gonna do yoga you're\ngonna learn how to meditate and by the\nway we're gonna like artificially\nrestrict your substances you don't\nactually have to really do work but it's\ngonna be like basically a 30-day\nvacation that you feel fantastic\nafterward\nand then we're gonna have very poor\naftercare and we're going to send you\nback into the environment where you have\naccess to alcohol\nand you're just going to screw up again\nand when you screw up you had such a\npositive experience here that you'll\ncome back and we get repeat business\nand by the way here's your\nloyalty rewards program 10 visits your\n11th is free\nthese kinds of places exist it's\nunfortunate\nbut their their business model\nsurvives off of repeat customers\nright i don't know how intentional it is\nbecause like they'll collect data sort\nof right so very few rehabs i very very\nfew rehabs will advertise what their\nsuccess rate is like two years out or\nthree years out they won't even collect\nit like no one knows\nit's sad but unfortunately it's true\nand here it is right what you think\nbecause i went to rehab i stayed clean i\nmean ain't that the point\nwell the whole world's coming to an end\nand i haven't even graduated high school\nyet right so here it all comes together\nthis is the thing about addictions is\nthat it's an integration of everything\nit's an integration of all the above\nit's an integration of like\nthe world going to hell\noutsourcing various things pieces of\nyour life that are being handled by this\nperson versus that person\nthat person versus\nthat person\nand you can choose to participate or not\nparticipate you just go there you sit\nwith a therapist you\ntalk about your feelings for an hour you\nleave and you go and you get high you go\nto rehab you get your chip\nyou say the words you go and you get\nhigh\nand so now what we're gonna\nso now we're gonna do is dive into a\nlittle bit about\ndrug addiction and what to do about\nhandling addictions\nokay\nso let's start with like the different\ndimensions of addiction\nso the first thing is we now know that\naddiction is like genetic in nature so\nwe know that there's\ninheritance with vulnerability to drug\naddictions\nso we know that for example depending on\nhow your brain is wired if you use\nalcohol your brain will look like this\nand if you use marijuana it won't look\nanything like this it'll just be like\nnormal so we know that there are genetic\npredispos predispositions to particular\nsubstances of addiction this is why\npeople have a drug of choice quote\nunquote right\nand they'll use a substance once in\ntheir life and they'll be like oh my god\nit transformed my life it revolutionized\neverything for me\nand so\nyou know this is just the way that our\nbrain is wired and some of this is\ninherited but it's actually more than\njust genetics it's more than just\nneuroscience\nit's also parents\nright so what is the scenario if you\nguys have seen the show so here's a mom\nwho's having you know a little bit too\nmuch wine at dinner\nso how are we taught to handle things\nby our parents right so how does this\nmom handle her emotions she just drinks\nwhat are the lessons that we're we're\ntaught\nby our upbringing\nso you know is drinking normal is it\nokay is it not okay\nlike when you have conflict when mom and\ndad get into a fight and mom sighs and\nwalks out of the room and opens a bottle\nof wine\nand dad yells at her and calls her a\ndrunk and she flips him the bird and\ngoes out to the patio and that dad goes\nto his like garage and mom goes outside\nand she's just drinking and like what\nare you being taught by your parents\nabout substance use\nwhat are you being taught about if\nthings are intolerable\nright\nif you don't have the ability to accept\nthings that you don't change what do you\ndo instead\nso a lot of that stuff comes from\nparents and it's not just genetics it's\nabout\nprogramming\nso it's not just nature it's also\nnurture\nand then so we're sort of given this\nkind of setup right this is the hand of\ncards were dealt\nand then what happens is personal\nanxieties come in so like i have a\npredisposition to alcohol i've been\ntaught that alcohol is a good way to\nmanage my emotions and then i'm a 13\nyear old kid who just has like anxiety\nabout my body because you know that's a\nthing by the way i don't know if you\nguys have heard of platforms like\ninstagram and other forms of social\nmedia\nin which they propagate pictures of very\nvery attractive people and you have 13\nyear old boys and girls who are looking\nat these things and they start to become\nuncomfortable with their body image\nand so when you look in the mirror right\nthis is the friggin mirror\nnormally what kind of emotions is that\nsupposed to bring up\nlike you're just supposed to see\nyourself right i'm supposed to look in\nthe mirror to see if there's stuff of\nthe spinach stuck in my teeth\nbut now when i look in the mirror like i\ngotta make sure i'm slim i gotta make\nsure i'm trim\nthat's what we have to do\nand now these emotions start coming up\nthey're exacerbated by technology\nthey're exacerbated by peer pressure\nand then we turn to our coping\nmechanisms how do we handle these kinds\nof things\nright and then we go to our genetic\nvulnerability\nand then\nthere's drugs\nand so now we kind of go back to this\npoint about designer drugs\nbecause what's happening now is like\nthings are getting worse because now you\nhave so many different things are you\ngoing to use dmt are you going to use\nmdma are you going to use\nyou know a variant of dmt so that's like\ni don't know if you guys remember that\nscene but the kid is like here i've got\nlike three different things that are\nthree different variants of the same\ndrug\nall different kinds of dimethyltryptine\ndmt\ntryptamine\nand so which one works for you is it\nindica blend is it sativa blend is it\nthc heavy is it cbd heavy is it k2\nis it pcp is it meth\nis it nicotine is it vaping\nright there's so many different answers\nthat we've got\nand now what's happened is we have all\nthese vulnerabilities and we have the\nperfect substance the thing that buries\nyour anxiety the most the thing that\nmakes your drug your brain light up the\nmost\nright so 5-meo dipt\nand that's just the way that we're wired\nand\nthe problem is that like we're given\nlike\nanswers right we're given drugs we're\ngiven rehab the problem is that the\nanswers just don't answer things well\nenough like i can start you on\nmedication i can even send you to rehab\nbut does it fix this does it fix this\ndoes it fix this no\nnever mind like all the other stuff that\nit doesn't fix like climate change and\nexistential dread and like\nyou know\nwe also learned later that rue's dad\napparently died of cancer or something\nlike that\nbecause the truth is that the world is\ngoing to hell and i do have anxiety and\ni don't feel confident in myself\nand i don't know what to do about it\nbecause i have no one to guide me\nand so as we we deal with all these\nthings like what do we turn to right we\ngo back to this\nand all we want to do is go back to this\nhappiness and contentment\nso how do you deal with this stuff right\nhow do you get back here in a sense\nand i think that this is where as an\naddiction psychiatrist like\nyou can absolutely get here\nbut i think it's integrated\ni think it's not\nit's not you can't outsource it that's\nthe biggest thing\nshould you get sober like absolutely\ndon't get me wrong don't use drugs kids\nseriously\nbut the thing is like not using drugs\nand getting sober is not\nyou can't outsource it right you can't\njust like\ngo to rehab once and that's going to be\nthe end of it\nthis is where you really have to\nintegrate everything you have to\nunderstand first of all appreciate the\ngenetics\nappreciate that like your brain is\nparticularly vulnerable to a certain\nsubstance\nsecond thing is like develop healthy\ncoping mechanisms that goes back to the\nmom who's drinking\nbecause here's the thing we were taught\nwhen things are intolerable you were\ntaught how to how to deal with them\nwhich is through substances\nand so it's about developing things like\na meditative practice grounding\npractices learning how to urge surf all\nthese other kinds of of\ntopics\nhow do you manage your emotions you must\nbecome adapt at managing your emotions\ntolerating your emotions\nbecause that's what that's what the\ndrugs do right they give you a pass at\ndealing with your life\nnext up is actually\nhow can i say this reducing the power of\nthe emotions to begin with and this is\nwhere a lot of people who struggle with\naddiction like kind of fall short is\nthey're like okay i need to learn\nalternate coping mechanisms like i need\nto learn how to meditate but meditation\ncan only get you so far when it when it\ncomes to dealing with some of the like\nhow hard life is\nthis is also where like therapy can come\nin\nin really powerfully because here's the\nthing if i have a pile of emotion that i\nhave to cope with\nso i need like this amount of meditation\nskill that may be too much the drug can\nget me here\nthis is the crap i have to deal with\nyou can actually reduce the crap that\nyou have to deal with through things\nlike therapy\nbut the whole point is that therapy is\nnot going to be enough\nright when you kind of dig down and like\nrecognize that it was incredibly\ntraumatic when your parents like how\nterrified you were that when they first\ntook you to the psychiatrist and they\nsaid oh sweetie nothing's wrong don't\nworry you're gonna be okay\nand they had tears in their eyes and\nyou're like what the hell is going on\nlike i don't understand anything but i\nknow that whatever it is it's bad\nand then your parents are like no honey\ndon't worry everything is gonna be okay\nand that's the moment it in which\nreassurance no longer worked for you and\nthen you stopped trusting people\nreassuring you and if you think about if\ni can no longer be reassured by other\nhuman beings what does that do for my\nanxiety\nbecause now i can't be reassured so i'm\njust screwed constantly\nand then the only thing that works is\ndrugs because i'm not able to be\nreassured why am i not able to be\nreassured because i had a traumatic\nexperience where my parents were\nreassuring me nothing is wrong and then\ni started to distrust reassurance\nyou guys get that i'm just kind of\ntossing that out there but i've seen it\nright\nso like once you start to distrust\nreassurance like the world becomes a\nterrifying place because if you ever get\nanxious there's nothing that can make\nthat anxiety go away\nand so as you work with a therapist\nhopefully a good therapist who can help\nyou realize that then it's like oh my\ngod i need to practice i need to learn\nhow to be reassured again\nyou work on that and then suddenly\nyou're able to be reassured which means\nwhen you're feeling like this and a\nfriend comes and says hey let me help\nyou that they can actually bring it down\nand now you can meditate enough\nright so it all has to come together you\nhave to work through the crap that\nyou've built up psychologically through\nall of your micro traumas and whatnot\nbut that's not gonna be enough you're\nalso gonna have to learn how to meditate\nyou're gonna have to learn alternate\ncoping mechanisms you're gonna have to\nalso have insight and understanding into\nhow your parents taught you to deal with\nemotions\nso in sanskrit we call those kinds of\nthings some scars\nright these are like the lessons that\nyour mind learn through sub-optimal\nemotional processing\nthey're the psychological scars that are\nleft with you through negative\nexperiences\nand then you carry those scars with you\nwe understand this stuff really well\nbecause we call it like relationship\nbaggage right\nlike oh yeah like why didn't that\nrelationship work out oh like that dude\njust had way too much baggage\nwe carry stuff with us that's\nunprocessed and affects the present so\nyou've got to go through and clean that\ncrap out\nand by all means engage in treatment\nright there may be a role for medication\nlike here i am sort of talking about the\ndownsides of medication and stuff like\nthat because it does like zone people\nout but this is where like if you have a\ngood clinician and this is where i sort\nof hate the direction that\npsychiatric treatment is going because\nwe've started to separate out like\npsychopharmacology from psychotherapy\nso as\nmedicine is becoming more and more\nspecialized i've got my prescriber and\ni've got my therapist and then i've got\nmy group therapist\nand then i have my yoga teacher and then\ni have my meditation app\nlike as human beings we're having to\nassemble all of that\nbut the truth is that if if all of that\nis housed in one mind\nit helps the patient so much\nwhich is precisely why i like doing\neverything\nlike as a clinician\nit's like we're doing the patient a\ndisservice i'm just prescribing\nmedication and then i'm supposed to have\na conversation with their therapist once\nevery two months to try to get the low\ndown like that works coordination of\ncare is important but like\nideally like one person is going to be\nable to do it all one person is going to\nteach you meditation one person is going\nto pick your their meditation based on\nwhat traumas you've had\nand they're also going to figure out\nokay i'm going to start this medication\nwe're going to teach you this meditation\nand then in eight weeks hopefully the\nmeditation is going to work and i'm\ngoing to know ahead of time that we're\ngoing to try to cut down on the\nmedication\nand for the next eight weeks i recognize\nthat you feel like a zombie but i really\nthink you need the medication and this\nis why we're doing the meditation so\nthat we can cut down on the medication\nin eight weeks but i need you to take it\nevery single day and i recognize it\nsucks and you can't create art\nand it all needs to be put together\nand the most important thing\nis to build a life that is worth living\nso here's the thing that i think is like\nmissing\nmost fundamentally from addiction\ntreatment\nis that when the value of forgetting\nis more than the value of remembering\nsomeone will reach for a dog a drug\nthe true antidote to addiction\nis to want to be in the world\nright it's when like forgetting the\nworld in oblivion\nis not as good as\nbeing awake and alive\ndoug\nthat's the honest to god's truth\nand this is the reason why we like\nfocused on like creating a something\nlike a coaching program here at hc\nis because like the problem is that like\nlike rue said no one gives you a map for\nlike what to do in life\nand so like therapists are really good\nat like dealing with trauma and stuff\nbut i know that therapists are great at\nlike helping you work on your resume\nright because that's not what we're\ntrained in\nbut at the end of the day like the\nsacrifice of the drug the reason that\npeople get addicted to drugs is because\nthe benefit that they get from the drug\noutweighs the cost at the end of the day\nvery simple\nand so what you have to do if you really\nwant to stay sober is build a life that\nis worth living\nbuild a life that you don't want to\nforget\nand that's hard and the problem is that\nlike we don't even have a formal way of\ndoing that\nright it's all this autopilot crap\nthat's gotten hijacked it's like go to\ncollege\nthey stopped teaching a lot of stuff at\ncollege a long time ago it stopped being\nabout education and they still teach a\nlot\nbut the college has stopped being about\neducation universities stopped being\nabout education\nthink about the incentives\nof the people at your university\nwho are your professors\nhow much formal training in teaching do\nyour professors have think about that\nright like i teach at\nharvard medical school but i'm not a\ntrained educator thankfully my program\nwas really emphasized that so i feel\nlucky\nbut\nit's not like i have a masters in\neducation\nand so you have people teaching\nbiochemistry\nwho like\nare not great teachers\nsome of them are\nsome of them like it and some are forced\nto do it\nso all of our incentives are messed up\nand the problem is like you're the one\nwho pays the price\nyou're the one who pays the price of 911\nyou're the one who pays the price of the\n2008 economic crisis you're the one who\npays the price of the genetics that you\nwere born with you're the one who pays\nthe price of\nthe parenting emotional style that you\nwere raised with you're the one who pays\nthe price of living in 2022 when there\nare like 15 kinds of designer drugs so\nyou're literally your tendency to be\naddicted is at an all-time high because\nyou have so many frigging options out\nthere and they've been purified and\nrefined if you think about vaping\npeople have recently seen studies that\nshow that vapes are more addictive than\ncigarettes oh who is surprised\nnot i the amount of nicotine and\nstimulant in the vape is actually at a\nhigher dose than cigarettes why do you\nthink they did that it's to get people\nto smoke vapes\nthe deck is stacked against you in so\nmany different ways and the challenge\nhere is that you have so many answers\nright go to therapy go to rehab start\nmedication see a psychiatrist\ngo to alcoholics anonymous do all these\ndifferent things\nwatch dr k\nyou'll change your life\nbut none of that is going to be enough\ni'm not saying it isn't helpful it's\ngreat we're great too by the way\nlike i believe in all of those things\nbut the problem is that\nthat's not enough right the basic\nproblem with addiction is that you can't\njust go through the motions that's\nwhat's so devastating about being a\nparent with a child with an addiction is\nyou can send them to rehab and you can\nsee them go through the motions but in\nthe back of your mind as a parent you\nnever know what is going on in that\nchild's head\nright\nyou never know\nand that's ultimately what it comes down\nto if you're a parent with a child with\naddiction you understand this that\nultimately it's what's going on in their\nhead it's not what they show it's not\nwhat they tell it's not how they act\nit's not what they say it's none of that\nit's what's going on in their head are\nthey actually committed to sobriety or\nnot\nand in terms of getting sober that's the\nonly thing that matters or it's not the\nonly thing that matters incorrect the\nthing that matters the most\nyou can't be a passive recipient of the\nrest of it\nand so i love euphoria because i think\nit does such a good job in 20 minutes\nto explain all of this stuff\nfrom how the world that we're brought\ninto\nto\nhow we get diagnosed how we get piled\nwith diagnoses how we get piled with\nmedications how that makes it hard for\nus to function how we have all these\nanxieties about our like body image and\nall this kind of crap\nand why we start using\nand what happens when we go to rehab and\nwhat doesn't happen when we go to rehab\nand why addiction is so devastating\nbecause it's like can you really blame\nsomeone if like\nwhat the addiction does is take away all\ntheir problems\nthat's just the first 20 minutes we've\ngot a lot more\ni mean not today but in general\nso check out the show\nit's worth watching\nif you have if you know someone\nwho struggles with addiction i think\nit's pretty insightful\nif you yourself struggle with addiction\ni think it's pretty insightful i think\nit's like a really good compliment to\nlike all the other stuff right so by all\nmeans go see a therapist go to rehab\nand then watch the show\ndid you like the rest as well i haven't\nfinished it\nso\n[Music]\ni was taking notes during watching\neuphoria\nin my notes for the first 20 minutes or\n10 pages long\nso we're gonna we have so much dude do\nyou guys want to hear about like maybe\nwe can vote or something i don't know\nit's a mistake but\nso\nthere's a lot of good stuff\nuh\nokay\nso uh there's a correction so ayahuasca\ndmt is technically south american not\nnative american mostly in amazonian\ncultures but not limited to\npeyote mescaline is the native american\nequivalent and is limited historically\nto tribes\nin what we call now mexico and texas\nthank you for correcting us\num apologies for that misattribution\nquestions\nyes someone's saying a friend who's an\naddict once told me she felt that felt\npeople that did uppers still had to want\nto live while those who did downers like\nshe does don't want to live anymore yeah\nso here's the thing\nthere's a lot of wisdom to come out of\naddiction\na lot of wisdom\ni don't know if that's\ntrue for all people but\nis becoming a psychiatrist still worth\nit if i want to actually help people\npersonally 100\ni love being a psychiatrist\ndr k do you think parenting style you\nmentioned in the start could have caused\nme to have obsessive thoughts and health\nanxiety not diagnosed\nsort of\nso that's where like\nso the point i'm trying to make is that\nwhen it comes to you as a person\nyou can't fix\nany particular thing with just\none dimensional treatment and not one of\nthese things causes\nwho you are\nright so it's like there's a genetic\ncomponent there's an upbringing\ncomponent there's a world is going to\nhell component\nso your health anxiety or obsessive\nthoughts\ncould they've been influenced by your\nparents certainly\nbut that's where like if you haven't\nbeen diagnosed i would go talk to\nsomeone about that right so get an\nexpert opinion and help figure out where\ndoes this where does this part of me\ncome from because that's important to\nunderstand\nso i'm seeing an unusual amount of\npersonal questions\nhow do you get out of reasoning\naddiction oh wait hold on i don't know\nwhat quite what that means are you\naddicted to reasoning or\ni don't know what that means but\nhere's what i'd say like so some people\nget stuck in reasoning for sure\nright and like if you're if you're\nsomeone who just gets stuck in logic and\ndoesn't act\nthere's a simple reason for that it's\nbecause logic is a safe space\nright like\nthe realm of logic is a hypothetical\nit's it's you know\nyou can\nfantasize about relationships as much as\nyou want to and you're never going to\nget hurt\nit's when you actually engage in a\nrelationship that stuff is out of your\ncontrol\nand so a lot of people will like\ntunnel down into logic and just rely on\nlogic\nhow are you so mentally stable after\nseeing so many dark things it's a good\nquestion so\nfirst of all there's an assumption that\ni'm mentally stable which you know\ntime will tell\nthe second thing is that i think this is\nwhere we have an assumption that\ndarkness\nthat things are dark and that darkness\nis bad\nwhereas like my experience of seeing\ndarkness is like that's actually when\nyou see\nreal strength and real wisdom\nand like\nso people think that it's you know it's\nbad like how can i sit with people like\nday after day and like listen to their\ntrauma and stuff it's because\nit's out of that strength that they\nbecome the people that they are\nright which can be like amazing\nbeautiful powerful things\nand so\nit's it's not like you just take the\ndarkness on\nthat's what happens and the cool thing\nis like i mean i don't know how to say\nthis but it's it's inspiring to see\nsomeone come out of that\nand like\nthe devastation of hearing about\nsomeone's trauma\nis outweighed by watching them overcome\nit\nright and so like i get to see those\nwins too\nand that's why i do this work it's\nbecause like there are wins to be had\nlike this is a fight that can be won\ncan you be addicted to dr k\ni i don't i wouldn't use the word\naddiction but i think that there are a\nlot of people out there who\nspend a lot of time thinking about\nmaking change instead of actually making\nchange\nso there it's interesting because\nbecause i i mean i think that\nwe can become\nyou can procrastinate on dr k just like\nyou can on anything else and you got to\nbe a little bit careful because\njust because you may be learning\nsomething here i'm not saying that it's\nhopefully this is\nless damaging procrastination in terms\nof you're getting some benefit from\nwatching us but at the end of the day\nlike don't stop living your life because\nyou spent too much time listening to dr\nk right like that we can be we can be a\npart of the problem too 100\nso if you're using listening to dr k as\na substitute for doing something in your\nlife then that's a problem\nhow do you learn to accept being unable\nto tolerate like so that's the first\nthing is you recognize that you're not\nable to tolerate\nright and that's got to be okay\nand then the other thing that's really\nwild is that\npeople who don't believe they can\ntolerate\na big part of that is the assumption\nthat\nthe suffering will go on forever\nso it's not that you can't survive this\nsecond it's that you can't survive the\nnext five minutes and the next 10\nminutes in the next hour\nso when a human being is suffering\nwe think the duration of that suffering\nis forever\nand especially when we start to use\ndrugs\nsomething weird happens in the mind\nwhere when we get instant relief\ni wish i could explain this well this\nmay sound this may not make any sense\nbut\nthe more instant my relief is\nthe longer my suffering feels\ndoes that make sense it's like for\nnormal people it's like here's the\nduration of suffering here's how long it\ntakes to get better and those things\nkind of match\nand then as i shrink the amount of time\nit takes to get better\nthe window of suffering like increases\nby\na proportionate amount\ni don't know if that makes sense or not\nbut it's kind of weird but like\nand we sort of know this because if you\nlook at different kinds of\nbenzodiazepine drugs the drugs that have\nthe prescribed drugs that have the\nfastest onset of action are the ones\nthat are the most addictive\nso this is why like xanax is so damn\naddictive because its onset of action is\nvery fast\nwhereas you can take a medication like\nclonazepam which has a slower onset of\naction can still be abused\nbut it's generally speaking less\naddictive\nand so something weird happens that as\nlong as you think that your suffering is\nforever that's what makes it intolerable\nand so the key thing about learning to\ntolerate your suffering\nis that\nit's intolerable it's intolerable it's\nintolerable but i'm not gonna act in\nthis moment i'm not gonna act in this\nmoment it's intolerable i'm not gonna\nact in this moment\nand then something magical will happen\nwhich is that at some point you'll\nrealize that like the suffering will go\naway on its own because that's how the\nhuman mind works\nright so imagine\nyou know some kind of resentment that\nyou had from a birthday party in high\nschool\nthat resentment can sort of stay with\nyou in some level but it's not like the\nsuffering of that moment\nlingers for the rest of your life at\nthat intensity\nthe flip side is also true the joy of\nthe birthday party doesn't linger for\nthe rest of your life\nso i'll talk to people who are really\nobsessed about their weddings\nlike sometimes i'll get like marital\nconflict about weddings i mean it's not\nmarital it's pre-marital\nlike oh my god i want this wedding and\nit needs to be this way this way this\nway and the other person's like no like\nwe don't need that we don't we talk\nabout a little bit it's like how long\ndoes the happiness of the wedding last\nright you want this perfect day this day\nof perfect happiness how long do you get\nto hold on to that day of perfect\nhappiness\nhow long can you hold on to the\nresentment\nof not having a perfect day of happiness\nthat can last a lifetime\n100\nresentment can last forever but the\nhappiness never does\nyou"
