    "transcript": "so someone's saying poker is great for\nthis like i don't know exactly what\nyou're referring to but it makes a lot\nof sense to me it's funny because i've\nseen professional poker players do\nreally well in other scenarios so i've\nhelped professional pro players\ntransition to like other jobs\nand so if you're someone who you know is\nworried about your career not being the\nright choice like that's okay\nthe other thing is people think oh my\ngod i've wasted so much time in this\ncareer that's okay\nyou'll be surprised at how much of it\nwasn't a waste\nbut i know it's so much about fluid\ndynamics and i don't know how to apply\nfluid dynamics to like other things well\nyou'd be surprised\nso my life improved dramatically once i\naccepted that i have no singular\nall-consuming calling and instead just\nwant to do a variety of stuff i kind of\nlike until i eventually die\nmakes sense\nright so if we kind of look at this\nwe see a lot of questions about how do i\nyou know how do i find which career is\nright for me\ndo i pick my passion\nor do i pick my job\nwhich one\nwhich is the right choice\nso we tend to go through life or\napproach life kind of thinking binary\nlike there's a right thing and there's a\nwrong thing there's a career and even if\nit's binary it's singular\nright it's not like a multiple choice or\nlike\nyou know check all that apply that's not\nhow we go through life we go through\nlife like you know true false binary\nsometimes multiple choice but you got to\nmake one choice\nwe also don't think it's like certainly\nnot like\nword problem with essay response that's\nnot what life is like there's a right\nway to live life and there's a wrong way\nto live life\neven our language it's so baked into our\nlanguage\nare you happy with your career\ncareer is singular\nit's like\nyou know people don't ask like do you\nenjoy your careers\nno like a career is like one thing\nlike the concept of a career is that\nit's one thing that you do\nthat you then like persist in doing for\na long amount of time and then if you do\nit for a while like and you make the\nright choice then you'll be happy and if\nyou make the wrong choice then you'll be\nmiserable i regret my career choice\ni'm happy with my career choice\nit's all singular it's all binary it's\nall longitudinal\nand then furthermore we also honor\npeople who tend to pick one career\nright so like we'll look at people like\nyou know despite all the criticism we'll\nlook at people like jeff bezos who built\namazon and bill gates who built\nmicrosoft news flash there were other\npeople involved\nwarren buffett\nyou know who built berkshire hathaway\nnews flash there were other people\ninvolved\nwhen we look at success we tend to look\nat like\none thing that people worked on for a\nlong period of time\nand to be sure there's a good reason for\nthat it's like you know if you you know\nthat can absolutely\napply\nbut i think that for a lot of people you\nknow the concept of a career isn't\nreally about being the best at one thing\nwhich is what people will tell you right\nthey'll say like just learn one thing\nand be the best at it and that's the\nbest way to deliver value\nwe don't talk about hybrids\nit's all min maxing in one dimensional\nbut i think that there are some people\nwho have the temperament\nfor not doing one thing their entire\nlife\nand in fact the way they can be the most\nsuccessful\nis to do like a plethora of things over\ntime\nand they will bring their experience\nfrom each of these things to something\nelse\nand i say this as someone who is that\nway\nright so\nand this is where like i learned this\nfrom kind of the concept of ayurveda\nwhich by the way i know we've kind of\nsteered clear of so i'm going to share a\nlittle bit about that now\nso some people were criticizing some of\nthe papers that we cited about the iu\ngenomics dimension of ayurveda so\nayurveda has different\ngroup you know segments so ayurveda's\ntraditional indian medicine there's\nactually good evidence for some of the\nherbal treatments and some of the\ninterventions of ayurveda but some of\nthe more personality\nbased stuff i think we overestimated the\nquality of the evidence so after doing a\nmore thorough review i think the critics\nwere actually right there's not actually\nvery good data behind some of the\nayurvedic personality stuff\nso i personally still think there's a\nlot of value in it\neven if it is not actually that\nscientifically validated\nand so that that too there's there's\nkind of a dimension there which is that\nthings can have heuristic utility or\nfunctional utility without being\nscientifically correct\nright so we create concepts that help us\nnavigate life\nand even if those concepts are not\nscientifically provable they can be very\nuseful so a lot of we do this a lot in\npsychology\nwhere we'll you know we'll come up with\nlike ego right like ego is not a real\nthing you cannot biopsy the ego you\ncan't detect the ego\non an mri there isn't an ego part of the\nbrain it is an emergent concept\nwhich has a lot of functional utility\nand we can sort of approximate it\nthrough factor analysis but it's not\nnecessarily a real thing\nso what i'm going to talk about is sort\nof like this sounds to me\nlike a vata\nokay\nso avata is someone who\nhas a very dynamic mind who has shifting\nattention\nand generally speaking if you have\nshifting attention you will really\nstruggle to build one year uh one career\nover time because you get bored easily\nyou lose motivation and you get excited\nabout other things\nand so what most people think is that if\nyou're avata you're screwed because like\nthat's what leads to success period is\nto pick one road go through it don't be\na hybrid\nbut in my experience if you are like\nthis\nwhere you can't just do one thing and\nyou kind of get bored easily\nthere's absolutely a way to lean into\nthat\nand craft some kind of career\nbut really incorporate a lot of\ndifferent careers over time that\nactually ends up doing pretty well\nso i'm the simplest i mean you know i'm\nan example of this so once i realized\nthat i'm the same way as this person and\ni leaned into it worked pretty well\nso i'm definitely not the best content\ncreator on the internet right i'm not\nthe biggest youtuber i'm not the biggest\ntwitch streamer\ni'm definitely not the best doctor on\nthe internet\ndefinitely not the best gamer on the\ninternet\nright my mmr isn't that fantastic\nand yet my ability to like weave these\ntogether actually creates like an\nemergent phenomenon\nthat is\nis okay\nmake sense\nso that's the kind of thing where like\nyou know if you're someone who's like oh\nthis career isn't right for me that's\nokay\nand so this is what i would encourage\nyou to do is like recognize that there\nare things from careers that can\nactually have more value in other places\nso for example\ni really really really appreciate i'm\nalso not the best\nmonk right because i dropped out of that\nbut i incorporate spiritual teachings i\nincorporate medical teachings i\nincorporate concepts of psychology i\nincorporate gaming analogies so you can\nweave it all together\nand this is something that i think is\nvery very incorrect about how we view\nsuccess as we assume that getting really\nreally really good at one thing is the\nbest way to be successful\nso if you're someone who gets bored\neasily and gets excited about stuff i'd\nsay lean into that to a certain amount\nand recognize that\nthere are going to be principles from\neach field that you study\nthat will\nhelp you in other fields\nso the simplest example of this is\nactually i mean we can pick any\nbut as i think about my own life i think\nabout like you know training to become a\nmonk for a few years definitely helps\nwith like getting through medical school\nit definitely helps with working with\npatients\nright it definitely even helps\nconceivably on you know the internet\nin terms of like making content\nsimilarly like principles of psychology\nand understanding communication conflict\nresolution\nbehavior\ncertainly helps in terms of like\ncorporate consulting\nright what's going on at this person's\njob like let's try to understand the\npsychology and motivations let's try to\nunderstand what kind of behaviors we're\nreinforcing so the principles that i\nlearned from family therapy can be very\nvery useful in advising executives\nwhat's the dynamic in the room amongst\nthe c-suite executives\nnot just executives like even people who\nare you know like\nfront-line workers\nand so even principles of let's say\ncoding or design\nright where like design and like\narchitecture have been now used to like\ndo branding and marketing\nso there are all kinds of principles\nthat can be useful in other dimensions\neven video game stuff\nso i sort of conceptualize\none of our coaches actually was really\nneat so they came up with a character\nsheet system for their clients\nwhere as their coaching client\nthey'll like develop a character sheet\nand add traits\nand the clients really like it they're\nlike okay this makes a lot of sense i\nhave like plus 10 to this and minus 10\nto this plus 10 of this and minus 10 to\nthis or like maybe i shouldn't engage in\nthat relationship because this person\nthis person has this kind of style or\nwhatever right so they take their like\nreal life attributes and stick them on a\ncharacter sheet so that they it helps in\ntheir reflection of that thing\nthey can reflect on it they can\nunderstand it better\nreal life character sheet\nright\nso like even playing games can be useful\nin coaching like it's interesting\nso the first thing is that if you're\nsomeone who gets bored easily that's\nokay you're not doomed to failure lean\ninto it\na couple of really really important\npoints though about structuring this the\nfirst is that generally speaking you\nwant to cycle back around to your\ninterests\nand what do i mean by that if you get\nbored of thing a move to thing b you get\nbored of thing b move to thing c you get\nbored of thing c\nsee if you can cycle back to a\nbecause if you continue making changes\nif you dig\n60 holes that are one foot deep you're\nnever gonna hit water\nbut if you have four or five holes\nthat you can dig ten feet deep you may\nhit water and not only that if you dig\none hole 60 feet deep you may not hit\nwater it may actually be a more\nadvantageous situation to dig five holes\nten feet deep you'll see that what if\nthere's just no water down there and\nyou've invested sixty feet into\nit so in that way you can actually\noutperform people who are like dedicated\nin one direction\nit's like i am an uh i am a mattress\nsalesman at a retail store and this is\nwhat i've devoted my entire life to\ni'm going to be the best mattress\nsalesman in the world\nand then covet hits and then these\nonline retailers hit\nand i've over specialized in bread and\nweakness\nright\nghost in the shell reference\nit's true\nover-specialize and breed in weakness\nand so this is where like you know it's\nokay to not do one thing your entire\nlife don't get locked into it\nright\nso you can do something for a little\nwhile and if you don't like it that's\nokay i think it's okay to switch you\ndon't have to beat yourself up over it\nbut remember that everything that you do\nyou can learn something from and you can\ncarry something with you\nif you're working retail for a year\nand you're dealing with cairns every day\nyou're now going to be like skilled at\ndealing with cairns and maybe your next\njob as a developer\nyou're going to have a caring for a boss\nand whereas all of your colleagues are\ngoing to be frustrated you are an expert\nat dealing with karen's so you can\nhandle it\nbecause the truth is that a lot of what\nmakes people successful at work is not\nthe actual like work\nright half of it is the work and half of\nit is like all this interpersonal human\nstuff\nor internal stuff it's like stuff like\nwork ethic organization prioritization\ncommunication conflict resolution you\ncan work on all that in all these\ndifferent scenarios\nright so like there are even things\nwhere for example like i remember i was\nworking at um\na residential addiction treatment\nfacility\nand the staff was really really stressed\nout at rounds\nso rounds when you sit down you kind of\ndiscuss plans for the patients and stuff\nlike that talk to the patient sometimes\ndepending on how you round\nso we started every day with a\nmeditation it's like hey like i know\nthis week has been tough we've got a\ncouple of really hard patients\nlet's like start with a meditation\nand then\nwe'll get into rounds\nso\nyou know there are some people that\nspent four years doing research and\ngetting publications before they went to\nmedical school i spent some time in\nindia you can carry it with you\nso you don't need a career\nthat is just one-dimensional whatever\nyou do you can carry with you carry it\nforward\nand recognize that you may actually have\nadvantages\nagainst people who\nhave spent their entire life in that\ncareer\ni really understood this when i went to\nthe gdc conference\nand i talked to all these like\nprogrammers and developers and like\npeople who are designing games\nthere's so much to be gained\nfrom like understanding psychological\nperspectives\nright we were even talking about so i\ngave a talk about reducing toxicity and\nthere's like basic stuff about\nbehavioral reinforcement that i think\nthe developers haven't really understood\nand it's what's actually really amazing\nis how much developers have understood\nabout player behavior without any kind\nof formal training\nthey've gotten so far without formal\ntraining they're brilliant\nand they like they're doing it blind\nright\nso someone's saying poker is great for\nthis like i don't know exactly what\nyou're referring to but it makes a lot\nof sense to me it's funny because i've\nseen professional poker players do\nreally well in other scenarios so i've\nhelped professional pro players\ntransition to like other jobs\nand so if you're someone who you know is\nworried about your career not being the\nright choice like that's okay\nthe other thing is people will think oh\nmy god i've wasted so much time in this\ncareer that's okay\nyou'll be surprised at how much of it\nwasn't a waste\nbut i know it's so much about fluid\ndynamics and i don't know how to apply\nfluid dynamics to like other things well\nyou'd be surprised\nright and so like it's not too late to\nswitch\nthere are a lot of things that will\ncarry over things like work work ethic\ninterpersonal dynamics the ability to\nstick with something for a long period\nof time\nyou know you're an engineer and\nsomeone's like why would we hire you've\nbeen doing 10 years of like fluid\ndynamic stuff at a sewage plant\nand you're like well i'm i'm very detail\noriented\nyou know there's like some technical\nskills that i need to learn but i'm\nhappy to learn those i have a strong\nwork ethic\nand frankly i've wanted to leave the job\nfor two or three years\nbut i'm not a quitter\nand so if you hire me like i'll make\nsure the job gets done even if i don't\nenjoy doing it\nand you can count because like you know\nif i don't do a good job people get poop\nin their water and that's unacceptable\nso i'm very results-oriented i'm very\ndetail-oriented\nand i'll work\nuntil the job is done\nright so someone's saying\nopinion is like i'm good at handling\n[ __ ] yeah absolutely\nright you say that in an interview why\nshould you hire me i guarantee you i'm\nthe best handling [ __ ] of anyone in your\noffice\nand they laugh and you laugh and you\nhave a positive connection\nand then maybe you get hired\nyeah so like\nbut even if what you say is to 80 plus\npercent is going to waste who cares\nhow much do you really need so let me\nask you all something if you get a job\nright if you do start doing something\nyou say oh but 80 of it is waste like\nhow much do you really get from the\nexperience\nlike if i do a job for two years versus\n10 years\nhow much\nadditional work or additional gain do i\nget from the eight years\nthink about it right think about it\ncritically\nso if i play dota for two years versus\nplay dota for 10 years\nwhat's going to be the effect on my mmr\nso people assume this is a huge mistake\nthat people make\nthat devoting yourself 10 years to a\ncareer makes you better at it than\nsomeone who does two years there's a\ndisturbing amount of research from the\nfield of medicine\nthat the quality of your practice of\nmedicine is determined within the first\ntwo to five years of practice\nand that you will have doctors who have\nfour years of experience who will\noutperform doctors who have 30 years of\nexperience very commonly\nand furthermore\nlike that the good doctors are\ndetermined early on and we see the same\nthing in video games right you calibrate\nto your mmr and like if you look at pros\nlike pros in esports are not the ones\nthat have the most experience\nlike i have more experience playing dota\ni think or i've been playing it for more\nyears actually i don't know if this is a\nfair thing to say but there are\ndefinitely people out there who have\nmore experience than like you know\nwho've been playing dota for more hour i\ndon't know about more hours but longer\nthan even like the ti champions from\nti-10\nso we grossly overvalue\nexperience\nthey're like oh my god 80 of it is\nwasted like who cares you don't need 80\nof it all you need is 20\nso what it comes down to oh\nf okay\nwhat it comes down to what'd y'all hear\nwas last\nthing you can't trash talk teams very ti\nokay\nso what i was saying is that like people\nassume that experience\nis really important and scales linearly\nright we assume that oh my god i've been\ndoing this for 10 years all that\nexperience is wasted\nbut how long does it take to get good\nare you\nwhen you're when you have two years of\nexperience versus 10 years of experience\nare you five times better than someone\nwith two years of experience absolutely\nnot\nand you can see this if you look at\nesports because you'll have people who\nplayed more hours\nwho are like still sitting in the trench\ntier\nthan people who are like winning\ngigantic international multi-million\ndollar tournaments\nso experience doesn't count for nearly\nas much as people think it does\nand this is where if you need to catch\nup the cool thing is that deliberate\npractice can really help you catch up\nreally easily so if we look at people\nwho are better you know there are people\nwho are who've played a thousand hours\nof dota and people who played a hundred\nhours of dota and people who played a\nhundred hours of dota may be better than\nthe person who's played a thousand hours\nhow is that it's because they're\nintentional about getting better\nright they focus on it and they try to\ncatch not even catch up they just\nfocus on getting better every single day\ninstead of playing like zombies and the\ntruth is most of people who are in\ncareers like do it like a zombie and\nthey're sort of like passively learning\nthey don't really reflect very much\nright you just go to work and you work\non more projects and you gain more\nexperience and you kind of level up but\nyou're not doing like replay analysis of\nyour games so what makes people better\nreplay analysis do you do replay\nanalysis at work\nwhen a project doesn't go well what is\nyour\nimprovement process\nchances are it's run by the people above\nyou\nand so like\nhow good is that going to be\nright so what about your own personal\nimprovement process\nsomeone's saying i always do replay\nanalysis at work chinese cabbage farmer\nand that's why you get reprimanded\nbecause you're watching dota replace at\nwork\ncatching up is always faster than you\nthink\nright so like people say like oh i'm\nshifting careers i'm starting behind i\nstart i finished medical school at the\nage of 32.\ni was like somewhere between four and\nsix years older than the average person\nand it's fine like i'm doing okay\nright like\ni had a lot of worries when i was going\ninto medical school oh my god i'm so old\nit's fine\nyou know\nhighly recommend doing what's right for\nyou and making a shift if that's what\nyou need to do\nright getting good is not about more\ntime it's about intentional\ni wish we could have an interview of of\n20s dr kate\nmy friend\nyou all have had tons of interviews with\n20s dr k the people that we bring on\nstream half of them are 20s dr k\nright that's how we pick them\nyou want to have an interview with 20s\ndr k go talk to yourself in the mirror\ndepending on who you are\nright\nso\nit's okay\nlike\nif you're someone who has ultimately\ndecided a career is not right for me\nlike lean into it you will be amazed at\nhow much value you can bring to the\ntable\nyeah so for all really i think that the\nwhole reason that this thing works and\nhg is a thing\nis because we're a lot more close to\neach other than we realize\nand so lean into who you are\nright it doesn't don't follow the\nformula for success because here's the\nbiggest problem with the formula for\nsuccess being the next bill gates or\njeff bezos or whatever\nright because we also have elon musk who\nwas like\ni'ma build a tunnel from san francisco\nto la i'ma send a spaceship to the moon\ni'm gonna stick a wi-fi router on a\nsatellite\ni'ma buy twitter\ni'm a build electric car\ni'm a build elect i'm gonna build\nbattery\nright it's like\nwhat man like where's the focus\nright\nso it's like everyone who's looking at\ncareers is like\nyou know we always look at these people\nwho like pound away at one thing for 20\nor 30 years and we assume that's the\nformula for success it's not the formula\nfor success here's the other big problem\nwith the formula for success\nthe formula for success all the success\nstories that we have i know it sounds\nkind of weird\ninvolve a person\nbut are you that person\nchances are you're not\nand if you're not what are the\nindividual factors that go to that\nsuccess we look at their actions but we\ndon't look at the person\nand so any formula for success that you\nfollow that someone else gives you is\ngoing to work\nlike it's going to be inefficient\nbecause it doesn't account for you\nso if you're someone who like you know\nwants to be quote unquote successful\nyou know and you have certain tendencies\nyou have certain stats\nyou know it's kind of like\nyou know if you have a a strength build\nan elden ring\nand you see a bunch of like people\none-shotting things with as a mage and\nyou're like i'mma pick up a staff and\ni'm gonna be like them\nbut you gotta play to your strengths\nright like what's your build what's your\nnature\nwhat are your temperaments what do you\nlike what gets you to work the best what\nmakes you the most intrinsically\nmotivated it may not be doing the same\nthing day in and day out for 10 years\nthis is where if you're worried about\nall the inefficiency loss and stuff like\nthat remember that people can do things\npeople can play a video game for 5 000\nhours and still suck at it\nso you can shift careers and whether you\ndo a good job or a bad job depends\nentirely on how much work you put in and\nhow reflective you are\nand when people say when i say work i\ndon't mean just the hours that's the\nother thing is people assume that more\nwork means more hours no that's my whole\npoint you can play dota for 5 000 hours\nand still suck that person has put in a\nlot of hours but they haven't put in a\nwhole lot of work that's why they suck\nright\nit's even like i think it's bill gates\nor i forget who who said this but it was\nsaying like you're like oh but like i'm\nlazy\nand it's like bill gates is like if you\nhave a hard task give it to a lazy\nperson they'll figure out how to do it\nthe most efficiently\neven laziness can be an attribute that\nyou can capitalize on\nright\nsomeone's like why should we hire you as\na developer will you be like i'm lazy\nlike why is that an advantage because i\ndesign the best user interfaces\nbecause\ni think about how to make things the\neasiest for myself all the time\nthat actually excites me and i will\nactually be motivated to do that\nand then they're like confused the guy\nsays he's lazy\nshould i hire him or should i not hire\nhim\nyou interview enough someone will hire\nyou\nokay\nall right shall we meditate\nis there such thing as like a meditation\nto do psychosis absolutely we've like\nshared papers on that\nyou just do a google scholar search for\nit\num so let's meditate so i was going to\nteach y'all something a little bit\ndifferent today\num it's going to be a little bit more\nso i tried to find something that would\nbe\nboth advanced and\nbasic so we're gonna do a version of ohm\nmeditation today\nso for people who are relatively new to\nmeditation you can just do the basic om\nbut for people who have been practicing\nfor a while because we have our month of\nmeditation still going on on discord\num you can go ahead and and uh\nlike do sort of the advanced level of it\nokay\nso the other thing is that today we were\ntalking a lot about\ninteracting with the world for lack of a\nbetter term so we were talking about you\nknow being authentic with the world sort\nof like how you show yourself\num sort of engaging with the world from\na career standpoint\nso what we're going to do is do a\nversion of ohm chanting that highlights\nexternalization versus internalization\nso let's kind of review with a review\nwhat ohm is and why we chant it\nso om is generally speaking composed of\nthree syllables\n[Music]\nand we start with the mouth fully open\nah\ngo to middle open\nthat's how we chant oh okay so what\nwe'll do when we chant om is we'll do\nfive breaths or nine breaths you'll\nchant kind of five times nine times\nwhatever with your eyes closed\nthe other thing that we'll teach\nfrequently about ohm is that ohm is\nabout chanting is not about sound\nit's about vibration\nand what i mean by that is what and i\nknow that physics wise the two can be\nthe same thing\nbut what i'm talking about is your\nexperience of the thing is not about\nhere it's about here\nso what i want you to focus on when you\nchant is the vibrations that you feel\nnot the sounds that you hear\nokay that's why we'll chant with our\neyes closed\nso for those of you who have not done om\nyou can just start with that right so\nwe'll chant when we chant together\nwe're all practice together but where\nyour attention is is going to depend on\nwhether you're more advanced or more\nexperienced\nor less less experience less advanced\nokay\nso you can just focus on the vibrations\nand chant and that's like great you'll\nget a lot of benefit from it\nnow here's sort of the additional layer\nto it\nif you've been chanting and if you've\nbeen focusing on vibration what you'll\nnotice is that there's a difference\nin where it vibrates like where you feel\nthe vibration for each sound\nand what you'll sort of notice is that\nthe ah\nprojects something outward\nokay\nand so you'll kind of feel like this\nvibration that's towards the upper part\nof your body and it'll sort of feel like\na projection outward\nas you move to the oh\nyou'll kind of notice that that sound is\ngoing to vibrate more around the throat\nand if you really pay attention you'll\nnotice an upward movement\nand a downward movement so that also\nsounds kind of weird and you may not\nunderstand this until you actually\npractice or if you until you've\npracticed a lot\nso that there's going to be an outward\nmovement with ah there's a binary\nmovement there's sort of an outward flow\nand inward flow with oo\nand then there's going to be an internal\nmovement with\nthe the m will almost go straight down\nso in that way we can sort of notice\nthese three directions of vibration with\nown\nnow there's sort of a mystical component\nwhich i'll just share with y'all and you\nknow up to you whether you want to put\nemphasis on this or care about this or\nwhat right so this is not really\nsupported by science\nbut when we chant ohm\nthere's also sort of like you can\nlengthen a particular syllable\nbased on\nwhat you're shooting for so if you want\nto create kind of an outward change you\ncan lengthen the ah\nif you're trying to balance something\nbetween you and the outside world you\ncan focus on the ooh\nand if you want to focus\ninternally or the the reason you're\nmeditating is for some sort of internal\ngain then you want to focus on the um\nokay so we can go\n[Music]\nif your goals of meditation are more\nlike internal or spiritual in nature\nif your goals are more external ah\nright so you can lengthen one part or if\nyou're sort of doing it introductorily\nyou can just kind of you know do all\nthree evenly okay\nand then if you're sort of trying to\nbalance something between you and the\noutside world if you're kind of like\nthen you can focus on the the ooh\nso ah\nokay\nso someone's asking why can't new people\ndo the advanced technique you can do the\nthe technique is going to be roughly the\nsame\nthe difference is going to be what\namount of awareness\nwhat your awareness is capable of so\nwhen you chant if you can really feel\nthat difference\nthat's what makes it advanced right so\nif you can't feel that difference or are\ntoo focused on the breath or counting or\nwhatever like that's totally fine you\ncan still chant and you can move towards\nthis\nso whether you're advanced or basic and\nit's not like the advance is necessarily\nbetter than the basic\nit all depends on what you're able to\ndetect and what you focus on\nso this is the other thing to understand\nis that sometimes people will get bored\nof a\nmeditation and that's where you can\nchant om but the ways in which you chant\nit and what you focus on can be\ndrastically different over time and\ngenerally speaking when you chant home\nor when you do a month or for a very\nlong period of time\nunless you have a teacher who's guiding\nyou with each step and who can discuss\nyour practice what you'll discover is\nthat you'll find weird like nuances\nwithin the mantra and find different\nkinds of like connections with the\noutside world that you didn't know\nexisted the first year you chanted it\nand that's where you know do are these\nconnections real are they not real like\nwhat's going on like it's unclear to me\nlike the human brain has\na tendency to seek patterns and make\npatterns\nso even if the pattern isn't real though\nit can lead to a functional\nunderstanding which can help you\nnavigate life\nokay\nso we're going to practice now we're\ngoing to do\n[Music]\nlet me just think how many breaths we\nwant to do so we're going to do five\nrounds\nso round one\nis going to be\nfour seconds four seconds and four\nseconds of ah\nround two is going to be\nlet's say\neight seconds of ah\ntwo seconds of oo and two seconds of um\nround three is going to be two eight two\nand round four is gonna be two to 8\nand round 5 is going to be 4 4 4. okay\nso the reason we're going to do this it\nmay be kind of confusing but i'll kind\nof prompt y'all is what i want you all\nto really pay attention to is which one\nfeels the best\nto you\nokay so does doing equal equal amounts\nof ah\nfeel the best to you or do you sort of\nreally get into it more when we're\nlengthening ah\nand sort of having a shorter ooh and\nshorter or long\nor long\nokay\nso it's gonna be four four four\neight two two two eight two two two\neight and four four four okay\nso let's start with the first one so\nwe're going to sit up straight\nclose your eyes take we're going to go\nahead and just\nlet our breathing even out\nmaybe for about 20-30 seconds\nand now we'll begin with the four four\nfour so take a deep breath in\n[Music]\n[Music]\nso let's go ahead and do that again so\nwe're going to do\nit's going to be closer to five five\nfive i think so deep breath in\n[Music]\n[Music]\ngood\nso hopefully you kind of noticed the\nvibrations\nfelt them in different areas or maybe\nyou were focused on the count\nwhatever you were doing is totally fine\nso now we're going to lengthen that ah\nokay so it'll be maybe 933 instead okay\nso take it take a deep breath in\n[Music]\ngood we'll do that again so 933 so\nreally long nine a really long ah\noh and um okay so deep breath in\n[Music]\nand when you practice that on your own\nif that sort of felt good to you\nremember to focus on the sensation of\nthe vibration projecting outward\nnow we'll focus on the oo in the\nkind of internal balance and we're going\nto feel the upward flow and downward\nflow\nit'll be 3 9 3 so we'll start out with a\nquick ah\na long\ndeep breath in\n[Music]\nand again\n[Music]\nand now we'll move on to the um being\nthe long part\nso we'll have a three second ah a three\nsecond ooh and now we'll really focus on\nthat downward vibration that the um\ncreates you're gonna feel it deep within\nyour chest and just focus on that\nsensation okay deep breath in\n[Music]\nexcellent\none more time\nthree second ah three second do nine\nsecond\ndeep breath in\n[Music]\nand now we'll close the practice with\ntwo rounds of even breath five seconds\nfive seconds five seconds\ndeep breath in\n[Music]\nand now the last breath\nand afterward we're going to sit in the\nsilence of om which is actually the\nfourth sound\nthe sound of silence which is sort of\nthe hidden sound within ohm\nso some people will even say that the\nmost important part of ohm chanting\nis none of the syllables that you chant\nbut the residual experience afterward\nso we're going to do one more round\nwe're actually going to lengthen each of\nthe segments the ah the u and the um to\nsix seconds\nokay so the other way to kind of think\nabout it is just do it as long as you\ncan evenly split up okay\nso\nget ready take a deep breath in\n[Music]\nand silence\nand that\nis how you live in the present\nyou"
