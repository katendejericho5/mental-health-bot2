    "transcript": "so rejection sensitivity sensitivity is\nreally common and people are always\ntrying to get rid of it if i am afraid\ni'm ugly\nif i'm afraid that i'm overweight what\nam i gonna be sensitive to and the\nstandard answer is get rejected over and\nover and over again and that's by\nstandard answer we're not saying it's\nwrong there's a certain truth to it\nright but\nthat's not\neasy to engage in and it's not sometimes\nhelpful whereas if we think about it\neach of those rejections is associated\nwith a lot of pain right it hurts like\nyou can't just ask someone to go outside\nand go swimming in lava every day for\nlike a week like they're not gonna do\nthat right it's really hard\nso how can we understand this a little\nbit better and how can we sort of\npotentially get some control over\ni have a tough time handling rejection\nhey everyone\ni could really use some advice about how\nto get rid of this rejection sensitivity\ni'm having the most small sign what\nthe most small sign of rejection makes\nme feel absolutely miserable\ni get insecure and feel hurt at first\nand then angry at the person that i feel\nrejected by there were many times where\nit left me miserable for days or even\nweeks\nnow it happens more often that i\nsometimes react openly to it by being a\nbit off or being a bit colder just to\nregret it a few minutes later because it\njust turned out to be in my head\nthis is really\nin the way this is really getting in the\nway of making friends or finding some at\nleast but i can't shut my emotions off\nin that moment i'm 22 and shouldn't be\nsuch a child anymore\ndoes anyone on here know how to get rid\nof this\nso this is something that is\nthis is something that a lot of people\nstruggle with\nthat we have a difficult time\nhandling rejection right and what we're\nlooking for\nis a way to get rid of it\nso this is where like you know a lot of\npeople will say like oh you know you\njust like handling rejection is about\ndeveloping thick skin right so even\nwe'll say that we'll say like okay it's\nlike it's about practice it's about\nexperience you know you got to get\nrejected over and over and over again\nsurvive it and then you'll realize that\nlike you know it's not that bad right\nand that's how you get over\nhandling rejection you just have to be\nrejected\nwhich there's truth to\nbut if you really think about it like\nit's terrifying right so if you tell\nsomeone yeah like the way to get over\nyour phobia of snakes is to spend more\ntime with snakes like that's the reason\nthat we have exposure to therapy and\npsychiatry we're like oh yeah like let's\nlet's\nexpose you to it\nthe only way to learn how to handle\ngetting rejected is to get rejected\nwhich is\nmaybe true\nright but like it's actually\nterrifying if you really think about it\nit's like really really\nterrifying\nbecause these people don't want to\nyou don't want to do that it's like if\nyou have someone who's afraid of snakes\nand you're like the solution to get over\nyour fears we're going to drop you in a\npit of snakes like they're not going to\nwant to do that if you have trouble with\nrejection and you you get you're\nsensitive to rejection you have trouble\nhandling it you're not going to sign up\nfor it right in fact it's\nthat's not like a personal failing which\nby the way a lot of people feel like\nthey have right there's a lot of\nself-judgment here so you're almost like\nrejecting yourself in this process well\ni'm such an idiot\nfor being so sensitive to rejection\ni should have grown up by now which in\nthat moment\nwhat are you doing to yourself\nyou're rejecting yourself you're not\naccepting yourself you're not cutting\nyourself any slack\nand so this is sort of where it honestly\nstarts right so why are we so sensitive\nto rejection\ngenerally speaking as human beings\nthe things that we're sensitive to are\nthe things that we ourselves are\ninsecure about or the things that we do\nto ourself\nif i am afraid i'm ugly\nif i'm afraid that i'm overweight what\nam i gonna be sensitive to\ncomments that other people make about me\npotentially being ugly or being\noverweight\nand sometimes what'll even happen is\nthey're not even making comments about\nmy weight\nright like but the way that my mind is\nso primed it's gonna assume that a\nneutral comment is going to be\ninterpreted as a comment about what i'm\nsensitive to\nso rejection sensitivity sensitivity is\nreally common and people are always\ntrying to get rid of it and the standard\nanswer\nis\nyou know get rejected over and over and\nover again and that's by standard answer\nwe're not saying it's wrong there's a\ncertain truth to it right because once\nyou get rejected a couple times and you\nsurvive\nthen you'll realize like oh it's\nactually like not that bad or it won't\ndevastate me the way that it i thought\nit would\nbut\nthat's not\neasy to engage in and it's not sometimes\nhelpful right so it's not like go out\nthere and get rejected a thousand times\nthen you'll overcome your rejection\nsensitivity whereas if we think about it\neach of those rejections is associated\nwith a lot of pain\nright it hurts like you can't just\nask someone to go outside and and go\nswimming in lava every day for like\na week like they're not gonna do that\nright it's really hard\nso how can we understand this a little\nbit better and how can we sort of\npotentially get some control over it\nokay\nso let's talk about this okay\nso\nhow do we overcome rejection sensitivity\nokay\nso the first thing to understand is that\noftentimes the rejection sensitivity the\nsensitivity\nitself\ncomes from self perception\nright and we kind of saw that over here\nwe look at this like you know i\nshouldn't be such a child anymore right\nso like we'll see that oftentimes\nso the first thing that you can do is on\na core level like try to understand\nwhere did you get the idea that you were\nworthy of rejection because if you're\nsensitive to something chances are it's\na fear that you hold internally\nright like so what i would kind of ask\nyourself is why\nare you\nrejectable\nand as long as you have the belief\nthat\nyou are rejectable\nit's going to be easy to be rejection\nsensitive right so this is actually like\nthe cap the foundation of it so this is\nwhere if you you do something like see a\ntherapist or like work on your some\nscars or things like that so a lot of\nlike spiritual practices and stuff\nyou'll discover this kind of thing right\nas we like meditate and do this kind of\nstuff you can do it sort of clinically\nor non-clinically if you've got a you\nknow serious problem and you have social\nanxiety or like real problems with your\nrelationships i'd recommend a clinician\nbut you can do this kind of internal\nwork without necessarily going to\ntherapy\nokay so that's the first thing is like\nunderstand the core of your sensitivity\nand if you can work on that core of\nsensitivity by exploring when did your\nbrain learn\nthat you are rejectable and then as you\nthink about those experiences as you\nreally process and you realize that\nchances are the reason you're rejection\nsensitive today\nis because there was someone who\nrejected you super hardcore and hurt so\nmuch and you carry that hurt around with\nyou\nand you you're so afraid of that\nhappening again that like\nyou know it's kind of projecting into\nyour current life okay\nsecond thing is that when people are\nrejection sensitive what they want to do\nis get rid of it\nright we want this thing to just go away\nand so\nthis in a sense is one way of getting\nrid of it but like the goal here is to\nhow can i say this\nthe goal here is to change our reaction\nor change our mind\nwhereas what we're going to share with\nyou today is a couple of things that you\ncan do\num\nthat\nmay actually help with this okay a\ncouple of other things that you can do\nthe next thing to think a little bit\nabout\nis when we sort of talk about other ways\nto get rid of it there's sort of the\nthick skin approach\nright which is if you get rejected\nenough\nyou'll get thick skin\nand then it won't hurt as much\nhurt less\nright\nbut this is the kind of thing that's\nlike absolutely terrifying because i\nwant you all to understand this\nso if you have a person who's rejection\nsensitive and you tell them to like get\nrejected and this hurts\nlike this is the whole point that you're\ntrying to avoid this is why you want to\nget rid of it right you're trying to\navoid this at all costs\nyou want to be cured of the rejection\nsensitivity so everything that your mind\nis doing in terms of even this kind of\nstuff so when we get rejected we feel\nhurt\nso what do we do when we get if we get\nrejected\nright so sometimes\nwe internalize it\nfor weeks\ni feel hurt on the inside but i'm not\ngonna say anything to anyone\nfor weeks\nso like when we get rejected we just\ntake that feeling we stuff it down in\nthere we live with it it ruins our life\nfor days or weeks and you're telling\nthis person to go out there and get\nrejected\nthey're gonna get rejected once they're\ngonna go for days or weeks feeling bad\nabout themselves\nand then you're gonna be like good job\nnow go out there and do it again\nor what happens is that and then what\nhappens they get fed up\nwith dealing with internally and then\nwhat do they start doing they start\nlashing out\nthey get cold\nright\nthis is what this person said\nnow it happens more often that i\nsometimes react openly by being a bit\noff or being a bit colder\nso what's going on there it's like\nhere's our bucket of bad feelings\nand so why are we and it's filling up\nwith the toxicity of i got rejected i\ngot rejected\nrejected and then at some point it\nstarts overflowing\nand so now we start sometimes we'll lash\nout\nbut what's more common is we'll start\nacting cold right\nand why do we do that it's because like\nit's kind of passive aggressive because\nwe can't actually lash out like we can't\nlike overtly get mad at them but we're\ngonna punish them for hurting us so i'm\ngonna give this person the cold shoulder\nand then what happens then is like this\nscrews up our relationships\nbecause on the one hand like here's this\nperson that could be my friend\nthat makes me feel hurt for weeks and\nthen i give them the cold shoulder\nand i don't really understand like what\nis going like they don't understand\nwhat's going on i feel hurt by them\nand so now like they're asking me hey\nfor hey you want to go grab dinner\nsometime and you're like i don't know\nmaybe and then the friend is confused\nbecause they don't understand what's\ngoing on there's all this rich internal\nstuff that's going on within me when i\nget rejected\nwhich they have no idea about\nand so then it gets confusing for them\nthey stop texting me\nthey get frustrated\nthat feels like another rejection\nand then like this whole cycle repeats\nagain\nright\nso what can you do here\nso i do think that there's value in all\nof these things\nbut there are two other things that i'm\ngoing to show y'all that are kind of\nlike really important\none is perception\nand the second is communication\nso\nthe key thing here that a lot of people\nmiss out on on rejection sensitivity\nis how their perception is screwing them\nso\nlet's look at this and we can see it\nright here\nthe most small sign\nof rejection makes me feel absolutely\nmiserable\nthis is the key thing\nso a lot of times when we talk about\ngrowing internally or growing\npsychologically we're always trying to\ncontrol our reactions\nor we're trying to control our internal\nenvironment or we're trying to control\nour\nactions\nright so if we think about like if if\nsomeone has a problem\nokay there's signal\nreaction\nand action\nand if you if you look at what people\nare asking for and where solutions are\nright it'll always be here and here\nand we're missing a third of it so let\nme give you all an example so how do i\nget rid of this feeling how do i\novercome my social anxiety how do i stop\nthinking about this how do i not get\nhung up on that right how do i let go of\nan ex\nhow do i get over this relationship how\ndo i stop thinking about her all the\ntime\nthinking about him all the time\nhow do i stand up for myself how do i\nset boundaries\nright how do i speak up for myself how\ndo i talk to my parents so everyone's\ntalking about the reaction and the\naction\nhow do i stop feeling this way\ni want a magic bullet\nor magic wand that takes away the\nreaction i want to shape my behavior\nand so there are solutions there for\nsure here's what we're missing\nthe perception\nbecause if you can alter your perception\nthat'll change your reaction and by\ndefinition will change your action right\nbecause the action is based on the\nreaction the reaction in turn is based\non the perception\nso that one area that i think is very\nvery very underutilized\nin terms of self-growth is being\ncritical and shaping your perceptions\nso let's think about this a little bit\nmore carefully\nso this the most small sign of rejection\nmakes me feel absolutely miserable\nnow if you are imagine you're in a\nrelationship with this person\nhow can you\nwork how can you interact with them how\ncan you avoid this\nright if i'm your friend\nand we'll see this like sometimes with\nthese like horror texts\nright of dating apps and things like\nthat\nwhere like the smallest sign of\nrejection makes you feel miserable but\nit's like it's not actually a sign of\nrejection they're not actually rejecting\nyou it's just life right so if i don't\ntext you back within five minutes\nyou feel rejected\nyour perception is oh this person is on\non the cusp of rejecting me\nrejecting me and let's understand why\nthis is this isn't stupid it's because i\ndon't know how to so when we get\nrejected it hurts a lot\nokay\nso when we get rejected\nand we get weeks of misery\nwhat is our brain going to adapt to do\nit's going to learn how to like predict\nthis as easily as possible right so if\nsomething is like\nso like we've seen this in for example\nparents of children who have had serious\naccidents\nwhere like if you have a serious\naccident if your child is a serious\naccident you take him to the hospital\nthe first sign of that thing repeating\ntriggers the parent and that's\nabsolutely adaptive it's absolutely\nevolutionary we're not going to let it\nget to that point ever again\nwe've seen it in i've seen it in\nmarriages where there's a lack of you\nknow the people have had affairs\nand then what happens to the person\nwho's cheated on\nthey're paranoid in the first sign\nof infidelity creates an explosion of\nreaction\ny'all get that\nso this is not it's not like this person\nis stupid\nfor a small sign creating a reaction\nit's because if there's a bad\nconsequence\nand it happens once our brain is going\nto learn how to predict it\nif it happens again we're going to learn\nhow to predict it\nif it happens again we're going to learn\nhow to predict it\nand then eventually what happens is like\nyou know the signal over here is small\nthe signal over here is larger the\nsignal over here is larger right and so\nsmaller and smaller things are going to\ncause us to react which is just our\nbrain's way of protecting us\nit's like you know there's there's rain\nclouds in the sky there's thunderstorms\nthere's thunderstorms there's rain\nclouds there's regular clouds and\nthere's the beginning of clouds there's\na change in barometric pressure\nour brains and our survival mechanisms\nhave learned how to\nmove earlier and earlier and earlier and\ndetect smaller and smaller signs\nand the more the emotional impact is the\nsmaller the signs that we're going to\nlook for\nso what can you do\nrecognize that this is what your brain\nis designed to do but that it is a\nmaladaptation so what you really need to\ncontrol is your perception\nthe the key moment\nis here\nthat you can work on\nso if you have someone where you've the\nsmallest sign of rejection that's where\nyou need to catch your mind you need to\nsay hold on a second\nwhat actually happened and before you\nbecause once you jump on that conclusion\nonce you board the train of rejection\nyou're sol\nyou're screwed\nso how do you avoid boarding that train\nhow do you avoid getting the reaction\nand then\nengaging in the action how do you avoid\nthat right so this is\nthis line and then this line\nthe way is by noticing the perception\nthis is the key thing\nso what are you perceiving what actually\nhappened how are you interpreting it\nthat way these are the questions that\nyou need to ask yourself and start with\nthe smallest thing possible\nright so if someone doesn't text you\nback rather than like oh my god i'm\ngetting rejected and like texting them\nback like oh like why aren't you texting\nme text me back text me back takes me\nback i'm so mad at you or then what\nhappens is you adopt the cold shoulder\nright so then when they text you you and\nyour mind are like i'm not gonna i'm\ngonna they made me wake i'm gonna make\nthem wait\nand you resolve to yourself that\nwhatever they text me i'm gonna not\nrespond to them for 24\nhours that'll teach them\nbecause that's what's going on\nright\nand that doesn't help your relationship\nso notice the\nperception why does my mind why is this\ninterpreting it this way\nright like what are the other\npossibilities here\nthis is where cognitive reframing comes\nup so like go through a differential\ndiagnosis for what you perceive as a\nrejection ask yourself why does my mind\nperceive this as a rejection and it's\ngoing to be really hard because you're\ngoing to automatically jump to that\nconclusion but look at the actual thing\nlike write it down like what did they do\nand how do i feel\nand this is where the antidote the\nsecond antidote to this is communication\nso this is where\nlike communication isn't perfect right\nso if i don't text you back\nthere could be a thousand reasons for\nthat and anytime there's a disconnect\nbetween two people communicating like\nresolves that perceptual problem\nso if you didn't text me good night\nlike every night i feel really hurt by\nthat i feel rejected by that but i never\nunderstood that\nyou don't really like get any value out\nof that right so like it doesn't really\nmean much to you when i text you good\nnight it's not that important to me\nbecause human beings are all going to be\noperating off of their internal like\nroad map of what's okay and what's not\nokay what's important and what's not\nimportant because what's important to\nyou may not be what's important to them\nand so how do you resolve that\nperceptual gap because here's the\nproblem is you're judging their actions\nbased on your internal roadmap\nwhich is why a small signal makes you\nfeel so so rejected whereas they're\ncompletely oblivious to it\nbecause it's not that big of a deal to\nthem and it's not that\nyou're stupid for it being a big deal to\nyou or they're stupid for not\nunderstanding if there isn't a right or\nwrong here the key thing here is\ncommunication\nnow the tricky thing here is that people\nwho are ejection sensitive are terrified\nof communication\nand this is the last thing that i'll\nkind of leave you with\nif you're sensitive to rejection\nsometimes communication can be\nabsolutely terrifying\nbecause these techniques like the cold\nshoulder these passive aggressive kind\nof moves\npreserve some degree of safety\nthey preserve like some amount of like\nnebulousness into which you can't truly\nget rejected\nand so sometimes if you're rejection\nsensitive\nhaving a conversation is opening\nyourself up to the biggest possible\nrejection because if we\nif i tell them that texting every night\nis really important to me and it matters\na lot to me and then they don't do it\nthen it's a rejection of the highest\norder because i've explained to them how\nimportant it is\nright\nso it can be terrifying to try to have\ncommunication but i'd say if you're\nsensitive to rejection sure you can deal\nwith the core of it you can sort of try\nto make your reaction go away\nyou can start to adjust your actions\nyeah vroom right\nbut\nat the end of the day what you got to be\nsuper super super careful about is your\nperception this is the thing that is\nmissed the most\nbecause it is in your perception that\nthe whole cycle starts\nso you all got to be super careful about\nthat\nokay questions\nno baby elephantism is next\nare such signals types of trauma sort of\nright so this is where\nso trauma shapes our perceptions and\nshapes our behaviors\nbut trauma is not the exclusive thing\nthat shapes our perceptions and shapes\nour behaviors right trauma is a\nparticular event that shapes our\nperceptions and behaviors in a\nparticular way so i would say that\npeople who are rejection sensitive\nhave probably undergone some kind of\ntrauma but i don't know if it's like\nit's a word that gets thrown around a\nlot right\nso like sort of is the answer\nhow to be more mindful of perception the\nfirst thing is to look for it\nthe first thing is when you react\npause and track back because here's the\nthing if you're rejection sensitive you\nreally want to look at how you feel in\nthe moment and you really want to look\nat all of the stuff you're going to do\ni'm going to be cold to them i'm not\ngoing to respond to them i'm going to\nshow them i feel hurt i can't believe\nthey did this and then your mind like\nboards this train and it's like thinking\nabout the future and thinking about how\nyou feel and thinking about how you feel\nwhat caused the rejection or the source\nof the rejection gets you just blow\nright past that man\nso go back and say hold on a second\nwhat made me feel this way and what do\nthey actually do\nbecause if you can alter your perception\nthen it changes the reaction and then it\nchanges how you act\nthe perception is key\nbecause oftentimes with rejection\nsensitivity we are sensitive what does\nthe word sensitive mean it means that a\nsmall signal creates a large response\nmy skin is sensitive don't touch it\nthere\ni'm really sensitive about my weight\ndon't talk about my weight\nright so that the word sensitivity\nliterally means\ndisproportionate reaction to a small\nsignal\nand so focus on the signal\nthat's where you can start to shape your\nreaction to the signal because once once\nthe reaction happens then it's really\nhard to manage\nso it's the thing that people leave out\nand by all means like\nget rejected i mean the more you get\nrejected we'll see this a lot with\ndating for example right you got to put\nyourself out there a couple times to\nrealize\nthat you'll survive a rejection\nokay\ngiggy chad get rejected yeah so that's\nlike that's hard for people who are\nrejection sensitive right\nit's really easy for people who are\nwho have the confidence to be rejected\nto tell people who don't have the\nconfidence to be rejected just go get\nrejected\nfor people saying just change your\nperception\nso the first thing is recognize that\nperception is part of the equation\nand then\nexplore it\nyou'll be surprised at how\nhow low hanging the fruit is\nyeah does rejection sensitivity have\nroots sometimes in a lack of validation\nfrom an early age absolutely it often\ntimes because your brain learned\nto be wary of rejection somehow you all\nget that like it learned that lesson\nthat rejection is dangerous\nrejection hurts\nand so it had to learn that lesson\nsomewhere\nyeah so notice the perception and\nchallenge your beliefs that's a great\nway to put it\nwe're not saying that you have to\nexplicitly\njust challenge them right because for\nnow right now you just taken them for\ngranted there's no scrutiny\nand that's where like you'll be\nsurprised at how far a little scrutiny\ngoes\nis becoming the observer like in\nmeditation a good way to get a new\nperspective 100\nyes\nso as we become the observer we separate\nourselves from the reaction and\ntherefore the reaction dies down\nright so i think there's a there's a\nvideo in dr k's guide to meditation\nabout\nhow we fuse with our thoughts\nand how it is that meditation is a\nscientifically validated intervention\nfor all mental illnesses\nlike that's like i think that's fair\nmaybe not all but you know a surprising\nmajority of them so it helps for\nborderline personality disorder helps\nfor depression helps for anxiety helps\nfor adhd so how does that work it's\nbecause on a fundamental level\nmeditation helps you pull away from your\nmind and be more objective\nand the common thing about all these\nmental illnesses is that we get caught\nup in our mind\nso there's some videos in there about\nthe nature of thought and like how does\nthought work and how does mind work and\nhow do we separate from our mind and\nwhat happens when we separate from our\nmind\nokay\nyeah so someone's saying i had an\nanxiety attack yesterday because of\nrejection and doing the observer thing\nsuddenly calmed me down it was insane\nabsolutely\nso what if what about if you have trauma\nand the meditation triggers it so i i\nrecommend particular meditation\ntechniques for people with trauma\nso here's the thing to remember about\ntrauma and meditation\nwhen we have trauma\nour mind develops suppressing mechanisms\nor protective mechanisms where we wall\nthe trauma off\noften times when we meditate especially\nfrom the mindfulness tradition and let's\nremember that mindfulness is like five\npercent of like the meditative tradition\nthe problem is that it's become the most\npopular so everyone assumes that\nmindfulness is meditation\nso mindfulness is about observing and\nletting go and pulling back\nand so when you create that kind of\nvacuum sometimes the trauma gets\nsucked\npast the defense mechanisms and that\nnegative pressure in the mind that\nvacuum in the mind pulls the trauma up\nso that's why if you look at\nyou know clinical clinical interventions\nmeditative interventions they tend to be\nmore grounding in nature so they're not\ngoing to create a vacuum in the mind in\nfact the opposite so if you look at\nmindfulness practices in dbt they call\nthem mindfulness practices but they're\nreally grounding meditations\nthey're really focusing your mind in a\nparticular place it's the opposite of a\nvacuum\nand so there so if you have trouble with\ntrauma and mindfulness that's what i'd\nsay\nfind a competent teacher who is like\ntrauma informed and can teach you an\nappropriate meditation for trauma\nis there a difference between buddhist\nand hindu meditation sure\nbut that assumes that buddhist and hindu\nmeditation are also monolithic which\nthey're not\nright so buddhism has tons of traditions\nof meditation with lots of different\ntechniques hinduism has the same\nbut generally speaking i'd say that\nthere is more overlap\nbetween the traditions than within the\ntraditions so there is tantric buddhism\nand there is tantra hinduism which are\nbasically very similar\nso the difference between vajrayana\nbuddhism and like mahayana buddhism is\ngreater than the difference between\nhindu and buddhist meditation\nessentially but this meditation is hindu\nmeditation it's all the same tradition\nwhich i know sometimes will like offend\npeople but let's remember that the\ntechniques that would the taught and the\ntechniques that would learn were from\nquote unquote hindu teachers\nright like they're all the same this\ntechniques are the same\nyou"
