    "transcript": "so if you're a man today people will\nplace expectations on you and in order\nto feel good about yourself you want to\nlive up to these expectations you're\nlike a man does XYZ I want to be a man\nso I'm going to do XYZ there's a\nfundamental problem that I've seen with\nthis process and that is the more you\nlive up to others expectations the less\ncontrol you have over your life and this\nis the most crushing thing that I see in\nlike half the men that I work with I've\nseen so many men who end up saying okay\nlike this is what a man does I want to\nbe traditionally masculine I want to\nsacrifice for my family I feel good\nabout that and then 10 20 years down the\nroad they've made all these sacrifices\nfor other people and they are left\nsupporting others without sort of having\ncrafted a life for themselves and in the\nworst case scenarios sometimes will end\nend up with things like infidelity or\ndivorce or stuff like that and then\nyou're kind of left sort of thinking\nlike okay what what did I make all these\nsacrifices for and that's how you end up\nas a 40-year-old man who's suicidal and\nin Dr K's office"
