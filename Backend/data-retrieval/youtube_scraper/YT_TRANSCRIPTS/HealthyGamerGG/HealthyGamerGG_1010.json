    "transcript": "but the more that you're thinking i wish\nthere was another one\nthe more you're losing sight of the\nthousand things around you that you can\nonly enjoy in this moment\nand so once you adopt this kind of mind\nshift which i'm not saying is easy you\nhave to understand that like look at all\nof the temporal influences on on your\nmind and then set all of those temporal\ninfluences aside for a moment this is\nwhy it's a practice it's a skill\nand try to enjoy just one thing\nand then what you'll realize which is\nlike really neat\nis that your enjoyment of the thing is\nactually determined by your presence in\nthe moment\nnostalgia is not as pleasant when you're\ndepressed\nso for most people nostalgia is\ngenerally accepted as being a nice\nfeeling a pleasant memory but for me it\njust reminds me of a more innocent\nhappier time when i was a child\ni thought my future was good and all i\ncared about was playing with friends and\nclimbing trees\nhow things have changed\nedit i genuinely didn't expect so many\nkind comments even on a sub like this i\nfeel better and i have you all to thank\nfor that\ni know exactly how you feel i'd kill to\ngo back to the days of running around\nthe forest in my old old neighborhood\nwith my old friends\nwe've all gone our separate ways\nsome some of us were best friends from\nthe age of three all the way to college\nand but we have now all gone our\nseparate ways\ni mean i cherish the memories with my\nfriends and will forever be grateful but\nnostalgia hurts\nstay strong friend hear if you need to\ntalk sending good vibes your way\nso it is interesting right\nthat we tend to think about nostalgia as\na good thing right so it's like oh the\ngood old times and when you when you go\nback in time and you start thinking\nabout the good old times you like smile\nright\nyou start to think about oh like\nlife was simpler\nand we also see this like generationally\nwhere there's this sort of thing where\nyou know the older people like the older\ngenerations and i think this is like\npretty common throughout humanity i\ndon't really know i haven't studied it\nbut\nyou know they start to think that the\nworld is going in the wrong direction\nand the world was like simpler and\nbetter when i was young so we sort of\nhad these like rose tinted glasses when\nwe look into the past\nthe challenge is that sometimes when we\nlook into the past it can be like\ndepressing in the present\nand especially for people who sometimes\ndo feel kind of sad or depressed what\nthey can really do is romanticize the\npast and it can really become like it\ncan make you feel like you've fallen so\nfar\nand that you know things have gotten so\nmuch worse and like things in the past\nwere so much better\nand so before we kind of you know so\nthen the kind of question becomes like\nwas the past actually better like is the\npresent actually worse like what's going\non here how much of this and especially\nif we're talking about depression is\nthere some amount of cognitive bias at\nplay\nand so this is the kind of thing where\nyou can sort of look at these older\ngenerations and you can look at things\nlike cognitive bias and you can sort of\nlogically say i don't know if this is\ncorrect or not but i'm sure you could\nmake an argument\nthat things in the past weren't\nweren't\nbetter\nthat that's actually just in your head\nand that the present is just as good as\nthe past\nand that we have a lot of things to look\nforward to a lot of things to be hopeful\nfor\nright so there's sort of that argument\nwhich you can make\nbut i think what's really useful is if\nyou're someone who's kind of struggling\nwith nostalgia\nor if you're someone who is really\nlooking back into your past life and\nsort of like not not past lives i mean\nlike your past\nand you're sort of seeing that oh man\nlike things were really were happier for\nme then than they are now like let's\ntake that sentiment seriously right so\ninstead of dismissing it and saying oh\nmy god it's cognitive bias\nlet's try to take a look at it somewhat\nseriously\nand let's try to understand what are the\nfeatures that lead you to\nthat conclusion\nand if the past was better can we\nactually be a little bit scientific and\nstart to wonder okay\nwhat about the past made it better\nbecause we look at these things like\ncircumstances and stuff like that but\ni'm not so sure that\nthough that's what actually makes the\npast better\nso and the interesting thing is that if\nwe can really start to understand the\nnature of why the past was better\nbecause that's your experience right\nwhy the past is better\nmaybe we can try to understand how the\npresent got worse and then the cool\nthing is that if we're lucky we may be\nable to figure out a road map to sort of\nget back to that place\nso let's kind of take a quick look at\nthis\nokay and run through\nyou know\nwhat's going on with nostalgia\nso let's kind of recap so the first\nthing is that for nostalgia some people\nis for some people nostalgia is pleasant\nand for some people nostalgia is\nunpleasant\nand for the people for whom it's\nunpleasant there's a sense of change\nright there's a sense of loss\nand in the pleasant nostalgia things\nwere simpler\nnow my life is more complicated\nit's harder\nright so we'll have these kinds of\nthoughts and then remember we sort of\ntalked a little bit about the potential\nof cognitive bias\nright so what's the\nlevel of cognitive bias is this kind of\ngenerational\nchannel\nromanticism\nis this\ndepressive bias right because when\nyou're depressed your mind is going to\nbe looking at different kinds of things\nlike what's going on here so we can kind\nof acknowledge that\nbut we have to be super careful because\nif we sort of dismiss\nyour experience if we say like oh like\nyou're depressed it actually wasn't that\ngreat and your life isn't that bad right\nnow that doesn't actually help you\nso what i'd like to explore today is\nwhat are the features\nthat make nostalgia pleasant what's what\nare the features that make the past\nmore enjoyable\nbecause if we can understand those then\nwe can start to dig in\nto potentially recreating it in the\npresent\nso first let's kind of take a step back\nand take a look at nostalgia from sort\nof a clinical perspective\nso why does the brain even do nostalgia\nin the first place like what's going on\nhere why does the brains think about the\npast\nwhat advantage of any does it serve so a\ncouple of like axioms a couple of\nassumptions that we're gonna make the\nfirst is that the more i've come to\nunderstand the human brain and\npsychology the more i've come to\nappreciate that even the things that\ncause us pain serve some kind of\nfunction and on the simplest level the\nfact that we feel pain right that makes\nour life worse\nso why on earth have we evolved pain\nreceptors because all it does is hurt us\nthat's because pain actually helps us\nsurvive right so pain is a warning that\nsomething is wrong whether it's\nemotional pain physical pain if someone\nis toxic towards me that's my and i feel\nemotionally hurt by them that's my brain\nand mind's way of signaling to me that\nthis could be a dangerous interaction\nmaybe this person doesn't belong in my\nlife things get super super complicated\nthough and we sort of end up you know\nencouraging that person's abuse of us in\nsome some cases and things like that so\nthat's why we're going to kind of dig in\nand try to understand why are we\nnostalgic in the first place\nso we know from studies on especially\nthings like grief\nand studies on trauma processing\nthat things like rumination\nand dwelling on the past\nare\nnecessary components to emotionally\nprocess\nand then if we emotionally process this\nessentially\ncauses us to move on\nso we can see is that like dwelling on\nthe past serves a function okay we also\nrecently talked a little bit about\ncounterfactual thinking\nwhich just to give you guys a quick\nrefresher is when we think about things\nthat did not happen\nso when i\ngo into the past\nlet's say i did got a b on a chemistry\ntest or c on a chemistry test\nwhat my mind will do is something called\ncounter factual thinking so it'll go\nback into the past and it'll imagine\nscenarios that are factually not true if\ni had studied i would have gotten a b if\ni had studied more i would have gotten a\nif i had done this what if what if if if\nif this is essentially if thinking\nbecause then what your mind is doing is\nit's thinking about things that are\nfactually incorrect\nand so what we know from studies on\ncounter factual thinking is that this\nserves an adaptive\npurpose too it helps us correct our\nbehavior and it also sort of uh creates\na sense of regret that can be used as a\nmotivational drive\nright so sometimes this can get out of\ncontrol where like the regret gets so\npowerful that it negatively impacts our\nmotivation\nbut generally speaking counterfactual\nthinking is something that we engage in\na lot right so we can engage in it we\nprobably engage in it several times a\nday for all kinds of little things like\noh if i had warmed my tea for example\nfor 40 seconds instead of 30 seconds it\nwould have been warm today it would have\nstill been warm right so then i take a\nsip\ni'm like maybe i should have used an\ninsulated cup\nbecause this amount of unpleasantness\ncan cause me to change my behavior\nbecause the truth is that negative\nemotion is a very powerful influencer of\nbehavior\nso i don't know that either of these\nthings are necessary nostalgia but we do\nknow that the brain generally speaking\nor the mind has\ndifferent functions for going into the\npast and sort of like thinking about\nthings\nokay so this is kind of like three\nexamples\nof maybe why we get nostalgic in the\nfirst place\nso then the question becomes\nwhen we think about the past\nwas the past actually better\nnow if the answer is no so one option is\nno\nand then why do we think it's better\nbecause of cognitive bias\nso that's okay right because if this is\nthe case then what we need to do is\ncognitively reframe\nwhich is a useful skill\nso this is something that we actually\nteach people who are depressed they'll\nstart to think oh in the past like\nthings were so much better my life sucks\nnow and you can cognitively reframe to\nsort of develop a sense of gratitude\nactually there are things that i can\nstill be grateful for right some things\nin my life have gotten better but in the\ndepressed mind it doesn't automatically\ndo that so we'll actually sort of create\ncognitive flexibility through things\nlike cognitive behavioral therapy\nokay\nand then in terms of developing\ngratitude this is things like method\nmeditation\nso we can actually deal with the\ncognitive bias or deal with sort of this\nidea that\nlife is actually worse for me now\nbecause it may not be worse\nbut i don't think that that i think\nthat's a very dangerous solution because\nwhat we're sort of doing is like we're\nnot assuming that life was better\nbecause maybe if that was your\nexperience it actually was better and if\nwe assume that life actually was better\nthen what we need to do is explore okay\nwhat are the variables that made life\nbetter because if we can understand that\nwe can potentially recreate those\nokay\nso the first thing that i want to kind\nof talk about for a second\nis when you're young\nthings are in a lot of ways actually\nbetter right so when you're young so i'm\ngonna just share with you all the story\nfrom my own life so when i was like in\nmiddle school\ni played a lot of dungeons and dragons\nand i had a lot of fun playing a lot of\ndungeons and dragons\nand so i would like you know we would\nplay d d basically every weekend we'd\nplay until like four in the morning five\nin the morning six in the morning we'd\nplay till dawn\num and it was just a blast\nright because back then\ni did not worry about stuff now that\ncaused me some problems later on so\nespecially going into high school and\nstuff my grades started to drop things\nlike that i started playing video game\nwe would also have lan parties right so\nit's not just d it would be like we're\ngonna do d this weekend or we're gonna\nhave a lan party if it's a three day\nweekend we're gonna do lan party\nwe're gonna bring all our computers and\nstuff like that\nright over thanksgiving and christmas i\nremember when i was in college\ni had like all these ideas of like oh my\ngod like i'm i'm so far behind on\nchemistry one i need to like really\ncatch up because i got a d and i'm going\ninto chemistry two\nand if i don't like learn chemistry one\nchemistry two is gonna be i'm gonna be\nscrewed for the second half of my\nfreshman year but when christmas rolls\naround and all my friends are in town\nlike we're gonna we're gonna grind d\nbecause i haven't seen these guys in so\nlong\nso there are particular consequences\nthat happened later on but especially\nwhen we look to\nearlier times in our life\nwe don't\nhave as many responsibilities\nand so then you may think okay well now\nthat i have responsibilities does that\nmean that i'm screwed but no let's\nactually tunnel down a little bit\nfurther\nwhat is the effect\nof a responsibility on your mind\nso when we think about what\nresponsibility does\nokay\nresponsibility gets us to think about\nthe future so if i'm like responsible\nfor something my mind will start\nthinking about the future the other\nthing that tends to happen as we get\nolder is that we tend to have regrets\nright hence the nostalgia\nso as we get older by definition\nour mind starts thinking more about the\nfuture and thinking more about the past\nand this is like absolutely\nneuro-developmental so if you look at\nsomething like a you talk to a\nfour-year-old or a five-year-old their\nconcept of time is not very well\ndeveloped and so as a result like you\nknow if you ask a four-year-old like\nwhat's gonna happen next year they don't\nknow what a year is\nso as we get older\nour concept of time continues to evolve\nand grow\nand even with things like social\ninteractions so as we enter puberty\nwe start to realize that people will\nform opinions of us that will be lasting\nthrough time so even an eight-year-old\nmay know what a year is\nbut they don't think in terms of like\nhow is this person gonna think about me\none year from now so we start to add a\ntemporal dimension to people's opinions\nof us during our teenage years\nand so in that way we add temporal\ndimensions to all kinds of stuff and as\nwe start to get older we add a temporal\ndimension to the past because a an\neight-year-old doesn't really think\nabout the past a twelve-year-old doesn't\nreally think about the past\nright a 15 year old starts to think\nabout the past 16 year old thinks about\nthe past a little bit more 25 year old\nis thinking about the past 30 year old\n40 year old 50 year old starts thinking\nabout the past way more\nso the temporal dimension as we get\nolder grows\nand if we look at some of this\nphilosophy from like yoga\nwhat they sort of say is that the more\nthat you live in the present the happier\nyou're going to be and that a huge\nsource of unhappiness comes from\nliving in the future or living in the\npast that when i create expectations for\nmyself\na year from now or two years from now\nand i think when i think a lot about the\nconsequences of my actions oh my god\nwhat happens if i don't go to this party\nif i do go to this party what's going to\nhappen what's going to happen what's\ngoing to happen what's going to happen\nthe more i start living in the future\nthe more my happiness gets destroyed in\nthe present the more i start living in\nthe past the more my happiness gets\ndestroyed in the present and so we can\nsort of see that as you become nostalgic\nit can recall positive emotions\nbut generally speaking anytime i recall\npositive emotions in the past\ni may be i have to be careful because if\ni'm not if i'm not careful what i'm\ngoing to do is that's going to create a\ncontrast in the present which is going\nto create negative emotion which is sort\nof the function of the future in the\npast in terms of how it affects our\nmental health\nso if we think about why was why was the\npast so pleasant it's because we were\nkind of like living in the present\nright living in the present is what\ncreates pleasantness\nand as we get older i know this\nthis is not our fault because if we\nreally think about it our society\nobjectively makes us think more about\nthe future and more about the past as we\nget older we have the luxury of living\nin the present when we're kids our brain\nlets us live in the present society lets\nus live in the present\nas we get older\nboth of those things change and this is\nwhere i think we make a huge mistake\nbecause we don't teach or prepare people\nfor this change\nright so we'll say like vague things\nlike we'll say like enjoy your youth\nwhile it lasts\nbut like if someone tells you that\nthey just say that and they laugh\nand then\nyou're like okay\nright no one is ever like hey here are\nthe ways that you enjoy things here is\nwhat's going to change for you\nright and it's it's like here and and\nthe other thing is that sometimes people\nwill tell us\nlike by the way adulthood sucks like by\nthe way like you're going to have a\nmortgage to pay one day okay so like how\ndo i cope with that\nright so they may even tell us what\nchanges but they don't tell us like how\ndo i deal with that because the truth is\nthat objectively as you get older and\nyour responsibility increases\nsociety pulls you away from the present\nbut we're not taught how to hang on\nto that presentness\nright so we're like it's a skill but\nlike we're not taught that skill and\nthis is the issue is that when you're\nyoung living in the present is easy it\nbecomes very natural and no one pushes\nyou out of it but as we get older and\nour brain develops we're not taught how\nto remain in the present even those\nsociety and your mind are pulling you\ninto the future and pulling you into the\nfa into the past\nso this is a big problem\nright so like let's look at it\nobjectively like as you get older like\nyou're gonna have you know when you when\nyou're 10 and you go to school you don't\nhave to think about the semester you\ndon't have to think about your grade you\njust go to school you get your homework\nyou go home presumably do your homework\noccasionally you'll have a test you kind\nof have to study for the test but not\nreally\nso you don't really have to think about\nthe future as you get a little bit older\nyou have to start thinking about tests\nyou have to think about studying\nthen you have to think about paying\nbills then you have to think about\npaying mortgages\nthen as you enter your like\ni mean i varies depending on your\nculture and your situation but like then\nyou enter into this whole marriage and\nkids dimension\nwhere it's like you know you'll meet\nsomeone one day like you're not really\ntoo worried about it maybe in 1920 if\nyou're lucky you're still able to live\nin the present but then we'll also see\nlike 19 year olds and 20 year olds who\nare terrified of being alone for the\nrest of their life\nand i saw\nthese posts where people are like i've\nbeen perpetually alone i'm 19 years old\nand it's like how long is perpetual\ni've been alone my entire life\ni'm 16. and it's like\nyou know it's kind of weird to me being\nas old as i am i mean that that's their\nexperience and it's terrifying for them\nso i you know i try not to judge but\nit's kind of interesting right so if you\nlook at that person why is the 16 year\nold unhappy for being\nalone their entire life\nversus the 16 year old who's like yeah\ni'm not dating\ni haven't dated anyone\nso like i'm not dating\nis more happy so like let's let's just\nlike look at this right so let's look at\nwhat adding the temporal dimension\ndoes\ni'm not dating\ni'm not or i\nlet's do this one actually\ni haven't\ndated\nyet\nor i've let's do this\nbeen alone\nmy entire life\nokay\nnow here's the thing\nall of these statements can come from a\n17 year old\nright\nlike this person can objectively be the\nsame age\nbut\nas and i would say that like this has\nthe least amount of temporal\nthis is like medium temporal\nand this has\na large temporal\nyou all see that\nso literally adding the temporal\ndimension\nis going to correlate with suffering\nright and as like even as a therapist if\ni'm working with someone like this\nthe process of cognitive reframing is\ngoing in this direction\nright i'm just not dating this is like\nin the present\nokay\nso as we get older it's kind of\ninteresting but like there's there's an\nelement of temporal dimension which gets\nadded to our lives is we have to start\nthinking about mortgages and stuff like\nthis\nand that's where\nlike we tend to\nstart worrying about stuff and we start\nto feel nostalgic because life was so\nmuch simpler because life was simpler\nlike objectively it was simpler you\ndon't have to pay a mortgage\nyour parents weren't like asking you\nwhen you're going to have kids\nbecause they want grandkids\nright and like you're sitting there\nyou've got 100k in student loan debt\ni'm assuming you're american okay\nyou've got 100k in student loan debt\nyou've been dating someone for two or\nthree years housing prices are through\nthe roof\nyou have no idea if you're going to be\nable to afford a kid\nand all of that anxiety and all of that\nworry and all of that pressure\nyour parents don't really appreciate\nright\nso we add so much temporal dimension our\nsociety adds so much temporal dimension\nbecause we need it to survive that's the\nway that life works\nthe challenge is that we don't really\nunderstand that that's what we're doing\nwe don't really understand that that's\nwhere the unhappiness comes from and the\nmost devastating thing\nis that we also quickly jump to the\nconclusion that that's the only way to\ndo it\nwhat other choice do i have this is the\nway the world is\ngot a big choice\nright because how much have you tried to\nstep away from the temporal dimension\nthis is where you're gonna say something\nlike oh like what i should just stop\npaying my bills and ignore everything no\nright because those are realities we're\nnot saying ignore them\nbut how much does thinking about it\nactually help\nit right so if i've got a bill to pay at\nthe end of the month\nthere's a certain amount of like\nthinking i have to do about it there's a\ncertain amount of work i have to do\nabout it\nbut it's my inability to stop dwelling\non it that destroys my happiness i'm not\nsaying that objectively it's better to\nhave more money and like not have bills\nto pay and stuff like that that's my\nwhole point is that there's an objective\ndecrease\nin the quality of your life once you\nbecome an adult in some ways right but\nthere we can also cognitively reframe\nbecause i can have cookies for lunch\ntoday if i want to there's some\nadvantages to being adult that's where\nthe cognitive reframe comes in but let's\nassume for a moment that objectively\nyour life is harder as an adult as a kid\nthan a kid and that that nostalgia was\nthere because you were free of all of\nyour future and past thought\nso what can you do now\nokay so there are a couple of important\nissues that we need to remember okay\nso the first\nso how to deal\nwith nostalgic loss\nso the first thing\nis that we assume\nthe circumstances\ncreate the happiness\nso i'll give you all the example right\nso i used to play a bunch of d\nand so i'm i'm now 39\nand like i thought like so i got\ntogether recently with some friends of\nmine and we started playing d d again\nand i was like man it's gonna be dope\ni scheduled like a bunch of stuff like\nand i was like we used to play d and\nuntil three or four in the morning and\nit's so much fun\nso we get together at two in the\nafternoon and we're all old men now\nand like we can't play d d till four in\nmorning we can't eat like taco bell and\ndrink mountain dew by the leader\nbecause we're like old men and so like\nwe'll do things like\nwe'll make like a like a fruit plate\nand we'll play for like six to eight\nhours\nyeah my back aches by 7 pm you're damn\nright i can't sit in a chair for eight\nhours\nwe got up and we'd take a walk in the\nmiddle like we'd go out for a walk\nand like some of us like i even started\ndoing yoga we were doing like push-ups\nrandomly during the middle of the d d\nsession\nlike we just can't handle the debauchery\nanymore\nright you're damn right grapes and\ncheese not just grapes and cheese it was\nlike strawberries like one person\nbrought pita crackers there was hummus\nit's like protein\nright\nand and so this is the thing is that we\nassume that it's the circumstances\nand then what we try to do is we try to\nrecreate that happiness\nright because this is what the brain\ndoes the brain is like what made me\nhappy in the past that will make me\nhappy in the future\nokay and now some of y'all are saying\nthis is mature d d it sounds dope but\nhere's the thing\nif i'm trying to recreate my teenage\nexperience of d d it's gonna feel like\nit sucks it's nowhere near dude we\nplayed so much d and d\nand it's like we just can't handle it\nanymore so then what you can do is lean\ninto that right make the most of them be\nlike all right we're gonna do like\nmaturity indeed\nright this is what we're gonna do so\nlike now we plan our menu ahead of time\nlike all right we're gonna do this we're\ngonna do this\nyou know like we're gonna do some of\nthis stuff\nyou guys want to take a break oh my god\nso we try to recreate that happiness and\nthereby we actually lose sight of the\npresent so instead when you kind of\nnotice like your current circumstances\nyou can actually lean into your present\nto create happiness\nbut as long as you're trying to hold on\nto the past it's not gonna work and this\nis the kind of thing where people will\nsay\ndon't hold on to the past but then\neveryone's like how do i do that like\nwhat do you mean by that what does that\npractically look like what does it mean\nto not hold on to the past what it means\nis to recognize that the past is gone\nrecognize that your situation is has\nchanged and try to like literally adjust\nyour current situation based on your\ncircumstances so forget about the past\nand say okay i want to play d d i like d\nd but i'm 39 years old\ni have these friends we have these time\ncommitments how can we make this\nexperience as enjoyable as possible\nhow can i make the the present enjoyable\nas possible that's how you let go of the\npast and you optimize it\nokay\nthe next thing\nto understand is that like\nwe sort of talked about this a little\nbit but\nyou know learning to live in the present\nis key\nand the key thing here is that\nwe have to understand that this is going\nto be harder as you grow\nolder\nbecause it was natural for you earlier\nbut over time society in your brain is\ngoing to add a temporal dimension the\ntemporal stress is going to increase so\nwhat you actually have to do is it used\nto be automatic like it was easy right\nit's like back when i was in the fifth\ngrade i didn't have to study so i never\ndeveloped good study habits so then when\ni hit college like i was sol because now\nwhat's going on is like this is my\nlet's say\nintelligence\nand here is my\nhere is the difficulty of the material\nand so this is the gap where i should be\nlearning how to study\nand if i don't learn how to study then\nthen what's going to happen is like i'm\ngoing to be screwed once i cross this\nthreshold\nright this is going to be like gg\nthis is the gg zone\nand in the same way this is what you can\nsay the same thing about living in the\npresent as a skill so mindfulness is a\nskill being able to meditate so over\nhere it's really easy like we don't have\nto learn how to do it and then we hit\nthis point but then what happens is like\nno one is like hey by the way the reason\nthat you're struggling right now is\nbecause you have not learned the skill\nof living in the present\nand then as things get\nlike more and more right we get more and\nmore overwhelmed\nthis redness gets like more and more\nintense the higher up the bigger this\ngap is right here the more we begin to\nsuffer and then we find ourselves in our\n25 25 year old 26 year old 27 year old\nif you're in the us for example student\nloans like it when you're 18 years old\nand you take out 120 000 of student\nloans to pay for college you don't\nreally have a temporal appreciation\nbut when you're 25 and 26 and you're\npaying off your student loans\nand you recognize that like this is\ngonna have a temporal effect for the\nnext eight years of your life boy does\nthat hurt\nright and then that's that's the the\nbarrier of this pain and this is where\npeople are sort of talking about things\nlike oh like you know cancel student\ndebt and stuff like that and it's not my\nplace to comment on whether that's a\ngood idea or a bad idea but what i'm\nsaying is that you sure you can cancel\nstudent debt but it's not the other\nthing that you can not the other thing\nin addition to that learning how to live\nin the present is a skill\nso this is where like the solution to\nthese temporal problems people are sort\nof looking for circumstances they're\nlooking for like this thing to change\nand come down here\nso we try to create recreate the\ncircumstances of being debt-free we try\nto recreate the circumstances of plain\ndnd we try to recreate these\ncircumstances of the past\nthe problem is that the more we lean\ninto that strategy the more screwed we\nare because you can never get the past\nback\nthat's a big revelation of living in the\npresent so the third thing to understand\nis that life is changing\nin transient by nature\nso this can have a couple and i\nencourage you all to just think about\nthis\nbecause this can have a couple of\ntransformative impacts on your life\nso\nwhen you start to think about how life\nis changing and transient the first\nthing that happens is people get\nterrified\nthey're like how do i\nhold on to something because that's what\nwe want to do right we want this\nhappiness for the rest of our lives\nand so then what happens is like if\nwe're not even careful\nthe acknowledgement that life is trans\ntransient damages our happiness because\nthen what happens is anytime we're happy\nwe're like when am i gonna lose this\nwhen is the other shoe gonna drop when\nwill this leave\nand then you can't even enjoy it because\nyou're paranoid about losing it because\ndr k told you on the internet that life\nis is transient and nothing lasts\nforever so now i'm terrified because i\nwant to hold on to it\nbut if you really kind of focus for a\nlittle while and you start to really\nthink through it\nit can transform it's like hard it's\nkind of binary and is where you got to\nmeditate and really like just think\nabout it okay\nif life is transient how do you want to\nlive what's the only way to live the\nonly way to live is in the present right\nso you can sit there you've got this one\nthing in front of you this tea is\ncooling with every passing second i\ncan't keep it hot forever\nit's the only choice i have for\nhappiness the only way i have\nto enjoy the tea is to drink it now\nbecause i can't keep it warm forever\nso the only way the only solution is to\nact now to embrace the present\nand then what happens is like it's kind\nof interesting because this can be\ntransformed because once you realize\nthat now is the only time to enjoy it\nyou will enjoy it fully\nright so i want you all to think a\nlittle bit about like you know if you\nget one thing before you die\nit's like a coin flip where that is\neither gonna be like you know\nthe best thing of your life or it's\ngonna taste awful because all you're\nthinking about is the impending loss\nright so like once you realize that\nthings are transient like that's when\nyou can really start to enjoy them\nit's kind of bizarre but once you\nrealize that this flower is only going\nto be in bloom for this moment or this\namount of time and i don't know instead\nof being paranoid about when the flower\npetals will fall off and when the\nfragrance will go away just\nenjoy the flower\nright and then you can look back on it\nyou can say wow that was a great flower\nthen you have to be a little bit careful\nbecause you can say oh i wish there was\nanother one but the more that you're\nthinking i wish there was another one\nthe more you're losing sight of the\nthousand things around you that you can\nonly enjoy in this moment\nand so once you adopt this kind of mind\nshift which i'm not saying is easy you\nhave to understand that like\nlook at all of the temporal influences\non your mind\nand then set all of those temporal\ninfluences aside for a moment this is\nwhy it's a practice it's a skill\nand try to enjoy just one thing\nand then what you'll realize which is\nlike really neat\nis that your enjoyment of the thing is\nactually determined by your presence in\nthe moment\nthat even this tea even though it's\ncooler can still be enjoyed\nright there are some things about it\nthat i can appreciate\nand so the more that you move in that\ndirection i'm not saying you should\nignore your bills it's just like work\nwhen you need to work and then have\nsatisfaction that today i've done what i\ncan i've moved sure like\nyou know i'm not making much money right\nnow but like i've moved in the direction\nthat i need to to like it's gonna take\nme eight years to pay off my student\nloans but i did what i could today\nand i've worked for eight hours or nine\nhours i did one hour of overtime i've\nchipped away at it and then i have two\nor three hours i'm gonna try to enjoy\nmyself as best as i can\nright so that's what it means to live in\nthe present be cognizant of it be\nrecognized that your life may be\nobjectively worse\nand that you can still\nextract water from the stone that is\nlife it's absolutely possible it doesn't\nfeel that way right\nit feels like you can squeeze and\nsqueeze and squeeze and you're not\ngetting anything out of it but that's\nbecause of the way that you're living\nbecause all you're thinking about is the\neight years of suffering so even today\nlike whether you have eight years of\nsuffering or one if you're paying off\nyour student loans tomorrow or you're\npaying off your student loans in 30 days\nor 30\nyears the sandwich that you eat today is\ngoing to taste the same you can either\nenjoy it or not enjoy it\nright this is what people are going to\nsay but yeah but like if i like\nif i didn't have student loans to pay\nlike i'd eat like a very fancy sandwich\nand it would taste better sure\ni'm not saying that that isn't true but\neven the some the humble grilled cheese\ncan be delicious\nbut the more that you're in your head\nabout paying off your debt\nthe less you're gonna enjoy the grilled\ncheese\nyeah and someone is saying being out of\ndebt does not equal happiness by the way\nright so that's another big thing but\nthat's like that's exactly my point is\nthat happiness is somewhat independent\nof your circumstances\nthere's also data that shows that\nfinancial security makes people more\nhappier or\ni would i wouldn't say makes people more\nhappy i would say\nis fertile ground for happiness to grow\nin\nso in my experience financial security\nand financial freedom is like the\nquality of the soil\nyou can still get a desert rose\nbut it's way easier with a bunch of\nfertilizer\nthis is all we got how does that go over\nour heads\nbecause\nit's easy because we're not thinking\nabout what we have we're thinking about\nwhat we used to have and we're thinking\nabout what we could have\nthat's how all we've got goes over our\nheads\nso i know it's kind of weird but at the\nend of the day i think that nostalgia\nlike if we kind of just recap right so\nnostalgia is there for a reason\nwe know that there are a lot of\ndifferent functions in the mind whether\nit's trauma processing grief processing\ncounterfactual thinking for performance\nimprovement\nwhich is why our mind goes into the past\nin the first place\nnow\nis does the past seem better just\nbecause of cognitive bias and memories\nand selection bias and stuff like that\nthere may be an element of that\nespecially if you're in a depressive\nmindset right because then you're going\nto compare and contrast and you're going\nto take you're going to come to the\nworst conclusions and you're going to\nyour mind is going to be like moving\naway from positive information\nbut i think if we sort of stop there if\ni were to say yeah your brain does it\nbecause it's evolved to do it and yeah\nit's all cognitive bias in your head\nthat doesn't actually help you in this\nmoment\nbecause if we look at it objectively\nthe past is usually better\nright if we're thinking about better\ntimes like there's a lot to say about\nthe past actually being better and a lot\nof that has to do with our innocence\nand what does innocence mean innocence\nmeans living in the present\nright it means not having that temporal\ndimension and what happens as we get\nolder is we start thinking about time\nmore we have to\nsociety makes us do it our brains make\nus do it and no one teaches us by the\nway as your brain starts thinking about\ntime more\nyour propensity for anxiety will\nincrease your propensity for regret will\nincrease\nyour fear of the future will increase\nyour ability to enjoy yourself in the\npresent will become harder\nso let me teach you\nhow to account for that difference\nright because we teach people how to\nstretch like kids don't need to stretch\nthat much adults need to stretch a lot\nyou know the number of adults that i've\nseen that have pulled a muscle or the\nnumber of times that i've pulled a\nmuscle when i was a kid and the kind of\ncrazy physical stuff that i used to do\nversus now it's like night and day i\nused to do way more way crazier stuff\nand now like picking up a child i pulled\nmuscle in my back by picking up a child\nso as people as we as we like grow older\nlike we warn people\nand so we have stretching baked into our\nsociety like you learn how to stretch\neven though you don't really need to as\na kid\nright but we don't teach us like what is\nthis what is that cognitive flexibility\nwhat is the cognitive stretch that we\nneed to do to be able to enjoy and\nappreciate the present because the more\nthat we hold on the past the more that\nwe try to recreate the past the more\nit's not going to work because life is\ndifferent now\nand so we have to learn how to like live\nin the present learn how to craft things\nto our benefit so instead of assuming if\nyou liked a particular activity instead\nof just trying to recreate that\nexperience try to optimize it for today\nso how are things different how can i\nmake this as as pleasant as possible\nyou know when i'm making grilled cheese\nshould i switch from butter to olive oil\nbecause olive oil is a little bit\nhealthier\nright there are all kinds of\noptimizations that you can do\nquestions\nhow can we separate present thinking\nfrom making impulsive decisions i could\nsee it as a justification for doing risk\nrisky things you're absolutely correct\nso present thinking\nis\noftentimes used as\nlike\na justification for making bad decisions\nright we talked about that a little bit\nso that's where i think that\nlet me think about that this for a\nsecond it's a good question\nso here's what i'd say\npresent thinking is not willfully\nignoring the future or the past\nso to be in the present\nmeans also a present focused\nappreciation for the future\nright so like i i don't know if this is\ngonna kind of make sense but it's it's\nsort of subtle so\nin my present circumstances let's say i\nhave a ten thousand dollar loan to pay\ni can worry about the ten 10 000\nloan\ni can say oh i'm living in the present\ntherefore i'm going to completely ignore\nthe 10 000 loan\nbut that's not actually living in the\npresent because in the present you have\nthat 10 000 of\ndebt so the real road is somewhere in\nthe middle where it's like\nin my present circumstance i have a loan\nwhich i am paying off at the rate that i\nam comfortable with\nand i'm going to enjoy today\ni don't know if that makes sense but\nsometimes what people will do is they'll\nuse present focused thinking\nas a way to ignore their present\ncircumstances whereas that that's a\npresent circumstance you can't actually\nignore that\nand that's why it's a skill because it's\nreally easy to do one it's really easy\nto do the other\nit's doing it in the middle where you're\nlike okay i'm acknowledging that i have\nten thousand dollars of debt i'm not\ngoing to pay it off today i'm gonna pay\noff twenty dollars of it today and i'm\ngonna pay off twenty dollars for the\nnext you know if i pay twenty dollars a\nday over one course of over the year\nit'll be\nsix thousand dollars\nright more\nseventy two seventy two thousand seventy\nthree thousand dollars i'm sorry seven\nthousand three hundred dollars\nright\nso\nthat that's how you do it it's like i'm\ngonna pay my 20 bucks today it's an\nappreciation of the debt it's\nacknowledgment of the present\nand like i'm gonna enjoy the rest of it\nright so i earned 40 bucks a day i'm\ngoing to pay off 20 of that i'm going to\nenjoy the rest\nmake sense\nyeah so how do you deal with all the bad\nemotions like getting older feeling\nlonely lacking purpose do you have to\nconfront those feelings absolutely we'll\nget to that in a second the next thing\nwe're going to talk about relates to\nthat somewhat\nah so so\nso like getting older\nis has a temporal component\nright so like when we say like it has a\ncomparative component\nso the way that you deal with all of\nthese kinds of things so lacking purpose\ntoo\ngenerally speaking like lacking purpose\nis like a temporal emotion\ni'm not like sitting there on the toilet\nlike sometimes this can happen where you\ncan have like an existential panic\nattack\nwhere like lacking purpose like hits you\nin the present but generally speaking\nlacking purpose is like a emergent\nproperty\nright you lack purpose over the course\nof a day or a week or a month or a year\nor a decade\nand you can work on that so that's where\nlike confronting those feelings is\nimportant because\nnegative feelings are signals\nfor you to change\nright so it's okay like you have to\nacknowledge them like if you're lonely\nlike that's something that you can do\nsomething around right that's also where\nlike\nnegative emotions are also compasses to\nmove you in the right direction\nso i was talking to someone who was an\nartist\nand they were kind of saying to me that\nthey realized one day that like they\nwere unsatisfied with their music and\nthey used to beat themselves up about it\na lot because of the dissatisfaction but\nthen one day they realized that the\ndissatisfaction of the music is like a\nsign of their good taste\nand also when that feeling is satisfied\nthat's when they know they've made good\nmusic\nand so they\nthey course correct over and over and\nover again\nand they kind of lean into that\ndissatisfaction\nand that's how they know how it needs to\nbe fixed so if they're dissatisfied with\na piece of music that they make what\nneeds to be better about it they make\nthat change what needs to be better\nabout it they make that change and as\nthey move in that direction they wind up\nwith satisfaction and they wind up with\naward-winning music\nand so even things like feeling lonely\ncan be the same way it's like what are\nthe times in your life what should you\ngravitate towards if you feel lonely\nwhat i've realized is that as i get\nolder i'm more likely to project my\nmomentary pain as if life will be this\npain from now on what can you suggest to\nthat remove the temporal component\nright so that's exactly what we're\ntalking about\nso your mind is going to project this\npresent circumstance into the future\ni'll be alone forever\nnews flash you can't see the future no\none can\nso that thought i know is kind of weird\nis like actually just wrong\nlike unless you have a time traveling\nmachine or you're talking to someone\nfrom the future you have no idea what\nthe future holds\nthe other interesting thing to remember\nis that\nthat is going to make all kinds of\nimpacts on your current behavior because\nif this pain will last forever\nif it's a certainty of the future\nwhat does that do to your motivation\nright so there's there's a\npeople have done studies on hopelessness\nand rats\nand once you create hopeless\ncircumstances for a rat so it's kind of\na cruel study\nit's a slight trigger warning here\nwhat they'll do is they'll drop a rat\nin like a bucket of water\nand they'll see how long it swims\nbefore it gives up there's no way out\nright they don't actually drown the rat\nonce it gives up they pull it out\nbut that hopelessness once you have\nhopelessness you give up and you stop\ntrying and so the problem is that once\nwe start to think that momentary pain\nis forever\nwe give up\nthe challenge is that unlike the\nexperiment there ain't no bucket\nand no one's gonna pull us out\nso there is actually a path forward\nit's not artificially closed it feels\nthat way to us but the moment we give up\nthat's when we actually drown\nbecause the circumstances are very\ndifferent\nno one's going to pull us out\nwhich sucks but on the upside we're not\nactually in a bucket\nright we're in a pool of water and\nthere's a shore somewhere there's land\nsomewhere\nso understand that your mind may want to\ndo that notice the activity of the mind\nas it tries to project into the future\nnotice what it does to your motivation\nand your desire for effort\nand then recognize that you can't really\nlike that thought is coming that future\nprojection is actually coming from an\nemotion it's not coming from a logical\nplace\nand even if you say but i have all this\nevidence\ni'll be alone forever don't you see i'm\n17 years old and i've asked out two\npeople\nor i've asked out or i'm 25 years old\nand i've asked out 25 people you can\nhave as much evidence as you want to\nbut people can be alone until they're\nnot\nright that's where like maybe you need\nto be a little bit more careful about\nhow you ask people out like you may have\nsome kind of like red flag in your\nprocess\nright so like be reflective don't just\nassume like it's the reason that you're\nalone may have something to do with your\nbehavior\nso we're not i'm not disputing your\nevidence i'm just saying that your\nevidence is incomplete and doesn't\nnecessarily conclude that you shouldn't\nbother with anything\nmore practically there are practices\nthat can teach your mind to live in the\npresent to train yourself to be in the\npresent all meditation does this\nso meditation will help with that\nokay\nso universal emperor is saying the\npresent sucks\ni disagree with that in 98 of cases\nso in my overwhelming experience the\nmore you lean into the present the\nbetter life gets\ni wish i could say a hundred percent but\ni've had a couple of experiences where\nall of my meditative strength and energy\nand mana and experience\nfall short for me with nausea\nand vomiting\nwhich like\ni just can't enjoy the present\nwhen i'm puking i've tried boy have i\ntried\num but like in most cases like including\nsocial things work things setbacks all\nthat kind of stuff like you can still\nenjoy the present\nyou"
