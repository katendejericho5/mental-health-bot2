    "transcript": "the truth is that we learn how to not be\nauthentic because being authentic\nusually doesn't go over well when our\nparents ask us how are you doing today\nand we say i'm doing fine mom and you\nsee the relief in their eyes\nyou care and love about your parents\nand so you don't want to let them know\nlike what you're struggling with so each\nof these lies they're like building up\nthis karmic debt of like pain and\nsuffering and so it's interesting\nbecause it's not just the theory of\nkarma there's like evidence that that\nthis is\ndamaging psychologically a lot of times\nwhat causes us to use substances\nis we have all these crushing karmic\ndebts which are weighing on us right oh\nmy god oh my god we've got some kind of\nnegative emotion in here that we carry\nwith us and that negative emotion is\nwhat causes us to reach for the alcohol\nmore easily\n[Music]\nso this is a tweet that someone sent me\num i think from sean mendes who i\nunderstand is a\nmusical artist of\nquite a bit of success i believe i'm not\ntoo sure not too familiar with their\nwork\nso sometimes i ask myself what it is\nthat i should be doing with my life and\nwhat i always hear in return is to tell\nthe truth to be the truth\ni feel like that's a hard thing to do\nthough i'm afraid that if people know\nand see the truth they might think less\nof me they might become bored of me so\nin those moments of feeling low i either\nput on a show or hide\nthe truth is\nin current form\nis a 23 year old who constantly feels\nlike he's either flying or drowning\nmaybe that's just what it is to be in\nyour 20s i don't know or maybe that's\njust me\nthe truth is i really do want to show up\nin the world as 100 true honest unique\nself and not care about what anyone\nthinks sometimes i do\nsometimes i really don't care what\npeople think and i feel free\nmost of the time it's a struggle though\nthat's the truth the truth is even with\nso much success i still find it hard to\nfeel like i'm not failing\nhyper focused on what i don't have\nforget forgetting to see all that i do\nthe truth is i'm overwhelmed and\noverstimulated lol the truth is also\nthat i'm okay\ni'm just trying to tell and be the truth\ni like to think that maybe me saying\nthis might resonate with some people\nso\ni think there's a lot of good stuff in\nhere\nright so when i when i read this what i\nsort of hear\nis that people say be authentic\nright people say don't care about what\nother people think you do you hater's\ngonna hate\nbut the truth is like it's not that easy\nright the truth is we we do care about\nwhat people think\nthe truth is that\noftentimes people who don't care about\nwhat people think\nare\nright so it's like how do you navigate\nthis\nbecause you do care about what people\nthink and you're afraid that if you are\nauthentic with them that they're gonna\nbe bored of you\nor they won't like it\nand where did you get that idea\nis that some fiction that you made up in\nyour head unfortunately probably not\nthe truth is that we learn how to not be\nauthentic because being authentic\nusually doesn't go over well\nright so we learn how to hide because\nwhen our parents ask us how are you\ndoing today\nand we say i'm doing fine mom and you\nsee the relief in their eyes\nyou care and love about your parents\nand so you don't want to let them know\nlike what you're struggling with\nright so when you say mom i'm struggling\nand then mom doesn't know what to do she\ncan't help\nand then she frets\nand asks me more questions gives me\nsuggestions tell me to just exercise\nmore here i got you some vitamin d it'll\nhelp\nand then the next day rolls around mom\nis like did you take the vitamin d\nis it helping yet\nand then like she's trying so hard she\nloves you so much\nyou don't want to disappoint her\nright so you're like yeah mom it's\nreally helping\ni feel so much better already\nand then she's like oh\nsee the relief\nright so why how do we learn to not be\nauthentic because like\nit pays to not be authentic\nright oh you're in a job interview\nwhy do you want to work here\nbecause i have crippling debt and i\ndon't have a choice\ntell me a little bit about yourself\nare you excited to work here yeah\ni'm so excited i'm going to try to do\nthe minimum amount of work possible\nand inflate my resume to try to\nnegotiate for a good salary\nright\nhow do we like\nbeing authentic is hard\nlet's understand that\nlet's understand that sometimes the\nworld does not appreciate authenticity\nright and it's not just like the\nnegative situations\nit's like yeah i'm gonna wear this\nparticular outfit because it makes me\nfeel good and i don't really care what\npeople think\nand then when you're out there in chad\nmode wearing what you want to not caring\nwhat people think how do people feel\nabout you it's no personal thing to them\nright you're not doing anything to\nnegatively impact their lives but here\nyou are living in authenticity and i\nhave to live my life a lie i'm spending\nso much time\nand effort trying to look great for\nother people and you're just out there\nenjoying yourself how dare you\nand so then like\nthe jealousy the envy and the toxicity\ncomes out how dare you live your life\nwhen i am suffering\nauthenticity can be a threat to other\npeople\nright they don't like it\nit's not fair\nso being authentic is tough\nit's tough on in a lot of ways\nso what do we do\nwe start to put on a mask\nand what i want to do is actually sort\nof share with y'all\nsort of almost like a karmic perspective\nor a spiritual perspective here\nso then like what happened so when we\nput on a mask we start to create this\nsort of situation right where now i've\nput on a mask and i've created a certain\namount of falsehood\nand then i get kind of stuck because\nlike if i want to live authentically\ni have to correct that falsehood\nand so if i tell my mom actually the\nvitamin d doesn't help at all\nthere's like the lying there's the her\ndisappointment there's the why didn't\nyou tell me\nand then it's like you have another\nopportunity to put on a mask well\nbecause when i am honest with you your\nresponse actually makes me feel worse\nand makes you feel guilty like you can\nbe honest with but you don't say that\nright and so you just say i don't know\nyou're not authentic\nso with each moment of authenticity\nyou're signing yourself up for some\namount of pain\nyou're signing yourself up and so now\nwhat happens is we've been doing this\nour entire life we've been wearing this\nmask\nso we have this like karmic backlog of\nlike\npain from authenticity\nbecause we've been living our life like\nsort of like a lie right and the more we\nlive our life of allah is a lie like it\npiles up\nso i once was working with someone\nwho was just lying\nabout\ngoing to school\nso like you know they they stopped\ncoming to classes and i was like hey i\nhaven't seen you recently they're like\nyeah i just do all my work from home and\nstuff like that you know it's fine\nand then they were a friend of mine so\nthey continued to tell their parents\nlike oh yeah like school is going great\nschool is going great\nthey got engaged\nyou know they were supposed to be in\nmedical school but they had kind of\ndropped out been kicked out\netc\nand just like continued living a lie\nwould wake up every day\nwould leave the house\nhang outside\nlike\nwander to the streets for eight or nine\nhours\ncome home\ntell their fiance they had a good day\nthey're super stressed because of work\nor because of school\npretending to be a med student\nso with each of these lies they're like\nbuilding up\nthis karmic debt of like pain and\nsuffering\nand it gets to be so bad that like you\ncan't ever take it off you can't ever\ncome clean\nbecause there's just so much pain\nthat you've built up\nright\nand so that's that's where like i know\nit sounds kind of weird but this is why\ni like i lean on the theory of karma\nhere\nand so it's interesting because it's not\njust the theory of karma there's like\nevidence that that this is\ndamaging psychologically and evidence\nthat\ndealing with this is actually good for\npeople psychologically which we'll get\nto in a second\nso every time we put on a mask we're\njust delaying or creating a potential\npain in someone else this is what i want\nyou all to understand so the question is\nhow do we live authentically\nright especially if we've got this big\nbacklog\nso we're going to talk a little bit\nabout alcoholics anonymous\nso alcoholics anonymous\na lot of generalizations here okay so\nit's not a perfect organization by any\nmeans there's a lot of toxicity that\nhappens within the organization there\nare a lot of other addictions that\npeople will substitute for instead of\nalcohol\nbut i think there are a couple things\nthat they really get right and so\nremember that alcoholics anonymous is\nalso like a spiritual\nthing\nso for some people that really rubs them\nthe wrong way because that spirituality\nturns into like religiosity and it turns\ninto like a certain amount of\nforcing a particular perspective on\nother people on to other people but i\nthink there are elements of this that\nare spiritual that are really really\nhealthy\nso alcoholics anonymous has this step\ncalled making amends\nand this is really important because a\nlot of times what causes us to use\nsubstances\nis we have all these crushing karmic\ndebts which are weighing on us right oh\nmy god oh my god we've got some kind of\nnegative emotion in here that we carry\nwith us and that negative emotion is\nwhat causes us to reach for the alcohol\nmore easily\nand so how does making amends\nhelp with sobriety we don't really know\nbut it does\nso what someone who's who's an aaa does\nis they start making phone calls\nto people that they have wronged\nall these karmic debts that they have\nracked up\nthrough their drinking\nthey go and they they start like telling\npeople hey by the way when we were\ndating\nyou know i wasn't entirely honest with\nyou i lied about this this and this\nand i actually like you mentioned a\ncouple times that there was money\nmissing from your wallet i was the one\nwho took it and i took it to buy alcohol\ni apologize for that i'd like to pay you\nback\nso that karmic debt which they wanted to\nslide past right because that's what we\ndo\nwe go and we own it\nwe pay that price we experience that\npain\nand it hurts\nbut something weird happens this is what\nwe don't quite understand\nwhen you pay that debt it increases your\nchance of sobriety\nright as we start being authentic\nbecause that's essentially what aa is\ndoing right people in who are making\namends are like literally being\nauthentic they lied about something and\nthey're going back in time and they're\ncorrecting it\nso they make amends and then that this\nleads to a greater a positive outcome in\nterms of sobriety so there's some\nevidence that we don't know exactly what\nan aaa works but something about it\nseems to help people not everyone\nright because there's also variability\nwithin aaa and things like that and\nthere could be damaging things in it too\nbut there's something about paying this\nkarmic debt\nand that's what's hard about living an\nauthentic life because in that moment of\nauthenticity\nwe're not delaying that pain\nright we have to experience it there\nthen and there\nso when it comes to how do i live a life\nof authenticity\nright so how do i take the mask off and\nthis is where for some people\nthe amount of\npain that they've racked up the amount\nof lies they've racked up the amount of\nkarmic debt they've racked up\nis too much to handle\nso you can't take the mask off and you\ncan't be authentic which is okay\ni know it sounds kind of weird but it's\nokay\nso this is where if you can do something\nlike go back and make amends like that\ncan be very very helpful it's going to\nfeel liberating\nand it's it's weird the reason that i\nuse spirituality instead of talking\nabout the research of a.a like today and\ntalking about karma is because\ni think the spiritual tradition has a\nbetter language that is like more\naccessible and more understandable and\nmore relatable to the human experience\nthan science does it may not be correct\nbut it makes sense and it's it's utility\ncan be greater\nso if you're someone who's struggling to\nlive an authentic life and you say like\nhow do i live authentically\nit comes down to moments even if you've\ngot this backlog don't worry i'm not\ntelling you to go and make amends and\nstart living radical authenticity\nwhat you can start doing is stop\naccruing the karmic debt that you can do\ntoday forget about all the crap that you\nhave to pay back\nforget about telling your parents that\nyou actually dropped out of school two\nyears ago and you've been faking it\nright like you don't have to do that yet\ndon't worry\nbut you can start living authentically\ntoday then when they ask you when they\ncall and they say\nyou know how are you doing today you can\nsay i'm really not doing well\nright you can start there so i'm going\nto give you guys a story it's a little\nbit more of a fun story\nso one of my teachers was a swami\nokay so a swami is like\na religious is there like a monk who's\nit's like the phd equivalent of a monk\nthat's like a monk with a doctoral\ndegree so when you reach a certain level\nof like competence basically like sort\nof the highest rank\nof monks you become a swami\nso even within the hindu tradition there\nare two kinds of priests there are\neveryday priests who can get married\nhave bank accounts have children they\nperform religious rituals and stuff like\nthat it's like their job to be a priest\nthey're like a professional priest\nand then the swami is someone who's\ntaken sannyas which means they've given\nup their life so they're not going to\ncelibate they don't own things they're\nlike fully devoted to spirituality\nso they're like the hardcore priests by\nprofessional i mean like it's their day\njob\nlike the brahman's day job is to get\npeople married go home watch tv\neven have a beer if they want to\ni don't know that alcohol is forbidden\nor not for brahmins i don't know but the\nswami won't drink alcohol they won't do\nany of that stuff so they're like the\nhardcore like religious sort of like\nyou know some of them are enlightened or\nwhatever\nso i was learning from a swami right so\nswami told me a story so swami is from\nsouth india and swami was traveling in\ngujarat which is where i'm from so\ngujarat is western india\nand in gujarat\nthey have a particular\nvegetable called a bitter melon so\nbitter melon is used in certain kinds of\nindian and like chinese cuisine that i\nknow of maybe other countries as well\ni'm not sure\nand bitter melon is called bitter melon\nbecause it's bitter it like tastes like\nquite bitter it's not tasty\nin a weird way like it's like it tastes\nbad kind of weird so people will eat\nbetter melons it's like very healthy for\nyou though\nand sometimes we'll we'll like put\nenough masala like we'll put enough\nseasoning in it to make it taste good it\ncan be quite delicious i actually like\nbitter melon\nyou know when prepared properly\nso there's a certain kind of bitter\nmelon which is pickled\nso it's like sour and spicy and bitter\nand it's kind of disgusting if you\nreally don't like those flavors\nand so when you're a swami and you\ntravel like it's usually like volunteers\nand stuff he's like traveling in india\nso he's like staying at people's homes\nand stuff like that because hotels\naren't really like a thing in parts of\nindia\nand so he's got like you know his his\ndisciples and stuff who will drive him\naround and stuff like that and so he'll\ngo and he'll teach meditation in a\nlecture in this village and then he'll\ngo to that village or that city and give\nanother lecture he'll teach people\nmeditation he'll be initiating people\nand stuff like that\nso he's got these people that drive him\naround so he's staying at someone's\nhouse\nand they serve him dinner\nand so he's got you know the chapati\nwhich is like the flat bread it's kind\nof like a wheat tortilla and he's got\ndifferent kinds of vegetables and then\ndal which is like a lentil soup and then\nin the corner he's got a little bit of\nlike this pickle that he's never had\nbefore so he tries it and he's like this\nis bitter\nso i guess where he was from bitter\nmelon was not used i don't know if it's\nused in another south south indian\ncuisine or not but\nshe's like he never had it before he's\nlike this is disgusting like tastes\nawful it's like bitter and sour and i\ndon't even\nand so being a swami is like okay like\nyou know\ni can't say it's disgusting\nso he's also like i don't want to like\neat this throughout the meal so the\nfirst thing that he does\nis finishes the bitter melon because i'm\ngoing to finish the worst thing on my\nplate first so i can enjoy the rest of\nmy food\nso what do you think happens when you\nfinish the bitter melon first\nhuh so like oh here have some more\nand he's like\nno no no no really i'm fine and they're\nlike no no no have some more he's just\nbeing polite\nthere's more twice as much as the first\ntime\nhe's like\nhe's like well i ain't eating that\nlast so he that's\nmy language not his\ncurse words are my additions to the\nstory so he goes ahead and get goes\nahead and eats it again but he leaves\nlike a little bit towards the end so\nthey don't give him more right because\nhe's learning his lesson\nso he's like left a little bit finishes\nthe rest of his meal and then he kind of\nhas the bitter melon second to last and\nhas like one final bite of something\ntasty\nall right they're like oh no would you\nlike more he's like no no i'm fine so\nyeah i still have some i still have some\nokay\nhe was like all right\ndone\nso the next day he travels to a\ndifferent town and goes to stay with a\ndifferent family\nand sure enough it's a part of gujarati\ncuisine so what does he find there he\nfinds the bitter melon\nso he sits down\nadding stuff to his plate\nthere's the bitter melon pickle\nhe's like me dude again so he has\nit again\nfinishes it off sure enough same thing\nhappens again he's like oh crap i made\nthe same mistake these people are also\ninsisting so he learns gets a second\ndose saves one bite for the end\nokay\nthird day same thing happens again\nhe's like what the hell he's like so\nthen he asks his disciples and he's like\nyou know what's the deal like i know\nthat bitter melon is is like\nlike you know used here but it seems\nlike we're getting it every single day\nand his disciple is like yeah of course\nswamiji\ni saw how much you liked it the first\nday so i\nmade sure that you have it every day\nafter\nand i saw how much you enjoyed it so\nit's you know we we're making sure that\nyou're going to have bitter melon pickle\nevery single day\nright\nthis is what you've got to understand if\nyou stop living authentically\nyou're\nsowing a karma\nand that karma will reap its fruit\nokay\ncan't avoid it so when you live\nauthentically\nand you tell people how you feel in this\nmoment recognize that every time you're\ninauthentic you are sowing a seed for\nthe future whether you're an alcoholic\nwho's stealing money and you want to try\nto get by right like you're thinking\nlike\ni'm going to dodge it\ni'm going to outsmart karma\nright i'm going to be like i'm a swami\nand i'm gonna be polite\nand i'm not gonna offend anyone and when\ni go to someone's house i'm not gonna\nsay i i don't like something because\nthat's rude\nand this is the price you pay for your\nkindness\nkarma is inescapable\nright so when we live authentically\npeople are asking how do i live\nauthentically\nso forget about going back and making\namends for now you should do that one\nday absolutely and if you're ready for\nit go for it\nbut in this moment\nthere are going to be times in your life\nwhere for a fraction of a second your\nmind will say\ndon't be honest\nyour mind will say tell like you know\nyour mind will say like don't be honest\nyour mind will think about how the other\nperson will react and it will adjust\nyour behavior in that moment to create a\nparticular reaction for the other person\ndon't give in to your impulse\nto\nshape someone else's behavior that's how\nyou live authentically\nlike it's a moment of time where you\nknow if i say this this person will\nreact this way therefore i'm not going\nto say this i'm going to say this\ninstead and then i will create their\nreaction it is a manipulation and it is\ninauthentic and you are setting yourself\nup for a karmic problem the next time\naround\nand even swamis are not immune\nwhat if i want to be disrespectful\nso\nauthenticity\nso this is important to understand so in\nthe hindu tradition right so this is\nwhere like i'm not saying the hindu\ntradition is right i'm going to explain\nsomething from the hindu tradition a\nconclusion that some people in the hindu\ntradition came to and you all decide\nwhether this makes sense to you\nthere's satya which is truthfulness and\nthere is ahimsa which is non-violence\nokay\nand\nsatya truthfulness should always be\nsubject to non-violence i don't know\nabout always but generally speaking\nshould be subject to it\nso you should not be truthful at the\nsake of being violent\nso if you're ever concerned about which\none should i do you should try to be\nnon-violent first\nso you can share something\nso it like hurt and violence are two\ndifferent things right so being\ndisrespectful\nis about your intention\nso you can say this is disgusting\nwho would be so idiotic is to like serve\nme this\nthat is being violent that is being\ndisrespectful\nso it's not about the other person's\nfeelings it's about your intentions so i\ndon't ever advocate for being\ndisrespectful\nso being authentic doesn't have to be\ndisrespectful and that's where like some\npeople use it as an as an excuse to be\ndisrespectful\nso you can say like oh would you like it\nand and if someone asks offers you more\nand you're like no no really like i\nactually didn't like it very much so i\nwanted to finish it first\nthis other stuff is so\ndelicious you can say that\nright\nand\nit's okay\nyou can just be honest\nit doesn't you know they don't have to\ngo like\neverything else is so delicious this is\nthe one weird thing i've never had it\nbefore we don't eat this down south\nit's not exactly to my taste\nthat's not disrespectful\nso don't be disrespectful\nbut be authentic\nand in that moment when you try to spare\nsomeone's feelings i'm not saying set\nout to hurt them\nthat's what himsah is\nwe want to do ahimsa the lack of\nviolence\nright\nyeah what if someone is sensitive and\nyou lie not to hurt them\nso that's where like you can speak the\ntruth and you should do it with\ncompassion but you can't necessarily\ncontrol someone else's reaction\nthis is another huge problem that we run\ninto with being inauthentic\nis we make ourselves responsible for\nother people's reactions\nthis is how abusive relationships\npersist\nbecause i learn\nthat by being meek\ni can keep someone from hitting me\nwhich may have a certain survival\nadvantage but over time it's not a good\nlong-term strategy\nright so when it comes to being\nauthentic like recognize that it may\ncause some amount of pain so you should\ndo everything that you can\nto try to minimize that pain but you\ndon't necessarily need to lie\nso if your mom is giving you vitamin d\nand it's not working\nright so like there's language around\nthat too it's like learning how to be\ncompassionate is the vitamin d helping\nnot yet mom\nbut i know that you do your homework i\nknow that you care about me and you told\nme to take it so i'm gonna take it every\nday if i have to until it works\nthank you so much\nright\nlike\ni don't\ni mean there are things you can say to\nmitigate it even if it's not helping\njust develop your soft skills law that's\nnot complicated like so i i'm hoping i\ncan't detect sarcasm over the internet\nbut i'm not saying it's easy\nbut the whole point is that like\nwe don't even try\nright so what happens when you start\nliving a life of inauthenticity is you\ndodge the bullet entirely\nlike that's why it's hard because we\ndon't even try\nright so that's why you start with the\nsmallest thing\nof authenticity and you try to ask\nyourself how can i say what i'm about to\nsay and be authentic and be\ncompassionate\nso as you develop empathy you can\nunderstand like just acknowledge where\nsomeone's coming from\nright so if someone like gets you\nstrawberries\nthat have nuts sprinkled on them and\nyou're allergic to nuts\nit's valentine's day and you've gone on\ndates for you've gone on three dates and\nnow it's that awkward period\nin your relationship where there's a\nvalentine's day that's come way too\nearly\ngigi\ndo you celebrate it or do you not\ncelebrate it\nand there's nuts on the strawberries\nand you're allergic someone's like did\nyou enjoy the strawberries\nhow do you tell them that you're\nallergic\nby sparing their feelings\nright what do y'all think\nyou can say i know it's gonna sound\ninsane but i'm actually allergic\nit's such a thoughtful gift and never in\nmy life\nhave i\nregretted being allergic because those\nstrawberries looked amazing\nand it's clear that you put a lot of\nthought into them and it's like\ni've never wanted to\nbe able to eat these nuts\nmore than now\nright like you can still say something\nyou can honor their gesture\nright\nokay\nall right\ndoes that make sense\nyeah it's beautifully put so clockwork\nchaos is saying appreciate what they did\nfor you not what you got out of it\nright that's a beautiful way to put it\nbeautiful way to put it\nright so appreciate the gesture even if\nit didn't help you\nyou can acknowledge and like honor that\nfor sure\nyou"
