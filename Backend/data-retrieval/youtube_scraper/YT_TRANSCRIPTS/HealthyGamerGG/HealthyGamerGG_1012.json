    "transcript": "75 of people who get diagnosed with\nnarcissistic personality disorder are\nmen\nokay so like for every three men that\ngets diagnosed you get one woman who\ngets diagnosed with npd the interesting\nthing though is that karen's tend to be\na little bit more on the narcissistic\nside right so they'll be very very\nprideful very angry very blaming of\nother people so karens tend to be\nentitled and what does that mean so that\nmeans that when they\nwhen they show up somewhere they expect\nsomething to happen and they believe\nthat they deserve something right so if\ni show up at a tire store and i'm like i\nwant a pizza like\ni deserve a pizza and like that's not\nit's not my mistake that i showed up at\na tire store it's your mistake for\nnot providing with me with pizza they\nalso tend to be shown as having a\nparticular kind of haircut we'll even\ndig into why that is okay\n[Music]\nso i don't know if you guys know this\nbut recently especially during the\npandemic\nkaren's have been on the rise right so\nthat we see more and more videos\nabout\nkaren's and so generally speaking what a\nkaren is is someone who gets really\nupset at something and mistreats someone\noftentimes the karen is female which\nwe'll kind of get to in a second uh\noftentimes the karen is white and even\nsome people have defined karen as being\nspecifically a caucasian or white person\nso you can't have cairns of other race\nwe'll kind of dig into that a little bit\nand then what happens is like these\npeople are mistreating people they're\nyelling they're screaming they're being\ngenerally mean\nanother uh you know really common sort\nof thing is like um\nthey want to speak to the manager\nthey're unwilling to like really\nunderstand that things are not the fault\nof the person that they're talking to\nright so like a classic karen thing is\nlike i'm gonna go to a pizza shop and\norder or i'm gonna go to a tire shop and\norder a pizza\nand then like the tire shop is like we\ndon't sell pizza we're a tire shop and\nthen the karen gets really really really\nangry at the person who's like behind\nthe desk\num\nand so there's even like i i think\nthere's some\nyou know\neven some really interesting uh\nyou know memes about this\nright so like one is\nand so karen's are are kind of like what\nthey tend to do is when they when they\nget denied something that they want\nwhat they tend to do is try to appeal to\nhigher authority or think that their way\nis the right way and that other people\nare objectively wrong and we've even\nseen like some really good memes about\nkaren's right so another important thing\nto consider\nis that\nthe\nthe karen\nis actually like an internet phenomenon\nright\nand so like this is the elon musk karen\num they also tend to be shown as having\na particular kind of haircut we'll even\ndig into why that is okay so i think\nthere's truth to all these things\nso this is where let's kind of just\nstart by kind of understanding like a\nlittle bit about you know what's going\non with karen's\nso the first thing is like let's talk\nabout features of a karen so karen's\ntend to be self-absorbed right so they\nlike they don't they're not very\nempathic\nthey tend to mistreat people who are\nlike in the service industry or they\nview as like socially below them\nwhen they get denied something that may\nnot be out of any malicious intent they\ntend to get like angry and explode at\npeople\nthey also will oftentimes appeal to\nhigher authority\num and so they'll do things like call\nthe police they'll also like yell\nparticular words that are grossly\ninappropriate to the situation\nright so if like you know i i saw some\nvideo where uh there was a a black\nperson who had asked a white woman to\nput their\ndog on a leash because it was\nyou know like that's the rules for the\npark that they were in and then the\nwoman started yelling rape and like\nthe dude was super confused\nand so they tend to like engage in very\nvery unhealthy or\nexplosive or abusive behaviors\ngenerally speaking they don't seem to be\nvery happy so kind of what's going on\nwith the karen i also see the word\nnarcissism tossed around a lot so we're\ngoing to talk for a second about\nnarcissism so we're going to talk a\nlittle bit about you know what are the\ncharacteristics of karen's what do we\nknow about certain personality\ncharacteristics that people may have and\nin certain\npersonality aspects that may apply to\nkaren's we're going to talk a little bit\nabout how karen's form and how our\nimpressions of karen's form we're also\ngoing to touch on some of these more\nsocial implications\nlike issues of race or gender that's\ndefinitely not my area of expertise so\ni'm gonna just kind of like\nreally call attention to the fact that\nthis exists but it's not really\nsomething that we're gonna sort of dive\ninto\nand then um\nyeah we're going to talk a little bit\nabout\nand and so then we'll kind of summarize\nlike you know why are karen's a thing\nand even to a certain extent why is is\ntheir hair a particular way\nso let's start by understanding\nnarcissism so a lot of people when they\nsee a karen they will say like oh this\nperson is so self-absorbed they're\nnarcissistic\nso we have to understand a couple of\nthings about personality characteristics\nand personality disorders specifically\nso if you look at\nstatistics 75 percent of people who get\ndiagnosed with narcissistic personality\ndisorder are men\nokay so like for every three men that\ngets diagnosed you get one woman who\ngets diagnosed with npd\nand there are other personality\ndisorders like borderline personality\ndisorder that i think basically has the\nflip ratio so the majority of people who\nare diagnosed with borderline\npersonality disorder are actually women\nand so some people may wonder is this\nlike a gender bias is this a bias in the\nway that we diagnose things like what's\ngoing on here\nso i want y'all to we're going to sort\nof take a step back and look at the\nhistory of psychiatric diagnosis\nand prior to our current system of\ndiagnosis we used to have something\ncalled the personality disorders used to\nbe clustered so there used to be person\na cluster a personality disorders\ncluster b personality disorders and\ncluster c personality disorders\nand back in this classification\ncluster b included narcissism histrionic\nwhich is like when you have grand\ngrandiose kind of shows of things\nand borderline personality disorder as\nwell as antisocial personality disorder\nand so essentially what we kind of saw\nwas that there was a gender split in the\npers the cluster b personality disorders\nthat narcissists and sociopaths tended\nto be more\nmen right so like the majority of people\nwho get diagnosed with these things are\nmen and the majority of people who get\ndiagnosed with borderline personality\ndisorder or histrionic personality\ndisorder were women\nbut as is like psychoanalysts and\npsychologists and like psychiatrists\nwere looking at this kind of stuff what\nthey sort of realized is that there's a\ncommon root which is why these got\nclustered together\nand possibly due to the way that we get\nsocialized and some other aspects of\ngender specific things that you can have\na common root of like a lack of\nself-worth or an importance\nof other people treating you a\nparticular way that's kind of the core\nof all of these personality disorders\nthat depending on your upbringing in\nsociety and even maybe to some degree\nlike the effects of the y chromosome and\nstuff like that\nthat this will this common root will\nmanifest in one of two dimensions or\ndirections and if you're a man that\nbasically manifests as narcissism or\nanti-social personality disorder if\nyou're a woman it's more likely to\nmanifest as histrionic personality\ndisorder or borderline personality\ndisorder\nso the common route just to kind of\nexplain this is sort of this idea that\nlike\nmy self-worth\nis determined by how i am treated so the\nway that i feel about myself\ndepends on how other people treat me\nso if i'm treated well i feel good\nif i'm treated poorly i feel bad\nand then each of these people this is a\nlittle bit less true for antisocial\npersonalities or i think that's in a lot\nof ways the odd one out but\nand then what a lot of people will do is\nengage in behaviors to correct this\nso for example when you have a\nhistrionic person this is someone who\nwill like you know cry wildly will like\nyou know engage in just very drastic\novert shows of behavior\nusually for the purpose of getting some\nkind of emotional support or like\nyeah like some kind of like love\nessentially so we'll also see this in\npeople who have borderline personality\ndisorder where like if you try to break\nup with someone who has borderline\npersonality disorder or if you set some\nkind of limit on them so you say hey i'm\nsorry i can't talk right now i'm busy\nthey will feel really really bad they'll\nfeel very very rejected and as they feel\nrejected they will engage in all manner\nof different kinds of behaviors to fix\nthat\nso if they want to talk to you they want\nto talk to you and they'll do whatever\nit takes to talk to you and so over time\nlike they need you to talk to them right\nso that they really really want to\nengage in this conversation\nand if you set some kind of limit\nthey'll do all kinds of behaviors on the\none hand they'll cry they'll sort of\nlike sometimes they'll do things like\nthreat and suicide right so i don't want\nyou to leave me\nso if you try to leave i'll threaten\nsuicide maybe they may actually feel\nlike killing themselves in that moment\nbut the key thing is that when they\nthreaten suicide that changes the\nbehavior of the other party and then if\nyou say oh no no don't do that okay fine\ni'll stay\nand so they'll sort of\nbe very kind of emotionally manipulative\nthat way\nso people on the other end of the\nspectrum feel very\nemotionally manipulated right if you're\nin a relationship with this person but i\ndon't think it's quite as\nmalicious as people experience it as\nthese are just ways of getting our needs\nmet\nand so on the narcissistic side for\nexample we'll also see similar things\nbut it's like you know they'll get angry\nif someone threatens their credibility\nthey'll get angry if someone threatens\ntheir competence they'll lash out\noftentimes they won't cry they'll do the\nkind of the opposite they'll bully\npeople right so one is kind of like this\nemotionally manipulative kind of like\nbeing a vulnerable bully versus like an\novert bully\nand so as people sort of were looking at\nnarcissism they also realize the same\nthing is going on like i need people to\ntreat me with respect and i'm gonna do\nwhatever i need to to get the the praise\nand affection of other people so people\nwho are narcissistic will brag right\nthey'll show off they'll show people how\nmuch money they have\nthey'll you know make these really like\nout of touch statements i recently saw a\nvideo about a guy who was like talking\nabout how like you know the roi on\ncooking is really really bad so no one\nshould ever cook\nif you want to make it big in life\nright so they'll like they'll have these\nlike very interesting conclusions i mean\nthere may be some validity to that\nstatement on some level but generally\nspeaking like narcissists will be big on\nshow\nand if we show\nlike if i show that i'm awesome and\npeople like oh my god you're so awesome\nthat'll kind of feed my narcissism and\nthen i feel good about myself because\neveryone is treating me well so it's\nonce again a behavioral reinforcement\nbecause like if i show off and people\nrespond to me positively then that's\ngoing to reinforce my desire to show off\nmore okay\nso the key thing here is that the the\nkaren\nis not really on the borderline or\nsometimes they can be on the histrionic\nside right so like yelling randomly like\nwhen when someone is you know telling\nyou to put your your\ndog on a leash is a good example\nof like\nyou know like\nhistrionics\nthe interesting thing though is that\nkaren's tend to be a little bit more on\nthe narcissistic side right so they'll\nbe very very prideful very angry very\nblaming of other people\nand that's that's generally speaking is\nmore common in men than women which\nprobably has something to do with the\nway that the diagnosis was developed so\nthe early interviews and the early\ndiagnostic criteria of narcissistic\npersonality disorder was heavily\ninfluenced by men so like people were i\ndon't mean that in a bad way i mean that\nwhen people were looking at narcissism\nand trying to define the characteristics\nthey were interviewing primarily men and\nso as they interviewed primarily men\nthey didn't really appreciate that\nthere's a gender component to this\nand so they selected for these things\nlike grandiosity which is a big part of\nthe diagnosis of narcissistic\npersonality disorder which is like\nless common in women\nin female narcissists but more common in\nmale narcissists like grandiosity is a\nbig part of it\nso part of this diagnosis is kind of\nlike it's sort of like shaped in the way\nit has sort of an inherent gender built\ninto it and karen's are kind of like\nnarcissistic okay\nso the other aspects of karen's that are\nkind of interesting is that they tend to\nhave a sense of entitlement now this is\nwhere a lot of people start to bring in\nrace socioeconomic status and things\nlike that and for good reason\nso karen's tend to be entitled and what\ndoes that mean so that means that when\nthey\nwhen they show up somewhere they expect\nsomething to happen and they believe\nthat they deserve something right so if\ni show up at a tire store and i'm like i\nwant a pizza like\ni deserve a pizza and like that's not\nit's not my mistake that i showed up at\na tire store it's your mistake for\nnot providing with me with pizza and\npart of what we see here is sort of like\nthis narcissistic defense mechanism\nwhere like the stupider you make a care\nand feel\nthe more you kind of threaten them\nthe more of an explosion you're gonna\nget from the karen so if a karen goes to\na tire store and they ask for pizza that\nis objectively idiotic\nthe more of the objectively idiotic\nsituation you put a karen into the more\nidiotic they are the more of a caring\nresponse you're gonna get right so this\nis why like if you tell someone hey your\ndog needs to be on a leash\nand like clearly that karen is in the\nwrong and this is what we see in in\nkaren\nvideos right is like the karen is\nclearly in the wrong that's why it's\nreally really easy to hate karen's\nbecause they're clearly in the wrong\nit's really easy to make fun of them\nbecause they're clearly in the wrong\nbecause of the way that the the kind of\npsychology of narcissistic defense\nmechanisms work the more idiotic we make\nyou feel\nthe more karen behavior is going to come\nout right because an apology is like out\nof the question\ni'm like in it so it's kind of bizarre\nso this is what creates such an extreme\nscenario\nso the size of the explosion is going to\nbe correlated with the size of the\nidiocy\nand furthermore on the internet we have\nsomething that selects for extremes\nright we don't select for like mild\nthings\nso what tends to happen on social media\nis what floats to the surface are the\nmost extreme examples which in turn\ngives this idea that karen's are like\nabsolutely insane right because we're\nsort of catching them at their lowest\nmoments sure they're they're you know\nthey're responsible for sure\nbut karen's i don't think are like some\nof it is like personality but some of it\nis like catching them on a bad day right\nso anyone we can kind of catch on a bad\nday and they're gonna behave more\nextremely the problem is that with the\ninternet what we tend to propagate is\nthe most extremes so if you look at like\nyou know an internet video of a\nparticular person\nchances are\nwhat you're gonna find for any given\nrandom person if you have a little bit\nof internet fame chances are what you\nhave internet fame for is one of the\nmost extreme moments in your life right\nso if it's like\nwoman survives shark attack\nand it's like a video of a woman like\neveryone sees that video and it's like\nthat woman's life is not shark attack\nafter shark attack after shark attack\nbut the way that the internet works we\ntend to propagate\nthe most extreme situations\nso karen's are sort of placed in this\nsituation where they're like they feel\nlike idiots probably because they make\nsome kind of mistake\nand someone's setting some kind of limit\non them you hopefully i like to think\ncompassionately for a second and think\nyou catch them on a bad day they have\nsome kind of explosion so let's talk a\nlittle bit about the explosion and\nwhat's going on there\nso we're going to talk a little bit\nabout um\nentitlement okay\nso the other thing that karen's tend to\nhave to do is is they tend to have a lot\nof privilege right so they like feel\nentitled\nso this study was looking at the\npsychology of what's called entrenched\nprivilege which is high socioeconomic\nstatus individuals from\naffluent backgrounds are uniquely high\nin entitlement so this is also where\nthere's this kind of this idea that a\nkaren is like a rich white woman which i\ndon't think is necessarily true because\ni've seen a lot of care and behavior you\nknow like from people who are from lower\nsocioeconomic statuses\nand so the interesting thing that this\nthis paper sort of found is that the\namount of entitlement that you have\nis not necessarily based on your\nsocioeconomic status which is\ninteresting it's based on the\nsocioeconomic status that you grew up in\nso what we tend to find is that people\nwho are\nborn into low socioeconomic status and\nbecome wealthy are not entitled\npeople who are\nborn into low socioeconomic status and\nstay in low socioeconomic status are not\nentitled\nbut when you come from high\nsocioeconomic status that's what makes\nyou entitled so when you grow up with\nprivilege\nthat's what gives you this idea and it\nsort of makes sense right so like i mean\nlike you know if you grew up grow up in\na situation where your parents are able\nto provide for you christmas presents\nwithout worrying about financial things\nyou will come to expect and even be\nentitled to christmas gifts\nright the same is true of birthdays if\nyou come from a background\nwhere like birthday gifts like you get a\nton of gifts on your birthday you will\ncome to be entitled to and expect\nbirthday gifts\nso what we tend to find is that\ngenerally speaking entitlement has to do\nwith your background\nwhich also we can sort of see kind of a\nracial component here which is that\ngenerally speaking if we look at you\nknow all of the ethnicities\num caucasians i don't know if this\nstatement is factually true i think it\nis but feel free to correct me so\ngenerally speaking i think it you know\nthe highest percentage of people at\nleast in the west that come from high\nsocioeconomic backgrounds are going to\nbe caucasian\nright so we can sort of start to see a\nlittle bit of a racial component here\nthe other interesting thing\nthat's that's very fascinating is if we\nlook at people who have high levels of\nentitlement\nthey are much more likely to respond to\nbad luck with anger okay so this really\nexplains a lot about a karen so we have\na\nkaren who probably grew up expecting a\nlot right maybe was a someone\nand this is where the narcissism also\ncomes in which is like\nwhen i come from a prominent family and\ni used to be rich and i used to be a big\ndeal or i grew up in a southern town\nwhere my mom was this and my dad was\nthis and my dad was like president of\nthe rotary club and then i kind of don't\namount to much and i wind up in walmart\nnothing against people who shop at\nwalmart i shop at walmart too on\noccasion um you know like this kind of\nfaded glory enhances this narcissism and\nit gives these people a sense of\nentitlement and then what tends to\nhappen is like sometimes it's not even\nyour fault that you went to the tire\nstore right because the tire store is\ncalled pizza pie\nright pizza pie tires\nand it's like or something like that i\ndon't know\nand so then what happens is these cairns\nsometimes will genuinely face like bad\nluck it's not their fault like if i go\nto a store\nand something is out of stock right it's\nnot like my fault that they're out of\nstock it's not the service person's\nlike fault mario tires perfect\nit's not uh it's not the service per\nlike it's not like the\nyou know the per the checkout person's\nfault\nthat something is out of stock\nbut my sense of entitlement when things\nwhen there are events that are not\nreally against me in any way and i\nexperience bad luck i tend to have some\nkind of explosion\nand so this is another thing that sort\nof contributes to the cairns is that\ngenerally speaking something is wrong\nthat starts the karen off right it's not\nlike that karen just walks in and maybe\ni could be wrong here but generally\nspeaking there's something that like\ngets this going either the karen makes a\nmistake the karen gets criticized in\nsome way that karen feels afraid or\nsomething like that they feel threatened\nor there's like some kind of bad luck\nwhat do you mean you're out of like my\nfavorite coffee beverage\nhow dare you and they'll sort of take it\nas a personal insult there's something\nnegative that happens and then they tend\nto lash out at the person who's nearest\nto them\nthis is another area where i think the\nentitlement and sort of the hatred\ntowards cairns really comes from is what\nwe usually see is that karen's are\npeople who believe in like kind of a\nclear hierarchy and so what they sort of\nprobably this has to do with\ndevelopmental upbringing and stuff like\nthat they think that some people are\nabove them and some people are below\nthem\nand so what we tend to see a lot of\nkaren's doing is abusing people in the\nservice industry right so there's like a\nwaiter or a clerk or something like that\nwho's really has no control\nover what the karen wants\nbut the karen just feels completely\nentitled to kind of like lash out out of\nthem\nand this is and this is where the let me\nspeak to your manager kind of things\ncomes from so if we kind of tunnel down\na little bit more we can hypothesize a\ncouple of other things\nso let's talk about let me speak to your\nmanager\nso human beings tend to attribute\nthe behavior to other people that other\npeople engage in to their own psychology\nso if someone does something this is\nnormal so if someone does something the\nintention behind that behavior\nis not based on my observation of that\nperson but is based on my own beliefs\nso if someone waves to me the meaning of\nthat is going to be based on why would i\nwave to someone okay\nso we see a lot of this these kind of\nproblems in like relationships and stuff\nwhen for example different things mean\nthings mean different things to\ndifferent people so for example\ni've had relationships where people will\nget upset with me because i don't like\ncall or text them on a regular basis\nand for some people calling or texting\non a regular basis is a sign of caring\nabout another person so there's a\nbehavior and what that behavior means\nthe intention behind that behavior the\nmeaning of that behavior is different to\ndifferent people whereas like i'm okay\nlike if you don't text me for a month or\neven three months or a year\ni've had friends that i haven't seen in\nlike two years i haven't even talked to\nthem in two years and we'll see each\nother after two years and it's like we\npick up exactly where we left off the\ntime doesn't really mean much to me in\nterms of like the maintenance or\nimportance of a relationship\nthe point is that different behaviors\nwill mean different things to different\npeople\nand oftentimes what we'll see in in\nkaren's\nis that karen's will be like\nbig into petty power plays and\ngatekeeping people and like other kinds\nof like petty kind of toxic behavior\nwhich means that when they feel gait\nkept by someone they're attributing\ntheir own intentions\nto that person right so like if i'm a\nkaren\nand i tend to be petty\nlike\nif it's like someone asks me for help\nbut like doesn't do it\nin you know a nice enough way and i feel\noffended like i'm not gonna help them\nyou know i'm gonna be like a petty\noverlord over my domain and i'm gonna\ngatekeep whenever i can\nand so then what happens is when when\nsomeone else sets a limit on them they\nare attributing\nall of their own internal beha like\nintentions to that person's behavior and\nthat oftentimes mess\nreally upsets them\nthe other thing is that karen's also\noftentimes i mean we've never\ninterviewed a karen right so we don't\nreally know here but this is all kind of\nhypothesis based on some scientific\nstudies and observations of behavior\nso the other thing is that parents tend\nto think that they're objectively right\nright so like if they're entitled\nthey're like this is the way of the\nworld like i deserve a pizza whether\nit's a tire shop or whatever for some\nreason they've grown up in a particular\nway\nwhere the world needs to conform to my\nwants this is a key concept that they've\nkind of grown up with and chances are\nthey grew up in a household where like\nthis was happening right so there was a\ndomineering figure in the household and\nwhen they were a kid\nwhat they wanted didn't matter and\nthere's a powerful person in the\nhousehold there's a powerful person in\nthe hierarchy and what they want their\nword is law and so as the karen assumes\nthat role as they grow into the parent\nthey start\nbehaving the same way because that's the\nrules of the world that they were taught\nand so they sometimes feel like this\npetty person is gate-keeping me i'm not\ni'm better than this person i don't need\nto listen to this person this person\nmust be incompetent because they're not\nproviding me with what i want i feel\nentitled i get angry so let me talk to\nyour manager because surely someone with\nmore power\nand more competence than you is more\nlikely to agree with me\nright that's the the idea behind the\nkaren is because like i'm objectively\nright so the more powerful you get and\nthe smarter you get the more likely they\nare to fix this problem on my behalf\nnow the other challenging thing here is\nthat sometimes\nthat behavior gets reinforced\nright so like this is the kind of thing\nwhere like\ntalking to a manager can be sort of\nassuaging for your ego to begin with\nand the manager comes out and apologizes\nor maybe fixes the problem or does some\nkind of override that the lower person\ncouldn't do\nbut sometimes this behavior gets\nreinforced right by talking to the\nmanager and making enough of a hissy fit\ni actually get what i want so throwing\ntemper tantrums why do people throw\ntemper tantrums because they get us what\nwe want\nright this kind of goes back to what we\nwere saying at the beginning about\nnarcissism and borderline and histrionic\nthat\nif a behavior gets rewarded even if it's\na nasty behavior that behavior is going\nto get reinforced\nso why do they ask for managers because\nsometimes asking for managers works\nright so we've conditioned karen's\nso that's sort of the psychology of a\nkaren now we're going to look at a\ncouple of other dimensions\nso one is that there seems to be\na racial component to karen so some\npeople even define karen's as first of\nall women and second of all white\num\nand\nso\nwe're gonna kind of take a quick look at\nthis paper\num\nand so the angry karen is invoked to\nindicate her manipulation of her racial\npower but she is equally significant we\nsuggest for her positioning within a\npre-existing antagonistic service\neconomy so this is this is a paper\nthat's sort of talking a little bit\nabout racial components to cairnism\nwhich i think is like very possible or\nor a component of it so as the the term\nhas grown\ni think it started to encompass men and\npeople of different ethnicities it's not\nmy place to say you know that this is\nright or wrong\ni think if we look back at sort of\ntracing the the ideology or the origin\nof the word karen i think it actually\nstarted on twitter in predominantly\nblack communities talking about white\npeople and their experience of working\nwith entitled white women\num so you know i'm not saying that\nkaren's gonna be exclusively white it's\nnot my place for to make that judgment i\nthink that there's sort of like there\nare definitely racial components to this\nbut it's unclear to me i don't think\nthere's real you know science that's\nbeen done on this people have made\nobservations and terms tend to evolve\nand stuff like that and clearly like you\nknow elon musk being a karen sort of\nsuggests that i mean he's white but he's\nnot a woman\num and so i've seen also on social media\nvideos of non-white women being karen's\nas well but like there's definitely\nseems to be sort of a shared experience\nor common experience that\nkaren's are oftentimes white and that\nmay in turn have to do with things like\nsocioeconomic status or\nuh entitlement which may be more\ncorrelated with caucasian gender i mean\ncaucasian ethnicity as opposed to other\nethnicities so it sort of makes sense to\nme but i don't think it's necessarily\nwhite i think it's these other\nconstituent components that are\ncorrelated with race\nthe next thing um\nis that there are even\ntones now of like different kinds of\nonce again racial uh this isn't this\ndoesn't sort of\ntalk about it but they're like racial\ncomponents but they're also starting to\nbe gender components of karen's\nso sometimes like misogynistic people\nwill\nuse or people with misogynistic\nattitudes will like use the term of\nkaren right so like it's it's it's also\nbecome a vehicle that has been co-opted\nfor misogyny the interesting thing is\nthat there are terms that have been\nco-opted for miss andrew as well right\nso like i think in-cell and simp are two\nwords that for example like have been\nco-opted right so these are things that\nnow if people have misandric views\nthey'll they'll sort of use these kinds\nof terms\nas like a way to blame the person for\nbeing this thing which is actually like\na mask for my anti-gender\nlanguage\nokay\num\nso\nyeah so we're just gonna kind of touch\non that there are definitely like racial\nand gender components to karen not my\narea of expertise\num so next thing that we're going to\ntalk a little bit about is why are\nkaren's on the rise and what's going on\nso next thing to talk a little bit about\nis\nonline presence so i think part of the\nreason\nthat we've seen so many more cairns\nrecently\nis that\num\na couple of things so the first is that\nwe've seen a rise of karen's during the\npandemic okay\nand so i think this has a lot of really\nreally interesting\nconnotations to it\nthe first is that the pandemic was an\ninordinate amount of stress on people as\na whole so when you stress the whole\npopulation\nright\nthe people who have these karen\ntendencies\nare going to respond to the stress in a\nparticularly negative way okay so the\nfirst thing is that the world was worse\nfor everyone and everyone is getting\nworse so we saw you know increases like\nup to even by some statistics you know\n300 increases and things like depression\nand anxiety so we're gonna see like\ndifferent people respond to stress in\ndifferent ways so some people get\ndepressed some people get anxious we\nalso saw you know an increase in\nsuicidal ideation unclear whether there\nwas really an increase in total net\nsuicides i haven't seen the data on that\nbut we're also seeing an increase in\nlike karen-like behavior right being\nangry entitled the other thing that\nwould to remember is that the pandemic\nalso had other influences besides stress\non karen explosions because remember\nthat the pandemic resulted in more\npeople having bad luck right so the\nlikelihood that stores were closed the\nlikelihood that they didn't have your\nproduct in stock people are out sick so\nthings are taking longer at restaurants\nright people are understaffed they can't\nwork you know all kinds of changes\nhappen that made the world objectively\nlike a harder place to live in\nand if we remember about\npeople who with entitlement who\nexperience bad luck respond with anger\nthe pandemic is going to increase that\nthat kind of relationship okay so the\npandemic is sort of like it's stressful\nmentally but also objectively and\nphysically and in the world karen's have\nmore things to be upset about right so\nwhen these two things come together\nthey're going to increase karen-like\nbehavior which is part of the reason why\ni think we saw such an explosion of\nkaren's stuff on social media which\nbrings me to the last point that we're\ngoing to talk about about karen's which\nis online drift\nso\nthe other thing that's kind of going on\non the internet so there's even some\nstudies that sort of show that\nparticipation in particular kinds of\nsocial media activities\nare more likely to engage in like\nentitlement behavior so like mask\nmandates and and sheeple and things like\nthat is a good example of this\nwhere if people are talking about\num you know\nlike for example there were particular\ngroups social media groups that\ncause people to become radicalized and\noftentimes karen's are a part of those\ngroups right so now for example like\nwhen a karen walks into\na restaurant\nthat has a mask mandate\nas a result of the radicalization of\nonline drift that karen is much more\nlikely to explode so what does that mean\nthe radicalization of online drift\nso generally speaking there is a surface\nof the internet and the surface of the\ninternet is generally speaking like\npretty acceptable\nand then what we see on the internet and\nthere have been really good studies done\nabout this\nthat what happens over time is like i\nstart out up here but over time i'll\nlike drift\ndeeper into the internet and into more\nradical extremes okay\nso like a good example of this is like\nyou know you can start out on google or\nwikipedia which is like relatively\nneutral\nbut as you move from platforms or even\nthings like twitter\nwhere as you move from platforms like\ntwitter to\nreddit to discord to specific discords\nto\nyou know like 4chan 8chan\nlike you know 8chan is just twice as\nmuch as 4chan right so like\nwhat happens is like we'll we'll move to\nmore radical platforms that are more\nlike echo chambers and will actually\nlike\nradicalize our thinking so\nthis is something that it doesn't also\nhave to be in that sort of way so the\nother way the interesting thing we\nshould maybe do an experiment on this\nor if you go on youtube you'll also go\ndown like radicalization algorithms\nright so if you watch a single video\non a particular topic\nyoutube will start pushing you in that\ndirection so if you watch a single topic\nabout let's say like an inflammatory\nvideo about feminism\nor misandry like you'll start going down\na particular way if you watch something\nthat is misogynistic you'll start\ngetting fed like other misogynistic\nvideos\nif you start watching like so i would\nsometimes watch cooking videos\nand so like now like half of my youtube\nsuggestions are like people grilling\nthings okay\nand like it starts out with like a very\nsimple grilling thing but then like over\ntime we're getting into like hardcore\ngrilling in my youtube algorithm my\nyoutube algorithm is super confused\nthough because my wife watches stuff on\nit my kids watch stuff on it so the\nyoutube doesn't know what to serve us it\ndoesn't know if we want a video about\ngrilling steak like nursery rhymes or\nlike dota vods or makeup tutorials like\nour my youtube algorithm is so confused\nright\nbut what happens with karen's is that\nthey tend to engage in social\ncommunities online social communities\nwhere there's a heavy amount of drift\nand radicalization which then like\nchanges the way they view the world and\nthen when they go interact in public\nright so if i am participating in like\nracially\nuh discriminatory groups so like where\nhate speech anti-black people and i'm\nwalking in the park without a dog with\nmy dog off the leash and a black man\nwalks up to me and asks me to put the\ndog on the leash all of that\nradicalization is going to come to a\nhead combined with the narcissistic\ninjury of me breaking a rule and since\ni'm racist a black person telling me\nabout rules like how dare they right\nand so then i'm going to explode and\nthen it gets captured on social media\nthen it gets posted somewhere\neveryone sees it and then what do you\nthink happens to a karen who sees\nthemselves on social media because now\nwe're going to come full circle\nright\nso what happens\nthe narcissist\nnarcissistic injury gets way worse\nright they feel more hurt\nand the more hurt they feel the more of\nan idiot they seem they radicalize even\nfurther\nright they become even more\nnarcissistic and then they're like how\ndare they now it's like these young kids\non the internet\nright and now they're they're poo pooing\nmillennials and gen z because the\nmillennials made me look like an idiot\nand so it kind of like it just loops\nand so like this phenomenology of\nkaren's is really fascinating i don't\nknow how much of what i'm saying is\nactually like scientifically valid right\nso it's like this is the kind of thing\nwhere we have to extrapolate there\naren't studies i mean there are studies\nwe looked at a couple\nbut the truth is that it's a complex\nphenomenon that involves all kinds of\nthings it probably starts with some\namount of personality characteristics\nprobably starts with a particular kind\nof upbringing that leads to a sense of\nentitlement which may have something to\ndo with socioeconomic status may have\nsomething to do with the race\nand then as we start to add some of\nthese issues about stress from the\npandemic the way that stress manifests\neven bad luck\nand then when we toss on a couple of\nother you know lighter fuel on the flame\nthe first bit of lighter fuel is the\ninternet where the most extreme content\nbecomes normalized and then we get an\nimpression that this is what karen's are\nbehaving like day in and day out\nright whereas hopefully think thankfully\ni think\nyou know people are not\nthis isn't happening every day to people\ni mean we encounter it from time to time\neveryone encounters it from time to time\nbut the internet is is all about making\nthe extreme and rare very very common\nright that's what we get propagated on\nthis is really simple like even for you\nknow dozens of years dozens now so like\nfor 20 years\nif you look at things like facebook so\nfacebook early early on when we were\nlooking at the early impacts of of\nmental health on facebook or even things\nlike twitch you know this applies to\nbasically all the platforms\nyou know where we're like i log on it's\nmy birthday one day out of 365 days a\nyear but every day i log on and i see\nlike people celebrating their birthdays\nit makes me feel like people are just\nhaving the time of their life all the\ntime\nbecause the things that are most upvoted\nthe things that are liked the most are\nthe things that are going to show up on\nmy feed\nand so one thing from each person on my\nhow many friend people i'm friends with\nis going to show up on my feed once a\nyear one birthday but what it looks to\nme is i'm only celebrating my birthday\none day out of 365 and all these people\nare constantly celebrating birthdays and\nconstantly having a good time\nso the extremes rise to the top and give\nus an unfair perspective on what the\nworld is actually like so this is why\nlike spending time on the internet skews\nour view\nthat combined with things like online\ndrift and online radicalization when\nkaren's participate in these online\ncommunities\nwhere you know the people are being\nracially attacked constantly\nand let's remember that these online\ncommunities don't really think\ncritically right and the ones that we're\na part of you may think ahahahaha the\nkaren's they're they're not thinking\ncritically but i guarantee you the\ncommunity you're not you're in right now\ndoesn't think critically either that's\njust not how they work\nso if i go onto the dota 2 subreddit and\npost make a post about lol i object i\nplayed both of these games for five\nyears i objectively think that law is\nbetter here's why i'm gonna get\ndownvoted into oblivion no one's gonna\ntake that seriously i can go under the\nlaw subreddit and do the same thing\ni played both of these games and you can\nmake the same exact post\nand if you post it in the dota 2\nsubreddit dota 2 is better than lol\nyou're gonna get a thousand upvotes\nif you post it in the law subreddit\nyou're going to get ten thousand down\nvotes because the law the community is\nso much bigger\nright\nso this is where like this is going to\nhappen in online communities and we're\nnot actually that different\nso this online drift sort of reinforces\nthe ideas that karen has and then once\nagain once we make fun of the karen's\nright because we don't treat them with\ncompassion\nso if i had to ask y'all you know my\nsense is that the person who is the\nleast deserving\nthe class of people who is the least\ndeserving\nof compassion are karen's\nright on the internet\nand so this is just a consequence of the\nworld that we live in\nso that's that's what i'm thinking about\nkaren's hopefully that'll help you\nunderstand\nuh last thing i'll kind of give you give\nyou some hopefully some tips\nabout how to deal with a cairn in the\nwild but unclear whether these will\nactually work\nso the first thing is to remember that a\nkaren is not a person it's a state\ni believe this it's a state of mind\nso this goes back to something that i\nremember learning in medical school\nthere where there aren't good doctors\nand bad doctors that's actually not true\nthere are but generally speaking there\nare good doctor days and bad doctor days\nright all doctors have good days all\ndoctors have bad days and if you're a\npatient who encounters a doctor on a bad\nday you're going to conclude that this\nis a bad doctor\nthe truth is there's good doctor days\nand they're bad doctor days now there\nare bad doctors there are some doctors\nwho have\nsuch a high amount of bad doctor days\nand make you know bad medical decisions\non a consistent basis that they're bad\ndoctors\num but generally speaking i think that's\ntrue so remember to try to have a little\nbit of compassion for the karen\nright so i think this is the kind of\nthing where like making them feel stupid\nmay make you feel good\nbut it's probably not going to help the\nsituation\nthat being said it is important to set\ngood boundaries with a karen right so\nthis is where like i i personally like\nit when managers have their employees\nback and don't reinforce the behavior of\nthe karen do do something good for the\nworld\nand don't appease them and at the same\ntime treat them with a compassion right\nso this is one of the most challenging\nthings that you can do\nso the heart one of the hardest skills\nto learn is how to be compassionate\nwhile\nmaintaining your boundaries so the two\ntend to like feel different right so for\npeople who\nwhen we be nice we tend to like\ncompromise our boundaries oh yeah it's\nokay don't worry about it you don't have\nto get me something for\nyou know\nmy birthday even though i've gotten new\nthings for your birthday for the last\nthree years\nit's okay\nand or what we do is we get mad at\npeople and then we lack compassion\nso you know try to recognize that\nthey're having a bad day enforce your\nboundary\nhold it and they may explode and then\nyou know there's nothing else you can do\nabout that which is why i think that\nthis is this sort of you know you got to\ntake this with a grain of salt because i\nthink for some of the videos that i've\nseen of like karen's exploding like i\ndon't think that that's you know strong\nbehavioral reinforcement like kicking\nhim out calling the police those are\ngonna be the only your only options\nbut i do think that the world you know\nmaybe you can prevent things from\ngetting that\nto that point by trying to be just a\nlittle bit more compassionate\nquestions\nis there a guidebook to karen's no i\nthink this video is like the first\nattempt at something like that right\ndo karen smell fear absolutely so i know\nit sounds like a funny question but i\nthink so so i think a lot of people if\nyou look at cluster b personality\ndisordered people\nthey are very very good at detecting\nparticular things in other human beings\nso this is kind of a weird study that\ni've cited before\nso they took a group of people with\nborderline personality disorder\nand what they sort of when you say can\nthey smell fear you have no idea how\nright you are\nso they took a people with borderline\npersonality disorder and they took they\nfilmed\na regular face that was smiling\ngoing to a frown\nso smiling\ni hate you\nright\nso if you take that video of me smiling\nto being angry and you split it up into\na hundred still photographs\nand somewhere in the middle\nis gonna be a half smile and half frown\nright\nso if you take a normal person isn't a\nperson who doesn't have a personality\ndisorder\ntheir brain cannot detect the anger\nuntil you're after the halfway point\nso when we're at 51 to 60 percent angry\nfrom smiling when we're less than half\nsmiling and more than half angry then a\nnormal brain detects\nanger\nfor someone who has bpd they detect\nanger at 20 to 30 percent\nright so this is actually like it's not\nwhen we say normal brain i'm not saying\ntheir brain is like abnormal or ill or\nanything their brain has grown up\nto be more sensitive\nit's actually its detection capability\nis superior to a normal brain\nso they can actually detect a negative\nemotion faster which can be really\nreally\nchallenging it also sort of makes sense\nright so if i'm a narcissist\nand someone\nis going to disrespect me\ni can't wait until they're at 51\ndisrespect to act\nright the second i detect 20 or 30\npercent this is why we say narcissists\nare sensitive\nso if you have a compliment but you\ndon't emotionally like that praise is\nnot authentic or genuine\nlike the narcissist will detect it\nthey'll say like what's wrong\nright\nand if you all have been in a\nrelationship with someone who's got\ncluster b something and they're like\ntell me what's wrong and you're like\nnothing's wrong everything's fine\nbecause you're at 51 percent happy 60\nhappy 70 happy but they're still able to\ndetect that 20 to 30 unhappiness then\nthey keep asking you what's wrong what's\nwrong what's wrong and then they push\nyou and push you and push you you feel\nmore frustrated and then finally it\ncomes out and then the person is like\nhaha i knew it all along\ni knew that that nastiness was in there\ni knew you were upset with me i knew you\nwere mad at me\nand so then the behavior gets reinforced\nthe bias gets confirmed and then they do\nit again\nso can karen smell fear i think so i\nreally think so i think they can detect\nwhen a particular behavior will work\nright so if they smell fear they're\ngoing to escalate their bullying because\nthey know it'll work and they get they\nmay be able to detect it 30 40 fear even\nwhen you're 70 confident you're waffling\na little bit\nthey'll smell it and they'll go for it\nokay my question is when talking about\nempathy in a person as someone\nis to be someone\nbe empathic do they need to be born with\nit or is it a skill that\nmost people can learn both\nso your upbringing will sort of\nnaturally get you to a certain level of\nempathy but the cool thing that we've\nlearned is that uh eq or emotional\nquotient which is like iq can actually\nbe developed\nso it's our our hypothesis that\nimprovements in our coaching program the\nsingle thing that the coaching program\nthe single variable that is the most\nuniversal about how our coaching program\nhelps people is by boosting eq so i\nconstantly ask my girlfriend what's\nwrong because i feel like she's actually\nupset does that suggest that i might be\na narcissist\nso remember that the labels are\nconstellations of things\nbut the thing does not necessarily mean\nthat you have the label\nokay so for example\nin depression\nwe can see weight gain\nbut everyone who gains weight does not\nhave depression\ndoes that make sense there are all kinds\nof reasons why you might have depression\nthere are all kinds of reasons\nwhy you know if your girlfriend you\nconstantly ask your girlfriend what's\nwrong because i feel like she's actually\nupset does that suggest i might be a\nnarcissist not really because there are\nlots of reasons why you would constantly\nask your girlfriend why she's upset\nso i would not come away with this with\na label so the diagnosis of a\npersonality disorder certainly can't be\ndone by listening to a dude talking on\nstream and even in a clinical setting\ngenerally speaking requires six months\nof observation\nso the the gold standard for diagnosing\na personality disorder requires\nsix months of psychiatric observation or\ntreatment\nokay and why is that it's because\nremember that narcissism is a defense\nmechanism so everyone has it\nso why do you need six months you need\nto track someone over time because you\ncould be catching them at a bad point\nwhen they're under a lot of stress they\nmay seem narcissistic they may seem\nborderline but that's an effect of the\nstress and once the stress goes away\nthey're kind of back to normal people\nwho have true personality disorders\nwhich remember is like somewhere around\n4.8 percent\nfor four to seven percent of the\npopulation so exceedingly small\nright so chances are there's like a five\npercent chance that you have this so\nit's low\n95 chance that you don't have\nand so we can sort of respond with these\ndefense mechanisms but the the\npersonality disorder is diagnosed when\nthis is kind of your default state\ncan people with aspd develop or learn\nempathy sort of so it depends on the\nperson\nso in my experience i've seen two\nclassifications of aspd which is\nantisocial personality disorder\none is where there's like really\nsomething going on in their brain\nthat makes it very very hard or i would\neven say like\ndamn near impossible to learn empathy\nbut there are a lot of people who get\ndiagnosed with stuff who are not like\nthat so this is the other thing to\nremember about psychiatric diagnoses is\nthey're not like\nthey're\npatterns that we've recognized so it's\nnot like some of these binary questions\nwill be yes or no it's not like a stroke\nwhere a stroke is like a discrete\nphysical thing that we can track to a\nparticular part of the brain and be very\npredictive about what it's going to do\nto you whereas for things like aspd\nthese are like\npsychiatrists have made observations we\ndon't have biopsies we don't have x-rays\nso i'm not saying they're not real\nthings but they're not as deterministic\nas other diseases if you know you've\nbecome a sociopath is there a way to\nrewire your brain to feel emotions like\nyou should yeah so let's talk about this\nso if you know you have become a\nsociopath the first question is how do\nyou know you've become a sociopath see i\nthink you all are making hopefully\nmaking this mistake because it's a good\nmistake to make\nso if you've been\nevaluated for six months or a year by a\nclinician and they've diagnosed you with\nantisocial personality disorder and they\nsay you are a sociopath that's one thing\nbut a lot of times what happens this is\nexactly why we say like we don't just\nuse that medical disclaimer as like a\nyou know cover you're asking this is\nimportant to understand because a lot of\npeople run around diagnosing themselves\nas sociopaths well how did you come to\nthat conclusion well because i don't\nfeel emotions so this is exactly what\nhappens is what people do is they'll\npick one symptom\nand then they'll\narrive at a diagnosis oh because i can't\nfeel emotions i'm a sociopath but what\nyou have to remember is that inability\nto feel emotions has a differential\ndiagnosis\nso maybe you're depressed\nmaybe you're numb maybe you're using\nsubstances maybe you're a lexa-thymic\nso that's why i'm kind of saying like\neven for people who have come into my\noffice with a diagnosis of antisocial\npersonality disorder i found that\nthere's actually two groups\none is like where there's some of this\nother stuff going on like emotional\nnumbness which over time like once we\nuncover that stuff then they're able to\nlike feel emotions and stuff like that\nwhereas the other group like really has\ntrouble with that so i don't really know\nabout that group\nright so if you say\nif you know you have become a sociopath\nis there a way to rewire your brain i'd\nsay like\nunless you have a really really good\nreason which is i concluded is not a\ngood reason\nif you're using a label of sociopath\nthat needs to be assigned by someone who\nknows what it is and knows how to\nevaluate it from it properly not this is\nwhat i think a sociopath is i've watched\na thousand videos on youtube therefore i\nknow\ni'm not saying that your experience\ndoesn't resonate with those things but\nthat's why differential diagnosis is so\nimportant i'd say the biggest thing that\npeople miss on the internet is the\nconcept of differential diagnosis\nyou"
