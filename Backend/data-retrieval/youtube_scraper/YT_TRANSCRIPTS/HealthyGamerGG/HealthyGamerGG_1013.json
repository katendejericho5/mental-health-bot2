    "transcript": "if i've never been depressed and i see\nsomeone who is depressed and acting this\nway\nwhat i'm gonna think is like if i were\nacting that way what would be going on\ninside me it's like i'm very depressed\nfor 48 hours but then if i go to a party\ni'm having the time of my life and i\nfeel fantastic and the devastating thing\nabout depression more so than any other\nillness is that it attacks your ability\nto fight back if someone's not really\ndoesn't have\na neurochemical depression and like i\nstart prescribing a bunch of medication\nlike i'm actually doing more harm than\ngood right because they're not going to\nget any benefit from it they're going to\nsuffer from side effects they may do\nthings like gain weight have\nyou know\nsexual side effects and stuff like that\ni'm actually doing them harm so it's\nimportant to understand this\nyou really think they're depressed i\nmean they walk around all day long\narguing\ngetting mad\nyelling cursing me out just gets to walk\naround and act like a jerk all day it's\njust unbelievable seems like he just\nwants things handed to him he expects\npeople to just jump and do whatever he\nwants i don't get it\nsleeps all day he's up all night he eats\nwhat he wants total junk food can't lift\na pencil to do his school work i mean\nit's just unbelievable yeah that's\nexactly what i'm saying he's depressed\nand that's what happens when you're\ndepressed you don't just\nget sad and down you also get irritable\nand angry\nimagine living your life completely cut\noff\nfrom feelings like\ncontentment satisfaction\nhappiness\nexcitement when all you can feel is\nirritation\nanger agitation and nothing nothing\nbrings you relief\nthat's depression and i know you get a\nlot of degrees and everything but\ni don't know yeah so i think this is\nlike a\ngreat representation of and this guy's a\npsychologist by the way\nso like\ni think it's a great representation of\nhow hard it is for people who haven't\nexperienced depression\nto understand depression\nso what you see on the outside is the\nbehaviors\nright and then what we naturally do when\nwe see a behavior as human beings is we\nattribute\nour own experiences and internal\nenvironments and motivation to that\nbehavior\nand so that's what we assume the other\nperson is thinking so if they were like\nif i've never been depressed and i see\nsomeone who is depressed and acting this\nway\nwhat i'm gonna think is like if i were\nacting that way what would be going on\ninside me and they conclude like if i\nwas just like eating and sleeping like i\nwas sleeping whenever i want to eating\nwhatever i want to being an like\nthat would just be me being a lazy\nbecause you've you haven't experienced\ndepression right and so they like if i\nwas doing that i would definitely be a\nlazy because like when i have\ndone those kinds of things it has been\ncloser to the lazy\nand they look at sometimes their child\nand they'll say like oh my god\nthat's what they're doing too but that's\nbecause they don't really understand\nthat the internal experience is quite\ndifferent and i think this guy does a\nfantastic job\nof describing i i love the way he says\ncut off from\nso one of the key features of depression\na clinical depression or major\ndepressive disorder or a depressive\nepisode is anhedonia\nso anhedonia is the inability to\nexperience pleasure\nso like literally what happens is there\nare activities one of the key specific\ndiagnostic questions of depression\nright if you're trying to figure out if\nsomeone has a major depressive disorder\nversus like narcissism and has had a\nnarcissistic injury is you ask them are\nyou able to enjoy things that you\nusually enjoy\nand for people who have personality\ndisorders\nthey can still enjoy stuff\nbecause their neurochemistry is like\nmore normal let's say it's just a gross\ngeneralization but so they can still\nlike have a good time which is why their\ndepression fluctuates wildly it's like\ni'm very depressed for 48 hours but then\nif i go to a party i'm having the time\nin my life and i feel fantastic more\nconsistent with a personality disorder\nso they're not actually anthodonic but\nif you talk to the person with\npersonality disorder and the person with\na major depressive disorder or bipolar\ndisorder\nduring the periods where they're\ndepressed they'll their experience can\nbe very similar\nso anhedonia is one of the key features\nof like clinical depression\nand that's the being cut off essentially\nfrom things that you enjoy\nso what would your mood be like if you\njust couldn't have fun anymore there was\na block on your ability to have fun\nright you may get irritable you may get\npissed\nyou may find yourself chasing after\nthings that usually help you feel good\nlike eating like crap\nright you may also be getting\nphysiologic reinforcement from some of\nthose things that are not subjectively\nexperienced\nso when you eat this is where\nyou know sometimes\nthere's there are elements to this that\nare more physiologic so for example when\ni eat unhealthy food even if my brain is\nunable to experience pleasure from it\nthere are going to be things like taste\nreceptors\nand um you know different kinds of like\nlike chemicals like leptin\nand ghrelin and stuff like that that are\ngoing to get altered in a reinforcing\nway\neven though i don't enjoy it so that's\nwhy i do it if i don't enjoy it right\nbecause there are other parts of you\nthat are reinforcing that behavior\nand so that's like that's honestly a\ngood representation the other thing that\ni think a lot of people miss out on is\nthat we shared this the other day but um\nif we look there's actually\nuh i'll find this again\nwhat people don't realize is that for a\nthird of people\ndepression manifests as anger\nokay so we're going to just take a quick\nlook at this paper this is this is a\nreally fascinating study\nso by maurizio fava who's i think now\nmaybe jerry or mauricio one of them is\nchief of psychiatry at mass general\nhospital\num\nand\nwhat he sort of what maurizio did is he\nhe did a a study looking at anger\nattacks and depression\nand what he discovered was that\napproximately one third of depressed\noutpatients present with anger attacks\nso their primary experience of\ndepression is not sadness but is anger\nand irritability\nand it's just something about the way\nthat we're wired which interestingly\nenough ayurveda makes predictions for so\nwe've steered clear of ir\nrecently because we're just really\nevaluating the science some people in\nour community had some really good\ncriticisms about the scientific nature\nor lack of scientific nature of ayurveda\nso we're kind of looking at that but\nit's interesting because ayurveda has\nbeen describing exactly this right so\nliterally what ayurveda has been saying\nis that a third of people will manifest\nwith like periods of irritability and\nthey also call it a third because\nthere's their bit that depression so\nthere's a video about that if that you\nknow on dr case guide to depression\nbut it's interesting that you know 3 000\n4 000 years later\nyou know\nthis guy publishes this paper that finds\nthe exact same thing\num which is why we sort of were\nsupportive of it in the first place but\nanyway\nso it's very common that like a lot of\npeople don't realize that depression can\nmanifest is like being an ass\nnow the tricky thing\nif we really want to complicate things\nthe tricky thing is that sometimes\nwill use depression as an excuse\nso sometimes\nand this is not uncommon actually\nor do they have depression sure\nsometimes they do sometimes they don't\nsometimes they have a subjective feeling\nof depression but what they've learned\nto do\nis that depression essentially gets you\nsome benefits\nright like i don't have to do my chores\nif i'm depressed\nand you may say like oh dr k isn't that\ninsensitive well it's true\nright and it's important to recognize\nthat as a mental health professional and\nas an individual\nright because if i'm like if someone's\nnot really doesn't have a neurochemical\ndepression\nand like i start prescribing a bunch of\nmedication like i'm actually doing more\nharm than good right because they're not\ngoing to get any benefit from it they're\ngoing to suffer from side effects they\nmay do things like gain weight have\nyou know sexual side effects and stuff\nlike that i'm actually doing them harm\nso it's important to understand this\nit's really interesting\nso there's something something called\npseudo seizures or non-epileptiform\nseizures\nso this is like seizure-like movements\nthat are not actually caused by\nelectrical activity in the brain\nso generally speaking when we have a\nseizure\nwhat it means is that we have\nunregulated electrical activity in the\nbrain right so our like\nmotor cortices are like firing off and\nso then as a result we'll like literally\nseize okay\nso that's an ep it's epilepsy it's\nelectrical activity in the brain that's\ncausing you to move\nso there's also seizure-like behavior\nwhich are called pseudo seizures which\nare when someone does this\nwe'll see this sometimes on tick-tock as\nwell\nwhere someone does this kind of stuff\nbut it's not a seizure it's not actually\nlike there's\nelectrical activity in the brain that is\nout of control\nso it's called a pseudo-seizure\nnow what's really interesting\nis that 50\nof the people who have pseudoseizures\nalso have real seizures\nit's an alarmingly high co-morbidity so\nthey'll have real seizures and\nquote-unquote fake seizures or\nnon-epileptiform seizures is what we\ncall it\nand then the question becomes why is\nthat it's because human beings are\nadaptable\nso what someone with epilepsy learns\nright like subconsciously what they\nlearn\nis that when i have a seizure\nthere are particular advantages to it\nright like people will do stuff for me\npeople will demonstrate compassion\nthey will care about me\ni don't have to do as much work i get\nextensions on my deadlines\nand then the brain is smart\nso the brain realizes\nis like\ncool\nlike if i need to get out of something\ni've got an ace in the hole\nand it's really devastating hopefully\ni'm not you know being insensitive here\nbut this is just medical fact\nthe comorbidity of pseudo seizures and\nseizures is really high in that\ndirection but not 50 it's not 50 of real\nuh people who have epileptiform seizures\ndevelop pseudo seizures that's not the\nstatistic it's 50 of people who have\npseudo seizures also have epilepsy\nso it goes one way not both ways if that\nmakes sense if you guys understand\nlike biostatistics\nand so that's what happens so we see\nthis with with mental health too where\nsome people will\ngenuinely have mental illness\nand\nthey will use that mental illness as an\nexcuse which is how people work\nright\nand so oftentimes what we tend to see is\nthat people who have pseudo seizures\nthey'll send them to a psychiatrist\nwhich they absolutely hate by the way\nthe patients hate it but what we tend to\nfind is that the pseudo seizures are\nserving a function\nthey're helping people\ncope communicate or get something that\nthey need\nthey're getting their needs met through\ntheir pseudo-seizure-like activity\nand if you teach them how to get their\nneeds met in other ways the\npseudo-seizures will go down\nnow for people to say oh it's fake\nwhy are you putting up with it it's not\nthat simple\nright so like is it fake sort yeah i\nmean it's not epileptiform but it's\nreally coming from a very genuine place\nand it doesn't help to call it out it\ndoesn't actually makes things worse\nright so you have to understand that\npeople are going to do what they need to\nto get their needs met\nall right so it's interesting so i've\ni've seen this a lot where there's like\nwhat is that fake disorder cringe or\nsomething\nwhere it's like you know people are\nyou know\nit's a lot like it's really easy to\njudge on the internet like look at\nsomeone be like oh my god this guy's\nlike so terrible person\nit's like sure there may be an element\nof that's true but it's complicated\npeople who have pseudo-seizures\nor as people put it fake disorders\nthey're not necessarily bad people are\nthey making things more complicated sure\nis it sometimes very insensitive to\npeople who are actually like have an\nepilep epileptic condition absolutely\nso there are criticisms to be made but\nthere's also like some amount of\nunderstanding to be had right there's\nsome amount of compassion and like what\nlike people don't just wake up one day\nand like i'mma pretend to be mentally\nill\nlike think about\nwhat your life would have to be like\nin order to do that so what i see what\ni've personally seen is that trauma is\nlike the biggest thing that makes me\nthink about this stuff\n[Music]\nso this is kind of a\nthis is a it captures very very very\nvery quickly\none of the biggest problems with\ndepression\nso internally i made this connection i\ndon't really share it publicly because i\nthink it\ncomes with\nconnotations that\nare probably not good to share but\nwhen i was\ntraining to become a psychiatrist i\nrealized one day in my mind i made this\nconnection\nthat\ndepression is almost the hiv of mental\nillness\nnow there's a lot of things that are\nproblematic with that comparison so\ndon't hold me to that but here's the\nconnection that i made it's just like my\nneurons form this thing so the reason\nthat hiv is so devastating is because\nit attacks your ability to fight back\nand the devastating thing about\ndepression more so than any other\nillness is that it attacks your ability\nto fight back\nright so like it's one thing to be\nsuicidal\nbut it's another thing to deserve that\nyou want to die or that you sorry that\nyou deserve to die\nso you can see suicidality for example\nin schizophrenia\nright and even if you see suicidality\nand schizophrenia the reason they're\nsuicidal is because they're suffering so\nmuch it's not that they deserve to die\nit's that they're being tracked the\ndevil is like\nhunting them\nthe fbi is following them you'll see\nlike all these kind of delusional kind\nof thinking and so like the only escape\nthat you have is death\nbut even in that moment if i if i talk\nto someone who has a psychotic disorder\nhopefully and i sort of say like hey if\ni can like\nmake all this stuff go away would you\nwant to live and they'd say like yes\nabsolutely\nit's been my experience anyway\nbut in depression people your mind is\nworking against you\nand so it handicaps your ability to\nfight back\nso the more that you struggle\nright like\nyou get all these weird paradoxical\nresponses that keep you from getting\nbetter\nso like no one cares about you\nthat's what your mind tells you\nright like i need help but no one cares\nabout you\nparadoxically we see this even with\nmental health professionals\nwhen i have a patient who's got\ndepression who stops showing up at my\noffice i get really worried\nright because\nlike and even afterward like i'll talk\nto them i mean thankfully things have\ngone generally well i've been pretty\nlucky\nand my patients have been quite\nresilient\nthey'll come to me and they'll be like\nyou know i was thinking like i didn't\nwant to disappoint you really common one\nbecause i did so well i was doing so\nwell for like 12 months 14 months like\nwe're meditating we're doing yoga we're\nputting in all this effort\nand you're such a good doctor you care\nso much and like as i got sick i\nrealized like it must be me\nand i was so ashamed to come\nbecause it means that like even you\ncan't help me\nand i didn't want to disappoint you\nhappens so much such a big problem as a\ntherapist\nthat your patients want you to respect\nthem they want you to be proud of them\nthey want the treatment to work you're\nworking hard they're working hard you\ncare so much you deserve to have a\ntriumph as a treater\nso the patient prioritizes your feelings\nover their own they feel doubly worse\nso when they should come to the office\nthey don't\nand if y'all are sitting at home\nskipping therapist therapy appointments\nyou should absolutely go\ni can i mean i can't guarantee you but i\nfeel very confident that if you have a\nhalfway decent therapist they will not\nbe disappointed if you get sick in fact\nthey're the ones who understand that it\ncomes and goes\nbeing depressed is not a personal\nfailing\nright that's the biggest problem is that\nlike clinicians understand that whereas\npatients don't people don't\nespecially when the depression strikes\nbecause when the depression strikes your\nbrain is well your brain is blaming you\nso even if intellectually you understand\nthat it's not your fault\nbut your blame your brain is going to be\nblaming you for whatever it can oh yeah\nif you were a better patient you\nwouldn't be so depressed\nif you had done more yoga if you had\ndone more meditation\nit's always there pointing the finger at\nyou right no one else's fault all your\nfault\nit even says crazy thoughts\nlike people would be better without you\nlike oh like\ncan you imagine\nhow bad your doctor feels when you come\nin week after week after week and don't\nget better\nyou do the world\na favor by helping your doctor\nhelp someone else who deserves to be\nhelped these are all the crazy thoughts\nit sends you\nand that's what i mean when i say it's\nlike the hiv of mental illness like it\nattacks you on such a fundamental level\nthat it makes everything your fault you\ncan't fight back\nand then you retreat from the very\nthings that you need\nthe other thing that it kind of just\nreminded me of in this moment is\nsomething like rabies where like the\nmore dehydrated you are you're afraid of\nwater and that which will save you you\nwant to run away from\nand so that's why it's so devastating\nbut it's really important to understand\nthis\nthat like the whole point is that in\ndepression your mind is always going to\nbe telling you that it's your fault\nand that's why it's weird but you have\nto learn to distrust the mind\nright a healthy amount of distrust of\nyour own mind is good it's part of yoga\nit's the recognition that your mind is\nnot an arbiter of truth or reality it's\njust your mind it's full of cognitive\nbiases\nand so that's where sometimes even on\nstream and stuff we'll try to point out\nto people how their mind works it's not\na clinical intervention it's just like\neveryone should understand\nwhat is my mind doing now why is it\ndoing that what are the patterns of my\nmind what does it learn how to do\nand as you learn the patterns of your\nmind hopefully you will gain the ability\nto overcome it\nright and for people who are saying\ndistrust i'm not saying a hundred\npercent i'm saying be skeptical because\nyour mind i know it's kind of weird\nlet's think about this for a second\nyour mind has the capacity to be wrong\nright\nso you shouldn't trust it 100\nit's right most of the time\nbut it's really really important for you\nto understand which of the thoughts are\nwrong\nas bashwick is saying not my mind where\ndid that thought come from\nit's funny i know you're joking but\nthat's actually what happens in\ndepression\nis the mind tells you no no i'm 100\ncorrect\ni know you have some thoughts that make\nyou think that your family love you but\nno no listen to me\nlisten to me\ni'm the one who's looking out for you\nso it's hard\nreally hard\nwhat if my thinking about flawed\nthinking is flawed very good question\nthis is why you need to do\nand as patanjali put it there's two\nkinds of knowledge right knowledge and\nwrong knowledge\nyou"
