    "transcript": "now to avoid\nthem responding right so like the thing\nabout a conversation though is that like\ni'm gonna ups i could upset them and i\nhave to deal with that so people try to\navoid conversations because\nconversations are scary things\nbecause the whole point that you're\nlying in the first place is because\nyou're trying to avoid conflict if you\nhave a conversation you may be locking\nyourself into conflict and you will have\nno option to escape if they get upset\nwith you\nlying to avoid conflict\ni know i usually lie when someone treats\nme unfairly and just say things to\nde-escalate the situation instead of\nbeing assertive and setting boundaries\ni also do the same thing when when they\napologize later but about a minute later\ni'm thinking about what was honest and\nwhat i should have said to set the tone\nfor how i should be treated\npart of it is that i just don't think\nabout boundaries and standards and being\nassertive in the moment because i'm\nconcerned with how they feel and don't\neven think about my own feelings until\nafter\nlike realizing after that\neven with their apologies they blame how\nthey treated me on what i said even if i\ndidn't say anything insulting\nso i feel like their apology is\ninsincere\ni think this comes from having to\nconstantly de-escalate fights with my\nparents growing up\nbut also maybe some adhd because i don't\ni just don't feel\neven feel upset about it until\nafterwards where my focus isn't just on\nending and de-escalating the situation\nwhere they are angry and being insulting\nover nothing\nnote this pattern applies to nearly\neverybody no matter their relationship\nto me\ni'd really appreciate dr k's help on\nthis or any solid professional advice so\nspeaking of professional advice not a\nbad idea right especially if you've got\nadhd and you're having interpersonal\nproblems\num\ngood idea to see a therapist because one\nof the under\nso\nunderappreciated problems with adhd is\nthe social consequences and social\nproblems\nso let's talk a little bit about this\nsometimes\nwe have conflict with people\nsometimes people don't treat us well\nand when they don't treat us well\nwe know that they don't treat us well we\ndon't want them to treat us this way\nbut\nwe care about their feelings more than\nour own\nso we'll lie\nhow was the food today sir oh everything\nwas fantastic\ni could barely eat it\nright\nso we care about other people's feelings\nmore than our own\nand then we have trouble setting good\nboundaries with people so the one of the\nnumber one reasons if you guys saw our\nboundary setting stream recently\none of the number one reasons that we\nhave\ntrouble setting good boundaries is\nbecause of our own emotional state and\nour inability to upset other people\nand so then what happens is in this\nperson's case like they even come and\napologize to them right they say oh i'm\nsorry for treating you this way\nand then what we do is like we say like\noh it's not that big of a deal don't\nworry about it\nand it's almost reflexive right so this\nperson has done a good job they've been\npaying attention to themselves\nmaybe like watching us for a while so\nthey recognize oh where does this\npattern come from\nmaybe it comes from my childhood maybe\nit comes from de-escalating situations\nmaybe it comes from my brain being wired\nto\nkeep the peace\ni become the mediator\nright so it's almost like you're the\ntherapist in your family and remember\nlike as therapists like our feelings\ndon't matter right we're there for the\nother person\nso in this way we see a lot of social\nsituations where one person becomes the\nmediator even the therapist and they\nbecome responsible for other people's\nfeelings\nand so what they learn to do what they\nevolve to do what they adapt to do\nis set their feelings aside for the sake\nof\nharmony so it's not that\nand this is important to understand it's\nnot that you can't stand up for yourself\nit's that you have learned your brain\nhas adapted to prioritize harmony over\npersonal satisfaction\nright so harmony is responsible for so\nmany problems within interpersonal\nrelationships\nand interestingly enough it's also\ngenerally speaking the reason that we're\nwired that way is because that's what\nworks well\nright so from an evolutionary standpoint\nfor the most part\nhuman beings had a small cluster of\navailable people so we think about the\nlifespan or the evolution of how human\nbeings have been\nso we used to be like tribal right so my\ngrandmother had a village of like 150\npeople which is like most of who she met\nher entire life would be that 150 people\nand then 100 years from that like humans\nlike had a network of like 150 people\neven think about your life now like how\nrelatively small it is\nyou've met hundreds or thousands of\npeople but your network is actually\npretty small\nwe didn't have the option to move across\ncountry and find a job right that wasn't\nlike a thing\nlike 6 000 years ago it wasn't a thing\nyou had your tribe monkeys have their\ntribe apes have their tribe\nso harmony within the tribe and the\nfamily unit was like the top priority\nwhich is how our brains have evolved\nthere's nothing wrong with you if you\ncan't set boundaries like this it's not\njust that your parents may have had this\nkind of conflict understand this is what\nwe're designed for\nis to preserve harmony within the unit\nbecause the you know six thousand years\nago ten thousand years ago fifty\nthousand years ago a human being on\ntheir own didn't survive\nright the tribe's harmony matters a lot\nso\nwhat do you do about it\nright so if you're fine if you're\nsomeone who has difficulty like\nupsetting other people for the sake of\nharmony maybe it has something to do\nwith your upbringing maybe it has to do\nwith like basically the way your brain\nis wired but what do you do about it\nand the interesting thing here is that\nwe all have this notion\nthat you're supposed to set boundaries\nwith person uh someone in the moment\nright so if you're having trouble\nsetting boundaries with someone in the\nmoment because of how you feel so we can\nsay dig into that feeling understand\nwhere that feeling is coming from\nbreathe through it set boundaries with\nthem practice you know you'll you'll get\nbetter at setting boundaries with them\nin the moment\nbut there's also something that's really\nimportant that we tend to lose sight of\nwhich is you can set boundaries with\nthem afterward\nright so a minute later\nif you realize that this is actually not\nokay\nyou can actually tell them a minute\nlater\nright and i know it sounds kind of weird\nbut like why don't we do this is because\nwe feel like idiots\nwe're like\nyeah no it's actually totally fine\nthen a minute later you're like\nit's not fine\nbecause we as human beings don't like to\nbe contradictory to ourselves once i say\nsomething that's the hill that i have to\ndie on right i can't change\ni can't change political views\nright so like if you look at politics a\npolitician changing their views is\nviewed as like a sign of like\nawfulness\nthis politician changed their mind\nyou voted for this bill and then you\nvoted against it\nyou were for war now you're anti-war\nlike oh my god like that's terrible it's\nlike maybe the politicians learned\nsomething\njust like we did\nand maybe we should actually like\nsupport politicians who are willing to\nadapt their views based on like new\ninformation and circumstances\nbut that's not how we think\nbecause we want to be consistent\nwe want to be judged for consistent\nwhich is there for a reason too\nright just because it's not ideal\ndoesn't mean that there isn't a good\nreason it's there so the first thing is\nyou can set boundaries with them\nafterward\nand recognize that it's going to feel\nweird for you\nbut i'll give you all some language okay\nso we're going to talk a little bit\nabout if you\nlie to avoid conflict\nif you\ndon't set boundaries with people when\nyou should\nbecause it's emotionally very difficult\nfor you you can absolutely get stronger\nemotionally and like learn where that\ncomes from and get better at sending\nboundaries with them you should practice\nthat but you can also do it afterward\nbecause afterward it's gonna be some of\nthe same feeling right because you're\nstill engaging in that conflict but you\nmay be in a better head space to do it\nso you can like level up afterward even\nthough it feels a little bit weird\nso you can circle back and this is what\ni'd say and say hey i know you\napologized and i said actually wasn't a\nbig deal\ni've been thinking about it i've been\nreflecting and i've come to realize that\nlike i think your apology actually\nreally was appropriate and you were\nactually out of line\nand i accept your apology\ni also realized that i care about our\nrelationship so much that i didn't want\nyou to feel bad even though what you did\nwas wrong\nbut after really thinking about it i\nrealized what you did was wrong and i\nreally appreciate your apology\nyou can say that\nor if you don't set boundaries with them\nin the moment\nand they don't you know they haven't\napologized you can also say circle back\nand say\nhey i didn't mention this you know\nearlier but i was thinking a little bit\nabout and actually what you did was not\nokay\nand then you can lay it out say like i\nreally felt like that was disrespectful\nand then when you do that like all of\nthat\nconflict avoidance fear is going to come\nup but you can just do it afterward\nright you can just circle back and say\nhey by the way\nnow here's a couple of interesting\nthings to keep in mind so let's go into\na little bit more specifics here okay\nso the medium through which you do this\nis really really important\nall right i'm going to give you all kind\nof like three options\nso there's conversation there's text\nmessage and there's email this archaic\nthing this relic of a pass along past\nage or writing a letter right so there's\nlike written communication there's text\nand there's conversation so a lot of\npeople may be very very\navoidant of conversation i think ideally\nconversation is the best\nbut the whole point is that you may not\nlike you may lose your courage if you\ntry to have a conversation right or fax\nor carrier pigeon both good options\nwriting a letter\nhand delivered note\nengraved plaque\nthese are all options as well chiseled\nstone\nalphabet soup arranged lovingly\nand glued to a piece of construction\npaper\nall excellent options\nright\nbaking a birthday cake with a message on\nit that says fu\nall all good options all good q a form\ntablets\nright\nso these are all good options of\ncommunication\nyeah cutting letters out of newspaper\nsure\nfish in the bed sometimes works well to\nsend a message and convey your thoughts\nand feelings\nso here's a couple things to remember\nso what a lot of people will do is\nthey'll want to send like a dm or text\nmessage or message someone on discord or\nwhatever okay\nnow why do people want to do that\nbecause it makes it's like less\nscary than confronting someone directly\nright so ideally you want to do this in\na conversation why you want to do it in\nconversation so that if there's any kind\nof response\nyou can you can talk it through\nright so you're not like leaving someone\nwith just one communication presumably\nthey'll respond and you'll like open up\nthe issue and close it at the same time\nhopefully that's the advantage of\nconversation\nthe other advantage of conversation is\nthat there's a lot of like\ninterpretation of body language tone\nfacial expressions which will convey the\nmessage that you're trying to convey\nnow to avoid\nthem responding right so like the thing\nabout a conversation though is that like\ni'm gonna ups i could upset them and i\nhave to deal with that so people try to\navoid conversations because\nconversations are scary things\nbecause the whole point that you're\nlying in the first place is because\nyou're trying to avoid conflict if you\nhave a conversation you may be locking\nyourself into conflict and you all have\nno option to escape if they get upset\nwith you so we want to steer away from\nconversation\nand since all of these things like you\nknow smoke signals and\nyou know newspaper cutouts and whatnot\nare archaic and we don't actually use\nthem what most people will do is dm or\ntext\nthere's some huge problems with dming\nand texting this kind of stuff so the\nfirst is that there's none of that tone\nfacial expression or anything like that\nthat's problem number one so your\nmessage can come across as cold arrogant\nwhatever like it can come across like\nwho knows\nso your message is more into open to\ninterpretation by their cognitive bias\nhuge problem with text messaging it's\nwhy so many fights happen over text\nnext problem with text is that text has\na habitual\nlevel of response\nso if i send you a long message right\nwall of text\nwhich first of all conveys something\nright it's like hey here's my wall of\ntext here's my treatise here's my phd\nthesis on how you hurt my feelings\nplease read it\nso walls of text already set people off\nin the wrong direction on text messaging\nbecause that's not usual\nthe second thing is that it's so easy to\ninstinctively and like\nshallowly respond to a text\nso if i send you a wall of text hey what\nyou did last weekend was really not\nappropriate\ni know i said it wasn't a big deal and\nthat you apologized and i said you\ndidn't need to apologize\nafter thinking about it you really i\nreally do appreciate that you apologize\ni think the apology was necessary and\nappropriate and i accept it and what you\ndid was really out of line thank you for\napologizing\nwhat kind of text message are you going\nto get back so let's put ourselves in\nthe shoes of the person who gets that\nhow are they going to feel they're going\nto feel bad they're going to feel\nattacked they're going to feel held\naccountable\nand so what kind of text message do you\nfire off\nright\nbeautiful\nnp okay\nyeah whatevs bro\nthumbs up\neggplant emoji\nright\nnow how is that how how does it feel to\nreceive that after a wall of text\nall right it's kind of like i don't know\nif this person is\nunderstanding\nso now what you've do done like your\nconflict avoidance you've sent a text\nmessage and you've gotten some like\nsurface level shallow response\nand then what do you do\nlike\ndo you\nright then you're kind of stuck because\nyou're not feeling great there's not\nreally great closure you're not sure if\nthey understood you you're not sure if\neverything really is okay you don't know\nhow they're feeling because remember the\nwhole reason you're lying is to avoid\nconflict the whole reason you're lying\nis to not make them feel bad what when\nsomeone says ku\nor np how are they feeling you have no\nclue you don't know if they understood\nyou you don't know if they respected you\nyou don't know if they agree with you\nyou don't know if they're mad at you and\nthen what is that gonna do to you\nit's gonna drive your anxiety through\nthe roof\nright and so like by avoiding the\nconversation all you're going to do is\ncreate more anxiety for yourself\nit's like text messaging you got to be\nreally careful about setting like you\nknow text message communication\nso that's where like you can you know\ntunnel down like and if you're lucky\nthey're gonna like think about it and\nsend you a substantive response as well\nbut they may not do that and that's not\nreally what text like most of the time\nwhen you text your brain is not like\nlet me you let me write a blog post\nright we even have different language\nfor blog posts versus texts\nso like that's why i think if you can\nconverse but if you're not going to\nconverse\nrecognize that you're opening yourself\nup to this through texting\nand the last thing is that's why i say\nlike honestly like writing an email is\nnot a bad idea depending on who you are\nhow old you are and what the other\nperson is doing\nbecause email has a different tone\npeople don't just respond np to email\nright like the whole point is like it's\nlike a longer message that has more\nthought put into it whereas people are\nlike texting back and forth all times\nlike np and then they forget about it\ndear sir\nright so it's very common\nthat we let people walk all over us\nbecause we're afraid of how they're\ngoing to respond if we set boundaries\nand then we think that the only time we\ncan set boundaries is\nin the moment\nand then a minute later we're like\nyou can actually go back and tell them a\nminute later\nyou can say actually\nby the way i've been thinking about it i\nreflected on it\nand then lay your boundary with them\nbe careful about how you lay it\nconversations are ideal even though they\nmust be the maybe the scariest\nbut remember that just because it's\nscary\nthat can actually be a point in your\nfavor because you're learning to\ntolerate you're creating that situation\nwhich lying causes you to avoid right so\nyou're you're jumping into that cold\nwater when you do that sort of thing\nwhich is exactly what you need to do\nand that's why we sort of sometimes\ndefault to text messaging but think it\nthrough a little bit and then sort of\ndecide what feels right to you\nyou can even send a text message and say\nhey i wanted to let you know\nthis\ni'd appreciate if we could talk about it\nlike please think about what i had to\nsay and i'd love to hear your opinion\nright\nmake sense questions\nyeah so so someone else is saying it's\nso worrying getting a text saying are\nyou free to talk that's why i'm saying\nyou should let them know what the\nconversation is and then ask invite them\nto have a conversation\ndon't be like hey\nwe need to talk\nand it's like the other person's like\nthen they're going to come in paranoid\nright so you want to let them know\nwhat's going on say hey i'd really\nappreciate it if we could talk about it\nso they have time to settle their own\nfeelings they're going to come to the\nconversation more common prepared you're\ngoing to come to the conversation common\nprepared and then you'll have more\nlikely to have a successful conversation\nright\nhow do you deal with jokes that are\nactually incredibly rude and hurtful to\neveryone in the room\nand everyone in the room is laughing but\nyou\nso i honestly like this requires some\namount of courage which if you're the\nbutt of jokes it may be hard to have so\ni don't blame you for that but i would\ncall attention to it\nright so i always just say straight up i\nknow all they all are laughing\ndo you see me laughing\ni don't think this is funny\nit they will shut the [ __ ] up if you say\nthat\nsay it exactly like that\ni understand that you all think it's\nfunny i'm not laughing i don't think\nit's funny\nit will kill the mood instantly people\nwill stop [ __ ] with you\ny'all understand that\nright so you don't have to attack them\nyou just call attention to it so this is\nwhere like\nand if you guys are wondering this is\ngoing to be kind of weird\nhow the hell do you learn to say things\nlike that\nauthenticity\nliving in the present in meditation\nit is what is\nand if they just laugh more\nyou know like you can say like look i\ndon't think you guys are hearing me\ni'm confused what about what i said was\nfunny\nlike they're not going to continue\nlaughing so\nyou know just like call attention to it\nagain and again\nand you learn to see things\nauthentically you know when you meditate\nlike i think a lot of this comes from\nspiritual training as well as like\npsychiatric training\nbut just call it what it is right say\nhey look i care about you guys i enjoy\nbeing here\nbut i've noticed that when we like joke\nlike i'm always the butt of it i don't\nenjoy it\nand now i'm confused i'm like are these\npeople my friends or not\nand that's when i realized maybe y'all\ndon't realize that this is actually\nhurtful to me\nso i can't blame you for something if\nyou all don't if you all think i'm\nhaving a good time so i'm letting you\nknow\ni'm not having a good time\nand i realize it's kind of a buzz kill\nbut i'm struggling i'm like trying to\nfigure out should i come to these things\nor not and so i need to understand\nwhether you all like consider me friends\nand you're\nare you here to have a good time at my\nexpense\nor am i here to like have a good time\nwith you\nand sometimes people can't tolerate it\nlike they can't handle the heat and\nthey'll never invite you again which is\nactually totally fine\nso when it comes to like lying to avoid\nconflict\nyou're gonna select and shape your\nrelationships\nso if you don't ever tell anyone\nthat what they're doing is hurtful to\nyou\nit's not that you're just gonna find\n[ __ ] who will like\nwalk all over you what you're gonna do\nis create people who don't respect your\nboundaries because they don't know it's\na real boundary and as you call\nattention to it some people can't engage\nin that level of conversation\nand then like those are not people that\nyou you know if you're friends with\nthose people who can't engage in\nconversation who can't modify their\nbehavior who don't take you seriously\nthen like that's going to be the\nrelationship that you're signing up for\nsome people can handle it and some\npeople can't\nand sometimes you have to model that\nbecause people don't talk like that\nright so if you say something like that\nno one isn't going to know what the hell\nto say\nsomeone is going to feel awkward they're\nlike my bad i didn't realize you're like\ni really appreciate that thank you\nright\nsorry for killing the mood\ni don't know how to get it back but i\nreally had to say that\nyou can kind of acknowledge that\nit's challenging so when you don't set\nboundaries with people like you're going\nto cultivate them in a particular way\nyou're going to shape their behavior\nand then like we get pissed at them\nbecause like here we are silently like\nbeing so upset about things but then\nthey have no idea they're like oh my god\nmy friends hate me so much i'm such a\nbullying me all the time\nit's like sometimes they do that because\nthey're [ __ ]\nsometimes they do that because you\naren't telling them not to\nand sometimes they respond if you tell\nthem not to when people feel awkward\nthey cope by making fun of you and then\nyou gotta like double down\nright don't fight but just call\nattention to it\npeople are asking about will smith and\nchris rock\nand that's where like if i if i was will\nsmith like i mean i don't know if i\nwould have done this i can't put myself\ninto shoes and i don't\nyou know\nwho knows what that guy is going through\nso like what stress he's dealing with\nand you know so i try not to judge\nbut this is the kind of thing where it's\nlike i think that's the kind of thing\nwhere like when you get your acceptance\nspeech or whatever\nyou know that's when you like call\nattention to it you can say look i know\nwe make a lot of jokes about things\ni personally think that like making\njokes about medical conditions is not\nokay\nand you say it in a tone like that\neveryone shuts the [ __ ] up and they take\nyou seriously\nright and like this is the problem is\nlike alopecia is an autoimmune disease\nwe live in a society where so much of\nour self-worth especially if you're a\nwoman is based on your appearance\nand i get that as comedians like we we\npoke\nfun at like things that are true right\nthat's part of the way that we deal with\nit but i don't think it's okay\nyou say something like that like that's\ngonna get traction too\nbut i think you'll move the needle in\nthe right direction\nbut that's just i mean i you know that's\narrogant of me to say because i don't\nreally know\nthis society i don't know these people i\ndon't know what they're going through so\ni'm not trying to pass judgment\nyou know so call attention to it\nright like point out what's going on"
