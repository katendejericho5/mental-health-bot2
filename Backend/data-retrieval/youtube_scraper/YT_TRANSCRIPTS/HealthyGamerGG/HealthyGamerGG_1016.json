do this study\narchitecture go to medical school it'll\ngive you a stable job do this it'll make\nyou happy but like how the hell do they\nknow like you don't even know how are\nthey supposed to know how is anyone\nsupposed to know\ni'm afraid to work towards the career i\nfeel is right for me\nhello healthy gamer community and thank\nyou for all who made this possible from\ndr k to all the mods i truly appreciate\nthis existing\nyou're welcome strong work mods stronger\ncommunity right so\num\nmy problem is the title suggests is\ncareer related i-25m have been\nstruggling lately to find motivation to\nwork towards my goals\ni have rediscovered through inner work\nthat my passion is storytelling which\nhas been the same during my childhood\nyears the mediums of storytelling that i\nenjoy the most are drawing music and\nspeaking rediscovered in the same way in\nthe last five years\nso it's pretty straightforward right\nstart telling stories with the help of\nthose mediums and in time success will\ncome\ni'm afraid to do it\nfor the past six years i've studied\narchitecture and i'm about to finish\ngetting my degree in a couple of months\nhopefully\ni'm behind with my project and feel\nenvious when i see my colleagues who are\ndoing a way better job\nsome of which seem passionate about\ntheir work\ni've enjoyed working in this field for\nshort amounts of time\nespecially when i was guided and helped\nby a kind teacher or friend\nbut overall i gave it a chance and it's\nnot going to work\nfor the long run\ni've worked in a couple of offices to\nunderstand what it's all about and i\ndon't want to do that for the rest of my\nlife\ni wanted a safety net to be able to work\nsomewhere nice if i don't succeed with\nmy passion but this makes me feel like\ni've wasted the last six years of life\nthis feeling was present from the third\nyear of university but now it has really\naccentuated\ni know it is my karma and i should\naccept it and from time to time i feel\nlike it was all necessary to get me to\nrealize what my passion is but it gets\ndifficult to feel that way anymore\nlast year i moved on my i moved on my\nown with the help of my parents and by\nmaking some money working in the offices\ni've mentioned i love it and i'm afraid\nof losing this by pursuing my passion\nthat's why i want to get hired into\narchitecture to make money to continue\nliving here\nat the same time i fear that by working\na full-time job in a field i'm not\npassionate about my energy will quickly\nbe drained and i will never be able to\nchange careers\ni've thought about animation art streams\ncharacters design and i've been doing\nsome work in those directions but it\nfeels tiring when i think about the\nfuture i'm afraid of losing more time\nwhat should i do next finish uni start\nworking and try to fit my passion in\nfinish uni but work only on my passion\nfor however long i can until i make\nmoney off of it i feel stuck\np.s thank you from the bottom of my\nheart for reading this i still have hope\nthat it will all work out in time but i\nhave no idea how and this lack of\nclarity is driving me crazy\nso this is a\nthis post really captures i think a\nreally common problem that people face\nright which is that like\nwe've got this idea of a career\nand then we've got this idea of a\npassion\nand we really struggle because like we\ninvest time in this career right because\nit provides safety it provides money it\nprovides a nice place to live and\nsort of a nice lifestyle right so maybe\nwe have to sacrifice a lot of our you\nknow we work heavily\nand then we have this thing that excites\nus and is our passion\nand what tends to happen is like a lot\nof times when we're kind of young in our\n20s\nwe kind of see this fork in the road and\nit's like should i choose my career or\nshould i choose my passion\nand we're really stuck because a lot of\ntimes at this point we've already\ninvested so much right so i've wasted\nsix years or i've spent six years of my\nlife studying architecture and if i quit\nit then that six years becomes a waste\nand so then we're kind of like at this\nfork in the road and what we're really\ntrying to do is like live a life without\nregrets we're like which choice\ncan i make\nthat i won't regret in the future\nright do i do i go the do i pursue my\npassion and if i pursue my passion i\nwork at it eventually hopefully i'll\nbecome successful is that the right move\nor\ndo i work on the passion on the side and\nkind of commit to my job and sort of\nenjoy my life is that the right move\nor\ndo i go down this road of like working\nand then realize that it's so exhausting\nbecause i'm not passionate about it and\nthen i don't have enough energy to work\non my passion so then i can't sort of\ntransition because some people will say\ntake the job and then work on your\npassion on the side as that grows then\nscale back on your job do more of your\npatching but whatever i don't have the\nenergy\nso it's like a lot of what ifs\nright and the cost of any of these\nchoices is really high because we've\nalready potentially wasted six years\nand so it's like really really common\nfor people to get into this situation\nand i think the big irony here is we'll\nkind of get into\nis it's that it's the fear of not making\na mistake that actually creates regret\nin your life\nit's super paradoxical but we try not to\nhave\nmake a mistake why because we don't want\nto live with regrets\nand the irony is that it's our avoidance\nof making mistakes that causes us to\nlive with regret\nright so i know it sounds kind of weird\nbut let's let's kind of tunnel down into\nthis okay\nfirst i want y'all to notice a couple of\nlike\ntemporal things\nso the other thing that i want to kind\nof point out this is sort of like an\ninterest it's a tangent but i don't know\nhow useful this is but a lot of times\nwe look at this problem in isolation but\nwhat i want y'all to notice is that when\nour mind\nreaches these points\nthere may be particular factors that are\ncontributing to this\nand we think we're making a cosmic\nchoice\nshould i follow my passion or should i\nstick with my job\nbut there are a lot of temporary factors\nwhich are making us like reach this\ncrisis so the first\nis that as we kind of point out like i'm\nbehind with my project and feel envious\nwhen i see my work my colleagues who are\ndoing way better at my job some of which\nseem passionate about their work\nso what influence do you think this\nstate of mind\nhas on this person\nright it brings this crisis to the\nsurface\nif they were doing a way better job or\nif their colleagues were doing way worse\nthey may actually be way more content\ni've enjoyed working in in the field for\nshort amount of time especially when i\nwas guided and helped by a kind teacher\nor friend\nright so they've also found things that\nmake them enjoy the field but it sounds\nlike that's not really present right now\nso we think about these problems as like\nthey're cosmic in nature right like\nshould i pick my passion or should i\npick my career but the truth of the\nmatter is that the nature of our\ncontentment\nwith our career versus passion problem\nhas temporary influences that will like\ncause this crisis to come to the surface\nand part of our solution maybe in\ndealing with these two things right does\nthat kind of make sense like\nif we learn how to better not be\nintimidated by our colleagues or like\nfeel envious of their work if we do some\nof that internal work it may create some\ndegree of more satisfaction\nas the satisfaction of our career goes\nup\nthe\nchoice between passion and career\nbecomes a little bit less important\nright because now i'm enjoying myself at\nwork i'm doing a good job i'm getting\npositive praise i'm making money so it's\nlike not that big of a deal\ncultivating the right kind of\nmicroscopic environment at work is also\nreally really good\nso maybe this person would be a lot\nhappier with architecture if they found\nthe right place where the work was\ncollaborative where they had mentorship\nand they could kind of enjoy it more you\nknow there's all kinds of like different\nyou know things going on\nso my point is that sometimes when\npeople ask these questions like they ask\nin such a general way\nshould i pick my career or should i pick\nmy passion but what i want you all to\nappreciate is that there are individual\ncircumstances that kind of contribute to\nthis question being asked at this point\nso the first thing that i'd say if\nyou're struggling with this is why are\nyou asking this now\nright what's making this an important\nquestion why do you have to answer it\nnow and this is where the the\ninstinctual response will be well now\ni'm at a transition point i've invested\nsix years i need to know now whether i\nwant to commit to this field or not well\nyou could have like\nmade that choice at five years of study\nyou could made that choice at four years\nof study you could have made that choice\nat three years of study\nso there's always this sense that we\nneed to make this big commitment now\nand that sort of comes back to this idea\nof like we don't want to live our life\nwithout\nwith with regrets right we don't want to\nmake a mistake\nso let's talk about that for a second\nso\nwe have this idea i don't know like\nwhere this exactly comes from\nthat\nthe way to be successful is to like\nchoose our passion right and like we\nhave this sort of mythologized kind of\nidea that some people like make their\npassion work and that's what i have to\nkind of do\nand then we sort of have this idea that\nlike if i really like look at this\nquestion what i really see is like a\nfear of regret so what i'm hearing in\nthis person's mind what's if we kind of\ngo back to this for a second\nwhat i'm kind of hearing here is that\nyou know\ni have no idea how and this lack of\nclarity is driving me crazy right so\nwhat drives people crazy it's like not\nknowing what to do\nand then that begs the question it's\nkind of a weird question that very few\npeople ask is why do you have to know\nwhat to do\nright well that way i don't make\nmistakes\nokay\nso like what's your understanding of\nlike how you develop a career how you\ndevelop a path like how does this stuff\nwork\nbecause in my experience\nit's not like this straight road we have\nthis idea that like you you know you you\nfind something like you discover your\npassion you like decide so i see this a\nlot you know\nbeing faculty in in the field of\nmedicine right so that's and so we see a\nlot of tryhard pre-med kids like they're\nlike 14 years old and they're like yeah\ni'm gonna be a doctor when i grow up and\nthey like lock that in\nright it's like are you sure the final\nanswer and then the pre-meds are like\nyes they're not even in college yet they\nstart telling people i'm going to be a\ndoctor then they pick their major right\nlocking it in further then they go to\nmedical school locking in further i'm\ngoing to be a surgeon locking it in\nfurther\nand then you see like this then you're\n28 years old\nokay\nand like you go to a party\nand then you meet one of these kids and\nthey're like yeah i'm training to be a\nsurgeon\ni pulled bullets out of people this past\nweekend it was wild\nand you're like\ni'm still trying to figure out if i want\nto do architecture or storytelling and\nso we get this idea that you like board\nthis train\nand like the train goes straight but the\ntruth is that life is like it's the\nscenic route there's all kinds of twists\nand turns\nsix years to figure out that you don't\nlike architecture is not a waste that's\nthe price of tuition right it's the\nprice of knowledge like this is the\nother mind-blowing thing right so this\nperson is saying okay should i pick\nstorytelling or should i pick\narchitecture i don't know which one is\nthe right choice\nand what is the right choice it's the\none that you're not going to regret it's\nthe one that you're going to be happy\nabout but how on earth\ndo you know what you're going to be\nhappy with like think about that for a\nsecond\nlet's say you pick storytelling and\nnothing works out after two or three\nyears like then what then you're gonna\nhave a regret\nlet's say you pick architecture you're\nlike yeah like i i like you know i like\nthe apartment like i'm gonna pick this\nand then in the back of your mind you're\ngonna be like oh i should have picked\nstorytelling i should have then you're\ngonna have regret\nbecause you don't know you can't see the\nfuture so if you can't see the future\nyou can't make the right\nchoice and so then the question is like\nthen how do i choose if i can't make the\nright choice\nthat's when paradoxically you can be\nfree\nso what i'd recommend to this person and\nbecause then you kind of\nis recognize that like wasted time is\nthe price of figuring it out like how do\nyou how are you supposed to know at the\nbeginning of life what's going to make\nyou happy you can't know that right like\npeople can tell you your parents will\ntell you oh do this study architecture\ngo to medical school it'll give you a\nstable job do this it'll make you happy\nbut like how the hell do they know like\nyou don't even know how are they\nsupposed to know how is anyone supposed\nto know\nfiguring out what makes you happy in\nlife is like something you gotta figure\nout it requires experimentation\nand this is where this romantic notion\nof we board the train we know exactly\nwhat we do we focus on our passion\nmalcolm gladwell ten thousand hours\ndedicated practice\nthen i'll be happy i'll be successful\nand i'll have done it\nright because that's what the media sort\nof portrays like\nwe don't see all these people who are\nsort of living in like we don't see all\nthe like the accountants who are playing\ncones of densher\non the weekends right we don't see those\npeople\nall we see is like all these people like\nbill gates and elon musk and like that\nwe like think that this or all these\npeople on youtube who are driving fancy\ncars and wearing diamonds and talking\nabout the hustle and the grind and like\nyou got to do this you like so like\nwe're getting all this information but i\ndon't know if you guys get this like\nmost people don't live their life like\nthat right\ngo outside of your house\nwalk around for a little while and just\nsee the people there\nsee who walks by most people are not\nlike that\nso we're basing our lives after after a\ntiny fraction\nof\nlike people in the world\nand then we get really confused when\nlike that doesn't work for us\nbecause that's not what works for most\npeople\nso how do you choose the first thing\nyou've got to do is recognize that you\ncould be making a mistake\nthat you can't blame you for like not\nmaking a mistake it's sort of like if i\ngo to a foreign country\nand someone gives me like two pieces of\nfood and i have no idea what they are\nlike if i try one am i gonna like it or\nnot like it i have no idea there's no\nway to know which one i'm gonna like so\nwhat should i do i should just try one\nthey're like pick one you get to eat one\nand it's like how the hell am i supposed\nto choose like you\nthere's nothing you can base it on\nso recognize first of all that the fear\nof making a mistake in life is actually\nwhat's going to cause you to feel regret\nbecause what's going to happen is you're\nafraid of making the wrong choice and\nyou're going to end up picking something\nand then something is going to happen\nand like maybe it's the wrong choice\nthen your mind is going to be like oh i\nshould have picked the other thing\nso from the get go recognize that you're\nkind of you could be making the wrong\nchoice\nparadoxically this will actually help\nyou\nso what i would recommend for this\nperson i think this is generally\nspeaking the safer choice right if\nyou've invested six years in\narchitecture and you're enjoying your\nlife some right now i would say follow\nthrough with it right you don't want to\nthrow away that six years so easily i'm\nnot saying that you don't want to throw\nit away i'm saying that you should throw\nit away intentionally when you're 100\nready\nand how do you know when you're 100\nready\nwell when you've done it for a while and\nlike you really realize okay this is not\nwhat i want to do that's when you're\nready to throw it away so i'll give you\nall kind of an example so in a sense\ni've sort of done this myself but\nyou know like when i talk to people who\nmake career changes\nwhat tends to happen is you have one\ncareer\nand then in a sense that career becomes\nso intolerable\nthat you have no choice but to quit\nand the really interesting thing is when\nyou reach that point there's no regret\nthere's like zero regret there's like\nokay i tried this i really gave it every\neffort possible\nand it's really not working for me i\ncan't stand it anymore time to let it go\nand they may say oh i've wasted time and\nstuff like that you kind of talked to\nthem about that you worked through some\nof that stuff but at the end of the day\nlike\nlet experience be your guide you can't\npredict the future so what you need to\nmake a good decision is experience\nso if you all are on the cusp of like\nstorytelling versus architecture or\nchoosing between your passion\nand sort of the safe bet i'd say take\nthe safe bet for now\nas you take the safe bet notice what\nhappens to your passion of storytelling\nso does your unhappiness increase with\neach passing day that's a very very\nimportant data point we try to avoid\nunhappiness but what we don't realize is\nunhappiness is going to be our compass\nwhen we try to avoid unhappiness we\ndon't have enough data and then we don't\nknow which what thing to choose\nthe interesting thing is it's through\nthe unhappiness that we know what feels\nright and what feels\nwrong so i i once had a patient and this\nis kind of chimerical so when i talk\nabout patients i kind of like take\npieces of each one and assemble them\ninto a non-real person okay\nso i once had a patient who was\ndating\ntwo people\nthey're not really dating two people\nthey're dating one person things fell\napart\nand they were trying to figure out\nshould i try to patch things together or\nnot\nthey dated someone else who on paper was\na lot better for them\nand so they were like really struggling\nand so they came to me and they said\nwell like i've got a problem in my\nrelationship and i was like what's your\nproblem they're like well i just really\ndon't enjoy the sex at all\nand they were like with that last person\nthe sex was amazing but like with this\nperson it's just really not i just i\ndon't know like is something wrong with\nme like do i need to you know do i have\nlike a problem\nso we kind of talked about it for a\nlittle while\nand sort of like came to the conclusion\nthat like you know kind of the body\nknows what it wants they ended up\nchoosing\nneither of these people\nironically but\nso that's the other kind of key takeaway\nto remember is that a lot of times in\nlife we think that choices are binary\nright whereas like\nlife is interesting it's an open world\ngame it's a sandbox game you don't have\nto choose\neither one right you could actually\nthere's like choice number c there's\nnone of the above you can select that as\na choice\num but i think the key thing here is\nthat like you can use so so you know\nthis person was right on paper\nbut like they just weren't feeling it\nright like they're like oh this person\nis like stable they're not abusive\nyou know like they treat me with respect\nthey care about me they like get me like\nnice things for my birthday and stuff\nlike that they're like attentive and\nthoughtful\nbut i'm just not into them\nright that was kind of the conclusion\nthat the person came to and then they\nwere able to leave the relationship with\nlike no regrets right because but that\nif they'd left too early then they would\nhave had a regret because they would\nhave never known\nbut they gave it a fair shot and then\nthey let their experience they let their\nunhappiness they let their\ndissatisfaction guide them\ni've seen this in career changes too\nwhere it's like oh should i quit should\ni leave my firm i'm getting paid so much\nand so it's like okay stay at your firm\nfor a while you're getting paid so much\nso just like make that money\nenjoy the fruits of your labor and then\nyou'll see\nright because as days go by they're like\ngetting the money they're getting the\nmoney they're getting the money and\nthey're like i'm really unhappy here\nokay great let's talk about leaving\nthe key thing to remember though is that\nwhat makes that decision easy\nwhat makes that decision free of regret\nwhat really guides you is that\nexperience\nand it's the avoidance of that\nexperience\nwe're dropping\nokay\nwe're back okay saved\nit's so what i was kind of saying is\nthat it's\nso if you're kind of making money in\nyour job and you're like i don't know if\nthis is fulfilling enough i enjoy this\nthing you know my passion is better um 2\nfps\nhold on a second\nsaved not in sync we're good\ngood good good\nokay we're back\nso i'll i'll kind of pick it up from\nwhat i was saying earlier so when we're\nfacing in a situation where we like we\nhave a job where we're making money\nand then we're wondering like okay is\nthis the right move or the wrong move so\nlike you make that money for a while\nlike you do the job you don't enjoy it\nperfectly\nand then you see what happens can you\nmanage this is this good for you can you\ntolerate it\nor what's going to happen is your your\nunhappiness is going to increase\nincrease increase increase\nand as your unhappiness increases then\nthe decision will become clear to you\nand then you won't be confused you won't\nbe faced with this kind of thing\ni have no idea the lack of clarity is\ndriving me crazy so what's going to be\nwhat's going to fix the lack of clarity\nwhat's going to help you decide is your\nexperience\nand then you're gonna leave without\nregrets\nright you're like this is absolutely not\nthe right thing for me\ni need to move on\nand then you may think well\nwouldn't it have been better if you had\nleft a year ago and that's where like i\ndon't really think so\nbecause what i then tend to see is that\nwhen you leave\nwith that degree of certainty when you\nleave with that degree of confidence it\nlaunches you into the new thing with an\nunbelievable amount of passion and\nmotivation\nyou have so much appreciation for the\nthing that you choose and if you try to\nchoose now what you're going to have is\ndoubt and the possibility of regret\nbecause you'll never know\nright like you're never gonna know and\nthen like you're gonna be stuck and\nyou're like oh did i make the wrong\nchoice did i make the wrong choice so go\nto the end of one road\ngo all the way to the end of it or until\nyou realize this is not where i want to\ngo and then walk back and take the other\none\npractically what i'd suggest is that if\nyou've invested a heavy amount of time\nyou think a little bit about some of the\ntemporal circumstances\nthat are making this really relevant to\nyou right now\nand you like really think about trying\nto address those because if you choose\nto stay then like addressing those is\ngonna be really important for your\noverall happiness\nthe other thing is that don't worry\nabout regrets\nrecognize that it's a coin flip whatever\nyou do could be the wrong choice and\nthat's okay that's life that's how you\nfigure out what you want to do\nright my career has been all over the\nplace it was failing out of college for\na while being pre-med\nright but being like genetically pre-med\nor culturally pre-med going to india\nwanting to be a monk\ndeciding to go back to deciding back to\ngo to medical school\ni mean i didn't go back to medical\nschool and never got accepted in the\nfirst place but deciding that okay i\nactually did want to be a doctor for my\nown reasons\ngoing to medical school becoming a\npsychiatrist\noriginally wanting to be an oncologist\ndoing complementing alternative medicine\nand oncology taking another career\nchange into psychiatry\nhaving my parents and family be like\nit's gonna drive you crazy don't do that\nright so like\nthey were really really confused\nthey're like even my mentors were like\nsmart doctors don't become psychiatrists\nyou'd be wasted in psychiatry you can\nget into such a more competitive field\nthat you can make more money in\nwhy would you do go be cardiologists\nright i still remember being on my\nvascular surgery rotation\nand having one of the attending doctors\ntelling me that your mind is wasted in\npsychiatry\nright\nand it's like it's a\ngood thing to be praised by people and\nbe well respected but you know\nand then i became a psychiatrist and now\ni'm streaming on twitch\nit's like\ni wasted so much time there\nright i could have just i could 22 i\ncould have started streaming on twitch\nlike 16 years ago when it was just in tv\nand been such a huge streamer today\nbut that's not how it works\nright like and this is the other thing\nthat i think people underemphasize they\nthink that this six years is wasted\nwhereas in my experience\noverwhelming experience\nit's not wasted at all\nyou will be amazed at what you learned\nin those six years that will help you\nwith storytelling so even if you're an\narchitect\ndoing something that you don't love for\nsix years and doing a decent job\nthe ability to develop a work ethic in\nthe absence of motivation and passion\nis absolutely worth a six year\ninvestment because when you move to\nstorytelling whether you succeed as a\nstoryteller or not you can't base it on\nyour passion you can't base it on your\ninterest you're not going to be\nsuccessful that way\nyou need that work ethic\nright you even need hey i'm choosing\nstorytelling after seven years of\nspending time on architecture i really\ngotta make it work because i've given up\na lot to choose this that kind of\nmotivation that kind of passion that\nkind of sacrifice will let you double\ndown and do so much better i felt that\nin medical school i tried so damn hard\nto get into medical school got rejected\nfrom 120 medical schools\none\nsome medical schools rejected me\nmultiple times 120 medical school\nrejections\nand then when i got in it's like ain't\nno one gonna it up this time\nthere's no way that i'm letting this\nopportunity slip through my fingers\nand i didn't realize the value of what i\nhad been given\nuntil i had to make a real sacrifice to\nget it\nand that's why i did well in medical\nschool because i was like you know\neveryone else was like i mean not\neveryone but\na lot of people were like you know these\nlike straight a kids\nand then like you know but i was like\nthis is my last chance at life it's like\nyou know we're down to our final respawn\nand after this we have to start the game\nover like i ain't giving this up\nthat tenacity that you get that leads to\nsuccess what people don't realize is\nthat comes from walking the road of\nfailure it comes from making mistakes it\ncomes from living a life of no like no\nregrets 100 in\nand then people like how do i find that\nyou make a mistake\nyou choose something you see what makes\nyou unhappy and then you're like f that\ni'm done\nso the problem here is that everyone\nwants that passion but they don't want\nto pay the price for it so pay the price\nmake a mistake pick\nin this sense i'd say pick architecture\nright because it's like financial stuff\nlike financial stability is really\nimportant\nand i'd kind of say like do that that\nthird route where like you know you work\non your architecture you try to work on\nyour storytelling in your as a side\nhustle\nright you give that a shot and then one\nof two things will become clear to you\none is that you're actually doing okay\nright so one one i mean a lot of other\nthings could happen one route is that\nyou start to get better start to get\nbetter start to get better you really\nrealize okay this is what i want to do\nlet me abandon architecture\nor what's going to happen is you're\ngoing to find okay like i don't have the\nenergy for it i can't do this and\narchitecture at the same time months go\nby you want to work on storytelling you\nwant to work on storytelling you want to\nwork on storytelling not happening not\nhappening not happening and not\nhappening and then you get frustrated\nwith it you're like i have to choose\nright so bill gates dropped out of\nharvard college right\nbut he\nwent he didn't choose not to go\nhe waited until something was really\nimportant to him and worth the dropping\nout so if you're trying to decide like\nshould i drop out of this or not like\ni would say wait until something is\nworth it\nbecause then you know like like because\nthe interesting thing is that the size\nof the sacrifice you make\ncognitively\nboosts your motivation by a comparable\namount\nand we've seen this like in a lot of\ninteresting places\nright so like when when we have really\nreally strong like helicopter parents\nthat live vicariously through their kids\nthat tenacity of wanting my kid to be\nnumber one is directly correlated to\ntheir perception of what they had to\ngive up\nright i'm going to make sure my child is\nthe best in the universe because i got\npregnant and had to drop out of college\nso in order to make that worth it that\ntenacity\nwith being a helicopter parent is\nthrough the roof is that bad for the kid\nsure but let's think a little bit about\nscientifically where that tenacity comes\nfrom where does that motivation come\nfrom it comes from the sacrifice\nright so motivation can come from\nsacrifice 100\nso if you want to find it like you got\nto pay the price\nyou have to pay the blood price\nhave to got to pay that karmic price\ncall it whatever you want to\nand don't be afraid\nmistakes are a part of life that's how\nwe know\nwhat to do\nright so here we are ahead of time\ntrying to figure everything out\nwhich food\nshould i eat for the rest of my life\ni've never tried anything how do i know\nshould i pick if you get to pick one\ncuisine for the rest of your life should\nit be mexican should it be japanese\nshould it be indian should it be\namerican i don't know how to pick so try\neverything\nand there we are thinking oh my god i\nchose to eat sushi today i missed out on\nthe burger it's like okay you can have a\nburger tomorrow but then i did i'd eat\nburgers two days in a row i could have\neaten burgers two days in a row\ni could have had yeah so like you missed\nout on the enjoyment that's part of it\nyou got to p pay the price of tuition to\nfigure out what you want to do in life\nif you're stuck between two things\nbe prepared to make a mistake\nand then as you choose one thing\nrecognize\nthat over time your soul will tell you\nwhether this is the right move or not\nand as that uncertainty increases i'm\nsorry not uncertainty is that um\ndiscomfort increases that\ndissatisfaction increases you'll know\nthat's your compass\nand then you'll move forward with a lot\nof energy\ni see everyone's caught up with the food\nfor the rest of your life\nright and that's the other thing\nwhere do we get the idea for the rest of\nyour life\nright like oh i don't want to do this\nfor the rest okay so like you don't have\nto do it for the rest of your life\nyou can be your architect for like two\nor three years make some money say make\nsome savings and then quit\nright but that's when people say but i\nspent six years on the education sure so\nthere's an opportunity cost so maybe you\ndo it five years maybe you do it six\nyears\nbut you you don't have to do anything\nfor the rest of your life that's how\npeople feel in their 20s they're like i\nhave to do this for the rest of my life\ntrust me as someone who's near in 40 has\nhad a lot of different career changes\nand a lot of failed career attempts you\ndon't have to do anything for the rest\nof your life\nyou"
