    "transcript": "so the interesting thing that happens\nwith people with depression is that a\nlot of them will learn to adapt cope and\nsurvive because they're resilient\nbecause they're strong because they're\nadaptable because they're\nintelligent you think that the best you\ncan do is cope because and that's not\nfoolish for you to think right because\nthat's what's worked for you\nmaybe you've tried treatment\nright but ssris don't just magically fix\nall the depression and sometimes the\nreason we believe in coping instead of\nfixing is because we've tried to fix it\nbefore and it hasn't worked and the best\nwe've come up with is coping so it makes\nperfect sense that people come to that\nconclusion but with how conserved\ndepression is across the human race and\nby conservative i mean by how prevalent\nand consistent it is across the human\nrace\nthe fact that after we get yelled at we\nfeel like crying and going you know and\nsitting in a corner for a little while\nor a long while\nthat's a conserved experience across\nhumanity\n[Music]\nokay let's do tick-tocks\nhow often do you still battle with\ndepression oh i'm always depressed all\nthe time um i have to constantly bring\nmyself out of it like i wake up\ndepressed but like i'm like okay now i\nknow my steps because i you learn from\nreal like now i have to go outside and\nbe in the sun for a little bit or go for\na walk or like start the day this way\nit's all just programming yourself to\ntrick your brain\nyou know well you have a suicidal yeah\nall the time but i can't because i got a\nmom and a sister and like a family yeah\nso i think this is\nunfortunate but it's like a really\ncommon experience right\nso a lot of people struggle with\ndepression\nand\nif you pay attention to the question\nit's like how often do you battle with\ndepression\nso depression feels like a war right\nlike where you're going into battle with\nit every day it's like you wake up in\nthe morning and like it's there\nright\nit's almost like a daily quest\nthat you have to do like day after day\nafter day after day\nand over time what happens is people\nlearn how to adapt to it\nright\nso like\nyou know\npeople learn how to adapt and they're\nlike you figure out like over time like\nhow to how to deal with it\nso you go outside\nget some sunlight that's good\nright so this is sort of notes in on\npeople think about depression as\nprimarily a mental illness but i think\nthe more i've come to understand i think\nthis is actually a shortcoming in our\nfield\nis that it's a physical illness too so\nwe know that\nvitamin d levels for example sun\nexposure\num\nb12 folate thyroid levels\nall of these physiologic things will\ninfluence your depression\nand so we develop coping strategies to\ndeal with it\nright and then the person asks him are\nyou suicidal he's like yeah like all the\ntime\nand then we also hear about protective\nfactors that's how we deal with it\nright so even if you pay attention what\nyou're going to hear\nis that\nthe way he fights the suicidality is by\nthinking about the people in his life\nbut what i'm not hearing from this\nsituation is that this is ever gonna get\nbetter\nand i've seen this a lot especially in\nlike actors and performers\nartists\nwhere they sort of live with it day in\nand day out and it's like a constant war\nand constant struggle it can happen to\nreal people too\nwhereas the one thing that i'd say is\nthat i you know i don't i mean sometimes\nit really is that chronic for people but\nin my experience as a psychiatrist like\n90 of people or 95 of people don't\nhave to do it that way\ni know it sounds kind of weird but\nso this is where when we think a little\nbit about depression i'm not saying that\nthat you know\ni'm not judging pete for experiencing\nwhat he experiences but i think what\nhappens when we have depression is as\nhuman beings we learn how to adapt and\nwe learn how to cope\nand once we learn how to adapt and cope\nwe stop trying to fix the problem or\nthat's because we think it's unfixable\nwhich in turn could be the depression\nitself\nright so i want you all to think a\nlittle bit about this like if you've got\na problem in your house\nand you like\nmanage a fix\nright\nso let's say that i have to like\nrearrange furniture\nso that i can plug my computer into a\nwall\nbut if i get an extension cord and i run\nit along\nthe the bottom of the floor to the next\nroom and i don't have to move my\ncomputer what's going to happen i'm\nnever going to move my computer the\nextension cord is going to be there it's\ngoing to be a pain in the ass my\nyou know my computer is going to look\ndisorganized and i'm never going to fix\nit\nso the interesting thing that happens\nwith people with depression is that a\nlot of them will learn to adapt cope and\nsurvive because they're resilient\nbecause they're strong because they're\nadaptable because they're\nintelligent\nand once you learn how to cope\nit goes on the back burner\nand in the worst cases\nyou think\nand for some people this may be right\ni'm not saying that they're wrong but i\nthink thankfully it doesn't seem to be\ntrue in most cases\nyou think that the best you can do is\ncope because and that's not foolish for\nyou to think right because that's what's\nworked for you\nmaybe you've tried treatment\nright but ssris don't just magically fix\nall the depression\nit's not just a neurochemical imbalance\nsometimes it requires really deep hard\nwork that people don't have the\nbandwidth for\nthat people don't believe in\nand the reason they don't believe in it\nis because they've tried it before\nthey've tried versions of it they've\ntried everything and this is what works\nfor them right so you have to respect\nthat\nbut i think it's it's a really dangerous\nthing to think about depression as\nsomething that can only be coped with\nso i do think it can substantially get\nbetter and there's good data to suggest\nthis right\nso interestingly enough the best the\nmost um\npromising data i think is in a sense the\nweakest\nwhich is some of this data on\npsychedelic so i'm not saying you guys\nshould do psychedelics but if you look\nat the outcomes from these studies of\npsychedelic assisted psychotherapy it\nlooks like it makes fundamental changes\nwithin someone's mind and their way of\nthinking about themselves there's a\nwhole video about this in in terms of\nthe default mode network and dr k's\nguide to depression but there's also\nwhere we see with meditation\nis that like there are fundamental\nchanges that happen sometimes in\npsychotherapy there are fundamental\nchanges that happen\nwith the way that we look at things like\nwith what we wake up with in the morning\nso struggling with depression is a\nreally really common problem\num you know i think a lot of celebrities\nand performers and creators\nstruggle with it\nand i think that since they're smart\nsince they're adaptive since they're\nresilient\nsince they have endurance\nthey develop certain coping strategies\nand it's really important to do those\nthings it's really important to figure\nout organize your day figure out what\nworks for you\nthe challenge\nis that i think unfortunately for the\nmajority of people because every person\ni've ever met with depression has a\nhundred percent developed a way to deal\nwith it\nevery single person\nthe interesting thing is that 90 to 95\npercent of those people that i've worked\nwith\ndon't have to use those things after\nabout a year of treatment\nso i think things can permanently get\nbetter i really do believe that it's\nbeen my experience\nnow if you're someone who's tried\ntreatment and it hasn't worked i'm not\nsaying that it works for everyone that's\nthe really sad thing so we haven't\nfigured out how to guarantee that for\npeople\nbut i think the challenge is is just\nlike the you know the extension cord\nexample is once we learn how to cope\nit's a really important skill it's what\nallows us to survive it's different from\nfixing it\nand sometimes the reason we believe in\ncoping instead of fixing is because\nwe've tried to fix it before and it\nhasn't worked and the best we've come up\nwith is coping so it makes perfect sense\nthat people come to that conclusion\nbut if you're in that kind of situation\nwhere this resonates with you and the\nmost you can do is sort of survive it\ni would say don't stop there\nright try to do additional things really\ntry to get to the root of your\ndepression so sure you can go into the\nsun and that's an excellent thing\nmovement is good behavioral activation\nis an evidence-based treatment for\ndepression vitamin d supplementation can\nhelp people with depression we have good\ndata behind all that so it's fantastic\nexcellent idea\nand don't stop there\nright start to think a little bit about\nif you're suicidal like why are you\nsuicidal\nwhat is it that makes life hard\nright get to the like you want to use\nyour coping strategies at the top but\nyou also want to go deeper and get to\nthe root of it if you can\nand some people get to the root of it\nand there's nothing you can do\nthat's unfortunate but i think\nthankfully that's the minority of people\nand depression is\nyour body saying\n[ __ ] you\ni don't want to be this character\nanymore\ni don't want to hold up this this avatar\nthat you've created in the world it's\ntoo much for me you should think of the\nword as depressed as deep rest\ndeep rest your body needs to be\ndepressed it needs deep rest from the\ncharacter that you've been trying to\nplay yes that's like very well said so i\nthink sometimes we tend to forget\nright that\ndepression is like a variant within\nthe human population\nokay this is something that you'll\nreally have to understand\nit happens to us\narguably for a reason now this is what\ngets really interesting about mental\nhealth\nis\nwhen we think about pathology\nwe think about it as a malfunction\nof\nsomething right so when someone is sick\ntheir body is not working the way that\nit's supposed to\nbut with how conserved depression is\nacross the human race and by conserved i\nmean by how prevalent and consistent it\nis across the human race\nthe fact that after we get yelled at we\nfeel like crying and going you know and\nsitting in a corner for a little while\nor a long while\nthat's a conserved experience across\nhumanity\nand so sometimes i think we forget i\nknow it sounds kind of weird that\naspects of depression\ncan actually be like adaptive\notherwise it wouldn't be there\nright we wouldn't feel sad and ashamed\nof ourselves if we get yelled at unless\nit serves some kind of function\nnow i'm not saying that things don't\nrise to a pathological level\nat times but this is my experience as a\npsychiatrist is that\nsometimes when people come into my\noffice and they're depressed it's not\ntheir brain functioning wrong\nit's their brain functioning right\nand i know it sounds kind of weird but\nlike\nif someone comes into my office and says\ni have no reason to live i live alone i\ndon't enjoy anything\ni have no relationships\ni have\nno job i'm ashamed of myself i've never\namounted to anything in life\nand the interesting thing is that like\nthose statements could be true like\nsometimes there are cognitive\ndistortions there are usually some\ncognitive distortions\nbut sometimes those things are true and\nso the answer for that person is here\ntake a pill go home that's not the\nanswer\nthe answer is like okay if you have no\nreason to live like let's work on that\nright the way to help that person's\ndepression is it's not it's not their\nbrain malfunctioning there may be some\nkind of malfunction in there\nbut that's their brain sort of telling\nthem that this life is not worth living\nwhich sometimes people say like oh that\nmeans i should kill myself that's the\nconclusion people come to i disagree\nwith that 100 don't kill yourself build\na life that's worth living\nthat's when people say it's hard\nand it's like yeah i know it is that's\nwhy i'm going to help you\nyou don't have to do it alone\nright so it's interesting to hear jim\ncarrey talk about deep rest\nit's interesting so this is the\nexperience like this is what what\nhappens when people really like\nunderstand their depression and they\nhave an experience of it and they start\nto realize that sometimes my body needs\nthis\nsometimes my body needs this\nand i think it's especially common for\npeople who as he put it\nhold up an avatar right we pretend to be\nthis thing\nfor so long that we get tired and i just\ncan't pretend anymore\nso i'm going to retreat\ninto a hibernating state\nand then i'm going to muster up the\nenergy to come out and pretend to be\nthis thing again\nnot too you know if that works for you i\nmean the guy's older than i am and he's\ni don't know i don't know anything about\nhow long he's been dealing with this\nstuff or where he gets this wisdom from\nit sounds really authentic to me\nsounds like he knows what he's talking\nabout\nand\ni think there are other ways to do it\nright so my experience of people who do\nthis who go into the deep rest version\nof depression\nis how can you build\nhow can you stop pretending\nbecause if that's what's exhausting\nhow can you be more authentic\nbecause it's exhausting it is so hard to\nbe something that you're not\nyou have to work so hard to prop up this\nidea of yourself\ninstead be yourself\nbut that's hard don't get me wrong it's\nvery very hard it's very hard to be\nauthentic right\nit's hard to stand up to people it's\nhard to set boundaries it's hard to be\nyourself it's hard to be judged\nso hard to be judged\ni'm not saying it's easy happens slowly\nbut ultimately like i've seen that too\nwhere people once they start living more\nauthentic lives they will become less\ndepressed\nbecause you don't need to act anymore\nyou don't need that deep rest you don't\nrun out of mana your gas tank is not\nempty\nnow some people may say like that's you\nknow that's impossible or you're saying\nit's making it sound easy i'm not saying\nit's easy leaving an authentic life is\none of the hardest things that you'll\never do\nbut boy is it worth it\ni've seen that in patients i've worked\nwith in terms of like living authentic\nlives right so\nwe're talking a lot about work stuff\ntoday so i go to work every day i have\nto pretend to be interested in the scrap\ni hate it i hate it i hate my job\ni hate everything about it\nbut i can't quit i can't throw it all\naway what would i do i'd give up money i\nwould have this this yeah you have to be\nmore authentic yeah there are gonna be\nsacrifices but it's gonna be worth it\nalmost every single time let me think\nabout that for a second\ni can't really think of a single person\ni'm trying to think i'm going through\nlike\npatients that i've worked with i'm\ntrying to think if there's a single\npatient i've worked with who's really\nlived a really authentic life and has\nnot been depressed\nor it's not improved their depression i\ncan't really think of anyone doesn't\nmean it hasn't happened i just can't\nthink of them\nit could be selection bias\nright memory isn't perfect\nso the couple of takeaways i think the\nfirst is that sometimes it's okay to be\ndepressed\nsometimes if you're you know\nit's hard to put on a mask every day and\nlike sometimes the way that your body\ncopes with that your brain copes with\nthat is to retreat from the world and\nthat's okay\nand i'm hopeful\nthat that cycle\ncan get better\nby living more authentically\nright if the problem is that you're\ntired of\nlifting up this avatar of yourself don't\nlift it anymore\nright that rejuvenates you when you set\nit down and you retreat the question is\ncan you separate the setting down from\nthe retreating\nbecause what is it that really\nrejuvenates you\nis it the setting down or is it the\nretreating\nthat begs the question why do you have\nto retreat when you set it down what\nwould happen if you set it down and you\ndidn't retreat\n[Music]\nyeah so i think there's you know some\nvalue to this right\nbut i think this is also one of the\nproblems\nwhen it comes to discussions on\ndepression\nright so we've got like\ni mean\nthis video is good because it speaks to\nsome of the problems one is that a lot\nof times doctors will say take this pill\nto fix your neurochemical imbalance\nand that's a part of the\nanswer i think it's a problem when it\nbecomes the whole of the answer but\nsometimes you're not going to understand\nthis unless you actually prescribe\nantidepressant medication but\nonce you prescribe antidepressant or\nyou're someone for whom has a really\ngood positive effect but there are some\npeople who i will prescribe\nantidepressant medication they will like\nturn into normal human beings\nso i'd say for a third of people\nantidepressant medication can be\nrevolutionary and life-changing\nbut i'd say about 70 of people it like\neither helps some or doesn't help much\nlike a third of people get a really\nstrong response a third of people get\nlike some response but is nowhere near\nenough and a third of people it really\ndoesn't do much\nso then some people\nwho have depression will sort of like\nthen we also know on the flip side that\nstuff like sunshine and exercise and\nthings like that have protective effects\nagainst depression that's true as well\ni mean we heard pete davidson kind of\nsay it right getting out getting in the\nsun we also know that vitamin d levels\nfor example are very correlated with\ndepression we know that exercise\nimproves depression\nwe know that\nyeah all kinds of mechanisms so exercise\ngetting out in the sun will reduce in\nfrom inflammation will reduce cortisol\nlevels all of those things will have\npositive effects on mood\nright so those mechanisms are there\nso on the one hand we've got ssris that\nmay not work for people on the other\nhand we've got exercise and sunshine and\nthese kinds of things\nthat you're overdosing on\nright we're also overdosing on like\nwe're not just\ngoing outside suddenly we've taken off\nour shirt\nand we're showing our six-pack for\nunclear reasons\ni don't know what that has to do with\nanything\nright except maybe gratification of the\nego\nand then we sort of also get to some\nreally interesting things if we really\nwant to get into this\nwhich is that first of all not all\ndepression is the same so this is what i\nthink really frustrates me sometimes is\nwhen people make videos like this\nthey assume that their experience of\ndepression\nencompasses the variance of experiences\nof depression\nand this is where like i gotta say as a\nmedical professional like sunshine and\nexercise are fantastic i recommend it to\nall my patients\nbut some people have more of a biologic\nor organic cause for whom sunshine and\nexercise is not sufficient\nand to imply that\nthose things will work for everyone i\nthink is like\nirresponsible\nright and that's where especially if we\nlook at\ndifferent\nso clinical depression the experience of\nlike sadness and depression has a\ndifferential diagnosis to it right we\ndon't usually talk about this kind of\nstuff on stream\nit has a differential diagnosis to it\nand it's interesting because one of the\ncauses of people experiencing very high\nlevels of subjective depression\nis something like narcissism so people\nwho are narcissistic will experience\nhigh levels of depression\nand then the interesting thing about\npeople who are narcissistic is that\ntheir depression is a lot more variable\nand fluctuant and is a lot more\nenvironmental in nature\nso it's not actually a neurochemical\nimbalance if you give a narcissist who's\nfeeling depressed and ssri\nantidepressant medication it's actually\nnot going to work because the source of\ndepression is not\nneurochemical in nature\nand so then if we really want to go out\nof line you know like we can start to\ndraw conclusions but we can't really do\nany of that stuff\nbut sometimes i see these kinds of\nthings where people are like\nshowing off\nand feeling depressed and they're saying\nthat this works for me it may work for\nyou\nbut i think there's a\nof\nwhat people's depression comes from and\nwhat works for it\nso should you exercise sure should you\ndo vitamin d sure\nshould you get sunlight absolutely or\nssri is going to work for you maybe not\nanti-depressant medication can work for\nyou maybe not\nbut it'll work for some people it'll\nhelp for some people\nand so be careful about judging that\neveryone else's experience of depression\nis yours\nor that your understanding of depression\napplies to other people\nbecause it's not unique it's just like\nlove or enjoyment or satisfaction or\nhow much you like swimming it's variable"
