    "transcript": "so like if i'm internally content why\nthe hell am i here it's because i have\nall of these karmas to complete\nnow you'll understand why you're here\nyou're not here for the sake of being\nhere you're here because\nyou owe this world something\nand then as you complete those things\nyou'll be free\nso help\nmeditation is turning me stoic\ni've been doing some meditation the past\nthree to four years and now i've\ndiscovered dr k i've started doing it\neven more often\nhowever what i've realized is that in\nthe safe space of my existence where\nthere's only my eye\nand no turbulence\ni'm so comfortable that i never want to\nleave and it feels like the only real\nthing to my existence\nfor example yesterday night i was laying\nin bed thinking what tattoo i want to\nget next and then it struck me that the\neye\non the inside does not really care about\ntattoos\nthe eye doesn't really care about\nanything it just exists\nso i if i tune into it\ninto that\nthe more i feel like all my wants are\ncompletely erased but then what's the\npoint of living just to sit with that\nemotion of not wanting anything until i\nrot away\nhow do i practice meditation without\nfeeling like things in my material world\nstop mattering or is this enlightenment\nrealizing nothing matters and i can just\nsit there in my head and meditate until\ni pass away\nbut if so why do monks and such keep on\nliving\nwhat do i do when i easily can tap into\nthe eye safe space of myself live\nbecause i don't really feel like there's\nany motivation to anything\nediting in one of my replies in the\ncomments here i do get a boost from\ncreating working on self-development or\nhelping others\nhowever i feel like all these things\nclassify as material\nit's not my inner eye that gets a kick\nit's my ego that likes feeling good\nabout itself\nmy inner self just observes it feels\nlike it doesn't really care about these\nthings\ni'm also at a happy and stable point in\nlife so i wouldn't say that i'm using\nmeditation as a form of escapism\nokay\nfantastic post\nso\nsometimes when people start meditating\nit starts working\nwhat does that mean\nso let's run through a couple of\nrelevant details here\nso the person is sitting in bed\nthinking about what tattoo they want\nnext and then they realize like where is\nthis desire coming from\ni don't really need a tattoo it's just\nlike\ni'm content in here i don't need it\nso as we meditate and as we get in touch\nwith our inner solves let's also\nremember that this person is relatively\nstable and happy in life right\nwe start to recognize that like\nthis is kind of weird like i don't\nreally need all of this stuff that i\nthought i needed before my wants and\ndesires start to go away which is like\none of the benefits of meditation\nso here we are most of us\ncaught up in our desires i want this i\nwant this i want this\nright i want people to love me i want to\nbe respected\ni want to be able to hold my head up\nwith pride\ni want to be able to\nget the hell out of my house i want to\nbe more physically in shape i want i\nwant i want i want this person's love\ni want more money i want more stuff\nthe problem with chasing desires is that\nit's the hedonistic treadmill\nso i want a promotion but am i content\nthen no\ni want another promotion\ni make a hundred grand a year now i want\n120. he's getting 120 i didn't get\npromoted this year\ni want a tattoo\nand what does this person want which\ntattoo am i getting next\nso the problem with desire is that\nthere's always a next so despite\nwhatever kind of fulfillment you do\nthere's more fulfillment to be had\nso we start meditating\nand as we meditate we start to become a\nlittle bit less materialistic we start\nto like understand ourselves bored we\nfind a space of contentment within us\nwhich by the way is what all these\npeople who are depressed and addicted\nand all that kind of stuff that's what\nthey're looking for that's why we teach\npeople meditation by the way so they can\nfind the space where i am content\ni don't need something else i don't need\nto feel shame or even if i feel ashamed\nthe shame is there because your your\ndesire for the tattoo is still there\nright let's be clear\nit's just the desire for the tattoo no\nlonger dictates your actions\nso even as you start to meditate you\ndon't feel less you don't become numb\nyou still feel guilt you still feel\nshame\nbut\nthat guilt and shame controls you less\nthat's why meditation is so powerful\nso another thing to kind of point out is\nthat this kind of state happens to more\nmore to people who are stable and happy\nin life\nso this is what meditation was designed\nfor it was never designed as a treatment\nto fix what's broken it was designed as\ntaking someone who's stable and helping\nthem become\nsuper normal\nit's all the same actually but\nwe'll just steer clear of that for a\nsecond\nso then we run into a problem if we\nstart to meditate successfully and now\nwe have to be i have to toss out a\ndisclaimer here which is that if you're\njust keep meditating don't worry about\nthis being the success that you should\nshoot for trying to attain this state\nwill interfere with your ability to\nattain it so for whatever reason you\nmeditate\njust that's fine you don't need to get\nhere you don't need to try to get here\nor anything like that okay this is a\nconsequence of meditating so for\nwhatever reason you use to meditate you\nwill eventually get to this place\nokay\nthe goal doesn't matter like it doesn't\nmatter why you're running if you run for\nfive miles a day there will be changes\nto your body that will definitely happen\nright you will lose weight\nyour cardiovascular health will improve\net cetera et cetera et cetera okay\nso then this creates a problem for a lot\nof competent yet novice meditators which\nis that\ni've lived my whole life and in fact the\nstructure of life\nis based on ambition\non wanting things that's what our\nculture is designed on right so if we\nlook at things like social media and\nlike we look at like targeted\nadvertising and cookies\nright so like online cookies\nwe try we live in a society that tries\nto create\nmaterialistic need\nhey by the way so you can just follow\nfashion trends\nby the way\ni know that some people paint their\nnails and did you know that you can\npaint the fourth nail slightly\ndifferently\nand we're gonna add a little bit\nsomething onto that and then everyone\nstarts kind of doing it and then\neveryone's like oh like my nails aren't\ngood enough and now let me go pay an\nextra three dollars for like this\nadditional thing\nthat's what our society bases itself on\nright even we're guilty of this look\nmerch store\nright\nhey there's stuff you can buy\nright\nso this is the way that society works\nwhere it's all based on ambition and\ndesire triumph\nelon musk now owns this percentage of\ntwitter that's something that someone\nout there is aspiring to i wish i was a\nmega billionaire then i could do this\nthis this this this\nso we build our lives on ambition oh\nlike little gent jimmy little timmy\nlittle lucy\nlittle prakash\nyou know like\nwhatever\nlittle jose\nget a's if you get a's you'll get a good\njob if you get a good job you'll make\nlots of money if you get make lots of\nmoney you'll be a desirable mate you'd\nbe your desirable mate you'll marry\nsomeone who you love and who's awesome\nand attractive then you'll have babies\nand then you'll have this beautiful\nperfect life\nthis is the road to happiness it's based\non ambition and accomplishment\nso as you meditate\nit's really confusing\nbecause this goes away\nand now you're like well hold on a\nsecond\nambition and desire is how i have\nstructured my life and has been the\nsource of my motivation and let's be\nclear it can be a very good source of\nmotivation right\nvery good source of motivation that's\nwhy most people do it\nnow as you start to like become as you\nput it stoic\nyou're like\ni don't feel like doing anything because\ni'm kind of content\nso this is not where\na lot of people get confused because\nthey think like\nhow do i live life now and this is where\ni'd say this is actually when you start\nliving life\npeople prior to the state aren't truly\nliving it they're chasing desires that's\nnot living life\nso once you find contentment within\nyourself a couple of very important\nthings start to happen\nthe first\nis that opportunity cost shrinks\nso like when i'm chasing desire\nit's hard for me to pick one thing over\nanother thing\nmy ability to pick is actually\nconstrained by my desire\nso when i lack contentment on the inside\ni need to eat a slice of pizza instead\nof a salad\nbecause i get more from the pizza the\npizza brings me more happiness\nbecause i'm fundamentally not content in\nhere and so i choose pizza over salad or\ni choose playing video games over\nstudying\nso this is one of the benefits of\nmeditation that people discover as you\nlearn to be content within yourself\nas you're thinking about ordering a\nsalad\nyou're like oh i want the pizza tap into\nthat piece and say i'm gonna order salad\nand you'll be like you know what it's\ntotally fine\ni can order pizza and i can enjoy it the\nsame as salad\nnow you've activated activated god mode\nin life\nas long as you can do this your choices\nare exactly what you want them to be and\nare not going to be influenced by desire\nyou can do whatever you want to\nbecause for you\nlike it's the same\nright if you're equally content with a\ntattoo or without a tattoo you never\nhave to get another tattoo\nand so then people may wonder but then\nlike how do i choose which is something\nyou'll learn\nso here's what you should do engage in\nlife\nexperiment\nsee what else is out there\nright so what i would say is\ndo whatever you kind of feel like doing\nand i realize the whole point is you may\nnot feel like doing much so i'd say like\nlive life but live life from this\nperspective\nand what you'll discover is that like\nall of it is way more joyous\nand so like i don't know how to say this\nbut when we play a video game like why\ndo we play the video game if it's not\nreal\nlike what does it matter\nif i use a sword or a bow\nin a video game\nwhat does it matter if i built go mage\nbuild or bonk build in elden ring what\ndoes it matter it doesn't matter\nbut it's not like\nglobal warming will get better in either\nsituation it's not like\nyou know\nwe're gonna fix world hunger it's not\nlike we're going to clean the oceans by\ngoing bonk build over mage build\nit doesn't matter\nand yet\nwe can do it and we do it with so much\nmore joy\nso the other thing that starts to happen\nis that life becomes more like a video\ngame but in the best possible ways\nit becomes less important whether i do\nthings one way or the other and so it\njust sort of becomes like a simple\nenjoyment\nand then life transforms into something\ncalled lila\nso as you move towards enlightenment the\nword for reality the word in sanskrit\nthat gets translated into english as\nreality is technically translated as\nplay\nbut scholars will translate it as\nreality\nso like life becomes\nplay\nit becomes joyous it becomes fun no\nmatter what you do you're having a good\ntime\nand so then you can choose freely\nand so just like\nthen you could say but how do i choose\nwell that's based on the internal rules\nof the game\nso then you start playing the game of\nlife\nright so like even though nothing is\nreal like how do you choose something in\na video game because based on the\ninternal rules\nso there's like an internal set of rules\nwhich we're going to play by\nand life is the same way so if you want\nto get a job you should get a job\npart of the rules of life or generally\nspeaking we should try out this\nrelationship stuff so let's try it out\nand let's try to enjoy it and see if\nit's for us and then you'll kind of come\nto a very simple experiential base\nconclusion this is good i'm going to do\nthis thing\ni'm going to get a tattoo i'm not going\nto get a tattoo\nyou become free from the constraints of\ndesire which allows you to actually\nengage more fully with life\nand so what's confusing is people think\nthat the opposite of ambition is apathy\nwhich in a sense apathy and ambition\nare opposites but when you meditate this\nis why people use the word transcend you\ntranscend that axis\nyou transcend the axis of like ambition\nand apathy into just like enjoyment and\nfreedom\nand so this is why even as people talk\nabout enlightenment they they call it\nbliss they call it freedom like those do\nyou all get how those are like in the\nenglish language those are not synonyms\nbliss and freedom are not say in the\nsame ballpark at all\nand enlightenment implies knowledge like\nwhat is going on here like these are not\nsimilar things but as you progress\nspiritually you will get to a state of\nmind which when boiled down to\ntranslation\nyou know like when we reduce things the\nstate of language and logic which is not\nreally like what reality is\nright so reality is not\ndictated by human logic human logic is\nan attempt to approximate reality\nand so we use these kinds of words\nso as you progress just\nlive\nby all means play by the rules and you\nwill see that things are more joyous\nthe other thing that happens you still\nhave a long way to go are you\nenlightened yet i don't think so let me\nshow you why so the other thing that\nhappens when we start to meditate\nis we conquer the big problems\nand by big i mean like\nnot more important\ni mean the things that are more visible\nso\ni was lying in bed thinking what tattoo\ni want to get\nnext and that struck me that the eye on\nthe inside does not really care about\ntattoos guy doesn't care about anything\nand then\nso okay fine you're uncaring here you're\nenlightened with this thought sure\nso if i tune into that more all my wants\nare completely erased but but then\nwhat's the point of living just sit with\nemotion of not wanting until i rot away\nsee this is an unenlightened thought\nthis this word wrought away\nthere's an attachment\nyou see that\nso like you're free over here but you're\nnot free over here\nright like this is a problem for you\nwhich is why you're making the post\nbut it's subtle\nso this is where in meditation the\nproblems that we deal with are subtler\nand subtler and subtler they get smaller\nand smaller and smaller\nright so it's like we pick the low\nhanging fruit which is desire over a\ntattoo and then we get to other\nthings so then\nwe also see like\nanother thing changing because i don't\nreally feel like there's any motivation\nto things but i do get a boost from\ncreating working on self-development and\nhelping others this is another quality\nof people who meditate they become more\naltruistic they become more creative\nthey improve as human beings so this is\nabsolutely in the right direction this\nis the reason why many people meditate\nyou may not be doing it for these\nadvantages which is good it's not the\nright reason to do it\nnot really a right reason\nbut all of these consequences will start\nto change you'll become more\nmaterialistically successful your\nrelationships will improve\nyour understanding of the self will\nimprove\nhowever i feel like all these things\nclassify as material here's your problem\nnumber two so now that we've got a real\nmeditator we're gonna go into subtleties\nclassification\nthis\ncan never classify\ndo you understand that\nthe mind of a meditator can never\nclassify\nclassification is of the mind it's not\ndoesn't come from transcendence of mind\nit comes from operation within mind\nit's not my inner eye that gets the cake\nit's my ego that likes feeling good\nabout itself so let's go even subtler\nwhat's wrong with your ego getting a\nkick\nwhy do we place a value judgment on ego\ngetting a kick is bad\nand the internal state is good\nwhy do we place a value judgment\non the inner self over the ego\nso now what we see with people who are\ngood meditators is these are the next\nquestions that come up it's beautiful\nthis person is doing wonderful\nbut now the challenges that you face\nare more subtle you've leveled up\nbut you're far from finishing the game\nlike we're just getting started like you\njust completed the tutorial my friend\nand so now you dig into these things so\nthen ask yourself\nwhat's it like having an ego that's\ngratified so let's remember that there's\na reason why we have an ego right the\nego serves a purpose\nego isn't bad\nego and control is bad\nyou being in control of your ego is\nperfectly fine and then you ask the\nquestion what is the i in that sentence\nor what is the you it's not the ego it's\nthat transcend itself\nso what should you do very practically\ni'd say first of all you're on a\nfantastic track just keep doing what\nyou're doing\nbut\nlive life more fully so engage more and\nobserve\nnow you're really now you have you're\ncentered in your capacity of observation\nso now you can learn so now you should\ngo and do different things\nlike\ngo find a romantic relationship if you\ndon't have one go get promoted go\nswimming\ndo all of these different experiences\nand see what life has to offer because\nnow you can live life to the fullest\nbecause you're not constrained by a\ndesire\nnow you can actually enjoy stuff so like\nnow we're in the video game we're like\nvibin\nright so the enlightened person vibes\nwith life\nmore practically\nyou may be ready for\ndeeper\nspiritual practice now that you have\nthis observing self so if you have the\nopportunity to learn more mystical\nesoteric advanced or powerful meditation\ni would strongly recommend that\ndepending on what your goals are and\nstuff like that i think you're probably\nbecause it requires a certain amount of\nlike\ncentering to be able to tolerate that\nkind of stuff\nand unless you're centered in this way\nthat's when when people do powerful\nmeditation techniques i personally think\nwe don't really have good data on this\nwe know there's meditation and do\npsychosis but i think when you're\ngrounded in this way your hopefully\nwon't become psychotic if you do a\npowerful meditation technique that's\nbeen my experience anyway\nand that's why how they're taught in\ntraditions\nso the last thing is that this is one of\nthe cases where i think that you know\nreally\nfinding a good spiritual tradition will\nhelp you a lot\nso like gurus are kind of you got to be\ncareful in a sense but this is why gurus\nexist\nthe real role of a guru is to guide this\nperson\nbecause chances are they're not going to\nfind the answers to things like in logic\nor in books or in other places\nso you really need someone who's like\nspiritually like advanced to understand\nwhat you're experiencing and then like\nguide you effectively and hopefully\nideally give you appropriate techniques\nto help you work on this stuff\nbut i'd say you can still you know\nbut the essence of it is the same you've\nalready mastered\nthe main moves\nso much like a video game like you know\nyou go through the tutorial you know all\nthe moves like that's all the moves\nthe game gets harder but you just have\nto use those moves in a more\nsophisticated way you have to use those\nmoves against more difficult enemies\nso then like think about that sense of\nrot right can you sit with contentment\nwhile you rot away of course not then\nyou wouldn't use the word rot okay so\nwhere does that come from\nso there you'll find a subtler desire\ncan you let that go no i can't so be\nnon-judgmental towards that okay i'm\ngonna hold on to that desire so be it\nright i'm in this world it's my karma to\nhave some of these things so let me\npursue them\nand as you go on this path so many of\nthese things that people talk about will\nbecome very clear to you what is karma\nyou'll understand this now now you'll\nnow you're truly able to understand what\nkarma is\nlike if i'm internally content why the\nhell am i here it's because i have all\nof these karmas to complete\nnow you'll understand why you're here\nyou're not here for the sake of being\nhere you're here because\nyou owe this world something\nand then as you complete those things\nyou'll be free\nso it's even said in sort of the karmic\ntraditions that after someone gains\nenlightenment they take one more birth\nis that it's because they still have\nkarma left over\nso as long as they don't re-engage in\nadditional karma they kind of like\nyou know it's like probate\ni think\nafter someone passes away\nright it's like settling the estate\nwhich happens after you die\nso this is the kind of stuff that i\nthink is like tricky\nbecause i think that like this is where\nwe really have to if you really want to\nunderstand what's going on here i feel\nlike i have to lean way more on the\nspiritual tradition far away from\nscience and even away from logic because\nlogic like falls apart at some point\nand i cannot emphasize this enough like\nonce you understand spiritual experience\nyou'll realize that\nlogic is not real right it's a human\nconception\nit's our human mind's ability to\norganize reality\nso even if we think about things like\nthe laws of physics like the laws of\nphysics stop working\nat the quantum level\ni barely even know what that means but\nthat's what people who are knowledgeable\nin physics say\nlike how is that logical\nlike the laws of physics just stop\nit's like i'm going to zoom in laws of\nphysics work i'm going to zoom in laws\nof physics work i'm going to zoom in\nlaws of physics work zoom in a little\nbit more ah\nlaws of physics stopped working\nnow\ni'm sure there is a logic to it i'm sure\nthere's a system to it because that's\nthe way the world works right it just\nexists in a particular way logic is the\nway that we try to understand it but\nthat's filtered through the shortcomings\nof the human mind\nand so that's why like i can't\nteach this kind of stuff because all\nyou're going to get is like logical\nexplanation but you have to be here\nfirst then you'll truly understand\nquestions\nyeah so so someone's saying uh plato\nwould like to have a word with you so\nwould mathematicians logic is only a a\nperception and not some intrinsic\nproperty of how the world works no so\nthe world works with logic\nfor sure\nhuman logic is different from the\nworld's logic right that's why we make\nobservations in the world that are not\nlogical\nthen we have to adapt our human logic\nto better fit\nthe harmony of the world\ni don't know if that's a better answer\nright and mathematicians can have a word\nbut that's just words\nit's not reality right\nso like reality is one thing our\nrepresentation of reality as humans is\nsomething else\nwe tend to get closer and closer that's\nwhat science is about science is about\nunderstanding how do we reconcile\nthat which is illogical and then we\nlearn\nwe adapt our human logic and our human\nunderstanding closer to reality\nbut that reality is out there and our\nhuman logic is over here and we're\ngetting closer and closer and closer\nit's unclear whether that relationship\nis asymptotic\nso isn't it then nihilistic also how do\nwe know what to do in such a state if\nthere are no desires or difference to it\nat all i'm lost yeah that's why you have\nto experiment that's my point that's a\nthis is a hard thing to understand\nunless you're already here so what i'd\nsay is if you're in this place go and\nengage in life\nand you'll learn at a level that you've\nnever learned before because of the\ncapacity of your observing self\nright food will taste different\nyou'll struggle\nfor a while\nand then you'll discover like\nit's way easier than you ever thought it\nwas it's hard to describe it's just way\neasier\nso what meditation is recommended to\nreach this point of contentment it is\nnot a meditation that will bring you to\nthis point of contentment necessarily\nso the meditation that's recommended is\nnot based on where you go\nit is sort of but the biggest\nrequirement of what meditation is not\nbased on where you want to go but where\nyou are\nright so if you were to ask me\nwhat would you recommend if i want to\nlearn quantum mechanics i could say go\nsign up for a quantum mechanics course\nbut if you're five and you don't\nunderstand arithmetic\nthat's not going to help you very much\neven though it's the right answer\nso if you want to get somewhere\neveryone's concerned about the goal\nthe bigger question is where are you\nmeditation should be designed for this\nnot for\nthis and this is the big problem with\nmeditation so everyone says here's about\nwe do this right we fall into this trap\nwe do it for a reason because it's the\nonly way to do it there's the best way\nto do it that i figured out\nwhich is here's a meditation for this\nthing here's a meditation for this is a\nmeditation for this meditation for this\nbecause we've gotten the idea that\nmeditation is for something that is\nfundamentally false meditation is not\nfor anything\nthe second you add a for something it\nbecomes of the world it stops becoming\ntranscendent\nit's not\nso why do we do that to trick people\ninto meditating you trick yourself into\nthis state\nyou just meditate for a while it doesn't\nmatter what you do as long as you keep\nmeditating with any technique you will\nget here\nif you're meditating properly that is\ntranscendence can be achieved from any\nof these techniques\nit's just figuring out which one is\nright for you so it's not about the\ntranscendence it's about you\nso can you sit still\ndo you like focusing on your breath do\nyou like to move\nthese are the kinds of questions do you\nwant an esoteric practice does that\nexcite you more what gets you to\npractice the easiest that's what\nmeditation should be\nbut aren't you desiring a relationship\nwhen you want to try it out no quite the\nopposite\nso when you desire something you have a\nparticular goal or satisfaction in mind\ntrying something out is actually the\nexact opposite because you have nothing\nin mind\nwhen you try something for the first\ntime you cannot have a desire for it do\nyou all get that\nlike your desires they may be based on\nconceptions\nbut that's not the real desire or it's a\ndesire based on a conception\nso to try something out it's like the\nfirst time you try pizza after that the\ndesire you'll have for pizza is going to\nbe completely different from anything\nyou had before\nso as you start trying things out like\ntrying stuff out proceeds desire not the\nother way around\nso life is a to-do list of karma life is\nsort of\nlife brings with it a karmic to-do list\nbut this tidbit that i shared with you\nall is once again it's like reported\nright so we have no idea that's true or\nnot\nbut people from karmic traditions will\nsay that you'll have one last life\npost-enlightenment to settle your karmas\ni have no idea if that's true or not\nbut for those people it's a to-do list\nof karma\nokay how do you differ between ego and i\nso ego is i\nso that's why so even in in translation\nright so\nin sanskrit when you look at these texts\nthey won't use the word i\nwhen they're talking about\nthis\nthey'll use words like this they'll use\nwords like the self\nthey'll use words like thuria\nturia is that which\ntranscends other states\nit's like the the state that you cannot\ndescribe\nright so ego and i kind of go hand in\nhand\nand so the key thing is that who you\ntruly are is more than your ego\nthat's the self\nwhich is why we use that term\nand is the self i no\nand if they're like how the hell does\nthat work that's not logical at all you\nhave to experience it then you'll\nunderstand like i don't like that's the\nproblem with this these spiritual\ntraditions\nis that logic you can't transmit\nunderstanding through information\nno amount of watching pornography is\ngoing to teach you what it's like to\nhave sex\nit just can't be done\nor at least\ni haven't seen a way to figure it out\nyet\nmaybe someone else will be\ncorrect and maybe someone else will\nfigure it out\nokay\nyeah so i know this this last\npost so this is the challenge right it's\nlike what i tried to do today is get uh\na lot of different stuff so they're\ndifferent\ndifferent people in our community\nat different stages of their development\nand\nthere's also like sort of a sequence\nright so this is it's nice that we see\nall of these posts so i didn't really\ncomment on this but the nice thing about\nall these posts is that all of them are\ngood\nall of them show self-reflection all of\nthem show curiosity all of them show\nunderstanding and it's just where you\nare and it's not like so even though i\nsort of implied that one is ahead of the\nother it's kind of irrelevant right\nlike if i'm 22 years old and i'm\nfinishing college and there's a\nsix-year-old who's in the first grade\nlike one is ahead of the other but it's\nnot nothing to be ashamed of it's just\nwhere we are\nright so it's not that there's a value\njudgment on a head or behind which is\nwhat we put on it right that's what our\nmind does we just are where we are\nyou're like what if i'm 22 and i'm in\nthe first grade then i'm behind well\nit's like that's where you are right\nit's not\ncould you have been anywhere else well\nthat becomes complicated\nokay\nshould we meditate\nso when someone says yeah the\nsix-year-old is owning the 20 year old\nso here's the thing you're correct\nbut that presumes a comparison\nright a comparison improve\nimplies some kind of judgment\nyou can't have a a comparison without\nequality\nand once you add equality you're placing\na judgment right if i say this is hot\nhotter than this\nthat implies a scale it implies a\ncomparison once i name something is hot\ni name something as cold\nso you're correct\nit's just then you've slipped out of\nthe not the right kind of thing that\nkind of thing he has value for sure\nbut\nit's not the right kind of thinking for\nthis goal\nokay\nso by that standard how do you escape\njudgment\nsee you guys ask the same questions over\nand over and over again\nhow do you escape you don't you all see\nthat like everyone's always looking to\nescape how do i avoid pain how do i find\nready how do i become ready how do i\navoid pain how do i escape judgment how\ndo i stop feeling this way\nyou're stuck in a loop absolutely\nright\ni'm not saying it's bad\nit's just notice it\nso how would that how would this be\ndifferent if you were okay\nwith a little bit of pain if you were\nokay with some suffering\nright and this is when you say deal with\nit that's you know sort of\nthat's not i mean that's not very\nhelpful\nso the first thing is just like\nunderstand what your mind is trying to\ndo because just like if y'all caught the\nthe thing about avoidance and being\nready\noftentimes it is our desire to escape\nthat traps us the most\nright it is the avoidance of problems\nthat creates problems\nlike that's not dr k doesn't need to\nexplain that to you you all understand\nthat right\noh my god i only have seven days left to\nstudy let me avoid that problem and not\nstudy today\noh my god i only have six days left to\nstudy oh my god that's overwhelming i\nwasted a day\nlet me waste another one\nit's tricky\nthis is some crackpot stuff dr k still\nfeels fear anxiety pain he's not some\nkind of realized buddha under a bodhi\ntree you're damn right i'm not and i\nfeel all of those things\nso i see people keep on mentioning\njordan peterson i\nyou know\ni i've talked briefly about jordan\npeterson before i don't know if i\nmentioned this to you guys but i watched\nwhen i was in residency i watched his\ncourse on personality and i thought it\nwas absolutely phenomenal\ni'm not so sure about some of his more\nrecent stuff but in terms of like his\nability to synthesize and explain things\ni think it's very good\nthe other thing is that i don't think\nneither me nor jordan peterson are\noriginal thinkers\nfor the record i certainly am not\nlike what i teach is not based on\noriginal thought in fact it's like based\non a huge tradition of people who\nfigured things out way before i did\nmaybe jordan peterson was an original\nthinker i don't know\num\nnow you guys are really really good at\nregurgitating derivative information\ni completely agree\nso if you look at people who\ntend to be popular on the internet\nwe're good at transmitting information\nwe're not necessarily original thinkers\ndoes that make sense\nso like success on the internet is about\ntransmission of information\nnot\norigin original of\nof thought\nso i think we're good at explaining\nthings\nyes we can meditate now so i thought i\nwas go so people are asking questions\nyou know how do i become content how do\ni let go things like that so also maybe\ni'm feeling a little bit more on the\nspiritual side today so i was going to\nteach you all the shanti mantra\nso people are also asking questions\nabout mantras and stuff like that how do\ni find my mantra that's also weird\nesoteric cultish kind of stuff but\nso one mother that i think is safe to\nshare for lack of a better term won't\ninduct you into any kind of cult you can\nuse it if you want to you cannot use it\nif you don't want to\nis the shanti mantra so shanti means\npeace\nand it's just something that you can\nkind of chant right so we know that from\na scientific perspective chanting stuff\njust in general seems to have positive\neffects on our mind and has benefits\nfrom you know evidence-based\nor evidence scientifically validated\nbenefits\nso i don't think the shanti mantra will\nhurt you\num the other thing is that for people\nwho are\nso the shanti mantra has a religious\nconnotation to it but i don't really\nthink that that's an accurate\nrepresentation i don't think that you\nare praying to a particular thing\nor becoming part of a particular\nreligion by intoning the shanti mantra\nso the western concept of religion is if\nyou do certain things that makes you a\ncertain kind of religion so western\nreligion is very like\nthere's us and there's them right\nthere's like the infidels and the chosen\npeople\nlike there's that dividing line and it's\nlike these are the things that separate\nfor the us from the them\nso the eastern religion like what\nhappened is people from the west like\nshowed up in the east and they're like\noh these people have a set of beliefs\nthat's a religion\nso the shanti mantra is a mantra it's\njust a chant to ideally invoke peace so\nif you call that you're not\nasking a god to do it for you\nso it's just an attempt to cultivate\npeace is the best way that i'd put it\nnow if you think that's religious that's\nyou can easily make an argument for that\ni'm not saying that you're wrong it's\njust not how i see which is part of the\nreason that i teach it\nso if i were to teach anyway we may\nteach religious stuff at some point but\nyou know there are some like goddess\nworship things or like shiva worship or\nstuff like that like the worshipping\nstuff i think is more clearly religion\nthis seems a little bit different to me\nso the shanti mantra is tricky because\nmost people can't say the word shanti\nso what they say is shanti\nso the first thing that we're going to\ndo to learn the shanti mantra is we're\ngoing to teach you all the proper\npronunciation\ndoes the proper pronunciation matter\nnow i'm going to go ahead and say yes\nand the reason i'm going to say yes is\nbecause people who i trust told me it\nmattered\nso the first thing we're going to do is\nlearn how to so hopefully most people\ncan change sean\nso it's not shan\nso if you think about shan versus sean\nit's the way that your mouth widens or\nopens vertically or laterally right so\nif i say shanty\nshanty\nit's going like this and if i say sean\nit's opening so the first thing is sean\nis like opening tall and it's kind of\nweird but if you just practice that if\nyou go shan shan shan shan shan shan\nyou'll notice what the difference is\nokay\nnext thing is the thie\nso this is hard especially from people\nof like western cultures\nso what they'll say is shanti\nright so it's not or shanti\nit's not shanti like a shanty town\nso that's because when we make the sound\nt\nnotice where the tongue is okay so i'm\ngoing to zoom in a little bit\nt\nt\nt t t\nthe tongue remains behind the teeth when\ni say t\nt so just do that for a second go five\ntimes t\nokay\nnow what we're going to do is\nso put your tongue between your teeth\nyou all got that\nso\nthis is how you say\nso try it with me now\nshanti\nshanti so you can go slow at the\nbeginning if you want to you can\npractice so i see a lot of people who\nare like into yoga and like converting\nto hinduism and stuff like that\nusually caucasians or maybe south\namericans or things like that but\num\nand then they'll you know they'll really\nstruggle with the sanskrit pronunciation\ni don't think it's that hard i think no\none's ever bothered to teach them right\nso it's like\nenye from spanish\nso senor you just have to learn how to\nmake form your\nmouth in the right\nshape and then the sound will come out\nnaturally okay\nso shanti okay\nso if you feel like you've got a good\nhandle on that shanthi shanthi let's\npractice a little bit\nnow we'll do it a couple of times more\nquickly\nnow what we're gonna do is the shanti\nmantra so we're gonna take a deep breath\nand i'll demonstrate okay\nso\nom\nshanti shanti shantihi\n[Music]\n[Music]\nall right really simple\nokay so now we're gonna do it together\nso what i want y'all to do is sit up\nstraight\nokay take a deep breath in\nand om\nshanti shanti shanti\n[Music]\nand again\nom shanti shanti shanti\nwe're gonna do it a third time\n[Music]\nand now what we're going to do we're\ngoing to add two modifications okay\nthe first is we're going to slow it down\nand stretch it out a little bit\nthe second is that as you chant with\nyour eyes closed\nfocus on the vibration not on the sound\nso at the very beginning we're going to\nbe focusing on the mouth to make sure\nyou can do the movements right make sure\nyou get the pronunciation right\ninvoke it properly\ni saw a good comment that pronunciation\nis something invocation is sacred\nit's interesting right so it's an\ninvocation\nso we're gonna focus on that vibration\nand kind of slow it down a little bit\ndon't try to squeeze through it okay or\ndon't try to rush it so close your eyes\njust take a moment to observe your\nbreathing\nand now we'll take a deep breath in and\nbegin\n[Music]\nand really feel that\nyou can continue to breathe feel that\nrising force as you say shanti\nright so focus on that upward momentum\nthat you'll feel kind of from your\nabdomen through your chest and out your\nmouth\nso we'll begin again deep breath in\nombre\n[Music]\nhe\ntake a moment to breathe\nand one more time\nom shanti shanti\n[Music]\nand so this is a practice that you want\nto do if you're feeling\nupset in some way it's an invocation for\npeace\nand even from sort of like a mind-body\nperspective whatever feelings you have\nnegative emotions tend to be felt in the\nbelly in the chest and in the throat\nand so as you chant shanthi mantra\nyou're like letting that stuff out\nyou're like cleaning it out cleaning it\nout cleaning it out\nyou can do the practice for five minutes\nat a stretch if you want to ideally you\ncan work your way up to 15 or 20\nand we'll sort of demonstrate now what a\nreally like kind of slow shanti mantra\nlooks like\nin general the shanti mantra is going to\nhave a lot of physiologic benefits that\nall meditations have you'll notice that\nas you do the shanti mantra it's by\ndefinition going to change your pattern\nof breathing\nso remember that the rate of exhalation\nheavily governs the calmness or speed of\nmind so when we're very very rapid\nhyperventilation is associated with\nanxiety so as we slow things down it may\nnot be anything mystical about shanthi\nit just may simply be breathing right so\nwe know that some of these things are\ngoing to work regardless of whether\nthere's any emphasis to the mantra\nitself\nfor those of you that are open to it i\nrecommend\nopening yourself up to the shanti mantra\nand seeing what kinds of effects it has\nremember that a lot of these mantras\nwere kind of developed based on these\nweird like experiences or spiritual\nsensations this idea of prana or chi\nright so does it affect that in any way\nmaybe it does maybe it doesn't you're a\nchoice whether you want to explore that\nor not\nso we'll end one more time so i'll end\nwith one final shanti mantra that'll go\nnice and slow okay\nso you can join me if you want to so\nwe're going to breathe\njust in and out\ni'm going to do three breaths\nand then the big breath and then the\nmantra so breath number one\nnumber two\ni'm going to slow down before number\nthree\nnumber three\nnice and slow\nand now we'll begin the shanti mantra\ndeep breath in\n[Laughter]\nthe shot\n[Laughter]\n[Music]\nthat feels good\nright so as you do that nice slow breath\nnotice how you feel\nmaybe a little lightheaded\nmaybe it was a bit much for you that's\nokay do what your breath allows\nshanti means peace\nright and feel that vibration\n[Music]\n[Laughter]\nhe\nah great question why can't we just go\npeace\nso\nbeautiful experiment\ni want you to try chanting peace\nthree times\nsee how you feel see where the vibration\nis\nsee what the difference between shanti\nand peace is\nyou'll be able to tell\nso here's the last thing i'll leave you\nwith\nyou know how we were saying\nearlier that\nscience or the world or reality operates\nby logic and human conception\ntries to capture it with our own logic\nthat there's like the way the world\nworks and then there's our understanding\nof science and through progression we\nget closer and closer to the way the\nworld works to understanding the real\nscience\nso the shanti mantra\nwas not someone trying to invoke the\nidea of peace\nit was someone trying to understand the\nfundamental nature of peace\nand then figuring out\nwhat set of syllables closely matches\nthe quality of peace\nthe shanti mantra is not words that mean\npeace\nit is an attempt\nto\nencapsulate the fundamental concept of\npeace\nwith\na vibration\ni know that sounds very esoteric very\nmystical and very weird but if you all\nwant to understand this you can do it\ntoo\nso for example\nthe breath has a particular\nset of syllables consonants vowels\nthat are the sound of the breath\nthere is a sound of the ocean\nright these things have sounds\nand so what mantras are they're reverse\nengineered from observation they're not\nlanguage that is then used to capture a\nconcept\nuh i guess actually that's exactly what\nit is in a sense but what i mean is that\nthe the mantra is reverse engineered\nfrom the thing itself\nand so that's why it's shanti\nand that's why when i teach i don't\nteach peace peace peace and if you chant\npeace three times you're gonna feel the\ndifference\nand then you ask yourself which one is\ncloser to peace\nand then you'll find an answer and then\nyour logical mind is gonna be like what\nthe hell does that even mean how can a\nsound be close to peace\nlike what those two things are\nfundamentally not related\nbut then you do the practice and then\nyou'll be like actually yeah like one of\nthese feels more peaceful than the other\nand so as the yogis observed and\nobserved and observed they came to these\nconclusions they're like that's weird\ncertain sounds are closer to peace and\ncertain sounds are closer to like other\nstuff\nright\nand they just followed their\nobservations this is why they were in a\nsense scientific because they didn't\napproach it with a preconceived notion\nthey just saw what they they made\nobservations and then they practiced\nexperiments and they came to conclusions\nso for those of you that are skeptical\ndon't believe me do it yourself if you\ncome to a different conclusion then you\ncome to a different conclusion\nmaybe i'm wrong\ndefinitely a possibility quite likely\nmaybe my experience is different from\nyours also really really important thing\nto understand maybe there isn't one\nshanti mantra for all people\nall possibilities but how are you going\nto know\npractice it\nright don't take my word for it practice\nit yourself and see what conclusions you\ncome to am i confident in my conclusions\nsure are they 100 correct how on earth\ncan i say that\ni have no idea\nmaybe you'll be the one who discovers\nthat the peace mantra is superior to the\nshanti mantra who said that the yogis\ndid it right who said that the yogis got\nall the way there\njust practice you figure it out you\ndecide\nwhat do you say to these people that say\nthat these mothers are demonic i'd say\nthat\nthese mantras aren't demonic but they're\nabsolutely demonic mantras\nand we just don't teach those and once\nyou learn a demonic mantra you'll\nunderstand what a demonic mantra is and\nhow these are really not demonic mantras\nright\nso let's remember that in these\ntraditions of meditation\nthere are\nthere's black tantra white tantra and\nred tantra\ninteresting right because in final\nfantasy there's black mage white mage\nand red mage\nmay have something to do a lot of the\nfinal fantasy world is actually based on\nthe hindu mythology or buddhist\nmythology\nso three kinds of tantra\nmantra is a subset of tantra\nso there are black mantras\nand they're also\nlike negative organisms right so a lot\nof the prayer and stuff which we tend to\nsteer clear of right so if you look at\nlike hindu temples they're like gods\nthere right and in buddhist temples\nthere are bodhisattvas\nthese are like organisms or beings that\nhave like a positive alignment to them\nthey come from the positive material\nplane\nor the positive elemental plane or\nwhatever\nbut\nin these mythologies there are also\nvillains roxas's asuras\nright these are the things that once\nagain in the final fantasy games like\nare the bad guys so that level exists\ntoo we just don't go near it\nright but like who said that all of the\nall the bodhisattvas have to be good\nthat's a duality in the judgment in and\nof itself\nit's there\nyou guys really want to know you can go\nto some of these like you know weird\nplaces and really do some\ncult kind of stuff and then you'll\nencounter this stuff it's wild dude\ndon't get me wrong it's just not\nnot everything is for twitch\nyou"
