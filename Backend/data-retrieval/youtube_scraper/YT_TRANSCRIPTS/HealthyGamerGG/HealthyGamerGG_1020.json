    "transcript": "so how do you know\nif you have an addiction or what is an\naddiction so when i am addicted to\nsomething like alcohol or opiates the\nphysiologic effects on my body are\nprofound our gaba receptors get\nregulated so heavily that if you have if\nyou're addicted to alcohol and you stop\ncold turkey the withdrawal that you go\nthrough can conceivably be fatal as\nsomeone who's done a lot of work in\naddictions like the main thing that i\nfound is that you can go to aaa you can\nstart this medication you can go to\nrehab that'll all help but the truth is\nit doesn't work for everyone right so\nwhat's the difference sometimes you'll\nhave people who have a history of trauma\nwho really just want to be loved and\nwhen it comes to addictions it's like\nit's really easy\nto find someone who you can feel love\nfor if both of y'all are addicted to the\nsame substance\n[Music]\nso i've managed to abstain from porn and\nmasturbation but my productivity has\nlowered significantly\nand i am impulsive buying\nuh my impulsive buying came back in full\nforce\nlast time i i posted i was doing so well\ni exercised steadily not half-assed even\nthough i hate exercise i still managed\nto do it good job\ni did my chores did my studies managed\nto control my impulsive buying to a\nmedium yet manageable level\nhowever my porn and masturbation\naddiction was the one i was stumped\nbefore i did another attempt i watched\nthe hubermann podcast with anne lu\nlumbeck\nthe man likes to inform the general\npublic about neuroscience and ways to\nuse it to our advantage he's quite\nsimilar to dr k but highly specialized\non neuroscience bro got a degree and\nmore on the science stuff thankfully i'm\na first-year nursing student so i can\nkeep up with the anatomical parts and\nsuch\nnot gonna lie some of it were way too\nadvanced for me\ni finished the podcast and gained some\ninsight and learned some tips now to put\nthem to practice\ni felt huge fluctuations in my mood it\nmade me wonder if this\nthis is how women felt during\nmenstruation on the first day\ninteresting side benefit of empathy\nmaybe\nfood cravings made me spend more than i\nshould exercise has been great\ndifficulty to initiate\nand finish\ni started living like a slob again\nluckily i managed to finish most of my\nassignments before starting detox so my\nschool load is very light and the\ndeadline is still very far\nthe fact that i felt definitive\nwithdrawals within two or three days\npretty much confirms that i really had a\nlegitimate addiction and those years of\nporn use and masturbation has really\naltered my brain's dopamine homeostasis\nso that the help and advice that i need\nnow how do i recover from such\na difficult process of detoxification\nwhilst juggling my exercise chores\nschoolwork managing finance and keeping\nmy head in the game\nit is legitimately difficult and i\nunderstand i started to understand how\nsome people have great difficulty\nrecovering from addiction once again\nempathy plus one\ni know the road to recovery is constant\nand lifelong and i want to gain some\ninsights and tips to keep myself from\nbecoming worse\nso\nthis is the kind of thing where\ni think this is a really good\nrepresentation of what the road to\nrecovery looks like and there are a lot\nof important principles here\nthat i'm going to sort of share with you\nhaving worked with people who you know\nhave addictions and stuff about\nkind of how the mind works what the role\nof an addiction is and what it feels\nlike to try to get off of it or what are\nthe challenges that it takes to get off\nof something\nso let's start by sort of defining\naddiction okay so how do you know\nif you have an addiction or what is an\naddiction so as human beings we have a\nmind\nand the mind juggles lots of different\nthings the mind experiences positive\nthings it experiences negative things\nand generally speaking when we try to\nget motivated to do something\nthe more negative stuff our mind is\ndealing with the harder it is to do\nright so let's say that i'm trying to\nstudy for an algebra exam\nand\nyou know\nmy girlfriend just broke up with me the\nday before so as a result of those\nnegative emotions\nmy mind is going to be creating all\nthese thoughts there's going to be some\nconcerns maybe anxiety maybe fear for\nthe future maybe guilt all kinds of\ndifferent stuff is going to be going on\nin my mind and i'm unable to study\nso in order to focus our mind what we\ntend to do is use something called a\ncoping mechanism\nso a coping mechanism is a way that we\ntake some kind of distraction negative\nemotion negative thought something that\ngets in the way of us doing what we want\nto do and we use some kind of tool to\nlike make that thing calm down\nso in the worst case scenarios people\nwill use things like substances right so\nlike marijuana or alcohol or whatever\nsometimes we'll use things like video\ngames sometimes we'll use things like\npornography so we've sort of figured out\nis the human race\nwhat are the things that are effective\nat quieting our mind when our mind is\nunquiet\nand once our mind starts to quiet down\nwe can start to be more productive\nso we've sort of figured out almost in\nlike an individual evolutionary sense\nwhat works for us and that's oftentimes\na pattern you'll see with addicts which\nis that they'll have something called a\ndrug of choice why do some people have\none drug of choice and other people have\nanother drug of choice\noftentimes when you're dealing with\npeople who have substance use problems\nthey've tried a lot of stuff right but\nthere's a particular thing that's that\ntheir drug of choice and that even has\nbeen shown to track back to you know\nwhat kind of neuroscience\neffect a particular substance has so you\nknow some is one of my mentors once put\nit doesn't actually work like this but\nyou know a particular drug in one person\ndue to genetic variation and all these\nkinds of other things will light their\nbrain up like a christmas tree\nand for another person the drug will be\ndifferent that's why we have a drug of\nchoice\nso kind of going back we each sort of\nfigure out okay when i have negative\nemotions and i need to focus here's what\ni'm going to use to make myself feel\nbetter\nand the array of coping mechanisms is\nlike vast right so we have everything\nfrom video games and substances to\npornography to also things like\nmeditation\nand exercise and you know eating comfort\nfood right\nso what is an addiction so i tend to\nthink about addictions as things that\nare adaptive and then become maladaptive\nso over time your coping mechanism which\nused to help may still work for that one\nthing but the cost of employing that\ncoping mechanism becomes greater than\nthe benefit\nso like eating comfort food is great\nlike that can be like good it's\nnourishing it feels good whatever or\nmaybe it's not nourishing depending on\nyour comfort food but then when we start\nto like cross the realm of like comfort\nfood into like binge eating\nor you know like food addiction or\nthings like that that's when it's kind\nof gone too far this is where it's\nstarting to affect our health sure it\nstill provides us with some kind of\nemotional benefit but\nlike it's causing problems in other\nparts of life\nso\nif we look at someone who's got an\naddiction usually there are like two\nthings going on so we're going to talk\nabout different kinds of addiction for a\nsecond\nso for a long time there's been a debate\nwhether marijuana is addictive\nand part of that that\ndebate has to do with the principle of\nphysiologic tolerance and withdrawal so\nwhen i am addicted to something like\nalcohol or opiates the physiologic\neffects on my body are profound\nso alcohol works on something called the\ngaba receptor opioids tend to work on\ndifferent kinds of opioid receptors but\nthe mu receptor is really really\nimportant and so we know from studies of\nneurobiology that when you regularly use\na substance\nour receptors will adapt\nto sort of develop a tolerance so\ncaffeine is another good example where\nwe'll develop a physiologic tolerance so\nwhen we start to use caffeine it can\nkeep us up all night but if we use it on\na regular basis then it doesn't keep us\nup all night in fact without it we start\nto suffer right so we experience some\nkind of physiologic withdrawal so there\nare some substances\nlike marijuana for example or even\nthings like pornography or video games\nthat don't appear to develop the same\nkind of physiologic tolerance and\nwithdrawal that things like alcohol and\nopiates develop so how do we sort of\nknow this or what's the argument for\nthis the first is that for example\nour gaba receptors get regulated so\nheavily that if you have if you're\naddicted to alcohol and you stop cold\nturkey the withdrawal that you go\nthrough can conceivably be fatal or not\nconceivably it really can be fatal and\nis fatal for\nan unfortunate percentage of people\nso what happens is literally when you go\nthrough alcohol withdrawal depending on\nwhat kind of tolerance you have how much\nyou've been drinking and genetics and\nother individual factors\nso alcohol kind of\nslows down neuronal activity so in the\nabsence of alcohol if you've kind of\nlike you know really really like\naccounted for the depressing effect of\nalcohol maybe this is the kind of thing\nwhere i should draw this out\nso let's do this so i'll explain we'll\nexplain physiologic tolerance real quick\nokay\nso\nlet's take a look\nhold on\nthere we go\nokay\nso i'm just going to explain this real\nquick\nokay\nthen we're gonna go back to the main\npart\nso\nlet's talk about physiologic withdrawal\nso let's say i use something called\nalcohol okay so here's my\nokay so here's the signal\nokay and then here's my response\nnow if i use alcohol which is a\ndepressant so the gaba receptor is a\nhyper polarizing\nreceptor so it's a chloride usually\nchloride ion channel is the simplest way\nto think about it makes it harder for\nyour neurons to turn on basically so\nwhen i add alcohol what happens is that\nalcohol essentially oh\nsorry hold on\ngigi\nokay\nso alcohol essentially does\nis\nit lowers the effect of the signal\nokay so alcohol artificially puts us\nhere\nso then our brain is like oh we're\nsupposed to be in the middle so what i'm\ngoing to do is i'm going to adapt\ni'm going to change the nature of my\nneurons i'm going to make them more\nsensitive\nbecause alcohol has a depressing effect\nso my physiologic adaptation is going to\nbe in this direction we can also look at\nsomething like caffeine\nwhere this is my normal function here's\nmy response\nand so what does caffeine do caffeine\namps it up\nright so this is\ncaffeine and so then over time our our\nbrain is like hold on a second hold on a\nsecond this is like we're too amped up\nlet's go ahead and adapt and let's\nlower our responsiveness so then what\nhappens is once you add the blue and\ngreen arrows together what you end up\nwith is you end up in the middle\nwhich is why if you look at issues of\nwithdrawal like without caffeine the\nreason that it sucks is like you operate\ndown here right so you're like you feel\nsluggish you feel slow and so what\nhappens in physiologic alcohol\nwithdrawal is you actually operate up\nhere\nand what does this mean practically what\ndoes it mean to like operate up here\nso what it means to operate up here\nis\nyou can actually have seizures so your\nneurons are so so excitable\nthey they depolarize so quickly that you\ncan get unregulated electrical like\nactivity in the brain and you can\nactually have a seizure\nand then remember neurons and neuronal\nfunctions and depolarizing cells are not\njust in your brain\nso you can also get\nproblematic or electrical activity\nwithin the heart and you can get a\ncardiac arrhythmia that results in death\nso this is why like when people say like\nmarijuana is not addictive\nwhat they're referring to is that this\nphysiologic process does not seem to\nexist with marijuana or it happens at a\nmuch much smaller level okay so this is\nwhat we mean by marijuana is not\naddictive\nbut\nthese things like video games like\npornography doesn't do this to your\nyou know\ndoesn't do act like this so in the case\nof opiates for example we'll get uh\nopioid receptors all over the body so\nwhat you'll see is you'll get things\nlike you know so opioids are\nconstipating\nthey will\nprovide pain relief those are two of the\nbiggest things\nthey'll also kind of slow your mind down\nso when people are going through opioid\nwithdrawal they experience the opposite\nof those things they'll have diarrhea\nsometimes they'll feel nauseous or even\nvomit\num they'll get sweaty they'll start to\nfeel like very agitated and restless\ntheir pain can actually become more\ntheir pain receptors can become more\nsensitized so opioid withdrawal is like\na very very unpleasant experience\num which which according to some people\nthat i've worked with is like worse than\ndeath\num the hands down the worst experience\nof their life is like the week or two\nthat they go through opioid withdrawal\nso\nthis is what we sort of mean by like you\nknow some substances are not addictive\nthey're not you don't develop a\nphysiologic tolerance\nbut we clearly develop dependencies\non these these\nuh other things like pornography\naddiction\num video game addiction things like that\nso then the question is okay like what\nis that kind of dependency and this kind\nof goes back to what we were talking\nabout earlier where\nwe use coping mechanisms to help deal\nwith negative emotions right\nso oftentimes what you end up seeing is\nif i'm using pornography to deal with\nnegative emotions so that i can function\nand focus and be productive and exercise\nand stuff like that right because i have\nall these kinds of like\nnegative stuff going on i'm unmotivated\ni'm ashamed of myself whatever and so if\ni use pornography it kind of like\ndeadens my mind a little bit get some\ndopamine spurts changes my thinking and\nthen like it kind of equilibriates me\nso what we tend to see is that those\nunderlying psychological things that you\nneed the coping mechanism to to cover\nokay\nthose don't go away when you stop using\nan addictive substance so forget about\nthe physiology for a second we're\ntalking about kind of the emotional\ncoping or the emotional dependence for\nlack of a better term maybe more than\nemotional\nidentity related thought related etc\nmental let's call it mental\nso oftentimes what you see is that when\nyou take an addiction away from someone\nor you don't let someone use an\naddiction\nyou see an upswing of those negative\nmental states which in turn means that\npeople will reach towards other\nbehaviors\nso oftentimes when you work in\naddictions what you find is it feels\nlike you're playing whack-a-mole where\nthe second that you control someone's\nopiate opioid use they'll start doing\nthings like self-injurious behavior\nso cutting or something like that so\nself-injurious behavior is also actually\na coping mechanism it's really\nfascinating when i talk to people who\nengage in self-self-harm\nif they're not actually trying to kill\nthemselves there's something about you\nknow\nself-harm can be incredibly focusing for\nthe mind and so remember that like our\nbrains will figure out like what works\nfor us and sometimes people who are you\nknow have such a negative emotional\nstate that they need something like a\nsensation of physical pain to obliterate\nall of their thoughts\nso the the third kind of thing the\nbucket here that that tends to pop up as\nwell is sometimes people also develop\nlike issues with eating disorders\nso the you know kind of the worst case\nscenarios are i mean if you're in this\nsituation it's not you're not hopeless\nor anything but as a clinician what can\nbe challenging to deal with until you\nunderstand this\nis someone who's got like two or three\nunhealthy coping mechanisms and the\nmoment you fix one\nthose negative emotions that were\nsuppressed by the addiction come roaring\nback and as those emotions come roaring\nback we start to engage in other things\nand that's what we see in this situation\nright so the person stopped\nwatching pornography or dealt with their\nporn addiction and their impulsive\nbuying behaviors\nincreased\nso for any given person it may be like\nyou know some combination of all of the\nabove right so some people engage in\nself-injurious behavior some people\nengage in video games\nsome people engage in pornography some\npeople engage in\nimpulsive buying some people engage in\neven like emotionally manipulative\ntactics to feel loved so this is like a\ncommon thing that you know people don't\nreally think about which is when i feel\nbad\nin order to get a sense of emotional\ncomfort sometimes what i'll do is like\nlean on someone else to provide that for\nme and sometimes that can be frustrating\nfor the other person or i don't know how\nto ask for it i'm not really aware of it\nso i'll engage in like emotionally like\nmanipulative behavior to evoke a\nresponse from someone else\nso the key point here is that those\nunderlying emotions that you're using to\ncope you can get rid of the coping\nmechanism and when you get rid of the\ncoping mechanism you may recalibrate\nyour neurons after a period of\nwithdrawal right so this is what\nneuroscience will sort of tell us so\nlike um you know we talk about this when\nwe talk about neuroscience a lot of\nneuroscientists will sort of talk about\nthis stuff right in terms of like your\nreceptors and stuff like that but\nclinicians will also appreciate like\nthat there's a there's kind of a\npersonal individual psychological\ncomponent to this\nand that component is what causes the\nwhack-a-mole sort of thing to pop up\nright because now like you used to deal\nwith this with pornography and now the\nporn isn't there anymore so like how are\nyou gonna deal with it we're gonna start\nbuying more\nnow the other thing that we tend to see\nwhich is also very common is this person\nis saying as i've quit pornography it's\nharder for me to exercise harder for me\nto study harder for me to focus i don't\nfeel motivated why is that well we sort\nof explain that right because the reason\nthat you use pornography is to get your\nmental state calmed down so that you can\nfocus your mind\nso as you remove that band-aid as you\nremove that coping mechanism expect all\nof this stuff to happen so expect first\nof all that you may start leaning on\nother unhealthy coping mechanisms\nyou may start to experience more mental\ndiscomfort\nthe good news with both of these things\nis that this is like there's good\nstrategies that you can use for this so\nthe first is this is why we teach\nhealthy coping mechanisms right this is\nwhy mindfulness is so big meditation is\nso big because if we want to bring that\nmental stress down\nand we don't want to use pornography if\nwe just take away the pornography\nthat stress will come back\nso that's where we can use something\nlike meditation to lower that stress\nover time that too has like a couple of\ndifferent\nangles to it right one is like\ndevelopment of empathy development of\ncompassion that's all like more mental\nstuff and there's also physiologic or\nneuroscientific stuff right so we'll see\nthat we'll disengage things like the\ndefault mode network we'll lower our\ncortisol or crh production which is\ncortisol\ncorticotropic releasing hormone\num will will sort of affect things\nphysiologically and will sort of affect\nthings kind of like more globally on a\nmental or psychological level\nso that's why developing healthy coping\nmechanisms is really really important\nand a big important piece of sort of\ncoming off of a dependence now you don't\nhave to develop a healthy coping\nmechanism it just makes it a lot easier\nokay\nthe second thing to understand is that\nat the end of the day\nwhy are addictions\nso difficult to get rid of\nand it's because of that internal\nemotional stuff right\nso like as someone who's done a lot of\nwork in addictions like the main thing\nthat i found is that you can go to aa\nyou can start this medication you can go\nto rehab\nthat'll all help\nright so those are all evidence-based\ninterventions\nor not evidence-based but\nevidence supported or evidence\nscientifically validated interventions\nthat's the right term\nthat work but the truth is it doesn't\nwork for everyone right so what's the\ndifference what's the difference between\nsomeone who goes to rehab for 30 days\ncomes out sober stay sober for a year\nand someone who goes to rehab for 30\ndays and like relapses like within three\ndays of coming out\nand some of that is luck some of it is\njust the role of the dice but some of it\nis actually the a big part of it is the\ninternal work right so what what is that\nemotional stuff that comes up we talk\nabout coping to kind of bring it down\nbut where are these feelings originating\nfrom and you can do that core work right\nso is it feelings of shame is it\nfeelings of i'm i've fallen behind i've\nscrewed up my life i'm so be you know\nlike\nthis person is better than me is it\ninsecurity is it a seeking love right so\nthis is all kinds of things that happen\nin addiction\nso a good example is sometimes you'll\nhave people who have a history of trauma\nwho really just want to be loved and\nwhen it comes to addictions it's like\nit's really easy\nto find someone who you can feel love\nfor if both of you all are addicted to\nthe same substance\nright like because then y'all are\ntogether you're in it through thick and\nthin you're together you're together\nyou're together you feel so good\nright\nlike like there are all kinds of other\nemotional needs that get met through\naddictions\nso you have to do that internal\nemotional work right so this is where\nwhen you think a little bit about let's\nsay impulsive buying or pornography or\nwhatever\nwhat are the actual feelings or mental\nstate that you're trying to improve\nright what is the experience\nof you off of your drug of choice\nso this is where like you know it's\ngonna be negative probably right but\nthen like you know is it anxiety and\nthen like then you need to ask yourself\nsure you can use a coping mechanism to\nkind of reduce it and hopefully through\nmeditation over time you'll you'll\nchange that core part that it's coming\nfrom\nbut in cognitive behavioral therapy\nthere could be some kind of schema in\nsanskrit we call it a samskar\nright so like what is it that you're\ntrying to fix and then where does that\nthought come from\nwhere did you start feeling that way how\ndid you start to think that way\nand so ultimately you know if i'm\nworking with someone for example who's\nlike\ni don't know like um let me just think\nof an example of someone who's\nyou know let's say like you're working\nwith an in cell\nand so in cells have all these belief\nsystems and those belief systems are are\nyou know there and sometimes they're\nalso using substances and stuff like\nthat and the reason is because when\nor doomer let's say so when i stop using\nthe substance all my doomer thoughts\ncome back right the world is going to\nend this is going to happen i'm never\ngoing to amount to anything and then so\nthen the question is like when did you\nstart to lose faith in the world\nright and how did you lose that faith\nand as you go\ntrack back to the source of your\nthoughts\nwhen did you start feeling this way when\nwhere did these thoughts originate from\ndon't worry about the evidence this is\nwhere a lot of people get tripped up\nright so like if you talk to someone who\nhas a negative scheme or a negative some\nscar they'll tell you about the evidence\noh because of this and like alphas and\nbetas and sigmas and they'll use all\nthis like pseudoscientific kind of bs\nright\nthey'll give you lots of evidence to\nconfirm their belief but you can try to\ndispute that if you want to you're never\ngoing to get anywhere the question is\nwhere did the original belief come from\nbecause our mind once we believe\nsomething our mind looks for\nconfirmation that's what the\nconfirmation bias is\nso if you're dealing with an addiction\na couple of things to keep in mind the\nfirst is that as you\nextract yourself from it it's going to\nbe a bumpy road\nphysiologically this is where you should\nactually see a medical professional so\nif you actually have a substance use\ndisorder you should absolutely see a\nmedical professional because some of\nthese things can be life-threatening\nyou know even in the non-substance use\ncategory can definitely help to see a\nmedical professional because they'll\nknow these kinds of things right they'll\nhelp you support you through that sort\nof stuff\nbut as you cut back on your pornography\nbe prepared for the other things to rise\nup and watch what happens right why are\nyou doing that when do you impulsively\nbuy it when you're emotionally not\nfeeling good\nrecognize that as that negative\nemotional stuff comes up there's going\nto be an impact on your productivity the\ngood news is that that impact is\ngenerally speaking temporary\nso in the same way that your brain will\nlike reacclimatize right so like our\nbrain develops a tolerance and if we cut\nthe substance that tolerance will go\naway over time\nin the same way you'll find a way to get\nmotivated again it'll just like your\nbrain will just kind of recalibrate it\ntakes longer though than some of these\nphysiologic\ntolerances\nso the physiologic tolerances can get\nbetter within anywhere from 72 hours to\nlike a week\nsometimes there are more like long-term\neffects of like sobriety like a month\nout three months out six months out\nyou'll start to see cognitive benefits\nand things like that people just feel\nbetter\nso you may be in for that you know\nmotivational slump for like a couple\nweeks month maybe even two three\nand that's kind of okay right so your\nbody has a natural tendency to heal so\njust have faith in that\nthe other thing is that if you lean on\nother coping mechanisms that\nequilibriation will happen less does\nthat make sense\nbecause now we're not needing to\nequilibria because we're just using\nsomething else right so even in for\nexample alcohol detox we'll give people\nparticular medications that work on the\ngaba receptor as a substitute for\nalcohol and slowly taper that down and\nthat's how you sort of safely detox\nsomeone from alcohol so if you're using\na substitute you know that's going to\nslow the process of equilibriation but\nit may smooth it out a little bit\nnext thing to remember\nis that at the end of the day those\nnegative thoughts you can\nuse an unhealthy coping mechanism or\ndevelop a healthy coping mechanism\nthat'll smooth out your kind of return\nto normalcy\nand then the last thing to consider is\nat the end of the day you may need to do\nthat internal like work right so the\nkinds of negative states that arise when\nyou are not using\nwhere do those negative mental states\ncome from where did they originate from\nwhat are your actual fears concerns et\ncetera and this is why\nit sounds kind of weird but like this is\nwhy like you'll see\ninternal emotional\nwork cathartic kind of work happen in\nbasically all fields of addiction\nrecovery so you can see a licensed\ntherapist right who will like talk you\nthrough that stuff\nhopefully accelerate the process but you\nalso see that things those kinds of\nthings in alcoholics anonymous where\npeople will go up and they'll say hi my\nname is olik i'm an alcoholic and then\nthey'll share\nright so there's some kind of like\nprocessing acknowledgment of negative\nfeelings\nemotional support camaraderie like so\nthere's there's some research even into\nthe common factors\nbetween like therapy and other things so\nlike how does alcoholics anonymous work\nhow does therapy work is there some\noverlap and it turns out that there is\nso you have to do that core overlap kind\nof work which is like internal emotional\nprocessing\nso\nif y'all are in this kind of situation\nit's really really common right so\nthere's going to be some neuroscience\nstuff going on but like try to develop\nhealthy coping mechanisms and understand\nwhat you're in for right so that's\nthat's the key thing that's the reason\nwe're really digging into this is like\nunderstand what you're signing up for in\nthe phases of it and what you can do to\nsort of reduce it\nquestions\nfood addiction is the same\nright so like food it doesn't matter so\neach of these things depending on your\nsubstance or your choice of addiction\nthe support that you're going to get is\ngoing to be like or the neuroscientific\nor psychological support you're going to\nget is going to be a little bit tailored\nto that thing so for example with food\naddiction we get a lot of very\nphysiologic signals of satisfaction\nwe also get things so i've seen this in\npeople who are addicted to food\nso when you eat a bunch of food you get\nan insulin spike\nif you eat carbohydrates that is when\nyou get an insulin spike right because\nyou get this peak of blood sugar your\nblood sugar shoots through the roof\nyou get\na surge of insulin\nas you get a surge of insulin you move\nfrom a sympathetic\nwhich is a sympathetic nervous system\nmode to a parasympathetic nervous system\nmode so remember in the paris in the\nsympathetic nervous system mode my\nanxiety is going to be worse my mind is\ngoing to be active\nright like i'm going to see danger is\nmore real all this stuff is in dr k's\nguide\nand when i move to a parasympathetic\nmode it's gonna slow my mind down\nright you go into food coma\nand so what some people with food\naddiction will do\nis they'll activate a food coma to slow\ndown their mind quiet their thoughts\nmake it easy for you to sleep\nright so we'll see like food addiction\nand insomnia kind of go hand in hand\nsometimes too\nbecause why do you have trouble falling\nasleep because my mind right\noh my god\ni have all these thoughts i have all\nthese worries and they're too much to\nhandle i can't fix them because when\nyou're going to bed at night you can't\nfix anything\nso any anxiety or thought that you have\nis going to be like\nhopeless\nright the future climate change and so\nyour mind gets ramped up you get\nsympathetically activated danger feels\nmore real\nand so when you food coma yourself\nall that stuff kind of chills out like\nwe're content\nright slows things down\nso in each of these addictions there are\ngoing to be unique\nimpacts on your body and mind and\nultimately overcoming each and every one\nof these\ninvolves understanding like what you're\nup against so then you can tailor things\nright so when i work with people who\nhave a food addiction one of the key\nthings that i target is insomnia\nand so if you can target that insomnia\nreally well then somehow it really seems\nto help them\nyeah right so someone's saying you know\nmasturbation before sleep it's another\nbig reason right so what do you do\nyou're all these thoughts and worries\nand then\nyou masturbate and then you get the\nsurge of dopamine you feel kind of\ncontent you feel a little bit sleepy so\nit's like it's almost like a\nself-medication right so you need a\nhealthier coping mechanisms you can\nmaybe do something like yoga nidra\nsometimes i'll prescribe medication to\npeople depending on the situation right\nso someone's saying this is so hard i\ncan't do it\nso\ni can empathize with that it is\ndefinitely very hard\nthe thing about a lot of this like\novercoming\nsubstance use or especially like the\nnon-substance use addictions\nwhat you really have to do\nthe main thing that you have to do is\nnothing\nso it's not\nit's the avoidance of behavior right and\nthat sometimes is the hardest thing of\nall\nlike what you have to do is just\ntolerate it because your body will\nrecalibrate\nit's just going to be really painful\ndoing nothing sucks yes it does\nsometimes doing nothing is the hardest\nthing of all\nthat's why it's so hard to meditate yeah\nso sometimes there's comorbidity with\ndepression and restless leg absolutely\nthis is kind of interesting there's a\npaper by\nlet me see if i can find this\nso there's a video in dr k's guide\nabout ayurvedic variants of depression\nand\nlet me see if i can find the paper\num\ni can't find it right now there's a good\npaper by f uh let's see if we can find\nit this way\ni know this is kind of a random question\nbut\nfava depression\nanchor attacks\nyeah so there's\num\n[Music]\nthis is interesting if you guys want to\nknow about restless legend\nso i think this is the original paper so\n1998 right so it's a little older but uh\nit's talking talking about anger attacks\nand depression the really interesting\nthing\nis that there's like um approximately\none-third of depressed outpatients\npresent with anger attacks\nso this is something that like is kind\nof confusing for many people a lot of\npeople who have clinical depression\ndon't realize because they don't feel\nsad what they do is they get pissed\nand they just have a very very short\nfuse\nand then they think they like kind of\nneed to chill out and stuff but like\nreally what it looks like is it it looks\nit resembles a clinical depressive\nepisode it just gets it manifests as\nanger\nso the interesting thing is that\nthere are some studies in this guy the\nguy who wrote this paper was telling me\nthat when he has patients who have\ndepression with anger attacks\nhe'll provide uh\ntreatments like repinerole which\nactually seem to help depression with\nanger attacks and repentant role is also\na treatment for restless leg\nso there's like some comorbidity there\nfor sure and we don't really know too\nmuch about it if you all have depression\nand russell's leg definitely go see a\npsychiatrist\nright and and look into that kind of\nstuff\nit's cool science is neat man there's\nlike so much information out there i\ncouldn't find the paper itself in in my\ndrive so sorry about that but that's the\nreference\nif you guys want it\nokay\nrestless leg syndrome is a neurologic\ncondition where your legs will just like\nkick\nlike so you know that sometimes you'll\nhave muscle twitches right so like\nsometimes we just like twitch so in\nrestless leg syndrome oftentimes when\npeople try to go to sleep their legs\nwill kick it can be quite profound um\ncan keep people from sleeping\nand can also keep people from sleeping\nnext to you\nit's actually quite debilitating like\nor it can be quite debilitating i should\nsay\nyou"
