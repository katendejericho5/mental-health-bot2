    "transcript": "like how'd you quit alcohol she's like i\nwoke up one day and just knew enough was\nenough it's like rng like loot box kind\nof business where it's like every day\nyour mind wakes up every day you get\nhammered and you vomit and you get an\nulcer\nyou open a loot box\nand in the loot box there's a one out a\nthousand chance that your mind will be\nlike enough is enough and then you won\nthere's actually a subconscious\nlike work that's being done like much\nlike your computer\nyou know i can look at the screen and i\ncan see an image but there's like\nthousands or millions of calculations\ngoing on the processor like all the time\nthey go to rehab two weeks they're clean\nthey leave they're clean for a week they\nrelapse oh crap back to square one and\nso this happens right they relapse go\nback to square one back to square one\nback to square one except it's not back\nto square one\ndoes dr k ever explain how people turn\nover new leafs\ni love seeing posts here or in reddit\nabout success stories or people who are\ndepressed\nand post before\nslash after photos of cleaning their\nroom or losing weight\ni always skim through the comments to\nfind out how\ni found out how they got their success\nbut if someone asks how they did it and\nthe op response they say something like\ni just got tired of having a shitty life\nand decided to change\nwhich is pretty worthless advice to me\ni'm tired of not being able to change my\nlife\nfor instance i'm so miserable in my\ntrash messy room\nand if i feel like i would\ndo anything to have cleaned it but i can\nnever get myself to clean it\nit reminds me of the motivation focus\nvideo where dr k where he talks about\npeople getting themselves to the gym by\nsaying just go to the gym which is what\nthey see but it's actually unhelpful and\nact in and inaccurate\nadvice for everyone watching\nany tips i'm so miserable i could\nlogically improve my life so easily but\ni if i could just get off my ass\nlike i know logically that cleaning my\nroom would only take a few hours\nand i have the time but never the\nmotivation\nas a result i have no control over my\nlife\ngreat question\neveryone's like turn over a new leaf man\ni woke up one day and i realized enough\nis enough i'd had enough\nthe question is like why couldn't you\nwake up yesterday and realize enough is\nenough\nwhy couldn't i wake up five years ago\nand realize that\nleague of legends i'm done with you\nright\nwhat the hell is going on you wake up\none day and your mind is just like yeah\ni had enough i'ma start living my life\nregular now\ndoes that work\nso good news is that we know there's an\nanswer to this question okay\nso the first thing to understand so\nwe're going to talk about addictions so\nthat's what i have experience in and i\nthink it really illustrates this problem\nwell\nit's one of the things that confused the\nhell out of me okay so i'm i'm trained\nto become a psychiatrist okay i'm not\nreally too interested in addictions by\nthe way so this is my first second year\nof psychiatry training i'm primarily\ninterested in complementing alternative\nmedicine\nso i'm like going to like\ndo like mind body stuff i was like super\ninto mind body stuff so i was like\nyou know working with patients with\ncancer and things like that\npain chronic pain all this kind of stuff\nright\nand then they're the addicts\nand some people really like addictions\nbut like\nlike homeless people coming into the\nemergency room they smell bad they're\naddicted they just come in week after\nweek after week they're using all the\ntime and like\nyou know\nthese are the people like ugh i can't do\naddiction medicine it smells too bad\nso then i talk to them\nand i get confused\nbecause sometimes you'll get someone in\nyour outpatient clinic right so like\ni'll see this homeless person who comes\nin every weekend because he's drunk\nand then like during the week i'll see\nsomeone who used to be drunk\nand i'll ask them so i remember there\nwas a\n50 year old woman who used to have a\ndrinking problem now she seems fine it's\nlike doesn't have a drinking problem\nshe's like coming in with like anxiety\nor whatever\nlike how did you quit alcohol she's like\ni woke up one day and just knew enough\nwas enough\nand i talk to more people and i'm like\nhow'd you quit alcohol they're like i\njust woke up one day and knew like it\nwas\nit was too much\nit had gone too far\nand i was like what's too far and\nthey're like i don't know i just woke up\none day and it was like i'd gone too far\nso i got i got kind of confused\ni was like what the hell is this\nlike some people just randomly what is\nlike a coin flip like it's like rng like\nloot box kind of business where it's\nlike every day your mind wakes up every\nday you get hammered and you vomit and\nyou get an ulcer\nyou open a loot box\nand in the loot box there's a one out a\nthousand chance that your mind will be\nlike enough is enough and then you\nwon right\nis that\nreally what is going on\nlike that there's got to be more to it\nthere's got to be some semblance to this\nright there has to be something going on\nso then i started learning some you know\naddiction psychiatry and we came across\nsomething called motivational\ninterviewing\nand the big thing that i learned is that\nour mind is subconsciously changing\nwithout our awareness this is the first\nthing to understand\nso\nwe sort of understand this kind of right\nso like\nyou know when you like are struggling to\nunderstand something and it clicks\nso that's like an example of i don't\nunderstand it i don't understand i don't\nunderstand and it clicks oh now i get it\nbut what is the process that is going on\nis it basically rng no there's actually\na subconscious\nlike work that's being done like much\nlike your computer\nyou know i can look at the screen and i\ncan see an image but there's like\nthousands or millions of calculations\ngoing on the processor like all the time\neven with with the monitor off there's\nlike stuff going on\nso your brain is the same way your mind\nis the same way there's tons of\nsubconscious processing\nthis is something that people with\naddictions don't understand and it\nreally causes problems so for example\nsome some people will like okay like\nenough is enough\ni'm gonna be sober they go to rehab two\nweeks they're clean they leave they're\nclean for a week they relapse oh crap\nback to square one\nyou go on a six-month binge\ncome back i need to get clean\nhow long were you sober last time i was\nsober for three weeks two of those were\nin rehab so i didn't have access to\nalcohol so really one week is what\ncounts okay let's give it another shot\ngo to rehab two weeks this time they're\nsober for two months\nthey relapse go on a binge\nfor eight months come back\nand so this happens right they relapse\nthey go back to square one back to\nsquare one back to square one except\nit's not back to square one\ni know it sounds kind of weird but your\nbrain is actually learning\nhow to relapse less\nthis is the skill\nright we think about sobriety and this\nis a problem with our conception so we\nthink about these things as binary\nturnover a new leaf is binary\nit's like clear progress from like a to\nb\nthe leaf is turned over\nit's done it's not like that the mind is\nfluid we're gonna flip that leaf back\nover and then we're gonna flip it again\nso what should you learn\nyou should learn the skill of flipping\nthe leaf\nbecause right now what happens is i flip\nthe leaf once i make progress i'm sober\nfor 30 days woohoo\nand then i relapse and then i beat\nmyself up\nnot only did i relapse now i have to\ndeal with the shame\nand the self-judgment of i screwed it up\ni had everything and i screwed it up oh\nmy god i screwed it up\nand then you need to drink even more\nbecause like now there's like not only\nthe addiction but now there's like the\nscrewed up psychology like the\npsychology of i screwed up there's the\nshame that goes with that there's the\npatheticness that goes with that there's\na sense of powerlessness that goes with\nthat we pile up all these negative\nemotions because we had turned over that\nleaf and it flipped over again and i am\nto blame\nand so it makes it twice as hard\nfirst thing you got to understand is\nthat turning over a new leaf is a\nprocess\nit's going to flip back over and we're\ngoing to learn how to flip it again\nit's a subconscious process\nit happens slowly so certain things that\nyou can do to accelerate it which we'll\ntalk about in a second\nso like turning over a new leaf is not\nlike something that you just do it's\nsomething that happens for a long time\nand then like\nit sort of gets done so like i almost\nsay it's kind of like you know when\nyou're microwaving something or like\nbaking a cookie say baking a cookie so\nyou put the cookie in\ncookies in the oven for 15 minutes ding\nyou open it now the cookie is cooked\nyou put in dough you get out a cookie\nbut eat\nyou know\nthe time that the dough goes into the\noven at the time that you pull the\ncookie out of the oven you're not aware\nof the change that going on but the\nchange is happening constantly in the\nbackground it's baking heating up\nmelting getting gooey\nthen it comes out\nand so what we see\nis we see the cookie dough\nand we see the baked cookie and you look\nat yourself and you say i have cookie\ndough you look over here and you say\nthere's this crispy chewy cookie in the\nmiddle chew in the middle crispy on the\noutside\nyou smell that cookie dough right\nbecause you can smell it\nyou can't smell the dough\nbut we're all ignorant of the oven we're\nall ignorant of the time it takes all we\nsee is the people who like go to the gym\nevery day we don't see the four years it\ntook them to start going to the gym\nwe don't see that right or sure we see\nthat but we see it and everyone who's\nnot at the gym you go to the grocery\nstore there's like a thousand people who\nare struggling to go to the gym\nbut we don't realize we don't connect\nthose dots so it's a subconscious\nprocess that happens slowly\nnow there are certain things that you\ncan do\nto facilitate this process and this is\nthe concept of stages of change in\nmotivational interviewing\nso there are people that are in five\nfundamental psychological stages\nokay the first is something called\npre-contemplative\ni'm not thinking about it yet i'm not\nthinking about turning over new leaf i\ndon't need to turn over a new leaf i\ndon't want to turn over any leaf this is\npre-contemplative\nin addiction we also call this denial\nthis person is in denial they don't\nthink they have a problem\nthey're not contemplating a change\nokay\nsecond stage of change is contemplative\nnow i'm thinking about it but i'm not\nready to make a change\nso there are advantages to turning over\nthis new leaf but there are also\ndisadvantages this is where most people\ntrip up\nbecause when we get to this sentence\nokay\ni'm so miserable i could logically\nimprove my life so easily if i could\njust get off my ass so what does this\nperson not understand\nthe downside of getting off of your ass\nright because they're seeing that\nlogically i could get all these benefits\nbut what does it cost you\nthis is the contemplative stage so the\ncontemplative stage is characterized by\nambivalence\nwhich means internal conflict\nand so what happens is people look for\nsolutions but internally they're not\nmotivated to change this is why the\nself-help industry is a thing\nwhy do people keep buying self-help\nbooks\nbecause self-help books give you\nsolutions that you're not going to\nengage in\nthat's how they work\nthey prey on the contemplative because\nremember the pre-contemplated person\ndoesn't have a problem so he doesn't\neven need the self-help book it's the\ncontemplative person who's not motivated\nto change but wants to change that will\nbuy the book that will make things easy\nfor me right that's what you're looking\nfor from a book\nyou're looking to magically remove the\ncost of changing\nso when you're contemplative you're you\nhave internal conflict so there's a part\nof you that wants to change there's a\npart of you that doesn't want to change\nthe problem is\nall we see is oh my god imagine how\nawesome my life would be logically would\nbe so much better if i could change if i\ncould change oh my god this would be\ngreat this would be great this is i\ncould do this i could do this i could do\nthis we never look at what it costs us\nto change and the truth of the matter is\nthat the cost of changing is higher\nthan the cost of staying the same that's\nwhy we stay the same\nwhy do you think people get it stay\naddicted to stuff it's because like as\nlong as i have the alcohol like\ni don't need to worry about my problems\nright so like now you give someone a\nchoice\nhey today i've g i give you a choice\ndrink this\npossibly you'll vomit but\nbut for the next eight hours you won't\nhave to worry about a damn thing\ni don't want to worry about anything for\neight hours let me i'll take the bottle\nbecause i don't vomit every time\nso we don't think about the cost we're\nstuck in this ambivalence there's a part\nof us that wants to change part of us\nthat doesn't want to change\nso what do you do if you're ambivalent\nthink about the cost\nright really think about like what would\nhappen if i changed\nwhat would i have to give up if i\nchanged\nthis is where like\nyour mind will say you there's nothing\nthere's no point you don't get anything\nfrom doing this of course you get\nsomething lose you would not be doing\nthis unless you got something from it\nand the more idiotic it seems the\nstronger the reinforcement is right so\nif we look at something like opiate\naddiction opiate addiction ruins lives\non a colossal scale\ni'm gonna get divorced my kids are gonna\nhate me i'm gonna burn through my life\nsavings i'm gonna lose my job i'm gonna\nget hiv i'm gonna get endocarditis\ni'm going to become homeless\ni'm going to be sexually assaulted\nyeah i'll take the heroin\nso what people need to understand is the\nmore you throw your life away\nthink about how much the heroine has to\ngive you\nin order to pay that price it has to be\ngreater than that we don't make trades\nright\nunless they're good for us as human\nbeings\nso if you're stuck you need to really\nthink about\nwhat do i get out of being here\nand you may say oh i get nothing i'm\nmiserable no you get something\nbecause here's what happens\nwhen you try to change you start paying\nthat cost and that's why you don't\nfollow through with the change\nbecause you start paying the cost and\nyou're like oh hell no\nright we talked earlier about someone\ngiving up weed because their anxiety\nwhatever that person does when they skip\na day of smoking oh hell no\nthat's what your mind says\nso you have to honor that part right so\ninstead of ignoring it\nrealize okay i'm really getting\nsomething\nthen you can actually make a choice\nright but you have to know what you're\npaying for up front and if you know what\nyou're paying for for upfront then\nyou're more likely to pay you're more\nlikely to follow through you're more\nlikely to actually turn over that new\nleaf\nbecause turning over the new leaf isn't\nthe problem the problem is keeping the\nnew leaf that way not flipping it back\nnot slipping back into patterns\nso instead of people are like oh how do\ni start going to the gym you've been to\nthe gym hopefully once before the\nquestion is why did you stop\nwhat happened within you that caused you\nto stop\nso after the contemplative phase comes\nthe planning phase is where people like\nokay like i really do want to change\npeople want to jump to one solution\nwhere that's where like at the planning\nphase we have to really think through\nour options what's the best way to\nchange what gives us the greatest chance\nfor success\nright how do i actually like should i go\nto the gym should i like\ndo crossfit should i order weights at\nhome should i do bodyweight exercises\nshould i do like\nfitness stuff on youtube should i get a\npeloton like what works for me so you\nhave to really think about your whole\nsituation what will set you up for\nsuccess the best then you give it a shot\nthen you go to the action phase fourth\ncognitive stage\nif you set up planning properly it'll\nmake your action more likely to succeed\nand then you enter maintenance or\nrelapse which is the fifth phase so\neither you're good then or you screw up\nand you kind of go back to one of the\nearlier stages\nlike ah it's not for me you're back to\npre-contemplative or like man that\nreally like i don't really want to do\nthat anymore there's a part of me that\nwants to be healthy but there's a part\nof me that doesn't i think it is our\nlack of awareness of internal conflict\nwhich is why it feels like there's an\niceberg underneath the surface when we\ntry to change because we're not aware of\nthat iceberg it's there we need to bring\nit to the surface\nthrough awareness and awareness of the\ncost is the first thing so if you're\nstuck and you want to turn over a new\nleaf the main question that most of you\nall probably need to ask yourselves\nis what is the price of turning over the\nnew leaf and you your mind will jump to\none answer\nand you'll think oh that's not specific\nlike you know that's easy price to pay\nbut then when you try to actually do it\nyou'll notice all kinds of other price\nprices costs that you didn't realize\nyou're gonna it's gonna be small stuff\ntoo it'll like nickel and dime you to\ndeath\ngoing to the gym means waking up at\nseven a.m holy crap i didn't even think\nabout that i don't wanna wake up at\nseven i'm not willing to wake up at\nseven\nwaking up at 7 means trying to go to bed\nat 10 pm which doesn't work because i'm\ntossing and turning all night\ni'm not falling asleep anyway let me\njust hop back on the computer let me\nwatch something\nit takes me four hours to fall asleep\nscrew that\nthen i'm tired the next day\nso then you're like mine is thinking\nlike why would i want to toss and turn\nfor four hours to not go to the gym next\nmorning because i'm too tired\nthat's the cost\nyeah you got to do that again\nbut i'm not even going to the gym yeah\nwhy the hell would i pay the price of\ntossing and turning for four hours if\ni'm not even going to the gym\nbecause if you do that enough maybe one\nday you'll go to the gym\n[ __ ]\nthat and that's why we don't change\nmakes sense\nso how do you turn over a new leaf try\nto think a little bit about where you\nare on the spectrum\nis it really a problem do you think it's\na problem\nare you conflicted\nand even after the conflict have you\nreally thought through the best way to\nturn over the new leaf right because\nonce again he's thinking oh turning over\nthe leaf is binary how do you turn over\nnewly no there's a thousand ways to turn\nit over right you can turn it over this\nway you can turn it over that way you\ncan turn it over this way and they all\nmake a difference\nfor your likelihood of success\nthen there's the action you really have\nto plan it out right what am i going to\ndo when am i going to do it where am i\ngoing to do it\nand then there's the action there's\nfeedback over the action it may not work\nit may work it may work partially okay\nlike how do we want to kind of change\nthat a little bit\ngriffin the mythic is saying dr k\neverything is so hard you're damn right\nit is\nbut only at the beginning\nthe realization that everything is so\nhard\nis\na consequence of awareness\nbecause our whole lives we try to forget\nand once we step into our like\nbasement which we've been throwing crap\ninto for a long time it looks\noverwhelming the good news is that it\nonly feels so hard at the very beginning\nthe only reason it's so hard is because\nwe've left we've neglected it for a\ndecade\nthat's why there's so much crap to do\nis if if you if you feel like it feels\nhard\nyou're on the right path\nyou can even let it discourage you but\ndon't let it stop you from acting do\nsomething\ntiny step tiny step tiny tiny tiny tiny\ntiny tiny tiny step\nkeep taking steps\nbecause then what you'll do is it'll\nstart to get easier\nand then it's like then you're off to\nthe races\nthen life becomes easy\nand i kid you not life can absolutely be\neasy life can be joyous life can be easy\nlife can be successful all of these\nthings are possible\nand the great irony is that it turns out\nto be a lot easier than most people\nthink\nam i sure in my experience yes does it\napply to you i hope so\nbecause it worked for\n100 people i've taught 1000 people i've\ntaught i don't know\n100 people sure\njust like most things in life once you\nget into it it turns out to be easier\nthan you expected\nisn't it always a bit scary though dr k\nnot always at the beginning sure\nthe beginning it's always scary when\nyou're ignorant it's always scary when\nthere's an unknown it's always scary\nbut once you know once you have\nexperience once you have confidence\nis there a danger sure but is it scary\nno longer because you have faith in\nyourself\nright then even the negative outcomes\nstop being scary\nbut there are tragedies that are too\ndevastating no they've been devastating\nthus far they don't need to be going\nforward\nyou"
