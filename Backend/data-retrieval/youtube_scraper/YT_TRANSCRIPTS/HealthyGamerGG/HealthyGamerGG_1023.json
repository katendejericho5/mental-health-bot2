    "transcript": "right so like you can't have an identity\nlogically\nlike you can never discover yourself\nthrough logic\nwho you are is experiential\non its fundamental level and you started\nthe interview with you know what do you\ndo when your work becomes your identity\nlike that's a logical exchange right so\ni can bucket you\nbased on your profession\nbut that's not really who you are like\nthat's the whole point of this\ndiscussion so when you're operating from\nthis upper level of like this is not who\ni am i'm more than my work whatever like\nyou can try to you can talk about it\nuntil you're blue in the face but you're\nnever going to discover yourself that\nway welcome friend thank you so much for\ncoming on today\nthank you for having me\num so tell me a little bit about what do\nyou what do you go by or how do you want\nto be\ncalled or addressed today\nyeah sure andy is fine andy okay so\nwelcome andy and is there something in\nparticular that you want to talk about\nor anything that we can help you with\ntoday andy\nuh yeah sure so\nuh\ni could probably sum it up by someone\nsomewhere said um the problem with\nsociety now is that when people ask you\nwhat you do\nthey're asking who you are\nand i'd probably\nidentify with that so i don't really\nhave a self outside of my career\nokay and that's kind of slowly dawning\non me as time goes on\nyou don't have a self outside of your\ncareer\nso i've done a bit of homework right so\ni watched a couple of a couple more\nvideos than usual i'm not a i've not\nwatched everything um\n[Music]\nand a couple of things stood out for me\nso you kind of\nhad a thought exercise i think um\nyou know asking what do you enjoy what\ndo you what do you what interests you\nwhat do you do for fun\nwhen was the last time you were\nintellectually engaged uh i don't i\ncan't really remember outside of work\nokay\nwhich is probably are the problem okay\nand is this\ndistressing for you in some way\nuh yeah\nyeah so i don't i guess i don't have a a\nme i don't have an identity and\nin terms of\nso i kind of\ni'm just floating down the river\nopportunities are coming my way through\nhard work and i take them because that's\nthe way the river's flowing\nyou've said things like this i think in\nthe past about you know being an analyst\nand then blah blah blah you're a exec\nyep um\nand that's fine and\nso that's what i'm doing but it seems a\nbit hollow so\nit's like if i was playing skyrim but i\nwas just\nlearning how to\nbe a blacksmith and there was infinite\nlevels of blacksmithing so i'm just\ni keep doing it and there's this whole\nworld there but\ni need the next level of blacksmithing\nand oh when does it end why doesn't you\njust kind of die one day and what was\nyour level of blacksmithing what was\nyour career position it's kind of\ntotally irrelevant\ngot it so i'm i'm kind of hearing you\nsay that\nyou know you you're climbing a ladder\nbut it's sort of like a ladder to\nnowhere and there are a lot of other\nthings to do besides going like kind of\nstraight up like you can go north south\neast east west you can\nsail you can hike but you're not doing\nany of those things you're just climbing\na ladder yeah pretty much\nand the thing that's stopping me\nuh\nseems quite simple isn't it so just work\nless and figure out what you'd like to\ndo\nwhen i work less i get anxious\nreally anxious i think you know well i\ndon't deserve\nthe job that i have i i'll never get the\nnext step if i don't keep working\nand part of this comes from i mean i say\nit a lot to\ndifferent people what frustrates me is\nthere'll be a problem and i might solve\nit eighty percent\nand it frustrates me that there was\nprobably a perfect set of actions or\nwords that would allow me to solve the\nproblem completely\nfor any any scenario in the world right\nwhatever it is\nand so i try to kind of outwork the\nthat issue because someone is smarter\nand they'll get 85 and someone else is\nquicker and they'll get 90\nhow do you feel when have you ever\ngotten 100\nuh\nyeah i've been 100 happy with\nyou know\nsolutions yeah yeah\nand how does that feel\nuh\nyeah like i put the work in and got 100\nyeah\nthat's what you did that's yeah how does\nthat feel\nuh like a relief\nokay\ndo you feel pride\n[Music]\nno\nno no really\nokay\nrelief\nfor perfection so when you when you act\nperfectly or\nwell it's not perfection but it's the\nclosest human equivalent that andy can\nattain\nyeah and you feel relief okay\nlike i worked\nmy deficits whatever they are for\nwhatever the problem is or i did reas\nthat was\nthat was good so i worked whatever the\ndeficits might be lack of experience or\nwhatever it is you know so you had\ncertain shortcomings and you overcame\nthem\nuh yeah yeah it does\neveryone does really\neveryone has shortcomings yeah yeah\ndoes everyone overcome them\nno i'm not overcoming them all the time\ni guess that's the problem it's kind of\nthis hollow pursuit what's hollow about\nit\nwell so\nuh\nwhat's all about it is\ni'm not happy\nhow do you know you're not happy\n[Music]\num because i feel\nthe opposite\nokay tell me about that help me\nunderstand that what do you feel\nuh\nwell like i don't know who i am i i\ndon't have anything to offer personally\nyou know i have a partner for seven\nyears and\nwork interferes with that and workers\ninterfered with\nother relationships and you know ruins\nthem\nand other stuff as well you know it's\nnot i'm glad i'm with you i'm weird i\ndon't have any regrets about not being\nwith people in the past but\ni'm not a very good partner you know\nisn't that a problem you can work on\nuh yeah it is but the\ni'm compelled to\nremain industrious and keep keep keep\nkeep my foot on the pedal\nwhat compels you to do that\ni don't know\nit's like emotion\nokay\nhow are you feeling right now andy\nuh\nyeah fine\ni noticed he started smiling somewhere\nin there\nyeah i don't know i just\nyou just asked me why i was compelled\nbut i think you know\nthat's i'm trying to say compelled\nbecause i don't know it's just a\nautomatic\ni think it's a very good word i think\nit's a\ni'm getting that vibe from you that\nyou're\nnot really in control\nbut\nyou're moving like you're the one who's\ndoing the moving you're just not sure\nwhy like i don't get the sense that\nyou're actually\nfloating down a river i think you're\nthere's a river that's moving in a\ndirection it's super shallow and you're\nactually walking down the river yeah\nyeah floating down the river sounds\nquite relaxing doesn't it yeah i don't\nthink that's exactly what's going on\nyeah there's a certain swimming pool i\ndon't know uh does it feel like swimming\nupstream\nor swimming downstream\nupstream\ni'm never gonna get you know it it's\nthat it's infinite isn't it you know\nthere's always there's always another\npromotion or another step on the career\nladder so\nyou know you yeah it's against the\ncurrent yeah yeah\nso you're unhappy\nyeah\ni know it's gonna be a weird hard\nquestion how do you know\nuh because i feel [ __ ] sometimes and\nthen i kind of get busy again\nah i see so tell me about what you feel\nwhen you're feeling bad like what is it\nlike\nhow\nif i were to\nbe telepathic\nor some could somehow\ninject my consciousness into your\nexperience\nwhat would feeling [ __ ]\nlook like what would i see is it\nthoughts is it physical sensations is it\nit's like a it's like an emptiness\nthrough\na sense of kind of wasting\nyour existence in the world and you know\nyou might have different views but you\nknow for me just one life so you need to\nkind of\nlive it and then\ni don't know how you know\nand i haven't i don't have any\npassions really i'm passionate when i'm\nat work i'm really passionate and really\nempathetic and\ni put in the hours to help my team and\ntry and make it\ntry and change the culture and improve\nthe culture and make every every\neveryone have a good work-life balance\nand you know everyone's happy and as\nhappy as you can be coming to work but\nit's i just don't i'm flat outside of\nwork\nokay\ncan you tell me a little bit about your\nwork\num\nand yeah what you want to know so i'm\ni'm uh\nbut actually before before we continue i\njust want to make sure about a couple\nthings so since we're going to be\ntalking about work i just want to make\nsure that what you share today is not\ngoing to like get you in trouble at work\nno it won't i won't say any okay\ni'm not hearing anything bad about your\njob by the way no no and if you know no\nit's it's not my job it's me you know\nit's not it's not it's not work\ninstructing me to overwork it's yeah\nit's quite opposite you know i get told\nby\npeople to just relax and do less you\nknow\nwhat does that feel like\nwell it's easier than done isn't it\nsure what what causes people to say that\nto you\num\ni don't know\nwhat what happens before they say it yes\nexactly\num\ni'll be discussing a problem in\na lot of depth so\ni'll want it i'll be wanting to solve\nsomething as it arises when it's not\nnecessarily\nurgent and important it might just be\nimportant\nsure\ni see so\nyou're working hard\nand i'm getting the sense that sometimes\nmaybe there are people around you who in\nyour shoes would not work as hard or\nwouldn't be solving\nnon-urgent issues that are important\nso like you don't have\nyeah okay\nand yeah so can you tell me just like\nwhat what you do\num\nyeah so i'm kind of relatively senior\nmanager\nof a\nlarge territory of\ndepots\nokay uh\ntransport hubs\nokay\nso i have a i have a region that i\nmanage with uh\nmanagers within there and then teams of\ndrivers and how did you\ncan you tell me a little bit about\nhow long you've been in this field\num\nyeah\n10 years 10 years in the in the field\nand what was the first thing you did in\nthe field can you like walk me through a\nlittle bit about your career trajectory\nyeah sure so uh\ni used okay\ni used to i used to work from\nhome doing something different\nmaking not very much money but you know\nit was actually editing you know\nmanuscripts and things like that and\nthat's what i love and i think i still\nhave it well\nit's what i loved to do i guess i'm not\nsure i love it now i don't think that\nwas a slip of my subconscious\nyeah you can't you can't say that you\nlove something\nyeah andy that's not allowed\nno no i just i i'm not sure if i i don't\nthink i do now i don't think it's\ni don't think it's important to success\nto be grammatically correct\nbut anyway\ni started as a\nuh\nyou know an admin assistant a bit of a\n[ __ ] you know just do whatever anybody\nwants\num\nand\nvery quickly\nbegan managing the site\nquite luckily\nmy dad got me that job that was pretty\nlucky so i kind of happened upon it and\nthen worked hard\nto\nget the you know be the manager it just\nkind of happened actually sure i didn't\ntry and didn't work towards it it just\nkind of fell in my lap actually and and\nso you were an admin assistant then you\nstart sort of\nit sounds like you applied yourself\nthere\nno not really actually it just happened\nto be good at it at the time so at the\ntime i'm\nmaybe i'd look over to them at the time\ni was 21\ni didn't really care that much you know\nkind of go and\nlive life and\nhave you know girlfriends and whatever\ngo out drinking with your friends and\nthings so i probably wasn't a very good\nemployee but i did get lucky and get the\njob here okay once i got the job uh you\nknow\nturned up for the pedal down i guess\nhelp me understand that what changed\nwhen you\nbecame a manager\ni think i've just said that and that's\nnot true\ni think i'm kind of as though i'm in an\ninterview so i'm talking about my career\nand i'm trying i'm automatically\nprobably giving you\na different version there um so i i\ndidn't i didn't apply myself actually so\ni was still\ni recognized the opportunity and i did\nwork harder\nbut i also still\n[Music]\nwas only 21 so\ni didn't have the skills to\ndo the job but they gave me the job\nanyway and i\ndid my best really\nokay so that's interesting so it sounds\nlike you're very good at noticing\nwhat you convey to other people\nand even though you may say something\ninitially from like a narrative\nperspective you're actually able to like\ngo back and say and kind of like\nself-edit and really share something\nthat's more correct\nwell\nyeah i mean i don't know why i just did\nthat it was kind of a reflex of\nwell i mean my girlfriend says to me\nsometimes i'll just use her name it's\nmichelle\num that i'm managing her so we'll be\nhaving an argument or just a\ndisagreement so you're managing me\nand she's probably right my language is\nstill you know i don't have a\nusually or very rarely have a\nwhen i'm at work i speak a little bit\ndifferently than this right i kind of\nspeak a bit slower and a bit higher\npitched and\nnot intentionally but you just do\nbecause i have a northeast accent a lot\nof people don't understand it\nuh\nand yes sometimes i speak to michelle\nlike that i guess how do you how does\nshe know you're\nis it like the tone and pitch of your\nvoice or the language you use or what\nprobably both yeah okay\nokay\nand then can you stop once she points it\nout to you\nwell at the time i say i'm not you know\ni don't realize that i am sorry\nbut i probably am here so where where\nyou've been promoted to manager at 21\nyou're\ndoing better\nin terms of applying yourself but you\nreally haven't\nbecome the person that you are today\nno no\nwhat happened next\nthat i started to receive promotions i\nguess i i don't know\nwhen did i kind of when did this happen\ni don't know he said you started to\nreceive promotions\nthat\nsounds to me like\ndon't floating downstream like oh like i\nwalked into work today someone was like\nhere andy have a promotion\nand then like a week later you're like\noh here andy have another promotion\nif only yeah no so uh yeah sorry am i\naudible by the way because i'm kind of\nslipping into\nthis draw tone\nso i'm i think i've covered by the way\nwhich is\nsounding a bit rough\nokay um\nso\nyeah well i earned them i guess i was\nthe best person at the time\ndo you\nfeel proud of that\num\ni feel an element of pride that i am in\nthe position i am now\nat my age\nit's quite unusual i think\nwhat's unusual about your position at\nyour age\num\n[Music]\nno none of my peers all my peers are\nyou know\n20 years older than me at least i hope\nnone of them watch this maybe might not\nbe 20 years but it looks to be 20 years\nokay\nso so it sounds like you're quite senior\ncan you give us a sense of and i'm\ntrying to figure out if you're\nme understand what how\nhow big of a manager are you\ni've put on 30 pounds in the last two\nyears so quite big\nokay\num\nno\nlike how many people do you manage\num so the team has\nmaybe\n200 250\nmaybe more fluctuates but about that\nokay\nso\ni asked you a question how many people\nyou manage\nand what was the sub since you're an\neditor what was the subject of the word\nof the sentence that you responded with\nwell my direct reports is are you asking\nme how many direct reports i have or\nhow many people i manage because i would\nmy\nsphere of influence or duty of care is\nall of them right yep\nhow does it feel to say that\num\nwell a bit\nbit cliche\nwhat's\nit's a bit corporate isn't it you know\noh i i feel a sense of care for all my\npeople but it's true i do you know\nyeah so it's weird because i so i ask\nyou how many people you manage this is\nwhat i was zeroing in on you didn't say\ni manage 250 people or i'm responsible\nfor 250 people you said\nthat team is\nyeah okay do you see the difference\nbetween those two things\nwell yeah they're not my direct report\nso i don't\nmanage them all thankfully you know\nso so i think that there's that element\nto it but i'm noticing that like you\nremove the first person from a lot of\nwhat you say\nespecially if it has to do with like\nlike you're like\nannoyingly humble\nokay and i don't mean like i'm\npersonally annoyed by it but i mean like\nit's like it's\nexcessively humble\nright\nwhat do you think about that\nannoyingly was a bad word\nno no it's i'm not you know\ni don't that doesn't sting me at all um\nwhat do i think about that\ni don't know it kind of is what it is i\nam where i am\nokay good so so and i think this is\nwhere you know you you make com so like\nthere are other people i'm guessing\nyou're somewhere around 30 we don't have\nto get into your exact age\num\n31 very very important you know okay\nso i think there are a lot of 31 year\nolds who if they were responsible for\nmanaging let's say 250 to 300 people\nwould be egotistical about it right\nso you're you kind of point out and i\nthink you sort of own these as facts\nyou're just like my peers are 20 years\nolder than i am so like okay\nthe reason i'm zeroing in on this is\nbecause like if we think about your\nproblems you don't know who you are so\nwe're dealing with issues of identity\nand personhood\nyeah and so some people get egotistical\nif they're 30 year old hot shots\nbut your pendulum is swung the other way\nright which is i still think it's like\noff balance\nbecause i'm noticing that it's almost\nlike i really have to like\ndig to get you to own something good\nthat you've done\nlike you're very like there's there's a\nthird person this or a passivity\nthat i'm noticing is like a theme does\nthat make sense like i\nyou know i kept getting like people kept\ngiving me promotions it's like\nno i mean you probably aren't like\nassuming\nyou see what i'm saying so so i i can\nsee that\nso piece of that is that okay i don't\nwant to come across as arrogant and i'm\nnot genuinely arrogant fine\nbut i'm wondering where since you don't\nknow who you are it's almost like you're\nremoving yourself from the from your\nstatements\num i think a part of me is thinking and\nthe chances are really slim\nyou know let's say someone who knows me\nis watching and then says you [ __ ]\nthat head you know\ni guess i'm just realized that that's in\nthe back of my head yep right so that's\ngood to realize that\nyeah but but i don't but i don't\ni think that i don't care about that\nthough i wouldn't care if someone\nthought that\nyet it's in my head so yep it's\nabsolutely shaping your language i i\nthink that anyway\nright so so like and and that's sort of\nhow this works but\nyou want to say something well\nobjectively you know i'm\ndoing really well i know that you know\ni don't have much more to add that do\nyou feel pride there\ni feel lucky\ni feel fortunate\nthere's that passivity again you see\nthat\nthere isn't any you in the equation\nwell you've got to be good but you've\ngot to be lucky\nso there's a lot of elements of luck in\nmy career\ni've had i've been looking to have\ngood good bosses sure i've been i've\nbeen lucky to have you know be ready at\nthe right moment for something that was\nyou know really\nunusual to have occurred in the business\nsure so so\ni agree with you that you've got to be\nlucky and you've got to be good which\none do you keep talking about\nyeah being lucky\nright so like i'm i'm not saying it's\nright or wrong i'm just pointing it out\nto you\nso so and once again because we're sort\nof saying like i don't know who i am and\nlike we're not hearing anything about\nyou i mean the way that you talk about\nthis\nyou know you'll you'll sort of like\nyou know\ni didn't work very hard\nmy dad got me like so you share that\ndetail\nyou share like the one detail from the\nlast 10 years\nthat you don't get to take any credit\nfor\ninteresting yeah and i imagine over the\nlast nine or ten years like you've done\nsomething right and if i push you on it\nyou'll admit it because you kind of know\nthat that's right but there's something\ngoing on in your mind\nthat removes\nyou from the equation\num okay so i guess i feel it's all\nit could all just\ngo you know i could [ __ ] up or\nsomething could happen and it all just\nfalls down i'm not\nso while i'm saying i i don't have an\nidentity\num\nand my identity is my work i also feel\nlike that can go at any moment\nso\n[Music]\nyeah that it's not it's not so it would\nbe\nit would be\nso i don't feel like\ni\ni don't feel like there's anything to\nbrag about because it can just go you\nknow yeah just\nyeah yeah yeah so good let's dig into\nthat for a second okay and i gotta ask\nyou about your upbringing at some point\ndon't let me forget\nso\nlet's think about what your mind is\ndoing\nby no so\nwhat i'm hearing you kind of say is okay\ni i'm pointing out to you\nandy you're not letting yourself have an\nidentity or any kind of pride\nabout work\nright i'm sort of saying you're removing\nyourself from that equation is that\nclear\nit may not be right\nlet's know okay\nif it could all go up in smoke\nhow does that tie into your mind being\nunable\nor trying to resist\ngiving you a work-based identity\n[Music]\ncan you repeat that yeah\nit's i'm\nthis is a sort of a i'm pushing you here\ni can just explain it\nagain\nso you so i asked you why don't you let\nyourself have an identity about work\nright why don't you own your why don't\nyou feel pride you sort of admit i can\ngrudgingly push you into admitting that\nyou're proud\nbut generally speaking i keep getting\nlucky my dad got me the job i just kind\nof showed up i don't know i'm the\nyoungest like a manager of 250 people at\nthe age of 31 and when i was 50 like i\ndon't know i got lucky\nright so there's no there's no i\nownership\npride\nokay so\nthen when i ask you about that you say\nwell it could all go up in smoke\nso how are those two things related what\nis your mind doing by not letting you be\nproud of your work\nif i if i draw a painting\npaint a painting\nit's there you know i've done it\nit's just uh\na more\nit's tangible and it's and it exists it\nmight get you know burned down or\nwhatever but it exists and you did that\nyou know a painting it could i'm trying\nto think how you destroy a painting but\nyeah and try to spend down on it\nbut you did that and it's just it's this\nthing\nit's a snapshot it's done\nthe career is\never moving isn't it so sure\nthere's not a there's not a\nthere's nothing it\nobtained\ni'm struggling with my life\nit feels like there's no there's not\ni'm struggling no\nyou're doing great so i i think you've\nconveyed it so what i'm getting is that\nwith a painting it's tangible\nright\nyou can say i built this\nso there's something concrete\nthat your pride can rest on there's a\nfoundation\nyeah\nbut a career is fluid\nand if you were to base your identity or\ntake pride in your work\nwhat does that open up\nopen you up to that a painting you know\nbecause a painting is safe in that way\ndoes that make sense\nyeah well\nyou you've\nyou get wrecked on you\nabsolutely\nso\ni think that's important because i i\nwonder if what you're doing is like\nyou're not letting yourself have an\nidentity that could be taken away from\nyou\nwell i don't want my identity to be work\nthough\nokay\nso that's fine too\nwe'll get to that in a second but yeah\nare you okay with a part of it being\nwork\nwell yeah it's\nyou know the majority of my time so\nwe'll be going it will be possible no i\nmean you're actively fighting against\nthat right so that's that's because you\ndon't own what you do at work\ni mean you do like practically but like\nyou know i i think what's going on here\nis that that i think you're afraid of\nletting a piece of your work uh your\nidentity be your work for two reasons\none is\nbecause you don't want it to you're\nafraid maybe that all of your identity\nwill be work based then and you don't\nwant to be one of those people and\nyou're trying really hard to not be one\nof those people\nwhich is good in a sense but i think the\nother part of it is that i'm sort of\ngetting a sense that you don't want your\nidentity to be based on something that\nisn't a strong foundation\nbecause if if work blows up in your face\nthen your identity goes with it\nyeah okay what do you think about that\num\nyeah\nokay yeah if i if i kind of built my ego\naround it\nthat would\nthat would be unfortunate wouldn't it\nyes that would be and i don't think\nyou're willing to risk that what do you\nthink\ni don't know what\nattaching my ego to work looks like to i\ncan't even i can't even comprehend it\nreally to understand\nto answer\nokay\nso i can't i don't i can't uh\ni can't understand what avoiding that\nis looking like other than through the\nconversation yeah yeah okay that makes\nsense so that that's that's a completely\nacceptable answer so i'm going to just\nsort of ask you one kind of like\nquestion one more time do you let\nyourself\nfeel pride\nyeah i'm really competitive you know\nand\nwith shallow things you know if i\nmake a better sandwich\nyou know anything you know\nyou know hell yeah i tied those shoes\nyou know\nokay\nhow do you feel when you do that\nuh\nyeah\ngood usually it's jovial isn't it well\nalways yeah yeah so you're competitive\nso there's usually there so that means\nthat like you take pride in things when\nyou out perform other people\noh definitely yeah\nespecially at work yeah\nor secretly you know\nokay\nso i'm writing and no one else knows huh\ni'm i'm kind of racing and no one else\nknows\nwhat does that feel like to be\nno but\nsilly i guess yeah what's silly about it\num\nwell\nit's not a real victory is it if no one\nelse is racing you\nbut\ni like to be\ntry to be you know the best at whatever\nit is\nwhatever it is you know anything\nand the other thing and i've had to let\ngo of that a little bit just for time\nuh i'm spending too much time at work so\ni have to think sometimes think [ __ ] it\njust send it out or\nyou know\nrelatively inconsequential things\nwhy do you think you\ncompete with other people who don't know\nthat they're competing\nwell everyone's competing really\neverybody\nit's a you know everyone\nhas a ranking of competency don't they\nsure\nand so it's just chipping away that\nnot chipping away then but kind of\nchipping my way up\nyeah so i uh andy this is going to be\nhard but i hear two parallel\nconversations\nso there's like the reality of things\nwhich your mind says logically and then\nsometimes when we're talking to you\nyou dig a little bit deeper and there's\nlike more emotion you'll start to grin\nright and then yeah i'm trying i'm\ntrying you know i'm trying but yeah i\nthink you're doing great i don't mean to\nimply that what i'm saying is that i i\nthink this is exactly what's going on is\nthat you've got this surface level\nconversation\nand then sometimes if we ask the right\nquestion like we'll get some life\nwell like you know you know and so then\nyou'll kind of grin and you'll sort of\nsay like\nit's not really fair if if you're\nrunning you're the only one who knows\nyou're running a race right and there's\nalmost this like mischievous\nlittle yeah\nbut but i i get i get life from you\nthere\nand then if i ask you about it you'll go\nto like\ni'm trying to\ni'm trying to think really hard to\nanswer the question\nand\ni don't want i\ni have i have a bad habit of joking too\nmuch\npersonally\nbut personal life okay not\num\nyou know never serious blah blah blah\nhas been the motif in my personal life\nprobably so can you just take something\nseriously\nwhereas at work it's actually the\nopposite you know\nwhat's the opposite at work\nuh\nnot as\nwell more serious more stoic\npragmatic\nso you joke too much\nin your real life and you try to reign\nthat in\nyeah\ni don't try it just\nhappens now i guess\ni don't think i won't say that actually\nsometimes i do think that yeah oh i\nwon't say that that'd be really funny\nbut i'm not gonna say that sometimes\nit's really immature like that's what\nshe said but you just can't say those\nthings and\nin the type of meetings i'm in\ni would love to but\nyeah\nyeah\nokay think for a second\nyes\nokay\ncan you tell me a little bit about um\nwhat what yeah\nwhat growing up was like for you\nyeah really good great childhood\ntell me about that\num\nuneventfully\nstereotypical you know going out with\nfriends and doing whatever until they\ngot dark you know\ni sound like a boomer a little bit maybe\ni'm not a boomer i'm 31 but you know\njust going out and doing stuff before\nthat you know\ni'd had you sound like a boomer because\nyou use the word out\nyeah yeah yeah i'm envisioning that you\nwere outside with other humans\nyeah yeah yeah yeah which makes you a\nboomer\nbecause that's what the boomers did\nyeah so uh you know going out and\nplaying and coming back and\ngetting dirty and having my own room and\nhad a pc and\nmy dad did everything he could to you\nknow\nbuy things for us\nokay so what was your family situation\nlike at home\nuh yeah mum and dad\nin love you know for the most part yeah\nand any siblings\nuh\nyeah uh abrasion\num\nand\nare your\nand it sounds like your dad worked and\nyour mom was at home\nuh for the most part yeah in in memory\nyeah i think she worked a little bit\nwhen i was really young but yeah yeah so\nmy dad worked all the time and i'm\nmodeling myself with my dad and i'm\nworking loads you know\nhow are you i don't\nknow i think so yeah so well so i\nlike i said i try i don't self-reflect\nbut i tried to ahead of the call\nyou know to sit down and think about\nstuff\nyou don't i self-reflect\nwell i do i do in my career\ni do notice you know what skill do i\nneed for whatever's next but i don't\nreally sell like that at home until\nuntil i've realized well i'm not [ __ ]\nhappy here what the hell is going on\ni need to do something about it which\nand then i was just happened to be on\nyoutube saw one of your videos again so\ni'll just\ni'll ask the man you know sure\nso\nso yeah so then i did some\nself-reflection and i kind of thought\nabout you know\nmy dad and\nwell actually first first of all i moved\nfrom what makes me happy to what makes\nme sad because i couldn't think of a lot\nof things that made me happy\nand\nthe main thing i could the main thing i\ncame up with is films i don't know if\nit's superficial to cry at a film and\nthat's not like real emotion or\nsomething if it's tapping a vein of\nsomething but i kind of wrote down the\nfilms that made me cry\nand they're all films\nso one is fences have you seen fences no\nit's it's a film with denzel washington\nin which is not relevant uh and he's a\nuh\nit's the 19 something 20s or 30s or\nsomething like that and you know\nhe's a\nobviously a\nblack man he's a\nparent of a son\nand i i do forget the\nwhat time it was but essentially the dad\nis living in one\nworld which is the world where\nthings are not fair and you know he'll\nhe will only advance so far because of\nsystemic racism and the sun is you know\nthere's still\nit must not it can't be 1920s but\nhe's kind of getting a potentially a\nfootball scholarship and\nhe's living in a slightly different\nworld with slightly more opportunities\nstill [ __ ] you know still not right\nbut\nand then so they're different in that\nway\nand there's a scene there's a scene in\nthat film where\nhe says to his dad you know why don't\nyou like me\nright because the dad's just\non him all the time could be disciplined\nand stuff and there's no parallel left\nmy dad by the way but\nhe says\ni don't have to like you i [ __ ] i\nwork all day i put clothes on your back\ni feed you you know who says i gotta\nlike you who what lawyers say that sort\nof gonna like you it's always kind of\nit's just duty and anyway he's not happy\nhe cheats on his wife it's all [ __ ]\neveryone hates him he but all he's done\nis he's\nit's just worked and worked and worked\nand he dies obviously because everyone\ndoes in the film\nand it's just so tragic that he's just\nworked and worked for the sense of duty\nworked and worked and then he's just\n[ __ ] dead\nnot only is he dead\nbut the people he worked for as in his\nfamily\nkind of hate him\nor hated him at one point you know i've\nnot seen the film for a while but that i\nwas\nbawling my eyes out like never before\nthat film and thought immediately that\nmy dad just works all the time and\nworked for the family and\num\nit was there was a so there's a parallel\nwith the work ethic but not with but he\nwasn't he didn't treat me in that way\nso you never felt like your dad didn't\nlike you\nno never yeah and uh\nno love to me unconditionally no matter\nwhat yeah absolutely\nand then you know it was just other\nfilms and they were all about\nfather-son relationships i i guess a bit\nweird\nwhat's weird\nwell it's just weird isn't it that's\nreally specific thing to just tap it\nto have a toothache about you know\nright\nokay\nif you say so\ni i don't think so so\nwell it's you it's not\nso it seems like\nthose kinds of\nas they strike a chord with you\nyeah they strike a chord with me yeah\nthey hit a they hit a nerve you know\nthat's why i'm saying toothache you know\nthey just yeah yeah and but why do you\nthink that's weird\nbecause i don't know why\nokay\nbut it won't be that it'll be some\npeople will but it'll be something else\nmaybe the reason it's weird is because\nit actually does not mirror your\nexperience\nbecause you do have a dad who loves you\nand supports you and stuff like that\nyeah but the bit that's tragic is just\nworking and working and working and\nworking and then he'll die one day right\nso i speak to my dad now right and he\nworks he's changed careers\nand he he works monday to sunday\nevery week\n10 11 12 15 16 17 hours he just keeps\nworking he can't sit down\nand watch a film unless it's\nspartacus he might watch that but other\nthan that he just works all the time and\ni i say to him don't you want to stop\nand you'll say oh\ni'll just make money for your mum and\nthen\nwhen i'm dead she'll have enough money\nto be okay that's all he says\nkind of half joke but\nhe's still doing the hours so it must be\ntrue\nand what did you think about that\nwell it's freaking tragic isn't it i\nwish my dad would come on\nthis show but he never ever would\nbecause that would be great stop him\nfrom working all the time\nbut then i'm doing the same i guess\nwhich is i guess yeah i was gonna say i\ni don't know if if\ni don't know if what resonates with you\nis your relationship with your dad i\nthink what you what could be resonating\nwith you is your relationship with your\nson\nwell he's\nhe's in a sock on the floor i don't have\none yeah not yet\nbut what do you think you're afraid of\nwhat would it like if you had a son\nwhat would it be like\nwhat would your relationship with him\nlike\nthat'd be a pretty good dad i think\nwould you be working 12 14 15 16 hours a\nday\nno i don't i don't that i don't do that\ni don't work that much my dad never used\nto work that much that's a new thing\nit's going to last few years he used to\nwork a lot he used to work away\nyou know\ntruck driving so kind of be out at night\nand things\nbut he was a he was around he was around\nyou know sometimes what was it like\nhaving a dad who was around sometimes\num unimpactful i don't know\ni think\nyou know there's different parts of your\nchildhood that you remember more right\nso yeah i do have resolve you know uh oh\nwe would we were doing this on this day\nwe were going to the shop we're going to\nbuy some pokemon cards or something but\nthen he's busy so he's not going i've\ngot a few memories like that but for the\nmost part\nhe's around and we did stuff yeah\ndifferent times of the\nmonth i'm hearing that he was a good dad\nit was great yeah\nbut there's a kind of sacrifici\nsacrificial element to it don't you\nthink in being a parent\nsure i'm not one what do you think he\nsacrificed\nwell\nwell it's like the guy from fences it's\nyour your duty is to just\ncrack on and keep working even if the\njob [ __ ]\nyou just got to work haven't you because\nyour kid wants new nike\ntrain sneakers sure so what did he\nsacrifice\nuh\ni don't know whatever his passion was\nwasn't truck driving\nright yeah so and that's kind of tragic\nisn't it\nuh\nthat is a tragedy but that's a that's\nkind of a shared tragedy isn't it that's\nthe human experience i think for the\nmost part so it's a bit muted well it\nsounds like it's your dad's experience\nand possibly yours\num\nyeah maybe but i'm not working through a\nsense of duty i'm working through a\nsense of\nanxiety really if i stop that often\nstart getting worried\nwhat happens when you try to take a\nbreak\nwhat mounts up\ndoes that really okay\nuh or does it feel like like when people\nsay you can relax\nor that you can work less and you said\nyou get anxious and then you talked a\nlittle bit about feeling like you don't\ndeserve things\num\nwell it just comes back to the kind of\nfluid fluidity of your\ncareer and it can\nend at any moment well not\nknow if i can help it you know\ncan't think for a second\nyeah please\nthis is tricky andy\nbecause i think i have a sense of what\ncould be going on i just don't know\ndo you think that films can be formative\nfor you if i think about something like\nthe lion king which is up i know this is\nreally silly\nalways been my favorite film of all time\nknows will be\nand that's the same isn't it so that's\nyou know i'm sure have you seen the lion\nking yeah\nyeah so you know\nthat's again the same thing isn't it\nsense of duty\nyou die for your son\nthat thing\nyeah does that form i don't know i i\ndon't i don't know why that ended up on\nmy notes when i was kind of\nbrainstorming but okay it was just this\nconnection between fences which made me\nbawl my eyes out and the lion king it's\nkind of roughly the same just a dad who\nsacrifices everything\nso what i'm hearing from you is that\nin your life\nthere is not an experience that clearly\nties into what deeply resonates with you\nabout film\nyeah\nthat's why it's weird\nyeah that you feel the most alive\nwatching these movies\nyeah probably okay\nyeah what's alive\ni don't know probably yeah that stings a\nlittle bit but probably right here yeah\nokay\nis there something i should have asked\nyou about\num\nthat's a good question isn't it but no\nokay\nso like there isn't like something that\nsome experience like how does your dad\nfeel about the work that you do\ni'm really proud yeah that my mum and\ndad are really proud of me you know\nwhat's it like\nyeah\nyeah yeah\nthey they love me you know my mum finds\nme i'm the funniest person in the world\ni'm\nnot so much to michelle you know\nyou know\nshe doesn't really think my lanking\nimpressions are very good but my mum\ndoes you know\nokay\nall right um\ni don't think i have any skeletons in\nthe closet or you know yeah\nyeah that i'm getting that sense\nso\nhow do you think it would feel to be\nmufasa\nor denzel washington\nuh pretty tragic\nwell no mufasa is not tragic that's a\nlittle bit different isn't it but then\ni'll watch it uh yeah the dad didn't\nfences yeah it'd be pretty brutal\nwouldn't it\nyou just waste your life and then you're\ndead\ni mean that's what we're that's what\nyou're\ndoing\nthat's what i'm saying that's why that's\nwhy i'm saying that resonated with me is\nbecause\noh well i don't think i was saying that\nbut i realized i've said that's what i\nsaid yeah yeah i mean that's what we're\ntalking about so i don't think it's\nweird at all\nbut it's not a sense of duty i don't\nhave a sense of duty to anyone\ni don't have a kid i'm not working so\nwhen my kid's born i'm making\nsix figures\nare you gonna\ni mean you don't have to answer this but\nhave you thought about having children\num\nonly only when self-reflecting\nno only because i noticed that the films\nthat made me cry you there's a\nrelationship there's a there's a father\nson or a mother or a father daughter\nrelationship or a mother-daughter\nrelationship and some of them and all my\nfavorite films actually\nkind of\nhave that relationship in them like\ninterstellar is all about father's love\nfor his daughter isn't it yeah that\nscene where he's like yelling at himself\nnot to leave and all that good stuff\nyeah powerful stuff\nyeah yeah yeah things like that yeah\nyeah\nandy what's your\nhelp me understand are you like\nreligious or spiritual what do you\nno is it the fleece\nwhat\nis it the fleece thank you see that that\nmade you ask that no glasses\nokay what is the fleece in the glass is\nthat a joke i don't get the joke no it's\nnot no no no someone asked me if i was a\nvegan\nuh when i had this fleece on with these\nglasses and i suppose they are a bit\nhipster but\ni don't mean to install religious people\nthat they're hipsters by the way\ni'm not religious at all\nnot in the slightest\nokay\num and\nwhat do you think happens after you die\nyeah don't you\nnothing happens\nhow confident are you in that\nyeah 100 well you know\ntechnically everyone's agnostic who's an\natheist aren't they but you know 99.9\nokay you know it wasn't the case you\nknow i wish i could take a pill and\nbelieve in the afterlife that would be\ngreat wouldn't it\ni\ni don't know i've never thought about\nthat so let me\nso here's here's the thing\ni'm not sure that asking you more\nquestions so sometimes i interview\nsomeone and like it's pretty easy to\ntell what's going on and we kind of\ncrack the nut pretty simply\ni think i have a good sense of what's\ngoing on i don't know that\ni'm going to be able to ask you a series\nof questions that will get you there\nokay i think i can explain it to you\nbut i don't know that socratic\nquestioning\ni can't see a way to get you to where i\nthink you are\ni can explain it to you yeah please tell\nme i'm just gonna so it's just it's\ndifferent because sometimes like we get\nthere through like realization and\nquestioning but like so what i'm gonna\noffer you is something of like a\nhypothesis\nand the hypothesis is going to have some\nstuff that i think is like pretty\nreliable and some stuff that is\ncompletely unreliable and out of this\nworld\nokay\nso the first thing is that i think you\nactually systemically move away from\nyourself\nlike\nyou know you feel hollow and dead inside\nand we actually see that like if you go\nback and you just watch your face like\ndon't even listen to the words\nyeah\nlike\nwatch this video on mute and even now\nlike i'm\nscratching something right so when i\nlike you're hollow and dead inside\nyou're like yeah that's me\nright and maybe there's a joke something\nlike no\nno no no no no the joke is a good thing\nit's no that's just\nno no that's just you know that's what\npeople say you know sometimes i just\nlook miserable i'm not miserable well i\nwell i am because i'm on the show but i\ndon't feel miserable at the time when\npeople say what's wrong with you\nso so let's talk about so this is the\ntwo layers that i'm talking about so\nlet's talk about misery for a second\nso i think part of the reason like the\nother theme i'm kind of getting is like\nthere's two layers of you one is like\nthe logical and you say well i'm not\nmiserable but i am miserable it's like\nall these statements that you make that\nrun contrary\nto there's like there's like the logic\nyou you well i have a lot to be grateful\nfor and i'm you know i worked hard sure\nlike because i work hard and people say\ni should work less but i don't deserve\nwhat like there's like just this two\nit's just two things\nand one of them is like literally like\ndeadpan\nlike your your tone is low your voice is\nlow\nmaybe it's the kovid maybe it's the\naccent\nbut if we ask around like here's the\nthing here's the dynamic i've noticed\ni'll see some life\nand then i'll ask a follow-up question\nand then it'll get quashed\nyeah\nokay\nright so\nlike\nare you miserable\ni don't feel miserable right now but\nthere's uh\nthere is something that needs working on\nyeah right so even like if you pay\nattention to your face\nfirst half of the answer very little\nsecond half of the answer more\nright yeah so so misery exists on two\nlevels so there's like this is the the\nbig\nproblem with i think modern psychology\nwell no i mean modern psychology is\ncatching up but if you look at buddha\nbuddha right so he sort of he used this\nword sanskrit word\nmeans suffering\nand we in the west tend to think more\nabout emotions and pain\nbut we don't it's my experience that\nsuffering and contentment\nis exists at a different layer from like\nemotions and pain\nand the best way to understand this is\nwatching a tragic movie\nbecause emotionally it's tragic you're\nsad you're crying but it feels good\nright it's kind of weird\nso what i'm sort of noticing is that on\nthe surface level you have no complaints\nthings are good you're not like\nmiserable your health is pretty good you\nhave a good relationship your parents\nlove you\nright so what the [ __ ] do you have to\ncomplain about\nbut like underneath there's like\nemptiness and then\nso there's this\ndichotomy first of all okay\nsecond thing is that you actively move\naway from this bottom layer\nokay\nso i'll just toss\nout different things like i just don't\nlike\nyou're a joker\nright\nin your heart of hearts in here\nyou're a joker\nyeah yeah but when you have a joke what\ndo you do with it\nyeah well it depends where i am\nbut yeah i'm trying i'm trying to\nconcentrate i'm trying to use my\nlogical\npart of my brain to\ntalk and absorb and i don't want to kind\nof\nit's like oh that's a funny joke don't\ngo away you know oh that's a funny joke\nexactly right so so when you try when\nyou push away your jokes\nright and there's like a good reason for\nthat right so like you don't get into\nlike\nsexual harassment cases in in in the\nworkplace i mean i mean right i mean\nright now you know i'm trying to focus\non i want you i want to be no so i want\nyou to make jokes\nany joke that comes into your mind for\nthe rest of the interview\ni will put air filter on for your\nstream's sake but yeah thank you tos\nyeah yeah but like if you have a joke i\nwant you to just toss it out\nokay\nand i want you to just see how that\nfeels\nright like\nyeah okay\nright yeah i'm hearing you okay\nso so that's just one example but i\nthink there's like all kinds of other\nlike i don't know how to like so i keep\non asking you if you're proud i'm trying\nto get you to say\ni'm proud or i'm not proud but you just\nlike waffle around\nright like like so because i think that\nyou do feel i'm like do you feel any\npride and you're like yeah of course i\nfeel pride but like do you let yourself\nfeel pride\nthat the answer that is no\nare you proud sure do you have a lot to\nbe grateful for there's some element of\nhumility in there i think some of that's\nlegit i mean i think that's very genuine\nbut i think it's it's almost like you\ndon't let yourself own who you are and\nthere's a lot of like any time we get\ndown there to the bottom layer you kind\nof like devalue it\nso like i love these movings but that's\nweird isn't it\nyeah right\nit's silly it's weird\nyou know and let's not i'm i'm not going\nto touch as a 10-foot pole this is not\nbeyond my pay grade\nbut this whole business about your mom\nthinks you're the funniest person on the\nplanet and your wife wants you to stop i\nmean not wife long-term girlfriend wants\nyou to stop making jokes like there's a\nwhole we can dive into that if you want\nto but i think that's like a good\nexample of like and see there's\nsomething real but if i ask you about\nyour girlfriend and michelle you're\ngonna do it no no go out do my best\nwhat's it like when she doesn't want you\nto make jokes\nuh it feels like she's rejecting a part\nof me\nhow does it feel\nto have it's not i don't know if that's\nactually what's happening because you\nknow\nwhat'd you just do well\nyeah but if i'm if i'm singing the same\nalexander hamilton song\ntwo years later no no no no no no no no\nnot that\nyou said it feels like she's rejecting a\npart of me and then what was the next\n[ __ ] sentence out of your mouth\nyeah yeah yeah okay\nnot okay say it\ni said i don't know what you\ni minimized it i said something there it\nis\nright so one is like and let's just\nthink about this when you say it feels\nlike she's rejecting a part of me like\nthat's an authentic feeling\nyeah you get that like that's real\nit may not be\ntrue\nbut then like this other layer like\nprotective andy comes up\nyeah yeah right okay that's interesting\nactually so it might not be true but\nyou're feeling it yeah right and so so\nthis is what's happening is like you\ndon't know who you are that's because\ntell me logically\nwho are you\nwhat is identity\nyeah\nit's what you love to do\nbut that's that's who you are\nright so like you can't have an identity\nlogically\nlike you can never discover yourself\nthrough logic\nwho you are is experiential\non its fundamental level and you started\nthe interview with you know\nwhat do you do when your work becomes\nyour identity like that's a logical\nexchange right so i can bucket you\nbased on your profession\nbut that's not really who you are like\nthat's the whole point of this\ndiscussion so when you're operating from\nthis upper level of like this is not who\ni am i'm more than my work whatever like\nyou can try to you can talk about it\nuntil you're blue in the face but you're\nnever going to discover yourself that\nway\nand what i'm noticing is like\ntime and again\nyou push away like this element of\nyourself and i think that's how you've\nlost yourself\nokay yeah right because you like i know\nwho you are\nlike\ni know it's weird to say that but like\ni i think we see who you truly are when\nyou're joking\nright you're i mean you're more than\nthat but that's just that's the one\nthing that can still\ncrack through the surface for moments\nyeah\nright and like do you feel alive when\nyou're cracking a joke\nyeah of course yeah of course right\nyeah you have a minimizing statement to\nmake about that too\nbut doesn't everybody\nit's just a joke that's not life\nyeah no something you said there just uh\nmade sense you know so\nliterally\nthe kind of\nthe thought that minimized the part\nabout you know uh michelle not accepting\na part of me because well that's not\nreally true it's exactly why i started\nand that's what you said is you know so\nit's not really important i don't need\nto correct myself do i\nthere's an answer probabilities and if\nit's true or not so yeah but i mean\nthat's like who you are is not like\nan objective thing\nwho you are\nis a purely subjective thing it is as\nsubjective as you can possibly get\nyeah\nand and so like i i\nyou know\nthere's just there's just so many things\nso when we talk about pride when we talk\nabout joking when we talk about some of\nthis work related stuff the passivity\nright so like like when you try to come\nup and you say like hey i'm you know i\ni far outpace my peers like that's a\nstatement of fact but like you won't\neven say that right like it it's like\npulling teeth and when you say that your\nface is as like gray shade as you can\npossibly get i'm 31 years old and i all\nof my colleagues are 20 years older than\nme and i manage 250 people\nyeah okay\nright\num\nyeah\nand how do you feel right now\nuh\num yeah that was pretty spot on yeah\nso yeah i don't know why i don't know\nwhy i've changed to be like that yeah\ndon't worry about the why close your\neyes for a second just feel what you\nfeel i'm gonna just talk at you\nin my andy impression okay yeah and i\nwant you to just\nbask in the sensation my name is andy\ni'm 31 years old i manage\ni'm a senior manager\nthis is doing things to me\nlike what\nsexually\nthat's a joke right oh my god\ni'm not saying\n[Laughter]\nright\nso like\nwho are you right now\nuh\ni don't know\nyeah right but can you feel you right\nnow\nyeah i'm not saying touch yourself i'm\nsaying can you feel you\nit's too late for that yeah\nright\nyeah so like\ni don't know how else to say this\nandy this is\nthis is who you\nare\nso like you can open your eyes so like i\nthis is this is why i was kind of asking\nabout spirituality so there are a couple\nthings i'm going to share with you the\nfirst is that\nwho you are is not an identity that is\nbuilt up over time it is an experience\nof the present\nso like when you crack a joke i think\nyou are like in your purest state of\nself\nnow\nyou don't want to be cracking that all\nthe time this is why so for example like\nthere's a very there are lots of famous\nstories about zen masters achieving\nenlightenment and the first thing that\nthey do is laugh\nthere is even a sanskrit word\nthat the word for reality is actually\nlike play\nso like the like what we you the\nthe word\nthat\nsanskrit in sanskrit gets translated\ninto english is reality so if i were to\nask you what's the sanskrit word for\nreality\none word is one translation is lila but\ntechnically lila means play\nand that the whole universe is like it's\nlike\na\nnot a play isn't a false representation\nbut it is the act of play\nand so there's just this very visceral\nkind of part of you that i think that\ncognitively\nmaybe like at some point there's also\nwork-related stuff here right because\nwhen you're 26 years old\nand you're far above where you should be\non the corporate ladder you can't you\nhave to be like extra serious because\nyou have to play the part\nyeah so so just sorry\ni don't want to interrupt you\nif you're delivering in there\nyeah okay so please interrupt\nyeah okay\num\nyeah so two things happened really you\nknow um\n[Music]\none\nyou know promoted quickly into positions\nof\nauthority where you need to appear and\nbe credible you know so you can't you've\ngot to kind of cut that that [ __ ] out\nyeah because you're already younger\nand then two i mean something that\nimpacted me in the past was kind of the\nwhole\nyou know losing your hair moment of oh\n[ __ ] hell my hair's falling out you\nknow i'm 21 my hair's falling out it's\nin the sink you know while you're\nbrushing your teeth and [ __ ]\nyou know\n[ __ ] what the hell do you do about it uh\nthe answer is by the way if i can just\nshave your head don't do what i did\nwhich is wait three years too late and\nthen shave your head\nit's told the wrong thing to do but that\nkind of matured me quickly because you\nknow\nthe position and then kind of being bald\nkind of aged me a bit\nit's like well\nhow how\nimmature can you be now so that has\ndefinitely impacted\nhow i\ninteract with\nstrangers\nabsolutely right so so i i i don't know\nif you asked this question but i have\nthis kind of question why\nare you this way why do you have these\ntwo layers why do you on some level i\nthink it's numbness you like inflict\nnumbness on yourself in some ways it's\nsuppression\nyeah but why and i think it's because\nexactly like so you didn't just learn\nyou know you this isn't random\nit you know it's hap like you've\ndeveloped this cognitive structure for a\nreason\nand there are influences evolutionary\ninfluences on your cognition over time\nand i think\nessentially like\nyou know you almost got\ndevelopmentally like skipped a couple of\nsteps professionally\nand so then you sort of had to like\nalmost fake it till you make it or you\nhad to adopt a persona\nof\noverly serious\nyeah definitely 100 yeah right on the\nnail so so but the thing is this is the\nkey thing about the mind is that the\nmind can't do that\nnaturally\nselectively\nso for example\nwhen we look at something called the\nlexithymia which is the inability to\nlike exp understand what you're feeling\nemotionally so it's like emotional\ncolorblindness\nokay\nthe interesting thing is that when we\nnumb ourselves so sometimes we'll use\ncertain techniques either substances or\ncognitive techniques or video games or\nwhatever to numb our internal emotional\nstate\nthe interesting thing is then people\nwill say like oh i don't feel happy i\ndon't feel happy i don't feel happy and\nthe thing is our mind can't\nnumb just the sadness\nit has to numb everything so it's like\nturning the volume down like if you turn\nthe volume down like everything is going\nto go down\nand so i think what you've managed to do\nis by some combination of you know a\ngirlfriend and professional things and\nall kinds of other stuff\nalso some amount of confusion and not\nallowing yourself i mean i think that\nyou do so because it sounds like you let\nyourself indulge in worst cases what\nwill happen is you'll have men like\nyourself who start crying during movies\nand they're like i don't understand\nwhat's going on so i'm going to never\nwatch those movies again and thankfully\nyou didn't do that or maybe you went\nthrough your own internal\nno i love it it's like uh yeah it's just\ngreat it's just a release isn't it when\nyou do\nyou can't plan it you can't think i'll\nhave a cry today i'll put a sad film on\nbut when you do it feels good yeah so so\nthankfully you let yourself kind of\nengage in that but i do think that\nthere's a reason why your mind does this\nokay so that's sort of like\nthe logical side that's the\npsychological side that's what i feel\npretty confident about there's also like\ntips right so the first thing is that\njust first of all recognize your\ndevaluing statements and notice that\nyou're the only thing you're going to\ndevalue or the thing that you\nconsistently devalue is like your\nexperience of something\nright so it's not like\ni it's not that i worked hard it's that\ni got lucky well like everyone like you\nhave to get lucky to get promoted yeah\nbut\nyou know you're not\nyou're not like\nslipping and sliding into\nyeah okay\ninto where you right so there's a\npersonal element that you kind of quash\nokay\nyeah definitely yeah so that's a piece\nof it so if you want to be happy in life\nyou have to stop\nquashing that\nright if you want to know who you are\nlike that's who you are you aren't like\na father or a worker or someone like\nthat\nyou're\na bald dude who makes funny jokes\nand is also a hard worker is also loving\nhas made his parents proud\nyou can probably have a cry about that\nif you let yourself at some point\nwhat do you think about that\num\nyeah those are all\nthings that i do or am to others\nbut\nwhen i was saying i don't feel like i\nhave a self i think when i was\nwell it's spot on but but also it's\nlinked to kind of\ndon't i don't enjoy anything everything\nis kind of\nvolumes turned down and everything right\nyou know\nbut i guess you're saying that's linked\nto yeah so i think that's a piece of it\nbut there's still there's still a big\nchunk missing here so we'll get to that\nin a second\nbut like so the first thing is that i\nthink that this is going to be the kind\nof thing where i can't\ni think as you turn the volume up\nyou're going to get more information\nabout who you are and then you have to\nwalk that journey so we're not going to\nlike\nthat's the first thing is like you got\nto turn the volume up\nthen you'll start to really start to\ndiscover who you are it you know it's\nthen the discovery then you start the\njourney like you know the the turning\nthe volume up is like the first step or\nnot even the first step it's like the\nprerequisite it's it's the you know the\nthe starter pistol going off before you\nstart the race\nyeah now the other wild thing is that\nlike\nso when things resonate with us\nokay\nwhy do they resonate with us because of\npersonal experience right\nlike that's what the nature of resonance\nis so\nin psychology\nwhat we assume then is because personal\nexperience must have come from the past\nor from this life then we get confused\nlike you did because\nthese father-son relationships\nare deeply resonating with you\nbut\nit doesn't map on to your life\nso it doesn't make sense that it\nresonates right\nuh\nit makes sense a bit around\nkind of\nmy dad i think he's kind of\ni wish he'd worked less i guess kind of\nsacrificed\nyeah do you\ndo you think how do you feel about your\nwanting your dad\nlet me think about what what kind of\nquestion is not going to scare you away\nwhat do you think about your dad not\nbeing perfect\nuh yeah i'm used to it\nyeah\nhe's just a guy like everyone else he\n[ __ ] up like others in life you know\nyeah see you're a slippery one there\nokay i'm trying just telling you i don't\nknow i i know i i'm not blaming you that\nwas a mean thing for me to say so it was\nvery important\ni think that this is i apologize i\nreally do\ni'm fine\nso\nthere's a couple things here one is that\nyour dad working 12 to 17 hours being\nabsent for long periods of time because\nyou love him because he loves you\nthere's a psychological possibility like\nif i was a therapist\ni would dig into this because i believe\nthat what resonates with you about these\nmovies is that it mirrors your own\nfather-son relationship\nokay i thought you were a therapist i\nmean i am but if i was doing therapy\nwith you like i would dig into that\nis this not therapy no this is not\ntherapy which i'm pretty sure you\nunderstand and you're joking about\nyeah so\nit's but but what i what i mean by that\nis is like you know we can assume that\nwhat resonates with you in movies\nmirrors your own relationship i i think\nthat you could have something going on\nwhich i oftentimes see\nfor\nmen who love their fathers\nwhich is that we don't want to\never admit that they did something that\nwas hurtful or tragic or neglectful\ntowards us especially if they made\nsacrifices and had good reasons to do it\nright so like you you want to give your\ndad a pass for\nnot showing up and buying pokemon cards\nwith you because he had a really good\nreason and you don't want to blame him\nfor that the tricky thing is that the\nemotional hurt for eight-year-old you\nstill existed\nnow the really tricky thing here is that\nif you don't if you give if you make\nexcuses for him\nyou can't ever forgive him\nwhat's to forgive what's to forgive so\nyou know i'm going to start defending my\ndad here i don't mean i'm not trying to\nyeah do that i'm just trying\nso\nyou know he's a guy with whatever talent\nin life\nand he's got to put bread on the table\nso you just do whatever you need to do\nto do that\nand sometimes that means you've got\nfreaking work on a weekend tough kid\nkind of thing you know\nthat hurts as a kid because you don't\nreally understand but\nit's like it's like the scene in uh it's\nlike the scene in um\nfences you know he says i have to be\nthere on the weekend you know do i put\nfood on the table and you know give you\nan xbox and a cool coke fridge to\nplay halo 1 on yeah he did you know so\ni don't know if there's anything to\nforgive he was also present out of the\ntimes yeah if i remember it does that\nmean it was persistent i don't know\nso so this is the weird thing right so\nlike\nyou're drawing more parallel defenses\nwith your own experience\nokay\nright like like we're talking about your\nrelationship with your dad and you're\nbringing up fences again\nyeah\nso like i think this is hard because i\ndon't know if if cognitively or like\nemotionally you're ready to accept\nthat\nyour life may have been a little bit\ncloser defenses than you give it credit\nfor\nbut and i think the reason you may not\nbe willing to accept that is because\nyour dad is not denzel washington from\nfences right he's better than that\nso that's where there's like confusion\nand conflict because\nhe wasn't there he had a good reason\nbut this is when you ask what is\nforgiveness forgiveness is like\nadmitting a wrong and then saying it's\nokay\nexcuses like saying oh it's not actually\na problem\ndo you understand\ni understand\nso i don't know if you need to walk that\njourney with your dad or not like\nyou know i don't know it's a possibility\nso if you're trying to understand\nremember let's go like one level higher\nwe're understanding why on earth do you\nresonate with all these father-son\nthemes\nno-brainer from a therapy perspective\nit's because of your own\nfrigging relationship right\nthank god i thought you're gonna say i\nwant to have sex with him\nno\num so\nother thing is that you know that you\nmay be able to map that on to your other\nrelationships as well maybe your\nrelationship with your mom\nbut here's the other thing that i want\nto share with you because i think this\ncould be where the money is so sometimes\nuh\ni think that what\ncould be happening one is that this is\nactually a predictive thing\nwhere where this is like so has\nyou're not gonna figure this out or you\nwon't feel complete until you have a\nchild\nnow i know that that goes against so\nmuch\nlike\npc thinking like oh like you don't need\nto be fulfilled like children aren't\nnecessarily fulfillment i completely\nagree\ni'm not saying that you should have\nchildren or you shouldn't have children\nall i'm saying is that if there's a\nmotif that is like resonating with you\ndeeply it may not be your father-son\nrelationship with your dad it could be\nyour father-son relationship with your\nkid and that's kind of confusing\nbut sometimes when it comes to like\nmeaning in life and feeling fulfilled\ni think we can safely say that parent\nparent-child relationships are a source\nof fulfillment for many human beings is\nit the only source of fulfillment for\nhuman beings absolutely not can you be\ncompletely fulfilled and choose not to\nhave children absolutely\nbut we also know that human experience\nwhich is why the\nwhy we have so many father-son\nrelationship themes in our movies\nbecause they tend to be central to the\nexperience of life okay\nnow there's a simple way to put this so\nthe two other now we're gonna go\ncompletely off the rails so one is that\nkarmically your atman your soul chose\nthis birth\nbecause you have an incomplete karma\nwith\nanother soul who will one day be your\nson and it is your resonance with this\nincomplete karma which is like\nthat's why you're born that's why you\nexist on like a deeply existential level\nthe reason that your ottoman or your\nsoul took birth is to resolve this\nconflict you have a debt to pay you have\na duty to fulfill you have some kind of\nrelationship to have\nwith another soul that i would assume\nwould be your child\ni'm not saying that that's correct or\nthat's true or you need to believe that\npart of what i try to do with people is\nshare perspectives and the reason that i\nhold on to this perspective is i know it\nsounds completely unscientific but boy\nis it helpful\nyeah so sometimes i do believe that like\nwe have duties right so what's\nresonating with you is that you have an\nincomplete duty so you will never feel\nfulfilled because you're not doing your\nduty and in a sense of personal\nfulfillment to do your duty to have that\nconversation with your son to be denzel\nwashington and fences that's like i\ndon't know how to say this but you have\nlike a gravity towards that experience\nand if we're saying psychologically that\nall gravities\ntowards experiences come from places\nwhich i 100 agree\nbecause i don't think that the mind is\nrandom\nand we're saying that it hasn't come\nfrom your past i know it sounds kind of\nweird the only other place it could be\ncoming from is your future because it's\ngot to be coming from somewhere and i\nknow that sounds weird and illogical but\nthere's a system of karma and\nreincarnation and stuff like that that\nsort of suggests that this could be\nwhat's going on so i'm putting it to you\ni don't think it's scientific i don't\nthink it's i think it's sort of\nscientific but\ni i don't think you need to believe it\ni'm just if you have a question of why i\ndon't feel fulfilled it's like on the\nbucket list for why\nokay\nthe other thing i wanted to say one more\nthing\nincomplete karma\noh yeah the other thing is that this\ncould be a resonance of an experience\nfrom a past life\nso that is also equally unscientific but\ni've just had\ngood\noutcomes in terms of personal\nfulfillment and understanding\nwhen like there may have been some kind\nof relationship that you were either the\ndad or you or the son or who knows\num\nyou know i don't know if this sounds\nkind of weird but do you feel guilt\nwhen you watch fences\noh definitely yeah\nso like i'm the sucker yeah yeah\ndefinitely yeah so that's\nweird right\nbecause what the hell are you feeling\nguilty for\nfor being the for being the thing that\nwas sacrificed for\nokay\nso\nkind of upsetting yeah\nright so\nwe're get not where i thought we were\ngoing but i think we got somewhere what\ndo you how do you understand that\noh\nhow do i understand that\nhow do i understand\nwhat okay let me ask a couple other\nquestions\nso you feel guilty\nbecause\nyour dad\nhad to drive\na truck for a very long time\nright to do what for you\nyeah\nset me up for the future and he even got\nme the first job right so there's\nprobably almost a thing about you know\nhe's planted the seed for this career\nand i need to kind of\ngo somewhere with it and keep going\nto\nyou know honor the sacrifice or\nsomething it sounds a bit cheesy but\nmaybe that's uh there's that devaluing\nagain when you get to something real\nright so\nso andy i mean now i'm\ni think i think now things are clicking\nfor me so then like now we sort of\nunderstand right like now i think a lot\nof things are making sense to me\nwhich is first of all\nlike\nit's hard to feel pride in something\nthat came at the cost\nof\nyour dad\nyeah\nright so maybe we were wrong about\nlike right because like everything that\nyou built comes from\n[Music]\nand this isn't you don't blame your dad\nfor not being there for pokemon cards\nbut like you acknowledge that\nhe couldn't be there\nright and like i think on some level\nyou're okay with him not being there for\nyou but you identify with\nhis the internal disappointment that he\nhas to deal with\nnot being able to be there for you\nwas that too much\none sentence\nyou\nno uh i was i i\ni thought you were going somewhere else\nwith that\nyeah tell me\ni i thought you were just saying\ni thought you were just saying what i\nsaid back to me but then he said uh\nwhat did you just say\nyeah i mean so so when your dad doesn't\nshow up to get you the pokemon cards\nyeah yeah yeah yeah it's not about you i\nthink you understand\nwhat he must be feeling because i don't\nthink you're oblivious\nyeah yeah yeah yes probably right and\nthat's what hurts the most\nis that he may be disappointed in\nhimself\nand he just yeah probably well yeah i\nthink that my dad is\nwould be very\ncritical of\nhimself as a father\nbut\nit's misplaced\nbut what's it like to watch him\ndo that to himself\nyes\nit's\nit's heartbreaking and and\nyou know my my brother\nhas not\nhonored the sacrifice\num we'll say\n[Laughter]\nokay i mean he's just not living his\nbest life let's say that\nyou know\ndrugs and\nthings\nboring honey\nokay so andy i'm you know you say you\ndon't know who you are and how to be\nhappy and i'm noticing that there's a\nlot of [ __ ] that you need to turn the\nvolume down on\nturn the volume down yeah there's a lot\nof [ __ ] that you need to turn the volume\ndown on\nokay right so like\ni think that part of the reason like\nwhat's going on here is like there's a\nlot here\nso the guilt\nyou know and this started with guilt it\nstarted with a feeling of guilt and and\nyou know like watching as you put it\nheartbreaking\nright there's anger towards your\nyour brother there's\nweird kinds of feelings\nin terms of\nyeah i mean there's a lot of anger\nyeah\nyeah\nhe's still drawing from\n[Music]\nmy dad now right you know\nto this day to this morning you know and\nagain you know oh\ni need to i need to pay this person back\nor he's going to\ni can kill me or\nblow the cars up or set the house on\nfire what you know all this [ __ ]\nand my dad always says you know this is\nit this is the last time no more not\ndoing it again but invariably and\ninevitably\nalways always\nhands over the cash because\nthat's him that's what he does you know\nbut you know that's my brother\nso\nthere you did it again\nyeah yeah yeah\ni caught myself with that one yep\nso i think i mean\nyou are\nwho you are and your happiness andy is\nat the bottom\nof this\nright like you have to work through all\nof this stuff so i'd actually recommend\nlike i don't know if you've ever seen a\ntherapist before\nuh\nno never never\nthis definitely\ndefinitely okay so this is one of the\ncases where i think seeing a therapist\nis actually like a really good idea for\nyou but it's not because you're ill\nso generally speaking we think about\ntherapy and even when when we describe\ntherapy on this stream because if you\nlook at the legality of it\nright so like if we look at licensure\nlaws\ntraining it has to do with illness\nbut i i think in terms of like finding\nyour happiness i don't know how else to\nput this there's just a layer of\npsychological crap up here that you need\nto get through because like\nyou need to turn up the volume on your\ninternal self it's not i mean cracking\njokes is not going to make you happy\nit'll be a one step in the right\ndirection\nbut i think anger towards your brother i\nthink anger towards your dad\ni i don't think i have any anger towards\nmy dad i am aware of that that's why i\nthink you need to see a therapist\nbecause i think you have anger towards\nyour dad\nnot okay\nokay i'll be open-minded on that i'll\ntake your advice but i mean maybe you\ndon't but it's bizarre\ni think you probably see your dad as a\nvictim\nand you see that he's getting taken\nadvantage of and he loves his son and\nall that good stuff right\nyeah there's usually anger under that\nwell i'm angry that he won't okay what\ndo you mean i'm angry that he won't just\nthere you go\nlet whatever happen happen and then if\nyou want to go even further than that\nthere's even brothers older or younger\nyou're good okay so\nhow\nballpark how much younger\nthree years okay the last place that\nthere may be anger towards your dad or\nyour mom is have there been times in\nyour life where your dad was supposed to\ndo something for you\nand\ndidn't get a chance to because\nof your brother\ni have i have no memory of anything\ni\ni'm trying to think\nso that's okay so i'll we don't have to\nget into it\nyeah okay so so i'll i'll just give you\na simple example so i do a lot of\naddiction psychiatry work and i see this\na lot in the siblings with no idea if it\napplies to you or not\ni see this a lot in the siblings of\npeople who have substance use problems\nton of resentment\nso when when you have a child with\nsubstance use\nparents love their children right\nthere's one kid who needs more help\nneeds more love needs more support and\ninevitably what i see time and time\nagain is the sibling over performs is an\nabsolute boss at work\nlearns how to be independent\nbecause the the love and attention and\nsupport of the parents is being siphoned\ntowards the child with addiction\nand oftentimes there's resentment on the\nchild who does a good job\nand there's a lot of like\nlayers of [ __ ] on top before people\nrealize that because they always\nresentment to the childhood is a good\njob\nno the child who does a good job the\nchild who does a good job is the one who\nwinds up in my office\nokay\njust like you like it's actually\nstunning how many men in their 30s who\nover perform or at manager levels have\nthis problem it's actually funny now\nthat i think about it i i didn't connect\nthose dots until now but it's a very\nreally common problem so like what what\nhappens then is like\nthey actually resent their parents and\nit takes\nbut they feel guilty for resenting their\nparents\nbecause if clearly like i have a brother\nwho's a fuck-up\nand my he needs the support more than i\ndo so like i can't blame my parents for\nlike prioritizing him i think what\nthey're doing is stupid that they can\nown pretty easily\nright they need to learn how to set\nboundaries but it's really hard for them\nto get to the point that like\nmy life my parents chose\nmy brother\nwho may have had justified reasons why\nthey needed his attention more\nor\nbut like there still can be resentment\nlike it's really\nit doesn't feel like that's it yeah so\ni'm laying this out for you because i i\ndon't know that like i said i think this\nis more\ni don't know\nyeah go ahead yeah i think i think\nthat's i think that\ndespite\nthe attention of\nmy brother needed and all of the energy\nand emotion and that snaps out of people\ndespite that\nfor the most part\nthey were still there for me and\nprovided me with the opportunities like\nthe like the job and whatever else money\nif i needed money you know\nat times i've been between jobs and you\nknow my dad would give me money\nyeah so so that's that's good to hear so\nit may not it may not apply to you i'm\njust sort of mapping it out for you so\nthat like you can kind of think through\nthis either on your own or you know\nyou know there may be it's just very\ncommon that when there's a sibling we\nalso see this with siblings who have\nmedical problems\nso one child has medical problems\nthe other child has is doesn't\nso parents attention primarily goes to\none child and understandably so\njustifiably so\nand then\na child who is successful oftentimes\nbecomes a doctor themselves\nyou know is very independent then\nwinds up in my office and then we have\nto work through these some of these\nissues\nokay so i think you know the one thing\nwe did kind of find is that you know you\nfeel guilty which is strange strange in\na sense but i think we've figured out\nhow it's not strange\nyeah\nyou know that that your dad\nhad to do all this stuff for you\nalso sort of makes sense why it's like\nyou know it's hard to enjoy food that\ncame at the cost of\nyou know it's hard to enjoy\nthe fruits\nof ladies and gentlemen\nyeah right especially when it like is\nsignificant sacrifice on his part\nyeah and i mean if we we can go into it\nfurther if you want to but there's even\nlike certain comments right so like your\ndad says oh i have to work so that i can\ntake care of your mom and you see him\nhe's going to say that but i don't think\nhe says that about you\ndoes he say that about\nyou what what about me sorry like taking\ncare of you does he talk no no\nno no he's we're completely you know i'm\ncompletely independent yeah so i know it\nsounds kind of weird but i think there's\nsomething there too\nwhere like on some level on some subtext\nhe's not saying it about you now but\nhave you ever talked to your dad about\nthe sacrifices he's made for you\nno\nokay\nyeah okay\nhe's not he's a if i'm a cl if i seem to\nbe a closed book he's\nworse\nokay so let me ask you why not\nwell for example dad why are you working\nso much\nyou know\nuh so that if i die mum's got some money\noh okay then\nyou know okay so i'm gonna ask you a\nquestion andy\nhave you\n[Music]\ntalked to him about how much\nhe's done for you\nno\nno i should probably should\nso let's understand this a little bit\nbetter why not\nwe don't yeah we don't talk like that we\ndon't talk\nyes\nso i think that\nyeah don't worry about should\nso much\nso i i think\nyou know i want to be careful with that\nword\nso the main first reason is because i\nthink you haven't done that because you\nweren't taught how\nright like because your dad as you said\nis a closed book so like conversations\namongst men about our feelings\nare\nyou know\nreserved for movies that we watch and no\nactual words exchanged\nyeah except for when i'm at work when\ni'm at work i deal with you know people\nwho are\nvarious stages of\nmental ill health i'm really empathetic\nand you know sure\ntrying to you know talk to that person\nabout feelings i feel really i'm really\ngood at it\nwhen there's no personal sure yes yeah\nyeah right\ni think you know how to do it\nprofessionally sure right i i mean i\nthink you got to where you are because\nyou probably\nare a empathic and compassionate\nperson to work under\nso not i don't want to push you or rush\ngenuinely so i think you have to do this\nwhen you're ready but i i do think in\nterms of the list of things to do i\nthink having like you don't even have to\nhave a conversation because i don't know\nthat your dad is going to know what to\ndo with that\nright\nbut like formulating some kind of like\nlike sharing some of these feelings with\nyour dad and say like you know dad i've\ncome a really long way like i know y'all\nare proud of me and and i just want to\nshare with you that\nyou know i know you've made a lot of\nsacrifices and sometimes it hurts me to\nthink about what you've had to give up\nwith your life\nfor our sake\ni sometimes think it's almost like a\ntragedy that like\nyou've you've had to do this i know you\ndid it willingly i know you're proud of\nit i know you did your duty i know you\ndid it because you love us\nbut on some level it still hurts me to\nthink about the sacrifices that you were\nforced to make and i appreciate so much\nabout like how lucky i've been and the\nopportunities that you've given me that\ni don't have to walk that path\nhow does that\nyeah it feels good to just imagine\nsaying it i'm not sure if it's selfish\nto say it he's just going to make me\nfeel good that i'm trying to make my dad\nfeel good or something because i'm not\ni'm not sure\nwell i don't know\nhe's quite stoic and flippant so\nyeah i don't know don't trick yourself\ninto not saying it\nno i will do it oh it's selfish\nno no\nyeah yeah no\nsay that again\nyeah so uh\nso\nuh\ni will do it you're suggesting i'll do\nit i'm not suggesting it i'm asking how\nit would feel\nfeel good okay so then i think you\nshould do it\nright\nand like i don't know how else to say\nthis but like you're not gonna live\nandy\nuntil you do that\nokay right i know that sounds kind of\nweird but like what i mean is like this\nis life like when you feel hollow and\nempty inside it's because there are huge\nparts of you\nthat are like\nin the basement\nlike you can't live a full life you\ncan't live you can't find happiness\nunless you engage with this stuff\nokay\ndoes that make sense it's just like yeah\nyeah you know\nyeah yeah your life is you're you're\nlike a movie like your life is\ntwo-dimensional and has all the\nattributes of a real story but isn't\nyou know you see the people like the\nwater on the screen isn't wet\nright and like what i'm getting a sense\nof is that your life is like that where\nyou're like you have this surface level\nlike everything's go like you're living\nit but it's all like hollow and empty\ninside because the water on the screen\nisn't wet\nand some of that like because you gotta\nyou know because there's a whole\ntreasure trove of stuff there\nand like i i want to bet money that if\nyou have a conversation like this with\nyour dad\nyou will feel more alive for the next\nweek\nthere's no way that you're going to feel\nempty during that you're not going to\nfeel good necessarily it's going to be\nlike good and bad and everything in\nbetween but does that make sense\nit makes a lot of sense here right so i\nthink you know sharing that with him\ni've done my best to try to understand\nwhat you may have been feeling\nso you know you can adapt that or\nwhatever\nyeah yeah yeah but i i think sort of\nsharing with him\nyou know some of this stuff\nand like recognizing that he may not\nknow how to respond right and not that\nhe needs to it's also good that you're\nalso recognizing like what what do you\nthink his response could be\nyeah\nand then i feel a bit guilty about my\nmum because you know she's been there\nthrough the whole thing\nno i had a career in things\nbut i don't think about i don't think\nabout that as much sure\nwhy is that\nthat's strange because she sacrifices as\nmuch i don't know\nyeah i mean so\ni\nyou know i wouldn't\nso so just be prepared for him to\ndeflect or make a joke or things like\nthat right so like he may not be ready\nto hear it\nit may be too much for him to handle\nso and i don't want you to get hurt or\nturned off by that\nokay right and then like you can revisit\nit again but like a lot of this stuff is\nabout\nalmost also from a karmic perspective\nlike completing your karma like you\ncan't force him to do anything\nbut for your growth like you need to\nspeak your truth because the reason\nyou're not happy and you feel empty\ninside andy is because for a long time\nyou've stopped speaking your truth\nokay\ndoes that make sense to you\nit makes sense yeah it makes\ngreat yeah it makes sense yeah yeah\nit's just kind of elucidated\na lot yeah i feel like\nagain you've kind of shown a light on\nthe map forward\ncool\nthat's what we're here for\nthoughts questions\nwell i'm a bit disappointed that i'm\nsitting down with a therapist not in\ntherapy and actually the most\nstereotypical\nepiphany has been given to me or i've\ntaken it which is\nit's your relationship with your dad\nbut it is what it is yeah i need to work\non it\nyeah it's just a reason\ni mean so i i'd like to say it's more\nthan that right but but i i think we've\ngiven you a lot of stuff but i think\nstart your journey with what fits right\nto you\nyeah and i think\neven then it's not when you when we talk\nabout relationship with our dad there's\nan assumption that there's a bad\nrelationship\nwhereas i think what you need to do for\nyour dad is like\nexpress gratitude\nokay right and at a level that makes him\ndeeply deeply uncomfortable\nyeah right like you need to tell him\nthat you love him and you appreciate his\nsacrifice and like everything that he's\ndone for you and it makes you sad to\nthink about what he's had to give up for\nyour sake\nand that you're so grateful that he's\ngiven you opportunities got you that\nfirst job got you that first managerial\nposition and that your life is good and\nthat all of the success that you have\nhas come off of the back of like his\nsacrifice and your mom's sacrifice and\nthat means a lot to you\nyeah okay\nthen you'll feel alive\nokay yeah and then with that just try\nand try not to\ndilute my personality while i'm working\nwhat do you mean i didn't follow just\nsorry separately from that just i'm\ntrying to kind of think about i'll need\nto rewatch the vlog i can't believe it's\nthe time that it is i'm so grateful i've\nspent a bit longer with me um\nthe part about kind of my personality at\nwork not diluting it yeah so i i i'd\ncatch so it starts with just catching\nyour contrary statements\nright the devaluing statements\nyeah um you know i think it's i think\nthere's\nyou know especially with people like\nmichelle like there's a certain amount\nof romantic relationships that only\nfunction because we squash a part of\nourselves it's the only way they work\nright\nlike for the sake of harmony you have to\nyou have to you know\nyou can't be your true authentic self\nwith a romantic partner in fact a lot of\ni mean i don't mean to be it i think\nit's natural and healthy yeah\nyeah but also like for you know crack a\njoke from time to time and and let\nyourself out a little bit like if i had\nto say one thing andy you haven't let\nyourself out in a long time\nyeah\nyou know i feel like i don't look at it\nyou know i got this kind of\nfeatureless face that doesn't really\nmove but\nuh it's not botox obviously wrinkles but\num\ni feel very excited to\nhave that conversation yeah\nand i think that by the way your your\nface is not featureless it's only\nfeatureless when you're operating from\none of those sides\nand seriously i think it'd be a really\ninteresting exercise to watch this\ninterview on\nmute\nyeah okay i'll do that and then you'll\njust see\nso last question that i have is that um\noftentimes at the end of of\nconversations with people i'll teach\nthem in some kind of\ninstruction of of meditation are you\ninterested in learning that\nyeah\nyeah\ndo you want\na mystical one or a\nmore scientific one\none the best\nmost effective\nif that's the mystical one fine\nwhat do you think's the best\ni had thought about you ahead of time\nand i had the idea to teach you a mantra\nand give you a mantra or mantra\nso it's a syllable that you should chant\ndo you have a set of prayer beads or or\nrosary or anything like that\ni've lost my prayer beads okay um\nso i don't have anything that's okay so\nyou don't need one but it can help with\nthe practice\nso uh\ni'm just trying to think about because i\nthink who you are is very different from\nwho i thought you would be and i'm just\ntrying to think a little bit about\nhow do you think i would\ni don't know\ni'm glad that you are who you are\nthank you\ni'm just trying to think about whether i\nshould because i had this flash of\ninspiration about half an hour before\nstream\nthat i wanted to teach you a mantra\nand i'm just trying to figure out where\nthat inspiration is coming from and if\nit was wrong or if it was actually right\nand is like more predictive so let's\njust stick with it so i'm going to stick\nwith it okay so i'm going to teach you a\nmantra so the mantra is going to be kind\nof weird\num so it's the mantra is\noh\nthis actually makes perfect sense now so\nthe mantra is actually very guttural\nokay\nthat's interesting okay so the mantra is\nis this\n[Music]\n[Music]\nokay\n[Music]\nyou want to do that\n[Music]\ndid you hear that\ni don't know if this court stopped with\nme\nno it did yeah you just you're just kind\nof staring at me okay\nso the mantra is chum\nyeah so it starts with\nit's like a ksh\nokay and then in the bottom of your\nthroat\nthere's going to be a\n[Music]\nbeautiful so what we want you to do is\nyou're going to take it it's going to\nstart with a sha you're going to be\ndoing an uh if you've got the covid you\ndon't have to do it now\nyou got the rona\ni'll give it a go so\nand then hold that ooh\nthe\nthe should be short and the um should be\nshort at the end and then we're going to\nend with\nokay so\n[Music]\ngot it\ngood you're doing it right\nit's just the first syllable\n[Music]\nso with a cha\nthat your tongue is at the top of your\npalate\nright so if you say cha cha cha cha cha\nthe back of your tongue is at the back\nof your palate\nso do it with me cha cha cha cha cha\ncha cha cha cha cha do you feel where\nyour tongue is\nuh-huh okay\nnow shasha\nsha what's\ndifferent my tongue is in the middle of\nmy mouth so now\nyou'll get there it's okay\ni don't think i will sha sha shasha\nso the reason you're getting there is\nbecause the car\nis also at the back of your pallet does\nthat make sense\nis going to be further at the back of\nyour pallet so it's almost like the\ncause over here the jaws over here and\nthe sha is over here\nso what you need to do is skip that cha\nin the middle i know it's kind of weird\nbut\nso do it again\ncan you say rickshaw\nrickshaw\nthere we go thank you chat\nokay\nright\nshock\nshow dude that was brilliant\nokay okay thank you\nyeah whoever came up with i would never\nthought of that so rickshaw\njoe rickshaw yes right so that shot\n[ __ ] yeah okay you got it got it good\nokay yeah okay and then the the main\npart of it is\n[Music]\ngood beautiful it's\nmy throat has been soft yeah so don't\ndon't do it now don't do it you don't\nhave to do it now so we won't we won't\npractice now\nokay but what i would do is is you know\ni would start with like maybe\nyou can start with like nine breaths so\nwait till you're done being sick\nyeah so do nine breaths\nlike nine rounds\nif you can then extend to like five\nminutes then 15 minutes\num if you\nare open to something a little bit you\nknow it's not really religious but it's\na tool for practice but there's you can\nget like a set of prayer beads\nso\neastern prayer beads are going to be 108\nbeads\nand so you want to do 108 rounds it'll\ntake you maybe somewhere between 15 and\n30 minutes which is totally fine\npresuming you're okay doing it\nthe other thing i have to tell huh\nsorry i'll watch the vlog yeah so 108\nrounds so that means doing the mantra\n108 times\nthat should be your end goal\nnow a couple of things to remember about\nthis stuff you don't necessarily have to\nbelieve in that that's okay if you're\nwilling to give it a shot that's totally\nfine it's also completely fine if you\ndecide to not do this for a while the\none thing i want to ask you is don't\nforget about it\nso it may be a year it may be two it may\nbe three\nand if you want to understand yourself\nchant\ntrump\nif you want to be happy\nit's what's missing from your life which\ni know sounds weird\nokay the reason\nyeah yeah go ahead yeah that's my\nquestion is what's the difference\nbetween that and something like the uh\nthing what's the difference between\nwhich one you do\nthe difference has to do with the\nspecific is the specific spiritual\nenergies that you want to cultivate\nokay now\nthat's the actual difference so\nscientifically we do know\nthat mantra meditation has different\ncreates different eeg patterns so\ndifferent electrical activity in the\nbrain compared to other kinds of\nmeditation but i've never seen a study\nthat compares one kind of mantra to\nanother so there is scientific evidence\nthat mantra meditation is different from\nlike meditating on your breath or\nsomething like that\nso in my experience the reason that i\nteach this stuff even though there does\nnot have scientific credibility behind\nit is because my personal experience and\nthe the people that i will teach these\nmantras to\ntend to do really well\nand after a while if they stick with it\nthey come back to me and they say the\nsame thing that i discovered about my\nmother which is like that was absolutely\nthe right mantra and then like you can\nask them like how do you know it's that\nwhat does that mean and it's like hard\nto describe but it's just sort of it you\njust do it for a while\nand you'll understand\nyeah right because remember it's it's\nsubjective it's experiential\ncool i'm looking forward to doing it\nokay cool\nopen-minded yeah you don't need to know\nhow it works it just needs to work yeah\nright so i almost say it's kind of like\nexercise like you don't need to know how\nmuscles get built you just need to do it\nfor a while the other thing that i feel\npretty good about is that you know\ngenerally speaking all the benefits of\nmindfulness reductions in depression\nreductions and anxiety improvement of\ncompassion improvement of empathy\ngreater self-understanding like all\nthose things are scientific and you'll\nget that stuff too\nyeah cool\ncool any last thoughts\nyeah you're very welcome any last\nthoughts or questions before we wrap up\nfor the day\nuh i guess i just expressed my gratitude\nfinal time i'm uh\nso grateful and uh\nkind of excited i feel good i feel you\nknow like i've got a path forward at\nleast um\ni'm tempted about even giving you my\nprime subscription to toss up between\nyou and amaranth at the minute but um i\nthink you i think you're gonna get it so\nthank you very much yeah thanks for the\nprice up\nuh much appreciate it but you know yes\nyou may get you get more of your money's\nworth from amaranth i'm not not sure\nthat you know\ni wouldn't know i i i i just watched the\nuh the session you did with her and\nother than the um\nthe zombie dog dream which sounded\nhorrifying uh i found a lot of parallels\nthat was quite surprised interesting\nyeah anyway i don't know why any of your\ntime you've been modern generous so\nthank you so much i look forward to\nwatching the vlog thank you very much\nfor coming on and and\ni'm going to let that last comment slide\nbut um seriously dude thank you very\nmuch i wish you all the best of luck\nand uh\nyeah so we'll\nwell\nour team will send you one or two other\nthings okay after work we wrap up today\nyeah take care man bye\nthank you bye\nyou"
