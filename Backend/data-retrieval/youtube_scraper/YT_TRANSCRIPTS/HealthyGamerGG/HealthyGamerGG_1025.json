    "transcript": "so dmt is the active ingredient in\nayahuasca that is used by certain native\namerican tribes as like part of their\nreligious ceremonies and is like part of\nlike spiritual journeys and things like\nthat astral travel like otherworldly\nbeings like states of consciousness so\nwhat we see is not actually real and as\na psychiatrist like this is something\nthat's very clear to me is the mind does\nnot produce an accurate representation\nof reality right so if i have a patient\nwho's suicidal and thinks that their\nfamily would be better off without them\nthat is like factually like pretty\nclearly in incorrect but in the mind our\nmind is capable of producing these\nthings that we call cognitive biases\nwhich shape reality to look a particular\nway which it isn't\n[Music]\nso now what i'd like to do is talk a\nlittle bit about psychedelic experiences\nand\nmeditation and specifically some of the\nweirder stuff\nthat happens with particular\npsychedelics\nand in meditation and i'm going to teach\ny'all a preliminary technique\nfor some weird\nstuff in meditation so what i'm going to\nteach you all today is actually the\nfirst step to\nand\nlet me think about what the right frame\nis\nthe i'm going to teach you all the first\nstep to having an out-of-body experience\nthrough meditation okay\nso let's talk a little bit about this\nfor a moment so meditation\nis\ngenerally speaking a practice that has\nbeen scientifically studied\nand um you know has a lot of health\nbenefits there's\noverwhelming data that it is good for\ndepression and anxiety and arthritis and\nall this kind of stuff\nmeditation was originally designed for\nthe purpose of gaining enlightenment or\nunderstanding the true nature of reality\nbut the interesting thing is that if you\nlook at meditation along the way of\ndeveloping a strong meditative practice\nsometimes people have consistently\nreported having strange almost\nsupernatural experiences\nso one of those experiences is something\nlike an out-of-body experience or what\npeople call astral travel or astral\nprojection\nwe're going to sort of like leave\nscience\nto the side here because i don't really\nknow what kind of scientific evidence\nthere is of these things we're going to\ntalk a little bit about it we'll talk\nabout the extent of how what science\nsort of tells us\nbut we're really going to go beyond\nscience because i think that the\nso meditation has been around for at\nleast 5 000 years\nscientific studies on meditation have\nbeen around for\nabout 30 or 40 years for the most part\nso we're like really lagging behind\nscientifically compared to the history\nof what's existed in meditation\nnow a lot of people may be put off by\nthis kind of content which totally makes\nsense because a lot of what we share is\nsort of based in science based in\nevidence based in medicine totally fine\nso not your cup of tea but i think part\nof what we try to do here on stream and\nand you know for the internet is like\njust talk about this stuff so the truth\nis that\nthese traditions have existed for a long\nlong time and that people have\nconsistently had these kinds of\nexperiences\nand so i think ignoring that is sort of\nis a sterilization of meditation which i\npersonally don't think is ideal so what\nwe've started to do with a lot of\nmeditation is we've gotten rid of things\nthat we don't understand\nwithout sort of really evaluating them\nit's just like\nwe can't study that so let's just\npretend it doesn't exist\nand the biggest at the top of the list\nis just talking about enlightenment so\nyou have all these apps for meditation\nyou have all these youtube videos for\nmeditation but like no one talks about\nenlightenment anymore which blows my\nmind because that's been\nthat's been the point right so like\neveryone talks about buddhism but like\nno one talks about enlightenment like\nthere are books on buddhism there are\nbooks on detachment there are books on\nthings that we understand\nso what we've sort of done is we've\ntaken this meditative body of knowledge\nwhich is huge\nand what we've done is like only accept\nthe part which already makes sense to us\nwhich is sort of okay right because like\nwe want to remember that we can't just\naccept everything part and parcel right\nbecause like there could be a lot of\nwrong stuff in there so we want to be\ncritical we want to be skeptical we\nshould absolutely be scientific\nand at the same time i don't think we\nshould ignore or discount the rest of it\nbecause some of this stuff can be\nstudied or explored in a systematic way\nand that's actually what i'm going to\nshare with you all today is a particular\npaper on dmt which sort of made me feel\nlike it's okay to kind of talk about\nthis stuff\nso let's take a quick look at the paper\nokay and what we're going to talk about\ntoday is a little bit about like you\nknow what the hell is going on with this\nstuff like this astral travel like\notherworldly beings like states of\nconsciousness because what tends to\nhappen actually before we go to the\npaper what tends to happen is you'll get\npeople who are kind of into meditation\nand then they'll really step outside of\nlike what they know and we'll start\ntalking about all kinds of crap so like\nquantum mysticism is a good example of\nthis it's something that i've been\nguilty of in the past am still somewhat\nguilty of and will probably be guilty of\nin the future one of the things that\ni've learned is that some of it's kind\nof bs which is okay we'll get to that in\na second too\nbut i think part of the problem here is\nthat you have a lot of people who like\nbelieve in this stuff\nwhereas the predominant\nexperience i've had with like\nsupernatural sort of stuff for lack of a\nbetter term is it's not nearly as like\nromantic as people think it is\nso when it comes to things like karma\nand seeing people's karma and\nunderstanding your past lives and stuff\nlike that\nas a society we've romanticized it but\nlike the truth is that it's like way\nmore simple than that so you know my\nexperience of past lives and working\nwith people in their past lives is that\nit's it's no different from your\nmemories it's just like the way i\ndescribe it is it's like it's memories\nof\nit's it's when you have a memory but\nit's just not like this body\nso like\ni you know you have memories and\nmemories are completely normal they're\nnot drastic they're not transformative\nthey're like what did i do yesterday oh\nyeah like i was wearing a yellow shirt\nand then you have a memory of like you\nand a yellow shirt the only difference\nis that if you remember a past life it's\nsort of like it's a different you\nright but\nit's not anything special it's kind of\nweird\num\nso\nso i think that there's like a lot of\nlike romanticization of it and that also\ncreates like a lot of problems because i\nthink a lot of the people who like\nadvocate for this kind of stuff really\ndo kind of like think themselves into it\nso i don't think it's actually born of\ngenuine spiritual practice it's it's\nlike they want to believe that this\nthing is going to happen and so like\nsomething mild happens and they like\nreally think they understand it and like\noh my god my consciousness has been\nelevated what does that even mean most\nof the stuff honestly\nmost of the stuff that i've most people\nthat i've talked to like i think are\njust kind of full of crap\nso what i'd like to do today is share\nsomething a share of scientific paper i\nwas looking at on dmt\nso dmt is the active ingredient in\nayahuasca so ayahuasca is i think a kind\nof cactus\nthat is used by certain native american\ntribes as like part of their religious\nceremonies and is like was part of like\nspiritual journeys and things like that\nso i do not advocate for the use of any\npsychedelics without medical supervision\nor the appropriate supervision i suppose\nif it's part of a religious tradition\nthat you're a part of and you know there\nare people in your\nreligious tradition that know what\nthey're doing that's probably okay too\nbut generally speaking as a medical\ndoctor i do not advocate for the usage\nof any of this stuff\nso let's take a quick look at the paper\nand see what they sort of\nsee okay\nso an encounter with the other a\nthematic and content analysis of dmt\nexperiences from a naturalistic field\nstudy\nso let's first start talk a little bit\nabout what a naturalistic field study is\nso in medicine we tend to have\nwell i mean there's a lot more than two\nbut\nthere are two kinds of trials so we'll\ndo something called a randomized\ncontrolled trial which is when we take a\ngroup of people we'll like divide them\ninto a control group\nin a treatment group or an intervention\ngroup\nand then so that's we have a control and\nwe have our intervention group and a\ncontrol group and then we rent like we\nalso randomize them so we like don't\npick a particular population for a\nparticular group so they're randomly\nassigned to each one and then we'll\noffer the intervention we'll kind of see\nwhat happens\nso there are a lot of studies by drug\ncompanies for example that will do like\nrandomized controlled trials they'll\nsubmit those to the fda or like whatever\nthe european union authority is and so\nyou'll have a medication like um\nyou know let's say like aripiprazole or\nclozapine so these are both\nantipsychotic medications that have been\nshown in clinical trials to be very very\neffective at treating various conditions\nso things like adjunctive treatments for\ndepression bipolar disorder or things\nlike that\nso actually let's use quatipine which is\na good example for bipolar disorder so\nso they did this randomized control\ntrial where you take a thousand people\nwho sign up to be in a clinical study\nusually\nand then they'll kind of randomize them\nto groups and they'll give one group\nquetiapine they'll give the other group\nnot quoting they'll they'll measure\nparticular things and they'll sort of\nsay hey c quatipine works\nit'll go through fda approval people\nstart prescribing quotiepine\nand then what happens is like\nthe effects that you see in the real\nworld for this medication\nare not nearly as good as what you saw\nin the randomized controlled trial so\nthere's a really good\ntrial called step bd\nwhich is a naturalistic study of bipolar\ndisorder and what does naturalistic mean\nit means that the trial is uncontrolled\nand that offers some advantages and some\ndisadvantages\non the one hand we can't control for\nevery variable which is bad but on the\nother hand it much\nmore closely mirrors real life because\nit's a naturalistic study so what they\ndid in step bd is they gave people\nmedication they just saw what happened\nso they'd like you know did someone quit\ndid they continue taking it did they get\nbetter did they not get better they sort\nof just like watch what happens in the\nreal world\nand what they discovered in step bd is\nthat\nadherence\nso people taking medication like\nquatipine was very very low so when i'm\nlike part of a trial and i'm getting\nfree medication or i'm even getting paid\nto try the medication like i may take it\nespecially if they're going to be like\nmeasuring my blood levels and stuff like\nthat i'm going to like take it no matter\nwhat right\nwhereas in the real world what quit\ntyping does is makes people sleepy and\nit causes people to gain weight we're\ntalking anywhere from five to like 50\npounds\nright so in the real world when you have\nsomeone with bipolar disorder and you\nprescribe them quetiapine like\nthey can't play music much anymore they\nfeel kind of foggy they have difficulty\nworking they put on 30 pounds and so\nwhat do they do they stop taking the\nmedication\nand so like even though the medication\nhas this kind of benefit which is\nsignificant in the real world if you\ngive it to a human\nthe likelihood that they'll get that\ntheoretical benefit is way lower because\nof things like side effects\nso i personally like naturalistic\nstudies\ni think that they mirror like the real\nworld better which is because they're\nnot randomized and they're not\ncontrolled the quality of information in\nsome ways is worse right because there\nare all kinds of individual variables in\nnaturalistic studies that we can't\ncontrol for\nso in a sense\na non-naturalistic study is like good\nbecause you're pure you're looking at\nthe pure effect of the medication you're\nignoring things like side effects and\nlike not really i mean there's also\nallowances for side effects and stuff in\nthose studies but generally speaking\nit's like it's you know it's a pure pure\nscientifically valid laboratory kind of\nexperiment but in the real world things\nare different\nso in this study what they did is they\ntook dmt\nor they actually they didn't take dmt\nthey took 36 people who used dmt\nand they started asking them questions\nlike what was your experience what was\nit like what happened to you things like\nthat so then content and thematic\nanalysis right so let's take a quick\nlook at that\nso bright\nokay\nso so um\nnn dimethyltryptaline\nor tryptamine is an endogenous\nserotonergic psychedelic capable of\nproducing radical shifts in conscious\nexperience so if memory serves it it\nactivates serotonin receptor 5-ht2a\nso there's like certain things\nassociated with that\nincreasing trends in its use as well as\nnew trials administering dmt to patients\nindicating the growing importance of a\nthorough elucidation of the qualitative\ncontent\nover and above structure which the drug\noccasions\nthis is this is particularly in light of\nthe hyper real otherworldly and often\nontologically challenging yet\npotentially transformative nature of the\nexperience\nnot least encounters with apparently\nnon-self-social agents\nlaboratory studies have been limited by\nclinical setting and lack lacking\nqualitative analyses of the experiential\ncontent while online surveys limitations\nlie in retrospective design uncontrolled\nuse and both of which\nuh both of which not guaranteeing\nbreakthrough experiences\num\n[Music]\nyeah so screened healthy anonymized and\nexperienced dmt's users were observed\nduring their non-clinical use of the\ndrug at home\nand then in-depth semi-structured\ninterviews\non 36 people okay\nso what they essentially did was uh so\n36 post dmt experience interviews with\nmostly caucasian 80 percent males eight\nfemales so this is\n28 to eight in terms of gender ratio of\naverage 37 years were predominantly\ninductively coded\nokay\nthe first overarching category comprised\nthe encounter with other beings 94\npercent of reports\nso this is with 34 of the 36 people\ntalked about encountering other worldly\nbeings\nand so\nthis is kind of interesting right so\nthen like\nencompassing super ordinate themes\nincluding the entity's role appearance\ndemeanor communication and interaction\nwhile the second overarching category\ncomprises of experiences of emerging\ninto other worlds 100 of reports\num\nmany further mid-level themes and\nsub-themes also illuminate the rich\ncontent of the dmt experience\nokay\nso basically what this study did is it\ntook experienced dmt users i'm not sure\nexactly what that means\ni'm sure they define it\nand they asked them like what happens\nwhen you use dmt\nand 34 out of 36 were like we encounter\notherworldly beings\nin a hundred percent we're like we visit\nother worlds\nso\nwhat the hell does that actually mean\nright like what's going on here so let's\nlike run through a couple of options\nso the first is like let's take kind of\na neurobiological approach so like\nthere's an argument so\nhere's the question that i'm basically\ntrying to explore\nis this real do otherworldly beings\nexist can you travel to different planes\nof existence and like all this other\nweird stuff\nis any of that crap real\nso the first thing to kind of note\nis that we don't really have any\nevidence\nof this stuff existing right we have no\npictures\nwe have no signals we have no way that\nthese beings communicate with us\nin a verifiable consistently\nreproducible answer at least that i'm\naware of if you all know about\nyou know transmissions from alternate\nuniverses please let me know\nwe'll get to what's real in a second\nso then then the question is like okay\nif we don't have any like concrete\nevidence that this stuff actually exists\nlike what's going on so there's the\nneurobiological hypothesis which\nessentially says that this is like your\nbrain\nmalfunctioning for lack of a better term\nso we have these parts of our brain that\ninterpret stimuli and if you directly\nstimulate them with drugs it'll create\nthese kinds of artificial experiences\nwhich sort of aren't real right and so\nthere's no there's no real there it's\njust our brain is kind of messed up and\nit's all essentially like an illusion\nwithin our brain or within our mind\nnow i personally lean a little bit away\nfrom that explanation so i completely\nagree that you know we have no evidence\nthat these things exist and they\ncommunicate with us in an objective\nreliable manner\nbut i think this is where we start to\nget into amateur philosophy which i'm\nsure if you all are philosophers out\nthere you'll be able to explain this\nbetter than i can but\nyou know one of the things that we\nunderstand about the brain is that like\nit interprets stimuli and creates a\nreality right so the simplest thing to\nthink a little bit about is that you\nknow when i look at this table and i\ntouch this table it feels solid to me it\nlooks solid to me because i can't\npenetrate it with my eyes but the truth\nis that most of the table is like empty\nair right it's like electron spinning in\norbits and even the force that i feel is\nthe result of electrons it's not\nactually like physical resistance it's\nnot like my atom is bumping against a\nphysical barrier it's i think it's like\nyou know what we consider physicality is\nmostly empty space\nso our brain is sort of designed to\ninterpret things so we also see this\nlike neurologically that the brain can\ninterpret things that don't exist so\nphantom limb is a really good example of\nthis so phantom limbs sometimes people\nwill lose a limb and then there are no\nno nerves left there right because\nyou're not\nit's gone\nand yet we know that people will\nexperience sensations in their phantom\nlimb unfortunately most commonly pain\nand so even though your hand is gone you\nfeel like there's a hand there\nnow this has sparked sort of this idea\nin the you know in the spiritual realm\nof like oh you have an astral body and\nthe astral body is still intact that's\nwhy you can still feel things\ni don't really know if i really buy into\nthat because we sort of have\nneurological explanations for that that\nyou know your somatosensory cortex the\nmap in your brain\nhas neurons that are devoted to this\npart of my limb and even if i lose this\npart of my limb sometimes like signals\nwill get sent which get interpreted\nby our central signal interpretation\napparatus is the existence of a limb so\nwe kind of know that\nso which one is it\nyou know we certainly know sort of the\nscientific side of it you know in\nphantom limb they're also really cool\nexercises that you can do that can trick\nyour brain into making the phantom limb\npain go away\nand that's the kind of thing that if\nthere's truly an astral body i don't\nknow how that sort of makes sense\nso\nthere's a there's a fantastic book\ncalled phantoms in the brain\nwhere a neurologist\ncreates this cool apparatus so if i'm\nmissing my right hand okay like if i\nlost my right hand in an accident i have\nphantom limb pain\nthere's a cool thing that the the\nneurologist did is the built a box where\ni stick my left hand in the box\nand over here there's a mirror\nthat shows the reflection of my left\nhand but since it's in a mirror it looks\nlike my right hand so i see something\nthat looks like my right hand but it's\nreally just a reflection of my left hand\nand if i'm experiencing phantom limb\npain and i put my left hand in this box\nand i can't see my left hand by the way\nbecause it's covered it's just stuck\nthrough a hole and then i move my hand\nand i see my right hand moving over here\nsuddenly the phantom limb pain goes away\nright so there's some kind of like\nfeedback\nthat i get\nfrom like looking at my right hand being\nintact and healthy and moving normally\nthat makes the phantom limb pain go away\nokay\nwell studied stuff so you guys can look\nthis stuff up i think um the guy's name\nis ramachandran if memory serves rusty\nso in terms of like astral bodies and\nstuff right so that's what like is like\ni gotta wonder like how does that work\nfrom your astral body how does seeing\nyou know the reflection of your left\nhand that looks like your right hand\nlike what does that do to the astral\nbody if the astral body is in pain like\nhow does like how does that work right i\ni don't know it doesn't make sense to me\nso\nyou know we know that the brain is\ncapable interpreting stimuli and sort of\nlike makes a representation of the world\nnow that's like basically what the brain\ndoes so we don't actually see reality\nright so someone earlier was asking what\nis reality well we don't really know\nso what we see is not actually real and\nas a psychiatrist like this is something\nthat's very clear to me is the mind does\nnot produce an accurate representation\nof reality right so if i have a patient\nwho's suicidal and thinks that their\nfamily would be better off without them\nthat is like factually like pretty\nclearly in incorrect\nright so the family will even tell them\nno we like we'll be terri like we'll be\nlost without you we love you don't go\nanywhere but in the mind our mind is\ncapable of producing these things that\nwe call cognitive biases\nwhich shape reality to look a particular\nway which it isn't\nand even when we look at things like the\nwavelength of light right so like light\nonly looks the way it does because of\nthe way that our photoreceptors react\nand the construct that our brain kind of\nputs together\nright so we can't like you know i don't\nknow that this is where i i'm not really\nan expert here but\nyou know when i look at the world and i\nsee red it's unclear to me whether that\nred is real right it's a wavelength of\nlight that's really all we know and my\nmind interprets it as red\nright that's what i think it is\nso in general like our mind is between\nus and reality i think that we're pretty\nsure about maybe i'm wrong there\nand so it's kind of weird so like we\neven have weird things like you know\ntelescopes and night vision goggles so\nlike when i you know if i have a\ntelescope and i like look into like\nsomething over here\nit makes it seem like the moon is like\nright in front of my face right like i'm\nlooking at the moon like right here\nbut the moon isn't actually there right\nso like it's kind of weird because the\nmoon is like up there\nso that's really where it is and now i'm\ninterpreting it as over here and i\nessentially like use a telescope\nto\nmake the moon appear closer right\nbut\nyou know then then we kind of get the\nquestion like okay so like what's real\nthere like is what i see real\nor is\nyou know the moon is really far away and\ni'm using an instrument\nto make this thing appear closer\nand then the other thing that's kind of\nimportant the reason that we sort of\nconclude that the moon is really there\nand that this is like a you know a fair\ninterpretation is because anyone who\nlooks in the telescope will see the moon\nright\nlike anyone who looks in the telescope\nwill like see the moon\nso when we have a conservation of human\nexperience\nthat's what we sort of call objective\nreality so if we say that like you know\nto the west is the pacific coast and to\nthe east is the atlantic coast that's\ntrue if you're in north america\nso we have like a bunch of human beings\nthat get together on some shared\nexperience and we decide that this is\nreality\nso then the question kind of becomes\nokay so like if that's the if that's\nsort of how we determine like what's you\nknow what's real and what isn't and\nthere are arguments against that i'm\nsure then what's going on with this dmt\nstuff\nright so then this is where there's a\npart of me that kind of wonders is\nessentially like a telescope\nright is this like a tool that we can\nuse that\ndoes it represent reality like sort of\nor is there something real that we're\npicking up on\nwhich our brain is then interpreting\nin a particular way right so we call\nthese things beings because we don't\nhave\nthis word is so hard to\nuse but i'm gonna try to use it anyway\nso we don't know we don't understand the\ndimension\nat which they exist because that's just\nwe're going off into left field\nso that's the best word i can use right\noh my god they're like alternate\ndimensions like oh my god no but like\nlike literally like what our brain does\nis interpret stimuli based on our\nunderstanding right so like our brain is\na pattern generating machine that i feel\npretty confident in\nso we have this encounter with this\nthing\nand then we call it a being because we\ndon't know what else to call it it's the\nclosest thing in our\napproximation\nbut then the question still remains like\nis that thing real\nis there something really out there\nor is it just like our imagine is it\nlike a phantom limb or is it the\ntelescope looking at the moon\nright that's the main question\nnow generally speaking\ni'm of the mind that there is like stuff\nout there i don't know how else to\ndescribe it and that's primarily because\nof my experiences in meditation okay\nso that's where like you know in the\nabsence of a substance\nwhen you meditate for a prolonged period\nof time and you have like a weird\nexperience\nit sort of shapes the nature of your\nreality like it changes you and that's\nwhat people we sort of know this some of\nthis stuff we know the effects of this\nscientifically so we know that for\nexample people who meditate on a regular\nbasis will like be more empathic be more\ncompassionate so we can see some of the\noutcomes that we can measure\nof meditation but when you really like\ntalk to people like what oftentimes what\nleads to these like profound changes in\ncompassion are like these spiritual\nexperiences this is where like even\nwilliam james talks about this stuff in\nthe varieties of religious experience\nwhere he kind of talks about you know\nreligious delusions and spiritual\nexperiences and all this kind of stuff\nlike what psychosis what's a spiritual\nexperience like you know we know that\nhuman beings have these weird things\nthat happen to them\nso the next thing to kind of think a\nlittle bit about is that\nwhat was i going to say\num\noh yeah the next thing to consider is\nthat any substance\ntends to activate the brain right it\ndoesn't actually like create new neural\ncircuitry\nso for example you know when i use\ncocaine the reason it's so addictive is\nbecause it's activating circuitry that's\nalready there\nso even in the case of dmt we know that\nfor example dmt activates\n5ht2a\nso a particular serotonergic receptor\nso then it sort of\nimplies\nwhat\nwhy is everyone freaking out\noh well so when i say when we use\ncocaine no i meant like\ni mean we i've never used cocaine i mean\nlike when humans we know what it does\nright i'm using we in this in the\ncollective we know what it does in\nscience knows what it does\num no i stick with t chat\nso\nso when we use a substance it just\nactivates the neural circuitry that's\nalready there okay\nso\neven in the case of dmt like we know\nthat it activates 5ht2a now this is\nwhere things get kind of interesting so\nwe know that for example\nopioids activate the mu receptors\nright we know that cannabinoids activate\ncannabinoid receptors or a nundamide so\nthc or marijuana activates those\nreceptors so we know that all these\nthings like will activate receptors in\nour brain\nso then the question kind of becomes\nif it's just turning on something in the\nbrain\ndo you need the substance at all\nso this is where\nyou know i i don't know that we have a\nclear answer because it may be possible\nthat dmt activates the brain in a way\nthat it is impossible to endogenously\nactivate the brain i don't know\nbut generally speaking i think that most\nthings that drugs can do we can get some\nkind of approximate experience ourselves\nbecause we all have five hd 2a receptors\nin our brain that get activated all the\ntime it's just about cultivating a\nparticular kind of practice\nthat like activates those receptors\nthrough that practice\nnow that too is a scientific\nstatement that hasn't been borne out we\ndon't know if that's true so the\nskeptical side which i live with we'll\nsay like well we don't really know that\nyou can activate that constellation of\nreceptors in that way endogenously\nbecause it's not it's not you know five\nh2a receptors all over your brain so dmt\nmay you know get up uh uptaken by\nparticular cells maybe get distributed\nin a particular way that may not be\npossible to endogenously create\nwhat i do know though is that you know a\nlot of the experiences that people will\ndescribe with psychedelics are very\nsimilar to what i've experienced with\nmeditation the biggest difference is\nthat in meditation it's not as\nsexy\nfor lack of a better term\nso\nyou know in terms of like encounters\nwith other worldly beings it's like\nit feels like really normal\nit's hard to describe so a lot of the\nthings that i've come to understand so\nthis is i'm going to say something weird\nthat's kind of hard to describe but so\nlike you know through meditation i've\ncome to understand\nthis is gonna sound weird i've come to\nunderstand the rhythms of the universe\nand like what the hell does that even\nmean it's hard to describe it's sort of\nlike you know like gravity so gravity is\nlike a thing that we all see and we're\naware of and we account for but it's not\nanything\nmagnificent right like sure it's like\nwhen you think about it's amazing that\nall these orbits and stuff like that but\non a day-to-day basis like gravity is\nlike is you know it's gravity\nso in that way like understanding the\nrhythms of the universe is just sort of\nlike it's like gravity it's like\nunderstanding that\nthere is a kind of gravity in terms of a\ngeneral universal force\nthat acts in the world\nthat like\nthat you understand now when you\nmeditate so it's just like\nknowledge of gravity is the best way i\ncan put it and it is as simple as\ngravity at least in my experience\nso is that pretty cool sure is it useful\nabsolutely is it like neat to think\nabout yeah but it's not like this weird\nyou know like oh my god like i\nunderstand like the rhythms of the\nuniverse man i don't even know what that\nmeans it's even hard to describe because\nit's just sort of like you kind of you\nknow intuitively understand how gravity\nworks so you know that if you like pick\nup a rock and you drop it it's going to\nfall like that's it's as simple as that\nso in terms of otherworldly beings like\nthat too i would sort of say is this\nsort of thing where like\nyou know you just kind of encounter them\nand they're just sort of there and\nthey're chilling i think it's like kind\nof like plant life it's sort of like\nit's kind of doing a thing and sometimes\nthey're pretty cool like don't get me\nwrong but it's not as you know it's not\nlike the way that it's portrayed in\nmovies and that yoga hippies talk about\nor people who have done drugs for that\nmatter so the experience seems to be\nmuch more drastic and\nbizarre\nwhen people use drugs\nyou"
