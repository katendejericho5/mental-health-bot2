    "transcript": "right so what's going to happen is that\nmost of the time our attention\nis anchored in our body or our mind so\nwe don't really think about attention as\na separate thing because it's always\ncaught up with the body and the mind\nso if you observe your thoughts your\nattention is outside of your mind right\nbecause you're looking at your mind most\nof the time when we're caught up with\nour thoughts our attention is caught up\nwith our mind\nso this is where what i'm going to do\ntoday is teach you all essentially the\nfirst step to\nout-of-body experiences okay so these\nare practices which have been taught in\nthe meditative tradition\num for thousands of years and have been\nconsistently used\nto help people cultivate something like\nan out-of-body experience so a couple of\nlike very important disclaimers if you\nyou know if you're concerned at all you\nshould definitely talk to your medical\nprofessional about this kind of stuff if\nyou have histories of trauma\ndepersonalization derealization i do not\nrecommend this okay\nso you all got to be kind of careful\nabout that sort of stuff\nso the simplest way to describe it is i\nknow it sounds kind of weird but let's\njust start here so i'm gonna walk you\nall through this a little bit okay\nso\nwhere do thoughts exist\nfirst question\nokay\ni know it's kind of a weird question\nwhere are thoughts\nno no no no no no no no i don't want a\nscientific answer so forget about\nscience for a second\nwhere do you experience thoughts\nlike in space\nso when you say mind is mind localized\nin space\nso is your mind in your\nnow hold on a second because some people\nare saying ahead\nand some people are saying no\nso this is something that i did not\nunderstand until i had an out-of-body\nexperience\nthat your thoughts are absolutely\nlocalized in space\nokay so let me put it this way\nwhen i'm thinking\nis the think like look at your hand this\nis a weird meditation look at your hand\nare the thoughts over here\ndo you have thoughts over here\nright do your thoughts exist in the next\nroom\nright most people are saying no like\nyour thoughts go with you\ndoes that make sense like i experience\nthoughts here\nit's kind of weird so this is a weird\nthing is that sometimes when you're\ntalking to people about this stuff\nunless you've had an experience like\nthis like it doesn't make any\nsense\nso the first thing to understand is that\nwe have always assumed\nthat thoughts have no location because\nthey are not physical things\ndoes right\nbecause it's not a physical thing it\ncan't have a location because a property\nof a physical object is that it has a\nlocation the property of a location is\nthat it's a physical object\nbut are you like when you think your\nthoughts go with you\nthey don't like stay in your bedroom\nthey don't stay at the school or stay at\nthe traffic light that it's red it\ncarries with you\nso the next thing\nto think a little bit about is where\nwithin you do your thoughts exist\nit's hard to describe but i'd say they\nexist kind of here\nin their in your head right because like\ni don't feel thoughts in my hand\ni don't feel thoughts like in my elbow\nlike this doesn't think it's kind of\nweird\nbut like\nthey're kind of here\nwhich is sort of weird and if y'all have\nlost me already that's okay don't worry\nabout it\nokay\nand so some people are like in between\nthe ears like yeah so that's kind of\nweird\nright so like the first thing\nis that we've always assumed that your\nthoughts don't exist in space\nbut now we have an experience\nthat our thoughts are localized in space\nso if you all want to understand what an\nout-of-body experience is or what astral\nprojection or all that crap is\nit's that experience of thought\noutside of your body\nso what's going to happen is your\nthoughts are gonna like your experience\nof thought is just gonna like\nbe like in the corner of the room which\nis just weird\nit's not drastic\nit's not revolutionary because even the\nexperience of thoughts in your head is\nnothing\namazing\nit's just like i'm thinking right it's\nso taken for granted we carry them\naround with us all the time that we\ndon't even realize they have a\nlocalization in space\nright you don't even realize because\nit's always been in the same place\nright so even if you understand that\nyour thoughts have localization in space\nyou're taking the first step forward\nso now what we what we're going to do is\nteach you all the first step of the\npractice now this is going to be hard so\na couple of other disclaimers so if you\nhave any kind of discomfort or anything\nfeels weird or things like that like\nstop the practice there are cases of\nmeditation-induced psychosis\nso if you have psychotic disorders if\nyou're using drugs things like that i do\nnot recommend doing this this kind of\nstuff it's basically safe to do\ni've never seen a meditation to do\npsychosis from this practice before but\nif anything weird is happening please go\nconsult a doctor okay\nso\nwhat we're going to do for this practice\ni recommend laying down\nso you want to wear like light generally\nspeaking comfortable clothing\nand what we want to do is essentially\nenter a state of deep relaxation\nand then it's so hard to describe but\nwhat we're going to do is you're going\nto find that as your body like relaxes\nfurther and further and further\nthere's going to be a buoyancy\nthat you feel\nand the buoyancy is basically going to\nbe like you may notice that the buoyancy\nfeels like it's coming right above your\nbody\nbut it's going to be anchored\nand the best example i can use is if you\nguys have seen harry potter movies\nyou know how when a dementor is like\nattacking someone like you see their\nsoul like coming out of their body it\nsort of feels like that\nwhat i imagine that that feels like\nexcept it's not unpleasant at all\nright so it's like there's a part of you\nthat's going to be like\npulling outside of your body\nokay\nand it's but it's not bad that's the\nproblem is like you can use analogies\nbut like you know that sounds seems\nterrifying but you're just gonna be like\nyou're gonna like kind of it's weird\njust gonna be buoyant okay\nnow is this stuff real like who knows\nlike it may just be some you know let's\nremember that scientifically meditation\ncreates weird experiences so all we got\nto do is just you know just like it's\nnot a real thing you're not actually\nleaving your body you're just\nsome weird trick of the brain okay\nso\nstarts very simply so if you guys want\nto participate you can join in we'll do\nthis for about 10 minutes okay\nso what i want you to do is lay down on\nthe floor\nokay\ntry to be\nthink a little bit about the temperature\nso sometimes when you engage in this\npractice you'll\nfeel a little bit chilly\nand generally speaking the more\nthe fewer sensations that your body\nexperiences the better your chances are\nof entering the meditative state\nokay\nso what that means is that you don't\nwant to be particularly hungry you don't\nwant to pee you don't want to\n[Music]\nbe cold you don't want to be hot you\ndon't want to be thirsty\nso try to take care of that stuff we'll\ngive you guys like 60 seconds to pee if\nyou need to get water if you need to\nyou know grab a light sheet if you want\nto\nokay\nno we're not going to use dmt\ndmt free okay\nso i would not recommend doing this in\nyour bed\nbecause that'll probably engage you in\nsleep but basically what we're going to\ntry to do\nis create a neutral experience in our\nbody as neutral as possible\nand as our body stops sending us signals\nwe will start to like feel\nour consciousness more robustly for lack\nof a better term\nokay\nyou can do it in a comfy chair\nback should be straight though\nyeah it's interesting i i've never tried\nthis kind of stuff in a sensory\ndeprivation tank\nuh rock and roll's asking i had\ndepersonalization a few years ago can i\ntry this dr cam no longer do\npersonalization i would talk to\nwhichever medical professional manage\nyour depersonalization and ask them if\nit's okay to try\nokay\npillows okay yeah\ndark room is good\nmeditation is a whole different ballgame\ncompletely different\ni mean sorry levitation\nso\nlay down\nand what i want you to do is close your\neyes\nand just take a moment to notice your\nbody on the floor\nnotice all the sensations\nnotice all the signals that it's sending\nyou\nand all of the\nand notice that each of the signals that\nyour body sends you kind of anchor you\nto your body\nright you notice them in the present\nthey exist in the present they pull you\ntowards the present\nthey pull your attention towards that\nparticular thing\nso if you feel hungry your attention is\non the hunger if you feel thirsty your\nattention is on the thirst\nif you feel tightness your attention is\non the tightness\nand now what we want to do is take a\ndeep breath in\nand as you exhale\nslowly relax\nnotice the way that you hold tension in\nyour arms maybe shoulders maybe neck\nmaybe your feet are straight up let them\nfall to either side\npalms face up\nbreathe in\nand out and relax into the ground\nnow what i want you to do is go into the\nbreath\nand with each breath you take\ngo fully into the breath\nand exhale\nand now i want you to focus on your toes\nand notice any kind of tension that may\nbe in the toes\nyou can wiggle them a little bit if you\nneed to\nwork out a little bit of that extra\nenergy\nand then try to fully relax your toes\nand now move on to your feet\nfeel that tension in your ankles\npressure on the heels\nand then relax those\nand now move up to your\ncalves and your shins\nas you breathe in and out\nlet them fully relax\nand now move on to your knees\nnotice your the tension in your knees\nand as you exhale the next time let that\nrelax as well\nnow move on to your thighs\ndeep breath in\nand as you exhale\nslowly relax\nnow notice the tension in your fingers\nlet your fingers relax with your next\nexhalation\nthen feel that energy in your wrists\nthe tension\nthat gets stored up there\ndeep breath in and out\nand then forearms\nas you exhale relax your arms let your\nhand\nand arm hang limp\nsupported fully by the floor\nand up to your biceps\nand elbows\nas you breathe in and out\nlet those relax\nand then move on to your shoulders\nlet your shoulders relax\nand then with a deep breath in and out\nlet your arms and legs fully relax\nand now your\nabdomen\nand back\nyour lower back feel the tension there\nfeel the way that you sit in your chair\nall day\ncausing it to curve causing it to\ntighten\nholding all that\nnegative energy\nand as you breathe in and out\nlet that relax\nand now moving on to your chest\nfeel the gentle rhythm\nof inhalation\nand exhalation\nas you exhale let your chest sink down\nwith your next breath\nlet your neck relax\nfeel the tension especially where your\nneck touches the base of your skull\nnow relax your head\nlet your head sink back\ndon't suspend it any longer with your\nneck\nlet it go\nyour neck is always holding your head up\nholding it holding it holding it let it\ngo\nand now move to the tension in your face\nsee how you always hold the tension\nthere\nthe eyes always needing to be open\nthe mask that you wear\nlet everything fall away\nand now what we're going to do\nis take eight breaths\nwith each breath\nwhat we're going to do is try to double\nour relaxation\nso notice the tension in your body\nand you're going to let half of it go\nwith your next breath\ndeep breath in\nand out\nlet half the tension go\nin\nand out\nand let half the tension go\nyou may notice there are a couple of\nholdouts in your body stubborn areas\nwhere you can feel the tension remaining\nyou can focus on those and let it go\nanother breath\nand now continue at your own pace\nfor four to five more breaths\nsinking further and further\ninto relaxation\nand now\n[Music]\nthat you're in a state of relaxation\nyou have a breath or two go ahead and\nfinish it\nnotice how heavy your body feels\nand let your body sink\nand you may start to feel a buoyancy\nstart to feel as if your\nbody has\nalmost like there's a part of you that's\nstraining against the surface of your\nbody\ndon't push it\nlet it float\nnow you can continue for as long as you\nwant to\nit's tricky but you don't want to push\nyourself out\nand just\nit's hard but hold that space of\nfloating\nand the longer that you're able to hold\nit\nthe greater the capacity to float\nso just stay in that\nzone\nit's hard\neither my words\nor your body or a sense of nervous\nenergy\nall of these things will disrupt that\nspace\nnow we're going to go ahead and come\nback\nit may feel relieving to be coming back\nthat there's a certain nervous tension\nalmost as if the relaxation is too\ndifficult\nso you can go ahead and come back you\ndon't need to relax anymore\nwhen you're ready go ahead and sit up\nwith your eyes closed\nlet your back be straight\ndeep breath in\ndeep breath out\ngo ahead and put your hands together rub\nthem together like namaste position rub\nrub rub rub rub rub rub\ncup them over your eyes\nbreathe in and as you breathe out open\nyour eyes\nlet your body come back\n[Music]\nokay\nso couple of tips\nfirst thing if you really want to do\nthis practice properly you need to do it\nfor an hour\nokay\nvery little will happen in 10 minutes 15\nminutes 20 minutes\nrequires practice\nso even if you failed that's okay this\npractice was not designed to succeed\nthis is a practice that has all kinds of\nother benefits\nright so for those of you saying i felt\nsleepy okay well now you have something\nfor insomnia\ni feel really tired or i felt tired i\nfeel refreshed it's a nice way to take a\nbreak all that crap is true too\nthose are all the scientific benefits of\nmeditative practice which we can\nreliably say we can help you with\nnot the point of these prac not not the\npoint of this practice if it helps you\nfor that go for it\nso if you can hold that state\nso sometimes in psychedelics this is\nreferred to as the liminal space\nif you can hold that state you all may\nknow what i'm talking about where to me\nit feels almost like surfing on top of a\nwave\nwhere i know that the wave is going to\ncrash eventually there's no way to hold\nit forever\nbut you just try to hold it as long as\nyou can\nand the really tricky thing is that\nif you hold it it'll crash\nbut in order to hold it for a long time\nyou have to ride it\nso you just ride and ride and ride and\nride and if you can ride for about an\nhour\nthen\nyou'll see what'll happen\nso sometimes people have different kinds\nof experiences sometimes you get\nfrightened\nsometimes you have body numbness\nsometimes\nany any kinds of those things will bring\nyour body shockingly back which is\ntotally fine\ndon't force it right so go slow\npractice for a while you can get work\nyour way up to being still for an hour\nthen your chances are are going to go up\nmy body was numb that means that you're\nprobably doing it right\nright so what's going to happen is that\nmost of the time our attention\nis anchored in our body or our mind so\nwe don't really think about attention as\na separate thing because it's always\ncaught up with the body and the mind\nso if you observe your thoughts your\nattention is outside of your mind right\nbecause you're looking at your mind most\nof the time when we're caught up with\nour thoughts our attention is caught up\nwith our mind\nsame is true of our body\nwe're like you know i feel\ntightness here i feel something in my i\nfeel hungry something like my attention\nis caught up in the hunger\nso when the body goes numb if you can\ntolerate that numbness for a while which\nis hard to tolerate right if you really\nthink about it\nyeah so easy corn is saying numbness is\nnot pleasant it isn't so it's a weird\nsensation you just have to tolerate it\nfor a while don't force yourself so if\nit feels really uncomfortable stop\ngraduate yourself to tolerating numbness\nand then what will happen is hopefully\nyour thoughts will stop too and then\nwhat you'll be able to do is\nfloat\nright now it's very possible that\nscientifically there's no such thing as\nastral travel or anything like that\nand simply\nnumbness\nright like the presence of numbness may\ncreate some of these kinds of\nexperiences like that makes sense to me\nfrom like a neuroscientific perspective\nthat just extinguishing all of the\nsensory inputs of the body\nthen makes your presence\nfeel separate from the body and then\nyou've created an out-of-body experience\ndo you think that this could be the\ncause of the placebo effect since these\nthere are a lot of instructions that are\ndirected throughout the meditation could\nbe self-fulfilling prophecy\nsure but let's remember that the placebo\neffect is not false\nthe placebo effect is real\nphysiologically\nright\nso like\neven if i take like a placebo\nyou know antipyretic medication my\ntemperature can actually go down\nso in my experience actually the\nopposite is true\nthat the more that you prime someone the\nharder it is so in my experience of\nmeditation especially spiritual\nexperiences and meditation\nexpectation has the opposite result\nrather than tricking someone so that\nthat's the other thing is that it\ndoesn't it can make someone think that\nthey had the experience but it doesn't\nactually cultivate the experience\nso\nif you had to ask me i think that\nplacebo actually has a negative\nexperience because placebo is\nexpectation in the mind and expectation\nin the mind is not going to facilitate\nexperience in fact it's going to do the\nopposite\nso what if people are highly suggestible\nsuggestible is of the mind right\ntheir thoughts are able to be influenced\nthis is not of the mind\nwhy did you start laughing when you had\nthe floaty sensation i don't know why\nyou started laughing but the laughing is\ngoing to take away the floaty sensation\nright so what you've got to learn how to\ndo is write it\ndo the old meditation people ever talk\nabout lucid dreaming no\nso lucid dreaming i think is like a\nbastardization\nof the things that\nthe people talk to the old people talked\nabout lucid dreaming is actually the\nvery opposite of meditation\nso lucid dreaming is the attempt to\ncreate\nuse your imagination or thought to\ncreate experience where i think anyway\nthat's my understanding of lucid\ndreaming i could be wrong there but i\nthink it's actually moving in the\nopposite direction it shares some states\nwith some of the consciousness stuff\nthat you get but there's a certain\nfalseness to lucid dreaming that i think\nis different from brahman\nso i think there's shared consciousness\nstates between lucid dreaming and\nmeditation it's hard to describe this\nstuff but like i think meditation goes\nbeyond lucid dreaming\nyeah so we tried this right so this is\ndefinitely on the less scientific side\nof what we do but if we want to be\nhonest to some of the traditions that\nhave given us so much benefit right i\nthink it's important not to forget these\nthings\nand at the end of the day like we can\ntalk about it you can read about it but\nthere's going to be no substitute for\nexperience\nthat's what y'all you should do it\nyourself then decide\nso i think this is the big shortcoming\nthat i see nowadays is that everyone's\nmaking decisions without having done\nanything\nright so you'll have a neuroscientist\nwho says that this is false it's on all\nan illusion of the brain\nwhich could be true from a scientific\nperspective but they've never\nexperienced it right so once you\nexperience something like this that's\nwhat was really shocking for me\nis that being a skeptic relying on\nscience it's like hard when there's no\nscientific explanation for something but\nsomething has happened to you then how\ndo you what do you how what do you do\nwith that\nright like it's challenging\nso for people who are saying it doesn't\ncompare to dmt i have no idea\nbut a reminder that this practice takes\ntime and effort\nso i would say that like i said you need\nto be able to maintain that state for\nthe better part of an hour\nbefore you really should expect anything\nthat's like the minimum\nso i i would be i would be highly\nskeptical of anyone who had any kind of\nexperience with this practice today it's\njust the introduction you just need to\ndo this for an hour\nthen you do that for a couple of weeks\nif not a couple of months and then\nsomething may happen\nso i would suggest that i would guess\nmaybe about 90 hours of this practice\nis the minimum\nthat is required for any kind of for the\nbe\nto even have a five percent chance of\nsome kind of spiritual experience\nso do you think this is a good question\ndo you think if i'm convinced that this\nisn't real or going to work out\nbut i still go through the steps it can\nhinder effects or benefits and if so how\ndo i overcome that what you think is\nactually completely irrelevant\nokay so this is important to understand\nthis practice does not work unless you\ncan transcend mind\nso expectations and what you think is\ngoing to happen is all within the mind\nso you're going to have to shut off your\nmind anyway\nthe only problem that you're going to\nrun into with the mind is that the mind\nwon't let you do the practice\nso your mind will say things like this\nis a waste of time don't bother\nand then you'll stop doing it but what\nyou think is actually completely\nrelevant like\nthis is not going to matter\nbecause the whole practice will move you\nbeyond mine to begin with that's what i\nlove about meditation you have to\nbelieve in it\nright you just do it like that's the\ncool thing about experiences like\nwhether you believe the water is hot or\nit's cold you jump in you're gonna know\nlike you can believe whatever the hell\nyou want to it doesn't make a difference\nonce you're in the water you know\nexactly what the water is\nwhat you think and expect is irrelevant\nright that's what's so cool about\nmeditation that's why i teach it\nbecause if you do the practice that's\nwhy like i don't we don't go into like\nthere's a ton of theory like\non meditation like there's you know\nbooks and books and books and books you\nguys can't see my bookshelf from here\nbut\nyou know i probably have\na hundred books\nabout meditation that talk about all\nthese weird kind of theories we steer\nclear of that stuff because generally\nspeaking it's not you know it's not\nscientifically supported\nso we try to steer clear of a lot of\nthat weird complicated theory but that's\nwhy just do it\nexperience is going to be the ultimate\nthing\noh do you like tacos do you like not\nlike tacos try one\nyou'll know\nit's that simple"
