    "transcript": "you do four years of high school then\nyou go to university then you get your\ndegree then you go to the internship\nthen you get your job fair you go to the\njob fair you get your job you start as a\njunior analyst then you become an\nanalyst then you become an associate\nthen you become a senior associate then\nyou become a vice president and then you\nbecome a senior vice president and then\nyou become a director and then you\nbecome a managing director and then you\nbecome a partner and then you will be\nhappy\naboard the train\neveryone's telling you to board the\ntrain but there are no [ __ ] train\ntracks anymore it's like what we need\ntoday is atvs but the generation that\ncame before us was all boarding trains\ngo to college you'll be fine go buy a\nhouse\nafter two years of working with a\nbachelor's degree the world used to be\nrailroads and train tracks and now it's\nall atvs baby\nokay\nthis is great dr k what the actual hell\nis passion\nso hi dr k healthy gamer community and\nteam first i'd like to i'd like to say\nthat i really enjoy this content and in\nthe digital space to be in and share my\nissues and problems as i see that they\nare pretty common within a lot of people\nit is truly virtuous thank you you're\nmost welcome and thank you for posting\nmy question right now revolves\naround the idea that passion your dream\njob is we culturally use in the western\nworld at least\nthe idea of finding and pursuing your\npassion is this work subject that gives\nyou so much motivation\nthat makes work feeling like it isn't\nwork as confucius would suggest\nit is called ikigai in japanese culture\nwhat is your current idea around this\nfigure\ni suspect that there are a lot of myths\nand misconceptions around this idea or\nat least this is what my experience\nsuggests to me we tend to form this idea\nas if there is an actual\nand only work field that is so perfect\nfor us\nthat would give us all the power within\nus to perform and succeed like we would\nenter a super saiyan berserk mode in an\nanime world and let us obliterate every\nobstacle we find in our way for this\nwork\nwhat a great description right\nmy current understanding of mental\nhealth suggests that it is not a good\nthought process\nit seems like a very hedonistic thought\nalso if you think of it logically it\ndoesn't make much sense either let's say\ni love basketball which i do and that is\nmy real passion and since i am in 2022\nthat is very convenient because\nbasketball is a pretty accessible right\nnow\nbut if i had lived a century ago i\nwouldn't even have had basketball would\ni have had to settle then and live life\nmiserably i don't think so\ni ask you this because i find myself\nvery confused right now and i feel like\ni have no passion or i don't find\nanything sufficiently exciting to pursue\ni think there are a lot of fascinating\ninteresting things in my in my field of\nstudy and other hobbies\nthat i have but nothing puts me in a\nsituation of being satisfied\ni'm not that interested much right\nin basketball as a profession and i'm\ninvesting to be a trainer focused on\nposture and health\nand i have a lot of interest in making\ncontent around it\nand even want to do gaming content but i\ndon't feel a drive for actually\nembracing it with force and\ndetermination\ni'm doing it because i feel that it is\nmy best bet right now knowing my values\nand interests i believe that you could\ngive us a lot of insight on the topic\nthanks in advance and much appreciation\nreally fantastic question\nso the first thing\nthat i'm going to comment on\nis the question itself\nand i think the question is actually a\nsign of how far our community has come\nso if you look at a lot of the questions\nespecially early on\nin our both our community and the rest\nof the internet\nwhat people will ask is how do i find my\npassion\nright so you'll have like some interview\non some like stanford like stanford\nbusiness podcast or whatever right\nyou'll have some like podcasts and like\na fancy place\nlike a ted talk or something like that\nand then you'll have some expert\nwho has accomplished things with a\ncapital a\nand then the interview will ask them\nlike how do you find your passion like\nhow did you discover your passion like\nthat's about your passion they'll be\nlike oh yeah like you have to like grind\n24 7 like boss babe like you know\nwhatever\nthey'll give some answer\nand then we all walk away with this idea\nthat there's this thing out there\ncalled my passion and this is a\nbeautiful description of it and it's\nlike once you find your passion\nonce you find it\neverything becomes easy\nwork doesn't feel like work\nyou have so much motivation you enter\nthe super saiyan mode where you're like\nyou're grinding man it's like so like\nlike you can't stop working and like you\nknow you're burning out because you're\nso passionate about it\nand then all the obstacles fall away\nso we have this idea that there's this\nthing out there and that passion is\nsomething to be found\nright you get an infinite buff\nbeautifully put\nit makes all the hard things easy\nand so we start seeking for this thing\nand then like we find one thing that\nwe're kind of interested in but we don't\nturn into a super saiyan so like oh\nthat's not my passion so we keep looking\nkeep looking keep looking for my passion\nwhere's my passion where's my passion\nwhere's my passion is this my passion is\nthat my passion oh then what happens is\nsomeone uses this term ikigai\nand then they read books on ikigai and\nhow to find ike and then they go look\nand they go look and they're like oh\nthere's this thing there's flow state\nthere's confucius there's ikigai\nthis guy in this ted talk was talking\nabout finding your\npassion and so we go looking for this\nmythical super saiyan state\nand then we don't find it\nand then we start asking lots of\nquestions right so this is actually the\nright question let's start by defining\nit not forget about finding it\nwhat the hell is it\nwhat is this thing that we call passion\nhow does it work what are its dimensions\nwhat are the what are the laws of\nphysics that govern passion\nright what are the equations is it\nsomething that's found is it something\nthat's discovered is it something that's\nbuilt\nis it a temporary state is it a state of\nmind is it a physiological thing like\nwhat is it\nbecause once we understand what it is\nthen we can figure out constructing it\nor how to find it but the first question\nis like what is it\nokay\nso we're going to talk about today is a\ncouple of different things\nand\na couple of the different problems that\nwe run into when we are looking for our\npassion okay\nso the first thing that we're going to\nstart with\nokay\nso\nuh i was about to say how to find\npassion but that's incorrect that's the\ndefault question we actually don't want\nthat one we want\nwhat\nis\npassion\nokay\nso here's the first thing is that there\nare a couple of there are three major\nproblems that we run into\nwhen trying to answer this question or\nfind our passion\nokay\nthe first is that we equate passion\nwith\na career\nor a job\nthis is mistake number one\nso here's the first thing to understand\nso when when i start to think about my\npassion as a job or a career\nlet's think a little bit about what\npassion is let's think a little bit\nabout being human so over we here we\nhave a human being\nso if we want to understand passion the\nfirst thing we have to understand about\nhuman beings is that human beings are\nindividuals\nokay\nso there are a lot of different things\nthat make you you right so different\npeople have different interests\ndifferent fulfillments\nso what you find fulfilling may be\ndifferent from some what someone else\nfinds fulfilling right and then they\nalso have different circumstances\nas this person points out like their\npassion is basketball but if they lived\n200 years ago does that mean that they\njust live a miserable life is a reason\nthat like so many people in our\ncommunity are miserable is because they\nwere just born in the wrong era\nis that sort of you just sol because\nyour passion is underwater\nin space basket weaving\nand since underwater in space basket\nweaving doesn't exist right now y'all\nare just doomed to be unhappy\nso the first thing to understand is that\nindividuals\nhave all of these these things that make\nus tick\nright so what makes me tick what i get\nexcited about\nwell\npeople are getting caught up in that\nthe underwater in space basket weaving\nis feeling everyone is that what your\nreal passion is well then make it\npave the way\nfor the future for all of the people who\nare left out and feeling directionless\nin life\nso\nindividual so like passion first of all\nwell we're not gonna say passion yet but\nlet's start by acknowledging that what\nmakes human beings tick what we're\nattracted to\nwhat we're interested in what we find\nenjoyable\nis going to be individualistic\nnow here's the problem\nis when we look at a career or a job as\na source of our passion or a way to like\nmake our passion a reality or whatever\ncareers and jobs\nand education that's the third big thing\nright so people will look for their\npassion through education\nthe problem is that these are\ninstitutional\nwhat does that mean\nso what's the job\nwhat is the goal of a university that's\ntrying to teach you\nhow to code\nit's not individual at all in fact it's\nthe very opposite of individual right\nit's like cookie cutter here are the 15\ncourses you have to take first year here\nare the 15 courses you have to take\nsecond year here are the 15 courses you\nhave to take third year and then you get\nsome choice in the fourth year\nso institutions are cookie cutter\nin that way jobs and careers are cookie\ncutter too like if i go work as an\nanalyst in an investment bank or i work\nas a junior dev in a aaa game studio or\ni work as a junior dev in an indie\nstudio like\nthese people like there's a job\ndescription right there's nothing\nindividual about it these are like the\ncharacteristics that we're looking for\nthis is what it's going to be so the\nfirst problem that we run into is that\nwe equate passion with job\nand jobs careers and education tend to\nbe institutional and cookie cutter\nwhereas we are individuals so the first\nthing to understand is that this is a\nfundamental disconnect you are not gonna\ni mean you can sort of we'll talk about\nhow to find your passion in a job and\nstuff but the first thing to understand\nthis is the wrong place to look because\nyou're never going to find your passion\nin a job because a job is cookie cutter\nand generic and you are not\nokay\nsecond problem that we run into\nis that we think about passion as\nsomething that is found\nright so like oh find your passion we\neven use the verb\nfind your passion\ni found my passion\nfor five years i was spinning in the\nwind and then i found my passion\ni discovered\nhybrid taxidermy\nfrom extraterrestrial beings\nand i take i travel to different\ncontinents and worlds\nand i take different animals and then i\nlike stitch them together to make weird\nhybrid things\nright\nthis is my passion and then before that\ni felt like i wasn't even alive\nso there's this idea\nthat passion is found and this is\nimportant because this implies\nthat passion\nis external\nyou all get this\nit's external because if you find it\nlike then it's like something you're\nlooking oh i majored in this and i\nwasn't able to find my passion i went to\nthis job i wasn't able to find my\npassion i looked over here i talked to\nthis person you're looking externally\nwhereas as we sort of mentioned passion\nis individual in nature\nso the other thing about finding passion\nis that it tends to be both an internal\njourney and an external journey and\nwe'll get to that a little bit more\nokay\nso\nif you're looking for your passion it's\nnot going to be kind of like you're not\ngoing to find it lying somewhere right\nlike you're not just going to like it's\nnot going to be like a random\ndrop\nfrom\nyou know some kind of world quest\nwhere it's like oh i'm gonna go here and\ni'm just gonna walk in the door and i\nwill eat i will see a cookie on the\nshelf and i will discover oh my god my\npassion is to be a baker i just i had\nthis cookie and it was so amazing that\nit transformed my life\nright\nso you can't like point one percent\npassion drop you can't check the loot\ntable and things like that so this is\nwhere passion is both an internal and an\nexternal journey\nso like there are external things we\nhave to look for but i want you all to\nthink a little bit about you know\npassion comes from within this is also\nsomething that we say it's kind of true\nso it's like both internal and external\nand what i'm going to talk about here\nfor a second if you guys caught this is\nwe had a lecture on burnout recently\nand burnout is a really really good\nexample of a hybrid internal external\nphenomenon so this is what we're sort of\ndiscovering i don't know that we've even\ndiscovered yet but i'm seeing this for\nsure\nis that a lot of the unhappiness that we\nhave where the individual meets the\nworkplace\nis a hybrid unhappiness there's an\ninternal component and an external\ncomponent\nso for example we know that\na discrepancy in values creates burnout\nin the workplace so when the individual\nvalues one thing and the company values\nanother thing this is what leads to\nburnout\nnow what a lot of people may say is that\nokay what you should do if you're a\nperson is just move to company number\ntwo that is more aligned with your\nvalues\nwhereas i would say it actually goes\nboth ways you can also modify yourself\ninto person number two that is can be\nmore aligned with company values right\nso there's an internal component to\nchange and whether you want to do that\nor not sort of depends on you i'm not\nsaying you should always align with\ncompany values but for example like if\nyou're just a lazy ass and your company\nwants you to do a certain amount of\nproductivity it's not the worst thing in\nthe world to like become more productive\nas a human being it's not just like an\nendless pursuit for a company where you\ncan automate your job which is if you\nwant to do that then go for it my point\nis that there's an internal change and\nthere's an external change\nanother maybe a better example of this\nis control\nso this is where another source of\nburnout is the discrepancy in control\nbetween the person and the company\nso the company may control too much or\nit may control too little as a human you\nmay need more support structures you may\nneed like you know more guidelines more\nlike you know structure around you so if\nthere's a discrepancy between control\nbetween you and your company sometimes\nyou have to adjust your own appreciation\nof control or your comfort for control\nor you have to find a company that's\nbetter suited for the way that you want\nto be it can be both\nright\nyou can adjust yourself or you can\nadjust the external\nworld so when it comes to finding your\npassion what we're going to talk about\nis actually the same thing we're going\nto do both\nso this is the third thing that we run\ninto in terms of defining passion is\nthat there are a lot of dimensions to\nwhat i would say\nyour passion is\nso if we think about passion it's sort\nof this idea that it's fulfilling\nit's naturally motivating\nthere's an intersection\nbetween\ninternal and external\nright so these are the qualities that we\nsort of think about when we think about\npassion\nbut now\nas we start to get more precise\nwhat we start to discover is that\nfinding your passion or having a job or\na career that's fulfilling involves a\nlot of different dimensions and when\ni've worked with people who i would say\nhave found their passion what they've\nreally managed to do is align a lot of\nthese dimensions to be like congruent so\ni'll give you all an example so the\nfirst dimension i would say is spiritual\nand what does that mean that means that\nif you want to find your passion or\ndefine what passion is you have to do\nsome amount of like internal work so\nthere's some amount of like deep\ninternal work\nthat you have to do and what does that\nmean that means that like you can't just\nwatch youtube videos all day and find\nyour passion that way like i don't think\nthat's gonna work you have to ask\nyourself like what is it that gets me\nexcited about life and you may say like\nyour default mind is gonna say i'm not\nexcited about anything but that's\nincorrect\nas a human being i don't buy that\nthere's nothing that excites you or has\nnothing has ever excited you\nso this is where you have to like look\nback like okay what what did truly\nexcite me like when when did i feel\nfulfilled when it when did work feel\neasy to me so you start to ask those\nquestions and start to introspect you\nmay be surprised at what you're not\nconsidering\nwhen you ask yourself that question so\ni'll give you all just a simple example\nso i i was working with someone who has\na very famous cooking\nendeavor now\nand so they were like basically a nobody\nand then through social media and these\ndifferent content creation platforms\nwhat they really realized is that they\nlove\nlike\nexperimental cooking so like they\nweren't happy about their job they\nweren't like and even socially they\nweren't really great at it\nyou know doing\nlike\ndifferent kinds of work and stuff like\nthat like they just weren't they weren't\nreally happy socially they weren't happy\nprofessionally what they really love\ndoing is like making complicated food\nfor friends and even the friends like\nthe most\nsocial engagement that they had was when\nthey were making complicated food\nokay\nand so then like what they sort of like\nand as we were talking about they're\nlike okay what really excites you and\nthey're like well i love like i love\nlike hosting dinner parties basically\nright where i'm like making cool and\nexperimental stuff\nand so and they were like but that can't\nbe a job right and it's sort of like\nwell i don't know if it can be a job but\nwhy are you letting that restrict you\nwhy don't we just talk about like okay\nhow can you do more of this so if you do\nthis like what would it feel like if you\ndid it once a week oh it'd be absolutely\namazing\nokay so then let's think a little bit\nabout like okay if you wanted to do it\nonce a week what's getting in the way so\nwe started to operationalize things out\nhow can you monetize it can you do it\nonce a week how much does it cost do\npeople need to pay for it started\nworking through all those details but it\nstarted with this deep internal work of\nlike okay what actually satisfies me\nthen what we have to think a little bit\nabout\nis the neurological component\nand these are sort of like arbitrary\nthings that i kind of made up\nbut\nthis is where if we look at our brains\nour brains are wired in different ways\nso some of us\nlove routine oh sorry\nso like what's kind of dopaminergic for\nus\nright what makes us tick\nso what gets your like\ndopamine neurons like kind of going like\ndo you want a job that's kind of like\nproblem solving\nright like or do you want something\nthat's like\num you know more routine like like what\nis it that makes you like your brain\ntick like do you like creative\nwork or do you like problem solving work\nlike do you like to create things like\nwrite a book or make music or do are you\nlike more about like a tinkerer right so\nlike some people have like uh\nlike a personality or a brain that likes\nto tinker with stuff do you like to take\nthings apart and put them back together\nis that what makes you tick or do you\nlike to draw things from scratch\nright like what kind of brain do you\nhave\nso and this is where a lot of times\npeople sort of recognize oh i like math\nwell what do you like about math i like\nmath because it's orderly and i really\nlike things that are order i want to\nunderstand how the human brain like how\nthings work so sort of like a\nneurological component about just what\nmakes your brain tick what gets you\nexcited this is a little bit different\nfrom the spiritual side about like\nwhat's fulfilling this is like what does\nyour brain enjoy occupying itself with\nokay\nthen we get to the physiologic\nand what do i mean by physiology\nso this is also sort of like a term that\ni'm kind of tossing out there but if you\nlook at different people's physiology\nsome people are geared towards routine\nwhereas some people are geared towards\nlike being more dynamic\nokay some people really like working 24\nhours\non call\nso i'll have some physicians who are\nhospitalists and these people will work\nfor one week and then they get one week\noff\nright so it's one week on one week off\ni've worked with people who are like\nengineers on oil rigs as well and they\nreally like their lifestyle because\nthey're there for two weeks where they\nlike work a ton and then they like take\na helicopter home and they get to chill\nfor like two weeks at a time\nso what is what is your physiology what\nis your like daily routine like what\nkind of work flow do you like because\nhere's the interesting thing\nis that even if you look at something\nlike a standard job if you have the\nwrong kind of physiological\ncircumstance it's not gonna go well so a\ngood example of this is writing so let's\nsay that\nyou do this and you decide okay writing\nis fulfilling to me and then you kind of\nfigure out okay i like creative work\ni like to write\nbut then the way that you write could be\ndrastically different some people want\nto find a cabin in the woods for a month\nand like bang out a hundred thousand\nwords whereas other people like it has\nto be four hours a day every day and as\nyou select for something like a job\nif you pick the wrong physiologic\nroutine or the wrong physiologic thing\ndynamic versus routine you could be\nscrewing yourself by doing that right so\nif you're not sort of adapting to the\nthe body that you have are you an early\nriser are you a late riser how does your\njob work is it for people who are early\nrises at work from home is it you know\nfreelancing like what's the situation\nthere\nso you should also think about this\ndimension\nand the last thing is what i would call\nkind of environmental\nand the key thing here is you should\nthink a little bit about the social\nnature of your job\nor you know what is your reporting\nstructure\ndo you like to work in a team or do you\nlike to be freelance\nright and so the key thing here is you\nall may say well what does this have to\ndo with your passion so remember that\nlike passion is about work that's\nfulfilling and naturally motivating\nthe key thing here is that let's say you\nwant to be a writer\nif you don't have some of this stuff\naligned you're going to have difficulty\nwith your motivation\nso if you're the cabin in the woods\ndoesn't work well for you because you\nget super distracted and you end up\nprocrastinating and stuff like that you\nmay need something like a writing group\nright you may need to work closely with\nan editor who keeps you on task with\ndeadlines\nso what are sort of the environmental\ncircumstances that you need for your\npassion to kind of flow properly\nis it dynamic is it routine is it social\nis a team are you a freelancer like all\nof these dimensions matter a lot and\nthis is what i find people miss because\nwhat people sort of look at is they look\nat one of these components\noftentimes these two are the only two\nthat they sort of look for and then they\ntry to find the right job\nand essentially what people will do is\nthey'll hunt\nfor job after job after job that aligns\nthese things kind of naturally and they\nfind their dream job which naturally\naligns with like their four\nsettings\nyour environmental setting your\nphysiologic setting your neurologic\nsetting your spiritual setting are all\naligned and if you find that job then\nyou luck out and then you found your\npassion and then you start going and\ngiving ted talks about finding your\npassion and then other people listen to\nyour ted talk and they try to do the\nsame thing but it doesn't work for them\nbecause they didn't stumble into the\nright formula for themselves\nso finding your passion is really about\nfirst of all understanding yourself\nand then thinking very very specifically\nabout how can i construct\na situation for myself\nwhere through in introspection i figure\nout what is the situation i need to make\nin the first place and then cultivating\nthat over time\nso passion is not binary you don't just\nfind it it's cultivated over time\nso i'll end with a simple example which\nis myself\nso any guesses what dr k's passion is\nwhat do you all think my passion is what\ndo i love\nwhat's down here for me anyone know\nah people saying dota wow teaching\nincorrect\nincorrect incorrect incorrect\ntalking\nmemes\ncoaching compassion\nall wrong\nhere's my passion this is what i love\nmore than anything else\nstories\nright so you wouldn't even know it\nlooking at me\nbut this is what i love more than\nanything else in the world is stories\nit's the reason i love fiction it's the\nreason i love video games it's the\nreason i became a psychiatrist\nwhat's\nwhat's the tie that binds like why do i\nlike love talking to people it's because\ni love their stories\ni love like stories that's what i love i\nread bedtime stories to my kids\ni read different kinds of mythology like\nwhat i love more than anything else is\nstories now here's the tricky thing\nif i love stories you're not gonna think\nso like early on what i was thinking is\nokay i'll become an author\nright or maybe i can become a game\ndesigner\nor what i ended up doing is being a\npsychiatrist\nbut these are all three different\nprofessions that are drastically\ndifferent\nthey all have stories\nright so like why do i love elden ring\nin the souls games because the stories\nare amazing and so opaque\nright or yeah sure i could become\nstreamer\nmy point here is that the job\nis very different\nfrom what actually like motivates me\nright and then you can actually develop\na job that is like built on your\nmotivation so what are the things that i\nsort of discovered about myself the\nfirst is that i tend to work more\nif people\nshow up\nso if left to my own devices i'm going\nto just start gaming\nbut if i have like an appointment if i\nmake appointments from\n10 a.m to 6 p.m i can work eight hours\nlike easy people someone shows up and i\njust talk to like you know if i get to\nhelp them like that's cool i can do\neight hours appointments no problem\neasy i can work 80 hours a week no big\ndeal i can do 24 hours of call as long\nas like i'm learning about people\nright and so author was hard for me\nbecause i wasn't self-motivated enough\nso i didn't have like this kind of\nenvironment structure and physiologic\nstructure was like hard for me\nas an author\nand so the key thing here is that you\ncan you know no matter what your passion\nis you can construct it a lot of\ndifferent ways so don't lock yourself in\ninto an institutional approach to\nfinding your passion oh you have to\nmajor in physics so you have to do this\neven something like psychiatry like\nokay let's like talk about something\nelse right so this is why i'm super\nlucky yo\nokay so what do i love so psychiatry is\nlike\nhelping people\npresumably\nyeah but i like esports\nso if i love esports in my sol if i'm a\npsychiatrist is the only option here\npeople may think okay pro player\nstreamer\nright like those are my options\nwell it turns out that you can actually\nbe a psychiatrist for an esports team\nwhich is pretty freaking cool\nso don't restrict yourself based on\nlike jobs forget about the job for a\nsecond\nright like because like this is the cool\nthing about the world is that it's\nit's evolving very rapidly and here's\nwhat i firmly firmly believe that if you\nwant to be successful we're not talking\nabout success here we're talking about\nfulfillment but generally speaking it's\nmy belief that the world\nrewards value\nso if you bring value to the table\nyou are more likely to be rewarded\nokay\nnow here's the other thing let's just\nthink about it logically for a second if\nyou care about something if you're\npassionate about it\nit's easier\nto give it\none hundred percent\nand if it's easier to give it one\nhundred percent you're going to create\nmore value\nif you create more value there's a\ngreater likelihood that you'll be\nsuccessful\nand so what a lot of people will say\nthey'll say things like don't make your\npassion your job it'll kill it\nif you're passionate about a particular\nthing don't ever make it your work\nand i think that's sort of a\nnear-sighted approach because it\npresumes way too much it presumes first\nof all that you have a job\nit presumes that you know like\nall kinds of things so like a good\nexample is like people will love piano\nbut if they become piano teachers or\nthey become professional pianists like\nthey're not you know like destroys it\nbecause there are all these other\nelements that you don't like about it\nyou love cars but like don't necessarily\nwant to drive uber like that's totally\nfine\nso be careful a little bit about some of\nthis like general advice because i think\nwhat you should do\nis bring value to the world generally\nspeaking you'll bring the best value to\nthe world if you yourself are passionate\nabout something and then what you have\nto do is be very very critical about\nthis kind of stuff and don't lock\nyourself into a job too easily because\nif your passion what you'll really\ndiscover is that your passion is like\nmore deep\nand it's not quite as\ncrafted\nit's a feeling\nright and then if depending on what your\npassion is there are a thousand\ndifferent directions you can take it\ndepending on the circumstance so the\nperson who's saying i love basketball\nnow am i screwed\nyou know if i was born 100 years ago i\ndon't think so because i think if i had\na conversation with that person\nit's not like they're in love with the\nbasketball itself is it it's that there\nare certain qualities of basketball that\nthey really enjoy\nthey're going to be quality so i've\nworked with like professional like\nnba players for example we talked to\nthem about why they love basketball it's\nabout mastery it's about competition\nit's about setting your mind on\nsomething and then getting better at it\nand better at it and better out it's\nabout playing against a particular\nplaying and getting a player and getting\ncrushed and then the next day going to\ngame two and destroying that player\nright these are the things that actually\nmotivate them and it just happens to be\nbasketball i think the manifestation can\nbe whatever\nright\nso this is where like if you want to\nfind your passion i would say break\nthings down into these\nsegments\nwhat really makes me tick internally\nwhat do i care about\nwhat is my brain like\nright do i like problem solving do i\nlike creative work like what makes me\nlike tick mentally what gets me kind of\nexcited like what can i get lost in\nand then that's not enough because you\ncan't just jump straight to a job then\nyou have to start to ask yourself like\nphysiologically like what kind of\ncircumstance do i need do i want to be\nin commercial real estate or like you\nknow do i want to be like do i want like\na nine to five where i like go and i\nhave people give me a list of stuff to\ndo and i just kind of bang it out and\nthen i get to go home do i want to be\nlike you know what kind of work life\nbalance do i want\nand then environmentally do i want to\nwork with people or do i want to work\nalone do i want to be a freelancer like\nhow what are all the dimensions of this\nkind of stuff and the more of these\nkinds of things that you align towards\nyourself\nthe more you're going to reduce burnout\nand there's an inverse relationship\nbetween burnout and passion\nright but the thing that burns people\nout is like this kind of crap\nit's these two dimensions oftentimes\nit's like oh my god like i love writing\nbut i hate my editor and so i'm gonna be\nburnt out and now i hate writing\nand now i'm gonna be one of those people\nwho says\nif you have a passion keep it your\npassion and don't ever make it your job\nwhereas like if you had a better editor\nyour whole story would be completely\ndifferent\nokay\nso finding your passion is like somewhat\nof a complicated process\nand it starts with defining it which is\nperfect it's the perfect question and as\nwe define passion we sort of think about\nit as something that's fulfilling that\nfeels natural\nhopefully if you move towards it i'm in\nsupport by the way of like\nyou know making your career aligned with\nyour passion\nit just requires nuance like people just\ndon't do it carefully that's why i think\nthey struggle\nand then as you think about all the\ndimensions that let passion flow\nand you construct those dimensions for\nyourself then you will sort of start to\nenter something like super saiyan mode\nthe thing about super saiyan mode is\nthat it's fragile\npeople think about super saiyan modis is\nvery resilient i kind of think about\nsuper saiyan mode as like surfing\nwe're like yeah there's a huge wave but\nyou have to balance it very very\ncarefully to maintain that degree of\nawesomeness\nand what it really requires super saiyan\nmode is a flowering it's a blooming of\nall of the circumstances aligning\nproperly\nand so what people don't realize and\nthey think like oh i got to be more\nhardcore i got to be more hardcore i got\nto be more hardcore and then it's going\nto be super saiyan and i'm resilient to\nall obstacles it's actually kind of the\nopposite\nif you think about your optimal function\nit doesn't happen in sub-optimal\ncircumstances\nright actually your optimal function\nhappens in the right circumstances and\nso as you craft those circumstances for\nyourself as you start to realize what\nreally makes you tick as you construct\nyour life\nthen you will find your passion\nright and this is the thing for people\nwho are saying like\nmy dream career like this like\nthis is not their dream career is what\nyou make of it right like there's so\nmany different dimensions out there\nand if you think about what you actually\ndo day to day they can be wildly\ndifferent but you can have one you know\ncore thing like you can love video games\nlike let's just say like let's say i\nlove video games\nthere are all kinds of things you can do\nwith this right sure you could\nbe a developer\neven then you could go aaa\nyou could go indie\nyou can be one of these people like who\nmakes you know axiom verge or undertale\nlike you can just solo it you don't have\nto work for anyone there's all kinds of\nlike weird indie studios out there right\nlike\nsuper giant\nis a great example but then you could\nalso maybe you want to be like you know\na writer\nfor ign or something like that\nright like i'm going to just work\nfor a company that pays me to play video\ngames and i have to like write reviews\nfor them\nor what you can do is be like a streamer\nright you can there's all kinds of stuff\nyou can do if you love video games you\ncan even do something like you can\nbecome a physical therapist\nand work with a team\nbecause here's the thing i love dota but\ni'm 1800 mmr chat there's no way i'm\never going to be a professional dota\nplayer it's just not going to happen\nnora doesn't need to\nthe reason that we think it needs to is\nbecause our view is too narrow and when\nour when we start to tie in a particular\ncareer to our passion i'm not saying you\nshouldn't develop a career from your\npassion but we try to we try to take\nthis individual thing that is our\npassion this is the crux of the problem\n[Music]\nwe try to take this individual thing\nthat is our passion and we try to cram\nit into an institutional career\nand in doing so we screw ourselves\nlike gg\nbut you can absolutely construct for\nyourself\nsomething that is fulfilling\nand that is aligned with who you are\nthat is fantastic\nright\nso someone saying what if i can't i love\nmotorsport and can't be a driver that's\nmy point exactly is that motorsport if\nyou think about all the people who do\nthings for motorsport\nare all of them drivers no in fact like\none percent of them are drivers or less\nright they're all the other like\norganizations the tournament organizers\nmaybe you can organize something\nthat's the other thing so a friend of\nmine is also super into esports loves\nesports\nsucks at the game\nso what are they thinking about doing\norganizing a charity tournament\nright\nthere's so much stuff someone's saying\nreview cars on youtube like that's the\ncool thing about the world today\nis there is an unprecedented amount of\nfreedom\nfor how you make a dollar\nlike 2 000 years ago the way that\ndollars didn't exist back then but the\nway that you secured food and shelter\nfor yourself was like narrow like even\nmy grandmother i was talking to my\ngrandmother the other day\nshe grew up in a village of like 200\npeople where everyone was a farmer it's\nlike you don't have choices you can't do\nanything except for be a farmer\nonly option\nnow it's like even with video games you\ncan be a professional gamer you can be a\nstreamer you can be a reviewer you can\nbe\nyou know just like a content creator\nright you can be a gold farmer\nthere is an unprecedented amount of\nfreedom and the problem is that we may\nthink that that's a good thing but it's\nactually a huge problem why is it a huge\nproblem because we don't know what to do\nwith unprecedented amounts of freedom\nbecause we've been raised in societies\nthat are so damn institutional\nyou do four years of high school then\nyou go to university then you get your\ndegree then you go to the internship\nthen you get your job fair you go to the\njob fair you get your job you start as a\njunior analyst then you become an\nanalyst then you become an associate\nthen you become a senior associate then\nyou become a vice president and then you\nbecome a senior vice president and then\nyou become a director and then you\nbecome a managing director and then you\nbecome a partner and then you will be\nhappy\nboard the train\neveryone's telling you to board the\ntrain but there are no [ __ ] train\ntracks anymore\nit's like what we need today is atvs but\nthe generation that came before us was\nall boarding trains go to college you'll\nbe fine go buy a house\nafter two years of working out with a\nbachelor's degree\nthe world used to be railroads and train\ntracks and now it's all atvs baby\nand we have not realized this\nfundamentally\nand so then then there we are like\nlooking at\nacross the water and we're like wow that\nwater looks really great i really love\nthat water let me board this train and\nsee where it takes me\nthen we're all packing onto these trains\nthat are going absolutely nowhere\nso the ability to handle choice\nhas become atrophied in our society\nand we see this like in our dating for\nexample like online dating it's like 10\n000 people out there and has that made\ndating easier no it's made things harder\nright\nit's like how many like oh my god like\ni'm so bored there's nothing to play\nhave you seen steam\nso we become paralyzed by choice because\nwe don't know how to deal with it\nbecause more and more like not only are\nour institutions railroaded even [ __ ]\nvideo games are railroaded\nright and then every now and then we get\na breath of fresh air like elden ring\nthat doesn't have quest markers\nand i was like this game is hard this\ngame sucks and like everyone loves it\nbecause that's what human beings like\ni'ma play elden ring the way i want to\nplay alden ring i'm running around naked\nwith a club\nbecause that's what i want to do\nright\nquest markers do this do this do this do\nthis so if you all are struggling\ni get it man it's it's tough like i\ndon't think we appreciate how hard\nsome of the challenges this generation\nfaces\nhuman beings we're not designed we've\nnot evolved\nfor this many choices you just think\nabout the animal kingdom we're not that\ndifferent from like chimpanzees right\nor even dolphins for that matter like\nmost mammals are like pretty similar\nlike what choices does a dolphin have\nour brains have not evolved to deal with\nthis much choice\nand technology is exacerbating this\nproblem\nwhat do i do with my life\nit's incredibly difficult to deal with\nand then like we don't cut ourselves any\nslack nor do we get empathy from or\ncompassion from other people who don't\neven realize that like it was easy for\npeople before i'm not saying that there\naren't things that have gotten better\nthere are a lot of things that have\ngotten better now right like what i'm\nsaying is like this is overall it's a\nnet advantage you just have to learn how\nto take advantage of it\noverall it's like freaking amazing it's\nsort of like it's like high risk high\nreward\nso\nyeah\ni ranted there for a minute\nnew meta\nthat's the best way to put it\nit's absolutely a new meta and you can't\njust use the old strats in the new meta\nyeah so any chance that playing a lot of\nvideo games blinds us to our passions\nabsolutely\nso here's the key thing that a video\ngame does it does not cause you to\ninternalize or introspect at all\nso what what video games do is they take\nyour mind and they externalize it\ntowards a particular thing and they keep\nit occupied over here without any effort\nfor like a period of hours\nand so there's no sense of like internal\nexploration with a video game\nall it is is like that straight\ndopaminergic stuff without like any of\nthe other stuff\nso i think that's that's part of the\nreason that we're getting disconnected\nfrom our passions because we don't know\nhow to look within anymore\nright i'm not saying they're bad\ni like them too i play\ni played lost ark yesterday\nyou know that's okay\nprobably played a little bit too much\ntbh but\nyou know\nthat's all right\nyou"
