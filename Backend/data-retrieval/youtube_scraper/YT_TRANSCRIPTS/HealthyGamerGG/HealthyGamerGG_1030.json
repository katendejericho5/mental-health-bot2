    "transcript": "a lot of times i'll work with patients\nwho will say like i'm socially anxious i\nhave to give a presentation oh my god\ni'm socially anxious\nthey're like what if i screw up or i\nhave this big interview what if i screw\nup am i going to get the job am i not\ngoing to get the job are they going to\nlike it are they not going to like it am\ni screwing up am i not screwing up it's\nall about me me me me me me then you\nstart to think oh i hate giving speeches\ni'm bad at giving speeches and once you\nsay i'm bad at giving speeches what have\nyou determined once like simple idea\nthat if you can sort of center in\nyourself before you give a speech i\nthink it's going to make your speeches\n10 times better interviews too\nyeah so average\nx 2 says i have an interview in one hour\nbig if i get it any tips absolutely\nso here's here's a tip so while i was\ntalking\nso i gave a speech recently right\nso here's the thing someone asked me um\nsomeone from our community asked me\nafterwards they're like\nyou know did you like get any formal\ntraining in like giving a speech\nlike did you like how did you learn how\nto give speeches\nit's a really good question the\ninteresting thing is i have very little\nif no formal training so i had about a\ntwo hour workshop in preparation for a\ntalk that i gave when i graduated from\nresidency so that was pretty cool\nbut here's my advice for both interviews\nlike if you want to learn how to give a\ngood speech it's very very simple so a\nlot of times i'll work with patients who\nwill say like i'm socially anxious i\nhave to give a presentation oh my god\ni'm socially anxious\nthey're like what if i screw up or i\nhave this big interview what if i screw\nup\nso you go into the the speech you try to\nprepare for it you practice for it you\nmemorize everything you're going to say\nyou just talk in front of a mirror all\nthat kind of stuff\nso let's think for when you think for a\nsecond what's going on in your head when\nyou give a speech\nwhat are you worried about like what\nwhat is your occupied by your mind okay\ni have to remember all these things i\nwrote 300 lines i have to remember what\ncomes next and what comes next what\ncomes next\nwhat if i look like an idiot\nare they are they liking it are they\ndisliking it what if people like what if\ni stutter what if i do this what if i do\nthis so where is your mind occupied it's\nnot occupied on the speech it's occupied\nwith the way that you are being judged\nyou're worried about judgment right\nand that is going to lead to a\nsub-optimal delivery of a speech\nso there's one really simple tip\nonce like simple idea that if you can\nsort of center in yourself before you\ngive a speech i think it's going to make\nyour speeches ten times better\ninterviews too\nand that is to remember that if you're\ngiving a speech right even if it's for a\nclass so you're giving a presentation\nyou can't just randomly give a speech\nthe only time you can give a speech or a\npresentation is if someone asks you to\ndo it right someone has to like invite\nyou to do it like so at the end of class\nlike even your professor i know it\nsounds kind of weird but is giving you\nthe opportunity to like give a speech\nthey're giving you an opportunity to\ngive a presentation even for an\ninterview someone is inviting you there\nto talk to you\nso they are there to listen to you\neveryone in the room is not there to\njudge you that's not actually what\nthey're there for the reason you are\nbeing called to give a presentation or\ngive a speech is because they want to\nhear what you have to say it may be part\nof a class but still\nyou are being invited so here's the main\nthing you need to remember this is an\nopportunity for you to share and enrich\nthe lives of everyone who's like\nlistening to you\nso if you're giving a presentation i\nsort of learned this in medical school\nwhere i realized even as a medical\nstudent so i'm giving a presentation in\nfront of people who have 30 years more\nexperience than i do and at the same\ntime\nlike i'm studying this stuff i can share\nsome piece of information that a room\nfull of doctors can listen to that may\nactually help them save a life one day\neven though i'm a student right like\nthere's some tidbit that this person may\nnot know these people are not omniscient\nand in the same way any time you give a\npresentation you are there to enrich\nand explain and share information about\nsomething that you know about that other\npeople don't know about you can enrich\nthe lives of other people\neven your professors\nso anytime you give a speech remember\nthat you're there for them they're not\nthere for you\nright like you're the one who's giving\nsomething it's not about judgment it's\nnot about grades it's not about any of\nthat stuff you are there to share a\npiece of what you understand with the\nrest of the world and enrich their lives\nby it\nthat's the way you should give a speech\nso this is 15 minutes where if i'm gonna\ntalk about\nlet's say familial fatal insomnia\nor hypertensive urgency or how to be\npositive in video games what what i'm\nthinking about when i go up there is\nnow i have 15 minutes with a room full\nof developers and what i say in the next\n15 minutes may equip them to build games\nthat have more positive communities if\nthey have games that have more positive\ncommunities it'll help people who are\nfeeling suicidal have a better day it'll\nhelp people who are bullied in the rest\nof their life have a like a safe place\nto go to this is why i'm here i'm here\nout of service it's not about whether\ni'm good it's not about whether they\nlike me it's not about whether people\nclap at the end it has nothing to do\nwith me\ni am here for 15 minutes to try to\nenrich the lives of other people and\nhelp them do their jobs that's why i'm\nhere and that's what you should base\nyour entire speech on so then the\nquestion becomes what can i teach these\npeople in 15 minutes that will help them\nin build positive communities within\nvideo games\nand in terms of an interview this is the\nway you should interview you have to\nunderstand that this company is looking\nfor someone\nto do a job for them and ideally they're\nlooking for someone good because the job\nthat they have to do is very legitimate\nright like they want to do a good job it\ncould be very important hopefully it's\nimportant\nso you are there\nnot to get the job that's not your goal\nin the interview\nis to land the job forget about whether\nit's good for you\nif it's big for you forget about all\nthat stuff when you go into the\ninterview\nremember that you could be\nthe savior that this company needs not\nout of arrogance but that you have\nsomething to offer\nand that this could be exactly what the\ncompany needs so that's what you should\ntry to do you should go there and try to\noffer whatever you have and let them\ndecide don't try to convince them to\nhire you\njust genuinely offer whatever it is that\nyou have to offer try to do it out of\nservice right so say hey here's who i am\nthis is what i'm good at this is what i\ncan help you with it's up to you to\ndecide whether you want that help or not\nit's up to you to decide whether i'm a\ngood fit or not\nit's not for me to convince you this is\njust what i'm good at this is what i'm\nbad at this is my strengths these are my\nweaknesses here's my experience here's\nwhat i'm looking for i'm hoping that\nthis will be a good fit but if it's not\na good fit that's actually totally fine\nright so what you have to do is let go\nof that idea of you being judged\nam i going to get the job am i not going\nto get the job are they going to like it\nor they're not gonna like it am i\nscrewing up am i not screwing up it's\nall about me me me me me me me\nright and if your mind is thinking about\nyou when you're giving a speech you're\ngonna be empathically disconnected from\nyour audience if you're empathically\ndisconnected from your audience it's\ngoing to lower the quality of your\nspeech\noh what do they think what do they think\nlike it's not about what they think\nyou're not there to convince them of\nsomething\nyou're there to offer or to try to help\nand once you\nshift that from your ego and where the\nway that people are perceiving you to\ngenuinely trying to help and if it's not\nhelpful it's not helpful like even when\ni gave that speech like on friday\nor saturday\ni knew it could have been useless\nor sorry on thursday\nright like maybe these people aren't\nit's not gonna benefit them like i have\nno idea i don't know what it's like to\nbe a game developer so i'm gonna show up\ni have no idea if it's good or bad i\ndidn't check with anyone ahead of time\nmaybe i should have retrospect but all\nit is is like i'm gonna try to do the\nbest that i can given the task that i've\nbeen given and try to help and enrich\nthe lives of other people\nthat's what you should focus on it's\ngonna make it beautiful in terms of like\nthe way that you conceptualize what\nyou're going to say\nbecause okay who is this person what do\nthey need to understand what am i trying\nto teach them what can i accomplish in\n15 minutes all of these questions will\nthen like sort of come to the surface\nand they'll organize your speech for you\nokay\nand if you have an interview just do the\nsame thing recognize that like take a\nlook at your resume take a look at your\ncv look look at the in the mirror and\nrecognize that you are the person who\nmay be able to help this company\nimmensely it's not for them it's not for\nyou to decide whether it's the right job\nor the wrong job it's for you to go to\nthem and showcase who you are right you\nwant to let them know what you're\ncapable of so you don't want to like\nupsell yourself or anything like just be\nauthentic be like hey here's who i am\nthis is what i'm good at this is what i\ncan do for you\nnow you tell me whether that's something\nthat you all want or don't want\nright and so the more that you kind of\norient yourselves towards service\nand this is something where you got to\nbe careful because a lot of companies\nwill like take advantage of that sort of\nthing so that's like a little bit\ndifferent but we're talking about\nforeign interview i genuinely do think\nso even like as an employer\nlike i do the same thing when i\ninterview someone i'll sort of think a\nlittle bit about what can i do for this\nperson\nright it's not just about a job it's\nabout like someone's growth\nlongitudinally like is this the right\nplace for them to be can i do a lot to\nhelp this person\nis this the right place for them to be\nand the more that you think about the\nother person the more you step away from\nyour ego the more you step away from\nyour ego the less you engage your\ndefault mode network for those of you\nthat have seen dr k's guide to\ndepression\nthe neuroscience lecture right and the\nmore you step away from the default mode\nnetwork the less self-critical you're\ngoing to be the more natural you're\ngoing to feel the better your interview\nwill go the better your speech will go\nmake sense\nhopefully that helps\nthat's how you interview that's how you\ngive a speech think about them not about\nyou\ni know it's kind of wild but the\ninterview is not about you right\nit's kind of weird the speech is not\nabout you that's easier to understand\nokay\nsounds an awful lot like detachment you\nare correct so this is the thing about\ndetachment everyone's like oh be\ndetached\nquestion is how\nhow how do we become detached\nif you want to understand how to become\ndetached look at your mind right what\nare you thinking about oh my god what\nare they going to think what are they\ngoing to think am i going to say too\nmuch am i going to say i'm too much if\nyou start thinking in the middle of a\nspeech am i saying ah too much am i\ngoing to say uh i'm too much\nwhat do you think you're going to start\ndoing\nsay on um and then you panic oh my god\ni'm saying um uh\nand then you're like oh my god i'm doing\nit again then you start stalling your\nflow gets disrupted it gets worse then\nyou get into a vicious cycle then you're\ntraumatized\nthen you end up with then you start to\nthink oh i hate giving speeches i'm bad\nat giving speeches and once you say i'm\nbad at giving speeches what have you\ndetermined\nyou've determined that your identity\nyou've become deterministic\nnow i am something\nright\ni'm so bad at it never again you see how\ndeterministic that is it's not i screwed\nup\nit's not my mind got away from me i got\ndistracted i couldn't focus on the\nspeech\ni started thinking about the wrong\nthings that's not what you think you say\ni'm bad at giving speeches and why is\nthat that's because your default mode\nnetwork is activated\nyour default mode network your ability\nto self-reflect a lot of your sense of\nidentity comes out of that\nand then you lose sight of the other\nperson then you lose sight of empathy\nwhen you get caught up with yourself\nwhen you lose sight of empathy and you\ndon't understand the other person's\nperspective your ability to tune into\nthe audience gets shattered because all\nyou're doing is tuning into yourself\nand then your speech is going to\ncome across poorly right because you're\nnot connected with your audience it's\nabout the audience it's about the\ninterviewer\ngot it make sense\nyeah so xc11 is saying wow can we use\nthis for social situations yes but\nthere's an important caveat for social\nsituations okay\nso in social situations you're not\nactually there to serve\nright so that's important because if\nyou're not careful if you adopt fully\nthe same\nidea\nas a job interview or giving a speech\nyou're going to be tuned into just them\nwhich is going to make it a poor\nexperience for you so what i would\ndevote yourself to in a social situation\nis having a good time yourself\nand creating a good time for other\npeople but you don't want to make it too\nlopsided we see this problem a lot where\npeople are like you'll emphasize\neveryone else in the social situation\nwithout looking for your own\nentertainment because in a social\nsituation it's more even right you're\nthere to have a good time and other\npeople are there to have a good time but\ni'd still do the same thing in terms of\ndon't get caught up about oh my god am i\nhaving a good time oh my god it's not\nfun here oh my god these people aren't\nhaving a good time oh my god like you're\njust thinking all up here\nwhich that may be somewhat true like you\nknow there's elements of that that could\nbe true but you don't want to get caught\nup in that right so it's just like try\nto enjoy yourself like what could you do\nif other people are playing a game you\nmay think to yourself okay i suck at\nthat game\ni don't want to look like an idiot so\nthen you don't play the game you're\nstanding in the corner on your phone\nlooking at other people with envy and\nthen you start thinking oh my god i'm\nsuch a loser they're all hanging out i'm\njust sitting here on the corner of my\nphone\nthey're gonna think i'm a loser\nand then the more they think you you\nthink they think you're a loser what do\nyou end up doing scrolling\nright\nand then it just gets worse so like if\nyou feel like an idiot you can say hey\ni've never played this game before\ndoes it matter if i suck\nand then what are they gonna say they're\nnot gonna say yeah it matters if you\nsuck screw you go go to the corner and\nstart browsing reddit noob no one's ever\ngonna say that right\nyou're gonna say like no big deal\nlike join us they now they have low\nexpectations for you then you just try\nto have a good time you're there to have\na good time\nright you're not there to win\nyou're there to have a good time\nand then like what are people gonna\nthink if you show up and you suck like\noh look at that guy like he's confident\nand all the other three people in the\ncorner who don't know how to play either\nthey're like oh man i wish i could be\nlike that guy that guy sucks and he's\nplaying he's not in the corner on his\nphone i wish i could be like him\nright\ny'all get it\njust tell people like hey i suck at this\ncan you all teach me\ncool right because like who's gonna like\nyeah of course we can teach you\nabsolutely i would love to teach you\nokay here's how this works\nand then what's going to happen if\nthey're decent human beings one of them\nis going to be better at all the rest\nand that person is going to be on your\nteam and then you'll kind of break even\nbecause they're going to carry your\nshitty ass\nbut then you still get to kind of high\nfive and you can say hey man like thank\nyou so much for carrying my shitty ass\nif i was a little bit better then you'd\nturn to your opponents you could say if\ni was a little bit better i'd be trash\ntalking y'all because we would have\nabsolutely destroyed you i suck at this\nand this guy is like amazing and we\nstill ended up somewhat even\nright\nand then like then i'd be trash talking\nbut it's clear that i can even though we\nkind of broke even and then you all just\nlaugh\nright you'll get this it's just\ni don't know how else this you just\nyou get it\nso\nif you guys are curious\nhow to do this\nokay if you're curious like because like\nwhat am i doing\nright like we're sort of\ncommenting in a meta\nit's hard to internalize that's what i'm\ntalking about we're gonna\nthis is why we develop i swear to god\nthis is the hardest thing that we're\ntrying to do so we developed\ngroup coaching\nto help you with this stuff the thing is\nit is so hard to\nhelp people understand what group\ncoaching is\nso if we think a little bit about\nnot getting too caught up in yourself\npaying attention to what's going on in\nthe room\nreflecting or commenting about what's\ngoing on in the room but not excessively\ntuning into other people having a shared\nexperience with other people that you\nbenefit from and other ben people\nbenefit from reason we developed group\ncoaching is because we realize that we\nneed a sandbox for people to learn this\ncrap and actually implement it\nso group coaching has two levels it's\nnot so we're going to formally train you\nin these techniques about how to\ninteract with another human being how to\nbe empathic we've got a study running\nright now to see if group coaching\nboosts eq\nwhich is we're pretty sure it does\nthe other thing about group coaching is\nwe're going to use these skills though\nwe're going to teach it to you and then\nyou won't even realize\nhow well you're learning them because\nthen we're gonna turn it to like more\nstandard goals\nlike i don't know what what kind of job\nto get i don't know i'm struggling to\nfind a relationship i have trouble\nsetting limits with my parents\num like i'm confused about what to do\nwith my life like i'm stuck in a\ndead-end job you take all of these\nproblems\nand then like you know we're gonna like\ntry to help you with those problems but\nwe're gonna use a skill set which is\ntransferable to other parts of your life\nand as you boost your eq you're going to\nbe able to tune into other people you're\ngoing to be able to tune into yourself\nand once you tune into yourself then\nyou're going to understand resistance\noh i should do this but why don't i do\nthis\nyou don't know you're blind\nas to why you don't do something because\nyou don't know what's your internal\nstate\nright so how do you learn that stuff you\nhave to you have to practice this stuff\nyou have to work with these skills other\npeople are going to reflect they're\ngoing to notice things about you and\ngroup you're going to notice things\nabout other people in group the wildest\nthing is that you will notice things\nabout yourself in other people and\nthat's when it clicks\nholy crap this is exactly what happens\nto me\nso why did we do group coaching it's\nbecause of the aoe effect this is wild\nright because everyone's like okay\npersonal coaching like sure is great and\nfantastic and it tends to be full\nbecause people get a lot of value out of\nit so i'm not saying it's bad in any way\nbut the key thing that we discovered\nthat i discovered by showing up on\ntwitch and youtube and doing stuff\npublicly is that you can actually learn\nabout yourself by observing another\nperson\nbut the observation that what you\nobserve has to be authentic\nit can't be like an edited blog post\nit has to be an unfiltered experience of\nthe person and you're going to see the\nresistance in your callings when you're\nin group you guys said\ni remember there was a one i was running\na group once or one person was like\nmy goal for the week is i'm gonna cook\nsomething we're like okay what are you\ngonna cook i'm gonna make shakshuka\nthen we check in next week did you make\nshakshuka no i didn't and then the\nexcuses start coming\nright and then as you see that your\n meter starts going off\nand then you learn how to detect the bs\nyou point it out to that person hey man\nyou're bs'ing what really got in the way\nand then when you try to do something\nand the excuses start popping up in your\nmind your bs meter is going to go off\nbecause now you've developed it\nand then you'll see the bs and you'll be\nlike hey wait a minute what am i doing\nto myself\nhow am i shooting myself in the foot\nright so that's why we do it because\nthere's there's a certain amount of like\ngetting in the ring that\ngroup coaching offers that personal\ncoaching sort of doesn't like you're\nalso in the ring i mean it's good\nbecause you're working with someone\nwho's you know tuned in to you so that\nthey've been formally trained in all\nthis stuff but if you want to learn this\nstuff if you want to boost your eq we\nthink personal coaching also boosts eq\nbut group is like it's it's fun like\ni think consistently there's a handful\nof coaches and i sort of fall into this\ncategory where i personally prefer group\nwork to personal work as a facilitator\nso i really enjoy working with people\nindividually it's like really fantastic\nbut man it's group fun like it's great\nyou"
