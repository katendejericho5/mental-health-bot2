    "transcript": "burnout is notoriously hard to treat and\nthat I believe is because people are\ntrying to fix it like sort of like in a\nmedical way we tend to devalue a lot of\nwhat we go through and we tend to assume\nthat if we have things to be grateful\nfor then we can't be burnt out be\nthoughtful about okay what's leading to\nthe burnout and then you can intervene\non it is this a me component is there\nsomething I can work on here or do I\nneed to set boundaries with my boss and\nsaying hey you're asking too much of me\nall right so let's talk about burnout\nthen\nso the first thing to understand is that\nlike burnout is increasing and the\nreason I wanted to talk about it today\nis because I think a lot of people are\nactually burnt out and don't even\nrealize it and that's because the term\nhas been tossed around so much that\neveryone will just sort of say like oh\nmy God I'm so burnt out uh but the World\nHealth Organization has actually like\nlooked into this a fair amount there\nhave been lots of res archers a guy\nnamed I think um freudenberg and then\nChristina mlock there have been like\nlots of psychologists and stuff who have\nreally looked into this and burnout is\nabsolutely like a real thing and I think\nthe real challenge is that we don't\nreally understand what burnout looks\nlike or feels like and there tend to be\na lot of things that we tell ourselves\nthat invalidate our experiences of\nburnout so the first thing is that so a\nlot of people who are actually on the\ncusp of burnt out or are burnt out will\nsay to themselves things like oh like my\nlife is pretty good like I have a stable\njob I have a good relationship you know\nmy boss is nice to me I'm not taking\nadvantage of or whatever like they look\nat their life and their life is\nobjectively good and when they look at\ntheir life and their life is objectively\ngood they sort of assume that if things\nare good if I have stuff to be grateful\nfor then I must not be burnt out so this\nis like the first thing that people run\ninto which is that what I see time and\ntime and time again is that someone has\nlike a situation that's actually pretty\ngood like either they're doing okay in\nschool or they're going to work this is\na very common scenario where it's I sort\nof like wake up I go to work I kind of\nlike my job right like it's pretty\ninteresting and I get compensated pretty\nwell then I kind of come home and I have\na little bit of time to myself I maybe\ngame a little bit maybe I exercise a\nlittle bit and then it's like bedtime\nand then it's kind of like rinse and\nrepeat for like the next 30 Years and\nthey kind of look at their life and they\nthey sort of feel like they don't have a\nright to complain\nand what they sort of feel is not\nsomething that is overtly mental illness\nso when we think a little bit about oh\nI'm really struggling at work or I'm\nstressed out at work people think about\noh my God I'm losing my hair my hair is\nturning gray I have an ulcer um I have\ntrouble getting out of bed in the\nmorning morning like you know I'm\ngaining weight like I can't sleep like\npeople look at all these inflated\nsymptoms as signs of problems and once\nyou get to that inflated symptom like oh\nmy god I've gained 10 PBS I've got an\nulcer and I can't sleep at night now I\nneed to go see a psychiatrist or now I\nneed to go see a therapist the stress is\ngetting to be too much and so we sort of\nhave this picture about you know what is\na problem like we have this kind of like\nidea of like oh my God right and this is\nlike the detective who drinks a little\nbit too much and is always popping ant\nacids and stuff like that in in the\ncrime thriller movie sort of like that's\nwhat we sort of think of as someone\nwho's burnt out right wrinkled clothes\nand kind of like you know works way too\nhard and stuff like that and a lot of\npeople who are burnt out will will sort\nof they'll assume that because they work\nmaybe 40 hours a week maybe 45 hours a\nweek they're not working 80 hours a week\nthey don't have all these different\nproblems they they must not be burnt\nout and so this is like a huge problem\nbecause I actually think there the\nburnout is increasing right so we sort\nof see that globally and part of the\nreason that it's increasing is because I\nI don't think people truly understand\nwhat burnout is or how vulnerable you\nare to it and furthermore how you could\nbe you may not even realize what it\nlooks like\nso the first thing that I'm going to do\nis sort of share with yall a little bit\nabout what burnout looks like then we're\ngoing to talk a little bit about how we\ndiscovered what burnout looks like what\nburnout doesn't look like sort of the\ndebate between what is burnout what is\ndepression and then we're going to kind\nof get into some more individual factors\nabout what have we learned contributes\nto burnout because this is the tricky\nthing is that when we talk a little bit\nabout how to fix burnout some of the\nthings are internal and some of the\nthings are external and that's what\nmakes it such a difficult problem to fix\nis because unlike other parts of mental\nhealth you can't sort of put\nresponsibility entirely on one one side\nof that right so if I've got a toxic\nworkplace environment let's say it's\ndiscriminatory that's not something that\nI have to deal with that's something\nthat you know I mean I have to deal with\nit but it's not something that's my\nresponsibility as someone who works\nthere to fix that like that's that's\ntheir job so if we look at the way that\nmental health has been understood it's\neither their job like oh my God this\nperson is a toxic box who is sexually\nharassing people that person needs to go\nand that's how we fix it it's the\nproblem's over there right which may be\ncompletely legitimate and then what\nwe've got is stuff like depression which\nis like all over here and that's where\nthe the employer is like oh no no no\nlike we don't need to change anything at\nwork we're going to give you a nice\nreferral source we'll give you health\ninsurance if you're in the US you know\nwe're going to like give you all the\nstuff here you take the stuff and you go\nfix it over there and so we have this\nmodel where like we put 100% of\nresponsibility on on either the the\nperson who's working or the person who's\nproviding work and the tricky thing\nabout burnout is that it's actually an\nintersection of the two which is part of\nthe reason why the old systems that we\nhave of addressing burnout are not\nreally working because it's not like\neither or it's a combination of both so\nlet's start with sort of understanding a\nlittle bit about where the where burnout\ncomes from and what it looks like so the\nfirst thing to understand is that\nburnout a lot of times when people feel\nburnt out the first thing that they'll\nexperience is a lack of energy\nand this and this is a really common\nproblem with people who are burnt out is\nthat they tend to devalue or kind of\ndon't make excuses for what they\nexperience so that's like kind of the\nfirst thing to understand about burnout\nso when I feel like I have low energy I\ndon't think that this is workplace\nrelated burnout I may think because of\nyou know the blowing up of the wellness\nindustry the explosion of the wellness\nindustry oh maybe I need to be like so\nyou you have people say like oh I need\nto be meditating more I need to start\ndoing yoga I need to start taking B12 oh\nlike I need to start drinking juice\nright so we'll sort of look at all the\nlike we'll kind of feel like low energy\nlike I can get up but it's not really a\nproblem because I can go to work I just\nfeel kind of tired when I go to work\nit's not like I'm getting bad\nperformance reviews you know I'm doing\nokay at work I kind of come home it's\nnot like I can't have fun I do enjoy you\nknow hanging out with my friends I kind\nof like kind of enjoy going for a walk\nbut life kind of feels like flat with\npeople who are burnt out so things AR\naren't quite as exciting there isn't\nquite as much energy so that's like kind\nof the first thing to think about so if\nyou're like if your primary experience\nis kind of just like not that anything\nis broken like people think like oh my\nGod I can't get out of bre bed because\nI'm so depressed and since they're not\nthere they think like oh it's not really\na problem right because I'm not so bad\nso just the first thing to understand is\nit's sort of like a general lack of\nenergy the second thing this is what's\nreally fascinating about what research\nhas revealed is the first thing that\nhappens the first phase of burnout is\nactually a lack of empathy so this is\nwhat we see is that like it's not that\nyou can't take care of yourself it's not\nthat your function is impaired it's that\nyou stop caring about other people so\nwhat this sort of leads to what this\nmanifest as is a bunch of cynicism so\npeople have sort of found that people\nwho are burnt out researchers have\ndiscovered that people who are burnt out\ntend to be very very cynical about their\njob right so like this is something that\nwe see a lot with clients that we've had\nespecially like who are in the tech\nindustry and stuff like that at HG we've\nworked with a lot of people from you\nknow major developers and and things\nlike that and what we sort of see is\nthat there's like this kind of like\nempathic lack of empathy that sort of\nresults in kind of a negative view of\nthe world so it's kind of like yeah I\ncan still do my job but it's not going\nto go well stuff is going to get screwed\nthere are going to be delays and all\nthat stuff can be true right because\nthat that can still be true but it's the\ncynicism with which you view it it's\nsort of like this fatalistic kind of\nhopeless not quite like I'm suicidal and\ndespairing and I need to quit my job but\nit's like everything's just going to go\nto no matter what I do kind of\nattitude and when you sort of have that\ncynicism it makes it very hard for you\nto be empathic towards other people\nright so when when your colleague like\ndrops the\nball it's very hard to sort of be\nempathic towards them because like you\nyou're just you have no bandwidth left\nright all your energy is already run run\nout you're kind of like low on energy to\nbegin with if we really think about\nempathy empathy requires energy for\nother people so the first thing is lack\nof energy the second thing is a lack of\nempathy and\ncynicism Okay the third thing that we\ntend to see with with burnout is um a\nsort of lack of enjoyment or sense of\nfulfillment with your job so this is\nwhere even though your performance may\nbe okay and there are uh there is\nresearch that shows that performance can\nbe kind of problematic but what I really\nlook for when I'm looking for Burnout is\npeople who generally speaking on paper\nlike their job but find it to be\nfulfilling in some fundamental way so\nthis is and this is the the challenge\nhere is we start to see like some of the\nchallenges some of the things that we do\nto devalue our burnout which is that you\nknow when I don't enjoy my job when I\ndon't find it fulfilling and I'm kind of\nin this situation what I tend to do is\ndevalue my own experience so this is\nwhere I'll say but I'm lucky to have a\njob right other people don't have a job\nas nice as I do oh I I'm lucky enough to\nbe working for Amazon I'm lucky enough\nto be working for twitch I'm I'm I'm\nlucky right so I get paid so much why\nwhy why am I complaining like I have no\nright to complain and so this is sort of\nwhat happens is when we when we find\nsort of a lack of fulfillment or\nenjoyment or things like that people who\nare burnt out once again remember\nthere's a lack of empathy right so\nsometimes there can even be a lack of\nself-empathy there can be a lack of\ncompassion towards oneself and we sort\nof do is like tell ourselves like why\nare we\ncomplaining so this is what I I kind of\nthink about these three things is like\nthe classic occult burnout and what I\nmean by occult is it's kind of hidden\nright it's sort of like you don't really\nrealize that you're burnt out because\nyou're not you're able to go to work\nevery day you're able to do okay you\nknow you may be have a short fuse this\nis another thing that we tend to see a\nlot is a short fuse is a very very\ncommon sign of burnout so it's not\ndepression it's not sadness it's not\nlike inability to do work but I tend to\nhave a short fuse I tend to be a little\nbit cynical you know we see this a lot\nin the medical profession where people\nstop caring about patients what it\nstarts to become is like I need to get\nthrough this work and so I can go home\nfor the day and I feel kind of wiped and\nthen it's like get up tomorrow and rinse\nand repeat right but like somewhere\nalong the way like especially caregivers\nlose the capacity to care for patients\nso it's I got to give this med\nmedication I have to write this order I\nhave to do this prescription I have to\ngo see this person I have to call this\nperson's family and and you lose sight\nof the patient and that's what what it\nlooks like in medicine but we see that\nin other fields as well where you just\nsort of like lose sight of the people\ninvolved you lose sight and you stop\nkind of caring about you know what\nactually matters and so this is sort of\nwhat burnout looks like so if you're\nsomeone who kind of experiences these\nthree things the first is a lack of\nenergy despite the ability to do work\nand this is really tricky because it\ndoesn't it doesn't a lot of people think\nlike oh as long as I'm able to work I'm\nfine right so that's that's why the\nburnout is kind of like flying under the\nradar there so it's a lack of energy the\nsecond thing is a lack of empathy which\ntends to go first actually before you\neven run out of energy empathy is going\nto be the first thing that goes sort of\na cynical attitude and a lack of\nfulfillment despite on paper often times\nenjoying your job okay so this is what\ncharacterizes burnout and when people\nwere sort of looking into this in the\nver very early stages I think maybe in\nthe 80s or 90s when people were\ncharacterizing burnout I may be wrong on\nthe time there what they sort of noticed\nis that this is a discret thing from\ndepression so when someone first kind of\ncame out with the term burnout a lot of\nthe academic Community were like oh\nyou're just describing depression right\nthis is no different from depression and\nthis is where the the researchers on B\nburnout actually took a step back and\nsaid well no actually we think this is a\ndiscrete entity and the debate still\ngoes on today we'll we'll kind of talk a\nlittle bit about that and so what they\nsort of noticed and this is what the\nWorld Health Organization ultimately\ndecided on is that burnout is\nspecifically related to to work stuff so\nif we think about what's the difference\nbetween depression and burnout\ndepression is something that you carry\nwith you right so we tend to think about\ndepression as more of an organic or\nbiologic sort of thing there's\nabsolutely a psychological component but\nfor example if you look at depression\npeople posit that there's a a\ndisturbance of the serotonergic system\nwithin our brain we know that there\nthere are changes to our hormonal levels\nand things like that there's evidence\nthat there's increased inflammation in\ndepression so we sort of think when I\nthink about depression I think about\nsomething that you carry with you and\neven though depression can be triggered\nby external circumstances as a clinician\nwhen I really look for depression what\nI'm looking for is an\nindependence of clinical stuff compared\nto circumstances so even though a\nbreakup May trigger a depressive episode\nwhen I really think about depression\nwhat I think of is even if that person\nstarts dating again and they're still\ndepressed because now the circumstan has\nbeen fixed that's when I really think\nabout clinical depression it may have\nbeen caused by a breakup but then like\nyou know a couple months later I'm I'm\ndating again and then like I'm still\nkind of depressed like that sort of\nsuggests that there's something\nindependent even though it can be\ntriggered by something so originally\nthere was debate about whether\ndepression is similar or the same as\nburnout ultimately the World Health\nOrganization and other definitions have\nkind of come out that it's it's\noccupational related so this is where\nyou know not necessarily changing your\noccupation because there are internal\ncomponents which we'll kind of get to\nbut that this is this is really\nsomething that's heavily influenced by\nyour work and that unlike depression\nwhich affects every dimension of your\nlife burnout kind of has a focal point\nwith being sort of Occupational in\nnature now I think that even today now\nthat that's sort of changing the way\nthat I've sort of understood burnout is\nthat it's more than just work it's\nreally the intersection of life with\nwork and it does it's not just work\nrelated that's kind of one of the\nproblems I was talking about earlier is\nthat it's I mean sort of caused by work\nsure but there's like an individual\ncomponent which I've come to\nappreciate so so this is where people\nsort of discovered this thing called the\nburnout syndrome there's now been\nresearch on it there's actually a really\ninteresting study um some people just to\ngive you all a sense of the debate some\npeople still believe that burnout is\nessentially Under the Umbrella of\ndepression so that we have depression\nand then there can be like an\noccupational depression versus other\nkinds of depressions the really\ninteresting thing is that there are a\ncouple of studies that have looked at\nhormonal\nlevels so we know that um depression or\nclinic depression is a stressful state\nphysiologically so for example our\nlevels of\nact\nadrenocorticoid\nadrenocorticotropic hormone I think is\nwhat act is our levels of cortisol are\nactually high in depression so we're in\nin sort of a high stress State whereas\nour hormonal levels in Burnout are\nactually neutral or low so this is kind\nof interesting because if you look at\nthe this the levels of stress hor\nhormones in a depressed person they're\nelevated whereas they're low or even\ncompletely normal or like not different\nfrom the average population in a burnout\nscenario and so that's where um it's\nkind of interesting because it sort of\nimplies that\nphysiologically things are less\nDisturbed in a burnout State compared to\na depressed state so it's kind of\ninteresting because there's there's\nevidence that burnout and depression\noverlap in some uh you know situations\nand the people who believe that they're\nessentially the same thing or variants\nof each other like have good data to\nsupport it and the people who believe\nthat burnout is a discreet Syndrome from\ndepression there's actually physiologic\nevidence for that too I personally\nbelieve I treat burnout is somewhat\ndifferent from depression and there's\neven some evidence that the hormonal\nprofiles for Burnout more overlap with\nsomething called atypical depression\nwhich is in Dr K's guide we kind of talk\nabout that what I call congruent\ndepression the point here is that you\nknow we're still figuring this stuff out\num\nthere's probably some degree of overlap\nbut I sort of treat them as as quite\ndiscreet because I find that from a a\ntreatment perspective or even like a\ncoaching perspective or corporate\nConsulting perspective that treating\nburnout as its own thing with its own\ninfluences and causes is like far more\neffective than just assuming it's\ndepression the other way to kind of\nsimply put that is when someone comes\ninto my office with burnout I start\nthinking about acting from a burnout\nperspective as opposed to prescribing\nanti-depressant medication which may or\nmay not help but depending on the\nsituation so that sort of touches on you\nknow is depression burnout is a burnout\ndepression it turns out that that in my\nopinion they're actually quite different\nthings okay so now just to kind of recap\nwe've talked a little bit about what\nwhat burnout is we've talked a little\nbit about you know why burnout is so\neasy to miss if you are experiencing it\nand the key things there are that we\ntend to devalue a lot of what we go\nthrough and we tend to assume that if we\nhave things to be grateful for then we\ncan't be burnt out the other issue there\nis that when we think about burnout\nwe'll often times think about what\ndepression looks like so I have\ndifficulty getting out of bed I have no\nenergy whatsoever whereas a lot of times\npeople who are burnt out are able to\nperform at a relatively normal level the\nchallenge is that they just don't feel a\nwhole lot of energy on the inside they\nhave they're cynical they don't have\nempathy they don't find any sense of\nfulfillment from their work which on\npaper they like and it's really that\ndiscrepancy which I I think really Clues\nme into burnout which is that on paper\nif your life looks good but you yourself\ndon't seem to be enjoying it then you\nshould definitely think about burnout\nalso on the differential there could be\nsomething like depression right so we\nknow that for example major depressive\ndisorder which is a clinical illness is\nsort of marked by something called\nanhedonia it's one of the most specific\nfeatures of depression so let's talk\nabout this for a second when we're\ntalking about something like a clinical\nillness there are some features which\nare common and some features which are\nspecific so what specific means is that\nit's more likely to be in depression\nthan in anything else and so anonia is\none of the specific features of\ndepression which means that people who\nare depressed are unable to enjoy or\nfind pleasure in activities that\nnormally would be pleasurable right so I\nnormally love playing video games but\nwhen I have a clinical depression i\ngames just don't feel as fun to me\nwhereas that's also somewhat of a\ndifference between depression and\nburnout in terms of what I've seen is\nthat people who are burnt out usually\ndon't get to the level of anhedonic they\nmay they may be energet they may have\nlow energy but if you can actually like\nget somewhere like if you can go to a\nparty if you can actually take a weekend\noff and like load up a video game you\ncan actually still have fun but you your\nmotivation is sort of lacking okay then\nso so we dug into a little bit about the\ndiffer differences between depression\nand burnout so now kind of what I want\nto get to is a little bit about like\nokay so if I'm burnt out or if this\ndescribes me how do I sort of tackle it\nhow do I understand how to fix this\nproblem and this is what's kind of\ninteresting about burnout is that it's\none of these things that's an\nintersection between what you can do and\nwhat can be done at the workplace and\ngenerally speaking I think the most\ncommon cause of burnout is globally and\nwe'll kind of build up to this in a\nsecond the most common cause of burnout\nis essentially someone who wants to work\nenjoys working but is somehow unable to\nor or runs into obstacles when they try\nto work right so what this means is that\nI like my job I like working with\npatients I enjoy doing what I do I like\nbeing able to help people right so I can\nenjoy all of those things so on paper I\nreally like my job but something happens\nin my workplace that gets in the way of\nme being able to do that and so usually\nwhen I think about burnout what I really\nthink about is an individual who's\ntrying really hard against a system that\ndoesn't let them and so this is where we\ncan kind of get into some of the details\nof what are the specific features of\nburnout because if you find yourself to\nbe in that situation then how can you\nstart to approach fixing things and this\nis where at HG you know we have a very\ncommon saying which is borrowed from the\npractice of clinical medicine which is\nthat good diagnosis precedes good\ntreatment and so in order to understand\nhow to fix burnout what we really need\nto do is understand what are the\ncontributors to burnout so remember\nburnout is caused by an\nindividual and their connection with a\ncompany or workplace\nusually I think situation also applies\nhere or\nenvironment and why do I sort of expand\nit like this it's because we can look at\nthings like caregiver burnout so we know\nthat for example like family members of\npeople who have cancer often times will\nexperience burnout because that once\nagain is a scenario where you care about\nyour loved one you're trying to do\nreally right by them right you're trying\nto pick up their medication and you go\nwith them to chemo and you do this and\nyou do that and you're kind of trying to\ndo everything that you can but because\nof the nature of the cancer because of\nthe intensiveness of it because of the\nmental health impact on them you're you\nhave a bunch of\neffort but there's a discrepancy between\neffort and yield so what you sort of see\nis that like what you get out of it is\ndown here and this is really where the\nburnout comes from so this is the effort\nyou put in this is the yield you get and\nwhat I tend to see in people who are\nburnt out is that they try way harder\nthan what they get and so this is like\nrunning into a system that doesn't allow\nyour efforts to be seen and this is sort\nof why you don't feel kind of inspired\nand stuff at work is because like this\nis where your inspiration is this is\nwhere your desire is and yet despite the\nfact that you're putting in all the\neffort you're you're getting a low yield\nwhich means that this Gap over here is\nwhere burnout kind of\nenters because you're trying really\nreally hard and this is the other thing\nabout burnout is people sort of assume\nfor a moment like sometimes especially\nlike the boomer generation and stuff\nwill sort of assume that people who\nburnt out are lazy but I think what they\ndon't really realize is it's not like\nit's not that people are lazy it's that\nthere's a huge gap between the amount of\neffort that you put in and the yield\nthat you\nget so let's kind of look at what are\nthe different things that result in this\nGap okay where where where does this\nkind of Gap come from and this is what's\ncool is that um mlock who was one of the\nthe central researchers developed a lot\nof the core research on on burnout sort\nof isolated six factors that result in\nBurnout okay oh hold on a second I don't\nknow if you guys can yall can see\nthat okay yeah youall can\nsee so let's talk a a little bit about\nthe six\nfactors and this is where\num that lead to\nburnout this is where as we think about\nthese\nfactors we can sort of think a little\nbit about is this a problem in my\nsituation and then we can Target our\nSolutions okay so the first is\nworkload the second is\ncontrol third is\nreward fourth is\ncommunity fifth is fairness\nand the six's\nvalues so when we're talking about\nburnout what we tend to find is when\nthere's a discrepancy between your\nworkplace and you in these\nDimensions this is where the gap of\nburnout comes from now it's also\nimportant to remember for a moment that\nthis is part the reason why burnout is\nhard to fix because some of these things\nmay be workplace related but some of\nthem are actually internal and that's\nwhat I'd really like to go through today\nwith y'all so the first is that you know\nthere's a workload related aspect of\nburnout so the simplist is that people\nare\noverworked okay so like you know very\nvery common contributor to burnout is\nlike you know I I'm salaried at 40 hours\nI used to be hourly I used to get paid\novertime\num and now I'm salaried but like my work\nmy work is increasing so I'm not getting\nany bonuses I'm not getting any overtime\nmaybe that's a reward we'll get to that\nin a second but often times if people\nare overworked you know and there's a\nwork there there's a discrepancy between\nhow much you're willing to\nwork and how much your employment\noverworks you and this can sort of\ncontribute to\nburnout right so a lot of people may say\nthat okay the solution is that the\nworkplace should decrease the amount\nthat they they make me work which is a\ntotally valid solution the point here is\nthat there could be an individual\ncomponent here as well we had an\ninterview a couple weeks ago with a\nsoftware developer who was sort of\nsaying I'm incredibly burnt out and this\nis where sometimes it's important to\nunderstand that if you're overworked at\nwork there's a workplace contribution\nand there could be an individual\ncontribution and what does that mean\nwell\nsometimes the reason we're overworked is\nbecause we kind of like take on\nadditional projects and stuff right so\nthis is where we can even go a little\nbit beyond the the workplace we can\nthink about your home situation you know\nhow many things are you managing around\nthe house do you have side projects do\nyou have side hustles gigs you know\nworking\n247 sometimes for example we'll also see\ninternal emotional\ndrives that lead to overwork so this\nisn't the kind of thing where your boss\nis abusive or taking advantage of you\nbut you yourself really really want your\nboss to like you you want your boss to\nthink that you're the best worker you\nneed to feel like the best worker you\nwant to be the best worker and so since\nyou want to be the best worker at work\nthat emotional Drive causes you to\nindividually contribute to your own\nworkload so you volunteer for more\nprojects you show up early you stay late\nyou do all this kind of stuff and then\nthat increases your workload\nso this is where this is I think a prime\nexample of why burnout is so tricky is\nbecause what some people will do is\nthey'll kind of say\nlike some people will say like oh my God\nmy workplace is so toxic they take\nadvantage of me but what I've oftentimes\nfound is that when people are actually\nwhen you're looking at burnout that\nthere's a workplace contribution and\nthere is a u contribution so this is\nwhere solutions could be boundary\nsetting right so you can let your your\nyour boss know hey I'm actually not\navailable to do overtime on short notice\num it could be sort of working on your\nemotional drives but workload is\nabsolutely a big piece of it the other\nuh issue with burnout is that as we sort\nof look at these factors often times\nwhat makes it hard to deal with is\npeople will say oh change your job right\nso that's what the solution will'll come\nto because if you're at a place where\nyou're overworked you may change your\njob but the tricky thing is that some of\nyour individual emotional drives may\nfollow you this is why changing your job\ndoesn't necessarily fix all your\nproblems because sometimes you take your\nproblems with you okay second thing that\nleads to burnout is is control and\nspecifically a discrepancy between how\nmuch control you want and how much\ncontrol you have so in the workplace\nthis for example can be someone who\nmicromanages\nyou right so like you want to work your\nparticular way and you're like yeah this\nis what I'm going to do I don't want to\ndo this I want to do it this way and\nthen your boss is like no I want you to\ndo it this way and they're kind of\nbreathing down your neck and stuff like\nthat\nso\nmicromanaging um Can absolutely be a a\ncause for you know uh discrepancy in\ncontrol at work but the flip side of\nthis is also true where sometimes you'll\nhave people who are kind of control\nfreaks right so on the one hand you've\ngot a manager who's kind of like really\ninto your business and on the other hand\nyou're someone who is such a control\nfreak that everything needs to happen a\nparticular way and you may want to do\nthings your way but there may be other\ncompany consider ations that allow make\nit so that actually you doing it your\nway is like not really appropriate so\nwhen I work with people who who are\nburnt out what we generally try to do is\ntry to understand okay what's the\ndiscrepancy in control you know what\namount of this is really coming from\nthem and what amount of this this is\nreally coming from\nyou another big factor for Burnout is\nreward so this is where we were talking\na little bit about you know moving from\nhourly and overtime\nto\nsalaried right or just kind of what kind\nof um compensation you're kind of\nlooking\nfor and why do I sort of list this as an\nindividual problem I'll give you guys\nkind of like an example so you know if\nyou're someone who wants to be the best\nat work that's something where like if\nsomeone else you know gets paid\npotentially more than you do or gets a\nbigger we see this a lot in finance\nwhere people will kind of get paid\nbonuses and then what matters to some\npeople that I've worked with is not\nactually the amount of bonus that they\nget paid but the amount of bonus they\nget paid in relation to other people and\nso this is kind of tricky but like even\nreward is not something so simple this\nis where a lot of people like will say\nlike oh what needs to happen is like my\ncompany just needs to pay me more like\nthat's I'm under I'm underpaid which\ncould be true right and there definitely\nare companies that will sort of try to\ntake advantage to People by moving them\nto salary Etc but the truth is that the\nway that you experience a reward for\nyour work at work has an individual\ncomponent as well so like this is where\nego or being the best can kind of come\nin do do you get paid the most right so\nI I'm kind of recalling a joke from the\noffice where Michael Scott in Leo of\narays got two plaques for employee of\nthe year right so they're like you're\nsuch an employee of the year that you\nwere going to give you two plaques\ninstead of a raise so this is where the\nreward that you may be looking for may\nnot be entirely appropriate which I know\nis like shocking in the anti-work uh era\nbut this is where when I work with\npeople in finance like we we start to\nask like serious questions about what is\nthe what is the reward you actually want\nto what's important is it is it a\nparticular dollar value does it just\nneed to be bigger than it was before is\nit just never enough what would be\nenough and as we start to look into this\nwe also run into into things like you\nknow do you need to be better than your\npeers so sometimes I'll talk to people\nand I'll be like well how happy are you\nwith your compensation they'll be like\nit's terrible it's like okay well how\nmuch is it and they'll toss out a number\nand they like oh okay what's the problem\nwith it well so and so gets paid more\nand so that's really the problem and so\nif we're thinking a little bit about why\nyou're burnt out related to reward is\nthere a company component absolutely is\nit possible that you're being underpaid\nabsolutely and at the same time there\nmay be a a certain amount of lack of\ncontentment there may be a certain\namount of ego there may be a certain\namount of like you losing sight of\nactually what's important in terms of\nreward right maybe it doesn't matter\nthat you're better than your peers maybe\nthe most important thing is the dollar\nvalue and this is where a lot of people\nmay assume oh yeah the most important\nthing is the dollar value but when it\nactually comes to human beings and\ncompensation and psychology the truth is\nwe're not all just robots making\nFinancial transactions right we want to\nbe liked we want to be revered we want\nto be successful we want to be viewed as\nby our peers as\nintelligent I saw a study recently that\nshowed that the most important thing is\nnot what your boss thinks of your\ncompetence but what your peers think of\nyour\ncompetence so if there's a discrepancy\nin reward between what you're looking\nfor and what your company is is\nproviding that could also lead to\nburnout so another important thing is\ncommunity so this is where sometimes you\nknow we we live in or our workplace you\nknow some people will sort of say like\noh you know this we really think of our\nemployees as family members and things\nlike that that can be both a good thing\nor a bad thing sometimes increasingly so\nunfortunately that is viewed\nas um that is language that's used to\ntell people we're going to try to take\nadvantage of you in the same way that\nfamily members don't set good boundaries\nand take advantage for of each other but\nthe truth is that\nisolation leads to\nburnout so depending on your your job\nlike what kind of community there is\nright like that could contribute to your\num sense of\nburnout this is where it's kind of a\ndouble-edged sword because it's it's not\njust your your job but often times like\njoining professional organizations and\nthings like that can help alleviate that\nbut human beings are fundamentally we're\nCommunity organisms right we're we're\nlike tribal in nature we're not designed\nto be on our own now what about the\nindividual contribution so let's say\nthat your company you know does do a lot\nfor Community doesn't do a whole lot for\nCommunity but is there an indiv\nindividual contribution or not\nabsolutely so there are all kinds of\nthings like social\nanxiety\ncomparisons the\ndesire to isolate so I see this a lot in\nterms of individual contributions of\nburnout where I feel isolated do you\nwant to be isolated no I don't want to\nbe isolated I hate being isolated well\nwhy don't you go to work events uh\nbecause I don't want\nto because I don't know if people I'm\ngoing to talk to anyone there I don't\nknow if people are going to like me\nthere I don't know like this other\nperson is so much funnier than I am\nright so there when it comes to\nisolation like sure your community may\nbe able I mean your company may be able\nto do things like happy hours and things\nlike that but at the end of the day\nthere's an individual contribution to\ncommunity as well how do you participate\nin the community and in drastic\nsituations I've even seen some people\nwho will sort of take the lead in in\nthis kind of thing right where they sort\nof recognize that Community is something\nthat I can contribute to as well so\nthey'll host a barbecue or they'll\ninvite people over or they'll start a\nbook club or they'll start playing D and\nD with co-workers and things like that\ngot to be careful about that sort of\nthing so you know be careful about\nboundaries so the next thing that we\nsort of have to consider in terms of\nburnout is fairness this one is huge\nprobably in my sense like even the\nbiggest one even more important than\nworkload um in terms of my personal\nexperience with people that I've worked\nwith is that there has to be a culture\nof fairness\nat work so if if someone feels like\nthey're being treated unfairly it's\ngoing to spike their burnout through the\nroof now this is what's kind of\ninteresting is that you know work should\nbe fair this is what's really\nfascinating we've seen this a lot in our\ncoaching\nprogram but there could be\nperceptions of a lack of\nfairness this is critical\nso unfortunately I hate to say this I\nhate to admit\nthis but just because you think things\nare unfair doesn't mean that things are\nactually unfair right so the human mind\nis super tricky in the sense that like\nI'll give you guys like the one of my\nfavorite examples of Roommates in\ndishes so every time one of your\nroommates does one of your\ndishes it doesn't register 100% but\nevery time that you do one of your\nroommates dishes it registers a th% so\nhuman beings have an internal bias where\nthey tend to overestimate their extra\ncontributions and underestimate other\npeople's contributions so this is where\nfeeling taken for\ngranted can sometimes come from right\nlike you're doing a bunch of stuff that\nno one else at work is doing you're the\none who always gets coffee in the\nmorning and no one else ever does that\nthat's unfair this is going to cause I\nguarantee you a disproportionate sense\nof burnout if you feel like you're being\ntreated unfairly now the challenge is\nthat there is actual unfair treatment at\nwork right like this is the kind of\nthing where it's like of course there's\nunfair treatment at work I mean no one's\nno one's perfect everyone's human so\nthere could be people playing politics\nthere could be\nnepotism right there could be like\nfavoritism there could be like oh like I\nplay this game I'm a DOTA player and my\nboss is a DOTA player and this other\nperson is a league player therefore the\nleague player feels like they're left\nout because we're playing DOTA etc etc\nso there are going to be issues of\nfairness in the\nworkplace um the challenge is that\nsometimes especially depending on how\negotistical or if you think about a\nnarcissist at work the perception of\nunfairness is going to be through the\nroof even though things may not be\nunfair so even in the situation of\nfairness ideally your workplace is fair\nit's not going to be\n100% but you have an INT individual\ncontribution to that as well and this is\nsomething that we've worked on a lot in\nterms of coaching where you know we've\neven taught our coaches how\nto discern and what questions to ask to\ngauge whether the perception of fairness\nis within the mind of the person or at\nthe workplace right because these are\ntwo very different things and if we\nthink about fixing this problem do you\nAdvocate at work for more fair\nconditions\nbecause the the problem here is that if\nstuff is actually fair and you make a\nclaim that it's unfair because you're\negotistical and narcissistic and can't\nsee other people's perspectives it's\ngoing to actually backfire and you'll do\nworse at work because then everyone's\ngoing to be like this person is\ncomplaining about something that is\ncompletely inappropriate\nversus if you feel like things are you\nknow maybe you're we've seen the\nopposite of this as well where you're\nwilling to be a doormat\nat work so you don't advocate for\nyourself you don't you know you don't\nstand up for yourself and your actual\nworkplace is unfair but you're not able\nto advocate for yourself because of\ninternal emotional\ndrives so are things that work Fair well\nnot really but I don't want people to\nthink that I'm whiny I want to be seen\nas a team player I want to get promoted\nI want my boss to like me right there\nare all kinds of internal things that\nwill allow you to tolerate and even\npositively reinforce an unfair work\nenvironment there's absolutely an in\nindividual contribution when it comes to\nfairness and burnout and that indivi\nindividual contribution can go either\nway either it can create unfair\nsituations out of fair situations right\nbecause you're not levelheaded up here\nyou're maybe jealous or you're maybe\ninsecure or it can do the opposite where\nyour inability to set boundaries\npropagates an unfair situation at work\nright so this is tricky but this\nabsolutely leads to burnout so what we\nsort of know is that when employees feel\nlike they're being treated unfairly\nthey're much more likely to burn out\nright because this is where if we kind\nof go back to our yield graph right this\nis where you\nare this is the effort that you're\nputting in and then this is like the\nyield that someone else gets for the\nsame\neffort and then this Gap right here is\nGNA burn people out even more if that\nkind of makes sense youall get\nthat so when you're putting in a certain\namount of work and someone else is\nputting in the same amount of work and\nthey get twice the yield and you get\nhalf the yield that is much more likely\nfor you to burnout and remember what are\ngoing to be the the signs of burnout\nlike let's kind of think through this a\nlittle bit right it's a lack of empathy\nlike of course I'm not going to care\nabout my cooworker who's working half as\nhard as I am and they're getting like\nyou know they're getting rewarded just\nas much as I like screw them it's going\nto make me cynical about the workplace\nlike why would I be excited to work at a\nplace where I some people are doing half\nthe work and getting paid the same and\nI'm doing twice the work and I'm getting\npaid the same like why would I do that\nso that leads to\ncynicism would it lead to a sense of\nfulfillment with your work of course not\nbecause even if you're doing work that's\namazing if you're like you know\nperforming surgery on people who have\ncancer and you're like saving lives day\nin and day out like that work is\nimpactful but your mind is so caught up\non this discrepancy between how much you\nwork and how much they work that you're\nnot able to appreciate the aspects of\nyour job job and then if someone asks\nyou hey do you like your job and you can\nsay like yeah I actually like maybe not\nthis one in particular but I love what I\ndo I love saving lives I love doing\nsurgery it's exciting and blah blah blah\nYad y y and that's what happens is\npeople love what they do and yet they\ncan still feel burnt out that's really\ninternally confusing for them so they\nkind of conclude is like ah I must not\nbe burnt out it's just it'll get better\neventually\nokay so last thing arguably the most\nimportant thing is a discrepancy in\nvalues\nso in my experience of working with\nConsulting with\ncorporations you know having worked with\npeople myself what people want is to be\nchallenged and want to be valued that's\nwhat I try to do when like in terms of\nthe the guidance that I try to provide\nfor people people don't I I I mean maybe\npeople do want this but in my experience\npeople actually want to work right so\nlike people want to make an impact on\nthe world like they want to do something\nthat's challenging they don't just don't\nwant to sit sit around in AFK all day we\nhave tons of people in our community are\nsitting around in afking all day and\nthey post all the time about hey I'm\ntired of afking I want to do something\nwith my life so people want to do\nsomething impactful so people want to\nbe they want to be\nchallenged and they want to be\nvalued so when you are challenged and\nyou succeed this leads to a sense of\nfulfillment\nwhen you are challenged and you succeed\nand someone notices that when someone\nsays damn you did awesome today like\nstrong work right when people appreciate\nwhat you do they appreciate the effort\nthat you put in whether it's your\nclients or your you know whatever like\nlike if you're making Burgers like it\ndoesn't matter like if you make a really\ngood burger and someone comes up to you\nit's like man that burger was awesome\nright you that's going to make you feel\nfulfilled so in terms of values\nwhat I tend to advocate for in terms of\nwhen I work with you know a company is\nis like to try to help them understand\nthat like if you want to get the best\nout of your employees like you need to\nactually challenge them in a way that\nthey're okay with right not not just\nlike make life hard for them but like\nyou know push them like let them let\nthem grow as people let them do better\nyou know let challenge them to do more\num and also value them appropriately so\nif they if they do excel like reward\nthem right it's not just a plaque give\nthem a bonus give them a raise whatever\nright so this is what people want is to\nbe valued and\nchallenged the challenge lies where when\nwe're talking about kind of the\ncompany versus the\nindividual if there's a discrepancy and\nvalues this can lead to a huge amount of\nburnout so we're going to talk about\nmedicine here so what does a doctor care\nabout helping a\npatient what do like a hospital system\ncare about\nbilling and money right so we'll see\nthis especially with like for-profit\nmedical institutions right so it's like\nthere's a guy who's got an MBA who's\nlike CEO of the hospital system and he's\nlike he's never taken care of a patient\nin his life he's interested in\nmaximizing money that's what they're\nhired to do right it's he's not a bad\nperson it's just like that's what the\nsystem is designed for right so when you\nsee a discrepancy in these kinds of\nvalues because sometimes these come into\nconflict where you know\nand this is what kind of leads to\nburnout so like when when Physicians are\nsort of told to emphasize billing over\npatient care because Physicians are okay\nbilling like it's fine to bill for your\nservices but when there's a discrepancy\nbetween you know sacrificing actually\nhelping a person for the sake of making\nmoney this is what burns people way out\nin medicine so this is where like as a\nas a doctor I'll just share my own\nexperience I can work a 30-hour shift\nlike helping human beings I can do that\nno problem you can you can come and get\nme at 23 hours at 23 hours and 59\nminutes and you can say Dr kenoa I know\nyou're about to clock out of your shift\nin in 60 seconds but someone has just\ncome into the emergency room after a\nsuicide attempt would you please be\nwilling to see them before you leave so\nand so is running late and we really\nneed this person needs your help and I'd\nbe like absolutely because that's what\nI'm there to\ndo what am I not there to do Dr kenoa\nit's it's one minute you have one minute\nof your shift left we need you to call\nthe insurance company so that we can get\npaid for this service that we're\nproviding and they're saying they're not\ngoing to cover it will you call them and\nthat's when I kind of say\npolitely go\nyourself right so it's like it's dealing\nwith insurance companies in that moment\nwhich is not something that I want to do\nit's okay to deal with insurance\ncompanies but it's like when when\nlike you know I'm here to help people\nnot talk to someone in an insurance\ncompany to get compens that's not what\nexcites me about my job and so even then\nI'm happy to do that at times right like\nI understand it's part of the it's part\nof the process and it's not all bad by\nany means but in terms of like the value\ndiscrepancy between why I show up and\nwhy my job wants me there the more that\nthat value discrepancy changes the more\nlikely I am to\nburnout right and so this is kind of\nwhat what is is crucial is that when\nyou're thinking a little bit about your\nburnout\nhow do your values align with the job\nthat you're doing and for a lot of\npeople who are especially in entry-level\npositions it's like it's hard to really\nalign your values with what you're\nsupposed to be doing because you're kind\nof learning you're kind of like a peon\nyou're kind of like an intro person you\nknow you're an analyst in an investment\nbank and that's it's hard because it's a\nlot of grunt\nwork so think a little bit about your\nvalues and and think a little bit about\nyou know what what needs to be kind of\nfixed here um this is absolutely where\nyou know sometimes if the values of the\norganization of the culture of the\norganization is really just not a good\nfit I do think it's actually a good idea\nto move jobs but sometimes this is also\nwhere you can kind of like do some\ninternal work and try to figure out a\nlittle bit about okay what do I care\nabout should I be caring about different\nthings what's my Dharma in this\nsituation right and so you can kind of\nwork on your value sum as well but this\nis the kind of thing where I think that\nit's very very hard uh to internally fix\nthis problem especially when it comes to\nvalues you can advocate for some kind of\nchange in your company um and that\nabsolutely can happen but like this one\nI think is the biggest one where ideally\nthe job that you have aligns with the\nvalues that you have and if these two\nthings are in alignment you're in a\nreally really good\nsituation so let's kind of summarize so\nif we look at these if we look at\nburnout burnout is characterized by a\ncouple of things lack of\nenergy lack of empathy\nlack of\nfulfillment these three things in\nturn will lead to\ncynicism and when a lot of people think\nabout burnout they don't think about\ncynicism as like the primary\nexperience but as we sort of look at the\ncynicism we can see where this comes\nfrom right because there's an unfair\nenvironment\nour values aren't aligned I'm not\ngetting\nrewarded I'm\nisolated right we've got these different\nfactors I'm\noverworked and I'm I have there's a lack\nof\ncontrol so we can see that this is where\nit ends up now the interest in thing is\nthat a lot of people struggle with\nburnout so burnout is notoriously hard\nto treat okay people have been trying\nfor decades and it's notoriously hard to\nfix and that I believe is because people\nare trying to fix it like sort of like\nin a medical way it's sort of like\nhere's the work\nenvironment and what we're really good\nat with Western science is I'm going to\ntake you know a pair a scalpel and I'm\ngoing to cut\nhere I'm going to cut here and I'm going\nto excise the tomb\nand then it'll be fine right so if I if\nyou're depressed I'm going to let's fix\nthat with an\nSSRI it's like a medical interventions\nlike we're going to go and we're going\nto fix this thing okay we've got sexual\nharassment problems at the workplace\nwe're going to call in this expert who's\ngoing to do a training then we're going\nto give everyone a test and then it's\ngoing to be\nfixed this is how corporations function\nthey're like oh we've got a problem\nlet's hire someone to just like just\ntake care of it right here and then the\nrest of this is going to stay the same\nwe're not going to fix any of that\nthat's too too much work fixed we like\nthese surgical\ninterventions now the challenge with\nburnout is that like it's not just here\nright because it's it's all these\ndifferent things it's are you\nrewarded do you have\ncontrol are you egotistical you know\nwhat part of this is coming from\nyou because now this is the thing that\nthat companies don't usually work like\nvery highly individually with people to\nmanage their burnout right it's like oh\nwe're going to fix some things in the\ncompany and then we're going to\nOutsource some of the stuff but there's\nno integration of the two and so when it\ncomes to fixing burnout I think It\nultimately results in kind of this table\nso you have to go through if you find\nyourself in this situation if you find\nyourself being cynical and this is the\nreal problem is that you may change jobs\nand it could fix some of it but then\nlike even if you change jobs are you\nintentionally realizing what about the\nnew job fixes it because most people\ndon't this is why they kind of like move\naround randomly without sort of like I'm\nnot happy here let me apply somewhere\nelse maybe the grass is greener on the\nother side grass is greener on this\nother side grass is greener on the other\nside until they find a company that does\nalign with their values and they're like\nokay this company's great but even in\nthat process they're not thinking\nintentionally about okay what is it\nabout this company that I dislike so\nwhat I'd recommend to you if you're\nburnt out is go through this list and\nlike address each one of these issues\nwhat's the issue here is my environment\nunfair\nis this a value discrepancy am I being\ninappropriately or other people being\ninappropriately rewarded do I feel like\nI should be getting more money do I feel\nisolated is it a lack of control what\nwhat is going on and then for each of\nthese Dimensions think a little bit\nabout because this is the other thing\nthat's tending to happen nowadays right\nso when you have some of these Echo\nChambers forming especially around work\nstuff like if you go on LinkedIn you'll\nget all kinds of like toned deaf posts\nfrom managers talking about how\nemployees need to learn how to work more\nand things like that so they're\ncompletely missing the point and then\nyou'll also see things like the antiwork\nsubreddit where people I think are also\nmissing the point where they there's no\nunderstanding that there could be\nindividual contributions to this right\nit's always the company's fault and so\non LinkedIn it's always the employees\nfault these whiny little employees and\nthen on some of the anarchos subreddits\nit's always the evil Corporation and in\nmy experience like working with actual\nhumans it's both right that's why this\nis so hard to fix it's because you can't\nsolve half of the problem so this is\nwhere like if you have issues with\ncontrol how much of this is like you\nneed to surrender your\ncontrol or like you know you need to\nreally be like it you need to set limits\naround micromanaging because the other\nthing is the remember that the boss can\nbe burnt out too so why is the boss\nburnt out because the boss micromanages\ntoo damn much you all get that and just\nlike oh my God like I can't relax why\ncan't you relax well I I have 14\nemployees and I have to spell check\nevery single one of their reports cuz\nthey could make a mistake and it's like\nwell then you need to take a step back\nright and so what I recommend to people\nwho are burnt out is to recognize that\nthere are you know first of all it's a\nreal\nthing recognize that there are six major\ncontributors to it and then be like\nspecific with your approach to it start\nto really think little bit about okay\nwhich one of these things is the problem\nand then once you sort of start to\nfigure out okay I really do feel like\nI'm unfairly compensated or maybe the\nthe reason is because you don't have\nyou're not good at setting limits\nbecause you want your boss to like you\nyour boss went out on a limb and got you\nthis job and they recommended you for\npromotion above all of your colleagues\nand you don't want to disappoint them\nand since you don't want to disappoint\nthem you can't say no to\nthem right and then you feel like you're\nunfairly compensated because you're\nnever saying no and you're getting paid\nthe same amount and so like what's the\nsolution there is it to get a raise like\nmaybe but that's also where there could\nbe an individual component so if you\nreally want to understand how to\napproach burnout it's like be scientific\nabout it be clinical about it like look\nat your situation which one of these\napplies to me and then even if you want\nto change jobs now at least you know\nwhat to look\nfor right so like oh like if your\nsituation is that you're isolated at\nwork can you tell me a little bit now in\nthe interview when they ask ask that\nquestion do you have any questions for\nus yeah what is your what is the work\nculture like what is the work Community\nlike do people hang out together do are\npeople friends like what's that like so\nnow you can start making directed\ndecisions about finding a work\nenvironment that's more conducive to\nyou right and you can even it can even\nbe questions like for people who are\nwilling to work extra hard and go the\nextra mile what kind of how does the\ncompany reward people who do\nthat and that's where they say you get a\nplaque if you work extra extra hard you\nget two plaques or is it like we have a\naggressive bonus in uh bonus structure\nbased on quality metrics and the people\nwho do a better job get paid more like\nwhat what's the answer that you get\nright so once you understand why you're\nburnt out instead of just like going and\nseeing a psychiatrist and getting an\nSSRI which could be an appropriate thing\nto do by the way because you could have\nmajor depressive disorder right so it's\nnot a bad idea to get clinically\nevaluated but be thoughtful about okay\nwhat's leading to the burnout and then\nyou can intervene on it is this a mi\ncomponent is there something I can work\non here or is there something that I\nneed to set boundaries with myself for\nnot taking work and learning how to say\nno or do I need to set boundaries with\nmy boss and saying hey you're asking too\nmuch of\nme and that's ultimately like what leads\nto the best results is is an\nunderstanding of both the individual\ncomponents and the work contributors\nbecause that's what happens with burnout\nit's a it's an intersectional problem so\nwe have to look at both pieces of the\npuzzle I think part of the reason that\npeople are struggling so much is because\neveryone is usually looking at only one\npiece of the puzzle and they're kind of\nignoring the other part and it's really\nan intersection of those two that's how\nyou make two puzzle pieces fit together\nright so hopefully that's helpful\nquestions I feel just like the left\nplant\nyeah I hear\nyou it's\ncalculated to\ndemonstrate to illustrate the\npoint so this is a good question can\nburnout last really long yes so here's\none thing that we to say about burnout\nso\nburnout implies a sense of permanence\nright so like this log is burnt out like\nyou can't get any more fire out of it is\nwhat it\nimplies so\nburnout can absolutely be repaired like\n100% like you can go from completely\nburnt out to not burnt out at all in\nloving life I've seen it happen time and\ntime and time again the thing is burnout\ncan also last for a while but the\nbiggest thing about the propagation of\nburnout is I don't want yall to think\nabout burnout like a binary thing which\nis even how our terminology is right\nit's like binary are you burnt out or\nare you not burnt out burnout is a is a\nis a condition that is propagated so\nit's sort of like you know\nsaying does thirst last forever and it's\nkind of like well like are you thirsty\nyes or no well that sort of depends on\nhow much water you drink and how much\nyou exercise right so in this the same\nway burnout is going to propagate unless\nyou address these factors and this is\nwhy it feels like it lasts so damn long\nis because people don't realize what is\nthe contributing factor to burnout they\ndon't they haven't figured out okay\nthese are the two or three things that\nreally burn me out so in my case dealing\nwith insurance company and this is what\nwe'll see is that it's not the hours\nthat you work it's the quality of the\nhour that you work that having to deal\nwith this crap for two hours a day is\nway worse than having to do work that\nyou enjoy for 10 hours a day and so\neveryone sort of focuses on the\nquantifiable aspects without sort of\nfocusing on the quantity I mean the\nquality so if you're burnt out for a\nlong time can it last for a while yes\nbut if it's lasting for a while you've\ngot to be careful because how much of\nthis is residual and how much of it is\nongoing because of your daily\ninfluences and generally speaking fixing\nit involves really fixing the daily\ninfluences then you kind of got to write\nout the residual burnout and then you\nshould be good can you be burned out\nfrom Life\nabsolutely so this is where I think the\ndefinition of burn out needs to expand a\nlittle bit but I think when you look at\nall these different factors right so can\nyou be cynical about life can you lack\nempathy can you have a low Lev level of\nenergy and lack fulfillment in life\nabsolutely can those things also relate\nto a sense of community fairness reward\ncontrol\nabsolutely right so I think the label\nfits on pretty well this is why in our\ncoaching program we don't just look at\nimprovements in like depression and\nanxiety which I recognize it's not a\nclinical program but you can still get\nimprovements right this is just the same\nway that I can go out exercising every\nday and I can get an improvement in my\ncholesterol even though exercise is not\na treatment for cholesterol like it's\nnot like a medical intervention for\ncholesterol right so in the same way\nwhat we try to emphasize at HG is like\nlife purpose figuring out who you are\nlearning to introspect how do you answer\nthose internal questions about yourself\nand as you answer those internal\nquestions about what you want in the\nworld then you can start intentionally\ncrafting it because right now what\nhappens is we live based on RNG it's\nlike loot boxes right and left we never\nuse the crafting menu in life we just go\ngrind and try to open up random ass\nLoot and we hope that one day we'll land\nin a situation that we\nenjoy so instead what you need to do is\nlike craft right it it requires more\nintention\nbut it's actually like easier from an\neffort standpoint just craft the life\nthat you want to but that starts with\nunderstanding okay what is it that I\nwant yeah that's how people live\nseriously it's like\nRNG I don't like this work let me just\nmove I've seen this in Esports too if\nyou look at like people just you know\nthey just shift around teams until they\nfind something that clicks because there\nisn't an intentional process process of\nlike diagnosis and understanding I mean\nthere is actually but I think it can be\nmuch more\nsophisticated\nright thoughts on burnout for people\nbeing fulfilled by their work and what\nresearch or other information are you\nbasing your model off of great question\nso let's talk about\num burnout for people being fulfilled so\nthis is common actually is that often\ntimes the people who are burnt out are\nthe ones who get fulfilled from their\nwork but then what happens is all these\nother factors start to interfere with\nthat crap right so I enjoy working with\npatients but it's the insurance stuff\nthat burns me out so even though you you\nlove the work in fact that's common\nright so at the very beginning I sort of\nsaid the weird thing about burnout the\nreason that so many people miss it is\nbecause they do enjoy their job but\nother factors get in the way that\nprevent you from enjoying it and the\nresearch that I'm drawing on is like\nvaried right but it starts with people\nlike freudenberg and um you know mlock\nis Central to this I think ler I don't\nknow how to pronounce the name you know\nthe spelling um you know their work is\nvery Central to this it's a lot of the\nwork that I've seen I mean different\npapers and stuff like that you can also\nlook at you know uh some of the\nvalidated instruments like the\nwell-being index um the mlock burnout\ninventory the oldenberg uh oldenberg is\nkind of dated\nso you can that's where a lot of the\nstuff is coming from in terms of when\npeople when people develop instruments\nthey look at okay what are the things\nthat we should ask about okay these are\nthe things that correlate with burnout"
