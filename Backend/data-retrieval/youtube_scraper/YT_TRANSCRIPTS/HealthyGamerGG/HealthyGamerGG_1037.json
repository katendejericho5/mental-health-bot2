    "transcript": "we don't really understand like what\nmatters right we have no experience of\nit so this is essentially in a weird way\nit's almost like dunning-kruger so this\nis kind of like i remember when i was 13\nyears old\nmy friends would talk about\nwhat the best like position is to have\nsex in\nand it's like a bunch of virgins just\nlike talking about this stuff and they\nwould like argue with each other right\nthey have no idea but we don't actually\nknow what fulfillment is\n[Music]\ni want to live a life that i want to\nlive\nbut i just don't see the purpose or\npoint to anything\nyeah i can help others and yeah it feels\ngood when i do i can try and maybe i\nactually help or maybe i don't maybe i\nfail maybe i succeed at the end of the\nday what does it all really matter\nanyway what does it matter whether i\nlive a happy life or a sad life what\ndoes it matter whether i write an\ninspirational best-selling book or i\njust play video games all day\nwe're all just specks of dust on a rock\nwhirling in space which is itself a\nspeck of dust in an unfathomably comp\nvast and complex universe we get to live\nfor this brief window of time what's the\npoint of anything other than just maybe\nmaximizing pleasure and minimizing gain\nbefore our time\ncomes and it's over just like it is for\nevery other mortal creature\nfrom the most revered among us to the\nlowly cockroach\nhow do people achieve a feeling that\ntheir life matters and feel a sense of\nfulfillment from what to do\ngreat question\nso often times\nwe're in a position\nwhere\nwe don't really understand like what\nmatters right we have no experience of\nit so we ask these questions like how do\ni achieve a life that matters how do i\nfind a sense of fulfillment\nbut we don't actually know what\nfulfillment is\nright because what is this person\nchasing and in the absence of actually\nunderstanding fulfillment what happens\nis their intellect comes up with all\nthese different things right it comes up\nwith like oh like i'm completely\ninsignificant\non a cosmic level which may be true\nand so what does it matter whether i do\nsomething or i don't do something\nbecause in the grand scheme of things\nwhat does it matter well that's that's a\nvery good question\nand so this is where i think we have to\nstart by sort of unpacking like what\ndoes fulfillment even mean\nbecause what i tend to find in these\nsorts of situations is that\nwhen i don't you know\nexistential let's call it nihilism\nwhen we're faced with existential\nnihilism here's kind of how it\nhow the the sequence of things runs okay\nso\nwe look at the world\nand we don't see meaning\nno meaning\nno fulfillment\nright we're kind of looking around we're\nlike\ni don't see the meaning here\nand so then what happens is since we\nsince it's not like apparent to us\nwe start to become nihilistic\nand then in the absence of meaning we've\ngot a void that we tend to fill up with\npleasure seeking\nand pain avoidance\nso in the absence of like fulfillment\nwhich is that dopaminergic like we're\nnot really sure\nbecause when people talk about\nfulfillment they're not talking about\nthings that are dopaminergic usually\nwhat they're usually talking about is\nlike something else that we don't really\nknow what it is\nand so what we end up doing is like we\ndon't see a clear road to it\nintellectually that is\nand so what we do see and what we have\nexperienced is like dopaminergic stuff\nso that's what we kind of do right we\nkind of fill it up that way\nso what's kind of going on and this sort\nof results in essentially hedonism right\nand so what this person is kind of\nsaying is like in my mind i cannot\nlogically\ndiscover\nfulfillment\ntherefore i'm going to default to\nhedonism\nokay so let's like start by sort of\nunderstanding if you want to find\nfulfillment\nhow do we go about doing that like from\na from a critical standpoint right so\nlet's start by understanding\nwhat is fulfillment\nright so if you want to find something\nlike if you want to like do something in\nlife you have to start by like\nunderstanding how to go about well first\nof all what it is\nand if you know what it is then you can\nstart to develop a plan to like find it\nright but the first thing to understand\nlike what is fulfillment like if i were\nto ask this person or i would ask you if\nyou're nihilistic and i ask you what is\nfulfillment\ni think what we're gonna get\nis a shrug of the shoulders\nand it's in the absence of understanding\nwhat fulfillment is\nthat we do this kind of thing\nokay\nso this is essentially in a weird way\nit's almost like dunning-kruger so when\nwe lack\nunderstanding\nwe fill it in\nwith theory\nright\nso i just want y'all to think about and\nour society is moving it moving in this\ndirection so our society is like moving\ntowards the direction of like proxies\ninstead of like true understanding so\nthis is why we use\ngrades\ninstead of\nknowledge\nwhen deciding like who to hire out of\ncollege right it's why we use stock\nprices\ninstead of fundamentals\nwhen evaluating the economy\nor companies\nand there are some people who do\nevaluate fundamentals right so berkshire\nhathaway for example warren buffett like\nevaluates fundamentals and that's part\nof the reason that probably is so\nsuccessful i'm not an expert in the\nstock market or anything so\ntake that with a grain of salt but the\nkey thing here is that our mind when we\ndon't really understand something\nwe'll just like fill it in with what\nlogically we're able to produce\nso this is kind of like i remember when\ni was 13 years old\nmy friends would talk about\nwhat the best like position is to have\nsex in\nand it's like a bunch of virgins just\nlike talking about this stuff and they\nwould like argue with each other right\nthey have no idea but they don't really\nstop and think a little bit about like\nthey don't think about that right\nit's kind of interesting because it's\nnot like\nignorance the ignorance of something\nprevents people from having an opinion\nin fact quite the opposite and this is\nwhere dunn kruger comes in so if i'm i'm\nplaying you know dota with with like\npeople who are 8 kmr and 2k mmr and no\none knows their mmr the 2k player will\nbe flaming the 8k player for not coming\nto fights that are stupid and irrelevant\nright so they're like we're gonna like\nwe don't recognize when we're ignorant\nof something we just fill it in with\nlike our random logic\nso then the kind of question becomes\nokay what are the tools at our disposal\nto understanding fulfillment\nso if we want to like if we want to\nstart this\nwhat how do we start so let's start by\nunderstanding that we have two\nfundamental tools\nfor understanding things we have\nexperience\nand we have intellect\nokay\nand generally speaking our society tends\nto emphasize intellect it tends to\nunderstand\nemphasize logic and there's it's value\nto this there's no question about there\nbeing value but when it comes to\nsomething like fulfillment if i were to\nlogically lay out an argument this is\nwhat fulfillment is\nit's not going to catalyze behavior it's\nnot going to catalyze understanding so\nthis is the other kind of interesting\nthing is that logic\ndoes not\nusually create behavioral change\nexperience creates behavioral change\nand so what i'm hearing from this person\nis like you know if their struggle is\nwhy don't i just play video games i date\nall day versus try to write a\nbestselling novel that's a behavioral\ndifference so the real problem with\nnihilism\nin my opinion\nis that like it doesn't dictate the\nright kind of behavior right what is the\nright kind of behavior we'll get to that\na second so let's start by understanding\nlike what is fulfillment so like let me\nask you all a question\nwhat do you think it's like to climb\nmount everest\nwhat do y'all think is the experience\nof climbing mount or not the experience\nwhat do you think it's like\ndo you think it's fulfilling\nright so i want you all to notice this\nfor a second\noh no\nwe got this or no okay\noh there we go\nhopefully it'll populate\nso i want you all to kind of notice this\nthat\nno one is saying\ni don't know\nright everyone is coming up with answers\nit's scary it's challenging\nit's cold\nso like notice what your mind does even\nin the absence of any kind of experience\nno one's like i don't know\neveryone's like it must be this way it\nmust be this way so your mind is already\nlike people are calling it exhilarating\nlike your mind is already like\ncoming up with answers\nfor things that you have no idea about\nright it's really fascinating\nso what is fulfillment\nso like let's\nthink a little bit so if we talk about\neverest for a moment\ni imagine that climbing mount everest is\nfulfilling\nso\nit's kind of weird so when i say i\nimagine that what i'm going to actually\ntalk about is climbing mount kilimanjaro\nwhich i have done\nso when i climb and you all are pretty\nright okay\num\nand so like it's all of those things\nright so it's cold because your\nintellect is not poor it's not it's a\ngood intellect you all are right it's\nhard\nsome people are saying it's exhilarating\nright so i would i would say that\nclimbing mount kilimanjaro was\nabsolutely a fulfilling experience for\nme\nit gave some sense to meaning of my life\nand what i learned from it was kind of\nbizarre\nso i got to the top of mount kilimanjaro\nand like my first thought upon being on\ntop of the world and the view is amazing\nbecause you're 20 000 feet up in the air\nand you can see like the african\nsavannah like all around you\nand so it's bizarre it's like it's so\nweird to be you know the view you get\nfrom an airplane\nit's like\nthat view but\nyou can look 360. it's not\nsecluded to a window\nand so it's amazing because you're 20\n000 feet up in the air\nand\nwhen you see that my first thought was\nlike\nall right let's go\nhow quickly can we get down this is\namazing and all but holy crap the first\nthing i want to do is get back down to\nthe ground\nand so it was like such a bizarre\nexperience and it sort of helped me\nunderstand and appreciate like yeah this\nwas really amazing but i never want to\ndo this again\nright\nand and so it's kind of bizarre but was\nthat experience fulfilling i'd say\nabsolutely was it all of these things as\nwell absolutely\nthis is what i want you all to\nunderstand is that the intellect can\nhypothesize these things\nbut\nthis is the tricky thing about the\nintellect is once you hypothesize an\nanswer the intellect will say you don't\nneed to bother because i have figured\nout what that experience is going to be\nlike\nthis is what's so dangerous about the\nintellect\ni don't need to bother i already know\nthat\nand so the tricky thing about the\nintellect is that the intellect\nactually\ncan keep your behaviors the same so it's\ngonna say things like keep playing video\ngames\nright\nlike think about this for a second what\ndo you think is the result\nwhat is this an argument for\nlet's assume for a minute that there's a\nthere's a covert argument\nin this\nand this is the justification that we\nuse for playing video games all day\nright so i think that this person is\nlike actually asking a really good\nquestion they're curious they're\ngenuinely wanting to grow but there's\nlike a subtle sneaky sneaky sneaky thing\nhere going on which is this is basically\nsaying don't bother doing anything let\nme just get my dopaminergic hit\nokay\nso let's try to understand a little bit\nabout what fulfillment truly is\nnow we're going to step to science for a\nsecond\nokay so the first thing you've got to do\nis figure out what is fulfillment if you\nwant to understand how to build a\nfulfilling life you have to start by\nfiguring out what is fulfillment\nso now we're going to talk a little bit\nabout video game addiction\nand the nature of fulfillment\nso\nthe reason that video games are\naddictive is not because they provide\naward a reward the reason video games\nare addictive this is no\noversimplification but there's good good\ndata behind this is actually because of\nthe denial of the reward\nso this is really really important right\nso like everyone's playing elden ring\nnow\ni'm still stuck on the first boss\nwhich is alarmingly hard i thought i was\nget good but i just haven't been able to\nget good right so what makes it so\nfulfilling like how does it feel to\nbeat that boss i don't know right\nbecause i haven't done it yet\nso it's the denial of the reward\nfollowed by the reward that actually\ncreates the sense of fulfillment in a\nvideo game this is really really\nimportant to understand\nand this is why games are so freaking\naddictive\nbecause they're gonna deny you the\nreward\nfor a time but you know that eventually\nyou're gonna get it it's the only place\nwhere the denial of reward has the\nguarantee of the reward after some\namount of time that's why they're so\naddictive\nbecause what happens in wow right when\nthere's like end game content like what\nhappens three six months after the\ncontent gets released and all the\nhardcore raid guilds do it they nerf the\ncontent\nso you've wiped on this boss 15 times\nbut don't worry the game devs have your\nback\nyou're gonna you're gonna beat that boss\neventually\nright whereas like dark souls doesn't do\nthat so some people quit because there's\nno guarantee of the reward in dark souls\nand so game developers will even use\nthis mechanic i don't think they really\nuse it nefariously personally i think\nthey're just like okay like we'll let\nthe hardcore people do it and we want to\nhave everyone have this experience i\ndon't think that they're evil or\ndiabolical about it but there's good\ndata that shows that denial of reward\nis what makes game games addictive and\nif we think about adverse experiences or\nfulfilling experiences right we just\ntalked about climbing mount kilimanjaro\nlike a huge part of the fulfillment of\nclimbing mountain mount kilimanjaro was\nhow hard it is\nso this is where adversity\ninto success\nis a huge component of fulfillment\nright so we talked a little bit about\nrussia like overcoming video game\naddiction like\nwhat like you know writing a\nbest-selling novel is not about ego i\nmean if it's about ego that's totally\nfine but generally speaking i think when\nyou write a really good novel or you\ncreate a good piece of work\nof work\num or like even as a as a doctor when i\nsee a patient i do right by that patient\nthat feels fulfilling like i feel really\namazed with myself and i feel really\ngood about myself after i work a call\nshift that's 30 hours because it's hard\nand i did a good job and i'm proud of\nwhat i accomplished but it's actually\nlike the difficulty that leads to some\nof the the advantage\nso i remember many months ago\ni went hiking\nand i found like a bush of wild berries\nand like the berries were not nearly as\ngood as what you get in the supermarket\nbut damn were they so like\nsatisfying\ni enjoyed them so much more than the\nobjectively sweeter and tastier berry\nthat you find from the supermarket so if\nwe look at sort of the science of\nfulfillment\nwhat we tend to find is that adversity\ninto success is a huge part of it right\nwhat are people proud of they're proud\nof things that they had to overcome we\nsee video games take advantage of this\nand this is also where if we look at\nsubstance use\nwe can see an element of this principle\nhere as well\nso what makes a substance so satisfying\nit's actually the craving\nit's the denial of the thing\nso when i crave something right so i've\nworked with people who are like addicted\nto heroin\nand the worse their cravings get\nlike they like like it becomes so\ndifficult and then when you finally use\nit feels so relieving\nand people who use like over and over\nand over again like they actually don't\nenjoy it as much as like if they've had\ncravings and then they use\nso when i talk to people who who relapse\nwhat they consistently tell me is it's\nlike the first one or two uses\nwhen they relapse that are the best and\nafter that they don't even enjoy it\nafter that it feels awful it's kind of\nlike playing a video game where like at\nthe very beginning a video game is\nactually really really fun and it's when\nyou sort of like get into it over and\nover and over and over and over again\nthat your dopamine circuitry kind of\nadapts and then it's no longer fun\nright\nso this is why i like i'm just to be\nclear i'm not advocating for usage of\nany of this kind of stuff i'm just using\nit to illustrate this point\nthat adversity into success that denial\nof the reward followed by the reward\ncan be incredibly satisfying now is that\nthe nature of fulfillment i'm not sure\nokay\nso the question becomes like okay how do\ni find fulfillment\nso this is this is the question you\nshould ask\nand be careful because you can't you can\nask this question intellectually you can\nanswer it intellectually you can read a\nthousand books about finding fulfillment\nand will you have found fulfillment\nabsolutely not\nright like you can watch as much\npornography as you want to but no amount\nof watching pornography is ever a\nsubstitute for getting laid\nand so this is what's happening in the\nworld as we sort of get as we move\ntowards higher and higher\nintellectualization in the absence of\nexperience we start to form like\nopinions about stuff and then we think\nwe're right then we join echo chamber i\nmean echo chambers right and then when\nthere are a thousand other people who\nare saying the same thing that we're\nsaying when none of us have ever left\nthe room\nthen like we think we're more right\nbecause now we're getting congruent from\nthe world\nbecause like everyone else believes what\ni believe so there's like no point in\nexploration because it's all been\nfigured out the world is nihilistic\nthere's no point in doing anything just\nembrace hedonism\ndisagree completely if you want to\nunderstand how to find fulfillment you\nhave to first figure out what is the\nnature of fulfillment and now we're\ngoing to talk a little bit about sort of\nthe yogic path\nnow the yogic path is about awareness\nand simply what we want to do\nis look at ourselves through a series of\nexperiences\nokay\nand just see like okay what is more\nfulfilling and what is less fulfilling\nso for example like eat\nwhile watching\nand eat\nbites\nby yourself like without doing any any\ndistracting no technology\njust eat the food\nwhich one is more fulfilling\nwhich one is more dopaminergic\nwhich one do you gravitate towards why\ndo you gravitate towards it\nin which one does the food taste better\nright oh so you got y'all making a\nmistake once again\nno no no no no no\neveryone's giving answers\nthis is intellect jumping in with\nanswers don't do it you can't answer\nthis right now this is the point you'll\nneed to understand this very very\ncarefully\nright you notice how quickly your mind\ndoes this like this is the key thing do\ny'all see this your mind is like i\nalready know the answer so now what\nyou've done\nis you remove the necessity of actually\nengaging in the exercise because you\nalready have the answer oh i know\noh i\nknow if you want to understand why you\ncan't find fulfillment\nit is these three words\noh i know\ni already know\nno need to explore\ni've read about it i've done it before\ndo it with awareness\nsit down and actually do it\nokay\nand here's what what we're going to do\nso it's all about awareness so this is\nwhat i'd recommend if you want to\nunderstand the nature of fulfillment so\nyou need to ask yourself like do i feel\nfulfilled\nbut we're going to give you a couple of\nexercises first seek new things\nwhy is this\nthis is because you already have answers\nfor the existing stuff that you can do\nso you can revisit like eating but i\nwould seek something new\nso i would like if you haven't climbed a\nmountain before or even you know like i\nwould go climb a mountain\nlike if you've never been snorkeling\nbefore go snorkel\nokay\nsecond thing\nis embrace difficulty\nnow this is the opposite of the\nhedonistic path\nremember the reason we're doing this is\nnot just to make our life hard\nit's to try to understand the nature of\nfulfillment\nand so if you do something easy versus\nhard ask yourself which one is more\nfulfilling\nwhich one is more fulfilling going for a\nwalk that is 50 steps\nor going for a walk that is\n5 000\nsteps\nwhich one is more fulfilling\ntry it\nand this is the key thing this is why we\nget stuck because when we operate from\nhedonism we move away from difficulty\nand then when we move away from hardship\nwe narrow the range of behaviors we can\nengage in\nso up here is hike\ncook\ncamp\ngames\nand down here\nis youtube\ngames twitch\nwe narrow the scope of our life\nand do we feel full there's a thousand\npeople millions of people out there that\njust do this all day\nare they fulfilled\nare the people that do this are they\nfulfilled\nonce again you're going to want to\nanswer\nright which is okay you have some\nexperience but just be careful do an\nhonest investigation\nand so i'm going to leave you all with\none last exercise so this is do these\ntwo things so just find something new\nright\nand do it\ndo it with awareness\nthis is key\nso awareness is more than just like the\nexperience of emotion so if you go do\nsomething you may be anxious\nand therefore you don't enjoy it we're\nnot talking about enjoyment we're\ntalking about fulfillment\nenjoyment and fulfillment are two\ndifferent things that's why we have two\ndifferent words for them\nand if you go down the hedonistic\nnihilistic route then you're going to\nshoot for enjoyment all the time and\nyou'll find an absence of fulfillment\nand i've seen this like many many many\ntimes\nthe classic story about this situation\nis actually the story of gotham buddha\nwho had all of the enjoyments of the\nworld and he woke up unfulfilled\nand i've seen this a lot with people who\nare you know financially\noff\nand what they find is that like their\nlife is not they have luxury and they\nhave security which are absolutely\nimportant contributors to happiness\nthere's been research on this\nright because it's hard to seek\nfulfillment when you are worried about\nputting food on the table\nand having a roof over your head so you\nshould absolutely do those things first\nright we're not saying that those aren't\nimportant\nbut it's just it doesn't stop there\nand this is where in the yogic tradition\nthere are four major goals of life\ndharma\nand moksha\nduty\nwealth\npleasure\nenlightenment\nso this is the cool thing i i like this\nphilosophy for this reason they're not\nsaying don't enjoy things they're not\nsaying don't get financial security\nright what they're saying is that you\nshould do your duty first and then by\nall means you should get you should\nenjoy some amount of wealth right so get\nyour financial security enjoy what life\nhas to offer don't live like an ascetic\nif you want to eat a slice of deep dish\npizza like eat a slice of deep dish\npizza\nand you know for people who are curious\nthis is the gam sutra\nthis is even a religious text\nabout like maximizing your pleasure\nwhich is like a part of the path\nand then at the end pursue enlightenment\nso like take what life has to offer\ndon't deprive yourself of it but don't\nstop here this is the problem with\nhedonism is hedonism is like just this\none\nright then there are the trihards who\nare just this one\nbut the truth is that i\nand once again this is from one\nparticular tradition you guys don't have\nto accept this i i personally i like it\nbecause it sort of says like yeah you\nshould be spiritual you should do your\nduty you should be a good person but\nlike you should enjoy life too like life\nis there to be enjoyed\nand so if we're talking about finding\nfulfillment look for it with awareness\nand so i'm gonna give y'all just one\nlast option to get you started because\nawareness has to be cultivated\nit's not just like experiencing an\nemotion it's being fully aware of what\nyou what you experience so what i'm\ngonna ask you all to do is go for a jog\nokay so like health stuff aside so if\nyou have any contraindications to this\nmedically and things like that don't do\nthis but i'd say go for a jog for 15\nminutes\nmake sure you hydrate a little bit ahead\nof time\nand then the first thing that you're\ngoing to want to do\nis drink water when you get back\nright\nwhat i want you to do\ngrab a glass of water go sit outside\nand wait five to ten minutes\nand then see how fulfilling that glass\nof water is\nwait\nwith it just watch yourself\njust watch yourself\nnotice what happens like you're going to\nget these biological impulses you're\ngoing to feel thirsty you want the water\nyou want the water you want the water\nand just you know obviously if you're\nlike dehydrated it's very hot outside\ndon't do anything that's like dangerous\nlike then drink the water\nbut just\nwatch\nthe other thing that you can do\nis\nmeditate\nin a hardcore way\nwhat does this mean\nso i'm going to teach you all the first\nstep to hardcore meditation\nokay\nso the first step to hardcore meditation\nis to sit somewhere and not meditate\nso find\nfind a place to sit that's relatively\ncomfortable\nand don't do anything\ndon't engage in like\nthinking\nlike don't like start thinking about\nsomething don't create stories in your\nhead don't think about what you're going\nto be doing later don't let yourself do\nanything\nyou want to try to meditate you kind of\ncan but just sit somewhere for 10\nminutes\nand watch what happens\nto you\nobserve all of the impulses\nthat happen\nright\nso\nthere's a great exercise which is\nwatch stare\nat a wall\nso some people have done this even up to\nan hour\nand it's going to be so incredibly\ndifficult because what's going to happen\nwhat's going to happen is like your\ndopaminergic brain is going to be like i\nneed something i need something i need\nsomething\ngive me give me give me give me give me\ngive me\ngive me give me give me give me\nbored yes do you know what is the most\nfrightening thing in the world to most\npeople is boredom\nwhat is there to be afraid of in boredom\nit's 10 minutes\nwhat are you going to do in that 10\nminutes otherwise browse reddit\nlook at a meme\nwhat do you have to lose\nand see how quickly your mind rebels\nthis will teach you awareness\nonce you have awareness engage in\nactivities\nand ask yourself what is the nature of\nfulfillment\nbecause how the hell are you going to\nfind fulfillment if you don't understand\nwhat it is in the first place\nand this is why everyone's stuck because\neveryone's like\noh like how do i find fulfillment like\nwhat's the point in anything like why\nshould i do anything it's like you don't\neven understand what you're looking for\nall you're doing is substituting\nwhatever logic or intellect\nyou have for any kind of understand\nunderstanding of experience\nand then half the time\nwhen your logical mind is telling you to\ndo things it's actually hijacked by a\nsubconscious like dopamine eviction\nso all it's trying to do is like ah\nthere's no point in anything guess i'm\ngonna play more games today\nbecause that's life\nguess i'm gonna play games\nright now i'm going to do it guilt-free\nbecause what's the point\nwhat's the point of anything\nwhy bother man\nlook\nlook at this look at how scientifically\nvalid this is we're all just specks of\ndust on a rock whirling in space which\nitself is a speck of duck in an\nunfathomably vast and complex universe\nwhat does it matter if i\nstart working on my term paper today\nin the grand scheme of things it's all\nirrelevant\nso when it's irrelevant what do you\nactually end up doing\nyeah\nlet me watch watch something on youtube\nfor a little bit\nyeah just today\nbecause in\nin the complete absence of meaning that\nyour mind creates\nyour addictions run rampant\nright it protects you no guilt bro\nforget about the guilt don't beat\nyourself up for procrastinating it\ndoesn't matter you can keep doing it\nthere's it doesn't matter man a thousand\nyears from now 10 000 years from now\nwhat difference does it make whether you\nstart your term paper today or tomorrow\nhow is it going to impact the grand\nscheme of humanity\nso be careful about where your thoughts\nlead you\nbe careful if you find yourself it's a\ngood question to ask like where does\nfulfillment come from why shouldn't i\njust be hedonistic\nand this is where i'd say like sure i\ncould give you all sorts of answers like\noh like you have such a powerful impact\non the world man\nlike try to be a good human being\nforget about all that let's let's be a\nlittle bit yogic about it let's follow\nthe the path of the yogis and ask\nyourself first what is fulfillment\ndefine it like what the hell is it\nthen we can figure out how to like\nfind it we have to know what we're\nlooking for first\nhow do we do that be careful about your\nintellect which is going to want to give\nyou answers\nin as substitutes for taking actions\nvery tricky\nso seek new experiences\nembrace adversity so ideal that those\nexperiences are not like super easy\nand then do it do so with awareness\nand if you start doing these things you\nwill understand the nature of\nfulfillment\ni also had one other exercise which i'll\nleave you with which is to find a moment\nof pure happiness\nand understand what are the components\nthat are requisite for pure happiness\nand the only way you can do that is to\nstudy happiness in all of its different\nshades\nand the answer that i discovered was\nmind-blowing\nabout the true nature of happiness but\nyou can't\ni could tell it to you but then you\nwon't explore\nyour mind will come up with answers\nright now it's saying oh it's this it's\nthis this is it's this\nbut remember this is like it's like\ntasting a strawberry like you can talk\nabout it you can learn about\nneuroscience you can you know\nwatch other people eat it all you want\nto but you're never going to taste it\nyourself until you actually like take a\nbite of the strawberry\nso try to find for yourself this is hard\nfind a moment to pure happiness and\nunderstand what are the prerequisites\nfor it\nyeah you want to know it now right so\nlet's think about this if you're saying\ni want to know it now\nwhat happens if you learn it now\nwhat does your mind get to avoid\nif you understand the answer if i tell\nyou the answer what do you get to do\nright you don't have to bother because\nthe thing is it's hard\nso the harder it is the more you want to\nlike you know get a helicopter ride to\nthe top of the mountain\nlike you don't need a helicopter ride if\nyou're climbing to the second floor of\nyour house you need a helicopter ride if\nyou're going to the top of everest right\nso be careful about what your mind wants\nthe harder it is the more your mind is\nlike\ni don't want to\nwhy can't we just play games\nsit in front of a wall and stare at it\noh\ni don't want to\njust tell me what i'm going to learn\nanyway so that i can be intellectually\nsatisfied and i don't have to change\nanything about my life if you want life\nto be good\ni don't know how else what other word to\nuse\ngenerally speaking hopefully it'll be\neasier doesn't mean that it's free of\npain\nright\njust understand yourself man\nor woman or anything in between just\nunderstand yourself and how the hell you\nwork\njust understand that and like life\nbecomes so much more manageable\nnot saying that it's all because\nremember like if fulfillment and\nenjoyment are two different things that\nmeans that you can live a fulfilling\nlife that is absent of enjoyment\nthat's true too that's what viktor\nfrankl figured out\nit's like oh being a holocaust in a\nconcentration camp sucks and yet i can\nfind fulfillment and meaning so the two\nare actually like somewhat independent\nright when you talk about the science of\nit there's more relations there right so\nwe know that security and a certain\namount of financial stuff we know that\nfor example commutes over 45 minutes for\nmarried couples lead to sharp increases\nin divorce rates\nright so they're like all kinds of\ninteresting factors that we know from\nscience which you should absolutely\ntake advantage of\nbut don't use logic and intellect as a\nsubstitute for experience\nand be careful about how your mind tries\nto like dodge all kinds of stuff that is\ngood for you because that's why you're\nstuck\nright because you're like listening to\nyour mind\nyou"
