    "transcript": "kudos this seems like a very rigid set\nof rules\nyeah so it's rigid with y'all the cool\nthing is that when you do it properly is\nit going to feel rigid to other people\nyes which is what we want to do\nand you're not going to come across as\ncrazy you're going to come across as\nunderstanding compassionate and firm\nit is rigid that's what people they\ndon't we don't want to be\ndoormats right like there's going to be\nsome rigidity because at some point\nyou're saying no and you're putting up a\nwall between their actions and what\nyou're allowing that requires rigidity\nthe question is how can we optimize that\nprocess for compliance on their part as\nwell as maintaining the relationship\nso let's talk about setting boundaries\nso the tricky thing is that everyone\nsort of says hey like it's really\nimportant to set good boundaries men so\ni remember when i was in residency uh\nthe residency program director at the\ntime i i was kind of asking her you know\nwhat's one of the most useful things\nthat you've learned that you wish you\nknew earlier and she was like the most\nuseful skill i ever learned was learning\nhow to say no\nand so you know you hear things like\nthis right that learning to say no is is\nimportant it's important to like set\nhealthy boundaries like set healthy\nboundaries around technology and set\nhealthy boundaries with your parents and\nset healthy boundaries with your friends\nand set healthy boundaries with your\nsignificant other just like healthy\nboundaries man\nor woman\nbut like no one ever teaches you like\nhow do you set a boundary like how does\nthat actually happen so today what we're\ngoing to talk about is like share with\nyou all five important steps to setting\na healthy boundary the first is actually\narticulating the boundary the second is\nhow to implement the boundary the third\nis common pitfalls and this is something\nthat i think is like grossly\nundereducated because setting a boundary\nis not easy right like actually\nmaintaining it is not just about the\nother person it is oftentimes about you\nso yeah i i promise i will you know i'm\ngonna break up with this person and i'm\nnever gonna see them again i'm gonna go\nno contact with them\nand let me text them two weeks from now\nwhen i'm feeling lonely on a friday\nnight\nright so what are some of the pitfalls\nto setting boundaries\nand then like some in the moment tips it\nwith enforcing boundaries so we can sort\nof say okay here's how you articulate a\nboundary here are the steps to implement\nit here are some things that you watch\nout for but in the moment when push\ncomes to shove and you have to set a\nboundary with someone\nit can be very very hard right because\nyou're afraid of particular things so\nhow what is the right way to in the\nmoment like\nlay out a boundary with someone enforce\na boundary\nand the last thing that i think once\nagain is not talked about is after you\nlay a boundary with someone after you\nenforce a boundary what do you do then\nright so like a big risk around boundary\nsetting is that if you have friends or\nparents or or you know significant\nothers and you set a boundary with them\nthere's oftentimes like consequences to\nsetting that boundary right so how do\nyou manage those consequences because\nit's the fear of those consequences that\noftentimes keeps us from setting the\nboundary in the first place or enforcing\nthe boundary i don't like it when my\nfriends make fun of me but\nif i say something to them they're just\ngonna make fun of me more\nor if i say something to them they're\ngonna think that i'm not fun to hang\naround with and i may not get invited\nnext time right so like when you set\nboundaries with people sometimes there\nare consequences\nand so one of the things that i found is\nlike a really really under taught skill\nis not just how to set a boundary but\nafter you set a boundary how do you\ninteract with the person to try to\nsmooth things over and maintain a\nhealthy relationship or hopefully repair\nwhatever small rupture you have okay so\nlet's dive in\nso\nstep number one\nso at the end of this hopefully what you\nwill be able to do\nis set a boundary like articulate a\nboundary implement a boundary\ntroubleshoot some of the pitfalls\nget some like kind of coaching on in the\nmoment what you should say or do when\nlike push comes to shove and you really\nwant to you know waver on your boundary\nand then the last thing that i think is\nreally important is like at the end of\nthis hopefully you'll have an idea of\nokay after i set a boundary and i feel\nguilty\nand like i'm afraid that people don't\nlike me how do i interact with that\nperson afterward to kind of patch things\nup and make sure that things are okay\nokay\nso step number one\nof boundary setting\nis\narticulating your boundary\nso this is where we basically figure out\nokay what specifically is our boundary\nand this is a\na thing that i think is like you know\nyou got to be careful about because if\nyou want someone to\nadhere or respect a particular boundary\nit has to be like clearly laid out and\nthe first problem that people run into\nis that they don't often times like\nclearly articulate what the boundary is\nand so if i sort of say like i want you\nto stop treating me this way\nit's like how does that person know what\nthis way is right so like you're kind of\nsetting them up to fail i don't like it\nwhen you talk to me like this so i'm not\nsaying that those feelings aren't valid\nand they're absolutely there for a\nreason but if we're thinking about a\nrelationship you need to be able to\narticulate it so that the other person\nunderstands what you mean\nokay so we're going to start by\narticulating boundaries\nsecond thing that we're going to do is\nhow to implement\nboundaries\nthird thing we're gonna do is pitfalls\nso what are some of the traps or things\nthat you have to watch out for when it\ncomes to boundary setting\nnumber four\nis in the moment tips\nright\nwhen when you are setting a boundary\nwith your friend and they aggro and the\nboss music starts to play\nwhat do you do in that moment right\nhow do you how do you manage the aggro\nof your friend\nand then last thing is after the\nencounter is over\nhow do you repair the relationship so\naftermath\nboundary setting\nokay\nso let's start with number one\narticulating a boundary\nso the first thing that i'd say is if\nyou're trying to set boundaries with\npeople\nokay there are a couple of key tips to\nunderstand the first is the earlier in\nthe relationship\nthe easier it is\nokay this is first thing to understand\nnumber two\nit's easier to loosen a boundary\nthan it is to tighten it\nso this is part of the problem with like\nso people who are dealing with let's say\nentitled parents narcissistic parents\nentitled family members if you haven't\nset a boundary with them any kind of\ntightening that you do on the boundary\nis going to be met with a ton of\nresistance right whereas like if you're\nstarting a relationship with someone you\ncan sort of lay out what your boundaries\nare early on but if there's an\nexpectation of behavior already in place\nrunning contrary to that expectation is\ngoing to encounter more resistance okay\nso what we want to do\nfirst of all is make the boundary very\nclear\nso this should be like actions that you\narticulate so i'll kind of give you all\nan example so let's say that you're\ntalking to your parents and your parents\nhave forbidden you to date because you\nare an asian or south asian person or\nmany other cultures i suppose\nso no dating in middle school certainly\nnot that's absurd no dating in high\nschool no that's not something that our\npeople do and in in college you should\nbe focusing on studies\nand then like something happens where\nlike your 25th birthday rolls around and\nthen depending on your gender you may\nget a little bit of leeway one way or\nthe other 25th birthday rolls around\n26th birthday rolls around now it's like\nokay like now it's time to get married\nlike why aren't you and then 27th\nbirthday rolls around why aren't you\nmarried yet 28th birthday rolls around\nit's like what's wrong with you everyone\nelse is getting married it would it\nwould calm me down so much if you could\njust get married like don't you\nunderstand how much i worry about you\nand what's gonna happen about your\nfuture and now it's time beta now it's\ntime now it's time beta it's time it's\ntime it's time oh my goodness it's time\nso when you're sort of dealing with this\nthe first thing that you have to do is\nclearly articulate what the boundary is\nso like you have to figure out okay\nbecause remember this is a behavior that\nyou want someone else to do so the\nboundaries should be behavioral in\nnature\nit can't be like some kind of emotion\nthat you they you want them to prevent\nlike you don't want them to evoke an\nemotion like that's not a boundary you\ncan set you can't they can't control how\nthey make you feel they can only control\nwhat they say\nso you want your your boundary to be\nlike very very clear and very behavioral\nin nature so for example for this person\nwhat i would recommend is when we talk\non the phone\ndon't\nask\nabout\npersonal\nor romantic\nrelationships\nright so like it doesn't mean it just\nthis is the thing like when we talk on\nthe phone\nright so i'm i'm assuming a couple\nthings that you know you don't live with\nyour parents or either not physically\nthere with you or things like that and\nyou can kind of say like hey like every\ntime we talk on the phone like you keep\non hammering me with the same stuff\nright you're always asking me when i'm\ngoing to get married i'll tell you when\ni have information going forward i would\nappreciate it if you did not ask me\nabout this\nokay\nthis is where you kind of want to like\nbe very very clear about an ask now for\npeople who have like very very pushy\nparents or very loose boundaries or\nthings like that the other thing is\nremember that it's easier to loosen than\nit is to tighten so if we are\nimplementing boundaries for people like\nremember this is that an overtime\nprocess\nso what you want to do it's longitudinal\nin nature\nso what you want to do is like you can't\nfix everything all at once\nand it's hard to ask people to make\ndrastic adjustments overnight so what\nwe're going to do is start by\nimplementing a tiny tiny boundary right\nso this is where we are this is where we\nwant to go we're not going to go like\nfrom here to here in one step we're\ngoing to go right here which they can\nmanage\nand then we're going to go here and then\nwe're going to go here and then we may\ntake a bigger step\nright but generally speaking we want to\ntighten our boundaries very very\ngradually much like the way that i\ntighten my belt over my dad gut right\nso what we want to do is like be very\nvery clear with a behavioral instruction\nokay\nsecond thing that we want to do is\nprovide a very simple reason\nthis is important\nwe do not want to provide complex\nreasons we do not want to provide\nlike\nintense reasons we do not want to\nprovide justifications\nlogic\nwe do not want to provide scientific\nfact we do not want to talk to them\nabout how they make us feel when they do\nthat we want to provide a very very\nsimple reason ideally one sentence\nof a reason so here's why when you\nprovide complex reasons i don't want to\ngo out with you because\ni'm not looking for a relationship\nokay that's option number one versus i\ndon't date gamers\ni'm not looking for a relationship\ni'm celibate right now\ni have problems with my health the more\nreasons you provide\nthe more justifications you provide\nthe more\nargument you will invite so this is\nsomething that people like this is a\nvery important thing to understand when\nyou lay a boundary with someone it's not\na discussion\nthe more ammo and this is what one of\nthe key drivers okay\nso when we lay out a boundary with\nsomeone we want them to understand\nbecause if they understand they won't\npush us the more they understand about\nme the more they understand about me the\nmore they understand about me the easier\nit will be the less friction there will\nbe the more they will see my perspective\nand the more they will respect me and\nthen there won't be conflict so we tend\nto do is provide reasons\nto try to buy ourselves\npeace\nbut in fact what it does is the exact\nopposite\nthe more reasons we provide the more\nargument we we the more logic with more\nreasons and more stuff we sort of say to\nthem it invites discussion\nright so what we want to do is ideally a\nvery simple reason\nand like it can be like super simple\nright so it's something that you want to\nkeep like not\nyou don't want to justify in a way that\nsort of like\ninvites argument or\nthings like that if they really want to\nask maybe you can answer a little bit\nmore but generally speaking you can say\nhey when we talk on the phone i'd\nappreciate it like i i don't i don't\nfind it helpful in fact it like makes it\nreally hard for me to even think about\nthis stuff and it makes me\nnot want to engage with you when you ask\nme about my romantic relationships going\nforward when we talk on the phone i'd\nappreciate it if you\ndidn't ask me about that\nokay so you want to make it just very\nvery clear\nand that's where you listen to them\nwe'll kind of getting ahead of ourselves\nhere but generally speaking what we want\nto do when we articulate a boundary is\nmake a clear behavioral thing\nuh like a clear behavioral thing an\naction that they can follow right as\nwell as like sort of circumstances in\nwhich the boundary is like taking place\nso we want to think about\nwhen\nwhere\nand what\nin terms of our our boundary setting\nright when are we gonna enforce this no\nplaying video games after 10 p.m on\nweekdays\nand it's not oh i'm so worried about\nyour future i'm so worried you're gonna\ndo this and oh so-and-so's son is doing\nthis and all you ever do is play video\ngames don't you understand i love you so\nmuch oh my god like i'm so worried about\nwhat's gonna happen you don't understand\ncause you're so young none of that crap\nif you're a parent we unfortunately i\nhate to break this to y'all twitch but\nwe teach this to your parents too and it\nworks wonders you lay a boundary with\npeople\nit's like clearly articulated so no\ngames after 10 pm period\nwhy because it's important that you\nfocus on your school but i do focus on\nmy school cool this is where with\nparents and stuff will sort of say like\nyou know you need to maintain a\nparticular gpa\nthen we can talk about games on weekdays\nafter 10 pm\nokay\nso very very simple you're right it's\ndifficult jake we're going to help you\nthrough that that's where some of the\npitfalls come in so you want to provide\na very simple reason you want to make it\nnice and clear okay\nnow\nthis is how you define or articulate\nyour boundary\nnow we're going to move on to\nimplementing a boundary\nokay some of the stuff we're going to\ntalk about today is absolutely op\ncritical mistakes that people make and\nhow to avoid them okay\nfirst thing is that you\nlay the boundary\nwithout\nenforcing it\nat the same time\nthis is important this is where a lot of\npeople make the simplest mistake of\nboundaries if i'm limiting my child's\ngaming i am not going to tell them at 10\npm for the first time that i'm limiting\ntheir gaming after 10.\ni'm gonna tell them at 2 pm on a tuesday\nor 2 p.m on a saturday hey come this\nthis monday starting this monday\nafter 10 pm no more games\nso you don't want to tell lay the\nboundary\nyou don't want to like explain to\nsomeone what the boundary is when you\nare emotional\nright\nand like when it's an active issue\nbecause what's going to happen is they\nare going to dismiss your concern\nbecause you're going to be like they're\ngoing to be pissed\nright they're going to dismiss your\nconcern because like you're active like\nthen and there people don't like\nboundaries they don't like laying out a\nboundary while it's being enforced so\nthe way that i i want you to think about\nit is like you know getting arrested for\nsomething that you know\nis breaking the law is very different\nfrom\ngetting punished for something that you\nwere not aware of so someone walks up to\nyou and like that's against the rules\ni'm gonna take your backpack away you're\nlike wait what like\ni didn't know that was against the rules\nno one ever explained that to me like i\nwas not aware of this\nso in that same way we want to give\npeople a chance ahead of time to\nunderstand what the boundary is because\nthe other important thing\nis that if your parents are asking you\nfor example about your romantic life\nthey want to know in that moment so it\nis going to feel really really punitive\nand it's going to cost them something\nadditional if you lay a boundary and\nenforce it so we want to separate those\ntwo things out we want people to have a\nlot of advanced notice\nabout the boundary before we enforce it\nthat way when we enforce it\nit's kind of tricky i don't know if this\nsort of makes sense but if you lay a\nboundary and enforce it at the same time\nyou're going to get a lot more pushback\nbecause they want to know in that moment\nwhat's going on in your romantic life\nright that curiosity or that desire that\nanxiety is there it's going to be hard\nfor them to respect it but when y'all\nare like let's say you're going out with\nyour parents for grocery shopping at\nnoon on a saturday and y'all are going\nout grocery shopping you're saying hey\nlike while you're in the car you kind of\nsay hey like there's something i wanted\nto let you all know\ni know that you guys are concerned we'll\ntalk about this as well about my\nromantic situation and things like that\ni appreciate your concern i just want to\nlet you all know that whenever we talk\nwhenever you ask me on the phone it\nreally makes me\nlike\nvery upset and not want to talk to you\nso going forward i'm not going to really\nparticipate in any conversations about\nmy romantic life on the phone\nso you want to give them advance notice\nthis is key\nokay\nthat's going to make it easier for them\nto digest remember\nlaying the boundary and enforcing the\nboundary is going from here to here at\nthe same time\nthis is the conversation two days before\nright and then enforcement is gonna be\nthis don't worry we'll get here we're\njust gonna do it slow\nokay\nso step number one tip number one\nlay the boundary and enforce the\nboundaries separately give them advance\nnotice\nokay\ntip number two for implementing a\nboundary acknowledge\ntheir perspective\nonce again we're having this\nconversation ahead of time right so\nthey're not you're not pissed off in\nthis moment but you want to acknowledge\ntheir perspective they will be much more\nlikely to adhere to your boundaries if\nyou acknowledge their perspective that\ndoes not mean that you necessarily agree\nwith it or that you have to cede to it\nbut you want to demonstrate to them you\nknow like because when you lay a\nboundary with someone you want to\ndemonstrate to them that you understand\nso when you lay a boundary with someone\nhere's me\nhere's the boundary\nhere's the person i have a relationship\nwith\none of the most common counter arguments\nis they don't\nunderstand oh beta you don't understand\nyou are getting old now\nyou don't understand it's going to be\nhard things have to be done in their own\ntime\nright like oh you don't understand so\nwhat you want to do is you want to sort\nof deflate that by expressing your\nunderstanding ahead of time and since\nit's not an argument since they have\nnothing to lose they're not going to\nlike argue with you there right so what\nyou want to do is ahead of time\nacknowledge their perspective so you can\nsay hey i understand that you know\nthings should be done in a particular\ntime and that now that i'm 28 it's\nreally you feel like it's really\nimportant that i get married\ncan you help me understand a little bit\nabout why it's so important to be\nmarried at 28 as opposed to 26 or 30\nlike what changes so you can ask a\nquestion or two right so we're going to\nuse some good old hg conversational\ntechniques\nokay you can learn this from watching\nwhat we do on stream and how we ask\nquestions as we can also kind of this\nthese are things that we explicitly\nteach in group coaching\nright so you can ask questions\nand remember this is not when you're\nenforcing a boundary so it's a peaceful\nconversation okay i understand so it's\nabout kids\nyeah i understand so when i have my\nnewborn pictures it looks bad if i'm\nbald gotcha mom\ni'm with you there's kids there's this\nthere's that there's you know things\nneed to be done in their own time or if\nthey can't give you a good answer which\ni know is crazy but is oftentimes going\nto be\nis going to happen and they can't give\nyou a concrete answer they just think\nthat it should be done at that time\nbecause that's culturally what they\nbelieve\nyou can say i'm not really hearing a\nclear reason but it's clear to me that\nyou feel very strongly about this and\nthat it's very important to you\nand then like when you say things like\nthat they can't say this\nokay oh sorry i can't see that\nall right so you acknowledge their\nperspective that's going to be really\nimportant okay\nnext thing you can do is clarify their\nunderstanding\nthis also is going to reduce the tension\nwhen it comes to enforcement so what\ndoes clarify their understanding mean\nthat means asking them what they\nunderstood about your boundary\nso step number one\nwe're gonna say\nwhen we talk about\nwhen we talk on the phone i don't want\nyou to ask about personal or romantic\nrelationships\ncan you help me understand why it's so\nimportant i get married now\nthen what you're going to do is say okay\nso i just want to make sure we're on the\nsame page what did you understand about\nwhat i\nwant to talk about on the phone and what\ni want to avoid talking about on the\nphone\nso you want to ask them just make sure\nwe're on the same page so just like so\nyou know what did you understand like\nwhat are my preferences about what's off\nlimits on the phone\nand then they'll say like okay you don't\nwant to talk about manage okay\nokay great\ncool\nokay\nthen what you want to do\nis offer them anticipatory\nconsequences\njust so you know mom i'm so glad that\nyou understood and heard me\nthat you don't i don't want to talk\nabout marriage\nevery time we talk on the phone that\nreally means a lot to me\nif in the future you decide to ask me\njust understand that i'm going to go\nahead and like politely hang up\ni'm not going to like hang up on you but\ni'll sort of let you know hey mom i'll\nremind you i'll say hey remember when i\nsaid i don't want to talk on the phone\nand then like i'm just going to step\naway from the conversation\nright so you want to let people know\nwhat the consequences are so hey son\nit's saturday at noon noon\nstarting tomorrow starting this week at\n10 p.m no gaming after weekdays until\nyou have a 3.5 gpa\nokay\nand then you they're kind of like uh\nokay whatever because they're not\nplaying then right it's like you're not\nenforcing the limit so you're not going\nto encounter game rage by the way if\nyou're playing after 10 p.m\nno games for the next 48 hours or no\ngames for the rest of the week\njust so you understand\nokay you didn't understand okay what are\nwe starting next week i did things kind\nof out of order\nwhat are we what's the rule we're\nstarting what did you understand about\nwhat i said okay no games after 10 pm\nokay cool i'm glad we're on the same\npage by the way if you do play games\nafter 10 pm you're gonna on a weekday if\ni if you end up doing that\nyou're i'm gonna go ahead and take away\nthe game for the rest of the week\nokay so you want to lay out anticipatory\nlike\nconsequences ahead of time so once again\nthe goal here is to lay this stuff out\noutside of the conflict\nokay\nno games for 24 hours no games for the\nrest of the week you can do whatever\nanticipatory consequences you want\nright especially if you're a parent\nso\nthis is really really important\nimplementing a boundary let's kind of\nrecap so once we've articulated it\nthat's not enough there are all all\nthese important elements to implementing\nthe boundary that we have articulated\nwe've figured out the what when how\nright where\nwe figured out we don't want to get into\na bunch of reasoning but we also want a\ncouple of these steps when laying out\nthe boundary the first is that we don't\nwant to lay it while we're enforcing it\nwe need to separate that emotion and\nconflict from enforcement\nfrom the kind of intellectual discussion\nand notifying people right it's sort of\nlike when you get these notifications by\nthe way\nyour bill is due on the 30th by the way\nyour bill is seven days past due by the\nway in two weeks if we don't hear from\nyou we're to send you to collections\nthis is very very effective\nin terms of behaviorally sort of letting\npeople know what the consequences are to\nget them to comply with particular\nbehavior\nso we want to lay out the boundary ahead\nof time when no one is emotionally\nactive\nsecond thing is we want to acknowledge\ntheir perspective right so we want to\nsay it's not about it's not i understand\nthat you have feelings you have goals i\nrespect those goals it's just i can't do\nthis on the phone we can talk about it\nin person that's fine\nbut we're i just can't do it on the\nphone\nclarify their understanding\nyou want to make sure that it's actually\nsinking in because for a lot of people\nwhen you lay a boundary like they're not\ngonna it's gonna kind of go in one ear\nand out the other so you wanna clarify\ntheir understanding\nwhat did you understand about this if\nthey don't understand\nyou can say it again you can repeat it\nand then you can ask them right away\nit's gonna kind of feel like sort of\nartificial or maybe even make them feel\nstupid but that's okay\nright so you just wanna hey i understand\ni know it's weird that i'm sort of\nasking you to like again and again but\nlike i just want to make sure that i'm\ncommunicating clearly you can just say\nsomething like that okay\nthis is important to me and then you\nwant to offer anticipatory consequences\nso hey if you do this this is what i'm\ngoing to do so get ready for it because\nyou're probably going to do it okay\nthat's how you implement\nnow as you go to implement a boundary\nwhat will happen is you will screw it up\nright because this is hard\nand even you can sort of say i'd love to\nimplement this boundary but this is\nwhere like as a human being\nyou have all kind of thoughts\ngoals emotions\nrelationships\nego\nyou have all this crap floating around\nin your head\nand that's not all aligned\nright oh i want to study but damn do i\nreally want to play elden ring\ni really really don't want to hear about\ni don't want my mom to ask me about\nmarriage but internally i'm terrified\nand when i hear her speak the terror\nthat is in my heart it feels like\nemotionally satisfying in a bizarre way\nit's kind of like when i'm\ndoom-scrolling after i get dumped and\ni'm stalking my ex\non social media does it feel bad yeah is\nit addictive hell yeah\nright so there are weird internal things\nthat are going on in our body in our\nmind that cause us to screw up the\nboundaries that we try to set\nso pitfall number one\nokay\nwe kind of talked about this but\navoid\nlengthy\nexplanations\nso oftentimes\nwhen it comes to enforcing a boundary we\nwant to have long conversations about it\nwe want to justify hey i'm not crazy\nthat i'm doing this like here are all\nthe reasons why like please try to\nunderstand this is hurtful for me and\npay attention to me and understand me\nunderstand me understand me so don't be\nmad\ndon't\nbe\nmad at me\nthis is a powerful emotional driver when\nyou lay a boundary with someone this\nemotional driver\nis the single biggest driver to why\npeople screw up their boundaries\nbecause they don't want people to be mad\nat them\nokay\nso just avoid the lengthy explanations\navoid justifications\nwhy is this\nshouldn't you explain yourself\nit's kind of like simple behavioral\nstuff where oftentimes if you look at\nlike if you take 100 people who provide\nlengthy explanations and justifications\nand people who don't provide lengthy\nexplanations and justifications people\nwho don't provide lengthy explanations\nand justifications are just more\nsuccessful at setting boundaries and\nhaving other people adhere to them\nso you want to be like simple because\nonce you have a two-hour conversation\nabout feelings like\nwhat was that simply articulated thing\nthat you were supposed to do like i\ndon't even remember because now we had\nthis deep heart to heart where like we\nunderstand each other so much better now\nsometimes that can be useful we'll talk\nabout when and how to have that heart\ntart those are important but you don't\nwant to you want to avoid lengthy\nexplanations especially at the time of\nenforcement in enforcement it's about\nbehavior not explanation or\njustification\nokay\nnext stop\nokay so uh\nnext up is oh yeah this is huge prepare\nfor the consequences\nokay\nso now this is really tricky but when\nyou set a boundary with someone\nthey're going to be consequences for you\ntoo\nright this is something that you really\nreally need to understand so oftentimes\nthe reason that we don't succeed in\nlaying out boundaries\nis because we don't really like prepare\nfor the consequences and the\nconsequences are so emotionally painful\nthat we end up\ngiving up on our boundary\nand this has a devastating effect so\nwhen i lay a boundary\nand i don't enforce\nit what am i entraining\nthe other person to do\nwhat is the lesson they are learning\nthink about this for a second\nyep\nvery good\nmy boundaries\ncan be\nsafely\nignored\nwhat you are actually training this\nperson to do\nis disrespect your boundaries it's the\nexact opposite so don't lay a boundary\nunless you are prepared to deal with the\nconsequences this is part of the other\nthing that's very important about how we\nset boundaries this is why we don't want\nto go here because the consequences for\nthis are large the consequences for this\nare usually small\nand essentially what we want to do is we\nwant people to understand that once i\nlay a boundary\nthis is the hill i'm going to die on\nand this is where you just want to make\nthe consequences like relatively small\nfor them so even in this situation\nyou know having been this is close to\nhome but when you know parents are like\noh beta when are you going to get\nmarried we're not saying you can't ever\nask me about marriage that's too\ndifficult for your parents to handle so\nit's just when we talk on the phone and\nwhen i when we go when we go get\ngroceries when we go out to eat you can\nbombard me you don't want to say that\nbut you want to give them a place to\nbombard you and then eventually what\nwe're going to do is tighten that\nboundary right so you can say like hey i\nunderstand that this is important to\ny'all i really appreciate that we're not\ntalking about it on the phone can we go\nout to dinner like when we go out to\ndinner i just want to enjoy spending\ntime with you i don't want to think\nabout this stuff i understand you're\nworried we can like talk about it like\nonce a month like i'll come over on a\nweekend and we can just have one\ndiscussion about it i'm not saying that\ni'm i want to shut you down completely\nbut when we go out to dinner i don't\nwant to talk about this at all\nokay\nso\nyou have to be prepared for the\nconsequences\nfirst of all they could be emotionally\npainful\nsecond thing to really think about is\nthat people may treat you differently\nright so you may not get invited to that\nparty your friends may not ask you to\nqueue up with them if you lay a boundary\nit's possible so you have to mentally be\nprepared for that and the main thing\nhere is that you have to really\nanticipate the consequence so that you\nknow it's coming\nif you know it's coming\nmuch like this\nif you have anticipatory consequences\nyou yourself will be able to handle it\nemotionally better this is just like a\ngeneral aspect of human psychology where\nif human beings know something is coming\nthey are better able to deal with it it\nis the expectation of no boundary\nfollowed by the arbitrary setting of a\nboundary that is infuriating to deal\nwith and if you all have had controlling\nparents you know exactly what i mean\nhere where there are some people that\nlike it's like you just suddenly get 15\nphone calls between 9 15 and 9 45 where\nyour parents are like where are you\nwhere are you where are you why aren't\nyou home yet why aren't you answering\nyour phone the reason you have a phone\nis to answer our calls\nand you're like where on earth is this\ncoming from\nthey're like you know you're supposed to\nbe home by nine and you're like what are\nyou talking about we've never had this\nconversation before\nit's infuriating or the parent who comes\ninto your room and is like why aren't\nyou going to bed yet you have school\ntomorrow i don't want to unplug that\nvideo game right now\nif you don't employ i'm going to throw\naway a computer you see this hammer i'm\ngonna smash your playstation\nand it's like\nthere's no anticipation whereas if\nsomeone kind of tells you hey by the way\nthis is gonna happen at this time we're\ngonna shut off the internet\nright that's dad by the way\nnot mom come on\nheteronormative chat\nright so prepare for the consequences\nunderstand that like emotionally it\ncould be painful maybe i'll be a little\nbit lonely\nmaybe my parents will guilt-trip me\noh beta don't you understand your mother\nworries so much betta\nbhagwan\ndo you want to be a good son\nthen let me tell you how you need to get\nmarried four years ago you want to be\ngood son\nbut i think about your bar your\ngrandmother is in india and she is\nstressed so much she has diabetes and\nher blood sugar is bad because you have\nnot gotten married\nthink about your ba\nthe guilt trip may happen right so be\nprepared for it\nand it could be little things right so\nif you set a boundary with your gaming\nfriends they may like invite you less or\nlike they may like be dming you behind\nyour back or other kinds of petty crap\nwe'll talk about that in a second\nokay so you got to think about\nconsequences right so prepare for them\nunderstand that it's going to be tough\nthe good news a little reassurance here\nis that human beings tend to be\ncreatures of habit and if you\nset a small boundary with someone\nchances are they're not going to rupture\nthe entire relationship and this is\nwhere like if they're going to rupture\nthe entire relationship because you set\na small boundary with them that's\nsomething you need to understand because\nthis is not a relationship you can like\nwin in right when they're willing to go\nnuclear every time you like\nyou know try to lay a boundary with them\nabout taking out the trash\nlike this is not a healthy relationship\nthat you can win\nlike because you know a healthy\nrelationship requires two people to be\ncontributing\nokay\nthird thing\nis be aware that we sort of talked about\nthis a little bit but be aware of the\nemotional drivers\nto compromising\nyour boundaries\nso number one reason that you give up on\nyour boundaries it's not even the other\nperson\nyou give up on your boundaries is\nbecause of some kind of usual emotional\ndriver so like what is your weakness\nwhat do you have low amounts of\nresistance to\ndo you have guilt resistance\ndo you have what if they don't like me\nwhat if you have\nlet me think about this\nloneliness vulnerability\ni would rather be bullied than be alone\nright so and this is where you got to do\nsome some work because like this is\nimportant because what you don't want to\ndo is set\na hypothetical boundary that you wish\nwere true and that you wish you could\nenforce if you can't enforce it so you\nneed to think about this first and you\nhave to really think about what am i\nwilling to actually enforce\nand that's the boundary that you should\nset\nokay and like unless you because\notherwise what you're actually doing if\nyou like if you optimistically set a\nboundary it's like i'm going to a\nwedding and let me buy uh let me get my\ntux or my\ndress or whatever tailored to be like\ntwo sizes too small\nbecause that's gonna be motivation for\nme to like lose weight because now i'm\nlocked in don't do that kind of crap\nyou're just gonna end up looking bad\nbeing uncomfortable\nsome people will succeed it works for\nsome people when it comes to boundaries\nlike don't do that\nset boundaries that you can enforce\nbecause if you can win this one then you\ncan win this one and then you can win\nthis one and then you can win this one\nand then you can win this one this is\nwhat you want to do\nokay\ngradual so think a little bit about okay\nhow am i gonna feel and when i feel that\nway what am i gonna wanna do okay i\nbroke up with this person i'm gonna\nblock them and be prepared for the\nfeeling of loneliness that hits two\nweeks out because we're on again off\nagain this has been going on for three\nyears we've broken up six times\nso when you sort of do that be prepared\nfor that and be like okay so like am i\ngonna be able to resist in two weeks\nwell i need to resist that's not the\nquestion are you gonna be able to what\ncan you do to help you resist okay so\nlike it sounds like every friday night\nwhen the loneliness hits like i'm gonna\ni'm gonna start playing lost ark and\nwe're gonna schedule raids so i'm gonna\nbe like busy during those times or i'm\ngonna turn off my phone and i'm gonna\nput it in the different room and i'm\ngonna like watch movies or whatever so\nyou have to think about your own\nemotional drivers and kind of work on\nthose\nokay\nnow when it comes to in the moment\nso now we've sort of thought through\nyour emotional drivers we've thought\nabout the consequences of laying a\nboundary you've articulated things\nyou've sort of you know given them\nanticipatory consequences\nand you lay a boundary\nso how do you actually in the moment\ntell someone that you are enforcing a\nboundary like what do you say like in\nthat moment right so this is also\nsomething that we don't i don't see this\nanywhere i like i even did a google\nsearch for like boundary setting in\npreparation for this and i just saw like\nall this generic crap about like learn\nto say no\nlike okay how like why can't people say\nno like there's no\nso this is detailed okay so first thing\nis you state the boundary\nlike state it like literally hey mom\nyou remember what when we talked about\nhow like we're not supposed to your you\nagreed not to\nuh ask me about like marriage stuff over\nthe phone\ni asked you to not ask me about that and\nyou are asking me about that now\nokay\nso this is the key thing\nif you can you want to remind people\nof the prior conversation\nright so you can kind of these are is\nlike very short this is like five\nseconds this is five seconds these are\nnot long conversations\nmom do you remember when we talked about\nhow you're not supposed to ask me about\nmarriage\nokay\nand then don't get bogged down in\njustification\nif they're like no i don't remember\nor i uh be good they're trying to engage\nyou with discussion no but like things\nhave changed like that was different i\ndidn't realize you were talking about\nthis\ni didn't know i forgot\nno it's really important like this is\ndifferent like people were going to\nrespond to you with some kind of like\nengagement with conversation\nokay so they will try to engage with you\neither they will dispute the\nconversation in bad scenarios they may\ntry to gaslight you\nbut i think that word gets thrown around\na lot chances are they'll justify their\nactions so be prepared for\njustifications\ndisputes\narguments all that kind of stuff so we\ndon't want to get into that no\nexplanations\nthey can say you just want to listen to\nwhat they're going to say\nand then you can say okay i you can\nacknowledge if you want to here okay i\nunderstand that you think that this\nscenario is different\nand then what you want to do\nis consequence\nso you're going to say hey i i oh i'm so\nsorry i'm so sorry you can say okay good\ni'm glad you're sorry it seems like you\nunderstand i'm still gonna step away\nfrom the conversation\nthis is this is critical\nokay i want y'all to understand this no\ngames\nafter 10 pm\n11 pm rolls around and someone is\nplaying games\nremind of the boundary\nkid says\ni'm sorry\nit won't happen again\ncritical juncture\nwhat does the parent do now\nwhat does the parent do now\nno games this week\nyou enforce the consequence\nmom i'm so glad you understand i'm gonna\ngo ahead and hang up\nno no no no no\nbut i i said i'm sorry good i'm really\nglad you understand that you know you\nmade a mistake that means a lot to me\nbye\ni'll give you a call tomorrow\nright so you want to kind of acknowledge\ntheir perspective if they did apologize\ngreat\ni'm glad you understand\nenforce\nokay this is how people get like\nmanipulated so if you're vulnerable to\nmanipulation\nwhat tends to happen is you lay a\nboundary\nthey say i'm sorry\nyou don't enforce and what are you\nteaching the person\nthat i'm sorry is a substitute for\nrespecting my boundaries\nthis is literally what you're\nbehaviorally training the person to do\nyou're teaching them just apologize and\nyou can continue violating my boundaries\ni'm so glad that you feel bad about\ntaking advantage of me\nand turning me into a doormat let me lay\ndown on the floor so that you could walk\nall over me just make sure you apologize\nas you're doing that because that then\neverything will be okay\nokay\nthis is important so once the boundaries\ncross the boundaries cross you can\nacknowledge it\nbut\nit's enforced\nokay i'm glad you understand so\nhopefully next time this happens like\nyou know next time we talk on the phone\ni i really hope that you remember this\ngoodbye\nnow\nlast thing but does this mean that\neveryone will hate me the aftermath\nof boundary setting\nokay\nso first thing to understand\nis that relationships\nmust grow\nyour relationship cannot stay static\nover time it is just not the nature of\nrelationships\nso if we think about friendship if we\nthink about marriage if we think about\nyou know the\nparent-child relationship right so my\nrelationship with my parents when i'm\ntwo\nis different from what it is when i'm 10\nis different from what it is when i'm 20\nand is different from what it is when\ni'm 30 and 35\nright like that is a natural part of\nthings my marriage was when i first\nstarted dating my girlfriend our\nrelationship was one thing\nthen we were\nofficially dating then we became engaged\nthen we got married then we were like\nmarried prior to kids\nand then we're married with kids and\nthese are all different things like the\nrelationship must change over time\nrelationships have to grow just like\nhuman beings do nothing is static\nso what the key thing to understand\nabout boundary setting is that a lot of\ntimes we feel guilty for ruining the\nrelationship whereas like it's okay to\nfeel guilty\nright maybe you are ruining an aspect of\nthe relationship i know it sounds weird\nto say but sometimes aspects of\nrelationships need to be ruined\nin order for the relationship to grow\nyou can't just keep doing things the way\nthat you used to\nas relationships change\nso what you can always do once again\nthis is separate from the enforcement so\nthere's enforcement conversation\nand then like\nyou know 24 to 96 hours later\nthere's a feedback conversation\nso this is where you should like\nactively reach out to the person and say\nyou know so give your mom a call the\nnext day and say hey mom how are you\nwhat did you think i know i stepped off\nthe phone yesterday what was that like\nfor you so just ask them for feedback\nwhat was that like for you\nokay\ni'm glad we're talking you know are you\nokay with what i did or did you feel\nhurt can you tell me a little bit about\nthat you don't have to change your\nboundary\nbut you can ask to understand their\nperspective because this is where\nsometimes people get on this boundary\nsetting like\nhigh where they start just like laying\nboundaries man people don't respect my\nboundaries like if they don't respect me\ni'm not going to respect them and that's\nhow you turn and turn into an [ __ ] in\na relationship\nso it's important to lay boundaries\nit's also important to understand that\nsome of your boundaries may be i know\nit's shocking oh my goodness\nsome of your boundaries may be\nunreasonable\nright it's like i don't want to talk\nabout the dishes what it's like bro\nwe're roommates and you don't do your\n[ __ ] dishes\ni understand that it makes you upset but\nlike are you gonna do the dishes\nright so there's there's a different\nperson\ninvolved in this relationship\nso you have to like engage with that\nperson\nin the aftermath if you want to develop\na healthy relationship\nso you have to ask them hey what was\nthat like for you\nokay\nask for feedback\nso next thing to understand is that\nremember that boundary setting is one\nstep at a time\nso this is something you can gradually\ndo over time but generally speaking you\nwant to like maintain the relationship\nwith them by asking for feedback by the\nway asking for feedback is also uh\nactually let me move this around a\nlittle bit\nso before we do this one actually what\nwe're going to do\nis express feedback\nso ask for feedback first and then\nexpress feedback\nso this is where you can even express\ngratitude\nhuge for repairing the relationship\nhey mom\ni know that i set a limit yesterday on\nour conversation i'm really really glad\nand happy that you didn't like call me\nimmediately afterward and that like you\nanswered my phone today\ni ca i imagine that you must be or since\nyou've already asked them i know that\nyou're feeling upset about that and i'm\nreally grateful that you're like you\nknow choosing to respect my boundary\nhere it means a lot to me it makes it so\nmuch easier for me to call you and i\nreally hope that we can talk about this\nbecause i was noticing\nthat because you keep asking about this\ni felt like i didn't even want to talk\nto you\ni stopped answering your calls and\nthat's not the kind of relationship i\nwant with you\nso thank you so much for respecting my\nboundary it's hard for people to be\npissed at you when you say things like\nthat right and if they're still going to\nbe pissed at you they're like\nscrew you\nand then like that's someone that you\nmay not like that's like a toxic person\nthat you may want to be super careful\nabout letting into your life right so\nyou may want to set limits with them\nwhereas if they're reasonable people who\nare willing for their relationship to\ngrow like this is all going to be good\nstuff\nso oddly enough after you enforce a\nboundary expressing gratitude is a huge\nway to patch things up\nokay and then last thing is process your\nemotions huge\nexternally\nhuge huge huge\nso all this crap\nis gonna leave you with emotions this is\ngonna be the result of emotions\nthese kinds of like justifications and\nthings like that right like all these\ncomplex reasons\nthat we give people\nare due to our own emotions\nexpressing gratitude is going to be\nreally really hard\ntowards your parents\nif you were so pissed at them for\nbringing it up i told you i didn't want\nyou to do it\nand you did it anyway and i feel so hurt\nwhich is fine that you feel that way but\nyou don't want to bring that up with\nthem\nso here's the key thing about like\nsetting a boundary in summary\nyou want to be calm cool\ncollected\nwhen setting\nwhen enforcing\nand when doing debriefing afterwards\nif you get messed up in the head\nlike everything is going to get way\nharder\nokay because you want to make keep it\nlike nice and clean like we want\nboundaries to be clean clean clean\nso in order for you to be calm cool and\ncollected you need to take your emotions\nsomewhere else\nvent to a third party talk to a friend\non discord talk to a therapist go to\nyour group\nand talk to your group about hey i'm\nworking let's all set boundaries like\nlet's work on boundaries together okay\nthis is what we're gonna do this week in\ngroup\npick a person set a boundary let's all\narticulate the boundary ahead of time\nokay what's your boundary what's my\nboundary what's but okay that sounds too\ncomplicated that sounds like it's not\ngoing to work well\nokay what are the anticipated problems\nthat you're going to feel emotionally\nwhen you try to set a boundary\nwhat are we going to what are the\nconsequences that you can expect that\nwe're going to think through all these\nthings together so that we're prepared\nfor them okay let's go do our homework\nlay that boundary\ndon't enforce it have a conversation\nahead of time go do this thing\nokay\nand then like when you come in the next\nweek in group like it's gonna be a mess\nright because everyone will have screwed\nup because this is a skill just like\nanything else and then when everyone in\ngroup sort of struggles with it then you\nguys are gonna we're y'all are gonna\nwork together and hopefully like process\nyour emotions and then you're gonna try\nit again\nokay\nso to summarize\nissue number one\nhealthy boundaries are important\nyet no one teaches us how to set\nboundaries\nsetting boundaries is a lot more than\ntelling people what you want them to do\nif you want to successfully set a\nboundary you have to make it easy for\nthem to\nmanage\nhow do you make it easy for them to\nmanage you articulate it clearly number\none you don't provide a whole lot of\nreasons justifications complexity\nbecause that just invites argument and\ninvites discussion and then we lose\nsight of the boundary\nsecond thing to understand is once we\nhave an articulated boundary we want to\nreally separate out when we inform\npeople of the boundary and when we\nenforce the boundary\nboundary enforcement is filled with\nemotion\nfilled with people getting hurt and\nfilled with like people getting upset\nwith each other because a big reason\nthat we tend to\nforgo our own boundaries is to maintain\nrelationships so we want to remove that\nemotion from the equation by setting the\nboundary ahead of time letting people\nknow\nthere are a lot of pitfalls we have to\nwatch out for sometimes the biggest\npitfall is ourself\nwe don't want to feel guilty we don't\nwant to feel bad we don't want to deal\nwith the consequences so we end up not\nenforcing the boundary which in turn\nentrains the exact opposite behavior\nwhich is you're just teaching people hey\nmy boundaries don't need to be respected\nbecause\ni'm not going to do anything to you if\nyou don't respect them so you can just\nignore what i say\nokay\nthere are lots of common pitfalls that\nwe run into engaging in arguments stuff\nlike that\nnext thing is when it comes down to the\nactual enforcement of a boundary\nstate it clearly these don't need to be\nlong conversations they don't want to be\ncomplicated kinds of things we want to\nseparate out enforcement from debriefing\nand aftermath of a boundary setting so\njust say hey remind people of the\nboundary remind people of the\nconversation acknowledge their\nperspective in force and get the hell\nout of the conversation\nas quickly as possible right so what you\nwant people to experience\nis the behavioral consequence as opposed\nto like you said this and i can't\nbelieve that you did this and oh i feel\nso hurt and like oh my god\nand then you guys like talk for an hour\nyou kind of patch things up it feels\ngreat\nright oh you've like strengthened your\nrelationship i understand you so much\nbetter now oh my god i understand you so\nmuch better now and what happens next\ngot to be careful sometimes that leads\nto positive behavioral change sometimes\nit does not\nso by all means have that conversation\nbut separate it out from the enforcement\nso that conversation is important that's\nwhere we get to the debrief what should\nyou do afterward talk to the person\nexpress gratitude\ntry to understand their perspective\nmaybe explain a little bit of your own\nright oh i understand that you're sorry\nand you you didn't realize that you were\nkeeping track of time\nokay so it sounds like you know going\nforward you're going to be able to keep\nbetter track of time so starting next\nweek it shouldn't be a problem\nbut what about this week i said i\nlearned my lesson\ngood i'm really glad so it shouldn't be\na problem next week\nbut\nmy friends are raiding tonight okay\nwhat do you mean okay\ndoes that mean i get to play no\nwe talked about no games after 10 p.m\nand you played till 11\nand we discussed the consequence of no\ngaming this week so you can raid with\nyour friends next week but i'm going to\nmiss out on loot okay well\nyou'll miss out on loot\nand it's like\nthat's\nyou know they can say and this is where\nlike oh lude isn't important\nyou gotta think about what's important\nin life like don't get distracted all\nthat crap right so you want to hear\ntheir perspective okay i understand that\nrating is important to you it seems like\nthis is a really important deal that\nyou're missing out on writing i hadn't\nrealized that\nnow that you realize it\ncan i play no\nright so maybe you want to reconsider\nbut generally speaking enforcement is\nenforcement then you ask for feedback\nyou know you can express gratitude you\ncan acknowledge what people have kind of\ndone for you\nand\nif you're pissed\nlike decompress those emotions elsewhere\nfor now\nokay and that's how we set boundaries\nquestions\nkudos this seems like a very rigid set\nof rules\nyeah so it's rigid with y'all the cool\nthing is that when you do it properly is\nit going to feel rigid to other people\nyes which is what we want to do\nand you're not going to come across as\ncrazy you're going to come across as\nunderstanding compassionate and firm\nthat's what we want with boundary\nsetting right i understand what you're\nsaying\nokay so like this is still going to be\ngood\nthat's totally fine like\nit is rigid that's what people they\ndon't we don't want to be\ndoormats right\nand that's where like the more that you\nhave conversations the more that you\nunderstand their perspective like\nthere's going to be some rigidity\nbecause at some point you're saying no\nand you're putting up a wall between\ntheir actions and what you're allowing\nthat requires rigidity the question is\nhow can we optimize that process for\ncompliance on their part\nas well as maintaining the relationship\nsomeone's asking i've never set\nboundaries with my friends or family\nshould i do it do you need to\nthat's for you to figure out\nthis is a how\nnot whether you should\nbecause what i hear far too often is\nlike\ni need to learn how to set boundaries i\nhave terrible boundaries we see this all\nthe time\ni have terrible boundaries okay so like\nwhat are we gonna do about that right\nlike everyone's like oh my god i have\nterrible boundaries\npeople don't respect my boundaries okay\nlike what are we gonna do about it like\nhow\nlove yourself more like just learn how\nto say no like\nit doesn't work like this is not just\nlearn how to say no there's like lots of\nsteps\nand there's a reason why we have all\nthose steps each of these steps will\nmitigate the damage mitigate the\nemotions hopefully salvage the\nrelationship as best as you can the\nother thing is that when you do this\nkind of stuff like\nyou know if people are reacting very\nvery badly to it that's why we ask for\nfeedback and this is not like ask for\nfeedback and ignore what they say like\nreally pay attention to them because you\nmay be bad at setting boundaries\nand if this is the other thing to\nunderstand is that sometimes you sort of\nneed like a friend transplant like a\nfriend group transplant because if\nyou're with a group of people who really\ndoes not like boundaries being set on\nthem and you start enforcing boundaries\nyou may have to gravitate towards people\nwho are like will respect boundaries and\nmaybe your entire friend's circle won't\nso that can sometimes happen\nare boundaries ever worth being\nchallenged or is that toxic of course\nthey're worth being challenged because\nwho says that the boundary that you set\nis not toxic to begin with\nright so i have a boundary that i'm\nnever going to take out the trash that's\nmy boundary\ni need you to respect that\nit's like\nthat's not fair to me\nright so this is a relationship has\nmutual elements this is something that i\nsee a lot especially on the internet\nand someone will frame a problem a\nparticular way like oh like so and so\nlike they're not respecting like you\nframe because it's like you're biased\nright so you ask the internet for advice\nthe internet is like pitchforks\npitchforks pitchforks screw that person\nthey're not respecting your boundaries\nwhereas like you you know\nthe internet doesn't ask questions like\nokay like when they've\nwhen they try to respect your boundaries\nhow do you sabotage them which happens a\nlot\nright we self-sabotage when it comes to\nboundaries like maybe you should work on\nthat a boundary is not just because you\nset a boundary does not make it\nobjectively correct\nso be reflective\nhow to set a boundary with yourself to\nnot make myself suffer coming up coolest\nharold\nso what if one part of us feels like\nsetting boundaries isn't a good idea\nthat's completely normal the reason that\nboundaries are so hard to set is because\nthere's almost always a part of you that\ndoesn't think it's a good idea\nthat's why they're so freaking hard to\nset like why do you think it's so hard\nit's not because of other people it's\nbecause of you\nlike the reason we're bad at setting\nboundaries is because of our own\nemotional needs i don't want people to\ndislike me\ni don't want people to be mad at me it's\ngonna be\nmom and dad are gonna make a real mess\nof things if i set a boundary with them\nmy friends won't invite me over if i set\na boundary with them there's always\ngoing to be a part of you that does not\nwant to set a boundary\nnow this is where it's not like\nabsolutely correct that you should\nlisten to that or absolutely correct\nthat you should ignore it all the time\nlike that's not what the scope of this\nconversation is that's what you have to\nfigure out like where is the dividing\nline what is an okay amount of boundary\nto set with people and understand that\nsome people may not like it which is\ncompletely normal\nyeah so someone's saying i try to set\nboundaries and they still do the said\nthing that's where i'd ask you what are\nthe consequences\nwhen someone violates their boundary\nwhat are the consequences\nif there aren't consequences people\naren't going to respect your boundaries\nand you're like but i don't have the\nability to set consequences okay well\nthat's different\nso if you're like a 14 year old and\nyou're under the control of your\nnarcissistic entitled parents you may\nnot be able to set a boundary with them\nthat's unfortunate but it could be true\nand if that's the case that's where it's\nlike you just got to buy your time and\ntime is on your side\nbecause eventually you'll become\nindependent and then you can set\nwhatever boundaries you want to and\nthat's when they're going to say i'm\nsorry and that's when you're going to\nsay i'm i'm happy to hear you say that\nand i'm not inviting you to my wedding\nright\ngood i'm very happy to hear you say that\nbut i said i'm sorry yeah i understand\nthat\nthank you so much for saying that\nbut we want to come well it's like the\npsychological damage that you've done\nover me\nto me over the past 15 years\ncan't be wiped away with two words\nand\nmaybe you know i'm i'm happy that you\nsaid you're sorry i'm happy to try to\npatch things up for you but i don't\nthink that's gonna happen within three\nmonths\nand i want my wedding to be a day where\ni can be like happy and full free of\nstress and generally speaking that has\nnot been my experience with you\ndoes that hurt is it an oof yes\nand it's okay to say that\nright\nyou can acknowledge you can say like\nbecause here's the thing when they say\ni'm sorry and you say okay all is\nforgiven come to the wedding\nwhat are they going to do at the wedding\nexactly what they've done for the last\n15 years\nright\nit's the fact that they say you're sorry\nand you compromise your boundaries that\ngets you in this situation in the first\nplace\nso\nand some people may be like oh my god\nthis guy's such a rigid [ __ ]\nit's like\nokay\ni mean i really don't think so but i've\nbeen pushed to this do you does that\nmake sense to you i've tried everything\nelse over the last 15 years and it\ndoesn't seem to be working\nso\nthis is the best i can come up with\nwhat if it's unfixable after the wedding\nthen it's unfixable after the wedding\nright so the only the only reason that\nthings are unfixable is when one party\ndecides that they're unfixable otherwise\nyou can keep working at it\nright a relationship can keep on\nimproving as long as both parties are\ntrying\nand if they feel so hurt\nthat they are willing to sever their\nrelationship with you\nbecause you did not invite them to their\nwedding and they miss this milestone of\nyour life\nand they're willing to end the\nrelationship\nthat is exactly why you're not inviting\nthem to the wedding it is the\nconsequence of we will never talk to you\nagain if we don't come to the wedding it\nis that thought that they have planted\nin your head which is exactly why you\nneed to set a boundary with them\ndoes that make sense\nso this is it's a beautiful sentence\nwhat if they never talk to you again\nthat's like exactly what i'm saying man\nlike\nlook at this\nor a woman\ni don't know\num\nso this is the emotional drives\ncompromising your bound boundaries guilt\nwhat if they don't like me that's how\nthey that's how they propagate\nright that's how people take advantage\nof you\nis because there are powerful emotional\ndrivers what if my parents never talk to\nme again\nright you can like that's where like you\ndo your dharma so you they say like oh\nlike you know they're maybe they'll say\nif you if you don't invite us to our\nwedding we're never talking to you again\nand that's where you can say like yeah\nthis is exactly why i don't want you\nthere because anytime i try to set a\nlimit with you you just resort to\nemotional blackmail\nyou're threatening me with destroying a\nrelationship when i'm setting a limit\nwith you this is exactly why i don't\nwant you at my wedding\ndoes that make sense to you\nwhat but but\nno but it's such an important occasion\nthen you don't want to get down the\nimportant occasion round okay\nyeah i understand it's an important\noccasion that's why you know\nand then like\nyou know when christmas rolls around or\nwhen it's their birthday or whatever\nthey they may say we never want to talk\nto you again you can still call them you\ncan still send them a card\nand they get to rebuff you over and over\nagain\nand each time that you\nreach out the hand of peace\nand they swat it away you can rest easy\nat night knowing that you've done your\njob and that this is a truly\nunreasonable person\nso this is where like you know for three\nyears on their birthday you call them\nand you send them cards and they don't\nanswer\nthey send your cards back\nand then they find out then you stop\nsending cards and they find out through\nsocial media that\nyou have a kid they'd love to meet their\ngrandson\nwhat do you say at that point\nright you can\ni wouldn't recommend being punitive but\nyou can sort of like\nfor three years i sent you all birthday\ncards and called you and you didn't want\nany kind of relationship with me\nhelp me understand what's changed well\nnow we have a grandson okay so like\nso i'm hearing that you don't want a\nrelationship with me you want a\nrelationship with\nmy son\nwell no we want a relationship with you\ntoo then why didn't you ever pick up my\nwhy don't you ever answer the phone\nwell because it was hard for us okay\nwell i i'd really appreciate if you\ncould think through that and and help me\nunderstand\nwhat's going on because so far what i'm\nseeing is that when there's something in\nit for you you answer the phone\ni'm not seeing that you're demonstrating\nthat like\nwhat i want out of this relationship is\nimportant at all\nwell what do you want out of the\nrelationship\ni wanted some kind of contact over the\nlast three years well okay well we'll\nwe'll fix it going forward but why\nwasn't it fixed before i want to\nunderstand this like i'm not saying i\nwant contact going forward i've let go\nof that\ni tried for three years to build a\nrelationship with you and was rebuffed\nwhat i wanted was you to answer the\nphone three years ago\nwell i can't do that\nokay so then what are you expecting from\nme at this point\ngot to teach people that their actions\nhave consequences\nthanks for the gifted subs\nshould we move on\nright so this is where like you don't\nwant to be mean\nso this is where like saying those kinds\nof things seems harsh but it's not like\ni hate you you're a terrible parent you\ndon't want to ever say i mean you can\nimply those things if you want to but\nyou yourself should like let go of that\ncrap\ndoes that make sense you can say like\nyeah i understand that you want but like\nyou just state to them like i\ni don't hear from you for five years and\nnow that you have a grandson suddenly\nyou're reaching out like i'm so confused\nover the last five years you've given me\nevery indication that you do not want a\nrelationship\nand now i'm concerned about like this\nkind of person\nletting this kind of person into my\nson's life\nbecause what i'm seeing from you is that\nwhen you want something you pick up the\nphone\nbut when i want something you don't\nanswer\nand i'm not interested in having someone\nlike that be a central part of my my\nson's life\ndoes that make sense to you but\nblah blah blah\nokay i i heard what you said but did you\nhear what i said does it make sense to\nyou that i would not want someone when i\nneed something and i call that person\nthey don't answer the phone and when\nthey want something they pick up the\nphone and call them\nor call call me when they need something\ndo you understand remember we're asking\nfor understanding why i would not that\nwant that kind of person is part of my\nson's life well but but but but okay so\nthey say they\ndis-emulate again right so you can say\nokay so this is part of the problem is\nthat i've said something to you twice\nand i'm not hearing you acknowledge it\nat all\nso i'm going to go ahead and hang up now\nin order for this to work you need to be\nable to acknowledge and understand my\nperspective which is exactly what i\nthink the problem has been thus far\ngoodbye\nif these\nif my parents learn these techniques i'm\ndone for you're damn right you are we're\nteaching it to them\nbecause here's the thing generally\nspeaking when parents learn their tech\nthese techniques the kids hate it\nfor like\nthree months\nand then their life starts getting\nbetter and then they're grateful\nsorry\nbut\nyeah\nso at this point it's irreversible no\nit's not irreversible but like they need\nto acknowledge right it's not\nirreversible\nbut it's like unless they're gonna make\nsome acknowledgment of what you've done\nbeen through and demonstrate some kind\nof understanding\nthen like you're just signing yourself\nup for more of the same\nso this is the kind of thing where if\ny'all are stuck in life chances are it's\nbecause you're it's not because your\nparents were too harsh\nchances are they did a bad job of\nsetting boundaries on you and for those\nof you say my parents were super\ncontrolling super controlling is not the\nsame as setting boundaries\nthis is important to understand\nso like being super controlling is\nusually about arbitrary boundary\nenforcement\nif you think your parents were like set\nto i mean like does that make sense your\nparents didn't do the crap that i was\ntelling this is good parenting\nthis is how you set up a boundary with a\nchild you let them know what's coming\nyou give them an opportunity to act\nin the right way you give them ample\nopportunity to act in the right way you\nmake sure everyone is on the same page\nyou make sure they understand you ask\nthem for feedback even as a parent what\ndo you think about that i think that one\nweek was way too harsh\nand that's when you can say okay fine so\nif you think it was too harsh it sounds\nlike you're adhering now so if you step\nif you make a mistake again it'll be\nlike three days how does that sound to\nyou\nand that's when the kid is like stuck\nbecause it's like you're\nyou're moving in the right direction so\ndo they throw it in your face\nand say no you're like okay\nor do they like they do they take the\nwin do they take the w\nand build a relationship with you and do\nyou demonstrate to them or do they\nchoose to be pissed\nno it doesn't matter\nokay\nwell let me know if you change your mind\nand then they they step over the line\nagain if you want to be like a good\nparent then what you do is hey you\nremember last time when i asked you you\nmake a mistake again are we gonna ban it\nfor a week are we gonna ban it for three\ndays and you said it doesn't matter i'm\ncurious\nwhich one should we do this time\nand then the kid is like\nwhat's your angle my angle is that i'm\nyour parent and i love you and i i want\nyou to do well in school but i don't\nwant to harshly punish you and you said\nthat last time it was harsh punishment\nand then when i asked you about three\ndays like you didn't seem to care so i'm\nasking you again like which one do you\nthink is more appropriate\nlike three days it's like okay cool\nso if you screw up\non thursday or friday because today's\nmonday\nthen we're probably gonna have to push\nout to a week\nbut if you can manage thursday and\nfriday fine in your final next week like\nthree days seems more appropriate what\ndo you think\nlike\nso setting healthy boundaries is like\nreally good for kids\nit's how you learn how to regulate\nyourself so many of the problems in our\ncommunities because parents haven't set\nhealthy boundaries on you\nthey haven't taught you how to set\nhealthy boundaries which is why you\ndon't teach the you don't set them with\nother people\nyou all get that\nright so like\nand that's why like no one teaches us\nthis stuff parents no one teaches\nparents this stuff it's not their fault\nwe're not saying that parents are like\nbad people it's just like no one teaches\nthis crap and like can you imagine how\nhard it is to be a parent in today's day\nand age\nwhere it's like\nthere are people like grooming other\npeople on the internet and your parents\nhave to try to keep you safe your\n[ __ ] dumb ass 15 year old\nself they're trying to keep you safe\nit's so stressful\nand like now they have to deal with like\naddictive video games\nright like that's so much worse\nit's like so much harder it's like\nscrewing up kids brains even more\nand so it's like it's not easy for them\nand i think generally speaking i mean\nhopefully you have parents who love you\nif you don't you have my sincere\napologies\nbut it's hard\nand sometimes like you know\nthe simplest job of a parent is to keep\na child from screwing themselves over\nit's like you know that's like literally\nlike what your job is as a parent it's\nlike just a your kid is like\nplaying with a paper clip and an\nelectrical socket\nit's like you just you need to stop that\nright kid is like i'm going to jump off\nthe roof and fly like you need to stop\nthat kid is like i'm going to destroy my\nsense of habit and dopamine circuitry\nthrough excessive gaming like as a\nparent like you need to stop that we're\nnot saying don't play games we're not\nsaying don't let your kids play games\nwe're saying like we're not saying\nalso remember no gaming on weekdays\nafter 10 p.m okay\non a weekday on a school night we're not\nsaying no gaming on weekdays\nhealthy gamer yeah absolutely\nso i see that a lot of people are asking\nquestions about ocd and ptsd\nstuff like that\ni think um\noh do you set boundaries differently\nwith kids with adhd they just become so\nthese are all good questions i think\nfirst thing is that you know if you're\ndealing with someone who has these\nproblems or you yourself have these\nproblems definitely a good idea to talk\nto a provider about it but generally\nspeaking i'd say yes it does modify the\nimplementation of all of these things\nso for example someone with complex ptsd\nmay be a lot more vulnerable to their\ninternal emotional drives than the\naverage person\nthis is a case-by-case basis why you\nneed to talk to a clinician because it's\nnot like\ni i can't think of as i've i haven't\nread a single study about boundary\nsetting as a person with cptsd before so\ni don't know if there's research on that\nthat gets that level of specific\nspecificity that's why you need a\nclinician\nbut generally speaking i find that\npeople who have experienced trauma or\nhave a particular sum scar or things\nlike that there's a part of this process\nthat these aren't equally difficult\nparts of the process some people are\nreally good at articulating some people\nare really good at like you know dealing\nwith the emotional stuff some people are\nreally good at emotionally processing\nafterward\nsome people are like emotionally\nterrified of ever speaking to someone\nafter setting a boundary with them\nright so that's where you know just kind\nof depends adhd this is very important\nfor adhd\nso there's a lot of stuff about like\nboundary setting where because of the\nattentional component the anticipatory\npart is very important with adhd\nso that's where like you need to let\nthem know like not just\nthe saturday before the monday let them\nknow a week ahead of time\nfive days three days the day before lots\nof reminders because of their variable\nattention it may not sink in this is\nalso why you want to have them\narticulate their understanding\nbecause this is where like a lot of\ntimes what happens is kids with adhd who\nare usually smart\nwill use context clues to figure out\nwhat\nyou want them to say\nit's tricky they don't actually hear you\nthey're just so freaking smart that they\nfigure out what the right answer is\nand so what you want to do with adhd is\nmake sure you articulate their\nunderstanding and give them lots and\nlots of anticipatory guidance\nand also i would i would suggest being\nlike less harsh with\nconsequences and give them just it takes\nto slow it down\nwith adhd like more warnings\nsmaller steps\na lot of conversation in between\nyou"
