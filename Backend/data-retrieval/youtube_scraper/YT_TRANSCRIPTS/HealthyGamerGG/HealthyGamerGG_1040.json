    "transcript": "but in terms of people who do creative\nwork it's like devote yourself to like\nthe purity of your action man that is\nwhat makes human creativity so amazing\nright i don't know that like when\nmichelangelo made the sculpture of david\nhe was like i want a piece of artwork\nthat will be appreciated for thousands\nof years i don't know that that was his\ngoal\nwhat i imagine his goal is is like i\nwant to make just a magnificent piece of\nartwork\nso devote yourself to the action and\nit's fine to be an artist just make the\nbest art you can possibly make\ni have tons of creativity but no\npatience for creating recently i feel\nlike i had a lot of creativity exploding\na bit and sadly i never learned any kind\nof medium to put this creativity into\nthrough my life i tried several\npiano guitar drawing painting but none\nstick\nbecause in my case i was losing patience\neither i was not good enough to do what\ni wanted to do or i was getting to a\npoint that i didn't want to pursue the\nendeavor of trying to get better getting\nto a stage where you can't get better\nunless you just do or practice that's\ngetting frustrated and impatient\ni tried and tried and not don't really\nknow what to do\ni feel like i need to become a designer\nproject manager and give my creativity\nthat way\nbut not really sure how to do that\neither it's tons of\nideas of video or board game design book\nor vlog or podcast\ni tried several but due to the lack of\ninterest from others the ability to\nadvertise such creativity or having any\npersonal talent in any kind of artsy\nstuff i feel like it prevents me to\nbloom\ni feel like this impatience came from\nvideo game addiction and that the\nconstant gratification of having fun\nright now\nand working for any future thing is not\nreally easy i can on the spur of the\nmoment be really creative for like one\nor two months but then it goes dormant\nfor a few weeks or months\nso i guess i'm not sure what to do\nso this unfortunately is an increasingly\ncommon thing that we're seeing\nthat we have people out there who are\ninterested\nin doing creative work they're\ninterested in doing substantial work\nthey have a lot of like really powerful\nideas you know they genuinely want to\nhave a they have a create like an\nexplosion of creative energy\nand they can even direct that energy for\none or two months and make some very\nserious progress\nbut then inevitably what happens is they\nlose patience\nthey start to get very very you know\nconcerned about how things aren't really\nworking they start to feel like they're\nnot really living up to their potential\nand they feel like very very frustrated\nwith themselves right because you know\nthat it's in you like you've got it\nsomewhere in there but you just can't\nlet it out because even this phrase\nbloom i think is really important\nbecause it implies that the flower's\nright there right the butt is there it's\njust not able to open\nso how do you how do you understand this\nlike what do you what do you do if\nyou're in this situation where you have\nthese bursts of creativity but then you\neither\nlose patience or you get frustrated\nyou're not really willing to practice\nyou get kind of impatient like how do\nyou manage this\nthis is a great question\nand so how do you bloom when you're too\nimpatient to\nright\nthat's the question\nhow do you\nsort of understand this creative process\nhow do you get yourself to actually\ncreate\nso\nlet's start by kind of\nunderstanding a couple of basics okay so\nwhat's going on here\nso the first is\nhow to bloom\ncreatively\nso let's like take a look at what\nwhat this person has like let's look at\nthe pattern so let's try to lay out all\nthe pieces of the puzzle the first is\nthat they have creative energy\nthat comes and bursts\nand then fizzles\nokay\nthey also\nyou know will act for a while so they\ntend to have a problem of follow-through\nthey\nexperience impatience\nfrustration\nand they're not really able to how did\nthey put it\nthey get to the stage where you can't\nget better unless you practice\nokay\nso stop\nat\nthe\njust practice phase\nand then last thing is that they're\ncurious about whether this has to do\nwith constant gratification\nfrom video games\nso if you're creatively stifled\nlike how can we piece all these elements\ntogether what's going on here and how\ncan we start to like move forward in in\nkind of a positive way\nso the first thing that i want to do is\nlike talk about proposed answers\nso if you guys are looking at this\nthere may be some things that are\njumping to your mind so the first is\nlet's like look at the situation so i\nhave one month of creativity\nand then it fizzles\nso answer number one is discipline\ni need more discipline\nright because this this just practice\nis not something i'm willing to do\nso answer number one is or so like this\nfirst solution we're going to look for\nis how do i take one month of effort\ndevelop discipline so it becomes two\nmonths\npractice\nbecomes three\nmonths practice right this is the answer\nnumber one develop discipline\nrelated to this is we can say things\nlike just practice\nsorry bro the only way that you're going\nto learn to be creative is just by doing\nthis okay\ndecent answer\nokay\nand now let's try to understand a little\nbit about so maybe they say it's like\nyou know games have something to do with\nit\nso\nlet's think a little bit about games\nso what happens\nin a game\nso we have an action\nwe get a reward\naction\nreward\nand so basically we get rewards every\nstep of the way\nso the real way that we're going to\novercome this is by understanding what\nis happening in our mind\nso literally what is like happening in\nour mind when we play video games\nwhat are we actually training our brain\nto do so i want you all to understand\nthis the brain is kind of like an animal\nand it does what it's trained to do so\nfor example like if i sit there and i\nlearn\nthe alphabet\ni will train it time and time and time\nagain it won't be learning the alphabet\nisn't fun for those of you that\nespecially if you try to like learn a\nnew language like it's not fun right\nyour brain really really dislikes it it\nreally wants to revert back to like\nspeaking the language that is easy for\nit and that's because the brain is\nefficient\nso the brain is designed to be efficient\nand as it's efficient it detests\nadversity\nbut\nyou can train it if you teach at the\nalphabet it'll learn how to read and\nthen it'll be fine\nso when we play a video game what are we\ntraining our brain to do\nso i have\nor let's even talk about content\nalgorithms right so let's say like i'm\non reddit or youtube\nand when i get bored of something\nwhat do i do\ni click something else right\nwhen i play a video game oh this game is\nlike let me play dota for a little bit\nah dota is getting boring let me switch\nto eldon ring\nso in games what we're sort of doing is\nwe have an impulse\nand we gratify the impulse\nso what are we training our brain to do\nso neurons that fire together wire\ntogether remember that when it comes to\nhow the brain works\nneurons will fire once and then they'll\nget a little bit stronger and then it\nbecomes easier to fire again and again\nand again and again and that's how we\nform a habit\nso at that point things are automatic so\nwhat have we trained our brains to do by\nplaying tons of video games that have\nconstant gratification we've trained\nthem to do is respond to impulses this\nis essentially what we've trained our\nbrain to do\nis when you have an impulse just you\ndon't have to restrain it you don't have\nto control it you can just gratify it\nso our brain has been trained to gratify\nimpulses\nnow let's take a look at our\nperson who has creative or creative\nissues right\nso\nwhen the person\nhas a burst of creativity creative\nenergy\nwhat are they doing with their impulses\nwhat do you all think\nwhat are they doing\nah some people are saying nothing\ni feel like writing a book\nabsolutely\nacting on impulse\nlet me start a vlog let me start a\npodcast cool i've got this impulse and\nit's positive energy right it's\ncreativity\ni'm moving in the right direction i'm\ncreating something it's an explosion\nit feels so good let me work on it for a\nmonth\nthey're acting on impulse\nbut in a good way\nand then what happens is they get\nimpatient\nthey get frustrated\non day 30.\nand then they stop\nwhat are they doing\nare they acting on impulse\nso their mind is telling them\ni don't want to do this anymore\ni want to play a video game\nthey have that impulse\nacting on impulse\nso this is the key thing\nthat y'all need to understand\nthis is why people get stuck okay y'all\nneed to understand this very clearly\nexplosion of creativity\nplus discipline\nequals success\nthis is the formula\nthat everyone who is in this problem\nlooks for they say how can i start here\nand sustain with discipline and then do\nthis for one year how do i sustain this\nthat's the question it's the wrong\nquestion that's why everyone's stuck\nbecause this is half the problem\nthis is the same thing\nstarting on an impulse or quitting on an\nimpulse is still acting in relation to\nan impulse\nso this is the problem because here's\nthe thing\nthe brighter the candle the faster it\nburns out\nright the more excited i've seen this a\nlot like in relationships too\nwhere people who like fall head over\nheels over like they're like oh my god\nlike this is the best relationship in\nthe universe and then like three months\nlater it's like an absolute train wreck\nnot always\noften times\nsuper super excited about this kind of\nthing oh my god let's do this let's do\nthis let's do this and then like where\nis it three months from now i'm gonna\norder i'm gonna sign up for guitar\nlessons i'm gonna go go get this guitar\nand get these really cool pics this pic\nwas signed by my favorite artist oh my\ngod it's gonna be great it's gonna be\nlike i'm gonna play every day we're\nenjoying it yeah\nwow i'm my hands hurt my fingers i need\ni don't i need calluses calluses are\ntaking too long to form it hurts too\nmuch to play\nlet me put it down\nso as long as you're acting on impulse\nlike this is the problem is everyone\nthinks that explosion of creativity\nis a good thing\nand then impatience\nis the problem\nso they want to get rid of this and they\nwant to keep this\ndoesn't work like that\nthey're both the problem\nthis is the problem\nthe whole reason is because the way\nyou're starting the task is in the wrong\nway so you're doomed to failure that\ndoesn't mean that you can't use your\nexplosions of creativity we'll get to\nthat in a second\nbut this is sort of like you know like\nif you want light throughout the night\nyou don't want to light a firecracker\nright you want a candle\nso interestingly enough\nare if you want to learn how to be\nbetter at this you need to train\nyour impulsivity\nokay so this is like frontal lobe\nfunction\nand remember like people are smart right\nlike people like know things about\nthemselves so even as we look at this\nstatement\ni feel like impatience came from video\ngame addiction and constant\ngratification i would trust that\ninstinct do you all see this statement\nhere\nis a statement of understanding this is\na statement of their own experience it's\nnot theoretical\nthis is what they've learned\ni can on the spur of the moment be\nreally creative for one or two months\nand then it goes dormant for a couple of\nweeks these are both part of the problem\nit's all the same problem\nthe problem is that we think half of it\nis the solution\nwhereas that's part of the problem too\nso what do we do about this train your\nimpulsivity\nokay\nbecause if you start in an impulsive way\nyou're giving in to your impulsivity\nit's going to be hard to stop training\ngiving in to the impulsivity\nokay\nso\nwhat should you do about this\nthere are lots of different meditations\nfor training your impulsivity\nessentially any meditation technique\nwill work for this\nso this is where where i\ni kind of want to say just meditate but\nit's not enough to say just meditate\nwhat i want you to really do when you\nmeditate is recognize that the reason\nyou are doing this is to level up your\nimpulsivity you're trying to train the\nanimal that is your mind\nso this is where i think practices like\ntaratica\nare really good\nso you're going to stare you know you're\ngoing to do fixed point gazing so you\ncan do like candle gazing or something\nlike that and then your mind is gonna\nwander all over the place and then\nyou're gonna kind of focus on this thing\nyou're gonna train your attention to be\non one thing\nthe other thing that you can do is as\nyou do a focusing practice\nwhat i want you to do\nis wait\nfor the wandering mind\nyour mind is gonna wander if you say\nokay we're gonna concentrate on the\nsmell of this incense\nsmell the incense\nanother really good one here is watch\nthe smoke\nso watch the smoke that rises from\nincense like it's going to be a\nbeautiful plume just watch it\nand then your mind is going to wander\nand you're going to be waiting for it\nas it wanders you're going to bring it\nback\nso here's the smoke\ncoming up from the incense and your mind\nis going to go here it's going to go\nhere and then you're going to bring it\nback\nand every time you do this this is one\npush-up\nfor your mind it's one push-up for your\nimpulsivity impulsive action return\nimpulsive action return\nokay\nso this is like the first thing\nyou can train your mind\nsecond thing\nslow down your start\nbecause remember\ngiving in to the explosion of energy is\nstill giving into the impulse\nso slow down your start\nyou feel like doing this task for a\nthousand hours a day\ndon't do it for a thousand hours a day\nset aside a particular time of your day\nlike so make a schedule\nand don't give in to the impulses oh i'm\ngoing to read about vlogs i'm going to\nresearch this i'm going to do that i'm\ngoing to download some software i'm\ngoing to order a microphone i'm going to\ndo this like don't do all of that set\naside a time one to two hours\nmax\nper day\nrecognize that you have a limited amount\nof fuel\nand basically what you need to do\nis you need to\nhow can i say this\nuh space out\nyour creative energy\nto last\ninto\nhabit formation\nthis is the problem so when you engage\nwhen you have a burst of creative energy\nand you're like\ntoday i'm doing this i'm gonna start at\neight am\ni'm gonna end at\nfive pm\ntomorrow i'm to stay up kind of late\nplaying video games and i'm going to\nstart tomorrow\nat\nnoon\nand i'm going to go to midnight\nright i'm going to just like follow my\nimpulses i'm going to research\nmicrophones i'm going to look at what\nthese streamers are doing i'm going to\nlook at software today i'm going to look\nat software\nfrom\n2 pm\nto 4 pm\nyou don't build any habits because as\nlong as you're you're like building into\nthat like giving into the creative\nenergy it's like and then yeah on day\nfour i don't feel like doing it i've\ndone a lot of work right because i did a\nlot of work i did like 20 hours of work\non this project which is enough so let\nme take a break\nand then like the weekend rolls around\nand then you're doing this again\nso this is where what you want to do is\nmarshall that energy\nright it's kind of like if i'm gonna go\nfrom like point a to point b with a\ncandle\nand i need to light a fire at point b i\nneed to like make sure that candle stays\nlit i don't want to firework\nlike\ni need to have that creative energy last\nuntil i can start recruiting other parts\nof my brain like habit formation\nbuilding a schedule\nwhat that also means is that your action\nso when you do this\nyour actions are going to get decoupled\nfrom reward\nthis is huge\nright so how does this person know when\nto stop at midnight\ni guess they're kind of like the impulse\nis gone or they've achieved some kind of\nreward or they got lots of rewards\nthat's what's sustaining their energy\nso the reason i can do it for one month\nis because just like rpgs or mmos\nlevel one to ten\nyou can get in like five hours\nbut level 50 to 60\ntakes five months\nsame is true for real life right rpgs\nhave captured that mechanic really\nreally well\nright so what you need to do is decouple\nyour actions from the reward and the way\nthat you do that is by spreading out\nyour creative energy and making a\nschedule so this is what i'm going to do\nfor today and now suddenly what you're\ndoing is training your brain to be\nsomewhat different which is that the\nactions are not going to be reward based\nand they're not going to be impulse\nbased it's going to be in the opposite\ndirection from what video games train\nyou to do\nand once you start using these things\nlike schedules once you start using\nmeditations you'll start to move in the\nright way but oftentimes i find that the\nbiggest the trickiest thing\nis that when people have these bursts of\ncreative energy\nwhat they look for is discipline right\nyou have the burst of energy\nand they don't see this as the problem\nthey see it as like\nyou know the good thing\nand then what they're missing is\ndiscipline so all they're focused on is\nhow do i make discipline how do i make\nit difficult which is totally fine i\nmean it's not it's good to build\ndiscipline but you have to understand\nthat this whole phenomenon is actually\nthe problem that giving it into the\nimpulses of your mind which is how\nyou're it's trained by video games which\nis absolutely correct is the problem\nand what you want to do is don't give in\nto those impulses\nspace things out harness that creative\nenergy to build a habit\nas you start to like rein in that\ncreative energy what you will naturally\ndo is decouple actions from reward\ninstead what you'll start to do is\ninstead of getting some kind of dopamine\nenergy oh my god this is so cool this\nsoftware is awesome\ninstead what we're going to get is like\nyeah like i did what i was supposed to\ntoday good job\nright\nthis is what i want at the end of the\nday\ni want three check boxes that you make\nthe day before that get checked the day\nafter\nthis is what you need to do it's not\njust like i don't know what i'm going to\ndo no you know check boxes i'm going to\njust wander over here and then i'm going\nto wander over here and then let me\nconfigure this and let me order that\nthere's no organization to it it's all\nimpulsive flow and as long as you're\ngiving in to that impulsive flow it's\ngoing to be very difficult to accomplish\nanything creatively\nquestions\ni'm an artist at my full-time job and\nthe session is so helpful fantastic\nthat's what we're here for\nso someone's saying so basically\nmeditation in a to-do list no it's a\nvery good question\nso this is the problem\nwhen we look at the actual solution\nit seems simple right so basically a\nmeditation a to-do list\nthe difference so let me put it this way\nlet's say you have two people one person\nwho\nworks out regularly or let's say one\nperson who eats healthy and one person\nwho doesn't eat healthy and so you look\nat them and you kind of look at their\nbehaviors\nand you say like so basically just order\nsalad every day right\nsure that's what it looks like on the\noutside what's the difference between\nthe person who eats healthy and the\nperson who doesn't eat healthy their\nactions are different sure\nbut the internal mindset is actually\nvery different this is very important to\nunderstand\nso for the person who eats healthy\npeople assume like if i eat unhealthy\npeople think okay i'm undisciplined and\nit requires a lot of willpower to\novercome my internal impulses so that i\ncan order a salad instead of a burrito\nand so people look at the action they're\nlike okay i just need to eat salad every\nday right whereas if you talk to the\nperson who eats healthy how much will\npower do they use on a daily basis very\nlittle\nvery little\nso when you're asking is it basically a\nto-do list and meditate that's what it\nlooks like on the outside but if you\nactually want to succeed it's not about\nwhat you do on the outside it's about\nthe internal work\nit's about the barrier of entry to doing\nthe right thing that's what we need to\nchange\nand that starts with understanding right\nwhen i talk to people who go to the gym\nfive days a week and i ask them how hard\nis it for you to go to the gym they say\nit's very easy\nso that very easy versus very hard is an\ninternal change it's a mindset shift\nit's some amount of habit that's what\nyou need to change\nit's not the actions anyone can tell you\nto like you know i could have just\nlook at this for a second\nthis is not what i did today i didn't\nsay\nhow to bloom creatively\nmake a to-do list\nmeditate\nthat's it rest of this doesn't matter\nthis is all useless useless useless\nuseless\ni didn't give you a 30 second answer\nright because what needs to change for\npeople you see this with like alcohol\naddiction as well\nwhere it's like i woke up one day and i\njust realized that enough is enough\nhow do you become sober just stop\ndrinking\nthat doesn't actually help\nright sure it's correct\nbut like the struggles that we have are\nnot in the action themselves we all know\nwhat to do\nthe struggles we have is the mindset in\nthe internal work so that needs to\nchange and how does that need to change\nit starts by diagnosing the problem\nproperly which is that giving in to your\ncreative impulses is dooming you to fail\nthat at the end of the day giving in to\nyour creative impulses and giving in to\nyour impatient impulses is still giving\nin to your impulses\nif you're misdiagnosing the problem\nyou're going to stay stuck\nso marshall that creative energy that's\nthe first thing you should do is\nrestraint\nrestraint from joy restraint from\nburning yourself out through a month of\nintensive creative activity\nmarshall that creative energy\ndrip it throughout 30 days 60 days 90\ndays then you'll start to recruit habits\nthen it'll start to be easier for you\nthat's what needs to change is the\ninternal stuff\nright we have thousand tutorials on\nyoutube telling you you read a thousand\nbooks about how to write a best-selling\nnovel\nwe can take as many classes as you want\nto you can take brandon sanderson's\nwriting class on youtube which is\nfantastic you can listen to podcasts\nthere's like the answers are out there\nhow do i write a bestselling novel you\njust sit down and you write\nthat's the problem is the mind seeks a\nsolution it doesn't want to do the\ninternal work\nso it's about internal resistance\nunderstanding why you do what you do\nunderstanding your impulses because once\nyou understand like what's under the\nhood then you can start to make\nadjustments\nand as you tweak a little bit here and\ntweak a little bit there then the\nresults that you get will be quite\ndifferent\nso it's so much more than a to-do list\nin meditation although that is correct\nthat is the essence of it\nright it's what's on the inside what\nmakes it hard to follow a to-do list\nwhat makes it hard to meditate that's\nwhat you need to understand that's the\nindividual resistance\na wonderful question though\nsomeone's asking how do you make it into\na habit by slowing it down from the\nget-go\nthat's how you make it a habit\nright\nso slow it down so if you want to like\nstart doing push-ups every day like\ndon't start with 10 start with one right\nbefore you go to bed last thing you do\ni'm gonna squeeze in one push-up before\ni go to sleep\nthat's how you build a habit\nokay\nall right\num\nso\noh my god this is such a good question\ndr\ncan you be truly creative if you turn it\ninto a habit that is when you are the\nmost creative\nso here's the other thing to understand\nabout creativity\nwhen did creativity stop being in our\ncontrol\nwhen did we start treating creativity as\ndifferent from anything else that we do\noh yeah in other dimensions of my life\ni can have a routine and i can have a\nhabit but when it comes to creativity\ni'm just gonna send it out the window\nincorrect\nso the people who are successful artists\nare the ones who make a habit of\ncreating\nit's a skill to access that creative\npart of yourself\nright so this is where like if you look\nat um what's his name\nmahali shikset mahali\nright the guy who developed flow he's\nlike talking about developing a process\nto access that creativity\nthe states of meditation are very\nsimilar as well well it's like you can't\nlet me put it to you this way like so\nyou can't create a state of sleep right\nyou can't just feel like i'm asleep\nno\ncan habit help with sleep absolutely\neven though you can't create it in fact\nit facilitates it\nso when you develop a good creative\nhabit when you develop a good process\nit primes your brain\nto like be in the right mode and then\nonce you're in the right mode like the\ncreativity actually flows more easily\nthe problem is that\nthe reason you think creativity only\nflows at random times is because the way\nthat you've allowed it to flow is only\nat random times\nright there's a difference between like\nrelying on rain\nfor water and building a well\nlike if you just wait for it to rain\nthen of course you're going to think the\nonly time i can get water is when it\nrains what i'm telling you to do is\nbuild a well\nand then suddenly that truth which is\njust as true the only time the rain\ncomes is like\nwhen it rains right that's the only time\nto get water but if you build a well it\ncompletely transforms your ability to do\nthings\nso habit and creativity can go hand in\nhand\nabsolutely the problem and it's not even\nan incorrect conclusion because you just\nhaven't built a well yet right so you\njust assume based on your prior\nexperience that the only time i've been\ncreative is when it rains\nthat's the only way to get water because\nthat's my experience so\nquestion it explore it look at that\nresistance try building a habit and see\nwhat happens to your creativity\nexcellent questions\nso someone's asking i like art and want\nto make a career out of it is it wrong\nto make that a goal and outcome focus\nyes and no\nso this is where generally speaking we\nwant action focuses instead of outcome\nfoci\nbut remember that all of these things\nare not they're not like objectively\ngood or objectively bad what they are i\nwant you all to understand what the\noptions are and choose the appropriate\ntool\nso of course like in some ways you want\nto be outcome oriented right like if i\nget a job for example i need to be like\noutcome oriented with respect to salary\nso that i can pay my my dues like i can\npay for myself i can go on vacation i\ncan you know support my family whatever\nthere's nothing wrong with that\nthe problem is that we become overly\noutcome focused and the main thing is\nthat we've become\nunintentionally outcome focused\nwe've started to be controlled by\noutcomes\nthis is where if you want to be an\nartist what i would recommend to you\nis that you don't try to become a\nbest-selling\nauthor\nright or artist\nwhat you try to do is make the best book\nand that's a subtle but very important\ndifference\nright so write the best goddamn book you\ncan\ndon't worry about becoming a\nbest-selling author\nparadoxically it's the people who worry\nabout becoming best-selling authors that\nhave the hardest time becoming\nbest-selling authors and it's the people\nwho don't try to become best-selling\nauthors and focus on writing the best\ngoddamn book that they can that wind up\nas best-selling authors\nnow you may have to make some\nadjustments and stuff based on like\nmarkets and stuff like that so i'm not\ni'm not saying you're ignoring all that\nstuff\nbut generally speaking with artistic\npursuits\nlike the best games are going to come\nnot out of like formulaic understanding\nof things but someone who's like i want\nto play a game where\ni can do this\nso like even elden ring is like i hope a\ngreat example where from software was\nlike we want to make a dark souls game\nbut we want it to be open world\nand that's our goal it's not we want to\nmake the best selling game on steam\nthat's not their goal maybe it is i\ndon't know i mean i\ncan't speak for them but in terms of\npeople who do creative work it's like\ndevote yourself to like the purity of\nyour action man that is what makes human\ncreativity so amazing\nright i don't know that like when\nmichelangelo made the sculpture of david\nhe was like i want a piece of artwork\nthat will be appreciated for thousands\nof years i don't know that that was his\ngoal\nwhat i imagine his goal is is like i\nwant to make just a magnificent piece of\nartwork\nso devote yourself to the action and\nit's fine to be an artist just make the\nbest art you can possibly make\nand then do the business stuff right\nlike it's important to do that
