    "transcript": "you all ready\nlet's do it\nokay\nnope\nso why do i 19 male get so triggered by\npeople having a different opinion from\nme and how do i fix it at 14 years old\nmy dad left the family i was raised by\nhim to be one of those men who doesn't\nshow any emotions and i got pretty good\nat it i don't know when but at some\npoint that year i decided this sucked\nand started training myself to show more\nemotions i was home schooled up until 18\nso i was very sheltered and pretty much\ngot anything social from my family their\nclose friends or the internet\nduring that time i was very active on\ntwitter joined a ton of fandoms and was\naround people who believed in the same\nstuff and enjoyed the same things i did\none toxic thing about social media is\neveryone quote retweets stuff they\ndisagree with and spreads it\neventually i started muting nearly every\nword that could possibly show me any\nanything like racism lgbt phobia\nislamophobia eventually i started to\nmute stuff i like so i didn't have to\nsee other people's opinions on it\nbecause anything bad would lead to a\npanic attack\ni also had 30k blocked users\ni decided to leave twitter in 2021\nbecause i didn't want to deal with the\npanic attack with a panic attack every\nweek fast forward to 2022 and i'm a mess\nwell i've successfully interacted with\nother people and don't suffer from\nsocial anxiety to my surprise\ni still suffer from the same problem\nanyone who has a different opinion\nfrom me call or call something i like\nbad can risk making me feel 24 times\nworse\nwhile i no longer suffer from panic\nattacks for the opinion reason and while\nirl is is not as bad as it was online\nit's still a problem i deal with\nsometimes i get huge urges to look up\ntriggering content or scroll through a\nsub that is the opposite of what i love\nor look up bad reviews for shows i like\nand i have no idea what the motive is\nsometimes i do it and make my mental\nhealth worse\ni know i'm\nthe problem here and i'm not going to\nchange everyone's mindset nor do i want\nto but i would like advice on dealing\nwith this\ngreat post so today a chat what i'd like\nto talk to you all about is generally\nspeaking the concept of like ego\nidentity and like how to grow in a\npositive way with respect to these\nthings\nthese are things that we've seen a lot\nof interest about in the last couple of\nmonths even i guess years like since the\nbeginning of our community but i think\nthat as people sort of start to\nlearn some of the basics about ego and\nidentity what we've sort of discovered\nis that there's more and more interest\nfor learning like more about this stuff\nso what i'd like to do today is kind of\nwalk y'all through um\nhow can we understand this situation and\nthe key things that i'm going to point\nout are so this is a person who gets\nvery upset when people have differing\nopinions from them\nright so there's like there's going to\nbe some issues here that we're going to\nkind of dig into okay so let's go ahead\nand and take a look at those\nso the first is i want y'all to kind of\nso we're going to be talking today about\nthe ego\nor the sanskrit ahamkar\nand i like the sanskrit definitions\nbecause remember that the eastern\nperspective of the mind was developed\nthrough introspection\nso these are yogis that are sitting you\nknow in a cave in the mountains just\nwith their eyes closed and observing\ntheir mind whereas the western\nperspective of the mind is developed\nmore objectively and externally so like\nif we think about you know major\ncontributors to the western models of\nthe mind they're people who made\nscientific observations the key thing\nabout scientific observations is that\nthey're from the outside right so\nsigmund freud would listen to people\nspeak\nand using their words would approximate\na model of the mind based on people's\nwords\nnow the downside of this i think is very\nsimple\nthere's upsides and downsides the\ndownside is that just think a little bit\nabout the gap between your words and the\nfunctions of your mind right there's a\npretty big gap there generally speaking\nas we become trained listeners and\nthings like that we can try to shrink\nthat gap as people become more authentic\nwe can try to shrink that gap\nbut ultimately i don't know how good\nwords are it is tools to understand\ninternal processes\nthe upside of the western method is that\nit's objective right so if i'm studying\nmy own mind i'm going to be\nsubject to cognitive biases\nwhereas in the objective model like\nespecially if you look at like cognitive\nbehavioral therapy or like the work of\naaron beck these are people or the\nbehaviorists right they made like lots\nof observations and so you can use the\nbenefit of science use the benefit of\nlots of subjects to come to a more\nobjective answer the reason that i'm\ngoing to talk about sort of the eastern\nperspective today is because i find that\nthe eastern perspective is more\nrelatable as an individual so for\nexample if i say this is the edible\ncomplex and i can explain intellectually\nthe edible complex and people can even\nsay oh yeah like that on some level\ndescribes my experience the challenge is\nthat your experience of your mind from\nmoment to moment is is less likely to\nmap on very easily to the edible complex\nit requires like a lot of work to bridge\nthat gap whereas the eastern perspective\nof mine the reason i like it is because\nit seems very accessible to people like\nthis is a model of the mind that i've\ntaught to like 10 year olds and they\nsort of get it okay\nso let's let's just talk a little bit\nabout the ego or the hum guard so the\nfirst thing that i want to point out is\nthat\ngenerally speaking when we have kind of\ntoxic or negative influences\nthere are two ways that we can deal with\nthem okay one is externally\nso in this case this person is\nblocking people\nright\nand this sort of makes sense like we can\nlimit our environment so one way is to\nexternally deal with the stimuli right\nso what we want to do is kind of like\nwe want to limit\nwhat enters\nour\nsenses or indriyas so the ego or the\nhump guard is the sense of identity\nwe're going to take sort of an eastern\nperspective and if we look at that post\nwe remember that there are toxic or\nnegative influences and the way that\nthis person is dealing with those toxic\nor negative influences is largely\nthrough external sources so they're\nblocking people on twitter and the yogis\nsort of understood this as well this is\nwhy people will go to monasteries\nor ashrams\nfor you know like spiritual study for\nexample this is why we like go to school\nright so we tend to control our external\nenvironment to facilitate a certain kind\nof action within the mind so changing\nour environment can be very very\nimportant\nbut there's another aspect here which\ncan be internal right so if we think\nabout like i don't know that you block\n30 000 people on twitter\nbut think a little bit about you know\nanytime something external happens\nthat's a disruptive anytime something is\noffensive to your sense organs or\ntriggers some kind of negative emotion\nthe solution isn't necessarily to just\nblock it right so there's some amount of\nlike internal\ndealing with negative things and that's\nwhat i'm going to call resilience\nand so what tends to happen if we kind\nof think about you know why do i call\nthat resilience it's like\nwhat do we think of as resilience\nresilience is the ability to like\ntolerate and withstand like negative\nthings right so someone who's resilient\ncan deal with some amount of like\npunishment or toxicity or whatever\nso what we're going to explore today is\nsort of this this aspect here and\nbecause it seems like this person has\ndone a really good job of sort of\nexternally controlling their environment\nso what i want to kind of point out is\nthat resilience is the way that we sort\nof tolerate what i'm going to call\ndiscordance so if i believe thing a and\nsomeone believes thing b\nresilience is sort of the ability to\nlike tolerate this gap right so this is\nwhat resilience is so if if i think that\ni'm you know a good person and someone\nis calling me a bad person my ability to\ntolerate them saying that has something\nto do with my degree of resilience right\nso if my teacher says oh you're terrible\nat math but deep down i know i'm good at\nmath like i'm resilient i'm not going to\nlet that affect me or i won't let it\naffect me very much\nso this kind of internal this\ndiscordance between you and the outside\nworld is like what i sort of think of as\nresilience the other thing that we can\ntalk about this the other word that we\ncan use here is confidence and this is\ngoing to become important especially as\nwe start talking about ego right so if\nwe think about someone who's confident\nthey can tolerate discordant opinions so\nif i'm confident in my let's say\natheistic beliefs and there's someone\ni'm talking to who has very religious\nbeliefs i can sort of acknowledge that\nlike yeah i don't think you're correct\nlike i believe what i believe you\nbelieve what you believe like that's\ntotally fine i happen to think that\nyou're wrong and that i'm correct\nbut like i'm not gonna get bent out of\nshape over it right it's not gonna\naffect me like emotionally or powerfully\nit's not gonna send me into a panic\nattack you can easily reverse the\nscenario right you can say someone who's\nreligious there's someone who's\natheistic you may disagree with them and\nthat's totally fine we're not saying one\nperson is right or one person is wrong\nwhat i'm talking about is internally how\nconfident you are and how resilient you\nare determines\nhow much you can tolerate\ndiffering opinions or discordance\nbetween you and the outside world\nso the other thing to understand is that\nthe ego\nneeds concordance\nright so we say that the confidence\ndoesn't necessarily need concordance you\ncan tolerate people disagreeing another\nsimple example is like let's say you\ndecide to break up with someone or\nsomeone decides to break up with you and\nit's kind of like an amicable breakup\nbecause both you all decide okay this is\nlike not the right relationship nothing\nagainst you personally it doesn't mean\ni'm a bad person or you're a bad person\nit's just not working out so if you have\ntwo confident people in a relationship\nwho sort of mutually kind of decide like\nthis is not the right fit like they can\nwalk away from that without getting\nemotional about it without getting i\nmean there may be some emotions which is\ntotally fine but not getting like their\negos attacked right oh like why are you\ndoing this to me oh my god i'm so\npathetic i'm sorry i failed you oh my\ngod you're so pathetic like why can't\nyou be better so that's like the action\nof ego right the confidence is like\ndifferent from that there's a whole\nvideo about confidence versus ego and dr\nk's guide and i'm almost half assuming\nthat people have sort of watched that\nbut if you are more interested in that\nwe go into more detail but we'll kind of\ncontinue going now\nso the ego needs concordance another\ngood example of this is like if we think\nabout someone who's egotistical like\nthey need praise right because the thing\nabout ego is that if we say that\nconfidence and ego\nare at the opposite ends of a spectrum\nright and you can either move this way\nor this way\nwe can think about the egotistical\nperson as someone who like needs\nreassurance from the outside world\nthat's why they're egotistical that's\nwhy they'll they'll advertise their\nsuccesses right these are people who\nwill\nbe very very vocal about their successes\nthey'll be vocal about how much money\nthey make they'll be vocal about the car\nthey drive they'll be vocal about how\nthey're better than other people they'll\nbe really really vocal and why is that\nit's because since you don't believe it\nabout yourself\nyou have to convince other people right\nso you want something to be true\nand like the more that you can convince\nother people the better off you will\nfeel about yourself because internally\nyou don't really feel it yourself so the\nego unlike\nthe confidence or the lack of the\nahamkar needs concordance right and what\nresilience is is the capacity to\ntolerate discordance and when we are\nnot resilient or we sort of don't have\nthat confidence within ourselves\nsometimes the most effective solution we\ncome up with is to block people is to\nlimit our external surroundings right i\njust can't tolerate this kind of thing\nbecause it makes me feel bad not quite\nsure why or how but like so i'm gonna\nshut it off which is okay like you can\ndo that right that's like a healthy part\nof it like we said earlier monks engage\nin the stuff students engage in the\nstuff it's not bad it's just important\nto understand what your options are and\nactually use both of them\nso the next thing to understand um\nabout\nkind of ego is that like let's kind of\ngo back to um\nlet's actually take a quick tangent and\ntalk about attachment theory for a\nsecond\nso i know that this is sort of an\neastern perspective but if y'all are\ninterested in sort of the science behind\nsome of this stuff we can talk about\nattachment theory for a second so how do\nwe develop confidence right so this is\nthe main question okay dr k you're\nsaying that confidence is is good ego is\nbad so like how do we develop confidence\nand this is where thankfully like\nscientific research right so this is\nwestern psychology um\nyou know the\nthere are a lot of excellent uh uh\nresearchers who sort of developed this\nidea called attachment theory\nand attachment theory essentially is\nlike in my opinion or i don't know if\nit's the best but it's the\nscientific explanation for confidence\nthat i personally like the most so some\npeople go through life and are confident\nother people go through life and are not\nconfident right this is like a general\nstate of their being and sure confidence\ncan vary in terms of whether we're\ntalking about lost ark or plumbing right\nbut like generally speaking some people\nare more outgoing more confident some\npeople are more concerned that the world\nis a dangerous place and a simplistic\nway to kind of dig into that attachment\ntheory is very very vast and deep and\ncomplex i'm going to try to over some\noversimplify here for a second\nbut what the researchers in attachment\ntheory essentially discovered is that\nwhen we are emotionally mirrored\nearly in childhood\nwe develop confidence\nokay so i'm going to talk a little bit\nabout what this means\nso early on when we're like\none year old or two years old or three\nyears old\nwhat happens is like we don't understand\nthe world right like the world doesn't\nmake sense it's entirely new\nso the way that we develop confidence\nwhat people noticed is that when\nchildren are around\nadults that emotionally mirror them\nthose are the children that become\nconfident so when i like fall trip and\nfall and i hurt myself\ni'm feeling pain right i don't know\nexactly what that is because i'm a\none-year-old like i don't understand the\nphilosophy of pain all i know is that it\nhurts i'm not i'm kind of confused like\ni'm a kid i don't understand stimuli yet\nright all i know is in a vague sense it\nhurts\nso then when people around me respond\nright so when my parents come and pick\nme up they're like oh poor baby and this\nis also interesting because it's\nconserved between cultures but\ngenerally speaking parental figures and\nother adults will have exaggerated\nemotional responses with children\nso it's like if the child walks up to\nyou and like shows you like look i have\na pen\nlike do we are we like oh\nwhatever dude why are you showing me\nthat that's not how adults respond right\nhow adults respond is like\noh my god that's a white pen where did\nyou find the white pen so we have this\nexaggerated emotional response oh my god\ndid baby get hurt oh my poor thing let\nme pick you up let me hold you oh my\npoor darling my poor precious\nmy child oh my god are you okay\nso we have these exaggerated emotional\nresponses right\nso and why is that and that's because\nlike actually what happens is when we\nhave an exaggerated emotional response\nit actually demonstrates to the child\nwhat they're feeling so children will\nlearn oh okay like i'm feeling sad and\nthey'll see your facial expression and\nthey'll see like okay that's sadness or\nthat support or like so so what happens\nis in the world there's concordance\nbetween what the child experiences and\nhow adults respond to them\nand essentially what happens is when\nkids sort of have a lot of concordance\nbetween their internal experience and\nthe rest of the world then the world\nmakes sense\nthere are rules to the game right so\nthink about it this way if i'm a kid and\ni get hurt\nand then like instead of being supported\nif my parents start yelling at me for\ncrying\nlike what do i learn about the world i\nlearned that the world is like a\nconfusing place right where like if i\nget hurt like i should be punished for\ngetting hurt that's the sort of lessons\npeople take away\nand so the if the world is like\nconfusing\nand so what the attachment theory\nresearchers um sort of discovered is\nthat when there's like variable\nemotional responses\nbased on from caregivers so a good\nexample of this is like alcoholics\nso i'm an alcoholic parent while they're\nsober like they're gonna be loving and\ncaring but while they're drunk they're\ngonna be like angry and yell at me and\nstuff like that so then what happens is\nlike i determine that the world is a\nconfusing place where i don't know the\nrules\nand if i don't know the rules\nhow can i move about the world with\nconfidence\nright so if you think about like how do\nkids get confidence because they like\nlearn how stuff works like how does a\nchild develop confidence with walking\nit's because like walking is the same\nevery single time now imagine like\ntrying to learn how to walk if like\nevery other day or for a few hours a day\nwhen your parents are drunk suddenly\nlike gravity turns off\nright like it would be so much harder to\nwork the rules of the game have changed\nand once you don't understand the rules\nof the game like it's hard to move about\nconfidently in the world okay\nso this is kind of a quick aside to\nattachment theory but the key thing is\nthat concordance\nor emotional mirroring\ninstills confidence\nokay\nso even if we bounce to the post for a\nsecond\nright this is where like remember like\nwhen we were looking at the post what we\nsort of saw was that okay dad left the\nfamily raised doesn't show any emotions\nand i got pretty good at it right\nhomeschooled\nas well\nso what we're sort of noticing is that\nlike we're not really 100 sure right so\nwe could ask more questions to this\nperson about their upbringing but they\ndefinitely appear to have some kind of\nsetup that suggests like sub-optimal\nemotional mirroring right including an\nemotionally unavailable father who then\nafter the age of 14 like left so that's\nlike kind of it's unfortunate right but\nthis is what happened this is the truth\nof the world is that sometimes that's\nhow we grow up\nso this is kind of a quick aside that\nsort of demonstrates that concordance\nand emotional mirroring instill\nconfidence okay\nso now let's go back to this person's\nmain question which is like why can't i\ntolerate\ndisagreement\nright that's kind of the core question\nhere\nand so generally speaking i think the\nmain reason for this is a lack of faith\nin yourself\nright this kind of goes back to the ego\npoint\nbut if i um\nif i am uh you know if i'm confident in\nmyself like i can tolerate people\ndisagreeing with me if i'm egotistical\nlike if i'm insecure about my appearance\ni need lots and lots of compliments\nabout my appearance right whereas if i'm\nvery secure in my appearance like people\ncould even be insulting and like i would\ngenerally speaking be okay with that\nright\ni mean i'm not saying that you're\nimpervious to it so every time you get\nan insulting comment like it's going to\nchip away at your confidence a little\nbit generally\nbut you know your resilience your\ncapacity to tolerate negativity is going\nto be high if you're confident in\nyourself and if you can't tolerate\ndiscordance with the outside world it\ngenerally comes down to like i think a\nlack of faith in yourself\nand so this is where once you have a\nlack of faith in yourself or if you\nhaven't developed this kind of\nattachment theory emotional mirroring\nconfidence kind of stuff you don't\nreally know like\nwho you are you don't really understand\nthat deep down you're a good person\nthen what tends to happen like so when\nwe don't have an understanding of who we\ntruly are\nwhen this is a question mark when we\ndon't understand who we truly are\nwe tend to feel this is the key part\nabout ahamgar okay when we don't\nunderstand who we truly are\nwhen we lack confidence in ourselves\nwhat we tend to do is fill in the gap\nwith external things\nright so this is going to be kind of a\nrandom aside we'll go into this more\nmore detail later but\nremember in the yogic concept\nwe have a true self\nthere's a really easy version way to\nunderstand your true self just close\nyour eyes for like five minutes and just\nexperience whatever you experience\nand this is where like it's kind of\nweird but like what you're going to\ndiscover is it's like relatively neutral\nright there's not going to be like much\ngender to your experience i mean maybe\nyou're\nyou know you do have some physical\nsensations that denote some kind of\ngender but generally speaking throughout\nyour day like you know the color of your\nskin is going to be irrelevant in terms\nof your experience people may react to\nyou differently but if i'm like sitting\noutside in the sun like you know\nmy ethnicity doesn't really matter that\nmuch sure there may be like some element\nof sunburn depending on you know how\nmuch\nuh melon and my skin cells have and\nthings like that but generally speaking\nlike you know the color of my skin or\nthe color of my hair or things like that\nit won't matter in terms of like\neveryday experiences right so if i if i\ntake a sip of tea\nlike the experience of tasting the tea\ndoesn't matter whether i'm 15 30 or 45\ndoesn't matter whether whether i'm a man\nor woman it doesn't matter matter\nwhether i have long hair or short hair\nthe experience of life is like\nindependent generally speaking of\nidentity oh i'm talking about like an\nactual moment in time right so this is\nwhere you can say but what about things\nlike racism and stuff like that but yeah\nso but even then\nso if if i'm attacked by someone due to\nmy race my experience of that attack is\nactually independent of race right so if\nsomeone like you know\nphysically attacks me because of the\ncolor of my skin\nmy experience of that\nmoment of physical pain\nis actually independent of this color of\nmy skin is it being caused because of\nracism absolutely so we're not saying\nthat that's not important we're saying\nis that the actual experience of let's\nsay getting you know pushed to the\nground\nis independent of any kind of identity\nit sucks for all people right\nso this is what the yogis sort of\ndiscovered is that there's this true\nself which is actually described by neti\nneti\nand what neti neti means is a sanskrit\nphrase for not this not this so any\nattribute that you can define yourself\nwith is not actually the true self so\nand then we have the false self and this\nis the ahamgar\nthis is the ego\nand this is where we have all kinds of\nattributes right so i was valedictorian\ntop of my class\nor i'm a failure\nwhereas like at the end of the day you\nknow anyone if you're just sitting in\nthe sun or you're taking a bath like\nwhether you're a failure or a success\nwhether you're a billionaire or a popper\nlike it sort of doesn't matter right the\nexperience of water on your skin is\nstable\nso\nwhat tends to happen is the less we\nunderstand this and this is also where\nlike confidence brings us closer to the\ntrue self i think that's what it really\nis is like confidence is like an\nunderstanding of our true self\nthe more we tend to fill in the gap with\nexternal things and so then what happens\nis we begin to form an identity\naround beliefs\nokay\nso like a good example of this is like\nif you don't really know who you are who\nyou\nif you don't know who you are you\nsubstitute who you are with things that\nyou believe so you all may know like\npeople who have identities that revolve\naround like a particular thing like a\ncause or a political belief or some kind\nof like moralistic stance\nso one of the things that terrifies me\nis how immoral people who\nbelieve in a good cause can be and a\ngood example of this is like what i\nwould call the angry vegan so i have\nnothing against veganism veganism is\nactually like probably very good for the\nenvironment from biomass perspective\nit's fantastic from a health perspective\nit's really good but sometimes you'll\nencounter someone who's like an angry\nvegan right and so like being a vegan is\nnot just something that they do it's not\nlike they're just trying to like do\nsomething good for the environment and\nlike it's a choice that i make i'm cool\nwith it like it'd be awesome if more\npeople were vegan but like you do you\ni'm gonna do me that's sort of like a\nconfident vegan and then we have the\nangry vegans and the angry vegans are\nlike you know\nthey're like very very hurt and offended\nand and very aggressive and if you try\nto like engage them in discussion\nthey're gonna actually be like somewhat\nlike toxic and judgmental and things\nlike that veganism becomes a whole part\nof their identity like who they are is\nvegan it's not just a lifestyle choice\nit's like a completely transformative\nway of life and once again nothing\nagainst vegans you know i think it's\nfantastic if you decide to become a\nvegan like you do you and like good for\nyou and probably good for the\nenvironment and good for your body so\nfantastic\nthe next example of this is people who\nare very very political right so like\nwhere politics is no longer just you\nknow a choice it's like it becomes a\ncore part of our identity it becomes\npart of who we are\nand so\num\nyou know the other thing that we sort of\nsee with these people is once again once\nyou start to have like you know on a\nhumgar\nor\nuh you know ego develop around these\ncore beliefs that these have to be\nheavily advertised\nright so most of like the calm chill\nconfident vegans are not like super\naggressive in advertising on social\nmedia the people who like advertise on\nsocial media and are like being very\nvery um you know aggressive towards\npeople are the ones that have to like\nadvertise like how awesome of a vegan\nthey are and are like very judgmental\ntowards other people so we can see once\nagain that like the ego which requires\nexternal support\nis relates to our sense of identity and\nthat that sort of engages like the more\nthat people go down the egoistical route\nthe more vocal they become like you\ncould vocally advocate for things\nwithout being egotistical but that's\nalso where like you can you can sort of\nnotice the difference in terms of how\nthey engage other people in discussion\nright so if if like someone engages you\nknow a confident vegan in discussion\nlike they're not gonna make personally\nslanderous remarks right they're just\ngonna be like yeah you know i disagree\nwith you here are the reasons why so\nit's kind of like a civilized discussion\nbetween an atheist and a religious\nperson or an uncivilized discussion\nbetween like\ndie hard religious people and like die\nhard atheists right those are very\ndifferent things\nand so\nyou know what we end up seeing with the\nego is since you doubt\nyou have to demonstrate\nbecause you don't really know who you\nare you're not really confident in\nyourself\nand with the absence of those things if\nyou don't if you don't know you yourself\nor a good person\nyou have to work really really hard to\nconvince everyone else that you're a\ngood person\nand the way that you do that is by\ndemonstrating very very loudly right\nbecause the more people you can convince\nthat you are a good person the more your\ninsecurity will like feel kind of calmed\ndown because\nyou know like oh if like a thousand\npeople think i'm a good person then i\nmust be a good person because deep down\nwithin your own mind you're not sure\nyou're not truly confident right so\ninsecurity will sometimes manifest in\nthis way with trying to be like\naggressive with other people and like\nconvincing people of things\nso let's kind of go back to this\nperson's situation okay so let's try to\nrecap for a moment so this is someone\nwho gets triggered by the opinions of\nothers\nokay\nand what we kind of notice is that like\nanyone who has a different opinion from\nme or calls something i like bad can\nrisk making me feel 24 times worse so\nthat's kind of really interesting right\nso when people disagree\ni feel bad\nwhich is kind of weird\nright so i want you all to just think\nabout that for a second\nhow does a disagreement\nbecome\na judgment or personally emotional\nexperience\nright like\nit's kind of strange right so like it's\nlike it's kind of like i like pepperoni\npizza and someone else is like i like\npineapple pizza and then like i feel bad\nlike that's weird\nright so we can say like\ndepending on which camp you're in you\nknow you are an uncivilized barbarian\nfor liking that how dare you\nbut if we really kind of stop and think\nabout it there's something weird going\non here like why does someone feel\npersonally bad\nbased on an external disagreement or\nopinion that someone like another human\nbeing holds\nand this is the kind of thing where like\nthis is where ego comes in right\nso this is like where i would\nlike\nthis is where i would ask you know one\nquestion so if you're in this kind of\nsituation where you get personally like\nfeel bad or feel attacked or need\neveryone around you to kind of agree\nwith what you say\nthe key question to ask yourself\nis if someone disagrees\nwhat\ndoes\nthat\nsay\nabout\nme\nright because this is the key you'll see\nthis like the key thing is that\nan external disagreement which can be\npurely intellectual and totally fine is\nsomehow getting translated into a\npersonal judgment or somehow getting\ntranslated into some sense of identity\nright\nand so for the people who say\nwhat does that say about me it says\nnothing about me these are the people\nthat are confident\nbut if you really pay attention the\npeople who\nhave a hum cars have egos don't really\nunderstand who they are\nyou know haven't been emotionally\nmirrored early on in life\nhaven't really discovered the true\nnature of self\nthey're going to be the ones that are\nlike\nit says something about me right it says\nthat i am wrong like it's kind of\nbizarre but like you can sort of get the\nsense from this person's post that\nyou know sometimes i i get huge urges to\nlook up triggering content or scroll\nthrough a sub that is the opposite of\nwhat i love or look up bad reviews for\nshows i like and i have no idea what the\nmotive is right\nsometimes like i do it make my mental\nhealth worse it's because what you\nwe'll kind of get to that in a second\nbut what we're sort of noticing is that\nthere's like a a huge\ninternal component\nto this experience it's about like\nbeing perceived in a particular way\nand like if i can find other people to\nconfirm\nif i i look up the negative reviews then\nit confirms what i believe about myself\nwhich is that like you know i'm not my\nopinions aren't good or worthwhile the\nother place that you'll see this is\nafter a breakup\nif you're feeling really really bad\nabout yourself right what your mind will\ndo is go and seek out stimuli to confirm\nwhat it believes about you so if you're\nfeeling terrible about yourself what\nyou're going to do is go look at\npictures of your ex and then you're\ngonna see like if you see a single\npicture of your ex\nwith someone else right you don't know\nif their boyfriend girlfriend you don't\nknow if it's like platonic you're gonna\nlook at all of those pictures and each\nof those pictures is gonna be a punch to\nyour gut and you just can't help\nyourself\nbecause what your mind is looking for is\nconcordance\nright\nthat's what the mind craves the mind\nwants to make sense of the world because\nnow i can navigate it and if i feel a\nparticular way about myself and i go\nseek out confirmatory stimuli\nthen oh okay like at least i make sense\nright because what the mind hates more\nthan anything else is confusion even if\ni am a bad person at least i can\nnavigate my life as a bad person as long\nas i know i'm a bad person\nso the mind values concordance over\ngoodness\nright it it wants certainty over\npositivity that's really what it wants\nit's more important for your your\nmind to be consistent than it is for it\nto be correct\nthere are a couple of other questions\nthat you can ask yourself which is like\nhow do i feel about myself\nright and last question is am i a good\nperson so this is a yes or no question\nso as you start to ask some of these\nquestions\nwhat you'll notice is like you're\nstarting to understand okay where am i\non this axis of like true self versus\nfalse self right am i confident do i\nreally know who i am because a lot of\ntimes when i have conversations with\npeople who are sort of in this kind of\nscenario i'm making a lot of assumptions\nhere\nbut like you know i i if this was\nsomeone that i was interviewing on\nstream i'd ask them like do you how do\nyou feel about yourself do you think\nyou're a good person and and like\nthe answers that i usually get are like\ni have no idea like how the how the hell\nare you supposed to even know whether\nyou're a good person like what does that\neven mean right it's so foreign it's\nlike i guess and sometimes what they'll\nsay is like external things like people\ntell me i'm a good person\nright like those or like they'll say\nlike i'm not entirely sure like\ni don't know like you know so there's\njust a lot of confusion here where\npeople don't really understand who they\nare\nin the absence of understanding who you\nare you fill it in with ego right you\nfill it in with external things because\nyour mind needs some way to navigate the\nworld and if it doesn't have a good\nunderstanding of who you are internally\nit's going to pick stuff from the\noutside and fill in that vacuum\nso the next uh\nkind of question to ask is like okay so\nif you're in this situation\nwhat do dr k\nso the first thing that i want to\nacknowledge is that if you're actually\nhaving panic attacks\nright that's absolutely a reason to go\nsee a licensed mental health\nprofessional\nlike because i know it sounds like you\nfigured out the source of your panic\nattacks as you know through limiting\ntwitter but if this is a tried and true\npanic attack like\nyou know\nyou may want to get that checked out\nright so if you're experiencing\nimpairments\nor you're concerned about possible\nimpairments then you should absolutely\ngo see a licensed professional\nokay so you may want to you know\nsee a therapist\nand if you're like is it a true panic\nattack or not a true panic attack i\ndon't know and that's like like you're\nnot supposed to know right that's the\njob of a therapist so one of the things\nthat you know clinicians do is like they\nhave to evaluate you so\nanother thing that i see is that a lot\nof people think like okay how do i know\nif i need help like how do i know if\nit's bad enough to need treatment\nwhereas that's the wrong question\nbecause you're not the one who's going\nto make that evaluation right it's\nactually like half the job of a\nclinician is diagnosis\nso if you're concerned at all or you're\nlike it's a question mark for you then\nyou should absolutely go see someone\nnext thing to think a little bit about\njust a reminder right is we talked about\nattachment theory\nand even if you don't have a um\neven if you don't have a panic disorder\nright which it's important for the\ntherapist to sort of figure out or the\nclinician to figure out\nthere's also like other things going on\nhere like attachment theory which like\nattachment theory is what most\ntherapists are trained in like basically\nat least in the us as far as i know like\neveryone learns some attachment theory\nbecause it's so central right so if you\ngo see like a child and adolescent\npsychiatrist for example they're more\nlikely to have advanced training and\nattachment theory and things like that\nbut there's like a lot of benefit from\nyou know working with someone who really\nunderstands attachment theory\nand then the next thing is that\nunfortunately\nthere's no substitute\nthat's\nterrible handwriting\nfor\na good relationship\nso even if we sort of think a little bit\nabout what's going on\nfor people in this situation like this\nperson is looking for external\nconcordance right so it's almost like as\na kid\nwe need concordance\nthis is how we get emotional mirroring\nand develop confidence\nand then as an adult\nif we didn't have this\nright that's still what we're looking\nfor right so now we understand like okay\nwhy we're blocking people on twitter\nneed concordance right you're still\nlooking for someone to like\nhelp you understand and like meet you\nwhere you're at so we start to shape our\nexternal environment looking for\nconcordance in the worst cases sometimes\nwhat we'll do is enter like you know\necho chamber communities where like\nsince we don't have the confidence in\nour beliefs to tolerate discussion and\ndiffering opinions what we'll do is just\njoin people\nwho like believe what we believe right\nbecause then we're getting that\nemotional uh that concordance we're\ngetting sort of emotional mirroring from\nthese other people like if i believe you\nknow that\ncovet 19 is a is a hoax or a conspiracy\nor something like that which i don't\nright so covet is not a hoax\nplease get vaccinated\nbut if i believe that sort of thing and\nlike i feel attacked and hurt and bad\nwhen people disagree with me then what\ni'm gonna do is gravitate towards like\npeople who believe the same things i do\nand then through finding that emotional\nmirroring and that concordance it sort\nof assuages some of this like internal\nlack of confidence kind of stuff so in a\nweird way like even as adults we're\ntrying to do what we didn't get to do in\nchildren and this is where if you look\nat broadly like you know theories of\nchild development\nwhat tends to happen is like some people\nget stuck right so you're supposed to do\nthis at one year you're supposed to do\nthis at two years five years 10 years 15\nyears 20 and 25. and sometimes you'll\nmeet someone who's like developmentally\n15\neven though they're 25 years old and\nthat's not really their fault it's just\nlike they haven't learned how to do that\nthing yet right so sometimes you'll\nyou'll meet adults who throw temper\ntantrums like a five-year-old and like\nwhy do they do that it's because they\nnever learned like how to you know grow\npast that point so sometimes you'll have\npeople who are developmentally like\nbehind where they should be and this is\nnot it's not like just they're globally\ndevelopmentally behind i mean there is a\ndiagnosis for that called global\ndevelopmental delay but\ngenerally speaking most human beings\nlike none of us are you know exactly at\n20. some of us will be like\ndevelopmentally advanced and be like at\n25 and be precocious in some ways we'll\nbe like a little bit developmentally\nlike a little bit stunning right like so\nlike intellectually mathemate-wise like\ni'm a 20-year-old who's like my reading\nlevel is like at a 25-year-old's level\nlike emotionally i'm kind of like at a\n15-year-old right it was not totally\nnormal\nso\nyou know unfortunately\nthe truth is that you know if you\nif what you were missing early in life\nis a good relationship like sometimes\nthere's just no good substitute for a\ngood relationship and i've sort of seen\nthis a lot where if you look at people\nwho have had like on like very toxic\nupbringings and stuff like that\nstrong emotional support from either\nfriends or like aunts or uncles or even\na romantic relationship can can really\nhelp those people like learn how to be\nlike emotionally normal right sort of\ncatch up emotionally\nso it's kind of unfortunate but you know\nif you really want to talk about on the\ngrand scope of things what can you do\nabout it like i think forming healthy\nrelationships is a huge part of like how\nyou get out of this right because when\nyou when\nlet's kind of tunnel down into why is\nthis so in a healthy relationship\nyou're going to have disagreements\nyou're going to make mistakes\nand it is so healing\nit is so much positivity and xp in terms\nof emotional development when you make a\nmistake and someone says you made a\nmistake i am acknowledging the mistake\nbut\nyou're still\na\ngood\nperson\nhuge\nhuge\nright when someone says yeah you kind of\nscrewed up and i still like you\nand i still care for you and you're\nstill a good person and i forgive you\nbecause what happens until you have that\nis that your sense of value\nis determined by mistakes\nor successes\nright and this is the there's a\nvideo in dr k's guide called conditional\nlove\nwhich is like when the love that you\nwere shown is like dependent on the\nvalue as a human being\nthat you were dem the way people\ndemonstrated value or your value as a\nhuman being was determined\nby like whether you made mistakes or you\nwere successful very very common\nand so then once you once your value is\nnot determined by something intrinsic or\nthe true self but is determined by\nperformance\nthen you're going to be squarely\ngrounded in in the false self you're\ngoing to have a big ego and you're going\nto lack confidence\nright and then you're going to need to\nprove how smart you are to everyone all\nthe time how successful you are to\neveryone all the time the last thing\nthat i'd recommend is meditation\nso there are some meditations about sort\nof discovering this true self right so\nlike let me just think about how to\nshare kind of a simple\nmeditative practice so like like this is\na practice we haven't done in a while so\nwe'll just demonstrate it\nso what i encourage you to do is is you\nknow go grab a drink or you know if you\nhave one in front of you just like pick\nit up\nso we're gonna do something called a tea\ndrinking exercise okay so you can do\nthis with any piece of food or beverage\nor whatever and so what we're going to\ndo in this practice it's super simple\nis like we're going to just notice\nwho is the person like doing the\ndrinking\nright so think about like who you are if\nsomeone were to ask you like who are you\nwhat would you answer would you probably\nsay something about your profession or\nyour gender your ethnicity or your name\nright so we can even just pick something\nas simple as a name\nand as we take a sip of tea we're just\ngonna ask ourselves like who is doing\nthe drinking like\nlike is this person\nthe name that you describe yourself as\nlike is that the person doing the\ndrinking and in a sense like sort of\nyeah obviously right because i'm me\nbut then what i want you to imagine for\na moment\nis imagine that an alien being\ncould observe your consciousness or\ncould implant your your body and\nexperience exactly what you experience\nfor just 60 seconds of sipping tea\nhow would they determine\nyour name from this experience how would\nthey figure out because if this is truly\nwho you are and that's a part of this\nexperience\nthen an external observer should be able\nto find your name through drinking tea\nright and so like now we're going to try\nso just kind of think a little bit\njust observe\nwho is the person who's drinking the tea\nright so notice the flavor\nthe temperature\neven the scent\nthe feeling of it as it goes down into\nyour throat\nthe aftertaste\nand now ask yourself like who is doing\nthis drinking\nis this a man or a woman\nhow would you know if this was all you\nexperienced in life\nhow would you know\nthat this is a man or a woman or someone\nwho's non-binary\nright for for your ethnicity how would\nyou know that this person\nis\nof a particular ethnicity\nright and as you tunnel down into the\nexperience you'll start to realize that\nall of these attributes whether you're\nrich or you're poor\nor you're you have a level 39 character\nin lost ark or a level 15 character in\nlost ark whether you're a man or a woman\nall of these attributes whether you're a\nfather or a son\nnone of those are actually relevant in\nthis moment\nright because in that experience of that\nmoment like that's all the external\nworld it has nothing to do with the\ninternal experience\nand then the question kind of becomes\nwell then like where do we get these\nidentities well we get them from the\noutside world and then what the yogis\nessentially did is they sort of noticed\noh that's kind of interesting because\nwhen i'm drinking tea i'm a no one\ni'm netting\nand then they were like well what\nhappens the moment after i drink tea\neven now as i'm speaking to you\nright as you're listening to this\nare you a man or a woman\nneither\nare you rich or you are you poor neither\nif this is all you have this is the only\nexperience of life you have is this one\nslice of consciousness\nnone of those things are relevant and\nthen what the yogis sort of figured out\nand this is the really hard part so you\ncan do this if you want to it's\nchallenging okay\nis that what is life\nlife is a collection\nof moments\nthat's all it is\nso i'm neti neti here\ni'm neti neti here\nand then the experience of life is\nthat's it\nright it cannot be described it cannot\nlike if you just think about the\nexperience of t\nlike we can use words to describe it but\ni can i can use as many words as i want\nto but there's no way that you're going\nto understand the experience of t until\nyou try it yourself right\nand so if you're stuck in this kind of\nsituation of like\nbeing very very concerned about\ndisagreeing with other people feeling\nbad as a person when other people\ndisagree with you\nyou can absolutely start by you know\nexternally limiting stuff which is very\nhealthy don't get me wrong right so\nlimiting toxicity in your life is really\ngood\nif twitter is sending you into panic\nattacks stay the hell off of twitter\nbut the next thing to understand is that\nremember that we can try to limit our\nexternal environment but there's an\ninternal component as well\nand generally speaking if you want to\nlive a healthy life like you should\nlimit this external stuff and you should\nbecome resilient what do i mean by\nresilience it's the ability to tolerate\ndiscordance\nright\nand generally speaking resilience comes\nfrom confidence where does confidence\ncome from well in attachment theory it\ncomes from emotional mirroring\nin in the yogic perspective it comes\nfrom a lack of ego that ego and\nconfidence are two ends of the spectrum\nso as we sort of start to think a little\nbit about okay what is the ego what is\nthe ahamkar it's all of the attributes\nabout your life that are not truly you\nso it's anything that you can put on a\nresume and the more the less we\nunderstand who we are the more we fill\nup our identity with the attributes from\nthe resume because we got to put\nsomething in there right and this is how\nyou end up with people who are like very\nvery pro-moral cause right these are\nlike crusaders they're like on a crusade\nfor goodness and they're like\njust leaving a wreckage in their wake\nright these are people that are you know\ncampaigning for something that they very\nstrongly believe in and if you like talk\nto them they're like [ __ ]\nlike as human beings they're just\n[ __ ] but it's okay for them because\nthey're doing something externally\nthat's good for the world right\nand so if you're kind of getting\ntriggered by the opinion of others when\nwhen you sort of when you when people\ndisagree with you if you start to feel\nbad notice that that's like that's an\nego component right like you're\ninjecting your identity or your sense of\nself-worth into a disagreement with\nanother human being which is like humans\nare allowed to disagree pineapple and\npizza yay like that says nothing about\nyou as a person\nright but\ndon't we love to think the opposite\nand lastly\nwhen we think a little bit about what to\ndo about it so the first is that if\nyou're actually having like panic\nattacks or you're concerned that there's\nsomething could be going on that's\nimpairing your function strongly\nrecommend you go see a therapist\nsecond thing to understand and i know\nthis isn't in everyone's control but at\nthe end of the day if you like didn't\ngrow up with a strong father figure who\nlike taught you these sorts of things\nthat like substituting that replacing\nthat relationship in some way or\nreplacing with other kinds of\nrelationships are really good\nlike that it's just you can't ignore\nthat as a solution we're not saying it's\nin your control we're not saying it's\neasy but i would be remiss to say that\nlike if you've had bad relationships in\nthe past one way to fix yourself as a\nperson is to have good relationships\nlike that's a huge part of it right\nsomeone who understands that you can\nmake mistakes and still says\nthey value as a person\nand the last thing is that you can do\nspiritual stuff right there's actually\nway more that you can do but today you\nknow i'm going to talk about meditation\nbecause this is where this is the\nsystematic process of discovering the\ntrue self right so the people were like\noh by the way here's how you find it\nquestions\nthat ended up being\nway longer than i thought it was going\nto be\nbut\nthat's dr k for you\ncan i recap i just finished the\nrecap we'll get to some of this stuff in\nthe next one though don't worry\nokay can i repeat it sure\nso we just talked about a case\nwhere someone was sort of saying\nyou know\nwhen people disagree with me like i feel\nreally bad so it got to the point where\nwhen i saw someone making a comment on\ntwitter that disagrees with my point of\nview it would throw me into a panic\nattack\nso what i did is started blocking people\non twitter\nand then i ended up blocking 30k people\nand then i got off of twitter entirely\nand that helped some but i still find\nmyself\nfeeling really bad when people disagree\nwith me so what's going on there and\nwhat do i do about it\nso in summary\nwe have a sense of like confidence on\nthe inside and the more confident we are\nthe closer we are to our true self\nthe more confident we are and the more\nconfident we are the more we can\ntolerate discordance with the outside\nworld\nthe less confident we are the more\negotistical we are and confidence and\nego are on opposite ends of the spectrum\nthe more i need the world to get in line\nwith like what i believe right so if i'm\negotistical\nand i'm insecure about my appearance i\nneed everyone to compliment my\nappearance and if someone says i'm ugly\ni'm gonna lash out at them right\nand so what ends up happening is like\nthe reason that these disagreements\ncause you personal pain is because your\nidentity is caught up in like some of\nthese non-identity like\nnon-self-related things so if someone\ndisagrees with you that\nmakes you feel like you're a bad person\nor incompetent in some way and so\nsuddenly what happens is like an\nexternal degree disagreement\nbecomes\na indictment of who you are as a person\nright so if i if i like lost art then\ni'm a bad person but if you play league\nof legends you're a bad person right you\nsee this with dota and league a lot\nwhere dota noobs think that everyone who\nplays lala's noob everyone who plays lol\nthinks that dota people are noobs like\nwe make determinations about people\nbased on their preferences\nand so that all has to do with like our\nour confidence right so as we start to\nlike\nas you start to tunnel down into that a\ncouple of questions to ask or you know\nif i feel bad like what does this say\nabout me as a person\nif someone disagrees with me sorry if\nsomeone disagrees with me\nwhat does that say about me as a person\nlike and it's kind of weird because\ntechnically it does it doesn't say\nanything but that's not how your mind\nthinks right your mind feels incompetent\nif someone disagrees with you it's like\nyou're an idiot that's what your mind is\ngoing to be telling you that's why you\nfeel bad\nso how do you fix that kind of thing\nwell the first thing is to understand\nthat that you know if you are getting\npanic attacks and things like that like\ngo see a professional\nsecond thing is to understand that a lot\nof this comes from a lack of of like\nhealthy relationships growing up and so\nhealthy relationships is one way to fix\nit now i understand that's kind of\ndifficult for some people because you\ncan't fix that on your own but the truth\nof the matter is that sometimes in life\nlike you can't fix everything on your\nown right it doesn't mean that there\naren't things that you can do internally\nbut i've seen a lot of value or yield\nfrom having healthy relationships to\nrepair things that unhealthy\nrelationships have damaged\nright so if you've been in an abusive\nromantic relationship being in a loving\nromantic relationship is a great way to\nfix a lot of that crap probably the most\nefficient way to be honest\nthe last thing is that you can do\npersonally introspective stuff so today\nwe talked about meditation but there are\nall kinds of other things you can do\nright you can read about stoic\nphilosophy you can go for long hikes you\ncan climb to the top of a mountain those\nare all things that i in a weird way\nconsider spiritual activities not to say\nthat they're spiritual by definition but\nthey get a lot of the benefits that uh\nsystematic spiritual practice will get\nso if you're not into spirituality\nthat's fine go and explore right like go\nand test yourself go explore the world\ngo you know try to climb a mountain and\nlike struggle to get to the top and get\nto the top and feel amazing about\nyourself those are all ways to build\nconfidence\nbut the meditation we talked about was\nabout the nature of self\nright and to like drink tea for a moment\nand um\nthink a little bit about you know what\nis it that who is doing the drinking\nright like who like is this person a man\na woman non-binary is it you know\nsomeone is old young rich poor and then\nin that moment of experience it's\nactually none right it's just someone\ndrink a d\nand the more that you pay attention to\nyour life like on a global scale moment\nto moment you'll realize that's all you\nare\njust someone drinking tea now i'm\nsomeone playing lost art now i'm someone\nwho's streaming\nyou know i'm someone who has their hands\nup like i can just feel my hands up like\nthat's what i am that's all i am in that\nmoment right so i'm not smart or dumb\ni'm not rich or poor i'm not good or bad\ni'm not a cult leader or a messiah you\nknow like i'm none of those things right\ni'm just me\nso i hope that's a good summary\nyou"
