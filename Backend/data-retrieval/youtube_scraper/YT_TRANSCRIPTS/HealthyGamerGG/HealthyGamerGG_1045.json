    "transcript": "so let's take a look\ncan you really change who you are\nokay\ni've been doing a lot of introspection\nthis year and dr k really helped kick\nstart that for me and i feel like i'm\nfinally waking up to who i have been\ni feel like i've been dishonest with\neveryone in my life because i've always\nplayed whatever character i think best\nfits the situation instead of being my\nauthentic self\neven with respect to my own self image i\nthought of myself as a really good\nperson yet i've treated women with no\nrespect and ruined all the relationships\ni've been in by never telling them how i\nreally feel about things\ni guess what i want to know is if i do\nkeep working hard to better myself in\nthese fundamental ways how do i get over\nthe disgust i feel towards myself i feel\nlike i want to move to a new town by\nmyself and just stay by myself like a\ntime chamber until i feel ready to come\nout\nmaybe time is all that's needed i'm just\nfeeling really down tonight i love you\nguys thank you\nso this unfortunately is a really common\nproblem right so\nsometimes we're on a journey of\nself-growth\nand as we start to introspect as we\nstart to dig into who we are as we start\nto think critically about ourselves\nwhat we find is something that's not\nvery pleasant right\nwe start to realize okay now that i'm\nreally looking at myself for like the\nfirst time\ni'm realizing like holy crap i've been\nquite dishonest\nand even though like on in some ways\nlike i think of myself as a good person\nwhat i realize is that i haven't been\nvery authentic i've treated people with\ndisrespect i've messed up relationships\nand sometimes we also feel like\ndisgusted by ourselves right we're like\nholy crap i had no idea that this it's\nactually like this is bad right like i\nhow do i overcome that\nhow do i like\novercome the disgust\nand then i can understand this as well\nbecause sometimes what we want to do is\nlike\nwe want to go into a cocoon right we\nwant to disappear we want to move across\ncountry and like we realize that we're\nso screwed up that we need to like go\nsomewhere to a different location\nenter this hibernation chamber of\nself-work and come out on the other side\nlike a new human being this is something\ni understand all too well because it's\nexactly why i went to india i was like\nman i suck at life\ni need to like go and transform myself\ninto a good human being and i even went\nlike halfway across the world\nor across the world\nand like went to a new place and studied\nwith monks and in my journey that was my\ntime chamber so it's something i really\nunderstand so that's something that\nhappens a lot right as we start to walk\nthe journey of self-growth we discover\nthings that are kind of sus\nand as we discover those things we\nreally want to fix them and we can feel\nlike you know disgusted with ourselves\nso how what do we do about this okay\nso can you really change who you are\nit's a great question\nso\nthat's where i'm going to start with\nyou know a couple of\nsimple points\nso when we say like can you change who\nyou are the first question is like who\nare you right how do you determine like\nwho you are\nso sure we talked a little bit about the\ntrue self and stuff like that but we'll\nwe'll take a step back from that for a\nsecond\nso like you know if you're disgusted\nwith yourself and you like want to be a\ngood person right because you sometimes\nused to think of yourself as a good\nperson then you discovered all this crap\nthat you're doing which you never\nrealized does that make you a bad person\nso i think the first question to ask\nyourself is like what makes a good\nperson and what makes a bad person\nright so like just think about that\nbecause if your goal is to be a good\nperson and we want to change who i am\nright that's the goal let's start by\ndefining like what makes a good person\nit's kind of interesting so this is why\na lot of people struggle to become good\npeople because if you start to ask like\nwhat makes a good person like\ni don't know\nright so some people may say okay like\nwhat makes a good person is like doing\ngood things so that's kind of\ninteresting right so it's like so if i\ndo good things does that make me a good\nperson\nnot really right because we sort of say\nthat good people can do bad things and\nbad people can do good things so we\nstill sort of have this idea of a good\nperson and a bad person\nso if we kind of look at it a little bit\nmore we can say well on balance if i you\nknow\nhelp\nmore than i hurt then i'm a good person\nwhich i still don't know if i entirely\nagree with that it sort of makes sense\nso let's say i'm a surgeon and i've you\nknow saved 99 people's lives and i\nyou know have i'm drunk driving one day\nand there's a tragic accident and you\nknow\nthe people i run into another car and\nsomeone passes away\nmy good person then like because i've\nsaved 99 people's lives and maybe i've\ntaken two or three and\ndoes that make me a good person or a bad\nperson\nso the first thing to kind of like so as\nyou kind of dig into this you may come\nup with your own answers sort of i i\nlean heavily on once again eastern\nperspectives which i'm about to share\nthis is the way that i see it okay this\nis the model that i use\nso the first is that as we sort of\ntalked about already like there's a true\nself and there's a false self and that\npeople are neither good nor bad you just\nare\nright there's like you just are that\nfundamentally human beings all have\nintrinsic value\nit's not like based on your actions or\nanything like that like all human beings\nhave some sense of value\nin the eastern perspective there's also\nthis idea of the true self right which\nis\nwhich is like not anything that can be\ndescribed who you truly are is not good\nor bad is not smart or dumb is not rich\nor poor is not professionally successful\nor professionally unsuccessful is not\nlevel 60 in lost ark not level 20 and\nlost earthquake whatever\nso\nwe can fill it up with ego and ego can\nassign us to be good or bad but at the\ncore of the day like the humanness\nwithin you is sort of like fixed and\nneutral and generally speaking positive\nokay\nso then the question becomes well what\nabout actions\nright so can you really change who you\nare and what about actions this is where\ni i like the theory of karma so the\ntheory of karma sort of says that you\nknow\nyou could take actions and actions have\nconsequences and we as human beings tend\nto assign value to actions so there's\nanother really interesting thing about\nthe theory of karma is that a lot of\npeople think that like so we're going to\ntalk about garma for a second\nso a lot of people think that like good\nkarmas cancel out bad karmas right so\ni'm going to tell you all a quick joke\nso three mathematicians go to an archery\nrange\nand so the first one shoots an arrow\nright and it goes 10 feet to the left of\nthe target it's like damn it\nand the second one\nshoots an arrow it goes 10 feet to the\nright of the target and the third one\njumps up and says we hit it\nright that's what we think of we think\nof like life is a balance but the truth\nis that like averaging stuff doesn't\nisn't actually how life works\nso in the case of the surgeon so you can\ndo 99 good deeds and it doesn't allow\nyou to like get away with one bad deed\nright each thing has its own consequence\nthe other way to think about it is that\nyou know if i throw a ball up in the air\nlike that ball is going to come down\nif i throw a ball down towards the floor\nand it bounces off the floor it's going\nto come up\nit's not like throwing one ball up in\nthe air and throwing the other ball down\nat the air at the same time that both\nballs stay the same right each action\nthat we take has its own consequences\nand so you can make a determination and\nyou can decide for yourself and you can\nsay okay what's the ratio of like good\nactions to bad actions that makes you a\ngood person i actually don't think that\nthat exists i think it's apples and\noranges that you can't be a good person\nright the only things that you can do\nyou can do good deeds and you can do bad\ndeeds but you as a person are like\nrelatively fixed now we can absolutely\nfrom a practical societal perspective\nsay that you know like this is a bad\nperson but this is something that like\ni've come to understand a lot you know\nworking in addiction psychiatry is that\noftentimes\nwhen someone is addicted to a substance\nthey feel like bad people and they're\ntold by their family members that\nthey're bad people and sort of because\nthey've done a lot of bad crap right\nlike they've like hit people while drunk\ndriving they've like you know ruined\nmarriages they've been toxic to their\nchildren and so they naturally feel\nreally bad about themselves and are\nthose bad actions absolutely should you\ntake responsibility and accountability\nfor your actions absolutely\nand helping that person get better\nhelping that person start to be in a\nplace where they can make the world a\nbetter place\nstarts by some amount of like\nfundamental understanding that you are\nneither a good person or a bad person\nhave you done bad things absolutely\nshould you pay for those absolutely and\nthat doesn't doom you to being a bad\nperson right ultimately\nif you're saying that bad actions make\nyou a bad person\nthen by definition you should be able to\ndo good actions to make you a good\nperson i don't really buy into that\nright because i'm saying that who you\nare and what you do are independent\npractically we make make some judgments\nin the real world right which is okay\nbut the core of the thing if you're\nasking can you really change like i\ndon't in a sense i don't think so\nwhat you can change is your actions\nbut as a human being you can't change\nnow the caveat there is that i probably\ndon't agree with any kind of negative\njudgment that you have about yourself\nright because you are just what you are\nyou are neither good nor bad but you can\nabsolutely change your actions\nso the next thing that i kind of want to\npoint out\nis so actually one more point here which\nis that once we make an identity\ndetermination about ourselves\nthat influences\nwhat we believe we're capable of right\nso if i view myself as a loser\ni won't actually act in a way that\nimproves my life\nso like if i if i'm a loser i'm not\ngoing to apply for a promotion because\ni'm a loser\nif i'm attracted to someone i'm not\ngoing to ask them out because i'm a\nloser so what happens is the sense of\nidentity about i'm a bad person starts\nto shape our life and become a\nself-fulfilling prophecy so that's why\nlike i really like the yogic perspective\nbecause i it seems like it's helped a\nton of people because like you are\nneither good nor bad you are just you\nit's your actions that can be good or\nbad and so if you want to transform your\nlife don't worry about transforming your\nidentity just transform your actions\nright because that's like ultimately\nwhat's important like you can be a bad\nperson even if you believe you're a bad\nperson if you're a surgeon who saves 99\nlives\nand then you have a drunk driving\naccident and then you spend you spend\nsome time in jail or whatever whatever\nthese is the appropriate\naccountability\nthen you get out of jail and you\ndedicate your life to\nsaving a thousand more people i think\nthat's fantastic is it unfortunate that\nyou had that negative karma absolutely\nshould you take responsibility for it\nabsolutely and that one event does not\ndetermine anything about the rest of\nyour life\nright you can choose to act in a\npositive way after that point\nso now\nthis person has more than than just this\nquestion right so can you really change\ni think in a sense no because you are\nwhat you are but what you if you think\nwhat you are is bad then i disagree it's\nkind of weird answer okay\nbut there's like a subtle point here\nso\ni guess what i want to know is if i keep\nworking hard on myself in these\nfundamental ways how do i get over the\ndisgust i feel towards myself\nthis is tricky\nvery very tricky\nso\nyou can't get over the disgust you feel\ntowards yourself\nkind of a weird thing to say right so i\nwant you all to think about this for a\nsecond really pay attention\nthe desire\nwhere does the desire to get over the\ndisgust you have within yourself come\nfrom\ndo y'all understand that question\nright so\ni\nokay\ni\nwant\nto\nget\nover\nmy\nself\ndisgust\nright\nwhat is the energy\nthat is driving this goal\nit is disgust\nright i'm disgusted with myself that's\nwhy i need to get over it the desire to\nget over your own disgust\nis coming from disgust\nyou all see that\nit's crazy it's like this part of me is\nrevolting so i need to get rid of it\nwhich the part of you that thinks that\nthat's revolting is in and of itself\nrevolted by it so you can't get over it\nin fact this is why people get stuck\nright because anyone who wants to change\nthat like listen is language how do i\nchange who i am\ndo you guys get that this question can\nonly be asked if you have a fundamental\ndisgust for yourself\nwhy do you need to change well because\ni'm a sticky ugly person on the inside\nso even as you\ntry to improve what you're actually\ndoing is reinforcing that disgust\ndo you all get that\nlike you can't want to change the the\nmore you want to change the more you\ndon't accept yourself the more disgusted\nyou are with yourself right it's kind of\nreally wild but this energy so\naccomplishing this goal and this is why\npeople get stuck\nright this is why they get stuck because\nthe more that you do this\nthe more that you're actually giving in\nto that sense of disgust you're feeding\nit\nright it's interesting so be careful\nabout that so the question is okay like\nwhat do you do about it right so do we\nget over it no but are we gonna leave it\nthere absolutely not\nright so we can we can move forward but\nwe don't wanna we don't want to get over\nit this is where\nwe need to accept it\nthe solution is not\ngetting over right because getting over\nimplies\ni\nam bad and i need to transform into i am\ngood this is\ngood\nthis is change\nwho\ni\nam this is the goal\noh whoop sorry\noh my god sorry about that okay so\ni want to get over my self-disgust\nright this is coming from disgust\nthis is the key thing\nso the solution\nis acceptance\nand so i am bad\ni'm good\nthis is what you want to accomplish\nright\nso you want to change who i am\nbut this over here is so this process is\na lack of acceptance do you all see that\nit's not accepting this at all in fact\nit's doing the exact opposite it's doing\nit's saying that i'm disgusted with\nmyself i need to change\ni don't want to accept myself at all\nlike this needs to be different so\ninterestingly enough and even if we do\nthat what we're going to be doing the\nmore that we try to overcome our disgust\nthe more that we're feeding and giving\ninto\nour lack of acceptance of ourself\nokay\nso the question is how do you accept\nwhat does that look like so this is\nwhere you can say\nyou can say to yourself you know\ni thought of myself as a really good\nperson yet i've treated women with no\nrespect and ruined all relationships\nokay so that's like that's what this\nperson believes so what do you say\nwell what you say is like yeah so i've\nmade a lot of mistakes right\ni used to think of myself as a good\nperson\ni've realized that i've done a lot of\nbad things i'm not really sure if i'm a\ngood person or a bad person and that's\nokay i'm working on it\nright so i may have screwed up a lot of\nthings i may have treated people with\ndisrespect but today\ni can do better\ni can treat people differently and it\ncomes down to karma right it comes down\nto actions i can change the actions that\ni take i have no idea on the cosmic\nsense whether i'm a good person or a bad\nperson\ni certainly don't judge that about\nmyself\ni don't know who has the capacity to\njudge whether i'm a good person or a bad\nperson\nbut\nso be it this is like my journey i'm not\nperfect i may even be a bad person okay\nbut today\ni can try to do different\ni can try to act differently\nright i can like choose to treat women\nwith respect i can choose to try to be\nnicer to other people i can make choices\nto ch like not just to change the person\nthat i am but like i can change what i\ndo on a day-to-day basis even if i'm a\nbad person so oddly enough like that's\nwhat acceptance looks like\nit's acknowledging okay this is okay\nit's true it's fine\nright so be it would it be better if\nthings were different sure\nabsolutely\nbut it is what it is\nright so maybe i'm not a good person i\nused to think of myself as a really good\nperson now i'm not so sure so be it\ni'm not going to try to change that i'm\njust today i'm going to just act i'm\ngoing to act in a better way\nso if even if i'm a bad person can a bad\nperson do good things absolutely can a\ngood person do bad things absolutely\nright so it comes down to action it\ncomes down to like accepting that maybe\nyou\nhave some parts of yourself that are not\ngood\nyou and everyone else\nright and if you try to overcome your\ndisgust with yourself that in and of\nitself is being fueled by your disgust\nso you're just gonna feed the problem\nand this is exactly why it's so hard to\nchange yourself\nright because the way that you change\nyourself ironically is not through\ntrying to change yourself\nit's through accepting yourself\nthat's where change begins\nso you see this like in\nmind-blowing simplicity with like\nalcoholics anonymous how do you get\nsober by admitting you're an alcoholic\nright you'll start with like and i'm not\n100 you know there's a lot of things\nthat i'm not\nsuper happy with in terms of a and how\nthey run but if you look at it it's a\nvery effective intervention for a ton of\npeople\ni don't agree with 100 of their\nphilosophy\nbut like they got a couple of really\nimportant things right and that's\nparadoxically\nyou know the way that you become sober\nis by accepting that you're an alcoholic\nright and they start every single\nstatement anytime someone gets up there\nand speaks it's hi my name is all oak\ni'm an alcoholic\nand they own it\nright and once you own it once you're\nlike you're not saying i'm no longer an\nalcoholic\nno one says that right it's a lifelong\nthing for them\nand it's it's through that power of\nacceptance that they actually gain the\nfortitude and strength to gain sobriety\nand so in a bizarre way like own it like\nif you're not a great person so be it\nyou don't have to beat yourself up over\nit you can accept it and you can change\nso this is the other thing about\nacceptance is a lot of people think that\nacceptance means giving up oh i screwed\nup no\nit doesn't mean giving up in fact it\nmeans the opposite means accepting where\nyou are and wanting to move forward\nso if i like fail a test there are two\nways i can accept that right one is i\ncan accept it and throw my hands up and\nthe other way is i could okay i failed\nthe test\ni need to study harder\nright so acceptance doesn't mean\nstopping any kind of forward momentum in\nfact in in my life most of the forward\nprogress i made is through acceptance of\nmy faults\nand saying like i can take action right\ni can take positive karma i can work on\nthis\nso don't get over your disgust just\naccept it say there's a part of myself\nthat is really really disgusted with my\nactions\nthat's really interesting like that is\nhurtful right like there's a part of\nmyself that's like very very upset with\nme\nthat loathes who i am\nbut it doesn't have to be the whole you\nit's not the whole you by the way\nright you can accept that you can say\nokay so like i'm gonna try to do better\nso i don't know if i'm a good person i\ndon't know if i'm a bad person but on\nthis particular day i can take an action\nthat is in the right direction\nlast thing to talk about\nis\nthe time capsule\nright so sometimes\nwhen we're in this situation where we're\ndisgusted with ourselves we just want to\nretreat from the world\ngo to a place enter a cocoon and come\nout a fixed human being\nand this is where i like i said it's\nsomething that i understand all too well\nbecause it's exactly what i did when i\nfirst went to india\nright like it's like oh i'm going to go\nto this thing i'm going to transform\nmyself and then i'm going to come back\nto the world\nbecause we view transformation of the\nself as like separate from the rest of\nour lives\nwhereas the big lesson i learned in\nindia is like i don't have to be in\nindia to become a monk in fact\nrunning away to india was just running\naway from my problems in a subtle way\nfor my ego to like outperform people who\nare out performing me\nso when someone you know when my friends\nand stuff like got 4.0 gpas and got into\nmedical school and i failed to get into\nmedical school for the second time in a\nrow\ni was like okay well let me go become a\nmonk because then\ni i'm above all of this rat race all\nthese doctors who are chasing money i'm\nbetter than all of them i'm not\nmaterialistic et cetera et cetera it's\nall running away from my problems and\nthen i realized\nthrough thankfully a lot of brilliant\nteachers and and some you know effort on\nmy own part\nthat\ni'm going to take my problems with me\nwherever i go\nthey're my problems\nrunning away to india like i'm going to\ntake them with me so you can move to a\nnew town but like your sense of disgust\nwell\nwhere is it coming from like where does\nit live it lives up here it's gonna come\nwith you\nright so there are absolutely reasons to\nmove\nfor sure\nlike that can be very important like by\nall means move so if your toxicity is\ncoming from your external environment\nright by all means move even getting a\nfresh start like mentally can be a good\nidea i'm not saying don't don't move\njust be prepared right i don't think\nthat\npersonal growth can be done you can work\non it like very intentionally right you\ncan go to a monastery for a few months\nby all means like go for it's wonderful\nexperience\nbut like don't assume that just moving\nsomewhere and like working on yourself\nis like separate from the rest of your\nlife like should you dedicate some\namount of time to it absolutely\nbut generally speaking it's gonna you\nknow your attitude towards yourself is\ngonna come with you\nso a lot of times we wanna change the\nperson that we are right\nwe think oh i used to think i'm a good\nperson\nand now i started the journey of\nintrospection and self-reflection which\nis fantastic\nand as we start to look critically at\nourselves we see a lot of nasty stuff\nthat our mind had been suppressing or\nignoring or cognitive biases or whatever\nand then as a result we want to overcome\nthose things right we want to transform\nourselves into a good person\nthe unfortunate tricky thing is that\noftentimes the self-loathing\nis what drives the desire to be better\nand giving into that self-loathing\nis actually gonna sort of in a weird way\nlike propagate the problem\nbecause i'm gonna overcome the disgust\nthat i hold towards myself by giving in\nto the disgust that i hold towards\nmyself\nright and so that's like not a way to\nfix it so what's the answer acceptance\nwhat the hell does that mean i mean sort\nof acknowledging for a moment that like\nit's okay that you screwed up right you\ndid screw up\nyou and this is the other thing is we\nhave this idea that if we transform into\na good person then we'll suddenly stop\nscrewing up\nthat's dangerous\nvery dangerous right so we see this a\nlot in terms of people who are like you\nknow have accomplished a lot of good\nthings and then get off track\nthis is like when they you know\nyou do a lot of good work and now that\ni'm a good person like once you sort of\nhad that identity you can start making\nexcuses for yourself and getting away\nwith doing bad things\nso we don't want to do that right\nunderstand that you can't be a good\nperson or a bad person you're just you\nand like whether you have a positive\nimpact on the world or a negative impact\non the world has to do with your actions\nso how are you going to live today it's\nokay that you screwed up in the past\nhave you treated women with disrespect\ni'm not going to say no big deal but so\nbe it right\nand do better today\nmake sense questions\nokay question about the true self am i\nwhat i experience or am i the thing that\nexperiences\nwhat's the true self there say i\nexperience happiness am i that happiness\nor am i the consciousness that\nexperiences that happiness\nexcellent question\nkind of a tricky answer so the first uh\nthing that i'd say is that you are that\nwhich experiences so that's the conclus\nthe classic conclusion\nthat yogis came to\nis that you are the experiencer and you\nare not actually any of the experiences\nso\nyou know when i drink the tea i'm that\nwhich tastes the tea i'm not the t\nthat being said there's an interesting\ncaveat because if you look at dion\nthere are different states of\nconsciousness okay so it's kind of weird\nso generally speaking we're the\nexperiencer but there are some states of\nconsciousness in which the object of\nobservation and the observer become one\nwhen you become one with the t\nokay\nand even when i work with people in like\nperformance stuff like there's there's\ntimes where if you look at like you know\nif you talk to esports professionals\nthere are moments where they like\ntranscend human limitations\nand they become one with the game and\nthen like you become some sort of\nbizarre like you're channeling some sort\nof like god of the game\nand that's when you really up like reach\npeak performance so there are some\nthere's some elements of of\nconsciousness like states of\nconsciousness right so this is more like\ntheoretical esoteric spiritual stuff\nit's not really scientifically i mean\nthere's some evidence of flow states and\nstuff like that so i think we're\nstarting to chip away at that but\nwhat i'm talking about really is not\nscientifically validated flow state is\nthe closest thing that we can get to in\nterms of science\nbut where you become one with the object\nof your doing so in the flow actually\nflow state is a really good example of\nscientifically that right you become one\nwith the writing like you lose yourself\nand like you are just one with the\nwriting you're one with like the\ncreation of art\noptimal performance sort of touches on\nthis which the yogis call\nsort of like beyond but i think those\nstates are actually slightly different\nand then there are even some mantras\nthat supposedly if you meditate on chant\netc will cultivate oneness with the\nexternal thing\nso ahamra masmi is a good example of\nthat where ahamra masami means i am the\nuniverse\nand so it's kind of weird like if you\njust chant that\ndo you become one with the universe no\nbecause chanting is on some level\nintellectual\nbut when you do month or practice\nthere's more than intellectual activity\ngoing on there's a lot of detail about\nthat in dr k's guide\nso there's theoretically some of these\nesoteric spiritual practices like\nchanting a hum brahmasmi which will\nbridge the gap between like this person\nand the external world\nand at that point\nyou may be the happiness\nbut generally speaking i tend to think\nof\nyou as the experiencer as opposed to the\nexperience\ndoes accepting to be a bad person not\nreinforce the own view identity to be a\nbad person\nsort of so it depends on what\nyou\nhow you accept it\nso that when we're talking about\nacceptance you can't accept something\nfrom the future\nright\nlike you can't do that you can only\naccept what is in the present and what\nhas happened in the past\nso like\njust because you accept so there are two\nways to\nin a sense accept things but i wouldn't\neven call one of them acceptance\nso when you're ahamkar when your past\nactions form your ahamkar that goes into\nthe future that is the determination\nthat i am a bad person\nbut\nwhen we talk about acceptance we're not\ntalking about because remember like\nthat's not who you are you're neither\ngood nor bad the true self is neither\ngood nor bad\nwhat you're accepting is that you've\nmade mistakes\nright that's real acceptance i've\nscrewed up\ni'm really not in the best place i\nreally haven't used my time wisely and i\ncan change that\nright and going forward it doesn't have\nto be that way these are actions i've\ntaken in the past these are individual\nconversations that i've had with women\nwhere i've not treated them with respect\nin the next conversation that i have\nwith a woman i have a choice i can treat\nthem with respect or i cannot treat them\nwith respect\nand that's the whole problem that's\nwhere like is and now we'll get to this\nin a second\neven our next question talks about this\nis that once it becomes an issue of ego\nthen you're screwed but if it becomes an\nissue of action\nthen\nyou'll find salvation right there's a\nroad forward so when you accept\ni wouldn't accept that you're a bad\nperson because i don't think you're a\nbad person you know even someone who has\ndone bad things\ndoesn't necessarily make them a bad\nperson\ni don't believe i have the capacity to\njudge someone as a bad person or a good\nperson my mind may do it\nwhen i get upset or frustrated or\nwhatever like that's a real\nkaren\nyou know we want to do that our mind\nloves to judge other people but like who\nmade me divine that i can judge another\nhuman being can i judge their actions\nlike absolutely\nand this is what i've seen\nworking with people who have addictions\nlike there are a lot of really\nthere are people out there who've done\nsome really bad stuff\nwho can actually end up being like\npretty decent human beings\nand it's just about accepting that you\nhave screwed up and that you can change\nright and once you own that you've\nscrewed up the interesting thing is it's\nempowering\nlike\nit's empowering because that means\nyou're responsible and if you are\nresponsible if you accept that\nresponsibility that also means you have\nthe power to change\nyou"
