    "transcript": "the problem is that you're missing a\npiece of the equation which is that like\nthere's the ego comes in and it starts\ndefining you this way and once the ego\ncomes in then you stop thinking about\nexternal factors\nhow self-esteem is built do you guys\nhave any thoughts or input on it so to\nchange self-esteem is to first\nunderstand the factors on which it is\nbuilt self-esteem is based on three\nsequential factors\nunconditional human worth love and\ngrowing so i don't know exactly this\nseems like it's from a you know\nsome kind of self-help book or something\ni'm not sure exactly what the source is\nso\nand then\nuh goes on to sort of talk a little bit\nabout howard's laws of human worth so\nunconditional human worth is beautifully\ndescribed by five axioms\nbased on the work of claudia howard all\nhave infinite internal\neternal and unconditional worth as\npersons\nall have equal worth as people worth is\nnot comparative or competitive\nalthough you might get better at sports\nacademics business i might be better in\nsocial skills we both have equal worth\nas human beings\nexternals neither add nor diminish worth\nexternals include things like money\nlooks performance and achievements\nthese only increase one's market or\nsocial worth worth as a person however\nis infinite and unchanging\nworth is stable and never in jeopardy\neven if someone rejects you\nworth doesn't have to be earned or\nproved it already exists just recognize\naccept and appreciate it\nso then i think that goes on to sort of\nshare some diagrams and stuff\nso this is a really cool post because i\nthink\nhow self-esteem is built\nis kind of an interesting topic\nso generally speaking we talk a lot\nabout identity we talk a lot about worth\nand self-esteem and ego and confidence\nand all that kind of stuff\nbut i don't know that we've ever talked\nquite so much about how to build up\npositive self-esteem right so i don't\nknow that we've ever discreetly\naddressed that question\nthere may be some stuff about it in dr\nk's guide i think that's where we really\ngo in depth\nabout understanding ego and confidence\nand how to develop confidence and how to\nget rid of ego\nbut generally speaking the approach that\nwe take is about dismantling or\ndisarming or getting control of ego we\ndon't really talk a little quite as much\nabout building up self-esteem\nso let's try to take a a different\nperspective today and talk a little bit\nabout how to build self-esteem\nso in order to understand how to build\nself-esteem the first thing that i want\nto do is talk a little bit about how do\nwe lose self-esteem okay\nso this too is going to be a a you know\nan answer that i'm going to lean a\nlittle bit heavily\non my\nyogic training meditative training\nyou know monastic training\nas opposed to sort of the science but i\nthink that there's good correlations\nthis is really an area where i think\nscience and spirituality sort of really\nstart to overlap\nso think about when you're a kid\nokay\nand when you're a kid\nyou kind of just you do you right like\nyou're not really you don't think of\nyourself as good you don't think of\nyourself as bad\nyou\ngenerally speaking hopefully are\naccepted\nand so where does the idea of\nconditional love come from right like\nwhere does this idea come from that\nyou are you don't have\ngood self-worth\nand this tends to come from a couple of\nplaces so the first thing that people\nmay say is that it comes from other\npeople right so when other people like\ndon't treat you well or they start as\nparents start giving you conditional\nlove\num then you start to lose unconditional\nlove and unconditional self-worth and so\nthat's true\nright so we've touched on there's some\nstuff on this and dr k's guide we've\ntalked some on stream about attachment\ntheory\nwhich in essence posits that\nemotional mirroring is responsible for a\nlarge part of like security in a person\nso when i feel bad and the emotional\nsupport structure around me feels bad\nwith me so if i trip and fall and like\nmy mom runs over she's like oh my god my\npoor baby are you okay\nand you'll sort of notice this that\nacross cultures generally speaking\nadults will have exaggerated responses\ntowards kids\nand why is that it's because it's part\nof the emotional mirroring process right\nso\nif we're emotionally mirrored well\nand that usually correlates with being\nloved unconditionally by our parents\nthen we feel secure in ourselves and we\nstart to like develop strong self-esteem\nso what's the flip side of the coin so\nat some point\npeople will start to have expectations\nof us right and i think what i tend to\nsee a lot in our community especially is\nthat\npeople will have expectations of you so\nthey'll say like you know my mom may be\nyou know may\npick me up when i fall down and that's\nwonderful but her love for me may be\nsomewhat conditional as well so and this\ncan be somewhat healthy too which is\nlike you know i'm going to be treated\ndifferently depending on what grades i\nget i'm going to be treated differently\ndepending on how i behave and and how i\nyou know act and stuff like that\nsocially academically professionally\nhow good i am at sports\nand so as our brains start to understand\nthe structure of our society what our\nbrains do is start to like form\nhierarchies of worth\nand this is sort of like common right so\nif you like think a little bit about\nlet's say i'm dating someone and then\nyou know my family asks me like what do\nthey do for a living and what's going on\nin that moment is that they're bucketing\nthis person right and depending on my\nanswer they're going to you know be\nelevated in terms of social standing\nor\ndevalued in terms of social standing\nand so what happens is like as our brain\ndevelops we start to see that there's\nlike conditioning going on their\nexpectations\nand and we start to be judged based on\nthose expectations but that in and of\nitself i don't think is\nwhere we lose self-esteem because\nself-esteem is about the esteem that we\nhave for ourselves right it's not about\nthe way that we're judged by other\npeople and in fact if you all watch the\nconfidence versus ego lecture in dr k's\nguide to mental health you'll recognize\nthat the big difference between\nconfidence and ego is whether the\njudgments of the outside\ndetermine my value or the internal\njudgments determine my value\nright that's the big difference\nso where does a loss of self-esteem come\nfrom why isn't that when i'm when i grow\nup with unconditional love and i think\ni'm an awesome kid\nwhy do i start to think i'm not an\nawesome kid\nis it because i'm relying i'm starting\nto rely on the judgments of other people\nthat's one way of looking at it but i'd\nsay there's a key step here that we\nhaven't really talked about\nand that is the internalization\nof external expectations\nso what tends to happen and this is the\nreally key step that if you want to\nlearn a little bit about how to\ndevelop your own self-estee how to\ndevelop self-esteem your own self-esteem\nit has to be yours\nbut at some point what we tend to do is\ninternalize the expectations of others\nright so like it's not just that my\nparents judge me\nfor\ndoing well in school or poorly in school\nlike even now as an adult i can get\njudged all the time people can be\ncritical of what i say and do etc right\nand that doesn't necessarily have to\nimpact my self-esteem it's just a\ncriticism and the criticism can just be\nhandled in an appropriate way which is i\ncan adjust my behavior without it having\na hit to my self-esteem so when does it\nhit my self-esteem is when i internalize\nthat criticism\nwhen i internalize that expectation\nwhen i translate from my parents who say\nthat you have to get a 4.0 to be a good\nkid to be a smart kid when i internalize\nthat expectation and i say\nsmart kids or kids that have 4.0 good\nkids or kids that have 4.0's\nand once i adopt that expectation\ninternally once i attach my value\nas a person\nto an external outcome that's when\nself-esteem\ngets shot\nright\nand so this is where but like don't\nparents do that to you and sort of yes\nbecause\nas a child we don't\nit's very difficult for us to like have\nan internal sense of self that is\nseparate from the rest of the world\nright so as children our brain is\ndesigned\nto interpret external information for\nlike our own internal roadmap we're\nlearning about things like who i should\nsmile at and who i should not smile at\nwe're learning about things like gravity\nwe're understanding language social\nnuance we're understanding all this kind\nof stuff right\nwhat kind of clothes do i wear do pants\ngo on heads or do they go on legs\nthere's all kinds of stuff that we are\ninternalizing as children which is why\nif we turn back to attachment theory\nlike kids who have early adverse life\nexperiences tend to have messed up\nattachment and the earlier in life that\nyou tend to have difficult attachment\nexperiences\nthe diff more difficult it is to sort of\ndevelop good attachment whereas being\nlike abandoned at the age of five\nis like generally speaking on average\nmore damaging than being abandoned at\nthe age of\nright may not necessarily be true but\ngenerally speaking it's true that way\nand what's the difference there it's\nbecause as a 55 year old\ni have some internal sense of self i\ndon't automatically my brain is not\nwired to download everything from the\noutside world and turn it into something\ninternally\nso what does this mean for self-esteem\nright so if this is sort of the case\nlike how do i start\nunpacking this how do i develop\nself-esteem is there kind of two\nimportant answers here one that's a\nlittle bit external and one that's a\nlittle bit internal\nso the sad truth is that one of the\nfastest ways to develop self-esteem and\nkind of probably the easiest way\nis from other people right so like this\nis something that we see a lot in group\ncoaching for example\nso i've worked with with so many people\nwho will say things like oh you know\ni'll tell them like i think you're a\nwonderful person they're like you're my\npsychiatrist you're pay you have to say\nthat right so any kind of praise i give\nsomeone\nis sort of like if i don't if they don't\nthink that they're a good person instead\nof accepting that praise\nwhat they do is they like\nthey take their internal sense of self\nand they look at our relationship and\nthey filter that that praise\nthrough their perception of self\nand they may be logically correct right\nso it's kind of like okay fine so what\nwe see in group coaching which is really\ninteresting and so this is a good way to\nbuild self-esteem\nis that\nyou know these people aren't paid to\ntell you anything and so when you win\nthe approval\nof the people in your group who are\npaying to be there just like you are it\nmeans a lot more than winning the\napproval of your psychiatrist of your\nmom or of your you know coach\nwhere if we kind of look at like your\nmom says oh darling that's the best\nartwork i've ever seen you're so\ntalented you're so talented and so\nhandsome and whatever and so if we think\nabout the value that we extract from mom\nloving our artwork it's going to be\ndifferent from being accepted by our\npeers\nso a lot of of self-esteem can actually\ncome from like external people and\nthat's the simplest way to get it\nthere's even some research that suggests\nthat for example with personality\ndisorders you know stable relationships\nthat are emotionally supportive over\nperiods of time can start to really deal\nwith some of those attachment issues and\nactually cause like improvements and\nsymptoms for certain kinds of attachment\ndisorder i mean uh personality disorders\nlike borderline personality disorder so\nas unfortunate as as it is like\nsometimes the way to this easiest way to\nget self-esteem is from other people\nit's actually cultivate people who you\nknow treat you for who you are and as\nyou hang out with people don't push them\naway because it may feel super awkward\nbut then you can start to learn through\nmirroring of others because remember\nthat's how we originally develop\nattachment and security and stuff like\nthat yet your self-esteem can\nimprove the second way to really think a\nlittle bit about self-esteem from an\ninternal sense\ngive me a second\nis through sort of understanding this\nkey step\nwhere once i internalize the\nexpectations of the outside world and i\nstart to believe them myself my\nself-esteem will start to decrease\nand so what do you kind of do about that\nand this is where i'd say like think a\nlittle bit about the way that you judge\nyourself so if you have low self-esteem\nthat means you don't think you're worth\nvery much right\nbut where did you come up\nwith\nthe standard for your judgment\nand what you'll tend to find is that you\nmay have a judgment which is you think\nis very logical\nbut i'd say that most of the people that\ni work with with low self-esteem\ntend to apply a different standard to\nthemselves than they do to other people\nright oh other people should go get\ntherapy that's wonderful that other\npeople are getting therapy but i feel\nweak i feel like i should be able to\nhandle this on my own\nand so there's a the really really\nsubtle point from kind of vedic\npsychology which is that\nonce we extra once we take those\nexternal expectations and we internalize\nthem it becomes a part of our identity\nit becomes a part of our a hum god it\nbecome becomes a way of looking at\nourself\nright it's like our identity at that\npoint\nand so this is the other really key\nthing is to start to tease apart like\nwho am i\ncompared to what are the expectations of\nthe world\nso like just because i perform in a\nparticular way does not necessarily make\nan identity determination\nso i'll give you guys just an example of\nthis so if i get a 4.0 i think i'm smart\nso a 4.0 is an outcome right like it\ndoesn't mean that i'm smart or stupid\nand you may say well duh dr k of course\nit means you're smart well let's think\nabout that for a second right\nmaybe my parents made a 10 million\ndonation to the college\nright so maybe\nthere are always all different ways of\ngetting 4.0 maybe you cheated maybe\nyou've got a 4.0 because you're a 26\nyear old neurotypical person with a\nnormal iq and you're now in the fifth\ngrade where they're teaching basic like\narithmetic and\nsubtraction and multiplication\nright there are all kinds of reasons why\nthe outcome doesn't necessarily\nhave to become part of the ego\nbut as we go through life what tends to\nhappen is we\nyou know we do make that shift we do say\nthat this outcome is because of me\nright so we see this a lot with people\nwho like have difficulty dating and they\nthink like\nas they get rejected by people over and\nover and over again and the other\ninteresting thing is sometimes there's\nnot over and over again sometimes it's\nonce or even let's really zero true\nrejections i've worked with people like\nthat they start to believe that i am\nunlovable\nright which sort of makes sense from a\nlogical standpoint i'm not saying that\nthe logic is like incorrect\nlike it makes sense right so our mind\nwhen it comes to conclusions it's not\nit's smart your mind isn't dumb it's\nsmart\nthe problem is that you're missing a\npiece of the equation which is that like\nthere's the ego comes in and it starts\ndefining you this way and once the ego\ncomes in then you stop thinking about\nexternal factors right so if i start to\nbelieve that i have low self value\nand i go and i ask someone out and they\nsay no\nmy mind uses that as greater evidence\nthat i have low self value and i'm\nunlovable whereas it doesn't really do\nan objective analysis of like maybe the\nreason they said no is because they've\ngot terminal cancer and they're going to\ndie in four weeks\nmaybe the reason they said no rare\noccurrence\nis because they aren't into ready for a\nrelationship right now maybe the reason\nthey said no is because they're already\ndating maybe the reason they say no is\nbecause they're asexual\nmaybe the reason they said no is because\nthey're not attracted to my gender maybe\nthe reason they said no is because\nthey're not attracted to my hair color\nright like there's all kinds of reasons\nthat people can say no\nbut it\nit's the ego that sort of assumes that\nall of those things\nhave to do with you\nright\nso when it comes to like recovering your\nself-esteem or building self-esteem you\ncan absolutely do it externally but the\nsecond piece is to be very critical of\nthe expectations that you've\ninternalized and how did you come to\nbelieve\nthe things that you believe about\nyourself\nright and this is the kind of thing that\npeople can work on absolutely in therapy\nbut it's not exclusive to therapy so if\nwe talk about you know the process of\ndiscovering what i believe about myself\nand where that does that come from\nthat's a process that musicians go\nthrough that's a process that monks go\nthrough that's a process that people go\nthrough through journaling and stuff\nlike that so that's not you know\nnecessarily\nonly the province of therapists\nthey're very trained good at that kind\nof stuff by the way so i highly\nrecommend doing something like that but\nbut it's really sort of dismantling like\nthe identification with the thing\nbecause that's where the suffering comes\nfrom that's where the self-esteem comes\nfrom whereas like the outcomes are just\nthe outcomes right if i didn't get a 4.0\ni got a b i can start to think all kinds\nof things about myself\noh my god\nother people are smarter than me i'm not\nso smart or i can just acknowledge that\nhey\nyou know history is really not my strong\nsuit i really did not enjoy the class\ni wasn't able to put forth as much\neffort and focus as i really wanted to\nso be it\nright you can like acknowledge the\noutcome you can even learn from the\noutcome and grow from the outcome\nwithout you getting your ego involved\nand i would even argue that growing from\nthe outcome and learning from the\noutcome is way easier when your ego\nisn't involved because that's when you\nreally learn okay like well how did i\nscrew up here\nright\nbecause in a funny way there's this\nparadoxical ego thing where the ego says\noh i'm an idiot that's why it happened\nand then there's no like forward\nprogress right it's just it's it's an\nanswer that the ego gives you that sort\nof in a weird way\nblames you a hundred percent and\nabsolves you of the responsibility of\ndoing anything about it so it's like an\ninteresting like way to stay stuck\nand dodge criticism by just having a\nblanket blame yep that's just me i'm an\nidiot\nright you'll see this even like in\nrelationships like i don't know if\nyou've had people where when you try to\ncriticize them they'll just like\nthey'll say like some really\nself-deprecating thing that sort of\ndisarms your criticism and then you\ncan't\nyou're like\nyou know hey\ni thought you were going to pick me up\nfrom the airport oh yeah stupid me\ni guess i'm just a complete idiot\nbecause i forgot like my bad like i\ndon't know why you relied on me in the\nfirst place i'm clearly a dumbass\nright and it's like i'm not saying that\nbro\nbut there's no\nproductive conversation there right when\npeople sort of double down like i see\nthis a lot especially when when with\npeople who have addictions\nwhere they'll just like toss that out\nthere because they see feel so bad about\nthemselves and like kind of be like yeah\ni'm an addict like it's not like i can\nfunction anyway\nright and so then like in doing so they\nactually don't\nprogress or try to grow\ni'm not blaming him for it right because\nit's a sign of\nyou know really really low self value\nand their egos in control like it's okay\nbut let's be a little bit critical about\nwhat's going on\nso just to kind of summarize you know\nwe've talked a lot about ego\nself-confidence there's a lot of stuff\nin dr k's guide about that sort of thing\nif y'all are interested in a deeper\nspiritual perspective on that i strongly\nrecommend you check out the atman bada\nwhich is the path of self\nand like how to understand what's the\ncore self and generally speaking you\nknow when we talk about those kinds of\nthings we'll talk a lot about disarming\nego and the nature of identity we have a\nlot of meditations on that subject as\nwell\nbut this question today was a little bit\ndifferent which is like how do you go\nabout building self-esteem and the truth\nis that there are two real ways to build\nit one is externally which is a little\nbit tricky right because it means that\nit's kind of out of your hands but this\nis the thing about life is that you\ncan't necessarily do everything easily\nby yourself right sometimes you need\nhelp from other people and that's\nactually completely okay\nthe second thing is from an internal\nperspective so as uh from an external\nperspective as people start to treat you\nwell you may start to believe that you\nyourself are a good person\nbecause that's usually where\nstrong self-esteem comes from it comes\nfrom\nkids growing up being taught\nthat they are good people\nthe second internal way to sort of work\non your self-esteem is to recognize that\ntheir external expectations with the\nwhich the world may have\nwhich at some point you begin to\ninternalize\nand as you internalize\nan external expectation\nit can get tangled up with your sense of\nidentity\nand once it gets tangled up with your\nsense of identity\nit's gonna affect your self-esteem so\nthat disentangling process of starting\nto recognize\nsure a 4.0 is better than a 3.0 but\nwhere did i get the conclusion\nthat people who are smart get 4.0 and\npeople who are dumb get 3.0 are there\nany smart people that i know that have\ngotten a 3.0 are there any dumb people\nthat i know that i've gotten a 4.0\nand as you start to look at that a\nlittle bit critically and like how did\nyou get entangled in this so how did you\nstart to believe these things about\nyourself\nhopefully you'll start the process of\ndisentangling that ego from the external\nexpectations and as a result as you move\naway from ego your confidence will rise\nand hopefully your self-esteem will\nimprove\nyou"
