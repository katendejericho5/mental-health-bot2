    "transcript": "all right so shall we talk about um\nshould we talk about clinginess\ni 18m have noticed a pattern in my\nrelationships with women we would get to\nknow each other we're texting for hours\nwe're making jokes we're we're just\nhaving a lovely conversation\nthen the next day we start texting again\nbut with a little lesson\nengagement and as time goes on\nthe other person just completely stops\nresponding even though we had a lot in\ncommon so i tried to flip the script\ninstead of sending good morning texts i\nwould just text when i have something\ninteresting to say instead of giving\ncompliments i would maybe tease in a\nplayful way instead of caring about the\nother person i literally didn't give\na crap what happens to them and for some\nreason that worked every time i texted\nthem they would reply back pretty much\nstraight away and they would reciprocate\nthe same energy i give\nso what's the point of having a\nrelationship if i can't be interested in\nthe other person for them to be\ninterested in me\nit's a really common experience right\nso if you're someone who finds yourself\nit's it's a really unfortunate\nconclusion or trajectory that this\nperson is going through which is\ni engage with someone i get super\nexcited we have a wonderful time\nand then over time my relationship with\nthem slowly extinguishes\nand so what i have to force myself to\nstart doing is like stop caring\nit's like stop being like authentic like\ni'm gonna stop complimenting them i have\nto train myself to not care about them\nand then what happens when i train\nmyself\nto not care about this person\ni actually get like\nbetter responses right\nthe response that i get is more of what\ni want they respond more to my texts\nand so what this person what's happening\nis this person is sort of like\nstruggling between what they kind of\nconsider like being like an authentic\ngood person\nwhich hurts me and doesn't get me what i\nwant versus kind of being sort of an\n[ __ ] and being less kind which sort\nof gets me what i want\nright and then this person kind of\nstruggles and then they're like stuck\nbetween one of two places do i become\nclingy or do i become an [ __ ]\nand it's really unfortunate when people\nfind themselves in this situation\nbecause they like tend to wind up doing\none of the two and both of them are\nactually toxic\nright\nwe don't want to become clingy but we\nalso don't want to like you know start\nnot caring about the people that we want\nto form relationships with like that's\nnot healthy over time but it happens all\nthe time very very classic\nso what's going on here and what do we\ndo about it\nso the key thing to start with as always\nlike so at you know hg we talk about a\nprinciple that i learned in medicine\nwhich is that good diagnosis precedes\ngood treatment\nso what we want to do is start by\nunderstanding the problem right and\nthat's not exclusive to medicine\nyou know if i have if i have flooding in\nmy house and a plumber comes over they\nhave to start by understanding okay\nwhere's the leak coming from right\nif you go to a mechanic they have to\ndiagnose the problem before they fix it\nso in that same way within yourself you\nhave to understand what's going on\nbefore you can start to correct that\nbehavior and ultimately like go to a\nkind of healthy place\nso little bits of advice\nthe first thing that i've noticed about\npeople who get really really clingy\ni wasn't gonna do ipad for this but\nmaybe i should\nis that\nthe first thing they should kind of\nscale back on is like the intensity of\nthe first interaction\nso there is a saying\nthat\nyou know the brightest flame burns out\nthe quickest\nright\nand so in any kind of relationship\nlike i've just noticed this a lot i mean\ni've noticed that kind of clinically\num so this is like a well-described uh\nexperience of people with like\nborderline personality disorder where\nthey tend to have very very intense\nlike\nrocket fuel level relationships that\nthen run out of fuel and then collapse\nso i'm not saying that everyone in this\nsituation has borderline personality\ndisorder but it's just something that\nwe've seen a lot or i've worked with a\nlot\nso how to avoid getting clingy let's\nstart there\nand then what we need to do\nis first of all recognize that like this\nperson has two options either they go\nthe clingy route\nor they go the uncaring route\nand what they find is that this leads to\nextinguishing\ninteractions\nand this leads to increasing\ninteractions\nand what this person wants is increased\ninteractions because they're looking for\nfriendship or romantic relationships\nright\nand so what they sort of end up doing is\nlearning that oh like what's like you\nknow maybe i go down this route\nthe first thing that we want to\nunderstand is like you know what's going\non\ninside\nright like how do you feel when when\nyou're texting for hours the first day\nyou meet someone that sounds a little\nbit excessive to me\nso it sounds to me like a bright candle\nthat's going to burn out quickly and\nthis is just something to understand in\nrelationships right is generally\nspeaking like\nrelationships healthy relationships tend\nto form\nslowly so if you think about the\ninteraction for people you know with\nhealthy relationships it tends to go\nlike this this is time this is level of\ninteraction\nright if we look at like the formation\nof unhealthy relationships oftentimes it\ncan be like this\nright this is time\nlevel of interaction\nand so sometimes you can absolutely have\nthis kind of relationship right where\nit's like intense\nand it just\nyou know it builds and it stays high\nbut i would say that generally speaking\nthese two curves\nthis one and this one are way more\ncommon\nso the main thing to really understand\nis what are you trying to get out of\nthis relationship\nbecause i think oftentimes what happens\nis if you're like complimenting a girl\nlike are you like that's kind of\ninteresting right are you\nare you like\nwhat are you doing there so generally\nspeaking you know i don't really\ncompliment people that i have\nrelationships with i may appreciate them\nfrom time to time but i don't like open\nup with a bunch of compliments\nbecause usually like that that signals\nsomething else are you like so you have\nto start by figuring out what is going\non within you so when you're texting\nsomeone for hours like why are you\ntexting them for hours are you genuinely\nenjoying the interaction are you hopeful\nthat this will turn into something\nare you just genuine like are you just\nkind of chilling and having a good time\nbecause if you're chilling and having a\ngood time\nthen it shouldn't really matter to you\nthat things kind of fizzle out over time\nright like it shouldn't matter because\nyou're just appreciating the moment and\nthe moment isn't going to last forever\nso if i'm like walking down the street\nand i see a beautiful flower and i smell\nthe flower and i'm like wow that flower\nis amazing and then i just move on with\nmy life so if this is truly what you're\ndoing\nthen you should it shouldn't bother you\nthat the next day they don't text right\nbecause you can just appreciate the\ninteraction and move on\nbut chances are you're hopeful or you're\nattaching some kind of expectation\nand this is the key thing to understand\nbecause when you attach an expectation\noftentimes done subconsciously like\nyou're kind of lonely you're kind of\ninterested in this person you do want to\nask them out\nand you like and you start complimenting\nthem\nand like you're kind of like gearing up\nto ask them out you want them to like\nyou you're kind of like love bombing\nthem a little bit right you're trying to\nstack the deck in your favor\nyou're creating an expectation\nand if you're not transparent with that\nexpectation if you're not transparent\nwith that intention\nwhat it's probably going to lead to is\nlike some kind of miscommunication over\ntime because you're not you're you're\nsaying one like you're doing one thing\nyou're intending one thing but you're\nkind of saying something else you're not\nbeing kind of explicit over it and then\nlike the person is doesn't understand\nwhat's going on in your head right like\nyou're not telling them\nin fact what you're sort of doing is\nlike even misleading them in the worst\ncase scenario and then what happens is\nthey don't respond the way that you want\nto so like this sounds like egregious to\nme\nsending a good morning text dude i have\nnever sent a good morning text to anyone\nthat i don't have some kind of serious\nrelationship with\nlike\neven close friends of mine like i don't\nsend them good morning texts like the\nonly people that i will send good\nmorning texts to\nare people that i have intimate\nrelationships with\nso this this sounds very strange to me\nso i don't know if this is the kind of\nthing where dr k is a boomer and like\nthis is normal now but like i don't say\ngood morning text to my friends\nlike oh i sent like good morning text to\nmy girlfriend like i said good morning\ntext to my wife\ni may imagine at some point that i will\nsend good morning texts to you know\nmaybe my parents or brother or like\nyou know kids one day i'm sure i would\nwant a good morning text from my kids\nwhen they're old enough to text\nbut this sounds to me to be like quite\nintimate\nand so this is where i don't know i\ndon't know what the standard is maybe\nthat's normal now but like this could be\nthe kind of thing where like you know\nyou have one really really like\nintensive long lovely conversation and\nthen you start sending good morning\ntexts and the person is like wait this\nis a level of intimacy that i'm not\ncomfortable with like yesterday we were\ntalking about how awesome dune is\nand how much we love the you know the\nrevival of science fiction and fantasy\nand the next morning you're like\ngood morning beautiful\nlike that seems kind of like romantic in\nnature to me and this is where i'd sort\nof say like be explicit\nif you have an intention so what kind of\nexpectation you should have like if\nyou're romantically interested just ask\nhim out\nright just do it\nlike if you want to ask someone out just\nask them out don't piddle around\nand if you're afraid of rejection which\nis oftentimes the reason that people\ndon't ask people out right\nlike you're afraid they're going to say\nno so let me compliment them a lot let\nme tell them how awesome i am let me\nconvince them that i'm worth going out\nwith and then i will ask them out and\nduring that time you're like doing all\nthese weird things like you're sending\nflowers and crap like that and it's like\nwhy is this person saying oh you're so\nsweet but you're not asking about so\nthen you kind of get friend-zoned\nbecause you're not like making your\nintentions clear and then you ask them\nout and then like you've had this\nexpectation\nand then\nthat expectation gets dashed\nright\nso i think if you want to ask someone\nout just ask them out\nnext thing is about the clinginess\nso what are you getting like what's\ngoing on so this is where i would really\nthink a little bit about when you have\nthis awesome kind of this relationship\nhere\nwhat emotional needs\nare being met\nbecause when we think about clinginess\nthis comes down in essence to emotional\nneeds\nokay\nso when i'm clinging with someone like\nthey're giving me something like why\nlike like let's you even think about the\nword cling\nso you know a couple years ago when we\nfirst put our kids into like daycare or\nwhatever like they cling to us\nright children will like cling to their\nparents\nwhen they feel\nlike\nunable to be on their own they don't\nfeel safe\nyou know you cling to like even if you\nthink about stray cats like if you feed\na cat and they start following you\naround they're kind of clinging to you\nright you're meeting some kind of\nemotional need\nnow what tends to happen the reason we\nget into clingy relationships is because\npeople\ninadvertently\nmeet\na high\nintense\nemotional need\nof ours\nso this is where like you're texting\nthis person it's like wow like this is\namazing this is what i've been craving\nthis entire time and so for you\nlike let's look at the interaction okay\nso let's let's talk about intensity\nof interaction\nand then here's\nyou\nright so the intensity of interaction is\nreally high\nand then for them like it may be like\nhere\nand then in this\nmismatch is like when you start to get\nclingy because then when the next day\nrolls around\nright like you're texting at this level\ngood morning\ncompliments\nbecause you're trying to get them to do\nwhat they did yesterday you want that\nagain you're like oh my god that felt so\ngood i felt so hurt i connected so much\ni didn't feel alone like that was\nawesome give it to me again\nand so you you open out strong out of\nthe gate but then they kind of respond\nwith this\nand then what happens over time\nis that the more of a mismatch there is\nthe more the communication is going to\ndecrease\nokay\nbecause it's like a mismatch in\ncommunication it's kind of thing about\nyou know like friends that you play\ngames with online like you all are kind\nof both on the same page they're like\nsome people that are like messaging you\nevery hey you want to play dota hey you\nwant to play dota hey you want to play\ndota if you don't play dota that often\nlike that mismatch is going to lead them\nto start asking other people\nand you to like not respond to them\nevery day\nand over time like the people that you\nend up interacting with or the people\nthat are sort of like on your level\nand so why is this person getting more\nresponse when he stops caring because\nstopping to care\nis the way so this is where his\nemotional needs are\nthis is where the person he's engaging\nwith are and when he stops caring he's\nlike artificially and arguably toxically\nreducing his emotional need right so\nwhen i like numb myself by 50\nthen we're kind of on the same page\nand then like our communication actually\nincreases over time\nbecause we're both like in the same\nplace\nand so this is the last thing that i'd\nsay is\nfirst thing is to understand your\nemotional needs and then the next thing\nis to like recognize like okay what are\nthis person's emotional needs because if\nwe look at this\nwhat's absent\nfrom this entirely\nis any understanding of the other\nperson's experience\nright it's just about what i think what\ni think what i need what i'm expecting\nthere is a complete lack of\nunderstanding of okay what does this\nperson want from the relationship what\nis this person's experience of the\nrelationship i'm not saying this to be\nharmful or try to you know i recognize\nthat that makes it sound like this\nperson is uncaring this person's 18.\nlike we don't get taught this stuff like\nthat's the problem right no one sits us\ndown and says by the way this is how you\nform a healthy relationship\nit's just like rng depending on what our\nparents are what your home life is like\nyou know whether people should like\nteach you this stuff intrinsically or\nnot i don't blame this person\ni think in fact it's awesome that this\nperson posted this because this problem\nis so common but no one ever like\nexplains this to us and so what we end\nup doing is is discovering artificial\ntoxic ways of not caring about people\nthat actually match their level of like\nengagement\nright and then we start to like see\nbetter responses and then what happens\nover time is what this person is\nthinking is the right way to engage with\npeople is to stop start being unfeeling\nand uncaring towards them\nand if we do that we're going to become\ntoxic over time and that'll ruin our\nrelationships\nbut that's going to be the only way that\nwe learned how to fix it because no one\nsort of you know taught us what the\nright level of interaction is\nso think a little bit about you know\nwhat is the other person's experience\nwhat are they looking for\nyou can even ask them like you can have\na you know dtr define the relationship\nconversation with friends\nyou know like i actually have those\nconversations with people that even i\nplay games with i'll ask like questions\noccasionally i'll be like hey like how\noften do you wanna like are you\ninterested in playing dota or not\ninterested like a very good friend of\nmine like we've been tight dude we were\nlike roommates way back and like we're\nlike awesome friends\nand i really love playing dota we'll\nsometimes play some games together but\nthey don't seem to be interested in dota\nthey like watching dota so we like we'll\nhave a conversation about it i'll be\nlike hey i've messaged you a couple\ntimes about dota you seem like you're\nnot interested is this the kind of thing\nlike you want me to message you or like\nnot message you or like what\nhe's like oh yeah it's got a steep\nlearning curve so i'm not interested\ninvesting that much time but i love\nwatching it and i love it like you know\ni'm down to watch anytime i just don't\nwant to play and it's like cool now i\nunderstand\nso you can kind of define the\nrelationship you can even with people\nthat you you kind of meet you know\nrelatively soon you can sort of\ncheck in with them periodically\nyou can sort of like read between the\nlines some\nbecause like it sounds kind of\naggressive to me to sort of like you\nknow ask someone hey do you want me to\ntext you every day the day after you\nmeet them\ndo you want me to text you good morning\nevery single day after after we've met\nonce this is the kind of thing where you\nhad a really great conversation i think\nit's fine to acknowledge the next day\nhey i really enjoyed talking to you\nyesterday\nyou want to hang out sometime\nif that's what you want right understand\nyour emotional needs and make them known\nand then give other people the\nopportunity\nto meet you where you're at or not meet\nyou where you're at\nand over time you may learn some\nadjustments like don't ask them that the\nnext day\nright like let leave the ball in their\ncourt sometimes don't always like have\nthe ball in your court\nso like the next day see if they want to\nmessage you\nand if they don't message you by like\nyou know 4 p.m you shoot them a quick\ntext say hey i really enjoyed our\nconversation yesterday\nit was awesome hope you're doing well\nand then if they don't respond like you\nknow this is where you go you got to\nlike learn how often the ball is coming\nacross the court because this is what\nhappens when people are clingy you\nbecome a tennis ball machine so normally\nwhen two human beings are playing tennis\ni hit the ball over to your side\nright and then i wait for them to hit it\nback\nand then i hit it back this is how\ntennis works\nnow i'm not saying you and some people\nwill have very very iron-clad rules like\nif i text them and they don't respond\ni'm never texting them again i don't\nthink that's healthy either because\nsometimes stuff happens maybe the day\nthat you texted them\ntheir father got diagnosed with covet\nright it's like there are all kinds of\nreasons so i think it's okay to like\ngive them a couple days and text them\nagain\nand give them a couple days and text\nthem again and then if they don't\nrespond\nyou can even have a conversation like\nthis\nwhich is\num so i'll give you all an example of\nlike someone so sometimes i'll invite\npeople to things right and they won't\ncome and you invite them three times and\nthey don't come then i think it's\nappropriate to just ask them a question\nbe like hey i've invited you a couple of\ntimes it seems like you haven't\nuh you haven't come i was just curious\ndo you want me to continue inviting you\nor not\nlike i understand sometimes people are\nbusy sometimes people are just like not\nthat interested just help me understand\ndo you want me to invite you in the\nfuture yes or no\nthat i don't think is aggressive and if\nthey don't respond to that then you're\ndone\nsometimes what happens with clingy\npeople\nis it's a machine gun it's a tennis ball\nmachine you're just sending text after\ntext after text after text after text\nfeels overwhelming the person feels\nattacked and then they shut down\nright they put up barriers and then they\nend up blocking you if you're not\ncareful\nso to summarize\nthis kind of situation\nis very very common\nwe'll oftentimes meet people and we'll\nhit it off\nand we enjoy that interaction so much\nthat like\nwe start to get hungry for it we attach\ncertain expectations certain hopes oh my\ngod this conversation was amazing\ni want to have another one i want to\nhave another one i want to have another\nwhich makes perfect sense right if you\neat some really delicious food you wake\nup the next day you're like man let's go\nround two like let's go\nlike when you play like when you start\nplaying a video game right and you\nreally enjoy it you binge that game for\neight hours you don't wake up the next\nday and not think about it all you're\nlike let's go let's play again it's\ncompletely normal to have that reaction\nand at the same time this is a\nrelationship where someone else may have\na slightly different perspective you\ndon't really know so you've got to be\ncareful you've got to think a little bit\nabout their perspective\nso if you find yourself getting clingy\nand they kind of shut you down because\nyou're kind of over communicating what\ncan also happen is you can learn\nin kind of like a hurtful way to stop\ncaring about the other person and when\nyou stop caring about the other person\nwhat can happen is this scenario here\nwhere you artificially reduce your level\nof communication to a level they're\ncomfortable with\nand you actually observe rightly so this\nis like a kind of an observation that\nthey respond better to that you're not\nactually being an ass to them right\nyou're just like\nmaking yourself care less so that you\nbombard them less\nand they're actually comfortable with\nthat so then they respond more and if\nyou're not careful what that'll end up\nas is you becoming kind of like toxic\nover time\nwith the way that you think about other\npeople the way that you treat other\npeople\nbecause it does actually give you the\nkind of response that you want\nand so what should you do about this\nstart by understanding yourself right\nwhat needs of mine are being met\nlike what am i getting out of this why\nam i doing this\nwhy do i like this so much\nand generally speaking what you also\nwant to do is think about the other\nperson like\nwhere are they in this relationship are\nthey as into me as i'm into them like\nyou know give them some space give them\nsome time give them some you know time\nto kind of let you know what their needs\nare if they are just as into you as you\nare into them they'll probably text you\nback\nover time generally speaking i think\nit's important to\nscale up your interactions slowly with\nother human beings that's how\nrelationships form right it's like\nyou know if you meet someone and you\nmove in with them\nbecause you all are deeply in love a\nweek later those relationships in my\ngeneral understanding are less likely to\nsucceed\nthe ones that succeed are the ones that\nyou're dating for a year or two before\nyou move in right there's like a natural\nprogression\nacknowledge that and sort of take things\na little bit slower and as you\nunderstand what needs of yours are being\nmet that'll be easier\nand the last thing that you can do is\nalso just\nhave a defining the relationship\nconversation like when it's appropriate\nlike you know\na lot of people aren't going to be ready\nfor that conversation 24 hours after\nmeeting you like what is this like like\ni don't know i just met you yesterday i\nhave no idea what this is\nbut at some point it may be useful to\nhave a little bit of a conversation like\nthat like hey you know i've invited you\na couple times it seems like you've been\nbusy i'm just curious do you want me to\ncontinue inviting you\nyou know simple yes or no you don't have\nto provide justification you don't have\nto provide reasoning you don't have to\nexplain your thinking just send a simple\nthing their way\nbe a little bit patient be a little bit\nforgiving don't over explain don't share\nall your anxieties with them\nright hi i have anxiety ha ha i'm afraid\nyou're abandoning me\nand it's like then the person's gonna be\nlike this is too much for me to handle\njust ask them hey what do you want\nsimple\ngive them space\nand hopefully as you start to understand\nwhat your needs are as you start to be a\nlittle bit more empathic towards them\nyour relationships will improve\nyou"
