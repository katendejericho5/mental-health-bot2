    "transcript": "like trauma is like a biological\nexperience a psychological experience a\nhuman experience\nthat bad things happen to humans\nso\nlet's get started so today's stream is\ngoing to be a little bit different\num\nwe were planning on streaming eldon ring\nand i was very very excited about that\nbut in light of recent events\nand what i mean by that is the conflict\nbetween russia and ukraine\ni just didn't\nfeel it um\ni felt like there was\nsomething else to talk about which is a\nlittle bit more timely and important\ni love to play elden ring hopefully i'll\nplay tonight\ni was stunned yesterday when it actually\nit seems like it got released yesterday\num\nso\njust in light of what's going on and\nespecially in light of\nseveral posts we've seen on our\nsubreddit\ni thought i would try to take it this\nopportunity to talk a little bit about\npost-war trauma\nuh and coping so i think these are\ntopics that are like really important to\nour community i think the other thing\nthat i was very surprised by is that um\nwe do have people in our community who\nare from these countries\nso when i was at ti of all places\ni was really surprised by the number of\npeople who like walked up and introduced\nthemselves and how they had you know\nukrainian accents russian accents\num and so there are a lot of our you\nknow our community and and i think\nthat's going to be an important part of\nwhat we talk about as we'll see\nso today what i'd like to do is talk a\nlittle bit about\num\nwhat we've learned in terms of science\nabout\npost-war kind of coping uh we're gonna\nbe sort of basing today's talk on three\npeer-reviewed publications\nso one is going to be\nwhat we've learned from qualitative\nresearch from holocaust survivors\nthe second is going to be\na paper looking at how people managed to\ncope in 1999 with a set of air raids i\nbelieve in serbia\nuh let me double check\nno yugoslavia\num\nand then the third study we're going to\nbe kind of talking about which is really\ninteresting is is going to share\na\nperspective on coping mechanisms and\nstressors post-traumatic events\nwhich i think is is really interesting\nit's it's looking at people from bosnia\nadolescence specifically\nso what i'd like to do today is share a\nlittle bit about\nyou know when people when we talk about\ntrauma\num we don't really\nunderstand how trauma affects people we\ndon't really understand so a lot of the\nquestions that we're getting is like\nwhat should i do\nand i don't know that i'm qualified to\ntell people what they should do in a\nsituation like this i really don't feel\nqualified\nand at the same time i think that we do\nhave or hopefully\nwe have a responsibility or we're going\nto try\nto educate people about\nwhat we understand about how to cope\nwith terrible situations\ni have had some degree of clinical\nexperience in this stuff so the other\nkind of couple of disclaimers\nso the first is that i'm not an expert\nin trauma i'm not like a traumatologist\ni have not worked\nvery extensively i mean i've worked for\nseveral months with people who are first\nresponders so i've done trauma-based\nprograms and things like that worked\nwith 9 11 survivors\nworked with veterans from the afghan\nafghanistan and iraq war so i in\nprimarily being a substance use\nclinician in a lot of ways like there's\na lot of trauma kind of thrown in\nbut we haven't really dug into\nhow we understand how to cope with\ntrauma too much on stream so today i'd\nlike to share some information about\nthat\nonce again this is not like a substitute\nfor medical care right so we're going to\nbe talking about broad scale principles\nand like some important kind of\ntakeaways\ni don't know that anything we're going\nto discuss on stream today is like a\ngame plan for how to you know survive\nwhat's going on in ukraine right now i\nwish honestly i could offer that but the\ntruth is that\nwe just don't know right and when it\ncomes to actually dealing with trauma\nlike this is something that's an\nindividual journey and what i'd love to\ndo today is share some principles that\nwe've sort of learned in the scientific\ncommunity and through research about how\nwe understand trauma\num\nyeah does that make sense to people\nso\nwe're gonna kind of dive in\num so yeah i i think i'm i'm actually\nsomewhat in a sense happy to be talking\nabout this i know it sounds kind of\nweird but i think that we've learned so\nmuch from post-war survivors about the\nprocess of trauma which i think like\nreally should like people should\nunderstand\num so we've learned a lot about coping\nmechanisms\nthere's something else that i'm not\ngoing to talk about today which we may\ndepending on whether you all find this\nuseful or not or interesting we may talk\na little bit about this sometime next\nweek\nbut another topic that i was thinking\nabout exploring today is post-traumatic\ngrowth versus post-traumatic stress\nso we know scientifically that like when\nyou experience a traumatic event that\nlike there's basically a fork in the\nroad and you can go one of two ways you\ncan kind of grow from the event and like\nintegrate it into who you are and become\nsort of a stronger better person\nand then the other thing is is some\npeople aren't able to cope with it very\nwell and it sort of manifests as\npost-traumatic stress\nand so there's been a lot of really\ninteresting research over the last 20\nyears about like what determines which\npath you go on and i think that kind of\ninformation is very very helpful\na couple of other things that i want to\nmention the first is that i know that a\nlot of people are really struggling\nright now\ni imagine a lot of people are feeling\nterrified and hopeless we've certainly\nseen that on our subreddit um and and so\none message that i'd have that i\ncompletely stand behind as as best as\nyou can\ntry to hold on to hope as best as you\ncan i know that in situations like this\nand this is as someone who's worked with\nholocaust survivors 911 survivors things\ncan absolutely feel incredibly hopeless\nin the moment\nbut the truth is that no human being can\npredict the future and we have no idea\nwhat's going to come next and i say that\nsort of in a good way i'm optimistic\nabout it we're going to share a little\nbit of research from holocaust survivors\ntoday about holding on to hope and and\ntrying to manage\num i know it sounds really bizarre but\nyou know sometimes people can feel very\nvery bad they can feel even suicidal\nhopeless etc\nuh you know i encourage you all to do\nwhatever you can to take care of\nyourself do whatever you can to stay\nsafe if you have access to mental health\nresources please use them if they're at\nyour disposal\nand i know things can seem really really\nbleak right now\nbut you know i think we've learned this\nin the world the past couple of years is\nlike you know everyone thought they knew\nwhat was going to go what was going what\n2020 was going to be like right and then\nthis global pandemic emerged and and\nshattered the way that we lived in this\nworld and now that the pandemic is\nending we thought we were\nsort of done with it right and then this\nconflict happens between russia and\nukraine and so we never know what's\ncoming and sometimes that's bad stuff\nbut it can also be good things and\nsometimes it's really really easy to\nlose hope but\nas best as you can don't because you\ndon't you really don't know and i've\nseen the the work that i've done as a\npsychiatrist and also the work that i've\ndone here at hg has really helped me\nappreciate\nhow resilient and amazing human beings\nare\nand we are able to bounce back and there\nis kindness in the world and like there\nthere is safety like you can find safety\nin this world you can find security in\nthis world and even though it may be\ntaken away from you for now and who\nknows i mean it\nyou know people are undoubtedly going to\nperish in this conflict so i can't\nreally say that you're going to be safe\nfor sure\nbut having worked with trauma survivors\nvictims for many years now like i can\nassure you that\nyou know for most people thankfully\nthere is a light at the end of the\ntunnel right i can't say for everyone\ni'd love to say i\ni wish i could guarantee you that\neverything would be safe and happy five\nyears from now in your life but i can't\nmake that guarantee i don't have the\npower to do that i'm not divine\nbut what i can tell you is that\npeople who hold on to hope are\noftentimes not disappointed and that's a\nstatement that i stand 100 behind\nso let's get started oh the last thing\nthat i want to sort of mention is a is\nalmost like a trigger warning so some of\nthe stuff that we're going to be talking\nabout today\num we're going to do our best to sort of\nstick to twitch tos\nso\nwe're going to be citing a couple of\nscientific peer-reviewed papers\nthe challenge is that some of the things\nthat are discussed within these papers\nare actually like quite negative and\ngraphic we're going to actually steer\nclear\nof the most graphic stuff as best as we\ncan but i'm going to be showing direct\nquotes from the paper\num and so you know just in terms of a\ntrigger trigger warning like i just want\ny'all to try to you know if this is the\nkind of thing that\nyou think could trigger you i'd i\ndefinitely recommend steering clear or\nmaybe waiting until we have you know\nsome kind of edited vaude or something\nlike that\num but we are gonna be talking about you\nknow issues related to war and violence\nand and coping and trauma\num so just kind of a trigger warning\nthere we'll do our best to sort of keep\ni'm gonna steer clear of some of the\nworst stuff\nbut it may get flashed on screen in\nterms of quotes and things like that so\ni apologize for that\nokay\nso\nlet's get started so today what we're\ngoing to talk a little bit about\nis\nwhat we've learned from as a scientific\ncommunity about\npost-war coping and sort of how to\nsurvive or what factors\npredict kind of healthy integration\num from traumatic experiences\nand so once again this is the kind of\nthing where it's i wish i could give you\nall a script and say if you do a b and c\nif you do d e and f\nthat you will be fine but we don't\nreally we can't really say that um\nfairly and that that i think is okay\nbecause what i'm going to share with you\nall today is some basic principles about\nwhat we understand about how to cope\nwith negative situations\nso as researcher when researchers look\nat people like holocaust survivors um\npost-war survivors adolescence and\ndevelopment like what are the things\nthat constitute or what can we sort of\ndetermine from research by looking at\nmasses of people like what helps people\ncope what helps people survive and what\nhelps people integrate\nso the first study that we're going to\nlook at\nis gonna be\na qualitative study of holocaust\nsurvivors\nokay so\nand i'm gonna sort of talk a little bit\nabout\num\nyou know why we're sort of focusing on\nthis study\nso this is a study that looks at\nimmediate post-war coping strategies of\nadolescent survivors of the holocaust\nthe other thing that we're going to be\nfocusing on today\nis going to be primarily looking at\nstudies of younger populations\nso i think a lot of people in our\ncommunity are young\num so i i sort of we sort of focused on\nyounger populations so if we look at\nholocaust survivors\nwhat are the coping mechanisms which\nthey employed that seemed to matter so\nthis is a qualitative study so what that\nmeans is that this person essentially\ndid interviews with a small sample of\npeople and basically asked them\nquestions\nabout what their experience of the\nholocaust was what they felt was helpful\nin terms of of coping and we're going to\nkind of go over some of those kind of\nkey takeaways that\nthis person sort of discovered\nokay\nso the first thing is that we have to\nunderstand the population that we're\ndealing with so these are people\nwho\nlost everything\nwe're talking about holocaust survivors\na lot of them fled to poland\num even in poland they experienced a lot\nof persecution sometimes violence racism\nanti-semitism\nand this is one of the things that's\nreally really challenging about\npost-war refugees\nis that the trauma doesn't necessarily\nstop when you escape the country\nand i know that that sounds like really\nhopeless there's good news there too but\ni think it's important to acknowledge\nthat it's not like once you leave the\ndanger zone like you're free of danger\nthat even when you go somewhere else\nthere's a foreign language there may be\nforeign people there may be foreign you\nknow there may be racism or other issues\nand but that these people essentially\nlost everything so they lost family\nthey lost friends\nthey lost you know\nhomes\nthey left pictures behind memories\nthey got separated from people so\nthese people have been through something\njust incredibly incredibly challenging\nso i'm gonna just share a quick quote\num\nso we're gonna just go down to page\nthree\nso\nhow can you feel hopeful\nwhen you don't know where to go you\ndon't know for what to go\nwe were just not human i was so broken\ndown after we were liberated more than\nbeing in the concentration camps i\nsuffered emotional i missed my oldest\nsister with her little boy whom i loved\ni missed my friend this was my first\nlove in my youth when we were liberated\ni said where should i go why should i\nlive\nthe interesting thing is that people\nalso expressed in addition to feeling\nhopeless people expressed gratitude for\nbeing alive and free\nso we were maybe more enthusiastic than\nbefore the war because to go through\nsuch pains and hunger and all kinds of\ntroubles for those years\nall of a sudden you became a human being\nagain and you have everything you need\njust not to breathe the german air was\ngreat we lived in a group home that the\njewish agency provided we had no clothes\nbut our needs were so limited we were\njust glad to be free and breathe and no\none to tell you what to do\nso\nand\nwe'll kind of get to this\nin a second but i think that's going to\nbe a common theme for today and\nhopefully that doesn't rub people the\nwrong way you know we're always open to\nyour feedback but i think it's normal\nfor people to feel\nhopeless and confused\nin these situations not know where\nthey're supposed to go or why they\nshould go anywhere or why they should\ncontinue living\nand at the same time like after you sort\nof work through that for a little while\nor live through that\nmany people\ni would even say the majority of people\nare even able to find light and hope and\nand some sense of relief and joy and to\nbe able to rebuild lives after the end\nof it\nso here's one of the key things that the\nstudy found\nthe first step to overcoming trauma is\nsafety\nso when we think about emotional\nprocessing doing this kind of work like\nyou know\nmaking meaning we'll kind of get to all\nthese other steps\nbut one of the things that's been borne\nout in research over and over and over\nagain is like all that crap comes later\nthe first thing that you need is to be\nsafe and you can't really do any of the\nwork of\ntrauma processing as long as you're in\nan unsafe situation\nand this is where unfortunately there\nhave been a couple of studies that have\nshown that like intensive psychological\ndebriefing\nin the midst of trauma\nhas actually had some detrimental\neffects\nso we'll talk about trauma processing a\nlittle bit later so trauma processing\nfrom psychotherapists for example can be\nhelpful or harmful and that's a whole\ndifferent discussion\nbut essentially prior to reconstruction\nprior to remembrance\nand prior to reconnection\nwhich are sort of the steps in one model\nof trauma processing so the first is we\nhave to make sense of the event\nand then this also involves like\nrebuilding our lives to a certain degree\nright moving to a new country\nmaking social connections we'll kind of\nget to that in a second so we have to\nreconstruct our our lives and both\ninternally and externally the next thing\nthat we have to do is remember in some\nways so this is the process of mourning\nacceptance\nletting go\nand this can be incredibly difficult\nright so if we think about holocaust\nsurvivors for example like\nthey're never going to get to go to\ntheir home again right the home that\nthey grew up in presumably and we don't\nreally know if that's ever going to\nhappen and then finally what we sort of\nwant in terms of trauma processing is\nreconnection so this is when we sort of\nform relationships\nwe kind of fully reconnect with life\nand hopefully at this point we're able\nto live a completely normal and\nfulfilling life\nbut you can't do any of these things in\nan unsafe environment\nso this is where like safety has to come\nfirst\nand this is where unfortunately like\neven in the post-war environments as we\nsort of already mentioned\njust because you're out of the immediate\ndanger zone doesn't mean that you're\nnecessarily safe there can be concerns\nabout shelter there can be concerns\nabout racism physical violence sexual\nviolence\num so safety has to come first so the\nfirst thing is you know try to be safe\nand don't worry about trauma processing\nor anything like that like you you just\nsafety absolutely comes first\nthis also goes for anyone out there\nwho's kind of struggling and feeling\nunsafe in terms of suicidal thoughts or\nhurting someone else you know i strongly\nencourage you to as best as you can get\nsome kind of support over that\nand safety really does come first\nso this is kind of interesting\nso\nafter looking at that the next thing\nthat\npeople sort of noticed\nis that\num\nwhat people need next is community\nso\nhere uh here's a kind of another quote\nthat we're going to share so these are\nthree people that they interviewed judah\nrivka and ruth clearly articulate these\ngroup living arrangements is an attempt\nto recreate family\nafter such a test we went through\neverybody was happy to be alive even\nthough that life had not too much\nmeaning without families but we had so\nmany friends who were in the same\nsituation\nwe somehow lived together and got close\nvery seldom that somebody had a family a\nfather a mother or brothers they were\nall single survivors or maybe two\nbrothers from one family that survived\nor something like that\nthen this is how we got back on track of\nliving\nwhat happens when you have no family you\nform families and a lot of people\nstarted eating together and it's a\nnormal life but it's it's not a normal\nlife but it's the best you can do\nlike communes\ni had no family but i made family\nsurvivors need to be among their own\npeople for support in the early recovery\nperiod but this did not necessarily\nhelp the grieving process so we'll kind\nof get into that in a second\nbut this is where the second thing that\npeople need is community\nand this is why actually i'm really\nproud of like our community\nso um you know when people post on our\nsubreddit and things like that it's like\ni don't want to underestimate like the\nvalue of those kinds of things like i\nknow it feels small and i know it feels\ninsignificant i'm gonna tear up a little\nbit but\num\nyou know but like i think that these\nthings do matter and like the research\nactually suggests that\nit's not\ndeep trauma processing with a\ntraumatologist that these people need\nright away the first thing that they\nneed is to be safe and the second thing\nthat they need is like a sense of\ncommunity and a sense of family\nand we're gonna kind of show a couple of\nother quotes about that but like this is\nincredibly important when it comes to\nmental health\nit's more than the treatment of mental\nillness like there are some very very\nbasic things that human beings need in\norder for their mental health to be like\ngood\nright and one of those core things is\nlike connection with other human beings\nand so we see this with holocaust\nsurvivors it'll be a theme throughout\nthe day and it's something that i hope\nour community can provide\ni'm not saying that it's any substitute\nfor certainly not mental health\ntreatment and certainly not family\nbut like in whatever way we can\nwe should support the members of our\ncommunity i know it may feel\ninsignificant\nbut this is the kind of thing we'll talk\nabout this towards the end as well about\nsort of like cumulative risk factors and\ncumulative protective factors where we\ndon't really know what's going to help\nor what may be insignificant but like as\nbest as we can as a community we need to\nsupport people who are struggling\nand try to be there for them um because\nthe truth is that community actually\ndoes matter quite a lot\nso\num\nso this is also where\neven\neven when it comes to sort of dealing\nwith like the post-traumatic experiences\nthere\nthe this paper sort of talks a little\nbit about how people like\nuh i'll just kind of read this but i\nknow that\nby that time i had nobody left i'm alone\nexcept for my cousins we tried to keep\nbusy but because i had no nobody i\nbecame very hard i didn't leave my\nemotions that i should cry to someone\nbecause they all lost family i wasn't\nthe only one they were in the same\nsituation so we tried not to grieve you\nknow but separately in my heart i did\nso perhaps um\nso it is hard to ascertain from rivka's\naccount whether her decision to grieve\nseparately in her heart rather than\nshare her emotions with other survivors\nwho were\nalso grieving from within or from\nobserving how others\naround her were behaving perhaps it was\na little bit of both so we tried not to\ngrieve seems to imply an unspoken group\nnorm\nso this is where um\nyou know it's it's kind of interesting\nbecause like people weren't necessarily\nactively\ngoing through the grieving process it\nwas um something that they\nuh\nyou know it was something that they sort\nof formed a community and sometimes kind\nof talked about\nand sometimes sort of didn't talk about\nuh they also formed displaced person\ncommunities\nso this was sort of\num you know as they like these are\nalmost like refugee camps or things like\nthat like places where they had\nhospitals and and where people sort of\ngot together in this community aspect\nwas really really like an important part\nof their healing and their growth and\ntheir coping\nuh interesting thing here is that once\nagain they didn't explicitly\num\ntalk about\nemotions very much\nwhich we'll sort of see as a theme\nand in my experience kind of trauma\nprocessing doesn't need to be forced it\nsort of happens at its own\npace so this is where things get a\nlittle bit tricky so the other important\nlike coping strategy that people used\nwas actually like\nanger\ndealing with injustice\nand what i'm going to actually do is\ninstead of just quoting this i'm going\nto move this over here so i can write at\nthe same time\nso\nthis is where\num\npeople\nanother way that people do cope\nis by\nsort of like getting angry so they're\nthey're you know there are instances\nwhere when dealing with issues of racism\npeople would sort of like or\nanti-semitism people would kind of lash\nout there are also cases uh in this\nqualitative interview\nof of\nsome of the trauma survivors engaging in\nviolent behavior\num\nwe don't really advocate for that and\neven the authors of the paper sort of\nsuggest that engaging in violent\nbehavior against um\nother people who are maybe being\nanti-semitic or racist may be a\nshort-term coping strategy but probably\ndoesn't lead to like long-term\nimprovement\nso this is where um\nyou know anger can sort of be productive\nor unproductive so let me just read\nanother kind of quote here\ni'm going to try to steer clear of\nshowing this stuff on stream\nso the agency and anger expressed by\nsurvivors after the war were channeled\nin both productive and non-productive\nways\nanger was taken to the extreme\nby a few people\num\nso\nand some people sort of\nfound that like even doing small things\nlike stealing from their oppressors or\nthings like that helped them kind of\ncope and get a sense of justice\num so the researchers sort of suggest\nthat i would hypothesize that such acts\nwere only temporary salves for their\nwounds\nthey may have been effective as\nshort-term coping strategies but there's\nlittle evidence to suggest that these\nmen are at peace with themselves in the\nlong term as a result of their actions\nso\nthere's and this is where\nwhat we're going to talk a little bit\nabout now is like forgiveness so this is\nwhere\nin trauma theory\nthere's sometimes an emphasis for\nforgiveness that in order to let go and\nprocess your trauma\nin order to accept what you kind of have\nto do is forgive right so like the good\nthing to do it's like healthy\nto forgive\nokay\nso forgiveness is a key part\nand like\neven in terms of some trauma group some\ntrauma groups will have kind of anger\nmanagement components\nwhere we encourage people to forgive to\naccept\nand that moving past your anger is like\nan important part of this\nreconstitution of a healthy identity\nit's important to point out though that\nthis is like somewhat disputed and that\nother clinicians actually don't believe\nthat forgiveness is necessary\nin fact some clinicians will argue that\nforgiveness is actually unattainable in\na very practical sense\nso if we're thinking about you know\nwar-related atrocities or physical\nviolence emotional violence sexual\nviolence\nit can actually be quite toxic\nto\ntry to get someone to forgive\nso there are some downsides to\nforgiveness so sometimes in the process\nof forgiveness what we actually do is\nexacerbate\nfeelings of low self-worth\nand you'll see this if if people kind of\nget pressured to forgive\nright because then like what happens\nlike i've seen this a lot unfortunately\nin unh healthy family situations\nwhere people will be like pressured to\nforgive right oh like it was a mistake\nthey've learned their lesson like you\nshould forgive so that the family can\nmove on and heal\nand so what happens is that there's sort\nof this burden placed on the victim of\nforgiving and if they're not able to\nthen like the family is the family unit\nsuffers\nand and like this kind of thing can\nactually be like bad right because\nwhat it can sort of if if i'm not able\nto forgive let's say that i was abused\nby you know\na parent or uncle or something like that\nphysically emotionally whatever\nand and so then if i'm not able to\nforgive i start to think like lower of\nmyself like oh why can't i forgive\neveryone is saying i should forgive i\nshould be able to forgive because\nthere's this camp up here right which is\nsaying that oh the way to move on with\nyour life is to forgive and so some\nclinicians have actually found and i\nkind of fall into this camp as well that\nforgiveness is not a necessary part i\nthink acceptances\nbut that forgiveness is is purely no one\nis entitled to forgiveness\nit's it's purely\nthe person who is the victim gets to\ndecide that's personally where i kind of\nstand\num the other thing is that people may\nnot be able to\nright so depending on what's done to you\ni'm not so sure that someone who's\nfleeing the ukraine right now will ever\nbe able to forgive someone who's taken\naway family members homes etc right like\nthey may not be able to it's not like\nhuman beings don't have an endless\ncapacity to forgive very practically\nspeaking now if you want to talk about\non the spiritual sense and things like\nthat maybe there is a you could make an\nargument that\nto grow as a human being you should have\nyou know\nthe closer you get to endless\nforgiveness the more\npositive of a person you become\nbut i don't know that\num\ni don't know that that's necessarily\ntrue from like a scientific perspective\nor a trauma healing perspective\nthe last reason uh that we want to so\nforgiveness the last kind of thing is\nthat sometimes it's actually very\ndisempowering\nfor the victim\nright so like\nit's kind of interesting here but\num\nyou know\nso like\nyou can sometimes disempower the\nsurvivor while having the effect of like\nempowering the perpetrator\nright because if like if you sort of are\nforced to forgive or you end up\nforgiving then you're kind of like\nwiping that away in a sense\num the other person sort of gets to walk\naway from it they're kind of feeling\ngood about themselves there are several\npapers that have sort of talked about\nthis\nthe point here at least for the purpose\nof this kind of lecture\nis that forgiveness can be good and it\ncan not be good and this is where trauma\nis like very complicated right there are\nindividual circumstances individual\npeople with different personality traits\ndifferent coping mechanisms\nand should you for consider forgiveness\nabsolutely do you need to accept\nand reintegrate what has happened to you\ninto your life absolutely but do you\nneed to forgive not necessarily\nand so i you know i think that's where\nlike it's complicated and it's nuanced\nand there isn't a simple answer that dr\nk can give you on in a lecture\nand that the desire to forgive or the\nneed to forgive or the need not to\nforgive\nis something that you as an individual\nneed to decide and the good news is that\nboth roads can lead to healing\npresuming you kind of do it\nwell enough\nokay\nthe last thing is a sense of justice\nso this is what i thought was really\ninteresting about the paper is that what\nthey sort of focused on were things that\nwere like ultimately like non-clinical\nin terms of coping strategies so some\npeople\num you know some people who were\nsurvivors like really really like felt\nthat a part of their healing process\nwas watching the nuremberg trials\nuh you know some people took things into\ntheir own hands which we don't advocate\nfor at all so i i personally don't\nadvocate for violence in pretty much any\ncase but i think that the pursuit of\njustice is like a completely different\nmatter\nright so when when there are\nare institutions and rules that we\nshould abide by to sort of get justice\nthat that's totally fine\nand so a lot of people did feel a sense\nof closure and kind of like completion\nwith\nuh\nthrough things like the nuremberg trials\nand so\nthe last thing that i kind of want to\ntalk a little bit about was\nhope\num\nso i'm going to read this quote to y'all\ngenerally the survivors were full of\nhope regarding their new lives\nthose who were married were eager to\nstart in a new land the rest with the\nexception of ruth who was all alone had\nsome surviving family members with whom\nthey could emigrate\nmany the survivor's first choice was\nisrael but wasn't always possible\nso here are a couple of quotes we wanted\nto go anywhere just get away from\ngermany and when my wife became pregnant\ni said uh-oh\nnow i'm the father of a child not yet\nborn and to go to palestine was already\ntoo dangerous i'm not responsible only\nfor myself i'm now responsible for a\nwife and child so then we registered for\namerica\ni wish we had gone to israel but we\ncouldn't i did not want to go illegal in\nany way and also i didn't want to go\ninto another war we would have gone on\nthe exodus you know\nbut my husband and sisters here we went\nto america\nand um\nsome of the survivors adjusted quite\nquickly to the new life in america and\ncanada i was young i didn't mind going i\nwas happy and when i came to america i\nfelt really very good i felt free it's a\nfree country and i felt wonderful here\nit was tough but it was paradise you\nknow nobody was trying to kill you you\nalways had something to wear something\nto eat i mean it's a haven\nand so the the key thing here is like\nwe don't\ni know that things can feel really\nhopeless\nbut i think we can sort of acknowledge\nthat the holocaust is one of the most\ngrueling things that people have had to\nlive through\nand that people can come out the other\nend with hope\nand that presumably as people sort of\nengaged in safety in community\nto a certain degree\nkind of managing their anger\nand seeking justice that at the end of\nthe day\nyou know hope is possible\nrebuilding a life is possible\nand i know that if you're someone who's\nkind of caught in the middle of a\ntraumatic situation that the mind looks\nat our current situation and kind of\nexpects the worse predicts the worst\nthat's sort of a survival mechanism\nright so as human beings we have to\nthink about worst case scenarios it's\nwhat our brains are kind of designed to\ndo in order to protect us\nand at the same time just because your\nbrain is thinking about a worst case\nscenario doesn't necessarily mean that\nthat thing is going to happen\nand this is where i've just seen\ntime and time again like how resilient\nthe human spirit can be\nso the next paper we're going to talk\nabout is a little bit different\nso this is a paper that's looking at let\nme tell you all the exact population\nso\nthis is a paper that looks at civilians\nduring the air attacks of yugoslavia in\n1999\num so this is a paper that we're going\nto kind of cover very briefly that talks\nabout coping strategies\nfor\num\nthat people use so now if we have a\ntraumatic event\nokay\nwhat people sort of\nlook at is if i have a traumatic event\ndo i develop ptsd\nand the answer is that in here there's\nall kinds of stuff right so even with a\nshared event if we have one traumatic\nevent we may\ndevelop ptsd for this person but not for\nthis person so you could go this way or\nyou could go this way and what's the\ndifference and it turns out that how you\ncope\nis a really really important part of the\ndevelopment of psychiatric symptoms or\nnot necessarily even a clinical\ndiagnosis but\nhow you manage and how what your life\nends up being has a lot to do with\ncoping so what i'm going to do today is\ntalk a little bit about\ncoping\nand\nsort of what some people sort of\ndiscovered\nso the first is that so when they were\nlooking at the yugoslav\nyugoslavia air attacks\num\nin 1999 what they found is that\ndifferent people and we'll kind of talk\na little bit more about this but that\ndifferent people use different primary\ncoping strategies so there were a bunch\nof different coping strategies people\nused like\nhumor\ntalking with each other\nthey even used leisure activities\nuh so there are like eight or nine\ndifferent coping strategies that people\nused\nbut what we're gonna sort of do and this\nis gonna\nis zero in on a couple of those so\none group used predominantly leisure\nactivities\nand what we sort of found here is that\npeople who use predominantly leisure\nactivities\nhad um\nsort of had a low amount of intrusive\nthoughts\nso this is a correlation so this is\nsomething that was studied after the\nfact which is important to understand\nand that people who spent a lot of time\ntalking\ndebriefing discussing what they had gone\nthrough had a higher level of intrusive\nthoughts\nthe other thing that's important here is\nthat some of these effects are also\nmodified by gender so whether you go\nthis like so when you have a traumatic\nevent\nand use coping strategy one\nand you are\nmale\nversus\nfemale\nversus coping strategy number two\nif you are male versus female you\nactually get different effects\nso this can lead to you know a positive\nthing or a negative thing this can lead\nto a negative thing or a positive thing\nand the reason that we i sort of\nhighlight this is just because like this\njust goes to show that like trauma is\nnot simple it's not as simple as okay\nfor a given traumatic event if i do this\nthen i will be fine versus doing this as\nbad\nright there there are all kinds of\ndifferent variables that go into this\nwhich we'll sort of present in more\ndetail later\nthe other thing that's important to\nremember about studies like this is\nthese are correlational\nso for if we say that people who\num engaged in leisure activities had\nfewer intrusive thoughts does that mean\nthat leisure activities\nreduce so question for you to a chat\ndoes this mean that\nleisure activities reduce\nintrusive thoughts\ndoes that mean that talking increases\nintrusive thoughts\nno absolutely not right so this is where\ncorrelation does not imply causation\nwhich is something that i find\nthe majority of the world doesn't really\nappreciate so what this could mean\nis that the people who had fewer\nintrusive thoughts\nwere maybe more able to engage in\nleisure activities and maybe the people\nwho had more intrusive thoughts\nwere the ones who were like kind of\nforced to talk about it more right\nso correlations don't necessarily imply\ncausation which is a really really\nimportant point that's really what i\nwanted to illustrate here so when even\nwhen we're talking about some of this\nresearch you know as i'm drawing\nconclusions or as i'm sort of drawing\nconclusions for you all i want to make\nsure that\nwe're all on the same page that these\nthese conclusions are like very\npreliminary in nature and we shouldn't\nread too much into them\nso this paper also sort of sets up some\nof these details which now i'm going to\ntalk about in more\num detail here\nso what i'd like to share\nkind of towards the end is a perspective\non how to think about trauma\nso here's what i sort of want to point\nout so this is a study that looked at\nbosnian adolescence and i think it may\nbe 555 people in bosnia\nand so what we sort of discover is\nthere's a traumatic event\nso this is kind of the cycle of trauma\nand then after a traumatic event we have\npost-war\nstressors based on the post-war\nstressors we employ\ncoping strategies\nright so different kinds of things can\nhappen to you after a traumatic\ntraumatic event\nand then based on the coping strategies\nthat we use for the stressor that we\ndeal with we can sort of end up with a\ncertain way of gauging stress response\nso this is kind of the outcome\nokay\nso actually i'm going to go ahead and\nmove this around a little bit because i\nthink i'm going to need more space\nso people ask how do i deal with trauma\nokay if someone asks the question how do\ni deal with trauma\nthis is where i'd say like this is why\nit's complicated this is why working\nwith a professional can be really really\ngood\nright because it's not as simple as oh i\nshould do this or i should do this or i\nshould do this and at the same time i\nthink it is important why isn't\none okay\nokay sorry about that so\nthis is where like it kind of gets\ncomplicated but i love to illustrate\nthis for y'all\nso this is a paper that looked at\num\nlet's just define our population because\nthis is really important too\nso this paper looked at\npredicting adolescent post-traumatic\nstress in the aftermath of war\nand the population they looked at as the\nvast majority of youth who lived through\nthe bosnian war were exposed to multiple\ntraumatic events including interpersonal\nviolence community destruction and the\nloss of a loved one this study examined\nfactors that predict post-war\npsychological adjustment\nspecifically post-traumatic stress in\nbosnian adolescence okay\nso the first thing that this paper sort\nof realizes is that after a traumatic\nevent there are different kinds of\ntriggers that people have\nso the first is trauma reminders\nthe second is loss reminders\nokay\nand the third is\nwhat we call secondary adversities\nand these are things like family\nconflict\nokay\nso what this sort of means is that like\nafter a war if we really think about\nwhat do we have to deal with as a human\nbeing like what happens in our\npsychology\nlike it's not just that initial event\nright it's all of the other things that\nhappen after that so one thing that this\nthis paper sort of highlights and other\npapers have approved this is that\nsensory experiences\nare strong triggers\nas opposed to\nlike\nmemory\nso what does this mean or kind of visual\nstuff\nwhat this means is that the the strong\ntrauma reminders the things that really\ninvoke that kind of trauma memory\nare like deeply sensory experiences so\nthese are things like smells\nsounds\nso i've seen this a lot where um you\nknow when i work with like post-war\nveterans\nwhat i find is that like\nit's like noises like car mufflers going\noff\nuh doors slamming that really remind\nthem of like gunshots or explosive\ndevices or things like that and that's\nactually what really kind of like\ntriggers them\nso interestingly enough what the paper\nfound is that\nyou know watching stuff on tv like\nseeing pictures of like\nyour country is not as triggering as\nlike a particular smell or a particular\nsound or things like that okay\nso the second thing that uh people they\nsort of talked about is loss reminders\nso this is like pictures of loved ones\nor like activities that you used to do\nso if if i lost you know a parent in the\nwar and we used to go fishing when i go\nfishing that sort of counts as a loss\nreminder\nand so these are the different things\nthat can kind of like trigger\nyou know some kind of traumatic response\nsome kind of traumatic stress\nand remember based on this trigger there\nare different coping strategies and\nwe'll sort of see how different coping\nstrategies result in like alterations\nand the stress response\nthe last thing is family conflict so\nthis is really really big\nso\nincreased responsibility this one is\nhuge\nso a lot of times what happened with\nthese bosnian war survivors is you had\nadolescents who were thrust into a role\nof responsibility for the family i'm a\n16 year old kid who suddenly now is like\nthe man of the household right so dad is\nno longer around so i have to step up\ni'm responsible for physical protection\ni'm responsible for financial protection\ni'm responsible for all kinds of things\nand so there's a large sense of burden\nand this is incredibly stressful\nin terms of like creating you know\nstress responses\nso what we sort of find in terms of\nstress responses is people will measure\nhyper arousal so these are different\nthings that we'll measure for ptsd\nremember that just because you have some\nof these things does not necessarily\nmean that you have ptsd ptsd is a\nclinical diagnosis so even in this paper\nwhat they're sort of doing is looking at\nattributes that may be parts of the\nstress response which may or may not\ndirectly link to a diagnosis\nso hyperarousal\navoidance\nre-experiencing\nthat's like a flashback\nand numbing\nand so the key thing here about this\npaper this is what's really cool about\nit\nis if you're trying to figure out like\nokay if i've had a traumatic event and\nthese are my triggers\nwhat predicts whether hyperarousal is\nhigh or low what predicts whether\navoidance is high or low what predicts\nwhether re-experiencing is high or low\nwhat predicts whether my feeling of\nnumbness is high or low it turns out\nthat there's a variable amount of coping\nstrategies so there's variation in what\nkind of coping strategy you employ that\ncorrelates with like how your stress\nresponse is\nokay\nso let's talk about\ncoping\nso\nuh do i do this here let me do this here\nso in terms of coping\nwe're gonna divide\ncoping strategies into a couple of\nbuckets\nokay\nthe first is\nengaging\ncoping strategies and the second is\ndisengaging coping strategies\nso disengaging coping strategies include\ndenial\navoidance\nor wishful thinking\nokay\nso when we experience something bad\nwe can cope\nby disengaging from the bad thing so i'm\ngonna like pretend it's not real\nit's not real it's not real it's not\nreal i can avoid the thing entirely\nright so i even i experience this i'm\nnot saying that what i've gone through\nis anywhere near what bosnian war\nrefugees have gone through but i\nremember personally like doing my best\nto avoid going to spanish class not\nchecking my email not looking at my\nsyllabus when i was failing out right so\nthis is like goes\napplies to serious trauma but also the\nsmall struggles we have in life\nsometimes what we also do is wishful\nthinking so a large group of of our\ncommunity is very concerned about\nmaladaptive daydreaming\nso we've talked about maladaptive\ndaydreaming i think we have a video on\nyoutube about it um there's also the\nfantasy trap from dr k's guide which\nsort of goes into this so but that's\nabsolutely a coping strategy right is to\ndisengage from the thing that's\nbothering you\nnow in terms of engaging coping\nstrategies there are two types the first\nis a primary coping strategy\nin which we directly\nreact\nto what we feel\nand then there's a secondary coping\nstrategy\nin which we adapt\nto what we feel\nnow this may sound kind of the same but\nwe'll kind of go into more details\nbut like when we experience something\nemotionally like we have reactions to it\nright so if i'm feeling something\nemotionally i can use emotional\nexpression\ni can literally vent my feelings\nokay\ni can use problem solving to a certain\ndegree this kind of confuses me a little\nbit but it's classified as a primary\ncoping mechanism\nand then we can also use emotional\nregulation strategies\nso i think the key thing here is these\nare like direct ways to react to what's\ngoing on internally\nthen the adaptive the secondary coping\nstrategies are adaptive in nature so\nthat's like not necessarily dealing with\nthe emotion but how do i integrate this\nemotion into the rest of my life so this\ninvolves more cognitive stuff this\ninvolves like acceptance\nthis involves things like cognitive\nrestructuring\nthis is like making meaning or finding\nmeaning\nout of what happens to you\nthis also includes distraction and i\nthink there's like some confusion here\nbetween like avoidance and distraction\nbut remember that like avoidance is sort\nof\nsubconscious\ndistraction is like intentional right so\nif i am having a rough day at work i can\nsort of like say okay\nyou know what i'm gonna like take a\nbreak from work and for in an hour i'm\ngonna intentionally like play elden ring\ni'm gonna play lost ark whereas\navoidance is sort of like mindlessly\ngoing into games and stuff and like\nwatching youtube or whatever and like\njust avoiding the whole problem whereas\ndistraction is sort of an intentional\nadaptation\nokay\nand the two are very different like you\nmay think like okay but can you play\ngames and that's why like gaming for\nexample can be a healthy coping\nmechanism or an unhealthy coping\nmechanism and sometimes people will ask\nthe question okay how do i know if\ngaming is a healthy coping mechanism or\nunhealthy coping mechanism there are\nlots of answers to that question but\nwhat i really love about this\nformulation of trauma stress response\ntriggers and coping is that we can draw\nthe distinction between the\nintentionality of gaming are you using\nit actively as an adaptation are you\nusing it as a way of disengaging\nokay\nso\nwhat we sort of discover is that based\non what you do\nfor one of these things the coping\nstrategy you employ\nactually results in different symptoms\nokay or different like levels of stress\nresponse so let's take a look at this\nso\nif you have a trauma reminder like you\nhave um\nuh\na\num\nlike let's say i smell something right\nand if i use a primary\nengaging\ncoping mechanism\nthis is remember this is like\nemotional expression\nregulation\nokay\nor regulation what this does is\nessentially like\nimprove just about everything okay so\nthis this is going to lead to\nimprovements in all of these four\ncategories okay\nuh yeah i think so\nso we sort of see this in terms of like\nsensory grounding and mindfulness right\nso like when i have someone who is\nreally really struggling and emotionally\nvery activated we know that engaging in\nmindfulness techniques which is sort of\ndirectly dealing with our emotions\nregulating our emotions we know that for\nexample mindfulness techniques can\naffect our sympathetic tone so the\namount of adrenaline that's flowing\nthrough our body\nthat this actually has positive effects\ni think on all four of these dimensions\nwe may be missing one dimension\nthe interesting thing is that secondary\num\nsecondary\nengaging\nso this is\nadaptation\nso if we try to like make sense of\nthings\ncognitive release restructure accept\nwhat's going on\nthis has positive effects on everything\nexcept for avoidance\nso this is where we get a positive here\nwe get a positive here\nwe get a positive here okay\nthe problem is that um\nlet me just make sure so hyperarousal\nyeah so everything except for avoidance\nso it seems like you know primarily\nengaging can help us with avoidance but\nsecondary engaging adaptations may not\nactually do that\nand then the third thing that we've got\nis disengagement\nand what it looks like is that\ndisengagement basically doesn't help\nwith anything so disengagement actually\nmakes things worse\nin all dimensions\nokay\nand so this is where it's it's kind of\nlike interesting but so what we can sort\nof take away from this is if we're\nthinking about okay let's say that\nyou've been through a traumatic event\nand you're trying to figure out how\nshould i cope what are good coping\nstrategies and the key thing that i want\nyou all to take away from this is that\nlike coping is a complicated process\nright so coping involves first of all\nlike recognizing that there are\ndifferent triggers\nand that the way that we respond to\nthose triggers will ultimately determine\nlike our final stress stress response\nand that there isn't\nyou know a good coping strategy or like\nthere's not an ideal coping strategy and\nthis is precisely why like if you have\nbeen through a traumatic experience you\nshould work with a trained professional\nif you can\num it because this is where like trained\nprofessionals recognize this why you go\nto a professional is because like they\nrecognize that okay not all of these\nthree things are the same the actual\nwork with trauma involves\nideally a clinician sort of going\nthrough this stuff and sort of trying to\nfigure out okay what are your triggers\nwhat are the different coping strategies\nwe can use right so in psychotherapy you\nmay like have an adaptation or make\nsense of it\nman's search for meaning\nwhich is a book written by viktor frankl\nwho is a holocaust survivor i think is\njust like an epic\nversion of a secondary engaging coping\nmechanism right so he like made sense of\nthe world\nand this is where you know i think like\nyou can use the evidence sort of\nsuggests that\nyou just need some kind of framework\nit's not that one framework is better\nthan another framework so the framework\nthat i tend to use is a very karmic\nframework it's sort of like recognizing\nthat you know your actions have\nconsequences and that things that happen\nto you happen for a reason and how can\nwe make sense of this it's not to say\nthat necessarily that the theory of\nkarma is true it's not about it being\nright or wrong it's about it being\nfunctional so some people will use\nstoicism some people will use religion\nsome people will use psychology the main\nthing is not that you that one kind of\nadaptive\nmodel\nis\nlike better than the others it's that\nyou as an individual need to figure out\nlike what is the adaptive model you want\nto use what makes sense to you about the\nworld do you want to take a karmic\napproach do you want to take a stoic\napproach do you want to take a you know\nlike\nbody keeps the score scientific approach\ndo you want to lean on religious\ntraditions do you want to lean on family\ntraditions like you know\nhow do you want to manage this\nbut at the end of the day it seems like\nthe you know the three major options for\ncoping strategies are\nto react to our emotions or deal with\nour emotions in sort of a reactive way\nlike how do we emotionally regulate how\ndo we emotionally express how do we\nsolve problems around the emotional\nthings that we have\nthe there's a secondary type of\nengagement which is how do we adapt to\nwhat we experience how do we make sense\nof things how do we cognitively\nrestructure how do we determine what\nthis means for me in my life am i so a\ngood example of this is like i think\ncancer survivors do this\nthe oncology does this really well with\ncancer survivors where like we sort of\ntalk about being a cancer survivor or a\ntrauma survivor is like a part of our\nidentity right we make it a part of our\nidentity and then we start doing\nfundraising and we start supporting\nother people who have cancer and things\nlike that so that's like an example of\nlike a secondary engaging coping\nmechanism where i'm gonna adapt to this\ni'm gonna make it a part of who i am and\nlike that's okay like it doesn't have to\neven though it becomes a part of my\nidentity it doesn't have to be like a\nbad thing in my identity we see that as\nwell with trauma survivors as well\nas they engage in peer support services\nas they you know as as you have these\nrefugees these jewish refugees that are\ncoming from germany to the united states\nand canada you have local people who are\njewish who will then like support those\npeople and then like you know as you as\na trauma survivor begin to heal you\nstart to support other people and that's\nwhere this sort of adaptation comes in\nand the last option is we do have\ndisengaging\npossibilities right we have avoidance we\nhave denial we have wishful thinking and\nthose tend to exacerbate or not do very\nwell in terms of like managing the\nstress response\nthis too is something that i don't\nnecessarily think that just because\nthese are not great for you in the\nmoment doesn't mean that you can't\nemploy them\nso as a clinician what i would say is\nthat like you know you have to start\nwhere where you are and the process of\ntaking unhealthy coping mechanisms and\ndeveloping healthy coping mechanisms is\nlike challenging and kind of an uphill\nbattle it can absolutely be done but be\npatient with yourself right don't just\nbeat yourself up if you're using\ndisengaging coping mechanisms\nso just to kind of summarize\num i know we were supposed to stream\nelden ring today\nbut i felt like\nin light of everything that's going on\nand some of the messages that i've seen\nfrom our community i just didn't really\nfeel like\nplaying games on stream today\num\nand instead what i tried to do very\nbriefly is talk a little bit about\nwhat we understand from post-war\nstudies of people who have been through\ntraumatic events\nso a couple of key key takeaways the\nfirst is that\nby doing deep qualitative research with\nholocaust survivors we recognize that\nthere are four major aspects to coping\nthe first is that you need to be safe\nso none of the work of processing can\nreally happen\nyou can't really\nreconstruct you can't remember and you\ncan't reconnect unless you're safe\nthe second thing is that community is\nincredibly important right so if people\nare trying to figure out what should i\ndo\njust first of all try to get safe\nsecondly like try to engage in some kind\nof community driven activity\nright so like connect with other human\nbeings don't worry about processing your\ntrauma or whatever\nthe next thing i mean you can if you\nwant to if you're ready to by all means\ngo for it next thing that's important is\nto acknowledge that anger and\nforgiveness are like an important part\nof this equation there isn't a clear\nanswer here some people like to act on\ntheir anger we don't really recommend\nthat at all\nat the same time remember that\nforgiveness is a complicated issue and\nsometimes there's a bias towards like\nforgiving being a part of the trauma\nhealing process\ni think that's true for some people but\nit doesn't have to be true for everyone\nand it's okay to not forgive\nthe last thing is seeking justice\nso this is where you know\nif we just look at the data\ngetting some kind of justice\nin terms of people who have wronged you\ncan be very healing in terms of trauma\nso to find people who have attacked you\nto you know be\nheld to justice that the nuremberg\ntrials were actually like very like\ntrauma healing for holocaust survivors\nlast thing to kind of point out is that\nwe also know from\nseveral studies that psychological\ndebriefing\ncan be helpful or hurtful depending on\nthe circumstance so we know that there's\noverwhelming evidence that therapy for\ntrauma can be very very good but we also\nhave studies that show that\npsychological debriefing especially\nimmediately after a trauma can actually\nhave the opposite effect so how should\nyou know whether you should engage in\ntherapy or not\nthat sort of depends on you and depends\non what your experience is right so if\nyou're really struggling if you're\nfeeling suicidal if you're feeling\nhopeless i strongly encourage you to go\nsee a mental health professional but\nalso don't feel obligated to see someone\nif you don't feel comfortable with it so\nmy overwhelming experience working with\ntrauma is that it should be done at the\npace of the person\nright so me as the clinician i don't\ndetermine i don't say we're gonna dig\ninto your trauma today and you dig and\nyou dig and you dig no like you let the\nperson decide and dictate what happens\nso if you feel like you're ready to see\na therapist you should absolutely go do\nthat if you feel like you're not quite\nready that's totally fine too\nit doesn't hurt to get an evaluation\nnext thing that we sort of talked about\nis that there are differential effects\nof coping mechanisms that depending on\nwhat you're dealing with how you respond\nto it can affect\nthe stress response that you experience\nso we talked a little bit about leisure\nactivities versus processing we talked a\nlittle bit about correlation versus\ncausation so we also have to be careful\nbecause just because we demonstrate that\na particular coping activity such as\nleisure activity as opposed to talking\nabout it\nleads to less experiencing of kind of\nstress related stuff\nmay not mean that i should just try to\nhave fun right because that there could\nbe a chicken or egg problem there where\nthe reason that people are able to\nengage in leisure activities is because\nthey've sort of processed their trauma a\nlittle bit better already\nthe last thing that we talked about and\nthis i thought is really really\ninteresting is a model\nfor understanding how to cope with\ndifferent trauma and there are a couple\nof important parts to this model the\nfirst is that after a traumatic event\nthe actual\npost-war stressors can be varied so some\npeople may experience a particular kind\nof stressor other people may experience\na different kind of stressor so in\nlooking at bosnian adolescence we found\nthat some people experience very very\nlike sensory trauma triggers whereas\nother people experience a large sense of\nburden and family conflict like oh my\ngod i have to take care of my family now\nand that sort of made them\nit made it difficult to sleep it made it\nmake them made them more avoidant it\nmade them feel numb\nso the kinds of things that you\nexperience are going to be\nindividualized\nfurthermore that coping strategies are\nnot all the same that we have\nengaging coping strategies which involve\nprimary engagement which is sort of\ndivine defined as reacting to emotion so\nemotional regulation emotional\nexpression\nto a certain degree emotional problem\nsolving so that's like directly reacting\nto what you feel and we have adaptive\ncoping strategies which are sort of like\nnot directly reacting to it but making\nsense of it and integrating it into\nother parts of your life so these\ninclude things like cognitive\nrestructuring acceptance and other like\nmore global stuff right it's like micro\nversus macro coping strategy\nand then we also have disengaging coping\nstrategies which a lot of people use\nlike avoidance denial and even like um\nwishful thinking or fantasy\nand generally speaking what we find is\nthat depending on what your problem is\nand what coping strategy you employ\nyou're going to create a different\neffect on your like stress level so how\nhyper aroused you are\nhow numb you are how much you\nre-experience how you sleep all of those\nthings are going to be a confluence of\nwhat your triggers are and what your\ncoping strategies are\nthe key thing here is that there isn't\none formula for trauma\ni wish i could say hey if you're in the\nukraine and you're fleeing right now do\na b and c and you'll be fine but i can't\nsay that i don't think anyone can say\nthat trauma in the experience of trauma\ndealing with trauma coping with trauma\nis an individualized journey that is so\ncomplicated\nat the same time i want you all to\nunderstand that there\nis a way forward right we're\nunderstanding more and more about this\njust because i can't give you an answer\nin one hour about what you should do\ndoes not mean that there is not an\nanswer out there does not mean that you\nare going to be feeling this way for the\nrest of your life does not mean that the\nworld is a hopeless place i know it\nfeels that way right now and i'm not\neven going to say that you're wrong in\nthinking that right because i can't even\nimagine what it's like to have the city\nthat i live in\nshelled\nby missiles right like i've never\nexperienced anything like that so if you\nfeel hopeless like i can only imagine\nwhat that feels like\nat the same time i want to say that\nif we really do look at the research\nthat there is hope that people of it\nthat human beings are incredibly\nresilient\nthat human beings can find a way to find\nhappiness\nand sort of reintegrate into society and\nenjoy things again right and like i\ntruly do believe that it's it's part of\nthe reason that i do the work that i do\nand the more that i do the work that i\ndo and this is kind of the weird\nparadoxical thing you know a lot of\ntimes people think it's hard to be a\npsychiatrist\nbecause like don't all of these people\nweigh you down and listening to everyone\nlike sure emotional burnout can be a\nproblem\nbut the more i've worked in this way the\nmore inspired i am by humanity and the\nmore that you really see like holy crap\nthis person has been through so much how\non earth are they able to get out of bed\nin the morning and like do anything\nand the more that i've worked with\npeople the more i've seen like honestly\nlike human beings are way more\npossess\nso much more strength and resilience\nthan like i had any idea of\nand you don't see that until you see a\nhuman being who has been tested\nand so like oddly enough i feel humbled\nand\namazed by what humans are capable of and\nit's given me hope that despite\nhow terrible of the world\nhow terrible the world can feel at times\nthat like i have hope and that doesn't\ncome from my own journeys right because\ni've had it easy for the most part in\nlife\nif i had struggles sure but nothing on\nthe order of magnitude of like holocaust\nsurvivors or what's going on in the\nukraine or like people who survived air\nraids in yugoslavia in 1999.\nand like when i talk to those people\nwhen i talk to people who are first\nresponders from 9 11 and when i talk to\npeople who have fought in the iraq and\nafghanistan war and when i work with\nthose people\nthose are the people that inspire me and\ngive me hope\nbecause i've seen it time and time and\ntime again\nso if you're out there and you're\nlistening and you're feeling hopeless i\ntotally get it it's not my place to say\nthat you shouldn't be hopeless\nand at the same time i can say that i\nhave faith that it is possible for your\nlife to be better tomorrow and that's\nsomething that i will completely stand\nbehind\nthat's it\nquestions i guess\nyeah so this is a good question\nhow should we think about our own\nstruggles\nconsidering that there are people who\nare going through a war right now i know\nit sounds kind of weird but like\ntrauma and struggling\nis not a competition\nso i've seen this unfortunately in like\nyou know trauma therapy groups that i've\nrun and stuff like that where sometimes\nthere's like a competitive nature\nand the competitive nature can be like\nbad for both people so some people will\ninvalidate their own trauma because\nsomeone else has been through worse\nand someone else will feel\nalmost arrogant because\ni have the worst trauma therefore i am\nentitled to the most compassion\ni don't think that comparison of what we\nstruggle with is useful at all\nright so like\nthe struggles you\nwhat you're dealing with is legitimate\nit doesn't it doesn't change your life\njust because someone else is struggling\nwith with something worse right so i\nmean i recognize i just made a\ncomparison because i haven't lived\nthrough that so i can acknowledge that\nbut it doesn't mean that like i'm not\ndeserving of compassion just because\nsomeone else is going through some\nsomething else worse this is where i'd\nsay that\nthe way you should think about your own\nstruggles is to like really really\nprioritize them\nbecause and i know it sounds weird but\nwhen people are going through a war this\nis where\neveryone who has it worse than you\nneeds you\nto be the best that you can so that you\ncan help them\nright if someone is like\ndrowning if you can stand on firm\nfooting and hold them\nthat's way easier that's a way better\nchance to help another human being than\nif you're treading water\nright when my feet are firmly planted on\nthe ground i can hold someone up but\nwhen i'm treading water it's so much\nharder to help another human being\nand so this is where i'd say like you\nshould prioritize your struggles i'm not\nsaying that you should do it to the\nexclusion of helping other people but\nthis is where i want you to understand\nthat you have a responsibility to the\nrest of humanity to get your in\norder\nbecause like\nwe need you\nthe human race needs you\nso get your in order as quickly as\nyou can you don't need to be ashamed\nabout it\nyou shouldn't invalidate it\nand at the same time like you need to\nget it taken care of\nso do what you need to if that involves\nseeing a therapist that involves\nmeditating every day that involves\nadjusting your diet going for long walks\njournaling\nwhatever if involves getting a job\ninvolves moving out if it involves\nbecoming financially successful\nwhatever it takes you should prioritize\nyourself first and foremost\nand as you prioritize yourself recognize\nthat the world may need you to help it\nbut as long as you're trading water you\ndon't have much to offer\nright you can offer something and that's\nwhere like even things like our\ncommunity is really important like you\ncan offer something even if you don't\nhave your stuff together you can\nabsolutely support someone else on\ndiscord you can absolutely you know play\nvideo games with someone and by the way\nthere's also a really interesting study\nthat shows that playing tetris\nafter a traumatic experience actually\ncan have positive effects in terms of\ntrauma symptoms\nright so like it could be as simple as\ngaming with your friends right who are\ngoing through a tough time like there's\na lot of ways you can support people so\ni'm not saying support other people but\ni'm it's very important to not\nde-prioritize yourself just because\nsomewhat faceless person out there is\nstruggling in their life\nthat's why we need you to get your stuff\ntogether right that's what this\ncommunity is about it's about becoming\nhealthy\nbecause like that's the only way you can\nhelp other people right like you have to\nhave capability you have to have power\nyou have to have strength you have to\nhave resilience\nthen you can help the world\ngreat question\ndoes getting involved with the mmo guild\ncount as getting involved with community\ni think to a certain degree absolutely\nright so there there's some research\nthat shows that like online communities\ncan be a healthy source of support\nand and i've even seen like i don't know\nhow true these are i've seen like you\nknow posts from 4chan and stuff about\nyou know people forming deep connections\nwith people in developing countries and\nlike playing games together and stuff\nlike that and i've heard you know i've\nheard a lot of stories about\nonline communities being toxic and being\nthe reason i'm stuck in life because i\ngot lost in my wow guild i've seen\nrelationships get destroyed through mmo\ncommunities like real life relationships\ni've seen divorces happen i've seen\nparents get frustrated i've seen people\nfail out of school because of mmo\ncommunities and i've seen the opposite\ni've seen people\nwake up every day and have something to\nlook forward to it's the one bright\npoint in their life when they're going\nthrough something bad their parents are\ngoing through a divorce\nmom or dad is an alcoholic\nit's the one safe place that i have and\nit can be both\nso like most things in life online\ncommunities are a tool\nand it is our choice\nas a community\nwhat kind of tool we want to be\nright do we want to be a health pot or\ndo we want to be a poison potion\ndo we want to engage in toxicity or do\nwe want to engage in support\nit's our choice\nit's just a tool just like anything else\nis the internet a good thing or a bad\nthing is social media good or bad tons\nof studies about negative effects of\nsocial media and social media can be a\nhuge force for good\nso it's down to\nyou right\nokay so this is a good question so\nsomeone's asking how do secondary\nengagements make disengaging stress\nresponses worse so let me clarify\nsecondary engaging responses and\ndisengaging responses are two separate\nthings\nthey don't make\nwhat they make worse is the stress\nresponse column on the far right\nso secondary engagement is adaptive\nthings so it's dealing with the thing\ndirectly\nbut in an adaptive and macro way so it's\nlike making sense of my traumatic\nexperience is a good example disengaging\nresponses is not making sense of my\ntraumatic experience it's ignoring my\ntraumatic experience entirely\nright it's like pretending it didn't\nhappen or engaging in wishful thinking\nso\ncognitive restructuring is an example of\na secondary engaging coping strategy\nand avoidance is an example oh sorry\navoidance is an outcome but denial is an\nexample of a disengaging strategy so\ncognitive restructuring and denial are\ntwo very different things\nand it seems like secondary engaging\nstrategies\nadaptive coping strategies\nare good at reducing things like\nnumbness\nor re-experiencing or things like that\nwhereas disengaging coping strategies\nseem to make the stress responses\nactually worse\ngood question\num so someone's asking do you believe\ngroup therapy is better than one-on-one\ntherapy no so i think that the two\nthings are different\nright it's like is an apple better than\na banana no they're just different\nso oftentimes when i've worked\nclinically like all\nthere'll be patients who will have group\nand individual therapy the two are just\ndifferent so it's like is eldon ring\nbetter or is lost arc better well maybe\nyou can make a\nyou know a comment you could make a\njudgment there but this is where like\nthe two are just different they can\nactually be complimentary\nuh so i'm gonna uh i'm gonna share a\nquestion that i see on on stream which\nhow can you ukrainians abroad not go mad\nworrying about their families\ni don't know\nright so this is one of the times where\ni'm just gonna say\ni don't know i have no idea\num\nyou know if you are a ukrainian and you\nare worrying about your family like\ni think that's normal\nis it driving you crazy\ni imagine\nright and so this is where i'd say like\nas best as you can lean on whoever you\ncan around you share your thoughts with\nsomeone\nso there's a there's a really important\nsaying we have here at hg which is don't\nworry alone\nso i don't know that we can take your\nworries away but hopefully what we can\ndo is help you not worry alone so you\ndon't have to be alone in it right we\ncan't fit like i can't wave a magic wand\nand make anyone's family safe in ukraine\ni wish i could\nbut the most we can promise you is to\nlike not worry alone and that's what\ncommunity is about\nso besides avoiding exposure to trauma\nhow can we do primary prophylaxis to\nprevent the development of ptsd these\ncoping strategies sound like\ntreatment in response to after getting\nptsd so not exactly so let's understand\nthis okay\nso\nthere's treatment for ptsd so ptsd is a\nmental disorder it's a diagnosable\nclinical illness post-traumatic stress\ndisorder that has certain evidence-based\ntreatments\nso we need to understand is that\noutside of the clinical diagnosis people\nexperience traumatic events and cope\nwith those traumatic events\nso that doesn't\nthat happens to like everyone right like\nso even minor traumas exist\nso if i go to school for example and\nlike i wet my pants that's a minor\ntraumatic experience\nand depending on how i cope with that i\nmay never develop ptsd or i could\ndevelop ptsd who knows\nright and that's the key thing is\nwhat you do after the trauma how you\ndeal with that\nin it to a certain extent determines\nwhether you develop ptsd or not\nso this is where people are sort of\nsaying like coping strategies sound like\ntreatment in response to ptsd so that\ncan be true so we can teach people so\npart of the treatment of ptsd is like\ndeveloping healthy coping strategies so\nespecially like in terms of addictions\nright so people that wind up with me are\noftentimes using an unhealthy coping\nstrategy like a substance\nbut this is where like i want y'all to\nunderstand that trauma is more than a\nclinical illness like trauma is like a\nbiological experience a psychological\nexperience a human experience\nthat bad things happen to humans\nand the way that we respond to those bad\nthings the way that we deal with those\nbad things\ncan determine how stressed what what the\ndegree of our stress response is to the\ntrauma that's the big takeaway\nso\nsure it could be a part of treatment of\nptsd but the whole point is that like\nwhether you have ptsd whether you get\nptsd or not appears to a certain degree\ndepend on\nhow you cope with what happens to you\nhow you find meaning how you deal with\nyour emotions do you avoid do you\nintegrate are you safe do you engage in\ncommunity do you forgive do you hold on\nto anger do you seek justice do you get\njustice\nall of those factors go into whether\nsomeone has a clinical illness or not\nand this is sort of what was bizarre\nright it's like i have patients in my\npractice who have had traumatic\nexperiences but don't have a diagnosis\nof ptsd\nright that's possible\nand so the cool thing is that the\nresearch seems to be elucidating\nwhat are the things that go into whether\nyou wind up with ptsd or not and that's\nwhere there was one thing that i sort of\ndidn't feel ready to talk about today\nbut like was thinking about talking\nabout it later if you guys are\ninterested in this and that's that's\nwhere so there's a really interesting\narea of research called post-traumatic\ngrowth versus post-traumatic stress\nso this is where depending on a shared\nevent like a common event\nit seems like their human beings will\ndeal with that event differently and one\nwill lead them towards post-traumatic\ngrowth and one will lead them towards\npost-traumatic stress which is the way\nin which you respond to the event\nand that in turn has to do with coping\nmechanisms it also has to do with\npersonality traits and characteristics\nso the the research behind\npost-traumatic growth is very\ninteresting\nso maybe we'll talk about that\nwe all think pull post-traumatic growth\nversus stress\nyay\nso\nthis is another great question what if\nit's really hard for me to manage with\nstress like there is war next to me and\ni have to pass school how am i supposed\nto do both things at once\nfriend i have no idea dude\nhonestly like\ni have no idea\noh no i can't do it now i mean do you\nguys want to do it at all\num because i i need to i need to prepare\nespecially with the personality aspects\nthat's the one area that i don't feel\ni want to do a thorough literature\nsearch so just to give you guys like a\nquick example i read\none two three four five six seven i\nreviewed\n19 papers like 17 or 19 papers in order\nto give this talk so we looked at like\na ton of research so i've only read like\nfive papers on post-traumatic growth so\ni don't feel like i can\naccurately represent it because i don't\nwant to misrepresent things\ngoing back to the question of what if\nit's really hard for me to manage stress\nlike there's war next to me and i have\nto pass a test\ndo the best that you can right so that's\nwhat i'd say like meditate if you can\ntake a walk if you can acknowledge your\nfeelings maybe do some emotional\nexpression and then do the best that you\ncan this is also where i know it sounds\nkind of weird but like sometimes you\nhave to accept that if in a particular\ncircumstance\nyou're not gonna\nyou're not gonna be able to do well\nright so i think this is where oddly\nenough i'd try to forgive yourself for\nnot being able to study\nfor your test\nand this is where i'd also say like\nconcretely like maybe talk to your\nteachers or parents and say\nhey i tried really hard to study for\nthis but i literally like could not\nsleep last night and i'm terrified of\nwhat's happening nearby\nbecause i i can't imagine you're the\nonly one\nright so this is where like it's\nimportant to\nmake allowances for yourself and to ask\nfor allowances from other people\nsomeone's asking what do you do with\nnational guilt i have no idea man that's\nbeyond my expertise\nokay\nall right should we meditate today\nokay so we'll we'll okay so we'll try to\ndo maybe we'll try to do a\npost-traumatic growth\nstream\nokay so we're gonna do like super simple\num\nyeah let's i assume yes i feel like we\nshould\nso we're going to do like super simple\nmeditation today so for anyone who's\njoining us uh who sees this right so i\ni'm maybe we're going to get a different\npopulation i want to teach you all a\nvery very basic meditation technique\ncalled nari shuddhi or nadi shodhana or\nalternate nostril breathing or recently\nin the scientific literature it's been\ncalled cardiac coherence breathing\nso this is a breathing technique that\nhas been shown to balance your\nsympathetic and parasympathetic nervous\nsystems so your sympathetic nervous\nsystem is your stress and survival\nsystem your parasympathetic nervous\nsystem is your rest and digest system so\nif you're amped up\nthis will kind of calm you down and if\nyou're feeling tired or exhausted this\nwill hopefully a few minutes after doing\nit kind of revitalize you\ni really sort of fell in love with this\ntechnique when i was working with people\nuh\nphysicians and and other emergency room\nstaff\nso in the emergency room i would teach\nmeditation not to the patients but to\nthe clinicians and staff\nand what we sort of found when i was\ntalking to them about what would be the\nmost useful and they would sort of say\nthat okay so\nin bay one i have someone who just came\nin after a motor vehicle accident\nadrenaline through the roof\npaddles chest compressions\nblood transfusion kind of stuff\nand then in room number two i have a\nlittle old lady who has\nyou know been nauseous and has a gi bug\nand like i need to like reset from the\nadrenaline to being like compassionate\nso i need some way to like balance like\nmy adrenaline\nso this was the technique that i sort of\nused it worked really really well\ni like this technique because it you\ndon't have to do it for long so you can\ndo it for two or three minutes and it\ntends to have a pretty good effect if\nyou're new to meditation it's very very\neasy to do the one contra indication is\na deviated septum so if you have a\ndeviated septum this this technique can\nbe hard or even impossible to do and i\ndon't recommend doing it\nso the technique is actually quite\nsimple so we're going to sit up straight\nbecause anytime we want to meditate we\nwant our spine and neck to be straight\nso you can even meditate on the ground\nif you want to you can lay down lay flat\nbut we try to sit up straight\nwe're going to take our hand and we're\ngoing to fold these two fingers down if\nthat's hard for you or it ends up like\nthis or something like this that's\ntotally fine\nokay\nand then what we're going to do is block\none nostril and breathe in through the\nother\nand then we're gonna block the other\nnostril and we're gonna breathe out\nthrough the opposite nostril\nand then we're gonna breathe in through\nthis nostril\nswitch and breathe out\nbreathe in\nswitch and breathe out\nbreathe in switch and breathe out\nso after we exhale we're gonna inhale\nthrough the same nostril\nand the nostril that we breathe in from\nis not going to be the same nostril that\nwe breathe out okay so it's in\nout\nin\nout\nin\nout\nokay so i'll\ntoss in the switch so in\nswitch\nout\nin\nswitch\nout\nin\nswitch out\nokay\nso it's also common for one of your\nnostrils to be more clogged than the\nother at any given time that's usually\nit's very normal so\none of your nostrils will be more open\none will be more closed and it'll\nalternate over time so every 90 minutes\n45 to 90 minutes it should switch\nokay so let's go ahead and practice\nso sit up straight\nclose your eyes or you can watch me if\nyou need to\nwe're going to adopt the mudra if this\nis hard for you you can also just use\nyour index finger to switch back and\nforth if that's easier\nso we're going to block our right\nnostril and breathe in through our left\nswitch\nand breathe out through your right\nnostril\nin through the right nostril\nswitch and out through the left\nin through the same nostril\nswitch and out\nin through the same nostril\nswitch\nand out\nin\nswitch out\nin\nswitch\nout\nin\nswitch out\ni'll guide you through one more round\nin\nswitch out\nand now continue at your own pace for a\nperiod of about a minute or two\nwe'll continue for about one more minute\ngo ahead and finish the breath that\nyou're on\nlet your eyes remain closed\nrelax your hands\nmake sure you're sitting up straight\nand just float in this space\nwhen you're ready go ahead and come on\nback slowly\nso i know the world can be a scary place\nbut as best as we can we're going to try\nto stay positive\nit's totally okay to acknowledge the\nfear the hopelessness the terror the\nuncertainty of the future\nand yet the most we can do is live one\nday at a time\nso that's what we're gonna do\nreach out for help or support\nif you can\nand for people in our community be\nprepared to support those and help those\nwho ask for it\nand in terms of practicalities if you're\nlearning this technique for the first\ntime i'd recommend start with five\nminutes of practice\nand you want to eventually work your way\nup to 10 to 20 minutes of practice per\nday\nor three times a week at a minimum\nyou can try other things in addition to\nthis so you don't have to do 20 minutes\nof naughty should be you can do like\nfive to ten minutes of nadi should be\nand then do a different kind of practice\nlike a month or a practice or\nchanting practice or even silent\nmeditation observation of the breath\nthe goal is to really shoot for about 20\nminutes of total practice\nso you can even do yoga for 10 minutes\nand naughty shoot you for 10 minutes if\nyou want to\nand so that's what we sort of recommend\nin terms of time of the day i think dawn\nand dusk are ideal but oftentimes people\nfind that doing it sometime in the\nmorning or sometime before bed can be\nvery helpful\ndepending on what you're shooting for\nso if you're having difficulty sleeping\ndoing meditation maybe about half an\nhour before sleep can be really good\nif you want to start off your day sort\nof in the right mindset meditation first\nthing in the morning can be really good\nbut remember that this technique is\nactually particularly useful because it\ncan be used midday if you want to try to\ncalm yourself down or bring yourself up\nokay\nso i hope you enjoyed the technique i\nhope it's helpful for you and remember\nthat practice makes perfect that\nmeditation just like anything else is a\nskill\nso even if you didn't have a wonderful\nexperience this time the more you\npractice it the better you'll get at it\nand the more mental benefit you'll get\nyou"
