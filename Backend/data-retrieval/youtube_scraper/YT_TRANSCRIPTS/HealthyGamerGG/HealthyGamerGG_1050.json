    "transcript": "okay\nso let's talk a little bit about grief\nwhat does it mean to grieve and how do i\ndo it\nin the past two months i lost my oldest\nbrother and my mom\ntheir deaths were totally unexpected and\nmy family is pretty shaken up\nthis is my first time having to deal\nwith loss within my direct family and i\ngenuinely have no idea how to grieve\nso far i've just been trying to go with\nthe flow of my moods and thoughts\ni.e cry or reminisce when i feel like it\nrequests space from friends or family\nwhen i when i want to be alone indulge\nin distracting enjoyable activities like\nwatching tick tock or reading fan\nfiction\ni also journal\njournal slash record videos and audio\nnotes of my thoughts as a way to process\nbut i don't know if i'm making any real\nprogress on that front\nas i'm just thinking out loud\naside from this kind of passive moment\nby moment approach i don't know what to\ndo to make sense of their deaths or heal\nthe rest of my family seems to be\nunderstanding this through the lens of\nour religion islam by reasoning that it\nwas just their time to go back to allah\nand we'll be reunited with them in the\nnext life\nbecause i'm not super religious myself\nthis kind of framing doesn't really\ncomfort me or help me to process their\nloss in a meaningful way\na large part of me doesn't think that i\nwill ever see them again and i'm having\na hard time coming to terms with such an\nunfathomable idea especially because i\ncan't really voice that thought to my\nfriends as they become distressed and\nuncomfortable anytime i mention doubts\nabout religion or suggest a different\nway of seeing things\ni do have friends that i can talk to\nabout these thoughts but i worry that i\nwill emotionally dump on them or burden\nthem with my fears\nso how do people grieve what does it\nmean to grieve how does one grieve if\nthey don't have a general philosophy\nabout life or a way to understand the\nworld i think the fact that i don't have\na central\nreligious philosophical scientific\nframework for understanding life makes\nit difficult for me to know how to go\nabout this because death just seems\nrandom and unfair to me\nany advice suggestions or personal\nexperiences that you'd want to share are\ngreatly appreciated and i hope you're\nall safe and well thanks for reading\nso this is a fantastic post because it\nasks a really important question\nwhat does it actually mean to grieve\nright how do we do it like how do we\naccept death how do we move on how do we\nlearn to live like what is when people\nlike go through this grieving process\nlike what does that mean like how do you\nknow when you're done how do you know if\nyou're doing it right how do you know if\nyou're doing it wrong\nfurthermore i think as people have\nstarted to become a little bit more\nreligiously flexible let's say\nso as a society you know there's a trend\ntowards agnosticism or atheism which i\nthink is totally fine but i think the\nthe bigger trend is not necessarily\ntowards those things but\ntowards\na general sharing and greater\nunderstanding of different religious\nperspectives which i think is hugely\npositive right so in the past like let's\nsay a thousand years ago\nyour religious exposure was like very\nlimited and nowadays like people can\nlearn about all kinds of stuff right\nlike if i want to go out and buy the\nquran and read it i can i can read\ncommentaries about the quran i can watch\nyoutube videos about the quran i can\nread stuff about the gita i can read\nthings about the gita from this person\nthat person\num i can go to a buddhist meditation\ncenter and like walk in and like learn\nhow to meditate i can walk into a church\nso generally speaking what we're doing\nis we're seeing a ton of exposure to\ndifferent kinds of religious or even\nnon-religious thought right so\neven kind of in the non-religious realm\nlike there there's stoic philosophy\nthere are people who are atheists who\nwill sort of talk about morality and\nlike you know how to make sense of death\nand like all this good stuff\nso we have a lot of these different\nperspectives so how do you know like\nhow to grieve right you know what what\ndo you mean how do you make sense of it\nbecause in the past what used to happen\nwith grief is that like we would have a\nlarge you know religious perspective\nwhich would make sense of the world for\nus and much like this person's family\nyou know people would just use religion\nis kind of like the playbook for how to\nmanage death but as we get exposed to\nall these different fla like concepts\nlike we don't really know okay which one\nis like the most correct we don't know\nso as we become sort of religiously more\nflexible\npeople oftentimes people like this\nperson right who sort of grew up in a\nreligious tradition but doesn't\nnecessarily believe it\nthey're left kind of like spinning in\nthe wind because everyone else has this\nplaybook but like i don't have a\nplaybook so how do i do this thing right\nand so we're left asking these questions\nlike how do people grieve what does it\nmean to grieve how do i know if i'm\ngrieving\nso i'd like to talk to you all today\nabout grief\nokay oh\nthere we go\nso\nlet's talk about a couple of things\nso the first thing that we're going to\ndo is talk about\noh\nit's green\noh my goodness\nokay let's\ngo back to white\nso we're gonna talk about grief today\nso the first thing that we're going to\ndo is we're going to you know talk a\nlittle bit about you know what is grief\nwe're going to talk a little bit about\nwhy is grief hard\nand this is going to get kind of\ninteresting but when we ask the question\nhow do i grieve\nwhat we're going to do\nis actually\ntalk a little bit about how death\naffects people\nright so if we want to get\nif we want to get past something\nwhat we need to understand like if we\nwant to fix something then what we need\nto understand is what the damage in the\nfirst place is right so like if i have a\nflat tire then i know how to fix my car\nbecause i understand what damage has\nbeen done to my car so what we're going\nto start with is actually like how does\ndebt death affect people and once we\nunderstand how it affects people\nthen we can sort of move on to you know\nhow do i set things right\nand then once we understand how to set\nthings right then we'll sort of\nunderstand what the grieving process is\nokay\nand\num\nand this is\nthis also we're going to talk a little\nbit about you know science and medicine\nand epidemiology\nwe're going to talk just a little bit\nabout death today\num\nand then you know if you guys want to we\ncan touch on\ncertain like eastern perspectives that\nare a little bit more spiritual or uh\nreligious in nature that's kind of\noptional i'm not sure that i want to do\nthis along with the rest of the grief\nstuff because i think it's important\nthat\ni feel pretty confident that this part\nis going to apply to everyone\nwhereas depending on your perspective or\nyour belief system like this part may\nnot apply to you and i just haven't\ndecided like internally whether i want\nthese things to be together right\nbecause then i i don't want to come\nacross as\nbeing quite objective here and feeling\nvery confident in what i say like\nscientifically and then sort of adding\nsome eastern stuff at the end and i just\nwant to make sure that we separate those\ntwo things out because i don't want\nanyone to think that this is just the\nscientific is like the stuff okay\nbecause it really isn't\nso the first thing\nis so we're gonna define a couple of\nthings okay so number one so what is\ngrief\nso the term bereavement and we're gonna\nstart with some vocabulary\nmeans losing a loved one\nokay\nso this is kind of interesting statistic\nso on average when one person dies there\nare nine people\nwho are bereaved on average\nso what this means\nis that if you look at the average human\npopulation\nif one person dies there are going to be\nnine people who are going to be severely\naffected by that person's loss so this\nincludes like close family members\nfriends like best friends you know so on\naverage every person that passes away\nleaves like nine people kind of messed\nup\nnext thing to note about bereavement is\nthat it's not always dealt with um kind\nof in the same way so there seem to be\ncultural dependencies\nwith how we deal with bereavement\nso i'll give you guys just an example so\nthere was one study that has a super low\nsample size\num about like less than 30 individuals\nthat looked at\nparents in the united states and china\nand these are parents who had lost\nchildren\nand so what they sort of they tracked\nthese people over time and what they\nfound is that at four months\num both parents were about the same in\nterms of like their impairment and like\nhow sad they were and things like that\nhow much the loss of their child was\naffecting them but the interesting thing\nis that at 18 months\num on average the chinese parents were\nactually like more adjusted or had\nlearned how to cope or were kind of back\nto normal in a way in in a greater way\nthan the parents from the united states\nso like i said this is a relatively\nsmall study you know just looking at how\ndifferent people process grief it\ndoesn't we don't want to infer too much\nabout cultural\nthe purpose of citing this study is not\nto assume that\nchinese people are better at dealing\nwith grief than american people are it's\nreally to just point out that there is\nevidence that there are cultural\ndependencies and so if you're watching\nthis\nunderstand that what i'm going to be\nsharing with you may be like adjustable\nby your culture okay that's really the\nmain point of citing that study and if\nwe kind of look at like what you know\nwhat happens when people pass away\nwhat's the\nyou know what is the experience of\nbelief bereavement so people get all\nkinds of different symptoms so for\nexample they'll get they'll have\ndifficulty concentrating\nright you it's like hard to focus on\nyour schoolwork and stuff like that you\ntend to be preoccupied with the person\nwho's passed away\nso you're thinking about them all the\ntime you're like having difficulty\nsleeping and stuff like that that's\nanother one by the way sleep disturbance\nokay\nso you're thinking about them it's a\ndifficulty sleeping is this person kind\nof said you know we'll cry and things\nlike that you'll get more emotional so\nthere's tends to be a little bit more\nemotional\ndisturbance or\ndysregulation\nso people feel sad more right\nwe oftentimes feel lonely\nafter we lose a loved one and this is it\nkind of important\nsometimes we experience mild\nhallucinations which are completely\nnormal\nokay so it is not unusual to sometimes\neven see your loved one or hear them\ncalling your name so remember so a lot\nof people assume that hallucinations\nequals\nmental illness\nor equals psychosis\nor schizophrenia\nright people just assume that if you're\nhallucinating you're mentally ill but it\nturns out that none of these are\nactually true\nso a hallucination is a symptom\nright it's like fever there are all\nkinds of causes for fever\nit's like chest pain there are all kinds\nof\ncauses for chest pain or even pressure\nin your chest\nso chest pressure what's the\ndifferential diagnosis of chest pressure\ncould be myocardial infarction which is\na heart attack\nor could be falling in love\nright\nso remember that we as human beings we\nexperience all kinds of things and\ngenerally speaking one of the things\nthat a lot of people tend to do is\nthey'll assume\nthat a symptom equals a diagnosis right\ni feel pressure in my chest well like\nwhat is that\nis are you bereaved are you having a\nheart attack are you falling in love\nlike what does that mean similarly\nhallucinations there are a couple of\ncases of you know hallucinations being a\nnormal human process and bereavement is\nactually like one of them\nso bereavement sort of is losing a loved\none and these are some of the symptoms\nthat we experience it's culturally\ndependent right so these these may\nchange depending on what part of the\nworld you live in or what your religious\ntradition is\nand then we get to grief\nso grief is the natural response\nto bereavement\nright so grief is like the way that\nhuman beings adapt to\nand respond to losing a loved one\nso it also it's also important to note\nthat you know grief is not necessarily\nor definitely a response to bereavement\nbut it can also be like a response to\na breakup\neven losing a job\nright we can be grieved about all kinds\nof things\nyou know getting expelled from school\nlike it's not necessarily the death of a\nof a loved one\nand so\ngrief actually has\num a number of different kind of\nmanifestations so this is like this is\nbereavement right and then as people\nstart to grieve as they start to respond\nto the loss of the person you know\nit's characterized by similar things to\nbereavement look like there are a couple\nof things that are a little bit\ndifferent\nso one is that exploration is inhibited\nand we'll get to that in a second\nright so there's like a reduced interest\nin life\num\nthere's this is a really actually common\none that people are surprised by there's\nan unfamiliar\nincompetence\nin daily life\nso this is a key one to zero in on\nwhen someone you love passes away it's\nit's kind of funny because it's like\nbizarre but\nyou just start to feel like you're bad\nat stuff that you're normally not bad at\nso and this is the thing is that people\nwill oftentimes beat themselves up right\nbecause like they lost a loved one sure\nlike maybe your best friend passed away\nbut your best friend passing away\ndoesn't mean that like\nyou're incompetent at microwaving food\nor like reviewing resumes\nso oftentimes as a result of some of\nthese things like difficulty\nconcentration preoccupation with loss\nright what that'll end up doing is like\nmake you not as competent as you used to\nbe\nand so this is a really common one that\ni oftentimes see a lot of like shame and\nlike guilt and confusion\nfor this one\nbut the truth is it's kind of a normal\npart of the process right so like you\njust kind of feel like incompetent we'll\nget to a little bit about why that is as\nwell\nso and then the last thing is that often\ntimes when someone passes away there's\nconfusion about long-term goals\num if you all are very interested in\nlike learning more about this stuff i\nthink there's a lot of stuff with\nattachment theory that we'll touch on\ntoday i'm not an expert in attachment\ntheory but i think that there's a lot of\ngood stuff from the realm of attachment\ntheory about grief\nbut this is essentially what we can\nexpect from you know the grief response\nand over time\nwhat we're going to try to do is like\nsince these are the ways that we get\naffected we're going to try to like fix\neach of these things okay so these will\nend up with sort of like\num\nlet me just think a little bit about\nyou know what are the different things\nwe'll talk a little bit about how as we\nresolve these things we'll sort of go\nthrough what healthy grieving looks like\nbut before we get to healthy grieving\nlet's talk a little bit about\nunhealthy grieving\nso this is really key\nokay\nso the grief process the normal grief\nprocess\ni'd give people four to six months\nso a lot of people like i guess we don't\nget taught this stuff right but like how\nwhat's a normal amount of time to grieve\nso like how long should you have this\ngrieving debuff and i'd say that on\naverage it should be like four to six\nmonths with some stuff lasting up to a\nyear\nbut generally speaking if if you're\nstill having some kind of struggle like\nreally a struggle\nuh you know after one year of a\nparticular loss chances are you've moved\ninto the psychiatric diagnosis\nof prolonged grief\nand prolonged grief is characterized by\nyou know\nsustained grief longer than normal\nand also impairment to function\nso if your grief\nis really like i mean it's okay for it\nto be like making things a little bit\ntrickier but you should still be able to\nat the four-month mark be able to you\nknow participate in school maybe it's\nnot quite as easy to concentrate but you\nshould be able to do your assignments\nyou should be able to take tests you\nshould be able to go you know\ncontinue to work at your job if you want\nto you should be able to exercise\ncook for yourself clean for yourself\nwhatever your\nstandard is you know maybe you should\nstill be dating or you know be able to\nenjoy going to the movies or things like\nthat you may miss that person when\nyou're at the movie because you have\nmemories of you know how you all used to\nwatch movies together but generally\nspeaking we're talking about you know\nthe normal grief process like these\nkinds of symptoms should last about four\nto six months\nand then you know some of this stuff\nshould start to get better over the\ncourse of like one year\nand if if it's taking you longer than\nthat then you should seriously consider\nseeing a mental health specialist and\nsort of think a little bit about\nprolonged grief for kind of what's\nholding you back\nso the other thing is that it's not just\nprolonged grief so there's evidence that\nshows that grieving\ncan be a risk factor for precipitating\nother diagnoses so for example\n20 to 30 percent\nof people who have who grieve and have\nlost a loved one will end up with mdd or\na depressive episode\nnow\nwhat this sort of means so it doesn't\nmean that 20 of people\ni have to clarify that number it doesn't\nmean that everyone who passes everyone\nwho loses a loved one has a 20 chance of\ngetting depression that's not what that\nmeans what this means is that for people\nwho have major depressive disorder\nabout one out of five of them if they\nlose a loved one that can be a risk\nfactor that will trigger\ntheir existing illness right so remember\nthat major depressive disorder or\nclinical depression is a case where\nsomeone has some kind of like genetic or\nlike\num you know\nupbringing related predisposition for\ndepression there may be like some kind\nof vulnerability to ano to a\nneurochemical imbalance\nso what we tend to see in people who\nhave a depression is that grief\ncan trigger that imbalance and then they\nget into the depressive episode they get\ntreatment they get better and everything\ncan still work out it's not that big of\na deal but you know it can absolutely\ntrigger an actual depressive episode\nthe other thing that sometimes happens\nis that remember that major depressive\ndisorder is a vulnerability right so\nthere's some amount of like genetic\nstuff\ngoing on and then in the right\ncircumstances that predisposition for\ndepression will actually manifest as\ndepression so in some cases what we'll\nsee is that major depressive disorder\ntheir first episode is triggered by\ngrieving right so that's like a major\nstress on the mind a major stress on the\nbody\nas a result like it can trigger your\ndepression\nso we also see that about 22 to 27\npercent\nwill get some kind of anxiety\nright so once again about a fifth\num\nso\ngenerally speaking\nloss of a loved one does not cause ptsd\nunless it's like particularly violent or\nsomething like that or like\nparticularly traumatic loss\nbut it does appear that losing a loved\none\nincreases the risk of ptsd if\nsomething else happens down the road and\nit about doubles the risk\nso there's something about you know the\nstate of grief that forms some kind of\nstressor on the mind\nthat allows you to be more vulnerable to\nother things so if you have ptsd and you\nlose a loved one sometimes your ptsd can\nget worse if you lost your loved one in\na particularly traumatic or profound way\nit can cause ptsd but we do tend to see\nthings like depression and anxiety kind\nof get worse or sort of get triggered\nsomewhat by the grieving\nokay and so these two weren't mental\nhealth evaluation and treatment so like\nthis is where you know if you guys have\nif you've lost a loved one and you're\nkind of like difficulty concentrating\nfor a few months you know you're feeling\nkind of lonely like you're having\ntrouble making sense of the world and\nyour life and stuff like that that's all\ncompletely normal but if it's getting to\nthe point where you know six months have\ngone by eight months have gone by you're\nhaving trouble getting out of bed you\ncan't go to work anymore you're having\nlike nightmares or flashbacks or things\nlike that\nor\nyour grief lasts longer than a year then\nyou should seriously consider getting\nmental health treatment\nokay\nnow\ntalked a little bit about unhealthy\ngrief\nso now we're going to do is talk about\nthe process of morning\nso morning is like going through grief\nokay so it's kind of like the process of\nadapting\nto and\nintegrating grief\nright so once we have a loss like we as\nhuman beings need to like adapt to it\nadjust to it integrate it into our lives\nand generally speaking there are a\ncouple of important like components of\nmourning so one is accepting the loss\nright which like you may know they're\ndead but like on some level\nyour mind may not have fully integrated\nand we'll get to this in a second may\nnot have fully integrated like what\ntheir loss means for you\nright so as you go through your first\nbirthday without them as you go through\nyour first holiday without them as their\nbirthday comes up as your graduation\ncomes up like as is milestone events\nstart to come up without this person\nlike their loss becomes like more and\nmore\nknown to you right you sort of like it\nsinks in and then over time you'll\ngradually accept it\na second thing is accepting the\nconsequences\nof loss\nso this may sound like a little bit\nredundant but as i was kind of saying\nlike you know as you go through\nbirthdays and stuff like that there may\nbe like consequences of like losing your\nparent right so one is that your parent\nmay never be around anymore but then\nlike let's say i'm a young woman and i\nwant my dad to walk me down the aisle\nlike accepting the consequences of dad\nno longer being around can\nbe a little bit different from\nhim not being around right so one is\nthat your dad is never going to be\naround again which can absolutely be\npainful but then there's like all of the\nstuff that comes with that absence in\nyour life\nokay\nand this is\nkind of a little bit tricky because if\nwe look at people right what do people\ndo for us\nso this is where we're going to touch on\nattachment theory for a second\nso what do people provide\nso what do we get from people right\nwhat we get is they provide a safe haven\nlike important people in our lives right\nsome somewhat of a home base\nthey allow us to like learn new things\num they allow us to take chances\nand then they offer some degree of\nconstancy in our life\nright so like when i say they allow us\nto learn new things i mean obviously we\ncan learn new things without other\npeople but let's say i'm picking up\nsomething as simple as a video game\nright so like if you think about when\nyou start playing a new video game\nwho else starts playing a new video game\nand so your friends you and your friends\ndecide to all get a game together right\nand we're like oh we're going to play\napex legends or whatever we're going to\ntry dota we're going to try law whatever\nand so if you really think about it like\nhaving close friends allows you to learn\nnew things in sort of like a safe\nenvironment where all you all are going\nto\nexperiment together\nlet's say you and your friends are going\nto go you know y'all are going to go to\nthe beach and you're going to learn how\nto surf together\nthe other thing that people allow you to\ndo is to take chances close people right\nbecause they're going to be there for\nyou they're going to be some degree of\nlike support so\nlet's say i want to ask someone out that\ni'm attracted to and i go to my you know\nmy friends and i say hey i'm going to\nask this girl out like and they're like\nokay bro like you got this like good\nluck like you know we you know we're\nwe're here when she rejects you lol\nright so like they like people provide\nus some degree of security they allow us\nto take chances very true for parents\nright so like your parents are\noftentimes your safety net your parents\nare the ones that encourage you to try\nnew things\nand then people also in like give us\nsome degree of constancy\nso this too is\nwe'll talk about parents and people on\ndiscord right so your parents will\noftentimes you'll go home for christmas\nor you'll go home for thanksgiving or\nyou're go you'll go home for a\nparticular holiday and so if you\npractice a particular religion and you\ngo home during the time of your religion\nlike you're celebrating hanukkah or\ndiwali or whatever there's a certain\namount of constancy and tradition and\nlike your life sort of like has this\nstability which they provide so even if\nyou know things are uncertain in other\nparts of your life you have this one\nsource of constancy that people provide\nthe other thing that's really really\nimportant\nabout what people provide is our sense\nof identity\nthis may sound kind of confusing because\nyou know are wouldn't you assume that\nidentity comes from within well no\nactually like your identity a big part\nof your identity\nactually does not come from within the\nlion's share of your identity actually\ndepending on how much into yoga are you\ncan even say\nall of your identity comes from\neverywhere except for within\nand that may be kind of confusing for a\nlittle bit but if you think about who\nyou are and how you identify yourself\nthose ten like all of those attributes\ndon't actually come from you they come\nfrom the external world so if i identify\nas like a gifted kid\nfor example\nright\nwhere did i get that identity i got it\nbecause my parents were like oh you're\nso precocious you're so smart right like\nour neuropsychologist tests you and says\nyou have an iq of 185\nright so that identity that sense of\nidentity actually comes from another\nperson\nso we get described as funny we get\ndescribed as you know grumpy we get\ndescribed as awesome at dota we get\ndescri described as you know a one-trick\npony in apex legends or overwatch like\nwe get described as all of these things\nthat we sort of internalize our ide as\nour identity i'm a smart person i'm an\nugly person i'm a good person i'm a bad\nperson\nif you think about a child who grows up\nin an abusive\nhousehold right how do what do they\nthink about themselves they think they\nhave very low self-esteem they value\nthemselves lowly right so all of these\nissues of identity\nright when when you're kind of viewed as\na good person and everything is going to\nbe okay and you'll bounce back your\nresilient kid i have faith in you all of\nthat all of those aspects of identity\ncome from another person\nactually don't come from us\nand so\nwhen we lose someone who provides this\nsense of identity our identity becomes\nuncertain\nright so if you just think a little bit\nlike i you know i'm going to mention a\ncouple things that are kind of sad but\nlike well let's just take the kid the\ncase of a kid right so a kid let's say a\nseven-year-old kid who loses a parent\nthe parent is going to be a major source\nof you know like comfort and reassurance\nand telling the kid like you're a good\nkid\nright you're loved\nand so if you think a little bit about\nthat if you remove that parent from the\nequation\nwhat is that how is that identity gonna\nchange for the kid over time like there\nisn't that person telling them\nconstantly that you're okay and i accept\nyou unconditionally right so that's\ngonna be like a very very big shock to\ntheir sense of identity\nso when we lose someone who\nis close to us our sense of who we are\nchanges\nso the next thing that happens is that\nwe have to change our relationship\nto the lost object\nso like i have a particular relationship\nwith my dad let's say but if my dad is\nno longer around like i still have some\nkind of relationship with him i know it\nsounds kind of weird but like i relate\nto him right so like i will something\nabout my life will continue to be\naffected by him the things that he\ntaught the memories we have the pictures\nwe have like all those kinds of things\nare still going to be like part of my\nlife right he's not like truly gone\nbecause he continues to exist in my mind\ni i listen to his favorite music i hear\nhis you know i see people wearing his\nfavorite brand of clothing i go eat food\nthat reminds me of our dad so then we\nhave to change our kind of relationship\nto that person even though they're gone\nbecause they're gone now right so we\ncan't have the same relationship we used\nto have\nand over time as we mourn we restore\nthe capacity\nto\nthrive\nright\nso like generally speaking and we'll get\nto this in a little bit as well maybe we\nshould have started here but\nyou know as we start to become uncertain\nabout our future and things like that\nlike we start to worry a little bit\nabout like\nwhat's gonna happen what am i gonna do\nbecause we start to uh you know become\nhave difficulty\nconcentrating as we start to have\nreduced interest in life as our\nexploration starts to be inhibited you\nknow like these are the consequences of\ngrief so part of mourning and the\nhealthy process of grieving is to start\nto like restore the capacity to thrive\nin life right where life becomes like\nhopeful\nand\nthis is kind of the last thing which is\nthat you know looking to the future\nwith happiness and optimism\nand this kind of presumes that you know\nyou were looking to the future with\nhappiness and optimism before the person\npassed away but basically kind of like\nbeing back to square one with this like\nintegrated sense of loss and this is the\nthe process of mourning so when we talk\nabout successful grieving and how do i\ngrieve\nit's basically to like go through these\nstages right so the first is you get\naffected by the grief in this way\nuh the bereavement causes these basic\nthings right so like hallucinations and\nthen if we think about the bereavement\nis over here and you are over here\nthere are going to be changes to your\nperson right so you will start to change\nand that process is grief as you\nintegrate those changes and adapt\nthere's a smiley face it's a bad smiley\nface but\nthen you as you go through the process\nof mourning what we want you to do is\nkind of like adapt to those changes\nstart to reconceptualize life still a\nbad smile face\num\nand then sort of like learn to accept\nthe loss learn to accept the\nconsequences of the loss\nyou know change your sense of identity\nlike reintegrate yourself\num change your relationship with the\nperson who's lost and then hopefully\nstart to be like optimistic about the\nfuture and like\nyou know be able to enjoy yourself\nso let's talk a little bit about in\ngeneral like what happens and and so\nthis is kind of like a you know stepwise\nfashion but now i'm going to try to\nsummarize everything okay\nso here's you\nand generally speaking when we try to\nmake sense of the world our sense of the\nworld is about constancy\nokay\nand so if we like if there's a kid who's\nlike learning about gravity for example\nlike gravity is actually really\nreassuring because it always works the\nsame way so you can count on it right as\nhuman beings like we operate most of our\nlife like counting on things to happen\nso i know that there's a lot of\nuncertainty in the world in covid but we\nstill like wake up every day and like i\ncount on my toilet working i count on\nthe sun rising i count on my car\nstarting i count on you know my family\nmembers being at home but like my life\nis organized and makes sense because of\nthe constancy of it\nand a huge part of that constancy is\nother people\nright so if i think about like my life\nlike my life is what it is because\nmy wife does particular things my kids\ndo particular things y'all do particular\nthings so i rely even on you know the\ninternet to show up when i'm doing these\nkinds of things to watch these kinds of\nvideos\nand so everything in the world makes\nsense and if there is constancy and if\nthere are rules to the game\nthen i can plan a strategy\nright if i know like how to play the\ngame of life like or if i can if i know\nthe rules of the game of life then i can\nplan an appropriate strategy for example\nlike there's we have phrases like\nbusiness casual right what does business\ncasual mean it's like a rule it's like a\nway to sort of describe what i'm\nsupposed to wear so like people tell me\noh it's business casual so then i know\nhow to like plan a strategy for this\nkind of event like what kind of people\ncan i expect or is it like you know do i\nneed to wear a tuxedo like you know\nwhat's the what's the attitude what's\nthe atmosphere what's the tone so we use\nall of these terms like business casual\nor like you know other kinds of man-made\nconstructs to plan a strategy for life\nnow the tricky thing is that\nwhen we lose someone right so when\nsomeone passes away this constancy gets\nshaken up\nso if we think about like you know i'm\nplanning my future\nand i'm thinking about all the different\nthings that could happen but they all\ninvolve this person's influence in some\nway so let's say like a parent right\nso for example like\nif i have trouble at work\ni can go to my parent and ask for advice\nif i have trouble in a relationship\ni can go to my parent and ask for advice\nif i run into financial hardship\ni can move back in with my parents and\nthey can like provide me with a place to\nstay\nso a lot of the rules of the game that\ni'm playing\nare going to be dependent on particular\npeople like existing\nand so what starts to happen and what\nmakes grief so difficult is as like this\nperson leaves then this becomes a\nquestion mark this becomes a question\nmark and this becomes a question mark so\nthen from constancy we're actually\nmoving to uncertainty\nbecause this is what happens in our\nbrain is like we wake up every day and\nyour loved ones are there right like\nit's such a given\nbut once you take one of your loved ones\nout of the picture\nsuddenly your brain is like i don't know\nwhat else i can count on\nwhat can i trust in this world\nright like and so this leads to anxiety\nand this uncertainty and anxiety about\nthe future then makes it difficult\nto do things like\nexplore new things\nand like have an interest in life and\nplan for the future because your part\nthis part of your brain is like i've\ncounted on this person being there all\nthe time\nright like i've relied on them i've\nassumed that they were going to be there\nand now i have to redo all of my\ncalculations what kind of job do i want\nif my parents aren't around\nwhat kind of relationship do i want if\nmy parents aren't around what am i what\nam i going to do about money if i don't\nhave the safety net of my parents\nso there's so many things about our life\nthat we sort of assume\nare going to proceed a particular way\nbecause our brain just calculates just\nlike gravity like mom is around dad is\naround right\nor even your pet is around\nand so you just like count on those\nkinds of things but if your pet is no\nlonger there then suddenly like all of\nyour vacation options change\nright what time you need to wake up in\nthe morning changes what you need to buy\nat the grocery store changes so there's\nso many things about your life that\nsuddenly become uncertain\nand as we become uncertain this leads to\nkind of anxiety and then like this\nanxiety then leads to\na lack of exploration\nlack of optimism\nright because what if someone else\npasses away\nand so that that's going to be kind of\nterrifying for the mind to deal with who\nare you now without this person\nand so as all of these things start to\nchange\nit can become very very difficult and\nthis is kind of the process of grieving\nthat we talked about\nand then we also have to start to like\nreintegrate ourselves after we lose\nsomeone so we have to start to think a\nlittle bit okay like now that my parents\nare gone like who am i right you have to\nat you have to reintegrate your identity\nyou have to figure out who you are\nyou know how often are you gonna visit\ntheir graves like what are you gonna you\nknow are you gonna still talk to them\nlike are you gonna pray to them like do\nyou believe they're in heaven like\nwhat's going on\nso there's just a lot of uncertainty\nthat that kind of gets thrown up in the\nair\nand so this person for example is\ntalking a little bit about you know not\nbeing as religious as many other people\nand so the cool thing about religion is\nthat religion basically like takes this\nand turns it back into constancy\nright so this is the effect of religion\nbecause your religion will say they're\nwaiting for you in heaven okay so the\nrules of the game actually haven't\nchanged\nright because the religion provides you\nwith rules of the game so if you're an\nagnostic or an atheist or even if you're\nof a religious background and haven't\nreally gone through this stuff then\nyou're going to be left with uncertainty\nand anxiety and then you may turn to a\nparticular religion and you'll find\nanswers\nand so like what do those answers mean\nthose answers are gonna be like people\nwho find answers in religion or religion\nis gonna help them do these things\nright so they'll help you like recognize\nwho you are okay they're gonna be in\nheaven i'll see them one day so now\nyou've changed your relationship to the\nobject of your loss\nright they're praying for me like my dad\nis looking out for me from heaven\nokay so now that my dad is looking out\nfor me i can start to look to the future\nagain and i know that he would be happy\nand i can like have positive emotions\nand stuff like that\nright\nand so sometimes religious organizations\nwill also provide like a safe haven\nright so you go to the church you go to\nthe temple whatever and there's like\npeople there that will comfort you and\nthings like that\nand so this is basically the process\nof how to grieve right and people will\nsay oh well i guess i mean we haven't\ntalked too much about the how these are\nsort of the goals and so like how does\nthis manifest so i'd say that sometimes\num\nyou know there are there are going to be\nthings like what this person said so\nthere's going to be like moment to\nmoment emotional experiences\nthere's also going to be milestones\nwhich need to be kind of like just\nrethought or re-experienced\nso what do i mean by that this is things\nlike birthdays holidays\nreligious ceremonies marriages\ngraduations all of these things have\nchanged\nright so the process of grieving\ninvolves like experiencing those things\nfeeling that moment to moment emotional\nexperience thinking about what does this\nmean for my future and hopefully over\ntime like finding like other things to\nfill in the vacuum of the lost person\nright learning to love again\num and then so there's gonna be like\nsome amount of identity formation\nso who you are may change in your mind\nand so you're going to be kind of\nconfused about who you are because this\nconstant source of kind of identity\ndeterminism from the loved one is now\ngone so your your identities would be\ngonna be kind of like confused and and\nnot certain what it is and so you're\ngonna like go through some amount of\nintrospection and going for long walks\nand listening to sad music and watching\nmovies and maybe going to church and\nhaving funeral ceremonies and all these\nkinds of things which will like sort of\nhelp you form your identity\nand then over time you'll have to learn\nhow to be optimistic\nand what does this look like so you're\ngoing to have a tendency to not want to\ndo things right you have a reduced\ninterest in life and gradually over time\nthere's going to be some weird\nneurochemical physiologic stuff going on\nso for example there are studies that\nshow that the immunity that you gain\nfrom a vaccine\nvaries depending on whether you're\ngrieving or not so there are even\npsychoneuroimmunologic changes\nthat will affect like the robustness of\nyour immune system and make you more\nvulnerable to like illness so it's not\njust psychological that's absolutely\nneuroscientific you know physiologic\nhormonal there are all kinds of\ndifferent changes going on\nas those changes start to balance and as\nyou start to like engage in new\nexperiences right you try something and\nyou're like oh this actually is fun\nso a good example of this is if you've\nlost uh you know a partner or spouse\nright and then like\nyou're like okay i'm gonna be alone\nforever which sort of makes sense and\nthen you meet someone and you get a\nlittle bit attracted to them and then\nlike you go on a date and you enjoy\nyourself and then you feel guilty for\nyour enjoying yourself and then you're\nlike dealing with all these things then\nyou have an identity impact right\nbecause you're like oh my god i'm\nbetraying my wife now i feel like i'm uh\ni'm uh you know i'm being unfaithful to\nher\nso i don't want to be an unfaithful\nperson so there are all these assaults\non your identity you feel pessimistic\nthere's a moment to moment you know\nemotional experience the milestone as\nyou went on a\na date and there's another milestone\nwhich is like maybe you\nbecome sexually active with a new person\nand then you feel even worse about\nyourself and then you have to like work\nthrough that stuff right like you\nexperience these things you reintegrate\nand then you sort of realize okay like\nactually you know they would want\nnothing but for me to be happy and\nthey're probably okay with this and i\nhope they're okay with this whatever\ni'll talk to them when i get to heaven\nmaybe they'll be pissed we'll find out\nand then you start to engage in new\nexperiences and as you start to engage\nin new experiences and you go on on\ndates and you start to like you're like\noh actually this is actually a lot of\nfun maybe and then you start to think\nabout the future with the second person\nbecause then you learn how to be\noptimistic and you're looking forward to\nholidays and then you're kind of like\nback to normal right and then you've\ngone through the process of grieving\nquestions\nyeah so\nmaybe some of my random\nexamples which are used to support the\npoint may be hitting a bit close to home\nso i think this is absolutely the kind\nof thing that you know for example like\nan interview would do really good at\nlike illustrating this stuff right it'd\nbe nice if we could like pair like a\nsolid interview with this of someone's\nexperience of okay i've lost a partner\nand now i feel like really bad about\nmyself so then like you we would see\nall of these features at play\nas we go through the interview\nright\nyeah so identity is always changing\nabsolutely\nuh so the kubler loss raw stages of\ngrief i think are pretty accurate like\nthey're pretty good\num\ni how can i say this\njust as a psychiatrist like clinically i\nfind this\nto be like more useful than the kubler\nraw stages of grief just because like it\nit it helps or it is\ni mean i\ni assume it's helped my patients but\nwhen i sort of help them understand that\nlike\nokay so your mind so here's like a\nsummary okay so your mind like as you\noperate through the world like as you\nnavigate the world and you go to work\nand you go grocery shopping and stuff\nlike that it has these core assumptions\nlike gravity\nthe sun rises in the morning and sets in\nthe evening this person exists in my\nlife\nand so what makes grief really hard is\nthat like a fundamental about your\nuniverse has been changed\nit's suddenly like gravity has stopped\nworking the sun is no longer going to\nrise this person is gone\nand it takes time for your mind or your\nbeing to adjust to that loss because\nsuddenly like now everything has changed\nthe groceries that i buy have changed\nbecause there's one less person living\nat home\ni used to hate these cookies but they\nused to love those cookies and i'm not\nbuying those cookies anymore\nmy future starts to change because this\nperson was a huge part of my future we\nwere going to get married we're going to\ndo this we're going to do that so now\nlike all these plans that i had like\nwill disappear\neven my identity changes because so much\nof who i felt like i was on a day-to-day\nbasis\nis based on how this person treated me\nright how they responded to me\nlike the fact that i feel like a good\nperson because my partner is ill and i\ntake care of them and like now they're\ngone and then like i don't know who i am\nanymore\nso so many fundamentals about who we are\nhow we live our life how we plan how we\nlook towards the future suddenly become\nhuge question marks everything from\nidentity to like\nplanning for the future\nand so grieving and mourning is the\nprocess of adapting to those changes and\nintegrating those changes into ourselves\nso that we can start to be optimistic\nstart to look forward to the future and\nat the same time still maintain some\nkind of relationship with that person\nright because that person is going to\nlike live within me forever\nso like their impact on me is going to\nlike be there no matter what\nand so just learning to accept that that\nthat you know this person even though\nthey're gone like they're still gonna\nexist in the universe in some way shape\nor form\nis like the process of mourning and so\nsuccessful grief you know\ngive it like four months to a year\ngenerally speaking\nand and then that's really what we're\nshooting for\nokay\nyeah so how do you so there's a good\nquestion how do you mourn a loved one\nthat you don't really like and i think\nthat that process is still the same\nright so i know it's kind of interesting\nbut we're making a lot of assumptions so\nlet's say like there's a loved one that\nyou don't like you still have to change\nyour relationship to them\nso for example like if let's say you had\nan abusive parent\nso you may not like them\nand so you're angry with them and you\nhad it on your mind to one day tell them\nexactly how you felt right you wanted\nyou wanted to one day like tell them hey\nyou've been really mean to me and i\nreally dislike you i'm very angry at you\nand i have not forgiven you for\neverything that you've done to me screw\nyou and you want to say that to them but\nyou never had the balls to do it or call\nit whatever you want right\novaries\nso you never said those things to them\nand so there's some amount of resentment\nand like now they're gone so like\nthere's never gonna be justice you're\nnever gonna get to tell them so you\nstill have to change your relationship\nto that person\nright like you you're never going to be\nable to tell them and so like you may\ntell them at their grave you may tell\nthem at the funeral you may like write a\nletter and burn it you may you know\nwrite you may go\npiss on their grave like whatever you\nwant to do like you can do some kind of\nmorning attribute which still involves\nthis sort of scientific attachment\ntheory kind of idea of like changing\nyour relationship to the person\nso mourning is like absolutely whether\nyou like the person or dislike the\nperson the main thing is that\nyou\nadapt to their absence right that's what\nhealthy\nlike grief looks like it's like adapting\nto their absence\nand that can be letting go of your\nresentment\nor it can be doing you know something\ndisrespectful to them like it can be\nwhatever\nand at the same time it's also like in\nterms of identity formation if you had\nan abusive parent like a big part of\nthat identity formation has to happen\nanyway for you to be healthy which is\nrecognizing that the way that this\nperson treated you is not actually\naccurate that's not who you are the way\nthey treated you is actually\ninappropriate\nso it's absolutely relevant for people\nwho you didn't like either right it's\njust major figures in your life that can\nbe negative and then you still have to\nreintegrate without them\nso other good examples of things you\nknow so when i've had patients who have\nhad\nparents who are\nnot the nicest\na big part of that morning involves\ncoming to terms with the fact that they\nwill never patch up that relationship\nso for most kids who have parents that\nthey don't get along with\ndeep within them there's like a small\nvery very like\nresilient desire to like patch things up\nright\nyou want one day like you hope it's like\nthis this wish that you have that one\nday you guys can patch things up\nbut when someone dies like that can\nnever happen\nand so it's even mourning that\npossibility like that hope that you have\nthat one day i hope my parents\nunderstand one day i hope they\nunderstand one day i hope that they\nunderstand i had a patient who came out\nas homosexual and parents were religious\nand really didn't accept it and you know\nthe poor person was just hoping one day\nthat like their parents would come\naround as the world changes is like it\nbecomes more common like one day\nhopefully my parents will accept me they\nhad grandkids\nlike you know they were hoping to be\naccepted and like\nparents were interested in the kids but\nnot in any way so it's all kind of it\ngets tangled up\nso oftentimes even in the case of\nparents or the loved one that we didn't\nget along well with the mourning process\nstill happens right like it still needs\nto happen\ngood question\nso there's a good question so i'm the\neldest grandchild and my younger cousins\nwho are 18 and 13 old just lost their\nmother we live in kind of a joint family\nsetup how do i help them keep being\noptimistic and not lose their way in the\nfuture so i think that's a fantastic\nquestion so if you're trying to help\nsomeone go through grief\nremember that you are a source of their\nidentity okay so this is the main thing\nthat i'd say so continue being that\nsource of their identity right so like\nremember the way they think about\nthemselves the way they think about the\nfuture are going to be shaped by you so\nyou don't want to keep them\nbeing optimistic you want to let them\nlose their optimism\nand then gain it back right so if your\n18 year old cousin is for example going\nto college like i would sit them down\nand say like hey are you worried about\ngoing to college and think a little bit\nabout like\num you know what would mom do for an 18\nyear old who's going to college like\nthey're going to help you move into your\ndorm they're going to like decorate your\nthing they're going to buy you laundry\ndetergent they're going to teach you how\nto do laundry these are all the aspects\nof mourning right\nso maybe they still have a dad in the\npicture\nand they have another parent in the\npicture and if they do then like you\nknow that parent may do some of it but\nthat parent may feel incredibly\noverwhelmed sending their youngest i\nmean oldest kid off to college\nso that's where like as the eldest\ngrandchild\nyou know you can step up some so you can\noffer to help them move in there's all\nkinds of things that mom would do so\nit's like it can be helpful for you to\nsort of step up and try to do some of\nthose things and the signal that you're\nsending to them slowly is like even with\nthis loss like your your life is going\nto be okay there are other people around\nwho love you there are other people\naround who are going to take care of you\nall the things that mom can't do for you\nanymore like that's okay like there are\nother people around and i'm one of them\nas 18 year old or 13 year olds start to\ncrush on people or as they start to you\nknow like get into relationships just be\nthere for them\nand so that's the cool thing is you know\nwe said at the very beginning that every\nperson who passes away leaves on on\naverage nine people bereaved\nand the cool thing is that those nine\npeople can come together and support\neach other through that loss\nright so it's okay for them to lose\noptimism but be there for them you know\ntry to give them a positive sense of\nidentity try to be available for them\ntry to step up and do what the lost\nperson may want to do but don't overdo\nit right let them sort of dictate so\nit's not like you suddenly want to step\ninto mom's shoes and become the new mom\nlike don't don't\noverdo it\nbut be available to them\nsomeone else is asking how to mourn if\nit's been a long time so like the\nprocess is still the same right so why\ndo people get stuck in prolonged morning\nit's because they don't do that\nreintegration\nand so how many years have passed is\nactually kind of relevant like it may be\nrelevant from like a clinical\nperspective and diagnosing you with this\nor that but at the end of the day if\nsomeone comes into my office with\nprolonged grief like i'm gonna go\nthrough the morning process with them\nright we're gonna do i mean i'm not\ngonna lay this out laid out for them\nlike that but\nyou know the way i have for y'all but\nthat's what i do in my mind right i\nthink as someone comes into my office i\nstart to think a little bit about okay\nhow has this person's future changed\nhow has this person's identity changed\nhow is this person's life changed\nand then what we do in in therapy is we\ngo through each of those things right so\ni'll ask them pointed questions because\nthey may not like realize this because\nit's all kind of subconscious but i'll\nask them like you know what are holidays\nlike\noh holidays are fine\nand then they start crying and it's like\nwhat\nand then so you know as we start to like\nunpack that emotion\nthey work through holidays and then they\nwork through the fact that at their\nwedding their parents weren't there\nbecause they both passed away\nright and then what was it like you know\nhaving your spouse have such a huge part\nof the family but in your wedding\npictures like there was never a picture\nof you with your parents like what was\nthat like\nand they're like it sucked it hurt i\nfelt alone okay so like we talk about\nall that kind of stuff\nand i'll ask them how do you feel about\nyourself right so i'll ask questions\nabout identity\nand so then it's like we work through\nthat sense of identity and then we'll\nwork through like what does this mean\nfor the future you know what does this\nmean like are you afraid that you're\ngonna lose other people so sometimes\nlike you know there'll be fears that\nlike okay what if i wake up one day\nbecause i woke up one day and my parents\nwere no longer there\ni woke up one day and down was up and up\nwas down\nand then they're like what if i wake up\none day and my spouse isn't around what\nif i wake up one day and this happens\nwhat if what if what if right and as we\nget to the what ifs\nwhat we move to\nis this\nright so the uncertainty so the\nconstancy becomes the uncertainty\nand so in therapy we can like work\nthrough that stuff\nso okay so what is it like now having\nlost them like you know the world is an\nuncertain place that's scary tell me\nabout that\nright and so you can still go through it\nyears later it's totally fine\nit's just going through the process\ngood question\nshould i grief about getting bullied how\nexactly do i do that so\nyou can't necessarily i wouldn't say you\nshould grieve about getting bullied\ni think the right thing to grieve\nis the missed\nopportunity from the bullying right so\nlet's assume that you're in school for\nexample so high school maybe is supposed\nto be fun but since you got bullied you\ndid not have a regular high school\nexperience you had a bad high school\nexperience and you didn't make friends\nand you didn't do this and you didn't go\nto prom and you didn't so like all of\nthat stuff has to be grieved\nit's not the bullying itself it's the\nimpact of the bullying on your life\nwhich like you have to acknowledge and\nsay like yeah like other people got this\nand i didn't get this\nthat really sucks for me i feel really\nsad how do you feel about the future how\ndo you feel about your identity\nand so then the other kind of common\nthing so this is how some scars form for\nexample\nso super common thing that i see from\npeople get bullied\nis a some scar where they essentially\nare afraid of missing other\nopportunities\nso like if i'm bullied through high\nschool what happens like so like you\nknow i had a 20 year old college student\nfor example was bullied throughout high\nschool\nthey weren't bullied in middle school\nlike something weird happened in high\nschool they just started they became the\nbot of a joke\nand then it got like\nit was like gigi for the rest of high\nschool\nand so what they're afraid of what\nthey're paranoid about is that like\nsomething is going to happen in college\nand then like college is going to be gg\nwe're going to gg out of college\nbecause like now i'm going to be bullied\nat college and then like i miss this one\nopportunity and i'm okay with that but\ni'm so paranoid about college being\nscrewed\nand then also like when it comes to work\nthey're like i'm afraid that if it's\nlike i say the wrong thing at work then\neveryone's gonna start making fun of me\ni'm gonna be the butt of the joke at\nwork\nso this kind of fear that comes from\nthis missed opportunity in high school\nsits with them and starts to shape their\nbehavior\nparadoxically becomes a self-fulfilling\nprophecy\nbecause then now when they're at work\nlike they don't make jokes\nbecause they're afraid what if people\ntake the joke the wrong way what if they\nstart making fun of me because i said\nsomething stupid\nand so as a result like they don't make\nmany friends at work and they feel\nthemselves being marginalized and then\nthey get paranoid because they're like\noh my god it's happening again it's\nhappening again\nit's only a matter of time before they\nstart explicitly making fun of me\nright so that's all some scar so the\ngrieving process is very important\nbecause it like digests the samskar\nit works through all those negative\nemotions so then when you go to work\nwhen you go to school like you're not\nworried that something random will\nhappen and you will be like marginalized\nand bullied for the rest of next three\nyears\ngood questions\ncan you accelerate the grieving process\nshould you\ni mean that depends on how fast so i'd\nsay like you should give yourself four\nto six months but if you've been\ngrieving for a few years like i would\nabsolutely intentionally go through the\nprocess of mourning try to reintegrate\nyourself and like get on with your life\nright so this is where people may say\nlike maybe the right\nhow can i say this the right like\ntwitter instagram\nkind of response is like everyone\ngrieves at their own pace and you should\nlike let them do that like yeah it's a\ncomplicated process and that's true\nbut there's also a part of me that's\nsort of like if you've been grieving for\nsix years and you're not over it yet\nlike maybe you should accelerate the\nprocess and start living your life\nright like i'd say give yourself that's\nwhy that's why we added the time frame\nat the very beginning it's really\nimportant for people to understand that\ngrief can last up to a year\nand after four to six months you should\nbe like getting back on you know into it\nand why do i push people to grieve\nbecause you have life to live\nright so like\nyou know go through your morning process\nreintegrate yourself and then start\nenjoying life again\nyeah so someone's asking a question how\ndo i grieve being a 25 year old virgin\ngreat question\nso this is the important thing so the\nproblem with 25 year old virgins is that\nthey assume that their past performance\nis an indicator of like future returns\nright which if you guys know anything\nabout the stock market you know you\ncan't rely on so like this is the real\nproblem with a lot of people who you\nknow are 25 year old virgins is that\nthey make assumptions about the future\nlike i didn't realize that being a\nvirgin at the age of 25\nallowed you to see the future\nlike you can do that like that's dope\nmaybe that's what the celibates what's\nall the celibacy and yoga is about\ni don't mean to be unsympathetic but\nhonestly like\nyou know you can the trickiest thing is\nthat you're making this critically\nincorrect assumption that because you\nhaven't gotten laid at the age of 25\nyou're not going to get laid for the\nnext 25 years\nwhereas what i would say is that\nyou haven't gotten laid until you get\nlaid and that's just it's just a you\nknow it'll happen at some point it\nhappens for most people\nat some point\nand there are 24 year olds who are\nparanoid about it they're 18 year olds\nwho are paranoid about it there were 15\nyear olds who were paranoid about it\nthat they haven't gotten laid yet right\nand so things are going to happen at\nyour own pace and should you grieve that\nabsolutely like so you should miss out\nyou can you can go through the process\nof mourning and sort of like i didn't\nget laid in high school didn't get laid\nin college now i'm 25 still haven't\ngotten laid like\nwhoa it's me sure\nwhat does that mean about your identity\nfor example right\nit means that oh i'm a loser like you\nmay think those kinds of things about\nyourself\nso what does that mean for your future\nso all the things that we talked about\nare absolutely relevant here right so\nlike let's just\nrun through this example\nso accepting the loss right so like\nyou know\ndidn't get laid\naccepting the consequence of the loss\nright so i don't know exactly what that\nis but let's go to identity for a second\nyou know so you may identify as an incel\nor forever alone\nright so this changes your sense of\nidentity\nit changes your relationship to the\nobject of loss so sometimes people will\nstart to have resentment\ntowards the opposite sex or same sex\ndepending on you know where you are in\nthe hetero homosexual spectrum\nrestore the capacity to thrive this is\nabsolutely something you need to do\nright\nlook to the future with happiness and\noptimism absolutely something you need\nto do\nthis is where\nyou know so i think that like the\nmorning process is very important here\nright because like it maps on really\nreally well and this is why i like this\nas opposed to the kubler raw stages of\ngrief like it seems to map on to\nnon-death related morning processes but\nshould you mourn absolutely\nno question\nbecause the truth is that as you go\nthrough that healthy integration like\nyou'll be able to as you deal with the\nresentment that you have towards the\npeople that you know\nyou didn't get laid with\nyou'll set yourself up to like have\nhealthier relationships\nright\nso i think it's very important\nthis is where the person may feel a\nsense of identity like i'm a loser\nbecause i haven't gotten laid at the age\nof 25 whereas like that's not\nnecessarily true\nit's just you just haven't had sex it\ndoesn't that's it\nright that doesn't say anything about\nwho you are it's just an experience that\nyou haven't had\nlike\nyou know\ni've never been scuba diving\ndoesn't say anything about my identity\nexcept for the thing like is scuba\ndiving cool sure absolutely do i want to\ndo it sounds great\nbut that's just that's all it is\nyou"
