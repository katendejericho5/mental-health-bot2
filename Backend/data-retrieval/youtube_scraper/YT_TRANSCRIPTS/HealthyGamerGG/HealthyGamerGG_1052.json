    "transcript": "so\nlet's take a look at this post by\nsomeone who got fired from the job\ni got fired from my job because i was\nreally unhappy and was also vocal about\nit\nand i was also caught taking interviews\nfor other jobs on company time\nit's a weird situation because i liked\nmy job and was good at it but i hated\nthe company i worked for i'm feeling all\nsorts of things\nshock relief anxiety excitement any tips\nfor how to process big events like this\nthanks in advance i love this community\num\nso\nwhat we're going to talk about today\nwe're going to go into more detail in a\nsecond but like\nwhat does it mean for like how do you\nprocess this like what is the process of\nprocessing so i've worked with a lot of\npeople who have gone through large\nevents\nright everything from having their first\nchild to getting fired to\nbeing\nsexually assaulted and so how do you\nhelp someone what is the process\nof organizing this experience and like\nhow do you come out a count come out of\nit on the other side as healthy as\npossible right so what can we learn from\nthat's what we're going to dig into\nbefore we do that we need a little bit\nmore detail okay\nfor sure it's it's a really long story\nbut i'll do my best i was an employee at\na co\ni was a employee\ni was\nat an employee-owned company that did\nreally well with a bunch of invested\npassionate workers\nduring the panda pandemic the company\ngot sold to a mega large corporation and\nthey started making changes\nthe changes were expected but most of\nthem were really unfair cutting our sick\ndays more than half worse benefits no\noptions to become an owner leader in the\ncompany\nworse than that was the way that the new\ncompany communicated the changes never\nbeing straightforward always trying to\nmake the changes seem good for us but\nwhen you took a closer look they were\nbasically all negatives\ni found that at best unkind and careless\nand at worst\ninsulting and dishonest\ni would regularly talk about how upset\nthis behavior made me with coworkers\nthat i was close with and with some\nhigher up managers that i really felt\ncomfortable talking to silly me we're\ngonna zero in on that statement later\nokay so remember that\ni also spoke up occasionally in meetings\nwhen they were when things were really\nbad i basically felt like i deserved to\nbe treated better and at the very least\ndeserved honesty and that all of us from\nthe old company deserved to be treated\nbetter because they were a really strong\nteam and really well respected in the\nindustry\nin generally in general i'm someone that\nstruggles with perfectionism toxic\nproductivity and letting my emotions be\ngoverned by external circumstances or\nsuccesses\nsounds sound familiar\ni've never really failed anything much\nless been fired another really important\nthing to point out okay because that'll\nthat'll come in i've been in therapy for\na bit but i'm still feeling learning to\nfeel my emotions instead of suppressing\nthem but it sometimes\nis still scary or hard for me i fall\nback on my coping mechanism when i'm\nstressed a lot some healthy\ngym going for walks and some not not\nsmoking a ton of dope\ni guess i'm just looking for some\nsupport and tips for processing the\nfeelings in a healthy way\neven typing this out feels like it's\nhelped already look at that\nhope that clarifies a bit\nokay\nso\nwhat does it mean to process\nas we go through life things happen to\nus right\nand those things aren't necessarily good\nand when bad things happen to us there's\nthis idea that like\nif you process it correctly you'll be\nlike stronger afterward right\nso how like and so everyone's kind of\nthinking like oh like i'm still\nprocessing like i want to process like\nyou know i need to process this how do i\nprocess this correctly but i've never\nseen anyone that says here is how you\nprocess here are the steps here the\ngoals this is what we should do here's\nthe game plan okay if you do this stuff\nyou will process and it'll be great\nnow we learned this stuff as clinicians\nright even then like i was never taught\nin therapy like this is what you do it\nwas never described to me like that it's\nlike here are the skills that we teach\nhere's a bunch of weird like\npsychological principles like jung's\nshadow the edible complex here's eric's\nericsson stages of conflict and growth\nand stuff like that that here's maslow's\nhierarchy of needs and\nself-actualization\nyou know here's aaron beck's model of\nthe mind here's judith back's like\nimprovement on the model of the mind\nhere's sigmund freud's theories here's\nanna freud's defense mechanisms\nbut nowhere in my therapy training which\nyou know was okay but maybe not the best\nyou know who knows i'm not saying it\nisn't taught elsewhere no one was like\nwhen someone comes in here's what you\nshould do a b c d e f g so we get some\nof that with cognitive behavioral\ntherapy or dialectical behavioral\ntherapy or manualized therapy so we do\nget that right\nbut we don't get that for something like\nthis right so it's therapy you'll you'll\nlearn manualized treatment for here's\nhow you deal with someone who has uh you\nknow a social phobia right like here's\nexposure therapy here are the steps of\nexposure therapy but in\ntraining to become a therapist you focus\non clinical problems you don't focus on\nnon-clinical problems so they don't like\nyou're not going to learn like if you're\nbecoming a psychiatrist or a\npsychologist at least in most places\nyou're not going to learn like how do\nyou what's the game plan what's the\nmanualized treatment for someone who's\nbeen fired for the first time in their\nlife because it's not an illness right\nso we'll have manualized treatments for\nillness but we won't have like\nmanualized treatments for stuff that\nhappens in life\nso now what i'd like to do today is is\ntalk to you all a little bit about like\nwhat it means to process\nand so this too like therapists can\nabsolutely help you do because like we\nlearn all the steps for clinical stuff\nand then in practically in our day job\nwe learn how to like adapt these things\nto\nnon-clinical things right so therapists\ncan help you with this stuff but it's\nnot something that's formally tr taught\nso let's talk a little bit about\nhow\ndo\ni process\nokay\nso the first thing is we have to define\nprocessing\nso here's i here's what i would say like\nthis is just my kind of off the cuff\nexample or\nframework for understanding processing\nso the first thing that i'd say is that\nevents have emotional impacts\nokay\nso if you get fired for example you're\ngonna feel\nbetrayed you're gonna feel taken\nadvantage of you're gonna feel\nincompetent right so you feel like the\ncompany let you down\nmaybe this person is feeling betrayed by\nthat manager that they were talking to\nthey're gonna feel abandoned\nthey're gonna feel inadequate\nright because they've never been fired\nbefore\nthere's like\ntwo kinds of people in this world right\nthere are people who\nget promoted and people who get fired\nand the people who get fired are people\nwho are incompetent right so we'll get\nto that in a second\nso you may be feeling all this kind of\nstuff and then this in turn like these\nemotions are gonna have like impacts on\nyour body\nor your life okay\nso let's remember that like these\nemotional impacts are not just in your\nmind right so you may have difficulty\nsleeping\nyou may have like difficulty with\nmotivation\nyou may feel like it's hard to apply for\na job\nor go to an interview\nyou may feel jaded\nright and this is where we'll talk about\nthis for a second\nor we'll you may feel jaded right so all\nthese things are happening\nokay\nso one step of processing is going to be\nlike dealing with these emotions\nand this is sort of the most common\nthing that people will think about right\nit's to no longer feel guilty and\nashamed\nbut then there's more to it\nso remember that from the vedic\npsychology of the mind\nwhen we feel negative emotions we have\nthis part of our mind called the ego\nand the ego's goal is to help us like\nfeel better about ourselves and to\ndevelop a sense of identity that helps\nus navigate the world\nso emotions then relate to our identity\nso this is where remember how we said\nlike feeling inadequate so we'll use\nthis as an example\nthere are two kinds of people in this\nworld\ni have\nnever\nbeen\nfired\nright and let's look at what this\nperson's identity is\nso\num\nso i was i liked my job and was good at\nit was good\nat\nmy job\nright and was also like i was worked at\nan employee-owned company that did\nreally well passionate workers\nso did well\npassionate right so now let's let's kind\nof like\nlook at this for a second right so\nhere's number one number two number\nthree\nso how do you think before this person\ngot fired like how do you think they\nthought about themselves right i'm a\ndedicated person i'm a hard worker i'm a\ngood worker i did well enough to where\nthe company got acquired during the\npandemic\nthis is who i am\noh thanks for the tons of sub uh subs\ngifted subs res me please\num\nso\nthis is how you view yourself right and\nthen you get fired\nand then like now suddenly there's a\nthere's a huge discrepancy between these\ntwo things\nbecause like here's one kind of person\nand here's another kind of person who\ngets fired people who are like lazy\npeople who are incompetent those are the\npeople that get fired right we have this\nsort of societal conditioning that this\nis how you get fired\nand so this creates an identity conflict\nand then this in turn is going to affect\nyour behaviors\nokay\nso once we once our identity gets kind\nof confused right like are we like am i\na good worker or a bad worker like what\nkind of worker am i\nso and then you may say like well why is\nthat relevant like what do you mean by\nthat so this is what i mean so when you\ngo to a job interview like how confident\nare you gonna be\nright like what are you are you a loser\nthat got fired or are you like someone\nwho is a passionate hard worker who\nbuilt something with a team of people\nlike it's kind of confusing\nso processing involves resolving\nthis identity conflict so that it no\nlonger negatively shapes your behaviors\nright so if we don't resolve it we can\nhave negative\nbehaviors and then if we do resolve it\nwe can actually have positive behaviors\nafter that so let's just look at like\nthe job application\nand the interview process\nwhich is going to be affected\nby like me getting fired okay\nso am i a good worker am i a bad worker\ni don't really know\num\nand so if we think about\nhow we get affected by things so we can\nsee this in the case of trauma as well\nright so let's say that i get\num you know i go through a traumatic\nexperience so like i go to let's say\nlike i'm driving a car one day\nand um i get hit by another car so\nthere's gonna be like some kind of\nemotional impact i'm gonna feel afraid\nright\nand then like i'm gonna start to wonder\nam i a bad driver\nso then like there's fear\nright and then there's like good driver\nor bad driver\nso i i used to pride myself on being a\ngood driver because i had never been in\nan accident\ni'm a good driver i've never been in an\naccident there are all these people out\nthere who are incompetent drivers they\nget in accidents all the time\nso it's like an emotional element and\nthen we can see even in this simple\nexample like automatically like am i a\ngood driver or am i a bad driver and you\nhave to kind of like think through that\nwork through that\nit can even affect your behavior it's\nlike now what's gonna happen is i'ma\ndrive less\nwhy because maybe i'm a bad driver oh my\ngod right so my confidence is affected\nso it's gonna affect my behavior so if\nwe think about processing so what would\nbe the goal of like therapy with this\nperson is to like help them you know\ndigest this fear help them resolve their\nidentity and help them like move their\nbehaviors in the right direction\nso what would that look like in this\ncase right so this is where like you\nknow if i was this person's um\nyou know if i was working with this\nperson or advising this person\nlike it's not necessarily like a\ntherapeutic thing so i'm not offering\nmedical advice here but like even for my\nfriends for example who have been fired\nhere's how i would help them kind of\nreconceptualize things i've\nreconceptualized things myself so i can\noffer this example as well\nso you know i would start by sort of\nacknowledging what you're feeling right\nand sort of like recognize that\nthis is\nimportant so it starts with\nacknowledgement\nthen what i'd also do for emotional\nprocessing\nis\nadjust kind of\nbehaviors related to emotion i know we\ntalked about behaviors down here but\nwhat i mean by this is like i'd start\ndoing things like going for a walk\nspending time in nature\nmaybe journaling\nright\nand people may be like oh but what good\ndoes journaling do\nboom\nboom\nboom that's all you need\nright\nso like they didn't say they didn't say\nit over here this was the first version\nof the post\nand then i asked them for more\ninformation\ni commented on this post which sometimes\ni i do from time to time and then they\nwrote this\nand somehow adding this element\nseems to have helped some\nso this is the process of acknowledging\nyour emotions\nright and somehow that's like in and of\nitself is like healthy and helps people\nright and then you can also definitely\nlike you know depending on the scale of\nwhat you're processing\ntherapy is definitely an option and in\nfact recommended depending on what\nhappened to you right so if you had a\nseriously traumatic experience like\nif you were assaulted or something like\nthat then i think you should absolutely\ngo see a therapist you can also do\nthings like coaching but that also\ndepends on the severity of what you're\ndealing with\nso this is where if you're not sure\nwhich one's appropriate i would start\nwith just like going to your primary\ncare physician your general practitioner\nsay hey i'm going through this do you\nthink this is something that i would\nneed to see a therapist for right so you\nshould have some kind of medical\nrelationship if you don't have any\nmedical relationship with a general\npractitioner or primary care physician\nthat everyone should get right so like\nbasic advice is everyone should get an\nannual physical and see a doctor at\nleast once a year so start there and the\nreason for that is like you can ask them\nquestions like this right general\npractitioners they may not be\npsychiatrists but they'll be able to say\nlike okay like they'll be able to do\nbasic assessments right they're\ncompetent mental health and they'll say\nyou know what i think that you would\nbenefit from a referral\nso coaches can also help with this kind\nof stuff assuming it's non-clinical in\nnature so if you have like ptsd or\nsomething coaching is not appropriate\nbut if you're trying to figure out like\nhow to you know help like how to manage\nyour emotions and prepare for a job\ninterview that's something that's more\naligned with coaching\nokay\nnext thing that happens is your identity\nso this is where you got to do some work\nokay\nso often times the the work that we have\nto do with when i say you have to do\nsome work with identity what i mean by\nthat\nis this not\nhighlight no okay i guess not whatever\nwhat i mean by that is that you have to\nsort of come to terms with who you are\nnow and like do some kind of work so\ni'll give you guys an example of what i\ndid\nso there are smart kids\nand there are stupid kids\nsmart kids have good gpas\nthis is what used to happen in my mind\nstupid kids have bad gpas\nokay\nsmart kids\nbecome doctors\nand stupid kids\ndon't become doctors\nso\ni'm applying to medical school\nright\nam i a smart kid or i'm a stupid kid i\nwas told growing up that i'm a smart kid\nbut i have a bad gpa and i certainly\nhaven't been getting into medical school\nso my ego was hurting my identity was\nhurting i felt like\nyou know am i stupid or am i smart i\nfelt dumb\nand i started to like really think about\nit and kind of work through it and then\nwhat happens is at some point and i\nimagine this is the case for this person\nas well\ni've i wound up in a medical school\ninterview\nright\nso and this person will probably wind up\nin a job interview at some point and if\nyou've gotten fired one of the most\nterrifying things\nto think about is like they're going to\nask you what happened at your last job\nand then you don't want to say or admit\nor and because all the shame that comes\nwith like i was fired because then\nthey're going to think you're in this\nbucket\nright\nbut you like don't want to lie so like\nhow do you manage that\nso here's what i said in my medical\ninterview they asked me like what's up\nwith your gpa\nand i said well like when i was in\ncollege like i really didn't know what i\nwanted to do in life and so i didn't\napply myself in school and so i got a\nbad gpa this is the third year i'm\napplying to medical school you know i've\ntaken more and more classes since then\nif you look at the last two years of the\nclasses i've taken my gpa is pretty good\nso i realized like\nthis is actually what i want to do and i\nrecognize that a lot of people would\nhave quit because\ngood gpas are a requirement to get into\nmedical school and i recognize that i\ndon't meet that requirement but i'm\ndedicated to doing this i've worked my\nass off i've gotten a good gpa the last\ntwo years and if y'all let me into your\nschool i can guarantee you i'm not going\nto slack off\ni've slacked off once in my life and\ni've learned the consequences of\nslacking off\nand i can guarantee you that i will work\nreally really hard if given this\nopportunity\nand even though i've been given other\nopportunities to switch careers this is\nwhat i'm really dedicated towards i\nrealize it's a long shot but i have my\nheart set on it i'm willing to do\nwhatever it takes\nyou own it\nright\nso like that's an identity thing that\nyou have to like you have to arrive at\nthat conclusion\nand you have to say\ni'm not i don't have a good gpa but it's\nnot about being a smart kid or a stupid\nkid\nlike neither of those things apply i did\nnot talk about smart or stupid at all\ni want to become a doctor this is what i\nwant this is what i have this is what i\ncan offer\nand so very concretely like this person\nis going to be thinking a little bit\nabout what to say in the job interview\nbecause you got fired right so this is\nwhat i would if i was in this person's\nshoes is what i would say\nso i'm dedicated and i'm hard working\ni was at an employee-owned company and\nwe did such a good job during the\npandemic that a public company wanted to\nacquire us\nonce the public company acquired us they\nstarted to institute some changes i'm a\nhard worker who's willing to go the\nextra mile but as they instituted more\nand more changes i thought that those\nwere unfair so they cut back on our\nvacation they did this they did this\nthey did this\nso i voiced my concerns to upper\nmanagement because i believe in\nproviding useful feedback to my employer\ni do believe it is because i provided\nuseful feedback in my old company that\nwe did as well as we did\nright so when i saw problems at work i\nwould voice my concerns about them they\nwould sort of get addressed and then\nlike we did better as a whole team\nand so i'm a team player i'm a hard\nworker but the company didn't really\nlike that i was you know\nasking for things that i felt were fair\nand so i think that those are good i\nthink the fact that the company is\nprofitable profitable and got acquired\nis like\na sign that what i was doing as well and\nif you let me come work for you this is\nwhat you can expect i'm going to work\nreally hard i'm going to be really\ninvested\nyou can talk a little bit about that\nperfectionism and you don't want to talk\nabout that in the interview but i think\nit's okay and at the same time like you\nknow i\nif i have concerns with the way that the\nbusiness is operating i would hope that\nyou know you would have an open mind to\nlike those concerns i'm not necessarily\nsaying that you guys need to do it but\ni'm someone who tends to provide\nfeedback for the goal of like improving\nthe mission of what we do here\nand i was at a company that didn't want\nthat\nright\nso they fired me which i think is okay\nlike i don't think it was a good fit so\nif you want someone who is a team player\na hard worker and can build a business\nto the point where it's like lucrative\nand a lucrative acquisition then i'm\nyour person\nbut if you're looking for someone who\nyou know is\nlike if you all are looking to\nactually i wouldn't say i wouldn't add a\nbutt i would just stop there\nright so you can own who you are and you\ncan own the fact that you got fired\nand so you can sort of like let them\nmake a decision on that right so be the\nperson that you are and recognize that\nyou know you have to be a little bit\ncalculating there because\nbut if you want\nyeah you should just stop there so\nthere's some calculation here where you\ngot to play play you know a little bit\nof the game of like putting forward your\nbest foot you don't want to come across\nas a troublemaker but at the same time\nyou want to say like i share feedback\nwith with things and\nbased on that feedback like things got\nbetter right\nand so i found that i was at a company\nthat was really not interested in like\nthe opinions of their employees um was\nnot interested in feedback and i didn't\ndo anything negligent\nright they just decided to fire me which\nis fine like that's okay if they don't\nwant me there i know i bring a lot of\nvalue to whatever team i'm on i think\nthe key thing that i would highlight\nhere for this person's case is that the\ncompany got acquired which means you\nwere doing something right\nokay\nand so that's when we kind of get to so\nas you work through that right so then\nyou think a little bit about okay why\ndid i get fired and like the answer is\nlike you got fired because\nyou are willing to work hard right you\nhave some of that toxic productivity but\nyou're learning to set boundaries\nand so you didn't get fired because you\nwere incompetent maybe you got fired\nbecause you were taking interviews on\ncompany time so that's a mistake right\nso you got to be careful about that\nright so if they're paying you for an\nhour of work and you are doing something\nthat is personally beneficial on company\ntime that's something that you should be\ncareful about\nbut\nif the reason that you got fired is\nbecause you were setting boundaries with\nyour employer and they did not like\nthose boundaries and chose to fire you i\nthink that's fine\nright that's something that like you\nshould do and is healthy for you because\nyou don't want to stay at that company\nlike if they're cutting back on all your\nstuff and expecting the same level of\nwork from you and not compensating you\nthe same way then that's like not really\nfair for you there may be some\nconsiderations there like if they're\nacquiring you and because of the\npandemic if business is slow or things\nlike that if this is there's also an\nassumption i have here that this is like\nnot a consolidation because things are\nbad and this is because y'all were doing\na good job\nso there's some aspects like that where\ncompanies have to make adjustments\nduring difficult times\nand so but i'm not hearing that\nyou know that's actually what is going\non\nand so what i what i'm hearing about why\nyou got fired is maybe you were you did\nkind of screw up if you were like doing\nnon-company work on company time and the\nsecond thing is that like you were\ntrying to set healthy boundaries for\nyourself and you want to be at a company\nwhere people like listen to what you\nhave to say and you like get treated\nwith respect which i think is totally\nfine and if they don't if they want to\nfire you like that's okay you can choose\nto part ways\nright being being fired doesn't mean\nthat\nyou're bad at your job it just means\nthat your employer no longer wants you\ndoing that job because of all kinds of\nfactors\nso just like quitting doesn't like if i\nquit my job that doesn't mean that the\njob is bad it just means i don't want to\ndo it anymore right it doesn't mean that\nthe employer is bad like i quit my job\nat\nharvard medical school in massachusetts\ngeneral hospital it's a wonderful place\nto work it's just not the work that i\nwanted to do doesn't say anything bad\nabout those things\nright like they're still wonderful\ninstitutions it's fantastic jobs\nit's just not the one that i wanted and\nsimilarly like from an identity\nperspective getting fired doesn't\nnecessarily mean you were a bad person\nor bad at your job it just means that\nyour employer no longer wants you\nworking in that position like there was\nsomeone recently like who laid off like\na thousand people on zoom right for like\nbetter.com or something and like that\nmay have nothing to do with those\npeople's work performance it doesn't\nmean that you're bad at your job like i\ndon't know the details of that but\npeople fire employees like an employment\nagreement is like between a company and\nan employee right like so you've got two\nparties that agree that okay there's\nthis is an exchange of stuff that we are\nboth comfortable with\nand then either of those parties can say\nhey we're no longer we're gonna break up\nand just because you break up does not\nmean that like\nyou are deficient or they are deficient\nsometimes it does but doesn't always\nmean that\nokay\nso now let's talk a little bit about\nbehaviors\nso this is where you've got to be a\nlittle careful\nokay\nso if you're thinking about\nbehaviors like what should i do next\ntime so this is the last piece of\nprocessing\nso once we process our emotions once we\nsort of work through our sense of\nidentity and come to terms with who we\nare we have to integrate\nour experience\nfor the future\nso this is the final step of processing\nso how am i going to take everything\nthat's happened and what am i gonna do\ntomorrow\nso in the case of the car accident like\nhow am i gonna drive okay i'm gonna well\ni was like i'm oftentimes texting while\ni'm driving so maybe i shouldn't do that\nright so you can like change what you do\nokay so from from a business perspective\nlike how should you change your behavior\nso the first thing is i would be a\nlittle bit careful\nabout\ndelivering feedback willy-nilly\nso like if you're just kind of like\ndelivering feedback\nall the time\nuh so like\nconstantly\nversus in a focused way\ni think that may not be good because\nthis delivering feedback all the time is\ncomplaining\nso you're gonna come across in the\nworkplace as like someone who just\ncomplains\nand the interesting thing is that like\nthe more often you say it like the less\nlikely people people are to take you\nseriously\nso if your mom is like nagging you about\ndoing laundry and she tells you every 10\nminutes hey put away the laundry put\naway the laundry put away the laundry\nput away the laundry she may have a\npoint you may have said you were gonna\ndo it but what does it incline you to do\nlike i don't want to do that\nright so it's like so i would adjust the\nway that you deliver your feedback\nfor sure so if you have like particular\ncomplaints like i would synthesize them\ndeliver them like succinctly to your\nboss and say hey here's some concerns i\nhave\nwhat do you think about these concerns\nso i do not think that so this is the\nkey thing so here's a problem so\nsometimes when people end up in this\nsituation i see a lot of this like\nsentiment on the internet\nthat i would regularly talk about how\nthis behavior upset me with my\nco-workers and i was close with him with\nwith some higher up managers i felt\nreally comfortable talking to silly me\nso the lesson that this person is taking\naway is don't talk to your managers\nabout what you are unhappy with\nthis is a dangerous lesson to learn in\nmy mind this is the equivalent of stop\ndriving\nright so this is where the place you\nwork is very very important because\nideally like the best working scenario\nis where you can\ntalk to your hire managers and if you're\na good manager you want your employees\ntalking to you about what's hard\nright so i'll give you guys just a quick\nexample about this\nso when i was working when i was in\nresidency at mgh\num there was an issue where we would be\non backup call so what backup call means\nis that like some people are on call\nevery single day\nand then you have a week of backup call\nwhich means that if someone gets sick\nsomewhere in the hospital you're the\nperson who has to fill in if it's a\nvital kind of thing right so if someone\nlike if someone is\nmanaging the emergency room overnight if\nsomeone is doing consults in the\nhospital overnight and they get sick and\nthey can't reschedule because like you\nknow you can't close the emergency room\nbecause a doctor isn't working there and\ncalled in sick right it's not like an\noutpatient office where you can take a\nday off like there's some things that\nyou have to have a doctor there\nso you have a person who's designated as\nbackup\nso the problem was that what would\nhappen is like the utilization in the\nhospital was so high like the residency\nwas big right so we've got like\nlet me think make sure i have this right\nwe have like 50 some odd residents\nokay\nso and they're filling all these\ndifferent roles at like different\nhospitals so there's like a handful of\nhospitals you've got 50 residents\non a week of backup there's like a 60 to\n70 chance on any given day that you get\ncalled in\nso like 60 70 of the time like you can\nexpect to work three or four of those\ndays\nnow the challenge is that when you work\nthose days like you have to stop doing\nyour job so your job is non-vital so\nyou're doing outpatient medicine so i\nhave my like therapy appointments and\nthings like that right so those can be\nrescheduled it's non-emerge it's\nnon-emergent things doesn't mean that\nthey're not important but it's\nnon-emergent so i can reschedule like a\npsycho farm appointment if i need to\nso we were kind of frustrated with this\nbecause basically what happened is on\nthe week of backup like we would have to\nreschedule a bunch of patients because\nwe knew we were going to get called and\nwe didn't know which day we were going\nto get called in but chances are we're\ngoing to get called in statistically\nright which means then i have to like\nmake eight phone calls reschedule eight\npatients adjust my schedule and all that\nkind of stuff and i do that once i've\ngotten called in so they call me at like\nlet's say i've got therapy appointments\ntomorrow morning at eight am and i got\nget called at seven pm hey the overnight\nperson is sick so i go to the hospital\nat 7 pm and then like while i'm working\nin the emergency room i have to cancel\nmy 8 am appointment with someone else\nso i call them at like 8 p.m and i'm\nlike hey i got to cancel my appointment\nthey may not get it in time they may\nwake up tomorrow not realize it whatever\nso our program went to our program\nleadership and we're like hey this is\nsuper frustrating and it's like really\nhard for us because we have to like\ncancel patients all the time\nso based on that feedback our program\nleadership was awesome by the way and\nthey were like okay so this is what\nwe're gonna have you do\nbasically from here on forward when you\nare on primary backup you no longer need\nto go to work\nbecause you all get called in so much\nright so we like presented the stuff and\nwe like gave it i mean i wasn't a big\npart of this it was other people in the\nresidency that did an awesome job but\nthey're like hey here's what's going on\nwe get called in 70 of the time it's a\nreal pain in the ass we're not seeing\nthese patients anyway\nand the leadership was like cool like\nit's basically like a week of vacation\ndon't i mean you can't leave it's not\nvacation but you guys don't have to do\nany other duties if you don't want to\nyou can be excused from all of your\nother clinical work\nso that wouldn't have happened if you\ndon't go talk to management about your\nconcerns\nthe key thing is like is management like\nlistening to you or not do they care\nabout you or not it doesn't mean that\nthey have to do what you have to say\nbecause management may have a thousand\ndifferent things to consider that you\nare not aware of right so like they\ncan't just make policies to make you\nhappy because they're like other things\ninvolved\nright and so this is where the the\nindividual employees start to like this\nis what's challenging is that like they\nmay not understand that right like you\njust see things from your perspective\nyou don't understand like what the other\nneeds that are pulling on management are\nbut this is where in terms of like\nbehavioral integration\nyou know if you get fired from a job\nit's like what are the lessons\nthat are\ncorrect\nto learn because not all the lessons\nthat your mind learns are going to be\ncorrect\nso from the the and this is what happens\nwhen you incorrectly process stuff right\nso if i like if i'm\ndating someone they cheat on me and the\nlesson that i learn is never date again\nlike that's an appropriate lesson it's\nlike a logical lesson but it's not like\nthe correct lesson it's it's not the\nlesson that you learn\nfrom like processing so oftentimes our\nbehaviors will get adjusted in a drastic\nand sort of like very like\nblack and white way like don't ever talk\nto management don't ever date again\ndon't ever drive again right those are\nthe things that until we correctly\nprocess we start to like swing the\npendulum in the other direction and so\nproper processing is about thinking okay\nlike what did i do right\nright and what did i do wrong\nand what can i do better\nand then also like what should i\ncontinue doing\nand i don't know if this makes sense but\nall of these things are going to be\ninfluenced by your identity by your\nemotional state\nso if we talk about what is emotional\nlike how do you process an event\nright whether it's your first kiss\nor\nlike getting fired\nit's gonna involve all these steps like\nlet's run through the first kiss example\nso\nhad my first kiss emotionally i'm over\nthe moon\noh my god i'm loved she loves me he\nloves me whatever\ni've become a chad i've left i've left\nthe the the realm of the betas and i've\nentered in the chat mode behavior\nhey\nwhen can we meet up\n15 minutes later hey when can we meet up\nhey when can we meet up hey i've been\nthinking about you all the time i've\nbeen thinking about you all the time i\ncan't stop thinking about you i can't\nstop thinking about you why aren't you\ntexting me back why aren't you texting\nme back why aren't you texting me back\ndid i do something wrong what's going on\ndid i screw up was i not a good kiss am\ni not\na good\nkisser\nright so even like a positive thing\nif not processed correctly\nif you don't consider how it affects\nyour identity\nif you don't consider how it affects\nyour behaviors will end up problematic\nso the three fundamental steps of\nprocessing are first of all understand\nthe emotions\nsecondly how those emotions are going to\ninfluence your view of yourself\nwhether in the confident realm or the\nnon-confident realm\nright\nand then ultimately that your emotions\nand your sense of identity changing are\ngoing to shape your behaviors\nand that's where you've got to be really\ncareful because there may be things that\nyou need to be doing better but there\nmay be things that you actually don't\nwant to change\nright because now if you if the lesson\nyou take away from this experience is\ndon't ever talk to your managers and you\nhave a nice manager at a job and you\nhave a problem what you're doing is\nshooting yourself in the foot\nyou're handicapping yourself on\ndelivering feedback what you need to do\nis get better at delivering feedback by\nall means\nbut i would argue that like if you're at\na place where you cannot talk to your\nmanager that's not a good place that to\nstay\nright it doesn't mean that they have to\nacquiesce to what you're saying all the\ntime it's just like you know like there\nare two sides to every story and if your\nmanager says hey by the way the reason\nyou got fired is because we were paying\nyou to do this job and instead of doing\nthis job you were doing you were looking\nfor another job like you can look for\nanother job in your free time\nright and that's where like the ego\nreally comes in you got to be super\ncareful here because the ego will say oh\nthey didn't they fired me because i was\nlooking for another job no we didn't\nfire you because you were looking for a\njob we fired you because you were\nlooking for a job on company time when\nwe were paying you to do something else\nright like\nand maybe they fired you because you\nwere looking for another job but that's\ndoesn't make sense and right\nlike\ni mean maybe it does i don't know but\nlike\nso this is where you got to be super\ncareful especially about that identity\nor ego piece\nand ultimately processing is sort of\nlike moving forward and integrating all\nthese experiences in a healthy way\nmaking like healthy adjustments and how\ndo you know it's a healthy adjustment\nit's tricky right so that that's where\nlike if you go through this process\nof acknowledging your emotions right\nthat that's where like this is where the\ntricky thing comes in because people say\nokay but how do i know it's healthy and\nit's like that starts up here\nbecause once you're of calm mind and\nonce you understand your identity you'll\nknow which behaviors are healthy the\nwhole point is that you can't tell the\ndifference between a healthy and an\nunhealthy adaptation until you do this\nprerequisite work right\nthis is an example of an unhealthy\nadaptation because when was this written\nlike higher up in the like paragraph i\nguarantee and i can't guarantee you but\ni would say strongly that as this person\ncontinues to type these things out if\nthey were to like respond to this and\nlike tell like if i were to ask them how\ndo you feel about things now what are\nyou thinking now that some of these\nsentiments at the top of the like\nparagraph would change\nright that's what emotional processing\nis you start to develop detachment you\nstart to develop objectivity you're no\nlonger thinking with your emotions you\ncan acknowledge your emotions you want\nto acknowledge the influence of your\nemotions you may even want to listen to\nyour emotions\nbut they're not controlling you it's you\nlistening to them\nemotions shouldn't be ignored they\nshould be integrated into your behaviors\nright they're useful source of\ninformation\nand that's what emotional processing is\nnot just emotional processing processing\nand experience rather\nquestions\nit's not facts over feelings okay this\nis important\nit's facts plus feelings\nright because like just think this is\nthe stupid thing about facts over\nfeelings\nwhat is a fact\nright like this is where like facts\nlike so a lot of times what people who\nsay facts over feelings don't\nacknowledge that there is a step of\ninterpretation of facts\nright like\nsure like fact is truth but then that's\nnot usually what we're actually talking\nabout there's usually some kind of\ninterpretation\nlike 90 of the time there's some kind of\ninterpretation\nand so like you have to acknowledge that\ninterpretation because it's just like so\ni had a statistics professor once told\nme that\nyou know statistics don't lie\nright because they're facts\nbut\nstatistics are like a bikini\nwhat they reveal is enticing but what\nthey conceal is vital\nso just because it's a statistical fact\ndoes not mean it is truth\nright there's an interpretation i'll\ngive you guys just a simple example\nin order to get into medical school in\nthe united states if you are asian or\nsouth asian\nyou have to have higher scores than\npeople of other ethnicities\ndoes that mean that asians or south\nasians are smarter than other people no\nsome people may interpret it that way\nsome people may look at like gpas of\nasians and south asians and say oh look\ntheir gpas are higher therefore they are\nsmarter no that's incorrect the gpa\nbeing higher may be a fact but the\ninterpretation is very important this is\nwhere like if you guys will listen to\nthe parenting lecture why do you think\nwe're better at math we're not like it's\nnot like biologically we're better at\nmath or maybe we are i've never seen\nevidence to that effect\nit's because when we're growing up it's\nlike my parents are like\nthey're making me do like multiplication\ntables\nat dinner time\ninstead of like\nlearning how to draw\nright it's because culturally we\nemphasize a certain thing there's the\nother thing about some of these like you\nknow racial interpretations is like it's\nnot like if you go to india everyone's\nindian\nright so that that difference doesn't\nexist there there are all kinds of\nsocioeconomic status immigrant status\nall kinds of diaspora effects for some\nof these things\nbut the fact is the fact but there's\nalways an interpretation\nright like the overwhelming evidence is\nthat like people who make conclusions\nabout this kind of stuff\nare there's there's a conclusion that's\nit's not facts over feelings it's facts\nplus feelings\nyou know and this is the other thing is\nthat you may not like us\ngive you\nto talk about the same example again\nso\nback when i was a kid and i would like\nyou know be walking by my parents\nfriends and they would ask me who do you\nlike more your mom or your dad if you\nguys remember that example\nright i'm looking at that seems like an\ninnocent question they're like the fact\nis that they're asking about a\npreference that i have right that's the\nfact\nbut my feeling when everyone's looking\nat me and grinning\nis like an important piece of\ninformation this is some kind of test\ni'm on trial they're looking for\nsomething right\nso motions are our brain's way of giving\nus like information incredibly quickly\nbecause cognitive processing and\nanalytical thinking or slow\nit's type 2 reasoning daniel kahneman\nyou guys want a book recommendation go\nread thinking fast and slow\nso our brain has realized oh by the way\nwe have this like awesome thing called\nthe limbic system which can give you\ninstant answers and can like give you\nlike pretty good indications of what you\nshould be doing\nthere's shortcomings to it right because\nit's like quick and dirty but it works\nyou know so it's not facts over feelings\nit's facts plus feelings that's really\nthe right way to like approach things\nother questions\nthinking fast and slow is a hard greed\nyou're damn right it is\nit's a slog\ndoes this relate to manipura chakra\nmeditation absolutely well done king\nkrish live\nso manipura chakra meditation is\nsomething that i will use for emotional\nprocessing\nright but there's no science behind that\nthat's just\npersonal experience and clinical\nexperience that's what i mean\nokay so someone's asking\num\nhow to process what i can't pinpoint\nwhen i meditate i often feel sad but i\njust can't figure out what it is\nso that's the process right so like\nyou're not at the point of fixing\nsomething yet you're still at the\ndiagnostic phase so this is where i'd\nsay continue to meditate like sit down\nand journal\nright like you'll be surprised at what\ncomes up once you open the doors\nright like so open the doors to your\nmind and like see what comes out\nso like you can start by asking like\nwhat's making me sad\nright what am i sad about\nhow do i know if what comes out is right\nor wrong what comes out is not right or\nwrong\nright or wrong is a judgment\nwhat comes out is an observation do you\nall understand the difference\nright so whatever comes out comes out\nlike that's just an observation it's in\nyour mind whether it's correct or\nincorrect is like not important yet\nfirst it's just what what's there so if\nsomething is making me sad\nlet's say someone is asking how do i get\nout of the bad kisser mindset\nif you have this mindset like even if\nit's wrong it's completely irrelevant\nright at this point it just is\nso you can say it's wrong if i say like\ni'm lazy and i shouldn't do this how\ndoes that affect my life not one iota\nthe judgment of things is good and bad\nis not where the work is done\nokay you all get that\nlike\nthis is the biggest problem is we're so\nquick to judge and so so slow to\nunderstand\nbecause the mind loves judging\neasy to judge easy to criticize right so\none of the biggest problems nowadays\nlike we see this a lot on the internet\nis like it's very easy to criticize\nsomeone\nbut it's like very hard to like\nunderstand them\nbecause criticism is easy your mind\njumps to judgments oh this place sucks\nthis place has bad fries\nthis this country is\na crap hole\nyou know these people are idiots\nright like it's easy to like it's so\neasy to criticize\nso difficult to understand\nand there's a big dunning-kruger effect\nhere too where like\nthe more like you'll see this if you\nreally pay attention is is you know the\nless knowledgeable people are the more\nlikely they are to criticize like if you\ngo play a game of dota or lol or\nvalorant or whatever you go to low mmr\nand you're a good mmr player i guarantee\nyou people will tell you what you're\ndoing wrong\nright\nand get a lot of people have no idea\nwhat they're talking about that are\nquick to criticize\nand that's just the nature of the mind\nit's easy to judge\nso start by understanding what you want\nfirst is observations\nand once you observe once you like start\nto really like open yourself up a little\nbit and just observe\nthen you can start to understand and\nonce you start to understand then your\njudgment making capacity will be far far\nimproved and that's why in our in our\nmodel it's like emotional understanding\ncomes first identity understanding comes\nfirst behavioral change comes last\nright and this is the big problem is\nthat everyone is trying to shortcut to\nchange\neveryone's trying to say like okay how\ndo i fix this\nand it's like\nit's gonna be hard that's why just do it\ndoesn't work why doesn't just do it work\nit's because you can't jump straight to\nbehavior you have to go through the\nprerequisite psychological steps\nyou"
