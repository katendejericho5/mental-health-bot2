    "transcript": "accept the feedback of other people\nexcept the constructive criticism of\nother people grow as a human being and\ngrow towards what you want to be\ni feel like i'm too soft to be a real\nman\nin my day-to-day life i do consider\nmyself happy but there are some things i\nstruggle with\nthis is such a great intro right it's\nlike acknowledging that there's some\ngood stuff and some bad stuff fantastic\nall my life i was told i'm not a real\nman because of my personality traits\nmostly by my family\ngrowing up with two hyper masculine\nmilitary brothers didn't help that at\nall\nas a kid i liked dolls makeup as well as\nsoccer and cars growing up i wanted to\nbe a firefighter and fashion designer at\nthe same time\ntoys didn't have a gender to kid me\nneither did colors whatever was fun was\nwhat i did\nnow as an adult i still like disney\nbooks and cute things\ni love romance novels i journal i like\ncandles for relaxation and i dress up\nfor fun\nsad movies make me cry i prefer cuddling\nover sex and most of my friends are\nwomen\nin my friend group people call me the\ntherapist friend because i always try to\nlisten and help others when someone else\nis struggling i immediately recognize\nthat and try to comfort them but my own\nproblems can't deal with that\nlooks like you're masculine after all\nbro\ni've been called unmanly for that too no\nit's mistaken it's the other way\nall that femininity makes me feel\ninferior as hard as i try i can't be as\nthe tough man my brothers are and\nbelieve me i tried i tried so hard when\ni was younger crying was basically\nforbidden in my household not even my\ngrandma's funeral made me cry\nand that's how much i repressed my\nemotions while my brothers are literally\nfighting wars halfway across the world i\ncry because a disney movie made me sad\nthat's how pathetic i am\nand i know intellectually that i i know\nthat it's not true emotions and being in\ntouch with them is a good thing\ni'm aware that thinking being feminine\nmakes me pathetic is super sexist and\noutdated\ni don't know that it's outdated because\na lot of people feel that way\nbut i can't help it every day i feel\nlike the masculine world is pushing me\nunder and leaving me behind the\nexpectations put on men just aren't\nsomething i can follow and it feels like\ni'm failing my social role every day\nthis by the way is a common shared\nexperience of very manly men i will have\nyou know\nthe fact that i am very much bisexual\ndoes not help that's just another thing\nfeminizing me\nokay\nso\nthere's so much to talk about here\num\nand i'm gonna toss out a disclaimer\nbecause\nwhen it comes to issues of gender i not\njust gender identity but gender\nperceptions gender experiences i know\nthe community has sometimes had divisive\nresponses and at the same time like\nwe're going to charge right in\nnot knowing what on earth we're doing\nwe're going to try to address this\nperson's problem because that's what\nwe're here for even if we're incompetent\nat it\nand because the reason is simple right\nbecause this person's problems exist\nlike this happens all the time and it's\nnot just like a male issue so this is\nfrom the perspective of a bisexual man\nwho does not feel manly enough but i\nhave talked to and worked with women who\nsuffer from the same problem\nright they're like not feminine enough\nlike it was fine when they were kids but\nespecially in the workplace\nyou have all kinds of like masculine\ntraits which they get pooped on for\nprime primarily by other women by the\nway but also by men right so they run\ninto misogyny and other kinds of things\nso it is a very common unfortunate\nexperience that we have traditional\ngender roles\nand that if you don't fall into your\ntraditional gender role you tend to get\njudged for it right and this is where i\nknow that we say that like this kind of\nstuff like\nis outdated but it's not outdated if it\nwas outdated like this person wouldn't\nfeel this way y'all get that\nthis is very much in vogue\nlike gender norms asking people to\nadhere to gender norms\nlike we call it outdated\nwe say that we're past it\nbut\nwe're not actually past it right as a\nsociety we're not actually past it\nthat's why these people feel this way\ni know it's kind of bizarre but like\nthat's actually the truth\nyou know and this is not i'm not trying\nto so like a couple of disclaimers so\nthe first is like i need to be able to\nmake a statement about one gender\nindependent of another gender not all\nthings that involve one gender have to\nbe done in reflection of another gender\nright so we have to be able to like\ncomment that\nfor example like let's just use one\nexample which i'm maybe it will alienate\npeople but that's why i'm picking it so\nif we talk about sexual assault right so\nlike sexual assault\nso men under report their sexual assault\nand also get treated differently and\ndon't get as much\nthey don't get very much support for\nreporting sexual assault now we can talk\nabout that and even i was about to i was\nthey don't get as much support as women\nbut that's i don't even know if that's a\nfair statement but the key thing is if\nwe're talking about sexual assault for\nmen\na lot of people may say but sexual\nassault is a problem for women as well\nwhich i completely agree with right so\nyou can also make the argument that\nwomen under i mean not argument this is\nscientifically true women under report\nsexual assault there are all kinds of\nnegative consequences for women who\nsuffer from sexual assault my point is\nthat like we have to be able to talk\nabout each gender and the problems that\nthey face without that it reflecting or\nbeing compared to the other gender like\nthis isn't a competition of which gender\nis the most screwed maybe it is in other\nplaces\nbut what we're here to do is help\nindividuals and if gender is a part of\nthe problem that you have then so be it\nright then we're going to try to support\nyou in that\nso we always want to try to do in this\ncommunity and i hope you all have seen\nthis is like anytime someone comes on to\ninterview we're not trying we're just\ntrying to help a human being that's what\nthis entire community is about just\ntrying to help a human being and however\ntheir problems manifest is like what\nwe're gonna deal with\nokay\nso big disclaimer second thing here we\ngo\nso\nthe real challenging thing here is that\nyou know when i first read this i\nstarted thinking a lot about\ndating\nright and being acceptable\nin a dating environment\nbut the more that i i don't know quite\nwhy i thought about this because this\nperson doesn't\nthis person doesn't talk at all about\nfinding a partner right so i don't know\nexactly why my mind went there but i\nthink it's kind of like an interesting\npoint which we'll talk about in a second\nbut\ni think at the end of the day\nyou know if you were unhappy with your\ngender or not your gender um\nbecause this person has a firm gender\nidentity right so they identify as a man\nthey're just not a very masculine man\nso like what do you do if you're not a\nmasculine man so the first thing is just\nfrom a dating standpoint okay\nit's like i don't think this person\nrealizes and this this is anecdotal okay\nnot scientific but like i'm so curious\nif we can just pull like women who are\nwatching this like what percentage of\nyou would be willing to date this person\nlike would you date this person yes or\nno i guess it doesn't have to be women\nbecause the person's bisexual\nso\nwhat percentage of you would be willing\nto date this person right can we\nactually grab a poll and take a look at\nthat because i think that's interesting\nso a big part of this is that when you\ngrow up\nwith a family that is unaccepting of who\nyou are\nthen\nyou know you have these two hyper\nmasculine brothers you like things that\nare traditionally like\nnot liked by men and so you come across\nas feeling inferior\nand then what happens is you project\nthat feeling of inferiority like on to\nother people and since you don't feel\nlike a man you're going to feel like\nother people\nare not going to like you because you're\na man you're not a man or you're not\nmanly enough\nnow that makes perfect sense actually\nbecause that's the way you got treated\nright so when you liked dolls and makeup\nas a kid\nyour family taught you that that is\nunacceptable that people you will be\nnegatively judged for liking these\nthings whereas you have these two hyper\nmasculine military brothers\nwhich by the way from an evolutionary\nthis is not actually true but i'm just\ngonna meme here for a second you know so\nwhat happened during the vietnam war is\nall the manly military men went to\nvietnam and then a lot of them died in\nwartime and all the hippy peace loving\nmen stayed here and they had a lot of\nsex and procreated with a lot of people\nand so genetically like i don't even\nknow that that masculine military is the\nright\nso 70 of people are saying yes they\nwould date this person\nright so anyway\nit's interesting so 70 of people like\nliterally it's exactly 70 people would\nsay yeah i'm down to date this person\nso i think it's interesting because when\nour family\nwhen we grow up a particular way and\nwe're judged by our family for a\nparticular trait or like judged by the\noriginal people that we kind of grow up\nwith not as just family but it can be\nclose friends\nwe tend to feel like ashamed of\nourselves that we shouldn't you know be\nthis thing\nwhereas like you know i this also is\nmore personal experience but\nyou know i have a number of female\nfriends less so now but like maybe 10\nyears ago is i'm thinking about a couple\nin particular\nwho\nwould love to date someone like this\nokay\nand the reason they would love to date\nsomeone like this is is\nthere was a time where some several of\nmy friends in a very like you know token\nkind of very\ndehumanizing way wanted a gay best\nfriend like my female friends and they\nlike loved the idea of like a gay best\nfriend in the way that it was portrayed\nin all the movies\nand so then there are even one or two of\nmy friends who would try to like date\ngabe like they would start hanging out\nwith gay people and they would fall in\nlove with them and they would try to\nconvert them like i actually know people\nthat did this\nokay so i'm not saying that that's good\nor anything it's just personal\nexperience and so the interesting thing\nhere is that you have a lot of those\ncharacteristics\nand at the same time like you're\nbisexual so it's totally fine so like\nyou're in in a lot of ways you were like\nthe dream partner from a group of women\nthat i was friends with like a decade\nago right\nand and so it's\nit's it's like like the my point is that\nany time you feel bad about yourself you\nare likely to project that\nonto other people\nright like you're gonna be afraid that\nyou're gonna be judged for being the\nperson that you are\nbut the truth of the matter is that like\nit's the other way around right the\ntruth of the matter is that you are who\nyou are and depending on who you\nseek out you will find people who will\naccept you for who you are\nso your masculinity doesn't necessarily\nlike you may do some things that are\ntraditionally masculine some things that\nare not traditionally masculine and if\nyou want to do more masculine things\nthen by all means go and do more\nmasculine things you know learn how to\nchange a tire or whatever it is that\nmasculine people do go learn how to chop\nfirewood and and grill\nyou know like if that's what you want to\ndo like go do that if you genuinely\nenjoy doing those things then i'd say go\ndo those things\nbut if you don't enjoy doing those\nthings\nthen like that's okay right i think\nthankfully there are people out there\nwho will probably accept you for the\nthings that you enjoy doing\nso a lot of people you know find someone\nfind people who like romance novels and\nlike who cares if they're men or women\nlike who cares\nright\nif you like dressing up for fun like\nhang out with other people who dress up\nfor fun like who cares\nso this is where when we ask that\nquestion who cares in a rhetorical sense\ni think like who cares is you\nright so you are taught to care your\nfamily cares you care right so it's not\nlike no one cares clearly someone cares\nand so i think if you are someone who's\nlike very very concerned\nabout you know the way that you view\nyour masculinity like i think that's\nokay too\nso i know it sounds kind of weird but i\nwould start by sort of accepting your\nlack of acceptance towards yourself\nright so start by acknowledging\nthat like you know\nyou're actually quite masculine when it\ncomes to suppressing your emotions\nyou know not managing your own problems\nand suppressing the things that bother\nyou like that's very masculine so good\njob\nso i think this is the kind of thing\nwhere you know even if you just feel\nlike you're not very masculine like it's\nokay to not be happy with yourself\nbut i would also go\ntowards understanding like where does\nthis lack of acceptance coming from\nbecause this is self-judgment just like\nany other right like what bothers you\nabout the way that you are\nwhat makes it hard for you to accept\nyourself for the way that you are\nbecause i think sometimes\nas this person kind of says like they're\nactually pretty happy in their day life\nit sounds like they read romance novels\nand get dressed up and have a good time\nso what is it that you're really looking\nfor are you looking for your family's\nacceptance\nand since they don't accept you that\nyou're not going to accept yourself\nand so that can be really challenging\nlike that's where maybe some morning\nneeds to happen right like maybe like\nyou need to really think through that\nabsolutely something you can also talk\nto a therapist about\num i would i would go therapist more so\nthan coach in this situation\nbut you know i think it's okay to not be\nmanly and like if you're not happy with\nnot being manly then that's okay too\nso if you're not happy with your\nunmanliness then by all means change it\nbut if you if you're okay with it but\nyou're concerned about other people\njudging you for it which is probably the\ncase\nit's okay for also for you to be\nconcerned about other people's judgment\nright because that's the way the world\nis like everyone's gonna judge you like\nthat's what people do\nand so the hard thing here is that you\nknow becoming comfortable in your own\nskin\nis like\nthe process of like letting go of other\npeople's judgment but that's not easy\nright it's actually quite hard and it's\nlike against the grain\nthe reason that we ca i mean the fact\nthat people care more about judgment\nthan they do about their internal sense\nof self-worth is the whole reason that\nlike social media is successful\nright if we really cared about ourselves\nmore than we care about what other\npeople think about us\nthen no one would be on social media\nbut the reason it's so successful is\nbecause as human beings we care more\nabout what other people think about us\nthan what we think about ourselves\nbecause social media is all about\nadvertisement instead of truth\nright the person who truly cares about\nthemselves like doesn't care about\nadvertising because they're comfortable\nin who they are\nso i think there's a lot of stuff about\nyou that is far from\noutdated\nin fact i think it's a very common\nexperience\nright you're concerned about how you're\nbeing perceived how you're being judged\ni don't know what that means for you in\nterms of finding a romantic partner\ni don't know if that's something you get\nconcerned about i don't know if you feel\nlike you're not manly enough next to\nyour hyper-masculine brothers\nbut then like the other big question\nthat you have to ask yourself is\nwhy is being manly a good thing\nwhy do you place value on being manly\nover not being manly like what\nlike these are the kinds of questions\nyou really have to ask yourself right if\nyou want to understand what\nintrospection is it's like\ngoing through the process of questioning\nyour assumptions like where do you get\nthe idea to value\nmanliness over non-manliness because\nwhat i'm hearing is like\ni mean you have plenty of manly things\nthat you like right so you like cars and\nsoccer you just like non-manly things\ntoo which is okay\nright\nthat's totally fine\nbut it can be it can be hard because\nthere's a lot of self-judgment\na lot of self-judgment\nand that's what we're really seeing here\num\nbut yeah i mean i i think\nyou know the expectations put on men\njust aren't something i can follow and\nit feels like i'm failing in my social\nrole every day manly men feel this too\nso like let's just talk about this for a\nsecond\nso if we look at like social\nexpectations\nright so i think one of the biggest\nproblem that men are running through\nright now is that like\nsocial expectations have changed\nsomewhat but have not changed like fully\nso i'll give you guys a simple example\nso\nyou know\nwomen in the workplace is now like\ncompletely normal which is a good thing\nright so you have like women like ceo of\nhealthy gamers a woman right so\ni'm employed by my wife right so there's\nlike there's like all kinds of changes\nhappening in in the world and i think\nthose are good the reason i'm employed\nby my wife instead of the other way\naround is because she's better at the\njob than i am like she's a better boss\nthan i am i'm better at taking orders\nand she's better at giving them\neasy\nright so that's true that's the way\nthings are\nand at the same time\ni think sometimes\nmen are still adversely judged\nin a way that does not\nit isn't fully compensated for the rise\nof women in the workplace i have nothing\nabout against the rise of women in the\nworkplace i think the challenge that men\nface is the consequences of that\nso for example a lot of women will still\nhave the idea that men should earn more\nthan they do than than the women do\nright so like that's was\nof acceptable\nassumption when there wasn't some degree\nof equality in the workplace right\nso like that's where things are\nchallenging right so i don't know if\nyou're a man and you kind of say that\nyou don't want to have a job ever and\nyou want to be a homemaker i don't know\nhow much society would accept you i\nwould suspect that they wouldn't\naccept you much this also comes from\nanecdotal experience so i'm not saying\nthat this is right or wrong this is just\nmy personal experience of like\nlistening to conversations and stuff\nand generally speaking when i have\nfemale friends or family members\nlike\nwhen i have male friends or family\nmembers and they date someone who does\nnot is not professionally successful\nthat seems to be like societally\naccepted at least culturally or within\nmy social circle i'm not saying about\nsociety as a whole i can't comment on\nthat\nbut i've not seen the opposite is true\nwhere like you know if you're a dude and\nyou just tell people like in fact quite\nthe contrary what i'll hear from a lot\nof people\nuh like women is like women that i\npersonally know is that if a dude does\nnot have a a promising professional\ncareer that\ntheir female friend can do better than\nthat right so there's an implicit value\njudgment based on that like placed on on\nthat difference\nso i i think that's unfortunate like i\nalso have met plenty of people who are\ncomfortable with the man being the house\nhusband or whatever right and i think\nthat would be fun and fair\ni think\nbut it's it's a challenge that people\nface now this does not mean that women\ndon't face challenges as well right so\nif you're a woman in the dating world\ndick pics right i don't think that men\nhave anything\nin the realm of like whatever whatever\ncategory dick pics are in\nwomen clearly have it worse there\nright\nand and so so maybe not maybe i'm just\nalienating everybody my point once again\nis that we don't have to like look at\nthe the struggles of one particular\ngender and at the same time like make\ncomparisons to the other gender i'm not\nsaying men have it easier than women on\na whole on the whole or vice versa right\ni think this is where like each gender\nas gender norms are changing within our\nsociety each gender is having to go\nthrough this process of like identity\nreformation right as we are mourning and\ngrieving\nthe gender traditions of the past and\nmodernizing like there are going to be\nall kinds of changes\nand as a society as we start to go\nthrough some of these changes it leaves\npeople like this really stuck\nright because like how manly do i need\nto be\nwell that's a good question like i don't\nknow because things seem to be changing\non the one hand they think that these\nideas are super sexist and outdated\nwhereas i'd say that like actually the\nfact you know we all claim to be like a\nequal society but misogyny is at an\nall-time high\nright like sexism towards men is like\nalso appears to be at an all-time high\nmaybe it's not maybe i guess i myself\nmaybe not in an all-time high certainly\nfeels that way\nin terms of just an observer of like\nwomen's experiences right now\nand so i think this is the kind of thing\nwhere you just got to think a little bit\nabout you know who do you want to be and\nif who you want to be does not live up\nto your expectations\nthen where do you get your expectations\ndo you really want to hold on to your\nexpectations\nor these fair expectations\nand as we start to go through this\nprocess of like looking at the origins\nof your self-judgment that's ultimately\nhow you'll be free because my\nrecommendation to this person would be\nit sounds like you're an awesome person\nwho is just\nhas copy pasted the the judgment of\ngender identity from your family into\nyour own mind\nand as you you copy posted it you\nactually don't have a problem with it\nbut you've just got this copy pasta\njudgment like\nprogramming in your head\nand based on that that programming like\nyou tend to fall short but if you\nactually like look at your life it seems\nlike you consider yourself pretty happy\nand if you want to be more manly then be\nmore manly but if you don't want to be\nmore manly and you don't enjoy being\nmanly then don't be manly right and this\ngets to the the really modern\ninterpretation of things is like where\ndid we get the idea that like romance\nnovels are manly things i mean not manly\nthings or feminine things that candles\nand relaxation is like only for women\nlike what you know\ndressing up for fun is like where does\nthat idea come from\nright so that's like this is where the\nwhole point of recontextualizing our\ngender realms which i'm a huge fan of is\nthat like you should be what you want\nwhether you're man or a woman\nwhatever and the unfortunate thing\nwhether you're a man or woman is that\nsociety is not going to be entirely\nhappy with you being what you want\nright society is not going to be happy\nwith\nmen who like romance novels and candles\nand society is not going to be happening\nwith women who are ceos\nand that's okay they can go [ __ ]\nthemselves\nright we're going to be happy and we're\ngoing to live our life\nand we're going to stop catering to the\njudgments of other people\nlike you can cater them to a certain\ndegree if you want to like go for it i'm\nnot saying be a mean person\nbut i'm saying at the end of the day\nit's like your life and you've got to\nlive it the way that you want to\nand if other people don't want to accept\nthat like i'm not saying that you\nshouldn't you know sometimes people use\nthis kind of doctrine is like if people\ndon't accept me the way i am they can go\nf themselves so i'm going to be an\n[ __ ] all the time that's not what i'm\nsaying i'm talking about these\nbroad-scale gender norms\nright you should listen to other\npeople's feedback by all means\nlike i'm not saying like go do whatever\nyou want to whenever you want to to\nwhomever you want to that's half the\nproblem with sexism in the world right\nnow is that kind of crap goes on\nand at the same time like there's a\nthere's a difference between sort of\nlike\nsocietally\nadhering to some kind of weird projected\na amorphous abstract ideal of manliness\nand specific feedback from a person\nright do you guys get the difference\nthere like i'm saying when you want to\nlive your life you want to live it like\nlive to your own standards and if\nsomeone gives you specific feedback\nabout something maybe you should take\nthat seriously but like don't try to\nlive your life based on some abstract\nidea of what you think it should be like\nthat's the failing strategy\naccept the feedback of other people\nexcept the constructive criticism of\nother people grow as a human being and\ngrow towards what you want to be\nthat's what i'd say\nhow many people have i alienated\nhave i alienated everyone now\nshould we have just stayed away from\nthat one\ni don't know man i feel like so this is\na challenge with gender dynamics it's so\neasy to alienate people but like this is\nthe challenge i face is like\nsure it's easy to alienate people but\nit's a huge problem for like everyone\nout there\nso like what are we gonna do about it\nlike we can't just not talk about it and\nrisk not we're like sure we're going to\npiss people off and then you guys are\ngoing to give us criticism and then\nwe're going to integrate it and then\nwe're going to try to do better\nright and we're going to continue\nscrewing up because like i hate to break\nthe steel but i'm not an expert in\ngender dynamics i did not go to an\nindian ashram for seven years and study\ngender dynamics\nwhat i discovered at the bottom of the\nashram in in after seven years is that\nall gender is false\nthe true self has no gender\nright and the rest of it is all crap we\nconstruct\nlike\nyou're a human like we can all agree\nwhat's a good human and what's a bad\nhuman the moment you add the gender\nconstruct to it suddenly the answer\nstarts changing\nthat doesn't make any sense like you can\nbe a good person or bad person doesn't\nmatter what your gender is\nand once we start bucketing people based\non these constructs it's like oh this\nperson is a woman therefore i shall send\nher a picture of my penis that's sexist\nnot because it's a woman but because\nyou're treating women differently for\nmen\nright like\nlike do what is the good thing he said i\nmean don't actually do this but either\nsend dick pics to everyone\nor don't send them to anyone\nright\nand you don't send dick pics to your mom\nor your friends\ntherefore you know it's bad right if you\ndon't do it to your mom you shouldn't do\nit\ni'm just gonna stop\noh god what have i cut myself into\nall right\nthis is enough\nlike you guys get that i have a real\npoint here\nright\nbut like it's really like you know you\nknow what's good\nand just because someone has a gender\ndoesn't mean that you should change your\nbehavior towards them just because of\nthe gender that's the key thing you know\nwhat's good you know what's bad\nso you should behave that way towards\neveryone\ntheir genitals do not affect the way\nthat you interact with them\nright so like\nif you're playing a video game and you\nhave someone on your team\nwho is a woman like you don't change the\nway you play the ages you're all we're\nall [ __ ] here to play dota so just\nplay dota\nright\nif they feed in mid then flame them like\nyou would anyone else but don't flame\nthem because they're a woman flame them\nbecause they suck at mid\nright\ndon't friend them afterward\ndon't try to hit them up for a\nconversation\nlike there's\nyou don't friend mids who feed\nyou put them on your block list which is\nexactly what you should do\nright that's that's meaning of equality\nis like treating all humans the same\nso we should do that\nright and even even more good is to not\nflame them in\nthat's the right move is like be like\nhey man like i know it sucks\nwe'll we'll win stay positive\nyou"
