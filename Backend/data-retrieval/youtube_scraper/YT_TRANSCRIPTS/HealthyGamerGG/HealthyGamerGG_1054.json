    "transcript": "hey y'all i'd love to talk a little bit\nabout ethics today there have been\nseveral concerns in the community a lot\nof questions about whether what we do at\nhealthy gamer on stream is therapy\nwhether what we sort of do at healthy\ngamer as a whole is ethical and i'd love\nto sort of talk you all through the\nethics of what we do\nthe first thing that i kind of want to\nacknowledge is that most people don't\nreally get an opportunity even in higher\neducation to really understand or learn\nabout medical ethics\nmedical ethics aren't really a matter of\nphilosophy or even opinion so just\nbecause i believe what we do is ethical\ndoesn't actually make it ethical if\nsomeone else believes what we do is\nunethical that doesn't actually make it\nunethical the truth is is that medical\nethics are actually very very clearly\ndefined there's there are standards of\npractice that are actually codified in\nstate federal and international laws\nand licensing boards are very specific\nabout what is ethical and what is not\nethical so ethics aren't really a matter\nof opinion so what are some of the\ncentral principles of medical ethics the\nfirst principle is beneficence so this\nis essentially to try to maximize the\ngood that we do the second principle of\nmedical ethics is non-malfeasance so\nthis is to try to minimize the harm that\nwe do the third principle of ethics is\nautonomy so this is sort of when doctors\nwe provide information to people but it\nis ultimately their choice whether they\nengage in something or not engage in\nsomething as a patient you have the\nright to refuse a treatment right so\ndoctors can't make decisions for you and\nthe fourth major principle of medical\nethics is justice and that's where we\ntry to deliver medical services in a\nfair way\nso if you kind of think about these\nprinciples of medical ethics it kind of\nlike it sort of boils down to a lot of\nwhat you see in clinical practice so if\ni'm trying to prescribe a medication for\nexample the medication is going to have\nsome benefits and it's going to have\nsome side effects so how do i decide\nwhether it's appropriate to prescribe a\nmedication or not so what i do is i'll\nweigh beneficence against\nnon-malfeasance does the clinical\nbenefit from the medication outweigh the\nside effects or the harm that it does if\nthe answer is yes then it's sort of a\ngood treatment to recommend\ni also as a doctor allow people to make\ntheir own decisions right so we're\nseeing a lot of this right now in the\nworld with people refusing vaccination\nwhere people are allowed to make their\nown decisions about coven 19 treatment\nreceiving it not receiving it and that's\na central principle of medical ethics\nthe last principle of justice is\nessentially that we as doctors don't\ndiscriminate we try to treat everyone\nthe same and it sort of doesn't matter\nthat you've smoked for 50 years when you\nget lung cancer we're going to treat you\nthe same as if you've never smoked a\nsingle cigarette\nso these are some of the core principles\nof medical ethics\nand what i want to dive into next which\nis a really really big question in our\ncommunity is what we do therapy on\nstream so a lot of people will sort of\nlook at what we do on stream and sort of\nassume that this is the practice of\ntherapy after all i'm a therapist and\ni'm talking to someone about their\nemotions so is that actually therapy and\ni'd like to start by sort of sharing a\nlittle bit of a narrative so when i\nstarted healthy gamer the reason that i\nstarted healthy gamer is i was working\nwith a lot of people who were sort of of\nthe digital generation and the more\ngamers that i worked with the more young\npeople i worked with i noticed i was\nhaving the same conversation over and\nover\nin fact what i noticed was that what was\nreally missing is not clinical treatment\nthese were not people who needed\nprescriptions or even psychotherapy what\nthey needed first and foremost was\neducation i found myself having the same\nconversation over and over again\nteaching the same things over and over\nagain so i started to wonder could i\nactually help 10 people or a hundred\npeople by having a single conversation\nonline and so as i started to\ninvestigate that question even before i\nstarted streaming at all the first thing\nthat i looked into is whether it was\npossible as a psychiatrist to have\npublic conversations with people about\ntheir mind and mental health\nthe answer that i discovered was yes you\ncan provided you do it in a very\nspecific way\nso people may think that what i do on on\nstream is therapy but the truth is it is\nactually very clearly not therapy and\nwhat do i mean by that let's explore\nthat for a second\nthe first thing to understand is that\nthe practice of psychotherapy is very\ntightly regulated so i can't just i mean\ni can because i'm a psychiatrist but you\nknow the average person can't just open\nup an office and say i'm doing\npsychotherapy in the same way that\nsomeone can't hang up you know open an\noffice and say i'm doing surgery so\nthere are some things a psychotherapy is\na very restricted practice and so as a\nresult it's very clearly defined so what\nconstitutes psychotherapy and what\ndoesn't constitute psychotherapy\nthe other thing to understand is that\ntherapists are regulated in all manner\nof ways so for example if you go see a\ntherapist they are not allowed to\ndivulge anything about you including\nyour name or what's going on with you\nwith anyone else so when you see a\ntherapist you are entitled to\ndoctor-patient confidentiality\nso we sort of what i discovered as i was\nlooking into whether it's possible for\nme to have conversations online\nis that\nwhat's actually regulated\nis not necessarily the practice of\ntherapy i mean it is but that's actually\nregulated under a broader set of ethical\nand legal guidelines which is the\nclinical practice of medicine so why is\nyour therapist entitled why are you\nentitled to doctor-patient\nconfidentiality with your therapist it's\nbecause they're practicing clinical\nmedicine why do we regulate who is\nallowed to do therapy and who is not\nallowed to do therapy it's because we\nregulate the practice of clinical\nmedicine we regulate who can do therapy\nwe regulate who can pull teeth we\nregulate who can do surgery we regulate\nwho can prescribe medication\nso all of these regulations are shared\nright so you have doctor patient\nconfidentiality with dentists with\ntherapists with psychiatrists with\nsurgeons with endocrinologists or\nobstetricians or gynecologists\nso the the\nethical guidelines and the regulations\nof what therapy is and what constitutes\ntherapy falls under the broader practice\nof clinical medicine\nand this is another really important\npoint because my professional training\nis as an md so the laws and ethics that\ni'm held to as a medical doctor sort of\ninvolve the practice of clinical\nmedicine so what actually constitutes\nthe practice of medicine so the american\npsychiatric association defines\npsychiatry as the branch of medicine\nthat's focused on the diagnosis\ntreatment and prevention of mental and\nemotion mental emotional and behavioral\ndisorders\nso clinical medicine is essentially it's\nit's very specific but clinical medicine\nis the practice of medicine and the\npractice of medicine is actually very\nclearly defined there's a clear line\nbetween what is medicine and what is not\nmedicine so for example prescribing\nmedications or doing surgery fall under\nthe practice of medicine psychotherapy\nfalls under the practice of medicine\nand while the practices of medicine may\nvary a little bit from state to state\neach state has its own guidelines each\ncountry has its own guidelines there are\nthree\nincredibly common and conserved things\nno matter where you look at the practice\nof medicine\nthose three things are first of all the\nformation of a doctor-patient\nrelationship the second is diagnosis and\nthe third is treatment so wherever you\ngo\nmedicine constitutes these three things\nso let's start with the first one the\ncommencement of a doctor-patient\nrelationship\nso i know this sounds kind of weird and\nit may sound kind of simple but this is\nactually very very clearly defined so\nthe ama actually clearly defines what\nwhat constitutes entering into a\ndoctor-patient relationship and the key\nthing here is that there's a voluntary\nagreement by both parties that we are\nentering into a doctor-patient\nrelationship\nthis may sound a little bit weird like\nbut just think about it kind of\nlogically right so you can't walk up to\nme or any other doctor and say hey\nyou're my doctor now similarly i as a\ndoctor cannot walk up to a random person\non the street and say hey i'm your\ndoctor now the patient has to agree to\nbe a patient and the doctor has to agree\nto be their doctor the american medical\nassociation also clearly defines the\nexceptions to this rule so one exception\nfor example is emergency care or the\ncase of a surrogate so if someone is in\na car accident and they have a skull\nfracture or not conscious they do not\nhave to agree to be a patient a doctor\ncan actually start administering medical\ncare in the case of an emergency\nsurrogates are other examples so if you\nhave something like a six month old\nchild the child can't enter into a\ndoctor-patient relationship if you have\nsomeone who's 85 years old and has\ndementia they may not be able to enter\ninto a doctor-patient relationship so a\nsurrogate can enter into the\nrelationship for you\nthe other major success\nexception to entry into a doctor-patient\nrelationship is a limited um\ndoctor-patient relationship in the case\nof like a consultation or temporary\nmedical care so i'll give you all just a\nsimple example of this so let's say i go\non vacation so i have my patients that\ni'm responsible for i have a doctor\nwho's covering for me but that doctor is\nonly responsible for those patients\nwhile i'm on vacation and once i come\nback that person's limited relationship\nwith patients ends so those all of my\npatients can't sort of automatically\nswitch over to the new doctor without\nthat doctor's consent there are other\ncases where there are limited\ndoctor-patient relationships those tend\nto be informal consultations so\nsometimes for example if you've got\ncancer you may seek a second opinion\nfrom a different doctor and you still\nhave your primary doctor but you're\nallowed to engage in a limited\ndoctor-patient relationship with a\nseparate doctor is part of a\nconsultation the key thing here is that\na doctor-patient relationship is very\nclearly defined it's a voluntary\ncommitment by both parties\nthe other key thing is that the\nexceptions to the doctor-patient\nrelationship are also clearly defined\nthere are two major exceptions which we\njust talked about and those are the only\nones\ntalking to a psychiatrist online is not\nan exception to the voluntary entry of a\ndoctor-patient relationship\nthe other things in addition to the\nvoluntary consensual entry into a\ndoctor-patient relationship are\ndiagnosis and treatment these are the\nother two pillars of the practice of\nmedicine so what constitutes diagnosis\nand what constitutes treatment\nthis is where standard of care enters\nthe picture so we all recognize that you\nknow diagnosis and treatment are not the\nsame for any given illness so the\ndiagnosis and treatment of cancer may be\ndifferent from diagnosis and treatment\nof let's say\na physical thera like a muscle strain\nwhich may be different from let's say\ndiagnosing depression so there are\nindividual standards of care depending\non what kind of medicine you're\npracticing and the reason that we use\nstandard of care is to sort of regulate\nand help all doctors and patients\nunderstand what is the responsibility of\na doctor in order to be saying i am\npracticing medicine what are the things\nthat i'm required to do when a patient\ncomes to a doctor and wants to receive\nmedical care what is the standard of\ncare that they should provide so\nunderstanding this is also really useful\nif we kind of like use an analogy so\nlet's say i go and order a pizza what\nconstitutes a pizza is it just someone\nsaying hey this is a pizza no so we\nthink of a pizza as like a couple of\ncore things right so there's some kind\nof like bread or pizza\ndough right there's some kind of sauce\nand there's some kind of cheese so the\nway that we define pizza is based on\nthese three requirements right it's got\nto have bread it's got to have sauce\nit's got to have cheese now i recognize\nthat there may be some different\ndefinitions of pizza i'm just sort of\nusing that as an analogy and if we look\nat the practice of clinical medicine\nacross state lines across different\ncountries\nit sort of constitutes three things the\nentry of a doctor-patient relationship\ndiagnosis and treatment so then the\nquestion becomes what constitutes\ndiagnosis what's the standard of care of\ndiagnosis\nif i want to diagnose someone does that\njust mean like going up to a mental\nhealth professional and they just say\ni think you have depression therefore\nyou have depression actually not at all\nso there are very very strict standards\nof diagnosis so i'll give you guys sort\nof a quick overview of what i do in my\nclinical practice and basically what\nother therapists should be doing as well\nbecause it's the standard of care so the\ndiagnostic process\ninvolves a lot of different stuff so it\ninvolves taking a history of present\nillness which includes like a symptom\nassessment so what are the things that\nyou're experiencing it includes things\nlike duration frequency severity of\nsymptoms so how long have you been\nexperiencing this\nyou know how often does it happen how\nbad is it what what are the character of\nthe symptoms you experience in addition\nto the hpi we also assess medical\nhistory so do you have any other medical\nconditions have you had any other\npsychiatric conditions have you ever\nbeen hospitalized have you ever had\nsurgery before so there are lots of\ndifferent things that you collect for\nthe medical history\nthe next thing that we sort of collect\nis we'll collect things like substance\nuse history so do you use substances\nwe'll ask questions about your social\nhistory so where do you live what do you\ndo\nare you sexually active what are your\nrelationships like is there any chance\nyou have an sti and yes i do ask each\nand every one of my patients whether\nthey're 13 years old or 85 years old\nabout their sexual history because it's\nstandard of care for physicians\nother things include family history so\nhas anyone in your family ever been\nhospitalized does anyone in your family\nhave medical conditions and you all may\nsort of recognize this kind of stuff\nbecause if you go to a doctor's office\nthey're going to give you a bunch of\nforms that you fill out and we don't ask\nany of those questions on stream right\nso people may volunteer some information\nkind of from a narrative perspective\nabout what their upbringing was like but\nwe do not do diagnostic assessments on\nstream\nother parts of the diagnostic assessment\ninclude laboratory testing and imaging\nsometimes i'll order mris of the brain\nsometimes i'll order lab tests so the\nprocess of diagnosis is actually very\nvery specific it's not something that\nit's not just like you ask a couple of\nquestions and then you sort of\nsuddenly have a diagnosis\nthe other thing to consider about the\ndiagnostic process which is standard of\ncare is also a differential diagnosis so\nit is actually not enough for me to ask\nall of those questions as a doctor the\npractice of medicine constitutes\ndeveloping a differential diagnosis so\nif someone comes in with symptoms of\ndepression i also have to assess them\nfor bipolar disorder i also have to\nassess them for schizoaffective disorder\ni also have to assess them for a\nsubstance-induced mood disorder which in\nthe practice of medicine we absolutely\ndo so what i'm going to do for just to\nshow y'all is take a quick look at the\ndiagnostic criteria for major depressive\ndisorder so as we can see\nthe interview should establish the\npresence of depressive symptoms\ndepressed mood most of the day loss of\ninterest or pleasure in most or all\nactivities insomnia hypersomnia\nsignificant weight loss or weight gain\npsychomotor retardation or agitation\nfatigue or low energy decreased ability\nto concentrate think or make decisions\nthoughts of worthlessness or excessive\nor inappropriate guilt recurrent\nthoughts of death or suicidal ideation\nor a suicide attempt\ndepressed mood that occurs most of the\nday more days than not and is persistent\nand lasts for at least two weeks\nwe also have to go on so that it just\nkeeps going right so we have to\ndetermine the chronology of the current\ndepressive symptoms any prior history of\ndepressive episodes determine the impact\nof the depressive episode elicit\nalleviating and aggravating factors and\naddress comorbidities\ninclude questions about a past history\nof mania or hypomania so this is this is\nactually the standard that we're talking\nabout and like i don't know how else to\nsay this but we don't do that on stream\nbecause that's what constitutes the\npractice of medicine remember once again\nif we're doing therapy on stream then we\nhave to adhere to the standards of\ntherapy how do we define therapy it's\npart of the practice of medicine what is\nthe practice of medicine these are the\nstandards of care in terms of diagnosing\nsomeone with major depressive disorder\nand the simple fact is that we don't do\nany of that right i don't do thorough\nsymptomatic assessments i don't assess\nfrequency severity duration\nsome of these things may come up in the\ncourse of stream but that is not\nactually constituting a diagnosis\nthe next thing that i want to point out\nis for people who think okay we are do i\ndiagnose things on stream i don't and so\nlet me actually show you so someone\ntalking about their depression does not\nactually constitute diagnosis here are\nwhat actual diagnoses are so\nthis is from the icd-11 so this is the\ninternational classification of disease\nso this is an international consensus\nabout what constitutes diagnosis so when\ni'm seeing a patient in my office i will\nactually diagnose them with one of these\nthings recurrent depressive disorder\ncurrent episode mild or current episode\nmoderate without psychotic symptoms with\npsychotic symptoms severe with psychotic\nsymptoms impartial remission in fuller\nremission these are actual diagnoses we\ndo not tell people on stream that they\nhave these we do not ask diagnostic\nquestions to the extent of what is\nnecessary for major depressive disorder\nso depression is not a diagnosis anxiety\nis not a diagnosis anxiety is an emotion\nthe actual diagnoses are things like\ngeneralized anxiety disorder socializing\nanxiety disorder anxiety disorder\ninduced by a substance unspecified\nanxiety disorder those are actually\ndiagnoses and we do not\nassign those labels to anyone on stream\nwhat about treatment\nso treatment is also something where it\ninvolves a standard of care so the\nstandard of care for psychotherapy\nbecause a lot of people are wondering\nwhether i do something what i do on\nstream is psychotherapy or not let's\ntalk about what constitutes the standard\nof care of psychotherapy so when a\ntherapist is working with a patient what\ndo we expect from them what can patients\nexpect and what are patients\nsorry what a therapist's responsible for\ndelivering so a good example of the\nfoundation of a psychotherapeutic\ntreatment is something called a\ntreatment plan so this is a treatment\nplan that i just kind of wrote up it's a\nfake treatment plan these are the kinds\nof treatment plans that i develop for my\npatients so you know they'll have the\nname date of birth things like that but\nthen it'll have the first diagnosis\nand so this is actually what i do in\nclinical practice treatment plans\ninclude things like psychopharmacology\nare they taking medicine are we doing\nsome kind of evidence-based\npsychotherapy\nwhat are the goals of the psychotherapy\nwhat other kinds of things are we doing\nfor health and wellness so for example\nsometimes as part of treatment plans\ni'll include mindfulness practice\nwhat's the second diagnosis what's the\nstate of the second diagnosis what are\nwe doing for it okay this person had an\nalcohol problem but i'm currently not\nprescribing anything by the way they've\nbenefited from naltrexone in the past\npsychotherapy can also there can also be\npsychotherapy for the second\ndiagnosis and the part of the treatment\nplan is to go to alcoholics anonymous\nthe third thing the third diagnosis is\ngoing to be ptsd for this person so\nthere's medications i'm prescribing but\nthey're also seeing a different\ntherapist for doing a different\nevidence-based treatment modality\nthere's also different kinds of peer\nsupport and there's a medical diagnosis\nthrown in so this is an example of what\nan actual treatment plan is like when\nyou perform therapy with a patient this\nis what therapy actually looks like\ni'll show you just another sort of\ngeneric example of what a treatment plan\nthis is just something i found on the\ninternet but once again this this\ndiagnostic system is kind of a little\nbit outdated so this is from dsm4 so\nwe've kind of updated this but the key\nthing here is once again there are clear\nthere's a principal diagnosis there's a\ndiagnosis that's assigned\num there's a duration of diagnosis there\nare functional deficits that are\nmentioned what are the issues what's\nissue number one what's goal number one\nwhat's objective number one what's task\nnumber one what's task number two what's\narea number two what's issue number two\nwhat's goal number two this is what\nconstitutes an actual treatment plan so\nwhen you perform therapy on someone\nyou're doing all of this stuff right\nso this kind of comes down to like do we\ndo therapy on stream and the answer is\nabsolutely not\nand the reason we're able to say that is\nbecause therapy is actually very very\ntightly regulated right it's not a\nmatter of opinion it's just because dr k\nbelieves we're not doing therapy doesn't\nmean that we're not doing therapy when\nwe set out we design stream with these\nconsiderations in mind\nso when i thought about okay what am i\nallowed to do on stream what is\nethically and legally appropriate to do\non stream the main conclusion is i'm not\nallowed to practice medicine on stream\neven then there may be some theoretical\nsituations in which that's possible but\ngenerally speaking that's the main\ndividing line so everything we do on\nstream is not the practice of clinical\nmedicine in order to sort of figure out\nwhat is okay on stream we can define\nwhat the practice of clinical medicine\nis or understand the definition so\nthat's not something we define that's\nsomething that we exhaustively looked up\nby looking through you know hundreds of\npages of medical ethics documents\nstate laws federal laws regulations\nlicensing board things\nethics uh you know sort of opinions on\nethics from the american medical\nassociation the american psychiatric\nassociation and what we sort of decided\nto do on stream is actually clearly\noutside of those things\nthe other simple gut check that i have\nfor you all is when you go to a doctor's\noffice\nhow similar is it to what happens on\nstream and the short answer is like not\nat all right because doctors are\npracticing clinical medicine and what\nwe're doing on stream is having\nconversations about mental health we do\nnot enter into a doctor-patient\nrelationship\nwe do not diagnose people with medical\nillnesses and we do not treat them for\nmedical illnesses\npsychotherapy is governed and regulated\nand the ethical standards around\npsychotherapists are under the broader\numbrella of clinical practice right so\nyou are not allowed to engage in a\nromantic relationship with your doctor\nyou're not allowed to engage in a\nromantic relationship with your\npsychotherapist you are not allowed to\nas a therapist violate your patient's\nprivacy the legal protections that we\nhave constitute protections from a\ndoctor-patient relationship and we don't\nenter into that we don't diagnose people\nand we don't treat people so then the\nnext question very naturally is why do\npeople think that what we do on stream\nis therapy right so where does this idea\ncome from what do we actually do on\nstream and are there any overlaps with\ntherapy so it's a really good question\nbecause i don't think most people like\nwe sort of mentioned most people haven't\nstudied medical ethics they don't really\nunderstand the definition of the\npractice of medicine they're not trained\nin diagnosis they're not trained in\ndeveloping treatment plans or doing\npsychotherapy so where to get they get\nthis idea that what we do on stream is\ntherapy\nso it's a really good question so what\nwe do on stream is we have conversations\nwith people\nthat are about their mental health and i\nuse some skills\nso i'm a very good listener for example\ni'm very good at asking questions i'm\nvery knowledgeable about things so i'll\nbuild some amount of an alliance with\nthe person that i'm talking to i'll be a\nvery active listener and i'll ask very\ninsightful questions so sometimes people\nthink that that constitutes therapy\nwhereas no that doesn't constitute\ntherapy so i'll just\nthink about this for a second there are\nother\nprofessions outside of therapists that\ndo these things so who builds an\nalliance very quickly with the person\nthat they're talking to who makes very\nempathic statements and tries to help\npeople open up\nfbi hostage negotiators right even\ncustomer service representatives if\nyou've been on a customer service talked\nto a customer service representative\nrecently you may have noticed that they\ndo some of the skills that are generally\nspeaking what we think of from therapy\nright they'll ask they'll make like very\nempathic statements oh i'm so sorry that\nyou had to go through that\nso this is like really important to\nunderstand but just because i'm a very\ngood listener and just because\ni'm very good at like asking questions\nand making observations and reading body\nlanguage that is not what actually\nconstitutes therapy in fact these are\nskills that are used by all kinds of\npeople so executives for example will\nget like interpersonal training and\ntraining in relationships and\ncommunication so these are skills like\ncommunication skills between people are\nthings that i absolutely do on stream\nbut i don't do anything medical on\nstream\nand oftentimes because people don't\nrecognize or understand what constitutes\nthe practice of clinical medicine which\nisn't really a problem because you're\nnot going to learn that unless you go to\nmedical school or you engage in some\nother kind of clinical education you\nknow it can look like what you imagine\ntherapy is because what do you imagine\ntherapy is it's like what you see based\non media and tv shows and stuff like\nthat whereas the truth is that the\npractice of clinical medicine is\ncompletely different\nso there may be like even though i've\nsort of made a very strong case and like\ni said we sort of set stream up to be\noutside the bounds of the practice of\nclinical medicine and therapy there's\nstill maybe some kind of confusion there\nso like what if you kind of make the\nargument for example that even though\ni'm a medical doctor and i'm not\nentering into a doctor-patient\nrelationship i'm not diagnosing anyone\nwith anything\nand i'm not providing treatment plans\nright so i'm not doing psychotherapy i'm\nnot um you know providing medications or\nanything like that i'm still a medical\nprofessional who is like listening\nempathically which sometimes is done in\ntherapy so therapists are absolutely\nempathic listeners so if i'm a medical\ndoctor am i allowed to empathically\nlisten to someone and ask someone\ninsightful questions\nor is that something that i'm no longer\nallowed to do except with my patients\nand that's kind of like absurd because\nthe answer is clearly i'm allowed to do\nthat with people without entering into a\ndoctor-patient relationship so for\nexample i do that with my kids i do that\nwith my wife i do that with my friends i\nwhen when human beings talk to me i try\nto be an empathic active listener when\nhuman beings talk to me i try to ask\ninsightful questions to help them out if\na friend of mine is going through a\nbreakup i'm going to sort of you know\nlisten to them very carefully i'm going\nto sort of maybe even get emotional with\nthem we'll sort of have a good cry\ntogether and then i may sort of ask some\nquestions or volunteer some information\nor teach them how to meditate just\nbecause something\nhappens within a therapeutic\nrelationship does not mean that it is\ntherapy when it happens outside of a\ntherapeutic relationship\nso just to kind of reiterate that\nlike if you really think about it like\nif that were true if i weren't allowed\nto have emotional conversations with\nother people like i couldn't interact\nwith other human beings in an empathic\nway and this is what's sort of brilliant\nabout the way that clinical medicine is\ndefined because it's defined about\nwhat's the goal right is it diagnosis or\ntreatment if yes then it's clinical\nmedicine if no then it's not clinical\nmedicine so there are other things\nbesides communication skills which can\nbe you know taught as part of clinical\nmedicine or used as part of clinical\nmedicine but aren't technically clinical\nmedicine so i'll give you all a couple\nof examples so as a physical therapist\nif you're a good physical therapist\nyou'll teach your patients to stretch\ndoes that mean that stretching is a part\nof physical therapy sort of but is it\nexclusive to physical therapy no so if\nyou go to a personal trainer who's a\nnon-clinical person they're allowed to\nteach people how to stretch as well then\nthe next question kind of becomes is a\nphysical therapist allowed to teach\npeople who are not their patients how to\nstretch absolutely right so if i'm a\nphysical therapist and on weekends i\nlike have a crossfit group and at the\nvery beginning of the crossfit group i\nteach people how to stretch even though\nit's a part of my clinical practice that\ni engage in it it's not exclusively a\nclinical activity so i'm allowed to do\nit with random people if i want to\nanother good example of this is\nmeditation so meditation is something\nthat's been shown to have a clinical\nbenefit so as a doctor i will teach\nmeditation to my patients does that mean\nthat if i teach meditation to someone\noutside of my doctor-patient\nrelationship that i am their doctor or\npracticing medicine absolutely not one\nof my mentors what is a zen priest and\nthey teach their patients how to\nmeditate and on the weekends they go to\nthe zen temple and they teach students\nhow to meditate that does not mean just\nbecause something can exist within\ntherapy does not mean that doing that\nthing outside of therapy like listening\nwell being a decent human being and\nasking good questions makes it the\npractice of therapy\nthe last thing that i'll say is that\nthis is also very clearly defined\nso in the practice of clinical medicine\nthere are some things that are\nexclusively clinical medicine and those\nare very tightly regulated and i am not\nactually allowed to do those things\noutside of a doctor-patient relationship\nso the simple example is like prescribed\ncontrolled medication so prescribing\nmedication is exclusive to the practice\nof clinical medic medicine so i can't\nprescribe adderall or opiates to my wife\nthat is actually considered unethical i\ncannot do particular things i cannot\ntreat diagnose or treat my wife i cannot\ndiagnose or treat my friend in fact that\nis a very very important ethical\nboundary which we respect at hg\nonce we have a relationship with someone\nthat is a non-clinical relationship we\ndon't cross that line\nso this is really really important to\nunderstand because there are some things\nthat therapists may do but those are not\nexclusively the practice of medicine and\neven as a medical provider i'm allowed\nto do those things with like ordinary\npeople without it being the practice of\nmedicine right so just like the physical\ntherapist who can teach someone to\nstretch just because it's a part of\ntheir clinical practice doesn't make it\nexclusively clinical practice and there\nare clear lines about what's exclusively\nthe practice of clinical medicine and we\ndon't do those things with anyone on\nstream so the next thing that i want to\ntalk a little bit about is the actual\nstream process so how does someone come\non stream what are the protections that\nwe use what are the standards that we\nhold to and so this is where there's\nanother really important part that i\nwant to talk about which is kind of an\nethical standard that we hold ourselves\nto\nwhich is informed consent so before\npeople come on stream\nwe they\nthey meet with a producer and the\nproducer sort of lays out with them what\nstream is what's allowed what's not\nallowed we make it very clear to them\nthat this is not the practice of\nmedicine that dr k is not your doctor\nand we make sure that they agree to that\nso we go through an informed consent\nprocess so if there's any confusion\nthere or they're looking for some kind\nof medical advice that's where things\nend right so we inform them and then we\ngo through the consent process and this\nis where the ethical principle of\nautonomy comes up so we at hg believe\nthat a human being an adult who wants to\ncome onto the internet and voluntarily\ntalk voluntarily talk to someone about\ntheir mental health should be able to we\nbelieve that human beings should have\nthe autonomy to make their own decisions\nso out of respect of that autonomy we\nwant to make things very crystal clear\nso we like you know have conversations\nwith them we also give them the\nopportunities to set boundaries on\nanything that they don't want to talk\nabout so this is not something where\nlike once they come on stream they're\nalso allowed to set boundaries in the\nmiddle of stream if they want to\nbut they're allowed to say hey i don't\nwant to talk about this on stream i\ndon't want to mention this on stream i\ndon't want to mention this on stream so\nwhat we essentially do is go through a\nrigorous informed consent process where\nwe explain very clearly this is not a\ndoctor-patient relationship and we make\nsure that they're on the same page if\nthere's any confusion there we either\nresolve that confusion or we sort of\nstop right because we are not going to\npractice clinical medicine on stream so\nhere at hg we actually hold ourselves to\na very high ethical standard despite the\nfact that we are not engaging in\nclinical activity so on stream i don't\npractice therapy because it's very\nclearly defined right so remember that\ntherapy is part of the subset of the\npractice of clinical medicine which is\nwhy you would get doctor patient\nprivileges you know you there are\nethical guidelines around your therapist\net cetera et cetera and remember that\nthe practice of clinical medicine is\nclearly defined as having three\ncomponents the bread is entry into the\ndoctor-patient relationship that's how\nit starts the sauce is diagnosis and the\ncheese is treatment and since we do none\nof those things we're not practicing\nclinical medicine and we're not doing\npsychotherapy with people on stream\nat the same time we hold ourselves to a\ncouple of really high standards so the\nfirst example that i'll give y'all and\nthis is in many dimensions of our our\ncompany and our work but the first is\nresearch so for example for all of our\nresearch studies we submit them to\nsomething called an independent review\nboard or an irb so there's a third party\norganization which is not affiliated\nwith us at all and when we want to do\nresearch we'll take our research study\nand we'll pass it to the irb and we'll\nsay hey we would like to do this\nresearch on human subjects will you\nplease evaluate it and tell us if it is\nin line in alignment with ethical\nprinciples and the irb is essentially\nthe they were developed kind of after\npeople did predatory research on on\nhuman subjects and so that we've\nactually had five independent reviews of\nour research in a sixth that's ongoing\nfor another study that we're doing that\nhave all sort of met an independently\nreviewed ethical criteria so we got the\ngreen light from an institutional review\nboard which is a third-party kind of\nethical organization that approves the\nresearch that we do so the other thing\nthat we hold ourselves to a high\nstandard to is being responsive to\nfeedback so here at hg we're sort of in\nnew territory right\nmental health is rapidly evolving the\nneeds of this generation in terms of\ntaking care of their mental health are\nrapidly evolving the solutions that we\nneed to use are rapidly evolving a\nhundred years ago no one was meditating\nfor the sake of their mental health but\nnow we have these new tools we have\nthese new challenges like social media\nand online toxicity and so as we sort of\nadapt to these new circumstances we\ndon't have all the answers at hg because\nno one has all the answers these\nproblems are new so a big thing that we\nsort of very very carefully focus on is\ntaking feedback and this is something\nthat we actually pride ourselves in hg\nhas gotten to where we are today because\nof the feedback from our community so\ni'll give you all just one simple\nexample of this\nin the past i'd talked a fair amount\nabout ayurveda generally speaking when i\ntalk about ayurveda i talk about it more\nfrom a personality analysis standpoint\nand as part of the support for ayurveda\ni cited a couple of scientific papers\nseven months ago someone in our\ncommunity made a post sort of\nquestioning the veracity of the research\nthat we were citing and it turns out\nthat they made really really good\narguments so we talked about it on\nstream addressed their criticism turns\nout that a lot of their criticisms were\nactually really good and for the last\nseven months we haven't said a word\nabout ayurveda internally we're going\nthrough the process of reviewing a whole\nbody of ayurvedic research\nmy point here is that sometimes at hg\nwe'll say particular things that we\nbelieve are correct and we'll even go do\nsome research and we'll cite papers and\nstuff like that but no scientific paper\nis perfect and as members from our\ncommunity will point out those kinds of\nthings we will absolutely adjust our\nbehavior\nso one of the things that we really\nvalue and hold ourselves to a very high\nstandard about is actually accepting\nfeedback from our community which is\nreally really helpful and is actually\nreally responsible for the impact that\nwe've been able to achieve\nthe last thing that i want to mention is\nthat the work that we do at hg is not in\na vacuum so like i sort of mentioned\nbefore we even showed up on stream we\ndid a ton of research about what\nactually constitutes therapy what\nactually constitutes the practice of\nmedicine and based on our research that\nis how we decide what to do as a simple\nexample\nthe world health organization in 2020\nreleased a report which sort of\nemphasized that mental health is in\ncrisis and one of the key interventions\nthat they said is they said people need\nto be doing more peer support\nthat clinicians are sort of insufficient\nand we can't train them fast enough to\nmeet the demands of what mental health\nneeds are so peer support is\nnon-clinical intervention that supports\nmental health and so it's because of\ncalls like that that we've developed\ncommunity support programs it's because\nof calls like that that we've even\ndeveloped our coaching program\nso here at hg what we're doing is not\njust like what we think is a good idea\nbut we regularly and consistently since\nbefore we even showed up on stream for\nthe first time have been consulting with\nindustry professionals psychiatrists\nprofessional organizations talking to\npeople for example like on\non the council of addictions talking to\npeople at the world health organization\nwe even recently had a collaboration\nwith the united nations so what we do at\nhg and this is\na standard that we hold ourselves to we\nrecognize that we don't have all the\nanswers we recognize that like this is a\nnew problem and that the best way to to\nsort of tackle this problem in sort of a\nresponsible way in an ethical way is to\ncontinually engage in dialogue with\nother professional organizations so\nthat's what we've done from the get-go\nthe next thing that i want to talk a\nlittle bit about is something that's a\nlittle bit more negative and that's hate\nfarming\nso\nthere's been an increasing and\ndisturbing trend on the internet\nrecently of people sort of being\nincreasingly critical and essentially\nfarming hate and i want to talk a little\nbit about what we've learned\nsort of in terms of our platform and\nsort of the the reach that we have and\nhow we try to behave in an ethical\nmanner\nso as a content creator you know i feel\nlike i have a duty to use my platform\nfor good\nthe unfortunate thing is that there are\nsome people out there who will use\nplatforms essentially for negative\nreasons so they'll hate farm or\ncriticize or things like that and like\ni've said we're actually completely open\nto criticism assuming that it's sort of\nfair\nand based in fact and is well cited so\nwe're completely open to criticism and\nquite responsive to criticism like that\nunfortunately what we're seeing on the\ninternet is an increasing amount of like\ntoxicity right like we can all feel that\nthe internet is becoming a more toxic\nplace and so what i'd like to do today\nis talk a little bit about how i've come\nto understand hate farming and sort of\nwhat goes into it\nso the first thing to understand is that\nhate farmers usually are operating on an\nemotional level and the main emotion\nthat they sort of target is a vague\nsense of righteousness so when you watch\na video by a hate farmer what you'll\noften find is that it's very emotional\nin nature right so it's going to have\nvery powerful imagery it may have sort\nof a very strong title may have sort of\na very powerful thumbnail\nand as they sort of con as they start to\nweave their narrative like what you're\ngoing to be feeling is some sense of\noutrage or irateness or things like that\nand the more that that hate farmers kind\nof engage your emotions right because\nthat's what it's about it's about making\nyou angry it's about making you grab\nyour pitchfork let's all grab our\npitchforks and down with the bad guys\nthat's where the emotions that they\nengage what they're sort of doing by\ndoing that is sort of ignoring any kind\nof like\nyou know real criticism so oftentimes\nthere are different kinds of critical\nvideos on the internet some are very\nwell sourced well cited kind of\noffer balanced perspectives and hate\nfarmers usually won't have that right so\nthey'll usually have some kind of\nnarrative where they sort of will find a\nbunch of information on the internet and\nthis is where like it's challenging as a\ncontent creator because you know we've\nprobably streamed for well over a\nthousand hours and if you go through all\nof the the content that we've done you\ncan stitch together basically whatever\nkind of narrative you want to so a\nreally good example of this if you all\nhaven't seen it is dr k interviews dr k\nwhich is when someone takes clips of me\nand like stitches them together as if\ni'm having a conversation so you can\nsort of clip things into context to\nweave whatever kind of narrative you\nwant to\nso the first thing to understand about\nhate farmers is that they work primarily\non an emotional level and will really\nsort of encourage you to get your pitch\nfocus out they may make some kind of\nnarrative argument which sounds very\nlogical at the time but this is where\noftentimes what hate farmers do was will\ncome up with a priori arguments and what\ndoes that mean and that means that the\njudgment\nactually precedes the collection of\nevidence\nso i'll go into a little bit more detail\nthere so oftentimes if you look at\npeople who are critical and people who\nare hate farmers they sort of assume\nguilt at the very beginning right so\nthey they haven't really done an\nobjective investigation something has\nhappened and they've sort of decided\nthat you're guilty\nand then something really tricky happens\nis that once they've decided your guilt\nthey'll start collecting information\nthe problem is that on the internet\nsearch and the way that you collect\ninformation is going to probably\nreinforce your biases so i'll give you a\nsimple example of this if i believe that\nthe earth is flat and i let's say\ndo a google search for you know\nevidence that the earth is not round\nwhat i'm going to find is a bunch of\nevidence that actually already supports\nmy conclusion so you'll even see this\nwith particular hate farmers well\nthey'll do things like they'll tweet out\nor they'll make public calls\nstating a particular direction so\nthey'll say like i'm going to make a\nvideo about x y or z and how let's say\nthis person is taking advantage of\npeople and so what kind of response do\nyou think that person is going to get\nwhen i put a call out on twitter or when\ni do a google search in a particular\ndirection is covet a hoax\nwhat kind of response do you think i'm\ngoing to get if i tweet out about saying\nhey i'm doing a video about you know\nunreported\nside effects and bad consequences of\ngetting covet 19 vaccinations what kind\nof information do you think that person\nis going to receive so what hate farmers\ndo is they come up with a conclusion and\nthen they start collecting evidence\nright and i'm not so sure that they're\ndoing this like insidiously on and on\npurpose is it harmful absolutely but i\nthink that they sort of stumble upon\nsome idea and then it actually shapes\nthe questions that they ask and once you\nshape the questions that you ask you're\ngoing to shape the responses that you\nget and this is precisely why if we look\nat a scientific standard\nof how to collect information making\ntwitter posts is like not a good way to\ncollect information so as if you submit\na study to the irb that has a loaded\nquestion in it the irb the institutional\nreview board will say this is a bad\nquestion you cannot ask this question\nbecause it is it is biased by its nature\nso we this is where in scientific\nresearch like we understand this stuff\nreally well when we formulate questions\nwhen you ask a research question it has\nto be approved by someone who sort of\nmakes sure that it isn't biased but when\nit comes to hate farmers like they don't\ngo to independent review boards to see\nif their question is biased in some way\nand so then what happens is you create a\nselection bias for information right so\nif i make a post let's say i tweet\nsomething out and i tweet out that all\nmen are i'm making a video\nabout it message me if you have any\ninformation about this i'm gonna get a\nvolume of response that agrees with what\ni say the second thing is you could do\nthe opposite you could say all women are\n and i'll get the same thing\nright so i'll get a bunch of people who\nhate women who kind of respond to me\nand this is the tricky thing is that\noftentimes what hate farmers will do is\nthat based on that response they'll\nfilter it right so this is where a\ncognitive bias\nuh kind of steps in where even if you\ncall for a particular kind of\ninformation you're going to get the\nmajority of what you're looking for\nanyway because it's the internet and\nthere's like an infinite amount of\nopinions\nyou'll also sort of\noccasionally find people like experts\nand so this is really important to\nunderstand\na collection like stringing together a\ngroup of expert opinions does not\nactually constitute evidence\nso let's remember that tobacco\nindustries were able to find dozens of\nphysicians who under oath swore that\ncigarettes did not cause lung cancer\nlet's remember that there are\nanti-covered\ninformation dissemination platforms out\nthere that find medical doctors who say\nthat vaccination is a mistake\nstringing together a couple of experts\nwhich is what hate farmers will do right\nso they'll give you the appearance of\nevidence and the way that they'll do\nthat is find a couple of credentialed\npeople who agree with them but they're\nnot going to include people in the video\nwho disagree with them right that's just\nnot part of the narrative that they\nweave and so what ends up happening in\nthat the tools that hate farmers use is\nthey'll sort of start with kind of some\nclick-baity stuff right and then they'll\nengage your emotions and then they'll\nbased on their selection bias will\ncollect a bunch of information and then\nthey'll string that information together\nand it sort of makes sense right because\nif i make a if i ask a video if i make a\ntweet about oh i'm you know trying to\nfigure out why the moon landing was was\na hoax and i'll get 50 people to respond\nto me and then when i make a video about\nit i'll take the 10 strongest people and\ni'll stitch them together and now what\ni've done over a one hour youtube video\nas i've made a very strong case for a\nparticular thing\nbut this is why i remind you that\nespecially when it comes to some of the\ncriticism that we've faced it's not a\nmatter of opinion it's a matter of law\nright these things are very clearly\ndesignated and we are in compliance with\nthese kinds of things\nso when it comes to hate farming be a\nlittle bit careful about this stuff\nright because this is happening more and\nmore on the internet and i oddly enough\ni don't even necessarily blame these\npeople because i don't know that the\npeople who make hateful videos\nhave done any kind of training with like\nhow to formulate a good non-biased\nresearch question that's something that\nyou know i learned through four years of\ngetting a master's in public health in\nsome amount of like as an md you\ngenerally see speaking formulating\nresearch questions is actually like a\nvery technical and difficult thing to do\nso i think what's happening is people\nwill sort of come to an a priory\nconclusion they already decide that\nsomething is bad and then they'll sort\nof ask questions in a way that\nreinforces their bias\nthis is why the internet is turning into\necho chambers and this is what's leading\nto toxicity the last thing that i want\nto talk a little bit about is that\nunfortunately recently we've been the\nrecipient of some hate farming this is\nkind of hit kind of close to home and\none of the things that really bothers me\nabout this these hate farmers is is not\nnecessarily the personal attacks\nbut their decision to include reckful in\nthese videos and what actually really\nkind of pisses me off to be honest is\nnot even that they included reckful but\nthe picture that they paint of him\nwhat really bothers me is that in order\nto attack me what they've managed to do\nis they spin this narrative about\nreckful as like someone who is like\neasily manipulated and like couldn't\nkind of think for himself and stuff like\nthat\nand that's actually what bothers me the\nmost is that in order to attack me\nthey're actually like portraying a\npicture of byron that is completely\ninaccurate\nif you knew byron which i did and he was\na very close friend of mine\nlike the dude was brilliant right like\nhe was incredibly independent he was\nfierce with his views he was fierce with\nlike you know advocating for himself he\nwas strong he was a force to be reckoned\nwith and he was an absolute hero of the\ninternet\nand so what really bothers me the most\nis like the way that they're portraying\nhim is like some kind of like you know\nweak victim like byron was an absolute\nbeast right reckful gladiator was an\nabsolute beast on stream he brought so\nmany people together how was he able to\ndo that it's because he was so damn\nsmart and he was so critical with his\nthinking and he was so open about his\nstruggles right\nhe inspired so many people to get mental\nhealth treatment and what sort of\nbothers me the most is that in all of\nthis discussion of byron no one is sort\nof talking about\nwhat byron did for us\nright because the truth is he did a ton\nfor us and i don't just mean me i don't\nmean hg what i mean is like the internet\nthe twitch community the gaming\ncommunity\nand so this is where i want to talk a\nlittle bit about sort of ending things\nalmost on a personal note because like\nthe way that our relationship has been\nmisconstrued is very like hurtful and\nthe truth of the matter is that byron\nand i never entered into a\ndoctor-patient relationship right we\nwere friends we were professional we\nwere professional colleagues we were\nboth streamers that's the nature of our\nrelationship\nand one of the things that i've really\ncome to appreciate is that as a\nprofessional streamer i have a\nresponsibility as a content creator and\nwhat we try to do at hg is use our\nplatform for good and the term aoe\nhealing actually came from byron he was\nthe first person who said it sounds like\nwhat y'all are doing is aoe healing and\nthat's what we're really about because\nthe world health organization the us\nsurgeon general the united nations and\nall y'all out there\nalready know that mental health is in\ncrisis that clinical medicine cannot\nkeep up with the rate of like what we're\ndealing with that some of the challenges\nthat we face in mental health are even\nnot clinical in nature\nfinding purpose in life developing\nconfidence\nlearning how to form healthy\nrelationships learning how to meditate\nthere is a lot more to mental health\nthan mental illness and that is what we\nwant to use our platform for that is why\nwe're incredibly grateful to byron for\nthe contributions that he made and like\nthe way that he helped us do that we're\nalso incredibly grateful to our\ncommunity for supporting us in this\nmission and the reason that i did this\nbecause i am a medical doctor and i\nwalked away from the majority of\nclinical practice is because what i saw\nat home in my office was the same\nproblem over and over and over again and\nmore requests than i could possibly deal\nwith hundreds of thousands or thousands\nof people reaching out to me asking me\nfor help and there's no way that i can\nget to them\nso as a content creator and this is for\nall the other content creators out there\ni encourage you all to think very\ncarefully about how can we use this\nplatform because there is so much\ntoxicity on the internet there is so\nmuch hate farming going on people are\nforming echo chambers misogyny and\nmisandry are at all times high people\nhate men on a level that they never have\nbefore people hate women on a level that\nthey never have before the amount of\nhatred on the internet is reaching\nepidemic proportions\nsocial media is wreaking havoc on our\nmental health we have a generation of\npeople who can't leave their house\nbecause of gaming and watching youtube\nand all this kind of stuff and so at the\nend of the day as content creators we\nhave a responsibility to use the tools\nof the internet to make the world a\nbetter place\nand that's what we're here to do at hg\nthe thing is we cannot do it alone and\nthis is exactly why we need your help\nyour participation your feedback to help\nus in this mission because there's no\nway that we can fix this problem on our\nown\nwe're going to do our level best to try\nwe're going to do it in as ethical and\nresponsible of a manner as we can\npossibly do it we've adhered to state\nguidelines federal guidelines standards\nof practice from the american\npsychiatric association the american\nmedical association and we're going to\ncontinue to do the work that we need to\ndo and i'm asking all of y'all for help\nin terms of doing this right so whether\nit's meditating for yourself or\nbeing compassionate towards someone else\ntrying to understand someone else's\nproblems not jumping to judgment not\ngiving into toxicity the only way we can\nfix mental health and the problems that\nthe world faces is together so it comes\ndown to aoe healing and thank you very\nmuch for watching the video and\nparticipating in what we're doing"
