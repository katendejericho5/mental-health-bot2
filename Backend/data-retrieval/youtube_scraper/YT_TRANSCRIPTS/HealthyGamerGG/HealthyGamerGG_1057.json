    "transcript": "how do i learn to accept love\nhi everyone i'm 18f and i recently\nstarted seeing this guy this is the\nfirst person that i've dated and i'm\nstarting to notice a few things a few\noff things regarding how i perceive the\nrelationship\ni get uncomfortable when he flirts with\nme and at one point i thought he was\ntrying to manipulate me by love bombing\nme but when i looked up actual love\nbombing he's the farthest from it\ngrowing up i didn't have a father and my\nmother wasn't very explicit with her\nlove for me though i knew it was there\ni was treated pretty badly throughout my\nschool years and bullied in high school\ni find myself having a pretty low sense\nof self-worth and i feel unlovable\nsometimes\ni think the guy that i'm seeing is a\nreally good person and i don't want to\nscrew things up\ni don't know how to accept his\ncompliments i say thank you but on the\ninside i feel like he's lying to me or\nhe pities me\nbut i know rationally that isn't true\nit's just that when he says i'm pretty\nor he offers to take me home i feel\nextremely guilty and i feel like i need\nto pay him back in some way\ni know people do nice things and i\nshould just let them and i should just\nlet them but i feel so guilty because i\nfeel like i don't deserve it\nthese patterns kind of spill over into\nmy platonic relationships as well\ni find myself wanting to love others but\nnever wanting to be loved i love\nspoiling my friends with small gifts or\nfavors spending time with them or just\nbeing there every time they need me\ni feel like i can't depend on people how\nthey depend on how people depend on me\npeople say that i'm not a bad person but\ni can't help feeling like i am a bad\nperson on the inside and i just\nmasquerade as a good friend and\neventually someone is going to rip off\nthis mask and that i have and discover\nthe truth objectively i know that there\nare a bunch of discrepancies between\nreality and how i feel and i feel silly\nfor putting all of my thoughts out there\nif anyone has advice for this i would\nfeel greatly i would greatly appreciate\nit thank you\nokay\nso\nsome people are saying is this me as a\ngirl i know this is shocking but\nsometimes your genitalia does not\ncorrelate with your experience and that\nmen and women can have similar\nexperiences\ni know it is shocking\nso i just want to first shout out uh\ngive a shout out to this person because\nlike i want y'all to like think a little\nbit about how hard it is to\npost something like this right to feel\nsilly\nobjectively\nlike recognize that you're putting\nsomething out there that does not\ninternally make sense it actually makes\nperfect sense\nbut like it takes so much to be able to\npost this\nright like you'll see that and there's\nso much here like\num i'm starting to notice a few off\nthings about how i perceive in the\nrelationship like this is what i mean\nabout the quality of posts so the person\nlike is very aware of what they're\nexperiencing recognizes some\ndiscrepancies and is able to state it\nanyway despite the fact that it kind of\nfeels silly\nbecause if you have low self-esteem\nand there's some kind of logical\ninconsistency it's really hard for you\nto ask for help right you're like this\nis just my stupid head\nthat doesn't make any sense like i don't\neven know what how someone can help\nsomeone that's like head is as stupid as\nmy thoughts are\nbut the fact that they're able to do\nthis is actually a huge huge like step\nin in the right direction they're able\nto notice some of their thoughts and\nfeelings which are not perfectly aligned\nand they're able to\nset aside their self-judgment and like\ntake a step forward in the right\ndirection\nright so this is fantastic\ni mean this situation sounds tough but\nwe'll get there too but like i'm really\nproud of like people for the quality of\nthe post the other thing to remember is\nthat the community deserves a shout out\ntoo because\nwe would not get posts like this unless\nthe responses\nwere solid\nright so if there's a bunch of like\nhatred kind of responses like oh you're\na girl like what are you complaining\nabout men have it so much harder or the\nflip side of you know like if there was\nlike really invalidating stuff then\npeople wouldn't post things like this\nright so it's been a lot of hard work\nand and by hard work i mean i think each\nand every one of you has been a part of\nthis i don't and i don't think sometimes\npeople realize\nlike how you affect the community\nright it's like little things like\nreading this and not responding in a\ntoxic way or responding in a positive\nway that make posts like this possible\nseriously i'm not kidding go look at\nother\ngo look at like other places on the\ninternet\nright like other support communities\nlike\nyou know like\nslash r\nsad\nand like forever alone and like other\nplaces where there's just a lot of\nlike toxicity\num\nor there's just kind of like this echo\nchamber empty support right which is\nlike oh it's never your fault like\nthere's some subreddits like that where\nit's like it's never your fault you're\nawesome you keep doing you what i'm\nreally proud of our community for is\nthat we're self-reflective\nwe will like point out things but we'll\ndo it with kind of compassion which is\nawesome okay so let's get to this\nso the first thing is as we've talked a\nlittle bit about today let's do a quick\nreminder\nso our ahamkar is our sense of identity\nsamskar is an experience that we've had\nthat shapes our personality\nright so what happens is we have a bunch\nof experiences that shape our reactions\nto things\nand based on those experiences we\ndevelop a personality or sense of\nidentity\nokay\nso if you're in a relationship and you\nfeel like you don't deserve love and\nthis is like actually a really good\nexample of this i find myself wanting to\nlove others but never wanting to be\nloved right i'm the person who spoils\nothers and spends time with them but\nlike\ni can't accept their affection like it's\na one-way street because they are good\npeople and they deserve love but i am\nnot\nand therefore i don't and like\ncompliments make me feel like\nuncomfortable because i don't really\ndeserve compliments or affection or to\nbe cared for\nso where does this kind of\nsense of self because this is an\nidentity issue right this person does\nnot feel like they deserve love like\ntheir idea of what they deserve is not\nthis\nso there are a couple of important\nthings here the first is how does this\nform right so we can kind of see this i\nwas treated pretty badly throughout my\nschool years and bullied in high school\nso i find myself having a pretty low\nself-worth and i feel unlovable\nsometimes\nso let's just like think about these are\njust two sentences which is like i was\nbullied so check mark right in terms of\nyour history but what does that actually\ndo to a person let's try to understand\nwhat does bullying do to a person\nso what do you deserve\nright how do you determine what you\ndeserve so let's like think a little bit\nabout you know like if you're a slave\nlike if you're a slave let's say like a\nthousand years ago\nwhat did you deserve\nwell like you deserve like less than\nother people right a lot of slaves\ndidn't even feel like they deserved\nfreedom i mean i've i haven't talked to\na bunch of slaves so i don't really know\nbut i'm making that assumption\nbut i've definitely seen for example\nlike in india there's still somewhat of\nlike i mean there isn't like a strict\ncaste system but there's like upper\nclass people and lower class people\nthere are bunches of servants and and\nyou know like there's like this clear\nidea of like what each group of people\ndeserves\nso there's like a first class cabin in a\ntrain and there's a third class cabin in\nthe train in the first class cabin\npeople get to sit down and third class p\npeople get to stand\nso i've seen in in my own personal life\nlike how\npeople are taught\nwhat to expect from the world and what\nthey deserve\nand so when you're bullied\nright when people like make fun of you\nlike on a fundamental level since your\nmind isn't really that developed\nyou just get some like basic programming\nthat's really like foundational there's\nnot a whole lot of nuance there's not a\nwhole lot of like understanding or\ndigestion or reflection\nthere's just this is how it is\nso when you're a seven-year-old and like\neveryone makes fun of you what do you\nlearn about yourself you learn that oh\ni'm the person that people get\ngets made fun of\nand who gets the praise and adoration\nthe bully does\nright\nwho gets respected and compliments\nand who gets treats the bully does\nand what do you get\nyou get the crap\nyou get the short end of the stick you\nget to be the butt of the jokes and all\nthe good stuff\ngoes to the bully and all the bad stuff\ngoes to you and if this happens to you\nat a very young age and it's quite\nprofound and doesn't have the right\ncounterbalancing influences there's a\nlot here where like maybe your home life\nalso is important right so like your\nparents don't support you in the right\nway or don't give you that sense of\nidentity of like unconditional love to\nkind of counter that\ni'm not saying it's their fault but like\nyou know generally speaking not everyone\nbully\nbeing bullied ends up like this did we\nsee something about\nyeah okay uh we didn't see much about\nthis person's what their parental what\ntheir what the relationships of their\nparents are like but that's where you\nsee a lot of good modeling\nso if you sort of learn this about\nyourself then it kind of becomes true\nright so it becomes a part of your\npersonality it becomes a part of your\nidentity that i'm the butt of jokes and\ni'm not the person who gets complimented\nand believe me kids are really good at\nthis kids are really good at dividing\npeople into groups there's the popular\nkids and they're not popular kids\nthere's a reason why high school is\nbrutal it's because instinctively we're\nvery hierarchical as children so just\nlike the popular kids and the not\npopular kids and you get determined you\nget placed in a particular category\nwhich you understand and they understand\nso once everyone understands the social\nhierarchy there's some degree of harmony\nthere because everyone has agreed on\nwhat steps people take\nand this is why people don't like it\nwhen people get uppity in a social\nhierarchy right like human beings\nrespond very poorly to people getting\nuppity we even have a word for it\nthey're like uppity like you don't know\nyour place right sure it's toxic but\nit's natural\nso\nwhat do you do about this right so the\nfirst thing is to understand that these\nexperiences\nare carried forward from the past they\ndon't necessarily reflect on the present\nso what our mind does is carries forward\nenergy from our some scars from the past\nto the present\nso for example like the fact that you\ndon't feel there was so much resentment\nno maybe not resentment there's so much\nlike\nlow self-worth which you built up during\nyour teenage years\nand you haven't processed that you\nhaven't therapized it you haven't you\nknow\nspiritually removed it so you carry all\nthose emotions with you right it's like\nemotional baggage we understand this in\nterms of romantic relationships when you\nhave a bad romantic relationship you\ncarry the emotional baggage forward\nso when you have a life of being bullied\nyou're carrying that emotional baggage\nto the present the key thing here\nis that\nyou need to recognize that that is not\nfrom this even though you're feeling it\nin the present it is not created from\nthis relationship your boyfriend is not\nlove bombing you your boyfriend is\ngenuinely like appreciating who you are\nbut the reason it feels like a love bomb\nthe reason that it feels fake\nis because you have this\nidea from the past that you don't\ndeserve this stuff\nright so if you don't deserve\ncompliments and someone is complimenting\nyou the only logical conclusion you can\ncome to is there's some kind of\nmanipulation going on\nright it's like really simple\ncompletely logical like i know the\nperson feels silly like it doesn't make\nsense it actually makes perfect sense\nit's like if i'm a pos and someone is\ntreating me well\nwhat am i missing where's the other shoe\nwhat do they want from me like what's\ngoing on here because i definitely don't\ndeserve this treatment it's actually\nperfectly logical\nokay\nbut that's emotional baggage carried\nfrom the past\nso this is where in the moment when you\nsort of feel that way you need to ask\nyourself is this a feeling that's being\ncreated by this interaction or is this\nan old feeling that is being stirred up\nand the more that you're able to\nrecognize oh this is a feeling that i've\nhad from the past that's just like\nreawakening just notice it kind of like\nthink through it a little bit let it go\nand and then like you know be where you\nare with your boyfriend\nand the more that you do that the more\nthe the baggage will kind of like\ndecrease and the more you'll be able to\nappreciate the compliments okay that's\nnumber one\nso number two and i saw someone kind of\npost about this or mention this the\nother thing is sometimes the way that\npeople react to this\nis by mastery of the trauma so this is a\ncommon thing that sometimes this is why\nabusers i mean\nthe abused become abusers\nso there's this psychological thing\nwhere like if i'm on the receiving end\nof a particular interaction if i'm the\nvictim and there's a bully\ni can become powerful in that scenario\nby switching roles\nso the way that i'm gonna like fix this\nemotional victimization is by becoming\nthe perpetrator because there's like one\nvictim in the scenario\nand one person with power so there's the\npowerful and the powerless and in the\npast i have been the powerless and f\nthat i'm never being powerless again so\nhow can i become powerful oh i can start\nbullying people\nso this is what you see you see that\nlike you know a lot of bullies like have\nbad home situations right i mean\nsometimes they're just [ __ ] and they\nhave good home situations and don't get\nappropriately parented which i guess is\na bad home situation as well but\nso sometimes bullies are because they\nyou know parents don't set limits on\nthem they're like brats\nand they don't like experience\nconsequences but then there's the flip\nside of it too which is like the reason\nthey're abusive to other kids is because\nthey get abused at home so like you know\ntheir parents make fun of them or nasty\nto them so they just like learn that\nbehavior and then they mimic it\nelsewhere\nso we can see like mastery of the trauma\nby like role reversal like that can\nhappen too it's not happening in this\nsituation but that can result you know\nthat can happen too\nand so then also like you know\nwhat can you kind of like do about this\nin a very practical sense there are a\ncouple of other things to consider\nthe first is that if you're an\naltruistic person who does not like to\nbe helped by other people there's\nsomewhat of a little bit of a trick that\nyou can use for your mind i don't think\nit fixes the core problem but it can it\ncan help you can serve as a band-aid\nwhich is recognize that sometimes the\nnicest thing that you can do for someone\nelse\nis to let them do something nice for you\nright so like you like the way that it\nfeels to do something good for someone\nright\nyou like to be like a kind person\nand recognize that by accepting their\ncompliments\nis like your opportunity to just like\nthink about your boyfriend for a second\nso your boyfriend says thinks thinks\nyou're pretty and says hey you look\nreally great today\nand if you're like no i don't\nscrew you why are you saying that right\nthat's your instinctive reaction like\nhow does your boyfriend feel it feels\nterrible\non the flip side you could say you know\nif you say like thank you so much like i\nwas having a rough day today and like\nhearing that i'm having trouble\nbelieving it\nbut i'm so like happy that you feel that\nway\nlike even if you say that like how's\nyour boyfriend gonna feel you're gonna\nmake him turn him into chad mode he's\ngonna be like damn\nmy girlfriend was having a bad day and\nshe like can't really accept the\ncompliment but like still i'm doing\nsomething good for her i feel great\nabout myself because i am making someone\nelse's life better\nright\nso when you let other people do things\nfor you\nyou know it's it's kind of a it's like a\nreally nice thing to do for them\nright and that's like how you form bonds\nwith people so i've so some time ago you\nknow i i used to like always turn down\ngifts\nyou know like i like people would want\nto give me gifts like i'd have like a\nmentee like i'd write like a letter\nrecommendation or something right so buy\nsome kid\nand they'd be like i want to send you\nlike a card to say thank you i'll be\nlike you don't need to do that\nit's not necessary but then i realized\nlike i'm actually doing them a\ndisservice\nright\nit's like let them express gratitude\nlike let them practice gratitude like\nlet them express gratitude and then i\nwill accept their gratitude\nand then like i will just tell them that\ni appreciate their gratitude and like\nit's great on all sides\nso this is so confusing because when i\nstarted being a therapist i was kind of\nlike\nit was really tricky right because\npeople would say thank you so much dr k\ni'm like i didn't really do much so it\nmade me uncomfortable so i wouldn't\naccept their things\ni'd like reject it because it made me\nfeel weird they're like oh my god like\nyou've transformed my life\nit's like\ndid i what are you talking about bro i\njust like we've just chatted for a while\ni'm glad you're doing better but it's\nmostly you\nright and then i was like that's\nactually kind of doing them into the\nservice and so that's then i'll say like\nyou know\nyou're like\ni'm so glad that your life is doing\nbetter i think at the end of the day we\nmeet for one hour a week and you're like\nliving your life for 100 hours a week so\ni think it's more you than me but i'm\nhappy to accept whatever gratitude you\nhave so\nright on bro and like keep on trucking\nand you're very welcome for whatever you\nknow whatever you're great like you're\nwelcome\nif it was mostly you\nright so you just accept the ground like\naccept what they and then like because\nhow is that person gonna feel if they\ncome in and they say thank you so much\nand i'm like i didn't do anything it's\nlike their gratitude just it it explodes\nin in the hangar you know it doesn't\nlike get to\nget out\nthere and so you just let you know\naccept it so when someone wants to do\nsomething nice for you recognize that\nfor them one of the nice the nicest\nthings you can do is as genuinely as\npossible try to accept what they want to\ndo for you\nand as you start to engage in these\nkinds of things you're gonna have\ndifferent some scars\nright and you'll start to recognize like\nif this happens enough like oh maybe i\nam bringing something to the table not\neverything not as much as this person\nthinks i think i'm bringing a little bit\nless but i'm bringing something to the\ntable and i can be happy for that\nright there's some truth to this\nso if you have trouble accepting love\nyou can start by sort of understanding\nyou know where does this idea that i\ndon't deserve to be loved come from\nyou can also start altering your\nbehavior a little bit recognize that\neven though it makes you uncomfortable\nit can actually be really really nice to\naccept someone else's gratitude\nthat you're actually like that's a nice\nthing to do for them\nkind of a little bit of a band-aid\nand the last thing is that\nyou know i don't know how else to say\nthis but you seem like a fantastic\nperson\nright so like i i think you're\nabsolutely deserving of love like i\ndon't get where like just like look at\nthis look at how awesome this person is\nto like imagine if this person was in\nyour life\nso i find myself wanting to love others\ni love spoiling my friends with small\ngifts and favors\nspending time with them\nlike that's i mean it sounds fantastic\nright like they're self-reflective they\nlike they're not automatic they're not\nreactive\nso like i'm not surprised that people\nyou know are happy to you know like this\ndude is happy to date this girl because\nshe seems like a fantastic person she\nmay have difficulty recognizing that but\ni think we can all agree\nright that this is like a good person to\ndate\nand it's okay that that that doesn't\nsink in yet right because you've got all\nthis\nso this is gonna like not make sense\nand so this is the last thing that i'll\nkind of leave you all with objectively i\nknow there are a bunch of discrepancies\nbetween reality and how i feel and yeah\nthat's because\nyou were told in the first half of your\nlife that you're unlovable and now\nyou're being told that you are lovable\nand so that's going to feel like a\ndiscrepancy because it is one\nbecause like it sounds like you were\nsurrounded by [ __ ] earlier and now\nyou're in a like what sounds like a\nhealthy relationship\nso like there's it's going to feel\ncontradictory and silly to you and this\nis the real problem this is the kind of\nthe bullet you have to dodge sometimes\nthere's a trap here\nwhich is that if you are in a healthy\nrelationship and you like turn to the\ninternet\nthey're gonna tell you oh my god he's\nlove bombing you don't trust them right\ndepending on who you go to\nwhat echo chamber you choose to\nparticipate in they will actually\nsupport whatever your paranoia is\nand so then i think this person did the\nright thing which is they looked up love\nbombing and they realized that like\nthat's not what love bombing is\nbut this is the other problem with the\ninternet is that we like to label things\nreally really quickly and like here's\njust a quick aside so gas lighting is a\ngood example of this\nso gas lighting is something that is\ngenerally speaking a systemic and\nmalicious process that's aimed to disarm\nsomeone's like ability of judgment right\nit's like when you convince someone that\nthey're crazy\nbut\nnowadays i hear gaslighting used anytime\nsomeone has a different opinion from\nyours so human beings have different\nexperiences of shared events like if i\nhave an argument with my wife about\nsomething\ngoing to think one way about it i'm\ngoing to recall one thing and they're\ngoing to recall something else\nand now i've seen something really\ntricky which is that when someone says\nyou did this to me and i say no i didn't\nand they respond with you're gaslighting\nme there's a gas lighter here\nit you can't argue against that right\nlike it it's become something of a weird\ntrump card that like once you play the\ngaslighting card it's like i can't say\nanything because i'm just gaslighting\nyou further like i'm not allowed to have\nan opinion if you accuse me of\ngaslighting because anything i say is\njust proof of the gaslighting right it's\nlike kind of weird what's happening\nit says no you don't get to have a\ndifferent experience or different\nperspective from me\nso be super careful\nabout labels on the internet because in\nmy experience\ninteractions tend to be like nuanced and\nmulti-perspective but what we're\nstarting to do on the internet is get\nlike terminology like we had a really\ngood post the other day\nabout someone was like i had a bad\nsexual experience i'm not interested in\nhaving sex again am i asexual\nand i see this a lot nowadays where\nwe're starting to label ourselves with\nthings we join that identity and then we\ndon't really acknowledge that sexuality\nis like an evolving process right\nso what happens when we start to label\nourselves is like then we was like i'm\nasexual because i had a bad sexual\nexperience i go to an asexual community\nwhere everyone else is asexual they\nencourage me they say hey you can have a\nlovely wonderful experience being\nasexual like it's okay it's it's a\nnormal variant of humanity and i'm fine\nwith that i'm not saying that there's\nanything wrong with being asexual the\nproblem is that sometimes we\ninappropriately label ourselves\nso i've had patients for example who\nhave vaginismus who describe themselves\nas\nasexual so vaginismus is a\na spasm\nof the vaginal muscles which makes it\nvery painful or even impossible for you\nto have penetrative intercourse\nand so they didn't realize they had\nvaginismus they just thought they were\nasexual which is like fine\nright like there's nothing wrong with\nbeing asexual but sometimes just because\nyou have difficulty having sex or don't\nenjoy sex doesn't necessarily mean\nyou're asexual there's a differential\ndiagnosis for that but the second we\nlabel something\nand the second we become a part of that\nidentity\nthen we could be losing something right\nlike because that identity may not apply\nand i hope to god this is not being\ninterpreted as like dr k is against\nasexual people i have nothing against\nasexual people all i'm saying is don't\nlabel yourself too early\nonce you've done a very thorough\ninvestigation by all means label\nyourself as asexual and live a happy and\nfulfilling life without sex\nwhich is what most married people have\nto learn how to do in their 40s and 50s\nright\nso like we can manage that\nso it's okay just don't label yourself\nprematurely and be careful about some of\nthese labels because don't label your\npartner as gaslighting\nwhen all they're doing is disagreeing\nright like human beings are allowed to\nhave because that's the kind of thing\nthat is actually going to negatively\nhurt your relationships if you have a\nrelationship with someone and they\ndisagree with you and you start accusing\nthem of gaslighting like you can't have\na conversation there there can't be a\nway to resolve that conflict once you\nplay that card\nso be super careful about all these like\nterms that are getting tossed around\nwhich absolutely can describe behavior\nand sometimes be\nappropriate like another good example is\nlike monkey branching right where people\nare like this person's monkey branching\nthey're waiting till they have their\nnext person in order to before they\nbreak up with this person it's like yeah\nsome people are like that but the truth\nis that sometimes relationships are like\ncomplex and they're not intentionally\nmonkey branching maybe the reason that\nthey're like breaking up with you and\ndating this person in rapidity is for\nall kinds of reasons one is that they\ncan't tolerate being alone\nso like they're just a serial dater that\nhas nothing to do with monkey branching\nthat just has to do with their inability\nto be by themselves it's a very real\npossibility another option is maybe the\nrelationship was dead on the inside and\nthey didn't realize that until they met\nsomeone else that started to like they\nstarted to catch feelings for\nand that's when they sort of started to\nrealize and i've seen this too\nwhere it's like i didn't realize like\nhow bad this relationship was until i\nmet someone else\nlike how empty the relationship has\nbecome it doesn't mean they're monkey\nbranchers\nthere's all kinds of reasons that can\nexplain any given interaction for human\nbeings so just be a little bit careful\nabout judging things prematurely\nand i realize i've come way far astray\nfrom from the post\nbut\nanyway\nso kind of going back to this so like\nfor this person just be careful about\nlabeling things right\nrecognize i guess the key takeaway here\nis that relationships and human beings\nare complex processes a human being in\nand of themselves is an incredibly\ncomplex process\nput two of them together throw in\ninteractions and you're getting an\nincreased order of magnitude on the\ncomplexity of what's going on\nso take it slow\nit's okay for things to be confusing and\nconflicting ain't no problem with that\nas you'll discover things will resolve\nthemselves over time\nand don't label things too quickly or\ndon't stick to those labels be flexible\naround you know what your interpretation\nof the relationship is\nyeah so someone saying had to deal with\ngood vibes only and no drama guys it's\nso annoying yeah so this is the other\nthing right so sometimes like people\nwill be like yeah i'm drama free\ni don't do drama and in adopting that\nstance\nthey create drama right because like\nthe thing is anytime you're going to\nhave two humans in an interaction\nthere's going to be some kind of\nconflict\nand like the way to be you can't be\ndrama free you can be like drama\nresistant\nso you can have like good methods of\nconflict resolution and like managing\ndrama or you can pretend to be\ndrama-free and just peace out anytime\nlike\nthe water gets a little bit rough\nand then what ends up happening is you\ndon't build like conflict resolution\nskills and you enter into your next\nrelationship looking for like drama-free\nstuff\nand then like you have dudes out there\nwho are looking for like drama-free\nstuff\nand like the reason they're looking for\nit so hard is and because there's so\nmuch drama everywhere because they're\ncreating it\nright\nlike\nyeah i'm not like looking for like\ni'm not looking for drama okay so like\nmanage it\nbro\nright and it's not just men like this\nhappens to women too and non-binary\npeople\ni'm judging everyone equally here\nbut like drama-free only works if you're\non an island and even then today we've\nseen posts where there's drama in your\nhead with yourself\nright so like if you're if there's like\nif you want to be drama free like\ndon't look to other people\ni'm not saying ignore other people\nbecause some people like said person\nwill attract drama\nbut recognize that you have a hand in\nthe drama and they have a hand in the\ndrama and if you want to live a\ndrama-free life don't worry about\nfinding people that are drama-free worry\nabout conflict resolution right and then\nthe way that you filter\npeople is based on their ability to\nparticipate in conflict resolution so\nthere's some people out there that can't\nparticipate in conflict resolution i.e\nthese people who say they're drama free\nbecause when you have a conflict with\nthem and you say hey i have this issue\nwith you can we talk about it and\nthey're like sorry i'm drama free this\nsounds like drama to me\ni'm out\nright that's who you want to avoid\nlike\nyou know so like be careful about drama\nfree like if you want to be drama free\nfocus on conflict resolution\nselect for people who can participate in\nconflict resolution and then you will\nhave a relatively drama free life\nthe key to a drama-free life is not the\npeople you select it's your capacity for\nconflict resolution\nyou"
