    "transcript": "and then like i go to sleep the next day\ni wake up i go to class and what do i\nfeel as i walk into the classroom that\nshame arises again and says hey go sit\nat the back\nand then suddenly that some scar is now\ncontrolling my behavior now i've made a\nshift in my personality and i go and sit\nat the back of the classroom so\ntoday we're going to talk a little bit\nabout personality and the interesting\nthing about personality is that we tend\nto view personality as static right and\nso we say like oh i am this way or i am\nthat way but there's actually\noverwhelming evidence that personality\nchanges over time so for example there\nare even things called personality\ndisorders which are when someone's\npersonality is so extreme in a\nparticular dimension that it interferes\nwith their ability to like form\nrelationships and be successful in life\nand so we actually diagnose it as a\npathological condition\nthe good news is that even if you have a\npersonality disorder it's treatable and\nchangeable right so you can like if you\nhave a personality disorder like if\nyou're a narcissist there are things\nthat you can learn and change about your\npersonality to shape it in the right\ndirection\nso today what i'm going to talk to you\nall about is how do we shape our\npersonality\nnow this is something that we're going\nto lean heavily on sort of the eastern\nperspective and i'm going to start by\nexplaining kind of why\nso western understanding of personality\ntends to be at a population level right\nso if we look at the best\nvalidated western scientific construct\nof personality it's the five factor\nmodel which divides personality into\nfive dimensions and you can assess\nsomeone's like\nlevel on each of these dimensions so how\nopen are they how agreeable are they how\nextroverted are they how conscientious\nare they so how neurotic are they so\nthose are like the five dimensions\nbut the thing about western personality\nanalysis is it's not individual so it's\nlike population based so what you could\nsay is that you can you know rank\nsomeone's neuroticism and you can say\nthis person is highly neurotic and you\ncan give them an individual you can give\na scenario and you can say okay how is\nthis person going to behave\nwhat are they going to how are they\ngoing to interact in this scenario and\nyou can't really make\na concrete behavioral prediction right\nyou can sort of say in general\nhighly neurotic people or highly\nagreeable people will behave this way\nversus low agreeable people are less\nlikely to behave that way so you're\ntalking about populations you're talking\nabout probabilities which is very good\nit's like kind of how western science\nworks\nbut\nit's not individual right so if you have\nhigh neuroticism\nhow you specifically behave and how to\nshape your individual personality\nis not something that western science is\nactually like an expert at because\nwestern science tends to look at the\npopulation level in averages right so\neven the model of the five factor model\nis to try to average out\na bunch of individuals to figure out\nwhat are these five characteristics that\nare like generally speaking applicable\nto everyone so it's a very\npopulation-based system\nso this is not\nand people may sort of assume for a\nmoment that that's the only way you can\ndo things right how can you measure\nthings at an individual level and like\nyou absolutely can that's literally what\nyou do as a clinician right so as a\nclinician i have all of this data about\npersonality and depression and\nepidemiology but at the end of the day\nan individual comes into my office and i\nhave to make individual decisions based\non their individual personality and try\nto help them move forward right so you\ncan have an evidence-based treatment\nthat works for a personality disorder\nbut once you get in the room with an\nindividual you have to apply that\ntreatment at a level that there's no\nthere's going to be no randomized\ncontrols trial that is going to teach\nyou\nwhat is going to work 100 for an\nindividual patient in your office\nthe eastern perspective on personality\nthough i think is far more applicable to\nan individual level and the reason for\nthat is because the yogis were like\nlooking at an n of one right they\nweren't studying external things they\nwere studying things internally so they\nasked the question how does my mind work\nright and they looked at what was going\non in their mind and so they had perfect\ninformation on one person\nbut questionable whether it applied to\nanyone else so we're going to use that\nmodel today so the way that we're going\nto understand how to shape our\npersonality has a few steps the first is\nthat we're going to talk a little bit\nabout what is personality how do we\ndefine personality like like literally\nwhat is it once we understand what it is\nwe can move on to okay so now that we\nknow what it is how does it get\nconstructed so like where does it come\nfrom\nonce we understand how it gets\nconstructed and where it comes from we\ncan start to make alterations in the way\nthat we are shaping our personality\nbecause now we understand how it gets\nput together so we can change how we put\nit together\nat this point we're going to talk a\nlittle bit about how most people shape\ntheir personalities and then an\nalternative to the way that most people\ndo it okay let me use some gaming\nanalogies there and then we'll hopefully\nleave you with sort of an idea of how\nyou can go about shaping your\npersonality in a particular direction\nand this this sort of makes sense\nbecause if you look at monks for example\nright so like people who are very\nspiritually adept they seem chiller they\nseem calmer they're more open to things\nthey're able to be like more resilient\nthere's all kinds of you know data we\ntalked about adhd and parenting the\nother day where we there was a study\nthat showed that mindful parenting\nreduces symptoms of child adhd and\nimproves like parenting behaviors and so\nif you kind of think about that like how\ndoes that work right like what's going\non in the mind of the person of the\nparent where you can teach them a\nparticular way of behaving which then\nover time will shape their personality\nwhich results in like all kinds of\nbenefits so you can absolutely adjust\nyour personality through essentially\nspiritual practices like meditation\nthings like that right maybe not\nspiritual anymore they're starting\nstarting to become scientific this is\nwhat the yogis did they like learned how\nto be like less reactive to stuff more\nopen to things um they're more motivated\nmore driven like more focused uh you\nknow they're able to control what they\neat so they shape all kinds of things\nabout themselves\nand so we're going to share that with\ny'all okay\nso the first\nis what is personality so how do we know\nwhether your personality is like\ndifferent from someone else's\npersonality right you are an individual\nyou have your own personality maybe\nyou've got a friend you've got a partner\nyou've got a parent you've got a sibling\nand they have a different personality so\nif i was an alien\nobserving people from space how would i\nfigure out whether two people have\ndifferent personalities or the same\npersonality right\nand so essentially what personality is\nis our individual way of reacting to a\nparticular scenario\nso if someone rings my doorbell do i you\nknow open it up right away or do i like\npeek through the window to see who it is\nso like people will do all kinds of\ndifferent behaviors\ngiven a common scenario the first day\nwhen i go to class where in the\nclassroom do i sit do i sit in the front\ndo i sit all the way in the back do i\nsit somewhere in the middle do i try to\nsit away from other people do i try to\nsit next to certain people how do i\nselect who i sit\nclose to right so all of these even if\nwe take an individual scenario\nand we present\n10 people with the same scenario it is\ntheir reaction to that scenario and how\nthey behave that shapes their\npersonality so my personality is a\ncombination of where i sit in the\nclassroom with what i do first thing in\nthe morning how i open the door to my\nhouse you know what i do when someone\ncuts me off when i'm driving you know\nlike how i relate to someone who is 15\nminutes late for a date that we're\nsupposed to be on so all of this\nconstellation of how i behave\nwith the outside world determines my\npersonality right\nand so like each of these individual\nthings i may overlap with some people in\nsome ways so for example\nat the very beginning of of my college\ncareer i started sitting at the front\nbecause i was a try-hard and up at the\nfront were all of the other tryhards and\nthen gradually over time as i started to\nfail my classes and stuff like that i\nstarted to sit towards the back because\nthen i was ashamed and i didn't answer\nany of the questions and i tried to\ndisappear into my seat most of the time\ni was in the class right and then\ntowards like medical school i sort of\nsat off to the side because i was just\nkind of like doing my own thing i'll let\nthe tryhards be in the front i'll let\nthe failures be in the back and i'm just\ngoing to be like chilling like doing my\nown thing on the side and then there\nwere the side sitters that came and\njoined me and we got along great right\nso there are these like shared\npersonality characteristics which you\ncan see in an individual scenario\nbut it's not like all the side sitters\nare also like all the door peekers right\nlike there's all kinds of different\nthey're not the same people as the road\nragers\nand so while there are shared\ncharacteristics essentially personality\nis the way that you respond to a\nparticular scenario and when we take all\nof the different ways that you respond\nor react or you're inclined to behave in\na particular scenario and we put them\nall together that is the personality\nthat is the individual you okay\nso then the question kind of becomes\nokay like where does the personality\ncome from right so if these are all your\nindividual reactions to particular\nscenarios how does your mind know how to\nbehave\nwhat is your in where does your\ninclination come from\nso this is where we're going to move to\na little bit of sunscreen okay\nso\nin\nso the yogis essentially came up with\na handful of terms to understand the\nmind okay\nso we talked about what is personality\nright\nso\nlet's just run through what we're going\nto talk about today\nso what is personality\nright it is a constellation\nof reactions\nto scenarios\nright it's the way that we interact with\nthe world\noh i see a little bit of lagging okay\nnext is\nyou know what are the components so like\nwhere does personality come from\nso then it kind of follows\nthat\nyou know like\nour reactions to scenarios are going to\nbe based on our experiences right\nso for example let's say i'm a front\nsitter so i walk into the classroom and\ni sit at the front and then i make an\nobservation\nthat if you're in the front you get\ncalled on a lot more\nas a result i get called on i don't know\nthe answer to a question i feel stupid\nand then what's gonna happen is i've\nbeen shaped a little bit right i've been\naltered i've had an experience that then\nmakes me now\nsit in the back\nright so suddenly like in that moment my\npersonality has been shaped okay\nso let's try to understand a little bit\nabout what are the components of the\nmind so how did the yogis sort of figure\nthis out\nthe first thing that they noticed is\nthat there are there's a part of the\nmind called the manus for those of you\nthat have watched dr k's guide you'll be\nvery familiar with this okay\nso the minus is the emotional mind\nand is judgmental\nso it's like reactive\nokay so for example\ndo you like pineapple on pizza some\npeople will say yes it's delicious some\npeople will say it is disgusting and it\nis it is the sin of the greatest\nmagnitude\nbut if you think a little bit about how\nyou determine whether you like whether\nyou like it or not is irrelevant let's\nthink a little bit about how you decide\nwhich camp you're in you take a bite of\nit and then some part of your being says\nyes this is amazing or oh this is awful\nright oysters are another good example\nof like some people are super into it\nsome people like this is slimy and cold\nand\noverly salty right\nso the monus is essentially our reactive\nmind that also experiences emotions\nbecause emotions are also reactive right\nso let's say that\nyou know i'm i walk into class one day\nand then someone asked me a question\nlike hey how did you sleep last night\nand then like i noticed everyone is\nlooking at me and they're like grinning\na little bit and it's like\nwhat on earth is going on right so i\nfeel a little bit embarrassed i don't\nunderstand what's happening logically\nbut my mind reacts to that scenario i\nrecognize that i'm the butt of the joke\nin some way there's something weird\ngoing on right so i'm on my guard i\nanswer very carefully so that that sort\nof emotional response\nis\nlike from the mana so it's like reactive\nit's sudden it's quick\nthe next thing is our ahamkar\nor our ego\nor sense of self\nokay so this is like our identity this\nis not a reaction\nit's not an emotion it is a sense of\nself it's also not logical or analytical\nit's just i believe i am this right so\nit's like an ego generally speaking the\nahamkar acts to protect you from things\nin the manus so when i'm feeling ashamed\nof myself my ego my my ego or sense of\nidentity will do something to actually\nalleviate that shame and sometimes it\ncan be kind of paradoxical\nright so i'll give you guys just a\nsimple example of this if i'm feeling\nlike i'm a bad person i'm ashamed of\nmyself\nthe ahamkar can actually tell me yeah\nyou deserve that because you're nothing\nyou know you don't deserve any love so\nif i like tell myself that i don't\ndeserve love\nthen i can't feel rejected because i\nnever should have gotten it in the first\nplace even though paradoxically\nit may seem like that is actually\nhurting you to determine your identity\nas someone who doesn't deserve love if\nyou really think about it it's actually\nreally good armor right so if it's a\npart of the natural order for you to not\nbe loved by another human being then\nlike life is far less painful because\neverything sort of makes sense there's\nlike no hope you're just like insulated\nfrom it right you start to become numb\nso ego can be kind of bizarre\nnext thing is a some scar\nso in the east\na constellation of some scars is our\npersonality so a samskar is\nsort of an impression in the mind\nthat\nis recalled\nin a particular scenario\nso it's like\nactivating programming okay in western\npsychology the closest thing is a schema\nfrom the cognitive behavioral\nuh realm\nso like for example\nyou know if i walk into the bathroom\nlike even if i've never been to that\nbathroom before let's say i'm at a\nrestaurant my mind knows how to operate\nthe toilet in the bathroom right and how\ndoes my mind know that it's because when\nit sees the bathroom it recalls\nparticular programming it says oh we\nneed to access bathroom.exe\nbut\nsome scars are not just that simple so\nthey also get to be quite complex so\nlet's say that i'm in a relationship\nwhere my partner has cheated on me and\nas a result of like my partner cheating\non me i start to become distrustful and\nthen when i start to get into the next\nrelationship and my partner is 15\nminutes late for a date\nlike\ncheating.exe or cheatingparanoia.exe\nstarts to activate and so these like\npent-up emotions from my past\nrelationship start to project and come\nout as malware in my current\nrelationship okay\nand so that's another example of a sum\nscar so we talk about some scars\noftentimes as like negative things\nbut they don't necessarily have to be\nnegative they're just programming in the\nmind\nokay\nso then if we think a little bit about\npersonality\npersonality is a collect uh oh gg\nokay that's okay we don't need it\nso if we think about a little bit about\nprogramming in the mind\nwe got to the sanskrit stuff which is\nthe important thing\nokay\nso we think about programming in the\nmind\nit's essentially like a collection of\nsome scars and then our collection of\nsome scars is our personality right\nbecause like when we respond to\ndifferent things in different ways\nwhether i'm a\na front sitter or a back sitter depends\non the some scar of\ngetting called on in class so when i get\ncalled on in class and i don't know the\nanswer that shame\nmake like makes an impression in my mind\ngoes dormant in my mind\nand then like sits around and then\nreactivates in particular scenarios okay\nso the way that we form some scars is\nessentially by improper digestion of\nexperiences so i'll give you guys just a\nsimple let's use that example okay so\nif i have\num\nso let's say i sit at the front of the\nclassroom and i get called on by my\nteacher\nand then like i don't know the answer so\nthen i feel ashamed of myself and then\nthere's like two different options at\nthat point right so i can sit i can\nprocess the shame and i can kind of talk\nto my friends about it i can talk to my\nparents about it whatever and if i have\nlike a supportive group and i share my\nfeelings and i work through it you know\nlike maybe my dad says something like\nwell you know like i understand that it\nwas embarrassing for you so you've got\nlike two choices right you can either\nstudy harder and therefore be prepared\nand get called on or what you can do is\nretreat to the back of the class you've\ngot either of those two options\nbut even understanding that you have\nthose two options involves a certain\namount of like processing and thinking\nabout your situation\nokay so most people as they go through\nlife don't really process and think\nthrough scenarios when they happen to\nthem right and generally speaking we're\nnot like actively processing stuff day\nin and day out as stuff happens to you\nin life you're not like sitting there\nand like reflecting on it on a daily\nbasis you just kind of get up and live\nyour day and you have an accumulation of\nexperiences\nas those experiences happen they tend to\ngo dormant right so let's say that\nthe school scenario again so i get\ncalled on and uh sitting in the front\nrow i feel ashamed of myself and then i\ngo home and i feel shame right i feel\nlike kind of crappy so what do i do do i\nsit there and think about it do i\nprocess it no i turn on a video game\nlog on to some kind of social media or\ncontent you know consumption website\nand my mind disappears into the void for\nlike four hours\nand then by then the shame is kind of\nlike calmed down some it hasn't been\nprocessed\nand then like i go to sleep the next day\ni wake up i go to class and what do i\nfeel as i walk into the classroom that\nshame arises again and says hey go sit\nat the back\nand then suddenly that some scar is now\ncontrolling my behavior now i've made a\nshift in my personality and i go and sit\nat the back of the classroom and then i\nfeel a little bit relieved because okay\nnow i won't be called on it's like not a\nbig deal\nas i leave class that day once again i\nkind of remembered like oh maybe i could\nhave like sat at the front maybe i\nshould have read yesterday\ninstead of playing video games but like\nthat kind of makes me feel guilty i go\nhome\ni'm feeling kind of guilty ah it's not\nthat big of a deal okay let me just play\ngames again so i play games again now i\ndon't feel even as prepared for school\nthe next day so the next day i go in i\nkind of like go sit in the back and then\nsuddenly i've lost\nright\nit's like\nmy personality has been altered the way\nthat i've reacted to situations has been\naltered\ni'm now starting to be controlled by\nsome of these behaviors like shame and\nguilt and stuff like that i'm starting\nto dig a hole for myself and it's kind\nof like gg\nright so the way that we actually live\nmost of our life is the way that most\npeople play video games so i know this\nsounds kind of weird but like if you\nthink about a competitive game\nso once you calibrate for example to a\nparticular mmr in a competitive game\nlet's call it overwatcher lol or dota or\nwhatever\nmost people historically if you look at\nmost of the player base they will stay\nat their particular skill for their\nentire lifespan right so like\n1500 mmr players will stay 1500 mmrs\nlike if you go to like if you play a\ngame of dota for example i just play\ndota but this is true of law or\noverwatch or call of duty or whatever if\nyou have a particular mmr there are\npeople who will have thousands of hours\nplayed\nand like will still suck at the game\nright and if you kind of think about\nthat\nit's kind of surprising like how can\nthousa how can you play for thousands\nand thousands and thousands of\nhours and like still suck at the game\nand like not get better\nand this is the other interesting thing\nis if you look at people who are at the\ntop of like let's say you look at the\nchallenger level in law or immortal rank\nand in dota or whatever right or like\ndiamond rank and starcraft or masters\nand starcraft or whatever game you want\nto\na lot of times they don't they haven't\nplayed more than like people who are\n5000 mmr below them right there does not\nappear to be thank you\nthere does not appear to be\na correlation between how many hours you\nplay and how good you are at the game\nso you can be a professional player\nright so like for example team spirit\none ti last year and i don't know how\nmany hours they've played dota but i can\nguarantee you that there are people who\nare 2000 mmr who have played the same\nnumber of hours of dota so what this\nsort of implies is actually something\nthat's quite staggering\nwhich is that\nmost of like when we play video games we\ndon't think about the game afterward\nright so how do we stay\nlow mmr despite thousands of hours of\nplay it's because we're like robots so i\nplay a game i like pick a random hero i\ndon't really like think about the game\nafter i don't watch my own replays\ni don't like process or\ncredit like you know think about what\ni'm doing critically i just queue up for\nthe next game i'm just kind of like on\nautopilot\nand as a result like i don't actually\nget better right so i'm not gonna\nimprove my personality at dota the way\nthat i react to scenarios in the game\ndoes not change because i'm not thinking\nabout them afterward so if i lose my\nlane i'm just going to go and tp there\nthree times and just continue to feed\ni'm not going to make any adjustments\nbecause i haven't been critical about\nthe way that i played the game\nand it actually happens to be exactly\nthe same way in real life right so as i\ngo through negative experiences\ni don't actually process or think\ncritically about how i'm like what's\ngoing on here right\ni just sort of like autopilot it and so\ni say the same damn mmr we start to\nthink about personality is static\nand then we like just live our lives\nwith this personality right so then we\nassign labels to ourselves we say i'm\nlazy\ni'm not a morning person\nright i just can't do that i can't\nhandle parties\ni'm like\ni'm just not like i am not like that and\nso you start to define things about\nyourself which then start to doom you\nright because now like if you're lazy\nlike gg noob like what can you do you\ncan try to biohack your way to whatever\nyou want to but like laziness plus all\nthese and this is why the biohacking\nlife hacking industry is so big it's\nbecause people assign themselves with a\npersonality attribute\nthat is static and then like since\nthat's unchangeable i need to use some\nkind of like broken op technique to\nbypass my core personality\nright that's like that's why this\nindustry is so big it's because you\ndon't need to change\nyou just need to take this herbal\nsupplement and your life will transform\nright\nso then the question becomes but like\ncan we gain mmr in a game of dota in in\nthe game of dota and the answer is\nabsolutely yes we can gain mmr right we\ncan think about what we do we can\nreflect on what we can do\nwe can start to be intentional about how\nwe behave how we react to experiences\nis actually not step away from\nintentional intentionality of action for\na second but how we react and process\nand digest experiences\nwill result in mmr gains right so if i\nlose my lane i go watch the replay and i\nrealize okay this is a scenario where i\ndid a and i should have done b\nso if i learn from that mistake then my\nmmr will increase a little bit\nand the interesting thing is that is\nabsolutely true in real life so the\nfirst group of people who did this were\nthe yogis i mean maybe there were other\npeople i don't you know i don't know the\nancient history of africa for example so\nthere may have been people who predated\nthe yogis there but generally speaking\nyou know yoga is about five to six\nthousand years old so like you know\n3000 4000 bc or bce\nyou know like people were figuring this\nout and essentially what even now we\nsort of get this right we have a class\nof people\nlike monks or yogis who we sort of\nassume are like in control of their crap\nright they're able to like wake up at\n4am every day and like meditate for\nthree hours and like do yoga they're\nable to like not be tempted by sexual\ndesires not be tempted or be able to\nresist their sexual desires be able to\nresist dietary desires be like be like\nnon-monetary things like that so we have\nyogis out there who are like capable of\ncontrolling all this crap\nand we look at them and we're like you\nknow that that person does that because\nthey're a monk right that's their job\nbut if you really think about it now the\nway that they react to scenarios is\nis transformed drastically\nbecause you had someone who used to\nreact this way this way this way this\nway\nand now the way they react to all those\nscenarios has changed a lot so\nessentially what they've done is altered\ntheir personality right they've\nliterally changed the way that they\nreact to scenarios therefore that\nbecomes a personality alteration\nand so then\nif we kind of stop and think about it\nfor a second like there's a way they did\nthat right they consistently do that\nthis is a profession that consistently\ntrains people\nto alter the way they react to scenarios\nso this is like a group of super high\nmmr people right this is like an\nin-house league that only has immortal\nplayers\nso what i want to share with y'all today\nis essentially like how to do that right\nand it turns out to be actually\nrelatively simple\nso if you want to start shaping your\npersonality instead of focusing on what\nyou do right so this is what everyone\nfocuses on they focus on the behavior\nthey're like how do i wake up early in\nthe morning\nhow do i study more how do i do this\nthis is my problem this is my problem\nthis is my problem they're always\nfocused on the problem and looking\nforward\ninstead what you need to do is look at\nyour reactions to things\nright so\nif i lose a game of dota i'm thinking\nhow do i win the next game how what\nshould i pick and you guys may have\nfallen into this trap where you get\ncrushed by a particular hero you're like\nthat hero is so freaking op i'm gonna\npick that hero i'm gonna win the game\nit's gonna be easy i'm always looking\nforward how do i fix this problem how do\ni fix this our entire society is like\nbased on fixing problems right oh we've\ngot this thing that will help you fix\nyour problem we've got this biohack here\nyou know we're trying to fix this we're\ntrying to fix this is always moving\nforward how do we increase quarterly\nprofits how do we increase how do we\nsign bigger deals how do we have more\ncustomers how do i get a raise how do i\nget promoted it's always like looking\nforward how to do better better better\nbetter better better\nso what we don't look at\nis the way we react we react to things\nand this is how we get stuck right so\nwhat happens in the game of dota if i\nget crushed by a particular hero and i\npick that hero because that hero's opie\ni lose\nright and then but hold on a second but\nlike that hero is so op\nright so i need to be less lazy i need\nto start drinking this supplement and\nthen my life will transform\nyou're always looking forward and so\nyour personality doesn't shape it\ndoesn't change because how is\npersonality shaped personality is not\nshaped by what you do is shaped by how\nyou react\nto particular scenarios it is your\ndefault response two things and if you\ncan change your default response to\nthings your life will transform\ni kid you not let's go back to the the\nperson who sits at the front of the\nclassroom answers a question in a\nparticular way\nthey get the question wrong they feel\nashamed of themselves and remember\nthere's two options right\nso on the one hand i can\nit's okay screw this i'm gonna avoid the\nscenario i'm gonna sit at the back\noption number one or wow like this\nreally felt bad i feel ashamed of myself\nhow am i going to react to that i'm\nactually going to make sure i study\ntomorrow i'm going to study tonight so\nthat tomorrow whenever i get asked a\nquestion i'm going to be ready for it\nand if you think about these two people\nyou say that these two people have\ndifferent personalities i wish i had\nthat other personality i wish when life\nyou know when i lost a game of dota i\nlearned from my mistake and went into\nthe next game like prepared to do even\nbetter i wish that when i did poorly in\nlife when i got dumped by a boyfriend or\ngirlfriend that\ni reacted stronger so that i would be\nlike a stronger human being instead of\nresentful in my next relationship right\nthis is what we wish and what we all\nfocus on is how do i be healthier in my\nnext relationship how do i find a\nsuccessful relationship this is the\nother problem that we run into with\nrelationships\nis that when we have a bad relationship\nwe go and look for the perfect partner\nright we look for a partner who will\nlike be less this way and more this way\nand so you end up with online dating\nprofiles where everyone is looking for\nlike the perfect thing they're like oh\nnow i have access to the internet which\nhas like a hundred thousand people on it\nso let me list out all of my\nrequirements and as long as i find the\nright person i'm looking for mr right\ni'm looking for mrs wright right all the\ngood ones are taken they're not\navailable anymore what i want is not\navailable it's out of stock\nbut instead what they should be doing is\nif this particular person if this\nrelationship didn't go well\nwhat was my contribution to it and this\nis why people like it's so hard to date\nonline right now is because people have\nstopped being like self-reflective like\npeople are just like instead of changing\nmyself at all what i'm looking for is\nlike some weird\nyou know frankenstein's monster or\nchimera of like different pieces of\nthings that is assembled into the\nperfect human that i want and i'm\nlooking for that thing and then like the\nproblem is that you may have found that\nthing but that thing may not want to\ndate you because have you done any kind\nof self-reflection\nand so if we want to shape our\npersonality it's not about fixing the\nproblem\nit's about looking at how we react to\nparticular scenarios because that's the\ntraining of a monk the core training of\na monk is to look at their reactions to\nthings\nright it's to eat something that they\nfind tasty or not tasty and study your\nreaction to a particular thing\nas you process that reaction as you work\nthrough that reaction you will be free\nof that personality change\nnow there is an overwhelming amount of\nevidence that this is successful forget\nabout monks for a second let's go to\nactual let's go back to science so the\npractice of clinical psychotherapy is\nessentially a formalized process of this\nokay so when someone comes into my\noffice with a personality disorder this\nis an aspect of their personality which\nthrough\nhelping them change the way that they\nreact and study the way that they react\ni can actually like help them over the\ncourse of a year or two no longer become\nnarcissistic and if you think about that\nlike how on earth does that work and\nwhat literally happens is someone will\ncome in and they'll say\nyou know christmas was a mess and i'll\nsay what happened well like someone like\ndidn't like they invited me but like\nthey didn't even think to ask me about\nmy dietary restrictions\nand i'm kind of confused i'm like okay\nwell like you know they're your parents\ndon't they know your dietary\nrestrictions like why would they need to\nask you about them they're like well i\ndecided to go vegan three months ago and\nthey like didn't ask about that\nit's like okay so your parents are 72\nyou're 41\nand you're upset because your parents\ndidn't think to ask about dietary\nrestrictions\nright like\ni'm confused but that's what the\nnarcissistic person thinks they're like\ni've made such a big change you know\nthey didn't even think to ask about it\nand so i went there and there was like\nno vegan food\nand and so i you know i'm kind of\nconfused but like this is the mind of a\nnarcissistic person\nso as we sit there and we sort of think\na little bit about okay so like what's\nyour expectation\nright like what do you think they should\ndo like at what interval should they ask\nyou if you've made dietary restrictions\nright and if you start to like ask these\nkinds of questions it's it's quickly\nbecomes absurd\nthat you know your parents are gonna ask\nyou like what once every three months\nonce a year by the way if you decided to\ngo vegan like\nyou know people don't do that but in the\nmind of a narcissistic person they don't\nsort of realize that right so like their\nreaction to this scenario is to feel\nhurt and this in turn has to do with\ntheir ahm god and prior some scars\nbecause remember narcissism itself is a\nconsequence of some scottish and am god\nso this person wasn't born narcissistic\nthey became narcissistic that way\nso somewhere along the way people either\nneglected their needs or they had a\nparent who was narcissistic right so\nlike the parent was like always blaming\nother people for like not asking them\nquestions or whatever so you can start\nto like look at how that reaction formed\nso in clinical psychotherapy what you\nessentially do\nis show people how they react to\nscenarios\nand as you focus on how you react to a\nscenario you start to alter your own\nperceptions you start to alter your\npersonality literally and you start to\nchange the way that you you behave it\nbecomes automatic right so and this is\nthe kind of thing if you guys have\nplayed video games you understand this\nlike if i do replay analysis of my own\nthing and i make a conclusion right i\nrealize oh i should have done this i\nshould have done this i should have done\nthis the next time i go into a game\nthat learning is gonna be like operating\nin the background and it's gonna\nautomatically shape my behavior right\nit's like if i decide oh i didn't buy\nenough regen in lane\nit's like oh crap so the next time like\ni just go into the game i buy more regen\ni walk into the lane and then like the\nproblem has solved itself\nit's like and this is the most shocking\nthing that i think people don't realize\neveryone thinks fixing problems is hard\nand it's like yes fixing problems is\nhard but what's way easier is actually\nfixing yourself\nand then the problems downstream become\nlike easy to solve because you yourself\nhave changed your default mode of\noperation has changed your personality\nhas changed so how do you do that\nit comes down to studying your reactions\nthis is the biggest issue is we're so\nfocused on fixing the problem that we're\nnot looking at how we react to things so\nnow i know it sounds kind of like super\nsimple\nbut focus on your reaction so in a\nparticular situation this is like you\nknow we're gonna teach all of meditation\nright so\nconsider a scenario and like when you go\ninto the scenario just notice yourself\nokay i want you to pay attention to your\nheartbeat pay attention to your pulse\npay attention to your you know your\nbreathing rate whether you're sweating\nwhether you're relaxed whether you're\nlike you know whatever is going on just\npay attention to yourself and notice\nwhat your mind or your body is telling\nyou right so it's saying don't sit at\nthe front don't sit at the front don't\nsit at the front so the first step is to\nnotice something okay\nthe next step is to play the tape\nthrough to the end so as you sit down\nand you kind of think about it i want\nyou to like this is tricky because\nfears\ndon't live up under scrutiny okay so the\nway that you kind of like overcome this\nis like if your mind is telling you\nlike okay if we sit at the front\ndon't sit at the front front is bad\nthat's gonna be an instinctive reaction\nit comes from the manus okay you're\ngonna say don't sit at the front and so\ninstead your mind is like okay let's go\nsit at the back and so play the tape\nthrough to the end so ask yourself what\nwill happen if i sit in the front and\nthen your mind will be like we don't\nwant to get called on\nand then\nyou know like you'll think okay so like\nwhat will happen if we get called on\nwell we're not going to know the answer\nwell hold on a second like we may know\nthe answer right we may know the answer\nwe may not know the answer but in our in\nour mind that fear assumes that we don't\nknow the answer so it's kind of like\nbizarre right so like now we're being\nshaped by a possibility it's not even a\nprobability like there's eight people in\nthe front row they the teacher asked us\nyesterday there's actually a decent\nchance we won't get asked at all\nso play the tape through the end okay if\nwe get asked the question what maybe we\nknow the answer maybe we don't know the\nanswer okay what's the consequence of\nnot knowing the answer well i'm gonna\nfeel stupid\nare you gonna\nget a bad grade no\nwell i'm gonna feel dumb\nokay\nso what\nwell i don't like to feel dumb okay\nso like\nare you willing to like give it a shot\nlike let's just see what happens let's\nlike see just pay attention and so like\nwhen you combat that fear like at the\nend of the day you're going to kind of\nhit up that fear of like i don't want to\nfeel dumb\nand now you've got two options so if i\nknow it sounds kind of bizarre but even\ndoing this amount of study may be enough\nfor you to sit at the front of the\nclassroom\nand if you do get called on and you\ndon't know the answer notice your\nreaction to that and just tell yourself\nokay this is an experiment that like\nwe're gonna sit at the front we're gonna\nsee what happens\nthis is not a game that i'm trying to\nwin\nthis is a game that i'm trying to learn\nright which is how do you climb mmr you\nplay games not to win necessarily you\nplay games sometimes to learn like i'm\ngoing to try this thing with\nintentionality i'm going to try to buy\nmore regen in lane and i'm gonna see\nwhat happens\nright so whether you win the game or you\nlose the game suddenly you've created\nsome degree of detachment from the\noutcome of the game because you know\ngoing in that this could be rough\nbut you're gonna learn a lot more and\nyou'll actually shape a scar\nand you'll alter your personality as a\nresult you'll learn\nright and so let even if that happens\ni i would say that you know 85 chance in\nthis scenario that your worst fears are\nnot realized like i know it's kind of a\ncompletely arbitrary percentage but\ngenerally speaking the fears that we\nhave in our mind are not realized if we\nbehave with intention what we realize is\nthat like our fears are way worse in our\nmind than usually what reality is\nand so even if we do get called on then\njust like notice your reaction you'll be\namazed that like what you sort of\nrealize is like actually doesn't affect\nmy grade in fact now that i feel stupid\nlike i i feel either like distracting\nmyself or studying so now i've got a\nchoice\ndo i want to distract myself or do i\nwant to study well i actually kind of\nwant to study like i want to feel good\ntomorrow when i sit in the class i want\nto feel good about like being prepared\nto answer questions\nright and then so like it's kind of\nbizarre but that's like literally how\nyou change your personality by studying\nthe reaction you will naturally start\ngravitating towards the right thing\nbecause here's the thing sitting at the\nback of the class\nis actually a strategy to feel good\nabout yourself\nright so like this is the big thing\nabout you know altering your personality\nis that through studying your own\nreactions what you can do is essentially\nfeel the same way but in a more\nsuccessful manner so if the goal is to\nfeel good about myself because that's\nwhy i'm sitting in the back of the class\nright i don't want to feel bad about\nmyself\nif i one day make the discovery and this\nis done through studying your reactions\nthat i can sit at the front of the\nclassroom and feel even better\nthan what i could if i sat at the back\nof the classroom if i'm prepared for\nclass and i know the right answer\nit feels amazing it actually feels\nbetter than sitting at the back of the\nclassroom\nthen suddenly what i've done is i've\nchanged something very important because\nall of our avoidance strategies are\nthere to help us right they're there to\nhelp us avoid pain and feel good about\nourselves but if i suddenly have a\nstrategy that allows me to feel good\nabout myself and even feel better than\nsitting at the back of the classroom\nthen i'm gonna actually start picking\nthat strategy and i know it sounds kind\nof weird but i'm gonna start studying\nmore i'm gonna start preparing for class\nand once you make that shift things\nbecome way easier in your life because\nnot only do you feel better about\nyourself but you are starting to be\nobjectively more successful because\nyou're making better decisions\nand so shaping your personality\nultimately comes down to\nunderstanding your reactions to things\nand playing the tape through to the end\nand studying as you make an intentional\nchange in the world\nstudying what you're how your reaction\nchanges and as you keep doing this over\nand over and over again whether it be\nthe narcissistic person in psychotherapy\nwho's sort of like studying their\nreaction playing the tape through what\ndoes it truly mean okay like\nhow would it feel to tell people that\nyou're vegan next time\noh it actually feels totally fine oh\nit's actually easier than like not\ntelling them and then throwing a fit\nafterward and so essentially what what\nhappens with narcissistic people is they\ndiscover that not being narcissistic is\nactually the more winning strategy so\nthey stop being narcissistic once they\nsort of internalize and truly realize\nthat this is not working well right\nand so in that same way if you want to\nshape your personality don't focus on\nfixing the problem\nfocus on studying your reaction and then\nplaying the tape through to the end and\nthen your third step is going to be\nimplementing an intentional experiment\nwhere you're like watching your reaction\nto that thing and as you start doing\nthis i guarantee your mmr in real life\nwill start to climb\nquestions\nsomeone's asking does dbt work for\nnarcissism i'm going to go ahead and say\nsure\nso i think that dbt involves a\na component to mindfulness right which\nlike the is rooted in meditation in the\nyogic tradition and the yogic tradition\nwas like a cure for narcissism\nso you're going to get some deluding\neffects because dbt is specifically\nfocused on bpd so the mindfulness\npractices are like you know\ngeared towards\nbpd as opposed to narcissism but there\nare some good effects\nso i have a different like meditation\nregimen for\nnarcissism than dvt\nokay so there's good questions here the\nfirst is how do i change things i can't\ncontrol like impulsive emotions\nso\nnowhere have i said that you should\nchange your behavior right so you don't\nneed to control impulsive emotions\nwhat you need to do is pay attention to\nyour reactions\nso once i have an impulsive emotion\nthere's going to be a reaction that\nresults in a behavior like you can't\ncontrol the emotion that's the whole\npoint of like understanding the manas is\nthat you can't control the manas like\nyou can't control whether you like\npineapple on pizza or you don't like\npineapple on pizza\nso your initial response to things is\nnot something that you can control\nwhat you can adjust is your reactivity\nto that initial thing\nso when i walk into the room if i have a\nsome scar that makes me feel like an\nidiot every time i walk into a classroom\ni cannot control that some scar\nthe some scar the programming will\nactivate right i'll walk into the\nclassroom i'll feel like an idiot what i\ncan control though is the way that i\nreact to that stimulus\nso i can pay attention i can take a deep\nbreath i can engage in physiology right\nso check out breath and mind and dr k's\nguide if you guys haven't\nso you can like take a deep breath and\nyou can say okay we're going to sit at\nthe front it's going to be terrifying so\nbe it let me go and sit at the front\nterror here we come\nand then you can't control the terror\nlike you're going to feel terror as you\nsit down in the front seat you're gonna\nbe like sweating okay we're gonna\nbreathe we're gonna breathe and then\nyou're gonna realize oh my god\ni've survived i did it success good job\nso you can control the way that react\nyou react to things but not your initial\nthing\nnot your initial response to something\nokay\ncan you back up your claims with science\nyeah so like\nthis is kind of interesting right so\nlike\ni mean these things are so\nso like you can look at the clinical\nefficacy of any paper on dbt and\nborderline personality disorder\nright like if you want to see the\nclinical like the scientific\nresponse to this you can also look at\nthings like mbt\nand bpd or narcissism so there's like\ntons of research out there about\npsychotherapy for personality disorders\nwhich shows that it's effective there's\ntons of research out there about\nyou know five factor model so i would\nstart with like honestly just wikipedia\nand just like look at some of the\nreferences for the five factor model\nright and then if you actually go and\nyou talk to someone who like studies\nfive factor model like and you ask them\nbased on five factor can you predict how\nan individual will respond in a scenario\nthey will say no i cannot\nthey can give you a general idea that\nthese kinds of people are more likely to\nrespond this way so this is like super\nfundamental stuff\nyeah where's my phone\nuh i think it's in the\nin the where my wallet is\num\nokay\nhow much does this help getting past\nmental disabilities\ni'm not quite sure so generally speaking\ni think this is independent of mental\ndisabilities so like i don't think it's\nmental disabilities apply at all\nunless your disability has something to\ndo with your ability to observe yourself\nso the key thing here is that you need\nto be able to observe your reaction to\nthings and if you have difficulty doing\nthat like that may be a slow road to\nclimb right\nso a good example of this is if you have\nvery very high emotional reactivity you\nmay not be able to do this react\nstudying your reaction to things like\nvery easily so you may just have to\nstart with like smaller things right so\nyou need to grind on weak mobs before\nyou start to tackle the bigger stuff\num\ndoesn't being critical to oneself breed\nanxiety sure\nso there's a key thing\ni'm not saying be critical right so\ncritical is a judgment\nwe're not talking about being critical\nwe're talking about observation\nso and you're correct that being\ncritical breeds anxiety because like\nthen you're beating yourself up and you\nfeel bad about yourself and you're\nworried but observation actually breeds\nthe opposite right so critical is to\nbeing critical is to make a judgment is\nto like conclude something but our\nobservation is not making a conclusion\nit's just making an observation we're\nactually super hands off we're just\ngonna see what happens\nand so by adopting that non-judgmental\nerror we actually reduce anxiety so you\nare correct that being critical\ncan breed anxiety but we're not being\ncritical we're being observational we're\nstudying our reaction\nright\nso it's actually very different and this\nis it's a really good question because\noftentimes when we are self-reflective\nwe default to a critical mode\nright when i study myself all i can see\nis criticisms\ni'm not truly observational i'm very\nharshly self-judgmental\nthat too\nis part of a hum god and a samskar\nbecause i've decided somewhere along the\nway that like i'm someone who like\nisn't perfect and i can always be better\ni can always be better i can always be\nbetter and if that is your identity\nof never being satisfied never being\nperfect and never being enough then any\nkind of reaction that you have to\nyourself which you're not even aware of\nit becomes so automatic right because\nthen you're beating yourself up it's\nlike simple so like it happens like that\noh i could have done this better i could\nhave done this but i'm so stupid\nthis person is better than i am that\nperson is better that's not studying\nyourself it's being self-critical\nthat's the activation of the some squad\nit's not actually like observing the the\nsamskara it's within the some scar if\nthat makes sense\nso like the right thing to do if you're\nhyper critical is to observe yourself\nand just ask yourself\nwhy am i being so critical of myself\nhere where do i get the idea that like i\nyou know i everyone is better than me\nlike where does that come from\nso like play the tape through to the end\nlike ask yourself why why why why until\nyou'll get to something at the you know\nat the bottom\nand this is the kind of thing that you\nknow if you work with a therapist or\ncoach or something like that like they\nwill help you get there faster\ntherapists aren't really trained in this\nmodel but they do the same work\nokay\num\nokay\nokay so this is a great question so\ny'all are asking good questions that are\nsort of missing the point how do we\ntrust that our analysis of our reactions\nis correct\ngreat question\nso remember the first step is not your\nanalysis of your reaction\nbut it's the observation of the reaction\nand is the observation of the reaction\nif done with that like properly right so\njust\nso like you know how do you know if your\nobservation is correct it just is an\nobservation the analysis is what comes\nafterward right so like science doesn't\nlie but interpretations are very\ncritical so you're correct that analysis\nneeds to be done at some point\nbut make sure that you understand\nclearly that the first step is just data\ncollection it's just observe your\nreaction notice your reaction\nas you play the tape through to the end\nyou know be aware so here's like one tip\nwhich is how emotional or numb do you\nfeel\nif you feel calm when you are doing your\nanalysis then it is likely that your\nanalysis is more correct if you feel\nemotional it is unlikely that your\nanalysis will be correct here's another\ntricky thing here's the thing that trips\neveryone up if you feel numb when you do\nyour analysis it is unlikely to be\ncorrect\nso numbness\nis a sign of like a high level of\nemotion that is present but is\nsuppressed so it'll be shaping your your\nanalysis quite heavily this is the big\nproblem that people run into when they\nthink they are hyperlogical\nis that they're they're not like it's\nnot like their limbic system their\nemotional cortex of their brain is like\nnon-functional right it's just being\nsuppressed but it's still shaping their\nthoughts\nso the key thing to understand about\nanalysis is you want your mind to be\ncalm and balanced\nwhich is what tends to happen when you\nguys watch our interviews and stuff when\npeople have this like emotional\ncatharsis there's a high level of\nemotion which we then process right we\ndecompress it we don't numb it out and\nthen afterward people are left in a\nspace of mind where they like have a\nrealization and so then you know your\nanalysis is correct\ncan you lose some scars the scheme is\ndue to a stressful amend have in mind\nptsd absolutely right so ptsd is\nactually the one diagnosis in the west\nthat perfectly overlaps with the eastern\nconcept of the mind\nso this is true right like so the mind\nworks in one way and so i think good\nevidence that this is correct is that\nthe western path of exploration\ndiscovered ptsd the eastern path of\nexploration essentially discovered the\nsame thing so you have two independent\ninvestigators that are arriving at the\nsame conclusion so what is ptsd i have a\nparticular event that happens which has\na powerful impact on me which does not\nget processed or digested\nand then sits in my mind and then arises\nin particular scenarios right this is\nwhy people have flashbacks they have\nnightmares they have hypervigilance when\nthey have ptsd their mind is on\nconstantly on the lookout for like the\nsource of danger so now our personality\nhas almost altered right the way that we\nreact to scenarios has changed\nand so that's what ptsd is and the good\nnews is that there are treatments for\nptsd right you can do psychotherapy\nwhich is literally the process of like\nbringing up some of these things and\nemotionally digesting them and then you\ncan no longer have ptsd you can be cured\nof it\nso ptsd is actually a really really good\nexample of the fact that some scars can\nbe cleansed\nand if you look at that in in the yogic\nprocess right so like that's a big part\nof it so as people you know go and do\nspiritual study and stuff like all this\nkind of stuff comes up so for me for\nexample like i originally went to you\nknow india to become a monk out of ego\nbecause i sucked at real life i was\nsuper low mmr and i was like oh cool\nlike instead of sucking at this game i'm\ngonna go play this game and then like\ni'm gonna tell everyone that my game is\nbetter than their game so the way that\ni'm gonna feel better\nabout myself is to become a monk and\nthen all these materialistic noobs that\nget better grades than i do i'm gonna be\nbetter than them because my game is more\nimportant than the their game law is for\nnoobs and dota is for experts so i'm\ngoing to get good at dota because i suck\nat lol and then i'm going to lord it\nover all the law noobs for playing la la\nla la right so that's what happened in\nmy mind and as i went through this\nprocess i uncovered that i was like holy\ncrap\nthis is all ego like the reason i'm\nbecoming a monk is out of ego it's like\nthe fundamentally like wrong decision\nso you can sort of discover that your\nsome scars are like there through\nspiritual practice and then you can go\nthrough the process of digesting them so\ni realized this i was like oh crap like\ni suck at life so that's when i decided\nlike okay so using a calm and collected\nmind i was like\nif i become a monk to run away from my\nproblems that will be running away\nso instead what i need to do to really\nbecome a monk is i need to stop\npretending to be a monk go and succeed\nin the real world\nso i have to go back and like i need to\nbe the best damn student that ever could\nbe because that's where i suck so i have\nto like focus on the things that i'm bad\nat so i ended up going back and like\nstill lazy right so but the way that i\nreacted to things changed\nthe way that i've like approached school\nchanged my personality changed whereas i\nused to run away from things and i\nstarted like embracing them right i\nunderstood it was gonna be hard i didn't\nget a 4.0\ni didn't like come back transform that's\nthe other thing is people like assume\nyou come back and you're like\ntransformed and then suddenly you're\ngetting four points no like my first\nsemester back i got like a 3.0\n3.2 3.4 every semester i got a little\nbit better a little bit better a little\nbit better graduated with a 2.5\nso be it\nright i'm not gonna let like i noticed\noh well like this sucks okay so like i'm\ngonna acknowledge that it sucks i'm\ngonna notice my reaction and i'm gonna\ntake the right steps forward\nirrespective of how i feel\nand that's when your personality changes\nright so then i got into medical school\nat tufts\ndid that for a while you know noticed\nsome ego at the beginning of that and i\nwas like okay i need to step aside from\nthat\njust going to focus on doing what i need\nto do\nnotice my reactions to things\ndecide how how much i'm going to study\nironically i didn't like try to be the\nbest in my class because i was like\nthat's ego\ni'm here to learn medicine so i'm going\nto study what i'm capable of okay i\ncan't study for eight hours a day so i\ncan study for like two three hours a day\nthat's the most i'm capable of and\ninstead of sort of assuming that that\nmeans oh god i'm gonna fail it's like\nokay like let's see what happens let's\nobserve what happens if i can study for\ntwo hours a day can i optimize that\nstudying for two hours and can it be\nenough can i pass\nturns out i can do way better than pass\nright so then it's bizarre like using\nthat kind of strategy ending up with\nlike an award of academic achievement at\nthe end of medical school\nand so\nfirst academic achievement award i've\ngotten after a string of like c's and\nd's and\nf's and crap like that\nright\nso just focus on your reactions\nunderstand yourself and then you will\nnaturally start to move in the right\ndirection\nand you can absolutely alter ptsd and\nyou can absolutely alter\nlike you can alter it\nright\nthat's the whole point of this lecture\nis that that which you assume you are\ncan be changed and the way to change it\nis to understand your reactions\nbecause your reactions and how you\nprocess\nthat individual moment is going to form\nhow you behave tomorrow\nso pay attention to your reactions\ni'm going to give y'all one last story\nabout this okay\nso i had a\num\na patient\nwho\n[Music]\nwhose mom\nwas in an abusive relationship\nso mom and dad dad was abusive\nmom and dad divorce\nuh mom\nis a way to process all of these like\ndifficult emotional things\nstarted going to church\nand then became like hyper religious so\nlike her entire personality like changed\nover the course of like\nfive to seven years\nand then my patient had all kinds of\nproblems because mom would like pressure\nthem to go to church all the time\nbecause for mom church was like there\nfor her and was her source of like\ncomfort and safety and salvation when\nshe was going through a really really\nhard time\nand so then suddenly like for mom the\nworld became a dangerous place where\nlike there are like people out there who\ndon't have morals who will do to you\nwhat your dad did to me\nbut in the church i found safety and so\nshe became super paranoid for her\ndaughter\nand was like you need to go to church\nlike don't date anyone outside of church\nyou need to go to church like church is\nthe only safe place\nright that's basically like what her mom\nkind of like she didn't realize that\nlike consciously\nbut that's what through therapy we sort\nof uncovered and once like daughter\nunderstood this she was like okay like\nthis was the way that my mom survived\nthis experience this is how she's\nchanged and shaped\nlike she's been altered by this and\nchurch was like kind of there for her\nright so that's an example of a powerful\nsome scar forming\nand as a result a personality change\nand then like that personality views the\nrest of the world as dangerous except\nthere's one safe space\nand so of course she's gonna push her\ndaughter to like be in that safe space\nbecause she doesn't want her daughter to\never end up in a relationship like she\nshe had\nand so once daughter understood that\nwhen she understood where she's coming\nfrom like that started to like she\nstarted to get a lot better she\nunderstood you know why her mom was so\npushy for church she was able to set\nboundaries with her mom in a much\nhealthier way now that she understood\neverything and then her own reactions\ntowards her mom started to change her\nown reactions towards church and like\nnot church and things like that started\nto change\nso personality can absolutely be altered\nit comes from understanding your\nreaction\nokay\nyou"
