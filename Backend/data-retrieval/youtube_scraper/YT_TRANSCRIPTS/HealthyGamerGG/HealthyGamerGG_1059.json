    "transcript": "all right\nso let's talk about\nadhd and parenting so chat question\nnumber one what is the relationship\nbetween adhd and parenting\nso let me put it to you this way\nokay\nso if i have adhd\nif child has adhd\nwhat effect does that have on the parent\nand if\na parent\nhas a particular style\ndoes that affect\nthe adhd in the kid\nright these are kind of the two\nquestions so like what's the\nrelationship between adhd and parenting\nand the reason that we're going to talk\nabout this today is because i think that\nwhen we think about illnesses\nwe tend to think about them in isolation\nbut the interesting thing is that\nthey're not really isolated right so\nthere's a lot about adhd and people\ny'all may be surprised by sort of what\nwe discover we're going to cover a lot\nof different literature today\nbut it's really challenging for parents\nto have a child with adhd so i think\nthis is something that is like under\nappreciated that like how hard it is to\nbe a parent with a child with adhd and\non the flip side how hard it is to be a\nchild with adhd\nwho has a parent that doesn't understand\nwhat your needs and cognitive like\nlimitations or cognitive preferences are\nand how that can lead to a lot of\nnegative impacts in the household\nso we're going to start off by so the\ngoal of today's lecture is to just\nexplore the relationship between adhd\nand parenting okay\nso we're going to start off by kind of\ndefining adhd so sure there's like the\ndsm the diagnostic and statistical\nmanual there's things like the icd-11\nwe're not going to worry about that kind\nof stuff\nokay so what we're going to talk about\nis like practically what is adhd like\nhow do you know if you have it if you're\na parent out there what are the signs\nthat you're going to see in your child\nthat should make you think a little bit\nabout adhd and even if they don't have a\nclear diagnosis of it if they have these\ntendencies\nthen it may be worthwhile to like\nunderstand some of the stuff later in\nthe lecture even without a diagnosis\nright so remember that adhd is attention\nis a spectrum\nright so we have like a spectrum of\nattention\nand so wow that's a terrible bell curve\nso let me just fix that\nand so even though like we may say that\nif your attention is in this area this\nis what we qualify as clinical adhd if\nyour child is within this window\nwe still can you know this lecture is\nstill going to be useful for people over\nhere the other thing that's going to be\nkind of interesting is a lot of stuff\nthat we're talking about even if you're\nnot a parent but if you have a\nsignificant other who has adhd a lot of\nstuff that we're going to be talking\nabout today will be like really relevant\nso if you're up if your partner has adhd\nand you're trying to figure out okay\nlike how should i like interact with\nthem how should i relate to them what\nshould be the home environment like\nthere are things like that that are\nactually really important\nthe flip side of this is that if you are\nsomeone with adhd you may find that\nthere are a lot of problems in your\nrelationship that have to do with some\nof the stuff that we talk about today so\nyou can even have you can be the person\nwith adhd and you can have a\nconversation with your parents you can\nhave a conversation with your\nsignificant other about like some of the\nthings that's a little bit different um\nin your mind and kind of how you work\nand stuff like that and how can y'all as\npeople in a relationship whether it's a\nparent-child relationship or a\nnon-parent child relationship platonic\nrelationship romantic relationship how\ncan you understand some of these things\nto improve the quality of relationship\nso let's start with like what is adhd so\nadhd i kind of think about is\nattentional problems\nand what do i mean by that\nso people with adhd oftentimes have\ndistracted attention\nbut what trips a lot of parents up or\npeople in terms of self-diagnosis and\nall that good stuff\nis that parents will see their kid and\nthey can like do something\nfor\nhours\nwithout interruption\nright and so what what a parent will do\nis they'll look at their kid and they'll\nsay oh well like\nyou know sure they get distracted easily\nand they may have difficulty at school\nbut like if you give them their\nparticular book or if they're playing\nwith legos or they're using an ipad or\nlike whatever they can do this for hours\nand hours and hours without interruption\nso remember that adhd is disordered\nattention it doesn't necessarily mean a\nlack of attention it just means\ndisordered attention so what we see in\nadhd is paradoxically the inability to\nbe interrupted in some cases\nand very like\ntoo easily interrupted in other cases\nso normally what we want is an attention\nkind of in here but what we'll find with\npeople with adhd is there are some\nsymptoms at this end of the spectrum\nwhere they can't\nmove attention\nand so the main main kind of common\nelement here is that sometimes our\nfrontal lobes we want to direct our\nattention in a particular place\nand people who have adhd their frontal\nlobes just don't comply as easily so\nthis could be i need to stop doing this\nand start getting to other stuff\nor it could be\ni need to focus on this one thing and\nstop doing other things right so it's\nlike distraction or inability to to stop\ndoing\nsomething so just because your kid is\nable to play with legos for four hours\nat a stretch does not mean that they\ndon't have adhd in fact if it is very\nvery hard to get them to stop playing\nwith legos if they cannot control and\nrestrain their attention whether that's\nfrom distraction or overly focusing both\nof those are consistent with adhd okay\nso there are a couple of other things\nthat are kind of just like\ncommon qualities so one is\ndifficulty\nengaging\nin academic work\ndifficulty with motivation\nthese are also consistent with adhd so\nif we think about what is motivation\nright the motivation is the ability to\nfocus our attention in a particular area\nfor like\na significant amount of time right so if\ni'm motivated to go to the gym what that\nmeans is that my attention is going to\nbe like okay like let's go to the gym\ni'm going to organize things so this is\nanother thing that we're going to get to\ndifficulty with\norganization\nall features of adhd\nright so if you have difficulty getting\norganized you have difficulty getting\nmotivated um and remember that too\nmotivation is it's not a lack of desire\nright it's a lack of like being able to\norganize your thoughts and move towards\na particular direction in kind of like a\nmotivated and concerted fashion\nso if your kid has these kinds of\nchallenges then you may want to consider\nsomething along the adhd spectrum so\nremember that this is sort of a western\nmodel but in ayurveda we also have vata\nright so this is like\nuh you guys can watch dr k's guide if\nyou don't know what kind about that is\nfor those of you that are familiar with\nayurveda and people who are high on the\nvata spectrum will exhibit signs of adhd\nright so it's not necessarily that you\nneed a clinical diagnosis but if for\nexample\nwe become more manic if we become you\nknow drink a bunch of caffeine things\nlike that there are all kinds of things\nthat will exacerbate our vata including\ntechnology usage and so as arvata\nexacerbates our attention becomes more\nflighty\nso adhd this is another big thing that i\nthink sometimes parents will miss is\nremember that adhd is not just about\nschool and work and focus it actually\nmanifests socially as well\nso uh there have been studies that show\nthat kids with adhd are more likely to\nbe shy and\nwithdrawn now you may ask yourself well\nwhy is that like sometimes kids with\nadhd are shy and withdrawn until they\ndiscover being a class clown\nand now suddenly they know how to become\npopular so if your your route to\npopularity is to be the class clown and\nif you weren't the class clown you\nwouldn't know how to interact with other\npeople in your in your class then you\nmight have adhd okay\nso why are they shy and withdrawn so\nthis comes down to oftentimes kids with\nadhd are neglected by their peers\nalso very very good data supporting this\nokay\nand so you may wonder okay well like\nwhat's going on there so remember that\nlike if you have attentional problems\nit's going to be hard for you to attend\nto social situations read the room as it\nwere right like so you don't know like\nwhere people are it may be hard to pay\nattention to a conversation they may be\ntalking about one thing and because your\nmind is so flighty you start talking\nabout something else\nyou know so all these kinds of like\nproblems that people with adhd run into\nin social situations so this tends to\nlead to social isolation withdrawal they\ntend to get neglected by peers made fun\nof the other flip side of this as well\nis that people with adhd remember that\nyou have disordered attention right so\nsometimes people with adhd will talk\nabout one thing and they won't like read\nthe room and recognize that people are\nnot interested in that subject so over\ntime people will just be like socially\nlike not too interested in engaging with\nan adhd kid and it's super sad\nokay so if your kid has these problems\nthat's another thing to consider\nso\nthe last thing that i'm just going to\nkind of touch on\nis passive non-compliance\nnow this is an example of something that\ni think is very parent-oriented so you\nall may not\nthis is not something that if you have\nadhd you may not really be able to\nunderstand this\nbut sometimes when you're a parent you\ntell your kid what to do\nand like sometimes they just ignore you\nlike and so this can lead to a lot of\nfrustration on the parents part right so\nthe parent is like hey go put on your\nshoes like time to put on your shoes and\nthe kid is playing with legos and they\njust like completely ignore them\nso then what ends up happening is that\nthe parent like has to raise their voice\nright so you get like you like hey put\non your shoes\nand so then the kid like snaps out of it\nand then they kind of like look over you\nand they're like a little bit alarm but\nlike now they understand so they're\ngonna like go put on your shoes so\nwhat's gonna happen in this case so this\nis what's called passive non-compliance\nso kids with adhd don't listen\nokay\nand when they don't listen\nparents can get frustrated\nand then that frustration\nleads to\na behavioral change\nlike raising your voice\nand if you do this\nthey listen\nright\nso what's going on here\nso this is a prime example of how adhd\nshapes parenting which we'll see in a\nsecond\nand in turn the way that adhd shapes\nparenting style\ncan be damaging to the kid right so this\nis like in a nutshell like what we're\ngonna talk about today because now\nwhat's happening is you have a parent\nthat's\nlike constantly raising their voice so\nlike now the parent learns like because\nyour brain is learning too that speaking\nsoftly and politely does not get my kid\nto listen and it's time to go and they\nneed to put on their shoes\nso instead what i'm gonna do is just\nstart barking at my kid all the time\nbecause that's what's effective that's\nwhat they need to listen\nthe challenge here is that it's not that\nthey're not listening it's that they're\nnot hearing right so this is not\ndefiance so sometimes when you tell your\nkid to put on your shoes your kid is\nlike no i don't want to i want to finish\ndoing this\nthat's active non-compliance they know\nwhat they're doing they don't want to do\nit they're pushing limits they're\ntesting boundaries\nwhatever you want to call it\nbut with kids with adhd a lot of times\nthey're not attending to your voice\nso their attention is so focused on what\nthey're doing or so distractible that\nthey literally do not hear and process\nwhat you're saying so it's an\nintentional problem so like and then\nwhat happens is the kid gets kind of\nlike confused and starts to feel bad\nabout themselves because mom is always\nmom or dad is always yelling at me all\nthe time right because like i don't\nlisten\nand then the parents can also tell the\nkid like you need to listen like like\nplease listen listen listen listen the\nkid is like okay i'm going to try to\nlisten i'm going to try to listen i'm\ngoing to try to listen but then the\nproblem is like they feel bad because\nlike literally that stimulus is not\nentering their conscious field their\ntheir brain we have these these\ndifferent kinds of attentional circuits\nlike top-down circuits and bottom-up\ncircuits i won't go into a bunch of\ndetail with this but basically your\nbrain has circuits that like pull your\nattention towards something so if i'm\nwalking down the street and i see a\nsnake in the middle of the road and i'm\nhaving a conversation with my friend\neven though my attention is on the\nconversation with my friend there's some\nsignal processing going on with my\nvisual cortex that's like hey wake the f\nup like stop talking about philosophy\nand like there's a snake in front of you\nright so we have all these circuits in\nour brain that will pull our attention\nin a particular place so when a kid has\nadhd we see passive non-compliance\nbecause their brain is not attending to\nthe stimuli so they don't actually like\nknow that their parent is trying to get\nthem to do something\nokay\nso if you've got a kid who has\nattentional problems maybe has some\nsocial difficulties is a class clown and\nespecially as passive non-compliance you\nmay want to this lecture may apply to\nyou okay\nso now let's kind of move on so what\nimpact let's go back to our original two\nquestions okay\nso\nnow we're going to talk a little bit\nabout\nyou know if a child has adhd what impact\ndoes it have on parenting and if a\nparent has a particular style what\nimpact does that have on adhd\nso as we sort of already illustrated\nthrough our example there is actually a\nreciprocal impact so what we see with\nparents and kids\nis that when you're a parent\nyou will learn certain coping mechanisms\nto get your child to do what they're\nsupposed to do and that unfortunately a\nlot of times those coping mechanisms are\nactually somewhat harmful in the long\nterm and this is what we sort of\nsee this is what the literature kind of\nbears out\nso\na couple of interesting tidbits so adhd\nin the kid\npredicts\nfamily stress\nand even\nparental depression\nso parents of kids with adhd are more\nlikely to be stressed out and even like\neffects like their\nhow depressed they are okay\nwe also know that\nthe severity of adhd\naffects\nthe parenting style\nof parents\nso this is the way in which the parents\ninteract with the kids and we'll talk\nabout this in a second\nand in turn we also find this that the\nparenting\nstyle affects\nseverity\nof adhd\nso what we tend to see is a reciprocal\nkind of like bi-directional relationship\nthat tends to get worse over time until\npeople figure out what they're supposed\nto do right the good news is that all\nthis can be fixed\nso essentially what we see is like adhd\nleads to bad parenting\nand i recognize that that's kind of\njudgmental and stuff but i'll we'll go\ninto more detail in a second and then\nbad parenting actually makes adhd worse\nand then this kind of becomes a loop\nand eventually\nyou know just gets worse and worse and\nworse and worse and worse to the point\nwhere we can even make predictions about\ncollege performance\nbased on the like how things were at\nhome\nso like this actually has been measured\nin things like grades and stuff like\nthat like even at the college level\nso let's talk a little bit about what\nare the different parenting styles\nthere's been a bunch of research on this\nand we're going to go over four\nparenting styles\nokay\nso one the first one is authoritarian\nsecond one is authoritative\nthird one is permissive\nand fourth one is i think overprotective\nthat's the right yeah\nokay\nso\nwhat are the ways in which we understand\nthese parenting styles so one is going\nto be\ncontrol\none is gonna be warmth\nand then we'll just like general notes\nokay i'm not gonna fill up this section\ntoo much but this is where a lot of what\ni'll talk about\nso authoritarian parents have a high\ndegree of control\nactually\njust use a symbol\nso let's just say\nhigh degree of control and low degree of\nwarmth so these are parents that are\nlike harsh they're involved in your life\nthey're like paying attention to what\nyou do and things like that they're\ngonna make sure you're studying on time\nthings like that\num\nyou know but they're not going to be\nlike\nwarm and supportive so these parents\ntend to be controlling\nand punitive\nif you don't do this this is going to\nhappen\nyou need to do this or else this is\ngonna happen you have not demonstrated\nto me that you can handle this so i'm\ngonna do it for you\nright like actions and consequences like\nthere's like you know they're gonna\nteach you like how life works\nokay\nso authoritarian parenting styles lead\nto worsening of adhd symptoms\nadhd symptoms lead to more authoritarian\nparenting styles right so like let's\njust talk about this for a second or\nthink about this for a second\nso if i have a kid who doesn't listen\nwhat i have to end up doing\nis like be harsh with them to get them\nto listen\nso like if if my kid is like playing\nwith legos and i tell them to put on the\nshoes and like they're not putting on\nshoes and like i'm like oh sweet darling\nsweet child oh my goodness baby it's\ntime to put on your shoes love come on\ndarling like let's let's go put on our\nshoes and the kid is like going to\ncontinue playing legos\nand so i'm like hey\nit's time to put on shoes\nright and so the kid feels a little bit\nhurt\nand then they start crying and then like\ni say like i've been i told you three\ntimes\nand you haven't listened\ni've told you like three times to do\nthis and you're not listening so then\ndaddy gets upset\nright so this is an authoritarian\nparenting style\nthe authoritative parenting style\nactually has high control and high\nwarmth\nso these are parents that are\nstructured\nand supportive\nthis is basically the best parenting\nstyle there are studies that show that\nauthoritative parents\nactually do well in terms of like kids\nsubstance use\nso\nchild substance use is like\nthe worst with permissive parents\nand the best with authoritative parents\nso they provide like structures and\nboundaries but they're kind of like warm\nand emotionally supportive\nokay\num\nso like these are parents that i think\nof as is so a couple of other notes so\nthese are people with high expectations\nwith\nlittle support\nso this is another like key aspect of\nauthoritarian parents so you can think\nabout tiger parents as like being in\nthis category right where they expect a\nlot from you but like if you get a b\nthey're not gonna be like okay let's sit\ndown and like think a little bit about\nwhat's going on and like why you gotta\nbe and like how can we help you like are\nyou struggling is do you need glasses\nlike they don't care about that right\nauthoritarian parents are gonna be like\nyou need to get an a\ni don't care how you figure out it out\nyou need to get an a\nright so they're not very supportive but\nthey're like demanding and they have\nhigh expectations\nso authoritative parents are a little\nbit different\nso they are they they set limits\nuh set limits\nwith emotional support\nright so it's like you need to get an a\nbut like i understand things are okay so\nlike tell me like why you know what's\nhard what's going on like is something\ngoing on in your life that seems out of\ncharacter let me understand like help me\nunderstand like what's going on with you\nlike why aren't you getting an a like is\nthere something i need to know about\nwhat can i do to help you still need to\nget an a like we're not going to not let\nyou get an a so we need to correct that\nbehavior and at the same time i can be\nlike emotionally supportive while doing\nso\nokay\nnext parent is permissive which is low\ncontrol and high warmth this is the cool\nparent\nright\nso these people are great because\nthey're emotionally supportive\nbut\nfew boundaries\nfew limitations or boundaries\nright so this is the parent who's kind\nof like\nyeah i'm sorry you got a b honey like\nit'd really be nice if you got an a but\nyou know like do you promise me that\nyou'll study harder okay i love you\ndarling\ndo really good okay mommy's like mommy\nloves you no matter what\nlike daddy daddy loves you no matter\nwhat\nand you promise me you're gonna do\nbetter right okay i'm glad we had this\ntalk\ngo play your nintendo\ngo ahead it's okay\ni know you're gonna do it\nright so that's a permissive parenting\nstyle\nthen we've got the overprotective\nparenting style so this too can be like\nsorta high control\nand then the warmth is kind of weird\nso it's i would call kind of call this\nlike\novert warmth overtly high and covertly\nlow\nso these are like like\noverprotective parents tend to restrict\nautonomy\nof the kid um\ntend to be like\nphysically\nor psychologically controlling\nand tend to encourage dependence\nright so if you can't like if you can't\nget an a like let me go ahead and like\narrange a tutor for you and i'm gonna do\nthis for you and i'm gonna do that for\nyou because you can't do it yourself so\nlike daddy your mommy is gonna take over\nand like you need to do really well but\nlike i'm gonna be there for you okay you\ndon't need to learn how to drive at the\nage of 16. mommy or daddy are going to\nbe there for you if you drive there are\ndrunk drivers on the road we can't trust\nyour friends like they could drive drunk\nso i don't want you driving i don't want\nyou under their influences mom and dad\nare going to drive you everywhere\noh that's wonderful you want to go on a\ndate you have a you have a boyfriend now\nthat's fantastic mommy's so proud of you\nfor having your boyfriend i'm gonna\ndrive you to your date you're gonna sit\nat this table i'm gonna sit at that\ntable i won't bother you at all i\npromise and then when you're done with\nyour little date mommy and daddy will\ndrive you home\nokay\nso these are overprotective parents\nso we tend to see in adhd\nso this is where things get kind of\ninteresting\nso\npeople have done studies looking at ages\nthree\nsix\nand nine\nand what they tend to find is that the\nworse the adhd is\nespecially at this phase\nless so at three-year-olds when you have\nhigh adhd this leads to increased\nauthoritarian parenting\nokay\nwhen you have also between these ages\nwhen you have high authoritarian\nparenting\nthis leads to worse adhd\nokay so it seems like between the ages\nof three and six there isn't too much\nchange\num so it seems like starting at the age\nof six and i would even say just six\nplus because you see this stuff at like\ncollege\nages and stuff like that too\nwe see a lot of bi-directional effects\nso worse adhd leads to worsening\nauthoritarian kind of parenting and then\nauthoritarian parenting leads to\nexacerbation of symptoms of adhd\nso it tends to be there are a couple of\nother interesting dynamics here so it\nseems like there are gender effects here\ntoo\nwhere um for example\nlet me just make sure i have this\ncorrect\nso\nuh\nso\nfemale kids here's just examples of\ndifferent things okay\nare more sensitive\nthis is going to be a packed sentence\nokay\ntoo\nlow\nauthoritative\nmothers\nso this is where when we get into like\nthe super specifics of the research\nwe're looking at like different\nvariables right so what this basically\nmeans\nis that if you're a if you're a a girl\nand you have a mom who is not very\nauthoritative right authoritative is the\ngood one\num right so\nuh hold on oh no sorry yeah\nauthoritative is the good one\nso if you have uh if you're a female kid\nwho has a low authoritative mother a\nmother who does not provide you with\nstructure and emotional support your\nadhd is likely to be like way worse than\na male kid\nright so this is where it's just\ninteresting but as we start looking at\nthese different variables we start to\nsee different sorts of\neffects on kids so for example\ndad's\nparenting style has more of an effect\nbetween the ages of three to six than\nmom's parenting style so there are other\nkinds of interesting just sort of like\nsemi-random\ngender effects that we tend to see like\ndads seem to be more impactful from the\nthe ages of three to six than moms are\nfemale kids with moms that have low\nauthoritative\nparenting styles tend to have like we're\nnot necessarily saying that they're high\nauthoritarian right so do you all\nunderstand that there's like a\ndifference there\nyou can be low on one and high on the\nother but it's really the variable is\nlow authoritative that that girls tend\nto be sensitive to later in life\nthere are all kinds of specific effects\nwe'll give you guys a list of the the\nresources and stuff you guys can read\nthe papers yourself if you want to okay\nso different kinds of effects here\nand so\nthis is the there's a key\nfinding here that's really important so\nthen what people did is they they looked\nat these different effects right and\nthey saw this reciprocal kind of\nrelationship and then so what then\nresearchers started doing\nis intervening\nso researchers started asking the\nquestion okay\nif we move from an authoritarian\nto an authoritative\nright so this one is\ncontrolling\nthis one is structured\nand supportive just to give you guys an\nexample like a reminder right because i\nknow the terms are similar\nso they did is if we train parents\nin moving from authoritarian to\nauthoritative\nwhat happens and the cool thing that\nthey discovered is that adhd improves\nso if you alter the way in which you\nparent\nyou can actually affect the adhd of your\nchild\nand this correlates with all kinds of\nstuff okay so it correlates with like\nimproved academic performance\nimproved ability to like meet goals\nimproved social outcomes so if you like\nliterally change the way in which you\nparent your child's adhd will improve\nnow there's another really really key\nkey key\nfinding here which is fascinating\nis that when researchers when you change\nthe parenting style\nthe inattention\ndoes\nnot\nimprove\nbut\ngrades\nimprove\nokay so now this gets a little bit\ncomplicated\nbut i'm going to try to explain this\nso when we measure a kid with adhd\nthey're like tests that we can do to see\nhow their attention functions like how\nlong can you read this\nboring paragraph for example before your\neyes start wandering\nand then there's other things that we\nmeasure as well\nwhich is like not just like your\nattention at a task\nbut outcomes like what happens to your\ngrades what happens to your social\nsituation what happens to your sense of\ndepression your self-worth all these\nkinds of things and we we we've assumed\nas a psychiatric industry we've assumed\nthat increasing attention\nis the mechanism\nto improve grades\nright\nso then what we do is psychiatrists is\nwe prescribe stimulants\nand what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to give you a pill that will\nimprove your attention therefore we will\nincrease the grade\nand so stimulants lead to\nimproved grades right that's what\npsychiatry believes\nbut what parenting studies actually show\nis really fascinating is the fundamental\nattentional stuff does not improve their\nability to pay attention to a paragraph\ndoes not seem to get better\nbut what does improve is the grades\nand this is a really really really\nimportant finding because what this\nsuggests is that\nfixing the attention doesn't\nautomatically fix everything downstream\nin fact providing the right kind of\nparenting style\nis sufficient to improve your grades\nwithout fixing the attention with\nstimulants\nright so what this actually means is\nthat like you don't need stimulants like\nyou can actually i mean you may need\ndepending on your clinical situation\nbut this fundamental like assumption\nthat psychiatry has that stimulants are\nwhat you need\nappears to actually not be not true that\nyou can actually\nteach parents how to parent properly and\nparent their child appropriately with\nadhd and the kids outcomes will improve\ndespite the fact that you're not\naltering their neurochemistry\nso then the question naturally becomes\nwhat's the relationship between\nstimulants and parenting and this is\nwhat's really fascinating\nwhen you give a kid a stimulant\nit decreases authoritarian parenting\nso this is fascinating\nincredibly fascinating\nright so when a kid is on a stimulant\nand they're able to attend a little bit\nbetter\nthe parent actually needs to yell less\nthey're able to like you know attend to\nthe parent more so the parent doesn't\nenter go into this cycle over here\nright so once you once you fix the\nstimulant this goes away so then this\ngoes away and this goes away they just\nstart by listening\nand so it's kind of like really\ninteresting there right\nand so this is kind of what we sort of\nlearn which is that at the end of the\nday the way in which you parent your\nchild will actually affect their adhd\nsymptoms\nwill in turn affect your own mental\nhealth if you kind of parent them\nappropriately and will lead to better\noutcomes for their kid for your kid so\nthen everyone's going to be asking\nso if you guys want to see um let's just\nlook at a couple of these papers real\nquick okay\nso uh let me see what's something that's\nkind of digestible\num let me just look let me show you guys\nif you guys just want to\nwe'll put include these references\nhopefully somewhere but i'll just flash\nthem here so you guys can look at the\nvod so here's one of the papers that we\nlooked at\nmaternal parenting style and\ninternalizing and adhd symptoms in\ncollege students\nthese studies are actually really cool\nby the way\nparenting is a mechanism of change in\npsychosocial treatment for youth with\nadhd\nright so like that's exploring the\nmechanism of change\nwhen you\nadjust your parenting\num\na longitudinal study of the relation\nbetween family functioning and preschool\nadhd symptoms so these are like papers\nlooking at college students and\npreschool\nokay\nfamily impact and parenting styles and\nin families of children with adhd so\nthis is a great paper that just kind of\ntalks about it all\nand then this is the one that we're\ngonna i think talk about\nnow\nfor a second so examining differences oh\nno wait hold on i'm missing one\nhuh\nthere we go this is the one i'm missing\nso mindfulness for children with adhd\nand mindful parenting mind champ a\nqualitative study on the feasibility\neffects so this is a study that looks at\nactually an intervention where they\ntaught parents the mind champ program\nright so this i don't know if you all\nare aware of this but mine champ is an\nevolution of the pog champ emote\nwhich has now been banned i understand\nright\nso we need to mine champion\npetition twitch chat\nso now what everyone is going to be\nasking is\num\nokay so oh\nthere we go\nso what everyone's going to be asking is\nlike if you're a parent or you're a kid\nand you're trying to figure out or\nyou're a romantic partner or whatever\nplatonic friend\nyou know how do i parent properly\nso there's a lot of different stuff that\npeople have measured\nright to see\nwhat are the key things that determine\nwhether someone like is doing a good job\nof parenting or not good job of\nparenting what are the things that are\nimportant\nso the first is to be structured\ninstead of\nreactive\nso let me actually do it this way\nis greater than reactivity\nwhat does that mean\nso\ni'll give you guys a story from my my\npersonal life\nso i have a kid who's like super high\nvata and what i've found is that like\ngetting her ready for school in the\nmorning can be a five minute process\nthat is easy and simple or it can be a\nhalf hour process with a lot of like\nfrustration and yelling and like\nyou know things like that so what i find\nis that when i'm you know have a hive at\nthat child what i have to do is be like\nsuper super structured about it so for\nexample like we get her clothes ready we\nget her toothbrush ready we get all of\nher stuff ready and it's placed in the\nbathroom whereas in the past what we\nwould do is like we'd brush our teeth in\none place we'd go to the closet to get\ndressed we'd then like go get our socks\nbecause we keep our socks and shoes like\nyou know by the door and then we'd put\non our shoes and like so it's like a\nmulti jet like it's like there's phase\none is brushed teeth and go potty phase\ntwo is moved to location number two and\nput on clothes and phase three is like\nput on socks shoes and coat and what i\nfind is that each time there's a\ntransition her attention can wander and\nshe'll like start playing with something\nif she starts playing with something\nthen i have to like react to it right\nand then i'll also get frustrated i'll\nbe like oh my god like she like she\nfeels like a fish that's gotten like\nloose from the net and then she'll just\nlike run away and do whatever she wants\nto\nokay\nand so what we want to end up doing is\nbeing as structured as possible so this\nis where like we get the clothes the\ntoothbrush we close the door to the\nbathroom and we're not leaving the\nbathroom until we have our coat socks\ntoothbrush you know teeth brushed wet\npotty change clothes put on socks and\ncoat right there and then we're going to\nleave the bathroom and then we'll put on\nour shoes right by the door on the way\nout\nso you want to be as structured as\npossible and try to be as\nas non-reactive as possible\nsecond thing\nimpose limits\nwithout emotion\nthis is a key one okay\nso you want to set boundaries like by\nall means you want to set boundaries the\nproblem or even enforce boundaries the\nproblem is that oftentimes parents will\nimpose those limits or set boundaries or\nenforce boundaries when they themselves\nare pissed\nand so like this is it's hard for a kid\nbecause first of all they're doing\nsomething wrong but when you're yelling\nat them like they may learn because\nthey're going to be learning like their\nlimbic system will be active and it'll\nbe teaching them lessons but there's\ngoing to be like negative impacts to\nself-worth\nis going to go down\nright like they know that you're angry\nwith them\nso they're going to like feel bad\nyou're you're going to be angry with\nyourself\nright because you're yelling at your kid\nand you don't want to be yelling at your\nkid\nso as best as possible\ntry to set limits without being\nemotional right and this is where we\nhave to be super super careful because\nthis translates into a weird thing\nsometimes where parents are like i'm not\nsupposed to be emotional with my kids so\ni'm gonna i'm gonna talk like this i'm\nnot gonna be emotional at all no\nemotions\nchild you have been a bad child today\ntherefore i'm going to have to take away\nyour toy no angry no yelling no emotion\nright\nso sometimes parents will do this\nwhere there's another version of this\nthat i've heard\nhistorically and recently which is like\nyeah we don't punish our kids because\npunishment is bad we should use positive\nreinforcement\nand then they'll say things like okay so\nlike we're not going to do timeout\nbecause timeout is a punishment we're\ngoing to take a break\nor we're going to do something else\nright\nand so they'll use this weird language\nand what they end up doing is like\npunishing the kid they just don't call\nit a punishment\nright it's like super weird and that\nscrews kids up even more like so i had a\npatient got so screwed up it's like nuts\nwhere the parents like would never\npunish the kid because they were super\ninto like not punishing kids\nso instead what would happen is oh like\nyou're acting out\nthe reason you're acting out is because\nyou ate i kid you not gluten\nand so since you're acting out this is\nthe gluten's fault it's not your fault\nbecause heaven forbid we're not going to\npunish you there's nothing wrong with\nyou you are the perfect child it is the\ngluten that's causing the problem\nbecause it's it flaring up your ibs\ntherefore wait for it wait for it wait\nfor it no cupcakes\nyou're acting out therefore it's the\ngluten's fault therefore no cupcakes and\nthe kid gets like super confused right\nbecause\nthey see the acting out and they see the\nremoval of the cupcake they just can't\nhandle like and then it gets really\nweird because if you're punishing a kid\nbut you don't call it punishment that\nscrews up the kid more than just\npunishing them than calling them\npunishment\nyou'll get that\nlike if you're punishing a kid just let\nat least be authentic about it and be\nhonest about it because then the kid\nwinds up in my office i kid you not no\npun intended\nand then they've got this weird [ __ ]\nrelationship with like food\nbecause of this\nand every time that something bad\nhappens so they're like dating someone\nand they feel emotionally hurt and they\nstart blaming the cupcakes and it's like\nthen i have to do the work of rewiring\nthis person's brain and it's like no\nyou're not feeling bad because of the\ngluten\nyou're feeling bad because your your\npartner was emotionally unsupportive it\ndidn't like respond to your texts\nright and so like you get this like so\nif you're gonna punish your kid like\npunish your kid try to do it without\nemotion now this is the other key thing\nwithout emotion does not mean\nsuppressing your emotions so you have a\nmonotone child you have misbehaved\ntherefore i'm going to set a limit on\nyou without emotion no emotion no\nelevated voice nothing no i'm calm i'm\ncollected i'm i am good and you my\nfriend are screwed\nbut with no emotion\nthis is not actually no emotion so this\nis the other thing that parents tend to\ndo is when we say do something without\nemotion they think what that means is\nsuppress the emotion\nbut here's the thing and we see this a\nlot with toddlers right\ntoddlers like know maybe like 50 words\nthey're like two-year-olds right so when\nyou don't use the language of emotion\ni mean a punishment sorry and like you\ndon't display like\nif you don't like overtly punish them\nthey're very very attuned to you\nemotionally and empathically so you can\nact like you're not emotional but a\ntwo-year-old will absolutely understand\nexactly what you're feeling because\nthat's all they've got to work with\nright they don't have vocabulary they\ndon't have logic they don't understand\nreasoning all they can do is like read\nyour facial expression and understand\nthat like mommy and daddy are like not\nhappy with me and i kind of screwed up\nand then you tell your kid no no you\ndidn't screw up this is not a punishment\nyou didn't screw up and then the kid\ngets super confused and they're like\nwhat and then they wind up in my office\nright\nso you're damn right two-year-olds read\nyour mind that's exactly what they do\nbecause that's all they know how to do\nbecause they don't have words they don't\nhave language they don't have logic so\nall they have to do is like super high\nempathic circuitry\nokay\nit's kind of bizarre they're like very\nvery attuned to things\nand it's like you can change your facial\nexpression like make a kid cry like\nsuper easily because that's all they've\ngot to work with they've got no history\nno context all they can do is like read\nyour facial expression it's like 100\nlike they'll read exactly what's going\non\nokay\nso as a parent like what should you do\nright so you want to impose limits\nwithout emotion and if you say okay well\nthat how do i impose limits without\nemotion this is where like you process\nemotions\nso if you're feeling angry with your kid\nyou've got to like kind of work through\nthat yourself okay\nso there's a couple of things that are\nimportant here so one is like awareness\nof your emotions\nthis is what you should do if you're a\nparent right so how do we get here we\nget here by doing this\nso like what are you feeling okay i'm\nfeeling frustrated like acknowledge that\nright and you can even acknowledge it to\nyour kid you can say\nhey daddy is feeling kind of frustrated\nwith you right now and i'm going to do\nmy best to set that aside i really don't\nwant to be frustrated with you and\ndaddy's working on that\ni really need you to put on your shoes\nand i'm sorry if i'm saying that in a\nway that hurts your feelings like can\nyou please do that for daddy you just\nsay that\nright\nand then you can ask them hey\nwas is the way that daddy's talking to\nyou does it make you feel bad\nokay let me give you a hug right so like\nyou can be frustrated but you don't want\nto impose the limit with that\nfrustration it's like it's like that\nsimple\nright it's not necessarily easy to learn\nhow to talk like that but like you can\nacknowledge your emotions to your child\nand like kind of check in with them\nso as a parent you want awareness of\nyour emotions\nokay\nsecond thing is you yourself need to be\nlike careful about being as non-reactive\nand making sure you're emotionally\nregulated\nright so this kind of goes back to now\ni'm using some of the language of the\nresearch paper so this is like\nprocessing your own emotions so you can\ncultivate like\ndetachment so this is like our hg bread\nand butter stuff so the cool thing about\npaying attention to hg\nis that we will make you better parents\nwhether you realize it or not because\nwe're teaching you all to be detached\nright we're teaching you all to like\nunderstand your emotions we're teaching\nyou to be less lexithemic\nanother big thing is acceptance\nand so this too is like related to this\nright\nso you got to kind of just accept\nthat\nlike some of this stuff isn't gonna be\nperfect right so whether i like if my\nkid is like late for school yelling at\nthem is not gonna make a difference\nlike they're late so we can definitely\nhave a conversation about it\nwe can impose some kind of uh punishment\nor whatever but like you as a parent can\naccept that things are just not gonna be\nperfect and so if we think about like\nacceptance like which parenting style\ndoes not enjoy acceptance at all which\nparenting style is the hallmark of a\nlack of acceptance\ndo you all remember\nah yes\nthe authoritarian parenting style or\nacceptance is the enemy\nright\nacceptance is exactly what we want to\navoid like we don't want to accept our\nkid for who they are like screw that we\nwant our kid to be what we want them to\nbe\nscrew acceptance\nacceptance leads to subpar results\nand this is the really sad thing is that\nis actually like not true\nin fact the opposite right what we tend\nto discover through research is that\nactually like accepting your kid for\nwhere they're at and still sort of\nimposing limits and boundaries and\nstructure\nwith love is actually the way to go\nso as a parent you want to be structured\ninstead of reactive so if you've got a\nkid with adhd\ndon't give them opportunities to get\ndistracted\nright so you want to like not have to\nrespond and chase them around this is\nwhat drives parents absolutely crazy\nbecause then you're chasing your kid\naround all the time\nyou're stressed out you get frustrated\nwhat should take five minutes is now\ntaking half an hour you don't have your\nown time to take care of yourself so\nself-care is actually another important\npart\nsomething that parents\nwoefully neglect\nis like taking care of themselves\nbecause if you are calm cool and\ncollected\nyou will do a better job of taking care\nof your your kids\nand this is what we've seen in our\nparent program is like we'll give our\nour parents like we'll teach them\ncommunication skills we'll teach them\nhow to set boundaries and stuff like\nthat but a big part of what we do for\nparents is actually emotional support\nand this is where like you know we get\nthem in a room together we talk about\nokay what's like what's it like for you\nhaving a kid who's addicted to video\ngames\nit's like terrifying right like they're\nscared they're scared that their child\nis like their kid is like 19 years old\nthey failed their first year of college\nand the parent is terrified they're like\nwhat if i can't control this like what\nif this continues they're gonna be\nhomeless like what's gonna happen to\nthem once i pass away like if they're\nnot able to take care of themselves they\nhave all this fear\nrolling around inside of them and then\nanytime they have a conversation\nit's gonna like show up with the kid\nright so we actually had this case\nyesterday where someone was sharing with\nme that you know the parent was\nconcerned about their kid they said like\ni i'm worried about what's gonna happen\nto you when i'm gone\nand that's a devastating thing to share\nwith a child like the kid can't handle\nthat emotional that because they know\nyou're right like they know you're right\nif you're a parent who has enabled your\nchild\nand you have like a man-child for a kid\nor a woman child for a kid and like you\ndo like their laundry and stuff like and\nyou worry about what's gonna happen and\nthat's a completely valid worry that is\ngonna terrify your kid because they know\nit's true they know that once you leave\nlike they they're like they're old\nenough to understand they don't do their\nlaundry they don't pay their bills they\ndon't have a job so if you're a kid like\nthat like it's terrifying to face that\nreality that your parent isn't gonna be\nthere one day and then that negative\nemotion that the kid deals with in turn\nis gonna shatter their motivation\nit's not gonna like scare them straight\nit's gonna like that's what drives them\nto the game in the first place\nand then like they get driven to the\ngame and like now they retreat because\nlike their life is going nowhere when\nyour parent is like by the way your life\nis going nowhere and the kid is like\nyeah i know they lash out at the parent\nand they retreat to the video game and\nthen the cycle perpetuates\nright so how do you do this you take\ncare of your own emotions as a parent\nsomewhere else you take care of yourself\nyou do what you need to\nif you need that glass of zinfandel on\nthursday at 4 pm you go for it right\ni don't actually recommend that because\nusing alcohol as a coping mechanism is a\nbad idea\nlet's say if you need your bath\non a sunday morning\nyou go for it\nokay\nso this is adhd and parenting to\nsummarize\nit's kind of interesting because a lot\nof people wonder what's the relationship\nbetween parenting and adhd right so if\nlike if i have an adhd kid do i need to\nparent differently the answer is\nabsolutely yes\nfor kids with adhd you may wonder you\nknow like\nwhat is my parents impact on my\nadhd and the interesting thing is that\nit appears that children with adhd\nstress their parents out and result in\nchanges in parental behavior which in\nturn those changes in parental behavior\nlead to worsening and adhd symptoms and\nit's absolutely a bi-directional effect\nand so i'm not trying to share this with\nyou all for the purpose of like you know\nblaming your parents and being like you\nscrewed me up now i'm failing out of\ncollege because you didn't parent me\nwell enough and i don't want the parents\nto feel guilty because they're like oh i\nscrewed up because if i'd been a more\nauthoritative parent instead of an\nauthoritarian parent then my kid would\nbe like getting a 4.0 in college that's\nnot the point of this the point of this\nand those feelings can come up and\nthey're actually quite natural the point\nis even if that does come up like the\ntwo we all have a relationship\nand the child needs to acknowledge that\nhey maybe if you did things differently\nlike life would be easier for me\nand at the same time like child also\nneeds to acknowledge that like i can't\nreally blame you for this because it's\nnot like anyone teaches you this stuff\nright so it's sort of like not the\nparent's fault and then you guys can\nstart building bridges from where you\nare now right as a parent you can\nacknowledge that maybe if you knew more\nabout this like you would have done a\nbetter job and you wouldn't have like\nput your kid in the situation they're in\nso you can apologize that for as a\nparent as a kid you can forgive them if\nyou both admit to like what what the\nsituation is and then you guys can be on\nthe same team like there's like avoiding\nmaking mistakes is not the way that you\nbuild a relationship you acknowledge the\nmistake you forgive people for the\nmistake and even then it's the child's\nplace to say if they're kind of mature\nabout it they're gonna say like actually\ni can't really blame you for that but i\nappreciate the apology i don't hold it\nagainst you and i'm but i'm glad you\nknow you're accepting responsibility but\ni don't blame you at all i love you very\nmuch\nlet's work on it now like that's what\nwe're looking for at the end right\nso at the end of the day though adhd in\nparenting is super tricky and the good\nnews is that if you adjust your\nparenting style you can actually affect\nthe the symptoms of adhd\nso this is where being more\nauthoritarian be being more structured\nand emotionally supportive as opposed to\ndisciplinarian or controlling or\npermissive where you let the adhd kid do\nwhatever they want to\nor where you let them like you're\noverprotective and you start doing\nthings for them because parents will\nlike default to any of those things\nright\neither i'm going to yell at you i'm just\ngoing to do it for you\nbecause you've got adhd and you can't do\nit yourself\ni'm gonna just like\ni'm done with this i like i don't know\nwhat to do about this\nthrow your hands up and let your kid do\nwhatever he wants to so the permissive\noverprotective or authoritarian style\nthose are all non-ideal\nthe challenge the challenging thing is\nthat the authoritative style which is\nkind of the right move is difficult it's\nhard it requires self-care on the part\nof the parent it requires awareness on\nthe part of the parent it requires like\nacceptance\nit requires being thoughtful and like\nbuilding in structure and trying to not\nbe as reactive as possible and\nprocessing your own emotions so it's\nhard but the good news is that you can\nalter that\nso if you're someone in a relation if\nyou've got adhd and you see this kind of\nstuff in your parents\nrecognize that some of what your\nself-esteem is\nmay not be because your parents are\nactually like think you're crap but like\nsome of those emotions which even if you\nknow your parents love you those\nemotions are coming from experiences\nwhere your parents had to react because\nthey didn't know any better\nand similarly if you're in a romantic\nrelationship now or platonic\nrelationship now understand that\nstructure and non-reactivity will help\nthe relationship right so you can\nimplement these from any which way\nquestions\ncan could you talk about how the\nrelationship changes when\nwhen the parent has adhd as well\nis it's quite genetic yeah absolutely\nso if a parent not only adhd\nbut when a parent has any kind of\npsychopathology it leads to worsening\nsymptoms in the kid\nokay\nso like you can have a parent with\nanxiety that'll lead to worsening\nsymptoms with adhd\nthere's also\nuh\nso adhd is not the only illness that\nwe examined i mean i'm not going into\nall the detail because that's you know\nso for example this paper looked at not\nonly adhd but oppositional defined\ndisorder depression and anxiety\ni think there's some paper that looks at\nocd too\nand then there's like there's plenty of\ndata let me see if i can find if one of\nthese references i mean i read more than\nthis\num let me see if there's a parenting\nnope\nyeah so you can also look at this paper\nwhich looks at\num let me see if i can find this real\nquick so there's like family stress\nhere we go\nyou ready for it man i'm good sometimes\ni gotta say\ndr k is good\nto remember where the paragraph is in\nwhich paper like sometimes i i'm proud\nof myself\nso parent adhd symptoms um\nso\nusing a four-point likert scale if a\nparent responded two or three for\nsymptoms okay\nuh\nso this paper did look at\num parent adhd\nso this is the paper a longitudinal\nstudy of the relationship between family\nfunctioning and preschool adhd symptoms\nso let me see if i can find\nthe result\nokay so this is going to be\na bit complicated so i'll try to find\nthis for you all okay\num i don't know here we go\nthis is the paper that this is the one\nwe want\nso this looks at the impact of for\nexample maternal depression\nright so we can see what the impact is\nthese are statistically significant we\ncan look at parental\nyeah uh\nso they don't have they're not looking\nat\none of these is not summarized\nso you can look at like maternal life\nstress you know seems to have a negative\ncorrelation\nwith\nadhd\nlet's look at depression and anxiety i\nthink that's what we want\nactually\nright and the key thing here is that\nmaternal depression or paternal\ndepression is going to have an impact on\nthe adhd\num\nand then that impact changes based on\nwhich category of kid you're talking\nabout\nand if you guys look here\nit looks like the impact from mothers is\ngreater than fathers but the short\nanswer is that adhd for parents will\nabsolutely affect the adhd of the child\nand it's not just\nadhd and parents right so there's\nevidence that for example being an\noverprotective parent\nincreases the anxiety of your child\nthere are even studies that show that\ngiving parents anti-anxiety medication\nif they have an anxiety disorder has a\nclinical benefit in the kid\nso when you are an anxious parent who is\noverprotective you will pass on that\nanxiety to the kid and if you medicate\nyourself or get treatment yourself that\nwill result in your kid having less\nanxiety\nso but what should adhd kids say to a\nsingle parent to describe uh to them\nwhat's happening especially if a parent\nthinks you're just trying to change them\nin a negative way\nmy mom tends to blame me for everything\nbut not to accept that i'm in the adhd\nspectrum\nso that's a really tough question but a\nreally good question so i would start by\nhaving in like open-ended conversation\nwith your parents so start to ask them\nso like take a particular example\nlike if you had some kind of conflict\nlet's say you didn't take out the trash\nand your mom gets upset with you and you\ncan sort of ask her like\nhow do you see this situation like what\ndo you think is going on here\nright and she'll say like oh like you're\njust\nyou know\nyou're criticizing me like maybe they'll\nperceive any kind of conversation as a\ncriticism that can happen so this is\nwhat's really tricky\nis that\nif parents know they're doing a bad job\nand you try to bring up to them that\nthings are not ideal\nthat suppressed thought of i'm doing a\nbad job comes roaring back and they push\nback against it right so there's\nsuppressive mechanisms that like that\nare pushing down the thought that i'm\nscrewing up because that is the most\ndevastating thought to a parent right if\nyour parent loves you you can get some\nreally bizarre behavior because if i'm\nscrewing up as a parent and i love my\nkid like that's terrifying i can't i\ncan't deal with that so what i do is i\nsuppress that and then what happens is i\nend up getting hypersensitive to any\nkind of criticism of my parenting\nbecause deep down i am insecure about it\nright it's just like any other\ninsecurity if i'm afraid i'm an idiot\nthen what i need is a thousand people to\ntell me i'm smart every single day\nand if a single person calls me an idiot\ni'm gonna push back against them so hard\nso this is where it's like uh like you\nknow having a gentle conversation with\nthem where if they start to get\ndefensive you can sort of ask what are\nyou hearing me say are you hearing me\nsay that i that you're a bad parent you\ncan just ask them that question\nand then you can even tell them i'm not\nsaying that i'm just saying that we have\na conflict and i'm trying to figure out\nhow we can work through this conflict\ni don't believe i'm 100 at fault i don't\nbelieve you're 100 at fault in fact two\npeople cannot be at fault individually\nbut when you have a relationship\nthere's going to be some kind of\nfriction that occurs because you've got\nmore than one human\nso i just like to explore with you like\nwhat do you think is going on like in\nour relationship why do you think these\nconflicts keep happening\nlet's try to understand it because i\nlove you and i want to have a healthy\nrelationship with you and sometimes\nrelationships need a little bit of work\nwhat do you think about that\nright so you can try things like that\nbut that's super challenging like\ngenerally speaking you you know if\nyou've got a defensive kind of like\nsuppressing parent and you're a kid with\nadhd it's hard to do that\nwhat you could also do is send them this\nlecture and just use that as a backdrop"
