    "transcript": "hello everyone i'm basically a modern\nslave\num i wanted to tell you guys a little\nbit about my current work situation i am\nworking as a pizza delivery driver i\nwork 13 to 15 hours a day four to five\ndays per week making approximately\n3.60 that's euro right per hour plus\ntips\num\nthen they were\nwhen when they were hiring they said\ni'll need to work 11 hour shifts plus\ntaking co-workers home after work\napparently those few hours cleaning\npizza place after the shift driving my\nco-workers home is not paid\nthis week i worked for six days per week\nthe boss called me in other words\nbegging me to help them by working but\nonly this week because two other people\nleft after the new year and one got\nkovid i asked if i have a choice the\nboss said basically no\ni agreed because i thought it's only\nthat one week today i find out that next\nweek i'm working six days as well that\nmade me quite furious\nthis last week i felt\ni feel like i'm not even living life i\nwake up go to work get absolutely tired\nget back home sleep because at that\nmoment you don't want to do anything\nelse and repeat i just want to quit so\nbad\nanyways just needed a space to a place\nto vent i thought about quitting\ntomorrow my shift starts in five minutes\nit's gonna be a long day\nstay strong folks and i'll try to do the\nsame\nokay\num so the first thing is that i'm\nnoticing that a lot of people in chat\nare kind of saying like\nthis has to be this location oh this\nsounds like portugal this sounds like\nfrance\num you know this sounds like this part\nand i think the truth is that this is\nhappening everywhere right\nso what i'd like to talk to you all\nabout today is like how do people become\nmodern slaves right so what are what are\nthe circumstances that\nlead to this kind of situation where\nyou know they're they're hired\nunder these conditions and even told at\nthe very beginning that like it's going\nto be 11 hour shifts and they're gonna\nhave to take\nhome co-workers in some ways this is\neven like better than usual because a\nlot of times\nduring the hiring process people will\nsay one thing and then they'll force you\nto do something else and it's really\ntough because in these situations you\nknow we may look at this and people on\nthe internet will say just quit\njust to go find another job\nright but the truth is that if you're in\nthis situation of modern slavery it's\nnot that simple there's a reason why you\nwound up here in the first place and\nit's not like that this person is like\nfoolish or anything like that it's not\nthat this person is lazy or foolish or\nyou know doesn't know any better or\nthings like that there are very real\ncircumstances both externally and\ninternally that lead people into the\nsituation and until we have an\nappreciation for like how someone gets\nhere and what goes into this situation\nthen\nthen only can we start to really come up\nwith solutions to help people get out of\nthe situation\nand so what i'm going to talk a little\nbit about today is like um you know\nmodern slavery\nand how do people get into this\nsituation and more importantly like what\nare the key dynamics at play\nuh so for example what are the power\ndynamics at play what kind of like\nmodeling has this person had early in\ntheir life\num how do they determine what is\nacceptable or unacceptable and then\nother kinds of stuff as well\nso\nyou know some of this stuff is like you\nknow for example this person is saying\nthose few hours are not paid and it's\nlike\nyou know a lot of people will be like\nwait what like then why are you doing it\nhow is that legal that can't be legal it\nmay not be legal\nthe other thing is that you know we see\nother things that happen a lot in\nworking situations the boss called me\nbegging me to help them work\nright so when a boss begs you\nwhat is going on psychologically when\nbegging is happening\nthe next thing that happens i asked if i\nhave a choice and the boss said\nbasically no\ndoes basically no mean no\nor is it almost no\nso if something is almost no or\nbasically no\ndoes that what does that actually mean\nright so this is the kind of thing where\nlike oftentimes in work situations\nbecause of power dynamics and and you\nknow boundary setting issues\npeople will use certain kinds of\nlanguage and then like we won't really\nclarify what that means\nand then what we end up doing\nbecause like i want you all to\nunderstand this for a second when you\nknow you ask if you have a choice and\nyour boss says basically no\nin their mind are they thinking that you\nhave a choice actually kinda yes\nright because they sort of like you're\nasking if you have a chess and they're\nlike oh they agreed to it so a boss can\nwalk out of this interaction believing\nthat\nthe the worker agreed to this\nright so so this is the kind of thing\nthat like you know there's a lot\nactually going on here that we can learn\nfrom about setting health healthy\nboundaries especially in power dynamic\nsituations that is like really really\nimportant\nthe last thing is today i found out i'm\nworking six days as well right so like\nin this situation do you have the power\nto say no\nand then the last thing is that made me\nquite furious so when you're at work and\nyou feel something right so when your\nboss is begging me what do you feel\nand when you start to feel quite furious\nyou feel a certain way like what do you\ndo with those feelings\nright how do those feelings interact\nwith your boss how do they interact with\nyour uh work environment essentially\nwhat are the emotional drives\nthat happen within us that create\nsituations like this\nand in my overwhelming experience\nunderstanding the emotional drives\nand understanding the power dynamics and\nhow to set healthy boundaries has been\nvery very helpful to people to like\ncreate like good work environments and\nthis is the kind of thing where when i\nsay create good and work work\nenvironments i don't mean just for the\nemployees so this may sound kind of\nweird because i know at least the\nanti-work subreddit is like very like\nanti-employer\nbut like\ni want you all to think about this work\nsituation like do you think the employer\nis happy here they've had two people\nquit\nthey've had one person get sick with\nkovid maybe because they've had coveted\npolicies that aren't really great right\nand then like this person is on the\nverge of quitting like this is not a\ngood place even from an employer's\nperspective so\nsome people may think a lot about okay\nlike you know this this this is a\npredatory workplace and it absolutely is\nbut people sort of assume that a\npredatory workplace is good for the\nemployer which in my overwhelming\nexperience is not the case\nand so this is where understanding some\nof these things because like this person\nthat this employer is basically by\nvirtue of\ncrapping on their employees so much\ndriving their employees away and like\npulling pushing themselves out of\nbusiness like that's what they're doing\nand so the interesting thing is that\nacknowledging healthy boundaries and\nsort of like acknowledging emotions at\nwork you know being very clear about\ncommunication and not taking advantage\nof your employees is actually good for\nthe employer too there's sort of this\nidea that like you know work like that\nif you're a predator predatory employer\nthat you're winning when in my\nexperience overwhelmingly and i've done\nconsulting at a lot of different\ncompanies\nthe companies that do the best are the\nones that have happy employees and like\nrespectful employers like when there's\nrespect on both sides when there's\nfairness on both sides that's actually\nwhen things end up the best so let's\ntalk a little bit about modern slavery\nand how we get here so i'd say that the\nbiggest thing that leads to modern\nslavery is unhealthy boundaries\nso a lot of times at work we'll have\nthese situations where bosses will beg\nus right they'll like ask us for favors\nand so there'll be like all like so this\njob for example has unhealthy boundaries\nat the get-go so like for example if you\nwere to ask this person\nwhen do you start work\nand then the person will say like i\nstart work at this time and when does\nwork end well\nwork sort of ends like when i'm done\nwith my shift but then i have to clean\nafter i have to drop people off oh okay\nso is that like a part of your job and\nthey're like well sort of do you get\npaid for it well not really\nthen is it a part i'm confused this is\nlike a favor is it part of your job like\nwhat is that extra uncompensated time so\nwork you know starts here and goes here\nand you get compensated here or euro\nright did i do the euro symbol right or\nis that backwards\nit's lagging whatever\nand then um\nand then there's like this extra time\nover here which is like uncompensated\nso is that a part of your job or is that\nnot a part of your job so in the united\nstates if you require someone to do\nsomething generally speaking you have to\npay them for it there are some\nexceptions to that but generally\nspeaking that's kind of the case\nand so\num\n[Music]\nuh this is lagging again okay whatever\nso\nif that's the case then what is this is\nthis part of your job or is this not\npart of your job so the first thing that\nwe kind of realize from this scenario is\nthat there are unhealthy boundaries so\nif you're in a situation where it's like\na little bit unclear what's a part of\nyour job or what isn't a part of your\njob like that's the\nthe start of unhealthy boundaries\nso what tends to happen if you have\nunhealthy boundaries is this results in\nsomething called job creep\nright so we see this like especially in\nprogramming and stuff where there's like\nscope creep where if you've got like a\nproject and then like\nyou're\nyou know then someone else wants this\nfeature and then you want this feature\nand then suddenly like the project that\nwas this big\nover time becomes this big and then over\ntime becomes this big but\nearly on like you were budgeted for this\nand then people get confused when they\nask for like you know this and then they\nask for this and then you end up paying\nmore euro and then like they're super\nconfused they're like but\nbut this was the budget that you gave me\nso we see this a lot in terms of like\nwhen you have developers working with\nlike executives right they're like this\nis on you see this a lot even in the\ngaming industry but it's like we want to\nhave customized armor and it's like\nthat's going to cost you something right\nand then we end up with all kinds of\nproblems like games being released too\nearly and things like that\nso in the same way in a job oftentimes\nwhat we'll see is that there's like\nthere's going to be some kind of like\nboundary\nthat is\nunhealthy or muddy in some way and then\nlike as that boundary is nice and loose\nlike unhealthy employers will cause you\nto like little cram stuff into there\nright so the biggest example that we see\nwhich we definitely saw today\nwas\nyou know\num\nwhere is this work\nuh yeah so like\nbecause two people left after the new\nyear and one got covered so like what's\nhappening to this work so there used to\nbe three additional people at work\nand like\nwhere is that work going it's going into\nthis person right so the person who\nstays the one who's like getting all\nthat work\nand so what tends to happen with\nemployers actually is like this is a\ncommon thing that i see is that\nif you have unhealthy if you have loose\nboundaries if there are two people at\nwork\none of them has loose boundaries and one\nof them has firm boundaries the one with\nthe loose boundaries is the one that\nkeeps on getting more work right you're\ngoing to keep on getting more and more\nwork packed into your unhealthy boundary\nbecause you're the person like at the\nvery beginning and we see this with this\nperson so the person even when they got\nhired did not set a firm boundary where\nlike they were told like at the\nbeginning of work that hey you're gonna\nhave to do a bunch of work that we're\nnot gonna pay you for and the person was\nlike\nokay\nand so in doing so they've established\na fluid boundary\nright and once they they've established\na fluid boundary then we're like you\nknow it's kind of like open season like\noh people quit\nyeah you're gonna need to do this and\nthen what what's gonna happen is\nemployers and this isn't just employers\nthis is humans okay so employees will do\nthis with employers as well by the way\nso it's not like one way\nso then what's what's gonna happen is by\nthe way\nyou gotta\npick people up\nright so these are bad working\nconditions and then we have like these\ntwo people over here\nwho have fern boundaries and they quit\nright because they were like this is\nridiculous i'm like i'm not getting paid\nfor this the other one person that stays\nso they stay\nand then this work goes over here and\nthen suddenly this person is working\nsix days a week\nbecause of begging and we'll get to that\nin a second\nand then just this week\nbut what do we know about this person's\nboundaries\nwhat are they gonna do if we push them\nthey're gonna be like okay and then into\nnext week\nand then they're gonna experience\nfrustration\nright but what do they do with their\nfrustration they post on the internet\nthey don't go have a conversation with\ntheir boss or their employer and say hey\nthis is ridiculous i'm on the verge of\nquitting and then what's going to happen\nis they're going to be get fed up\nand then they're going to quit\nand you may say like so the anti-work\nsubreddit i think is going to be like\ncheering if this person quits right\nthey're going to be like yay like this\nperson quit like screw capitalism screw\nstick it to the man which is totally\nfine i mean i i have nothing against you\nknow quitting and leaving a a\nunfair employer to figure out their own\nmess\nbut i'm concerned about this person\nbecause what do you think is going to\nhappen\nthe next time they get a job\nright are these are all these boundary\nissues magically going to be fixed i\ndon't think so\nright\nnext time what's going to happen is\nmaybe they'll find another job where\nsomeone's like gonna start off because\nyou you'll see that like\nthis scenario is actually designed to\nlike not end well\nand it's all because of unhealthy\nboundaries so then the question is like\nyou know what's going on here and and\nwhat what contributes to this so we\nstart with unhealthy boundaries\nand what are like how do we like where\ndoes this come from there are a couple\nof other things here so one\nis there's conflict avoidance\nthis is a huge thing so if we want to\nunderstand how to correct this behavior\nwe have to understand conflict avoidance\nso this person had multiple options to\nlike set a boundary right so why don't\nwe set good boundaries that's kind of\nthe next point like okay dr k you're\nsaying second good boundaries why don't\nwe because we're conflict avoidant so at\nthe job interview when they're told from\nthe get-go by the way you're gonna need\nto work 11-hour days and you have to\ndrop people off\nand then like what do you say at that\npoint right like why don't you say\nanything you're like oh okay\nand then you ask these these questions\nlike do i have a choice\nand then the person says basically no\nand then it's like what's going on there\nthat's all conflict avoidance so this\nperson is not saying has never said to\ntheir boss\ni don't think that this is fair\nright they've never set a boundary\nthey've said i'm happy to work i'm happy\nto do whatever you want to but if this\nis a job i expect to be compensated like\ni'm confused are you asking me to\nvolunteer my time\nor is this like paid work does this need\nto be done\nand if you're hiring me like why is it\nmy responsibility to arrange for\ntransport i'm confused i thought my job\nwas to make pizza so is this a part of\nmy job description or is this not a part\nof my job description\nnow i'm not saying that like\nyou shouldn't and this is one of the\nworst things that i think has happened\nis that the you know employers have\ntaken the aspect of team player and\nabused it so much that it like terrifies\nme as someone who has both worked in\ngood team player environments and now\nlike someone who employs people like so\nwe love team players but somewhere along\nthe way\nteam player started to mean\nlike\nwe're gonna ask you to do a bunch of\nwork and we're not gonna compensate for\nyou for it like that's not what a team\nplayer is like i don't know if you all\nhave ever done this but i've worked in\nenvironments where people are team\nplayers and those are awesome\nenvironments like what does a team\nplayer mean i still remember to this day\nin the summer of 2014\ni was i was in residency for two months\nand i was just so overwhelmed and so\noverworked and my like colleagues right\nnext to me were equally overwhelmed and\nequally overworked\nand the doctor that was sitting next to\nme also in residency for two months\nwe've been doing it just as long\ni have to do something called a prior\nauthorization which is i have to make a\nphone call to an insurance company to\ntry to get them to pay for a medication\nthat one of my patients needs and\nusually this is like a 30 minute like\nprocess where you sit on hold for like\n20 minutes i was just exhausted and the\ndoctor next to me turns to me and says\nyou want me to take care of that prior\noff for you\nand i was like dude you have too much to\ndo like i can't like i can't ask you\nthis and like seriously don't worry\nabout it like i'll take care of it for\nyou and she took care of it for me and\nit was like the nicest thing in the\nworld like even now seven years later i\nremember that moment because\nlike it's not like she had a less work\nthan i did we both had a ton of work\nwe're both overworked but she was a team\nplayer in that moment and so to this day\ni've tried my best to repay her but i\ndon't think like i've never repaid that\ndebt despite my best efforts so you can\nabsolutely like be a team player like i\nthink being a team player is good like\nthe whole point of a corporation at\nleast in my mind and maybe it's profit\nand stuff like that but\nyou know i think the point is that like\nif you guys have ever worked in\nenvironments where you're just all by\nyourself like that's not fun it's not\nengaging the whole point if we think\nabout like aoe healing in this community\nthe whole point is that we can do stuff\ntogether that we can't do on our own but\nwhat's happened in the like the\ncapitalistic corporate world is team\nplayer has been hijacked culturally\nappropriated to be like a veil over\nabusive work practices\nand that's ridiculous so now like people\nare like oh we don't want team players\nit's like i don't want to work in any\nenvironment where they're team players\nlike what do you want you want to work\nin a cubicle where you're like a peon\nlike sitting at a computer doing like\nthat's terrible\nright so i'm not blaming those people\nfor avoiding the term team player what\ni'm blaming is that companies are like\nstarting to use team player as you know\nsome license to be predatory and put\npeople into like a slavery-like\nsituation that's ridiculous\nbut we want to work in teams like that's\nfun like it's good to be a team player\nanyway\nso if we kind of look at this\nwhat we see here is a thread of conflict\navoidance and if we want to understand\nyou know why are we conflict avoidant\nthen what happens\nis we need to look at\nemotional drivers\nso this in turn results in emotional\ndrivers\nor not results in is due to emotional\ndrivers\nso if we kind of look at this post we\nsee a lot of emotions threaded out\nthrough here right\nso like when they were hiring they said\ni'll need to work 11 hour shifts plus\ntaking\nco-workers home after work apparently\nthose few hours is not paid so like what\ndo you imagine this person was feeling\nin that moment\nwhat do you think that was going through\ntheir head\nand then now it's like when their boss\ncalls and begs them\nlike they're begging and forcing this is\nreally confusing so the boss called me\nin other words begging me to help them\nbecause two people left i asked if i\nhave a choice and the boss said no so\nwhat's happening here is the boss\nforcing them or begging them because in\none situation the power dynamic is that\nif i'm begging you you have all the\npower in the other situation if i'm\nforcing you you have none of the power\nso there's a weird power dynamics crap\ngoing on there's weird emotional drivers\ngoing on and then you feel furious and\nwhat do you do with that period do you\ntalk to your boss about it no\nyou just either take it\nyou just keep taking it right\nor what you do is you just like reach\nyour limit and you quit which is what\nthis person has managed to like this is\nthe work environment they managed to\ncreate they've not created a work\nenvironment where people feel\ncomfortable\ncoming to their boss and sharing with\nthem like what their concerns are which\nis crucial it's critical right so all of\nthe good environments that i've worked\nin have systems of feedback where like\npeople can go to the you know their\nsuperiors and they can say hey i'm\nunhappy with this and it's not like the\nsuperior listens to you 100 they're not\ngoing to like make changes like for\nexample you know residents in the united\nstates are like criminally underpaid but\nwe have no negotiating power and even my\nboss doesn't really have much\nnegotiating power there\nbecause they have to answer to like a\nwhole like systemic\nindustry of predatory work and for\nmedical residents but that's neither\nhere nor there so right so like that's\nnot my boss's fault like they're going\nto advocate and do what they can and\nthey're like they honestly are trying to\nmake things better they're happy to work\nthere they want to be a team player they\nwant to support us we want to support\nthem and it's awesome like i still that\nto this day\nliterally this morning i texted my\nformer boss because they're an awesome\nperson and i have like really good\nrelationship with them\num\nand so what are these emotional drivers\nokay so let's like start to look at a\ncouple of common emotional drivers so\ni'll give you guys an example of how\nemotional drivers\nresult in\num\npoor boundaries okay so let's use an\nexample first\nso\nlet's say i'm afraid of loneliness\nand then i start hanging out with some\nfriends\nand then one of them\nmakes fun of me\nwhat do i do\nright i'm afraid of loneliness what do i\ndo\nwhat do y'all think\nyou laugh it off right\nyou're so funny when you call me an\nidiot\nignore it\nright\nso then what does that what kind of\nbehavior does that\nreinforce\nso then someone else a different friend\nfriend\nnumber two\nmakes fun of you the next day\nright and then what do you do well like\nno\nkind of weird\nright\nand then you kind of like\nlaugh it off\nwalls\nyeah you're right i'm so insignificant\nof a human being\nand now since you're afraid of\nloneliness like you kind of tolerate\nthis behavior and then the group sort of\nlearns they're like oh cool so this\nperson is the butt of the jokes\ngreat\nwe needed someone to beat up on when\nwe're feeling bad about ourselves\nfantastic and so you become the butt of\nthe jokes\nand now you know you're the butt of the\njokes like it's become a thing like the\nwhole group is like this is the person\nlike you know and it starts off as like\noh wow this person is awesome they can\ntake a joke but like over time it grows\nand they push that boundary and they\nstart making fun of you and then like\nyou end up in these situations where\nyour friends like actually actively\nbully you\nbut then why do you stay because you're\nafraid of loneliness\nbecause if i tell them hey that's not\nfunny\nthis person will dislike me\nif they dislike me they will not invite\nme to their house if they don't invite\nme to their house and they invite all of\nmy other friends\ni will be alone\nso it's like i have a choice either i\ncan hang out with these people have some\nfun and be the butt of the jokes or i\ncan be a loser like i can be a loser at\nhome on my own or i can be a loser with\nthem but still have friends and not be\nlike as much of a loser\nright so this is just an example of how\nan emotional\ndrive actually leads to unhealthy\nboundaries so does this happen at work\nand\nabsolutely right so like let's think\nabout a couple of different things that\nhappen\nso people\nare reluctant to ask for stuff\nwhy are we reluctant to ask for stuff\nbecause we don't want to be perceived as\ngreedy\nright so who's greedy\nthe corporation or the employee like we\ndon't want to be like them like we\ndemonize greed like even right now\nwithin the anti-work subreddit we are\ndemonizing greed\nand what are we doing by demonizing\ngreed we're saying oh these corporations\nare so evil and greedy\nand like in a bizarre way we're actually\nlike\nwe're labeling this thing as green which\ni'm with but then what what's gonna\nhappen is like subconsciously we're\nactually like at the same time\nmaking employees feel greedy for doing\nthings like asking for raises or just\ncompensation or things like that so this\nis a huge thing i don't want my boss to\nthink i'm greedy\nokay\nhuge emotional driver\nit's emotional driver number one\num emotional driver number two so when\npeople when it comes to time for like\npromotion and things like that\npeople have difficulty advocating for\nthemselves in a work environment right\nso they have like difficulty advocating\nfor what they're worth\nand why is that it's because i don't\nwant to be perceived\nas a show-off\nright so like if you crush let's say\nyou've got some kind of contract and you\ndo a really good job\nand then like you don't want to be\nperceived as a show-off so you don't\nlike really advocate for yourself you\ndon't really let your boss know you\ndon't let other people know because\nthere's someone else at work who's\nalways talking about how awesome they\nare and you don't want to be like that\nperson so you don't want to be perceived\nas a show-off so you don't share your\naccomplishments\nright and then what happens\nthen\nyour colleague\ngets promoted\nand then what do you do\nyou mauled\nright\nand then you start talking about\nhow biased\nand evil\nyour boss is\noh my god they're so biased\nsee this all the\ntime which may be true right so we're\nnot saying and this is the problem with\necho chambers on the internet is that\nlike\nsomeone will post this but like no one\nwill ever say like do you advocate for\nyourself\nright i'm not saying that that these\npredatory workplaces don't exist i'm not\nsaying that these employers are behaving\nproperly but what i'm saying is that\nlike in this scenario and what we tend\nto focus on is you so what are the\nemotional drivers at play\nthat force you into situations\nthat are unhealthy for you and actually\nhappen to be unhealthy for the employer\ngenerally speaking i believe maybe i'm\nwrong there i'm not an expert in\nbusiness\nokay so you don't want to be perceived\nas a show-off\nnow there's other kinds of weird things\nas well right so like you get guilt\ntrips so like you want to be a team\nplayer\nlike and so this is where the guilt\ntripping comes in\nthis isn't just employers right this is\nlike you have to be careful about the\nemotional driver of not feeling like an\n[ __ ]\nbecause that's a really powerful driver\nbecause you don't think of yourself as\nthe [ __ ] right the boss is the\n[ __ ] the corporation is the [ __ ]\ni'm not the [ __ ]\ntherefore if your boss comes to you and\nbegs you and by the way we see this\none-two punch all the way and all the\ntime in unhealthy environments that\none-two punch is guilt plus forcing and\nit's not just unhealthy work\nenvironments it's also like abusive\nrelationships so if you have like a\nnarcissistic parent or family member or\nthings like that they will both force\nyou and guilt you like at the same time\nso i've seen parents that will do things\nlike guilt their kid into coming home\nfor the holidays and then like there's\nthe cat there's the it's not even the\ncarrot it's like one kind of stick and\nanother kind of stick and by the way if\nyou don't come home for the holidays i'm\nnot gonna pay for your college anymore\n[ __ ]\nand then you're like and i'm so lonely\nlike i've done so much for you i'm\npaying for your college\nand if you're not gonna like come home\nfor the holidays like i can't believe i\ndo so much for you like i can't believe\nthat you wouldn't even come home like\ndon't you realize how like alone i am\nlike i've done everything for you i've\nsacrificed for you and how dare you try\nto have a life outside of me and by the\nway if you're not gonna like you know\nsacrifice for me like if your friends\nare more important to\nyou than i am then maybe i have other\nthings that are more important to me\nthan you are\nright it's like there's this weird\none-two punch of begging you to take\nthese extra shifts and forcing you to do\nso\nso watch out for the emotional driver of\nguilt trip right and like you're not\nbeing an [ __ ]\nby setting a limit to someone it\ncertainly feels that way\nbut be aware of that emotional driver\nokay\nnext thing\nso\nthe\nhidden\ntracking i don't know what to call this\nof\nrays versus fire\nso internally we have this weird little\ncomplex\nthat is always trying to figure out are\nwe going to get raised are we going to\nget raised are we going to get promoted\nare we going to get fired because no one\never like keeps score right like the\nscore is not kept really above board\nlike you don't know when you have\nstrikes you don't know when you have\ncheck marks so let's say let you know\nthere's three check marks\nin order to get a raise we need three\ncheck marks\nright\nand then in order to get fire we need\nthree x's\nbut no one ever tells you like which of\nthese you have and which of these you\ndon't have so there's just this guessing\ngame going on so this is all like behind\nyou know\nyou can't see what's going on here\nso a lot of times in these particular\nsituations like if we go back to this\nthis example where the person is saying\nthey're told in the interview by the way\nyou have to work 11 hour days and\nthere's a bunch of unpaid work after\nthat you have to do\nwhat this person is thinking is this is\nlike a subtle test right there's a check\nmark at play like if i set a boundary or\neven ask a question this person is going\nto think oh my god i'm not a team player\nand then i will be one step closer to\nnot being hired or being fired or not\ngetting promoted right because we all\nwant approval\nand then similarly for each of these\ndifferent things that this person is\nbeing asked to do drive people home\nyou know come in six days a week what\nthey're thinking in their mind is like\nis this going to move me towards\npromotion\nand what's really devastating for people\nis that they will do all kinds of stuff\ngunning for promotion\nright but since it's all opaque they\nactually don't know they're like i'm\ngonna make this sacrifice\nsacrifice one\nand then sacrifice two and then\nsacrifice three but like since i don't\nwant to be perceived as a show-off i'm\nsort of quietly making these sacrifices\nand not really like advertising it\nbecause i don't want to seem greedy and\nthen when promotion time\npromotion time comes around someone else\ngets promoted and then you feel\nresentful\nor frustrated\nand this is where the the journey ends\nso now what do you do with this\nresentment or frustration you tend to\nquit\nor swallow it\nand keep going\nwhat people don't do is like share some\nkind of feedback with their boss right\nwe don't go up to our boss and we don't\nsay hey by the way i've been working\nreally hard and i've been actually going\nthe extra mile and being a team player\nand i'm like i don't understand why this\nperson was promoted because based on my\nexperience i actually work way more than\nthey do\nright so we don't say things like that\nwe don't air things out to our boss now\nthat doesn't mean that maybe that person\nis doing all kinds of stuff so that\nyou're not aware of that is the reason\nthat they got promoted but it's i think\nit's completely reasonable to share that\nkind of stuff with your boss\nthe key thing here though is that you\nknow until you start acknowledging\nthese emotional drivers\nthat drive these unhealthy boundaries\nand put you in situations that are\npredatory this kind of thing is going to\nkeep happening\nyou can keep job hunting and should you\nquit this kind of job like absolutely\nright so there's like i think you should\nquit and try to go find another job by\nall means\nbut be careful because the next time\naround when you're in one of these jobs\nand someone tries to push a boundary\nlike it's okay to do things outside of\nyour role like even now today i do\nthings that are outside of my role\nyou know we have like that's actually\npretty normal for like a pretty healthy\nfunctioning workplace\nbut over time what you want is like some\namount of compensation for that\nacknowledgement of that or like you know\nhow we can do things that hg is like\nsomeone does something outside of their\nrole and they do it for a while and\nthey're like you know this is actually\nreally frustrating like okay so it\nsounds like we really need to hire a\nperson to take that off your plate so\nthat you can focus on your job that's\nhow it should go\nat a company\nright\nand so this kind of thing is happening\nall the time\num\nand\nif we don't want to fall into this trap\nof modern slavery it really comes with\nsetting healthy boundaries\nsetting healthy boundaries in turn\nhas to do with understanding why we\ndon't set healthy boundaries so there\nmay be some degree of of power dynamics\nat play but a big part of it tends to be\nconflict avoidance\nand especially the the conflict\navoidance that you're concerned about\nhas to do with emotional drivers\nand those being you know\nwanting to be perceived as a certain way\nyou don't want to be perceived as greedy\nyou don't want to be a show-off you want\nto be a team player you don't want to\nlike feel guilty right so the avoidance\nof that feeling of guilt results in you\nmaking a sacrifice and if you're in an\nunhealthy work environment your employer\nis not going to recognize that and it\nnot acknowledge it or you know won't\npromote you or something i mean\nhopefully at least there's an\nacknowledgment of some kind\nyou know and sometimes the\nacknowledgment is like ridiculous\nso like i remember hearing during the\npandemic you know some ceo of a hospital\nsystem got a 16 million dollar bonus\nand all of the residents in that same\nhospital system got a thank you cap\nthey got a hat\nand it's like one guy's making 16\nmillion dollars in the residents who are\nlike on the front lines taking care of\npatients or getting caps\nthis is ridiculous\nright\nso\num\nand then a couple of other things to\nkeep in mind are that\nin your mind be aware of what if you're\nkeeping this hidden tracker\nof am i on track for a promotion or am i\non track to get fired\nand like how much does that fear\nof not getting promoted or striving to\nbe promoted\nor you know\nnot getting fired how much does that\ninfluence whether you let other people\nlike\ncross your boundaries\nand then lastly as you start to\nbuild up negative emotions from the\nresult of numbers one through four\nyou're going to end up with resentment\nand frustration how do you manage that\nresentment and frustration do you just\nlet it build up and quit do you offer\nfeedback to your boss and say hey this\nis not really working for me or i'm very\nunhappy here\nwhat do you think is going to happen\nor do you swallow it and keep going\nbecause generally speaking the two\nthings that people do is this and this\nwhereas what they should be doing is\nhave a conversation\nthis is where you may say but if i have\na conversation like nothing is going to\nchange and that's what like now hold on\na second i i think you got to be careful\nthere because it's possible that nothing\nmay change you may be at a work\nenvironment where people are completely\nunresponsive to your feedback and they\ndon't care what you think and in that\ncase you should absolutely quit and\npeople may say okay if i quit how do i\nfind a different job this is what you\nsay when you go into your next job you\nall ready for it you guys want to get a\ngood job out of this situation how you\nturn this situation into a good job here\nit is\nhi\nmy name is\nmad for money\ni'm a dedicated hard worker and i'm a\nteam player why did i leave my last job\nso i started out working 11 hour days\nand then i found out that you know\npeople need to transport two and four\nfrom work so i actually went ahead and\ndid that\nand then a couple people quit and my\nboss asked me to like lift more and i\nwas actually happy to do that so for one\nweek i started working six days a week\n11 hour shifts i'm a dedicated worker\ni'm a team player\nand the boss started making that regular\nand i wasn't comfortable with that so\ni'm happy to be a team player i'm happy\nto be a hard worker i'm happy to go the\nextra mile but i'm looking for a place\nthat will reward\nthat kind of behavior\ninstead of take advantage of it and\nthat's why i left my last employer\nand then you can ask them set boundaries\nthen and there\nhow do you treat employees who go the\nextra mile do they get compensated more\ndo they get promoted more do they get\nraises\nor do they get treated the same\nyou can ask them and then like this is\nan interview right it's not just one way\nbecause when you come into that office\nlike that you are an employee that\npeople want\nright like\nyou are someone that they want like you\nwant someone who's gonna go the extra\nmile and so you're interviewing them too\nand so you can say like like if i go the\nextra mile like how have you rewarded\nemployees in the past and this is when\nthe employer starts [ __ ] themselves\nbecause if they haven't done that\nthey're well like we've done this and\nthis okay\nright but i can guarantee you this like\ni guess i can't guarantee it but they're\nnot going to walk out of that interview\nthinking you're under qualified in a\npushover\ndoes that make sense like\nthey may think you're an [ __ ] they\nmay think you're hard to work with\nbut you've demonstrated you can say like\nlook i'm a hard worker i just want to be\nfairly compensated like that's all\nyou know and i'm happy to go the extra\nmile but like i expect you know like i\ndon't want to be in a place where people\nare going to take advantage of that i\nwant to be in a place where people\nreward that kind of behavior\nso that that's like you have to be\ncareful about your phrasing right so you\ndon't want to like go too far down the\nevery every extra minute that i work i\nwant one cent extra\nso that kind of thing i don't think is\ngenerally speaking what employers want\nbut\nabsolutely sort of pointing out that\nyou're someone who's looking to be like\nrewarded for going the extra mile is\nlike fantastic\nright so yeah and this is where people\nare like kind of commenting oh like\nno one wants to work like no people\nactually want to work do you guys get\nthat this is the biggest\nthis is the biggest problem right now is\nthat people are like getting confused\nemployers are getting confused people\nwant to work people want to do things\nwith meaning\nright they like want to be productive\nlike humans like being productive\nthey just don't want to be taken\nadvantage of for working\nthat's all\nright there's not a labor shortage\nthere's a wage shortage like you're\nworking you're getting three dollars a\nthree euro and sixty\nthree point six euro per hour of work\nplus tips and you're doing all this\nextra work and like this is what's gonna\nhappen you're gonna burn through all of\nyour good employers employees if you're\nan employer like that\nand there are good places to work like\nthose places exist\nlast time i checked actually google was\none of those places\nyou know you don't hear like here's like\nthe two of opposite ends of the spectrum\nright some places you have like this\nwhere people are working a lot google's\nlike we're going to keep our office open\n24 hours a day you can commute if you\nwant to you cannot come if you don't\nwant to by the way we want you in the\noffice because we've noticed that like\nmaybe it's good if you're in the office\nso we're going to give you a bunch of\nfree good food there's going to be a\nchef\nthat you can you know they'll fix you\nwhat you want here's our menu like we're\ngonna try to make your work and there's\na gym here so we want you to like take\ncare of yourself and we're actually\nwilling to put our money where our mouth\nis so instead of saying yeah like we're\na company that values employee wellness\nright google's like we'll give you a gym\nand a chef\nyou know it's\nso you know i think that this is the\nkind of situation where like i think\nthis is good like i think it's healthy\nbecause all these sort of\nbasically unsustainable\nnon-survival of the fittest\nkind of like employers are gonna go bust\nright and like\nthey're not they're not entitled to\nexist like\nwe're talking about a free market system\nlike\nemployers that can't con enough people\nare so bad\nat conning people into jobs like and\npeople start quitting like they should\nquit\nyou"
