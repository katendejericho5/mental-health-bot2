    "transcript": "here i am telling you how to get control\nof your mind and what does your mind do\nquick quick bring out the memes bring\nout the memes don't listen to what he's\nsaying distract everyone start counting\nstart counting oh my god oh my god we\nhave to count count count anything but\nbut listening to this oh my god\nokay\nso currently writing uh how to overcome\nescapism so currently writing this on a\nbreak at my job but i desperately need\nhelp i've been watching dr k for the\npast year now and every video has been\nsuper helpful and eye-opening for me\ni've taken it all in and understood but\ni'm here facing my problems once again\nand i want to run away again\nmy problem is ever since i began working\nat an early age i've had difficulty\nholding a job as i get got older it got\nfar worse and i'm worried about being a\nburden and not being able to take care\nof myself\ni'm currently 26 before i used to work\nfull day shifts every day i was\nscheduled and be able to buy the things\ni wanted and take care of myself\nfast forward to now i'm deep in debt and\ncan barely stay on the job for more than\nan hour and quit because my brain just\ncan't handle it it assigns too much\nvalue to gaming and sleeping and hanging\nwith friends on discord or watching\nanime i feel like every time i confront\nthis major issue i always run away\nthankfully with amazon i can quit\nwhenever and join whenever but i can't\nkeep doing this i need to start paying\nmy own insurance among among myself and\ni want to get out of debt my mind seems\nto spiral out of control and i want to\nrun home and be comfortable in my bubble\ni managed to survive day one yesterday\nbut i fear i won't last much longer\nall of dr k's videos just out my brain\nand i\nwhen i get here\nhelp\nokay\nso this is um\nunfortunately a pretty common problem\nright so i'm going to try to summarize\nwhat i hear or what what i'm sort of\npicking up from this\nso sometimes in life\nwe feel paralyzed by\nour minds so we know that there are\nthings that we have to do we know we\nneed to like get our stuff in order\nright\nbut\ndespite the fact that like there are\nthings that we know we need to be doing\nour mind wants nothing more than to run\naway from our problems\nand so what a lot of people may think is\nthat\nokay if i like if my mind if i want to\nrun away to my from my problems like how\ndo i find the root cause of this right\nso a lot of people i mean not this is\nthe what we've advocated so here at he\nwhat we've advocated is that you know if\nyou're struggling to overcome escapism\nin your life that you do a lot of\nintrospective work you dig down really\ndeep and you find the root of it are you\nafraid of failure are you afraid of\ncommitment like what's the deep-rooted\nfear that you can kind of fix\nto overcome this escapism\nand so i think that's really useful\num but i think that sometimes if you're\nin this situation\nthe best thing to do is not actually to\ntry to overcome the like the emotional\nroute of escapism but the best thing to\ndo is actually learn how to train your\nmind so let's take a quick look at this\nokay\nso what i want y'all to like first start\nby looking at is you know\nand this happens to everyone right our\nmind doesn't always work for us and this\nis what makes life really really hard is\nthat our mind isn't working for our\nbenefit it has its own\ngoals and aspirations and desires and\nthen we can get super stuck because we\nhave particular goals and desires and\nour mind has particular goals and\ndesires and we're not working towards\nthe same thing\nso as long as our mind is not working\nfor us life is like super super hard\nyou're kind of handicapped because\nthere's a major\nyou know component part of your body\nyour mind there's a part of your being\nthat is supposed to be used for your\nbenefit which is kind of often doing\nwhatever whatever it wants to\nand like i said sometimes the solution\nto that is to go into the mind\nand try to fix something on deep inside\nthe mind\nso that the mind starts functioning\nproperly and sometimes the solution is\nactually not to like fix the mind but to\nget control of the mind so even if the\nmind is afraid of escape\nafraid of consequences afraid of failure\nwants to escape we can actually control\nit and tell it to do what we want it to\ndo so i'm going to take a quick look at\nthis post and we'll just sort of notice\nthis okay\nso um\nso i've taken it all in and understood\nit but here i am facing my problems once\nagain and i want to run away\nso my problem is that i i've had\ndifficulty holding a job right so that\nlike what does that exactly mean like\nwhat's going on in your mind\num i used to work full shifts and be\nable to buy the things that i wanted but\nand take care of myself but now i can't\ni'm deep in debt can barely stay on the\njob for more than an hour and quit\nbecause my brain just can't handle it\nthis is a sign of your mind or your\nbrain controlling you as opposed to the\nother way around and this person has\neven had some amount of insight right it\nassigns too much value to gaming and\nsleeping and hanging with friends on\ndiscord or watching anime so this is\nlike where this person is noticing and\nthis is awesome because this is what our\nwhat we want from our community right we\nwant you to notice what your mind is\ndoing\nbut every time i i confront this major\nissue i always run away right and then\nthis person goes on to say thankfully i\ncan quit whenever i want to and join\nwhenever but i can't doing this this is\nnot something to be thankful for\nright so you've found a job at amazon\nthat\ncan tailor to the desires of your\nescapist mind so you've even structured\na life for yourself\nthat allows you to be escapist\nright because then you you you what does\nyour mind tell you it says oh there's no\nreal consequence of quitting this job\nright i can get it back whenever i want\nto so we can just we can procrastinate\ntoday you can just quit today you could\ntake a week off playing on\nplaying games and watching anime and\nthings like this and then i can just get\nthe job next week and so in a weird way\nthis job is almost like\nenabling your escapist mentality right\nso we have to be super careful about\nwhat we're grateful for but of course\nyou're grateful for it because you're\nlike oh like now i don't actually have\nexternal consequences that force me to\naction and if i don't have external\nconsequences that force me to action\nthen i can continue like sort of being\nescapist and it's like not that big of a\ndeal\nright and so my mind seems to spiral out\nof control and i want to run home and be\ncomfortable in my bubble so normally\nwhen i take this kind of\nwhen i look at this kind of post i would\ntalk about things like oh you know\nwhere is the source of your escapism\nwhat's going on we can maybe do that\ndown down the road\nbut what i really want to talk to y'all\nwhat i really want to talk to you all\ntoday about today is getting control of\nyour mind\nand\ni know it sounds kind of weird but like\nwe don't actually control our mind right\nso our mind kind of does what it wants\nto like for example i have patients who\nhave ocd so obsessive compulsive\ndisorder\nand their mind will produce all kinds of\nthoughts that they don't want\nso our mind values particular things it\ntells us to stay away from particular\nthings it does all kinds of stuff that\nyou know like isn't necessarily under\nour control\nand so one of the key things that i want\nto share with you all today is how to\nget control of your mind\nand um because this is something that\nit's kind of weird but just in the same\nway that you can train your fingers to\nplay piano or you can train your palate\nto you know taste different things or\nyou can train your legs to be able to\nrun or your cardiovascular system to be\nable to run you can even there are\npeople who are free divers right that\nwill train their body to hold their\nbreath for like 10 minutes at a time see\nwe can train all manner of different\nparts of ourself and one of the things\nthat we really don't get taught how to\ntrain is our mind so what i'm going to\nshare with you guys today is nothing\nabout like sort of fixing the internal\npart of the mind so let's say here's our\nmind\nand in the mind there's something you\nknow there's something bad in here this\nis the fear of escapism down here and so\nwhat a lot of times what we try to do at\nhealthy gamers we try to teach you okay\nhow do i take that fear of escapism and\nkind of solve it within the mind so that\ni'm no longer controlled by that fear\nwhereas instead what we're going to work\non today is we're not going to do\nanything inside the mind we're going to\nlearn how to control it from the outside\nright so we're going to learn how to get\nour mind into shape and it can think\nwhatever it wants to in on the inside it\ncan it can have ocd in here it can have\ndepression in here it can have escapism\nin here it can have whatever whatever\nyou want in here\nand i know this sounds kind of weird but\nlike\ni've even had success with this\nespecially with psychosis and psychotic\ndisorders so these are people like for\nexample with schizophrenia or\nschizoaffective disorder and they're\nhallucinating they're delusional and\nwhat we've sort of discovered in\npsychiatry is you can't like really fix\nthe delusion inside the mind or it's\nvery difficult to so when i'm sort of\nworking with patients who have psychosis\nor\nare delusional instead of trying to fix\nthe thing inside the mind what i train\nthem to do\nis get control of the mind as a whole\nokay\nso then the question becomes okay how do\nyou get control of the mind as a whole\nand so this is something that i've\nsteered a little bit clear of but i\nhonestly think it's like one of the most\nuseful concepts that i've ever learned\nthe reason i've steered clear from it is\nbecause i don't have good scientific\nsupport for it so i tend to steer clear\nof some of the more spiritual ideas that\nare not scientifically supported but you\nknow i think it's the best answer\nso what i'm going to share with you all\ntoday is the idea of the gunas\nso in the yogic\nconception of the world there are three\ngunas or qualities\nand those are\ntamas\nrajas\nand sattvas\nit's kind of weird but what they\nbasically what the yogis did in ancient\nindia\nis\nbasically classify all things into these\nthree buckets so these are the\nfundamental qualities so tamas is that\nwhich is\ninert\nslow\ndull\nokay rajas is that which is active\npassionate\ndynamic\nand satvas is balanced\ncalm\nkind of equilibrium\nso i know it sounds kind of weird like\nbut they just sort of said if you look\nat all manner of things you can\nbasically divide them into these three\nqualities so they looked at things like\nfood\nso some foods will lead to inertness\nslowness or dullness some foods will be\nactive\nlike engage passion or will make you\nmore dynamic and some foods will make\nyour mind like calm and balanced and\nlike sort of help you attain equilibrium\nand so if you look at the diets of monks\nso like the monk diet\ndoesn't really matter where you are\nright so like you can look at catholic\nmonks you can look at buddhist monks you\ncan look at hindu monks essentially all\nof them are going to have a more sativic\ndiet\nso there are foods that we can eat that\nwill sort of encourage this kind of\nthing but it's not just foods because\nyou can look at like discussions on the\ninternet right so there are going to be\nsome communities\nwhich are going to push their\num so let's talk about communities\nso there's some communities which are\ngoing to lead to inertness in your life\nright so like\nif you hang out with these people\nthey're going to make you feel kind of\nlike dull and inert like your life is\ngoing to be like sort of a blur there\nare some communities that will make you\nfeel active and passionate right so like\npolitically active communities you know\nregardless of what you kind of agree or\ndisagree with but like if you look at\nprotesters right so protesters are not\nbalanced and calm they're like very\nactive and passionate and dynamic and\nyou know things like that so like\nthere's some communities that will make\nyou dull and inert some things will sort\nof activate you and sort of engage your\npassion and some things will sort of\ncalm you down and sort of like\nhelp you attain balance and equilibrium\nright so there's like\nit's kind of weird but they sort of like\nlooked at the world and they were like\nokay these are the three buckets of\nstuff\nand so if you're someone who's kind of\nstuck in your life like can't get\ncontrol of your mind\nwhat we really want you to do is move\nfrom thomas to rajas first and rajas to\nsaatvas eventually i'm not going to go\ninto too much more detail but this is\nsort of like the goal of what we're\ntrying to do here okay\nso then the question is okay so how do i\nget control of my mind so now i'm gonna\nnow we're gonna get to how to control it\nokay so what we're gonna do is kind of a\nlinear process where we're going to\nstart with one thing that will enable us\nto do the other thing which will enable\nus to do the next thing\nso the first thing is if you want to\nyour mind wants so here's you\nand here's your mind\nand you guys fight\nright\nso\nand this is something in order to\novercome your mind you need something\ncalled willpower\nso the first question is how do i get\nwillpower right like how what's\nsomething that i can do to improve my\nwillpower so i did a really interesting\nstudy i don't remember the citation\nwhere they looked at teenagers in high\nschool\nand looked at their sugar consumption\nand what they essentially found is that\nhow unhealthy teenagers eat is\ninfluenced by lots of different things\nright so your environment and things\nlike that but there's one variable which\nis quickly changeable which will almost\ninstantly alter your dietary habits this\ncan anyone guess what's the one thing\nthat you can do to eat healthier\nanyone know\nit's not availability\nah very good\nsleep excellent\nokay so willpower is a diminishing\nresource\nthat's number one we know this okay so\nif you guys have heard me talk about the\nbeat versus cookie study so i'll quickly\nuh\nexplain this study i won't go into too\nmuch detail\nso a group of psychologists basically\nwanted to measure willpower\nand what they did is they took two\nparticipants so group number one and\ngroup number two and in group number one\nthey were in a waiting room and they\nthey put a tray of boiled beets in front\nof them and then the\nin the other group they put a tray of\nfreshly baked chocolate chip cookies\nand they the people were given the\nexplicit instruction you are not allowed\nto eat this this is for the people\nthere's like a party after after we're\ndone with this research study so this is\nthat we're just like putting the stuff\nin the room you cannot eat it no eating\nokay\nso thankfully no one no one was a\ndegenerate and ate it anyway so every no\none everyone followed the instructions\nbut then the real test came afterward so\nafterward they go into a room and\nthey're faced with an\nimpossible task\nand they basically saw\nhow long until people like gave up to uh\nuh on the task so like when like you\nknow how much willpower could they exert\nto force themselves into the situation\nand what they found is that the\nwillpower\nwas lower with the cookie group than it\nwas with the the beat group\nokay and so what they sort of\nessentially concluded and based on this\nthere have been other studies that have\nbeen done is that like when you're\nresisting the cookies you're actually\nburning your willpower resource and then\nyou kind of run out of willpower faster\nthan other people\nokay so where does willpower how do we\nregenerate it we regenerate with sleep\nso if you want to control your mind the\nfirst thing the most important thing\nthat you can do is sleep\nokay so quick tips we had a whole\nlecture on sleep recently i think it was\neven like close to two hours or\nsomething so definitely go watch that\nbut i would say you know the key thing\nto remember is um waking up\nis easier than going to sleep\nbecause you can like you can force\nyourself to wake up right and then you\ncan have caffeine if you really need it\nthat's okay and then you kind of like\nyou know spend your day just kind of\nchilling or whatever wait until you're\nexhausted at night and then you know you\ncan fall asleep so i i like to also have\na heavy meal before sleep\num we're going to teach you guys a\ntechnique called shavasana today is\nmeditation\nand then the other thing that you can do\nbefore sleep is audiobook helps a lot\nlike there's other things like weighted\nblankets\netc but the first thing that you've got\nto do is get your sleep under control\nand i don't mean sleep perfectly every\nsingle day i mean that the more you can\nimprove your sleep the more willpower\nyou're going to have and the more\nwillpower you're going to have the\neasier it's going to be to do number two\nso now you've slept let's say like you\nwork on it for like three or four days\nyou're able to sleep one more hour per\nnight that's like more restful like\nwe're not saying you have to fix\neverything but it's tough for like a\ncouple days you get into the routine so\njust start with sleep okay that's number\none\nnumber two\nis food\nso what the yogis sort of discovered is\nthat the simplest way to have a more\nbalanced mind a less thomasic mind and\nby the way giving into escapism is like\na thumbstick mind right so what do i\nmean by that it means that\nthe escapist mentality leads to dullness\nand inertness it moves you to inaction\nso you're just sitting at home playing\nvideo games instead of working right so\nwhat we want to do is like remove thomas\nfrom our life so if you're like if you\nhave motivational problems the less dom\nsick you become the better off you're\ngoing to be okay\ni use this a lot in clinical practice\nbut there's not good science behind it\nthere's some good science actually\nthere's some science but it's it's\nyou know it's a little bit of a stretch\nso adjust your food okay so this is\nwhere like now that we have a little bit\nmore willpower hopefully what we can do\nis make like a couple of healthier\nchoices i'm not saying go paleo i'm not\nsaying go keto you can do that if you\nwant to and you're able to but there's a\nlot of stuff that we can do for food\nthat will actually make our mind like\nmuch more light airy and like able to\nwork okay\nso here's just a couple of things so\nmove from cola to seltzer\nso we don't need that added sugar and\nstuff i'm not saying you can't have a\ncola from time to time but in general if\nyou regularly consume soda i'd say make\nthe shift to seltzer so what i've found\nwhen when trying to help people overcome\nlike\nsoda addiction basically\nis that the bubbles so like any time\nyou're trying to overcome an addictive\nbehavior you have to understand that\novercoming the addictive behavior\ninvolves multiple components so when i'm\ntrying to help people with smoking\ncessation\nit turns out that cigarettes are\naddictive for three reasons\nokay number one is the nicotine this\neveryone is aware of but here's the\nproblem here's where people trip up they\ndon't realize that nicotine or\ncigarettes are addicted for more for\nmore reasons than nicotine right so the\nsecond thing is that it gives people a\nbreak\nso people who smoke cigarettes will take\nlike smoke bricks and this is a huge\npart of like why like cigarettes are so\naddictive is like you step out of your\noffice like you step outside you like\nspend five minutes just like chilling\nrelaxing kind of like having fun\nsometimes it's also a source of like\nsocialization right so like you and your\ncoworkers go out for a smoke break\nthat's a huge part of the advantage of a\ncigarette the other thing that's kind of\ninteresting is that there's like uh\nwhat's this called there's a tactile\naddiction to to cigarettes\nit's kind of weird but a big part of\ncigarettes is like fiddling with your\nhands so what i find what i found is\nthat when people are like craving\nnicotine right so if you're like craving\nnicotine it's interesting because you\ncan give people gum that will like\nsupplement the nicotine you can give\nthem a patch that will supplement the\nnicotine but that doesn't cure the\ncigarette the smoking cessation right\ninstead like actually what you what you\nkind of discover is that like so\nreplacing the nicotine if we check this\nbox people still like relapse and\ncontinue smoking and why is that it's\nbecause smoking is doing more than just\nthe nicotine\nso there's the social aspect there's the\nlike taking a break like you know once\nan hour once every other hour to like go\noutside and like have a smoke um there's\nthe tactile addiction so oddly enough if\ni want to help someone stop smoking you\nknow i may give them nicotine gum sure\nbut a real plan also involves sunflower\nseeds\nright\nand like meditation breaks\nor walks\nand the most success i've had sort of\nhelping people overcome these is to like\ntarget all of the aspects of the\naddiction i know it sounds kind of\nbizarre but what i found really works\nwell is you tell people to carry around\nsunflower seeds and what they do is they\njust like\nlike sunflower seeds are really tactile\nlike you do something with your hands so\nthey'll do every two hours they'll go\noutside with a handful of sunflower\nseeds they'll crack them it's sort of\nlike this very like simple like\nmind-numbing kind of activity and\nthey'll like crack them they'll eat the\nsunflower seeds they'll you know spit\nout the shells and like something about\nstepping outside of your office every\ntwo hours chewing some nicotine gum\nwhich tastes awful and then like you\nknow you you spit the sunflower seeds\nand all that kind of stuff out somehow\nworks\nso in that same way if we're trying to\novercome cola addiction\nwhat we want to do is actually like\ndon't remove all the elements right so\nthere's the sweetness\nbut then the carbonation is actually a\nbig part of it\nthere's a there's just like a you you\nburp afterward and that kind of feels\nlike good in some ways and like you have\nit with food and it helps you burp\nespecially if you're eating unhealthy\nthings so there's like weird kind of\nphysiologic signals that you can sort of\ntake advantage of that's sort of a\ntangent in the like smoking association\nand stuff the first thing is like\nreplace cola with seltzer okay the thing\nis just like try to eat healthy stuff i\nknow it sounds like so simple\nand i know that we don't give you guys\nconcrete solutions so we're gonna kind\nof do that today so another like example\nis just like apples and peanut butter so\ni think the key to\nor another kind of nut butter\nthe key to like starting to eat a little\nbit more satwik or a little bit more\nlike balancing or healthier is to make\nsmall changes that are not don't require\na whole lot of willpower now you have a\nlittle bit more willpower from the sleep\nbut apples and peter but it's like\ndelicious it'll like fill you up for a\nwhile it'll increase your satiety it'll\nbe healthy\ni'm not saying you have to use the\norganic stuff to start right by all\nmeans like get some peanut butter with\nsalt in it like it's not that big of a\ndeal\num i've already talked about oatmeal\nbefore but i think oatmeal is like one\nof the most op meals that you can eat\nthat's quite sathvic\nright so oatmeal is going to be high in\nfiber\nand you can make it taste delicious\nlike with maple syrup\nberries\ncinnamon or you can go for a savory\noatmeal which i i didn't you know this\nwas a big discovery\nsoy green onion\ntomato\nand sesame oil\nyou'd be surprised it's almost like a\ncongee kind of thing\nso like this is where you know you just\nstart to make like a couple of changes\nand it's like what's your what's your\nlike alternative to this right is like\nyou're gonna go get like a breakfast\nsandwich from like a a fast food\nrestaurant that's gonna be incredibly\nthompson i'm going to slow you down make\nyou sluggish and you're screwed for the\nrest of the day\nright i know it's bizarre the savory\noatmeal really catches people like some\npeople think that this is like you're\ninsane if you do this but you don't\nalways want to eat something sweet and\nthis is like\nthing is like this is delicious food\nokay\nand i'm going to give you guys my last\none my last satwik thing\nokay\nthat i haven't disclosed to y'all before\nbutternut squash soup\nthis is the most opi like oatmeal and\nbutternut squash soup i think are the\nmost op\nmeals that you can make\nso like butternut squash soup is like\nit's delicious i kid you not and maybe\nwe'll do like a cooking stream or\nsomething one day\nbasically you just take a butternut\nsquash you chop it in half you drizzle\nit with olive oil and salt you stick it\nin the oven you roast it\nthen what you do is you like scoop out\nall the squash which is now soft you\nstick it in a pot actually before you\nstick it in a pot you take oil\ngarlic\nonions\nright so you like fry that up for a\nlittle bit this is actually a little bit\nthompson\ngarlic and onions but you know what\nwe're getting there\nraj sick a little bit it's healthy for\nyour heart so there's good you know\nthere's good advantages to it and you\ntoss all that stuff in there you can put\nin whatever else you want to you can put\nin\ncelery you can put in tomatoes\ni see you're clear of things like potato\nbut you can stick some of that stuff in\nthere you just cook it for a while you\ncan stick that stuff in the blender and\nyou can blend it up and then you like\nseason it right so the cool thing about\nsoup is like you can add all kinds of\nstuff so i'll put a little bit of salt\nin there smoked paprika goes a long way\nit's going to have a lot of natural\nsweetness from the squash and the onions\nso you don't need any sugar i don't put\ncream and crap like that i know a lot of\nrecipes will like add cream but like no\nyou just like it's like a vegetable soup\nthat's just amazing it's like and then\na squeeze of lime\nif you want to go crazy you can put some\nstuff like cumin or garam masala or\nthings like that but i think just\nbasically with this stuff pepper\nyou can even stick a jalapeno in there\nif you want to like this is delicious\nyou can also freeze some of this stuff\nif you want to right so like you cook\nthis stuff and like it tastes amazing\nand you're getting like\nyou know tons of nutrients and\nvegetables and stuff like that and that\nwill actually help you a lot so it'll\nlike clean out your mind okay\nthere's also a lot of stuff that we've\ntalked about you can find out this all\nin dr k's guide about\ngut brain health right so when you start\nto eat some of these things it forms\nhealthy gut bacteria and as you form\nhealthy gut bacteria they make\nneurotransmitter precursors and as you\nmake neurotransmitter precursors like\ntryptophan and stuff like that it can\nactually theoretically boost your\nserotonin level and things like that so\nlike there's a lot of like science\nbehind some of this stuff\nbut now that we have good sleep we can\neat good food\nonce we start to eat good food and our\nmind becomes less thomsic from that\nangle\nthen what we're gonna do is number three\nget out of the house\nokay just get out of the house now i\nknow that weather permitting and\ndepending on where you are this may not\nlike if you're in like ontario or like\nmichigan or something it may be hard to\nlike get out of the house but as best as\nyou can like literally get out of the\nhouse so even if it's going to a store\nor like whatever like try as best as you\ncan try to get out of the house or get\nout of your room or do whatever you can\nif if it's freezing outside you can't do\nthat you know maybe you can't do that\nnow but at least then when it starts to\nwarm up do the best that you can\nthere's all kinds of important stuff\nthat happens here that's like\nphysiologic we've talked about this\nbefore so plant aerosols\nare really good for mood\nparticularly anxiety\nthere's all kinds of other stuff like\neye accommodation\nso our our eyes if you think about the\nway that our eyes evolved they did not\nevolve to look at things that were like\nthree feet in front of me all day long\nso you actually have these things called\nyour ciliary muscles which cause your\neyes to contract and or well the ciliary\nmuscles contract and so that alters the\nshape of your your lens and your focal\nlength and then you kind of like are\nlooking at close by so the default\nposition for your eye is not like three\nfeet away it's actually like further\naway so you want to relax your ciliary\nmuscles um by walking outside that's\nlike literally all it takes is then your\neyes will naturally relax they'll focus\non far things this can do all kinds of\nthings like reduce headache\nthere's just all kinds of good stuff um\nthere's some evidence that it actually\nimproves vision over time\nbut that's a bit\nit's like correlative evidence and\ncross-sectional\nso we're not really sure about that but\nget out of the house right so you'll get\nsome fresh air and things like that you\nalso get moving\nso we don't want to be like sedentary\nokay\nso the next thing that we're going to do\nso now that we've gotten out of the\nhouse and we've gotten a little bit\nrefreshed we can actually do what most\npeople are expecting which is meditation\nand yoga\nso what i'm going to recommend is 20\nminutes of meditation practice a day\nand i'd start with alternate nostril\nbreathing\nand then do ohm chanting\nnow you can mix it up if you want to but\nif you're if you're coming from the\ninternet and this is your first exposure\nto us these are the two things that i\nwould recommend once again there's a\nwhole module about this in dr k's guide\nto mental health we teach you everything\nthat you're going to need to know about\nmeditation there but these are the two\nthings that i do like 10 minutes each\nnext thing that i'm going to say is 10\nminutes\nyou can do more if you want to of surya\nnamaskar\nso this is a set of 10 yoga postures\nthat'll like super balance you out right\nso at the end of the day like this all\nof this stuff is only like an hour to a\nday like cooking a meal getting out of\nthe house and doing 30 minutes of\nmeditation and yoga is like an hour a\nday\nor sorry two hours a day let's say\nand so the interesting thing here is\nlike this is what it takes to get your\nget control of your mind\nand if we go back to like this post what\nwe find is that\num\nyou know like there's a lot of stuff\nhere where like i can quit and join i\nneed to start doing this my mind seems\nto spiral out of control i want to run\nhome and be comfortable in my bubble\nlike all of these things like you're\nlosing to your mind like sure we can try\nto fix\nwhatever is inside the mind we can try\nto fix this if we want to but if we just\nget control of the mind as a whole you\ndon't have to even overcome your fear of\nescapism there's a part of your mind\nthat will want to escape and you'll just\nbe like yeah we're not going to do that\ntoday\nyou don't even have to fix it you can\njust have it you can still like want to\nescape and it won't work like you'll\njust\nonce you're in control of your mind once\nyour willpower is there once you're more\nsativic and more balanced you'll be able\nto resist your desires better\nnow on to a couple of advanced things\nokay so for those of you because now i\nunderstand there are a lot of people in\nour community that do this right\napparently we've got a bunch of oatmeal\neaters in chat so if you guys want more\nadvanced stuff to discipline your mind\neventually you can absolutely go you\nknow you can increase your meditation\ntime and things like that but i'm going\nto give you guys other practices so\nobviously you can sleep better you can\neat more scotic food you can cut out\nmeat if you want to\ncut out oh by the way marijuana and\nalcohol are both very very thompson\nliquor is actually a little bit more raj\nsick but\nyou know stimulates tend to be raj sick\nso you want to cut out all those\nsubstances too\nor the other way to put it is if you are\nusing those substances it makes sense to\nme that you're going to have trouble\ngetting control of your mind\nso other things that you can do if you\nreally want to control your mind\nother things you can do we've talked\nabout this before\nno devices\nin the toilet\nright when you go to a number two you're\njust gonna go in with no devices\nokay number two\nno devices\nwhile eating\nokay\nall right so\nlet's talk about this for a second so\nnotice first of all the rebellion\nright so what part of you is rebelling\nwhat part of you is like oh my god i can\neat oatmeal i can go to sleep on time i\ncan do 30 minutes of yoga\nbut you're telling me to not use my\nphone when i'm taking a dump\nlike look at the rebellion within you\nlike what are we talking about here\nright like what's the real cost to like\nnot\nusing your phone while you're in the\nbathroom\nor like not watching something while you\neat\nlike just notice that like that's really\nbizarre i'm not asking you to like\nyou know go into debt i'm not asking you\nto donate a kidney i'm not asking you to\nyou know adopt a child\ni'm not like there's no real like cost\nhere right and this is why i pick this\nso specifically because the only cost is\nlike\nyour mind rebelling like it's just your\nmind is like oh no we can't browse\nreddit for like five minutes while i'm\ntaking it down for 10 minutes so it's\nlike oh my god how cruel\nso this is a this is a really really\nprime example of like who's in control\nis it your mind or is it you now be\ncareful because if i say there's no cost\nwhat your mind is gonna do it's gonna be\nbut like look at all the productive\nstuff i can do\nlook at all i have so many i have so\nmuch anime to watch i have so many of\nthese youtube lectures on motivation to\nwatch while i eat it's me being\nproductive\nit's me being productive that's like the\nlast hallmark of the addicted mind is\nlike telling you some kind of good\nrationalization so it's like no no it\nwill cost you something no the marijuana\nis good for my insomnia and my anxiety\nno no we need we need it bro no like we\ndon't need it we're not like addicted\nbut like we need it\nno i'm sorry we don't need it but like\nthink about everything you're gonna lose\nif you don't get it that's what it is\nright that's the thought process\nright it's a we don't need it we're not\naddicted but it's just like think about\nthe efficiency the loss and efficiency\noh my god we can't be inefficient\noh sure like we can play video games for\neight hours a day but like we've got to\nuse those five minutes on the toilet to\nresearch jobs on linkedin which is not\nwhat you do anyway\nright\nso like these are the two things that if\nyou want to get control of your mind\njust like don't do devices while eating\nand this is the bizarre thing is once\nyou it feels really hard until you do it\nand once you actually do it like if you\nsit down with like let's say a bowl of\nlike butternut squash soup and you just\neat it without doing anything it tastes\namazing like you're gonna have a\nwonderful experience you're actually\ngonna enjoy you don't even need the\ndevice\nit feels actually really good like go\ngrab some apples and peanut butter it's\nkind of nice where i live because i'm\ni'm down south like in in the southern\nunited states but like i'm gonna step\noutside and and have some apples and\npeanut butter and like you just sit\noutside in your backyard and you're just\nkind of like enjoying yourself like it's\ngreat\nright so here are the advanced\ntechniques\nbecause as it turns out you know there\nare a lot of advanced people in our\ncommunity so you could try these two\nthings these are really great willpower\nbuilding exercises and generally\nspeaking we here at hg don't like you\nknow emphasize the willpower route but\nat the same time it is like a really\nimportant route\nwe sort of emphasize understanding so if\nyou guys want to get control of your\nmind here's how you do it\nright we can talk about the escapism and\nstuff like that so questions\nso you know people are asking about\nreading\nso notice notice the last bastion of the\nmind\nwhen all devices are removed can i read\ncan i read\nso\nthis is where like sure you can read you\nknow i think it's okay\nbut like why do you need to like do you\nreally need to read for that five or ten\nminutes there's like 24 hours in a day\nyou're sleeping for let's say like six\nto nine of them\nand like you need the it's like you poop\nmaybe once a day we're talking about\nlike a five minute loss here\nright\ndesperate to what like your mind so\nnotice that desperation notice how much\nyour mind craves stimulation so this is\nthe key thing to understand\nis that\nwhen you give in to that mind\nthat's the same thing is like quitting\nyour job and going home it assigns too\nmuch value to gaming and sleeping and\nhanging so like you don't want to give\nin to that value\nlike the more that you give in to what\nthe mind wants even in the smallest\nlittle way\nyou are creating a system where it's in\ncontrol\nso i'd say like don't do any of it and\nthen your mind is like but then what am\ni gonna do and you're like you're gonna\nbe bored for like five minutes it's\ngonna be 300 seconds count to 300 for me\nand then your mind is like\nbut if you literally want to know how do\ni get control of my mind there are some\nthings that it wants and you tell it no\nand then it\nwhines and weedles and tries to trick\nyou and if you let it trick you you're\nnot going to control it it's going to\ncontrol you\nbut if you you know\nif you do a good job it'll\nit'll listen\nand then over time it'll start listening\nmore and then you're going to tell it\nlike it's going to be like i want to\nplay a video game but now you've\npracticed right now it's trained so\nyou're going to say sorry we're not\ngoing to play a video game right now\nwe're gonna actually go exercise for an\nhour and then after we're done\nexercising then we're gonna play a video\ngame and then you will discover\nsomething miraculous\nwhich is after you train your mind to\nlisten to you and then you play the\nvideo game after exercising the video\ngame is actually more fun than if you\nwould have like once you like if you go\nwork out and then you feel like kind of\ntired and exhausted\nthe numbers\nif\nif your mind is like tired from working\nout like the game is gonna be more fun\ntoo\nokay\ncounting game yes look at how look at\nhow the mind latches on to that\nso notice what's happening now chat\nhere i am telling you how to get control\nof your mind and what does your mind do\nquick quick bring out the memes bring\nout the memes don't listen to what he's\nsaying distract everyone start counting\nstart counting oh my god oh my god we\nhave to count count count anything but\nbut listening to this oh my god\nquickly quickly the memes let's start so\nlet's let's say something funny\nyou see this we're now we're counting\nnumbers oh my god this is so funny let's\ndid we distract ourselves enough so that\nwe have to stay we can use the cell\nphone in the bathroom now did we\ndistract ourselves\ndid we forget what we were talking about\ndid we did it work\ndid it work\nquick count more count more oh my god oh\nmy god let's be funny and stop paying\nattention because that's what's\nhappening right you guys see that you're\nlike oh\nyour mind is like let's do this it's\ngonna be funny i'm gonna i'm gonna type\nthree and two\nso funny so funny so funny so funny now\ni'm going to type 33 oh my god it's so\nmuch fun\nand thus do we\nstop learning and start giving in to the\nmind's desire to like meme and entertain\nitself\nright\nokay\nquestions\nyeah so i'll summarize\nso let's go ahead and kind of do a quick\nsummary okay\nso\na lot of times when we're confronted\nwith things like escapism\nour goal is to fix the escapism on the\ninside of our mind right\nso people will say things like oh i'm\nyou know i want to escape\nand then the next thing that sort of\nhappens we can have we can be depressed\nwe can be anxious whatever our solutions\ntend to be\nto try to fix the inside of the mind so\nthat we no longer have to deal with it\nbut there's another pathway that we have\nwhich is to not fix what's on the inside\nof the mind but just get control of the\nmind as a whole so the mind does what we\nwant it to whether it feels a particular\nway or not so i'll give you guys kind of\nan example if i'm anxious about going to\na party\nwhat i can do is just i can try to deal\nwith my internal anxiety so i'm no\nlonger anxious going to the party or\nwhat i can do\nis just command my mind and say hey\nwe're gonna go to the party anyway it's\nokay if you're a little bit anxious like\nnot a big deal we're gonna do it anyway\nand then the mind will be like super\nsuper upset but if we've trained our\nmind properly it'll do it anyway so we\ndon't even need to be like we don't have\nto fix the inside of our mind we can\njust control it so controlling our mind\ninvolves understanding this concept of\nthe gunas which is what a lot of this\nstuff is baked into but this idea that\ndifferent kinds of activities or\nexercises or foods that we engage in\nwill make our mind more inert dull or\nslow more active passionate or dynamic\nor more balanced calmer in a state of\nequilibrium and so how do we do that it\nstarts with sleep once we sleep more or\nsleep healthier we're going to have more\nwillpower and then we can start making\nsome of the other changes that we need\nto make so if i had started by saying\nadjust your diet and you're not sleeping\nproperly like it's going to be hard to\nstick to a diet\nright so\nnow that we're sleeping properly we can\nmake easy adjustments to our diet we\ndon't want to eat like super untasty\nfoods we want to find light healthy\nfoods that also taste good so the three\nthings are moving to seltzer moving to\napples and peanut butter oatmeal\nbutternut squash soup these are just\nsome examples okay\nnow that we've eaten well\nso our mind is going to be a little bit\nmore compliant once it gets these kind\nof good healthy light foods so we're\ngoing to feel like you know because\nsometimes you just don't like i don't\nfeel like getting out of the house i\njust like feel i don't feel like it\nright and some of that sentiment that\nfeeling of not wanting to get out of the\nhouse actually has to do with diet\nbecause if you eat like crap you don't\nfeel like doing anything but if you eat\nlike healthy food you're gonna feel like\nmore energetic\nso then get out of the house\nand then once you're out of the house\nyou get a breath of fresh air then you\ncan start doing like meditation and yoga\nyou're gonna do 20 minutes of meditation\nand 10 minutes of yoga\nand then if you've done all that stuff\nyou've got the basics down you've got a\njob you do meditate every day if you're\nlike one of those chads\nthen you want to move on to hard mode\nthen you can do no devices in the toilet\nand no devices while eating like don't\nwatch anything while you're eating just\neat\nright and then then everyone goes to\nlike everyone's totally fine oh yeah\nlike eating oatmeal like i can handle\nthat but asking me to give up my device\nno no no and then what we see is that\nthe mind wants it right because what it\nwants to avoid is like oh my god like\ni need it i need it the mind wants it so\nso bad so that's how you get control of\nyour mind by doing limited things\nthat sort of make it easy for your mind\nto be more compliant right so this is\ngoing to shape this stuff up here is\ngoing to shape the mind and then as we\nmove down to the advanced techniques now\nthat the mind is more pliable you'll\nhave set up a situation where it will\nrequire less willpower because you'll be\nsleeping well eating well things like\nthat\nokay\nstep three become a buddha absolutely\nall right\nso someone's asking how do you deal with\nhours of boredom when you're so used to\nstimulation it's torture so you don't\nstart with hours you start with minutes\nright\nso like how do you deal with hours of\nboredom i'm not sure but here's the\nother thing if you get like tons of\nstimulation through technology for\nexample you're bored anyway you're just\nstimulated and bored and you're dull and\nbored you're like thumb sick and\nstimulated it's like terrible right so\nyou start by by like small amounts of\ncalculated withdrawal from like\nstimulating stuff\nstart small\nit's like how do you lift a hundred\npounds you start by lifting five\nsame way you do anything in life\nuh so is listening to music when leaving\nthe house fine yeah sure listen to music\nit's okay\ndo that for a while and then\nyou know\ntry not listening to music and see which\none you prefer\nokay\nall right\nokay\nso is someone saying hi doctor i'm a\nneat what do you do this\nstart with this\nright this is where like then your mind\nwill be in a state to do the other\nthings\nokay\nyou"
