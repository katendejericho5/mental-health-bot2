    "transcript": "so the first thing that i kind of want\nto talk a little bit about in terms of\nsleep is i don't know if you all know\nthis but we have a lot of information\nabout sleep right\nso\nif we look kind of statistically\nthis is\nthis the level of scientific advancement\nin the world is at an all-time high at\nleast\nyou know most people can sort of assume\nthat i don't know about the sumerians\nand some of these ancient civilizations\nthat may have gone to space and whatnot\nbut generally speaking we can assume\nthat our scientific\nour level of understanding\nscientifically of sleep is at an\nall-time high\nwe also tend to have access to science\nat an unprecedented level right so now\nwe have for example lots of people like\nmyself\nwho understand some degree of science\ni.e or clinicians and we show up on\ntwitch or youtube or whatever like tick\ntock instagram whatever and we will like\nteach people about the science right so\nso not only is like not only do we know\nthe most about sleep that we've ever\nknown\nbut the ability for you to access that\ninformation\nis also at an all-time high\nso this kind of begs the question\nif this is the most we've ever known\nabout sleep and access to information\nabout sleep is an all-time time high\nwhy is everyone struggling with sleep\nright it's kind of weird like there's\nsomething fundamentally wrong with the\nway that we approach sleep\nso the first thing that i'm going to\nkind of do is like talk a little bit\nabout what how people approach sleep so\nthe first thing that happens is someone\nsays\ni have trouble with sleep right so we're\ngoing to actually flash to a subreddit\npost that kind of triggered this which\nis a great post\ndr k i need to sleep help okay dear dr k\ni was wondering if you could make a\nstream video about topics around sleep\ninsomnia sleep disorders depression and\nsleep reasons why people have difficulty\nsleeping etc i believe many peop many\nstruggle with sleeping especially my\nfellow gamers advice is much needed\npersonal experience i don't allow myself\nto sleep even though i'm tired and\nexhausted i take a long time to actually\nfall asleep i wake up multiple times at\nnight and the overall sleep experience\ndoes not feel like quality sleep and i\ndon't feel rested at all when i wake up\ni also have a hard time getting out of\nbed in the morning i struggle with\ndepression and ptsd and them seeing a\ntherapist would love any advice so\nbeautiful post we get requests like this\nall the time people are constantly\nasking us about sleep and so the other\nthing that tends to happen is if you\nlook at like people who disseminate\ninformation sleep is a hot topic so a\nlot of people are talking about it right\nso you'll tend to have i've sort of\nnoticed that like you'll have experts in\nsleep so you'll have some kind of\nscientists like probably a phd\nwho is an expert in sleep or\nneuroscience or something like that\nright so they really understand the\nscience and then what they'll tend to do\nis they'll offer recommendations so look\nat this they'll look at studies and\nstuff and they'll say like oh like\nthere's a study that shows this and like\nthis is what we understand about the\nbrain and neuroscience and circadian\nrhythms and stuff like that and then\nthey'll make recommendations\nand so despite the fact that their\nscience is really solid in their\nrecommendations appear to be really good\nwe see still seem to have a societal\nsleep problem and why is that okay\nand so i think the the problem here is\nthat if you look at a lot of people who\nare scientists\nthey have very little clinical\nexperience so the majority of people who\nare scientists who will offer sleep\nrecommendations have not worked with\nlike actual humans around their problems\nthat's not actually part of their job\nright their part their job is to do a\nclinical trial where we offer an\nintervention we're going to take 10 000\npeople we're going to split them into a\ncontrol group and a normal group and 5\n000 people we're going to give let's say\nsome kind of supplement or herb and 5\n000 people we're going to do\ngive them a sugar pill and what we're\ngoing to detect is that on average the\npeople who take the herb or the\nsupplement do better than the people who\ntake the placebo and so they conclude\nthat on average this herb or supplement\nresults in like an improvement in sleep\nbut let's remember that out of those 5\n000 people let's say 2 000 people got\nbetter with the placebo and 3 000 people\ngot better with the herb\nlet's remember for a moment that like 2\n000 people got better with the placebo\nand 2 000 people didn't get better at\nall\nso really all you're talking about is a\nthousand people in the middle that got\nbetter from the the herb right so if you\nreally think about it\nonly 20 percent the the effect size or\nwhat's called the number needed to treat\nfor your medication is like you have to\ntreat five people on average to get\nactually that may be the incorrect\ncalculation but\nthere's this concept of number needed to\ntreat where when we look at science we\nlook at populations and what we end up\nwith is sort of like even though this\nstudy is successful and someone can say\nvery scientifically that this works\nbetter than placebo there's actually\nlike 4 000 people in that study who did\nnot benefit from it and this is the way\nthat science proceeds right so then\nwe'll do clinical trials on for example\ncbt for insomnia cognitive behavioral\ntherapy for insomnia and that appears to\nwork for sleep people will develop apps\nand study like these kinds of things and\nwe study yoga and we study this and we\nstudy that and we study this kind of\nthing and we found this kind of\ncorrelation and so all of our science\nsort of is like very generalized and\nlooking at populations and so this is\nthe reason why people have difficulty\nsleeping because the question is if you\nare having difficulty sleeping should\nyou adjust your diet because there's a\nstudy that shows that diet is helpful\nfor sleep should you take this\nparticular supplement because there's\nstudies that shows that this is helpful\nfor sleep should you see a psychologist\nand do cognitive behavioral therapy for\ninsomnia because the study shows that\nthat works\nand there's no specificity of\nrecommendations right so this is the\ndownside of that i've sort of noticed\nright i'm not trying to criticize anyone\ni think they're offering good\ninformation but when it comes to why we\nhave so much information about all the\nstuff that's effective for sleep when it\ntranslates to an actual human being or\nyou it doesn't seem to translate very\nwell right\nand that there's a good reason for that\nand that's because the scientists tend\nnot to be clinicians\non the flip side we have clinicians\nright so we have medical doctors we may\nhave psychologists that work with people\nindividuals and then they'll sort of\nmake recommendations do cbt things like\nthat and if we have all these clinicians\nwhy is it sleep cured like don't we have\nall these people who are on the front\nlines like clinicians like myself that\nare working with people every day and\nand\nshouldn't that fix it and this is the\nproblem is that clinicians tend to be\ntaught pathology right so if you go to a\nmedical doctor and you say i have\ntrouble with sleep what they will do is\ntry to diagnose you with something and\nif there's something pathological that\nthey can fix they'll help you right so\nif you have sleep apnea for example they\nwill give you a cpap machine a con a\ncontinuous positive airway pressure\nmachine that prevents you from becoming\napnic and then you're you'll be fine so\nif you're in the ten percent of the\npopulation that has a clear diagnosis\ni.e something is really busted with you\nthey'll they may be able to fix that so\nother examples of this could be like\nhyperthyroidism for example so it leads\nto insomnia so if your thyroid is out of\nwhack or you have sleep apnea a medical\ndoctor can fix that but medical doctors\nare individualized and pathology focused\nand and phds or scientists tend to be\nlike understanding the science but can't\ntailor their recommendations to an\nindividual person because they're not\nlike really diagnosticians right they're\nnot clinicians they're not taught in\nthat skill and this is the basic problem\nthat i see with sleep\nis that we have a bunch of information\nbut all of the people who can\nindividualize your recommendations are\nfocusing on pathology and all of the\npeople who have access to the really\nhigh quality scientific information that\nis not pathological in nature i.e\nsupplements herbs things like that don't\nreally have a very solid training in in\nlike diagnostics and sort of teasing\napart what is going on with an\nindividual which is why we get these\nsuper generic recommendations right so\nyou'll get like these these like people\nthat go on podcasts and stuff and\nthere's nothing against them and they'll\nsay okay here are five things you can do\nfor your sleep there's data to support\nall five of these things and then like\nyou'd think that if those actually\nworked then like sleep would be cured\nfor everyone right like those five\nthings like it every problem would be\nsolved but the truth is the problem\nisn't solved and why is that it's\nbecause there's a lack of diagnostic\nspecificity okay\ny'all with me there so let's start with\nthis\nokay\nokay so here's how we're gonna approach\nthis and this is why it's gonna be\ncomplicated all right chat\nso what we're gonna do\nokay there we go there we go\nokay\nso let's start from the top\nokay why is sleep a problem\nso remember kind of like i said so we've\ngot phds over here\nand they're really good at the science\nright but they don't know how to provide\npersonalized recommendations\nthis could also be\num i mean maybe some of them do i don't\nknow that maybe that's a little bit\nunfair actually and i think about it the\nproblem is that on a podcast you're not\ngoing to get a personalized\nrecommendation right on a youtube video\nyou're not going to get a personalized\nrecommendation unless it's dr k which\nwe'll get to in a second\num so then then we've got mds over here\nthat are really good at personalized\nstuff but what we're really trained in\nis pathology\nand so the fact that like our whole\nsociety has insomnia and difficulty\nsleeping\nhas to do with the fact that like this\nis where we're getting their our\ninformation so what's kind of in the\nmiddle here and this is what i think is\nlike really really missing from western\nscience and what i really appreciate\nabout my eastern education is like\nbasics of how sleep works\nso what we're going to start with today\nis like understand like how does sleep\nwork and so an industry that has done a\nreally good job of this\nthat is like for example the fitness\nindustry or like the bodybuilding\nindustry right so like what's happened\nin this industry you have a lot of\npeople walking around who like are in\nshape and they know how to get [ __ ] get\nin shape they're healthy they're they're\nfit and why is that it's because there's\na lot of like basic information about\nhow to get physically healthy in terms\nof like building muscle mass and working\nout and stuff like that there's a lot of\ninformation about the basics of fitness\nthat is not coming from phds and not\ncoming from mds like if you go to a\ndoctor's office and you say can you help\nme get in shape like it's a basic\nfunction of the human body like the\ndoctor is going to be like\nkind of but not really right they can\nassess you for diabetes and maybe start\nyou on anti-diabetes medication maybe\nthey can like give you an inhaler if\nyou've got asthma they can focus on the\npathology but they're not going to like\nhelp you figure out how to work out\nright\nand then on the flip side you've got\nphds that you know they'll give you good\ninformation too they'll say you can use\nthis supplement\nand then you'll build muscle mass better\nthere's this kind of thing that you can\ndo there's this kind of thing that you\ncan do but once again they're not going\nto give you personalized recommendations\nthey're not going to give you like a\nworkout plan right because that's\nsomething that a personal trainer does\nso the main thing that i think is really\nmissing is like the basics of like how\nsleep works\nso where does insomnia actually come\nfrom right like why do people have\ndifficulty sleeping what are the factors\nthat lead to people like\nwhat makes it easy for you to sleep what\ndoes your body and physiology and brain\nrely on to go to sleep how does your\nbody know when you should go to sleep\nwhat are the signals that make you\nsleepy what are the signals that keep\nyou awake and these kinds of fundamental\nthings\nbecause we don't understand them we\ncan't tailor our treatment to them\nbecause we don't like we just treat\ninsomnia like one word okay so let's\nstart by looking at insomnia and\nunpacking it\nbecause there are three there are\ndifferent problems when it comes to i\nhave trouble sleeping so the first\nproblem that we have is a lack of\nspecificity with our jargon\nso if we talk to people who have\ninsomnia\nwhat we find is they're people who have\ntrouble falling asleep\nokay\nthis is completely different so the\nmechanisms of falling asleep are\ncompletely different from the mechanisms\nof staying asleep\nright so some people like and i know it\nsounds kind of weird but you guys get\nthat falling asleep like if i have\nnarcolepsy i have no problem staying\nasleep like the problem is that i fall\nasleep way too easily completely\ndifferent paths so both of these people\nwill say i get bad sleep but there's no\nspecificity in terms of like what's your\nproblem do you have a problem falling\nasleep or staying asleep because as\nwe'll get into there are different\nmechanisms and if this is your problem\nyour solutions are going to be different\nthan if this is your problem okay\nso next thing is that people have\ndifficulty waking up\nand this too is another like it's a\ncompletely different thing right i have\nno problem falling asleep i have no\nproblem staying asleep i have probably\nuh some problem waking up and so people\nwill say my sleep sucks well why is it\nwell it's because i heart it's hard for\nme to wake up in the morning and i feel\ntired in the morning well okay so then\nthat's you guys get how that's like a\ncompletely different thing than like\nlike someone who has anxiety\nwho is awake for three hours like\nworrying about tomorrow that person's\nsolution is going to be completely\ndifferent from the person who can fall\nasleep on time and just has a lot of\ntrouble waking up in the morning now the\ntwo may be related because if you sleep\nthree hours late then you're gonna have\ntrouble waking up at 7am because you\nfell asleep late so i can we cannot\nunderstand why things get tangled but\nlet's start by understanding there are\ndifferent mechanisms at play when it\ncomes to insomnia\nthe the next thing that i'm going to say\nis i'm tired during the day\nor in the morning\nso\nyou might ask what does that have to do\nwith kind of insomnia right so if i ask\npeople\nhow do you know that your sleep is bad\nif i start with that question\nwhat most people will do is they'll say\nwell i feel tired in the morning or\nduring the day\nso this is the tricky thing about sleep\nso there's a huge problem with sleep\nmisperception\nthere's a ton of data that shows that\nhuman beings are very very bad at\njudging their sleep\nand why is that is because you're not\nconscious\nso people will say for example that i've\nonly slept three hours last night people\nsay that kind of crap all the time how\ndo they know they only slept three hours\ndo you guys realize if you only slept\nthree hours a night like how torturous\nit would be to be like bored for five\nhours in the middle of the night like\ndoing absolutely nothing\nit's so bad like sleep misperception is\nlike a huge problem so this is another\ninteresting thing right so like there's\na fantastic medication called\na clever medication i should say\nso there's a there's a medication called\nzolpidem which is also known as the\ntrade name in the u.s is called ambien\nand like this is like a wonder drug for\nsleep\nso if you look at the clinical trials\nfor an ambient or zolpidem essentially\nwhat it does is increases it only\nimproves sleep by 30 minutes\nthat's all it does it gives people 30\nmore minutes of sleep\nokay that's it\nand people think it it cures their\ninsomnia and why is that is because it\ntargets misperception\nso the real thing that's opened and\nassaulted it only increases their sleep\nby 30 minutes it gives you half an hour\nextra sleep but what it really helps\npeople do is fall asleep\nand it gives them the perception\nthat they slept well\nthis is really what it improves\nbut the actual amount of sleep that you\nget from an ambient result is very low\nright\nand so like it alters sleep\nmisperception\nso if we kind of look at insomnia and we\ntry to ask people the question okay like\nwhy do you think you are having bad\nsleep the first thing we need to\nunderstand is that misperception is a\nhuge problem and people tend to like\npoorly diagnose like their own sleeping\nproblems and that sort of makes sense\nbecause\nyou're not conscious right so you don't\nreally know what's going on during sleep\nand so what people will do is they will\nreverse engineer their sleeping\ndiagnosis\nbased on what they are aware of which is\nlike tiredness during the day right\nand so this is another reason why for\nexample sleep apnea is so difficult to\ndiagnose\nbecause sleep apnea is like this period\nof time where you stop breathing during\nsleep and it happens like 10 times a\nnight 30 times a night things like that\nand people don't realize they never\nrealize all they know is that they're\ntired during the day and by the way 10\nof the population has sleep apnea so\nthen what happens is you go to a sleep\nstudy and then like you measure your\nethnic episodes you sleep in a\nlaboratory where you're being constantly\nmonitored they monitor every single\nbreath that you take over the course of\nthe night and then they diagnose you\nwith sleep apnea\nokay\nso when we talk about insomnia we're\ntalking about a number of discrete\nprocesses\nand what people tend to do is they like\nbelieve that\nyou know they have difficulty sleeping\nbecause of like poor data from the next\nday or they are aware of some of these\nthings like people are aware of this\nstuff right so if i wake up or i'm\ntossing and turning all night i have a\nvague sense\nof what tossing and turning all night is\nbut what we'll really discover is it's\nnot really all night\nso just take a step back from that\nbut these are kind of three discreet\nthings that are four discrete things\nthat people will say when they say i\nhave trouble my sleep sucks okay\nso the first thing that we have to try\nto do is sort of recognize that there\nare four discrete things that have four\ndiscrete processes which we'll have in\nturn four discrete solutions\nokay\nnext thing is\nlet's think a little bit about so if we\nwant to understand what are the\ncomponents of sleep\nif we want to understand how to tackle\nthese problems we have to understand\nlike what sleep is\nwhy we sleep and like how the body knows\nhow to fall asleep okay\nso\nwhy is this important so like i want you\nall to just think about this for a\nsecond right so if we want to optimize\nsomething in our body\nwe have to understand like how it works\nand why it has evolved the way that it\nhas and once we understand like what how\nthe body works\nthen we can start to make very targeted\nchanges to optimize things in the\ndirection that we want to so once again\ni'm going to use a fitness analogy right\nso once we understand okay the body\ncraves carbohydrates because they're\ncalorie dense\nand back when we evolved like there were\nsurvival benefits to eating calorie\ndense food okay now that i understand\nthis basic principle i understand like\nwhat i need to alter in order to like\nwork in line with my body so i'm gonna\nneed to eat like complex carbohydrates\nthat in higher fiber diets to help me\nfeel full\nand if i eat high fiber foods that help\nme feel full it will counteract some of\nthe caloric craving that i have so we\ncan start to leverage our understanding\nof like biology and physiology and diet\nand fitness to optimize our physical\nhealth no one does this with sleep right\nlike no one explains like what are the\nbasics of like why we sleep okay\nso let's go over the basics of why we\nsleep and once we understand like why we\nsleep and how we sleep we'll start to\nsee where these four problems arise okay\nso the first thing to understand is that\nsleep is really really important\nand it's highly adaptable\nthis is why it's such a problem so if we\nlook at for example your heartbeat okay\nor your respiratory rate your heartbeat\nand your respiratory rate are not like\nthat adaptable so the goal of the heart\nis to continuously pump blood like all\nthe time we don't need to adapt it it's\nnot like we want to stop pumping blood\nfor a couple hours and then like pump\nextra blood later like sure you can\nincrease your heart rate from let's say\nyou have a resting heart rate of like\n70. you can go up to like 110 or 120\npush come to shop but you're never gonna\ngo up to a thousand like you'll die if\nyou do that and you're never gonna drop\ndown to like 20 right like if you do\nthen you're bradycardic and you can have\nall kinds of problems\nsleep is a little bit different though\nso if we think about you know let's say\ni'm walking around in the jungle\nand i see a tiger\nand then like\ni want to be able to control my sleep\nright so like if a tiger finds me at two\nin the morning i need the ability to\nlike stay awake\ndespite the fact that i'm tired\notherwise i'll get eaten and similarly\nlike i i need to be able to adjust my\nsleep schedule i need to be able to stay\nup all night like let's say i'm a woman\ngiving birth\nand if i'm in the middle of the labor\nprocess and it's midnight it's not like\nmy body's like okay well now that it's\nmidnight let me shut off let me just go\nto sleep and just pause the labor\nproblem no like you need to stay up all\nnight and like finish the process of\nlabor right so there are all kinds of\nsituations which sleep needs to be\nhighly adaptable and this is why it\nchanges so easily right it's really easy\nto screw up your sleep schedule because\nsleep by nature is highly adaptable our\nbody is designed to be able to adjust\nour sleep schedule based on our needs so\nother good examples of this are like jet\nlag right so our body doesn't have a\nfixed clock our body has a clock that\nadapts to things like sunlight\nthis will become really really important\nlater so that's how like you know we\nstart off jet lag when our internal\ncircadian rhythm is out of proportion to\nday time and night time but our body\nfundamentally a lot of its triggers and\ncues about when we should sleep and when\nwe should be awake have to do with like\nlight and darkness right and so this has\nto do with like this has even been\nevolved over like you know farming and\nstuff like that like humans tend to be\nmore awake at certain times of the day\nless awake at other times a day it's all\nbiological in nature but it's it's\nadaptable\nso\num\nso here's kind of what what i'm gonna do\ni'm gonna draw something\nokay so this is like our sleep so this\nis like\nso this is our this is let's say a night\nof sleep\nand then if you have problems falling\nasleep there's like an obstacle here so\nour body has a very natural tendency to\nstart at point a and go to point z right\nthat's what it wants to do it wants to\nsleep for eight hours a day and it's got\nlike a\nthis is a natural\ntendency towards stuff\nand then there are some kinds of\nproblems that can cause an obstacle to\nour body's desire to sleep so this is\nfalling asleep\nso we'll talk about what these factors\nare\nand then they're staying asleep\nso there are things that will disrupt us\nin the middle of our sleep and then\nthere's even like waking up\nright so like there are difficulties\nwith waking up where our body naturally\nwants to end the sleep it's not like you\nhave to\nturn stop sleeping\nintentionally right after you sleep for\na while your body's like we're done time\nto wake up so there are natural\nmechanisms that involve waking up their\nnatural mechanisms that involve staying\nasleep in their natural mechanisms that\ninvolve falling asleep and if we\nunderstand what those are we will start\nto gain power over these different\nproblems okay now just to kind of point\nout like this is the problem with sort\nof like the sleep wellness industry for\nlack of a better term\nis that what does the sleep wellness\nindustry do it just like drives stuff\nthis way it's like here take this\nsupplement\nhere take this herb\nhere use this app\nit has no\ncognizance\nof like these different physiologic\nneuroscientific mechanisms they're just\nlike hey do this thing\nhey do cbt for sleep\nand i'm not saying that this stuff isn't\neffective i'm just saying it's just like\nyou're just adding crap into this this\nlike cycle which is going to cause\nproblems so medical doctors are guilty\nof this too oh i'm having trouble with\ninsomnia if i'm a psychiatrist i'm like\nhere take some trazadone\nor here pop an ambien\nand i'm not really addressing the\nunderlying mechanisms with any\nspecificity so come this morning i am\ntired\nwhy because i have this crap floating in\nmy system\nright\nso like trazado like floats around and\ngives people a sense of daytime\ntiredness\nand this is the next problem with sleep\nis that all the things that we do over\nhere\nthat allow us to basically overcome and\nignore all of these factors create side\neffects in the morning\nso i'll hit on this again\nbut so what are the solutions that\npeople use we use substances right\nwhether it's a whether it's a chemical\nlike whether it's a prescribed drug or a\nsupplement or whatever we just decide\nlike instead of fixing any of this crap\nin the middle\nwhat we're just gonna do is like i'm\ngonna pop a pill i'm gonna take a\nsupplement i'm gonna take a little i'm\ngonna take me some magnesium right\nbecause sometimes that helps with\ninsomnia i'm gonna take me some valerian\nroot or some apogenin or like some\nkavakava or like there's all kinds of\nstuff out there right i mean just take\nme some of this stuff\nand then instead of fixing the problem\nwe have that stuff floating around in\nour system and then we're tired the next\nday this is also true of marijuana right\nso like people say oh i use marijuana to\nhelp me sleep because i can't sleep\nwithout it well then what happens like\nthe next morning so marijuana does\ndifferent things so it affects so we\nhave you know\nour sleep cycles\nright so we've got like you know\ndifferent phases of sleep and then we\nhave rem sleep\nand basically early on in the night\nwe'll have like a lot of let's say phase\none to two sleep and then you know this\nis let's say phase three to four and\nthen we've got some rem sleep over here\nso let's say here's like\nearly night and then as the night goes\non we've got sleep uh phase one to two\nand then we enter phase three to four\ni'm a little bit rusty on this and then\nwe have more rem sleep\nright so we have different phases of\nsleep so our our brain does different\nthings and so hour one of sleep looks\nlike this\nand hour seven of sleep looks like this\nso that the the natural change our sleep\ncycle like evolves over the course of\nthe night\nand what that means is if i use\nmarijuana or alcohol like if i drink\nalcohol i will pass out right so alcohol\nwill overcome this step no problem\nmarijuana will overcome the step of\nfalling asleep the problem is then it\nmesses with this stuff and we get like\nnon-restful sleep\nand we even talk about it in our lingo\nright we say okay i drink alcohol to\nhelp me pass out\nit's not a natural falling asleep\nprocess it's bypassing this step\nartificially with chemicals which\nresults in a an alteration so like when\nyou drink alcohol for example it\ndecreases the amount of rem sleep that\nyou have it decreases the amount of late\nstage sleep that you have and so you\nresult in non-restful sleep and then you\nwake up in the morning\ntired\nand then what do you do\nright so if you use pot or alcohol to\nsleep at night what do you do then you\ndrink coffee\nstimulants\nright\nand then once i start pounding the\ncoffee\nwhen nighttime comes around i have\ntrouble falling asleep because i've got\nthis artificial stimulant floating\naround in my system preventing me from\nsleeping\nand then what do i do\nright so\ncan't fall asleep\noh yeah marijuana sweet\nmarijuana\npoor quality sleep\nwake up tired\ncoffee and this is the cycle\nand so then people are kind of screwed\nbecause now you have a potentially\nmarijuana dependence or a caffeine\ndependence and without either one you're\nkind of like you can't function right\nso i this is where like i think if you\nwant to really conquer sleep\nand be good at it you can't just take a\nsupplement you can't just go to cbt for\ninsomnia unfortunately like sure those\nthings can help\nlike cpap and sleep apnea is the one\nthing that i'd say is like or maybe\nhyperthyroidism stuff too but there are\ndefinitely things that you can do and\nlike absolutely like supplements can\nhelp like doing cbt for insomnia can\nhelp there's overwhelming data that does\nthis but in my experience\nso i've helped like\na bunch of people like really just sleep\nlike babies\nand i'd say that in eighty percent of\nthe people i've done it without a single\ndamn medication\nuh maybe i'll use it at the beginning\nbecause there are other things going on\nbut for like 80 of people it's about\nunderstanding how sleep happens\nand then understanding okay what is the\nproblem that is interfering with your\nsleep and then targeting that thing\nspecifically because if you use\nsomething else like an herb a supplement\nor a medication\nthat's going to cause side effects\nbecause that's just how like stuff that\nyou stick in your body works\nright like things will create\nphysiologic changes if you ingest them\nokay\nso i'm not blaming people who use\nsubstances to help them fall asleep hell\ni sometimes prescribe substances to\npeople to help them fall asleep\nincluding marijuana i've done that\nbefore right but what i'm saying is that\na sustained healthy\nway to get restful sleep\ncomes with like understanding sleep\nfirst\nand then targeting what your specific\nlike problem with sleep is and it feels\njust so much better it's just tricky\nbecause no blog post from the sleep\nnutrition supplement industry is gonna\nexplain this stuff right because it's\nagainst their business model like\nthey're just trying to sell this thing\nand i'm not even blaming them because\nthey can be scientific about it they're\nlike sleep is a huge problem let me go\nlook at what science has to offer and\nthey see oh this herb works let's start\nselling this herb which is totally fine\nlike there's a there's a value to that\nbut in my experience as a clinician\nthis stuff is ultimately way more\nvaluable okay\nso next question so now that we\nunderstand the sleep cycle okay so\nthere's like\nwe start you know at night time\nand then we wake up ideally in the am\nthere's falling asleep staying asleep\nwaking up right these are our three\nobstacles so let's start with this\nokay\nhow does the body like let's just talk\nabout sleep for a second how does the\nbody know like\nwhat how does sleep work so imagine that\ni'm an alien\nor you're like you have a five-year-old\nkid who comes to you and says\nyou know person can you please tell me\nhow does the body know like how does the\nbody know when to go to sleep what do\ny'all think what are the factors\nthat determine when we go to sleep\nright okay so good so one person is\nsaying adenosine\nexcellent\nso\nlet's talk about adenosine for a second\noh hold on hold on melatonin hold on\nhold on\nmelatonin\nexhaustion\ndarkness\nor light very good\nokay\ntemperature\nokay\nso people are saying stress\nexcellent a lot of good stuff here\nokay so so remember for all the all five\nheads out there that are like uh like\nendogenous body clock circadian rhythm\nlike melatonin light sensitivity\nremember we're talking to an alien\nyou're not allowed to use science\nbecause that's not a thing like let's\nunderstand sleep on a basic level what\nthe does that even mean\nno science\ntell me like on a basic level\nhow how does sleep work\nhow does the body know when i'm supposed\nto go to sleep\nokay\nwe'll get to the science don't worry\nabout it but for now we want to\nunderstand on a very simple level\nyou're tired\nokay\nokay so let's talk about a couple of\nthese things okay so how does the body\nknow it's tired\nright it's okay people are saying\nroutine\nwe'll get to these\nno it's not low blood sugar see there's\nthe science again nope happens to be\nwrong fatigue that is a synonym for\ntired right okay so now here comes the\nso like let's just think about this\nright so can you sleep for 24 hours a\nday\nscience is coming don't worry chat\nbut let's start with basics\ngenerally speaking no right so if\nthere's some kind of illness and we'll\ntalk about illness at the end\nyou've done that i'm sure\nright so then we'll even talk a little\nbit about how you've been able to do\nthat because generally speak people\ndon't sleep for 24 hours a day right\ngenerally speak\nspeaking people will stay awake for\nabout 16 hours a day\nand they'll sleep for about\neight hours a day on average okay so\nthere may be variations there are\nabsolutely times where i've slept 20\nhours\nand so but the the basic idea is that\nyou know if i wake up at like 10 in the\nmorning like\nit's really hard for me to sleep eight\nhours at 3 p.m like for most people you\nmay be able to do it because your system\nis all messed up totally fine or there\ncould be an illness going on but\ngenerally speaking like our body kind of\nwakes up after like somewhere between\nlike seven and ten hours\nright and we get tired pretty naturally\nsomewhere around 16 hours and so even if\nyou talk to people who have really super\nmessed up sleep schedules this tends to\nbe like pretty consistent maybe it'll be\nlike 12 to 20.\nright so they may stay up for 20 hours\nthen pass out for 10 and their sleep\nlike schedule is constantly like\nchanging so one day i'm gonna wake up at\n10 a.m and the next day i wake up at\nnoon\nand the next day i wake up at 2 p.m\nand then i'm going to sleep at like\nlet's say 4 in the morning\nand the next day i wake up go to sleep\nat 6 in the morning\nnext day i go to sleep at six in the\nmorning\nright like but if you talk to people\nthis is what you'll see there'll be\nstill be some degree of consistency\nokay\nso the the general thing to understand\nis that our body and this is where\nscience comes in so now we're gonna uh\nyou know unlock the science so like\nwe're just gonna simplify things with\nadenosine\nso basically as we are awake our body\nour brain builds up this chemical called\nadenosine which is a waste product\nproduct it's kind of this is an\noversimplification that's not really\ntrue in some ways but\num you know comes from atp because we\nrecycle atp and stuff all the time\nuh and so atp is our major um\nenergy source which stands for adenosine\ntriphosphate right so we've got a couple\nof phosphates on there each time we bust\noff a phosphate fate we release energy\nso oh yeah look at that some of that\nsweet sweet energy\nthat comes out right and so this is like\nwhere our body gets energy is we take an\nadenosine triphosphate we turn it into\nadenosine diphosphate and we get some\nenergy in the process so as we are awake\nand active we're going to be building up\nadenosine\nand then as we sleep and rest we're\ngoing to decrease adenosine\nokay\nso this is just a broad corollary that\ni'm drawing but there are other\nmetabolic waste products so over the\ncourse of like let's say a 24-hour day\noh god my handwriting's so bad\nthis is something you all got gotta\nunderstand okay we're gonna have waste\nproducts that build up for the first 16\nhours\nso these are metabolic waste products\nright like adenosine\nand then when we sleep\nwe're going to go ahead and kind of\nbring those back down right so\nand\nso then at the end when we wake up over\nhere we're like back to\nour baseline right so zero waste\nokay now when people don't get good\nsleep what we'll end up doing is you may\nsleep so for example if you have a\nproblem with your sleep like let's say\nyou use like marijuana or alcohol what\nyou'll end up with is this even though\nyou're sleeping eight hours\nthe quality of your sleep in terms of\nand i also don't know if this is really\nmetabolic waste products that gets\naltered but whatever\ncrap gets created right so when you wake\nup you're actually going to be like\nyou're going to feel cruddy because\nyou're like waking up over here\nright so this is why like using some\nsome kinds of supplements or even\nmedications can be unhealthy y'all with\nus so the first thing that we're going\nto pay attention to is adenosine or just\nlike metabolic waste that our body\nbuilds up\nhow else does our brain know our body\nknow when it is time to go to sleep\nright so this is the use science chads\nover here we're going to just talk about\ndarkness and light right so like our\nbody has a thing called a circadian\nrhythm\nand light is a huge huge part of like\nour body's physiology of sleeping and\nwakefulness so let's step away from\nhumans because humans are going to get\ncomplicated by all kinds of things but\nwe can look at other mammals right we\nlook like monkeys which are genetically\nlike 99 similar to us they're they have\na heart just like we do they have a\nbrain just like we do they have you know\nlungs just like we do they have kidneys\njust like we do and so like you know how\ndoes a monkey's sleep cycle work well it\nhas a lot to do with light\nso when our our\nbody so our body\nadopts a healthy sleep schedule using\nlight as a signal okay so this is where\nmelatonin comes in\nso when there is light melatonin\nproduction shuts off okay and when there\nis darkness\nmelatonin production goes up\nand melatonin melatonin primes us for\nsleep okay and then melatonin in turn\nhelps us sleep\nso why is this a problem nowadays so now\nwhat people do is they supplement\nmelatonin instead of having our body\ncreate it we're going to start taking it\nbefore bed and then melatonin has been\nclinically effective to\nimprove sleep right help people sleep\nbut why is melatonin being shut off in\nthe first place why do we need to\nsupplement it why aren't we getting\nenough of our own and it turns out that\nblue light\nor the wavelength that's emitted by\nscreens\nshuts off melatonin production\nso essentially because we're using\nscreens\nwe are\nwe stop melatonin production and so\ntherefore we're popping a pill\npop a melatonin we try to balance it out\nand then hopefully we sleep\nso here's something i'm going to tell\nyou all as a physician okay\nnothing that we human beings do to try\nto\nany any time we try to artificially do\nthe body's job we're worse at it so i'll\ngive you guys just an example\nso the body has this mechanism of\nhomeostasis\nokay\nand homeostasis is like maintaining a\nbalance so like let's look at\nhomeostasis of blood pressure for\nexample\nso like our body has all kinds of very\nsophisticated mechanisms to keep your\nblood pressure at 120 over 80. and then\nalong comes modern medicine which we\nsort of have to do and we'll give people\nlike anti-hypertensives so people's\nblood pressure is too high\nso people have hypertension which is\nelevated blood pressure\nso if my blood pressure is let's say\n170 over 100 then\nalong comes dr k who prescribes you an\nanti hypertensive medicine\nand what do you guys think the side\neffect\nof\nantihypertensive medicines are\nhow do these people wind up in the\nhospital when i give them\nantihypertensives do you all know\nwhat happens when i try to fix their\nblood pressure by lowering it\nwith an ace inhibitor\nthey pass out\nexcellent and why do they pass out\nbecause their blood pressure is too low\nso instead of winding up at 120 over 80\nlike they end up at like 100 over 60 and\nthen they pass out\nright so like generally speaking when we\nlook at popping pills\nand administering medicine we do not get\nanywhere near the sophistication of what\nthe human body is able to achieve on its\nown\nokay\nand so this is why we end up with this\ncrap\nbecause like when you use like let's say\nyou use a substance\nlike marijuana or alcohol you're taking\na gigantic hammer to this sophisticated\ncircuit that is your brain you're just\nsmacking it over the head and this is\nwhy you pass out right it's even in our\nlanguage there's no there's no like\nsophistication to it it's just like wham\nand then you wake up the next morning\nand you're tired because you just took a\nhammer to your system and then you need\ncaffeine and then you feel jittery\nright and then you can't fall asleep\nit's just it's terrible like trying to\nyou know it's kind of like i work in\naddiction medicine and sometimes people\nwill speed ball\nand the speed ball is when you use\ncocaine and heroin at the same time to\nbalance out each other's effects but i\ncan tell you that people who use speed\nballs are like not\nas\ngood as people who like just let their\nbody sort of naturally equilibrate to\nhow they should be feeling okay\nright\nso\nwe we will try to supplement stuff which\nis fine and then we have like all these\nthese um you know studies that show that\nmelatonin helps which is true but let's\nstart to understand light and darkness\nokay\nso like our our first thing is\nmetabolism\nso what drives sleep metabolism drives\nsleep second thing is light\ndrive sleep okay what else\ndrives sleep so we're going to talk\nabout physiology and now\nall of you scientific people get to say\nstuff okay so someone said stress\nokay so\nlet's see if people have watched dr k's\nguide does anyone remember from dr k's\nguide how stress interferes with sleep\nwho knows the answer\nanyone know anyone know\ncortisol good and what does cortisol do\nhow does cortisol mess with sleep\nyou all remember this is a tough one you\ngot to know you got to know a little bit\nof neuroscience here\nincreased alertness very good\nright so alertness\nand\nthat damn thing the reticular\nactivating formation\nso let's understand this okay bunches of\ndetails and about this in dr k's guide\nbut we're going to do a quick quick\nrundown okay\nso\nlet's try to understand like why why\nwhat did stress used to be when we\nevolved so let's say i'm a monkey and\nlike what does stress look like in my\nlife right so like i see a predator\nthere's a snake oh crap there was a\npython\non the tree that was next to me\nso i'm gonna move away from it and then\ni'm gonna i'm gonna sleep at some point\nso\nwhen i see the python my my body is\ngonna release two chemicals i'm\noversimplifying stuff okay\nso i'm gonna release adrenaline which\ngives me a short burst of energy like\nwakes me the f up and then i'm gonna\nrelease cortisol which has an a uh\nappear\na duration of action of four to 24 hours\nokay so then my body secretes cortisol\nmy adrenal glands\nand then for the next four to 24 hours i\nhave this hormone that's gonna float\naround in my body and it's a hormone so\nit travels through the bloodstream and\naffects every single one of my organs by\nthe way that's what makes it a hormone\nis that it affects everything so it's\ngonna affect my blood pressure it's\ngonna affect my sense of hunger it's\ngonna make me feel less hungry it's\ngonna affect my immune system it's gonna\naffect my liver it's gonna route blood\naway from my liver\nit is also going to affect this part of\nmy brain called the reticular activating\nformation which is the part of my brain\nthat helps me sleep\nand what does it tell to my reticular\nactivating formation\nwhat is it it says hey you need to wake\nup very very very easily because if we\nhear a twig snap it could be the python\nif we smell something that smells like a\npython i need to be able to wake up so\ngenerally speaking it's hard to wake me\nup when i'm sleeping but when cortisol\nis floating around in my system it's\nvery easy to wake up while sleeping oh\ninteresting dr k are you suggesting for\na moment hold on a second does this mean\nthat interrupted sleep\nmay have more to do with stress and\ncortisol than let's say waking up in the\nmorning oh maybe maybe that could be\ntrue maybe they're actually discreet\nphysiologic and neuroscientific\nmechanisms that are responsible for each\nof these three things and if we target\neach of those mechanisms and understand\nwhat turns them on and then we go back\nto the root of how they're being turned\non and then we actually end up turning\nthem off we will fix your sleep problem\nweird right i know it's kind of bizarre\nbut maybe if you have trouble sleeping\nbecause you're stressed out all the time\ndealing with your stress\nin\nduring your waking hours will actually\nnaturally resolve your sleep problem\nit's weird\nweird maybe you don't actually need to\ntake a supplement maybe what you need to\ndo do is deal with the stress that is\nactivating your brain and telling it to\nnot go to sleep\ninteresting interesting maybe i don't\nknow though\nwe'll see\nokay so that's just one example so if\nyou have stress and you have a high\nlevel of cortisol floating around so\nhere's a good example of modern things\nokay so let's say\ni'm\nfailing out of school\nright\nmy future\nthis is not something that is a\ntemporary thing so our stress system\nevolved to deal with like short-term\nthreats like python right it's not like\non the 30th of the month the python is\ngoing to show up so i'm dreading it for\nthe next 29 days\noh my god i got an f on my first test\nand for the next three months no matter\nhow hard i study i can't get an a in the\nclass my future cortisol level\nconstantly high\nalertness level constantly high\nirritable\nuh\nhunger is all messed up\nright digestion is messed up\nbecause remember cortisol reroutes blood\naway from your gi system and liver\nand my sleep is messed up my future\nwhich you're stressed about every single\nday when you go to class or don't go to\nclass your cortisol level goes up\nand then you can't sleep because your\nreticular activating formation of\ncortisol is like hey\nbetter sleep lightly because we're gonna\nget screwed because our system our our\nbiological machinery cannot\ndifferentiate between a tiger in the\nwoods and failing out of school like it\njust doesn't have the sophistication to\ndo that\nand then what happens is oh my sleep\nsucks\nlet me let me take\nlet me take this herb and that'll fix it\nright\nand then you wake up the next day and\nyou're tired because you've got the herb\nfloating around in your system gg\nokay\nso\nstress is absolutely a big part of it\nthe other physiologic hormone by the way\nthere's a lot more complexity than this\nokay i'm just using this to illustrate a\npoint\nthe other hormone that we're going to\ntalk about is insulin so if i were to\nask y'all\nwhat makes you sleepy right because if\nwe want to understand how to go to sleep\nlet's start with this okay there's stuff\nabout metabolism and light and cortisol\nand okay so what keeps you awake stress\nkeeps me awake excellent next question\nis what makes you sleepy\nexcellent this is the right answer a\nburrito makes you sleepy\nright\nno no no\nso this is what we call the food coma so\nlet's understand ourselves like what is\ngoing on with the food coma it's like 2\np.m\ni haven't eaten all day\nand i have a gigantic burrito because\ni'm starving and then it's like\nand it's hard to stay awake\nand then i drink a cup of coffee to make\nit through the end of work\nand then nighttime rolls around and i\nhave difficulty sleeping where did that\nall begin it began with the burrito\nokay but not just the burrito because\neating a burrito is not the only thing\nthat correlates with an insulin spike\nokay so this is what happens when you\neat food you release a hormone called\ninsulin insulin is an anabolic hormone\nokay what anabolic hormone means is that\nit's a hormone that activates like it\ntells your body hey it's time to build\nstuff so it's time to store away food\nit's time to process calories it's time\nto build glycogen build fat build muscle\nso we're going to go into like building\nphase\nand when we go into building phase like\nwe get sleepy because our body does a\nlot of tissue repair for example and\nbuilding stuff while we sleep so for\nexample we know that our brain grows\nwhile we sleep we know that muscles grow\nwhile we sleep so if you want to be a\ngood bodybuilder you need lots and lots\nof sleep because that's when your body\nlike builds stuff right we're inactive\nwe're not expending energy we're\nbuilding things\nso anabolic sort of having an anabolic\nembolic metabolism or an anabolic mode\nwill be pro sleep\nso what tends to happen is is when we\neat a burrito\nwe will release insulin\nand insulin in turn will make us sleepy\nso\nin the first couple weeks of medical\nschool i was super stressed out for\nreasons that aren't important and i was\nhaving trouble sleeping so i decided\nthat i was going to do\nsomething called burrito chemistry\nand so what i did\nis before i went to bed i would eat a\ngigantic burrito\nand then i would listen to biochemistry\nlectures because biochemistry lectures\nwere so hard to stay awake during right\nso i don't know if you're like me but\nbiochemistry lectures are like hard for\nme to stay awake during and so that\ncombination would like knock me out\nthe cool thing\nis that like by the next morning my body\nhas digested the burrito\nand it's not like biochemistry lectures\nhave any side effect if anything maybe i\nabsorb some biochemistry in my sleep and\nso when i wake up the next morning i'm\nactually like feeling okay\nright there's no herb floating around in\nmy system there's no tracidone floating\naround in my system i like feel pretty\ngood\nso we can actually use physiology\nand especially insulin and the kinds of\nfoods that we eat and when we eat them\nand how we eat them to help us go to\nsleep\nso once again the insulin thing though\nis not going to affect us\nhere\nor here the insulin thing will affect us\nhere so burrito chemistry\ntargets this\nyou all get that\nstress\nreduction\ntargets the first part too but in\ndifferent ways because there's it's not\njust one thing stress has multiple\neffects on your body right\nokay\nso\nthis'll all come together don't worry\nabout it all right so\num\nokay\nso this is these are kind of like three\nthings that we're going to talk a little\nbit about metabolism light and\nphysiology as like mechanisms that will\naffect the three dimensions\nthat we are talking about falling asleep\nor four dimensions falling asleep\nstaying asleep trouble waking up and\nfeeling tired during the day okay\nnow so so we can also see that\ntechnology acts here\nright um\nsleep cycles are going to be sort of\nhere as well\nin terms of like metabolism so what i\nmean by that is that you know\nlike if i wake up at noon it's going to\nbe hard for me to go to sleep at 9 00\np.m you all get that and that's\nessentially like due to our internal\nmetabolism\nokay\nso we've talked a little bit about um\nwe've talked a little bit about these\nthree dimensions so let's go back to our\ndiagram and now we're going to start\ntalking\na couple of other things okay so we're\ngonna talk about medical stuff\nso here's our sleep diagram so here's\nyou know\nhour zero let's say hour ten\nright so we have obstacles to falling\nasleep obstacles to staying asleep\nobstacles to\num\nwaking up\nokay those are all discreet and we'll\nget to solutions in a second\nthe next thing that we have to talk a\nlittle bit about is illness so\nif you have an\nillness this line no longer applies what\nwe're dealing with is a slightly\ndifferent line\nso like if we think about correcting an\nillness there's like something so if we\nhaven't let's say i'm hyperthyroid okay\nwhat's to happen is\nwhen i'm hyperthyroid\nthese things are going to be altered by\nsomething fundamental so our like level\nof thyroid hormone like creates a\ncompletely different scenario so the\nnormal things the normal physiologic\nstuff may be insufficient so i can even\ncorrect this problem i can do\npsychotherapy around my stress and i can\nmanage like waking up well but if i'm\nhyperthyroid all the stuff that would\nnormally fix my problems may not fix my\nproblem because there's a underlying\nphysiological state which is completely\ndifferent so for example burrito\nchemistry is not going to help me wake\nup feeling rested if i have sleep apnea\ndo you all get that so the thing about\nillness is that illness like\nfundamentally alters things and then\nthis has to be fixed in order for the\nother stuff to like you know\nstart working properly do you all get\nthat so let's talk a little bit about\nthe conditions that lead to um\naltered neurochemistry altered\nphysiology that just sort of like in\nwhich normal sleep no longer applies\nright because everything we've talked\nabout so far is just like normal sleep\nand how it works and what are the\ndrivers for sleep so the first thing is\nmental illness so this is the cool thing\ni mean it's not cool but it's\ninteresting intellectually\nso this is an interesting observation\nthat i made that i'm sure lots of other\npeople made but i don't know why they\ndon't teach us this explicitly\nso the common denominator for every\npsychiatric illness\ndepression anxiety\npsychosis\nocd is impaired sleep\nthe one symptom\nthat all people who have a psychiatric\ndiagnosis that may be a little bit of an\nover generalization i'm sure there's\nsomething out there that doesn't apply\num like maladaptive daydreaming or\nsomething but generally speaking if you\nlook at the common denominator for all\nmental illnesses it is impaired sleep\nand so this is when i got curious about\nsleep and this is by the way how i\ndeveloped all this crap because i i\nthought to myself i was like oh like\nthat's kind of interesting i wonder if\nif this is the common denominator if i\nget really really good at helping people\nwith their sleep i wonder if like i\nwould help all of my patients instead of\nlearning depression treatment anxiety\ninstead of becoming an expert in\ndepression treatment an expert in\nanxiety treatment an expert in ocd\ntreatment i wonder if i just become an\nexpert in sleep can i actually help\neveryone that i see and i think the\nanswer is basically yes so we know that\ndepression leads to sleep impairment we\nknow that anxiety leads to sleep\nimpairment\nwe know that you know ptsd leads to\nsleep impairment okay and the other\nreally interesting thing uh so other\ncauses are going to be like\nhyperthyroidism so there's all kinds of\ncauses\nright so i i'm not going to cover them\nall so for example there's this\ncondition called\nuh\nfamilial\nfatal insomnia i've seen one patient\nwith this it is terrifying\nso this is a genetic condition\nthat is almost like a prion disease\num so you inherit some kind of protein\nthat later in life prevents you from\nsleeping and then you can't sleep like\nyou literally cannot sleep so some\nfundamental circuit in your brain that\nlets you fall asleep fails and then you\nstart to become like psychotic\ndelusional and eventually you die it's a\nterrifying condition\nwe're not really covering all of the\nphysiologic causes of sleep because\nthey're exceedingly rare so we're just\ncovering the big ones so the top of the\nlist\nis mental illness\nhyperthyroidism\nsleep apnea\nright and there are other things also\nacid reflux\nthere are also circadian rhythm\ndisorders\nso these are things like um shift work\ndisorder\nso these are people who work night\nshifts right also medical residents and\ndoctors uh there's like you know\nbasically something that is what is it\nlate shift\ni forget the name this is basically like\nnight owls people have a night owl\ncircadian rhythm\nthere's like circadian rhythm like nos\nthere's a bunch of these diagnoses but\nessentially these are diagnoses where we\nhave an internal biological clock\nwhich tells us when to wake up and when\nto go to sleep which by the way is\ninfluenced by all the things that we\nalready discussed\nlike light and metabolism that somehow\ngets shifted off\nand so those are\nunique diseases which have their own\ntreatments\nmy point is that you know if you have\nand the interesting thing is that these\nmap on to particular areas right so\ngenerally speaking\nspeaking people with anxiety have\ndifficulty falling asleep\npeople with depression suffer from early\nmorning awakening\nso in the case of depression\nwe see something very interesting which\nis even if you go to sleep late like if\ni have trouble falling asleep and i go\nto sleep at midnight i wake up at 4 00\na.m every day and i feel super depressed\nand my mind is racing\nright so these discrete processes ptsd\ntends to happen here\nhave difficulty staying asleep why is\nthat because they have nightmares\nright so we even have some medications\nlike prosocian\num which will stop nightmares and help\npts people with ptsd sleep through the\nnight so people with ptsd don't\nnecessarily have troubles falling asleep\nor waking up but or they're even if they\nhave trouble waking up the reason they\nhave trouble waking up is because their\nsleep is disturbed in the middle of the\nnight right so we can even see amongst\nmental illnesses\nnot all of the insomnia is the same like\nthere are discrete different\nsources of insomnia that particular\nmental illnesses will target and damage\nwhich results in these three buckets\nso hyperthyroidism for example will have\nuh will act here\nand here\nreally\num but we'll see like a lot of times\npeople will have difficulties falling\nasleep if they're hypothyroid sleep\napnea\nsort of\nis noticed here\nbut is really a problem over here\nokay this is really where sleep apnea\nacts\nso once again we've got like tons of\nevidence that insomnia is not all the\nsame so if you're listening to your\nfavorite wellness podcast and they're\nlike oh this thing helps with sleep like\ni think the reason that everyone is\nstill having sleep problems despite the\nfact that we have a thousand wellness\npodcast is because i don't hear anyone\ntalking this specifically about sleep\nand that's like why the problem is\npersisting fundamentally\nso if we have reflux for example reflux\nacts here in here\nso people can have trouble falling\nasleep if they have reflux so just to\nunderstand this a little bit so reflux\nis when\nyou have stomach acid which normally\nbelongs in the stomach and the stomach\nis a high acidic environment so it's\nprotected against the high acid our\nesophagus which is the pipe that\nconnects our mouth to our stomach\nshouldn't have stomach acid in it\nstomach acid will damage it\nso when we have reflux we have a lazy\nvalve\nor lazy flap that allows acid to leak\nfrom our stomach into our esophagus\nthen the esophagus starts taking acid\ndamage every round\nas it starts taking acid damage you're\nlike being injured and it releases all\nkinds of inflammatory chemicals bumps up\nyour cortisol level and causes all kinds\nof problems right so re like reflux can\nactually cause this as well so this is\nthe kind of thing where as long as\nyou've got reflux going on i mean you\ncan\ncut out caffeine all you want to but as\nlong as you've got that reflux signal\nyou can deal with your internal worries\nabout how your life is never going to go\nanywhere or whatever you do deal with\nall that crap but as long as the reflux\nis creating a physiologic like you know\nyou're sitting in a pool of acid your\nesophagus is sitting in a pool of acid\nthat's going to create a physiologic\neffect which will will make it hard for\nyou to sleep okay\nso the key thing here is that different\nkinds of illnesses are going to alter\nthe general trajectory that you're\nworking with right that's why we call it\na pathology because it changes the game\nand so playing a normal strategy of\ntrying to use burrito chemistry\nor you know leveraging like having a\nhealthy like light\nkind of balance\nwill result in what won't work properly\nbecause there's some other confounding\nfactor\nokay so let's talk a little bit about\nsolutions for sleep\nokay\nhow we doing so far chat you all doing\nokay\nwe're like one hour in\nso we're going to pause we can actually\nstop we can do solutions later\nokay we can absolutely do recap before\nwe jump into solutions\nlet's do a recap excellent excellent\nthank you okay\nso let's start from the top\nokay the first thing\nis despite\nan increase in the amount of science\nand an increase in the dissemination of\nscientific information\nwhy is insomnia such a problem so i\nbelieve it is generally a problem\nbecause\nscientific studies look at populations\nand do not\nrecommend like individualized\ntreatments for insomnia right\nso like you can have all these general\nrecommendations do this for sleep do\nthat for sleep and we're about to get to\nthose but the key thing to understand is\nthat insomnia is not\nhomogeneous it is not one thing it is a\nconstellation of different things and if\nyou want to conquer your insomnia what\nyou need to do is\nstart to figure out first what kind of\ninsomnia you have because each one has a\ndifferent solution\nso we talk about why people have trouble\nsleeping or what their perception is\nthey say my sleep sucks what that means\nthey could be talking about one of four\nthings\nnumber one they have difficulty falling\nasleep they're staying awake they go to\nbed on time they're tossing and turning\nand they're not able to fall asleep\nnumber two\neven if they do fall asleep they're\ntossing and turning all night they wake\nup in the middle of the night they don't\nfeel like they get restful sleep\novernight so when they wake up in the\nmorning\nthey feel unrested\nnumber three i have difficulty waking up\nso this could be related to number two\nor related to number one right if i\ntoss and turn for two hours and i don't\nactually go to sleep on time let's say i\ngo to bed at 10 p.m and i have to wake\nup at 6 a.m but for the first two hours\ni'm tossing and turning then i'm gonna\nwake up tired or if i do go to bed at 10\nat 10 pm but if i'm tossing turning all\nnight i'm going to wake up feeling tired\nsome people have difficulty just waking\nup even if they do go to bed on time and\neven if it does appear that they sleep\npretty well\nthe fourth reason that people say that\ntheir sleep sucks is because they're\ntired during the day or in the morning\nokay\nand the key thing here\nis that if we want to conquer insomnia\nwe have to know which one is our problem\nbecause each of these involves different\nmechanisms and if we fix those\nmechanisms we can fix our sleep\nokay\nso then we got to this\ndiagram which is sort of like you know\nuh okay hold on a second let me actually\nright so\nthe solutions that society tends to\noffer us tend to be like instead of\nfocusing on falling asleep staying\nasleep or difficulty waking up and\noffering us a tailored solution what we\ntend to do is recommend things just\nblanket right take this herb\nsmoke marijuana drink alcohol do cbt for\ninsomnia take this medication that is\nprescribed by a physician\nand all of these things don't account\nfor any of the specificity of what is\ncausing our sleep problem we're just\ntaking a huge hammer to the problem\nwhich in turn means that we wake up\ntired in the morning because we're not\ndealing with the root of the problem\nthen we enter into this cycle where i\nwake up tired so i need marijuana to\nfall asleep and then i pass out and then\ni get low quality sleep i wake up tired\nthen i have to drink coffee and since i\ndrink a bunch of coffee i can't fall\nasleep since i can't fall asleep i need\nmore marijuana\nright so we end up in this vicious cycle\nwhere like our solutions become our\nproblems\nso\nin order to understand this i think the\nthe key solution is like let's\nunderstand like how sleep works like\nwhat are the basics of sleep\nwhat helps us fall asleep why do we fall\nasleep why do we get sleepy why do we\nhave difficulty waking up what\ndetermines when we wake up because think\nabout that for a second it's really\ninteresting right you don't need\nanything to wake you up like if you go\nto sleep now\nyou will wake up at some point right so\nthere's some internal mechanism that\ncauses you to wake up what are the\nmechanisms that cause you to wake up\nwhat are the mechanisms that cause you\nto go to sleep so we talked about a\ncouple of those\nmetabolism right so over the course of\nthe day we build up metabolic waste\nproducts when we go to sleep we clear\nthose metabolic waste products when we\nclear those metabolic waste products we\ntend to wake up\nokay this is why if you for example if i\nhave a 36 hour shift as a doctor i'm not\ngonna wake up in eight hours i will be\nsleep deprived and it'll take my body\nlonger to clear those metabolic waste\nproducts so instead of sleeping for\neight hours i will sleep for 12 hours\nand there are other different things\nthat you have to make up for the sleep\ndebt over the next couple of days so\ni'll sleep like 10 hours a day for the\nnext three days instead of sleeping\n16 hours at a stretch right so there are\nall kinds of complicated mechanisms\nwhich we're not going to go into right\nhere but\nso metabolism is one big reason why we\nget tired\nand why we wake up light is another huge\nreason so our body has been evolved to\nbe very sensitive to light in terms of\ntelling us when to go to sleep and when\nto wake up so even if we think about jet\nlag how does jet lag get corrected think\nabout that for a second right so i have\na circadian rhythm which wants me to go\nto sleep at a particular time and wake\nup at a particular time how does the\ncircadian rhythm adjust how does it know\nhow to adjust it uses light right so\nlight is a huge part of our ability to\nsleep\nthird thing is we have all kinds of\nphysiologic mechanisms which we're just\ngoing to use too just to\nillustrate this example one is cortisol\nso when we get stressed out\nwe release cortisol cortisol goes to our\nbrain and turns on this part of our\nbrain called the reticular activating\nformation which then tells us that we\nneed to sleep very very lightly or sleep\nless because we're in danger and so if\nyou're in a chronic state of stress your\nbody is literally going to be telling\nyou to wake the f up all the time and\nsleep very lightly so any kind of noise\nwill wake you up if you have a high\nlevel of cortisol in your system\nso in order to fix that problem you have\nto deal with the underlying stress and\nthen you'll be able to sleep better the\nother thing that we talked a little bit\nabout is insulin so when we eat food\nwe secrete insulin and when we secrete\ninsulin it makes us sleepy\nokay\nso\nthen we've talked about mental illness\nthat all of these mechanisms are fine\nand good but this is in a normal healthy\nfunctioning human being\nif you throw on some kind of mental or\nphysiologic illness you're playing a\ncompletely different game with a\ncompletely different set of rules so if\nyou want any of that other stuff to work\nyou have to move back to the baseline by\ntreating that illness so that could mean\ntreating the ptsd could mean treating\ndepression it could mean getting a sleep\na cpap for for sleep sleep apnea you\nknow there are all kinds of other stuff\ncould mean getting your acid reflux\ntreated you know get get yourself a ppi\nand we'll talk about that kind of stuff\nwhich is a proton pump inhibitor which\nis a treatment for acid reflux\num\nand so that's where we are so far okay\nso now we're going to talk about\nsolutions\nso the first thing that you should do\nwe're going to start with uh let me see\nokay let's start with general solutions\nand then we'll get to specifics okay\nfirst thing you should do is get a\nmedical evaluation\nand why should you start with this\nyou should start with this because if\nany of these things is going on and\nyou're not aware of it like the rest of\nthe stuff may not work right this could\nbe a really simple fix if there's\nactually some kind of pathology going on\nlike if you can correct your thyroid\nlevel and like easy done finished right\nso this may be the biggest bang for your\nbuck\nokay\nnext thing you should do\nis diagnose your sleeping problem\nand i don't mean like\ngive yourself a medical diagnosis\nso maybe isolate is a better word\nso this is where you can use something\nlike a sleep diary and try to figure out\nokay what is actually my sleeping\nproblem is my problem that i have\ndifficulty falling asleep is my problem\nthat i have difficulty staying asleep is\nmy problem that i have difficulty waking\nup is my problem that i feel tired\nduring the day\nand be a little bit careful and be\ncritical and this is where you want to\nlike measure stuff right so people will\nsay oh my problem is that i get three\nhours of sleep a night but if you\nactually use a sleep diary what you will\ndiscover you will uncover the sleep\nmisperception which is that you actually\nfall asleep around 11\nand then you may have opened your eyes\nbriefly at like two in the morning and\nthen you actually get out of bed at\nseven and you may discover that\nyou're actually sleeping a normal amount\nand then that should trigger something\nreally interesting because now you know\nokay so there's something else going on\ni'm actually sleeping eight hours a day\nso components of a sleep diary which\nwill try to put together something some\nkind of like worksheet or something for\ny'all\nbut what time do you fall asleep\nwhat time do you wake up\nhow rested do you feel\non a scale of one to ten\nright so do this every day for a month\nother things you can do is like how um\nyeah so other things that i would add is\nlike what is your technology use\nbefore bed\num\nwhat\nwas\nyour\nbedtime\nroutine\nwhat was\ncaffeine\nalcohol\nmarijuana intake like that day\nright so like what did you do in the\nfour hours before bed\num\nany particular sources of stress that\nday\nright so you should start like\ncollecting data over time\nthere are other things that we'll we'll\nadd to the sleep diary we'll try to put\nsomething together for y'all that's\npretty comprehensive but you want to\ncheck this stuff every single day right\nyou can even\ninclude some stuff about dreams if you\nwant to but we'll get to that in a\nsecond\nso you th this is where you need to\ncollect really really high quality\ninformation\nso that you can make a targeted\nintervention that will work for you\nokay so sleep diary is really important\nnext thing okay so now just general\nsolutions so the first thing is time\noutdoors\nso every day you should spend at least\none hour outside if you can\nokay so like this is the biggest problem\nthat i see with the gaming generation is\nlike we live in a cube\nright especially if we're like really\nhardcore gamers or like it doesn't you\ndon't have to be a hardcore gamer\nespecially during coven we wake up\nwe stay indoors\nwe\nlet's say we shower let's say i'm like a\ngenerally healthy person during covet\nright i wake up i shower i eat some\nbreakfast i sit down i work for eight\nhours remotely\ni take a break\ni watch some tv while i have a late\nlunch\nright because like i'm not gonna just\nsit there and eat my food i'm gonna have\nsome kind of technology while i'm doing\nit i'm going to like watch something or\nlisten to something or whatever\nand then i'm going to like log on with\nmy friends and i'm going to game for a\ncouple of hours and i'm going to wrap up\nthe day with some netflix\nand then watch youtube videos on my\nphone before i go to sleep\nright so i've just been in this damn\ncube the whole time so i have no outdoor\nstuff so then what what does that mean\nfor my sleep\nhow does my body know that it's bedtime\nit has no idea\nhow does it know when it's a daytime it\nhas no idea\nit's not seeing any horizons which is\nreally important\nactually for your eyes and stuff like\nthat too it's not getting exposed to a\nlarge amount of light\nright it's just the same damn\neven walls\neven windows maybe you get a little bit\nof light\neven light from our computer screen so\nit's getting the same stimulus\nall day long\nand all night long there isn't a\ndifference in the kind of stimulus it\ngets so it gets it it gets confused from\na circadian rhythm\nso i know it's kind of weird but go\noutside\nduring the day\nand\nat dusk\nif you can this is ideal this is huge\nokay\nso this will start using a lot of good\nlike light\ninformation\nlike your body you'll be sending all\nkinds of signals to your body and there\nare all kinds of mechanisms i haven't\neven touched on so for example you will\nproduce\nvitamin d\nwhich in turn will decrease your\ndepression\nwhich in turn\nwill move you in this direction cool\nright so spend some time outdoors\nnext thing\nstructured bedtime routine\nwe are creatures of habit our brain\nlikes habit who here has to concentrate\nevery time they brush their teeth no you\ndon't need to concentrate anymore your\nbrain is formed a habit\nhelp your habit work for you okay so\ndevelop a bedtime routine so for two\nhours before bed no screens\nthis is so hard oh my god dr k\nhow am i supposed to not use a screen\nbefore bed it's impossible\ncouple of really good rules no phones in\nbed\nalso applies to tablets\nswitches\nlaptops just no phones in bed\nright that's hard dr k\ni understand that it's hard it's just\nyou need to decide\nwhat do you prefer\ndo you would you rather have your phone\nin bed or would you rather have a good\nnight's sleep you have a choice\ni'm not saying you have to do it i'm\njust saying if you want a good night's\nsleep you start with no phones in bed\nthis is where i'm going to help you all\nout a little bit i'm not going to just\nleave you with that decision all on your\nown so i think this is where the biggest\nchallenge that we face\nis that for the two hours before bed we\ndon't know what to do\nright it's like if i'm not on my phone\nbecause if you think about like when do\nyou pull out your phone you pull out\nyour phone during periods of boredom or\ntransitions when there's nothing else\ngoing on you pull out your phone if\nyou're in a transition point you pull\nout your phone if you're waiting for\nyour friend to pick you up and they're\ngonna be there in five minutes and\nyou're ready what are you gonna do in\nthose five minutes you're going to pull\nout your damn phone\nright you're not going to sit there\nyou're going to pull out your phone\ntoilets transitions\nright that's when we use our phone\nthe problem is that once you start\nscrolling it's going to inhibit your\nmelatonin production\nright so screens\ninhibit melatonin\nand are also going to\nactivate mental function\nso this is what i want you all to\nunderstand about your brain\nyou know how you don't cook food and put\nit straight into the fridge what do you\ndo with food before you stick it in the\nfridge\nyou got to let it come to room temp you\ngot to let it cool down\nso your brain needs a cool down time so\nthat doesn't mean be inactive that means\ndon't do some kind of hyper stimulating\ndopaminergic activity let it come to\nroom temperature before you you put it\nto sleep that's what you need to do with\nyour brain okay\nso screens are really really problematic\nbecause the reason they're so damn\naddictive and this is the way that\nthey're designed\nis to stimulate the brain and keep it\nengaged so it's the very opposite it's\nlike the you know the the\nlike all these apps and stuff are like\nmicrowaves for your brain like they're\njust gonna heat it up\nlike if you if you browse reddit for\nexample or twitter like they're gonna\nthere's gonna be a lot of like sexist\nlike political meme-ish\nanti-blizzard anti-ea anti-work\nanti-like climate change anti-liberal\nantifa like so there's gonna be some\nkind of crap that's gonna amp you up\nright i'm not trying to place a value\njudgment on any of it i'm not saying any\nof it is right or wrong that's for other\npeople to decide i'm ignorant to that\nstuff all i'm saying is that all that\nstuff is gonna have you\nlike being\nactivated\nokay\nso\nthis is why you need to stay away from\nscreens so then the question is okay dr\nk what should i do instead of\nthe screens and this is beautiful this\nis like the most op move\nall of the crap that you should be doing\nanyway\nright so if you procrastinate to do\nthings because you're xyz that is the\nstuff that you should do for two hours\nbefore bed so i like to the best one to\nstart with for me is grocery shopping i\nwill go grocery shopping at like 9 p.m\nat night\nokay so it gets me out of the house i'm\naway from a screen i do my grocery\nshopping then i've got groceries for\ntomorrow so that's a win\ni also clean before bed really fantastic\ncleans out the mind\nshould the\nthis is in dr k's guide which in turn\nwill reduce your stress\nreduce your anxiety\nand target falling asleep\neasy champ\nright so cleaning and you have the bonus\nof like having a you know clean dishes\nyou have the bonus of like not having a\nmessy place\nso we're gonna take this goal that you\nhave set for yourself\nand it's very hard for you to do and\nwe're gonna leverage that goal to help\nyou sleep every single day\nokay you can also do things like sort\nthrough the mail\ni do all kinds of like random stuff okay\nexercise yoga\nmeditation\nokay and then some people say but i\nthought you weren't supposed to exercise\nbefore bed\nand that's where like yeah generally\nspeaking if you look at population\nstudies it is more advantageous to\nexercise earlier in the day for the\naverage person\nbut if you're like me you can exercise\nfor before bed and then like if you do\nlike two hours before bed you feel super\ntired and like really good at night and\nit's very easy to sleep\nokay you can also do something like take\na bath so there's some physiologic stuff\nhere\nwhere\ni'm just trying to figure out if i want\nto go into this\nso when you take a hot bath you get a\nlot of vasodila peripheral vasodilation\nand then after the bath\nyou get alterations\nin blood vessels\nthat make you sleepy\ni'm not going to go into more detail but\nnot here but there's a lot that goes on\nthere right so you can use like\nphysiology there too\nokay other advantage other things that\nyou can do so if you're bored right so\ni'd say audio stuff is totally fine\nphysical books totally fine\nbe careful about what you read but\ngenerally speaking like i'll listen to\nlike spirituality lectures and podcasts\nand like stuff that's like interesting\nand that like i'm glad the next day that\ni learned something but it's not so\nintellectually stimulating like i would\nnot read like a horror novel before bed\nright unless that works for you i mean\nit may work for you\nbut you can like all that stuff that you\nwant to learn like you know you want to\nread more nonfiction you want to like\nlearn more about stoicism get yourself\nan audio book and just listen to it in\nbed okay\num we'll talk a little bit about\nmeditation in a second\nand then uh\nlast thing is food\nokay\nso here's our tip\nfor eating\nso here is the diet that i would\nrecommend for the average person who\nwants to use that insulin spike in their\nfavor\nso i'd say start\nbreakfast\nwith something like oatmeal\nhigh fiber\nhigh satiety\nlow calorie\nfood\nokay\nso if you don't do this\nyou will have a huge lunch\nokay so we don't want a huge lunch we\nwant some kind of high fiber high\nsatiety like\npile of stuff in your stomach so that\nyou feel kind of full\nyou need to eat a pre-emptive lunch\nso if you wait\ntoo long\nthis calorie deficit which you've\nalready built up\nis going to cause you to crave really\nunhealthy food so you want to have like\na gigantic pile of oatmeal at like 8 a.m\nwith berries\nand then you want to fix yourself some\nkind of like sandwich or something like\neven before you get hungry like 11 30\neat a sandwich or something not too\ncalorie dense\nbut you want to avoid being super super\nhungry at 11 30\nor at noon actually so you got to eat\nearly okay\nthen what's going to happen when evening\nrolls around like when 6 pm\n7 p.m rolls around you're gonna be\nfamished because you're like kind of\ncalorie deficit for the day and then i\nwant you to eat whatever the hell you\nwant\nso go to town on the burrito\nokay\nhit that food coma veg out for a little\nbit go through your bedtime routine and\nthen just pass the [ __ ] out\nokay this is really really really\nimportant okay\nso there's an important point so a lot\nof people say i do bodybuilding what\nabout this what about gaining weight\nit takes about three days to reset your\nsleep schedule so all this stuff you can\nstart to adjust these things but to\nreset your sleep schedule all it takes\nis three days\ngenerally speaking so it's okay to do\nthis for three days and then you can\nadopt healthier eating habits afterward\nbecause then you've got other stuff\ngoing for you right now your circadian\nrhythm after three days your circadian\nrhythm is adjusted it's gonna be easy\nfor you to fall asleep at 10 pm so you\ndon't need the burrito to get you into\nthe coma right at that point this stuff\nwill be enough\nokay so these are general tips for sleep\nokay\nother things to remember\nso last point that i'll kind of share is\nthat generally speaking it is easier to\nwake up when you're tired than it is to\ngo to bed when you're not\nokay\nso\nthis may not apply to some of y'all so\nif you have a problem with this phase\nof sleep maybe this is not true for you\nbut generally speaking i think like\nphysiologically it's like easier to wake\nup in the middle of the night if your\nhouse is on fire than it is to like go\nto sleep you know\nif you're\nfully awake\nso our we have more mechanisms that can\nincrease wakefulness than we do that can\nincrease sleepiness\nso if you want to reset your sleep\nschedule what it takes is three days\nof waking up on time\nand\nif you guys just want one tip bit of\nadvice being\na zombie\nyou will be a zombie don't drink\ncaffeine you're just gonna be a zombie\nall day long you're gonna feel terrible\nyou're not gonna be able to do anything\nyou're gonna be unproductive you're\ngoing to be kind of moody irritable like\nit's just going to feel like you're\nyou're like lagging in real life\nyou're like playing real life on ping\nthat's what it's going to feel like\nand then sleep will feel like a relief\nnext day you're gonna wake up\nyou're gonna be a zombie you're gonna do\nthat three days in a row\nby the end of it you'll feel amazing\nyou'll have detox off of caffeine\nyou may have even detoxed off with some\nof that dopamine too\nand your sleep your circadian rhythm\nwill be reset and then you'll be like\ngolden\nokay you just have to understand that\nyou have to like you're gonna be a\nzombie for a while okay\nso at this point we're an hour and a\nhalf in and i have not even gotten to\nthe three specifics so i think we're\ngonna save that for another day\nso what we'll have maybe next time is\nspecific strategies\nfor if you have trouble falling asleep\nstaying asleep\nand waking up\nright so how can we look at\nplease today\nokay we can do it today that means\nthat's all we're gonna do today i gotta\ni gotta check\nokay today okay\nso good\nokay\nokay finish today that's all we're going\nto do today then\nbecause i did what i normally do so\nwe're like this is like dude this is a\n90 minute lecture\nfolks you all get that like we're\nalready 90 minutes in and by the way\ni've done like 12 hour seminars on sleep\nso there's just we're just scratching\nthe surface like there's so much to\nunderstand about this\nthat's all\napplicable too it's not just like\nacademic\nlike here's what we like there's like\nthere's so many different things\nso one tip that i we haven't even talked\nabout which is huge\nis you remember this this rem cycle\nbusiness\nright so you have\nyou have sleep cycles where you start\nhere and then you end here\nso if you wake up here\nyou'll feel groggy\nbut if you wake up here you'll feel\nrested\nand this is if you for example sleep for\ntwo hours and wake up here you will feel\nrested if you sleep for eight hours and\nwake up here you'll feel groggy so\nunderstanding where you are in your\nsleep cycle when you wake up is critical\nso this is why you know sometimes you\ntake a nap\nand like you wake up feeling way more\ntired than when you went to bed and\nsometimes you take a nap and it's like\nyou feel amazing\nand you're like wait but why is that\nlike i only slept for a half an hour or\n45 minutes and i feel amazing and other\ntimes it's like i slept for three hours\nand i feel like a zombie like i don't\nunderstand what's going on it's because\nof when you wake up during this this\ncycle and so even understanding things\nto that specificity will control\nhow easy it is to wake up because you\nhave to wake up at the right time of\nyour sleep cycle\nokay\nokay\nokay strategies\nall right\nso difficulty falling asleep\nso the first thing to understand\nis that according to ayurveda which by\nthe way i know we've had some people who\nwere\nuh skeptical of irvada which is totally\nfine um i'm still amalgamating different\nkinds of evidence that i will present to\ny'all and hopefully y'all will be\nconvinced\ni am um\ni'm i'm convinced that ayurveda is very\nhelpful from a clinical standpoint\nprecisely because of things like this so\nif you guys like think this is pretty\ncool and no one else talks about it this\nway\nthis kind of thinking essentially comes\nfrom ayurveda\nthis idea that insomnia is not\nhomogeneous and affects different people\nin different ways is like a\nfundamentally ayurvedic concept and you\nmay say but that's a fundamentally human\nconcept but that's not how western\nmedicine really thinks about it right\nbecause\na medical doctor will diagnose you with\ninsomnia like they'll just diagnose you\nwith that and they'll kind of like be\ndone with it\nright so falling asleep first of all to\nunderstand from an ayurvedic perspective\nis a bit the problem and if you guys\ndon't understand what that means\ngo watch dr k's guide and go look at the\nir by the stuff because there's like two\nor three hours about that okay\nso it's a fit then balance so pithas\ntheir minds are very active their minds\nare like fire they can't let things go\nthey have trouble cooling down before we\nput the food in the fridge\nright and so they have difficulty\nfalling asleep they will hold on\noftentimes\nto a few thoughts\nand these thoughts prevent them from\nsleeping\nokay\nso if you have trouble falling asleep\nfirst thing to understand is that it may\nbe a fit the issue and if you balance\nyour pitta it should get better\nwe'll talk a little bit more about that\nin a second\nsecond thing you should ask yourself is\nif you're having trouble staying asleep\nhere's the next question you should ask\nyourself\nhave i been\nawake for\n16 hours\nif the answer to that question is no\nyour goal tomorrow is to go to sleep at\nthe same time and have that turn that\nquestion into a yes\nokay so\nthe solution to that is\nwake up earlier\nright because remember your metabolic\nsubstrates haven't built up to help you\nfall asleep if you haven't been awake\nfor 16 hours so your answer is to wake\nup earlier\nby the way you may be a zombie\ngg just let your circadian rhythm\nbalance after three days it's gonna be\ntough\nright but this is what you're gonna need\nto do the good news is even after one\nday you may start to feel a little bit\nbetter okay\nso the next thing to think a little bit\nabout\nis your let me just make sure\num okay yeah so next thing to think\nabout is does your body\nknow\nit is time to sleep\nand you may ask\nme\ndr k how does my body know whether it is\ntime to sleep or not and this is where\nlike we talked about this right what are\nthe ways in which your body knows that\nit's been time to sleep so we've talked\nabout being awake for 16 hours\nwhat has your light exposure been like\nhave you been stuck in a room all day\nbecause if the answer to that question\nis yes your body is really confused\nwhat's your technology use like\nand if your body is like oh if you've\nbeen like sitting in a room without\nwindows for the last\n16 hours and there's been a constant\nstream of like computer monitor light or\ntv screen light on you then your body\nhas no idea it's time to sleep and it's\ngonna get confused it's gonna be hard to\nfall asleep okay\nnext thing is\nstress and anxiety\ndo you have stress do you have anxiety\nwhat are you stressed out about what are\nyou anxious about this is where things\nget a little bit complicated so you can\nyou know depending on how bad things are\nyou can work with a therapist\nyou can work with a coach\nyou can also just like\nintrospect\nprocess\nwe touch on this all through the rest of\nour stuff so there's a lot of stuff\nabout this in dr k's guide but i can't\ngo into like how to fix stress or\nanxiety like\nin five minutes right it's just not that\nsimple\nbut the truth is that if you're having\ntrouble falling asleep and you're in a\nstressful state\nthat has high cortisol\nthis is going to be activating your raf\nand is going to make it hard for you to\nfall asleep and make you a light sleeper\nso you have to deal with this stuff\nthere are a couple of other specific\npractices so the meditative rewind\npractice which is in the guide\nis very effective for this\nyoga nidra\nis also very effective for this both\nthose are in the guide we're going to\nteach you guys a different meditation\ntoday\nokay\nso you have to deal with your stress and\nanxiety and then the last thing\nis\ndiet optimization for this so remember\nsince it's a bit the problem\nwhat we really want to do is focus on\nlike cooling kind of heavy\nfoods so you know if you eat yogurt\nwith fruit\ndrizzle\nmaple syrup\nbefore bed this should be your dessert\nright we're gonna get some good\nprotein in there\nsome good antioxidants\nget some vitamin c\nget some\n[Music]\nother stuff fiber\nright it's going to taste yummy because\nthere's a little bit of maple syrup in\nthere now technically ayurveda says you\nshouldn't mix fruit in yogurt you\nshouldn't mix dairy and and fruit but\nwe'll step away for that for a second\num and if eating them together causes\nyou a lot of indigestion and interferes\nwith your sleep then don't do it but i\nthink this is like a really good kind of\ndietary thing that you can have it'll\nhave like some density to it it'll be\nlike somewhat satisfying and it'll\nactually be quite healthy okay\nso\nthis is what to do if you have trouble\nfalling asleep okay so let's recap it's\na bit then balance so your mind will be\nholding on to a few thoughts and keeping\nyou from sleeping\nso there's\ntechniques and stuff around that as well\nbut you know the\nthe main thing is going to be first of\nall have you been awake for 16 hours\nsecond thing is going to be to make sure\nthat your body knows that it's time to\nsleep and how does the body know that\nit's time to sleep it has to do with\nyour light exposure for the day and your\ntechnology exposure for the day\nthird thing to think a little bit about\nis just your stress and anxiety level\nand like as long as those are present\nyou have to understand that that is\ngoing to lead to a clinical impact\nphysiologic impact on your sleep so you\ncan try to do all kinds of other stuff\ntake supplements or whatever but if you\nreally want to be like conquer insomnia\nand sleep like a baby this must be dealt\nwith and oh my goodness dr k that means\nthat i can't fix it tonight yes that is\ncorrect unfortunately you cannot fix\nsleep necessarily in one day sometimes\nit takes weeks if not months the upside\nis that once you learn how to do this\nand you process these problems you could\nbe sleeping like a baby for the next\nfive years\nright and this is like this is the\nproblem with sort of like the\nthe\nsupplement industry is like they're not\ngonna tell you that right like they're\nlike everyone out there is looking for\nan easy fix to sleep\nand so the market provides them with the\nillusion of an easy fix\nthat's scientifically backed for good\nreason\nand then people are just\nlike then the problem propagates right\nand it's because all we all want an easy\nsolution they're like i just want to\nsleep tonight\nand the truth is that if you want to\nconsistently have good sleep day after\nday after day after day it's not going\nto be an easy fix\nunless you've got sleep apnea in which\nyou guys get yourself a sleep ap\ncpap it'll revolutionize your life\nokay\nall right for staying asleep\nthis\nis a vata imbalance\nright so restlessness\nabout that problems\nthis is also where we see things like\nptsd manifest right so you're gonna get\nnightmares\nso the other way to think about it is\nnightmares will not affect falling\nasleep or waking up but they will affect\nthe sleep in the middle so there's like\nearly sleep mid sleep late sleep\nokay\nso key things to start with what's your\ncaffeine intake\nalso true for falling asleep especially\nif you have had caffeine\num\nso other vata things to be aware of is\ntechnology use\nso this isn't just technology used two\nhours before bed although that'll\ndefinitely engage the melatonin circuits\nand things like that\nbut technology used throughout the day\nso if you just overall reduce your\ntechnology use and this is especially\nphone usage in transition points it will\nhelp you sleep i know it sounds crazy\num\nso this is another really important\nthing is routine before bed\nso you really want to not so the the\nhow can i say this so for people who\nhave trouble falling asleep\nsometimes what ends up happening is that\nthey basically the fatigue\ngets so bad that it overcomes\ntheir inability to fall asleep\nright and if you fall asleep that way\nyour sleep is going to be disturbed\nbecause your mind is not ready for sleep\nit's like it doesn't want to sleep but\nthe fatigue overpowers it and then\nyou're kind of like left with a very\nunrestful sleep afterward if that makes\nsense\nso what you want to do is is really be\ncareful about the routine before bed in\nthe cool down period because you want to\nlet your body prepare for a long period\nof rest so cool down period becomes\nreally really important a couple of\nother tips here so weighted blanket\ncan be super super op so sometimes vatas\nreally really like weighted blankets if\nyou also have anxiety so there have been\nclinical studies that show that weighted\nblankets will actually help people with\nanxiety sleep better so if you want to\nuse some device or tool to help you\nsleep stay asleep\nanother interesting question that i'll\nsometimes ask people\nwhen i'm deciding whether to recommend a\nweighted blanket is i will ask them\nwhen you were a baby did you need to be\ntightly swaddled to sleep\nand so they'll ask their parents and\nwhat i've anecdotal but i've seen an\nanecdotal correlation with like how\nswaddled you needed to be to sleep\nproperly and how much you'll respond to\na weighted blanket there's all kinds of\nphysiologic mechanisms psychological\nmechanisms things like that that are\ninvolved with weighted blankets\num so you can even ask your parents did\ni need to be like tightly swaddled or\nwhat\nuh\nokay\nso\nyeah so temperature control is also\nreally important\nfor the maintenance of sleep\nso you may need to adjust your\ntemperature\num\n[Music]\nyeah another thing you can do to fall\nasleep so we mentioned a couple of these\nthings like audio books and stuff like\nthat\nokay\nnext thing is tired in the am\nokay so if you're tired in the morning\nthis is a kapha imbalance\nor difficulty waking up\nokay\nso you want to use kapha alleviating\ndiets right so you want to eat food that\nis\nlight dry\nand sour right the other way to kind of\nthink about that is if you eat lightly\nthe night before\nwe're gonna let's let's kind of reverse\nthe process and think about physiology\nso if i don't have a burrito before bed\nwhat's gonna happen right so i'm so if i\nhave a burrito before bed\nlet's just look at the burrito\nif i eat a burrito\nmy blood sugar\nso blood sugar is going to be white\nis going to go up\nand then fall over the course of the\nnight okay\nand then when i i'm going to make\nsomething called glycogen which is my\nsugar stores\nso my sugar stores will also like\nbe high until i'm low right\nand so like at this point\nwhen i wake up let's say this is 8 a.m\ni'm gonna have a lot of glycogen\nso i'm not going to be\nstarving at all\nso if i eat lightly instead\nwhat's going to happen let's say i eat\nlightly\nand then i don't have any insulin spike\nso let's take the non-burrito\nlet's say light meal before bed\nmy blood sugar basically stays\nthe new blood the new glucose that i'm\nadding to the system stays low\nand my my glycogen which is high is\ngoing to decrease over the course of the\nnight\nand then at 8 am\ni'm a\nhungry so it'll be easier to wake up\nif you eat lightly right so glycogen\nstores last for about eight hours\nand so eight hours after your\nglycogen starts being broken down you\nwill start to feel hungry and you want\nto use that hunger to make help yourself\nwake up\nso other tips that you want to do\nokay so\neat lightly\nideally not at all\nbefore bed\nokay\nnext thing that you want to do\nno blinds so try to sleep in a room that\ngets sunlight so i don't know if y'all\nhave ever had this annoying experience\nhave you ever had like an experience\nwhere the sun is right in your eyes when\nyou're trying to sleep because of like\nsome place that you're sleeping it's\nsuper super uncomfortable so no blinds\nlet that sunlight hit you in the face\nand wake you up\nson wakes you up\nlet it wake you up that's what it's\nthere for\nit's annoying in your eyes\nright and so it's kind of interesting\nbecause just think about this for a\nsecond\nyour eyes could have evolved to be\nthicker\nyou all get that your eyes could have\nevolved to be blackout curtains that are\ncompletely able to black out the sun but\nthey evolved to be a certain degree of\ntransparency so that your body knows\nwhen to wake up when the sunlight is in\nyour eyes\nthat's the way that they were made it's\nsupposed to wake you up\nand so when the sunlight flashes in your\neyes\nright you don't look at the sun just\nkeep keep your eyes closed it'll\nturn off melatonin production and you'll\nstart to wake up\nit's exactly like how it's supposed to\nhappen and if you use blackout curtains\nor you're in a room with no natural\nsunlight it's gonna be hard to wake up\nokay\nso\nother thing is that\ni know it's kind of kind of weird but\nyou want to try to wake up early\nso you can go to bed early\nwhich in turn means that you're you'll\nstart to reduce your adenosine\nat let's say 9 pm\nwhich will in turn allow you to wake up\nvery naturally because then your\nmetabolic like triggers are also going\nto be active and they'll help you wake\nup at like\nfive in the morning\nother other tip\nthis is a key key\nkey tip\nif you are having trouble waking up in\nthe morning so let's say you have\ntrouble at 7am\nyou don't need to sleep in you need to\nwake up earlier so try to wake up at 5am\nyou will be amazed some percentage of\nyou will find it way easier to wake up\nat 5 a.m than you will at 7 a.m so\nthere's circadian rhythm factors here\nthere's also\nsleep cycle factors here\nright when i say sleep cycle factors i'm\ntalking about this stuff\nwhere's the sleep cycle\ni'm yeah\nright so like 8 am\neight a.m maybe here\nand like\nfive a.m maybe here right between your\nsleep cycles where it's easy to wake up\nso i know it's kind of weird because\npeople were asking how do you wake up\nin between your cycles and some of it is\ncircadian\nso it's like hard like it's very\nindividualized\nbut oftentimes if you have trouble\nwaking up in the morning the solution is\nto not sleep in but actually try to wake\nup earlier and you will be stunned at\nhow easy it is to wake up at 5am instead\nof 7am\nthere's also a lot of evolutionary\nbiology about this which is that\nso if we look at\nlike for example\nvisual acuity\nis highest\nfor mammals\nat dawn\nand dusk\nand why is that it's because we're\ndesigned to be awake so you have\nmillions or billions of your hundreds of\nmillions of years of evolution that is\ntrying to get you up at like five in the\nmorning around the time of dawn\nand so i would adjust your psych like\nlike try to wake up even earlier like if\nyou have if you if you keep on hitting\nthe snooze button at 7 00 am try waking\nup at five you'll be very very surprised\nokay\num and so that's what i would recommend\nfor waking up\nokay\nif you have difficulty waking up\nall right to wrap up we're gonna do\na meditation\num the reason we're gonna do this\nmeditation is\nlet me think about how to say this\nso there's gonna be a different kind of\nmeditation but i want it to be something\nthat can help you fall asleep and can be\ndone easily if you wake up in the middle\nof the night\nso the first thing is we have three\nreally really good meditations\nfor sleep in dr k's guide we're not\ngoing to go into those today\nbecause they're there and that's why\nthey're there\nright so yoga nidra medical rewind i\nmean uh\nmeditative rewind practice\nand catching the moment of sleep i think\nare three really really good meditations\ncatching the moment of sleep meditation\nis really good for someone who has a\nvery inquisitive active mind\nand needs to focus it before bed\num\nand\nyoga nidra is like generally good for\ncool downing uh period and meditative\nrewind practice is really really good\nfor people who have like accumulated a\nlot of emotion or had a rough day\nso what i'm gonna teach y'all today is\nactually uh\nmeditative practice\nlet me think about how to\nsay this\naround darkness okay\nso this is gonna fall into the category\nof being like\nmeditations about the self too\nmeditations kind of around shunya\nbut it's a meditation that you can do\nbasically in the dark\nand so essentially what we're going to\ndo i'm going to walk you all through it\nbut you can do this with your eyes open\nif it's very dark outside or you can do\nit with your eyes closed\nand we're going to kind of notice\nthe limit\nuh how can i say this\nwe're actually going to notice the lack\nof limit\nof the darkness that we experience on\nthe inside so if i close my eyes\ni'm going to have a sense of space\nwhich is determined by my physical body\nbut in my mind\ni'm gonna have blackness\nbut if you really pay attention\nit's gonna you're gonna think originally\nthat the darkness is limited or that the\ndarkness starts somewhere or ends\nsomewhere but really what you're going\nto do is start to realize that what you\nexperience as darkness\nhas no actual limits and it extends\nforever which is sort of terrifying and\nsort of cool and then who are you in\nthat business it's kind of hard to\ndescribe it y'all hopefully you'll get\nit okay\nand so this is something that you can\nalso kind of\nswim into\nin the middle of the night if you wake\nup\nokay\nso\nit it sounds terrifying but that's\nbecause you haven't experienced it it's\nactually incredibly peaceful\nall right so we're going to start by\nsitting up straight and closing our eyes\ni gotta drink something\nalso spill\nokay\nlet's just kind of breathe in and out\nfor me i need to cool down\ni've been talking a lot\nfor those of you who have been listening\nmaybe you're feeling kind of sluggish\nso let the breath start\nby balancing where you are\nif you feel sluggish let the breath\nenergize you big deep inhalation\nand breathe out\nlet it energize you\n[Music]\nand out\nthird breath big deep breath\nyou may feel a little bit light-headed\nor energized\nbut certainly not sluggish\nnot weighed down\nand on the flip side if you feel like\nyou need to calm down\nwhat we're going to do is\nbrief inhalation\nand really stretch out that exhalation\nso breathe in\nand breathe out\nso maybe two three second inhalation\nseven eight nine second exhalation\nanother relatively quick inhalation\nslow slow exhalation\nand now let your breath guide you\nit will turn you into the direction that\nyou need to go\nyou may notice a relatively even deep\nslow breath now\nand so we're gonna sit in that for about\na minute\nif you feel like you might get\ndistracted\nyou can just appreciate\nhow altering the breath artificially\nleads to an equilibriation\nor the relationship between your breath\nand your mind\ntry to notice the nuances or subtleties\nthe feeling of the breath as it is in in\nyou right now\nand now i want you to notice\nthe blackness of your mind\nyou may kind of notice that visually you\nare seeing black\nand you may begin by being anchored to\nyour body\nyou may notice the limits of your body\nin space\nyou may notice that the blackness that\nyou see is on your eyelids alone\nand now start to move beyond your\neyelids\nand notice that the black extends beyond\nthem\nif you are anchored too much in the body\nthen notice the edge of your knees\nthe top of your head\nand notice how you can feel nothing\nbeyond that\nnow follow that nothingness out as far\nas it'll go\nnotice how tiny you truly are\nhow small your body feels\nin the vast emptiness\nand see how even within you\nwithin the limits of your body\nthere's blackness\nit's almost as if the border of your\nbody\nis a paper thin screen\nbetween\nthe void within you\nand the never-ending void outside of you\nand now sit in one of those two places\nand begin to realize that they are one\nand the same\nthat the quality of the emptiness within\nyou\nis the same as the quality of the\nemptiness beyond your body\nand take all of your cares and worries\nyour concerns and your fears\nyour regrets and your anxieties\nand notice how tall how tiny they are\nhow insignificant\ncompared to the vast beyond\nand the well within you\na deep deep well of blackness\nand notice yourself in this moment\nalmost floating\nthe energy\nsuffusing your body\nand find peace\nswim in the ocean of nothing\nlet it wash over you\nsweeping all of your worries away\nand now tell yourself\nit is time to sleep\nor time to work\nor time to wake up\nand from this place\nyou can send it intention towards your\nconscious mind whatever it is\nand that when you break from this place\nwhich is already fading\nnotice how it's fading already\nthat this lingering thought will be\nthere\nand whatever intention you have set\nyourself\nwill come to be\ntake a deep breath\nand return yourself to the\nworld or drift yourself to sleep\nwhatever you choose\nand come on back\nyou"
