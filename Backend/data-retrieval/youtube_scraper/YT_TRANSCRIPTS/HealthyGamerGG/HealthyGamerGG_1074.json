    "transcript": "you have it like it is a thing and then\nyou were like everyone loves having sex\nsex is fantastic we also think that it's\ngreat every single time like man I got\nlaid it was so awesome dude like oh my\nGod like oh man getting laid like oh my\nGod laid late late\nso\nI am a former incel 32m okay\nwho had sex for the first time today and\nwas grossed out\nafter a two-year self-improvement\njourney I was able to get a woman to\nsleep with me on our fifth date\nprior to sex she said she might even\nbecome my girlfriend if we continue to\nget along and bond with each other later\nthat evening we hooked up\nI'm not sure what I was expecting to\nfeel but my eggplant felt really weird\ninside I didn't bother to finish because\nI lost my boner got a little queasy and\njust said I wasn't ready after all she\nknew my situation so she was supportive\nand hugged me I have big fingers and I\nplay guitar so I was able to get her off\nusing my hands perhaps that's why we're\nmeeting again this Tuesday she said she\nstill might become my girlfriend am I\nactually some sort of asexual have I\ndamaged my eggplant from 18 years of\njerking off\nI can easily uh jerk off thinking of\nthis girl so I know the plumbing works\nby the way I successfully completed no\nnot November in an attempt to escape\nporn addiction and be interested in real\nsex\nso I am sad that I didn't succeed when\nthe time came\num\nor the time didn't come\nuh edit during my lonely years I\ndeveloped some disturbing porn fetishes\nthat got really bad after a knee surgery\nthat left me laid up in bed for for\nweeks hitchhiking to squirt City three\ntimes a day that's one of the reasons\nwhy I did know not November I worry that\nthe porn preferences might be corrupting\nmy normal sexual appetite\nokay\nso apologies for the the trolling\ncomment um so I think this is a really\nexcellent post because I think it\nhighlights a couple of things the first\nis that\nyou know incels believe\njust like we were saying they have this\nlike fantasy of what sex is like right\nand they think like oh if I can just get\na woman to sleep with me I will no\nlonger be an incel and everything will\nbe amazing right so they they sort of\nhave this idea that if you are if you\nhave sex a single time then you are like\nno longer the incel and everything for\nyou is like golden after that you become\nyou become one with the Chads like you\ngraduate from incel to Chad and once you\ngraduate from install to chat then like\nyou're totally fine and everything is\nsuper easy for you and I think this is\nthe unfortunate thing is they're wronged\nabout that and you can be happy as an\nincel sort of or let me put it this way\nour society places a bizarre value on\nsex right and we think that once you\nhave sex you've crossed some sort of\nthreshold to where there's like you're\nin the promised land where everything\nyou're confident and Rich and powerful\nand all these other things and but\nthat's just not how it is right so and I\nthink this is a really great post\nbecause it illustrates the simple truth\nof like how\num how complicated sex is and how just\ngetting laid is not going to fix all\nyour problems okay so let's talk about\nthis for a second\nso this is going to be a little bit more\ngraphic but I think it's really really\nimportant to understand\num\nyou know like\nsex and and what it means to people and\nhow to get out of the situation this is\nuh uh unfortunately a situation or\nfortunately depending on how you look at\nit I've worked with a fair number of\npeople who are sort of in this situation\nand I have also helped them get out of\nthe situation so we're going to kind of\ntalk a little bit about how to deal with\nthis\nso let's start off by sort of thinking\nthrough like the key points of this this\nperson's post so the first is that they\nare a former incel so the person that\nthey identified with being an insult\nsecond thing is they have worked on\nthemselves for two years completed no\nnot November went like Chad mode Sigma\nmail right and then like managed to\nstart dating and and were able to engage\nin a sexual relationship with uh a\npartner I think it's a woman right uh\nsame girlfriend so let's assume woman\nthe other thing that I want to tell this\nperson is like\nthis woman is worth her weight in gold\nright so like this is just something I\nwant to say like the ability to\nunderstand where you're coming from be\nemotionally available for you and sort\nof like be patient with you\nas you're going through this journey is\nlike amazing you really got lucky\nbecause there are many people out there\nwho may not be as willing to like hold\nyour hand through this journey which is\nexactly what it's going to be it's going\nto be a journey\nso everyone so now what we're going to\ndo is talk a little bit about sex and\nhow we envisioned sex so we envisioned\nsex as like some sort of like Milestone\nwhere it's like once you have it like it\nis a thing and then you were like\neveryone loves having sex sex is\nfantastic we also think that it's great\nevery single time like man I got laid it\nwas so awesome dude like oh my God like\noh man getting laid like oh my God laid\nlaid laid\nso we definitely romanticized the idea\nof sex we also romanticize the idea of\nboth being a virgin and no longer being\na virgin right we attach all kinds of\ndifferent like myths\nand and other kinds of like\nthings to sex\nso let's just kind of quickly talk about\nthe myths of sex\nlet me see if I yeah okay it's funny I\nwas I was actually\ntalking about this earlier so let's talk\nabout\nthe way that we romanticize and\nmythologize sex okay\nall right so myth number one\nthe first time you do it\nit's gonna be amazing\noftentimes not true I think especially\nuh I think women have this experience\nmore often than men oh wait we're not\nyou guys can see okay\nthe myths of sex so the first time you\ndo it it's gonna be amazing\nmyth number two\nevery time you do it\nit's gonna be amazing\nalso not true okay\nso the truth is that is that sex is just\nlike anything else so I'd say it's like\nalmost like cooking where you know you\ncan cook an amazing meal and it can be\nsuper super delicious\nbut the first time you cook something\nit's probably not going to be like that\ngreat right and I think especially I've\nhad this experience more with women that\nI've worked with where oftentimes the\nfirst time they have sex it's like\npainful somewhat pleasurable oftentimes\nthe first time that women have sex\nespecially if it's if it's like\nteenagers for example\num you know the person they're having\nsex with may not know exactly how to\nbring them to orgasm because it's like\nnot quite as intuitive for women as it\nis with men\num so you know there's this idea that\nthe first time you have sex it's\nsupposed to be like this amazing thing\nright so also like in in cultures like\nthe incel culture like they they will\nmythologize and and kind of fantasize\nabout what this first sexual experience\nis whereas the truth of the matter is\nfor many people the first sexual\nexperience is like awkward and\nunfulfilling\nand this is exacerbated by the fact that\nthere's so many like mythologies or\nfantasies about it right like we have\nall these movies that condition us like\noh like there are two people and they're\nkissing by the moon and then like the\nmusic starts playing and then like it's\nlike the next morning and it's like\neveryone's like smiling at each other\nand they're like oh my God that was\namazing that's just not how it works\nright sex just like anything else in\nlife is gonna be like awkward and\nunfulfilling until you get the hang of\nit\nand so this is the first thing to\nunderstand okay\nnext thing to understand is that there\nare a lot of different things that can\nmake sex difficult so this person is\ndealing with like you know Common\ndifficulties\nokay\nso the first is death grip syndrome\nso this is just a very physical\nconditioning thing so our body gets like\nconditioned based on particular things\nit's almost like a pavlovian response so\nthis I see a lot in men who have sex\nlike later in life right so we're not\nmaybe like not the first few years but\nyou know if you've been masturbating for\n18 years\nwhat's going to happen is that your body\nis going to require a certain kind of\nstimulation to achieve climax because\nyou've trained it right like you've\nessentially like trained your penis like\na dog and I'm not saying that to be\nmimish I'm saying like there's like\npavlovian conditioning going on so\nthere's a certain amount of grip\nstrength\nthere's a certain lack of lubrication\nthere's like a certain thing that like\nyou've just\ntrained your body to respond to okay and\nso this is where it can be kind of\ninteresting but then when people\nactually engage in in sexual intercourse\nlike vaginal intercourse what they tend\nto find is that vaginal intercourse does\nnot work\nand it doesn't get them to orgasm and\nthen this creates like a psychological\nproblem which then this person sort of\ngets into right and they're kind of like\nwait wait like this is kind of like\ngross and Queasy there are kind of\ndifferent psychological problems like am\nI messed up\num I think this is am I asexual right so\nthis person has this concern\nand then these psychological problems\nwill then in turn lead to\nyou know flaccidity which then in turn\nwill lead to shame\nwhich then will kind of lead to more\npsychological problems and then they've\nkind of like gg'd out\nright it becomes a cycle\nso the truth of the matter is that\nyou're not messed up you've just\nconditioned your body in a certain way\nand the good news is that you can like\ndecondition it as well so this is where\num and okay does that make sense do I\nneed to explain that more are you all\ngood with that okay\nso this is where you know if you've got\ndeath grip syndrome there are things\nthat you can do so if we kind of think\nabout you know the vagina\nand we've got Darth Vader over here\nright like what are the different\nfeatures that you need to like kind of\nget from so one is a lot of times people\nwho are in this situation use no lube\nso what you want to start doing is and\nthis is highly lubricated\nright so what you want to start doing is\nlike start using lotion\nsecond thing is that you know\nI don't know how to say I'm trying to\nsay this without being mimish but you\nknow you know the the PSI the pounds per\nsquare inch that your hand is able to\nexert is going to be like greater than\nyou know the PSI for the vag is going to\nbe like a little bit lower right so what\nyou want to do is looser grip\nso these are the two biggest things that\nyou can do for death grip syndrome okay\nand if you do these you'll\nphysiologically reentrain yourself it's\ngoing to feel very unsatisfying because\nlike you're going to want to squeeze\nharder and you're going to want to use\nless lotion because this is what you\nneed\nto climax right\nand so the next thing that we can do so\nin terms of a sexual relationship like\nyou know I'm not saying you should go\nmonk mode for the next two months and\nand just masturbate using these things\nso thankfully it sounds like you've got\na pretty supportive partner so now we're\ngonna\nOkay so we've got a man and we've got a\nwoman okay so let's just add some hair\nhere and then if we kind of think about\nwe've got hands\nwe've got genitals\nwe've got breasts\nokay this is the kind of thing where if\nyou just like label the erogenous zones\nlike your partner can get involved right\nso this is going to get a little bit\ngraphic but like you know you've got\nerogen the Zone number the ways of\ndelivering and receiving pleasure one\ntwo three four okay we're gonna steer\nclear of stuff like maybe there's a five\nover here if you wanna\nconsider buttholes or scrotums or\nwhatever\nI don't know if you guys can even see\nthose numbers\nyeah sure let's let's be complete so\nlet's five and six are down there okay\nif you want to get really crazy\num you know feet can be erogenous zones\nso there's evidence for example\nthat there are uh non-insulated neurons\num\nin the feet of especially this is maybe\neven gender specific more gender\nspecific so this is going to sound kind\nof weird so you have a spinal cord right\nand so if we think about the human body\nlike here's your your shoulders\nright and then here's like let's say uh\nyou know your chest\nand then down here we've got genital\nnerves\nand then like over here we've got foot\nnerves\nthat kind of come in over here and it's\nreally interesting because there's even\na there's a cool hypothesis that I was\nlooking at that if you look at the\nanatomy\nthere are non-insulated nerves that from\nthe feet and genitals that run next to\neach other so there may be actually an\nelectrical impulse that can travel from\na foot nerve to the genital nerves\nespecially in women I don't know how\nreally true this is to be honest but\nthere's some evidence to this which\nsuggests that part of the reason that\nwomen may be able to get some degree of\nsexual arousal from feet is through even\nlike anatomical there may be anatomical\ncorrelations here so it's not just\npsychological\nand then if we kind of think about your\npartner right so let's start from the\ntop one\ntwo three four\nfive\nsix seven\nright so this is where like if you're\njust thinking about you know if you're\nin this situation how do you have sex\nwith a partner there are a lot of\noptions is the short answer right\nso like even if you are and what I\nrecommend is that you like naturally get\nyou you sort of start combine Bridging\nthe two right so it doesn't have to be\nthree plus six right it can be like over\nhere you can do one plus three and then\nyou know engaging with your partner like\nfour plus one or four plus six\num you know or four plus two\nyou know or your two with their six and\nI'm trying to keep this as as\nprofessional as possible right and I'm\ngonna try not to be like oh yeah you\ncould like squeeze in a little bit of\nlike three plus two you know and add a\nlittle bit of four plus eight if you\nknow what I mean\nand and you know there's a lot of stuff\nthat you could do my point is that you\ncan kind of get creative and much like\ncooking it's about like balancing\nflavors and like trying different kinds\nof stuff\nright and and so I I know this is I know\nwhen it comes to sex people are like\nautomatically like oh my God like ah but\nthe truth is that there's a lot of\nscience here like this is an important\npart of Health it's an important part of\npsychology and so over time what you can\ngradually do is like you can basically\nlike if your hand is what you need maybe\nlike you're using your hand or maybe she\ncan use her hand right like if what you\nneed is\nuh you know minimal lube and and a tight\ngrip like you can kind of show her how\nand so that she can still be involved in\nthe process like you can be involved in\nthe process and then over time\num you know you can you can do like\ndifferent things and you can even like\nyou know they're they're different\ncombos that you can do I'm not going to\ngo into a lot of detail but I mean you\ncan get quite detailed so in terms of\nsome of the Sex Therapy that I've done\nlike it gets like super super detailed\nwith like even transition points and\nstuff like that it's like you can get 90\nof the way there using one thing and\nwhen you're super super close you\ntransition to something else which will\nin a sense kill it but if you're close\nenough you'll kind of still make it the\nrest of the way there and it may not be\nperfectly satisfying but then your body\nwill have entrained itself a little bit\nto you know finish up in a place where\nit didn't start you guys get what I'm\nsaying\ndoes that make sense\nright so I don't really feel like this\nis appropriate to go into too much\ndetail on stream\nyeah like Wombo Combo right\nand and so does that does that make\nsense like the truth is you can do a lot\nhere okay\num\nso does that so questions so let me just\nkind of summarize so like if you're you\nknow if you have this myth that like\nhaving sex is just going to be amazing\nthe first time around\nand especially if you've been\nmasturbating you know for years and\nyears and years\nsex is not going to be just amazing the\nfirst time you do it right it's like\nit's a practice like it's something that\nyou do with your body and your mind that\nsure there's a lot of like biological\ndrivers which are like sort of telling\nyou what to do but if you've conditioned\nyour body for 18 years to respond to\nsomething else you have to like start\nthe process of like conditioning it\ntowards where you want to go and you can\nabsolutely do that so the way that I'd\nsort of describe this is almost like\neating spicy food\nlike spicy food can be absolutely\namazing I absolutely love it and the\nfirst time you have it like if you go\ntoo far you may go way too fat like you\nknow maybe like a terrible experience\nfor you and then what happens is we have\nso much discussion I I genuinely think\nthis is a problem we have so much\ndiscussion about variable sexuality that\nsomeone will have a\nnegative sexual experience and start to\nwonder oh am I asexual they'll go down\nthe echo chamber of asexual content\nconclude that they are asexual which\ncould be true but the the simple truth\nof the matter is that you may just have\nhad a bad sexual experience and like\nyou're not really asexual you just need\nto recondition your body you can be like\na you know\nnormative sexual behavior\nit doesn't mean you're asexual like you\ncan actually transition from here to\nhere\nand if you sort of adopt that label\nright from the get-go\nthen you may actually be missing out on\na lot of things so when I'm supporting\npeople through their own journeys of\ndiscovering their sexuality like this is\na really important point right that it\ntakes some time and some experimentation\nto figure things out just because you\nhave a negative experience and there are\na lot of people out there who will say\nlike if you post this on a forum for\nasexual people\nsince the asexual people are trying to\nbe supportive of each other what they\nmay say is they're like yeah you're\nasexual like that was my experience as\nwell this was my journey it's okay to be\nasexual you're asexual you know they may\nsay things like that in an effort to be\nsupportive and that could actually like\nbe you know\nhave a negative impact on that person\nI can feel the Shakti leaving my body\nduring this convo well\nwe'll try to get your Shakti back later\nokay\nOkay so\nyou know for this person don't give up\nyet\nuh you really lucked out in terms of who\nyou ended up\ndating\num you know give yourself some time give\nyourself some patience\nand uh yeah\nbe patient with yourself I think that's\nthe most important thing\nokay\nall right so we've got kind of a\ndifferent one now\noh chat\nokay different one okay\nokay\nso next up we've got a post from a\nparent\num\nalso\noh\nalso just one other myth that I want to\ntry to spell for a second\nso I see this posted on the internet a\nlot where like people will post and\nthey'll say that they'll talk about the\nnumber of vagina the number of penises\nthat\nhow can I say this delicately\nso people will say that like if you've\nbeen if a woman has had sex with a lot\nof different men that her vagina will be\nloose\nand for some reason they think that\nhaving sex with the same penis over and\nover again does not make it loose\nso I don't know how else to say this but\nlike just because you take big bites of\na Subway sandwich doesn't mean that your\nmouth is like hanging open\nall the time\ndoes that make sense chat\noh God why is this not focusing\nFocus\nautofocus\nright just just because you eat a lot of\nthe subway doesn't mean your mouth is\nlike this all the time right you're the\nbody is elastic like opening your mouth\nreally big and taking big bites does not\ngive you like a very loose mouth\nand in the same way having sex with one\npenis or lots of penises does not alter\nthe elasticity of your vagina it's just\nnot physiologic like I don't know where\npeople get this idea like just because\nyou poop out huge turds does not give\nyou like a loose [ __ ] it just\nyou know like it's just not how it works\nlike I'm sure that's going to get\nclipped out of context or whatever but\njust saying chat like you need to\nunderstand that right do we get are we\nall on the same page there\nit's just physiologically it's like no\namount of sticking your finger in your\nnose is going to give you like a\ngigantic nostril like it's just not how\nit works\ngot it\nokay\nI was like I just tuned in yeah sorry\nabout that I don't know like so I\nstruggle with saying things like that on\nstream because I recognize that people\nare gonna think it's like mimish but\nit's also like people are out there\nsaying this right people believe this\nlike I don't know where they get this\nidea\num so\nyou know\nanyway\nlike seriously like I think that's part\nof our mission here and and we can't we\ncan't avoid or maybe we should so I'm\nopen to feedback if people think that\nthis was a mistake on stream maybe my\nteam will tell me like don't say things\nlike this but if you all think this is\ngood on stream like please let us know\nif you guys think that it's not good on\nstream and you think that it does\ndeplete your Shakti and we shouldn't be\ntalking about this stuff please let us\nknow\num because I I think once again we have\nso many like romantic or mythologized\nNotions about sexuality that like people\nwill think that oh if I have sex with\nlots of men like I will have a lucid\nvagina like women will think that too\nright like men will like start dating\nsomeone and you really like someone but\nyou have this myth that if they've had\nmore Partners than you have then\nand then you break up with them and it's\nlike you're missing out on something\nyou're judging that person like arguably\nunfairly maybe you're judging them\nfairly you're allowed to make whatever\njudgments you want to\num so I I it's hard because there's a\nlot of stuff out there that is meme\nfriendly but it's also like really\nimportant PSAs"
