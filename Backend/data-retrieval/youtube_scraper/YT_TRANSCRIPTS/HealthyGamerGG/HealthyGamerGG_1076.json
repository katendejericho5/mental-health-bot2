    "transcript": "i don't know where we got the idea for\nlike what the rules of life are right\nlike where did we get this idea that you\ndon't have to work\nwhere do we get this idea that it has to\nbe like\nf you know it it's supposed to be\neffortless\nthat it's supposed to be fun like where\ndid we get like what what are the rules\nso people asked me some time ago\ndr k do you have rules for life like\njordan peterson does i was like no i\ndon't really but for the sake of the\nmemes like here's 12 rules for y'all\nrule number one\nyour spawning your spawn point is rng\nspawn points are not balanced\nlike where you you spawn in this world\nwhat your stats are what your race is\nwhat your gender is you don't get to\npick any of that crap so understand\nthat your spawn point is just rng it's a\ncrapshoot\nthis is also the concept of karma where\nyou don't get to control what what\nhand of cards you're dealt in life you\njust get to control how you play it\non the rule number two life isn't\nsupposed to be anything life is a\nsandbox game\nso like we come into life and we think\nlike oh it's supposed to be fun it's\nsupposed to be like engaging it's\nsupposed to be this i'm entitled to this\nyou know\ni shouldn't have to deal with this\nit's unfair this\nlife is a sandbox game it's not supposed\nto be anything\nlife is what you make it like literally\nit is the sandbox\nit's like i can go outside and walk\naround naked if i want to\ni can eat nothing but tacos for the rest\nof my life if i want to\ni can work if i want to i cannot work if\ni don't want to\nlife is what you make it and it is a\nsandbox game so let go of what it's\nsupposed to be and look at what it\nactually is\nrule number three\nit's your choice whether life is pvp or\nco-op\nyou get to decide what mode you're\nplaying in right and this goes back to\nall the crap that we've talked about\nwhen someone else needs help you can\nchoose to invalidate them tell them that\nthey're wrong\nor you can choose to help them when you\nneed help\nyou can choose to ask for it\nyou can attack other people or you can\nbe supportive of other people\nlife is like it's pvp or pve like you\nget to pick\nso try to think about which one you\nreally want and how you're playing the\ngame of life\nso are you playing in co-op mode are you\nplaying in pvp mode when someone else\nneeds help like what do you do about\nthat\ndo you help them or do you like do you\nspend your time trolling around on the\ninternet posting about you know how like\nlike the world is sad and everyone is\nscrewed up and like oh kids nowadays\nblah blah blah yadda yadda\nthe world is going to [ __ ] do you sit\nthere complaining about her you like\nactually get up and do something about\nit\nnext rule\nthere are world bosses and these world\nbosses cannot be defeated on their own\nso this is something that we've really\nreally really got to understand so there\nare problems that we face like yesterday\ni was like okay so there was a school\nshooting and misogyny is a problem in\nour community i guess i have to fix\nthose tomorrow\nhow do i fix those problems i can't\ndr k cannot fix misogyny on the internet\nand he cannot stop school shootings i\ncan't do it i can't stop climate change\ni can't do it\nso what do i do about that i get up and\ni [ __ ] try\nsame is true for all the rest of you\nit's just like a world boss\nyou can't down a world bus\nthe only way that the world boss goes\ndown is if everyone tries to do what is\ninsufficient\nthat is the way that you tackle world\nbosses in this world\neveryone tries to do what they know in\ntheir hearts to be completely\ninsufficient\nno snowflake believes it is responsible\nfor the avalanche\nrule number five\nthere is no respawning\nand the servers are going to go offline\nafter 72 years on average\nso you get one shot at this life\nyou don't get to respawn if you [ __ ] it\nup you [ __ ] it up\nthe servers are going to go offline in\n72 years the clock is ticking\nwhat are you going to do with it how are\nyou going to play this\ngame because it's you don't have an\ninfinite amount of tries you don't get\nto respawn\nthere aren't one-ups\nthere's no like you know\nthere's no cheat codes\nit's just this is what you get\nand so how are you going to use it\nnext thing to understand\nthere's no exponential xp requirement to\nlevel up and content doesn't expire\nso what this means is that\nit's not like a video game where like\nthe amount of time it takes to level up\nincreases as you get higher level that's\nnot true\nthe amount of time it takes to learn\nsomething is static\nthe amount of time it takes to become\nproficient in language is largely static\nthe amount of time it learns to takes to\nlearn a video game is largely static\nyou can graduate from college in four\nyears you can start at 16 26 36 or 66.\nfour years is what it takes to graduate\nfrom college two years is what it takes\nto put your life together\none year is what it takes to start to\nput your life together three months is\nwhat it takes to like take the first\ncouple of steps\nyou can put your life together whenever\nyou want to the content doesn't expire\nyou can go to college whenever you want\nto or not go to college content is out\nthere you can have never had a\ngirlfriend you can start dating tomorrow\nyou can be a virgin at the age of 30 and\nbe having a ton of sex at the age of 40.\nthe content's there it's just when you\nchoose to engage with it\nfurthermore just because you've wasted\nsome amount of time this is the way the\nxp exponential xp thing comes in doesn't\nmean that you can't\ndo it\nbut\nthat doesn't apply so just because\nyou've wasted time learning one skill\ndoes not make it harder to learn other\nskills that's just not true\nright you can just like like literally\nlike you can i have a book here\nsvara yoga\nthe tantric science of brain breathing\nand like this book takes the same damn\namount of time to read whether i'm 50 40\n10 whatever\nso the work is the same do you guys get\nthat like the rest of it is all bs\nyour emotions and your being behind in\nlife and like what other people have\nlike\nmen have it easier women have it easier\na book is a book you read it or you\ndon't read it\nthe content is there and it never\nexpires\nnext thing\nbeware people who sell walk-throughs to\nsandbox games\nokay\nso this is the other thing remember how\nwe said that it isn't supposed to be\nanything and that life is a sandbox game\nso be careful for people who sell\nwalkthroughs to open world games where\nyou can do whatever you want to\nhere in my garage i have a lamborghini\nright\nso be careful about that\nso like i'm not saying that there isn't\nsomething to learn from those people and\ni certainly fall into this category as\nwell right just beware because there\nisn't a walk-through to the game of life\nand so if we want to understand this\nthis goes back to like the spawn point\nthe rng karma\nno one is going to have perfect\ninformation about what you should do\nwith your life and that's because they\nhaven't lived your life\nthey may understand some approximation\nof your life they may understand some\npieces of it but literally it is\nimpossible to put a walk-through for\nyour life and anyone selling you a\nwalk-through for your life that will\nturn everything around is someone that\nyou should be very careful of\ni'm included in that\nso watch out for that because your the\nwalkthrough for your life can only be\ndetermined by you you're a very unique\ncharacter who has your own stats was\nborn at a particular time with certain\nstarting equipment that no one else has\never had\nhas your own experiences you spawn in a\ncertain world where you got exposed to\nthese random people who became your\nparty members\nother people who became your bullies you\ngot aggroed by this thing\nyou know like it's unique so beware\npeople who offer you generic solutions\nto your unique life\nnext thing\nso i know a lot of people in this\ncountry so i think this is rule\n678\na lot of people in in this community\nsorry want to help other people so\nhere's the thing that you gotta\nunderstand if you wanna carry other\npeople through content you gotta be\ngeared up yourself\njust like a video game\nso if i want to carry my friends like if\ni want to carry my friends and help them\ngain a thousand mmr\nlike if they're 2k mmr and i want to\ncarry them to 3k mmr i need to be 6k mmr\nif you've got friends who are like\nrunning low level dungeons and you want\nto carry them through it you need to be\ngeared out\nso i know that a lot of people in this\ncommunity want to help other people but\nyou all need to understand if you want\nto help another human being you need to\nhave your own [ __ ] in order first\nput on your own oxygen mask before you\ngo and put on someone else's\nthis actually causes damage\nwe've had to actually terminate or fire\ncoaches for this reason\nlike think about not coaches one\nso you need to get your own stuff in\norder like i totally get that you want\nto understand other people this comes\nback to dharma as well people like how\ndo i find my dharma like oh my god\nthere's so much suffering in the world\nit's like get your own [ __ ] in order bro\nor girl\nyou know start with yourself because if\nyou want to carry other people through\ncontent that's something i know you all\nunderstand y'all play video games\nif you want to carry your team in\nvalorent like you can be a otp like\ntotally fine\nbut you got to be really really good at\nthat trick\nright you can be a one-trick pony and\ncarry other people with it whatever\nso if you want to help other people you\nwant to carry other people you need to\nbe geared out you need to be decked out\nfirst so your first dharma if you want\nto make the world a better place\nis fix yourself become strong become\nindependent become capable\nbecome confident\nand then people like oh how do i do that\nbeware the confusion of the brain\nbeware the complexity of the addictive\nmind here's another tidbit about the\naddictive mind it loves complexity\ndo you guys get that the more complex a\nproblem is the more the addictive mind\ncan like hide in that complexity the\nmore variables there are there are more\nthings i can try to address or\nmanipulate to avoid the\nconclusion so addictive minds love\ncomplexity because then it's like oh but\nwhat about this but what about this but\nwhat about this but what about this and\nthe more complex the problem the more\nparalysis you're allowed\nbecause i haven't accounted for that yet\ni don't need to act yet what about this\nwhat about this what about this haha\nanother day has gone by another week has\ngone by another year has gone by another\ndecade has gone by because i've been\nthinking what about this but what about\nthis but what about marijuana for\nanxiety\nbeware the complexity of the mind it is\nthe refuge of the addictive brain\nnext thing success is dependent on your\nraid guild if you want a clear endgame\ncontent you got to find a good raid\nguild\nthat's how life works life is not a\nsingle-player rpg it's an online\npersistent universe or offline\npersistent it's a persistent universe of\nsome kind\nright and this is where like it's a sad\ntruth but unfortunately it's true so\nthink about the company that you keep\nbetween the ages of 23 and 27\ni had two groups in my life i had monks\nand i had gamers the time that i spent\nwith monks i did awesome the time that i\nspent with gamers i did nothing\nbetween the ages of\n32 and 36\ni was training at harvard medical school\nthat's one hell of a raid guild let me\ntell you what chat\nit is like top-notch\nraid stuff they know how to clear stuff\nand so what you are depends on the raid\nguild that you're a part of it's\nunfortunate but it's true\nso what we've tried to do is create a\nraid guild\nthat has all spans right we don't we try\nnot to discriminate based on how\nsuccessful you are or how much money you\nmake or whatever\nso the truth of the matter is that what\nwhat bosses you down depend on your raid\nguild\nokay so that's rule number nine so rule\nnumber ten\nany build is viable\ndon't compare\nso this is where a lot of people this\nkind of goes back to the people who are\noffering you a walk through so in the\ngame of life any build is viable you can\nbe an author you can be a doctor you can\nbe\nsomeone who consumes internet\nconsumes things on the internet right so\nlike you can just be someone who just\nwatches youtube videos and then compiles\nthe best youtube videos into a 10 minute\nvideo every single day and that can be a\njob\nany build is viable on the internet and\nthe more that you get caught up\nin what other people are doing\nthe more\nyou're gonna like get confused about\nwhat your build is so if you try to\nmimic a half dozen builds from a half\ndozen people\nthen you're gonna end up failing\nbut anything is viable so a good example\nof this is if you guys play moba have\nyou guys y'all ever done this thing\nwhere it's like you're playing a game of\n5v5 right so let's do the law whatever\nand you get crushed\nby a hero on the enemy team you're like\nthat hero's so op\nyou pick that hero in the next game\nyou're like i'm a dump on these shitties\nwhat happens\nyou get owned\nand there's a different hero that's op\nand then you're like oh that hero's so\n[ __ ] op i'm gonna pick that one i'm\ngonna crush these noobs\nyou play that one and you get owned\nit's like stop looking at what other\npeople are playing and start to play\nyour own [ __ ] game\nany build is viable just do what you do\nwell\nrule number 11 exploit the meta\nso just like video games life has a meta\nwe are in a different meta now than we\nwere 50 years ago\nthere are different problems and\ndifferent advantages so for example we\nare now in the adhd meta\nwhat does that mean it means that 20\nyears ago 30 years ago adhd was a\ndisadvantage\nand it probably is still on average a\ndisadvantage today\nbut we literally have a group of\nprofessions\nfor which adhd seems to be a competitive\nadvantage\nso the meta changes over time you just\nneed to realize what your strengths are\nwhat builds are viable and play the\n[ __ ] meta because we're trending\ntowards shorter attention spans so those\nof you with shorter attention spans are\ndoing way better\nfor 10 years i've tried to write a book\ni couldn't my mind is way too vata my\nmind is way too adhd i show up on twitch\nlook what happens\nplay the meta\nwhat's going on in the matter right now\nthe biggest change in the meta they're\ntoo cute two or three huge changes the\nfirst is that the barrier to publication\nis like shrinking to a fraction of what\nit was\nwhat does that mean\nthat means that in like 50 years ago if\ni wanted to write a book\nthere's a big gap between the author and\nthe reader\nhuge gap\ni have to write it a publisher has to\naccept it a publisher has to think that\nenough people want will want to read\nthis book\nit has to be marketed properly now with\nthis thing called the internet i can\nwrite a book in the 10 people that will\nread it so it used to happen in\npublishing is that you couldn't publish\na book unless a hundred thousand people\nwere going to buy it\nand then they'd give the author 10\nright so like\n100 000 people buy it you get 10 percent\nlet's assume each each book is a dollar\nand then so you make 10 000 offer off of\n100 000 sales now with the barrier of\npublication lower maybe only 10 000\npeople will read your book\nbut if you can find that audience and\nyou can write it you get a dollar per\nit's a tenth of the cost of\nyou know\nthe\nthe other book or you still charge 10\nbucks you can end up with 100k instead\nof 10k\ni don't know if y'all i lost you all in\nthe math\nthe point is that the barrier to\npublication is lower you have solo\npeople making games like undertale and\naxiom verge and stuff like that\nright so you can make video games in a\nway that you didn't used to you can make\nmore niche games you can have more niche\ntwitch streams\nbeing a dm apparently is a\nprofession now\nright so like\nexploit the meta recognize that the meta\nis changing the other big thing that's\nchanging about the meta is entertainment\nis now the most important field to\ninvest in\ni think if my my kids want job security\nthey need to be entertainers of some\nkind\nwe're automating everything else\nso like what happens as the amount of\nautomation increases in the world and we\ndon't need humans anymore\nas we get more self-checkout lines as we\nget doc in a box which is like a machine\nat cbs that will soon be prescribing you\nblood pressure medicine\nas we get drone delivery by amazon\nas we get ai generated this and ai\ngenerated that and automated stuff\nand as more human beings are sitting\naround and don't need to work why do you\nthink the anti-work movement is so big\nit's because we're quickly reaching the\npoint where human beings don't need to\nwork\nit used to be that you had to be a\ncontributing member of society for\nsociety function it's actually changing\nyou don't need to work we're moving in\nthe direction of universal basic income\nso now we're going to have a bunch of\npeople who are sitting around with like\nnothing meaningful to do that they\nreally don't need to be doing\nand so old industries are trying to hold\non to old standards that are archaic and\nthen people are unhappy because they\ndon't actually need to be there\nso what are you gonna have a bunch of\npeople\nwith a bunch of time what are they gonna\ndo with their time\nthey need to be entertained why do you\nthink there's such an explosion i do not\nthink it is a coincidence that\nautomation in the explosion of\nentertainment goes hand in hand\n30 years ago how many tv shows were\navailable to watch\ntoday how many tv shows are available to\nwatch\norders of magnitude higher\nthe amount of entertainment that's being\nproduced is\nmind-blowing\nso exploit the meta\nbecause the meta is going to change\nright with you those of y'all that are\ngme crypto whatever\nthat ain't going to stick around for a\nlong time you got to get in on the\nbitcoin billionaire train before it\nbefore it pops like the bubble it is\nright you got to get on this\nbecause the meta is going to change your\nop strat is going to get patched out and\nyou're going to be left with nothing\nthis meta is trash it creates such a bad\nsociety it creates a society whether you\nplay the society well or not determines\nwhether it's trash or not\nright\nand rule number 12\nthe final boss is you\nso case in point everyone's talking\nabout\nproblems\nin the world we're making them external\nso i know it sounds kind of weird\nwhen you play dark souls and you're\nfighting gwyn lord of cinder\nwho determines whether you live or die\nwhen i'm fighting against bowser and\nmario who determines whether i win or\nlose when i'm fighting against sephiroth\nin ff7 who determines whether you win or\nlose\nso we think that the raid boss is an\nexternal thing\nbut it's not it's an internal thing the\nrate like the boss is just the [ __ ]\nboss it's not a raid boss it's not the\nfinal boss it's just another boss\nit's just another mob what's the\ndifference\nbetween gwyn and a skeleton nothing both\nof them can kill you\nthe difference is whether you're good or\nnot\nso this is something y'all really have\nto understand if you ignore all the\nother rules take this one home\nand that's the raid boss is you\nyou're the problem you're what's holding\nyou back\nso time to get good\nchat get good is absolutely right\nand for a meditation on\nfor today\nthis is what we're going to leave you\nwith\nget good\nthink about it\nwalk\nmeditate\nwhat does it mean to get good\nwhat are the things that are holding you\nback in life why the [ __ ] are you\nsmoking pot and watching motivation\nvideos all day\nlike what is really holding you back oh\ni don't want to\ni don't like it\nit's boring\ni'm not motivated\nwhat is the actionable thing in all of\nthose statements\ni i i\nit's not about the skeleton it's not\nabout gwyn it's not about bowser it's\nnot about sephiroth\nall y'all have the same problem i i i i\ni don't want to it's hard\nfor me\nother people have it so much easier than\nme\nme me me me me\nso you're the final raid boss just think\nabout it everything that's holding you\nback in life has nothing to do with\nanything else\nsure is the world [ __ ] sometimes like\nabsolutely don't get me wrong\nthat can depend on your karma and your\nspawn and your rng and things like that\nwe're not saying that gwen doesn't exist\nout there right it's not all skeletons\nand goombas\nthere are bowsers out there there are\ngwyns out there there are sephiroths out\nthere\nbut at the end of the day\nhow that person affects you and whether\nyou wipe to that person or don't wipe to\nthat person depends on you\nso get good chat\nyou"
