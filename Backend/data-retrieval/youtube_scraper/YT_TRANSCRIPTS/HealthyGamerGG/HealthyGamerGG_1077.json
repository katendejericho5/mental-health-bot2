    "transcript": "so yesterday\nthere was a post on our subreddit\nabout how there's a misogyny problem in\nour community\nand so i really appreciate the\nthe post it was um the most upvoted post\nfor you know a while uh there's some\nupvoted posts like if you look\nhistorically the most upvoted posts are\nmemes\nthe most upvoted substantial post we've\never had on our subreddit i think was\nthis post\nand\nin it people were sort of saying like\nmisogyny is a problem in the community\nand dr k should use his platform to\naddress it\nand then i got kind of confused because\ni was like i don't know what that means\ni don't know people i hear this a lot\nlike people toss around this phrase use\nyour platform to address the problem and\nliterally like i don't know what that\nmeans like i don't know how to do that\ndo i just show up here and say misogyny\nis bad y'all should stop doing it is\nthat what people are looking for\nso i asked the question and thankfully i\ngot some awesome answers so i was like i\nthink they figured out what my username\nis so i think they knew it was me\nbut i you know i don't identify myself\nbut i was just like what would that\npractically look like like what what\nwould that mean\nusing the like i don't know how to do\nthat\nand so i got some really awesome answers\nand i really appreciate everyone who\nposted i read the entire thread in\nbasically every comment\nuh so the first thing that i'm gonna do\nis share a little bit about\nyou know what we do and how we approach\nmisogyny and then\ni'm gonna\nchange gears a little bit so the first\nthing is that you know we try to address\nmisogyny\nthrough\nthings like we have like you know women\nin gaming streams and stuff like that\nwe interview a lot of female streamers\nwho will talk about their experiences\nfor example or just women in our\ncommunity who talk about their\nexperiences\nso that's one way that we address it um\nso i you know i thought we were doing\nokay there\num the other thing is that i i tend to\nnot\nsometimes address it directly because\ni think that the real way to address\nmisogyny is by like addressing the human\nbeing underneath and understanding where\nit comes from and sort of helping people\nso for example shunya meditations i\nthink are actually my way of addressing\nmisogyny because the more that you\npractice shunya meditation the less\nmisogynistic or misandristic you will\nbecome\nso i think there's a lot of stuff that i\ntry to do\nand there was also like another part of\nme that was kind of confused because you\nknow i was sort of thinking like if this\nis a misogynistic community like why is\nthis like one of the most upvoted posts\nof all time\nright so it's kind of interesting\nbecause i was like looking at that and i\nwas like oh it's people are actually\nresponding really well and i was\nimagining if someone had posted that in\nthe red pill subreddit for example like\nthat would get down voted into oblivion\nand then i also kind of thought about it\na little bit more and i was like but\nwait it's the most upvoted post so that\nmeans that everyone does think it's a\nproblem so that was like kind of\nconfusing for me so i tend to first of\nall address things somewhat indirectly\nand the reason for that is um\ni just think it's more effective\nso this is where i get concerned about\nthings like virtue signaling so if i\nshow up on stream and i say misogyny is\nbad\ni think that the people who suffer from\nbeing on the receiving end will really\nappreciate that and they'll be like dr k\nis using his platform to address\nmisogyny\nbut i don't know that the person who is\nmisogynistic will actually change so\nthis is where i kind of struggle a\nlittle bit with like\nis fixing misogyny validating the\nvictims of it or is it like trying to\nchange the minds of the perpetrators\nand so that's sort of why we've done\nwhat we've done we try to raise\nawareness of it and things like that and\ni'm directly addressing it now\nso this is what i'm going to say to my\nstrategy\nright and so this is like this is my\nfirst thing to say to people who are not\njust misogynist because i don't know if\nyou identify as a misogynist\nso here i am\nand i have a strategy right like i like\nwe have women in gaming like what's your\nexperience like we interview female\nstreamers and hey look at all this logic\nthat i'm using i'm saying it's the most\nupvoted post\nright our community is like they\nappreciate this if it was truly a\nmisogynistic community they would\ndownvote into oblivion\nso there's a lot of like beliefs that i\nhave about how to address the problem\nthere are a lot of things that i do to\ntry to address the problem\nand despite all of my efforts and\ndespite all of my logic and despite all\nof my idea that i think i'm doing a\ndecent job\nsomeone out there is telling me that hey\nthis is a problem\nso here's the first thing\nif you think you're doing a good job at\nsomething and someone tells you hey\nthis is a problem you should start by\nlistening\nso this is kind of weird but like in my\nexperience\nthe more that you think you know about\nsomething and the more\nsurprised you are by someone's opinion\nyou shouldn't double down on what you\nbelieve you should actually listen to\nthat person even more\nso if you saw that post and you thought\nsort of like i did that like oh look at\nhow much this is getting upvoted it must\nnot be a problem\nyou have to understand that like the\nmore logic that you have to discount\ntheir perspective the more\ncatastrophically incorrect you are\nright because they're not stupid i mean\nyou can assume that other people around\nyou are stupid but despite every all of\nthe reasons why i think we're doing a\ngood job of addressing misogyny the fact\nthat there is a group of people who\nstrongly feel this way means that\nthere's a blind spot so if you have a\nlot of logic about something and people\nare saying things that are contrary to\nthat that is actually an indication that\nthere's a blind spot\nso here's what i'm gonna do because\nhere's my way of trying to address the\nblind spot okay so i don't know exactly\nwhat to say or how to fix that i'm gonna\ndo my best right now and we'll see\nwhether it moves the needle in the right\ndirection or not\nokay so the first thing that i want to\nsay is like i acknowledge that if people\nthink this is a problem\neven though there are a lot of signs\nthat we're moving in the right direction\nif you think it's a problem i'm just\ngoing to accept that at face value and\nif you all think it's a problem okay so\nthen the question becomes okay what are\nwe gonna do about it\nso i'm just gonna share with y'all what\ni have learned about the experience of\nwomen\nso understand that this has a couple of\ncaveats the first is that i'm not a\nwoman so i'm not ever going to truly\nunderstand what it's like to be a woman\nthankfully i've had a lot of experiences\nso i have a profession in which it is my\njob to try to understand people's\nexperiences that are different from what\ni've\nwhat my own\nand so i'm going to share that with you\njust so that i hope that\nmen out there\nwill like\nhopefully understand like a little bit\nof what i've learned\nit's not my place to say that this is\nright or wrong it's not my place to say\nthat you know that's i can't judge that\ni'm just going to share what i've\nlearned\nso\nbasically\nbefore you're born\npresuming you're not like a test tube\nbaby or something like that\nyour dad\nhas\ntestes and in these testes they produce\nsperm\nand sperm\nare have either an x chromosome\nor a y chromosome and then that sperm\ntravels to the egg which has an x\nchromosome and then depending on whether\nit gets fertilized by an x chromosome or\ny chromosome you're [ __ ] in life\nso if you get fertilized by the y\nchromosome you start to play life i know\nit sounds kind of weird and this is\ngoing to be controversial we'll get to\nthis in a second\nyou start to play life on easy mode\nand if you get fertilized with an x\nchromosome you start to\nuh get you start to life on hard mode\nlike it happens then like in the embryo\nand then there's gonna be a lot of\npeople we're gonna get to this in a\nsecond but what about all the\ndifficulties that men face so we'll talk\nabout that in a second and men do face a\nlot of difficulties i think we've done a\ngood job of addressing those and\nvalidating those we'll talk about that a\nlittle bit more so if you reject that\nstatement that's totally fine just\nlisten till the end okay so you may\nwonder like what do you mean dr k like\nmen commit suicide women commit suicide\nlike men struggle women's struggle like\nhow are like how are you able to say\nthat and this is where i'd say like go\nback to the first thing that i said is\nif people are telling you this even if\nit goes against your experience maybe\nthat's a sign of a blind spot so here's\nwhat i've learned so the first thing\npeople talk about circumcision now\ncircumcision is a problem right so like\nsure circumcision is a problem but there\nare literally parts of the world where\nwhen women are born they will cut off\ntheir clitoris\nlike this happens\nright female genital mutilation like\ncircumcision sure i'm not saying that\ncircumcision isn't a problem as well but\nthey're like literally parts in the\nworld just think about that for a second\nso like if you want to understand why\nbeing a woman is on like being born a\nwoman is on hard mode it's like there's\nmaybe like a 10 chance that they're just\ngonna lop off the end of your deck when\nyou're born\nthat is why it's hard mode this happens\nright so there are lots of developing\ncountries where like you don't get to go\nto school\nyou're told to wear particular things\nyou're forced into marrying particular\npeople you may be abused you may be\ngang-raped like there are all kinds of\nthings that happen primarily like to\nwomen right so this is a bad experience\nto have\nand people will say like okay that's\ndeveloping countries like what about the\nwomen here\nand so that's where i also say like it's\nhard mode for them like that's been my\nexperience being married to a woman like\ni think things are like harder for my\nwife than they are for me and this is\nwhere once again a lot of y'all may be\nlike uh simp cuck whatever\nbut just think about this for a second\nokay\nso here's what i think is hard being\nlike a modern woman which is that the\ndefault responsibility is yours\nand if you know what that means you know\nwhat that means and if you don't know\nwhat that means like that shows you the\nproblem\nso what do i mean by that so it's like\nif a dude so if i'm married for example\nand i play dota for like four hours a\nday at night\nstuff still gets done\nmy kids will be put to get bed my kids\nwill be fed\nthey'll wake up the next day they'll\nhave clean clothes like stuff just gets\ndone\nbut the reason it gets done is because\nit's the default responsibility of women\nto take care of all that crap who does\npta meetings\nright who who makes pediatrician\nappointments and so as a man like i help\nout around the house right so we say\nhelp out which also like one person is\ndoing the helping and one person holds\nthe default responsibility you guys get\nthat it's even in the language that we\ndo\nlike we use like shows the dynamic\nso i think the hardest thing one of the\nhardest things about being a woman is\nthat the default responsibility falls to\nyou\nnow i i'm not saying that men out there\ndon't accept responsibility there are\ndefault responsibilities that men have\nas well so for example if there's a\nclogged toilet like i take care of that\nright the default like i just think in\nmy mind if there's a clogged toilet like\ni have to take care of it\nso there's a lot of default\nresponsibility that falls onto women\num\nso like here's kind of another example\nof\nso i saw this post recently\nwe're gonna just you know i don't want\nto get too much into it but\nbecause i\nso my husband is the moderator for a few\ndifferent subreddits and he genuinely\nthinks it's his job\nmy husband refuses to look for a job\neven though i think it would be good for\nhim\nand we could use the additional income\nbut he says he's got too much on his\nplate already\nthat being monitoring monitoring these\nstupid subreddits every time i bring it\nup he claims what he's doing is unpaid\nlamers labor similar to that of a\nhomemaker but he doesn't cook or clean\nor do any of that the way he used to he\njust monitors his stupid subreddits i\ndon't know what to do sometimes i want\nto leave him because i believe i may not\nbe able to reach him\nso this is where\na lot of people will react\nright and so what reactions are people\ngonna have they're gonna be like that's\na bad\ncharacterization of a man that not all\nmen are like this\nthat women do this too\ni'm married or i my girlfriend sits\naround and doesn't do anything all day\nas well\nso i want you guys to notice if your\nmind had that reaction i want you to\nnotice what just happened\nsomeone shared with you an experience\nand the first thing that your mind did\nis reject it and provide logic this is\nthe problem\nright so if you guys want to understand\nwhy misogyny exists this is the problem\nit is because when someone speaks\nyour default mode is to reject them\nthis is the reasons you're wrong this\npaints a bad light to men and all of\nthose things are logical i'm not saying\nthat it it paints men as deadbeats it\ndoes that the question is is it [ __ ]\ntrue\nare these the experiences that this\ngroup of people has experienced like is\nthis what they live through\nis it a solo experience or a shared\nexperience why do you all think that had\n78 000 upvotes\nit's because that's a shared experience\nso i'm not saying that any of the\ncriticisms or responses to that post are\ninvalid i think their chances are\nthey're all valid\nand at the same time if your mind\ndefaults to rejecting someone else's\nopinion just because you have some piece\nof information that doesn't line up with\ntheir experience that's the problem\nthat's the blind spot so start by\nlistening\nthe last thing that i want to do is\nshare with y'all a little bit of what\ni've understood\nabout what being a woman is like okay\nso generally speaking life can suck\nright\nwe just talked about you know trauma and\nschool shootings and coping and stuff\nlike that so like what do we especially\non twitch and as gamers and things like\nthat what do we do when life sucks\nwe go play video games\nhere's the here's the worst thing is\nlike\nwomen don't get to do that\nfreely\nright so when you show up in a game and\nyou use voice chat\npeople either start hitting on you or\nthey\ntroll you or start insulting you\nor tell you to go back into the kitchen\nit's like the things that you should be\ndoing\nto have fun suddenly have these random\npeople in it that are ruining your\nexperience\nthere's no escape so i saw a post like\njust the other day about\nsome woman like ordered doordash and so\nthe dude knows her address shows up and\nstarts hitting on her when he's like\ndelivering food like what the [ __ ]\nlike\nhow is that fair like have you guys ever\nbeen hit on by someone who's delivering\nfood it's not something that i even\nthink about\nlike when i get food deliveries i don't\nworry about this person like\nyou know i don't have to worry about\nfeeling self-conscious\nwhether you go to the gym whether you\nlike go to like a coffee shop like\nwhether you play a video game\nit's like there are gonna be people out\nthere that's like the vagina apocalypse\nwhere it's like all these zombies out\nthere that are like vagina vagina vagina\nand you just can't go anywhere without\nlike this [ __ ] happening to you and if\nyou want to understand what this is like\nas a man this is what i'd say imagine\nyour mom was everywhere that every\nperson you ran into was your mom every\ntime you join a video game or you're in\na voice chat lobby your mom is there and\nshe's like have you taken out the\nlaundry\ndid you do your homework imagine that no\nmatter where you go\nyour mom is there you go to the coffee\nshop you pick up a coffee your mom's\nbehind the counter and she's like hey\ndid you do the laundry\ndid you do your homework\nand then you're like ah i hate this\nyou're walking down the street you\ndecide to go work out\nyour mom walks up to you and she's like\nhey did you do the laundry\ndid you do your homework and you're like\n[ __ ] hey leave me alone then you go\nhome and you're like i'm gonna play\ngames with my friends your mom hops into\ndiscord and she's like hey\ndid you do your laundry did you do your\nhomework\nthere's no escape\nwherever you go you log on to twitch\nchat\nand someone else like says something and\nthen your mom shows up in twitch chat\nand she's like low noob did you do your\nlaundry did you do your homework\nthere's no escape\nit sucks\ni don't know like what to say besides\nthat\nit's like everywhere you go like you're\ngetting aggroed by your mom\nthat's the closest analogy like is i've\ntried to understand this because this\njust hasn't happened to me\nthe closest analogy i can think of is it\nsounds like these people are being\nhounded by their moms like that's that's\nwhat it feels like wherever you go it's\nthe same [ __ ] it's just zombies wanting\nvagina like that's all they want it's\nlike you know that's just\nand you can't escape it now to be clear\ni don't want to say that the majority of\npeople are like this because there's\nsome interesting statistical stuff going\non here so for example like when when\nwomen say all men are [ __ ] i don't\nthink all men are [ __ ] i don't think\nthe majority of men are [ __ ] i think\nwhat happens is if you're a dude who's\nan [ __ ]\nyou move around a lot more right so like\nif you have like like let's say you have\n10 women\nand five dudes\nlike if four of the dudes are decent the\nsh the [ __ ] is gonna move from\nrelationship to relationship\nand then like eventually you're gonna\nhave like\nyou know all 10 women have dated an\n[ __ ] and they ended up with like one\ndecent human being but like the sample\nsize is highly skewed by the fact that\n[ __ ] move around\nso it's not that the majority of men are\nlike this\nit's just that like you know what\nhappens is some guy who shows up on the\ndiscord server in his misogynistic there\nand is an [ __ ] gets banned from\ndiscord and then he shows up somewhere\nelse and he gets banned from the next\none he shows up somewhere else he gets\nbanned from the next one gets banned\nfrom this chat gets banned from this\nvideo game and so like the people who\nare like you know getting banned are the\nones that are moving around and exposing\nthemselves to more people so i think\nit's unfair for women to sort of assume\nthat most men or all men are like this\nand at the same time i think like as a\ndude you've got to be super careful\nbecause you don't understand really what\ntheir experience is like\nand like the next time that you are in a\nlobby\nwith a woman\nlike\nand someone is mean to them just like\njust tell\nyour mom to go [ __ ] off\nright and then that person is going to\nget mad at you too they're going to call\nyou a simp they're like oh soup it's\nlike no bro like i'm not a sim like you\ncan call me a simp if you want to it's\ncalled being a decent human being maybe\nthat's being a simp okay fine whatever\nand here's the next thing if you are\nlike nice to a woman online\ndon't friend them afterward just go on\nyour [ __ ] day\njust\nbe nice to them stand up for them call\nout [ __ ] where you see it and then don't\ntry to form a relationship\nthey don't owe you [ __ ] just that's the\nend of it the best thing you can do is\njust move on with your day there's just\nanother human being\nyou don't need to form anything you\ndon't need to emotionally support them\nyou don't need to like help them feel\nvalidated you just need to be a decent\nhuman being move on with your day\ndo you guys get that\nbecause this is what happens like\nthere's the people the the dharma chats\nright like i'mma make the world a better\nplace let me friend this person\nand help them with all of the things\nthat they need help with\ni shall force them i shall much like the\ntherapists who are pro post-traumatic\ni'm gonna fix it and in doing so you\njust make it worse\nso being a decent human being does not\nmean you need to form a relationship\nit's like you know the next time you if\nsomeone\ndrops their books\nin your class\nyou just help them and you\ngo on with your day you don't expect\nanything in return\nthat's it\nright so just to kind of summarize about\nmisogyny so we address it a little bit\ndifferently like i'm not a huge fan of\nvirtue signal signaling\nlike i just don't think it's effective\nso i think a good example of this i\ndon't think people i remember having a\nconversation about when trump won the\nelection in 2016.\nand people being really shocked that by\nthis by the [ __ ] comment right i don't\ncan that get me banned if i say that\nokay i won't say it again\nbut so you know our president i'm just\nquoting the actual former president of\nthe united states here you know made a\ncomment about grabbing women by a\nparticular body part\nand i think that like a lot of people\ncalled him out on that but i think what\npeople don't understand is that he won\nmore votes than he lost\nbut but with that comment that attacking\nthat comment and the people who\nresonated with that comment did not\nchange their mind it actually had the\nopposite effect\nso they're\ni'm not saying i'm right here but this\nis my justification or my reasoning\nwhy i try like to not just attack\nmisogyny which there are a lot of people\nout there attacking my sergeant i have\nno problem with that like by all means\nyou all do your thing i'm gonna do my\nthing\nand at the same time like i think that\nif you you know just to kind of\nsummarize like if someone is saying\nsomething to you that does not fit that\nyou think is logically incorrect\nunderstand that like your logic is not\nbetter than theirs i mean it may be but\nthat doesn't you it could be a blind\nspot right like you are not and it's\nshocking you're not the arbiter of truth\nso maybe try listening to other people\nand like listen to what they say\nand like pro tip like if you see\ntoxicity like maybe do something about\nit\npro tip be aware of your own emotions\nand recognize like what are you looking\nfor from this relationship\nand what is like this person's\nexperience just be like a normal person\nand just get on with your day\nif they want to play a game like you\nplay a game that's totally fine you\ndon't have to like talk to them\nafterward just\ngo about your business and let them go\nabout theirs\nand if you want to understand why like\nyou know being a woman is living life on\nhard mode\nyou know it starts with things like\ngenital mutilation\nmoves on to things like laundry and\nthings like this post\nand then ends up with like even the\nspaces that we as men use to chill and\nrelax\nand\ndegeneracy like they don't get to do\nlike that sucks dude it's like being\nhounded by your mom all the time\nwherever you go same [ __ ] story\nit's\ni don't know how these people are still\nsaying on any level it's insane\nyou"
