    "transcript": "all right\nso you know there's been a lot of\ninterest in our community about adhd\nrecently and um\nyou know we've been talking we gave up\nwe did a lecture on why adhd people with\nadhd wind up with addiction so easily we\nalso talked about why people with adhd\nwind up with depression so easily and\nlike what are the correlations between\nthose two things\nbut one of the key things that i tend to\ntalk to just about all of my adhd\npatients about which we haven't really\ntalked about here\nis uh\nwhy adhd exists\nso if you if you guys check out dr k's\nguide to depression and dr k's guide to\nanxiety there's sections in there about\nwhy depression and anxiety exist\nlike these are essentially illnesses\nthat are\nhyper activations of existing circuitry\nso in the case of depression we have\nthis thing called the default mode\nnetwork which gives us the capacity to\nself-reflect\nand it's when our self-reflection\ncapacity gets overblown and turned on\nstuck in the on position that we wind up\nwith depression\nso people who are depressed for example\nalways think about themselves like in a\nweird way right they're like oh the\nworld would be better off without me\nwhere it's like the world doesn't really\nyou know\nit's like\ngonna be okay if you're there or not\nthere right\nyou start to think like very very\nyou get stuck thinking about how bad you\nare like literally the thoughts in your\nmind are stuck on you and your sadness\nin anxiety for example anxiety is\nnothing but the ability to predict\ndanger in the future like that's a very\nuseful circuit to have in the brain\nright like we want the ability to\npredict problems when that circuit gets\nstuck in the on position\nwe end up sort of like always seeing\ndanger everywhere because any\nuncertainty becomes a source of\ndanger and so this is the kind of thing\nwhere like you know\nas we understand depression anxiety and\nif you really want to overcome them you\nhave to understand like why these things\nexist in our brains and where they come\nfrom to truly like understand how they\nwork and then ultimately master them\nso what i'd like to do today we've\ntalked a lot about adhd and depression\nadhd and addiction this and that yadda\nyadda procrastination whatever but we've\nnever talked about why adhd exists or\nwhat is it truly and so my hope today is\nto share with you all some information\nabout my understanding of like why\nhumans have adhd how adhd is changing\nover time and how it may not necessarily\nbe\na may not necessarily be as maladaptive\nas people think\nso the first thing to understand uh\nbefore we kind of\ndive in is that i'm going to be talking\nabout adhd\nin sort of a broad term and i just want\nto acknowledge that for example like\nif we look at the\nlevel of adhd across the population\nthat it kind of varies okay and what i\nmean by that is that there's sort of\nlike a bell curve of attention so let's\ndo this\nokay\nso if we want to understand adhd what we\nwant to do we just have to start by kind\nof acknowledging this\nso if we look at like people's attention\nso the capacity to attend to something\nsociety looks like this\nso there's like you know most people\nlike can sort of control their attention\nthis is where like most people kind of\nexist right so one standard deviation\nincludes 85 percent of the population\nif my statistics is pretty good\nbut then there are some people over here\nwho have very strong attention\nand then some people down here who have\nattention that wanders a lot\nso what we're going to talk about is why\nhuman beings have fluctuating or like a\nwide span of attention right so if we\nlook at human beings if we look at\nsomething like let's say we just look at\nheight\nas a quality\nor tendency to get anger angry\nso like we look at anger or height we\nsee essentially the same thing so most\nattributes within human populations are\ngoing to follow this kind of bell curve\nwhere like 85 percent of people are\ngoing to be here and then some people\nget super angry\nand then some people are doormats\nand that's just how human beings work\nso the question is sort of like why and\nit tends to be that you know human\nbeings\nhave variability in situations that like\nvariability is beneficial for people so\nif we look at something like anger you\nknow we don't want everyone to be\ngetting super pissed all the time we\nwant some people to be like get angry\neasily right and maybe they're going to\nbe our warriors and then we want some\npeople who are going to be like a little\nbit more passive and maybe they're going\nto be our farmers\nand so we tend to see across human\npopulations that we have\nyou know a bell curve of cognitive\nability\nand attention is no different so then\nthe question becomes like why wouldn't\nwe want everyone having like a super\nfocused attention you know why do we\nwant people that have attention that\nwanders\nand so the the short answer is like\nthere's a very interesting theory about\nhunters versus farmers\nso some people did some personality\nresearch and essentially concluded that\nthere are two types of people\nthe farmer\nis someone who like likes routine\ndoesn't get bored so like you know\nwants stability\nso the farmer will like wake up at 5am\nevery day like go out to the fields do\nthe same thing like day after day after\nday after day and they derive a lot of\npleasure or enjoyment from like things\nlike routine and stability they really\nlike they dislike being disrupted so\nthey don't want like random events to\nhappen they just want they want to be\nable to predict things and they derive a\nlot of like pleasure enjoyment and\nsatisfaction out of routine\nand then we have hunters\nso hunters are a little bit different\nthe idea of waking up and doing the same\nthing over and over and over again is\nlike very very like annoying or\nfrustrating to them they get bored\neasily\nso what they need to do is they need to\nbe like more dynamic so they like you\nknow walking through the jungle and\npaying attention to lots of different\nstimuli so they're like oh like look\nthere's like something happening over\nhere and then this looks like a animal\nfootprint and what is that that i smell\nit seems like something's going on i\nsmell something strange and then there's\nbirds circling overhead oh they're like\nvultures over there so maybe there's\nlike some kind of predator over there so\nhunters are people that integrate a lot\nof in information\nand so what we kind of see is that in\nlike old human society we sort of needed\nboth right we needed some people to go\nout and hunt and we needed some people\nto like kind of stay at home and farm\nand that the more successful societies\nwere the ones that had like both\ncognitive types okay\nso in a sense like what we see is that\nattention variation\nwithin populations\nis selected for is a positive\nso what does that mean for us\nokay\nwhat that means for us is that\nour society has been shaped over the\nlast year primarily by farmers right so\nlike if you kind of look ever since the\nindustrial revolution like we've had you\nknow this idea of like fixed time jobs\nright like\nas as things got more centralized what\nwe started to see is like okay you go to\nthe same place every day you have your\njob like even the concept of a job like\na thing that you do instead of lots of\nthings that you do\nis like a farmer-oriented society right\nbecause the farmers basically took over\nand they're like everyone's gonna have a\njob\nand this is gonna be your job and i'm\ngonna do my job and we're all gonna do\nour jobs and then like society will work\nwonderfully and then we've got our\nhunters who are like i'm bored of my job\ni want to do something else and the\nfarmers were like no\nyou have to if you want to be outside\ninstead of being indoors you can deliver\nmail become a postal worker\nand so our society since the industrial\nrevolution got heavily shaped by farmers\nand so what ended up happening is our\nsociety became more and more methodical\nmore structured where everyone is the\ncog in their you know in in the\nparticular machine that they're a part\nof and the farmers love that kind of\nthing they're like fantastic like\neveryone is a cog there's perfect order\nthere's stability and the world is is\ngoing well\nand then there's a group of people who\nare the hunters who started to struggle\nin this society so they actually started\nto like move into potentially like more\num dynamic professions right so as\nschooling got implemented\nwe started selecting for people who can\nsit in a chair from eight to three\nso now we started selecting people for\ntheir ability to sit in a chair and then\nwe added college which is like okay who\nis like farmer enough\nto not be forced into learning and kind\nof can kind of learn on their own\nso then we added something like a gpa\nright and what we did is we selected for\npeople in college who are like not\ndynamic they're people who can force\nthemselves to go to class or they don't\nhave to force themselves they like going\nto class because they're structured they\ngo to their 8 a.m class they study on\ntime they do everything on time they\ndon't procrastinate and we're going to\nreward these people so over time what\nhappened\nis society\nbecame pro-farmer\nand then we did something interesting\nokay what we did is we took the hunter\nkids\nin school\nand we said oh my god these hunter kids\nare they're not able to sit and do what\nthey're supposed to\nright\nand so then we started diagnosing them\nwith adhd so there's a couple of\ninteresting things here\nthe first is that studies have been done\nthat the student teacher ratio\ndetermines the likelihood of getting\ndiagnosed with adhd if you have one\nteacher to 30 students versus one\nteacher to 15 students adhd will be like\ntwice as likely to be diagnosed in this\ngroup than this group and that's\ncontrolling for number of kids so if i\nhave\ntwo uh let's put it this way\nyou know like if i have two classrooms\none that has\n30 kids and two teachers and one that\nhas 30 kids and one teacher like the\nnumber of adhd diagnoses in this\nclassroom is going to be way higher\nand so what we begin to see is something\nthat's interesting about a disorder\nwhich is that a disorder especially\nmental illnesses\ndisorders aren't just disorders by\nthemselves a disorder evolves when\nthere's a genetic vulnerability\nplus environmental\ncircumstance so what we see in adhd is\nthat if you literally look at the term\ndisorder there's a lack of order or\nfunction within a particular environment\nand so for people who have adhd what it\nis is their mind is dynamic\nright so that may be the genetic\nvulnerability they may be a hunter and\nwhat we're doing is we're putting them\nin a classroom\nright we're sticking them on a farm and\nso this is where the disorder the\ndisorder arises between within this gap\nand this is what adhd is now this is\nwhere we have to go back for a second to\nour\nbell curve and acknowledge that like\nfor a lot of people that i work with\nwith adhd it's about finding the right\nenvironment for them to to thrive in and\nthen their illness no longer becomes a\ndisorder it can actually become a\ndisadvantage i mean an advantage but\nthere are there are certainly people who\nhave very disordered attention to where\nlike they lit like really it is like\nfeels like a very serious like illness\nto me but i would say that the majority\nof people that i work with with adhd\neven though it is an illness or a\ndisorder or uh makes their life hard\nthat i would say like two-thirds of them\nabout 70 of them can function very well\nwith their adhd in the right\ncircumstance and in fact it's even\nadvantageous\nso there are some professions that we'll\ntalk about so event planner is actually\nsurprisingly one\nother examples are like twitch streamer\nesports athlete\nso actually a lot of professions\neven working in the emergency room\num can that or being a paramedic\nbeing a plumber\nthere are several professions that\nbizarrely enough seem to like work\ntotally fine with people with adhd\nand there are some situations where adhd\nin having a dynamic mindset because\nremember that the reason you're getting\ndiagnosed\nis because you're unable to sit in a\nclassroom for like\nseven hours a day right so like there\nare even some professions which are\nactually geared towards adhd\nand if you actually like go back and\nwatch all of the uh interviews we've\ndone with streamers what you'll find is\nthat like like a greater percentage of\nstreamers compared to the normal\npopulation have adhd just based on their\nown self-report right like so many\npeople like will say like oh yeah i have\nadhd\nand it turns out that this kind of\nhunter mentality can actually be\nadvantageous in some some situations\nso\num\njust to kind of recap i think the key\npoint here is that there are two kinds\nof people there's like farmers and\nthey're hunters\nand when you stick a hunter in a\nfarmer's society there you'll create an\nenvironmental circumstance that allows\ntheir dynamic mind to start to become\nlike a disorder or not function well\nthere's also sort of evidence to this\nwhere like when kids get individualized\nattention\nthey're able to perform better in school\nand don't get kind of evaluated or\ndiagnosed for adhd\nso there's a lot of stuff about like you\nknow just the amount of structure that\npeople can tolerate the other thing that\ntends to go on in a lot of schools is\nthat people will medicate children\nfor the purpose of obedience right so\nlike if i have if i'm a if i'm a teacher\nand i've got like 30 rowdy kids and i\nmedicate the five rowdiest of them then\nit's like easy for me to like teach my\nclass right\nand what we tend to see is like the most\ndisruptive kids get diagnosed with adhd\nbecause they can't restrain their\nattention\nso next thing that we're going to talk\nabout is like what is\nattention deficit disorder add or adhd\nand we're going to talk a little bit\nabout some myths around adhd and some\nlike tricky things about diagnosis so\nthe first thing to understand is that it\nis a disorder\nof attention\nokay so this is where a lot of people\nget tripped up so disorders of attention\nbasically the way that i think about it\nis an inability\nto control\nyour attention\nso this is\nthis\nthe lack of this understanding is why i\nthink adhd is the most over diagnosed\nand the most under diagnosed psychiatric\ndiagnosis and you may wonder how can\nsomething be over-diagnosed and\nunder-diagnosed at the same time\nthe reason that you can have that is\nbecause you get a lot of people who\ndon't have the disorder that are getting\na diagnosis\nand you are missing a lot of the people\nthat do have a diagnosis but you don't\ncatch it because of other things so here\nare a couple of common misnomers about\nadhd that people don't get\nthe first is that people with adhd can't\nfocus\nthis is actually incorrect\nso with adhd we see a disorder of\nattention so what we see with adhd is\nactually hyper focus\nplus a lack of focus\nso what is actually very common in\npeople with adhd is that they can sit\nand do one activity for four hours at a\nstretch provided it is the right\nactivity\nso what you see is a disorder of\nattention where once an adhd kid is\ndoing something it is very very hard to\nget them to change gears\nso once they almost have like an\nobsessive quality to their attention\nokay\nso this is one of the reasons that it\ngets misdiagnosed because like parents\nwill be sitting there with their kids\nand they'll be like he never pays\nattention to school but once he starts\nplaying with legos like you have to\nphysically pull him away like it is so\nhard to get his attention once they are\ndoing something that they're super into\nso this sort of disruption of focus\nor this like inability to control your\nattention can result in hyper focus and\nit's because parents or teachers or\nother people will see the hyper focus\nthey'll even see it with a particular\nsubject it's like\nmy kid can't pay attention in math but\nlike as long as it's history he can sit\nthere and read books like you can give\nhim like a history book at the age of\nseven and he'll like read it for four\nhours at a time\nso people with adhd can absolutely hyper\nfocus on particular things and in this\nsituation it can also be like\nmaladaptive because you can't change\nyour your focus you can't stop uh\nstudying history and start studying\nmathematics\nplus a lack of focus so when it comes to\nmathematics you have once again like an\ninability\nto focus\nso when i think about disordered\nattention what i really when i think\nabout adhd i think about disordered\nattention when i think about disordered\nattention it is both a combination of\nhyper focus and lack of focus okay\nso the next thing to kind of think a\nlittle bit about\nis um\nlet me just think for a second\nwhether i want to say anything about\nthis does this make sense to people\nokay\nso the next thing to talk a little bit\nabout i'm going to go over just a couple\nof other like reasons why adhd is\nmisdiagnosed\nso the first is that we just kind of\ntalked about is that\nadhd kids sometimes hyper focus\ntherefore people think oh since they're\ncapable of hyper focus\nthey uh\ndon't actually have adhd so other\nreasons are good grades\nso oftentimes what you'll have is kids\nwith adhd\nwho have high iqs plus\nadhd and what this results in is good\ngrades and just because a kid is like\nbrute force iq their way through things\nor develops compensatory mechanisms for\nstudying so like they're not actually\nable to sit in focus but they may\ndevelop all kinds of compensatory\nmechanisms like group studying\nanother example of self-medication with\ndrugs\nanother example is being a night owl\nand you may wonder what does being a\nnight owl have to do with adhd well let\nme explain to you\nso people with adhd sometimes find that\na certain amount of fatigue\nslows down their mind\nand allows them to study\nright\nand so you'll also see this this kind of\npattern will they'll do other things to\nslow their mind down either drugs or\nthey'll even play video games\nthey'll do things that kind of make them\nlike half exhausted so that their mind\nis able to like sit properly\nso we see a lot of misdiagnosis actually\nbecause kids have good grades because\nkids are smart so we miss the diagnosis\nanother reason that we've already talked\nabout is things like class size\nso this is another reason why kids are\ndiagnosed with adhd is because like you\nknow there's just too many kids in the\nclass and so normally like if you think\nabout a six-year-old like a six-year-old\nis only supposed to be able to hold\ntheir attention for a certain amount of\ntime\nbut depending on external pressures\nclass size things like that\nyou can actually get like over diagnosis\nof adhd\nthere's also remember uh another reason\nthat it's misdiagnosed is like you know\nuh how can i say this like\ndevelopment idiosyncrasies\nso remember that\nthe primary reason the regions of the\nbrain that are involved in adhd are the\nfrontal lobes\nor executive function which if you guys\nwatch either of my other lectures on\ndepression or\naddiction you'll realize this statement\nis a huge oversimplification because we\ngo over all the different regions of the\nbrain that adhd affects\nso\nexecutive dysfunction\nis kind of what we're looking at right\nand so we also have to remember that\nlike\nkids develop at different rates so not\nall seven-year-olds are gonna behave the\nsame right just like\nheight or appetite or puberty or all\nmanner of other like developmental\nmilestones\nour frontal lobes ability and our\nexecutive dysfunction or function\ndevelops at its own idiosyncratic rate\nand so some people are just like you\nknow some people start puberty early\nsome people start puberty late in the\nsame way some people's frontal lobes\ndevelop earlier some people's frontal\nlobes develop later like i see this even\nin my two kids because my older kid has\nlike a super developed frontal lobe for\nher age and my younger kid like by\ncomparison it doesn't have frontal lobe\nthat's quite as developed or not\nanywhere near and that's just like\nindividually the way they are like the\nyounger one will get there and this is\ngoing to take her some amount of time\nso there are developmental\nidiosyncrasies that will cause people to\ndiagnose kids with adhd and you may get\na label and once you get a label you're\nlike oh i have adhd even though as your\nfrontal lobe develops you may grow out\nof adhd and if you guys kind of think\nlike how is it possible to grow out of\nadhd just think about the attention span\nof a 2 year old versus 4 year old versus\n14 year old versus 40 year old right the\nattention span naturally changes over\ntime so even if you get diagnosed at the\nage of 12 with adhd you may not have\nadhd when you're 22. it doesn't\nnecessarily have to be a lifelong\ndiagnosis\nso this is another reason that people\nget misdiagnosed with adhd\nso class size or environment\nso there's another thing that oftentimes\nlike these are the ways in which adhd\ngets missed this is why it gets\nmisdiagnosed this is sort of how it gets\nmisdiagnosed\nso what i mean by that\nis that a lot of times like kids with\nadhd will be labeled with behavioral\nproblems\nokay so like you'll get a kid and\nthey'll they'll be like oh they like oh\nhere's another one actually\nso doesn't listen\nor is defiant\nokay this is really really common we\nremember that the problem with adhd is\nlike attentional control so if an adhd\nkid is playing with legos their parents\nwill say that this person doesn't listen\nand oftentimes like like you know let's\nsay you have a kid with adhd and you\ntell them go wash your hands and then\nthe kid like on the way to the bathroom\nwill get distracted by something because\nthey'll see like a toy on the floor and\nthey'll start picking it up they'll\nstart playing with the toy and the\nparents will get mad at them\nright and once they get mad at they're\nlike like you you're not listening to me\nyou never listen bad child bad child bad\nchild and so this not listening thing\ngets sometimes perceived as defiance and\nthen the punishment that they get\nthen leads to shame\nand self-esteem problems and a lack of\nagency\nso we talked about this in the\ndepression lecture as well where a lot\nof times like\nyou know kids with adhd will get\nlike\npunished or they'll have different kinds\nof experiences either social experiences\nbehavioral experiences like school\nexperiences they're perceived as not\nbeing obedient right so that's kind of\nlike the defiant thing\nso we'll get all these kids who actually\nhave adhd who are labeled as bad kids so\nthey have behavioral problems they don't\nlisten they're defiant you know they're\nargumentative\num there are all kinds of problems that\nthese kids will kind of get labeled as\nbut that's not they don't actually have\nthose problems they're not being defiant\nit's not like the kid is like walking to\nthe bathroom and is like screw my\nparents i'm gonna play something\nwhat they end up doing is they just get\ndistracted by something and then they\nlike they just get distracted by it and\nthen they get punished for it and then\nthey feel bad because they don't even\nreally realize what they did wrong right\nthey sort of connect the dots afterward\nbut in the moment their mind just like\nswitches gears and they forget\nthere's another thing they get perceived\nas forgetful\nright so oh like this person is just\nforgetful like their memory is terrible\ni've even had this\nso i one time had um a dude come into my\noffice and say like\ni think i may have dementia and the dude\nwas like in his like late 20s\nand i was like why do you think you have\ndementia i was like that's bizarre like\ni don't hear that every day they're like\nwell my memory is just terrible and i\nwas like well tell me about that and\nhe's like well my wife tells me i forget\nstuff all the time\nso we started talking about it and then\nlike the more that i realized like oh\nthis guy doesn't have a memory problem\nhe has like an attention problem so this\nis where if we remember so if we think\nabout like memories stored in our brain\nlet's say this is where memories are\nstored\nremember they have to get in they have\nto get put in somewhere and then they\nhave to get recalled\nand so if if this is missing\nor you can't recall it properly we think\noh like\nit it you know i wasn't able to recall\nit but the truth is it never got planted\nin in the first place so a good example\nof this is if someone tells me if i ask\nlike this is a classic example okay the\neasy example of understanding attention\nversus recall\nwho here meets a bunch of people at a\nparty and forgets their names right like\nit doesn't have to be a bunch of people\nit can even be one person you meet one\nperson you you're like hey my name is\nolok and they say my name is whatever\nlike it doesn't never even sinks in\nlike and you're like oh i forgot\nthat person's name\nright and it's like how can you forget\nthat person's name so quickly like\nwithin five seconds of introducing\nyourself you forget their name within\ntwo seconds of introducing yourself\nyou're like what was that person's name\nagain and then you just or they just\nintroduced themselves you've already\nforgotten the name so you don't like\nthink that you're like oh well it's\nstupid i can't just ask them like right\naway like what is your name right so why\ndoes that happen it's an intentional\nthing because when you introduce\nyourselves your attention is on your\nintroduction so you're not listening to\nthem so the name never gets implanted in\nyour brain in the first place\nright so it's never being entered in\nand so this is why people with adhd have\nlike\nthey they get perceived as forgetful\nit's not because they have any problem\nwith recall they don't have dementia\nit's just that their attention is\nwandering so the stuff never gets put in\nin the first place\nokay\nso this is like\nwhen we kind of look at the misdiagnosis\nof adhd or let's start from the top so\nlike adhd essentially is a disorder of\nattention and that attentional disorder\ncan result in hyper focus which leads to\na lot of misdiagnosis because parents\nare like oh like you know he can like do\nroblox all day long no big deal also\ngaming\nright so we'll talk about let's talk\nabout gaming in a second but\nuh it's both hyper focus plus a lack of\nfocus it tends to get misdiagnosed or\nmissed in a lot of people\ndue to their ability to get good grades\nwhich oftentimes has to do with like\ncompensatory mechanisms that they'll set\nup\num can get misdiagnosed due to things\nlike class size or environment because\nremember a psychiatric diagnosis tends\nto be a vulnerability plus an\nenvironmental factor combined\nand then um another reason that it gets\nmisdiagnosed is because people just\ndevelop at their own pace\nso it's like you can't expect all\nseven-year-olds to be able to sit in the\nclassroom at the same\nlevel right some kids are going to\nreally love it some kids it's going to\nbe hard and then like people will sort\nof grow out of it\nso oftentimes kids with adhd get\nmisdiagnosed with things like behavioral\nproblems problems like oh they don't\nlisten they get punished for defiance or\nlack of obedience um for being forgetful\noh my kid is like they're just\ncompletely forgetful like i can't rely\non them for you know to remember\nanything and it's not an issue of recall\nit's an issue of attention\nso let's talk about gaming for a second\nin adhd\nwhy do kids with adhd love gaming it's\nbecause games demand your attention\nokay\nso like this is the cool thing about a\nvideo game right like it doesn't ever\nkind of get boring it just like and and\npeople with adhd will self select for\nparticular video games that um will\ndemand their attention in the right way\nso the game is constantly giving you\nstimuli\nright so it's like oh like there's a\nrandom encounter here if i'm playing\nlike fortnite or a battle royale like\nnow there's someone over here or like i\ncan queue up for a game of league and\nthere's always like some kind of thing\nthat is like triggering and pulling in\nyour attention\nand so this is also where people will\nget misdiagnosed because parents will be\nlike i don't understand why my kid can't\nstudy he can sit there and literally\nplay on you know on a computer for like\n12 hours like without stopping for food\nand that is once again because it is\ndisordered attention\nright so they can hyper focus\nso video games are are very very\naddictive to people with adhd because\nthey allow your mind to be fully focused\nand it's sort of like a never ending\nlike ability to get focused and this is\nwhere we can almost take a quick\nspiritual detour\nand we can acknowledge that if you look\nat like old texts on yoga and meditation\nthey say that focus\nequals bliss\nthat the happy mind is not an anxious\nmind or a distracted mind but a focused\nmind so if you do something like watch a\nsunset\nwhy do sunsets look so cool it's because\nthey like allow you to focus your mind\nif we look at the nature of like\num you know\nunhappiness in the mind it's usually\nlike unfocused thoughts\nso a good example of this is\nanxiety\nwhen you're thinking about one thing and\nyou're thinking about another thing and\nyou're thinking about a third thing you\nmay think that it's all the same thought\nbut if you really pay attention to\nanxiety it's actually rapidly moving\nthoughts you may be anxious about a\nparty\nbut you may think oh does that mean that\ni'm focused on the party no if you\nactually pay attention to your thoughts\nyou're not focused on the party when you\nhave anxiety about going to a party\nyou're like oh what if i'm wearing the\nwrong thing and then what if people\nthink i'm stupid and then people won't\nlike me and who am i gonna talk to am i\ngonna be standing in the corner with a\ndrink not talking to myself and\neveryone's gonna think i'm a loser and\nthen like i'm gonna walk up and try to\njoin a conversation and that's gonna\nseem super awkward because i'm just like\nwalking up and not saying anything so\nyou kind of think about like all these\n15 different things it's not one thought\nit's not like watching a sunset where\nyou're not like thinking oh like the\nsunset has this sunspot here and then\nit's got this and then it's got this and\nthen it's got this you're just absorbed\nin the experience\nso yogi sort of figured out that focus\nequals bliss and if you can be absorbed\nin one thing that will lead to a mental\nfeeling of like calmness and enjoyment\nand so this is what's so addictive about\ngaming is that gaming sort of gives us a\nsense of focus\nand so even though the game is rage\ninducing we find ourselves drawn to it\nwhy because we can be absorbed within it\nright so like a good example of this is\nlike if you if you play something like\ndark souls like while you're fighting\nthe boss you have like laser focus and\nit's after you get one-shotted that you\nthrow your controller down and smash\neverything right but it's it's the sh\nbecause when you get one shot at in dark\nsouls what happens it shatters your\nbeautiful focus\nwhen you're playing like league of\nlegends or valerant or whatever you're\nlike hyper focused and it's when your\nteammate ins down mid\nthat it shatters your focus and then you\nstart raging why because this thing gets\ntaken away from you\nokay\nso we see kind of that gaming and adhd\nare like really really great because\nthey take your disordered attention and\nallow you to hyper focus on it so easily\nand the mind just loves that from a\nspiritual perspective by spiritual\nperspective i mean this is sort of like\nthe way that the yogi's looked at things\nit's not really like scientific in the\nsense that they didn't do like you know\na randomized controlled trial on ten\nthousand humans what they did is look at\nthemselves with like ten thousand\nintensity they took an n of one and\nexplored it all the way down to the core\nokay\nso now let's talk a little bit since\nwe're on the topic of gaming so now\nlet's talk a little bit about like being\nadhd in the modern world\nokay and why is this important\nit's because if we look at our world our\nworld is changing rapidly so remember\nthat the industrial revolution\nbasically made us a society of farmers\nright where everyone is a cog in the\nwheel or cog in\nthe machine\nright we have nine to five\nall this other stuff there's this idea\nof high school\ncollege\ncareer even the word career you guys get\nthis the word career implies like one\nthing that you do for your entire life\nit's a farmer biased word you guys get\nthat it's not like\nand then the there's like the\nopposite is odd jobs\nright like and so you guys see like the\nvalue judgment difference between these\ntwo things so if you look at someone\nlike elon musk like he doesn't have a\ncareer\nhe's a dude with odd jobs\nyou all get that like bill gates had a\ncareer elon musk has odd jobs he's like\nuh i'm a i'm gonna start a company that\nsends people into space\ni'm gonna start an electric car company\ni'ma start a company that\ndrills into the ground and like\nhigh-speed rail transport like on\ncalifornia\nright so like this is where if we look\nat the industrial revolution and the\nconsequence of the industrial revolution\nwhat we see is that like there's such a\nheavy bias\nabout what is successful and what is\ngood versus what is bad and it's very\nvery farmer focused it's very\nanti-hunter\nokay\nbut now like the world is changing so\nlike i'll just give you guys a couple of\nexamples okay so like what tends to\nhappen is\nover time our attention can transform so\nwe can you know make our attention more\nfarmer-like\nor we can go over here and make it\nmore hunter-like\nso\nstudies that have been done which\nbasically show that like\nshort content makes people more adhd so\nthere are studies that show that like so\npeople will sometimes ask me okay is it\nokay if my kid like uses a screen\nand they're like what do you think about\nscreen time dr k and that's where like i\nknow it sounds kind of weird but not all\nscreen time is the same like there's no\nsuch thing i mean there is something is\nscreen time\nbut how you use the screen\nmakes a big difference oh my god that's\njust completely a legible chat\neven that's too much for me\nso for example what i'll advise parents\nto do is long form content on a on a\nscreen is fine\nso for example a movie is okay\nbut youtube\ncompilations\nare bad\nand let's just think about this so like\nif i spend my days watching movies\nmy brain is literally going to be\nentrained\nto pay attention to something over long\nperiods of time if i watch youtube\ncompilations my attention is shifting\nlike every 60 seconds so ads are another\nthing that makes things like more\nhunter-like increases the dynamic nature\nof our mind so now let's look at a\ncouple of different things okay so like\nlet's look at a couple of categories\nlet's talk about content\nthen let's talk about uh\ndiscussion\nokay\nand then let's talk about dating\nso let's look at like how these things\nhave progressed over time\nso back in the day if i wanted content\nwhat i had to do was read a book\nright and this was like\na 30 hour\nendeavor\nand then what happened someone like\ninvented television where they're like\noh look there's a tv show and now it's\nlike a one hour endeavor\nright and then someone came along and\ninvented youtube\nand now it's like\nanywhere from five to 15 minutes\nright and then someone came along and\nwas like hey let's do this live\nand they invented twitch now you can\nwatch a stream for like eight hours at a\nstretch but like you know there's\nthere's an increase in the dynamic\nnature of twitch\nright in which which content platform is\ngrowing the most rapidly there it is\ngood job\ntick tock which is like less than 60\nseconds bro\nso what's happening is like we are\nactually selecting for shorter and\nshorter attention spans so as kids start\nwatching tick tock and if we kind of\nlook at the adhd diagnosis\nadhd has been increasing\nall along\nright over time if we go down this way\nwe'll see an increase in adhd diagnosis\nnext thing to kind of think about let's\nthink about like discussions\nfor lack of a better term so it used to\nbe like people talking\nlike let's like\nyou know the roman senate\nand then like people hanging out on\nporches right so these were like\nlong things like people would talk for\nhours\nand then what's happening is like\nthe internet comes along and then we\nhave these things called discussion\nforums which if you still go to places\nlike rpg codex you'll see like\ndiscussion forums that are like years\nold right you'll have a thread that's\nlike years old where people are still\ntalking about it\nand then over time we even get things\nlike reddit where it's like there's some\ndiscussion but the discussion like tends\nto happen like temporarily or shortly\nand then we end up with things like\ntwitch\nand twitter\nwhich is like if you blink you'll miss\nchat right\nand so we see the same thing oh no we're\nlagging gg\nwe have to move\num\nwe see things like twitch and twitter\nwhere like the the discussion rate is\nvery very rapid\nand let's even talk about dating\nokay so dating there used to be\ncourtship\nthis is like a long and drawn out\nprocess of like balls and meetings and\nthings like that\nand then after the courtship process\nlike years later centuries later we\nstarted this thing called dating\nright so people will say are you walking\nout with someone or whatever terminology\nthey used and that like dating is like a\nlittle bit more dynamic you meet a\ncouple more people you kind of do you\nknow\nit takes a couple months maybe a couple\nyears like courtship is like more\nstructured\nand then after dating you know more\nrecently i'd say in the last 20 30 years\nlike as the availability of birth\ncontrol kind of increased\nwe sort of have like a hookup culture\nright where like it's no longer just\nabout getting married like you don't\neven need to get married you can just\nlike date for the sake of dating and you\ncan like hook up just to have a good\ntime like there's no there's no value\njudgment attached to it and now we have\ntinder and in the courtship you're like\ndealing with one person\nand the dating thing let's say you're\ndealing with like three to five people\nin the hookup culture maybe you're\ndealing with like five to\n20 depending on oh god once again\nterrible handwriting\nand then like tinder it's like literally\na numbers game so it's like 99 plus\nright so we see that society is like\nmoving in this direction\nas we move in this direction we're going\nto see an increase\nin adhd like symptoms\noh my god\nchat\ndr k is on the struggle bus today\nand as we see an increase in adhd like\nsymptoms\nlike we're gonna see like more people\nfeeling like they have adhd but\nsomething interesting is also happening\nwhich is that society is moving away\nfrom the farmers\nso\nif you guys read anything by like\ncharles dickens\nright like there's like back in the day\nof like book writing\nor like tolstoy\nvery very like long attention span\nauthors and long attention span like\nconsumers of content\nand so what's happening over time is\nthat we're getting like\ngoing down this way where like as\nsociety becomes adhd the more adhd\nmindset becomes more advantageous\nso this is where like it's been my\nexperience for example with twitch\nstreamers\nthat the average twitch streamer is more\nadhd than the average like\nperson\nand what that actually does for them is\nactually gives them a competitive\nadvantage so even this kind of stuck out\nwith me we did an interview with the\ndaily dose of the internet dude\nso if you you like think about the ddo i\nguy like what he basically does is like\nuses his own attention span\nas like a judge for what the internet\nwill like or not like\nright so his attention span\nbecomes\na tool\ninstead of\na problem now remember he still exists\nin a primarily farmer society where\nthere's like bank accounts and monthly\npayments and this and that and mortgages\nand credit scores and all this stuff so\nwe're not saying that like it's\nnecessarily an advantage but i have seen\nthat like as we get more and more\ntwitter oriented our attention spans\nseem to be shorter so if you look at\npolitical discourse\nover the case over time right so it\nstarted off with like let's say the\nroman senate where people go and\nconstruct arguments\nand like we'll discuss for hours and\nhours at a time and now we've got like\ntwitter trolls\nright who will just make like bizarre\npolitical statements that no one fact\nchecks has no nuance and just incites\nemotion\nso it's almost like being adhd means\nthat you can't be a senator in ancient\nrome but having adhd in today's society\nmakes you a political pundit like it's\neasy\nright\nso this is like a good example of how\nour society is actually moving more\ntowards adhd we're sort of cultivating a\nshorter attention span but bizarrely\nactually this may serve as an advantage\nfor those of you who feel like you've\ngot adhd\nand so there are a couple of other\ntrends for example that like some\ncompanies have embraced so i don't know\nif you guys know this but like google\nfor example last time i checked or based\non the clients i've worked on does not\nhave a nine to five work culture\nthey're like we don't care when you come\nin you can work at like two in the\nmorning if you want to just needs to get\ndone on time like we don't care like\nwhen you come in and so google also sort\nof figured out that like okay we're just\ngoing to give our engineers like a\ncafeteria and a place that's open 24\nhours and they can come and work\nwherever they want to so they've sort of\nselected for the night owls and they did\nsomething really cool here because\nremember in the nine to five work\nculture like these people would not be\nable to get a job or they wouldn't be\nable to keep a job even though they're\nsuper talented and could be very good\nprogrammers and so by google sort of\nstepping away from the the farmer\nculture and moving towards like a more\nfree culture they actually allow these\npeople that may be a little bit more\nadhd maybe late risers maybe circadian\nrhythm disorder folks\nto actually be productive programmers\nanother example of this is actually work\nfrom home\nright so work from home like more and\nmore people are moving towards work from\nhome which is like you may wonder okay\nwhat does that have to do with adhd but\nit's like a less structured environment\nright so we're moving away from\nstructure towards dynamic work\nenvironments and the more that we move\nin those directions i think the more\nthat the adhd crowd will be like more\nable to like do a good job so i'll give\nyou guys just a very simple example of\nhow work from home like supports adhd so\nremember people with adhd have hyper\nfocus\nor disordered focus\nor lack of focus right and the problem\nif you've got adhd you guys may know\nthis is that like you know your typical\nday is like waiting to get inspired to\nwork panicking procrastinating and then\nevery now and then you get a four hour\nwindow\nyou get these four magical hours where\nyou do 24 hours of work\nyou guys know what i mean\nand so it's like you just like wake up\none day and you're like let's go and\nthen you just do all the work\nand then like for the rest of the week\nyou're trying to figure out why couldn't\ni do that on monday like when is that\ngonna happen again and so the work from\nhome culture allows these people to\nsucceed because if you're like an adhd\nperson you have to work from nine to\nfive like what happens if your magical\nfour hours doesn't happen in that window\nyou're screwed you're never gonna get\npromoted you're gonna get fired\nit's like gg\nso as we work from home it's sort of\nlike you just kind of work from home you\ncan be in your pajamas but if you've got\na flash of inspiration what used to\nhappen is you get a flash of inspiration\noh no gotta change out of my pajamas put\non my suit commute for an hour and by\nthe time you get to the office it's like\nyou're hungry over caffeinated and like\nit's shattered\nyour muse is gone\nand now in the work from home\nenvironment it's like if you get that\nflash of inspiration it's like you don't\neven need to put on pants you just sit\ndown and like bang out like you program\nlike a madman for four hours\nand then you can go and like get some\npizza afterward\nright\nand so like our society is actually\nmoving in an unstructured environment\nthings are getting more adhd but on the\nflip side if you have if your attention\nspan\nis more in this realm\nyou may actually find that you have some\ncompetitive advantages\nquestions\nso just to kind of summarize okay so\nlet's like do major points first of all\nadhd\nexists\nfor a reason right and this goes into\nwhy society needs farmers\nand hunters\nokay\ngenerally speaking adhd\ngets\nover\nand under\ndiagnosed\nokay so it gets misinterpreted in a lot\nof ways\nwhat is it it's a disorder\nof attention\nwhich means\nhyper focus\nplus\nlack of focus\nand this confuses a lot of people\npoint number three society\nis\nincreasing adhd\nbut on the flip side\nif you have adhd\nyou may actually have an advantage\nas long as you're careful about making\nit an advantage\nokay so this is why people are adhd if\ny'all if this kind of resonates with you\nlike now hopefully you have like a big\nhigh order sense of like why things are\nthis way\nand also like just think a lot about\nthis point especially so when i work\nwith with individuals\nwhat i'll really do is work really hard\nto try to figure out okay like what is\nyour unique\nlike advantage that you can bring to a\ndif like a particular work environment\nor your goals or whatever and what i\nfound time and time and time again is\nthat we don't need to medicate them\nto turn them into like essentially\nfarmers\nwhat it's really about and sometimes\nthey still need medication but\nwhat it's really about is creating sort\nof a life or structure\nthat allows your dynamic mind to be an\nadvantage instead of a disadvantage\nokay questions\ncan you have low attention span without\nadhd absolutely\nright so like that's what i'm saying is\nthat as a whole society is shrinking our\nattention span\nyou all get that\nbecause you don't need an attention span\nthe way that you used to like\nentertainment used to involve reading a\nbook\nso like think about this every time that\nlike 200 years ago every time someone\nread a book what they're doing is in\ntraining their attention span to be\nlonger\nand now if like if i'm just like chain\nwatching stuff like and that too you can\nyou know you can tell they're different\nkinds of content consumers there's the\nlong form podcast content consumer\nthere's the high energy twitch chat\nconsumer and there's like something in\nthe middle which is like the 25 minute\nvideo essay on youtube\nand so depending on where your attention\nspan is you may gravitate towards a\nparticular kind of content and depending\non which kind of content you watch you\nwill be in training your attention span\na particular way\nif all you watch is youtube compilations\nof memes a podcast is gonna feel super\nboring\nwhat if i watch both well that's like\nthat's totally normal right so like\nthe mind doesn't always want the same\nkind of thing so there's also a\nvariation\nin like\nhow consistently you like your content\nlike some people only like to read books\nand can't stand movies and some people\nare like i like game of thrones books\ni like game of thrones tv show and\nseason 8 is the best tv is the best\nseason of\ntelevision that has ever been created in\nthe history of humanity there's\nvariation within populations\nright\nit's truly a masterpiece\nright so now we understand like the\nadvantage this by the way\nso i love lecturing like in person\nso like i love teaching\nbut like i can't make a youtube video\nfor the life of me like i just can't sit\ndown like i've tried it a thousand times\nwhere i'm just like talking to the\ncamera i just can't do it i need some\namount of like actual energy to like\nkeep my mind going\nuh so someone's saying i thought drugs\nwere a big part of treatment for adhd\nso oftentimes\nmedicine is used for adhd so let's go\nover like basic evidence around adhd\ntreatments okay first thing to\nunderstand is that medication is as\neffective as therapy so if you go to\nlike a cognitive behavioral therapist\nwho teaches you how to focus your mind\nand like map things out and all these\nother skills you can learn skills that\nare just as effective as taking like\nadderall or methylphenidate or whatever\nit's taking\nadhd medication this is something that\nis very very poorly like understood in\nsociety is that you can get the benefit\nof medication without medication like\nthe effect sizes are the same\nsecond thing to understand is that the\nreason that people do medication is\nbecause it's easy\nright so it's like very easy especially\nif you've got a 13 year old like taking\nyour 13 year old to therapy twice a week\nso they can entrain the right kind of\nskills\nis like very expensive\nand cumbersome it's like you gotta get\nin the car\ndrive them to their appointment they\nhave an hour-long appointment as a\nparent you have to wait around\npick them up and bring them home\nso it's like a two-hour investment twice\na week\nwhich is like four hours and it's just\neasier to medicate them\nand it's like the medication works right\naway\nright the kids love it too you guys are\njust bashing on the parents like the\nkids love it they're like i take a pill\nand suddenly my mind works like everyone\nelse's that's easy i don't want to sit\nhere and map out my week for an hour\ntwice a week it's torture\ndoes that make sense\nother questions\nuh is that why adults get meds since\ntheir brains are already developed it's\nharder to train those skills no so sort\nof so the reason that\nadults get meds is because their brain\nis naturally developed maybe as much as\nit will but even then your frontal lobes\ndevelop until the age of about 30 or 32\nand i suspect that we're even delaying\nthe amount of time that it takes our\nfrontal lobes to mature so i think that\nif you do a study in 10 years about when\nthe frontal lobes mature it'll like\nthey'll mature by 35 so i think that's\nchanging so our frontal lobes are\nmaturing slowly\nthan before or there's more maturation\nto be had\nthe reason that adults get meds sure\nyou're not you just can't count on your\nfrontal lobes developing more if you're\nlike over 32\nbut they can train those skills in cbt\njust as well as kids can argue yeah so\nmost of the studies are done in adults\nso that's not the issue the issue is\nonce again if you're an adult it's just\neasier right\nuh what's the link to\nuh\nis there any link between giftedness and\nadhd that's an excellent question and\none that we're actively researching\nright now so we do a lot of different\nresearch here at hg and we're actually\nlooking into that question so we've\nnoticed that there's a lot of people in\nour community who are gifted kids\nand there are a lot of people in our\ncommunity who have adhd so is there an\noverlap it's something we're actively\ninvestigating\nhow do i confirm if i have adhd or not\nyou go get a professional evaluation so\nsomeone saying\ndr russell barkley makes the point that\nmedication for adhd is like providing a\nwheelchair to someone with a mobility\nissue i completely agree\nand let's just look at that\nstatement more closely so providing a\nwheelchair to someone with a mobility\nissue\nis like\nmore complicated than it seems so\ndepending on the mobility issue is this\nperson able to walk like if they've been\nin a car accident and they need to go to\nrehab and learn to walk again\nor are they missing their legs\ncan they learn to use prostheses so much\nlike adhd is providing a wheelchair\nsometimes you need a wheelchair and\nsometimes that person will need the\nwheelchair for the rest of their life\nbut there are populations of people that\nwe are sticking in wheelchairs and we're\nnever teaching them how to walk again\nand so that's a problem because i think\nmuch like mobility issues\nthere's a differential diagnosis for\nwhat's causing your mobility issue and\nthere are different treatment options to\nsee that to address your mobility issue\nit may be a prosthetic it may be a\nwheelchair it may be that you can walk\nwithout either\nyou just have to train it up the right\nway\nwhy do people say adhd is fake so you'd\nyou'd probably have to ask them first of\nall but i'd say it has to do with a lot\nof the misdiagnosis stuff that i talked\nabout earlier so adhd is oftentimes\nperceived\nas a different kind of problem like oh\nthis person is defiant or isn't\nlistening\nthe other reason that i think people say\nadhd is fake is because they have a\nneurotypical brain\nand so like it's easy for them they take\nit for granted that their mind is able\nto focus and they cannot imagine a world\nin which their mind just like gets\nunplugged at random times or switches\nthe channel on you right so like imagine\nthat you're watching television\nand you control what channel you're\nwatching and then like\nimagine a different scenario where like\nyour channel randomly changes\nif you've had a remote control your\nentire life it can be very hard for you\nto understand that like other people's\nchannels are just randomly changing and\nthey have no control over that\nit's such a given in their life that\nthey have some degree of attentional\ncontrol\nwhat are the downsides to meds there are\nsome downsides\nit it's very kind of individualistic so\nlike remember that prescribing\nmedication is about a balance of\nbenefits versus hindrances\nso i try to steer clear of medications\nin general like so about 30 of people in\nmy practice have medication i have no\nvalue judgment like i'm not saying that\nyou shouldn't be on medication i\nprescribe this stuff after all\nbut i think that oftentimes like i was\nsaying with the wheelchair analogy that\nmedication will sometimes be a\nsubstitute for some amount of like\ngrowth or change\nwhich sometimes people just don't have\nthe bandwidth for like i have a patient\nfor example who's got like you know two\nteenagers and they just don't have the\ntime\nto like\ndo yoga and like a juice cleanse\nright so it's like just take your ssri\nlike don't worry about it like you can\ntake care of yourself like down the road\nbut right now you have like more\nimportant things to worry about so so\nmedication is like useful because it is\neasy right\nso with adhd for example some of the\nthings that i get concerned about are is\nthe brain development but we don't\nreally know exactly how that how\nstimulants affect brain development over\ntime\num it's not clear that it's really\nharmful at all there are definitely\nconcerns for a lot of stimulant\nmedication with being underweight and\nappetite suppression so remember when\nyou take a medication it gets dissolved\nand distributed throughout your entire\nbody so medications will have effects in\nmany places besides your brain\nand so one example of like stimulant\nmedication is that it suppresses\nappetite so if you have a 13 year old\nwho is going undergoing a growth spurt\nand normally they're consuming a high\namount of calories\nand you give them like adhd medication\nsometimes they won't feel as hungry how\nwill that affect their long-term growth\nso it does appear that there are weight\nchanges that happen with adhd medication\nwhich you have to be careful about\nthat's just one example so would you\nrecommend a forcefully extended tension\nspan it depends on where you are on the\nspectrum so i'd recommend that you\nshould be in control of your attention\nspan and so if you tell your mind to do\nsomething it should listen\nso if i tell it hey it's time to stream\nforget about dota it should listen it\ncan kick and scream a little bit like\nmine did today but then it sort of gets\nin gear\nif you tell it hey it's time to study it\nshould sit and listen\nthat's what i'd recommend\nhow do you deal with an inferiority\ncomplex caused by adhd so i don't know\nif you've seen the\nthe\num adhd and depression lecture but i'd\nstart by watching that you can also\ncheck out dr k's guide to depression so\nfor those of y'all that are dealing with\ninferiority complexes\nso the guide to depression has a lot of\nstuff about some scars and like the way\nthat those complexes form which maybe we\ncan talk about today\nbut there's like more detail about how\nto digest those dissolve those etc in\nthe guide\nwe'll talk about that today though\nsome scott is excellent\nsomeone's doing their homework\nokay shall we move on\nso bro i'm dealing with every complex\nand it ain't pretty like i get that\nthat's why in the guide we talk about\nhow to deal with all of the complexes so\nthis is something that i like about\neastern psychology more so than western\npsychology so western psychology is\nreally good at like diagnosing the\ncontent of the mind so i'll say like oh\nthis person has an ethical edible\ncomplex this person has narcissistic\npersonality disorder this person you\nknow like has borderline personality\ndisorder this person is a sociopath or\npsychopath\nso they'll they're really good at like\ndescribing the content of the person's\nmind\nbut i think eastern psychology has a\nbetter handle on the process of mind so\nhow fundamentally does a complex form\nwhere do complexes come from\nand how do we get rid of them and then\nthe particulars of it are like whatever\nyou want but that's why like we kind of\ngo into detail we'll talk about this\ntoday i'll teach something about it\nbut if you guys are interested in this\nthat's why we have five of the common\nsome scars that lead to depression so\nthese are five complexes that people\nexperience that cause them to be\ndepressed one example is like i'm\nhopeless therefore like there's no point\nin doing anything it's almost almost\nthis nihilism doomer complex another\nexample is falling behind i've fallen\nbehind\ntherefore\nyou know\nlike\nit's too late\nso there are a lot of different things\nthat you can kind of examine\num so if you guys are interested in the\nnature of how complexes form like\ndefinitely check out the depression\nguide\nokay let's talk about\nuh uh\nhow do i deal with micromanaging parents\nand the consequences in my mid-20s we'll\ntalk about we'll do a holiday stream\nabout parents and micromanagement or\nsomething let me think about that\nso someone saying structure and\ndiscipline are hard need tips so this is\nwhy where i'd say\nagreed structure and discipline are hard\nbut remember that you don't necessarily\nhave to\nrely on structure and discipline right\nyou can rely on like inspiration and\nenvironment\nso what i'd say is if you guys have\ndifficulties here's like a quick\nnutshell if you have difficulties with\nstructure and discipline and that's not\nwhat you're good at just don't bother in\na weird way so all the discipline you\nneed is like set up a study group for\nexample and then like just make all the\ndiscipline you need is not to study for\neight hours because if you're studying\nby yourself\nright like you\nare going to\nyeah\nif you you're studying by yourself every\nhour you have to make a check like a\nwillpower check and if you fail your\ncheck you start playing a video game\nbut if you're studying with a group of\nfriends like you just have to make one\nwillpower check to get there and then\nthey will keep you involved\nwhen i say inspire that's where your\ncompany is very important if you're\naround a bunch of people who are like\nyou know entrepreneurs like you will\nnaturally have a more entrepreneurial\nbend if you're around a bunch of people\nwho are like game developers and like\nthere's a discord server for game\ndevelopment and you hang out on that\ndiscord instead of like a league of\nlegends discord\nyou're more likely to develop games in\none than the other right though all\ndiscord is going to cause you to play\ngames the development discord server is\ngoing to cause you to make games\nuh what effect does weed have on adhd\nnot a good one\nin essence\nall right so like like weed is like not\na very good drug\nespecially if you have a developing\nbrain like if you want to get if you\nwant to become 35\nyou have your life established and then\nyou want to like use weed and it's legal\nand stuff i'd say go for it\nso i'd say that most\nwe'll do comparison we'll answer\nquestions for like 10 more minutes then\nwe'll do comparison okay\num so like cannabis is one of these why\ndoes cannabis feel like it helps because\nit does help certain things and it\nscrews you over in other ways\nso like the reason that cannabis feels\nlike it helps is because it helps it\njust also hurts\nright so like here's the it's almost\njust like the adhd medication in the\nwheelchair analogy where let's say you\nuse cannabis for your anxiety like it\ncan help with your anxiety but then not\nonly will you potentially get rebound\nanxiety which is when and so if you use\nsubstances to regular treat anxiety and\nyou take the substance away you will\nactually worsen your anxiety so you get\nstuck in this cycle of being dependent\non the substance and that doesn't even\nhelp anymore it's like caffeine where\nyour body develops a tolerance and then\nthere's no net positive you become\ndependent on it to function\nand then it's not actually helping your\nanxiety it's just like you've developed\na tolerance\nso weed is a problem because it is very\nvery effective at making your problems\ngo away\nthe problem is that it only makes it\nmakes you feel like your problems go\naway it doesn't actually make your\nproblems go away\nit makes your problems usually worse so\nlike people who drown themselves in\nsubstances\nwell like oh like once i'm drunk like i\ncan forget all all of my cares but like\nthey're your cares for a reason right so\nyou can do that and you can delay the\nclock by 24 hours but all the problems\nare still going to be there\num and and this is where you know a lot\nof people think that so that's the basic\nproblem with weed it also tends to mess\nwith your habit formation circuitry\nso like the ability to form good habits\nis more difficult while you're using\nmarijuana so there's a common\nmisconception that weed like causes iq\nproblems i don't think it causes iq\nproblems\nwhat it does is far far more insidious\nwhich is that it causes motivational\nproblems and habit formation problems\nright that's why there's sort of this\nidea of a pothead which is like someone\nwho sits around all day and does nothing\nnow chances are there's a little bit of\na reciprocal relationship there\nthat people who who sit around and do\nnothing gravitate towards pot and pot\nmakes people want to sit around and do\nnothing so it's not all the pot\nthe other general thing that you should\nbe careful about is like if you have a\ndeveloping brain and you add substances\nto it how does that affect the\ndevelopment of your brain the short\nanswer is we don't know\nso i'd say like steer clear that stuff\nespecially if you're like a teenager or\neven your earlier early 20s\num\nso one person saying how do i deal with\nthe imposter syndrome of whether i might\nactually have adhd or i'm just normal\nand lazy especially since the waiting\nlist for formal assessment is so long\nhere so if you're stuck\nbetween trying to figure out am i lazy\nor do i have adhd really common problem\nexcellent question what do you do about\nit and this is where it's kind of\ninteresting\nbut the short answer is it sort of\ndoesn't matter right so like i know it\nsounds kind of weird but whether you\nhave a diagnostic reason for being the\nway that you are or you are lazy\nyou still have the same shared problem\nwhich is that you're unable to do things\nthat problem needs to be fixed whether\nyou have adhd or you're lazy like that's\nsort of in a weird way it's almost\nirrelevant it does become relevant\nbecause adhd may open up\nadditional ways to fix it so i'm not\nsaying it's truly irrelevant but what\ni'm saying is that the situation is what\nit is\nthe adhd is just a label that you put\nupon it right it may give you some\namount of tools may give you some amount\nof options but this is where i'd say\nthat you know if there are tools to\norganize yourself with adhd they may\nhelp you even if you're lazy\nso this is where you know your situation\nis what it is\nirrespective of what label someone will\ngive you\nand so there are things that you can do\nirrespective of what label you have\nright so what is the nature and\nexperience of your inability to work\nask yourself that question that question\nis the same whether you have adhd or\ndon't have adhd\nand then you ask yourself okay so like\nwhat is like what is it that makes it\nhard for me to work is it is it i feel\nunmotivated what does that mean\nwhat does unmotivation mean like what\ndoes that mean to feel unmotivated is it\nthat your mind is distracted is it that\nyou're afraid of the consequences is it\nthat when you start to work like you you\nautomatically compare yourself to other\npeople and you think there's no point in\nstudying because this person is going to\ndo a better job than i i am there are\nall kinds of things that can impact your\nmotivation\nand so you have to understand the nature\nof your experience you're going to get\nmore answers studying yourself\nthan you will from like getting a\nparticular label and finding external\nanswers\nand that may sound weird you're like but\nwait if i have adhd doesn't that mean\nthat there are all these solutions out\nthere\nnews flash is someone who treats people\nwith adhd they're all on the struggle\nbus anyway it certainly can help and\nthere can be transformative\nuh you know interventions that you can\ndo for adhd i'm not downplaying those\nbut i'd say like 70 of people that i\ndiagnosed with adhd still have to go\nthrough the process of like\nself-discovering and figuring out what\nworks for them and that's because adhd\nisn't homogeneous it's heterogeneous\nright so not everyone's adhd is the same\nway\nit's at the end of the day like that\npersonal exploration of what is holding\nyou back i think is worth way more than\ngetting a label that applies to a mass\nof people for whom different things may\nwork\nright because not all it's not like\nthere's one medication for adhd there's\nlike\nhalf a dozen and why is that it's\nbecause different people need different\nthings\nso even the label does not fix your\nproblems and magically make them go away\nso dr k i limited my my caffeine use to\none drink per day and now i'm having\ntrouble with motivation and focus i was\nself-medicating with it\nand i now realize it was helping me\nfunction what else can i do cut out that\nlast cup of caffeine bro\nor girl you're fatal dave so i assume\nyou're a dude but you never know\nso this is where like just cut out the\nrest of it get completely off of it\nthat's the right move either go to two\ncups a day or no cups a day\nso if you needed to so here's okay so\npeople are wondering why two or none\nso caffeine has a half-life which is the\namount of time it takes to like\nmetabolize the caffeine okay\nso when you drink a cup of coffee\nthere's a period of time where like you\nhave a high level of caffeine in which\nit probably gives you like a work debuff\ni mean sorry work buff but then over\ntime it like the buff declines and then\nyou may hit this point where it no\nlonger buffs you and then can actually\nyou can enter a period of caffeine\nwithdrawal which is a debuff\nwhich is why people sometimes need\ncaffeine twice per day right so you like\nyou get that first buff and as your\nlevel wanes you get that second\nafternoon cup of masala chai and then\nlike that carries you like through the\nrest of the day\nso you got these like two peaks so for\nsome people one cup of coffee is enough\nto where like they get a mild buff and\nthey kind of like their half-life is\nsuch that it carries them through the\nday without a problem but depending on\nyour individual metabolism if you're\nlike me and you're avata\none cup is never enough so it's either\ntwo or bust\nso that has to do with your individual\nmetabolism dr k do you think diagnosing\nadhd during drug addiction is possible\nyes i think it's possible but it's hard\nso what i would do to so the people that\ni've diagnosed with adhd who are on\ndrugs\nare the ones that i usually make a\nhistoric diagnosis so i won't send them\nfor neuropsych testing i'll ask them or\ntheir parents like what was this person\nlike as a kid\nand so you can sort of get enough from a\nhistory to see oh this person probably\nhad a has adhd even though they're on\nsubstances now and that becomes very\nvery important because oftentimes adhd\nitself being under diagnosed\ncan keep someone from ever becoming\nsober\nso there's a whole video on this we did\na lecture on adhd and addiction where we\nkind of explored how adhd is a\nvulnerability for\nfor drug use\nright so if you are impulsive because\nyou have adhd and your ability to like\nrestrain your impulses and act more\nemotionally we go through a bunch of\nneuroscience and stuff like that there\nare a lot of reasons why having\nuntreated adhd makes sobriety very\ndifficult\nand so interestingly enough sometimes\nwhat i'll have to do is prescribe people\nstimulants\nget the adhd under control even while\nthey're like abusing marijuana or\nopiates\nand then like once the adhd gets under\ncontrol then they can actually like get\ncontrol of their substance use\nso sometimes you have to do it like that\nit's tricky\nalcohol can be really bad too for adhd\nabsolutely like we said some people with\nadhd use alcohol as like a cognitive\nlike\ndepressant right so it slows your mind\ndown so that you can like focus more\neasily\nso do i have adhd myself no\ni don't think so i probably would have\ngotten diagnosed if i was a kid in\ntoday's school system\nwith adhd\nso i have a high level of vata which i\nthink is quite adhd but i don't think\nthat my function is impaired that's\npartially because of the way that i've\nstructured my environment\ni am about that so i think if i was like\nif i was if i was in school now i would\nlike there's a 50 chance i would get\ndiagnosed with adhd\nbased on like i could never study i\ncould never like if i was interested in\nsomething i could pay attention to it if\nnot and i was just like kind of smart so\nit wasn't that bad of a deal that big of\na deal\ncan adhd patients become top students at\ncompetitive universities and scientific\nfields absolutely\nabsolutely\ni've had those students as my patients\ndo indian schools diagnose adhd a lot i\ndon't know\ni don't think they they definitely don't\ngo by doshas\num it's interesting like in india like\nthe understanding of ayurveda is so like\ndivided like some people are into it and\nsome most people are not so they don't\nunderstand like most indian people don't\neven understand what dosha is\nbased on the people i've talked to\nokay\nlet's move on\nsomeone's asking about ox-carbazapine or\ntrilepto causing adhd or depression\nthat's definitely a question for your\nprovider\nthat's the kind of thing where like\nox-carpazzipine and trilaptal can\ndefinitely cause depressive kind of\nsymptoms right but like that's\ndefinitely something you should in\nconcentration problems sure\nbut that's the kind of discussion you\nshould be having with your provider\nthat's the specificity of like if you\nguys really want to do a lecture on\npharmacology we can\nbut\nyou know because trileptil is a mood\nstabilizer right so it's going to like\nslow down your action potentials and\nstuff which can have a side effect of\nbeing depressed and can lead to\nconcentration problems but i would\nexpect trileptal to cause people to have\nlike slow concentration as opposed to\nlike\nlike rapid stuff\nis it normal for a psychologist to ask\nfor blood work to be checked before they\ndiagnose you with adhd i don't know if\nit's normal or not is it smart\nabsolutely\nwhat do you look for in blood work so we\ndid we did a lecture on this\nchat\nthere are like six\nlab tests that everyone in chat should\nget\nyou guys should get evaluated for six\nconditions\nbecause one out of two human beings will\nhave one of these problems\nfifty percent of chat will have one of\nthese problems\nanemia thyroid problems sleep apnea\nuh what else\nb12 deficiency may be vitamin d\ndeficiency what was the other one anemia\nsleep apnea thyroid\nvitamin d diabetes\nthanks chad\nlab tests for gamers yes thank you tech\nteller\nyup\nvitamin d more than b\nfor us\nchatars\nyou"
