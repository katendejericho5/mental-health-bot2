    "transcript": "in high school i had no idea what\ncalories were i think senior year that's\nlike\ni was like oh everything has stats on it\nlike okay cool\nokay there we go hey man alrighty hey\nwhat's up nice to meet you nice to meet\nyou too\ncan you uh just start off by telling us\nwhat do you go by\nuh\nyou can call me john i go by john\nokay you go by john and do you want to\ntell us i imagine most people already\nknow because you were an awesome content\ncreator on twitch\nbut do you want to just tell us a little\nbit about where they can find you and\nwhat kind of stuff you do\nuh yeah i mainly stream on twitch uh\nwith the handle masayoshi\num i'm also on\nyoutube but\nam i doing like description or shout out\nand like just like talking about\ni was just so so so i i was told when i\nstarted streaming on twitch\ni was given some instructions that when\nyou have a guest\nyou should give the guests the\nopportunity to tell people where they\ncan find you and what kind of work that\nthat you do\nokay okay\nyeah what kind of streaming you do\noh yeah i mainly just shoot on twitch\nand do uh\nit i don't know how to explain it it's\nsomewhat variety gaming but i mainly get\nlike attached to one game so like that\ninitial game was league of legends\nand then\naround that i would do variety but\nnow valor ever since the valerian came\nout that's the new addiction\nand then everything kind of goes around\nthat\nkind of just been inviting around that\ngame yeah yeah so it sounds like you're\na variety gaming streamer and if people\nare addicted to riot games they should\ncheck you out yeah awesome all right\nabout right\nand um is there something in particular\nthat you want to talk about today\nuh i couldn't really pinpoint one uh\ni don't know if they go full circle i i\nwould be interested in diving into\num eating disorders um\nthe one i struggle with is\nbinge eating disorder\num\nlike that's that one i've been\nstruggling with since like maybe middle\nschool high school\ni think high school became more\nprevalent okay\num\nor even\naddictions in general\nokay sure\num so just a couple of i\njust a couple of ground rules uh you\nknow the first is that\nso first of all\num i very much appreciate and i'm also\nsurprised by your ability to just state\nthat you want to talk about eating\ndisorders\nlike i don't think many people are able\nto do that\num does that make sense like\ni really applaud you for doing that uh\nbecause i think it's something that\npeople don't talk about because there's\nso much shame around it right\num oh yeah i think\nyeah go\nuh oh well i mainly just like the idea\nof binge eating disorder like you said\nit is very\nshameful to bring up but\ni kind of also understand\num i don't know the main reason like i\nwant to do this is like they don't feel\nalone\nlike within dealing with that since a\nlot a lot of\ni think influencers don't talk about it\ni don't know i feel like i could tap out\nwith that yeah so i and that's that's\nwhat i really want to like applaud and\nappreciate because i i do think you were\ni mean hopefully we can help some people\na couple of other things that i'm just\ngonna sort of lay out just to make sure\nwe're on the same page the first is that\num you know just because you're here to\ntalk about potentially eating disorders\nit doesn't mean that you have to answer\nany question that i'm gonna ask so if i\nask any question\nyou may feel at some point pressured to\nanswer it because you kind of opened the\ndoor but you get to shut that door at\nany point are we\nyou you cool with that\nyeah\nand the other thing just to clarify\nwhich i i know we've already talked\nabout and stuff is that you know even\nthough i am a psychiatrist and i know a\nlot about eating disorders i'm not going\nto be providing you with any medical\nadvice or or anything like that we're\njust going to kind of have an open\nconversation about eating disorders yeah\nif you do\num you know you you're welcome to dm me\nafter the stream if you have specific\nmedical questions or looking for like\nguidance to find a mental health\nprovider in your area or something like\nthat you're welcome to dm me and we'll\ntry to support you to find someone if\nyou decide you need someone or want\nsomeone or if you don't already have\nsomeone so i'm just sort of saying that\nthere's kind of a boundary around\nmedical advice on stream but we're going\nto do our best not to leave you hanging\nif there are additional questions that\nyou have that are a little bit more\npersonal is that cool\nyeah it's cool i appreciate that\num so\nyeah so tell i mean tell me a little bit\nabout\nwhen you say you've had you've struggled\nwith eating disorders what does that\nmean\nuh\nuh mainly just binge eating disorder and\ni guess\nthere's a period where like i just\nforgot to eat\nfor probably like a year because they're\njust so focused on streaming initial\nstreaming\num\ni believe i dropped from a weight of\nlike\n220 to\n170 within like\neight months\nokay\nit was just pure\ni felt like i had no time to eat because\nleaving my pc meant\num\njust down time but then like i slowly\nlike try to to think of uh brainstorming\nways to\nkind of keep chat entertained or to to\nkind of entertain themselves while i\nwent to go get food and like just\noverall sustenance um by like having\nthem watch the stream have them be the\nstreamer and like look over people or\num i'll like randomly read a name and\nlike hey if someone types this you're\nbanned\nsomething like that\num\nso it got a little better but like\nit was still something i didn't\nlook back on or reflect on\nafter it happened when you say it got a\nlittle better what are you referring to\ni'm back at like uh i would like hover a\nhealthier weight\nwith or like out not healthier like\nhealthier lifestyle\nof eating\nuh but i end up just going back to binge\neating\nokay so what i'm hearing from you is\nthat\nas a consequence of like sort of needing\nto stream or not\nthat that there were\ni mean you had to stream sort of is what\ni'm getting the sense of like you\ncouldn't take a break from streaming and\nas a consequence of not being able to\ntake a break from streaming you lost\nabout 50 pounds\nover the course of a year\nyeah pretty much\nso i\ni think i i don't know that seems to me\na little bit different from a binge\neating disorder\num\nyeah no for sure i i'm not sure what to\nlabel that one yep uh\nwe'll we'll get into it but i just want\nto acknowledge and make sure we're on\nthe same page that that's not what\nyou're referring to when you mean binge\neating disorder right\nuh no because you were asking i thought\nyou were asking me like what other been\nuh what other eating disorders sure i\nknow\ni thought you answered the question\nreally\nwell and and so then tell me a little\nbit about the binge eating disorder\nwe'll call that the streamer eating\ndisorder\nokay\ni like that um\nso\nmiddle school high school comes around\nand i would say like that's like my peak\nof\ngaming addiction\nto the point where i wanted to min max\nmy eating\nand i wanted to like hork down all the\nfood i could\nduring uh lunch towards or even dinner\ntime so i could get back to cueing or i\nalso like mid-max\nfoods that i could make very fast and\neasily which ended up being\nrice we called it cheesy rice which is\npretty much just instant mac and cheese\nnow that i think about it um\nbut is it rice\nit's just rice and cheese okay and it\njust it's pretty much just like instant\nmac and cheese it feels like\num\nso you were looking not for food but you\nwere looking for fuel\nfuel pretty much yeah yeah i could just\nplay play more\num\ntime was lp so like yeah i was just like\neating oh like eating one meal at lunch\nand dinner but then after\nall of\nthe gaming and like stress that it comes\nwith like solo queuing\nfor\n12 hours\n14 hours i would just then like stress\neat at night\nand then stress eat\nuh depending on like\nbecause like doing that it led a lot to\ndoing a lot of assignments last minute\nso i would stress it while doing\nhomework or studying and then that also\nlead to just stress eating if it was\nlike a bad night of solo queue as well\nor like because like back then i'd say\nmiddle school high school i was like the\nfirst time i was getting like a lot of\njust like threatening people just like\nbeing pissed at you\nwhat does that mean\nwho's threatening that sounds scary\nor it's like\nuh league of legends solo queue um\nespecially\ni don't know about other rings but like\nit felt like high diamond everyone just\nlike was so hungry to win\nbecause it was just like it was really\nhype in like season two and season three\num\n[Music]\ni i believe\nseason three i was diamond one\nuh and yeah it was just like it just\nfelt like a lot of people were just\nstressed as well and just like taking it\non others\ni see so so but you mean like by\nthreatening people we're talking about\npeople playing league of legends not\nlike\nsome some dude who's like i'mma [ __ ] you\nup like in in high school\nno oh no no no no no no yeah and league\nand league okay i said cause i was like\ni didn't know if we're talking about\nlike a physical abuse situation or\nbullying or like you know you gotta jump\nor like what's okay sorry i just called\nlike a surfer chill like it was not that\nbad so people are mauling at you on on\nleague and it sounds\ni mean it sounds i don't mean to\ndownplay the stress that no one causes\nbut i just i was just confused for a\nsecond\nso so everyone everyone is like super\nstressed out everyone's hungry to win on\nleague and like if they don't win like\nthey're maulding and they're gonna take\nit out on you\nyeah and it was very new to me because i\ncame from like mmos and\nyeah i came from like mmorpgs and like\nrhythm games so there's like a new space\nbecause i never played cod so i'm sure\nlike everyone is used to like\nyelling at each other but i'm like\ntaking everything personally like whoa\ndude just let's calm down yeah and so\nplay the game\nand and so you would try to say that but\ni i'm hearing that it would actually\nlike kind of like the toxicity would\nsort of affect you like it would get to\nyou oh no it went into me i be i became\none with the with the rage wow\nabout that through like\nearly or like uh end of middle school\nand like early high school\num you just i don't know it's like\nyou're like engulfed\nyou're just you're you're just seeing\nred\nand then like\nyou just want to do like i feel like\nwhat you've the pain you've been\ninflicted with and also just the\nfrustrations it's so much easier just\nlike put on someone else than yourself\ndisplacing the pain and rage\nyeah but then like at the same time i'm\nlike if i can't take responsibility for\nmistakes i make in game i can't imagine\nlike what i'm gonna be like in real life\nso just kind of like\ni feel like that anchored me off of it\nor that took me off of it anchored you\noff of it or or not anchored me off\nthat anchored me i guess\nso so you're saying that that saying if\ni can't take responsibility in the game\ni won't be able to take responsibility\nin life that thought was beneficial for\nyou\nyeah okay\num\nokay\nso sounds like people are being toxic\ntowards you\non the one hand you kind of become one\nwith the rage and you see red can you\nhelp me understand what's what that\nlooks like or what that feels like or\nwhat's going on in your head when you\nbecome one with it\nyou're just pissed i i feel like uh\nany stereotype and like a\njust thinking like tv shows or movies\nlike an abusive\nlike an abusive dude just like kind of\ndeflecting and like projecting\neverything\nit's all really doing that\nand projecting what does that help me\nunderstand what does that look like how\nare you doing that\ninstead of just like\nif you're losing the game\nwhat games should you play\nbecause i'm sure like you've experienced\nit i'm just making sure sure sure if\nyou'd be experiencing it so so i i play\ni play dota\nmore so than league\num so we're mortal enemies in that way\nbut\num\nyou know but i i absolutely i mean i\nthink i think league is a great game i\nthink valerian's a great game\num\nnever played cs go\nuh it seems like arcane is way better\nthan dragon's blood\nbut i'm looking forward to watching it\noh yeah\nso i i play primarily single player rpgs\ndota\num\nyeah\nand then let me think about what else i\nplay like i like a lot of co-op\nmultiplayer games like deep rock\ngalactic\num\nthings like that but\nif that helps you it in dota imagine the\ndude\nthat is just going in is there a jungler\nnot really but if there is everyone's\nraging let's put it that way yeah\nit's not it's not supposed to be a role\nbut sometimes in games it becomes a role\ni'm just trying to think of examples\nthere's times where like\ni just randomly like throw it on bot\nlane because they're just getting dope\nbut like that's the natural state of bot\nlane which has always been like that\njungler's just getting out pathed and\nthen like i would have to point it out\nbecause i'm just like frustrated at the\nfact that he's getting out past but like\ni could have easily helped him um\nif the person was toxic back though\nthat's where like\ni would always like match that energy\nyeah if it's obvious\nif he's open this level then i'm coming\nin too like i'm going i'm going one step\nabove yeah\ni'm almost noticing some amount of like\nenergy absorption and then energy\nreflection\nadaptive\nyeah i mean it almost reminds me of like\naltimeters from fighting games where\nit's like the more damage you take like\nthey they think they're winning because\nyou're at 10 health they don't\nunderstand that you're about to\nko them from 100 to zero with your alt\ni'm about to dissect their stats and all\nthat yeah yeah you're gonna you know\nthere's there's no there's no winning\nyou and the harder they fight the more\nthey're gonna get destroyed\nthey just need to understand that\nthey're they're getting out passed or\nwhatever as a jungler\nit well yeah it was it was a weird time\nyeah pretty much though\nand and so help me understand this this\nterm stress eating why do you call it\nstress eating\nuh because i always have just like\ncoping it's like\ni am technically hungry my stomach is\nif\nit is growling it's like this pain like\ni need a okay my stomach needs to be\nfilled up\num\nand i would just eat so much\nthat i think i got to the point it was\nlike a normal to just be like so full\nto somewhat\nsome points like almost throwing up but\nlike\ni kind of got comfortable with that\nfeeling i feel like that's where the\nbinge eating sort of like was born or\nthey kind of settled\nand and so you so when you call it a\nbinge eating disorder just to clarify\nand by the way we're coming up on one of\nthe boundaries that you don't have to\nanswer i'm curious have you ever\nactually been diagnosed by a\nprofessional or this is just the way\nthat you describe it\noh no i was never diagnosed by a\nprofessional i just think the way i\nalways\nyeah like self-reflection okay\num\nso\nso and so you you would eat to the point\nlike what would you eat after like a\n12-hour league binge\nhigh school\nit was a lot of rice rice was like the\nbig i think just carbs in general\ni think i think carbs is the easiest way\nto sum it up\npasta spaghetti\num\nright like like paint me like if i\nwalked in so if you're playing league\nfor 12 hours i'm assuming that this is\nlike midnight\nyeah midnight to him so if i was a\nburglar\nhiding in your house what would i see\njohn do\ni just got a bowl of rice on my desk i'm\njust doing whatever i need to do i'm\njust like working it down\njust eating straight up rice like just\nuh just cheesy rice okay or just\nuh marinara nothing like no angel hair\njust like regular spaghetti pasta um\nafter streaming it came it turned like\nsome like mcdonald's sometimes even\npizza\nbut mainly just uh spaghetti\nokay so and how would you i know it\nsounds kind of weird but how would you\ncook it like would you like go down to\nthe kitchen and you'd like boil water\nand like make pasta and like\nand then you've got like like a a jar of\nmarinara or something and\nyeah maybe al dente\nuh yeah uh\nthat could maybe be indicator if you see\nlike a pasta sauce in the fridge\nuh but yeah\nokay so so you'll you'll and but so it\nsounds like there's actually like kind\nof a\num you know there's like actually ramen\ni forgot ramen was another one too\nand and like how many packets of ramen\nwould you eat\nthat'd be like two on a like a really\nstressful day they could be three\nokay\nand and do you have a sense of like how\nmany calories you would consume like in\nin pasta or cheesy rice\nin in high school i had no idea what\ncalories were\nuh\nit was until like i think senior year\nthat's like\ni was like oh everything has stats on it\nlike okay cool\nokay now i can like i can start studying\nthis that's cool\nokay\nall right so so yeah so remind me at the\nend to give you we're going to talk\nabout the stats of food this is\nbrilliant\nyeah um and there's a formula that i\nthink gamers should follow when trying\nto pick the stats of their food\num so\nbut do you have a sense now in\nretrospect like how many calories you\nwould eat\noh yeah uh oh\ni'm not sure because i look at old\nimages of me and i thought it was 240\nbut i've reached 220 recently\nand i definitely didn't look nearly the\nsame weight so like it i think i was\nlike 280\nin\nmaybe junior year of high school how\ntall are you john 5 10 and a half\nand do you know what your bmi is\nno\nnot nowadays\nokay\num\nand so okay so like when you say stress\neat what i'm really hearing is not\ni know it sounds kind of weird so i'm\nhearing that you're eating a large\nquantity of food\nyeah i'm not\nunderstanding the word stress so like\nsometimes when i think about binge\neating disorder and sometimes when i\nthink about stress eating\nwhat i actually sort of think about is\npre-packaged calorie dense food or i\nthink about someone like you being super\nstressed out so they go to the freezer\nand they grab like a gallon of ice cream\nand they just go to town on that\nyou know\ni've also done that too though but like\nthat's like\nthose aren't the\nthe most common ones but i've for sure\ndone that just like randomly like i have\nto eat some ice cream or something\nokay and and how often does that like\nyou know pounding twinkies or or going\nto town on the ice cream like how often\ndoes that kind of thing happen\nuh\nit happens on like\ni i think just stressful moments in\ngeneral uh\nlike during finals it'd pick up\nrecently it's like\nif i look at my schedule and i only have\nlike maybe\none to two days to do uh like have john\ntime\num\ni think that's where it becomes more\nprevalent yeah\nokay so so this is when you're truly\nstressed out\nyeah\nokay i think it's just like coping time\nin general\num okay\nso\nand and did you notice so when when\nyou're eating let's say like so it seems\nlike when you when you're talking about\nbinge eating what you're referring to is\ncheesy rice or or you know two to three\npacks of ramen that's what we're sort of\nthinking about here is that fair to say\nyeah okay\nand and i\ni know it's going to be kind of a weird\nquestion\nwere you eating to not be hungry or were\nyou eating for other reasons\nuh\ni would say both\nthere there are times where like\nthinking like six months ago i was\nso tired but then like i randomly but i\nwas also so stressed going to sleep\nand the hunger got so loud to the point\nlike i was lying in bed for like 40\nminutes and i was just hungry the whole\ntime but i had already ate dinner\num\n[Music]\ni had a good lunch i had a good dinner\nand usually that that will be just fine\nbut\nuh\ni just had had to get up and eat\nokay can you tell me about that that's\nvery helpful to hear so like what would\nyou what would be your circumstances\nlike if you can actually paint me a\npicture or tell me an actual time that\nwould be really really helpful for me so\nlike what's an actual time where you had\na decent lunch you had a decent dinner\nyou're laying in bed at night for 40\nminutes and you're feeling like super\nsuper like you got that gnawing hungry\nfeeling like what was going on can you\ndo you remember an actual instance oh\nyeah like\ni feel like even last night\ngreat um tell me about it\nuh\nnothing to throw flame here it's just\nlike i i think i got stressed about like\ncoming on to how the gaming\nit was something i tried putting off a\ncouple times because i didn't know if i\nwanted to dive into it\nsure uh\nand then i just felt stressed to the\npoint where like\ni wanted to over like i just wanted to\novercome it and i just like\nwe have like cookies in the kitchen i\ngot i grabbed like three of those\nuh that we had some salami grab a few of\nthose with a\nuh havarti\nnice um\nand then sparkling water because i'm\ntrying to like\nagain calories so i'm like okay zero\ncalories here we'll go with that\nsometimes i'm more\nuh\nwary of what i'm eating\nuh but some days just like i don't care\nso so tell me a little bit about the so\nwhat were you when you say you were\nstressed and you were trying to like\nalmost like overcome something like i\nshould come on\nbut\nif you're saying you should there's a\npart of you that doesn't want to\nright there's a part of me that's like\nuncomfortable with it but it's also a\npart of me like i want to get on my\nshell\ni also want to\nbe able to like share my experiences and\nalso just learn from it alongside of\nother people that are struggling with\nthe same issues\nyeah so i understand that you're\nmotivated to come on and we absolutely\nappreciate that i still want to kind of\ntunnel into what is your\nthat stress that you feel about coming\non today\nwhat kind of thoughts do you have in\nyour head like what does that stress\nlook like if i had a window into your\nmind what would i see\nor your body\ni guess just the unknown\ndoing things that i'm not comfortable\ndoing every day\nlike i can go on my stream every day\nbecause i just know what's going to\nhappen or like i could have like a rough\nprediction\ni had like a good ballpark what would\nhappen on my stream if i did something\nbut on someone else's platform\nuh\njust the unknown okay and kind of swan\ndiving do do you have particular fears\nlike does your mind say like oh my god\nwhat if this happens or is it just like\ni don't know what's going to happen\ni just don't know i don't know what's\ngoing to happen\nand then you start to feel hungry\nyes\nand\nhave you noticed a correlation between\nnot knowing what to expect and how\nhungry you feel\nis that common\ni haven't really looked into it\ni haven't looked into that close\nto you and so you start to feel hungry\neven though you've eaten enough food and\nif for example you are not coming on\nstream today do you think that last\nnight\nif you weren't coming on stream\ndo you think you still would have eaten\ncookies salami in havarti sounds\ndelicious by the way okay oh yeah that's\ngreat\nso uh once i don't think so and once you\nate the food how did you feel\ngreat\nhow i was like telling oh i'm good uh\nyeah i was like i felt like i was tucked\nin i had like my teddy bear went to my\nbed\nuh\nand just like put on some music and they\nkind of went to sleep\nokay\ndid you enjoy eating the food\nthere's always guilt with it i think\nthat's the thing\nthere's always going to be guilt with it\nbut yeah i i feel comfy i am like\ncomfortable at that point\nokay yeah so i know it sounds kind of\nweird\num i understand that you feel\ncomfortable\nbut do you enjoy eating the food\noh no no no it's just like all guilt i\nam like this is no this is nothing for\nnutritional it's just like pure\nemotional\nokay and what does it do for you\nemotionally\nsimmers me down\nokay\ncan i think for a second\nyeah\nalso if it helps in past editions i\nthink during the the streaming phase\nthat's where also\nuh there's like\nfor sure nicotine addiction and i think\nthat was the coping with stress\nokay\nand i think this is what and then it was\nit was born again after i quit\nit was what was born again then\nuh the eating eating came back after\nyeah i stopped smoking okay so um what\ni'm sort of hearing is that you tend to\nbounce around between addictions\noh yeah\nokay so maybe there's something have you\never thought that you have an addictive\npersonality\noh yeah\naddictive uh gaming is always there for\naddictions but everything else that\nbounces around for sure\num help me understand\nwhat what when you when i use the phrase\naddictive personality and you say oh\nyeah\nwhat is that\nwhat do you identify with there like\nwhat do you what do you think about like\nwhat is it like to have an addictive\npersonality\nany\nhobby anything i purchase anything i put\nmy time into anything that\ngives\nfeels like a\ndopamine rush anything i like\nuh even drinking\num\nall of those i have to second guess and\nlook at him like hey\nis this addictive and like do i really\nwant to dive into this\num or should i keep at arm's length so i\nknow like i can't like i can't put\nmyself in a situation to get addicted to\nlet's say like building keyboards i\ndidn't want to buy too much stuff\nto just like start hoarding\num\nall these things like okay if i don't\nbuy a soldering kit\nthere's no point of me even building\nkeywords at all whereas like i could\nrent i could rent soldering kits so i\nknow like i should go out of the way to\nget it\nuh which would then like slow me down on\ngetting keyboards and like stuff like\nthat\ni'm almost hearing that you've got like\nthis caged beast\ninside you\nand if you\nlet it free\nyou're gonna like lose comp so you set\nup like almost\nenvironmental protections to keep your\naddictions in check\nyeah uh especially uh even with alcohol\ni'd say i'm afraid of like buying too\nmuch of that\nuh or even leaving it like open because\nlike i'm like i don't know i'm afraid i\nthink in\nin the past i for sure like\ni dove into that as a coping\nbut then i just\ni felt like [ __ ] so i kind of\nuh weave off of that\nuh\nbut even to now like just to make sure\nit doesn't happen again i just i don't\nlike buying too much alcohol or leaving\ntoo much\nheartache all around\njohn i'm just beginning to notice that\nyou must be living life on high alert\nlike always have to think about\nyou know i'm just noticing that you\ncan't just like let go like you know you\ncan't be free\ni mean maybe i'm i'm reading too much\ninto it but i'm just trying to put\nmyself in your shoes for a second and\nlike to always you know some people go\nto the store and they just like buy a\nsix-pack or whatever they don't have to\nworry about\nbuying too much or buying too little\nyou know some people like on steam you\njust buy a game and you don't have to\nthink about\nyou know like am i going to lose\na year of my life in this like if i'm\npurchasing a keyboard or i want to pick\nup a hobby i don't have to think about\nwhat if this goes too far like i'm\nnoticing that there's almost always some\npart of you that\ni don't know if it's almost always but\nit feels to me like it's like\non guard\ni see it as a good map awareness i don't\nknow\nuh\nbut yeah it\nthat it does sound a lot stressful\nthinking about it\nso so i totally agree it's good map\nawareness\nright that's that's brilliant\nthe outside is a and at the same time is\nit does it keep you from relaxing\nthat's a new realization i don't know\ni've never thought about it\nas like always\nbeing tense\ni'm wondering go ahead yeah\nall right hearing the uh yeah just the\nway you said it like someone picking up\na six-pack and not having to\nsecond-guess it\nuh the only way i've reflected on it is\nlike\npeople just eating in general\nlike not having the second guess of food\ni feel like i have to second-guess it i\ndon't\ni don't know\ni lost that train of thought but yeah\ndo you ever wish you were different\nrecently no i've come to acceptance that\nthis is just\nwhat it's like or what it is it is what\nit is and i'm just kind of learning ways\nto adapt around it\nyou say recently\nyeah what about before\noh yeah i wanted it every other way\ncan you tell me about that\nit was just the\ni just wanted to be normal\nthe way i put it\nand what what did normal look like to\nyou\nuh not having to second guess like\neating\ndrinking\nmy environment uh\nchild proofing everything\naddiction proofing yeah yeah\nand do you think acceptance is a good\nthing\nfrom all the videos like i i watch a lot\nof videos for my self-education and\nit just feels like\nthe most recent one was like the monks\nuh and it was so fascinating to me\num\nuh and it just felt like acceptance\nwas the only way to\nnot move on but like\nkind of improve that style that\nlifestyle and like to grow from it\ni think except maybe it's not that black\nand white\nwhen i hear that you've accepted this it\nfeels incredibly sad to me\nwhat do you think about that\nit doesn't feel that sad to me like i\nsaid\nuh\nit does just feel like a lot of\nit doesn't feel outside of me i feel\nlike\nit always keeps me motivated to just\nself-improve\nand to kind of overcome\nthese hurdles\nor just like not even hurdles like who i\nam\novercome who you are\nuh or no that was the same thing\nuh just kind of\nlearn to\nbe neighbors with it or also just\nno okay not being neighbors with eating\nbinge eating i want that gone but\nlearn different ways to cope\nlike knitting instead of like oh my i'm\nso hungry just like start knitting like\nreally aggressively\nsome just some any way to uh calm me\ndown\nokay\ni've been looking up different ways for\nthat i i see it's it's clear to me john\nthat you\nwork really hard\nwhen it comes to this\ni'm curious how are you feeling\nemotionally right now\nuh\nbrain's like clogged with like\ni feel like i open up a new pathway um\nthe way you worded with\nuh uncaging like i'm caged something\nwithin me is a caged\num\nand\num\nthat like\nthe way my lifestyle is seems very\nstressful because i always have to\nsecond guess\nwhat i get into um\nand yeah uh those two have like very\nmuch just\nuh\nmade me feel a little more emotional but\nalso more\nrelief that i can put more definitions\nto\njohn\ndo you know what kind of emotions you're\nfeeling\noh i don't want to see\nnot sadness just\nrelief maybe\nthat like i have more definitions to\ni feel like i've been i haven't been\nfinding answers the past year it's more\nso band-aids\ni've found different size band-aids to\ncover different wounds\nuh\nand they just keep falling off but like\nnow\nnot surgery but like we're finding just\nnew definitions to\nwhat it is\nyeah i get the sense of believing that\nyou're really tired\nthat you've been working at this for a\nlong time and actually what i hear is\nacceptance this may sound kind of weird\nis almost defeat\nthat for a long time you wanted to be\ndifferent and you kind of resigned\nyourself that this is always going to be\nthe way that i am\neven i thought map awareness was\nbrilliant man because map awareness is\nsomething that's ingrained in you right\nit's an awareness it's not something you\ndo\nit's something that is almost like\nand and you've lived with this for so\nlong that you've become\naccustomed to it it is your way of life\nso even map awareness doesn't even feel\nstressful to you\nyeah\nyou know\nwhat do you think about that\nand\neven acceptance is sort of like\nwell might as well accept it because\nthat part of you that always wanted to\nbe different well you're [ __ ] there\nbecause it's never going to be different\nso might as well accept\nit and you even catch yourself with some\nof the health self-help terminology\nbecause you're like because that's how\nyou move past it but oh no the monks say\nyou're not supposed to move past it\nright i see what you're doing there\nwhere you're trying really hard to\nincorporate what they've taught you yeah\nand i think you're doing it and you're\nputting these band-aids on but there's\nstill that part of you that\nis like\nwounded\nyou're taking that bleed damage\ni've been ignited\nuh yeah it's so hard though because like\ngoing into it you're hoping it's not a\nband-aid or\nyou're diving into it as if it's not a\nband-aid and then\nyou walk in the fog of wards like oh i\nwas a [ __ ] band-aid okay i'm going to\nrip that off and try the next thing\nuh\nhow many how many\nhow much\nhow many chances to blunt plunge into\nthe fog of war do you think you have\nleft\nlike how long can you i don't know\ni'll keep frontlining i don't care uh\nit just feels like\nwhat else do i have to lose\nat the moment\nthat's about it\ni feel like i'd rather overcome this\nthan ignore it\nof course\nlet me can i think for a second how are\nyou doing by the way we you is okay\noh it's strong it's powerful i'm just\ni'm shaking it off you know okay let's\ndo a little stretching you can you can\nthink for a bit\nlet me know if you need a penis joke to\nelevate the mood\ni'll take one actually that sounds great\noh god now i gotta come up with a penis\njoke okay\nwe'll come back to the penis stroke you\ncan you can do whatever you're thinking\nabout no i'm sure i've got one somewhere\nin there you know uh\nhere's one there's a penis somewhere\ninside me i just have to find it\nyeah i'm gonna need a second\num\nso i'm gonna just\ni'm gonna switch gears in a second john\nunless you have questions but i'm gonna\nkind of leave us with just this\nsentiment\nwhat choice do i have\nokay\nright i i want to just highlight that\nbecause i it feels really important to\nme in terms of what drives you i think\nthere's\nsome amount of like\ndesperation isn't really the there's\nsome amount of inevitability\nright because you don't want to you\ndon't want to give in to it\nand yet\nevery time you you swan dive or invade\nthe fog of war\nit turns out that their team is there\ngg noob\nyou're you're making a you're making a\nmove to try to salvage the game and it's\nlike back to the fountain [ __ ]\nthanks for trying and then you respawn\nright and it's like oh let's try this\nmove and then it's like guess what\nwe're still here\ngigi moved back to the fountain\nand so there's something\nyou know there's there's something kind\nof like tiring about that right there's\nsomething\nfrustrating about\napplying band-aid after band-aid after\nband-aid and trying and trying and\ntrying and kind of like still\nsort of going back to square one\ni do think objectively it's clear you've\nmade a lot of progress i think you also\nacknowledge i imagine that you've made a\nlot of progress\nlike i think you probably have a lot to\nbe proud of or no\nuh\nthe only progress i've kind of come to\nor like been proud of identifying\nlike\nidentifying it and like catching it in\nthe moment like okay if i eat this it's\nemotionally not for nutrition and like\nokay and then like i start nomin but\nokay good that's actually huge\nso so this is the other thing john i\nwant to point out to you is like you\ncatch your words a lot\nand i i think that's really important\nbecause i think what you mean to i think\ninstinct there's a part of you that\nreally feels like\nthe only progress that i've been able to\ncome to terms with the only progress\nthat i've been able to convince myself\nis progress\nright does that make sense like i don't\nthink that that's uh it's not like it's\nnot like you're bad at english\nright\nwell\nuh\ni'm all right no no you're\ni think this is important because so\nyour neuro-linguistic circuits of the\nbrain\npick the appropriate words\nand so when we're feeling a particular\nway\nright like when we're raging at our\njungler for like not being in the right\nplace at the right time it picks the\nappropriate word that captures what we\nfeel whether it's right or wrong does\nthat make sense\nso the language we use is an insight\ninto like how we actually feel\nand what i'm hearing is\nthe kind of a thread is that you've been\nwatching all these monks for so long\nthat you're like you're trying to shape\nyour neural linguistic programming\noh okay monks is like a\nit's been like a two-week thing now like\nit's like a week wait but\nyou've been band-aiding this [ __ ] for a\nwhile\nyeah and and so i think it's that's why\ni think actually it's huge progress to\nrecognize the emotional awareness so i\nthink the next step is to recognize\nhow do you authentically feel about this\nand like\nbecause i think that's gonna be how we\nultimately you know\nsuture the wound closed and i think\nthat's maybe what you're looking for\num sutures instead of band-aids\nuh it's it's it is mostly that i would\nsay and you are right\nthere's also times where like i haven't\nreally\nsat with the thought yet\num\nand\ni am putting it one way but i also\nactually mean it a different way if that\nmakes sense okay yeah\ni'll if you say that then i'll accept\nthat and not\noverly\nanalyze what you're saying but\ni do think you are right about the\ncoming to terms and catching that yeah\nokay\nso uh john can you tell me a little bit\nabout your upbringing\num\nwithin birth or streaming\nlet's start with birth\nokay and we'll get to streaming okay\num\ni was born and raised in central\ncalifornia uh slow county\n[Music]\nwhere is central california help me\nunderstand what that means\nuh well i ever talked about norcal socal\nbut\ni'm central cali so like between\nsocal i'm like three hours away from san\nfrancisco three hours away from l.a got\nit like that area um\nand\ni went to a\nchristian school from kindergarten to\nthird grade\nand then from fourth grade to sixth\ngrade i went to a catholic school\nand then i went to a public school in\nmiddle school\nuh\nand high school is also public as well\num okay\ni have one older brother\nmy parents are still together\nuh my mom and dad and\ni\nuh my grandma was around a lot she\nactually moved in i believe\nwhen i was in\nseventh grade middle school\nthat's when she would been\nand she would always cook for me\nuh and i think that's where the ramen\ncomes in because she would always cook\nme ramen\nbut she'd always put way too much butter\nor olive oil she was italian\nuh\njust she just she was she loved olive\noil\num\ndo you remember how you how it would\nfeel in your stomach when you had ramen\nwith too much olive oil\nuh\ndense i don't know uh i didn't really i\nnever never felt stomach it was more so\nlike just mouth just like okay\nthe\njust too much feel sick\nno i i always just kind of sat with me\nokay\ni always settled and so it helped me\nunderstand john what is your ethnicity\ni'm japanese german and italian\nand what are your parents\nmy mom's japanese and my dad is german\nand italian but he recently did a dna\ntest and figured out he's like actually\n30 french so i don't know\nokay\nokay too much now\num and what was growing up like for you\nuh\num\nolder brother always had his friends\nover\nuh seven years difference\nit was open door\nuh i was very fortunate\num i was in a very fortunate house\nand\nit was two-story and the the bottom\nfloor the basement was like always\nthe cave area and all my brother and his\nfriends would always be in there playing\ngames\nand i was just being smurfed on for like\n18 years just trying to play games with\nthem but like i would just get [ __ ] on\nbut i'd always\ngrind the game that we were playing\nuntil i was just as good but then\nthey would always swap games so i would\njust kind of help with that it was just\nalways kind of that way\num\nreally fun house though\ni had a great time\num so it sounds like\nuh\nwhat was what was like school grades\num\nit was weird because since i hung out\nwith people seven years of uh with a\nseven years difference my\nsense of humor is very different from\nkids in my into my grade\nuntil around\nfourth grade\num\ni found that group of people that like\nhad the same sense of humor but it also\nturned out\nuh my best friend\nuh he would also hang out with his older\ncousin which was seven years difference\nand that my brother\nwas actually going to school with his\ncousin so it's kind of funny how that\nworked out\ngirl\nso\nuh first kindergarten to third grade was\nactually insane um i was heavily\ninspired by my mom because she skipped\nthe second grade or if she skipped the\nthird grade i was like i want to be like\nthat i got to skip a grade now\num\ni remember in the second grade i was\nactually so fast at math i qualified for\na math tournament\nand i feel like\nthat was the peak of my my school career\nbecause as soon as gaming picked up\nit went downhill\num i think even the math team i got like\nfourth place i'd even get top three\nbut it i just remember my mom being so\nlike\nmy son's a genius like let's go um\nbad gaming picked up and that's when\nschool got really hard\num\nno stimulation\nno compete it didn't feel like\ncompetition\nthere's like no drive to improve in\nschool\nuh mainly just to get by\nuh how'd you feel about that\nsomewhat acceptance like she wants me to\nbe happy but also she wants me to do\nwell because i think\nwhen you're raising a kid\nfrom her generations like if they're not\ndoing well in school they're not\nsuccessful\nbut i feel like nowadays she's more so\nacceptance with like happiness and just\nhealth\ni think she's adapted to that\nokay\ni'm wondering and this may be me reading\ntoo much into it but it sounds to me\nlike she accepted your gaming the way\nthat you're doing whatever false\nacceptance you're doing now\nmaybe because streaming ended up working\nout but yeah sort of\naccepting it accepting defeat but deep\ndown\nmaybe she came to terms with it\nyeah\nuh\ni'm not yeah maybe\nnot sure um although it does sound like\nshe's she's able to be genuinely happy\nfor you now\noh yeah she she tunes in a lot my dad\nrandomly spams my chat\nhe just he's a one one man spammer i\nhave to kind of weird camp at him for\nthat but\ni'm glad\ni'm glad they enjoy it\nwhat's it like having your parents and\nand watch what you do\nuh my parents have always been jokesters\nmainly my dad my dad's from\nuh he was a kearney growing up\nmy\ngrandpa was a foot juggler\nuh\ni have a circus family uh it was always\nit's always been jokes um\nmy my fight with my dad's is always like\nlike\ndad you did this wrong though he's like\noh yeah but you were adopted and then we\nwould walk away and then laugh at it\nare you adopted\nno oh my dad just likes to like\nmess with me okay and stuff like that or\nalways joking around so what you're\ntelling me is that you have a genetic\nadvantage at\nbeing a twitch streamer like you\nliterally have circus jeans\ni i guess so i it's entertainment to my\nfamily yeah that's it that's that's cool\nman\nand and so it seems like i mean were\nthey how would they feel when your\ngrades like how were your grades like in\nlet's say sixth grade fifth grade\nseventh grade\nit's so weird uh\nthink about it now i was in this higher\ni think it was\nfifth or sixth grade i was in like the\nhigher math\nclass\nbut i saw my best friends in the lower\nmath class i'm like this is this looks\nway more fun why would i ever want to be\nin this class i'm like\nyeah i could do geometry in sixth grade\nbut this is boring as hell this teacher\nis like so strict and the teacher and\nthey're like they're playing with like\ncars and stuff i was like i want to go\nin there\nthey're like talk they're actually\nthey're allowed to talk\nlike in my class i was not allowed to do\nanything like\nit was so boring to me and like i would\njust like\ni asked my parents like oh i went to my\nparents like this is way too hard like\nor like like the class is way too hard i\ni can't do this and then\nthey talk to the teacher and let me just\nhang out or not they didn't let me hang\nout but they let me go to the lawyer\nclass um\ndo you remember i didn't have yeah go\nahead i i just did not understand the\nimportance of\nuh the higher math class i'd say\ni feel like i should just\nfound more transparency within that with\nmy family but yeah\ni opted for fun\nand did you have a sense of how your\nparents felt about that\nthere's like oh it's too hard okay we\ncan work on that and they like\nthey just ended up working around it but\ni feel like\nas time went on my attention span got\nlower lower and lower\nuh to the point like in middle school i\nhad to start getting tutoring\nbut even when that even with that like\nmore restrictions just felt like\nyes less fun but like also\ni didn't get to\ni there's always just less want for\nschool i always wanted there's just\ni always felt like i wanted a more\ncompetitive edge to schooling like i\nwanted a ladder system really bad\nin i think eighth grade i was like\ni would rather just\nit would have brought out the best part\nof you\nyeah i just feel like\nit felt like i was doing it for nothing\num i felt like i was only doing it\nbecause\nsocial standards\nfor my family did you feel guilty at all\nand disappointing your parents\nuh yeah\nknowing that i wasn't doing one school\nwas always guilty like just getting by\nlike i think it's just season b's but\nlike then my my\nparents some semesters were like really\nkicked down like if you don't get at\nleast bees this semester like\nwe at least you see 3.0 you just can't\ndo c's to get by like it's not\nacceptable\nuh i think that's where that's when\ntutoring came in it's a little foggy in\nthe area\nbut\nit didn't feel great\num\nnot getting\nto the\neducational standards they wanted\nfelt a bit guilty but my my dad always\nseemed to understand\nand actually my mom seemed to understand\nyeah so\nkind of a weird question but\nwhat was it like to have understanding\nand parents\nthere's a weird line of a definition of\nunderstanding parents as well now i\nthink about it because there's there's a\nlot of threats to breaking my pc if i\ndidn't get off because they knew i at\nleast had some assignment to do they\ndidn't know what it was like i know\nthere's an assignment somewhere\nlike just just pull it out like get like\nget off\nbut i'm like the season just reset like\nthis is a big deal\nbig climb big lp gains um\nuh\nthere's a lot of grounding\na lot of grounding\nuh i think after the grounding and then\nlike i was able to like show hey i can\nput my grades up\nuh i got i got 3.0 here\nuh\ni guess more i guess i became a lot more\nrebellious the more restrictions\nthat came around\num\ni remember they took away my pc for\ntwo weeks\nand all i could play with was a rubik's\ncube\nuh or go outside\nbut in high school all my friends got\nexpelled due to like drugs or fighting\nso\ni didn't get to make closer friends\nuntil like maybe junior senior year of\nhigh school mm-hmm\ni did junior year that's when i started\nmaking closer friends\nuh\ndid you feel i remember when the\nrestrictions happened though\ndo you get the sense that i know it's\ngonna be so i'm going to ask you kind of\na leading question here and\nyou know feel free to say no\ni'd say there's a 20 chance that there's\nsomething to this did you feel like\nguilty for having understanding parents\nbecause or maybe not guilty but most\npeople think that having understanding\nparents is a good thing\nand leads to like positive emotions\ni'm i'm wondering if you actually had\nsome kind of unusual opposite experience\nwhere you actually felt bad in some way\nbecause your parents were so\nunderstanding\ni think i'm explaining it wrong because\ni definitely never felt like they were\nunderstanding\nthey were like definite like outbursts\nand it actually felt like gaming became\nlike an underground hidden thing like\ni think\nsophomore year\num\nsophomore year i made friends with\npeople and like\nthat's when i started making close\nfriends online uh i didn't have a lot of\nclose friends in person maybe like\nfreshman year of high school and uh\nthe only time i could ever concentrate\nor play games was actually when everyone\nwent to sleep so around 9pm that was the\nonly time i could play games\nuh\nit felt very hidden\nat that point\num\nbut then my my parents always noticed i\nwas tired\nwhat was it like hiding gaming\nuh\nthrilling i don't uh\nalways on edge like even though there\nare no distractions there's always that\nthing in the back of my head like like\nwhat was that sound like oh it's just a\ncat okay it's like a cat walking around\nlike that footstep on the staircase like\nuh\nlike the fight or flight\nthey're just like hiding the game\nhmm\ni'm maybe i'm thinking of weekends\nbecause weekdays it was actually like\ni felt like i was on\ni was always being watched\ngaming was very restricted\ni haven't like thought about it in a\nlong time so it's very it's like coming\nit coming to me in waves\nthe memories\nsounds like your parents were on guard\nyeah\nthey didn't know how to restrict gaming\nthey all they knew was like\ngaming is the issue get rid of it type\nthing\nuh\nbut it felt like i always needed to find\na way to play games i don't know if it's\nlike out of\nspite i\nremember like sneaking my ds and just\nlike\nplaying the garage\nor even like finding a uh i would like\nif i knew if i knew if my dad didn't\nneed to use his work laptop\num i would use that\ninternet restrictions happened as well\nmy dad is he works in it\nand he would always find ways to like at\non my ip my designated pcip\na password would pop up if i opened up\nany chrome extension or anything it\nwould just block up everything uh and\ni'd have to that became a game of okay\nwhat's the password\nuh\noh my god dad i lost my phone can i use\nyours to call it\nbecause i knew he texted the password to\nmy brother so he could use the internet\nbecause he has to work\noh my god like oh thank you and like i\nlike looked at the text i'm like oh your\npassword is blah blah blah and i call my\nphone like oh i found it thank you so\nmuch and then\n8pm comes around i'm back on league\nit became a game of cat and mouse\nyeah i think my mom and dad yeah\ni don't think they knew about that\nbut yeah it went to those extents\num john did anything you know anything\nhappen\nto you that you feel is like emotionally\nsignificant\nlike any kind of major things happen to\nyou like in terms of bullying or\num\nyou know anything happen around seventh\ngrade sixth grade fifth grade\nuh that sort of it may not seem\nsignificant to outside people but like\nuh\ntrust issues came around middle school\ni'd say\nhouse bullying\ni was the only asian school actually in\nelementary school i was the only asian\nschool only asian guy at school\nuntil high school and i met another\njapanese guy\nuh\nuh people like dude like the typical\nlike i'm gonna blindfold you with dental\nfloss or stuff like that\nuh i always thought there's jokes though\nbecause i came from a joking family like\ni'm like\noh i'm gonna sue you or something i\ndon't know i it was just i was a kid um\nand then or like\nit always seemed like a joking manner\nbecause i doubled down with the jokes\nthe bullying didn't go further\nyep\nso you you you became the class clown to\nprotect yourself from the from the\nbullies\nsort of\nmaybe not class clown but like you know\nactually yes though\nthere's a lot of that\nyeah\nbut i feel like i became friends with\nthe bullies because of it\nand what about uh you don't have to talk\nabout this if you don't want to i just\nwant to get a broad strokes kind of\napproach can you tell me a little bit\nabout dating john\num\ndating\n[Music]\ninteresting girl started around middle\nschool\nis always\nuh i feel like i was always the least\ninterested in the group\nuh\ni think it was like the outcast the\nminority\nbut\nthat was okay i didn't really care too\nmuch about it when um\ni had gaming to worry about anyways you\nknow you're about to say league right\ni had lp on my mind uh\nor even like i don't know when i'm\nsaying maple story i had like a mesos on\nmy mind guild wars wow like i was i was\nchilling i i didn't really work too much\nabout it uh\ni think middle school was like my first\ninstance of bullying even for my closest\nfriends they randomly outcasted me for\nlike a week\nthey threw my backpack\ni just noticed like it was i don't even\nknow how to explain i don't even know\nwhat happened i think it's just kids\nlike i think a rumor got around or\nsomething and then they just agree they\ndecided to target me they threw my\nbackpack off a staircase that's like 40\nsteps might to the point where like my\nbinder broke\nlike everything collapsed\nand that day i also happened to borrow\nmy brother's\nipod\nor zoom or something if that broke\nand that i just felt super bad about\nthat but\ni think that's like my first huge shake\non bowling i was like holy [ __ ] okay\ni'll just\ndo my own thing\num\ngirlfriends uh it's cool um\nmy first like official like real\ngirlfriend was\njunior it was a senior\num\nchad mode bro oh yeah what can i say\nuh\nwe did it for three years\nfrom junior year to\nfirst year of community college for me\nuh\nthat ended due to cheating\nunfortunately but i also\nunderstood\nuh she did\nwe\nsaved up for a korea trip\ni got her airbnb and then came back was\nlike oh\nthat happened\nbut yeah\num\nand john how old are you if you don't\nmind me asking\n24. okay\ni didn't think i was like i was i was\nlike he's gonna ask me my age i could\nnot remember if i was 23 or 24.\ni had to think about it not really\nimportant\num\nand did you finish college\nno uh i was supposed to get my aaa\num\n[Music]\nbut\ni just had no interest still it was\nstill weird uh i was just gonna like\naccept and be like\ni'm just gonna do it dad whatever\ni did my a plus plus which is like\nvery fundamental basics of i.t\num like where does ram go where uh\nmotherboard you know you know\nmotherboard it's just like stuff like\nthat\num\ni remember going to class for that uh\nbut\nwhen i was going to\nfinish wrap-up i i think i had like one\nmore full year of community that's when\nstreaming took off and i was like i was\nlike i'm going to just\nchase this now and see if i\nenjoy this\nuh and if this doesn't work out then\ni'll just go back\ntechnically\nlike full time or like when did i start\nstart like as a hobby\nstart as a hobby and when did you go\nfull time\nown 3d shut down

from hobbies\ndo you um\nare you dating anyone now\nuh yeah i'm currently dating another\nshimmer\nand broad strokes we don't need to go\ninto details but like how's that going\namazing um\nit's the most secure and\ntransparent like\nconfident i've ever felt in any\nrelationship\ni'm happy to hear that man\nyeah\num\nand john are you happy\nas a whole i\ni think so\nbut like i feel like there's no\ndefinition to happiness\ni like being busy\ni like\nwhere i'm at\ni'm\ncontent but i always want\nto\ni'm 100 happy now because i caught up\nwith everything i cleaned my room my\nroom's organized everything's feeling\ngood\neverything's back in place\ni am currently happy yes okay\nbut i'm happy to hear that okay with\nsleep\ni'm not satisfied sleep what are you\nsleeping eating\num\ni i just think i'm never gonna be\nsatisfied until like i get\na correct sleeping regiment and like\ni finally\nbeat the eating\nuh\nlike my binge eating ah\nokay\num\nany questions for me\nhow are you doing are you happy\nhow do you feel\ni'm really enjoying talking to you\ni appreciate that\num\nyeah i'm happy\ni\nyeah\ni think some things were different about\nmy life but for the most part i'm very\nhappy um\ni'm glad you're that\ni think uh yeah and and i think\nespecially in this moment i i\ni think that yeah i'm really enjoying\ntalking to you and recently we haven't\nbeen doing quite as many interviews\nand i'm really remembering\ntalking to you is making me\nreally remember why i love talking to\nother people\num so i'm i'm really happy about that\nthank you and i'm happy to hear that\nany other questions\num\nno nothing's coming to mind\nokay\nso\ni'd like to share some thoughts with you\nif that's okay\nokay\num\nlet me just think about where to start\nso\nyou know if you want to get\nevaluated for an actual eating disorder\ni think that that's totally fine i think\nit's not a bad idea\nalthough what i'm hearing is\ni think runs a little bit\nnot necessarily deeper but just\ni don't think eating disorder captures\nyou very well\num generally speaking when evaluating\nfor eating disorders there are a bunch\nof questions that clinicians would ask\nwhich i'm sort of not asking almost on\npurpose because that's really more of a\nmedical conversation\nand and i think that what i'm really\nhearing from you is\nis and what i think we can talk about\ntoday is like\nwhat is a human being's relationship\nwith food\nand i think that's a better way to kind\nof describe it because i think there's a\nlot going on here that may not be\nas simple as an eating disorder\nso part of what i don't like about the\npsychiatric system is that it tends to\nlike bucket things i think which can be\nvery helpful in some ways but can also\nbe very restrictive\nso for example if you get diagnosed with\nan eating disorder\nyou may go through eating disorder\ntreatment\nwhich is find it affecting\nan eating disorder but there is more\ngoing on i believe to your relationship\nwith food\nthat\ni think needs to be explored\nso\nif anything i'm i'm sort of like an\naddiction psychiatrist so like most of\nmy patients\nover the last few years have been like\nrelated to addictions\nand this is where if you have an\naddictive personality like\nyou can treat the eating disorder but i\ndon't know if that's going to fix\nwhatever else you get addicted to does\nthat matter\nit's just going to go to something else\nyeah so this is something i haven't gone\ntoo into too much detail but it seems\nlike you play whack-a-mole with your\naddictions\ndoes that make sense\nyeah i like that right so like it's\ngaming then it's nicotine then it's food\nthere may be other things kind of rolled\nin\nand so this is where like we have to\nhave a high level sort of understanding\nof like what role what is your\nrelationship with food\num and and so and also like what does\nfood do for you and then\nwe can start to think about\nwhat is it that you need done does that\nmake sense\nso like food does something for you and\nthat speaks to a need\nbut if you really want to get and then\nthat need gets managed by things besides\nfood so if you really want to overcome\nthis\ni think it's about understanding what\nare your core needs and also\nwhat are the structures that you've put\nin place\nthat\nadapts\nhow can i say this\nwhat are the macros that you've\nprogrammed to deal with the fact that\nyou suck at something\nright so like if i don't know how to\nlast hit like i'm going to use a macro\nand i'm going to develop a macro\nand and so it's sort of like instead of\ndealing with the core of the problem\nlike as human beings we build like\nadaptive structure\nstructures to protect us from it i see\nso yeah i think that's a good\nthat's a great point instead of uh i\nfeel like i'm avoiding the stress and\nrather\nfocusing on something\nthat's not the core issue it's if\nanything just a part of it how do you do\nthat\nso just tell me what's connecting i'm\nseeing dots connecting for you so\nvocalize those for the sake of everyone\nelse who's watching\num\nit feels like uh a root which is the\nnext addiction root is now binge eating\nto deal with the stress rather than\ndealing with the core which is the\nstress\ni feel like i need to find a way to\nrather deal with the stress rather than\ndeal with the binge eating because\nthat'll minimize the binge eating in the\nlong run\nand also maybe\nways to cope\nyeah so\nand this is where things get a little\nbit weird because\nuh okay hold on\ni just realized i was missing a question\nthat i just thought of go ahead say\nsomething here\ngo oh no i was just wondering like if\nthat does that sound about about right\nthat's what we're dealing with yep yep\nabsolutely so i just had an insight john\nwha what are you\nhas there been a time in your life where\nso what i'm hearing i'm just going to\nkind of like start the\nthe more psychological stuff so like\nbasically\nwho used to keep you in check\nparents who keeps you in check now\nuh\nmy friends\nuh\nmyself yep\nthis is you always being on guard\nright so you have started so like like\nthey used to do this for you\nand now you've learned how to do it for\nyourself\ndoes that make sense\noh yeah\nyeah that makes sense\nright so you started doing they came up\nwith a strategy\nthat keeps john from falling apart\nand that was the strategy that you\nlearned that was the meta in your\nhousehold\nwhich is don't let john go off the rails\nso they didn't teach restraint they\ntaught restriction\nand so now in your mind you don't have\nrestraint so you have to use\nrestriction\ncan't get a soldering kit can rent one\nholy\nyeah\nright because if the soldering kit is\nthere i don't know how to not use it\nso i just need to limit\nmy access to soldering which i've of all\nof the addictions i've ever heard of\nyou take the cake\nfor a brand new one\ni've never had someone come into my\noffice and say\ni'm addicted to making keyboards\nit's buying uh retail therapy i don't\nwant to buy too much\nwhatever\nyou can call it something else if you\nwant to but you're [ __ ] soldering at\nit\nand and years from now\nlike you know your your girlfriend who\nis then going to be your wife is going\nto come into a psychiatrist's office and\nis going to say\nhe was supposed to pick up the kids from\nschool\nand i found out six hours later that he\nwas in the basement soldering the whole\ntime\nit got me\nright\nso the first thing is that you\nand so this is then then you come up\nwith the band-aid\nand but the band-aid is built off of the\nback of like yours your the meta that\nyou're trying to play with your\naddictive\nimpulses\nright so like if you can't if restraint\nisn't an option and restriction is the\nonly thing now you're like looking for\nother random [ __ ] but it's like it's\nlike piled on top of like a meta that is\nformed does that make sense and i think\nthat's why it's not working like it'll\nwork a little bit but it's like\nan adaptation to an adaptation\nyeah\noh yeah\nand at some point it's just like i feel\nlike it's diluted\nor saturated\nokay yeah what do you what do you mean\nby that i i don't understand what you\nmeant but it sounds 100 correct\nuh it just feels like all the band-aid\nfixes\nthat\nthe power of each restriction feels less\nand less\nfrom this point on it feels like nothing\nwill be solving it it will only be\nminimizing\nright so this is where i think some of\nlike\nthis kind of goes back to this like i've\ncome to terms with it like acceptance is\nthe only way and that's [ __ ] sad bro\nyeah\nright like you feel that\nlike how\nterrible like it's it's not acceptance\nit's defeat\nyeah\nif you don't understand that or want to\npush back you're more than welcome to\noh no i totally agree with you on that\nyeah so it was just very hard like it\njust\neverything i like looked into it just\nfelt like it all ended up coming to\nacceptance\nbecause\nwithout the acceptance it felt like\nthere's no\nuh not happiness um\nliving a satisfying life\nyeah so so and all that stuff is right i\nthink this is the challenge though of\nlike the self-help stuff\nis that we don't really appreciate that\nwe filter that stuff through our\nexisting\nmeta\nyeah\nand so you're you're kind of like you're\nin this place where like i i know that\nyou know acceptance will help you and\nwill get you to acceptance but this is\nwhere like\nthere's there's a there's a\nsinister amount of defeatism underneath\nyour acceptance there's resignation\nthere's nothing i can do so might as\nwell accept it\nright it's not like actually empowering\nit all it's like\nsure it's a way forward but\nit's a [ __ ] way forward and and i don't\nblame you for taking it because that's\nall we know because you're a smart guy\nyou clearly you know we're a math genius\nyou've succeeded at many different video\ngames you were grinding to the point\nwhere\nyou were\nplaying against kids who were seven\nyears older than you which is ridiculous\nand then they would move games because\nlike the second you get good they can't\nlose to a kid who's like seven when\nthey're 14. so time to time to switch\ngames\nright you've risen to become successful\nas a streamer so you and you i think\nit's clear that you've done your\nhomework and you try really hard so\nyou've got good stats\nyou've got a good work ethic\nand and i think you've learned a lot i\nthink the challenge is that it's all\nbeen through this existing structure of\nlike understanding\nyour problems which i think is off which\nis why it feels like a band-aid and it\ndoesn't really work\nwith me\nyeah so now let's dig into\nwhat it is\nmy first question to you or maybe last\nquestion to you\nis has there been a time in your life\nwhere you've really gone off the rails\nand you've learned the price of going\noff the rails\nyeah uh\nit was when i at my peak weight\nuh i still don't know how much it was\nbut it was like my lowest\nself-confidence i never wanted to go out\nuh\ni could even wear pants\ni was wearing my is when i wore my dad's\nshirt i was wearing my dad's\ndouble xl\nand that was like the only shirt that\nfelt comfortable to me\nthat's when i realized\nthat was the only time i let the rails i\nwent off the rails\nhow did it feel to be that person\nuh i wasn't proud\ni felt very\nunhealthy um\neating just felt guilty\nuh but i approached\nmy parents about it and then\nuh i just learned to from there stop i\njust stopped drinking calories and like\nwent on from there\nhow did it feel to approach your parents\nit wasn't really approach it was more so\nlike a suggestion i was like hey\nwould you be open to like sugar-free\nstuff zero calorie stuff\ni don't think i ever\nfaced a head-on\nwhat are these like i've always beat\naround the bush\nthey're they're open to it because i\nfeel like we were no we were never the\nhealthiest family\num\na lot of processed foods not a lot of\nwhole foods until\nlike five years ago we did like a whole\nfood a whole foods diet together i think\nthat's when we learned a lot as a family\nand that's when i learned a lot about\ncalories\nokay\nuh why do you think you beat around the\nbush\nuh\ni just don't like bothering it i always\nfeel like i'm bothering people but\ni just want to make it more stressful\nthan it is because i want to deal with\nit i want to deal with the stress\nand i want to battle it i don't uh\nuh be a\nwithdrawal from the day\nor a deposit\nsorry\ni'm hearing that you don't want to be a\nburden\nyeah\neven if it takes a small amount i know\nbut\nyeah i i just feel like i can i should\nbe able to face it\nwhich is\nhypocritical because then i want people\nto approach me about their things\nwhich i've also understood\nbut\nyeah so\nthis\nis worth exploring deeper\num\nbut this is the thing\nso like when we talk about the root i\nfeel like this is\nit so it's going to be weird i'll\nexplain this in a second because i want\nto leave you with something a little bit\nmore concrete i feel like this is\nopening a door that we may not have time\nto open right this second\nin terms of follow-up if you want to\nwork with a therapist to explore the\nstuff more we can\num i'm wondering if i'm sort of miss\nmissing an opportunity here but i really\ndo think that\nyeah i think that this is probably a\nconversation for another day but i'm i'm\nglad you gave it this much color because\ni think there's a lot there\nyeah so there there's a lot about and so\ni think basically like the reason that\nyou're terrified to let yourself go\nis because if we think about the way you\nfeel today\nwhen we think about the way that you\nfelt wearing your dad's double xxl shirt\nthose are the polar opposites of your\nlife\nthere's like masa yoshi now\namazing girlfriend who feels secure\nprofessionally successful eating healthy\nand then there's that guy\nthere's john\nand and what i'm getting the sense of is\nthat you are terrified of becoming that\nperson again you were resigned that\nthere may be nothing you can do to\nprevent being that person again\nand that all of those thoughts and\nfeelings are things that you beat around\nthe bush with\nso you kind of keep them at arm's length\nand so like there's some questions that\ni'll ask\nwhich will start to get at that and then\nyou'll start to feel like emotions\nbecause there's something inside you\nthat you're just you're terrified of\nlike what so like if we think about why\ndoes someone have to be on guard all the\ntime\nright like why do you need map awareness\nit's because you're gonna get ganked\nyeah\nand and what is what is getting ganked\nfor you\nand so generally speaking human beings\ndon't randomly fear things\nthey learn to fear things\nso your fear of\ngoing off track comes from some\nexperience that you've had\nmaybe it's gaming\nmaybe it's going to community college\nmaybe it's not\nliving up to your mom's\nexpectations of a math genius\nand there's a lot of beating around the\nbush where it's like like even coming to\nterms with it like your mom probably on\nsome level came to terms that her son is\nnever going to be this thing that for a\nmoment\nshe was like oh my god he's going to be\nthe chosen one and the rest of your life\nyou haven't been the chosen one and i'm\nguessing that\nit has been hurtful to be able to see\nthat in her\nyou know in and this is where things can\nget super confusing because it's clear\nshe loves you it's clear she supports\nyou it's clear she's proud of you\nso how can she also be disappointed in\nyou\nit designated with me throughout school\ni was very much disappointed that i\nevery time not every time but like in\nthe back of my head every time i went on\nmy pc uh she's like\ni'm not\ni'm not that kid my mom\nuh was destined for or deserved okay not\ndessert um like no dessert\nnope yeah that's it\nright and instead she got\njohn\nyeah right and so that can hurt\nand and i i don't think that you're\nwrong when you saw\nall of the times she was a little bit\ndisappointed in you\ni think that's why if we talk about you\nknow the one feeling i've asked you\nmultiple times what you feel\nand there's really only one feeling that\nyou've been able to articulate do you\nknow what it is\nno guilt\neverything else i get a brilliant gaming\nanalogy\nso you understand what you feel you just\ndon't know how to describe it\nright so you'll use like and that's\ngreat i mean you your brain is coming up\nwith a gaming analogy to articulate like\nwhat your experience is\nso there's something going on here where\nthere's like there's some amount of like\nand here's the thing you\nyou know even if we kind of talk about\nwhy you don't want to be a burden to\npeople it's like you don't yeah you know\non a weird way like i don't think you\nreally mind too much [ __ ] yourself up\ni think it's like what you're really\nconcerned about is like not\ndisappointing other people like not\nletting other people down like the guilt\nthat you feel is not because of the way\nthat you are with yourself it's because\nof the way that\nyou don't want to inconvenience other\npeople\nyeah\nself-sabotage it's definitely that's a\nhobby of mine\nwhat do you mean like that or it just\nseems like it seems like self-sabotage\nhow so\nuh\nhaving those expectations of myself that\ni don't\num\nbe a burden to others but\nwhen people come to me it's not a burden\nat all i want people to feel comfortable\nand\nbe open enough\nyeah\nso if we kind of look at this like why\ncan't you relax\nand i think it's because\nthis is where like it all kind of starts\nto tangle together or come together\nis like the reason you can never relax\nis because you never want anyone else to\nbe responsible for keeping you in check\nso you've never got a safety valve\nyou've never got support you've never\ngot backup you can't call for a lane\nrotation you're playing league of\nlegends 1v5\nyou can't count on anyone else or you\ncan count on them you just don't want to\nbecause then you'll be a burden\nand then you're you're left like dealing\nwith all this crap on your own\nlike does your girlfriend know that you\nstruggle with eating\nuh i'm letting her know more and more\nabout it\nright so if we think about what is that\nprocess like for you i think it's a sign\nof real growth\nthat you're letting her know more and\nmore but i would guess that\nevery bit that you let her know feels\nlike\nwalking through lava\nthat you're going against every instinct\nor fiber of your being to let her\nunderstand that\nthis is something that\nyou're working on\nbecause and i would also guess that you\nfeel guilty when you tell her\ni don't like\nmentioning why there's alfredo in the\nfridge\nor like an open jar of alfredo or like i\ni\neven in this new place i've like\npurposely hid\nnot hid but like in a higher spot\nbecause\nshe's a little shorter uh but like in a\nhigher spot like so i didn't have to\nexplain it it's like it's a me thing\nyeah\nright so it's a me thing that i'm\nworking on\nand and that's hard\nand so i think this is where like i i\ndon't know exactly how this stuff comes\ntogether but as we talk about the\naddictive personality like i think by\nthe way a lot of your eating disorders i\nmean i don't know it's an eating\ndisorder is is really like gamer eating\ndisorder as opposed to like binge eating\ndisorder i haven't like formally\nevaluated you but i think there's just\nlike physiologic stuff going on\nso for example when you play league of\nlegends for 12 hours\nso this is it's it's interesting so\nthere's even a physiologic like\nbarrier here that's really important so\nif you game for eight hours you're fine\nif you game for more than eight hours\nyou're likely your tendency to binge eat\nis gonna go astronomically higher\nthere's a very simple physiologic reason\nfor this\nso our liver has this uh stuff called\nglycogen and glycogen is a carbohydrate\nstore that supplies our body with\nglucose\nover\nover like when we're living so glucose\nis really really important because it's\none of the two\num fuel sources that our brain can use\nyeah and so like we want to preserve\nglucose it's part of the reason why we\nlove eating carbohydrates because\ncarbohydrates give us glucose so we've\nevolved to be very sensitive to glucose\nnow the interesting thing about the\nglycogen stores in your liver is that\nyour body can only store about eight\nhours of glycogen at a time\nso if we don't eat for eight hours we'll\nbe fine\nand then once we cross that eight hour\nmark our body starts to go into a\ncatabolic phase where we start breaking\ndown muscle and we start entering\nliterally like the first stage of\nstarvation like that's like how it's\nphysiologically described i'm a little\nbit rusty on this so if there's you know\na dietitian or someone out there they\nmay adjust correct me but basically once\nyou cross the eight hour mark your body\nis literally starving\nso the the drive to eat changes very\ndrastically after an eight hour period\nand so yeah\nyeah so when you're\nit makes a lot of sense and so i don't i\ndon't even know necessarily that you've\na binge eating disorder i think you do\nbinge eat but i think there's a lot of\nphysiology and it's a pattern i see with\ngamers a lot which is if you play for\neight hours without eating anything then\nlike you're gonna feel like famished\nbecause your body's literally in\nstarvation and then the signals to eat\nphysiologically and like neurochemically\nstart to change after the eight-hour\nmark\ni i think during streamer\nwas it streaming eating disorder\ni think that was but\neven last night i had\nuh for lunch burrito dinner\nchicken mashed potato broccoli\ncome\nfour to six hours later because i have\nto go to bed the\nstress\nand the the scream for hunger came in\nyeah so you have that [ __ ] too so this\nis like they're there this is\nmulti-factorial\nso okay there's the physiologic thing\nthere's the cheesy rice that you had as\nan eighth grader\nright there's that thing going on and\nthere is absolutely an emotional\ncomponent to eating\nwhere there it may even be like a\nphysiologic component there too so this\nis kind of interesting but when you eat\nhigh levels of carbohydrate your insulin\nlevel goes up\ninsulin is a hormone that causes you to\nabsorb uh glucose from the blood\nand the other interesting thing is that\ninsulin is an anabolic hormone which\nmeans that it causes you to produce\nthings it's sort of like we're in\nproduction mode versus like\nuh breaking down mode there's anabolism\nand catabolism so one is like we're\nstoring energy the other was we're using\nenergy\nso when the other interesting thing is\nthat insulin makes people sleepy so when\nwe eat food and we have a insulin spike\nwe'll get into a food coma so i think\nthat you're physiologically eating\nsalami cookies and havarti\nto trigger a physiologic response\nthat slows down the thoughts in your\nhead and like literally reduces your\nstress because that's the effect of like\ninsulin on your mind is that it's gonna\nkind of like slow things down\nso there's also a physiologic element to\nyour as you put it stress eating\nand you've got the more traditional like\naddictive personality where the way that\nyou manage your emotions is through\ncertain\ndopaminergic or reinforcing activities\num so this can be nicotine it can be\nfood whatever so there's like the more\nstandard like people stress eat which\nyou occasionally do but i think there's\nactually way more going on with you\nphysiologically than you give yourself\ncredit for i don't think you're just\nlike an addict\nthere's a lot of really interesting\nphysiologic components to your story\nwhich kind of stand out to me\num\nthoughts\nquestions that was beautiful that that\neverything you just said right there was\nart that was\ni'm probably have to rewatch the vod to\nlike really let it set in but\nwell said that was\nvery intriguing\ngood i'm glad you you found that\nbeneficial so like that's the\nphysiologic component which is i think\npart of the downside to self-diagnosis\nis that there are oftentimes things\ngoing on which i don't i don't think\nyou're wrong actually about anything so\nthat's one thing so now so that's just\nto\nkeep that in mind is that if your stress\nlevel is high\nthe coping mechanism that you've learned\nis\nto eat food because\nthat's how you sort of calm yourself\ndown physiologically\nnow this is where um let me just think\nfor a second i'm gonna try to tie\ntogether a couple of other things so\nthere's like the physiologic component\nand then there's like the addictive\npersonality thing which may also be like\nsomewhat genetically determined like you\nmay have a sensitivity to dopamine have\nyou ever been evaluated for adhd\nyeah\ndo you know if you have it or i got i\ngot diagnosed with an adhd combination\nokay so that doesn't surprise me at all\nas well because i think the way that you\ndescribe your addictive personality\nis actually a neuroscientific difference\nthat exists in the brains of people with\nadhd\nso people with adhd are literally more\nsensitive to dopamine\nso\nthe ability of dopamine to swing your\nbehavior one way or the other way\nlike is variable depending on whether\nyou have adhd or not\nthat makes a lot of sense\nright so you just get\nyou swing very easily like yeah\nand and so i'm not surprised that you\nhave adhd because the the story that\nyou're describing reminds me of the\npeople that i work with who have adhd\nso there's a neuroscience component to\nyour quote-unquote addictive personality\nwhich has nothing to do with psychology\nit's not about oh like feelings and\nguilt and oh my god desperation\nrestraint and it's like it's like\nliterally like the way that your brain\nit's like an amplification of the\ndopamine signal\ncompared to the average human being\nthen so there's the physiologic\ncomponent there's the neuroscientific\nvulnerability due to adhd and then\nthere's the psychological component\nwhich i'm going to circle back to now\nsomewhere along the way\nyou know your parents sort of\ndiscovered that the way to keep john in\ncheck is like not by understanding his\nproblem because they never asked you\nright they never were like john like why\ndon't you do your homework\nlike they may have said why don't you do\nyour homework as an expression of\nfrustration yeah but they never sat you\ndown because it seems like you also have\na very beat around the bush family\ncommunication style where you guys joke\nabout things and you refer to things\nlike your parents know hey what do y'all\nthink about cutting out sugary soda your\nparents know that they're like oh my son\nlike realizes he's fat\nbut we're not gonna ever tell him that\nyeah and he's not gonna say that he's\nnot gonna say like i'm losing\nself-confidence like i'm wearing a shirt\nand i feel pathetic\nyou're gonna show up and you're gonna be\nlike and then your dad is even gonna\ncrack a joke to make you feel better\nyeah you know and so that's your thumbs\nit all up\nthat's your communication style so what\nthat sort of means is that your ability\nto like actually understand what's going\non within you\nis like sort of not developed and that's\nnot your it's not anyone's fault it's\njust like you're you're that's not how\nyou all communicated every family\ncommunication style has advantages and\ndisadvantages\nso the upside of your family's\ncommunication style for example is that\nyour family is actually very resilient\nso if people are like super authentic\nand bad [ __ ] happens it can be like too\nmuch\nso you need the joking ability like\njoking gives you like trauma resistance\nfor example\num but it it may you know it gives you\nlike\nan introspection debuff and it gives you\nlike trauma resistance\nso so and this is where there's\nsomething going on psychologically where\nyou don't want to feel like a burden you\ndon't feel good about yourself you're\nterrified of becoming a 280 pound\nwhatever\nand so those kinds of fears you don't\nreally know like how to\nmeet them head on and so you start to\nlike find random ass solutions on the\ninternet\nabout acceptance\nbut like you're not accepting the right\nthing you're not accepting what needs to\nbe accepted within yourself you're just\nlike accepting what you're accepting is\nthat you're going to be powerless and\nyou've got to restrict yourself in gg\nnoob\nright you're you're like resigning\nyourself to just like losing mmr which\nis like the wrong thing to accept which\nis why acceptance isn't working and this\nis the whole problem with like the\nacceptance movements people like accept\nbut it's like accept what\nand if you accept the wrong [ __ ]\nthing like you're not gonna get better\ndamn that's so true yeah\nso it's like i don't even know like what\nare you\nthe acceptance movement is like the\nperfect wording for it\nit like everything i do come across as\nit boils down to acceptance but but what\nare you like i'm asking not rhetorically\nnot philosophically like when you say\nlike i'm ex i'm trying to be more like\nwhat are you accepting what is it that\nyou're accepting what\nthe idea is like i'm accepting john\nlike we're\nmostly changed shaking hands as the way\nyou put it\nif there were are you accepting john\nyeah like working together you know\nlike hey i i uh\ni'm introverted and i like recharge when\ni'm alone like we're just working\ntogether\ni'm like okay we can do that we can go\nwe can go hang out and like not\nmaybe play games because i'm afraid of\nuh let's do a little bit of a dopamine\ndetox let's like just chill out for a\nbit stare look at look at the window\nlike all right yeah we could do that\nyes\nokay so that sounds actually pretty\nhealthy so i think you're actually on\nthe right track and i would say that you\nknow when you talk to your girlfriend\nthat feels to me like the right kind of\nacceptance\ndoes that make sense to you\nyeah\nshe's giving me the space to talk about\ntalk about pretty much anything it's\njust like a matter of do i have the\nstrength or\nto do it yeah the strength good so so\nhere's the reason i think that's really\ngood because\nin order to tell your girlfriend\nsomething you have to accept it first\nright you're telling her hey this is how\nit is\nyou with me and so you can't say this is\nhow it is\nyou there would be no conversations that\ninduced guilt with your girlfriend if\nyou were in denial\ndoes that make sense so like a\nprerequisite to talking to your\ngirlfriend is\nthe acceptance and when you say you're\nletting her know little bit by little\nbit\nyou're not letting her know a little bit\nby a little bit you are accepting little\nbit by little bit because every time you\ntell her you're actually owning a piece\nof it\nwow yeah\nthat makes sense\nright because like that's when you're\nlike hey this is how it is\nthat is what acceptance means\nit's like\nnow\nthe the\nokay\nquestions with me so far\nyeah yeah okay so going forward for you\njohn i think that um if you want to get\na tackle on your eating behaviors\nit's going to be an appreciation of the\nphysiology which i think you've managed\nto shortcut right because when you have\nlunch when you have dinner you're not\ngoing into that first stage of\nstarvation anymore engorging yourself on\ncheesy rice you know you were also\nsaying that even though you eat cheesy\nrice you feel almost like throwing up so\nwhy wouldn't your body stop it's because\nit's got a starvation mechanism going on\nand in starvation what your body is\ndoing is like they don't want to stop\nwhen you're full\nthey want to stop\nwhen\nthey want to go as far as we can without\nthrowing up even if you feel\nuncomfortable because come tomorrow\nthere's going to be another famine\nso what your body is doing in terms of\nhow it determines how much to eat is\nit's like there's going to be famine\ntomorrow there's going to be famine\ntomorrow there's going to be famine\ntomorrow we go 12 hours without a meal\nso we we got to pack in as much as we\ncan\nand like you're eating a [ __ ] bowl of\ncheese and rice like that's not\nthat's not binge eating psychology\nthat's like my body is starving\nright\nbut it feels weird because like i've\nalready had full meals\nprior to all to everything but this i'm\ntalking about this is like seventh grade\nyou where you wouldn't eat for 12 hours\nright\nyeah i\nor whenever you wouldn't eat for 12\nhours and would eat cheese yeah maybe\nthat's good to would stop if i would\nsnack\nor i feel like i'd drink calories but\nmaybe yeah that doesn't count as meals\nyeah that makes sense\nso yeah there's there's physiologic\nstuff if you're describing a scenario\nwhere you go past the glycogen window in\nthe liver and then you go for hours\nafter that your body is literally in the\nfirst stage of starvation and your food\ndrivers your consumption drivers are\ngoing to change drastically\nespecially if this is a pattern that\ngets repeated over and over and over\nagain because then it's almost like\nintermittent fasting where your body\nlike knows\nthat we're not gonna get food tomorrow\nso we get a better pile up today\nwow that's crazy\nso what you're perceiving is an\naddiction you call it an addiction\nbecause it's really hard to kick\nbut it's not an addiction it's a\nsurvival mechanism which is absolutely\nhard to kick because that's how your\nbody has\nevolved to survive starvation\nit's a crazy realization to come to\nterms with\nbecause like\ni thought i had identified with this\nbecause there's so many like\nsimilarities\nalmost one to one but\nthat makes so much sense because like i\ni was like this feels like a habit like\nor like i this feels like a habit rather\nthan a\ninstinct at this point\nyeah and i so just to appreciate that so\nthe first thing is as long as you\ncontinue eating healthy amounts of food\ni don't think the cheesy rice will come\nback\non the flip side there is definitely the\npsychological stuff so i think you've\njust learned how to physiologically use\nfood to calm down your mind which is\npart of the reason that people get into\nthat's why binge eating is managed by\npsychiatrists because there's\npsychological drivers right they're\nmental drivers and then of course\nthere's the coping kind of mechanism\nstuff component which we haven't really\ntalked about which is that if you eat\nfood sometimes you like dopamine and\nlike you just feel good mentally it's\nnot the physiologic insulin stuff it's\nlike the other stuff as well so i think\nyou've got kind of all of the above and\nthe short answer is that i think as long\nas you continue having conversations\nwith your girlfriend\nand you acknowledge that like restraint\nis possible\nand and i think the more that you sort\nof start to like give yourself the\nopportunity to\ngo off the rails a little bit and\nrecognize that the more that you can\ntrust people like your girlfriend to\nrotate to your lane when you're getting\nganked like if she's gonna tp to your\nlane and you can count on her\nthen there's this cosmic sense of like\nbeing on guard which will start to like\ncome down\nand then you're gonna feel amazing like\nonce you're actually able to understand\nthat there are people in this life that\ndon't have to that i can count on to\nkeep me in check\nand you're able to not feel guilty for\nrecruiting them to like keep you in\ncheck then you'll be able to relax and\nenjoy food in a way that like i'm sure\nyou do on some level already but\nand that's really what i envision for\nyou which is i understand you have a lot\nto be grateful for but like i want you\nto be able to like\nyou know not need map awareness i want\nyou to be able to count on other people\ni want you to be able to like not feel\nguilty and burdened all the time\nand i want you to like understand that\nyou don't actually like you don't have\nto accept defeat when it comes to this\nthing\nit's not like an endless slog of war\nagainst this caged beast you can\nactually let the beast out and it'll\nlike play with you and you don't have to\nworry about it going haywire\nthat makes sense\nquestions thoughts\nfascinated uh\nthat's my thought questions\ni got nothing\ni just got stuff to sit with and like or\nthink about that's\nwow yeah\nthat's powerful\ncool\num i normally ask people if they want to\nmeditate\ndo you meditate\ni've tried\nuh\ni forgot the app\ni did like guided meditation i've also\ni have watched your i've watched a lot\nof your videos in the past as well and\ni've tried your um the point on the\nforehead and just thinking about that\nuh\nthat's as far as i've gone though and so\nsome sort of breathing exercises when\nyou say you've tried\nthis could be an over interpretation on\nmy end but does that mean that it hasn't\nreally worked for you\num\nuntil like i dive a month into it it\ndoesn't feel like i've really\nexperienced it it doesn't feel like i've\ngotten the most of it or like i can't\nreally have an opinion on it\nuntil i do it for at least a month\nso give me just a second would you like\nto learn something today\nyeah i'd love to\nlet me just think about what kind of\nmeditation will be geared for what you\nneed\nokay\nare you hungry right now\nuh\nno but i usually take make a smoothie\nuh for lunch\nokay breakfast\nhave you had anything to eat since\nwaking up nope\nokay\ni was gonna make a smoothie after this\nyeah or oatmeal\num let me just think for a second okay\nso what i'd like to do john i don't this\nmay be the third meditation technique\nthat you do but i'm going to teach it a\nlittle bit prematurely\nand so\ni would definitely encourage you to like\npractice like a simple like breathing\nmeditation like alternate nostril\nbreathing or something like that for a\nmonth\num and then what i would want you to do\nis do like a more regular meditation for\nlike maybe 10 minutes and then do this\nfor like five minutes afterward so if\nyou think about a 15 minute daily\nmeditation practice\nyou should do like regular stuff\nand then but this is the practice that's\nlike actually a little bit for you\nokay\nokay so it's going to be a little bit\nmore\ninquisitive\nit's going to be a little bit more\nawareness oriented\nand what i really want this technique to\ndo remember how we were saying that like\nyour your family is like taught you or\nyou've learned how to beat around the\nbush and sort of like address things\nkind of like\ntangentially as opposed to like things\nhead-on\nand and you've also talked about you\nknow how john is meeting masayoshi\nyou're actually on this journey of like\nunderstanding who you are\nand so what i'd like to do is give you a\npractice that really tunnels that down\nand uses\neating and hunger\nto give you an authentic insight into\nlike what you are and how you work\nokay so okay i want you to sit up\nstraight i know it's kind of weird\nit's gonna be\nboth easier and harder than it sounds i\nwant you to sit up straight your back\nshould be straight\nmy back's a little or my chair the back\nof my chair's a little far back yeah\nyeah so uh do you have something you can\nsit on on top of your chair like do you\nhave a cushion or something that you can\ni grab a pillow yeah\ngaming chairs are the worst for\nmeditation\nboom\nall right okay so i'm gonna\nokay so doing like a lumbar narrower\nwe're gonna this is great we're gonna\nteach you this okay so how does that\nfeel\noh it feels great okay so now i'm gonna\nask you to do something else what i want\nyou to do is take the bottom 30 of the\npillow\nand like\nbend it\nso that you're sitting on it on your\nbutt\ni want you to oh\nokay so so like the top half of the\npillow should be\nyes very good pillow fitting yep yep yep\nall right now sit sit on yeah sit on the\npillow yeah all right\ncool now see how that feels\ni'm gonna shift it over to the right a\nbit\nwhat helps you sit up more easily\nuh\nthe other one other way okay then go\nahead and move it back to the way it was\nall right\nokay so back should be straight neck\nshould be straight as well okay\nokay i want you to close your eyes\nand i'm gonna kind of guide you through\nthis okay so this is gonna be a\nmeditation\nto help you understand\nwhat hunger is\nand the different ways in which hunger\nand the satisfaction of hunger affects\nyou\nokay so\nwe're gonna start off but i want you to\nnotice how hungry you feel\nall right and just notice like where is\nthe hunger\nright like what is the actual sensation\nlike if i was an alien\nand i was inhabiting your body\nfor\n30 seconds\nwhat would i feel so where is it what is\nthe quality of it\nis it gnawing is it sharp\nis it empty\ndo i feel it only in my stomach\nor do i also feel it in my limbs\nit feels dull\nokay\nthere's not much urge to eat it's just a\ndull hunger beautiful\nnothing to do\nexcellent you're one step\nyou're one step ahead of the game\nbecause now the next step\nis notice that this is a physical\nsensation\nbut an urge is something else\nright an urge is now a mental driver\nso there is a physical sensation\nwhich at some point will manifest\nis a mental desire\nand you may even notice that as the urge\narises that the urge is for particular\nthings\nand so what i want you to do\nis\nnotice the relationship between the\nphysical sensation of hunger\nand like\nwhy it isn't an urge yet\nand when will it cross into becoming an\nurge\nso like let's let my uh thoughts wander\nin terms of like\nwhen would i want to eat or just kind of\nsit with the hunger\nyeah so sit with the hunger and what i\nreally want you to do is notice\nso it may not be able to be done now so\nthat's why i'm saying this is like kind\nof a more advanced meditation technique\nbut i want you to watch your hunger as\nit becomes an urge and notice that like\nthe quality of it changes\nand then as you watch it become an urge\nwhat do you think it will be an urge for\nokay\nand then as you see it become an urge\nthen you can satisfy it so you can do\nthis today with your smoothie whereas\nyou have your smoothie i want you to\ndrink it how quickly do you drink it\ni'm a fast eater i know so how quickly\nuh\npb is probably like\nif i'm really in a rush i could i just\nhork it down and then just wash in the\nsink if i'm uh\nnot too much of it in a rush i just like\nsit on my desk\nso like you think you can finish it in\nthree minutes on average\nis harder to get down faster than\nhurricanes like five seconds\nyeah so i'm gonna give you like three\nminutes\nso when you have your smoothie today i\nwant you to drink it with your eyes\nclosed over a three minute time span\nyou could take longer if you feel like\nit like but minimum of three minutes\nokay\nand what i want you to do is pay\nattention to what is changing within you\nso the physical sensation of hunger will\nchange but also the urge will be\nsatisfied\nand this is the really key thing if you\nwant to overcome the binge eating\nwhen you eat you must have awareness of\nwhich urges are being satisfied\nbecause you're satisfying urges that are\nnot physical\nand once you start to eat you'll start\nto be able as you do this practice\nyou'll start to be able to differentiate\nout the physical sensation from the\npsychological urge\nand as you gain\nawareness of the psychological urge\nthat will then give you the foundation\nof what you should accept\nam i able to open my eyes yes\nokay it's hard for me to concentrate my\nmind just wondering\nokay yeah so that's also common thing so\ni'm glad you mentioned that so people\nwith adhd sometimes\nuh\nconcentrate better with their eyes open\nso when you\nwhen you drink your smoothie actually\nyou can have your eyes open if you want\njust have to hear it like something\njust have your whatever allows you to\nfocus on the sensation of hunger\nthe crossing from hunger to an urge\nwhich if you can catch that that would\nbe beautiful but it may happen over like\na longer period of time\nand then as you drink the smoothie\nnotice the sensation of hunger as it\nchanges and notice what you're\nsatisfying and then you should do this\nwith more than a smoothie\nso the next time that you're you know\nit's 2 a.m and you've stayed up too late\nand it's way past dinner and you feel\nlike eating something then you'll be\nable to sit with the hunger and the urge\nand there are two discreet things as you\neat a cookie the hunger what changes\nwith the hunger and the urge\nand what's getting satisfied\nand once you understand what it is that\nfood satisfies for you then you'll\nunderstand what is the root of your\nproblem and what needs to be fixed and\nas you fix that the binge eating will\nfall apart\nthat's fascinating\nyeah\ni like that\ncool\nit's hard\nyeah it doesn't sound easy but\ni for sure want to give that a go i'll\nget back to you on that\nawesome man\nwell thank you very much john for coming\non today\nit was a pleasure\nuh it was a lot of fun talking to you\nand getting to meet you um\nthanks for having me on i appreciate it\nyeah man i really appreciate it i think\nyou talked about something that um we\nactually haven't spent a whole lot of\ntime talking about so i'm really happy\nthat i mean i'm supposed to say i'm\nreally happy you have a binge eating\n[Laughter]\nyou know so i'm really happy that you\nchose to talk about that and i think\nespecially talking to you has helped\num really reinforce for me like how\ncomplex\nour relationship with food is and i\nthink it's sometimes way more than just\na binge eating disorder which you may or\nmay not have\nand you know if you want to get\nevaluated by someone you should\nabsolutely do that but\nthat's not like a nice ease of mind yeah\nno thank you so much it's really good\nyeah you too\nbye later\nyou"
