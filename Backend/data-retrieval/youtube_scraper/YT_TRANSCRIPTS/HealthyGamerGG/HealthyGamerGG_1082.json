    "transcript": "my stats are kind of screwed up and i'm\ntrying to fix them but it ain't going\nwell so life is an rp life isn't a race\nit's an rpg and most of you maxed out\nthe wrong set so like what do y'all\nthink about this\nlike what is the what is the what are\nthe mechanics\nwhat are the rules of life in\nadvancement you guys get that like this\nis an important question and i think\nit's a really important question because\nthey don't like teach us what the basic\nmechanics of how to live life are so let\nme give you all an example\nso a lot of people out there who feel\nlike it's too late\nso they feel like you know oh my god\nlike i missed\ni missed like this milestone right like\noh i'm 24 and like i haven't graduated\nfrom college therefore like it's too\nlate people feel like they screwed up so\nthere's this concept of like\nyou know missed milestones and then\npeople basically feel like\nonce they miss the boat on something\nlike you can't kind of go and get it\nback so this kind of concept entered our\nconsciousness as humanity when people\nfound these uh you know like the wolf\nchildren so there were some like human\nbeings that were raised in the wild and\ndidn't have access or exposure to human\nlanguage and what psychologists\ndiscovered is that if a human like\ndoesn't get any access or exposure to\nlanguage by a particular\nage\nthey it becomes impossible for them to\nlearn language that their brain sort of\nwires in a particular way and then like\na door is forever close to them\nand so the main question is like is that\ngenerally speaking how life works like\nwhat are the what is the rpg system\nthat best mirrors like how you gain\nlike stats and level up in life like\nwhat does it actually work like\nso\ni'd say that in general life is sort of\nlike closest to\nfor lack of\nthere may be a better example of this\nbut like one of these elder scrolls\ngames where basically the more you do\nsomething the more you level up in it so\nthe first thing is like this concept of\nmissed milestones i think is like not\nreally accurate so we see this a lot for\nexample\num hopefully this paper will get\npublished soon but we wrote a paper\nabout incels\nwhere one of the key things about incels\none of the shared experience that they\nhave is that there's a missed milestone\nof social development so they feel like\noh i've never had a girlfriend in high\nschool or i'm 23 and i've never had a\ngirlfriend or i'm 23 and never had a\nboyfriend whatever\nand so since they missed the boat on\nsomething they're like forever screwed\num and so\nwhat what the kind of concept of missed\nmilestone is is that\nafter a certain point there's been an\nunchangeable course correction which has\ndoomed you to failure and therefore\nyou're like\nnever going to succeed\nand so we see this a lot within our\ncommunity where people say like oh it's\ntoo late for me like i'm x number of\nyears and i haven't done x y or z so\nlike i'm screwed\nright and so this is another example\nwhere people will say like they'll go\nback to this kind of concept which is\nthat you know you've spent your time\nlike you've used your time or spent your\ntime maxing out the wrong stats so if\nyou spend all of your time like maxing\nout your league of legends skill and\nyour you know\nvalerian skill brought to you by riot\ngames\num are you basically screwed\nand so the short answer like in my\nopinion like the answer is clearly no so\nlike let me give you guys a simple\nexample okay\nso like let's say that\nuh\nlet's say like i watch a bunch of anime\nand i sort of passively acquire some\namount of japanese right so if you like\nwatch a bunch of anime like you\nyou've like wasted let's say four years\nwatching anime like you learn a little\nbit there's some amount of like passive\nxp that you get from watching anime\nbut people who have gone like four years\nof like watching anime and like may be\nable to you know say things like you\nknow i'll never forgive you or sakai no\ntamini\nor whatever right\nlike you're it's not you're not actually\nlearning anything so you can spend like\nfour years and then what people will\nconclude is they'll say like oh i've\nspent four years like wasting my time\nwatching\nwhat chat like who do you what do you\ntake me for huh\nyou know\nlike what did you guys think that i'm a\nposer did you not think that i'm one of\nyou\nyou have to remember chat that i'm one\nof you it runs deep\nit runs deep with me dude\nit goes all the way down to the bottom\none of us\num\nso what was it yeah\nso like here's the first thing it's like\nthere's some amount of passive xp that\nyou get from like doing what you're\nyou're doing right if we live our life\nand we're just sort of like passively\nleveling up random skills like skills at\nvideo games or like whatever right\nlearning a little bit of japanese at the\nend of the day you can actually like\ngain a lot of ground if you just put\nyour mind to it and we'll get to that in\na second so just just to give you guys\nlike a little bit of context right about\nlike how i got to where i am so\nso i played a bunch of video games in\nhigh school like i didn't know how to\nplay any sports like i couldn't like you\nknow i didn't play a musical instrument\ni sort of like played a little bit of\npiano but\nyou know stopped playing piano when i\nwas 15 years old and between like 15 and\nlike graduating high school like i\ndidn't really learn anything like i went\nto class\npassively learned stuff right because\nyou're sitting there in class and you're\nlike\npassively like learning mathematics i\ndid the minimum amount of work necessary\nto pass or sometimes didn't even pass in\nhigh school\nand then college rolled around and then\nlike i was 18 19 20 i was like oh i'm\ngonna go to college like you know i'm\ngonna party i'm gonna meet chicks like\nall this stuff and then like my 20th\nbirthday rolled around i had never\nreally been on a date like never really\nhad a girlfriend\nand um\nso like\nyou know it was it was maybe i'd been on\nsomething like a date but\num\nand so i felt like i was like falling\nbehind right i felt like i had kind of\nmissed the boat and even like years\nlater when i was like 26 years old so i\ngraduated at the age of 22 or 23\nand then like at 26 i remember going to\na holiday party\nand meeting my friends who i used to be\nin high school with who are now like\ndoctors they were like graduating\nmedical school and so i had like no job\nlike like net worth of basically zero\nlike didn't couldn't play an instrument\ni basically had i'd spent some time in\nindia which i didn't realize was worth a\nlot at that time\num but i basically like on paper i was\nworth nothing right so i had like a\nbachelor's degree in neurobiology with\nlike\nthat was three or four years old with\nlike no work experience some work\nexperience but not really anything\nsignificant\nso\nyou know you kind of like get to that\npoint in life and you're thinking like\nwow i've missed all the milestones and\ni'm basically screwed and so i still\nremember applying to medical school and\nkind of thinking like oh in four years\nif i graduate like if i start med school\nif i apply at 26 i could potentially get\nin because the application cycle is like\none year and then you get in for the\nnext year so most people will apply\ntheir junior year of college so that\nthey can start after their senior year\nso there's like a two-year lag time for\nmed school so i was like if i apply now\ni'll start med school when i'm 28 and\ni'll finish when i'm 32. and i remember\nhaving these thoughts that oh my god\nit's going to be too late\nand like i've screwed up\nright that like it's\ni should have done this\nsuch a long time ago\nbut the truth of the matter is and then\nwhat happens is our mind once we have\nthat kind of thought it like demotivates\nus and we don't feel like doing anything\nwe're like oh my god it's too late like\ni'm gg sol\ni can't recover\nbut the truth is that in four years like\ni'm going to be 32 either way like it\ndoesn't really matter like the real\nchoices do i want to be like 32 and have\nan md or do i want to be a 32 and not\nhave an md like that's the real choice\nbut that's not the way that our mind\nthinks about it right all it thinks\nabout is all the time that's passed and\nall the milestones we've missed it\ndoesn't really think about okay what are\nthe different options for when i'm 32\nand which one do i want to pick\nso that's really important if y'all are\nlike kind of feeling like you've missed\nout and it's too late for you let's say\nyou're like 25 and you've never been on\na date\nand then at the age of 30 you've got\ntwo options so you're saying okay i'm 25\ngg like\nforever alone right like finished\num but then like you could say like okay\nthree years from now like you may still\nbe alone or you could not be alone like\nwhich one would you prefer and that's\nwhat you should move towards\nand this is where leveling up comes in\nbecause i don't think that unlike rpgs i\ndon't think life has like diminishing\nor it doesn't have like exponential more\nexperience required to level up\nso i think life is like you can just\naccrue skill points whenever you want to\nby spending time doing the activity you\ncan level up all of your crafting skills\nsequentially if you want to it doesn't\nreally matter you can just level up\nwhatever you put your mind to and this\nkind of goes back to like learning past\nuh japanese so you can like watch anime\nfor four years and learn how to say i'll\nnever forgive you for the sake of the\nworld or you can just sit down and\nliterally learn japanese in two months\nright so if you spent like a dedicated\namount of time studying japanese and\nlearning japanese you can like become\nproficient in the language in 60 days\nthat's all it takes\nso this is the concept of deliberate\npractice which i think malcolm gladwell\nkind of like popularized is this idea\nthat like if you put your mind to\nsomething you can accumulate any kind of\nlike skill that you want to\nso it doesn't sort of matter that you've\nspent all of your point it so this is\nthe other thing is in life like skill\npoints are not limited so in video games\nlike there's like oh we only have like\n60 skill points so how do we want to\nbuild them and if i've spent too much\ntime putting them into video games or\nlike you know anime expertise\nlike i'm screwed because i've used up\nall my skill points this is the the big\nthing about life is that\nyou can farm skill points every single\nday like you can just wake up today and\nfarm a skill point if you want to\nand so that's why we see you know two\nkinds of people like there are people\nthat will excel at many many many things\nand people who oftentimes excel at\nnothing and we'll talk about the middle\nground in a second\nand so the truth of the matter is that\neven if you've maxed all of the wrong\nstats you can just start maxing up other\nones right so this is kind of\ninteresting like i think what was it uh\num\nthere was a there's a great quote from\nlike\nrome or sparta or something that you\nknow they they teach their warriors to\nbe scholars and their scholars should be\nwarriors because if you're a warrior who\nhasn't studied things you're gonna be\nlike stupid and you'll make mistakes and\nif you're a scholar who's never fought\nlike your policies won't\nincorporate\nlike understanding of like combat and\nstuff like that so i forget exactly what\nthe quote was if somebody can remind me\nbut\nso i think like that's a really good\nexample of we have this idea in our mind\nthat human beings can't be both but the\ntruth of the matter is that you can\nexercise for two hours a day if you want\nto and like study for four hours a day\nif you want to right like you can\nactually do all of it\nyou don't there's not a limited number\nof\num like there's not a limited number of\nstat points that you'll have so even if\nyou've screwed things up you can still\ninvest it like in cultivating farming\nmore stat points today\nand it kind of doesn't matter\noh yeah so so this is great so thank you\nvery much so\num\nsomeone's saying this\noh crap\nyeah the society that separates its\nscholars from its warriors will have its\nthinking done by cowards and it's\nfighting done by fools\nfor us are two coming in clutch that's\nexactly the quote that i was thinking of\nso there's sort of this idea that we\nhave that there's a limited number of\nstat points that we have and if you've\nwasted them you can't get more which is\nnot true you can learn you know you can\nstudy japanese for three months and\nbecome proficient in it and then you can\ngo and study mandarin and then you can\ngo and study hindi and then you can go\nand study arabic and within the span of\none year you can be proficient in four\nlanguages\nso this is kind of what we've seen in\nour coaching program is that like\num\nthat it takes about so if people are\nwondering so if you're someone who has\nmisused your stat points up until this\npoint the question that a lot of people\nask is\nokay how long does it take for me to\nlike get\nput my life together\nand so this is where i would say there\nare a couple of different things the\nfirst is that eight weeks is the amount\nof time it takes to start moving your\nlife in the right direction so a lot of\npeople feel like they have inertia lack\nof motivation like they don't they're\nnot really doing anything eight weeks is\nthe amount of time that it takes to\nstart moving your life in the right\ndirection coincidentally it also appears\nthat eight weeks is the amount of time\nthat it takes to start to make\nneuroscience changes in your brain like\nif you consistently do something for a\nperiod of about eight weeks\nyour brain will start to change\nwhat we see in our coaching program is\nthat optimal outcomes tend to take about\n12 weeks\nso even in our content creator program\nwith twitch we've lengthened the program\nfor 8 to 12 weeks based on a year of\nresearch so what we sort of discovered\nis that people start to make change in\neight weeks and then they're really like\nyou know they're really like at a good\npace 12 weeks in so it takes about three\nmonths to start to put your life\ntogether\nwhat we see is in a period of about 40\nweeks if you're focused and put your\nmind to things you can like make a\ndrastic change to your life so 40 weeks\nis is like the kind of the minimum\namount to turn your life around in my\nexperience\nand what i've seen with people time and\ntime and time again is about 40 weeks to\ntwo years is what it takes to like turn\nyour life around by 180 degrees\nso i've had people who were\nmid-20s unemployed never had a job\nmaking six figures a year in two years\nlike if they just put their mind to it\nand so you may wonder like okay so what\nwhat is it that changes over the course\nof like eight week eight to forty weeks\nlike what are we working on so i'll give\nyou guys just a couple of examples so\none is that people start working on\nsomething that i call the hidden\ncurriculum so these are the the\nskill points that you invest in things\nthat like become super op so a good\nexample is like how to learn so if you\nlevel up your learning ability you get\nlike an xp buff across all of your\ndifferent things\nother examples of the hidden curriculum\nare like how to communicate\nhow to find motivation so these core\naspects of of self that if you use\ndeliberate practice on these domains\nif you discover like how to find\nmotivation how to communicate and how to\nlearn then all of the things after that\nwill become much much much better\nover the course of 12 to 40 weeks what\nare some neuroscience changes that we\nsee so a good example is like a change\nin self-talk\nso if we look at why people stay stuck\nyou know there's a little voice in your\nhead that will encourage you to not do\nanything or it will discourage you from\nmaking a change because it says things\nlike oh it's too late oh like you know\ndon't bother like oh like look at all\nthese other people so there's a little\nvoice in your head that actually is like\nsabotaging all of your efforts\nso when you work with someone like a\ntherapist or a coach for like 12 weeks\n16 weeks 20 weeks or on your own if you\nwork on your self-talk it takes time to\nrewire those neurons in your brain to\nproduce a different kind of self-talk\nand what we see what i see with my\ntherapy patients for example is like 40\nweeks\ninto the into therapy\nwhat starts to happen is they'll start\nto say something and then i will ask\nthem a question they'll say i knew you\nwere gonna ask that\nor i'll say something to them they'll be\nlike i know you i knew you were gonna\nsay that i knew that was coming i was\ndreading you saying that even when i\ncame into my appointment today i was\ngoing to tell you this i didn't know\nexactly what you would say so that is a\nprime example of changing your self-talk\nbecause then their brain\nis able to produce what i offer them and\nso the reason that i tend to work with\npeople for like a year or two is like\nthey become trained in like saying and\nthinking the way that i do they\nbasically learn that way of thinking and\nthen they no longer need me then they're\nlike\nkind of fixed right so that's like\nliterally changing your self-talk\nso that's just how long it takes like\nyou have to have you know people will\nask questions like how do i gain\nconfidence in myself if they grew up in\nan abusive household where they like\nwere you know taught to be not confident\nthe way that you gain that is by\nactually exposing yourself to people who\nare confident in you so we see this in\ngroup coaching a lot where people are\nlike you know i'm here like they don't\nrealize this when they come in but we're\nteaching them how to change their\nself-talk and so that's why group\ncoaching will see a lot of like benefit\nthat seems to happen\nsuddenly\nwithout any like warning like late in\nthe game 12 weeks 16 weeks in people\njust start making changes in their life\nand they're really like no one\nunderstands how it happened you don't\nsee it coming so seven weeks eight weeks\npeople don't feel like they're making\nany progress and then suddenly they kind\nof wake up one day and they're like\nstarting to do really well\nand how why is that it's because when\nyou go into group coaching and they're\nlike 10 people there or eight people or\nsix people that are\nchanging the way that they treat you and\nthey're treating you in a different way\nyour mind sort of gets a different\nexperience\nso this is just kind of to summarize\nlike you know we kind of got off track\nthere but\ngenerally speaking if you feel like\nyou've lost your\nlike if you've wasted all your points in\nin life and you've like missed key\nmilestones the good news is that you can\nlearn basically at any time like the\nidea of a age or i'm too old for this\nunless you're like you know a woman who\nwants to like bear children or something\nlike there's some biological you know\nlike\nuh you know barriers which are very hard\nto overcome if you're a 75 year old\nwoman or a man i suppose and you decide\nthat you want to have children like bear\na child like there may be biological\nconstraints\nbut outside of that you know if you're\n25 30 35 and you want to go back to\ncollege you want to start becoming a\ngame developer like you know whatever it\nis that you want to do\ndeliberate practice and focusing your\nmind on something will allow you to work\non it you can just always farm up skill\npoints you just have to start farming\nwhen it comes to turning your life\naround i would say eight weeks is the\namount of time it takes to start\nyou should be rolling by 12 weeks by 40\nweeks some people will have turned their\nlife around and give yourself two years\nof deliberate work and basically people\nwill ask me they'll come in with like\ntrauma and abuse and like being on drugs\nand all this stuff and they're like my\nlife is nowhere i'm 26 years old you\nknow\nhow do i fix all these problems and i'll\nbe like give me two years\nif in the worst case scenario it's taken\nme about two years\ni'm thinking about some patients of mine\nthat have really had like trauma and\naddictions and like are unemployed and\nin their like mid to late 20s even early\n30s\nand you know in a two-year time span\nthey are\nyou know in school for something that\nthey really care about\nand so i had one patient for example who\nbecame like a plumber\nand so would work a lot and then like\nwas making like 80 or 100 bucks an hour\nand then was also\nlike doing game development on the side\nso they're like their passion is game\ndevelopment they figured out okay i'm\ngonna become a plumber i'm gonna work\nnights because i'm a night owl anyway\nand then the upside of working nights is\nthat 24-hour plumbing services you get\nto charge more right because it's like\nyou're showing up at someone's house at\nthree in the morning so he'll go to\nsomeone's house at three in the morning\nwork for two hours and make like five\nhundred dollars\nand then if he doesn't get any calls\nhe's just working on his game design\nit's like it's a great life that he's\ncrafted but it takes about two years to\nget there\nso does that make sense so at the end of\nthe day life is an rpg like that's\ntotally fine if you've wasted all your\nstat points and the wrong skills like\nthat's okay too you can just farm up\nmore stat points all it takes deliberate\npractice and patience\nyou"
