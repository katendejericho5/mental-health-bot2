    "transcript": "and then the first realization of\nstreaming sets in\nand that is this axiom if you're not\ngrowing you're dying so let's see let's\nsee what's going on here\nokay does this y'all can see this here\nthis uh streamer's being depressed\nstreamers pack watch depression\num anyway don't call this good game if\nyou see me right now\nuh i was i was talking like i've talked\nto a few streamers i talked to xqc\nhassan mizzy\nin my own feelings even cycuno\nand i realized that every single\nstreamer will readjust how they feel\nabout how they're doing like very\nquickly so if they're like 10k andy like\nyou know everyone was at one point and\nthen they jump to 20k andy they'll be\nlike oh that's really exciting it's cool\nnovel and then they will immediately\nlike within a week be like i am a 20k\nandy anything below that is bad oh yeah\nand then they'll be like if i just hit\n30k i'll be happy it's called there's a\nlot of aspects here one is called the\ndisease of more uh-huh you just need\nmore and more and more to fill the void\nespecially if you drop below some sort\nof watermark it's arbitrary yeah it's\nlike it's it's really [ __ ] up\ngambling's the same way i would know\nwhat's funny is there's always a number\nthough that they'll be like if i hit\nthis i will be happy like if i can just\nconsistently get 30k viewers i'll be\nhappy and all of them the answer is no\nlike even xqc the biggest streamer on\nthe platform i remember during shitcon\nhe was like 110k like gta rp just\nkilling it then he would like drop down\na 60. you know he's streaming at like\nmidnight to like 7 a.m degenerate\nschedule and then he was at chicago he's\nlike oh yeah i'm [ __ ] watch dude like\ni got no content and it's like he's\nmostly saying it in like an ironic way\nbut i think he like part of him like\nsees the night he's not blind he sees\nthe [ __ ] numbers so they're all\ndepressed and all thinking about it are\nyou depressed\nno because you know what i know this is\nwhat i realized what i did i hit the\nsubathon [ __ ]\nthe largest penis on mount rushmore yeah\nand then i pivoted what made the yard\nmade mogul merch and now all of my like\nself happiness is in those projects yeah\nyou are you sort of invested not your\nmoney well it's your money to an extent\nbut mostly your emotional uh\nitself into different buckets what\npercentage of your happiness is in the\nyard you diversified the yard happiness\nis it's like a solid like like 12.\nokay that's pretty good\n12\nyeah i don't know i think pretty good i\nthink that you struggle to think\ncritically about your own hat see that's\nwhat i'm saying right bro you started\ntalking about dude you started talking\nand he instantly was playing drums i\nknow like it's like\nso what i'm saying is that\nright how is it now you're an ape oh a\nlittle head action wow\n[Music]\nlike tyler1 like the people who\nliterally show up to play a video game\nthey love like tens\nshroud's probably happy because he just\nshows up and just plays whatever i'm\ngonna just pause this for a second\nso i\ni guess i was supposed to react to this\nand sorry so sometimes instead of\nreacting i suppose i just listen\n[Laughter]\nso let's just take a look at this too so\ni saw that this was not the only so i\nguess ludwig and co were talking about\nyou know all streamers being depressed\nand there was this article i think\nyesterday in the wall street journal\nabout twitch live streamers talking\nabout how playing games is hard work and\nthen like aching back stress and weight\ngain or job hazards for video gamers\nand others who perform online for hours\na day in front of an audience for the\nmost the money isn't even that good so\nyou don't have to do this performing\nonline\nthis is just the job hazards for gaming\nyou don't even have to be a streamer you\ncan still get aching back stress and\nweight gain\nbut so i i wanted to share with you guys\nlike so here's what i kind of think\nabout this stuff right so the this this\nguy was talking about kind of this um\nthe the hedonistic treadmill\nor like the disease of more or whatever\nso at this point at healthy gamer we've\nworked with like hundreds of content\ncreators\nand here's like basically what we've\nlearned okay so the first thing to\nunderstand about like mental health and\ncontent creators and like burnout and\nstuff\ni've done burnout work um at hospitals\ni've done it at law firms i've done it\nat investment banks private equity firms\ni've done it at colleges\nand so\nthe first thing to understand is that\nthere are some aspects of burnout that\nare specific to a particular industry\nand then there are some aspects of\nburnout that are actually like common\nright\nso a big thing that's going on with\nstreamers nowadays is when they say like\noh we're all depressed\ni think there's legitimacy that we'll\nget to that in a second\nbut the first thing to understand is\nthat there are some aspects of burnout\nthat may be applicable to everyone\nwhether you're a college student or you\nwork at an investment bank or you're a\nstreamer\nbut one of the things that we really\nhave learned is that technology and the\nsituations that it creates including\nstreaming have a set of specific\nchallenges\nthat are common within that industry and\nthose tend to be a little bit different\nfrom like standard kinds of burnout\nso here's basically what happens with a\nstreamer okay you start out with like\nyou start streaming right and at the\nbeginning it's fun you've got like five\nviewers you're doing it on the side it's\nnot like a part of your job or anything\nlike that you're gonna show up on chat\nlike three people show up y'all are\nvibing they're having a good time you're\nhaving a good time there's no\nexpectations about it right there's no i\nlike you're just doing it because it's\nfun so that's like the beginning of the\nstreamer life cycle okay so here's the\nstreamer life cycle it starts out you're\nsmall no expectations whatever then you\nstart growing\nand then like maybe you start making a\nlittle bit of money and that's like\nsuper exciting at the beginning right\nlike this is happening it's a real thing\nyour your twitch chat is loving you your\nstream is growing people are posting\nabout it you get a clip on lsf like yay\nright so 100 viewers 200 viewers 300\nviewers maybe you get rated by someone\nyou're up to like a thousand viewers\nand then the first realization of\nstreaming sets in\nand that is this axiom if you're not\ngrowing you're dying so then your mind\nstarts to think okay i've got two\noptions like either i'm growing or i'm\ndying right that's what happens on the\ninternet it's what happens in social\nmedia it's like either people are\ngrowing or they're dying and this\nbecomes a serious problem because once\nyou start creating content and like your\ncontent does well this is the tricky\nthing\nwhy is it doing well\nyou don't know\nright like you never really understand\nit's not like you have you can do a\nbiopsy to twitch chat and and figure out\nwhat's doing well and what isn't like\nsomething about what you're doing is\nkind of like organic and it's free and\nit's fun and people seem to be liking it\nand if you've got to be growing\notherwise you're dying so how do you\ngrow more you're not really sure because\nyou don't really understand what's\nresponsible for your growth in the first\nplace\nand so faced with this kind of idea of\nyou're not if you're not growing you're\ndying then what happens is you're like i\ndon't know how to consistently grow\nright and this is where the first phase\nof burnout\nuh kind of happens which is like i can't\nconsistently grow i don't know what this\nformula is but what i can control what\nis within my control to affect growing\nor dying is how much i stream\nso if i farm\nstreaming right like if i just stream\nfor 10 hours a day 12 hours a day if i\ndo this if i do that if i just stream\nmore if i give more of myself to this\nthing\nthen my chances of growing are greater\nthan my chances of dying that's the only\nthing we can really figure out as\nstreamers is that i can increase the\namount of time i spend on something to\nbecome more successful\nso they start to give of themselves to\nthe stream right and in really drastic\nsituations you end up with cases like\nice poseidon where like you know he gave\neverything he had to his stream and it\ndid not end well so you have to grow or\nyou're dying that's phase one so you\ngive of yourself and then you start to\nburn out phase two is you're kind of\nestablished you're like you're a\nstreamer now now there's a financial\nincentive and like you're sort of like\nyou've quit your job you're making\nenough money you've made it as a\nstreamer so this is like where the gravy\ntrain is rolling in right you're making\nsome money you're paying your bills\npeople are vibing with you you roll out\nyour merch like everything's going great\nand so you should be happy at that point\nright no no no here's where the second\nrevelation of streaming comes in\nthe sand in your hourglass is running\nout because no streamer lasts forever so\nat the first phase you're growing or\ndying but eventually all organisms come\nto an end death is inevitable right it's\nnot you can't not gonna be like a 60\nyear old streamer because that's what\nhappens to streamers so then what\nhappens is streamers start to like think\nlike oh my god i better milk this before\ni get small there's going to be an\ninevitable\nreduction in my viewer account\nand so i've got to milk it for as long\nas i can because i don't know if this is\ngoing to be around a year from now i\ndon't know if everyone's going to leave\nme a year from now there's a lot of\nother things going into that but then\nthe sand and the hourglass starts\nrunning out so then what you have to do\nis like can you cut back on your stream\nhours no no no\nnow that you've started to be successful\nif you start to cut back people will\nleave someone else will grow it's going\nto be gg so you better make the money\nwhile you can you better grow while you\ncan because who knows when there's going\nto be someone who's funnier sexier more\nintelligent more capable than you are\nwho starts streaming and then they're\ngoing to take your viewers\nso now you're trapped\nright because this is an opportunity\nthat will run out by now because this\nsale ends at the end of the month you\nhave three days if you order in the next\n72 hours you will get an additional 20\noff and then that opportunity will never\ncome back to you ever again and then\neverything that you've invested in the\nstreaming because let's remember that\nyou kind of quit your job you dropped\nout of school and all that kind of stuff\nyou don't have any option b so now like\nthe sand in the hourglass is running out\nso you better you know go as hard as you\ncan for as long as you can before it's\ntoo late\nso now there's a fear there's an\nuncertainty there's a paranoia that all\nof your opportunity will be gone\nthen you enter the third phase of\nstreaming the third phase of burnout in\nthe stream or life cycle and that's when\nlike you've grown so big that suddenly\nlike you feel trapped i know it sounds\nkind of weird but at some point you sort\nof figure out what the internet wants\nfrom you and when you started out\nstreaming it was like streaming for fun\nright you did what you wanted to do and\nthe internet responded to it but then\nover time what happens is like your\naudience has certain expectations they\nexpect quality from you they expect\nperfection from you they expect the same\nformula because that's how you succeed\nright\nyou don't have like a successful content\ncreator who is like cooking one day and\nplaying wow the next day and then like\nyou know talking about lecturing about\ncalculus the third day streamers have a\nparticular niche and generally speaking\nthe more that you support that niche the\nmore you grow but the more that you\nsupport that niche and the more you grow\nbecause of that niche the more trapped\nyou become\nand so the third phase of burnout is\nlike you've got a million followers\nand you have big streams but you can't\ndo what you feel like anymore because\neveryone wants you to be a particular\nthing\nright and we see this with like\na lot of streamers where it's not just\nstreamers it even happens with\ncelebrities who get like typecast right\nso like that's the current incarnation\nof typecasting a celebrity it's like a\nstreamer gets trapped by the content\nthat they create and then they fall into\nthis problem where they can't really\nlike they don't want to do it anymore it\ndoesn't feel fun anymore it's not\norganic it's forced but you can't stop\nbecause people expect it from you and\nlike you just gotta keep going so that's\nthe third stage of burnout so this is\nlike burn the burnout life cycle for\nstreamers that we have discovered after\nyou know working with hundreds of of\nstreamers we've discovered that there's\nactually like a specific and common\nthing within streaming is an industry\nthat's different from like working at a\nlaw firm for example\nand this is what it looks like\non top of that there are these things\nthat i call amplifiers so interlaced\nthrough all of this that amplifies the\nburnout at each step of the\nstep of the way\nis social media so this is like a real\nproblem because at every step of the way\nsocial media and comparison are always\nhappening because at each step of the\nway there's like some kind of comparison\nthat makes each of those three stages\nworse when you're growing there's\nsomeone else who's growing more than you\nare\nwhen the sand in the hourglass is\nrunning out when you're in phase two you\nsee other streamers that are like you\nthat begin to die\nright and then you're like oh my god\nlike this person is fading away into\nnothingness and that's gonna be me next\nor other people are blowing up while you\nare just growing right so you see other\npeople who are eclipsing you there's\nanother wow streamer now now there's a\nlost art streamer oh my god can you\nimagine how many mmo streamers started\n[ __ ] their pants when asmond gold\nstopped streaming wow just think about\nthat for a second right i'm not blaming\nanyone in any of that just to be clear\nright because people should stream what\nthey want to stream\nbut like\nlike asmin gold is coming for us right\nlike he's coming for our followers\nthat's the way that streamers reacted to\nhim like changing games\nand so that like even at the second\nphase it's like oh my god what happens\nif another streamer pops up or like and\nthey grow bigger than i do or like a big\nstreamer decides to get into that game\nam i going to grow am i not going to\ngrow\nthen you end up in the third phase where\nlike you're looking around you've got a\nbunch of followers a lot of people are\nlike liking your tweets you start\nattracting hate farmers by the way so\nthat's the other thing that happens when\nyou get really big right is there's a\ngroup of people that are hate farmers\nand so these are people that that have\nyoutube channels or like twitch reacts\nor whatever and the purpose of their\ncontent the food for their content is\nlike reacting or trashing you as a very\nlarge streamer so there's like a bunch\nof stuff that goes into this in terms of\nsocial media and comparison that just\namplifies all three layers of burnout\nand if if you want to know like you know\nwhy are people like this you know i\ntotally get what people are saying like\neveryone's depressed and streaming\nyou know like the wall street journal\nit's like even penetrated into like\nmainstream media and the wall street\njournal is writing an article about it\nand why is that it's because there's a\nparticular thing going on\nright like this is something that's a\ncommon shared experience that most\ncontent creators have\nand so we try to help people with this\nstuff i think that this is like part of\nthe problem is that you know you can go\nsee a psychiatrist or therapist and i\nknow a lot of streamers that have really\nbenefited from seeking mental health\ntreatment which i think is fantastic and\nat the same time like no one is going to\nteach you this in medical school right\nlike they're not going to teach you the\ncontent creator burnout life cycle\nbecause this is a new thing there have\nnot been studies published on this so\nthe best that we've got is like\nnoobs like us like actually working with\nthese people for like a year or two and\nthis is kind of what we conclude\nso thankfully twitch is like pretty\nsupportive about this kind of thing so\nyou know\nthis stream sponsored by twitch not\nreally but i mean like they're good i\nthink they recognize that this is a\nproblem and like\nthey've been pretty supportive so we're\ngrateful for that\num and those of you i mean i guess you\nguys know but we have a content creator\nprogram and like this is a this is legit\nthis is a real thing\ni know it's kind of also different\nbecause we don't i mean usually we talk\nabout y'all as the audience right so\nlike our target audience here at healthy\ngamer is like the chat right it's not\nthe streamer and we sometimes interview\nbig streamers and stuff like we do that\nbut that also is not about it's not so\nmuch about streaming it's more about you\nknow like showing\ny'all that these are like regular normal\nhuman beings who have regular normal\nhuman struggles\nso\nyou know i think it's\nanyway\nso if you guys want to understand like i\ncompletely agree that streamer mental\nhealth is is tough\nand we've seen a lot of burnout and i\nthink part of the problems is that there\nare new and specific things\nthat relate to stream or mental health\nthat like can be acted on in a specific\nand targeted way and a lot of what we\ntry to do is teach people like okay how\ndo you learn and i think um ludwig even\ntalked about this so how do you\ndiversify your sense of identity and\nvalue outside of streaming so this is a\ncore thing when your identity is tied up\nin your view count\nright like how many people are watching\nthen as the view count goes up and down\nyour identity goes up and down with it\nand the problem is because of the way\nthat metrics work so in the history of\nhumanity you've never been able to\nquantify\nthe value of a human being as easily as\nyou can today so sure like maybe a\nhundred years ago you had people who\ncould quantify wealth in some way you\nhad kings and you had nobles and stuff\nlike that sure\nbut you also had like regular people who\nwere like living on a street and it's\nlike how much is each human being worth\nit's like kind of weird because it\nwasn't quantified right you've got the\nmore popular people you've got the less\npopular people and like sure there's\nclearly a hierarchy but it's all kind of\nfuzzy\nthere's not like a number to it and now\nwhat we've managed to do with the\ninternet is we've like quantified our\nvalue as human beings people are\nconcerned about the social credit score\nin china like\nthe social credit score happened here in\nthe west way earlier than it happened in\nchina right it had to do with things\nlike this is how you get like these\nchoosing beggars where like hey i like\nto get a cupcake and then the people\nlike okay cool like it's two dollars for\na cupcake and they're like i have ins i\nhave a hundred thousand instagram\nfollowers you should give it to me for\nfree this is my value as a human being\nand it is worth more than two dollars so\ngive me cup cupcake please thank you\nvery much\nwe have quantified value of human beings\nright we've already done it it's it's\nthere\nand so now that we've like kind of done\nthis it's like messing up our society\nit's kind of bizarre\nwe've done it already\nand so now you've got streamers that are\ninvesting their sense of identity\nwith a particular metric right that's\nwhat i'm worth as a human being and if i\nbehave in a particular way so many more\npeople like me i get more likes i get\nmore followers i get more subs fantastic\nand this happens in other parts of our\nlife too so this doesn't it's not just\nstreamer specific so this is a root\nissue in yoga called ahankara a hamkar\nor the ego or the sense of identity as a\nhuman being when you get\nwhen you identify\nand become one with some attribute of\nyour life\nyour value as a human being goes up and\ndown depending on that metric\nright so my me personally i'm invested\nin one thing\nwhich is gme and as gme goes up i feel\nlike i'm on top of the world and as gme\ngoes down i feel like i've wasted all my\ntime and my energy and my life savings\ninto something that will blow up in my\nface\nright\nand so like that's what we do as human\nbeings for students right it's grades oh\ni didn't get good grades therefore i'm\nnot a good human being\nsometimes in in some devastating\nsituations it's also the way that we're\ntreated by people people like\nnarcissistic parents like oh my\nnarcissistic parent is mad at me\ntherefore i am a bad human being so we\npeg our identity and our values human\nbeings to all kinds of metrics\nand what happens when you're a content\ncreator and streamer is that it becomes\nso easy\nfor your brain to quantify your value by\npegging it to these external things\nso if you want to become healthier if\nyou want to become freer and ironically\nmake better content because that's i\nthink what we've observed as well\nbecause remember it's the thing that\ncaused you to explode in the first place\nthat authenticity that lack of\nexpectation that like i'm gonna show up\non the internet and just like have a\ngood time that causes people to respond\nthe best anyway\nso like it's it's all i mean there's\nlike so much that's changing\nand so you have to de-identify from\nyou know certain external metrics to\nfind inner peace whether you're a\nstudent whether you have a narcissistic\nparent whether you're a streamer"
