    "transcript": "i could say all those things and there'd\nbe a part of you that would listen right\nbecause remember there's two parts of\nyou and then that other part of you\nwould be like no it's not enough\nhello friend give me just one how are\nyou no of course\ni'm doing great buddy how are you\ni'm good i'm good i'm good do more let\nme just i'm a boomer so you got to give\nme a second bro it's fine no don't worry\nabout it\nyou're all good all right there we go\nand can you can you count to ten for me\nof course uh one two three four five six\nseven eight oh perfect yeah that was\ngreat so welcome jack sorry i'm gonna\ngrab my notebook\nthank you so much so first uh you know\nwelcome to the stream\nthank you we're honored to have you um\nis there something in particular that\nyou prefer to be called like what do you\ngo by\ni i just go by jack no one pence okay\nmost people are in fact full name me\nwhich is a bit weird i don't know that's\nthe thing we usually did as kids and\nthen we kind of grow out of but i tend\nto find i'm full named but no you can\njust call me jack okay so welcome to the\nstream jack um my name is olok or dr k\nand uh i'm i'm really happy to have you\nhere i'm really glad you agreed to come\non\ncouple of ground rules first of all\nnothing that you you don't have to talk\nabout anything that you don't want to\ntalk about\nwe oftentimes have a reputation for\npeople coming on and expressing a lot of\nemotion but we don't have to do that\ni really view this as i'm a resource for\nyou and so anything that you want to\ntalk about or anything that i could help\nyou with i'm more than happy to does\nthat work for you\nyeah brilliant cool so anything that you\nwant to talk about or anything i can\nhelp you with\nthis is this is the one where it's\ndifficult because we are this\ni think\nyou guys reached out to me\nin july\nand and every time it's been like yeah\ni'll come on this week and then\nsomething will come up and i've been\nincredibly busy um and i think one thing\nthe kind of two things that came out uh\none thing that came out through that\nprocess was i'm really bad at organizing\nmyself i'm i'm terribly if not busy\nmentally busy which is a different thing\nentirely um like a lot of the time when\npeople ask me to do things to be like oh\nno i'm busy which isn't always the case\ni actually don't have that many things\nto do a lot of the time but i'm very\nmentally busy i don't always know\nhow to wrap my head around all the\nthings that are going off at once so you\nknow that's one thing uh and then i\nsuppose uh another thing that i i\nthought about\nuh probably a couple of weeks ago but\ni'm i'm a little bit like i've got a bit\nof brain fog because i just moved and\ni'm like in that process of\nyou know like still a bit sleep deprived\nand stuff but um\ni was thinking about um\nkind of this like\nsense of of of self and like who i am in\nterms of i was it was it came from like\na work related thing where i was like\nthinking about um how to move forward\nwith some content stuff and i'm like\nwell\na lot of people will argue that uh\ncontent creation um depending on how you\ndo it um is very personality based and i\nwas like okay great what do people like\nwhat do i bring well and then i just\nkind of sat there and i was like i have\nno idea what about me makes me i was\nlike i don't understand that in this\nlike beautiful um so that was also um i\nthought maybe a discussion that could be\ninteresting i don't really know i don't\nhave much to add about it since that was\nkind of my question it's i have no idea\nhow to approach that problem but jack\nsomething i thought about i think both\nof those are perfect\num so i would love to talk to you about\neither of those two things\nuh or both\nso here's what i heard one is that like\nthe\nsubjective feeling of being busy\nmay be disconnected from what your\ncalendar looks like\nyeah totally\nso we can try to understand like how\ndoes that work\nyou know like what's going on what makes\nus feel busy\num can i just tell you a quick story\nabout that by the way of course yeah\nyeah so we had uh so we had a pilot at\nhealthy gamer that was high performance\ncoaching so it was sort of like working\nwith people who were more successful and\nso there was a really interesting kind\nof theme that came out of that which is\nyou know some people came into the group\ncoaching process expecting like tips\nand they were like oh like they would\ncome in they say i want to work on my\nwork-life balance and so what they were\nreally hoping for is like a few weeks in\nthey were kind of disappointed because\nthey were like i was hoping to be like\nmore efficient right i was hoping i\ncould learn from other people who were\nlike more efficient i'd get tips and\nthen i could be more efficient and then\ni could improve my work-life balance but\nthen what we sort of realized after\ntalking with them is that you know if\nyou were 10 more efficient what would\nyou do with the extra time\nand the answer inevitably was work more\nand so\nyeah yeah so i think a lot of this comes\nfrom the sort of the idea of like\nyou know where does mentally busy come\nfrom\num\nso we could definitely talk about that\nand i think the other thing that is very\nimportant is your sense of self so like\nwho are you and when you make content\nwhat is it that people resonate with\nand um what do you you know how do you\nmake content that is aligned with who\nyou are\nuh which one do you want to start with\num\nor which one's possible\ni think the one that i'd benefit more\nfrom is is probably the mentally busy\npart\num i think i think that's the one i i'd\nrather wrap my head around\nokay then absolutely so we can first\nnotice what's made what's driving your\ndecision\noh\nbeing more efficient\ni'm very\none thing i know about myself is that um\ni'm very success driven like throughout\nevery all of life it's kind of generally\nthat's the thing i'm striving for um and\ni get very upset with failure to the\npoint like very upset with it it's\nsomething and it doesn't even have to be\nvery big failure very minute things kind\nof i don't have a very good sense of\nscale\num i'm very black and white like it's\nlike uh success or failure and that's\nkind of like the binary sort of system\nin which everything is one or the other\nuh and i know that's not quite right and\ni'm trying to not be like that but how\ndo you know i'm not quite right\nwell because certain things\nit's not that it's not quite right i\nsuppose it's more that it is detrimental\nto me to get so deeply upset by these\nthings that i categorize as failure and\nthey're not really that bad like i know\ndeep down that they're not that bad but\ni know also that i'm upset by them and\ni'd rather not be because i find that in\nbeing upset by them all i do is i become\nless motivated i work less and i stumble\ninto more failures\nwhich i then\nlike\nyou you know what it's like this cycle\nthat perpetuates yeah let me see if i\nheard the cycle correctly you kind of\nscrew up\nyeah you tell yourself oh it's not that\nbig of a deal you can bounce back from\nthis don't stress about it don't worry\nabout it if you free yourself of\nscrewing up you can go back to\nsucceeding\nbut\nthe debuff\nfrom screwing up\ncauses you to screw up more\nyes and then maybe even you start\nbeating yourself up for like why can't i\ncleanse this debuff\nyeah yeah that's totally it yeah\nyeah so that's interesting what do you\nthink about that\nit's i i think it's my my biggest\nlike not my biggest flawness so that\nmight not be the right word but it's the\nthing i would wish i could get over\nbecause it's the thing that i find\ncauses me to to i find that a lot of the\ntime when i'm not doing something it's\nlike it's because i'm annoyed about the\nlast thing that went wrong and that's\nwhy this thing's going wrong and it's\nlike if i could just move on from the\nlast thing maybe i could put my full\nattention into this thing okay\nhmm\nsounds like quite a pickle jack\nuh i'm glad you think so i'm glad you\nthink it's a pickle as well\nyeah but did you think\nhow does it feel when i say it sounds\nlike quite a pickle\nwell at that point then it's like it's\nlike oh okay then no one else like\nit's good that i don't sorry it's not\ngood i mean it's it's more\nnormal that i don't have the answers\nlike i've not been able to figure this\nout yeah and all of a sudden if you're\nsat there like wow i don't know what you\nknow it's like well okay that's that\nmakes me feel like i've not been\nthere's a certain level of frustration\nif you were to turn around immediately\nand go this is how you fix that i'd be\nlike wow if i'd known this for the past\nfive years then i would have been you\nknow what i mean if it was such a simple\nanswer but to know it's not i suppose it\nwould make you feel stupid\nyeah of course yeah i feel like yeah\nyeah i don't think you're stupid jack\nno\nthank you\num i think what you're dealing with is\nvery hard and i think the reason it's\nvery hard is because\nbeing the way that you are let me know\nhow this feels to you it you know it's\nkind of like if you weren't so\ndetail-oriented if you didn't beat\nyourself up so much would you be where\nyou are today\nit's that's the difficult question i\ndon't really know i part of me would\npossibly argue no maybe i feel like if i\nwasn't as\num detail-oriented like you say i feel\nlike i'd uh coast more and i possibly\nwouldn't push myself um like i do\nbecause i do push myself quite hard\num and i don't mind that i'm quite happy\nto be the person that stays up till like\nstupid hours in the morning working i'm\nquite fulfilled by being a worker\nthat that i enjoy but it's it's when\num it's the consequences of when that\ngoes wrong\nhow\nit then screws me up for so much longer\nafterwards that that's the problem i\ndon't that's the part i don't like\nhow do you feel about coasting\noh yeah no i can't do it i that i'm very\ni wish i party wishes i could but then\ni'd feel lazy\num and um i feel lazy enough as it is\nand that is and i i feel like i probably\ndo work when you look at it but a lot of\nthe time i'll be like i feel lazy like\ni'm i'm this is to give you a detail\nthis is a then a week where i felt lazy\nand i moved on monday\nand then i went out filming on tuesday i\nunpacked all my things on wednesday\nwhich i didn't like so did nothing but\nunpack all day and i'm like i haven't\nworked today\nand then i went out filming all day on\nthursday\nand then friday\ni packed some more and then my parents\ncame to visit and now it's monday\nand i've felt like\nwow i didn't get much done that week\nwhere really when i think about it where\nwas the time to do all the things but i\ni sat there all week thinking wow i\nreally need to like knuckle down next\nweek because i didn't do much and that's\nyeah i i feel like we're coming up on\nmentally busy\nwhat do you think yes that's yes\nyeah help me understand how i feel yeah\ni feel like a lot of the time i've just\ngot a lot of things to be working on\nand when i feel it's like that sort of\nlike test paralysis thing you know when\nyou've got too many things you're like\nwhoa well i'm just gonna back off and do\nnothing it's like because that's the\neasy you know it's like\nyeah there's this i know i've got to\nlike i've got a million one list of\nthings i have to do in my head and then\nit's like right\nhow do i\nsometimes i'll just sit there and i'm\nnot really doing anything i'm not busy\nin that moment but i feel busy because\nlike well i don't want to be\ndoing anything else because if we're\ndoing anything else i'm gonna take my\nfocus away from trying to figure out\nwhat i should be doing\nif that makes sense i realize yeah\nabsolutely it's also quite a complicated\nthought process to explain because it's\na lot of it's busyness and busyness is\ndifficult to kind of you know so jack i\nthink it's very complicated and\nhopefully you and i can try to\nuntangle it how does that sound\nokay so i'm gonna toss a couple things\nout and you let me know what rings true\nand what doesn't okay you're our compass\nso i'm gonna point the compass in\ndifferent directions and you let me know\nif it aligns\nso\nyou have this list of things that you've\ngot to do right because you're a content\ncreator and you know like okay like i've\ngot to do this and i've got to do this\nand this is going to be hype and this is\ngoing to be great this is going to be\nfun it also fulfills you right so it's\nnot like you're you're like\nyou know a task master in your mind it's\nlike oh this would you're genuinely\nexcited about doing these things\nright\nyeah then what happens is um\nsometimes you can't really act on them\nlike let's say you've got a move for\nexample so in your mind you have a\nthousand tasks and you've gotta move but\nsome for some reason\nmoving never really enters the task list\nright it's not like one of your goals\nlike it's not something you're working\ntowards it's something that kind of gets\nin the way and so as moving so at the\nend of the day you have moved zero steps\nforward on your task list but you have\nmoved\nyeah and then what happens is you kind\nof feel like oh my god like i haven't\nprogressed because this is my task list\nof a thousand things and like instead i\nhad to waste a day moving\nand then\nthat sort of feels like oh my god now i\nlike a day has gone by and i haven't\nmoved forward at all and then like the\nnext day rolls around and you're sort of\nlike oh man\nyou know i should have done stuff\nyesterday and i don't know and like man\ni could have squeezed something in and\nthen you start to maybe beat yourself up\na little bit\nthat in turn could like lead to a little\nbit more paralysis because i think\nbeating yourself up is kind of like a\ncoin flip sometimes it drives you and\nit's like man like totally yeah i'm\nnever gonna do this again never again\nlike let's do it yeah jack like let's go\nand other times it's like oh man like i\nwish i had done it\nyeah and i i tend to fall on that ladder\ni think more because i have friends who\nwho i went to advice for and he tried to\nmotivate me the way he motivates himself\nwhich is harsh criticism which works\ngreat for him because he feels like wow\ni can be better that's how he sees it\nwhere i go\ni'm just like kind of sigh and don't\nwant to do anything um so i definitely\nthat that experience was like yeah no\nthat's definitely beating myself up\ndoesn't really motivate me much it can\ndo of course it can but like most of the\ntime it just makes me feel\nyou know like just a bit\ncan i think for a second of course yeah\ndifferent\nif someone were to tell you that they\nthink you're doing great how would you\nfeel\ni i i like that and people have and that\nmakes me feel good but ultimately\ni i i think um\na lot of the time\ni then go i'm glad that i'm doing well\nby your standards\nyou know what i mean that's what i feel\nlike i then i go but by my standards\nit's not quite enough like i feel like\nit's my standards are different\nand therefore that's really good and i\nfeel like thank god you said i'm doing\nwell but i'm still not quite satisfied\nthat's usually what it like boils down\nto\ni'm gonna go i'm gonna\nenter slo-mo for a second okay oh yeah\nthat's all good\nso\nwhen people say they're that they think\nyou're doing great do you feel like they\ndon't understand\num\nsometimes sometimes definitely depends\nwho says it there's certain people who\nhave more credibility in that claim than\nothers i would say because certain\npeople\nare in a similar position to me\nand if they say i'm doing great it's\nlike well you understand this world and\nand what we do and blah blah blah and if\nyou think i'm doing well than that that\ngenuinely means something but like\nin no way uh offends to them but like\nit's saying my parents aren't going\nyou're doing great i'm like well you\ndon't you like i'm glad you think i'm\ndoing well and that's and that's really\nnice and i'm it's lovely to hear your\nparents are proud of my stuff i was like\nyou don't understand what i'm doing\nfully you don't know this world quite\nthe way i do and\nand\nto me i don't feel like i'm doing great\nstill so what is it that they don't\nunderstand about your world\ni just i i mean just the the content\ncreation stuff i i mean i mean in quite\na literal sense of like it's just new to\nthem you know i mean they don't quite\nunderstand\nwhat makes it tick exactly and and what\nmight look good to them\nit might not exactly be exactly what it\nis you know it's it's it's expecting\nthem to understand something they've\nonly just kind of\ntried to get their heads around purely\nbecause that's their son's job you know\nwhat i mean so what do you\nwhat what makes it hard for you to feel\nlike you're doing good enough\nlike when would you be satisfied with\nyourself\nand that's what i don't know i've been\nasked that a lot and that and someone\nasked me to like kind of be like when\nwould and i'm like\ni i think i know like a lot of the time\nit's like oh well\nlet's say\ni've done well enough when i know that i\ncould\nretire for example like say i could turn\naround and go i can retire right now and\nthat's it and like not necessarily that\ni want to but i could and that's like me\ngoing well i've i've fulfilled my goals\ni've as\ni think that's the goal right with\nworking i feel like that's that's kind\nof the goal it's like you want to work\nuntil you can retire and then even if\nyou want to work beyond that at least\nyou know at any time given point you can\ngo that's my fix i'm out um and i think\npart of me always strives towards that\nthat's that's one thing in my head but\nthen what's when\nwhen when is that i don't really know\nwhere did you get that goal of being\nable to retire\ni don't know i just that in my head that\nwas always the goal of working i think\nyou\nyou work\nyou earn you earn your pay eventually\nyou have enough where you go yeah i\ndon't have to do this anymore and that's\nnot necessarily to say you stop because\ni don't like being lazy but that's at a\npoint where i can go well it doesn't\nreally because at that point if i have\nenough it doesn't matter if working\nbrings nothing and it doesn't matter if\nit brings everything because i already\nhad enough so it doesn't really matter\nat which point i feel like then maybe at\nthat point i think i can stop saying\nthis is a failure and this is\nlike a success because it doesn't really\nmatter as long as i'm\nfulfilled and like i'm enjoying it um\nright now i feel like i'd love to enjoy\nit but also it's got to be\nlike\nworthwhile that's that's the thing i i i\nlike to enjoy the things i'm doing but i\nalso want them to be worthwhile and at a\ncertain point you can go well\nwhether it's worthwhile or not stops\nmattering because i have what i need\nit's just whether it satisfies me\npersonally that's it\nthat's how i feel\nfantastic so i think jack we\nthere's a lot\nthat i think we can learn here i just\ndon't know that um i have\nthe skill\nto help you\nso i'm gonna lean on you a lot okay and\nwe may have a lot of false starts\nthat's so\nlet me ask you something so let's say\nthat you hit your target and you can\nretire okay\nand then at that point you can work and\nyou can work will be free\nbecause yeah it it could bring nothing\nor it could bring everything and it\nwould be the same to you\nright\nthat's what i like to think i i can't\nsay that i'll get there and i'll be like\nbut\nlet's say that's true because yeah so so\nlet's let's reverse it okay so let's\nlook at it this way\nwhen you fail\nwhy does the failure hurt so much\nit's because it doesn't advance you\ntowards your goal does that sort of make\nsense yeah it also to me i i'm i'm i get\nlike in these like this\nwhat if this disappears like i'm very\nattached to what i do right now i love\nit right and it's like if\nwhat if this is the beginning of the end\nthat's kind of how it always feels it's\nlike this weird like it's like the\nbeginning of the apocalypse scenario um\nwhere i'm like right well this is the\nbeginning of the end you know i see like\ni upload a youtube video it doesn't do\nvery well right well i'm falling off i'm\ngone and it's like well that's a shame i\ndidn't get to do all the things i wanted\nto you know and but it's like\nif i reach the point where i have done\nall those things or i am at that point\nthen all of a sudden doesn't matter if\nit starts declining i'm i i did what i\nneeded\ni'm with you so let me let me kind of\nput it this way like\nwhether it brings nothing or brings\neverything hurts right now\nbecause there's a big difference between\nthose right\nand so if you make a youtube video and\nit doesn't do well then that falls into\nthe brings nothing camp and it has a\nconsequence\nas a result does that make sense\nyeah yeah but what we're sort of saying\nis that once you check your boxes for\nretirement then you can make something\nand it can bring nothing and you can be\nokay with that right\nyeah okay\nso then i know it sounds kind of weird\nbut let me give you a scenario let's say\nthat you've got a hundred million\ndollars i don't know how much you need\nto retire no 100 billion dollars or 100\nmillion pounds or whatever it sounds\nenough\nin your bank account\nand then you make content for a year and\nyou're making content and it has no\nconsequences because you've got your 100\nmillion pounds in the bank account right\nand so you're making content you're\nmaking content for fun it's like some of\nit's succeeding some of it's not\nsucceeding\nand then you're okay with that because\nit doesn't matter you've got your 100\nmillion pounds\nin the bank account right\nso you can make content freely\nyou're free\nand that's what i'm really hearing is\nthat for you the goal is freedom\nfreedom from needing to worry about the\nconsequences of your actions is that\nfair yeah yeah i'd say that's it yeah so\nyou make content for another year\nbecause you're like i don't know how old\nyou are but let's say like by that point\nyou're like 24 how old are you i'm 19.\nokay great so let's say 20 million\ndollars a year for the next five years\neasy\nand then you're retiring at the age of\n24. and then for the night and then\nyou're like what am i gonna do with my\nlife you're like i don't know i'm gonna\njust make content for fun you make\ncontent for two years and it's lots of\nlots of fun and you enjoy yourself and\nyou achieve what you're shooting for\nokay these are your visions not mine\nand then\nat the on your 26th birthday you realize\nthat there's been some kind of financial\ntheft some identity fraud and someone\nhas stolen 95 million dollars from you\nnow\nand not only did they steal it they\nstole it two years ago so you've\nactually never had it\nright yeah\nwhat do you think about like do you\nthink that\nyour enjoyment\nlike if you kind of look back in time\nlike you still enjoyed yourself even\nthough you really didn't have the money\nyou just sort of believed you had the\nmoney what do you think about that\nyeah no i i feel like if someone could\nturn around now and promise me that\nit'll be fine like it doesn't matter\nthere'll be ups and downs blah blah blah\nbut like at the end you will be fine\nthis will work then yeah i stopped\nworrying again it's purely just the kind\nof like\ni find that worrying\nis not only just unpleasant generally\nbut i find that it also inhibits me from\ndoing the things i enjoy because it\ntends to to\ncause i i don't know how to describe it\njust you know let's do it just inhabits\num\nand\ni think i just\ni always yeah i just strive to be free\nof it i think that's all it is i think\nthat's that's kind of always been it\nreally\nyeah so this is the terrifying thing\nokay now this is going to be hard jack\nbecause the first\nis that\nyou being free of it has nothing to do\nwith the amount of money in your bank\naccount\nno and i kind of know that as well like\ni think yeah that was and it was an\nabstraction\ni'm with you there's more to it than\nthat but yes let's yeah right so i i\nthink that like like whether something\nbrings nothing or brings everything\nhas to do with your conception and the\nstandard at which you're trying to\nfulfill\nand i think the truly terrifying thing\nis that if you really want to be free\nfrom worry you have to learn how to\ncoast\ni think yeah\nright because once you have 100 million\ndollars in the bank account what are you\ngoing to be doing you're going to be\ncoasting\nyeah and and i think that's that's the\nthing i i think i deep down really would\nlike to coast oh yes but right now i\ncan't justify it like i can't justify\nguessing and i've never been able to\nthere's never been a point in my life\nwhere i feel like this is right now is\nthe time to come\nthat's never came and i would really\nlike for\nmyself to feel like now's the time\nand\nyeah so now i'm going to ask you is the\ntime to coast determined by something in\nhere or something out there\nin my head it's out there but i want to\nsay that perhaps it really should be in\nhere like maybe i should make that\ndecision but i feel like it's out of my\nhands to a degree sure so i'm really\nglad you said that i'm really glad you\ndidn't say the quote-unquote right and\nbs answer which is like oh like coasting\nis like it's all about like yeah you're\nin inner environment no no\nright no\nso there's a level at which you've like\nkind of got to\nbe able to live sure absolutely so so\ni'm really glad that you got an\nauthentic answer and i want to be\ncareful with that word should\nbecause i think that you're correct that\nhonestly i hate to break this to you\njack but i think that retirement is\ngoing to be a goal post that moves for\nyou\nyou're going to you're going to go a\ncertain distance and you're going to say\nit's not enough\nright and this is where like we can kind\nof go back and think a little bit about\nyour 19 now how old were you when you\nstarted streaming\n17.\nand what were your goals when you\nstarted streaming\nyeah\nnot this at all not even to do it as a\njob it was it was just to do it for fun\nand then it became a job and then it was\nlike oh well no i know what it was it\nwas doing it for fun and i was like wait\ni can leave my\ndebt like my it job that would be great\nthis is so much better than doing it and\nthen all of a sudden when this became a\njob it's like right now i've got to be\nsuccessful in this\nyou know because before it was be\nsuccessful in the i.t job but sure now\nit's flipped\nand so i think that this is i don't\nthink you need to you know detect like\nbecome internally\nenlightened right away\ni think it's okay to be attached to like\nexternal things but i think deep down\nit's gonna be tricky because what you're\ngonna have to do is things that\nthere's an overlap between\ndoing things that make you feel lazy\nand being like internally satisfied with\nwhat you do\ndoes that make sense\ni think we're gonna have to move i'm not\ngonna suggest that you become lazy but i\nthink sometimes you beat yourself up for\nthings that are probably actually okay\nyeah and and oddly enough it's almost\nlike if you want to\nthis is why it's hard i'm trying to\nthread a lot of things together so\nwhen you feel like you're not doing\nenough\nand that you beat yourself up and then\nyou fail again right you with me in that\nmindset\nthe problem is in order to let go of\nthat second failure like the debuff\nit has to be embracing the things that\nmake you feel lazy\ndoes that make sense\nyeah no i think i get what that means\nyeah so like if you want to free\nyourself from the mental burden of oh my\ngod i'm screwing up you have to move a\nlittle bit more towards like accepting\nlike what you call feeling lazy i don't\nthink it's actually laziness\nthose two things are at the opposite\nends of the spectrum\nand i think if i ask you to do that you\nwill\nkick and scream you don't want to do\nthat\nso\ni think i possibly\nno it's best for me but i don't think i\nwould naturally fall into it yeah it'd\nbe a real challenge\nyes yeah that's what i mean so i think\nyou've already figured out that this is\nlike not ideal and at the same time\nyou're gonna fight it like that's just\nthat's how that's why it's hard jack\nbecause it isn't a simple answer it's\nnot like you're doing something wrong\nand you need to do something right it's\nactually that you're doing something\nright and if you want to move forward\nyou need to start doing things that are\nwrong\nsure that's why it's hard and very few\npeople figure it out and it's like a\nstruggle for humanity\num\nwhat\nno it's the struggle for humanity line\nwas like wow that really made my problem\nbig\nwhat do you mean\noh it feels i don't know i feel like um\ni'm also um very inclined to um\nkind of see things as per i kind of\nforget that other people struggle with\nthe same things\num a lot of the time like i i think i\nhave a very like\nthey look fine they're doing fine they\ndon't have this this worry that i have\nmost likely i don't it's unrealistic but\ni feel like when you look at people\ni don't often assume so when you say\nhumanity i'm like\nthis isn't this isn't just me\nit's it's not just you what do you see\nwhen you look at other people jack\num\nit really depends i feel like i see\nthere's certain people so this is the\nthing i i i think i do compare myself\nquite a lot um\nbecause um i was always they always this\nis something that everyone always quotes\nas being like the source of a problem\nbut i'm gonna bring up this cliche of\nlike being being the kid that did well\nin school\nand what happens is uh you leave\nand all of a sudden especially in this\nsphere with it it's huge and there's so\nmany people i'm not the best at it we're\nin school i was the best in most like a\nlot of the things i did at least\ncompared to my peers so all of a sudden\nthe comparison thing wasn't a problem\nbecause if i compare myself to people\nit's like yeah i'm i'm beyond that um\nand it was like yeah i'm doing better\nthan that that's great no one can expect\nanything more of you when you're doing\nthe best that's how i felt but now i'm\nin a position where i'm not doing the\nbest there's also a part of me that is\nstriving to be the best and as much as i\nknow that isn't realistic because i'm in\na huge huge sphere of very very talented\npeople way more talented than myself um\nbut\nthere's a little part of my brain which\nis like\nlet's try and be the best at this let's\nbe the absolute best of this\num\ni lost where i was going with that\nentire time i felt like that was going\nto tie into something well no no you're\nyou're doing great man so i want to\npoint something out to you i've noticed\nsomething so this is going to be kind of\na meandering conversation okay so like\nwhat sorry but\nhave you noticed that you'll oftentimes\nmake statements about like deep down i\nknow this but this\nor on some level i feel like this but\nthis have you kind of noticed that\nwithin you there's like this war between\nlike there's not a conflict yeah yeah\ni'm very conflicted a lot who are those\ntwo people like you get the sense\nthere's two people\nin there yeah no okay yeah i think so uh\nand it's probably uh the part of me that\njust wants to like enjoy things and\npurely like purely just enjoy things\nlike that's it like that's all i want to\ndo if i'm doing something i want to do\nit for maximum enjoyment whether that's\nworking whether that's anything it's\npurely for me and there's a part of me\nthat's like\nyou you need to be able to live and you\nneed to do well and you need to succeed\nand like it's trying to balance those\ntwo but i find that the succeeding one\ntends to trump the enjoyment one\nand i don't know why but i've got this\nweird idea in my head that the success\nis more important than enjoyment\nlike i like as much as i i kind of know\nthat that shouldn't be true because i\nalso um\nif i if i was to sit down and get really\nlike philosophical and discuss like\nwhat i view life as it's like it's\nultimately all down to just making the\nmost of of whatever you whatever time\nyou have so you should enjoy it right\nbut like i also don't want to shorten\nthat time or whatever by um\nyou know being unsuccessful which in my\nhead is how it works which possibly is\nis a very big leap\nbut\nso i'm i'm gonna name the two parts of\nyou and you let me know if these fit\nso one is the part of you that knows\nwhat is true and the other one is the\npart of you that knows what should be\ntrue\noh wait hold on those that's a very like\nsubtle wording difference between the\ntwo things right so what you know to be\ntrue\nand what should be true oh okay right\nyes no totally okay yeah yeah is that\nfit yeah love it yeah yeah\nyeah hmm\nso this kind of goes back to your sense\nof self\nright\nbecause i i think you're not going to be\nable to figure out who you are when\nthese two things are so like i mean\nthat's a huge gap man what you know is\nactually true like what your actual\nexperience is what your mind tells you\nhey man moving is a waste of time\nyeah and then there's the other part of\nyou that's like like i have to move\nthough\nyeah but but the other part is like [ __ ]\nit\nyeah no i don't have time this is taking\ntime and i don't i don't want to do it\nlike yeah yeah i mean\njust i know that to be the case because\ni i've had this house since the 24th of\nseptember i've been paying for it since\nthen i moved this week because i've been\npushing it off because i've been busy\nand i've been like i don't have time to\nmove yet and it's like it you know it\nwas so stupid eventually got to the\npoint where like okay i'm being dumb i'm\nbeing like i i own a house that i'm not\nusing i should go and live in it um but\nit was like it took me nearly two months\nof like\nand i i i said it was because i was busy\nbut i think it was ultimately just\nbecause i i knew i'd do this but i'm\nlike this is a waste of time\nyeah so i think um when you get caught\nbetween what you know to be true and\nwhat should be true you feel dumb\nwhat do you think about that yeah maybe\nyeah\ndumb\nlet me think yeah wait i think that\nmight be the right that might be the\nright one but i'm just trying to think\nabout it um\nyeah\nyeah dumb\nyeah right because you said like this is\ndumb i haven't moved in\nyeah like i that felt stupid like like i\nfelt really dumb i'm like i i i could\nmove i mean i lived with my parents i\ndidn't have much stuff to move and it\nwas like just just pack it up and move\nand i didn't pack it up till the very\nday before because i booked my removal\nvan i'm like oh i have to do it now like\nthat was how i motivate myself to do it\nit was like right well i put the van so\ni have to get this stuff packed before\nit arrives i wouldn't have done it\notherwise because that's what i tried to\ndo pack it and then book the van it just\nnever happened i just wouldn't do it\nyeah\nso i i'm also noticing so i'm just going\nto kind of rephrase that again i think\nwhen you get stuck between these two\nthings\nis when you end up\nit doesn't sort of matter because like\nyou're always letting one of them down\nright if you're stuck between the two of\nthem\nor you're paralyzed and not even moving\ntowards either one\nwhich isn't the worst\nright and that's when you beat yourself\nup\nso in terms of if we want to try to\nunderstand like okay like now i almost\nfeel like i should pull out the ipad\nhere but\nso here's on a high level i'm going to\ntry to summarize because i think we've\nhit a lot of good things but i think\nthat it's kind of confusing would you\nagree\nsure yeah i'd say it's confusing so let\nme try to let's just start from the top\nokay\nso\nyou're very mentally busy because\nthere's a lot of stuff you should be\ndoing\nright and you're very success driven\nyou're very outcome oriented\nso you know what you need to do your\nto-do list is probably far beyond what\nyou're capable of but it's all important\nstuff that could get done\nand you drive towards it you also\nacknowledge that\nyou know despite the fact that you are\nsometimes hard on yourself and push\nyourself that you probably wouldn't be\nwhere you are unless you did those\nthings\nright so even though there's a part of\nyou that wants to change and wants to\nrelax and wants to coast and wants to\nenjoy being 19 years old which\ntheoretically should be the best time of\nyour life and i'm sure you were\ngenuinely having fun too i don't get the\nsense that your life is all sad and all\nlike no no no i do have fun i then just\ncome away from it like oh wow i didn't\ndo anything but i do enjoy it in the\nmoment i'm having a great time a lot so\nso that that's exactly beautifully said\nright so like in the moment you're\nenjoying so there's one thing over here\nand you're like all right let's do that\nthing and then the second you're done\nthere's that other voice\nthat's like hey\ndumbass you could have been you didn't\ndo any of the things yeah right\nand so it's almost like any time you\nreach towards happiness like this voice\ncomes in and takes it away from you\nand then like then what happens is you\nlike go towards that person right who's\nlike work jack work work son\ngrind boy\nand then you do all those kinds of\nthings and then there's some like voice\ninside you that's like hey like\nyou know like maybe this is not how i\nshould be living right now and then the\nother voice is like no no it's okay you\ncan do that when you retire we're\ngrinding for a reason i'm doing this for\nyou bro\nyeah grinding so that you can have fun\nlater\nyeah\nright and then like any time so if if\nyou go towards one side of the pole like\neither if you pick one then later the\nother will come to haunt you\nand so sometimes you're stuck between\nthe two and then you're and then like\nany time you're stuck either you don't\nchoose and then you really beat yourself\nup then everyone's on the same page\nthen everyone's like hey you're not\nhaving fun\nand\nyou're not being productive like what's\nwrong then both the sides of the polls\nare like\nwe're unified we can align over one\nthing which is that you're you should be\ndoing better\nyeah\nand then i think when you feel that way\nyou sort of feel done\ntotally yeah\nhow is that for a summary so far\ngood\nvery good yeah okay that's perfect\nso now jack what do we do about that\nany thoughts you don't i'm just curious\nyou don't have to have answers i think\nit's really hard\nyou see\nthere's a realistic part of me\nand there's like the department that\nwants to go you know what go towards the\nfun one because that's great and you're\ngoing to enjoy your life i'm 19 years\nold i got this great opportunity let's\njust enjoy it the thing is if i carry on\nif i keep just striving for enjoyment\ni'll lose it i know i will like i know\nwhat i'll do i'll go out and have fun\nand then realize like i didn't do\nanything and this is going to disappear\nbeneath my feet\num\nbut so the realistic part of me is like\nfind a balance finder balance is\nprobably the thing i should be doing but\ni'm very\ni can't i don't know i'm not very good\nat that\nyeah so what makes it hard for you to\nfind a balance\nbecause\noh that's a hard one i don't\nso i'm going to think about it or i'm\njust going to say\nfor a few minutes um\ni suppose it's kind of the idea of um\nwhich feels more important than the\nother\nand in a moment i can never really\ndecide so it's very hard for me to\nlike to balance it i basically got the\nway the thought process works in my head\nof balancing it is i i have a dilemma\nright over something i don't know say\nsay someone's inviting me out but i\ncould be getting on with one of the\nmillion things i could be doing and it's\nlike right well i'm going to sit there\nand i'm going to think i could go and do\nthat thing\nor i could do this thing and in that\nmoment\ni very i struggle a lot to go which one\nof these is the most important route to\ntake for me right now\nand sometimes i can sometimes i can go\nyou know what i've worked a lot recently\nthese are my friends tonight i should go\ndo something and sometimes like hey i'm\nreally behind\nyou know but when i'm not leaning to an\nextreme where i'm either really behind\nor i'm really ahead and i'm i'm doing\nall right when i'm kind of in that\nmiddle ground of\ni could go one way or the other i\nstruggle to make the decision\nokay\nso oddly enough that doesn't sound like\nbalance to me that sounds kind of like\ntorture\nright\nwhat is that fair to say or is that\npotentially i feel like it's it's uh is\nthat how it feels\ni don't\nthat's i think that's where the\nparalysis kicks in i don't know that's\nwhere i go\nfreeze up yeah um so\ni got an emotional reaction there i\nwasn't sure if that emotional reaction\nwas absurdity because i'm completely off\nbase or that was striking a chord\ni\ni don't know\nokay it's one of those things i don't\nthink i've ever sat back and reflected\non how i feel about that so i you said\nit and i'm like god that's quite a harsh\nword to use and i don't know whether\nit's it's quite fitting or not it was\njust a bit of like oh\ni've not had a chance to think\nso so what i'm kind of hearing is that\nlike\nso let me put it this way which feels\nmore important in the moment doesn't\nsound to me like balance it sounds like\na pendulum\nyeah\nso what i'm kind of hearing is if you if\nyou've like\nsometimes if you're extreme ends of the\npolls\nit's very easy to make a decision\nbecause you're like oh i've grinded way\ntoo hard let me swing back this way yeah\nit's so of that in that moment it's an\nobvious decision it's it's the second it\nbecomes\nnot so obvious i've never been great at\nmaking decisions full stops like that's\none thing i know about myself very\nimportant it never is a short time for\nyou because you're 19. yeah oh no i know\nbut as as of yet i've not been great at\nmaking decisions so i i didn't mean to\nbe condescending there but i think\nyou're you're doing good jack and i\nthink you got to cut yourself some slack\nbecause okay you know\nyou're\ni appreciate it but but what i what i'm\nkind of noticing is like you know you\nlike it's easy when you're at an extreme\nbecause then you can swing the pendulum\nback the other way\nbut like balance is not a pendulum in\nfact pendulum is the exact opposite of a\nbalance right it's like\nswinging back and forth like balance is\nthis if i can do this it's not going to\nbounce okay whatever\nit's very hard but yeah okay right\nand so i i think what what maybe you\nshould maybe what concerns you is that\ni'm i'm concerned that if we think about\nlike balancing this pen for example\nthe tricky thing is that let's say like\nthis is this is the work end of the pen\nand this is the leisure end of the pen\nand you're actually like kind of okay\nover here the problem is that if we like\nare not careful\nand you kind of go too far on the\nleisure side i get the sense that you\nmay be afraid that you'll like fall off\na cliff\nand so like you you're like oh i should\nlet myself coast a little bit more i\nshould let my coast a little bit more i\nshould let my coast\nmyself coast a little bit more but if i\ncoast too much it'll all come crumbling\ndown yeah and it is like\nyeah i like spot like a minor slip like\ni'll spot like the littlest thing that\nisn't doing as well as it was like say a\nweek ago and it's like whoa\nit's the beginning of the fall and i\nlike i'll you know like slide back over\nthe other way yeah so i think that the\nreason it's hard because when you're\nmoving towards balance\ni think you run away from balance\nactually\nand then you get burnt out or fed up\nand then your pendulum swing towards\nself care\nand then you do that for a day or two\nand you're like back to the grind like\ni've taken a day or two off like like\ngotta go back to it and so i get the\nsense that it's a pendulum and\nfurthermore if you want balance you've\ngotta like\ni know it's going to be scary but you\ngot to like let yourself kind of coast\nlike\ndoes that make sense\nyeah\nokay\num\nso\ni think the next thing jack that i kind\nof want to ask you is like if we want to\nunderstand so if this is the structure\nyou're torn between these two things\nsometimes it's easy to make decisions\nbut in that middle space it's really\nhard for you to make the decisions and\nthen furthermore in the middle space you\nalso engage in some amount of like\nself-blame\nfeeling stupid\nyeah yeah some yeah i'm not saying that\nit's your head is like a toxic wasteland\nof just like shame no no\ni wouldn't i wouldn't say it wasn't\neither that's fair but yeah yeah so i\njust want to make it clear i'm not pl\nimplying that but in terms of when the\ndebuff happens that gives you task\nparalysis and all these other like\nnegative manifestations i really think\nit comes from\nsomething about what we're talking about\nis that fair\nyeah okay so\nso i think if we want to understand\nwhere that comes from i'd like to ask\nyou about your past are you okay with\nthat\nokay so can you tell me a little bit\nabout where you grew up or what growing\nup was like for you\nsure um well i i just moved away from\nwhere i grew up i grew up um in in a\nslightly uh it's actually quite a big uk\ntown it's not very well connected\nthere's not much going on there so um i\ni\nhad not much going on where i was from\num parents are together um fine you know\ni i wouldn't say\nit doesn't feel like obviously of course\neveryone's childhood has an impact but i\ni couldn't say there's any big events\nwhere i'd go trust is a really big deal\nfor me and this has changed me and this\nis\ni i'd say i i i grew up\nwith my parents and um i'd say possibly\ni was uh\na bit sheltered uh\nin fact no i'd say even now like i've\njust moved and i realized i have no idea\nhow to do so many things and i'll figure\nit out because i do i'm pretty confident\nin myself but i i'm like i have no idea\nwhat i'm doing um and i'll figure it out\ni'm not worried about it but i i do\nrealize i'm\nperhaps a little bit um\nunder prepared at times\nuh and that just comes from yeah being a\nlittle bit sheltered\num\nbut otherwise\nthat's i mean if you have any specific\nquestions you're trying to target and\ni'm happy to answer them sure i don't\nhave anywhere to go so let's just\nacknowledge one or two things so often\ntimes people when we think about the\npast we think like oh like are we\nlooking for a smoking gun\nyou know was there a time where like you\nwere supposed to be like lead singer and\nyou're like seventh standard play\nand the teacher didn't like you so they\nhad some other kid do it and you like\nright you were filled with the hatred\nand resentment and you're gonna become a\nsuper villain in a in a marvel movie at\nsome point yeah like an origin story\ntime yeah yeah like it's like you know\nhitler didn't get accepted to art school\nand so that's why we have yeah exactly\nso so i think the first thing to\nunderstand is that for most human beings\nlike that's not the case like so\nsometimes people do have extreme like\nyou know trauma or whatever\nbut i still think that for example\nthe way that you look at yourself in the\nway that you navigate your internal\nenvironment\nis likely to be shaped at least in part\nby some experiences early in life things\nlike priorities your values what's okay\nand what's not okay like you know even\nif you think about coast versus grind\nwhere you are on that spectrum\noftentimes is like conditioned\nright right so i'm the the child of two\nphysicians\nand so there are like certain basic\nthings that like were baked into me in\nterms of how hard i should study what's\ninteresting what i should try to do that\nlike you know other human beings are\nlike more important than i am there are\nall kinds of stuff that's like baked\ninto me based on my upbringing it\ndoesn't have to be like traumatic but\nit's absolutely no no no of course not\nit's yeah no of course no i i i moment\nthat when you ask about my childhood\nthere's not yeah unless you're you're\nlooking for something specific i don't\nhave anything so yeah i i've got one or\ntwo things i'm really curious about any\nsiblings\nyes one uh older younger\nuh younger okay\num and then\nwell can you just tell me like what were\nthings like at home i'm not fishing for\nanything negative and i'm not going to\nmake your parents no people or anything\njust like\njust tell me what what are your parents\nlike what's it like to\nyou know they they um\nthey're very supportive in this um but\num i find that um\nthey're they're very like\nand not in a\nthis is where it's because i i've kind\nof made an effort to understand their\nmotivation in it um it's not in a\nsort of pushy sense but like they want\nme to succeed and purely just so i'm\ncomfortable and happy the same way kind\nof i want me to succeed the reason is\nvery similar but i i feel like they also\nwill be like like when i when i was at\nhome\num\ni would\ni i would be reminding myself of the\nthings i had to do and they would as\nwell like they would be like hey you\nstill have to do this thing like i i no\nif i was trying to relax i often found\nthat someone would be like if i made\nthat conscious decision that i yeah i've\nchosen like i'm just going to enjoy\nmyself for a bit\nwhat it could it could be disrupted by\nthe hey you have this thing to do and\nit's like yeah and often i'd get annoyed\nand they couldn't really figure out why\nit's like yeah it's the reason is\nbecause i'm aware of that i know i have\nthat thing to do\ni've already got i'm already fighting\noff my own\nhey you gotta do this thing to have you\ncome in and then go you gotta it's like\nthat like now it's too much and now i'm\nannoyed um what what yeah go ahead\nuh so that was i think that's something\nthat um\nthat's something that possibly\ncauses me to work a bit more as well\nbecause it's like if i manage to finally\nreconcile it with myself the second\nsomeone else comes along especially\nsomeone like i feel with like parents\nthis is me um probably most people as\nwell but i\ni'm very\neven if i know it's not true i will take\ntheir word as almost gospel even if i\nknow that that shouldn't be done because\ni know that they don't always know the\nbest in my head i i can't shake the i'm\njust gonna listen to what they say\nbecause they're my parents and and i've\ngot this relationship with trust um\nso you know even though logically i'm\nquite aware that that why would they\nknow\nabout that thing like why you know i'm\nlike yep they've told me to do that\nthing that's that's the thing you know\num\nso i just want to point out once again\nthat there there's that thing again\nlike there's the part of you that knows\nthat\nyou don't really need to listen to them\nand then there's the con like like i'm\njust hearing this like this is the big\nthing jack every time i ask you a\nquestion there's always an two sides to\nthe answer\nyeah\nyeah yeah and i suspect that much of\nyour lack of peace\ncomes from the moment that those two\nsides become like uniform you will be at\npeace\nyeah that that would be if that ever\nhappens that would be great i can't i'm\ntrying to think of a time where they\nhave been and i'm like\ni'm not sure it's happened but\nyeah we'll get there so and i think that\nlike you know you'll know who you are\nwhen that happens\nbecause that's one thing i thought about\ni that's another thing when i was\nthinking about that i feel like a lot of\nthe time i've been following the\ninstruction of\nin a way my parents because of what i\nwas saying and then also just kind of\nthis voice i've just been following what\nit tells me to do in teachers and things\nlike that i very i\ni'm very black and white i when people\ntell me things i take them very\nliterally and i kind of fulfill them\nto a very accurate degree and and i\nfound that that\nmeans that\ni'm\ni i feel i feel like um\nlike someone who's really great at\ntaking instructions that's what i feel\nlike that's me i'm really good at if you\ntell me to do something doing that thing\nwell but i gotta be told to do it like\neven with content creation i've you know\ni mean this is normal but still i've\nsought advice from plenty of other\npeople and just kind of done what they\nsaid and that's how i got here because i\ndid i i i'll give myself credit and say\ni did what they told me well but\ni only felt confident because other\npeople told me to do what i was doing\nit's very rare that i will just kind of\nsit down formulate a plan by myself and\nyou know it happens\nhow does it feel to do well at something\nthat someone tells you to do\ni mean same as it does do well on\nanything i feel like doing well is is\nfulfilling i don't think because someone\nelse told me to do it it's i\nsomeone else telling me to do it gives\nme that layer of confidence that um it's\noh no no let me think about how to word\nthat um\nthis is the when i used to work a job\nright when i used to work like a nine to\nfive um my only goal in that job\nessentially is to\n[Music]\nlike do what the boss tells me to do\nto a level of satisfaction that they're\nhappy with that's it that's all i have\nto do it's a very simple role\nand all of a sudden now i'm my boss\nand\ni find it very hard to go jack what\nshould i do\nand jack like like because the thing is\ni'm biased towards my own enjoyment\nuh i'm biased to go hey like hey jack\nwhat should i do today hey jack go put\nyour feet up sit down watch tv like you\nknow where my boss wouldn't do that they\nthey would keep me at a level of\nproductivity that is necessary but when\ni leave that nine to five job i go home\ni do what i want\nthat like that was the structure that\nkind of as much as i didn't enjoy the\njob i didn't find like that fulfilling i\nkind of liked the structure of i go in i\ndo what i'm told from nine to five and i\nknow i've done enough for that day i go\nhome i do what i want that kind of\ndistinction\nworked for me because it wasn't in my\ncontrol\nokay so jack this is where things are\ngonna get weird because you've just told\nme what your internal experience is like\nand so theoretically the statement that\nyou just made is the one that i should\nrespect and listen to the most\nand yet it is the one that i'm going to\ndisagree with you with ah\nwhich one was that which one was that so\nyou said that you're biased towards your\nown enjoyment so you don't know what to\ndo it was easy when you had some someone\ntelling you what to do because you could\njust set aside your own enjoyment and\nfulfill their expectations\nif anything i think this is like the\nthing i disagree with the most strongly\nyes okay i get what you're saying i\nthink but the thing is this is where i i\nknow where you're coming from and i'm\ngoing to explain how i think it works\nsure and that is please i am biased\ntowards my own enjoyment therefore\nknowing i'm biased towards my own\nenjoyment i do the exact opposite where\ni i kind of go no you're being biased\nyou shouldn't do that and then you do\nyou know what i mean like i know i was\nfound naturally yes yeah no naturally i\nam biased\nover compensate\nbut yes if we really think about it\nthat over compensation\nis driven by the non-enjoyment side\nyeah\nso i would even argue that the master\ncontroller up here is not your enjoyment\nit is the fear\nthat you are biased towards your own\nenjoyment that causes you to\novercompensate on the other side and\ngrind even twice as hard\nsure\nso what's in control there it's not the\nenjoyment\nno no no no it's it's no it's not it's\nnot\ni i yeah i kind of know that i think\nit's just i think jack because i'm\nhow do you feel about that\ni mean\nnot all that shocked because i think i i\nprobably did know that um but i think\nit's like\nyeah you make a good point of because i\nbecause i do feel like that it's like\nwell\ni feel like i i would unchecked by\nmyself which is a very weird thing to\nsay but if i was unchecked by myself i\nwould go off the reins and and just do\nwhat i want to enjoy so therefore\nbecause i'm fit know that i'm like that\nwhich i'm technically not because i\nstopped myself but because i feel like\ni'm like that somewhere\ni do the exact opposite which is a very\ni'm glad that you're nodding your head\nbecause that feels like a complicated\nsystem to explain but yeah you seem to\nget it so it is the fear\nof letting your unchecked degenerate\njack self\ngo completely wild that causes you to\nactually tighten the reins\nand i think this is why you actually\nlike you said it's easy when you've got\nsomeone else to please because in a\nbizarre way when you've got someone else\nto please like if you have to please\nyour parents you know they're gonna\nwatch out for enjoyment jack\nyou know that they may come and remind\nyou a little bit\nbut like at the end of the day like it's\nkind of out of your hands\nwhereas it's much more terrifying to\nlike hold that balance yourself\nyeah i'm responsible i'm responsible for\nif i don't do enough\nwhere before like in schools and blah\nblah blah it's like someone else was\ntelling me how much to do and i just\nhave to do that amount before enjoyment\nme can go right we've done what we need\nto do let's let's do that now it's like\ni have no idea how much i'm supposed to\ndo i'm just\nah\nthat you know it's overwhelming yeah\ncause because now like um so jack you\nsaid you were a good student right\nyeah yeah you got a's\nuh yeah yeah are you getting a's now\nuh\nuh i mean\nthis is the thing with what we do right\nit's really relative\nso am i getting a's i don't really know\ni mean i i can't categorize it i'm do it\ni mean i've got numbers that say these\nare good numbers but there's people with\nbetter numbers there's also people with\nworse numbers it's\nnowadays it was as high as it went now\nit's like\nthe sky's the limit with this\nand that's almost worse how are you\nsupposed to know when you can relax if\nyou don't have a's\nexactly that that's that's a lot of what\ni feel like yeah\nright it's terrifying\nit sounds to me like an unsolvable\nproblem\nbecause you can never\nget an a\nin twitch streaming there's no official\nauthority that says\ngood job jack you were at the top of\nyour class\nyeah the the only thing that would be\nthat is if they ranked them all and i\nwas number one that's the only way i go\ni've done enough and i know that like i\nknow deep that as much as that's so\nunrealistic and it's not like it's not\nsome like sick like here's something i\nknow that's right here it is again no of\ncourse um and it's not i'm not trying to\nargue that i've got like some like weird\nlike ego like i must be the best because\ni am the best it's not that it's it's\nif i'm the best then i can't i i don't\nhave to work any harder because i've\nworked\nas hard as anyone else on earth no one\nelse is doing better than me i've done\nenough no one can tell me i'm not doing\nenough i'm i've\nthat i'm there but whenever i'm not at\nthe very very top then there's always in\nmy mind someone who's doing more than me\nand and then i'm like well\nyeah does that allow\ni i i completely i so i want to just\necho that i don't think it's ego at all\nand i don't think you're upset that\nsomeone else is doing more than you what\ni think it really is\nis if someone else is doing more than\nyou then you know that you could be\ndoing more\nyes\nright so even like you just you and this\ncomes back to retirement it's like why\nis retirement your target i think\nretirement is like\ncognitively or emotionally the same\nthing as being at the top of your class\nbecause then you've made it checkbox\ni've done enough\nit's always about have i done enough\nhave i done everything that can be done\nyeah and it feels to me like these two\nare the same yeah i i'd agree yeah those\nthose two things are kind of the the two\nfulfillment criteria\nand the reason i mentioned retirement is\nbecause the more realistic of the two\nyou know i'm with you i'm with you\nyeah i think they're both like so do you\nsee how there's like a\nshared emotional need i'm gonna call it\nemotional let's just step away from that\nword actually there's a shared need\nbetween those two goal goals that allows\nyou to relax it's like i'm not allowed\nto relax until i have achieved certain\nthings\nokay yeah so now i have to figure out\nhow am i going to help you with this\ndo you have any ideas ooh um i the the\nthe one thing that people have always\ntried to tell me is is kind of be\nsatisfied in little goals like like set\nlittle goals and be satisfied by\nachieving those but it just it just\ndoesn't work\nyeah it doesn't work because what\nhappens is\nbecause i've done it and then what\nhappens is i i finished one going like\ncool onto the next one like it's just a\nchecklist at that point it's it's all it\ndoes is what you're you're providing me\nwith is steps between the final one but\nultimately i'm still striving for the\nsame thing i'm with you because i think\nthat the the issue here is you've got to\nlet go of your goal which i think you're\ngoing to\nso\ni mean\ni know i kind of know where you need to\ngo jack i just think it's going to be\ntough\nso\nor i have an idea so let me ask you this\nlike um\nlet me just think is there some other\nway that we can get to this\nwhat was it like being in school\num\nso it came easy to me for a long time\nso it was actually really great because\nwhat had happened was i could get to the\ntop with very little work and actually\nhave a lot of enjoyment time\nwas\nmost of school and then it got to like\nthe last\nyear or two and then it became oh i've\nactually got to work to be at the top\nbecause it's now like difficult i'm i'm\ni'm in big boy school and uh all of a\nsudden there's now less time to enjoy\nmyself\nand\nnaturally i enjoy it less and i'm i'm\nnot having fun because i wouldn't let\nmyself slip from that top position to\ncompensate for not you know it's like\nwhat i could have done is carried on\nhaving the same level of fun and done\nworse in school but like hey i enjoy my\nmy time and i still did fine or do i did\nwhich is\nwell i want to carry on getting the the\na's that i was getting i'll work harder\nbut i hated it\ni didn't enjoy it because i didn't find\nit to be particularly fulfilling work it\nwas just\nthe goal was fulfilling but the actual\nwork itself was tedious\nokay i'm gonna just toss out some words\nconnect some dots you let me know if it\nresonates and i think we may have a way\nforward here so first of all i think\nyou're mentally busy in your sense of\nself this is all related and here's how\ni understand it\nso like\nyou've got two warning voices\nright and in the past those voices have\nbeen\nyou never had to resolve the conflict\nbetween like\nwhite and black\nbecause\nthere was an external measure which\ncould satisfy both sides like once\nyou're at the top of your class you\ndon't like you were trying to figure out\nokay do i need to study today or do i\nnot need to study today and you never\nhad to resolve the internal conflict\nbecause you relied on an external thing\nto tell you what to do\nyes with me yeah so as you have\ntransitioned from i school to i.t to\ntwitch streaming\nthe external influences that can resolve\nthat external conflict for you are no\nlonger there\nas a result you were left with the\ninternal conflict and you just simply\nhaven't learned because you haven't\nneeded to and this is the other thing\njack that's kind of surprising is a lot\nof people sort of never need to right\nbecause they they move into\nwork structures yeah without doing this\ni would never have had to myself i would\nhave carried on doing what i was doing\nyou would have gone for promotion and\nthen you would have gone for promotion\nand then you would have like there's\nalways a step ladder that some\ncorporation or school or something else\ncould objectively rank you at and you\nwould have been a very successful very\ndriven very content kind of person\nlike in a weird way is that yeah\nunderstandable yeah no i i agree yeah so\nnow the tricky thing is that without\nsome kind of external grading system\nto let you relax\nyou are struggling with this idea of\nhow do i relax when is it okay to relax\nand that in turn becomes even more\nproblematic because like there's always\nsomething you can do right like as a\nstreamer like you can always like check\nyour socials more you can always\nmicromanage your the thumbnails for your\nyoutube videos you can always be dming\npeople to set up potential collabs you\ncan always upgrade your hardware and\ntalk to someone else about a partnership\nor\nyou know a merch launcher like there's\nalways something you could be doing\nso given an endless pile of tasks to do\nand given a\ncomplete absence of a grading system to\ntell you it's okay to relax\nyou don't know how to relax\nand so you end up with this kind of\nthing where you grind grind grind grind\ngrind and even like in your deepest\nparts of yourself you're like this is\nabsurd this is enough i deserve to relax\nand then you kind of swing that way but\nthen like what happens is you become\nmentally busy as you're sitting there\nhanging out by the beach with your\nfriends y'all are chilling\nthe first 24 hours you're like totally\nfine\n36 hours you're like hey maybe i should\nlet me check discord\nand get back to one or two emails like\nwhatever you use twitter dms or\ninstagram whatever i don't know and the\nthoughts start creeping in creeping in\ncreeping and creeping and creeping in\nand then you're like oh i've relaxed too\nmuch like let me start\nworking again or even somewhere in the\nmiddle there it's like two days in you\nstart to get conflicted because you're\nlike oh like i was gonna take a long\nweekend with my friends but then you're\nlike that not paralysis but almost your\nparents come into the room and be like\nhey\nyou should be studying\nand you're like no i set aside these 72\nhours for me to relax and i'm going to\ntake care of it on monday but then like\nthat voice kind of creeps in it's like\nhey\ndid you forget you're like no no i\ndidn't forget like it's accounted for\nand over time like this it's almost like\nan anxiety kind of builds up and then\nother things start to pile on it's like\noh my god like if i i know i took 72\nhours for a vacation but like i'm gonna\nmiss out on this opportunity and then\nlike this thing could happen and then\nlike i should be doing this and like the\nanxieties kind of grow and eventually i\nthink a fear sets in\nthat since i don't know when to relax i\nhave to grind and grind and grind\nbecause if i don't do it now\nit could come falling apart\nand i don't know where i'm going to be i\ndon't know that i'll be able to retire\ni'll be able to relax once i'm dead\nright it's kind of like this i like this\nkind of pressure of like okay like once\ni hit that point then i can sort of\nrelax\nand what i'm i'm sort of hearing is that\nfear sets in at some point\nfear of consequences fear of missed\nopportunities fear of not doing enough\nand then like also social media and\nstuff is kind of\nkind of adding on kind of saying oh like\ndid you see what that person is doing\nmaybe i should be doing that too yeah\nyeah\nright so all those kind of thoughts set\nin and at the end of the day like you're\nkind of where you are which is like very\nsuccessful\nvery grateful i i get a lot of genuine\ngratitude i don't get the sense that you\nblame anyone i don't get the sense that\nyou're egotistical but internally i do\nget the sense of some amount of like you\ndon't really know who you are\nand you don't know exactly\nhow long this is there's just a lot of\nunknowns and uncertainty\nyeah no yeah exactly yeah\nand so\nyeah\nanything that i got wrong or anything\nthat you want to add or anything you\nthink we're missing is that you no i i\nfeel like yeah that's a there's a pretty\ngood summary there's one thing i suppose\nthat i might add just there's always\nthis part of me as well that as i'm\ntelling you this is like i hope i'm not\ntelling you\nwho i think i am and not why why i'm not\nsorry\nand not what i\nlike\nmy words i'm just stumbling a bit yeah\num\ni like i don't want to be telling you\nall this because there's also a part of\nme that is when i'm telling you all this\nis like is this who i am or is this who\ni think i am and actually i'm there's\nlittle parts of me that are just just\naltering things like\nam i really conflicted or am i really\njust lazy there's that little voice\nthat's like you know what i mean like\nlike there's that part of me that's like\ni'm telling you all this and that's\ngreat and if this is the case then like\nyou know i feel less lazy because this\ndoesn't sound like a lazy person what\nyou're describing i'm like but am i\npicking my words carefully to deceit to\ndeceive you\nbecause then you won't look at me as\nlazy because that's also a thing i would\nhate that jack so here's the key thing\nthis is gonna be hard okay so by the way\nyou're doing fantastic\nwe are sort of at the barrier of like\nsome very abstract weird mental stuff\nthat's hard to pin down\ncool so i want you to think about your\nthought just now\ni'm gonna ask you a question that i'm 99\nsure you're not going to be able to\nanswer but i want you to just try anyway\nwhere does that thought come from\nwhere's the origin of that\noh this sounds real but\nwhat if i'm just lazy and i'm just\nmaking i'm tricking this guy\nto seem like it's okay that i'm doing\nthis\nbut\ni'm just lazy like where is that thought\ncoming from\nuh\nso\ni\nit's so one thing that makes me feel\nbetter is like you said earlier when\npeople tell me\nlike like that ex you right now almost\nan external factor that's telling me i'm\ndoing enough almost like right now\nthat's what you're kind of fulfilling\nand\nthat makes me feel better\nbut what i can do as a person who can\nbecause ultimately you only know what i\ntell you so what i can do is manipulate\nmy words cleverly enough to make you\nbelieve i'm doing enough because then\nyou tell me i'm doing enough and i can\nrelax it's like in school right i i did\nthis couple of times in school where i\ngenuinely was\nlike it's like hey did you do that\nhomework no i i i didn't get time i'll\ndo it tomorrow really i just forgot but\ni'm making them look like i wasn't being\nlazy about it and making them feel like\ni'm giving them some excuse that seems a\nbit more reasonable um and it just it\njust it people pass less judgment\nyou know you don't whatever\nand\ni think i'm losing my train of thought\nhere so i'm going to try and get myself\njust keep going it's like\nit's that comes from the part of me that\nis like\nscared that\nwhat i'm doing is i'm\nso when you turn around and it's like\nyou're not lazy blah blah\nthere's a part of me that's like\ndoubting that and going no he's not\nlying to you like i don't think you're\nlying to me but what i think is that i\nhave manipulated what i've said in a way\nto make you say that because that's what\ni wanted to hear and therefore\ni'm still actually lazy i've just made\nyou affirm me so i feel better\nand that there's a fear of that\nhappening and that's i think where i\ndon't know if necessary that answers the\nquestions where does that thought come\nfrom but that explains the process very\ngood so\ni don't know if you've noticed this jack\nbut i've not told you that i think\nyou're doing enough\nhave you noticed that no you've not said\nthose words exactly yeah why don't you\nthink i've said this i i know i know\nuh\ni don't know i can tell you why you\nhaven't what would you feel if i told\nyou jack i think you're doing a\nfantastic job i think you are doing\nenough what would happen that's great\nthat's great that's great and then\nthere's a little part of me that goes\nwe're having this discussion naturally\nof course so this is this is what's\nhappening right so if i say jack i think\nyou're bro you're young give yourself\ntime\nyou'll get there\nhave some faith in yourself how would\nyou respond to that forgive my sarcastic\ntone\nbut like i i'd be like\nit's nice and and it would allow me for\nfor a period to go\nyeah maybe i should\nbut then what would happen is that but\nthe thing that so you've you're\naffirming me that i should relax and\nwhat happened is are there a stream that\ndoesn't do great or but i'll sit down or\nsomething just like something is down\nand then that affirms me in the opposite\ndirection\ndr k was wrong you aren't doing enough\nbecause here's a number that says so\nbeautiful right so here's the thing it\ncomes back to the war between the two\nthere's the\nthere's the content you\nand the grind you and there's a way of\naffirming both and that's awesome and so\nif i say that you're gonna do enough if\ni say\njack you're so like you've come so far\nfor your age man\nyou're such an awesome like you've come\nso far like so much to be grateful for\nyou deserve to relax bro you're 19. have\nhave the time of your life dude\ngo out you shouldn't be grinding you can\ngrind when you're 29. i could say all\nthose things and there'd be a part of\nyou that would listen right because\nremember there's two parts of you and\nthen that other part of you would be\nlike no it's not enough\nright this guy doesn't understand\nit'll start saying these kinds of things\nright because he's not like i'm not\nactually like a streamer your mind will\ngenerate all kinds of ideas\nto devalue what i say so i've tried\nreally hard to not engage with that part\nand despite the fact that i've never\ntold you i think you're doing enough\ni've never told you i think you're doing\na good job\nsomehow you are feeling more relaxed you\nare feeling like oh i am actually doing\na good job this is okay this is okay\nthis is the signal that i'm sending you\nsubconsciously and you are receiving it\nand the moment that i send you that\nsignal and you start to really receive\nit\nthat little thing is like i'm tricking\nhim\nbecause if your mind convinces you that\nyou're tricking me then it invalidates\neverything that i've tried to say so\ni've tried to be a subtle [ __ ] because\ni'm talking to you\nand i'm talking to that other part of\nyou and i'm trying to trick it\nand now i've tricked you\nbut it is not buying my bs it detects\nwhat i'm doing and starts to doubt and\nstarts to warn you it's a warning\nbecause oh my god jack what would happen\nif i made you feel like you're doing\nokay\nyeah i i i could stop doing as much\nand then and then all this will\ndisappear yeah exactly right and that's\nthat part of you\nso here's the thing jack why do you\nbelieve that at the core of it\nwhat i'm getting is that there's a part\nof you that believes very strong i know\nthis may be a stretch\nbut if you are tr\nlet me\nthis is gonna be hard for me but let me\ntry so if there's a part of you that\ntricks p so\ntwo options right one is you're being\nauthentic right now and you're not\nactually lazy and i'm sort of like\nyou're i'm i'm authentically reading you\nand i'm authentically responding to you\nand this is truth you with it yeah\nsure\nand then there's another part of you\nthat's like you're tricking me\nand that invalidates my support of you\nbecause i'm being tricked\nbut\nif you're tricking me\nthat means\nthat there's a part of you that\ngenuinely believes like you're lazy does\nthat make sense\nbecause the only way you could trick me\ninto believing you're not lazy\nis like\nit\ndoes that make sense it's like it has to\ncome from a belief\nyes it does\nyeah so where does that come from\nlike why do you believe you're lazy\nwhy are you afraid you're lazy maybe\nthat's a better question\nafraid i'm afraid of it because i\ni don't know i i feel like\nand that's maybe one thing that's been\ninstilled in me through school parents\neveryone has kind of instilled in me\nthat i shouldn't be so i think that's\nmaybe just like kind of it's one of\nthose like seven deadly stints that's\nlike like in my brain it's like\nyou know that should not be lazy it's\njust in my head you know what i mean\nyeah sure so i'm gonna ask you a\nquestion jack\nwhen did you when did the installation\nof the fear that you were lazy like when\nwas the how is there how old were you\nwhen you started being worried that you\nmight be lazy\n[Music]\nprobably at the point where it began to\nmatter so that would be when i felt like\ni had to start working which was towards\nthe end of school like the the point at\nwhich i felt that like doing well\nrequired work\nbecause what happened was um i wasn't\nparticularly used to working on things\nand i hated it i was like whoa i'm\nhaving to work way more this sucks and\nthat made me go god i'm a lazy person\nbecause i hate work and i don't think it\nnecessarily is that it was more that\nyou know i'm enjoying myself less\nnaturally i'm not gonna and of course\ni'm not gonna like enjoy myself\nhow humans are um\nyou know does a story come to mind like\na particular moment or time when you\nrealize that you're gonna have to start\nworking\nnot exactly just just\nwhen i started um\nsixth form which i don't uk schooling\nit's like the last sort of how is the\nlast oh uni i would oh how old would i\nbe 16\ni'd be like 16 or 17 at that point\nprobably 16. is there anything you can\nshare with me in terms of like concrete\nstuff about moments or like just what it\nwas like being 16 and sort of realizing\nyou can't afford to be lazy anymore\nuh\nthis sixth form is one of these ones\nwhere like\ni didn't realize how much i hated it\nuntil i left and i think i genuinely\nhave suppressed a lot of it because i\ndon't remember it very well which is\nstrange for how recent it is but i it's\nall one big blur of just not enjoying\nmyself and hoping to get through it um\nand i don't remember there's moments\nwhere i did enjoy myself but like\noverall just the whole experience i\nfound stressful um but\ncan you just tell me about that\nexperience what comes to mind\ni just i remember just\nbeing unhappy with it like just being\nlike i hate this i can't wait to leave\nand don't get me wrong i had good\nfriends and the social elements were\ngreat\nwhen they were\nthings i could focus on but half of the\ntime i couldn't so i just felt like\nwow this i don't enjoy this i\nthis isn't great you know it was just a\nperiod that but and i considered leaving\na lot\num\ni never did\num\ni i'm not even 100 convinced that i\nwouldn't have done covid kicked us out\nearly and i'm not convinced that i would\nhave made it to the very very end i was\ngetting really getting the end of my\ntether by the end of it\num but but they kicked us out early and\nand that and\nthey kind of\nwe didn't take exams i don't know if you\nheard much about like what happened in\nthe uk with that but they just kind of\nwent hey you know it's not safe to get\nall these kids in exam rooms we're just\ngoing to work out your grades from the\nwork you've done over the past two years\nand\nyou're done have fun\nlike you've done what you can we're just\ngoing to use everything we've got up\nuntil now um so they kicked us out early\num\nand i was like oh wow okay\nguess i'm guess i'm done\nhow did you feel about that\nuh a little bit worried because\nobviously i hadn't treated\nso\nthere's two parts of me there's like a\nlittle part of you that's worried\nbecause there was no warning to that\nthere was no like hey\ni mean they say this throughout school\nbut you never really believe it because\nit's like hey in the scenario that on\nthe way to an exam you get run over by\ncar and break your legs or use your\nprevious work but like what's the\nchances right and then all of a sudden\nthat thing actually happens was like hey\nwe're actually using your stuff and\nyou're like\nwell i didn't treat this like it was\ngoing to be the thing that design\ndecides what grades i get in the end\nlike that's a little bit stressful but i\nalso knew that these things have been\ngraded throughout school and i was doing\nwell so i was like ultimately\ni should be fine there's no reason i\nshouldn't get a's i've been getting a's\npretty much throughout this i i should\nbe fine uh at which point i went okay\nguess i gotta wait till august it's\nmarch\nlike and that was it i was done like and\ni didn't go get a job i'm like well i\nwas like well i had you know i worked um\nthrough my summers uh so i was like ah i\ni got money i don't need a job i'm just\ngonna\nenjoy it because\ni mean i you know when's the world gonna\nbe like this again\nyes\nso you were um\nin school and you were hating it right\nis that right you were in school and you\nwere hating it right towards that end\npart yeah definitely\nthere was a chance that if covert didn't\nhappen you wouldn't have finished school\nso\nthat's the thing would i have probably\nprobably not i i really felt like i was\ngetting to that point and a friend of\nmine dropped and then i was like whoa\nokay that kind of\nbecause i constantly thought about it\nconstantly\nand i but i cannot say i would have ever\ndone it\nbecause i would you i don't\nhow would you have felt about yourself\nif you did do it\ni don't know uh depends what i went on\nto do afterwards i think\nit would i think i would have had to\nwait till the consequence\nif it was a if there was an extra if or\ni say extremely negative consequence if\ni perceived it to be an extremely\nnegative consequence uh then i would\nhave beat myself up about it uh and if i\ngot on fine\ni wouldn't i suppose i wouldn't have\ncared um\nyeah it's like i dropped out of uni to\ndo this right but that made sense i was\ndoing well in this and like so the\nconsequences are good so all of a sudden\nit's like great you know like i made the\nright decision and i i never think back\non that like that is not something i\nthink back on and if a scenario like\nthat would have happened where i found\nsomething that was amazing then great\nbut if it didn't then yeah i would have\nbeen pretty annoyed\nso this is where um\ni'm gonna say something that\nmay be a bit judgmental and is\nit's more of a hypothesis than a\nconclusion\nbut\ni get the sense like something just\nclicked for me so like i think that\nwhat's really confused me this entire\ntime jack is like where you get the idea\nthat you're lazy\nessentially why don't you have faith in\nyourself\nbecause the tricky thing is why do you\nneed like external things to reassure\nyou you need external things\nfundamentally if anyone out there is\nlike listening\nwe need external things when we don't\nbelieve in ourselves right if i doubt my\nintelligence and i get an a i feel\nreassurance from the external world\nso reassurance from the external world\nreally only like exists when i have\ninsecurity\ndoes that make sense\nso the thing that's been really\nconfusing about this whole conversation\nis i've been trying to understand like\ni've thought from kind of early on that\nthere's something you know why are you\nafraid of coasting why are you afraid of\nbeing lazy you know it sounds like you\ncan really enjoy things and logically\nyou understand that like you're still\ndoing well and stuff like that but at\nthe root of this i'm getting i'm getting\nthis sense like even when we talked\nabout the conflict i'm being dumb\nthat's like that sort of thought that\nyou have where does that come from where\ndid your mind learn\nthat you're dumb because it sounds like\nyou did well in school sounds like\nyou're pretty successful sounds like\nyou're pretty driven i was really\nconfused about there's some like there's\nthis like nugget of something which\nfeels incompetent to me within you\nthat you believe about yourself and so\nyou look for these big external things\nlike if i'm the number one twitch\nstreamer i retire or things like that\nthen you'll have such a blanket\nreassurance that that thing won't have a\nleg to stand on\nand i've seen that thing manifest in\nyour words like over and over and over\nagain it manifests i want you to go back\nand watch this and just listen to the\nnumber of times you say but\nyou'll say something that's like really\nlogical and then you'll be like but and\neven the most extreme manifestation\nwhich like i've tried really hard to not\nbe encouraging or reassuring to you\nbecause i had a feeling that the second\ni say jack i think you're doing a great\njob that thing would have popped up\nand even despite the fact that like i\ndidn't say it to you a single time i've\nbeen sending you like positive\nreassuring vibes it still\npopped up and it said\nyeah hey\nyou're tricking him\nhe doesn't really know who you are\nand then it's like wait but what does\nthat part of you believe about you right\nwhy does it think if if you're if you're\ntricking me into believing that you're a\ndecent good hard-working human being\nthe only reason your mind would think\nthat that's a trick is if it believed\nthe opposite does that make sense\nso that word trick is very important\nbecause it gives us a clue\nto what you believe about yourself and\nthis also is not it's not like all of\nyou believes this it's just like a doubt\nthat's lingering it's a yeah yeah it's\nthere yeah totally yeah yeah and and i i\nthink that for me what just clicked is\nlike i believe that despite all your\nsuccess\ndespite how good you are at grinding\ndespite all of your parental support\ndespite all of the faith that you do\nhave in yourself you know that you're\ncapable\nyou could have dropped out of school\nyeah\nand there's this part of like the and i\nwonder if this is sort of it and this\nsomething i leave you with a hypothesis\nas opposed to a conclusion because i\ndon't really know we'd have to have\nanother two hour conversation but\nwhat i'm really hearing is like despite\neverything that you have be proud of\njust think about how terrifying that is\nfor you to like be so smart and be so\nhardworking and be able to grind and\nstill essentially wash out\nlike that would be such a blow to like\nwhat you're capable of in this life does\nthat make sense\nit's like if you can wash out a school\ndespite all the stuff that you're good\nat like\nyou know if the tedium gets too much for\nyou to handle i don't think it's about\nintelligence i think it's about laziness\nbecause what would you tell yourself if\nyou dropped out of school\nlike\nyou're [ __ ] lazy\nyou could have done it you just couldn't\ncut it\nand i may be like making things a little\nbit extreme and i'm kind of doing that\non purpose because i don't really know\nif this is connected for you it may not\nconnect it may just i just may be wrong\nhere yeah\nyeah\nbut this whole time like of all of the\nthings that really surprised me jack out\nof everything you've said it's the idea\nthat you could have dropped out of\nschool\nright you describe yourself as a good\nstudent you're a hard worker you try\nreally hard like you're like easy to set\ntargets just like if this person says do\nthis i'm gonna be like the best employee\ni can it's simple there's one thing that\nhas happened which is run contrary to\neverything that you've said and that's\nyou could have failed out dropped out or\nbeen unable to do school\nand so something tells me i wonder if\nlike sort of that core of doubt this\nsort of idea that i am lazy this fear\nthat you could wind up lazy because now\nwhat's happening is you got saved do you\nget that\nit was like you were losing this game\nand then like your your opponent in the\ngrand finals dc'd\nright because covid happened\nand so like you dodged a bullet you\nnever got tested\nyou didn't know\nlike sure like logically you're like oh\nyeah like i may have i probably would\nhave been fine but there's some part of\nyou that i wonder if you like you got\nsaved like do you feel that way\ni don't know i i really i struggled\nbecause i honestly i've there's plenty\nof times where i feel like quitting a\nlot of things and i never do it\nso\nyou know but that was like i used to say\nthat\nbasically every week i'm like i'm not\nsure if i can do this i i really hated\nit i'm not quite sure what about it i\nreally really hated um there i think\nthere's a few elements and i think per\nthere's just a part of me that there's i\ndon't think i was in my mentally\nsoundest place at that point and that\nwas there was a lot of added stress\nanyway um so i feel like\nit was more of a mental sort of like i\ndon't know if i can deal with the stress\nof this\nsort of thing um and so what is someone\nwho can't deal with the mental stress of\nit what would you call that person\nuh\nyou see my brain's saying weak but that\nfeels harsh um i i feel like that's not\nnecessarily like i feel like there it is\nagain that's harsh but you see that you\nsee the two sides yeah your brain comes\nup with an answer and i think that's how\nyou would have felt\nright\nand i don't think you could convince me\notherwise that like if you would have\nfelt weak\nlike sure there's constantly told myself\nthat i wasn't i would have been like no\nit's reasonable that you did i would\nhave done the logic thing but then deep\ndown no i think exactly right that's the\nthing because i think logically you're\ndoing a good job\nbut i think deep down and that's where\nlike so i think going forward you know\nhere's my advice for you for lack of a\nbetter term the first is to like notice\nthe butts\nso like just notice that sometimes\nyou're conflicted second thing is notice\nthat like neither side is stupid\ni think like you don't need don't force\nyourself to change yet i just want you\nto like\nlike digest this conversation and just\nlike think about what we've talked about\nand notice the manifestations of these\nthings is there a part of you that\nreally feels like you know unless you do\nthis like it is all going to come\ncrumbling apart\nare you basically like\nthe grind is the grind to overcome like\nand this is going to sound harsh the\nfundamental weakness that exists within\nyou\nyeah probably like that that sounds\nabout right i'd say yeah i mean like\nyeah i'm very\ni'm really afraid of like this falling\napart because i don't know what i'd do\nwithout it i don't know if i could pick\nmyself back up and just\nget on i i i don't know what i do like i\nreally don't and that's terrifying deep\ndown jack what are you\ni i i i don't want to say it and that's\ninteresting but\nyou're you're fishing for week and i'm\nand i know that but i don't want to say\nit um because i'm like no i'm not weak\ni'm i'm offended at the fact that you'd\neven suggest it but\ni know that's not your suggestion yep\nbut i i am bringing it out because i\nwant that reaction right so i i know\nyou're not gonna say it\nbecause\nbecause even if you if you felt\nconfident in yourself you could say it\ndo you get that\nright\nokay that that's funny yeah yeah right\nyeah because like like like jack are you\nstupid you could say yes\nlike you have no problem saying yes\ni think yeah i know i could say that\nyeah no no no no i feel stupid\ni'm dumb\nyeah exactly exactly right so that's\nconfidence\nso it's okay like i don't need you to\nsay it i'm but i'm just bringing it up\nand i'm glad so you know it was a good\npoint it was a good point right and\nyou're like i'm not going to say it\nuh-uh\ngood\nright so that's the problem\nis like and it's like here's the wildest\nthing which i don't know if you're gonna\nbe able to accept yet i think it's okay\nfor you to be weak\ni think it's okay for you to be not\nenough\ni think whatsoever you are i know it\nsounds kind of weird like is enough and\ni'm not just saying that because i'm not\nsaying that because like everyone is\nenough i don't think that i think some\npeople genuinely do need to be doing\nmore in life\ni think in your case\ni do think you're doing a fantastic job\nand i think it's okay\nfor you to have parts of weakness within\nyou because i know this sounds kind of\nweird i have faith in all of the parts\nof you that have overcome that part of\nweakness i don't think you need to be\nperfect\nyou can be flawed you don't have to be a\nhundred percent and we can still\nbet on you\nright i would bet on you any day of the\nweek i don't need you to get an a\ni don't need to have an external\nassurance that like you're gonna do\ngreat\ni can put faith in the part of you that\nworks hard i can put faith in the part\nof you that like you know tries to make\npeople happy i can put faith in those\nparts and i don't need assurances but i\nsuspect that's going to be quite foreign\nto you\nyeah no yeah i don't think i'd be able\nto i'm very i'm very difficult to\nconvince without evidence\nand it's simple\nbut that hold on a second i'm not trying\nto give you evidence what word am i\nusing no you're not no what do i have\nfor you\nfaith yeah so what is faith\nuh i suppose\nfor one of a better term blind belief\nabsolutely right it's about the absence\nof evidence\nso that's my point that's what's going\nto be hard for you this is just one\nconversation so you've got time you\ndon't have to figure it out tomorrow\nbut i think essentially what you need is\nlike you're trying so hard to fix\neverything to reassure yourself because\nonce you have that thing in the bank\naccount you don't need faith anymore\nbecause you've got certainty does that\nmake sense\nwhat you need to learn is how to have\nfaith in yourself that it's okay that\nyou don't need to be perfect you don't\nhave to be number one on twitch you\ndon't need 100 million dollars in the\nbank account that you will actually be\nokay like just because of who you are\nbut i recognize that's foreign so\nno but but it's a very\nit was very comforting to hear that you\nknow that was a very comforting sort of\nlike monologue which i was like yeah you\nknow if i could really subscribe to that\nthen and that's not to say i ignored it\neither that it did sync but not and it\nobviously doesn't change overnight does\nit but no no so so i i like that that's\nactually progress you know why that's\nwholesale progress\nbecause you said if i could subscribe to\nthat instead of i should subscribe to\nthat butt\nit's very subtle\nbut that's exactly where you need to be\nif i could you need to play around with\nthese things jack explore them like\nnavigate them you stop telling yourself\nwhat you should do and start exploring i\nknow it sounds kind of small but for me\nthat's like that's a big win\nthat does sound quite big yeah\nright it's different from the way that\nyou've been talking things yeah like\nyou just need to figure things out it's\nbecause so far this entire conversation\nit's been i know the right answer but\nor this is how i feel but it's always\nbeen torn between black and white right\nthis is the first time that i've heard\nyou say something that like oh like i\nwonder if i can do this it's curiosity\nit's exploration as opposed to choice\nand very practically i think just give\nyourself a chance to you know if you're\nfeeling paralyzed you know start to like\nlook in yourself and try to ask yourself\nlike okay like is this me like feeling\nweak is this me afraid of being weak is\nthis me afraid like do i have that fear\njust notice the fear within yourself\nand ask yourself what is this fear\ndriving me to do\nand can i set aside the fear for a\nlittle time a while can i be reassuring\nright can i be like almost an older\nbrother to like 17 year old me who is\nafraid that i may actually like quit\nschool and be like hey man like even if\nyou have to quit that's okay\ni have faith that you'll land on your\nfeet\nquestions\nthoughts\nno i\ni think it's a good i think yeah\nit's a very\ni think one you understood it well which\nis always very nice because i think it\nto me i think seeing it mapped out like\nthat's great because it's also just a\nvery confusing\nconflicts inherently confusing and and\nso to see it mapped out in a way that\nlike makes sense is great uh and then uh\ni think yeah no i think it's a good idea\njust kind of\nhaving a bit more blind faith in in\nthings generally i think i think we've\nreally focused this inwards but but me\nas a person i i probably benefit from\njust\nbelieving\nthings more i'm horribly skeptical um\nand\ndon't believe things more explore\nyeah okay sorry yes yes\nall right so\nyeah don't change who you are jack\nyou're great bro okay\nokay but\nyou know i think faith sometimes has to\nbe like found right like i because you\ngot to be careful because there may be a\npart of your mind that hijacks that and\nsays oh like jack you should believe\nmore you should have more faith\nright right right yeah which is which is\nokay that is what you see what i mean\nlike it'll it'll be it'll be sneaky\nand then you'll start beating yourself\nup for not having enough balloons\nright like logically like people who\nhave more faith tend to do better in\nlife so i should have more faith\nso\nyeah yeah yeah\nyeah that's a good that's a good way\nyeah right so so anyway i i kind of\ntorpedoed what you were saying i'm sorry\ni don't know but i'm glad you did\nbecause i would have left this having\nlike seen it like that so yeah\nso but do you see like in the big\ntakeaway i want you to have jack is\nnotice that there's this thing in your\nmind which is going to be like\nit's like malware almost that'll like\nit'll pop up no matter like what like\neven with this discussion of faith and\nbelief it'll insert itself into that\nyes so as best as you can what you\nreally need to do more than anything\nelse is just notice that it's activity\ndon't try to stop it don't try to\ncontrol it just see like okay the next\ntime i'm torn and the next time i'm busy\nask yourself where is this coming from\nwhen you're mentally busy oh god i can't\nafford to move\nit's gonna come from this place look\nlook at okay what where why do i feel\nlike i'm too busy why do i feel like i\nhave no much no time where is this\ncoming from and then there's gonna be a\nbunch of logic that's gonna be like\nlayers one two and three and then\nsubsurface there's gonna be something\nelse\nthere's gonna be either a fear that like\noh my god what if this falls apart\nsome kind of uncertainty some kind of\nlack of faith and like even though you\ndon't have to change it just be like oh\nwow there's a part of me that's really\nafraid acknowledge it\nbring it to the surface instead of\nfighting with the logic\nand i think the more you're able to do\nthat the better you'll\nall right be\nyou\nthoughts questions i feel like we're at\na good stopping point how do you feel no\nyeah that that feels quite conclusive\nokay that feels like good advice yeah\nthat's great thank you i appreciate it\ndo you like meditating do you want to\nlearn how to meditate that'd be great uh\nyeah i i i find it very interesting okay\nhave you ever meditated before\nit's little bits nothing crazy just this\nlittle dabbling i think um\ni i think it's something i was like yeah\ni could benefit from that so i played\naround with it a little bit yeah okay so\ni'm gonna\nlet me just think for a second\nokay i'm gonna give you a choice\ndo you want to so there's a part i'm\ngonna hypothesize for a moment there's a\npart of your psyche\nthat is afraid that you're weak okay\nsure just i'm just gonna assume that\nokay it may not be true\nif i were to give you a choice if you\nwanted to understand that part\nor digest that part and make it go away\nlike basically fix it or understand it\nwhich one would you pick\noh\noh that's difficult because like in my\nhead if i understood it maybe i could\ndefeat it but then then that would\nthat's what i thought i'm like oh\nunderstanding it'd be great but then\nit's so i could fix it so ultimately\nwould i prefer to fix it or\nunderstand it that's all neither one is\nbetter from my perspective no it's no no\nwhat instinctively appeals to you\nuh no i think i'd like to understand it\nokay so we're gonna do a technique that\nwe do from time to time it's gonna be\ncalled\ni call it charging the laser beam okay\nokay it's gonna be kind of weird so what\ni'm gonna ask you to do is sit up\nstraight\nand then\ni'm going to kind of demonstrate we're\ngoing to take our i i don't want i never\nrealized how unstraight i was sat my god\nif you're or how tall are you\nuh like five nine okay are you is your\nback straight when you sit in that chair\nyeah\nlike straight straight\nuh oh hold on maybe it's not actually\nnow you've acknowledged it hold on\nokay i'm now not leading against the\nchair i'm just sat straight that's okay\nand are you comfortable like this\nyeah okay\nso this technique is going to have two\nparts do you want theory or you want to\njust jump into the practice well yeah no\ni love theory that'd be great okay so\nkind of taking a step back there are\nthese seven things called chakras or\nchakras\nand each one is supposed to govern a\nparticular kind of um\nlike\npart of our being so for example there's\na chakra that governs desire there's a\nchakra that governs digestion\nso there's some\nthere actually there's very little\nevidence to support any of this chakra\ntheory\nuh there\nthere is some evidence that their heart\nchakra meditations are specifically\nuseful for treating depression and\ncompassion but the studies are very very\nsmall we haven't really looked at the\nother chakras\nso people think i'm a good psychiatrist\nwhich in a sense i am but i think a lot\nof the reason that i'm able to do what i\ndo is because i do a particular set of\nthird eye practices which govern my\nability to understand and like\ngive me intuition it's sort of like\nleveling up my intuition skill yeah as a\nscientist i bel i wonder if what the\nyogis kind of figured out is that there\nare different parts of the brain that\nsomehow get like activated or\nstrengthened by doing particular\nmeditation practices\nand maybe it's not like some sort of\nmystical like third eye sight but just\nlike doing these kinds of practices\nsomehow enhance our ability to like pay\nattention or something like that like i\ndon't yeah that makes sense yeah yeah\nthat makes sense to me so i'm gonna\nteach you a third eye practice that is\ntheoretically designed to\ngive you a sense of intuition or\nunderstanding\nright okay\nwhat i can be pretty sure about is that\nnumerous studies of meditation suggest\nthat what you do is not actually that\nimportant but there's a set of\nscientific highly provable benefits\nwhich you will get from this practice\nthis includes improvements in focus\nattention memory reductions in stress\nand cortisol so like those kinds of\nthings you're gonna get no matter what i\nteach you okay so right at the least\nyou'll get that stuff hopefully it'll\nhelp you with things like decision\nmaking and on the top end if we're\nreally lucky and all that weird mystical\nstuff turns out to be true\nthen or even some of it turns to be true\nthen maybe you'll get some kind of weird\nlike insight into yourself\nyes it'd be excellent okay\nso this this practice is gonna have two\nphases one i'm gonna take my middle\nfinger and i'm going to hover it above\nthe space between my eyebrows so i don't\nwant to touch okay and i'm going to do\nthis with my eyes closed yeah i'll i'll\nwalk you through it so i'm just going to\ndemonstrate okay and then what i'm going\nto really pay attention to is the\nsensation in my forehead\nover where my middle finger is hovering\nokay so it's going to sound kind of\nweird but you'll feel maybe feel\nsomething so you just want to focus on\nyour forehead where the finger is\npointing that's going to be phase one of\nthe practice we're going to do that with\nour eyes closed\nokay if you happen to get some kind of\nsensation there then we've got two\nadditional steps to the practice\none is to then relax the hand and just\nfocus on the sensation on your forehead\nthe second is when you breathe in\nimagine\nyou're going to feel the breath\nin your nostrils but imagine that that\nbreath is going up\nand into that point and as you breathe\nout imagine that it's coming out of that\npoint too so we're gonna go\nokay kind of thing okay\nso i'm gonna sort of walk you through it\ni may ask you one or two questions\num just to kind of see where you are\nthere isn't a right way or a wrong way\nto do the practice people have different\nexperiences okay\nso sit up straight\nclose your eyes\nand start by just noticing your\nbreathing\nso go ahead and breathe let's say take\nso you're on breath number two\ngood\ngive me one more\nbeautiful\nnice slow exhalation\nand now go ahead and take you can\ncontinue breathing take the right uh\nyour right hand middle finger go ahead\nand place it\nkind of\nyeah like don't touch your forehead\nbut try to bring it really really close\nand what i want you to do is like\nnotice the sensation of your finger\ndo you feel anything on your forehead\njust like\nlike pressure i guess is it almost if\nthat makes any sense is it like almost\nas if it's being touched but not quite\nit's like it's conscious of the fact\nthat there's something there yep so i\nwant you to just focus on that you can\ntry to bring your finger a little bit\ncloser\noh yeah i moved it quite a lot\nyep there you go so now focus on that\nyou feel that pressure\nokay\nnow you can go ahead and relax for a\nlittle bit\nyou can let your hand come down and just\nfocus on the sensation do you still feel\nthe pressure\nokay so we're gonna focus on that for\nabout 15 seconds\nand now i want you to bring your finger\nback we're going to do this a second and\na third time\nwhere you kind of bring it over and sort\nof feel that pressure let the finger\nkind of\nstrengthen the pressure if you will\nand now let your hand come down\nfocus on the sensation in your forehead\nwe're gonna go for another 15 seconds or\nso\nand now for the third round we're going\nto hold it there for about a minute now\nso really try to point your finger\ntowards your forehead\nfor lack of a better term feel the\nenergy\nin that spot\nnow bring your hand down\nso now i want you to breathe into it\nso feel that point on your forehead and\nas you breathe in you'll feel the\ninhalation the cool air enter your\nnostrils\ngo up into your forehead\nthen as you exhale\nfeel the warmth come out\nand go ahead and do about five breaths\nand now what i'm going to do is just\ngive you a choice\nso if you\nfelt the sensation and kind of enjoyed\nthat\nyou can drive your attention into the\nspot on your forehead it's almost like\nimagine that your mind\nis behind your forehead\nand that you can focus and concentrate\nyour mind into that spot\nand if you prefer the breath you can\nbreathe into it\nwhichever one just feels better for you\nwe'll practice for a period of about\nthree minutes\nif you get bored of one you can do the\nother\nyou\nyou\nand now go ahead and take a deep breath\nin and out\nlet yourself start to return to\nthe world\nyou're sitting in your chair\nin your new place\nyou're jack\nyou're 19 years old\nnotice the facets of your reality start\nto come back who you are where you are\nyou may be hungry you may be thirsty you\nmay have errands to run\nand notice that for a time you stepped\noutside of your life and just\nexisted you are neither success nor\nfailure\nyou are neither an a student or an f\nstudent\nyou may have even lost track of your\nname your gender\nyour job\nthat these are all parts of life\nbut there's almost a time out space that\nyou stepped into\nand now put your palms together in front\nof you\nkind of like in namaste position if you\nknow what that is so touch your palms\ntogether\nand then rub them together rub rub rub\nrub rub so you feel heat tension energy\nand then cuff them over your eyes cup\nyour palms over your eyes\ntake a deep breath in and slowly exhale\nand open your eyes while covered by your\nhands\nand then when you're ready put your\nhands down\nhi\nhi\nhow do you feel\ngood\nthat was good that was yeah no it's very\nlike\nyeah\ni don't know what that means but i think\nthat that's dude no yeah no it was good\nit was good yeah yeah yeah\ni think the whole point of it feels like\ni shouldn't really come out with many\nthoughts about it i feel like it was\njust like yeah that's yeah right no\nthat's what i think you did really well\nlike you're like it was the whole thing\nwas like\nthat's the whole yeah that means you're\ndoing it right so i think that's the\ntricky thing about meditation is the\nmore you describe it the more\nit actually confuses people\nbecause if you say oh it was like so\npeaceful like oh my god i saw so someone\nin our chat said that this felt like\ncharging a laser beam i think that made\na lot of sense to me\nbut\nsure okay yeah no i get that yeah yeah\nno no no you said it yeah i feel that\nyeah right it's it's but it's like if i\ntold you like hey this is a charging the\nlaser beam practice people are like what\nyeah no that's no now i've done it i go\nyou mean beforehand yeah so overall um\nyou know if if it worked for you it\nworked for you\num and i would say that you can do this\npractice for like 15 minutes a day\nuh ideally three days a week\ni mean yeah three days a week if you\nbump it up to about five days a week\nyou'll get a little bit more benefit\nbut i think you can do like you know\nwhatever variation felt right you can\nstart off\nwith some deep breathing\nyou can use the finger to charge the\nlaser beam but if you feel that\nsensation that's really what you're\nfocusing on and so the thing that can be\nused to trigger the sensation or make\nyou aware of the sensation but once\nyou've felt enough or your ugna chakra\nstarts to activate and energy starts to\nflow through it you may no longer need\nthe finger\nright um and then you're that sorry your\nthird eye chakra and then\nin terms of you you can decide like if\nyou want to just
