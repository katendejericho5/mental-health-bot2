    "transcript": "like to support you in these things i'd\nlike to help you get into a good college\nbut when i try to do that like you seem\nto fight me and then i get stuck\nwhat do you think i should do about that\nhey laila thank you so much for coming\ngive me one second\nall right so\npatrick thanks for joining us people\nfrom patrick's community welcome\num so layla let me go ahead and figure\nout how to get this do you have video or\nno\ni do have a video do i need to turn it\non or is it okay if just to beat off\num so it's it\nso here's our approach so just to give\nyou a little bit of orienting you don't\nhave to do anything you don't want to do\ntoday you don't have to answer any\nquestions that you don't feel\ncomfortable answering you do not have to\nshow your face if you don't want to\nat the same time\ni certainly benefit a lot from seeing\npeople's faces and i think the audience\ndoes as well because sometimes you know\nif we're just communicating by voice\nlike facial expressions like can\nmean a lot\num but at the same time you know for\nprivacy concerns and things like that if\nyou don't feel comfortable doing that\nyou absolutely do not have to thank you\nso i would prefer to not uh have a\nvideo okay so that's totally fine thank\nyou\nso um and are you okay with sort of the\nrest of it like you feel okay uh you\nknow if i ask you anything that you\ndon't feel comfortable answering you're\nkind of okay\nsaying yeah i don't want to answer that\nyeah if i don't feel comfortable i'll\nlet you know\nso is it is it just for me or someone\nelse also there and they can hear us or\nor what\nyeah was that not clear to you\nso we are we're no\ni they i know whoever sent me that email\nuh and texted me\nand just it seems that i just have an\nappointment not with you know other\npeople\nit seems to me you know\nbut could you please explain\nyeah so let's let's maybe\nlet's maybe pause\nbecause this is something that's very\nvery important to understand\nso um what we try to do here at healthy\ngamer is like have conversations with\nindividual people but we stream those\nconversations on the internet\nand so if you are not kind of aware of\nthat\num i think maybe what we should do is\nlike pause because\nthis is being streamed live\nand and so\nit you know\ni don't wanna i would almost say like if\nthat's not what you understood like i\nwouldn't even i don't think it's even\nappropriate to ask you are you okay with\nthat because like i want you to make\nthat decision with a clear head\ndoes that make sense i i think it's i'm\nokay i just wanna we don't need to name\nour our uh kids or just no no don't\nanswer the questions\nyeah absolutely so so i think and i\nthink that's okay yeah so the other\nthing about you know like i said earlier\nlike privacy is very important to us so\num you know if you don't want to use\nyour full name if you don't want to use\nyour kids name if you don't want to um\nyou know it\nit's not you don't have to share\nanything in fact we wouldn't recommend\nthat you do that okay okay sounds good\nyou sure about that\nyes i am\npositive\nokay\nokay so layla then why don't you tell me\na little bit about\nso just the last thing to just to\nclarify with you because i'm not sure\nexactly what you understood so while i\nam a psychiatrist um i don't do i don't\ndeliver medical advice over the internet\nso i won't be diagnosing you with\nanything i won't be diagnosing your kid\nwith anything and i'm not actually your\ndoctor do you understand that\nyep\nokay\nokay so um then let me just share with\nyou a little bit about is it okay if i\nkind of share with you a little bit\nabout why we do stream this on the\ninternet absolutely yes please\nso i think what's going on in society\nright now is that there's a disconnect\nbetween parents and their children so\nwhat we try to do at healthy gamer is we\nhave interviews oftentimes with you know\npeople like your kids\nwhere they share their perspective and\ntheir experience of growing up in this\nworld their relationship with their\nparents\noftentimes we've found that parents who\nwatch kind of even like not you know\nobviously it's not their kid but\nwatching someone who could be their kid\ntalk about their experience of life is\nvery educational for the parents\nand helps them better understand their\ntheir own children and how to\ncommunicate with them and what could be\ngoing on with their kids does that make\nsense\nyeah\nnow what we're trying to do is actually\nflip it around because what we've\nrealized that healthy gamer is that so\nmost of our audience we reach somewhere\ni don't know anywhere between like a\nmillion and 20 million people um a month\nwhat we've realized is that like\nyour kids or like the generation of your\nchildren\ncould probably benefit from\nunderstanding their parents perspective\nand so the reason that we've asked you\nto come today is to share your\nexperience of you know what you're like\nwhat your ex what your situation with\nyour kid is like and so that hopefully\nall of the kids out there who are\nlistening\nwill learn something about what a parent\ngoes through and we hope that by the\nkids understanding what the parents go\nthrough that it'll improve their\nrelationship\nyeah does that make sense\nyeah\nokay\nso why don't you tell me a little bit\nabout um you know what your situation is\nand and maybe if there's anything i can\nhelp you with\nyeah so well i have a 14 years old uh\nson who is you know recently so i mean\nsince the since the pandemic\nand\nhe's been you know playing a lot on the\ncomputer xbox and using his phone a lot\nbefore then\nwe had a\ntime for phone and everything but since\nyou know the pandemic happened and\nthey were staying home all kids and they\ndidn't have much fun so\nwe just kind of break our rule\nand now it becomes like more and like\nkind of addiction\nso okay and it definitely i mean it it\naffects our relationship and i'm very\nconcerned about um\nhis\nhis school and his you know academic\nsure so um let me ask you how is it that\nwhat it what changes have you noticed in\nyour son\nwell using a lot i mean spending a lot\nof time with it with his you know with\nhis phone and and xbox and you know\ncomputers you know\nwhen you\nwhen you say a lot what does a lot mean\nwell\ni mean during this so of course now you\nknow school soros\nhe can he he cannot use his phone as\nmuch as he used to\nbut\nafter school like let's say\nfrom 6 to 10 10 30 he use his his phone\nand he i mean and\nall others like xbox\nso we're talking about like four to four\nand a half hours per day\nyes and then on weekends all day long uh\nhe's on his phone\nwhat is he doing on his phone\nwell i mean talking to his friends you\nknow snapchat tick tock and stuff like\nthat\nokay\nand when you say he talks to his friends\nhe's like texting with his friends or\nhe's on like voices no phone like phone\ncalls\nokay\nand and this is a problem in your eyes\nof course\ni know sometimes i ask silly questions\nit's just to kind of confirm so what do\nyou think is the problem here\nwell he we we don't understand you know\ntime together he doesn't you know\ndo\nlike\nexercising you know doing other things\nit's just it's just using phone all day\nlong\nokay\num and what would you what would you\nthink would like what would you like him\nto do like what would what would it what\nwould a healthy relationship with\ntechnology look like in your mind well\nlike let's say\nkind of actively like going like walking\nor hiking or playing outside even either\nwith his friends or family\ndoing chores you know\ndoing something you know he he it could\nbe like you know\ndrawing it could be\nsome some other thing some other like\nyou know doing some art or doing\nwhatever you know\nanything except\nusing his phone and\nyeah that's that's what i'm hearing\nright anything like that you know i\ndon't really care as long as it's\nsomething besides the phone outside\ncleaning someone's house\nsure\nand and what what happens when you try\nto you know\nhow how do you try to get him to do\nother things like what does that look\nlike\nlike how do you get him to try to do\nchores or exercise oh how i mean\ni have to\nend up fighting\nsometimes\nturn off turn off the you know internet\nor turn off you know because i have\naccess to his xbox\ncomputer and i can turn off the internet\npause it\nbut i really for 14 years old i don't\nwant to get to that point and i don't\nwant any conflict any fighting i want\nhim to kind of understand and i tried a\nlot a lot of things\nso tell me what you've tried\nwell like you know\ni mean give him like okay after you do\nthis i'll give you you know more time\ni'll give you this oh you know\nlike some kind of prize not really you\nknow prize but something that motivate\nhim\nand and what do you try to motivate for\nshort short terms you know and then\nhe kind of gave up and then he he just\ndoesn't want to do that\nso leila um it sounds like you you know\nhere's what i'm hearing\nyeah so your your son maybe had\nhealthier habits that kind of pandemic\nhit\nthings got way worse\nand now\nyou genuinely recognize that you know\nit's starting to really become a problem\nand you're doing your best to respect\nhis preferences\nyou try really hard to help him\nunderstand um you try really hard not to\nfight not to punish you don't want to\njust be like you know a dictator in the\nhouse you're not just going to unplug\nthe internet and you're kind of doing\nyour level best\nto not resort to those severe\npunishments\nbut that something is kind of getting\nlost in communication and sometimes\nyou're almost forced into that position\nyeah\nis that pretty fair\nyes\nwhat is that like for you to be forced\ninto that position\nfor for sam to to do like\nyou you mean by by force force him or\nwell no i mean i was kind of wondering\nlike so here i what i'm sort of\nenvisioning is that you're you're a mom\nwho loves your son\nand he's doing something that's\nunhealthy for him\nand i was just kind of noticing that it\nmust be like really hard for you to be\nput into this situation where it's like\neither he ruins his life\nor\nyou're the bad guy\nright there's like it almost feels like\na lose-lose situation to me\nwell no i i do i do that but um\ni\ni do kind of you know turn off like you\nknow i mean pause his cell phone his you\nknow\ni if i\nnotice that he really needs but\nsometimes he\nby like late but he does it he he does\nwhatever he needs to maybe\na lot of reminds\ni have to do\nbut i want him to i want to kind of be\num\nlike you know\ni want him to understand and\ni want him to manage his time\ni don't want i the thing i want\num for him is like he understand that he\nneeds to manage his time and\ni don't want to be on top of him always\nokay kind of like policing him no yeah\nsure\nso how do you get your child to manage\ntheir own time how does that happen\nwell\nso since i mean since he was a kid i i\nlike kind of\ngive him like a time for doing his you\nknow things like for example if he wants\nsomething i said okay you have to do\nthis between this and this time and then\nyou will get that so it was okay until\nsometimes you know um back and forth\nback and forth you know um\nfighting not not fighting like you know\narguing\nand you know uh since you know he turns\nto the teenage\nand it gets a little bit conflict\nyeah so can you help me understand like\nlike almost what a conversation looks\nlike like what what'll you say first\nwhen will you say it what will you say\nnext and then how do things kind of end\nup in a fight\nwell i i tried to send i tried to say it\nvery nicely and then ask him\nso what would you say several times\nplease do for example do your homework\nand then you have this this time to do\nit and then remind him sometimes and if\nhe\nand\nhe doesn't do that then i i i started to\num i mean do like you know taking his\nphone\nor um or\nother like computers or whatever you\nknow xbox he he plays\nso yeah so let me let's kind of tunnel\ninto that and by the way leila you're\nare you feeling okay with the\nconversation do you feel okay kind of\ncontinuing yeah\nokay this is really helpful for me and\nand i really hope will uh because i\nthink what you're describing is\nsomething a lot of parents struggle with\na lot of kids struggle with right yep so\ni'm kind of curious when you say please\ndo your homework what do you understand\nuh\nwhen you say please do something so if i\nlay like i were to say like hey layla\nplease give me a call tomorrow i mean is\nthat something that you think is sort of\nlike a request or an order or a favor or\nwhat does that mean\nthis is kind of request\nit's a request right so like yeah\nrequests can be denied right\nuh\nit depends\nso when it depends who requests that\nso if it's i mean it depends\nyeah so like when you say please it's\nbetween parents if it between parents\nand kids of course it's going to be most\nof the time denied\nokay so so like but what i'm kind of\nsaying is when you when you ask your son\nto do something\ni'm curious like in your mind does he\nhave to do it or he's allowed to refuse\nno he has to do it\nokay and so what i'm hearing is that\nyou're giving him an order\nbut you're phrasing it like a request\nwell it's it's both\nbut it's still it's it's order yeah he\nneeds to do that but i i\ni i don't want to like do it you ha i\nmean like saying the way that's the way\nthat say we we say it's it's\nit's different\nyeah so\nyeah and laila i think this could be\npart of the problem right because what\ni'm hearing is that\nyou say something and you don't want to\norder him\nbut you're kind of ordering him\nso you think it shouldn't be\nwhich way should it be it should be\nrequest or it should be order or both or\nwhat do you think\ni think\nwhatever it is should be consistent\nright so if in your mind it's an order\nit should be clearly communicated as an\norder and if in your mind is a request\nit should be clearly communicated as a\nrequest\nbecause here's the thing so like if if\nmy so i used to be addicted to video\ngames\nokay\nand my mom told me the same thing that\nthat you did\nyeah right and so she would say please\ndo this and like when someone asks me to\nplease do something\nin my mind it's sort of like i don't\nhave to right\nyeah\ndoes that does that make sense to you\nyeah yes yes totally yes\nand then and then she would come in an\nhour later and she would be like she\nwould ask me a question have you done\nyour homework yet do you ask that to\nyour son\nno i for homework i said you have to do\nit\ni see so so when you said you remind him\nseveral times what what does that\nconversation look like so you say hey\nplease do your homework right that's no\nno i don't say please do no no for\nhomework i don't say please do your\nhomework i say i see you need to you\nneed to get off and get on for your\nhomework okay so let's no yeah get let's\nlet's kind of dig into this a little bit\nmore because that's really\nuseful to hear layla thank you so much\nfor clarifying that so like let's say\nlike what when is this conversation\nhappening is this like a weekday\nconversation or like weekend\nconversation\nweekday\nokay so weekday like what time does he\nget home\n5 36\nokay and what time does your first\ninteraction with your child happen\nwell uh\nseven let's see okay so 7 pm rolls\naround and who initiates the\nconversation\ni do\nokay and what do you say awesome you're\ndoing great layla by the way\nwe're gonna get to the bottom of this\nokay uh i said you need to do your\nhomework\nokay before this time for example before\n10.\nfantastic you need to do homework before\n10.\nyep and how does he respond\nwell\nit\nhe he doesn't do right away but he\ndoesn't okay and are you okay with that\nyes as long as he does it\nso\nso what does that communication look\nlike so you say hey you need to do your\nhomework before 10. yeah\none that that that works my my problem\nis it's uh\nabout um\nhis screen time honestly\nokay so now i'm gonna even though i\ndon't i don't care that i'm not let's\nnot say that\ni don't care actually he does his his\nhomework and he's you know school but\nstill\nhe is on his phone a lot\nso\nyeah i want him to\nminimize that\nokay i'm i'm with you 100 but let's try\nto look at that from kind of hit like\nlet's not steer away from the homework\nyet is it okay if i just kind of\nbecause i want to get that kind of\npinned down because i want to understand\nyour interaction there so you come in at\n7 8 you say you have to do your homework\nbefore 10. when does he end up doing do\nyou when does he end up doing his\nhomework\nhe's always like you know in the last\nminutes sure so like he starts at nine\nmaybe yeah okay so he starts at nine and\nhe finishes it by ten so you've given\nhim an order\nand he come like do you do you talk to\nhim at all between seven and nine or\nlike you're kind of like you know he's\ngonna do it\nuh a couple of reminder but i know that\nhe he he does it\nso a couple of reminders help me\nunderstand what a reminder actually\nsounds like\nlike did you finish did you do it\nsomething what does he say\nhe said i'll do it\nhe says i'll do it okay so you remind\nhim like maybe at like 8 30 let's say\nuh yeah kind of\nokay and he says i'll do it and then he\nends up doing it and then\ndo you\nis there any discussion afterward like\nwhat happens at 10 pm do you guys talk\nabout it\nwell just checking with him did you do\nit and then check it and then if he\ndid it\nso then he's all set\nokay but the other thing\nhe does it because he he wants to get to\nto the screen he wants to get under the\nscreen and then play for late time and\nthen go to bed late so\nmostly that yeah we'll get to that in a\nsecond so when he does his homework and\nyou check it and he does it what he what\ndo you do you say anything after that\nlike\nlike what\nlike good job\nof course\ni know it's kind of a weird question but\nare you sure you say that no no no it's\nno it's not weird but i i i i didn't\nknow what what do you mean exactly by\nsure asking that yes\nokay and how does he respond to that\nwell you know 14 years old doesn't\nrespond you know if you say good job\nthank you they are like yeah\nyeah right he doesn't he doesn't really\nknow how to respond to that no do you\nget\ndo you get the sense like how do you\nfeel when he's done his homework well i\nalthough he doesn't say anything but i\nfeel like he's he's also happy to do\nthat on time i mean by that time and\nthen he's free he i i can feel it that\nhe feels that he's free to go\nokay so he's happy that he's done with\nhis chores yeah and that he has followed\nyour orders so he's happy to be free\nof the homework and even arguably he's\non his own time and then he can do\nlike\nbeing on his phone or being on xbox or\nyou know playing games\nso layla when he does his homework by 10\npm how do you feel emotionally\nwell of course i i feel\ni feel good\nare you sure about that he did it\nyeah are you sure you feel good that he\ndoes his homework\nyes\nare there any other feelings there\num\ni\nhonestly i don't know what do you mean\nby that yeah\ni know it's really confusing right so\nthis is going to be like so i'm going to\ntoss something i'm not i'm and you let\nme know right if this makes sense to you\nor not\nbut what i'm sort of hearing is that\nlike you can't really be upset that he\ndid his homework but in the back of your\nmind you're not really like happy\nbecause the only reason he's doing his\nhomework is to get to the screen time\nright and like what i'm almost hearing\nfrom you is that you're almost like even\nthough he did what he was supposed to do\nhe's not like doing it for the right\nreasons and you can't really be happy\nif he's just complying with your orders\nbecause he's not understanding he's not\ndoing it for the right reason he's just\ncomplying with your orders to get you\noff of his back so that he can like go\nback to the addiction and how can any\nparent be happy when they're you know\nthe kid is just sitting there like\nwaiting\nokay mom are we done yet can i get back\nto it can i get back to it now okay\ngreat like how can a mom truly be happy\nin that situation\nthat's true\nwhat what do you think is that because\nbecause it's interesting because you\nyou're even doing this thing where i'll\nask you about the homework and then you\nkind of like will change the topic and\nyou'll be like i just don't want him to\nuse the screen\ndo you understand does that make sense\nyes yes yes so are you actually like\nsatisfied like i know that he did what\nhe was supposed to do so technically you\ncan't be like upset with him\nbut i wouldn't be surprised at all if\nthere was a part of you that was like\nstill uneasy about the way that you had\nto force him to do it and that you can't\nreally be happy about the way things\nended up\nyeah that's true\nyeah one what yeah one part one part yes\nit's you know it's right and the other\npart still he's getting on on on the\nscreen which is which i don't like it\nthat's true yeah\nand and so\nhow\nso when you dislike his screen usage\ndoes that\nget communicated to him in any way\neither in tone or even facial expression\nor like through words\nmay i ask one more time i mean yeah tell\nme your question please\nyeah so like so what i'm hearing is that\nyou're kind of happy that he did his\nwork right yeah yeah but then you're\nalso kind of like unhappy that he's like\nmissing the bigger point\nwhich is that the only reason he's doing\nthe work is to like feed his addiction\nand so you're kind of unhappy with that\nright\nyes\nand so you know when people communicate\nwith each other sometimes the emotions\nthat we feel\nwill get communicated to the your son\nfor example so does that happiness get\ncommu does the unhappiness that you feel\nget communicated to him in any way\nyes because then after yeah after he\ndoes his homework then i tell him hey\nyou ha you don't have much time\nto\nplay a lot you have just this time to\nget i mean you need to get off\nuh you know early because you need to go\nto bed\nso\nyeah he\nmost i mean not most of time but he\nuh\nhe does it but sometimes i need you know\ni end up to to pause\nhe's uh he's a screen\nokay so sometimes he'll like listen to\nthat order as well sometimes yeah and\nand other times you he doesn't listen to\nthe order yeah and i have yeah i have to\nso you can your action yeah you're\nforced into like setting a hard boundary\nyes okay\nand how does he how does he res how does\nthat communication happen and how does\nhe respond to that\nwell\nhe said okay okay okay but he it's not\nlike he really he he said he he doesn't\nreally mean that\nof course and yeah\nand then i have to get an action take an\naction what is taking an action what is\nthat like paint me a picture if i was\nlike in your house\nand what would i say\nyeah i have to pause me\npause he's from from my phone i can\npause you know\nand any devices that i have\non the internet so i can pause it\nso you use your phone and you just like\npause the internet pause the yes not\npause the internet pause the device i\ncan pause the device so you can pause\nhis xbox his pc his phone from your\nphone yeah\nand do you tell him you're doing that or\nbefore i do it yes i said you have for\nexample you have 10 minutes and if you\ndon't get off it's gonna i'm gonna pause\nit\nokay he gets very upset he gets where\nsometimes he asks me can i have like two\nmore minutes to i mean\nno i i but i do it\nand when you say that that was great so\nhe says can i have two more minutes no i\nsaid no and he gets really upset and\nthen sometimes i scream but i don't care\nhe screams or you scream\nno he screams sometimes that yeah i need\nto finish this and i said no and then he\nget you know gets back to whatever go to\nbed\nso so he's he screams and says i need to\nfinish it and then do you yell back or\ndo you're just like sorry\nno i just make him cry just be quiet go\nto your bed tomorrow is another day\nokay\nyeah\nand um\nhow do you\nhow do you understand that interaction\nlike help me understand how how do you\nfeel about that dynamic\nabout\ni mean doing that with him sure\nso he needs to understand i mean i feel\nof course i feel bad that i feel bad for\nhim but he needs to understand that\nthis i mean the time managing he needs\nto understand that sure that makes a lot\nof sense to me so like you you wish it\nwas different\nit's not that like you don't want to\nupset your son but at the end of the day\nlike\nas his parent it is like your\nresponsibility to\nhelp him understand the things that he\nneeds to understand right yeah so if\nsometimes if that means a little bit of\ntough love like that's okay\nlike it's a necessary evil\nis that fair to say\nyeah\nyeah so let's talk about this for a\nsecond layla um i i don't blame you at\nall by the way are you feeling okay like\ndo you feel like i'm i'm trying to like\nmake you sound bad or making you\npainting you out to be a bad parent or\nanything like that\nno but i would like to hear more about\nand how we can help kids absolutely so\nwe're just getting there yeah so i think\nthe first thing is to kind of map out\nwhat your interactions are like\nand then try to look at so let me give\nyou a little bit of road map so we want\nto map out like what the individual\ninteractions are like\nand once we understand what your\ninteractions are like we can start to\nunderstand\nhow people\nfeel\nafter those interactions\nand then we can start to change our\ninteractions to try to move in a\ndifferent direction does that make sense\nyeah okay so you say he needs to\nunderstand right layla\nyes how do people understand things\nwhat is the process through which we\ngain gain understanding\nwell by by telling them\nby telling them so like by telling them\nand by you know making rules for\nthem\nuh\nso explain to them\nokay explain making rules so let's kind\nof think about that okay\nso\nif i want to learn mathematics\nhow do i learn mathematics\nso by um\ndoing your homework doing class four\nfollow your teacher and\nthat's how you learn\nand if i'm not understanding in\nmathematics what is the way so let's say\nlike i'm a math teacher and i have a\nstudent and i give a lecture for like an\nhour and then i give the homework and\nthen the kid can't do the homework what\nshould i do next as the teacher\nso i\nask\nwhy he doesn't understand or she doesn't\nunderstand which way i mean what party\ndoes he or she doesn't understand\nexplain it more\nokay so do you ask your son\nwhy he spent so much time on the screen\nyes i did and he said that uh\nthere is nothing to do nothing else to\ndo except that\nokay\nand then what do you think about that\nso it's it's not right\nand i asked him some and i asked him i i\ni i put him for a basketball class\ntennis class\nall the sports club most of the sports\nclasses and he he does it he liked it\nbut at the end still he wants to be on\nhis phone\nokay so i'm a little bit confused\nbecause he says there's nothing to do\nand then you say like that for example\nyeah yeah that's not right i said yeah\nyou you can do chores at home like\ncleaning your room cleaning house\nyou know\nout is i mean playing with your friends\noutside doing exercising stuff like that\nbut he's not motivated for that\nokay why isn't he motivated for that\nwhy why\nwhy isn't he motivated to do the things\nthat you tell him to do\nwell because he thinks yeah he enjoys a\nlot on his phone\nbecause\nhow do you come to that conclusion\nuh like\nwhat do you mean by that how do i\nhow do you know why what you so you have\nan assumption\nthat he is not motivated to do things\nlike basketball even though he enjoys\nthem\nright\nbut like so it sounds like when i ask\nyou\nwhy he's like to explain his motivation\nit sounds to me like you're making an\nassumption about his motivation\nwhich is that he just likes the phone\nmore\nno because i i see again i see him that\nas soon as he finished that until you\nknow he's with basketball whatever what\nis whatever sports yeah as soon as he\nfinishes he wants to get to his phone\ni see him he wants to get it\nokay so now layla i'll i'll give you\nkind of like uh some\ninformation okay so you let me know what\nyou think about that so just like a math\nyou know if a math student\nis not learning math i think the right\nway to get them to understand is as a\nteacher don't just teach it again\njust like you said you have to ask them\nlike what part is confusing for them\nright\nso oddly enough like the right move for\na teacher in that situation is not to\ntell the student that they're wrong\nnot to explain it again but to try to\nunderstand the student's understanding\ndoes that make sense\nyes\nand so oddly enough what i'm kind of\nhearing is that you'll ask hey why do\nyou like the game but then\nas soon as he gives you an answer what\ni'm noticing you're doing is like you\njust kind of say that's wrong\nand you're not really like understanding\nhis perspective\nyou're just saying that his perspective\nis incorrect\ndoes that make sense\nso\nlet me ask you a question do you mean\nthat when he wants to get back to his\nphone\ni feel like it's wrong right yep\nso\nit is kind of wrong because he wants to\nget his phone right i mean for i mean\nsure 24 7. so\nif i don't\nyeah if i don't make him to do something\nexcept you know being on his phone then\nof course\nso yeah i know i need to tell him that\nbeing on on the phone it's not it's not\nright\nokay so let's see i don't think it means\nthat all of us i mean i i i as a as an\nadult i'm on my phone\nalso sometimes\nnot 24 students but i also\ni don't i don't say that he shouldn't be\non his phone\nno i this is not my point my point is he\ncan be on his phone he can you know go\nto\na play xbox he can be on a snapchat tick\ntock whatever but like\ni mean certain time\nnot all yes this is my opinion that's it\nyeah so let me i'm going to just toss\nout words and i'm going to kind of group\nthem okay\nso\nwhat you're describing is like you kind\nof telling him that this is wrong i'm\nnot saying you're wrong for saying that\nby the way okay\nso it's wrong you can order him you can\nmake him\nthat's like one camp right like there\nwere right and wrong it's black and\nwhite you have to do it that's like one\napproach the other approach involves\nmotivation understanding\nasking questions\ndo you see how like those two are like\ndifferent things yes\nso what what i'm kind of noticing is\nthat like you can force him to do stuff\nand he'll do it because you have more\npower in the relationship\nbut forcing him to do things is not how\nyou make someone understand right like i\nmean you're a parent yeah that's true\nright so and this is where like when you\nask him a question i don't really get\nthe sense that you're\ni think you need to ask the next\nquestion right so like help me\nunderstand like here's a question that i\nwould ask your son\nso\nit's been my observation that when you\nactually go to basketball you seem to\nenjoy it and i'll even ask you like hey\ndid you have a good time\nand that you know you do want to do well\nin school so like these things seem\nimportant to you and you seem to enjoy\nthem\nbut every time when i try to get you to\ndo something you resist me a lot\ncan you help me understand why you\nresist me so much like i'm kind of\nconfused because these two things don't\nline up for me\nwhat do you think about that question\nso i do i do it i do the same\nand what does he say\ngood job\nyeah i do it but he\nhe\nhe doesn't answer like you know\nhe doesn't have any answer he's like i\nenjoy it for example if i ask okay\nyou have a good time in a basketball or\nwhatever\nand i see you you enjoy it and then you\nwant it also you want it you like it but\nthen you as soon as you get home i see\nyou on the phone always\nand he said mom i i play and i enjoy now\ni wanted to spend time with my friends\nthat's that's all he says\nokay\nso that doesn't what you're saying\ndoesn't really sound like a question to\nme\nright it sounds to me like you're making\na point\ni know it's kind of weird\nbut like you're kind of\ni'm almost getting like\nthe subtitles\nfor what you're saying is you shouldn't\nbe on your phone\noh you mean instead of asking\ntelling him you shouldn't just i mean i\nthink what i'm hearing is that sometimes\nyou'll you remember earlier when we were\ntalking about like making requests\nversus giving orders\nyeah what i'm hearing is that when you\nask a question it's not really a\nquestion you're making a point with a\nquestion mark at the end\nwhat do you think about that well i i i\ndidn't think you know that it's like\nthat i thought this is like a kind of\nquestion\nyeah so so i understand\njust pointing to yeah yeah i mean that's\nsort of what i'm hearing and i'm\nconcerned that that's what he could be\nhearing too\nbecause what i'm hearing is sometimes\nhe'll give you answers\nand your response to his answers or his\nopinions\nis that's wrong\nyeah\nokay and so i'm just gonna like kind of\ni'll say it right so if you're like if\nyou're in a relationship where you share\nan opinion with someone\nand their response is that's wrong\ni'm not gonna want to continue to\ncommunicate with that person\nright my answers are just going to\nbecome simple\nthere's no like dialogue\nwhat do you think about that\nyeah\ni get it\nright so i'm not trying to make you feel\nlike a bad parent i i genuinely don't\nthink you're a bad parent i think what's\nhappening nowadays is that\nvideo conversation can makes a lot of\ndifference yeah yep and video game\naddiction\nrequires a sophistication of\ncommunication\nby parents\nthat we didn't need anymore\nneed in the past because there is so\nmuch dopamine there's so much addictive\nstuff like that's the way these apps are\ndesigned that's the way the games are\ndesigned and so as a parent we have to\nbe we have to have a sophistication of\nour communication that counters the\naddictiveness of devices\nyeah\ndoes that make sense\nyes\nso you know what i would say like if you\nwant some concrete advice because i get\nthe sense you want that for me so we'll\nlet's give you some it's to ask the next\nquestion\nright so and this is the kind of thing\nwhere if you don't understand if you\ndisagree with something or you think\nthat something is wrong\nit's okay for you to share that opinion\nbut i would try to understand his\nperspective just like a math teacher\nright so if like if i'm trying to teach\nsomeone an addition and they say two\nplus two is six and i say that's wrong\ntwo plus two is four and i can say that\n15 times but until i ask the student how\nare you getting two plus two equals six\ndoes that make sense like you have to\nunderstand like how they're getting to\nthe wrong conclusion in the first place\nbecause that's really when you can help\nthem understand how two plus two equals\nfour\nyeah so you know when i think you're\ndoing a lot of the right stuff right\nyou're asking him like why is it that\nyou don't you know you seem to like\nbasketball but you want to do snapchat\nand then he says well i just like being\nwith my friends\nright so and that could be a big part of\nit so this is where one of the things\nthat we've also noticed is that when we\nwork with parents\nwe help them try to\nask lots of questions that they may not\nthink about asking for with their kids\nso for example like maybe he gets\nbullied at basketball\ndo you know if that's the case\nno\ni isn't you know that he doesn't get\nbullied or you're not sure yeah yeah i\nknow that yeah because i i talk to him a\nlot\nand he tells me everything\nthe good things about my son is he tells\nme everything\nthat's very good if he gets upset i mean\nhe even if he doesn't talk\ni can i can and notice from his face and\nhis attitude and after i said there is\nthere anything you want to share with me\nhere start talking which is great wow\nthat's awesome how did you get to the\npoint where your son shares everything\nwith you well because since since the\nbeginning i talked to him a lot and i\nwas involved um\neverything with him\nand\ni i just talked to him a lot and i was\nvery friend and i never i mean never\npunished him like you know really you\nknow punished just i want him to be\nfriend with me not scared of me\nso\nwe have this good relationship at least\nhe tells me everything which is great\nyeah i mean i i think that it's clear\nthat you guys have a very good and\nloving relationship\nand at the same time\nit also sounds like sometimes you know\nyou're turning off pausing his devices\nand kind of pissing him off\nand so i wonder a little bit about\nhow that would affect his communication\nwith you\nwell\ni mean the good thing about my son is he\ngets mad easily but\nin a second he turns back to his\nyou know normal\nwhich is great yeah so he's really mad\nat me and you know right after he just\nyou know become quiet he's i mean very\neasily and then he\nhe continued\nwhich is good yeah\nso so it sounds like he doesn't hold on\nto the anger and he doesn't start to\nresent you and that you guys have a very\nsolid foundation of communication\nyeah so this is what i'd say layla i\nthink like this is where you know what i\nwould really do is is sit down with your\nson\nand ask him\n[Music]\nquestions like i don't know maybe you've\ndone this do you want me to force you to\ndo your homework\nhave you ever asked him that\nno i haven't\nwhat do you think would happen if you\ndid ask him that\nwell\ni never think about it\nyeah right so so like it's kind of a\ndifferent question right like what do\nyou think about that question\nso\nwhat was your call you said what what do\ni think he thinks\nno what do you what do you think about\nthe question do you want me to force you\nto do your homework how would you how do\nyou feel about that question is that\nlike you think it's a good i mean this\nis this is a good question this is great\nbut the thing is\nuh\ni don't know what it what he's gonna\nanswer\nthat's the thing yep\ndoes he have any answer for that\nyeah so so so the here's the thing laila\nthe questions you need to be asking your\nson are the ones that you don't know how\nhe's going to answer\nthat's exactly what you should be asking\nhim right because there's a fundamental\ndisconnect\nbetween\nhis view of things and your view of\nthings yes\nand in order to get on the same page\nwith your kid you can try to drag him\nover to your side as much as you want to\nwhich is what i think you've been doing\nthat's what most parents do right\nbut like i think this is the point where\nhe's not 12 anymore he's not 10 he's 14.\nhe's starting to form his own opinions\nhe's starting to have his own beliefs\nyes right\nand so it's really good that you guys\nhave this really solid foundation and so\ni think really like asking him questions\nthat you kind of don't know the answer\nto\nbecause you're you're a mother who knows\neverything about your son you can tell\nright\nyeah so now this is the point where he's\ngoing to start to be a little bit more\nclosed off because he's a 14 year old\nboy\nright he's like probably going through\npuberty and stuff so i'm sure\nyou know they're going to be like maybe\nthoughts or feelings that he has that\nmaybe he's not sharing with his mom\nbecause that's what 14 year old boys do\nwhen they go through puberty you\nwouldn't be there\nyes and so like this is the time where\nit's\ntime to start changing the way that you\ncommunicate with him yes and really\ntrying to understand his perspective\nso\nother things other like suggestions for\nconversations are just asking him you\nknow how important is school to you\ndo you want to do well in school\nyeah what do you think about those\nquestions\nthat's great yeah\nright so do you know did you talk to him\nabout that\nyes i did yes and he's he said what do\nyou think mom of course it is\nyeah he said of course it is it is\nimportant\nand then what do you say next\nyou know you know these kids what type\nof words they do i'm not dumb i'm not\nstupid or stuff like that they use\nbut you really don't know what's going\non in their brain that's the thing\nso when he says of course it's important\nwhat what do you say next\ni said okay if it's important then\nhow come that\nyou don't do this that you know no no\nsee that's an accusation layla you're\nlosing him right at that moment you see\nthat\nif it's important why don't you\nwhy don't you\nthat you're losing him right there\ndoes that make sense\nyes so instead i have to i have to say\noh then you should do this no no no no\nno no no no no no here's the thing okay\nhere's the one thing you got to do later\nyou're doing fantastic just got to\nchange one thing\nyou shouldn't say anything after that\nyou should ask another question\nokay\nright because he says of course it's\nimportant\nand then this is going to be kind of\nweird right and then you ask him help me\nunderstand why\nwhy is school important to you\nright because here's the thing in his\nmind there is a conflict\nschool is important and i want to play\nthe video game\nand so this is what happens with\nteenagers is the more you push him the\nmore he's going to push back\nand this is the thing right because like\nyou you ask him like hey is school\nimportant to you he says yes and then\nyou're like yay we win right\nleila he understands what he's supposed\nto understand he's giving you the right\nanswer\nand so then your mind you're like\neveryone charge let's attack then why\ndon't you do this like let's go like\nchange like you just gave me like you\ngave me an inch of ground so i'm gonna\ngo all in you kind of get what i'm\nsaying why don't you then you're like\nwhy don't you do this why don't you do\nthis and when you ask the question like\nwhen i why like for example we're gonna\ntry this okay leila so it's gonna maybe\njust be ready for it\nif i ask you with a question layla why\ndon't you ask why don't you try to\nunderstand your son better\nif i ask you that question how does it\nmake you feel\nyeah\nyeah i got it yeah you're right ah let's\narticulate it right because we can't see\nyour face right now i'm sure if we could\nsee your face we'd be able to see what\nyour answer is how does that make you\nfeel\nof course you know it's like kind of um\nforcing\nyeah\nright and so in a weird way like does\nthat inspire you to act do you feel like\ni'm on your team\ndo you feel like we're on the same team\nhere\nno\nright and so\nand this is the tricky thing about this\nlayla is like you're not wrong at all in\nfact you're 100 right\nand this is like where the\nsophistication of communication comes in\nbecause you're right that like you know\nspending like four hours a day on\nsnapchat is like not good for your kid\nyou know it's not good for your kid he\nknows it's it's not good for him\nhe understand like you don't think your\nkid understands that playing video games\nfor 10 hours a day on the weekend is\nlike a waste of his time\nyeah he gets that right yeah yes yeah on\nsome level he gets it\nyes and and the problem is like he's\naddicted\nso like he even like sometimes it he may\nnot be addicted i'm kind of using that\nsimply but even like people who are\naddicted like the whole point is that\nthey can't stop\nthey like they know it's bad but they\ncan't stop\nlike your son understands that like you\nknow he understands how like\nrelationships and dating and stuff works\nhe understands that if he spends 10\nhours a day on the weekends like on his\nphone instead of playing basketball and\nexercising like it's gonna be hard for\nhim to like date\nlike he's not an idiot\nyou with me\nyes\nand the problem though is that something\nis going on that has him retreating or\nescaping to the to the device\nand even to the point where he sort of\nrecognizes and i think this is part of\nthe reason that\nyou all have such a good relationship\nbecause a lot of things that you do to\nhim like would piss a lot of kids off\nright and he gets pissed off but he\ndoesn't hold on to it\nwhy doesn't he hold on to it because he\nrecognizes on some level that first of\nall you love him and secondly like what\nyou're doing what you're forcing him to\ndo is actually for his benefit and i\nsuspect he understands that what do you\nthink\nno he understand that yeah right so i\nthink that's why y'all's relationship is\nas good as it is and i think really all\nyou need to do is\nstart at like ask like one or two more\nquestions\nyou know because here's the cool thing\nlike i i i\nis it okay if i keep talking or you want\nto jump in or\nyes yeah okay yeah so like here's like\nso here's sequence number one you know\nhelp me understand like why do you play\nvideo games i thought you liked\nbasketball and he's like yeah or let's\nlet's talk about great so you say you\nknow is school important he says yes and\nthen like option one is like then why\ndon't you dot dot dot right and then he\nfeels kind of attacked he's like he kind\nof feels ashamed because you're right\nright like you're clearly making a good\npoint like you can't really argue\nagainst it and so he kind of shuts down\nand gives you a very short response\nfair am i\nokay so let's like look at option number\ntwo right which is like okay this school\nimportant to you says yes\nand then you can say help me understand\nwhy school is important to you what\nabout school is important to you and as\nyou get him to articulate he says well\nschool is important to me because like\nyou know i want to go to a good college\nand then it's like another question like\nwhy is going to a good college important\nto you like why do you want to go to\ncollege\nas you get him to articulate and bring\nout of him\nyeah you know what he really cares about\nand what he values in life\nthen you're setting yourself up and then\nyou kind of like the next you know the\nthird or fourth or fifth question that\nyou ask him is like\nso i'm a little bit confused because you\ntell me that you want to go to college\nbecause you want to be intellectually\nchallenged and that you want to make a\ndifference in the world\nand i'm kind of confused because like on\na day-to-day basis\nyour actions are not really like aligned\nwith that\nso as a parent i don't know\nwhat to do\ni don't know because on the one hand i\nwant to support you in all of these\ngoals which i think are the right goals\nbut every time and even i mean i know\nyou right and we're talking about this\nso i'd like to support you in these\nthings i'd like to help you get into a\ngood college\nbut when i try to do that like you seem\nto fight me and then i get stuck\nwhat do you think i should do about that\nand that's when he'll start to\nunderstand\nright because you're sort of explaining\nyour\nsituation to him you're not telling him\nwhat's right or wrong\nyou're almost\nrecruiting him to be on your side and\nyou're working with him you're like hey\nson this is a problem you and i have to\nsolve together\ndoes that make sense\nyes\nright and and i think that's when\nunderstanding is going to come\nyes yes i that yeah i i understand\nyou are right\nokay so let's just think about that for\na second\nif you agree with me\nhow did you unders did you understand\nthat at the beginning of the\nconversation\nyes\nokay\ni was a little bit confused by that\nbecause i was expecting you to say no so\ni feel like you've learned something\nover the course of our conversation am i\nwrong\nyou you said the the beginning of the\nconversation you mean the\nyou mean this conversation or the\nbeginning of our meeting our beginning\nof our meeting yeah\nso like\nlet's just so you've learned something\nover the course of our meeting right\nhow did you learn what have you learned\nlet's start there\nso i\nwell i learned that um\nhow\nuh to communicate better with my son\ninstead of you know because my actually\nmy\nconversation was\ndifferent then you just told me\ni have to start with question and then\nkeep continue until he\nhe tells me instead of i tell him and i\nforce him he starts to tell me\nand i get the words from here him\nmore than i talk to him or i mean more\nthan i thought and i taught\nbeautifully put layla i think that is\nthe essence of the goal that we set for\nour parents\nyeah which is instead of teaching your\nkid\nyes\nbring him to a point of understanding\nbecause as long as you're teaching him\nhe's on one side and you're on the\nopposite side yeah not in in stop\nlecturing\nlistening more i got it yeah so now\nlet's ask you a question\nhow did you learn that today\noh i i i learned honestly i learned\nespecially this you know that at the end\ni learned a lot\nbut how what did we do well you know i\nmean the thing is i mean\nuh our\ngeneration was way different than these\nnew generations so of course\nand the way that we grew it wasn't like\nthat and then basically we use kind of\nour\num\nour parents\nmanner\nand then use it for our kids\nabsolutely\nyeah and that's why we need more\nuh\nmore help and more um so\nsorry to interrupt i wouldn't say what\nyou're doing is wrong\nno no no i mean i i didn't i don't mean\nit's wrong like you know\njust the way\ndifferent ways\nyeah i i cause i i think i would just\nthat that degree of judgment\nlaila concerns me a little bit because i\ndon't think what you're doing is wrong\ni think it's insufficient\nfor the current challenges that you're\nof the world\ni agree yes\nyou know\nand so maybe i explained yeah you\nexplained a bit and maybe mine was a\nlittle bit confusing yes no no i i\nthat too i think it's like this is the\npoint of communication right is we just\nmake sure we're kind of on the same page\nand\nand so the other point that i was kind\nof making is that like you know over the\ncourse of this conversation\n[Music]\nmost of what i've been doing is like\nasking questions\nyes\nright and i think that's like to\nillustrate the point of like that's\nwhere understanding comes from yeah yeah\nand and it's kind of giving you stuff to\nplay with is what i\ncall it right like i'm not saying like\nso for example when i gave you two\noptions and i like okay here's\ncommunication style one hey do you think\nschool is important yes then why don't\nyou do it here's communication style\nnumber two\num you know\ndo you think school is important yes\ntell me why it's important to you and\nkeep on asking questions and then i\ndon't tell you which one is right\nright i'm not saying one is good and one\nis bad i'm saying hey here are two\noptions which one do you like more\nand that's what in my experience that's\nwhat brings out the understanding is\nthat it comes from a place that like it\nsounds like your son and you have a\nreally solid relationship it sounds like\nyou'll have a really solid foundation it\nsounds like he's a smart kid\nand so i think interestingly enough like\nnow that he's 14\ninstead of teaching him stuff you can\nactually rely on him to like figure\nthings out for himself\nyeah just guide him\nabsolutely like give him the questions\nnot the answers\nbecause i think he he'll i mean he knows\nthe answers you baked that into him you\nknow he understands and that's why he\ndoesn't fight you he doesn't hold on to\nresentment because deep down he knows\nyou're right\nand and helping him so you don't\nactually need to teach him anything he\nalready understands it you just need to\nbring his understanding to the surface\nand sometimes the way that we\ncommunicate with our kids\nresults in like denial or defensiveness\nand when you say something that causes\nhim to kind of like\npull back and put up a wall like then\nthere's not going to be understanding\ndoes that make sense\nyes you're going to get these like\nbecause i want to mom like he's going to\nget you these really crappy\nshort answers that are like hard to\nengage in right he's like kind of\nshutting down the conversation\nyeah\nthat's true\nso um\ni feel like we've covered some decent\nground today and that we're at like kind\nof decent kind of pausing point or even\nstopping point\nhow do you feel\nwell it was great for me it was very\ngood conversation and i learned a lot\nfrom from that\nare are there any questions that you\nhave remaining i mean we still have some\ntime if you want it but like any\nquestions that you have or any other way\nthat i can potentially be of help well i\ni want to know uh about this is this\ncourse can be continuing or is just one\none time\noh no no so yeah so let me tell you a\nlittle bit about our parent program so\nhere's what we try to do\nwe have a 12-week course okay so every\nweek there's like a lecture\nand the the topics of the lecture are\nfirst of all communication and alliance\nbuilding so our approach is first and\nforemost how to communicate effectively\nwith your child and more importantly how\nto build what we call an alliance so\ni'll just give you an example like once\nyou talk to your kid\nabout why school is important to them\nthen any kind of limit that you set\nis not because you think it's good\nthe reason you're setting these limits\nare because of what they care about\nhey you've told me that you want to go\nto a good college because you want to\nstudy\nyou want to be a doctor one day\nso\nit's because i support your goal that i\nhave to turn off the internet at 10\no'clock\nit's not about what i want it's actually\nabout what you want and then what\nhappens is kids or once you build an\nalliance with your kid\nthe\nthey're going to be a lot less resistant\nto the boundaries that you set so the\nfirst thing is communication\nunderstanding and getting on the same\nteam with your kid it's not even about\nrestricting to two hours a day or ten\nhours a day or five hours a day or\nanything like that that's where everyone\nwants to start is like how do i get my\nkids to play less video games we don't\nstart there we start by communication\nand alliance building\nthen what we do is we teach you how to\nset good boundaries\nso like\nit kind of goes into like you know once\nwe understand communication then how do\nyou set an effective boundary and that's\nwhere we also like want to bring your\nkid into the boundary setting so you can\nsay hey uh son here are my goals for you\ni want you to exercise you know what\nyou've said is important to you\num i want you to do chores and you say\nyou don't want to so like maybe there's\nsome wiggle room there and you say you\nwant to do well on school but you also\nsay that because if you talk to your kid\nyou'll also discover things like maybe\nthey are getting bullied at school or\nmaybe they feel embarrassed about their\nacne or maybe they're overweight or\nwhatever and that's the reason that he\nspends so much time online with his\nfriends because it's hard for him to\nmake friends in real life\nso there may be all kinds of stuff going\non it sounds like your son communicates\nwith you so maybe less important in your\ncase but for a lot of parents there are\nthings that they don't know about their\nkids so once you understand what drives\nhim towards the video game\nit can help you set healthy boundaries\nright because now you understand like\nwhy he's resisting why he's fighting\nand so then we try to help people set\nyou know very kind of like detailed\nboundary setting plans so like you know\nwhen are you going to play what are you\ngoing to play what's more important to\nyou so that's like a question that we\nencourage our parents to ask a lot you\nknow i understand that you want to play\ngames with your friends like is it more\nimportant to like stay up late on friday\nnights or play an hour with them or two\nhours with them every day like which one\nis more important to you\nand so once you sort of start to get\nlike what they care about you can even\nlike so then they kind of know that\nyou're like sort of trying to support\nthem right you understand what they want\nand you're setting limits but you're not\nsetting limits that you you know\nhe has to do his homework but whether he\ndoes his homework\nan hour every day or all over the\nweekend like he can sort of decide that\nif that makes sense\nyes so you want you want to enroll him\nmake him a part of the process of the\nlimit setting\nyou know it's kind of like no taxation\nwithout representation like you want to\ngive him a voice\nin the limit setting in the boundaries\nyeah\nand then we'll we'll sort of help you\nset boundaries and we'll help you\ntroubleshoot boundaries because at the\nend of the day like they're thing you\nknow you can set these boundaries and\nhe's not going to listen to him and then\nhow do you have conversations with him\nhow do you set limits on him how do you\ndraw the line how do you enforce things\nand then also we'll give you like\ncommunication tips and sort of like you\nknow how to have those conversations\nthe other big thing that we do in the\nprogram is we help decompress your\nemotions this is a huge thing\nso you know these little things like\nbecause in the back of your mind if you\njust you know layla what i get the sense\nof is that you just don't like him being\non his phone you just don't like it\nand that kind of feeling is gonna\ntranslate in your words and in your tone\nand so even when he does everything that\nyou ask him to you're not gonna be happy\nand he's gonna feel that\nwhich means that when he does what you\nask him to\nit there's not really like a positive\nemotional reinforcement because you're\nnot truly happy\ndoes that make sense\nyes so you're gonna say good job but\nyou're gonna say it with a little bit of\nlike\nit's not gonna be like hey awesome job\nit's gonna be like good job\ni know you did it today but i'm not\nreally happy on the inside good job does\nthat make sense\nyes yes so we want we don't want those\nemotions to to come out with\nwith your kid we want you to bring those\nemotions into our program and let them\ncome out with the other parents\nwork on that like work on your fear for\nyour child we haven't really talked\nabout this but a lot of parents will be\nlike afraid right like what happens when\nmy kid goes to college and i'm not there\nto force him what's gonna happen and all\nof that fear that you hold all of that\nfrustration that you hold we want you to\nprocess it with us\nso that when you are talking with your\nkid when you're interacting with your\nkid you can be calm you can be collected\nyou can be focused and disciplined\nbecause he's going to feed off of your\nenergy\nand so it's a 12-week program where\nthere's lectures but then we also have\nyou all meet for 90 minutes a week in\naddition lecture you can watch on your\ntime it's like a video\nand we're gonna teach you a lot of stuff\nso we'll also teach you about like\nmarijuana usage and autism spectrum\ndisorder and like how to understand like\nwhat questions to ask your kids and what\nkind of games your kids like and there's\na lot like information about video game\naddiction how video games affect your\nchild's brain how they affect their\npsychology how they affect their\nself-esteem\num you know how to have conversations\naround self-esteem and your kid feeling\nlike they're a failure or whatever\nthere's a bunch of stuff in there and\nthen for 90 minutes a week we're going\nto give you guys opportunities to\npractice so you're going to have a coach\nand you all will do things like role\nplay you're going to practice you know\nnot using the word should why don't you\ndo this then you should do this we're\ngoing to give you like literally like a\nchance to practice those communication\nskills\nand support each other as parents and\nwhat we really see is that at the end of\n12 weeks\nparents who are able to actually commit\nto the program their relationship is\nvery different with their kids\nokay it sounds great and then how okay\nis it something um\nhow much we should pay for is it\nsomething we have to pay for it or it's\nyeah i actually don't know the price but\nit is something that you have to pay for\num if you guys you know if you're in a\nposition of financial hardship just kind\nof let us know\nsometimes we have subsidy funds for\npeople who can't afford afford it yeah\num let me actually try to figure out\nwhat the price is\ni think it may be like oh i don't want\nto misquote\nlet me see if i can ask it should say\nyeah so the cost is fifty dollars a week\nfifty dollars\nyep\na week and then uh\nhow about the other the one that you\nsaid there is someone i mean i mean how\nabout the 90 minutes\nyou said once a week 90 minutes what's\nthat\nthat's all part of the course so what we\ndo in our courses there's a there's\ngoing to be a lecture that you watch\nand then there's 90 minutes of like\ngroup work\nit's going to be role play skills\npractice processing your own emotions\ntalking to other parents\ntroubleshooting communication issues\ntroubleshooting boundary issues\nand like you got to do both\nyeah and then and then uh is it uh that\none also covered by this or yeah yeah\nit's all included\nso our experience has been that set like\nletting people just watch a series of\nlectures is not actually like that\neffective what's really effective\nbecause you have an individual case with\nyour child right\nso like you can watch a lecture but\nadapting the principles of the lecture\nto your individual case requires like\nactual individual support so we have a\ngroup that every you know there'll be\nlike somewhere between like six and\neighty all usually\nso like we're gonna get like like let's\nsay seven parents together once a week\nfor 90 minutes where you guys will learn\nthe practical application of the theory\nthat you learn in the lectures okay any\nquestions that you guys have any trouble\nthat you run into we want to support you\nthrough all that because like you know\nin the lecture i may say like you know\nask this question but then if if your\nkid's answer is like something that's\nunexpected then like\nwhat do you do about that\nright you may not know so that's why we\nhave the group every week so you can\ncome in and you can talk to your coach\nand you can say hey i asked my kid do\nyou care about school and he said no\nnow i don't know what to say i don't\nknow what to do\nyou know and so like we want to help you\ntroubleshoot your individual situation\nand practice these skills\nokay and also do they uh kid also\ninvolve at some point or\nno cheating involved no so so most of\nour clients actually laila are your kids\nso we've had like\n7 000 kids come through our program but\ntheir program is different\nmm-hmm\nfor them\nuh so like we work on things like\nmotivation\nyou know figuring out what you want to\ndo with your life things like that but\nyou have to be at least 16 to enter that\nprogram\nbecause kids have to want to change\nso\nokay and that's where we like you know\nmost of what we try to help because like\nhere's the thing you know your kid\nwants to do well in life right but like\nhe may be addicted so even internally\nhe's like conflicted so we try to help\npeople work through their internal\nconflict\nyeah\ngreat so okay\noh sorry we've had 10 000 people come\nthrough\nmy wife is correcting me\nand then\nso sh\nwhen i decided to do this course 12 week\ncourse\nhow i can register or you know do i have\nto is there anyone we'll send you so i\nthink you've been talking to someone in\nour organization we will send you\ninformation\nokay\nsounds good\nyeah\nany other questions\nthat's it thank you so much it was very\nnice to meeting you and pleasure to talk\nto you i\ni learn a lot honestly and i'm sure if i\ncontinue i\ni do learn more\nyeah so leila i just want to say thank\nyou so much for coming on i think the\nsituation that you're in\nis very representative of what people\nother parents in the program have\nexperienced which is that you're you're\na good parent\nyou have a good kid\nvideo game addiction or technology use\nor screen use has like really gotten out\nof hand during the pandemic\nand like the things that used to work\nfor parents just aren't enough anymore\nand so\nyou know what we really try to do is\nempower y'all to like navigate this\ntricky world this digital world\nwith a little bit more kind of\ncommunication support a little bit more\nunderstanding and to really like get on\nthe same team with your kid\nwhich often times is not about them\nunderstanding it's just as often about\nyou understanding\nso thank you so much\nthank you\nthank you i really appreciate your time\nyeah thanks a lot take care layla\nyou too bye bye\nall right chat what did y'all think\nright\ngood huh so this is why we love like we\nlove working with parents like i love\nworking with parents\nabsolutely love it\nright yeah i i wasn't expecting her to\nask all the stuff about the sales pitch\nlike i just you know i didn't even know\nif she's gonna sign up for the pro i\nas you guys could tell there was a\nmiscommunication about her kind of\ncoming on and what she was coming on for\ni didn't know that she was even\ninterested in the program\nbut\ni think like this it's it's a prime\nexample of like you know parents\nwant to do really well right\nthe the problem is that like\nwhen they're emotionally like so scared\nfor their children\nany time the kid gives them an inch the\nparent goes all in right any it's like\nit's like the kid is forming a dam and\nif there's a crack in the damn like the\nwater's coming all the way out and so\nthe parents are going to use any crack\nthey can then why don't you do this\ndon't you see don't you see and i'm\nreally glad i hope layla doesn't feel\nlike you know a bad parent i think\nsometimes when we point out things that\nwe believe are mistakes it can make\npeople feel kind of bad i think she's a\nfantastic parent but this is the thing\nthat we've really discovered is that\nlike it's just changing your\ncommunication\nyou can change it changes the\nrelationship entirely by understanding\nlike what to say and when to say it\nand it's like because it sounds like\nshe's got a really good relationship\nwith her kid i don't know that he's\ntelling her everything by the way but\nyou know maybe\nyou know maybe that's me projecting\nbut you know\nbut i thought it was really fantastic\nshe was super open-minded\num really cares about her kid you know\nhas tried a lot of stuff we can really\nhear that she kind of gets at her wits\nend right and like ultimately like she\ncan't let her kid fail\nlike so she has to pull the plug and\nthat's not her fault\nyou know she's like she tries to do it\ni do think there's a little bit more\nabout the request versus the order which\ni think she's sometimes mixing up so i\nthink that's probably also creating\nconfusion with her kid because she'll\nphrase things like a request but they're\nactually in order and then there's like\nnot really transparent communication and\nthen that's gonna discourage the kid\nfrom like participating because you mean\none thing and you're saying something\nelse\nand so if that's the dynamic of your\ncommunication your kid isn't gonna like\nreally\nyou know they're gonna say one thing and\nthey're gonna mean something else too\nand that's just frustrating for everyone\ninvolved because they're going to say\nlike yeah i'll do my chores but they\nmean something else because the dynamic\nof your communication is that we say one\nthing we say what we're supposed to\nbut we really mean something else\nwe say what we're supposed to which is\noh please do your chores\nplease\nbut inside it's like better do your\nchores\nright so then your kid is going to play\nthe same damn game they're going to be\nlike oh yeah of course mom i'll do my\nchores but inside i'm never going to do\nmy chores it's the same thing the kids\nare going to learn whatever\ncommunication style\nyou teach them\nright\nand so that's why when you start\nexpressing an interest in understanding\ntheir viewpoint something magical\nhappens\nthey will start expressing an interest\nin understanding yours\nthey take their cues from you\nkids take their cues from parents that's\nlike\neven mannerisms and stuff\nlike my grandmother does this thing\nwhere she like has this really big sigh\nevery time she sits down she's like oh\nand i even noticed like\nearly on my my older kid spent a lot of\ntime with my grandmother and she started\ndoing it too you'd have this like 18\nmonth old that would be like ah\nman\nlike what a day\nright it was like an 18 month old kid\nit's hilarious so they learn from you\nthey take their cue from you\nit's great it's it's neat seeing like uh\nan 18 year old with like grandmother\nmannerisms\num yeah she doesn't do it anymore\nunfortunately\nokay\nany questions from y'all\ni just have a request from you it's only\nundeniable yeah\nokay this is great this is the maybe the\nfirst time in in\nin uh in our history that you guys don't\nhave questions which is fantastic\num\nyeah the interview just ended medium\ndawn you can catch the vod though i'm\nsure\nat healthy gamer gg how do i become a\nparent\nokay that's a whole different stream\nokay so we're gonna have a talk about\nthe birds and the bees one day\nsomeone posted on our subreddit they're\nlike\nyou should do a talk about sex ed i\nthink we may have to do that at some\npoint i actually like do a quick bit so\nfor my patients who are like teenagers\nand young adults like i give them the\ntalk which is not like a\nanyway it's like about birth control and\nstuff like that and it it's pretty good\ni mean sometimes people will be like wow\ni'm so glad this may be like the most\nuseful you know hour we've ever spent\ntogether so we we may try to put that\ntogether for y'all\num\ntwitch sure\nno i mean like but seriously like this\nis important stuff right like so\nso we'll we'll think about that we'll\nsee if it's it may be against tos so\nmaybe we can't do it i don't know\nso we'll see\nokay who are you rating chat\nso what happens when when the kid says\nno i don't like school no no so we don't\njust let it be then we ask them\nwhat don't you like about school\nright help me understand like what's\nwhat don't you like about school\nand then it's like once we understand\nokay like here are the problems with\nschool\num then\nyou know\nthat then like then you'll explore right\nbecause that that's when you really\nuncover the problems oh like the reason\ni don't like school is because i'm\ngetting bullied and it's like then\nyou're like you know that's big\nso you know if they say they don't like\nschool that's actually a really\nimportant discovery on your part because\nthen like no wonder you're fighting an\nuphill battle it like trying to get them\nto go to school\nwe're gonna raid minx\nyeah let's write somewhere with one\nviewer who's got one viewer chat\nthe sushi dragon\nuh what is sushi dragon doing\ni can't tell music\nsushi dragon\nyeah what if the answer for why the kid\ndoesn't like school is just something\nlike boring that's a great so then you\ncan say what's boring about it what are\nyou interested in when did school become\nboring is a really important question so\nour coaches do a lot of this work with\nour clients so not the parents but uh\nbut the y'all basically right so the 10\n000 people that have come through our\ncoaching program because a lot of y'all\nare bored by stuff my job is boring i\nfeel unmotivated\nyou know like so like then you dig into\nthat stuff so like help me understand\nwhat are you excited by help me\nunderstand when school\nstop when school became boring what\nhappened when school became boring and\noftentimes what you'll find is like\nyou'll uncover other things like oh it\nturns out that your kid has adhd and so\nthe reason that school is boring is\nbecause they literally can't pay\nattention and it gets like\nthey don't they're just sitting there\nand everything that they're being taught\nis like\nyou know fl flying like right through\ntheir brain and nothing sticks and so no\nwonder school would be boring\nso sometimes we also devalue that which\nwe fear we are not good at\nso i did this when i was kind of\nbecoming a monk or trying to become a\nmonk where i was like i suck at life so\nlet me just say that life is not worth\nyou know is not worth it so i'm gonna\nrise above all this materialistic crap\nand i'm gonna be unattached from grades\nand worldly success because that's for\npeople who are\nspiritually\nyou know bereft of any kind of\nspirituality they're so materialistic\nand the reason that i get f's is because\ni am better than them right so like you\ndevalue things that you're afraid you\nsuck at\nand so that's\nyou know so like when kids say boring\nlike let's try to understand what's\nreally underneath that\nright and sometimes they'll like you\nknow school will be boring so we see\nthat too where like the kids are not\nchallenged at school and so my solution\nthere is like okay try to find your kid\nlike an internship somewhere like what\ndo what is exciting to them maybe they\nwant to volunteer at like an animal\nshelter or maybe they want to like go to\nspace camp or like you know you can do\nother things as a parent to support them\nyou can say hey i want to help you what\ncan we do that would be less boring and\nthe cool thing is it's not really about\nfinding out the solution it's just that\nonce they understand as a child that you\nas a parent are genuinely trying to help\nthem and following their lead about what\nneeds to change in their life that's\nwhen we really see a really strong\nalliance built and then even as a parent\nlike once they know you're in their\ncorner you can even say like hey even\nthough i know it's boring for you\ni still think it's really important that\nyou do this and then the kid is like\nokay fine it's bizarre like they just\nwon't fight you as much\nokay i don't know what this what's going\non with sushi dragon\nthis sounds this seems weird\nso\nwhat is this\ndizzy onion\nby the way anyone playing lost ark\nhey are you already waiting can i just\nquit yeah hey so i saw some of you guys\nin chat said that like you know you wish\nthat your parents could experience\nsomething similar\nso if you guys um want to help us get\nthe word out that would be really cool\nbecause we've got 108 spots and we're\nstarting november 11th\num and our coaches are really excited so\nwe're hoping that we can get enough\nparents\nin the program um so anything you all\ncan do to help us get the word out that\nwould be awesome i think the command is\nin discord here\nwhat\nsorry not discard in chat\noh\nyeah so you know you guys can reverse\nuno your parents so what often times\nhappens is our p we'll get phone calls\nfrom parents and they're like can i sign\nup my kid for coaching and we say no you\ncan't this kid has to want to sign up\nfor coaching and then the parents are\nlike screw you and then we're like maybe\nyou should sign up for coaching and\nthey're like screw you i'm not the one\nwith the problem my kid is the one with\nthe problem we're like no actually you\nshould sign up so you all can reverse\nuno them\nright and you can be like hey hey\nparents i think you should sign up for\nthis thing\nuh yeah so if you want to reverse enter\nthem awesome but also like you know\ngetting their whatsapp groups and stuff\nlike that that'd be really cool they're\nfacebook groups etc so the the other\nthing that's really neat about this\nsorry can i keep going yep i'm excited\nokay good okay great the other thing\nthat's really cool about this is our\ncoaches love working with parents yeah\nso we were surprised like we have like\nother kinds of coaching opportunities\nlike content creation and things like\nthat but the coaches themselves are\nsuper excited\nwith working with parents and the\ncoaches are like y'all they're from like\nour community right\nso i was a little bit surprised by how\neager they are to like help parents like\nconnect with their kids so it's actually\nreally like fantastic\num\nhow old do our kids have to be to\nqualify for coaching for parent\noh so so parent coaching is sort of\ndivided in two ways\num\ni think like if your kid is younger than\na teenager maybe you may get a little\nbit less out of it but basically we try\nto think about two groups so this is\nwhat we call pre-insight and\npost-insight basically does your kid\nknow they have a problem or not\nmore practically it's kind of like the\ntwo camps are like under 18 like kids\nthat are living at home maybe a little\nbit older and then over 18 is kind of\nwhat those are the two groups and\ngenerally speaking\nthe experiences and struggles and\nchallenges that parents face are quite\ndifferent so if you've got a 14 year old\nlike that's really different from having\na 24 year old you know\nbut i'd say like\nyou know under not like 10 because a big\npart of this remember is like\ncommunication\nso if your kid is not old enough to be\nable to like really like answer\nquestions or like internalize like\nunderstand what's going on inside them\nthen it may not be as effective we\nactually don't have great data on like\nkids under 10 for example so i don't\nknow if it would actually help parents\nin that situation\num it's really geared towards like\nbecause remember this is a program that\nwas built off of our work with y'all\nright so what we did is like ask\nourselves\nnow that we understand what being a\ngamer is like\nwhat how can we equip parents to deal\nwith us with twitch chat basically\nokay so there seems to be some cool\nmusic going on from chris taylor\nto layer\nso check that out\ni'd like to learn how to better\ncommunicate with my autistic son yeah so\nthen you can definitely\ni don't know how old your son is but\nwe do have so this was a big part that\nwe added in this most recent launch\nwe added a section on neurodiversity\nwhere we talk a little bit about autism\nunfortunately it's been my experience\nthat you cannot\ni guess you could but\nautism is such a\nvaried presentation\nthat we can't have like a communication\nguide for autism right because different\npeople on the autism spectrum their\ncommunication abilities are going to be\nlike wildly different\nso that's where\nyou know you can absolutely learn the\nprinciples but then you need to adapt\nthose principles or filter them through\nwhatever limitations your your child\nactually has so like some kids with\nautism are non-verbal completely right\nso\nwhat we teach you is gonna like not\nreally work very well other kids will be\nlike hyper logical\nand may need a lot of concrete stuff so\nyou can't really ask them like questions\nabout\nyou know it's going to be hard for them\nto answer questions about internal\nfeelings and motivation and stuff like\nthat you have to really make things like\nconcrete\nso there are a lot of like different\nadaptations but the tricky thing is that\nthose tend to be very individualized\nyeah so it's tough um we're working on\nit\num but so we do have some information\nbut but the real answer and i hate to\nsay this but as much as i want to say\nthat our program can fix all problems i\nhate to say this but my actual\nrecommendation to parents in the program\nis they can learn some\nbut then it's really to take the\nprinciples that we teach\nand filter them through your your\nchild's actual communication\npattern\nand sometimes that involves like\ncollaborating with a clinician ideally\num okay\noh yeah so some people are asking and\nand i think dana mentioned that so\nsometimes we'll have like both parents\nshow up\nand uh i i told this story uh recently\nbut sometimes it's funny because like\nthis is hilarious so we were doing i was\nrunning a group session with the parents\ni was giving a lecture or something\nand in the background right so the\nparents like i'm like there's a laptop\nand then there's a couch and both of the\nparents are sitting on the couch\nand so i'm giving this lecture and i can\nsee them you know on the zoom call and\nthen in the background i see like like a\nteenage kid like a teenage boy like walk\nby and the kid like does a double take\nand then he like asks his parents and\nhe's like is that dr k\nand then the parents are like do you\nknow who this is\nand then the kid is like do you know who\nthis is\nand then he like got freaked out and he\nleft and it's like hilarious\nright\num\nso\nwe we oftentimes get both parents\nand that's totally fine\nyeah so that's as a tour that's one of\nmy favorite stories about parent\ncoaching\nbut um yeah right that's how we know\nwe've made it it's like when the parents\nhave heard of us and the kids have heard\nof us but that's really like our point\nright it's like be a healthy gamer we're\nnot we're and that's\ndon't worry chat we've got your back\nbecause i don't know if you guys caught\nthis but nowhere did i tell layla like\nyeah he's gotta stop playing video games\nyou know nowhere did i say that we don't\nand so sometimes parents are like\nyou know it's really about supporting\nyour kid in achieving their goals\nand helping them form like healthy\ngaming habits"
