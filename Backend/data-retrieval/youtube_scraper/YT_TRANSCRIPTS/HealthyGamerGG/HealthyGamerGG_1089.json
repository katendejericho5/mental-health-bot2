    "transcript": "so then someone's asking how do we get\nover that pain it's the wrong kind of\nthinking that's that's the thought that\ngets keeps you stuck you don't get over\nthe pain how can i do a dopamine detox\nwhile having depression and porn\naddiction\nwell that's the only time you can do\ndopamine detox\num\nwhat i would think is actually a harder\nquestion to answer is how can i do a\ndopamine detox when i'm meditating on at\na monastery on top of a mountain for 30\ndays like that's harder\nso when thinking about what i do on a\ndaily basis i wake up watch porn go to\nmy computer play video games watch\nyoutube go to go to my bed scroll\nthrough social media go back to my\ncomputer play video games watch youtube\ngo to back to my bed watch porn and so\non\nright\na a truly glorious life when i try to do\nanything other than these highly\ndopaminergic activities like meditation\nyoga exercise socializing cooking\nreading hiking all the healthy stuff\nall i can think about is is this over\nyet can i go back to my computer yet\nbecause i find almost zero enjoyment in\nthese other activities it feels like i\nhave no competing interests that rival\nyoutube video games or porn i have zero\ninterest or desire in doing anything\nbesides these three things when i\nattempt doing a dopamine detox i can't\nlast for more than a day\nmy life has been like this for years i\nused to enjoy making art and i still\nwant to be an artist but i just don't\nreally enjoy making art anymore and i\nfind it boring and pretty much pointless\nthese last few years\ni'm currently attending college right\nnow mainly to avoid having a job and it\nfeels like i'm only capable of doing the\nabsolute bare minimum it feels like i'm\ntrapped in these dopaminergic activities\nand my brain won't let me do anything\nelse any advice\nso\nthis is unfortunately a common problem\nwhere people are stuck in a dopaminergic\ncycle\nof youtube pornography video games\nsocial media sleep\nsometimes addictions are thrown thrown\nin marijuana use alcohol what have you\nvaping you know\nso a lot of people are in this situation\nand so they're like i don't know how to\nstop this\nanytime i try to do this the healthy\nstuff it's boring\nall my mind thinks is i can't stop when\nwhen is this going to be over when is\nthis going to be over when is this going\nto be over when can i get back to the\ndopaminergic stuff that kills my soul\nbut satisfies my brain\nit's a big problem so this is what the\nnyana yog approach will be okay so we're\ngoing to take a different tac a\ndifferent approach to this question\nso\nwhat nyani yogi would say is like what\nare you expecting\nwhen you cook or you read or you go for\na hike or you socialize like what are\nyou looking for\nwhat do you think that's going to feel\nlike\nare you doing these activities expecting\nit to do anything except for suck\nbecause that's what's going to happen if\nyour brain is addicted to dopamine all\nthese activities are going to suck\nthey're gonna be awful\nit's gonna be terrible\nlike that people will say like oh i\ntried doing this stuff but it's not as\nfun as youtube or\nvideo gaming yeah it's never going to be\nthat's why youtube and video games are\nlike\nyou know pornography\nare taking over the world\nbecause they are by definition more\ndopaminergic and more behaviorally\nreinforcing than cooking\nit's not like no one's like i'm addicted\nto cooking\ni'm addicted to hiking dr k help me i'm\naddicted to hiking i just can't stop\nevery time i go for a hike\ni rest for a little while and it's like\ni gotta i gotta go out and buy celery\nand make myself a salad oh my god i\ncan't stop\nno one gets addicted to that stuff\nright because it's not addictive so\nfirst question is like what are you\nexpecting\nlike are you expecting this stuff to be\nfun are you expecting it to like\ngive you instant gratification like\nyoutube or pornography like you think\ntalking to another human being is going\nto feel anything like\npornography feels\nand so the first thing you've got to\nreally ask yourself is what are you\nexpecting out of doing these activities\nare you waiting because this is what i\noftentimes see is that people are like\nwaiting\nto get the dopamine hit from the reading\nthey're like how many days do i need to\nread\nbefore i get the same dopamine hit that\ni get from playing a video game\nand then yana yogi would say you're\nnever gonna get the same dopamine head\nso then the question then you're like\nokay well if i'm never gonna get the\nsame dopamine hit like then what what do\ni do and that's where nyanio comes in\nagain\nand so then then the question is like\nwhat do you want your life to be\nright so if you want your life to be a\ncycle of youtube video games and\npornography then by all means do what\nyou're doing\nif you want your life to be something\nelse like having a fulfilling\nrelationship not being filled with shame\nbeing able to go to sleep being proud of\nthe way that you look\nif you want some of those things then\nthis is not going to be the pathway to\ndo it\nand then you're going to say well like\nthose things are hard and it's like yeah\nlike that's the price\nright so then at some point\nyou have to internally decide\nwhat's more important to you\ndo you want to\nhave your mind be not bored on a daily\nbasis\nis that the most important thing to you\nthen by all means continue living the\nlife you're living\nor are you willing to tolerate\nsome boredom or a lot of boredom for the\nsake of some of these other things and\nreally ask yourself the question don't\njust default to yeah of course so that's\nwhat i want to do it's what i should do\ni think\nit's what everyone else does if your\nmind is producing answers like that you\ndon't actually want it it's just you\nthink it's better\nright but that's not actually what you\nwant to and this is where dionyo comes\nin so you really have to look at\nyourself and ask yourself genuinely what\nis more important to me\nif i had a choice between having no\ndopamine and being bored out of my mind\nbut i had made art at the end of the\nyear versus a year of like losing myself\nin video gaming pornography and youtube\nwhich one would i pick\nand then if you say to yourself i would\npick the art and so okay interesting so\nthat means that you\nhave to be bored for a year so let's\nstart today and then what does your mind\nsay well i don't like this okay so like\nthat's the choice that you have do you\nwant to make choices that your mind\nlikes\nor do you want to make choices that your\nmind dislikes\nthis is the path of nyan yog\nthis is something that we work a lot on\nin coaching you guys saw the you know we\neven someone was asking about coaching\nresources earlier\nso we streamed one of our coach\ntrainings and one of our our important\ncoach trainings is about goal-setting\nand motivation\nto help people navigate this internal\nstruggle\nbecause when people lack motivation like\nyou really have to look at yourself and\nrealize that you don't lack motivation\nit's just pointed in the wrong direction\nyou're very motivated this person is\nhighly highly motivated\nthey're very motivated to watch\npornography play video games and and you\nknow watch youtube\nto the exclusion of all these other\ndimensions in their life when your life\nis going to hell in all of these\ndifferent ways that's not a sign of a\nlack of motivation it's a sign of very\nvery high motivation because you're\nsacrificing so much\nyou're ruining every other dimension of\nyour life so like you have to be highly\nhighly like just think about how\nmotivated you have to be to like ruin\nthings that are important to you you\nhave to be really motivated\nis it not healthy sure it's not healthy\nno one's saying it's healthy but let's\nbe honest with ourselves about where our\nmotivation is actually pointed\nthis is the first problem that people\ndon't understand is they think i'm not\nmotivated misdiagnosis just think about\nhow successful you're going to be if you\ndiagnose yourself as a lack of\nmotivation when in fact what you have is\ntoo much motivation how successful do\nyou think you're going to get at getting\nout of that problem\nit's like like the opposite diagnosis\nright it's the exact opposite it's like\nlike if you're hungry\nif you if you don't realize you're\nhungry and you think you're full all the\ntime and you're wondering like what's\ngoing on i'm full i'm full i'm full and\nyou're actually always hungry like\nyou're never gonna fix that problem\nyou're like i need to eat less i need to\neat less i need to eat less when\nactually you're hungry the whole time\nso everyone's like trying to figure out\nhow do i find motivation you don't need\nto find motivation you need to get rid\nof motivation\nthat's why everyone's so damn stuck all\nthe time\nbecause you're so motivated for youtube\nvideo games and pornography and then you\nsay but that's not what i want to be\nmotivated in there's the second problem\nyou run into\nbecause if that were true you wouldn't\nbe doing it\nyou should the thing you should realize\nis i'm highly motivated to do it\nso it's like colossal misdiagnoses\nlead to people being stuck\nbecause you're solving a problem that\ndoesn't exist\ninstead of solving the one that does\nand so this is what we try to you know\ntrain our coaches to help people figure\nout\nis that it's not that there's like so we\nhave this drive matrix and things like\nthat where you explore with people like\nokay what actually motivates you what\nare the shoulds in your life and what\nare the things that you actually want\nwhat are you driven towards and what do\nyou think you should be doing let's\nunderstand that those are two entirely\ndifferent things where does that come\nfrom how do we work through that how do\nwe move things from the should column to\nthe things that you know i value or i\ncare about so there's a lot of reframing\nand things like that that have to happen\nbut start off by recognizing like you\nknow what are you expecting from\nnot playing video games pornography\nand youtube like what are you expecting\nwhat do you think your life is going to\nbe like\nthe truth is it's going to suck\nin a lot of different ways and there\nwill be a different kind of enjoyment so\ni'll just explain this very quickly then\nwe're going to wrap up for the day\nso when you have a dopaminergic life\nit feels really good in your mind\nand it's like\na desert for your soul you're gonna feel\nlike in the in the in between spaces\nyou're gonna feel like existential dread\nfeel like your life is moving in the\nwrong direction feel ashamed of yourself\nfeel envious of others there's this\nwhole like pile of like negative\nemotional demons that's like\nhiding in the closet\nand every once in a while like the door\nof the closet will like open up and\nthey'll come rushing out\nand then like it takes a lot of\npornography to like push them back in\nright\nbecause pornography is the antidote to\ninner demons\nand so\nif you're in that situation like what\nyou're giving up the trade that you make\nis the exact opposite\nright it's like having fulfillment\nand being proud of yourself\nand all that kind of stuff like maybe\nhaving a healthy relationship\nbut you're gonna give up like all the\nbenefits of the dopaminergic crap\nso you're not gonna have fun you're\ngoing to be bored at times it's going to\nbe hard you're going to feel negative\nthings you're going to feel good things\ntoo\nso you have to kind of choose between\nlike the brain and the soul\nbecause if you want to choose the brain\nthen you're going to get constant\nstimulation it'll be like sort of fun\nbut then you'll be raging at your\nteammates\nand feeling empty on the inside\nand you can play video games as much as\nyou want to to feel fill up that\nemptiness you can watch his pornography\nas much as you want to to do away with\nthe feeling of loneliness and lack of\ncompanionship\nand you can you can you know watch\nyoutube as much as you want to to inform\nyourself about things that are neat\ninstead of actually doing something in\nthe world\nyou can learn about what other people\nare doing as much as you want to it's\nnever going to\nfix the whole of not having done\nanything yourself\nthe downside though is if you do things\nyourself if you enter into a\nrelationship and you find fulfillment\nit's like\nyour mind is gonna be in pain for parts\nof that you're gonna have to make\nsacrifice entering into a relationship\nis not all just\nyou know get getting rid of your\nloneliness it's like having to deal with\nanother human being's emotional needs\nwhich can be incredibly exhausting\nyou know finding fulfillment in life and\nbeing proud of what you do oftentimes\ncomes with blood sweat and tears\nlike the problem is like if you're in\nthis dopaminergic whatever like\nthe second that blood sweat or tears\nstarts to happen we just all fold we\ncave\nback\nlet me go back so the real question that\nyou should ask yourself this is the\nessence of nyan yog is like what are you\nexpecting\nand what do you want and what choice do\nyou want to make because the choice is\nyours\nyou just need to make it and recognize\nthat the choice you have to stop picking\nthe good choice and start picking the\ncrappy choice you have to start picking\nblood sweat and tears over\nenjoyment relaxation\nand hitting the fast forward button on\nyour life\nso then someone's asking how do we get\nover that pain it's the wrong kind of\nthinking that's that's the thought that\ngets keeps you stuck you don't get over\nthe pain\nwhat you need to choose is the path to\nnot get over the pain\nyou need to accept the pain embrace the\npain it ain't going anywhere\nthis is the whole problem it's a\nbeautiful question how do i get over the\npain it's the exact question that that\ncauses failure over and over and over\nagain\nbecause everyone's like when does this\nend it doesn't end if you want to put\ntogether your life it doesn't end\nif you're waiting for the pain to stop\nif you're waiting for like\na book to be as exciting as playing the\nlost art beta\nnot gonna happen\nmaybe happened with harry potter book\nfour\nit's the closest we're gonna get in our\nlifetime\nright so accept that you're not gonna\nget over it and that's where you'll get\nfree from it\nyou"
