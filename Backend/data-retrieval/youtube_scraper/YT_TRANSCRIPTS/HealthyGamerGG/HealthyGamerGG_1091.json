    "transcript": "so oh boy i sure do love being perceived\nas a gifted child i hope i don't end up\nas being a perfectionist perfectionist\nburnout with\nburnt out i suppose with depression\nanxiety unfulfilled expectations and no\nreal interests or goals\nso this is something that someone\ncross-posted to our subreddit you know\nit's a meme we've had a couple of\nstreams about burnout and gifted kids\nso today what i'd like to talk to you\nall a little bit about is\nthe pathway from gifted child to burnt\nout perfectionist\nas well as sort of the way that society\nactually sets gifted children up to kind\nof fail\nso i know it's kind of interesting but\nwhen we think about a gifted child\nwe think about we perceive\ngifted as an advantage\nbut in my experience working with a lot\nof gifted children it's not always an\nadvantage and in fact oftentimes it can\nbe a burden\nand so i've seen this a lot in our\ncommunity i've worked with a lot of\npeople who kind of fall into that this\ncategory i suppose i sort of fall into\nit as well\nwhere i grew up kind of get i'm gifted\nright so like school was easy for me i\nwas told from a very young age that i\nwas smart\ni was also kind of held accountable for\nlike not studying right there like i'd\nkind of like not study very much and\nmaybe get a b plus or an a minus\nand my teachers would tell my parents\nthe same thing every single\nparent-teacher conference they'd always\nsay well if all look just applied\nhimself he would be the best student in\nthe class\nif he only just like\nstudied more he'd be the best student in\nthe class right they were like he's\nsuper smart he has a lot of potential\nright so they use these words like they\ntalk about how smart i am they talk\nabout all the potential i have and if i\njust applied myself i'd be you know i'd\nbe such a\ni'd be the best student\nso it's kind of interesting because we\nperceive giftedness as an advantage\nbut as one of my teachers once told me\nwe'll kind of get to this towards the\nend\nthey once explained to me that um this\nis in in not in medical school but when\ni was training to become a psychiatrist\ni had a supervisor who once told me that\ngifted gifted children or special needs\nchildren and what that literally means\nis that like the needs of a child who's\ngifted are actually different from the\naverage child and the parents who\nrecognize that and recognize that this\nchild is going to need like a slightly\ndifferent structure a different\ncurriculum or a different way of being\nraised are the ones that end up sort of\ndoing a really good job and oddly enough\nin her clinical experience she found\nthat much like any other special needs\nchildren um\nyou know kids that were not\ntreated appropriately despite their\ngifts were the ones that kind of\nstruggled so this statement when i first\nheard it i thought was like absolutely\nridiculous kind of blew my mind a little\nbit but i respected the supervisor a lot\nand i started thinking about it\nso what i'd like to share with you all\ntoday is sort of the pathway that a\ngifted child takes\nhow a society treats them how parents\ntreat them the kind of struggles they\nface or the influences that they have\nlet's not even call it a struggle\nbecause it may not be a struggle and\nthen sort of how they end up so i'd like\nto kind of share with that with you all\ntoday okay\nso the first thing that tends to happen\nis when a child is gifted they\nte school tends to be easy right so if\nyou kind of think about it\ndevelopmentally\nthere are a lot of different things that\nhappen in school so let's talk about\nschool so school is a place where you\nget you socialize right so you get\nsocialization skills it's a place that\nyou learn and people think that school\nis primarily about learning and it is\nprimarily about learning but it's just\nnot about\nlearning that the subject material so\nsure we learn like arithmetic and\nmathematics and all that kind of stuff\nwe learn history and science and all\nthat good stuff\nbut really school if you kind of look at\nit developmentally is a wonderful\nopportunity to learn certain key things\nsocialization is a really important\npiece the other thing is like habits and\nhow to study and this is the first sort\nof disadvantage that i think gifted\nchildren sort of face\nis that you know if you're young and\nyou're gifted school is so easy that you\nsort of get by without the luxury of\nstudying and so we kind of perceive this\nas an advantage right like if you have\nto if you go through school and you\ndon't study like that's easy like it's\neasy easy clap right\nand so it is and that sort of makes\nsense\nbut the the interesting thing that i\nfound is that oftentimes being\nintelligent especially when you're super\nyoung as a kid actually sets you up for\nfailure down the road because you never\nneed to learn\nthe habituated study like\ntechnique that you kind of need to that\nthat you need to succeed later on so for\na normal kid what tends to happen is\nlike they don't have to study like in\nfirst grade but maybe like second grade\nthird grade they have to learn how to\nstudy like once a week maybe they like\nlearn how to study the night before the\ntest because it doesn't come easily to\nthem\nand then fourth grade fifth grade now\nyou're you're doing homework a couple\ndays a week you know you're studying two\nor three days before the test then you\nkind of hit middle school where maybe\nyou're studying like four days before\nthe test and so there's this very\ngraduated sense of increasing\nresponsibility as you go further and\nfurther in school\nand it's sort of designed that way right\nwe're not like no teacher has a six six\nyear old that they're like giving 14\nhours of homework a week to it's just\nabsurd and then at the top end of the\nspectrum in terms of study habits and\nwhat we demand of students you have\nsomething like let's say law school or\nmedical school or things like that where\npeople are regular studying like 60\nhours a week 80 hours a week in medical\nschool because you know people have have\ngrown up and have built enough of a\nstudy habit where they can actually\nhandle that pace of study\nso what happens with the gifted kid so\nthe gifted kid you know when you sort of\nlevel up your skill to level one like in\nthe first grade and then you level up\nyour studying skill to level two in the\nsecond grade and level three in the\nthird grade so the gifted kid never\nactually has to like grind that xp for\nlevels like one through five of studying\nhabits\nand so they sort of managed to get b's\nor a's without really minimal with\nminimal studying or no studying at all\nand then seventh grade rolls around\neighth grade rolls around they start to\nstruggle a little bit maybe they get b's\nthey're still not learning how to study\nbecause they sort of skipped that part\nof of the you know the skill building\nand we'll kind of get to that later and\nthen what tends to happen with gifted\nkids is that they don't need to study\ndon't need to study don't need to study\nand then they hit a wall\nthey finally get into some kind of\nsituation where their raw intellect\ncannot\nis no longer sufficient to handle the\nschoolwork that they're supposed to\nhandle\nbut they've trained themselves at that\npoint they've customized themselves at\nthat point to managing school with raw\nintellect\nand so when that kind of falls short\nthey like they really kind of really hit\na wall it's a very very hard cliff to to\novercome\nand so this is kind of the first thing\nthat that sort of shoots gifted kids in\nthe foot and this also leads to kind of\nthis idea of perfectionism and burnout\nbecause then they like you know then\nthey they struggle a lot they don't\nunderstand why they can't do it they\nthey try they know they're smart\neveryone's talking to them about\npotential they start to feel really bad\nabout themselves so the first kind of\ninteresting thing that gifted kids run\ninto is the fact that they sort of don't\ndevelop the proper study habits because\nyou know as a six-year-old it's kind of\nnot your fault because like you're not\nmature enough as a six-year-old to\nrealize like oh i need you know to have\ngood study habits so even though the\nteacher said this last tuesday and i\nunderstand that i don't need to study\ni'm going to sit down and like practice\nmy study habits it doesn't make any\nsense it's like completely artificial\nso that's the first thing that happens\nis that they kind of hit this wall of of\nyou know not being able to study\nthe second thing to consider is the\nexpectation so another thing that really\nleads gifted kids kind of down the wrong\npath is\nthe burden of expectation that's placed\nupon them so from a very young age\nthey're told oh you're gifted you're\nsmart you're special you have so much\npotential and so what that starts to do\nis it constructs like a very very lofty\ngoal in their minds right so i'm going\nto use kind of an analogy which is kind\nof like you know if i think about an\namazing home like i think about a\nmansion it can have a beautiful\nblueprint and i can buy a gigantic piece\nof land and i can look at that and i can\nsay like oh like this this home or this\nthis blueprint has so much potential\nand sometimes we kind of forget that\nlike\nyou can have like you can have a\nblueprint for a mansion but that's gonna\nactually take way more work to achieve\nthan like building a shack so the other\nreally interesting thing that that we\nsort of kind of get wrong societally is\nthat we assume that when someone is\ngifted\nthings are actually going to be easier\nfor them that they need to work less to\naccomplish the same amount\nbut in my experience living up to a\ngifted child's potential involves more\nwork it's sort of like you know it's\njust like building a shack versus\nbuilding a mansion like sure the mansion\nis capable of so much more than the shaq\nis capable of but let's not forget for a\nmoment that the amount of effort that it\ngoes into building a mansion is actually\nway more than what's required to build a\nshack this is the second place that\ngifted kids kind of get tripped up\nbecause everyone around\nis looking at them and they're sort of\nsaying\noh like this is an amazing mansion like\nyou could build such an amazing mansion\nand we all kind of forget for a moment\nthat like actually living up to that\npotential is very very difficult and\nrequires a lot more of an investment\nthan building a shack\nand so this gap between what people\nexpect of you and also the idea that\nthings should be easier for you\nkind of compound on themselves and sort\nof end up with gifted kids kind of\nfeeling like they're they're failing at\neverything right because they have all\nthis potential\nand they're not they're just not living\nup to it\nso the other thing that we'll see in\ngifted kids is that what what tends to\nhappen is that they will put in some\namount of work\nbut they're expecting a mansion when\nall they've really put in is as much as\nbuilding a shack\ni may have lost you a little bit there\nbut let me just explain\nso\nyou know what a gifted kid will do is\nthey'll like look at their peers right\nand they'll say like oh like this person\ndid this and they're able to accomplish\nthis so like i should be able to do that\ntoo and so if you look at your neighbors\nwho are building a shack and they're\nlike whoa they went to home depot and\nthey got like 100 pounds of wood and\nthey built their shack over a weekend\nand then like you go and get your 100\npounds of wood from home depot and you\nstart like brought to you by home depot\ni suppose um and you start building your\nmansion like i know it sounds kind of\nweird but you know 100 pounds of wood\nmay be enough to build a shack but it's\nnowhere near enough to build a mansion\nand then what gifted kids will do is\nthey'll look at like the foundation that\nthey've laid with a hundred pounds of\nwood and they'll be like where's the i\ndon't even have a shack like you know\nit's it's like they look at what they've\naccomplished when they put in the same\namount of energy as someone else and\nthey get really confused because this\nperson has a complete shack over here\nand like i have like barely the\nbeginnings of a mansion and so then that\nsort of negatively impacts them they\nstart to like feel like they're actually\ninferior to these other people because\nthey've been told oh you're smarter than\nthe kid next door like why the hell is\nthe kid next door getting into college\nand like you're not even getting into\ncollege and so it all sort of sort of\nsort of compounds right because even for\nthe gifted kid they're not trying to\nbuild a shack because they've been told\nthey've been they're gifted their entire\nlife so it's not enough to be average if\nyou're gifted so what you have to do is\nyou try to you know build a mansion\nbecause that's what you've been\ntold that you're capable of that's the\nexpectation you set for yourself and\nthen you're you're left kind of\nscratching your head and wondering like\nwhy you don't even have a shack yet even\nthough you studied for a month and they\nstudied for a month you're not getting\nas much as that they're getting\nand it's kind of super bizarre right\nbecause we don't we just don't think\nabout it that way we think that if\nyou're gifted that means that everything\nshould be easier for you that it not\nonly they may need a hundred pounds of\nwood to build a shack but you should be\nable to build a shack and 50 pounds of\nwood it should be easier for you but it\nturns out paradoxically being harder\nand then we sort of end up with kind of\nthe final state of a gifted kid which if\nwe kind of think about it internally is\na state of like really shame and low\nself-esteem so all this stuff kind of\ncompounds right like you're told you're\nsmart so you set this expectation of\nwhat you're capable of like way up here\nand then like you know first grade goes\nby and you're up here second grade goes\nby and you're up here third grade goes\nby and you're up here boom boom boom\nfourth grade fifth grade sixth grade\n10th grade 11th grade and then you kind\nof tank right and as you go to college\nsuddenly like you don't have the study\nskills involved and now in the gap\nbetween what you're capable of and what\nyou actually accomplish this gap is\nwhere shame comes from this is the shame\ngap that gifted kids inevitably fall\ninto\nwhich is when they fall short of what\ntheir expectations are and this could be\nonce again\ndue to the fact that you're you know\nyou're setting out to build a mansion\nand you ended up not even building a\nshack right so all of these\ndiscrepancies between your expectations\nand your accomplishments\nin that gap and the bigger the gap is\nthe more it's filled with shame\nso then what happens is kids are ashamed\nright because they should be doing more\nthey should be doing better\nand then like the shame then further\ncompounds and makes it hard to find\nmotivation and this is where you kind of\nget burnout so then like you have these\ngifted kids and you're like hey man just\nlike go to a community college you don't\nhave to go to an ivy league school\nschool you don't have to go to like\nharvard or stanford or mit just like go\nto your local community college and in\nthat comes a bunch of shame because\nyou've been told your entire life that\nyou're better than that right\nand so you start to develop this ego\nof being a super smart kid and then this\nleads to avoidance of things because all\nyou're left with is the identity of a\nsmart kid so you can never even bring\nyourself to go to community college\nbecause smart kids don't go to community\ncollege in your mind that's where the\nstupid kids go and if you go to\ncommunity college then suddenly you've\nlived your entire life for 20 years\nbeing told you're a smart kid it's the\nonly that's your biggest strength it's\nthe one that everyone keeps talking\nabout and now like suddenly you have to\nrelegate yourself to being a stupid kid\nand in that gap is where the shame lives\nin that gap is where the ego lives okay\nso it's really really hard right because\nyou're set up with these expectations\npeople don't really acknowledge that\nbecause you're capable of a lot it's\nactually going to take like a lot of\nwork to take that potential and bring it\nto fruition\nright and that's like that's the biggest\nthing is people just lose sight of the\nfact that building a mansion actually\ntakes more work than building a shack\nand your entire life people have told\nyou like you should build this mansion\nbecause that's what you're capable of\nand so then we kind of get to all right\nso like what do we do about it right so\nif you're a gifted kid who's kind of\nperfectionistic and burnt out and like\nsociety has sort of set you up this way\ni'm not saying that you're not\nindividually responsible as well but i\ndo think that there's a whole reason so\nwhen we have like a generation of burnt\nout gifted kids i think we have to be\nfair and be a little bit scientific and\nkind of acknowledge that this may not be\nlike an individual problem right we've\ngot a generation of kids like this like\nmaybe there's something societal going\non and i think paradoxically we sort of\nset these kids up to\nstruggle and so then the question\nbecomes okay like what do we do about it\nso the first thing you should do if\nyou're a gifted kid is to stop\ncomparison right like comparison is is\nthe foundation of getting out of this\nproblem\nbecause as long as you are comparing\nyourself and this is part of the issue\nis that if you think about the word\ngifted\nwhat does the word gifted imply it is a\nword that has no meaning\noutside of a comparative framework you\nguys get that the only way you can be\ngifted is if there are other people who\nare not gifted\nand so essentially what happens is like\nthe whole idea of a gifted kid only\nexists in relationship to another kid\nand so what we find in the minds of\ngifted kids is that they're comparing\nthemselves all the time oh i don't want\nto go to community college that's where\nthe stupid people go oh i don't know\nlike why i can't do what my friend is\ncapable of like he's able to do so much\nwhy am i not able to do so much i have\nan older sibling who did fantastic\nand now i have big shoes to fill right\nthere's so much comparison all of the\nexpectations that gifted kids have don't\ncome from themselves\nright because if you actually based your\nexpectations on what you're capable of\nyou'd be capable of a b c d or an f\nthat's what that would be a realistic\nexpectation but instead you create these\nartificial expectations that are based\non comparison and why do gifted kids do\nthat because it starts with their\nparents it starts with their teachers\nwe're all told that we're gifted which\nis by definition a comparison to all of\nthe other kids\nand so then what happens is you're\nlooking over at the shack and you've got\nthis blueprint for a mansion and they\ngive you some wood and then you try to\nbuild the mansion and like you don't\neven have a roof when this person has a\ncompletely built shack and then you kind\nof look at yourself well like man i must\nbe like a super idiot right like and\nit's just it's so bizarre that when we\nset up this kind of when we start with\nthis framework of a comparison\nwe sort of doom ourselves to failure\nbecause there's like we're just\nit's just it's never going to work\nbecause you can't ever\nbase the expectations of your life and\nwhat you're capable of based on what\nsomeone else is doing\nright if someone else is happy studying\nchemical engineering it doesn't mean\nthat you're going to be happy studying\nchemical engineering if somebody else is\nhappy dating someone of the opposite sex\nit doesn't mean that you're going to be\nhappy dating someone of the opposite sex\nthe whole point is as individuals as\nhumans we're individuals and if you're a\ngifted kid the first thing you've got to\ndo is let go of all comparison\nso next thing is to\nrecognize that your road is going to be\na rough one right so like when someone\nsets out to build a mansion they know in\ntheir mind that like this is gonna take\na while right\nyou can't expect to build a mansion in\nthe same amount of time it would take\nsomeone to build a shack\nand so if you're a gifted kid and you\nexpect a lot from yourself\nokay\nrecognize that this is going to be a\nlong road and the greater your potential\nis the longer it's going to take for you\nto get there and this is something that\ni can understand in hindsight like so i\ngrew up as a gifted kid and was like in\nyou know the special classes or whatever\ni actually still remember when i was in\neighth grade my grades started to dip\nand when i went to high school\num i didn't qualify for based on my\ngrades like my high school was like yeah\nhe needs to be in like regular english\nhe can't be in like advanced english or\nhe doesn't meet the criteria for\nadvanced english and so my parents were\nreally really not happy with that\nbecause they have they have such a smart\nboy you know he's so smart he just needs\nto apply himself so they went to the\nschool and i remember having a meeting\nwith the the honors english teacher or\nwhatever and then he's like do you want\nto be in this class and i was like yeah\ni want to be in the class and my parents\nwere like yeah he should be he belongs\nhe belongs in the class\nright and so the teacher was like okay\nfine because you know\ni mean you're not gonna you know there\nare some parents that could potentially\nbe annoying so you're like whatever\nand so i ended up being in the class\nthat i really didn't belong and i really\ndidn't do very well\nright because i didn't have the work\nethic but it propagates sort of this\nidea of like you can handle it\nso like i started off you know going on\nthe wrong track kind of like in in high\nschool it took me\ni took me five years to graduate from\ncollege right with a 2.5 gpa\ntook me another three or four years to\neven get into medical school\nand so like my road has been long\nand like that's just sometimes what it\ntakes if you're a gifted kid right you\ntake the scenic route in life so\noftentimes people would ask me you know\nlike\nabout stuff\nwhen i remember when i was going to when\ni started medical school and i saw\nfriends of mine right who were who i was\nin high school with they're already\nfully trained doctors and you know\nflying around and all that good stuff\nand i'm just like starting medical\nschool and i was like yeah i took the\nscenic route in life and so recognize\nthat if you're a gifted kid like it's a\nlong road like you're not going to do\nthings faster you're not going to build\na mansion\nas fast as someone else is going to\nbuild a shack the other thing to\nrecognize about it being a long road if\nyou're a gifted kid is don't expect to\nsee the form of your mansion for a long\ntime\nwhen other people have built their\nshacks you will still just have the\nfoundation of the mansion it's not going\nto have a roof for a long time it's not\ngoing to have windows for a long time so\nthis is the other problem that gifted\nkids run into\nis as they put in an equal amount of\neffort compared to their colleagues they\nactually see less return on their\ninvestment and that in turn shatters\ntheir motivation and what makes them\nwant to give up\nright because i'm putting in all this\neffort i'm still not seeing anything yet\nso it's a long road be patient with\nyourself and try your best not to\ncompare to other people\nthe last thing to kind of consider is\nthat is the shame so gifted kids\noftentimes struggle a lot with\nself-esteem and shame and that once\nagain is because their expectations are\nup here and their performance is down\nhere right\nand so in that gap is where your shame\nis going to live\nand so as long as there is a gap in what\nyou expect from yourself\nwith what you accomplish\nyou will have shame and the solution to\nthat oddly enough is one of two ways\nright\none is you can actually\nlive up to the expectations that you\nhave right so you can actually shoot up\nhere and land up here so you can go to\nan ivy league school or whatever right\nyou can go you can start\nyou can do a tech startup or whatever\nlike you can like\ndo everything that everyone has always\nknown you're capable of doing so you can\nactually hit all of those metrics that's\none option then the shame will go away\nor what you can do is let go of your\nexpectations\nand bring yourself down here because the\nshame exists in the gap so even if you\naccept yourself as being like sort of a\nfailure oddly enough the shame will go\naway and as you accept yourself as you\nare which is not wasted potential but\nlike in the present like you are\neverything that you're capable of\neverything that you've ever been capable\nof is exactly what you've achieved and\nonce you sort of take that attitude\nbring your expectations down to here you\nwill be amazed at like what happens to\nyour motivation and what you are truly\ncapable of\nbut you can't achieve it as long as\nthere is that shame gap right like in\nterms of performance\nso questions\nanyway so let me just kind of summarize\nso i think that like\nyou know we see this a lot where a lot\nof people are gifted\nand we think of that as an advantage but\nlike i was saying earlier\ni think that\nyou know sometimes being gifted comes\nwith its own set of needs\nand by properly addressing those needs\nwe can avoid some of these things like\ngifted kids you know feeling ashamed of\nthemselves gifted kids\nyou know not like comparing themselves\nto like all the other normal kids and\nand finding themselves lacking\num and also that we have to kind of\nacknowledge that our school system is\nsort of set up in a particular way that\noftentimes causes gifted kids to stumble\nand through understanding like how a\ngifted kid you know a child who is\ngifted becomes an adult who's\nperfectionistic and burnt out\nwe have to understand that whole life\ncycle in order to sort of\nstart taking steps to change it\num\nokay so i'm sure you've been asked this\nquestion before and have answered before\nso feel free to tell me where i can\nfinally answer this question how are you\nable to get accepted to harvard medical\nschool let alone medical school alone\nwith such a low gpa when that is such a\ncritical deciding factor\nhow did i stand out so that's a great\nquestion so the short answer is so i i\ndid some amount of graduate education so\ni did a master's degree to boost my gpa\nthe second thing that i did i didn't go\nto harvard for medical school i went to\ntufts for medical school and then i did\nmy psychiatry training at harvard at\nmass general mclean hospital\nand so the short answer of like how i\nwound up there is like one step at a\ntime\nso you have to do you know in each of\nthose things involved like\na reality check or some degree of\nhumility in terms of like thinking like\ni actually don't belong at harvard like\ni'm never going to wind up there i had\nto accept that right let alone get into\nmedical school\nand the more that i accepted like i i\ndid a lot of things that were you know\nhumbling to say the least i wouldn't\nquite say undignified but i had to\nreally let go of a lot of ego and like\ntake one step at a time it also took\nperseverance i mean i applied to 120\nmedical schools before i got into a\nsingle one and that was the break that i\nneeded\nand then like understanding having all\nthat failure behind me i really\nworked hard in medical school\nand really tried to excel\nand then i actually did an away rotation\nfor those of you don't know what that is\nor for those of you do know what that is\nso i basically did an audition rotation\nat harvard which is like super\ncompetitive you show up there with a\nbunch of other people who want to go\nthere and it's basically like a test\nit's like a month-long test of what\nyou're capable of and i did really well\nso thankfully i had set up you know a\nlot of good stuff over the last\neight years\nin terms of being myself and like owning\nthe person that i was and not being\nashamed of the fact that i failed\nand you know recognizing that most of\nthe students most of the other students\nwho were auditioning\num were four years younger than i was\nthat i was actually older than some of\nthe residents there\ndespite the fact that like they were\nevaluating me right so like there's\nsomeone two years younger who's like\ngiving me a grade\nso navigating all that stuff was\ndifficult but i did a good job at it and\nstayed focused and that's how i wound up\nat harvard so i trained there for four\nyears and that's where i'm faculty now\nright but it's all about like letting go\nof the ego\num how do you lower expectations\nuh you lower expectations by accepting\nwhat you're capable of\nlike actually and so expectation and and\nacceptance are at opposite ends of the\nspectrum\nokay so\npracticing acceptance\nis\nhow you lower expectations\nso let me give you guys an example so\nthe theme today is\nright so like let me think about a nyani\nyoga exercise to let go of expectations\num\nlet me just think about this for a\nsecond\nso here's a good example of a nyani yoga\nexercise actually i don't know if this\nis a good example\nthis is one of the ones that i feel less\nconfident this is maybe a bad example of\na yoga exercise\nso for the next\nmonth or two months\nwhen you go to a restaurant\nand someone asks you what you want to\nwant what you want to order just tell\nthe waiter to surprise you\njust tell them surprise me\nand then pay attention\nto your enjoyment or lack of enjoyment\nof the food\nright so when we go to restaurants\nwe have expectations and if we think\nabout the least\nthe worst experience that you can have\nat a restaurant is not actually to have\nbad food\nit's to expect really good food and get\nbad food that's actually worse than\ngetting bad food if you know a\nrestaurant is crap and you go there and\nyou order something the food that you\nget is crap like what were you expecting\nit's totally fine actually right we do\nthat every day like if you go to a fast\nfood like mcdonald's or taco bell or\nwhatever like you're not expecting you\nknow like a gourmet meal you're just\nexpecting some like mediocre arguably\nincredibly tasty\ndepending on whether you're getting a\nmexican pizza or not\nwhich you can't get anymore because\nthey're out of\nsad\nbut\nso like a lot of if you guys want to\nreally understand so this is the way\nthat nyanio works if you really want to\nunderstand expectation and acceptance\nyou have to put yourself in situations\nthat are like free from expectation\nand you can't put yourself in a\nsituation because the expectation\ndoesn't come from the situation right\nit's even that's\neven what i said was kind of wrong\nyou have to practice\nmessing with your expectations so go to\nrestaurant just say surprise me\nor you can ask if they don't know like\nif they're taking it back you can say\nwhat's good here okay i'll take that\nright if you've got dietary restrictions\ntell them about the dietary restrictions\nand just like and then you're like but\nwhat if i don't like the food that i get\nwell yeah i mean that's the point right\nso like just eat what you get and see\nwhat happens\nand they're like but i don't like it and\nit's like yes so like pay attention to\nthat and be like how hard is it for you\nto order food that you're not gonna like\nor you order without expectations what's\nit like to go to a restaurant and accept\nthat you're going to just get some\nrandom pile of food that could be\namazing and could be something that you\nreally dislike\nthat's how you gain acceptance that's\nhow you let go of expectations by\nliterally going to a restaurant and like\nactively letting them go\nthat is the nyani yog\nand then you may discover all kinds of\ncool things right you may even discover\nfor example that if you go to the\nrestaurant and you expect\ncrap if you're like this is going to be\nan absolute train wreck i'm gonna have\nto go home and like have a bowl of\ncereal after the meal\nit'll be really interesting\nhow much you enjoy your meal it'll be\nreally interesting because in that\nmoment what you're doing is letting go\nof the expectation\nright and then like suddenly even if you\nget crap it's not a big deal and if you\nget something delicious it's like such a\nhuge win and that's what it means to let\ngo of expectation the more you let go of\nexpectation the more you start to enjoy\nlife and the better life gets\nit's kind of bizarre\nso literally if you guys wanted nyani\nyoga practice to let go of expectations\nand earn acceptance and you can't just\ndo this once right so you can't like\nwuss out of it\nyou have to do it for a month\npresuming you're going to go out to eat\nyou know and you can afford that and all\nthat good stuff\notherwise like make it three months\nlike\nyou know do it for a while like commit\nyourself this is my life now gg get\nwrecked noobs\nso\ntry it you guys want to learn nyan yog\ntry it\nokay someone else is asking how should a\nparent teacher or manager support the\nspecial needs of gifted people if what's\nhappening now is bad that's a great\nquestion so i'll give you an example\nso sometimes i get parents that come\ninto my office\nthey have a kid who's addicted to video\ngames why is a kid addicted to video\ngames really simple\nbecause video games match the pace of\nthe child right that's why that's why\ngifted kids in a nutshell the reason\nthat gifted kids get addicted to video\ngames is one very very very simple\nreason can all be reduced to this\ngames match the pace of the child and\nschool doesn't\nso you've got a kid goes to school gets\na worksheet does the worksheet i still\nremember i i had this experience i\nskipped the first grade so this is what\nhappened\ni went to a school\nwhere you know i'd do a worksheet and\nthen like they'd give me another one and\nso in in my first day of first grade i\nmoved schools i i gave them you know i\ngot a worksheet i did the worksheet i\ngave it back to them and i said can i\nhave the next one and she's like what do\nyou mean the next one it's like the next\none like whatever's next like i'm done\nwith this we've got class for another 45\nminutes i'm done with this can i have\nthe next one she's like there is no next\none i'm like what\nand it didn't take long where like you\nknow she gave me the then she evaluated\nme and i got moved up a grade but same\nproblem there\nand then eventually like what heck is\nlike school moves at the pace of like\nthe slowest person now here's the really\naddictive thing about a video game now\nimagine you're just bored at school\nbecause it's moving at a snail's pace\nright because there's like other\nsix-year-olds and like you're a\nsix-year-old two and maybe you're a\nlittle smarter than the other\nsix-year-olds now enter a video game\nwhat happens when you don't beat level\none\nyou replay level one and what happens\nwhen you beat level one you go straight\nto level two and if you beat level two\nyou go straight to level three you beat\nlevel three you go straight to level\nfour\nso games perfectly match\nthe challenge\nthat a human being is capable of right\nif you get stuck on a boss in dark souls\nlike\nyou don't get to move past the boss\nbecause your parents make a phone call\nto from software and they're like hey my\nson is really good at video games can\nyou please advance him past this boss\nand stick him to the next boss it's like\nyou can't do that in dark souls like\ndark souls doesn't give a\nright\nso like kids get addicted to video games\nbecause they perfectly match what you're\ncapable of which is exactly what kids\nlike there's this whole thing called\nintent to mastery we teach all this\nstuff to parents and things like that\nso what do you do if you've got a kid\nwho's gifted you challenge them and you\ndon't rely on school to do it for you so\nwhen parents come to me and they're like\ni have a kid who's addicted to video\ngames he's 16. he thinks school is i ask\nhim okay what do you think about schools\nlike school is boring\nthen what i do is i you know i make a\ncouple of phone calls and i'm like we're\ngonna like you so we were i was back\nwhen i was in boston a lot of cool\nstartups in boston so what i'll do is\nwe'll make some phone calls we'll stick\nthem in an internship somewhere like\nwe'll take some college-level internship\nit's some kind of startup so like we'll\nlook around at like incubators from like\nmit or whatever like harvard will be\nlike hey like there's a kid do you guys\nhave any internship opportunities\navailable and we'll stick him there and\nhe'll like be he'll work there for the\nsummer and it like turns the kid right\naround no more video games because he's\nactually like learning so i stuck one\nkid in this startup that was\nthat there's an app you take a picture\nof a mole on your body and it tells you\nthe percentage chance that the mole is\ncancerous\nright so we stick the kid there we're\nlike go help them\nand then like sometimes the kid is like\nwhat am i supposed to do like you start\nby getting them coffee\nand then maybe you'll learn something\nand then it's it's actually fantastic\nlike they do they do really well you\nchallenge them right and because the\ncool thing is that a lot of the startup\nfolks they sort of recognize because\nsome of them are like misfits too so\nthey're like okay there's like a kid\nhere like let's put them to work because\nthey recognize that okay you're 16. so\nyou know how to like manage sql data\ndatabases and the kid is like no they're\nlike\ngoogle it\nand learn and then you're going to\nmanage our sql database next week\nand the kid is like what and like yeah\nand then suddenly the kid is like goes\nhome he's not playing video games he's\nlike reading about sql databases\nor whatever\nright just just stick them stick them\ninto it and challenge them\nso as a parent you know or a teacher\nlike i'd say like ask them so here's the\nbiggest mistake that parents and\nteachers make with gifted children\nis that you\nwhen when a gifted child fails what we\ntend to do is slow down instead what you\nneed to do is speed up it's absolutely\nterrifying so if a gifted child is\nfailing what they need more than\nanything else is a bigger challenge not\nlike an easier environment now you have\nto make sure for a couple of other\nthings like you need to make sure\nthere's not adhd going on depression\ngoing on learning disabilities or other\nthings like that going on but in the\nabsence of all of those things challenge\nthem more not less\nask them to do more give them put them\nin positions of leadership\nright\nand just push them\nbecause like it's so fulfilling when\nwhen you're a take a kid in that\nsituation and you're like\nyou're gonna need to do this thing and\nthey're like i can't do that thing and\nyou're like okay so then fail\nbut try if you fail like no big deal but\ni'm not gonna i'm not gonna expect less\nof you i know it's kind of paradoxical\nbecause we just talked about letting go\nof expectation\nbut it's not really expectations it's\nreally having faith in them it's a\nsubtle difference but be like i have\nfaith in you i think you can handle it\nso like give it your best shot\nthat's what you do you challenge them\nrespect them\nis instead of expect things from them\nyou"
