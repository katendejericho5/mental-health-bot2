    "transcript": "so how to deal with an aggressive\nteenager\naddicted to video games right so this is\nthis is a good one right hey hi dr k um\ni need advice on what to do with my\nyounger brother 17 he is autistic but\nattends regular school with a decent\nperformance he didn't get any special\neducation but we made efforts to be\nunderstanding for his difficulties\nbefore the pandemic he was socially\ninept but still had a good relationship\nwith us with the start of the pandemic\nhe got a phone and became addicted to\nvideo games and his behavior changed\nhe locks himself in his room all day\nbarely eats yells loudly for hours on\nend while playing pvp games he also uses\nvery foul language and often punches or\nthrows objects violently\nhis shouting doesn't stop at night and\nhe and doesn't allow anyone to sleep\nparents and four siblings when\nconfronted about his behavior even by a\nsimple knock on the door to remind him\nto lower his voice he goes into fits of\nrage and blames it all on us\nsaying we should leave him alone until\nhe calms down which sometimes takes\nhours to days which is an inconvenience\nlast year he ran away from home and\nsometimes he threatens to do it again\nwhen he puts down his video games he\nbecomes a little more open discussion\nand promises to change and says he\nunderstands the problem however a few\nminutes later he goes back to video\ngames and forgets all of that and all\nthe shouting cursing disrespectful\nspeech resumes\nmy father gave up on him and doesn't\nwant to take him to a mental health\nprofessional i am an unemployed college\nstudent so i can't do that myself how\nshould i talk to my brother should i ask\nfor outside help\num\nps i'd be overjoyed if dr k saw this i\nsaw it but he did he\nbut if he didn't would appreciate any\nadvice i think you should check out the\nadvice in the thread as well uh thank\nyou to dr k and and thank you to the\nwonderful community\nso this is a hard one\nso we get a lot of posts\nabout people asking what can i do in\nthis situation\nand sometimes you know for parents and\nstuff i think that there's a lot more\nthat they can do\nbut a lot of the posts that we get are\nfrom like siblings\nwho are like you know hey my my you know\nmy younger brother or sister or whatever\nhas a problem what can i do to support\nthem we also get a lot of posts from\npeople like asking about friends right\nthey'll say oh my friend is struggling\nwith depression like\nwhat can i do\nwhat can i do my my friend or partner is\nsuicidal like i don't know how to\nsupport them\nwe get a lot of requests for people\nasking what can i do\nin situations where\nthey're not really empowered to do much\nso the first thing that you've got to do\nif you're in a situation like this\nis first of all recognize like what\nyou're empowered to do and what you're\nnot empowered to do\nand this in and of itself is like\noftentimes a place that people get\ntripped up because they want to do so\nmuch right your desires you care about\nyour brother you really want to try hard\nlike the amount of energy or will\nthat you have to help him\nis actually potentially outweighed by\nwhat you're actually capable of\nand we see this a lot in medicine right\nso sometimes you know you'll see this\nlike i tend to think about things like\ncancer where you know\npeople are willing to do everything\nwithin their power they're willing to\ntake any medicine they're willing to do\nthis they're willing to do that you have\nlots of doctors that are you know\nwilling to go above and beyond to try to\nsave this patient's life\nand at the end of the day you just may\nnot be able to\nso you can want something a lot\nespecially as a sibling you can care\nabout your brother you can love your\nbrother but one of the first things that\nit's difficult to do is to accept that\nyou cannot fix this problem you can try\nto help him by all means but you have to\nstart out of the gate recognizing that\nlike you know there's only so much you\ncan do as an older sibling who's\nunemployed and in college and that's\nyour karma\nthat's not really up to you right you\ncan't magically be their parent\nsome\nsiblings will try right so some siblings\nwill get parentified once their parents\ncheck out and they become responsible\nfor younger siblings\nso ultimately the first thing and this\nis where we also kind of come it comes\nback to dharma and karma so what's your\ndharma what's your duty in the situation\nand what's your karma what are you\nactually capable of what's your\ncircumstance\nso i know it's kind of hard but the\nfirst thing you've got to really do is\nlike think through those things like\nwhat is your response what is the\nresponsibility\nof an older sibling to a younger sibling\nwhat's the responsibility of a 22 year\nold to a 17 year old\nfirst thing to think about and\nfurthermore what are you capable of\nbecause you're gonna you're gonna beat\nyourself up and you're gonna feel\nashamed of yourself and it's gonna be so\nterrible like because you love your\nbrother so much and you want so much you\nwant to do so much for him but if you're\nnot able to you're going to just tear\nyourself apart internally and you're\ngoing to blame yourself which is not\ngoing to help anyone\nso that's the first thing is to\nrecognize basically i'm going to assume\nthat you have essentially no real power\nin this situation like for example as\nhis older sibling you can't take away\nhis video games right like i'm assuming\nyou can't do that\num you're not you may not understand\nhealth insurance or whatever i don't\nknow what country you're in but you may\nnot be able to take him to uh because\nhe's a minor so he's 17 so you may not\nbe able to take him to a medical doctor\nor therapist because you're not his\nguardian right so there are a lot of\nthings that you can't do which it sounds\nlike your brother needs\nso let's get on to that\nso the first thing is i'm so sorry that\nyour dad seems to have mentally checked\nout and is unwilling to take him to see\na therapist because i i think\nessentially what needs to happen in the\nsituation is that your parents need to\ntake responsibility and furthermore\nthey it's not their fault but like\nthey're probably not equipped to deal\nwith something like this\nso this is where you know sometimes\nwe'll say hey like you guys should sign\nup for coaching coaching can help with\nwith this when it comes to something\nlike this and even within our parent\ncoaching we have this issue where when\nit comes to the intersection of autism\nspectrum and addiction especially video\ngame addiction i really think that\nhaving a a real mental health\nprofessional involved is like really\nwhat you need\nso remember that autism spectrum has\nsuch a constellation\nof symptoms so we do see things like\nemotions that get out of control very\nquickly we do see less control over\naddictive behaviors we see meltdowns\nbehavioral disturbances things like that\nthere are also different kinds of\ncommunication problems so you know in\nthe worst cases we have\npeople on the autism spectrum that are\nnon-verbal and really don't communicate\nat all\nthen we have people on the high\nfunctioning autism that can go to school\nand things like that and have\nconversations but their internal ability\nto become aware of their actions and\nbehaviors like maybe pretty low so\nthey'll make promises but as soon as the\ngame turns on like everything goes out\nthe window they're not like capable of\nremembering the promise that they made\ntheir mind can't remind them hey\nremember we promised this thing\nso this is where working with a\nprofessional is so important because\nideally the professional will understand\nand map out for the family\nwhat the child can and can't handle\nthen ideally what you need to do is set\nup a very strict\nboundary plan around gaming usage\nright and what i'm sort of hearing in\nthis situation is that there are\nessentially no boundaries being set on\nthe child because\nthe child really flips out and so since\neveryone is walking on eggshells around\nthe child\nyou're propagating a lot of bad behavior\nthat is getting worse and worse and no\none is putting a check on the bad\nbehavior so it's just going to grow out\nof proportion right it's kind of like\nyou know if i have an ant mound in my\nfront yard and i don't do anything to\nstop the ants the ant-man will keep\ngrowing like it'll it'll be an\ninfestation if i've got termites in my\nhouse and i don't do anything to stop\nthem it'll just keep growing\nso behaviors will continue to grow or be\nshaped by the video games until someone\nsets some kind of limit\nand this is where promises extracting a\npromise from someone is not setting a\nlimit\nso setting a limit is about having some\nkind of behavioral consequence when a\ncertain kind of behavior happens\nextracting a promise is insufficient\nso this is what we see like back when i\nworked in an addiction rehab you know\ni'd have some patients who made lots of\npromises for many years they're like\nyeah i promise i'll quit drinking my\nlast drink i swear i'll never do it\nagain promise after promise after\npromise for year after year after year\nand they're not lying they're very\ngenuine in that moment right like they\nreally do believe it they're remorseful\nmonth goes by three months go by six\nmonths go by\nand then kind of just sort of forget\nright it's like making a new year's\nresolution the day that you make a new\nyear's resolution i'm gonna cut out soda\nfor\n2022 gg no more soda\nyou really mean it there's a lot of\nmotivation there right\njust over time the mind is kind of\ntricky it sort of forgets it kind of\nyeah\na little bit every once in a while is\nokay\nlike it doesn't matter like i'm eating\ncookies anyway so like what's the\ndifference between cookies and soda like\nif i'm gonna eat some sugar like\nsometimes i just enjoy a soda more than\na cookie like there are all kinds of\nrationalizations that you know\nmine gets distracted you go back to the\nbehavior\nso why do people show up at rehab\nbecause their partner is like i'm a\ndivorce you i'm done with this\neither you go\nrehab or i'm done\nso 30\nof people that have been\nthe rough estimate okay i don't have\nreal data on this but i want to say that\n30 percent of people that i took care of\nor like patients at rehabs that i worked\nat were undergoing a divorce or\nseparation there has to be a consequence\nin order to drive the behavior\nand the problem is if you're like 22\nyears old and you've got a 17 year old\nlike i don't know that you can drive\nthat consequence and if your parents are\nmentally checked out i think you guys\nit's a really hard uphill battle i don't\nthink you're going to be able to fix it\non your own bluntly\nso i i mean this is what we do in parent\ncoaching is we'll help parents\nwork with their children with autism and\nset limits\nand even then especially in the cases of\nautism we also recommend\nreal mental health professional mental\nhealth help specifically because when it\ncomes to autism it's such a\nheterogeneous manifestation that there\nisn't like a playbook for autism if any\nof you all have autism or you have a\nfamily member with autism you understand\nthat there's no playbook for autism\nautism in and of itself has so many\ndifferent presentations and so setting\nup the right kind of behavioral plan for\nsomeone with autism requires you\nunderstanding\nwhere their deficits are and what their\nwhere their strengths are\nright\nand so for example one just one simple\nexample is like generally speaking\npeople with autism do better with\nconcrete communication\nso like setting very firm limits that\nare like super concrete it's not like\nget good grades\nlike that's too abstract so you have to\nbe like you have to study for a minimum\nof two hours a day and get scores higher\nthan 90.\nand if you don't do that we will reduce\nyour gaming time by this amount\nso it needs to become like a very\nstrict kind of behavioral plan\nthen i think this is where you know i\nhate to say it chat but sometimes we do\nhelp your parents set better limits on\nyou which i think is something that you\nall appreciate over time so that we've\nheard on stream as well from guests\nwe've heard you know\nlike burnt out gifted kids say yeah i\nwish my parents you know were stricter\non me like i wish they forced me to\nstudy when i was a kid so that i knew\nhow to study as an adult\nso sometimes we really encourage hard\nlimit setting\nand so when it comes to autism i think\nas a 22 year old i just don't know how\nmuch you're capable of because if you\nguys have decided that you're not going\nto seek mental health help and your dad\nis basically mentally checked out and\nyou guys aren't going to set limits on\nthe kid i don't i don't know what you\ncan do as a 22 year old you can ask him\nyou can say hey like what do you think\nabout your gaming\nit's disruptive for me\nbut i i think getting him to a therapist\nand maybe talking to your parents about\nlike hey i'm worried like maybe the best\nthing you can do is talk to your parents\nand say hey i'm worried about my brother\nlike i think this is getting worse what\ndo you all think\nand then your parents are gonna say like\nyeah it's getting worse but we don't\nknow what to do\nand that's when you can say okay so if\nyou don't know what to do i don't know\nwhat to do either\ngenerally speaking when you don't know\nwhat to do maybe we should go consult a\nprofessional because it's their job to\nknow what to do\nright i don't think that he's like ill\nor anything and it's not like you guys\nare doing a bad job but it just feels to\nme like we're outgunned in this\nsituation so maybe we need to get a\nlittle bit of help\nand i think if you can really win over\nyour parents and get them to a\nprofessional\nthat'll be like the first step\nyou"
