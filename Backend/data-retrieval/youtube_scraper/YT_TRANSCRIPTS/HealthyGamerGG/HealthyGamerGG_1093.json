    "transcript": "this is not the life that i wanted right\ni took all the right steps and i ended\nup in the wrong place\ni've wasted six years towards working uh\nworking towards a degree i hate\nchemistry i'm also terrified of dropping\nout\nso hi some background info i used to be\na straight a student in high school\nbut didn't have any interest to pursue\nin university so i applied to chemistry\nbecause it was my highest grade\ni have spent six long years in\nuniversity for a program i have zero\ninterest in and quite frankly despised\nbeing in during these six years i've\ntaken many different subjects for my\nelectives in hopes of finding something\ni'm passionate about math biology\nkinesiology psychology philosophy\nnone of them really clicked for me but\nnow i'm considering a full switch into\ncomputer science which would require me\nto switch schools since my gpa is low\nuh-oh\nmy problem is i'm incredibly ashamed of\nhow much time i've sunk oh look\nit's almost like this is a test case\nchat my problem is i'm incredibly\nashamed of how much i've sunk into this\ndegree that's made me extremely\nmiserable my peers are all graduated\nthere's the comparison some have jobs\nsome are starting a family some about to\ncompete their master's programs\nmeanwhile i feel anxious and depressed\nbeing where they were six years ago\nit feels so difficult to leave\nleave it since it's really all i've had\nin the past six years\ni don't know if i'm capable of going\ninto a new degree and starting fresh at\nthe age of 24\nbut i also know i'll hate my life if i\nstay\ni'm also afraid of how my parents may\nreact when i tell them i've wasted so\nmuch money in tuition rent etc my\nparents worked extremely hard and i'm i\nfeel extremely grateful that they helped\nme pay for my college funds\ni feel this pressure to succeed and\nprovide for them like they did for me\nbut at the same time i've come to a\npoint where my mental health is\ncrumbling and i'm not sure how much more\nof this i can take\nmy parents don't know i'm struggling\nwith these thoughts but even sharing\nproblems with them would make me feel\nlike a failure or disappointment\ni don't really know what it is i think\ni'll gain from posting this maybe i just\nwanted to vent and hear other people's\nthoughts\nps never been to therapy thought of\ngoing to one provided by the school but\ni've heard they treat students with\nrude and with little respect\nokay\nso uh you know\nlet's talk about this all right so this\nis the case of what seems like a 24 year\nold who has been in college for\nsix years studying chemistry\nfeels obligated\nto\nstay and finish their degree really\nhates their degree is burnt out\nyou know has some of the gifted syndrome\nkind of stuff going on right so a's in\na's early on crappy gpa in college\na shame gap\nthat is based on what they're expecting\nof themselves and what they're capable\nof has a lot of comparison so what's\ngoing on in this person and why\nare more and more people at the age of\n22 or 24 struggling to finish college\nand like not sure what to do they feel\nlike trapped between continuing this\nthing that they've already invested so\nmuch in\nversus kind of giving up and then like\nif you give up like that's the last nail\nin the coffin then you've really given\nup and then like\nyou haven't really\nwasted those six years right until you\ngive up\nso this is the tricky thing about this\nsituation let's just talk about that for\na second\nif you finish\nthe last six of your years of your life\nhaven't been a waste\nright it just took a better late than\nnever it's not like you wasted six years\nbecause at least they're counting\ntowards something took you a couple\nother years but at least you didn't\nwaste it\nwhereas giving up which is what you want\nto do more than anything else\nmeans that you've wasted those six years\nso now we really understand why this\nperson is stuck\nbecause every day they continue they\nhaven't given up and if they haven't\ngiven up they haven't wasted six years\nof their life so they propagate they\nstay in this dead\ncareer path this dead major\nfor the sake of not wasting six years of\ntheir life and in doing so they've\nwasted six years of their life right\nbecause now if you're giving up this\nperson probably had those thoughts like\neven before they picked the major\nbut they sort of kept like plowing\nforward like because\nout of avoidance of giving up and\nwasting all of that time because it's\nall wasted if i give up\nand so this is the biggest problem right\nso this is how\nkids nowadays i'm i guess this person\nisn't a kid end up in what i call an\nearly life crisis\nso a lot of times people talk about\nmid-life crises right and traditionally\npeople will usually talk about men and\nwhat will happen is like dudes will get\ntheir hair colored like sometimes\nthey'll go through a divorce they'll\nhave an affair or even if they don't\nhave an affair go through divorce\nthey'll buy like some really expensive\ncar\nthat you know has a retractable roof\nand they'll drive around and there's\nlike the mid-life crisis right\nso what we're seeing time and time again\nis what i would call the early life\ncrisis and there's like a generation of\npeople having an early life crisis and\nthis is a classic example of this like i\npicked a major for all the wrong reasons\nor i picked a career because i thought\nit would be safe or good or whatever i'm\njust deeply deeply unhappy in it i'm\nburnt out i can't continue but i can't\nstop\nbecause if i stop it'll be a waste\nand they're stuck so this is the early\nlife crisis so why is this happening\nmore than it used to\nso what used to happen within a midlife\ncrisis is you got a lot of reassurance\nthat hey this is what you need to do\nthis week it'll get better at the end\nit'll get better at the end it'll get\nbetter at the end\nand so you're kind of like blind right\nlike you're just kind of like you're\nvote your fo your vision is like focused\nand forward you kind of just chugging\nalong it'll get better i'll be happy one\nday like once i'm done with school i'll\nget a job then i'll be happy once you\nget the job once i get promoted i'll be\nhappy because we're just told by\neveryone that you'll be happy in the\nfuture you'll be happy in the future\nyou'll be happy in the future\nand then you you try that for a while 10\nyears 12 years 15 years and then you\nkind of hit this mid-life crisis where\nyou're like this is not the life that i\nwanted right i took all the right steps\nand i ended up in the wrong place and\nthen you have this mid-life crisis i'm\n40 years old like how can i start over\nhow do i find joy what happens sometimes\nyou get divorced sometimes you start\ndating a 25 year old like you know there\nare all kinds of things that that\nmark the midlife crisis\nso nowadays what we have is the early\nlife crisis and why is that\ni think it's because there's an\nincreased awareness\nthat didn't used to be there so if we\nlook at the big difference between like\n40 years ago and today\nthere's a dissemination of awareness i\nmean dissemination of information and\nincreased awareness of like where things\nare heading because people are\ncommunicating more now right so this\nperson is posting this thing because\nthey've seen other people post similar\nthoughts so there's almost like a\npermission to explore these feelings to\nhave these feelings\nwe're all kind of more cosmically aware\nthat like if we put our heads down and\nplow forward we're not guaranteed\nsuccess\nthat's the promise we were given like 30\n40 years ago that's the promise of my\ngeneration the millennial generation\npromise we were given is that if you put\nyour head down and you work really hard\nyou'll be happy\nturned out that that wasn't the case and\nso our my generation the millennials\nlike we all sort of suffered for a while\nright like we're trying to figure this\nout and then like the generation beneath\nus recognizes they're so much more\nself-aware than they've ever been\nthey're so much more aware that like\nlife on autopilot is not going to bring\nyou happiness so people start to\nquestion more they start to wonder more\nthey start to like recognize like oh i'm\nburnt out like this is becoming more of\na thing\nand so we have early life crises so\nhere's my experience as a psychiatrist\nhaving an early life crisis is way\nbetter than having a mid-life crisis so\nin a weird way i think this is actually\nhealthy for our society\nso when i was struggling 24 years old\nhad just graduated from college and\ncouldn't get a job\nhad applied to medical school got 40\nrejections\nyou know couldn't get a job as a\nresearch assistant like i didn't know\nwhat i was doing with my life like i\nwasn't doing anything\nso i had to do a lot of hard soul\nsearching and thankfully i did that soul\nsearching when i was like 24\nand then like figured things out by the\ntime i was 28\nand then it was fine because i had sort\nof figured everything out and i don't\nthink i'm headed towards a midlife\ncrisis\nright so i'm almost 40 now but you know\ni'm not ex\ngenerally speaking things are going\npretty good so i don't think i'm gonna\nwake up in three years and be like\ni made a mistake where did my life go\ni'm pretty happy with how things have\ngone and i do think that i would have\nbeen very unhappy if i hadn't gone\nthrough that process\nso this is the thing if you all are in\nan early life crisis i think there are a\ncouple of really important things to\nrecognize the first is to recognize that\nwhat you're going through is actually\nquite common and it's actually really\nimportant that the early life crisis is\na voice within you that's actually\ntrying to guide you you're not wasting\nyour life by giving up on chemistry\nyou're starting to live your life\nthere are a couple of things that are\nreally important to recognize here one\nis that this person\nyou know we tend to only value things\nthat move towards our final goal\nso for me for example like i'm not\nreally much of a clinician now right i\ndo maybe i see five to ten hours of\npatients per week\nand and like but it took me years and\nyears of seeing patients to realize\nthat\nlike\nit's not actually my favorite thing in\nthe world\nand so sometimes i think what we\nunderestimate is like the value of\neducation so what i mean by education is\nnot what you learn in school but like\nspending six years of your life to like\ndiscover what you truly love or look for\nwhat you truly love and realize that oh\ni'm not going to like changing majors is\nnot the solution to finding what i truly\nlove\nthat's a very very important discovery\nbecause what it means is that no major\nwill satisfy you so you shouldn't pick\nyour major based on satisfaction you\nneed to start looking for satisfaction\nin other ways maybe cs will be in the\nright direction\nthis is the other thing is because we\nexpect\nour majors or our careers or our classes\nto fulfill us\nwhereas learning that\nyour major is not going to give you\nfulfillment is actually a very very\nimportant lesson why is that because\nthat changes your expectations\nokay i'm not going to find my passion in\ncollege so i might as well pick\nsomething i know it's going to suck\ni'm not expecting it to be anything\nbetter than that you let go of your\nexpectations you'll start enjoying it\nso it's it's the price of education it's\nthe price of learning and you have a\nmid-life crisis you have an early life\ncrisis\nso i think the best thing to do if\nyou're in an early life crisis is kind\nof listen to yourself recognize also\nthat you haven't necessarily wasted time\nyou just spent time learning what you\ndidn't like\nright so finding your favorite food\nis not about just eating your favorite\nfood right it's about trying lots of\ndifferent things until you find\nsomething that you like\nfinding the right person assuming that\nyou're into monogamy and all that good\nstuff like you want to get married right\nso it's sort of a different it's a value\nsystem that i'm assuming there\nlike finding the right person to marry\ninvolves looking through a lot of wrong\npeople right that's just how it works\nand so something about the way that we\njudge ourselves when it comes to life is\nthat the only thing that the benchmark\nthat we set ourselves up against is\nperfection\n4.0 in high school 4.0 in college off to\nstart your own company or go to law\nschool or get an mba and then i'm going\nto go vp of this at this place then i'm\ngoing to do this and then i'm going to\nget stock options and i'm going to go\nhere and i'm gonna start my own company\nand i'm gonna be i'm gonna retire at 45\nright we expect nothing but perfection\nfrom ourselves there's no time in our in\nour\nplan for life for detours or like\nlearning things or figuring things out\nlike we just expect ourselves to just\nthink about how absurd this is we expect\n18 year old kids who have never been in\ncollege and have no idea what they want\nto do with their life to pick a major\nthat sort of commits them to a career\npath like what the hell\nhow on earth are you supposed to commit\nyou get an 18 year old to commit to a\ncareer path\nthey've never done anything\nbut this is the way that society exists\nthey ask you to make commitments and\nthen you get into the sunk cost fallacy\nright where it's like throwing good\nmoney after bad well i did chemistry\nbecause it's the best score that i had\nso i might as well do something i'm good\nat\nand then you spend you\nare doing chemistry for one year and\nyou're like well\nit's not like i like anything else so\nlet me continue chemistry you do\nchemistry for two years well i'm not\nreally liking this so much let me try\nkinesiology let me try physiology it's\nnot like i like any of those things i\nguess i'll stick with chemistry year\nfour\ni don't actually like chemistry so i'm\ngoing to drop half these classes i i\ncan't motivate myself year five years\nsix\nit's like what else am i going to do i\ndon't know so i might as well just keep\ndoing this\nso it's it's terrifying\nlike the situations that we put people\nin\nand so now what's happening is there's a\nraised awareness of this people are\nrealizing like oh other people are\nunhappy too it's actually okay to be\nunhappy so then they post things like\nthis and then you have an early life\ncrisis what do i want to do with my life\nthat's what our entire audience is it's\nlike a group of people having an early\nlife crisis\nand like because\nyou know we have more than five viewers\nit seems like it's a societal problem\nwhich is totally okay so i had an early\nlife crisis i thought it was fantastic i\nthink the best thing that ever happened\nto me\ni would be so miserable if i got into\nmedical school right away because then i\nwould have like become a cardiologist or\nsurgeon or something like that because\nit was all about ego\ni i would have been embarrassed to\nbecome a psychiatrist even though it's\nwhat i love\ni'd have been like that's not a real\ndoctor like people aren't gonna like be\nlike oh\npsychiatrist is not a real doctor\nyou know like all that stupid ego stuff\nwould have dictated my life\nand i would have been miserable\nbut i've been rich and miserable\ninstead\ni'm streaming on twitch and wearing a\nhoodie and this is my work for the day\nright\nand so i know it's it's terrifying but\nlike\ntake the time that you need to figure\nout the things that you need to figure\nout very practically if you have to have\nconversations with your parents you have\nconversations with your parents\nand like what you tell your parents is\nlook\ni've tried my level best to make this\nwork i'm just incredibly unhappy\nand\nyou know i don't really think that\nlike\nthis is gonna work for me\nit's gonna be tough\nyou know\nand like i'm trying to figure out how to\nhonor your sacrifice\ni'm trying to figure out how to do\nsomething that i can repay everything\nthat you've done for me with\nbut i just don't think it's chemistry\nand i need some time to try to figure\nthat out and i like to like explore what\nto do with my life i tried living on\nautopilot for far too long and it's just\nnot working\nand this is the key thing that you\nreally have to understand\nso for all these people who are in early\nlife crisis here's the key thing to\nremember\nit's\nit's the avoidance of the conflict\nthat keeps you paralyzed and stuck on\nautopilot right so in this person it's\nlike coming to terms with like dropping\nout of college\nkept you major in in chemistry\ncoming to terms with\ndisappointing your parents is too hard\nso you're not going to say anything to\nthem because even telling them you're\ngoing to feel like a failure so it's the\navoidance of that conflict which keeps\nyou in autopilot because you're like\nsticking your head in this end you're\nlike this is not working anymore but i\ncan't change it i can't disappoint\npeople i can't quit i can't do any of\nthose things even though every fiber of\nmy being is telling me to do those\nthings and so internally you're tortured\nyou're stuck you're being pulled in two\ndifferent directions you're being torn\napart because you want to avoid the\nnegative consequence you want to avoid\nthe conflict you're scared of what your\nparents will say or think so instead of\nactually fixing the problem all you do\nis pretend that everything is okay so\nyour parents\ndon't realize we can't let them know\nthat you're not really enjoying yourself\nthey may put two and two together\nbecause first of all they're your\nparents and secondly you've been in\nundergrad for six years so maybe they\nmay know something is up but let's not\nworry about that right now\nright it's recognizing that internally\nyou're not willing to like grieve or\ngive up or mourn the price of what\nyou've done so you say stay stuck and\nthen year seven goes by year eight goes\nby year nine goes by and if you do that\nfor a while then you end up with a\nmidlife crisis\nthat's what all the people with midlife\ncrises were doing\nthey would just keep plowing forward to\navoid conflict and don't accept what's\nactually wrong in your life don't try to\ndo anything about it\njust pretend everything is okay\nit's like the band continuing to play\nwhen the titanic is sinking\njust pretend the problem doesn't exist\ni'm not listening\n[Music]\nright so it's really challenging to\nconfront your fears\nso now we're going to give you a nyani\nyoga practice for that\nyou guys may think that oh path of\nknowledge that's great i don't actually\nhave to sit down and meditate like i can\njust think my way to enlightenment\nabsolutely my friend the path of\nknowledge is for you\nso you guys ready for your path of\nknowledge\npractice for\nif you have an early life crisis and\nyou're avoiding conflict and don't want\nto admit to yourself that your life is\nempty and on autopilot\nhere it is\nthe next time you go out to eat\nwhen a waiter asks you\nhow is your food\ncomplain that is the practice\nsay hey if there's anything wrong with\nyour food don't just like complain just\nbecause there's anything you don't like\nabout your food it needs a little bit\nmore salt needs a little bit more sauce\nhas too much sauce just complain just be\nlike you know\nit's not the best to be honest\nif you don't think if you'd give it like\na seven out of ten tell them you know\ni'd give it a seven out of ten i think i\nneed to do this this than this\ndo it politely don't be an\nyou know don't be a karen\njust be honest\njust tell them\nhonestly i'm a little bit disappointed\nit's kind of undercooked in the middle\ntell them\nright be respectful be kind be\ncompassionate but be honest\nand then that's where it's kind of like\nyeah don't lie i'm not telling you guys\nto lie i'm just saying if there's some\nproblem with your food just tell your\nwaiter\nor waitress\nright no it's not being a douchebag so\nif you're disrespectful about it that's\nbeing a douchebag if you blame the\nwaiter and be like\nthrow a temper tantrum\nif you like no you if they ask you how's\nyour food just answer the question that\nthey asked you\nright that's all i'm saying you should\ndo and if you like it then you can say\nthat too\njust tell them honestly what you think\nabout the food\nand now notice within yourself what\nhappens\nwhen you start to do that\nbecause what is this a practice of why\nis this\nwhy is this a meditation practice is dr\nk just trying to make you feel\nuncomfortable well yeah that's a little\nbit of that\nbut what it really is is recognizing\nwhen i feel something on the inside\nand i hold it in for the sake of\ndisrupting other people's ruffling other\npeople's feathers that's how you get\ninto an early life crisis like this\nbecause you're so conflict-avoided that\nyou can't even own something as simple\nas my sandwich has too much tomato\nyou know like that's all\nand so practice this is what nyani yogg\nis what happens within you and then pay\nattention what makes it hard to do what\nmakes it easy to do how is it received\nby other people\ncan you vocalize what you truly feel\ninternally even if it sets someone up to\nfeel a little bit bad because here's the\nreally cool thing so if you guys are\nafraid of making people feel bad you\nknow if you get something and it's not\nwhat you if you really want to be nasty\nabout it if you want to be like\nslytherin style then you can like when\nthey order something and then tell them\nyou ordered something else and like\nthat's lying though but you know i don't\nthink you should do something like that\nbut and because here's the cool thing is\nlike oftentimes chefs and waiters will\nlike want to fix it for you right\nand so you let them fix it for you then\nyou can give them honest feedback you'd\nbe like hey this is so much better i\nreally appreciate it oh yeah just like\nthat side of sauce really fix things\ncan i get some ketchup oh the ketchup\nactually fixes it thank you so much\nright you can you can do you can be a\ngood person i'm not saying don't be a\ngood person you have to be an evil\nperson but be honest\nthis is\nto be honest with the people around you\nbe authentic with yourself and do so in\na compassionate way and if you are so\nit's so hard for you to do that because\nthen that's why we pick it right nyan\nyoga is like\nthere's no you can't it's not as easy as\njust sitting there and breathing so nyan\nyoga is actually regarded as the hardest\npath to enlightenment\nand so there are a bunch of people out\nthere like you thinking oh i have such\nhigh iq i can do path of knowledge easy\npeasy no\nit's the path of contemplation it's not\nthe path of information\nnot yan yoga is not gained just by\nreading books it's gained by the\napplication of what you read into\nlike experiments on the self\nso give it a shot there's your on your\npractice okay\nyou"
