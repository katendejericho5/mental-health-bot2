    "transcript": "and so it's kind of tricky because like\nno matter what we do like someone's\ngoing to be unhappy someone wants\nsomething a little bit more entertaining\nsomeone wants something a little bit\nmore in-depth and so we try to just kind\nof struggle or balance it all\nso do you want your\nyour question answered by dr k on stream\nthe honest guide\num so step number one make a clickbait\ntitle have your problem be on the\nextreme end of the spectrum nothing\nshort of spectacular will do you spend\n300 a month uh monthly on only fans\nwrong you have bank drafted your entire\nfamily and taken out loans on your house\nto pay for your only fans addiction you\nhad to buy a big swimming pool to store\nall the bath water you've been buying on\nebay\nhave your problem be in either of these\noh let's upvote either of these three\ncategories that are approved of as\ntwitch and meme bait be a sex addict aka\nonly fans addiction have extreme beliefs\nabout women aka incel fail to date or be\nin a healthy relationship to a\nspectacular and humoristic\nlevel\nthis is me poking a bit of fun but\nsomething i feel is an evolving problem\nover the last year the content have gone\nfrom being relatable levels of problems\nto only extreme and bizarre problems\ngets highlighted\ni do accept that some people have these\nextreme problems and they sure deserve\nhelp too but i thought the goal of aoe\nhealing and and are the streams hitting\nthe most people when aimed at the end of\nthe bell curve instead of the middle\ni can't help to feel that these po posts\nget hand-picked for being sensational\nwith the goal of being good\nentertainment to watch while eating\npopcorn and not aim to help as many as\npossible at the same time maybe luring\nin as many people into the computer\ncommunity with popcorn friendly content\nis the best way to help as many people\nas possible if you got this far bravo\nyour attention span is excellent would\nlove to hear some discussion in the\ncomments\nright\nso\num you know the other thing that we can\nadd is is what about\nmaking a post that is critical and will\ncreate drama does that does that\nincrease your chances of getting viewed\non stream so\nlike i said i kind of feel like\nlecturing today because i'm feeling like\na little bit philosophical but i think\nthis person brings up a lot of problems\nwhich frankly we struggle with\non a daily basis\nand i i love actually talking about this\nstuff so i'm going to just kind of like\nfreestyle and and share with you all a\nlittle bit about what our dilemma is and\nhow we approach like what we pick\nand i think it's cool because there's\nlike stuff going on on the internet\nwhich we fall victim to as well and we\nlike are kind of aware of but it's it's\nreally fascinating so let's just let's\njust talk about how we pick stuff on the\ninternet okay\nso the first thing is that like\nyou know\nif we're trying to help the most so this\nis the i'm genuinely asking y'all okay\nso i'm gonna share the conclusions that\nwe've come to at healthy gamer but i'm\nnot saying by any means we're right i'm\nsaying these are the conclusions that\ncame to we came to and if you have a\nbetter solution by all means please let\nus know like because this is a serious\nis this a bug\nso like here's here's the problem right\nso like if you think about making\ncontent on the internet\nwe can make like the most useful content\nin the world it can be like super super\nin-depth\nand like it can be aiming to help like a\nlot of people like goes into a lot of\ndetail\num you know really kind of digs in deep\nand then it's a little bit unclear like\nwhether that will actually do well okay\nso like i'll give you guys just an\nexample so let's take a look at\num\nright so like\nlet's kind of let's just take a quick\nlook at our youtube channel\ni'm not suggesting that\nthis isn't perfect information but this\nis the struggle that we have okay\nso like let's just look at our youtube\nchannel so like\ni think the motivation and goal setting\nseminar that we did i think is like a\nreally good example of us trying really\nhard to make the world a better place\nwe're trying to sort of you know really\nhelp people by like understanding like\nin detail like how does motivation work\nokay\nso\nlet's just see where the other one is\nyeah so motivation goals like part four\nhas uh\nso motivation like you know has 20 000\nviews like let's see the next one\nso this one was like uploaded two weeks\nago like has 36 000 views\nthis one was uploaded like a month ago\nhas like 81 000 views views this one has\n100 000 views right and then like\nhow do i poop in public is like maybe\naround the same quality right\nand so\nyou know like it's tricky because like\nwe'll have we'll make this kind of\ncontent right like so we'll spend a\nwhole week\nstreaming like in depth about like how\nto actually help people with motivation\nand the truth is that like most people\ntend to not be too interested in that\nright so like and that's kind of the\nsort of tricky thing is that if we look\nat like you know how do i poop in public\nlike so there are some things that\nsometimes we kind of get it right which\nis like why adhd is linked to addiction\nthat was a month ago 300 000 views\nreally interesting video i think we like\neducate people like we educate and try\nto help and sort of make it sort of\ninteresting as well\num you know there are different other\nthings like you know why you get ghosted\nand it's it's why it's your fault you\ngot ghosted like that video was uploaded\ntwo days ago already has as many views\nas like basically day one of our\nmotivation video\nand so it's kind of interesting because\nyou know at healthy gamer like we really\ntry to struggle like we struggle a lot\nwith trying to figure out\nyou know is our goal here to be like\neducational or is it to like try to help\npeople or is it to entertain people you\nknow one of the things that i struggle\nwith is let's say i'm making a video\nthat's 90 entertaining and has like\nbrings 10 percent value versus a video\nthat has 10\nentertainment and 90 value like i think\nthat's a good example of like the\nmotivation series right and we kind of\ndid that and that was like metrics wise\nlike one of our worst weeks in like the\nhistory of healthy gamer so when we kind\nof kind of go big towards trying to like\nhelp people it turns out that like\npeople generally speaking are not too\ninterested in it\nso we we really struggle with trying to\nfigure out you know how to make things\nlike what's the balance between like\nentertainment and education because this\nperson did sort of elude\nthey kind of figured it out which is\nlike from my perspective\nyou know the more entertaining and\nrelatable we make things the more people\nwe can reach so if i have a video that\nyou know is 80 entertainment and 20\neducation and that video reaches a\nmillion people do i help more people\ndoes it is that better than like a video\nthat's 100 educational that only reaches\nlike a thousand people\nso it's a it's a real problem that we\nkind of struggle with and and what we\ntry to end up doing is like all of the\nabove right so we just go through cycles\nof like different stuff so we'll sort of\naccept that you know metrics isn't\neverything and our primary goal is like\nnot to grow the channel as big as\npossible so if we spend one week kind of\nfocusing on motivation and like 95 of\nthe internet doesn't really care about\nit like that's okay because the truth is\nthat there are a chunk of people in our\ncommunity that that really helps a lot\ni think the second thing to kind of\nthink a little bit about is you know\nthis person was saying a year ago things\nwere much more relatable so the second\nchallenge we face at healthy gamer is do\nwe basically do the same content over\nand over and over again or do we expand\nto different kinds of content so a good\nexample of this is like anxiety right so\nlike the first year or two that we were\nwe were around like\n20 to 30 percent of our content was like\nanxiety we were doing interviews about\nanxiety we were teaching about anxiety\nwe were talking about like anxiety and\nbreathing and anxiety and this and\nanxiety and that\nand then like we sort of did that for a\nwhile and this is kind of the challenge\nof twitch is that like twitch is not a\ngreat place to store content right\nso then like we sort of run into a a\nproblem where\nyou know people who have been watching\nit let's say like we do a piece about\nanxiety today\nthe people who've been watching us for a\nyear or two are like ah this is boring\ni've heard this all before it's like a\nrehash of everything that i've already\nheard and so they're not happy and the\npeople who are relatively newer\nor maybe missed some of that stuff we're\nlike oh like why don't you talk about\nthings that are like more relatable like\nanxiety\num\nand so it's kind of tricky because like\nno matter what we do like someone's\ngonna be unhappy someone wants something\na little bit more entertaining someone\nwants something a little bit more\nin-depth and so we try to just kind of\nstruggle or balance it all\nand i think the interesting thing here\nis that one of the one of the\nthe third kind of issue here is\nsomething that we call online drift\nso this is something that's really\nreally interesting so it's happening all\nover the internet and we're not\nimpervious to it so part of what we try\nto do at healthygamer is like give\npeople what they want right so we're\nlike trying to figure out you know it's\nnot like i wake up and i say like hey\ntoday i'm going to just talk about this\nbecause this is what i think is\nimportant we're really here what i\nreally view myself as and what we view\nourselves as is we are a resource\nfor the digital generation relating to\nmental health things so our compass\nactually comes from y'all so the\nquestion is like what do you all want\nwhat is important to you and that's what\nwe'll actually go and do right so case\nin point i actually really appreciate\nand love posts like this on our\nsubreddit because it helps us understand\nlike what we could be doing better\nand so the challenge with that is that\nlike so if we make one so this person\nkind of mentioned like only fans right\nso if we make one video about only fans\nand that video does really really well\nthen what's gonna happen is like people\nwho resonate with the video are then\ngonna post their follow-up questions\nright we're gonna see a lot of different\nviews and we're gonna see like oh like\npeople will say things like um you know\nthis is like really helpful to me like\nthank you so much for posting this we\nsee five more posts pop up about only\nfans because we made one video about it\npeople got excited they wanted to engage\nin discussion they engage in discussion\nwhich is fantastic that's exactly what\nwe're here for right we're here to help\npeople with like pornography addiction\nor only fans stuff or parasocial\nrelationships or whatever\nand then what happens is like we think\noh people are super interested in this\nbecause the video got a really positive\nresponse so maybe we can like explore\nthis issue more and then we'll make\nanother video about like sex related\nstuff for like parasocial relationships\nor whatever and so then what you'll see\nover time is kind of this like online\ndrift\ntowards like more and more extreme stuff\nbecause we did the basic video let's do\nan advanced video let's do an even more\nadvanced video let's do a super in-depth\nvideo and so there's this kind of\nperception that we're like going to the\nextreme and this is actually happening\nthis online drift is happening all over\nthe internet right and what's happening\nis like almost this this cosmic\ninternet wide what i would call middle\nchild syndrome so there's like this\nthing in psychiatry that's sort of true\ni mean it hasn't isn't really true but\nthe idea is there\nthat the middle child kind of gets\nscrewed you know the the oldest child is\nsort of like golden child they're the\nonly kid there everyone pays attention\nto them you know like because they're\nthe only kid right and then the second\nchild gets bored and they get some\nattention and then the third child shows\nup and they're the youngest they're the\nbaby everyone kind of like fawns on them\nso you've got the you know the oldest\nchild kind of trailblazing at the front\nand you've got the youngest child\ngetting pampered at the back and like\nthe middle child the person in the\nmiddle sort of gets forgotten right and\nthey kind of get like left behind and\nthis is what we're seeing on a cosmic\nlevel on the internet right so we're\nseeing like radicalization of of all\ndimensions so we're seeing like\npolitical radicalization we're seeing\nlike radicalization between different\nkinds of gamers right we're seeing\nradicalization even between twitch\nstreamers like where like the people who\nare fans of this twitch streamer the\nstands of this twitch streamer will go\nand fight with the stands of the other\nother streamer and it's like you know 30\nyears ago like the outsiders kind of\nthing where you've got these two\ndifferent gangs and then like we're\ngonna go have a war on this subreddit on\nthis particular day and it's like\neveryone suit up like let's go and let's\ngo and battle right we also see this in\nterms of like you know romance and\ndating where you've got like kind of the\nin-cell red pill kind of crowd and\nsometimes the incel and red pill crowd\nfights against each other and on the\nflip side of the spectrum you also have\nlike forever alone and female dating\nstrategy and which is like kind of like\nfemale red pill i guess i'm sorry i\ndon't really know too much about it i\ndon't mean to offend anyone and so we're\nseeing radicalization all over the place\nso the other interesting thing about\nthat is that like\nyou know part of the reason this is\nhappening is because people who held\nviews that kind of got tempered\nby you know forcing you to interact with\nlike people within your community now if\nyou hold like a view that's like quite\nrare within like the hundred people that\nyou know in real life\non the internet you can meet a group of\npeople that will share that view and\nthen if you guys create an echo chamber\nand you all all like talk to each other\nabout this echo chamber kind of stuff\nthen what happens is you end up like\ngoing further and further and further\nlike down the path right and then you\nbelieve that this is reality because\neveryone that you talk to has the same\nshared experience\nand so this online drift is a huge\nproblem on the internet and i think that\nall the content aggregation platforms\nare like a big part of it i don't really\nblame them for it because you know the\ngoal of the content aggregation platform\nis to give you what you're interested in\nright they're like thousands or not\nbillions of posts on the internet\nand so like you know you'll have a\nwebsite like reddit or facebook or\nyoutube\nthat will sort of try to recommend\nthings to you that you may like\nand so as the content algorithm like\nrecommends things to you that you like\nlike let's say that you're you know like\na big fan of jordan peterson versus like\nyou're a huge you know new age feminist\ni don't even know what that means\njust you're a feminist you're gonna get\nrecommended down different trajectories\nin youtube\nand so there's no like cross\nlike there's no crossing of like the\ndivide of beliefs\nand so this kind of online drift\nis an example of like we suffer from\nthis too right and like this is how we\nsuffer from it we're aware of it\nlike\nwe just we're not really sure how to\nnavigate it because how do we know\nokay is this a case of online drift or\nand this is what i suspect specifically\nabout only fans is that these parasocial\nrelationships and like pornographic\naddiction problems are far more\nprevalent than we ever really realized\nbecause these problems are evolving so\nfive years ago the relationship that\npeople had to pornography and the\nrelationship that they have to only fans\nnow has like changed a lot right and\npart of the reason that we try to focus\non it like personally like i think the\nreason we focus on it is because i do\nthink it's actually a much bigger\nproblem than people realize i do suspect\nthat the prevalence is way higher than\npeople realize\non the flip side of that so this is also\nwhy we made like dr k's guide because we\nrealize that there's a certain amount of\ninformation about anxiety or depression\nthat people are always going to want\nlike there's a reason why dr k's guide\nis anxiety depression and meditation\nlike these are the three\ncentral pillars that our community has\nbeen interested in\nso we decided to do is like go through\nall of our content really package it up\nfrom start to finish added a lot of\nin-depth stuff that most people like\ndidn't care about to be honest so if we\nlook at our stream numbers for example\nlike can anyone guess when the most\npeople leave our stream\nright so if we want to like\nlike there's one thing that we can do to\nincrease our stream numbers can anyone\nguess what it is\nwe want to boost our meta our stream\nnumbers\nit's meditation absolutely\nright\nso cutting meditation from the stream is\nthe best way to improve our med our our\nstream numbers\nit's kind of interesting so that that's\nwhere like it and at the end of the day\nlike you know that's where we have to\nmake like a mission-based\ndecision like do we want to teach\nmeditation on stream or not and the\nanswer is like yeah we do because like\nthat's part of who we are and if people\nwant to leave like that's totally fine\nif they want to move on to the next\nthing like that's totally fine and on\nthe flip side the other thing that we\nsort of discovered is that like people\nwant more meditation but we can't really\nteach advanced meditation on stream\nbecause like people are coming in and\nout you don't know who's done it you\ndon't know who hasn't you don't want to\nteach an advanced meditation technique\nto people who are new\nand so then that's why we made dr k's\nguide because like that's sort of a\nstorehouse of content that's also why we\nhave a youtube channel so that people\nwho are interested in like the more\nrelatable stuff\num or like the more basic stuff like\nit's all there on youtube like you know\nthere are tons of videos on anxiety tons\nof videos about you know\ndepression tons of videos about trauma\nlike adhd like all that stuff is there\nyou just have to go look for it\nand so that's the struggle that we have\ni think the other thing that um we can\nkind of talk about a little bit\nis\nto think a little bit about where people\nin our community are\nso what i'd like to do now is\nshare with you all how we think about\nhelping people\nand so what i the reason i think this is\nimportant is because\nif you look at yourself like a lot of\npeople want to change so you may want to\nchange you may want to say like okay i\nwant to do something about my anxiety i\nwant to do something to get physically\nin shape i really do want to pick up a\nnew hobby i really do care about and\nwant to\num\nyou know change like i want to improve\nmy life but when it comes down to it\noftentimes we just don't right so a lot\nof people in our community who want to\nchange but they just find it very very\nhard to actually start changing and this\nhas a big part of our our\nuh how we design content as well so like\nso you know this is the so there are a\nlot of people who let's say don't\nrealize\nthey need to change\nand then over here they're also people\nwho\nwant\nchange\nbut\ndon't\nactually change\nand then then there are people who are\nlike ready to change\nlike yeah like i really do like i've\nmade up my mind\nand then there are the people who\nactually in the process of changing\nokay so when we look at our community\nand if you're someone out there who is\nlike basically trying like i don't know\nif this makes sense but a lot like a lot\nof y'all may want to change like you\nreally do want it right like you want to\nchange your life you want to go out and\nmake new friends you want to go out and\nask your crush out on a date you want to\nyou know brush up your online dating\nprofile you want to switch careers you\nwant to start writing you know your tv\nshow or your script you want to learn a\nnew instrument like there are all these\nthings that you want to do but you can't\nactually change so i'd say the majority\nof people in our community are actually\nhere\nand and so this is where let's kind of\nthink a little bit about like what's an\nexample of this or\nand so then what we try to do is is\nbefore we get to the example let's kind\nof think a little bit about how we craft\ncontent\nso\nhere's where we create like you know\nmeme entertainment content so the\nadvantage of making this kind of content\nis that people are like not looking for\nanswers they're just you know looking\nfor entertainment and so sometimes we'll\ndo this kind of thing like i think the\njimmy from philly we don't really try to\ncreate meme content but\nuh the jimmy from philly example a video\nis i think a really good example of this\nwhere\num\nyou know in order to like it's people\ncame in the door because they heard\nabout like the wildness of the interview\nand they walked away like\nwanting to work on themselves or\nlearning a little bit about compassion\nit's almost like tricking people\ninto being better humans\nso\nthis is also where like we could do a\nlot of interesting entertaining content\nbut like we don't you know what we what\nwe sometimes want to do is like trick\npeople into like you know wanting to\nchange\nright\nso so like it\ni mean i say tricking people because\nyou know clearly the reason people are\ncoming in the door is not for some kind\nof help so this is also what we can call\nlike you know raising awareness so the\ngoal of this kind of content is not like\nreally to\nget anyone to change it's just helping\npeople understand oh maybe like this is\nmy problem maybe i never realized that\nthis was going on and now it's so it's\nreally about raising awareness and the\ngoal of this sort of content is a little\nbit different\nthen we get this camp and this is where\nwe like what we really want to do is\nfocus on like internal conflict\nso an excellent example of this kind of\nthing is the interview with mudahar\nso if you guys haven't watched that i'd\nreally check it out like if you're\nsomeone who's struggling like there's a\npart of you that really wants to change\nbut you can't bring yourself to do it i\nthink the mudahar interview is actually\nlike a really really good example of\nwhat you should watch\nand and the reason is because mudahar\nbasically he comes in and he says i have\na problem and then we talk about it for\ntwo hours and then i ask him the\nquestion do you want to fix your problem\nand he says no i don't think i want to\nand so this is a very classic example of\nwhy we are we as a community are stuck\nbecause i think a lot of y'all may want\nto change and that want is genuine what\nyou don't realize is that there's\nambivalence\non the inside and what ambivalence means\nis that you're conflicted so resolving\nthat that conflict is what's necessary\nto move you\nover here across this threshold and\nwhere where you've actually made up your\nmind\nand so this is where\nyou know what we these are where our\nkind of solution based videos are\nand so sometimes we'll give we'll\nactually like give people advice right\nlike the dopamine detox video is a good\nexample of like here's the how so this\nis where we teach people the how of\nchanging in progress this is where you\nknow all this is why we teach meditation\non stream because some people are\nactually even though you know 60 of our\nviewers leave when we start teaching\nmeditation forty percent do you all stay\nbecause y'all are the ones that are like\nactually interested in meditating and\nout of the forty percent that stay half\nof y'all are actually meditating and the\nother half of you are like meaning in\nchat about meditating\nright so but and so this is where we get\nto the how this is where we get to the\nmeditation and then this is where like\nand then you know once people are like\nready for a menu basically the goal here\nis to provide a menu\nof options so like now that you're ready\nto change what's going to work for you\nand this is where actually like we get\nto our you know our for lack of a better\nterm our products\nright so this is why we have these kinds\nof things this is where coaching lives\nthis is where dr k's guide lives\nthis is where meditation also lives\nright so it's not all these things are\nnot necessarily paid so this is also\nwhere you could even say things like\ndopamine detox video there's a lot of\nstuff on youtube\nso some of our youtube videos are like\nvery like solution focused\nbut these are people who have like gone\nover that that awareness hump and so for\nthose of you who are maybe see well some\nof you all have figured this out but\nthis model that we\nuse to understand you\nactually correlates with something\ncalled the stages of change model\nand so this is what we would call\npre-contemplative\nthis is contemplative\nthis is\nplanning\nand this is action\nso this is an evidence-based model of\nbehavioral change\nthat you know i use as an addiction\npsychiatrist and basically the idea here\nis that\nthere are let's see is this catching up\num so\nor where was that yeah so this is the\nstages of change model that we use and\nso like here's an example of as an\naddiction psychiatrist\nwhat i look for so this is like you know\nlet's let's take the example of like\nmarijuana addiction\nokay so like what would someone say\nwho's in this mental stage of change so\nover here they would say\ni don't have a problem\nover here they would say there\nare upsides\nand downsides\nso a good example of this is like i want\nto quit for these reasons but i don't\nwant to quit for these reasons\nokay and then over here it's i'm ready\nto quit\nbut\ni don't know how\nso here's like the menu phase right so\ni'll say okay like do you want to go\ncold turkey do you want to just like\nsmoke on weekends do you want to go to\nalcoholics and are like you know\nmarijuana addicts anonymous like what do\nyou want to do do you want like\nmedication like you need something for\nyour anxiety like that's where you\nand then this is where you actually like\nact okay like let's go\nand so even within our community like\nthe reason that we have let's say more\nmeme heavy content is because some\npeople are over here and what these\npeople are going to respond to is like\nmemes and awareness\nget them thinking about it\nright so as a psychiatrist when i'm\nworking with someone who's\npre-contemplative i'll just ask them\nquestions i don't want to like because i\ndon't want to just you know pounce on\nand say hey you need to quit smoking pot\nbecause that's what happens a lot of\ntimes right in addictions you'll have\nfamily members that come to you and say\nhey you have a problem you need to admit\nthat you have a problem\nthis needs to stop and it doesn't work\nlike people sometimes get forced into\nrehab and then like i kick them out in a\nweek because they don't want to come\nthey don't want to be there they don't\nwant to do the work\nso they come for a week and then they\nend up getting kicked out the reason\nthey came in the first place because\ntheir wife is threatening divorce if\nthey show up and they're not doing any\nof the work so it's like hey you just go\ndude like if you're not gonna do the\nwork just go\nso you can't jump to action and this is\nthe problem within our community is that\na lot of people want to jump straight to\naction they're like what do i do about\nthis how do i fix this what's the\nsolution whereas where you really are is\nover here which is like yeah i kind of\nwant to change but i don't really want\nto change\nso even if you think about things like\nplaying video games like yeah i should\nreally stop playing video games i really\nneed to get a job it's really really\nimportant but then i'm like okay so\nuninstall all your games and go get a\njob they're like but it's boring\ni can't get the job that i want to\noh in this capitalistic society blah\nblah blah blah blah right and then like\nyou come up with all this resistance all\nthe reasons that you don't do things and\nthis is really where most of our\ncommunity is that a lot of y'all do want\nto change but you have some kind of\ninternal resistance to actually changing\nand so once you're ready to change then\nit's about figuring out a menu right\nlike is coaching right for you is dr k's\nguide right for you\nisn't just\nyoutube and twitch right for you like\nyou is going to therapy right for you\nright like do you want to do it do you\nwant a diy do you want help do you want\nour help do you need someone else's help\ndo you have like a clinical problem like\nwhat's going on here\nand then as we sort of work through\nthose things then we end up acting\nright oh i tried dr k's guide it\nactually didn't help me that much\ncoaching wasn't for me or i tried what\nwe hear more often is i've tried going\nto a therapist and it didn't help let me\ntry coaching so we'll hear that and\nthat's where you kind of get to the\naction phase and so part of the reason\nthat we approach content the way that we\ndo is because if we think about where\nyou are on this journey like ask\nyourself you know do you think you have\na problem\ndo you have a problem but you're truly\nconflicted about it and this is where i\nthink most people don't realize that\nthey're actually internally conflicted\nthat's why they don't act in the first\nplace\nand then once you've resolved that\ninternal conflict\nthen you can start to plan right but\nthis is where we see this a lot in our\ncommunity we actually see this a lot\nespecially in group coaching where\npeople will come into group coaching and\nthey'll be like\ni was hoping people would give me tips\nor a curriculum to like fix my life\ni came here looking for answers and this\nis where like we could say like okay\nhere are the answers but if this is\nwhere you are in your stages of change\nor if this is where you are in your\nstages of change giving you answers\nisn't going to help which is why you\nknow what what our coaches ask these\npeople who come in at looking for\nanswers is when someone gives you\nanswers when someone gives you advice\nwhat happens\nis your do you implement it do you\nlisten do you actually change\nand then the people are like no not\nreally and that's why they actually have\nto go here and do the actual work of\ncoaching so this is why group coaching\nis important because everyone is looking\nfor answers and if you look at blogs\nright blogs will tell you\nlike exactly what to do like you can\nread about exactly what i can tell you\nwake up every day at 6am work out for an\nhour meditate have a smoothie for\nbreakfast work on your resume apply to a\ncouple of jobs and then like do your\nwork from 12 to 8\ngo for a walk in the evening play games\nfor an hour and lights out by 10.\ni could tell you to do that but ain't no\none can actually do it\nand so this is where you know that's our\napproach is to kind of like help people\nwith their motivation not to give\nsolutions because they're like we don't\nknow what solution like some random\ncoach on the internet isn't going to\nknow what solution works for you like\nwe'll get there we have to get to know\nyou\nbut it's really working on motivation\nso we try to design content to address\nall of these different\nthings right sometimes we have\ninterviews\nthat end up over here sometimes we have\ninterviews where the person has conflict\nsometimes we even have interviews\nso we had a uh you know an interview\nwith some a guy with complex ptsd i\nthink that's i think that's what he said\nhis diagnosis was and he was like can i\never be fully healed that's a really\ninteresting interview as well and i kind\nof laid out for him okay here's the\nprocess of like how you overcome complex\nptsd from start to finish\nand so some people are ready for that\nnot everyone is ready for that some\npeople don't even realize that they have\ncomplex ptsd or that they've been\ntraumatized\nso that's kind of how we approach things\nand if if y'all are trying trying to\nfigure out you know okay like what\nwhat's right for me why can't i change\ndespite wanting to change\nthis is sort of the the thing to really\nunderstand like this is the frame of\nmind of like how change happens so this\nis the frame of mind that leads to the\nevidence-based technique of motivational\ninterviewing so how can you talk to\nsomeone to actually in a scientifically\nvalidated way increase their motivation\nto act and this is the model that we use\nso understanding this model also\nexplains why people who look for\nsolutions don't get better because the\nsolution that they look for it doesn't\nfit\nthe cognitive space that they're in\nquestions\nso part of the reason that so if you're\nsomeone who wants to change\nbut you find yourself being unable to\nchange\nand you end up looking for solutions\nright you look for this oh let me do a\ndopamine detox let me like start eating\nketo\nlet me\njust do this thing and then all my life\nwill be fixed\nand if you're one of these people that\nlike can come up with all the things\nthat you should do but you can't figure\nout why you can't do them you just can't\nbring yourself to do them you need to\nunderstand the stages of change model\nbecause this this model of like internal\nmotivation\nexplains\nwhy people can have the right answer and\nnot implement it it explains how to go\nthrough the process of being in denial\nto being internally conflicted to\nactually being prepared to act and then\nactually implementing change but until\nyou resolve that internal conflict until\nyou are aware of what's going on inside\nyou i can give you the perfect solution\nand you'll never implement it\nand so what we try to do here at healthy\ngamer is actually like our structure our\ninterviews structure our questions\nstructure our lectures to try to hit\neach of these dimensions so that we can\nhelp everyone along the spectrum the\nreal challenge is that like i would say\n75 percent of people out there\nare in the contemplative stage which\nmeans their main problem is internal\nconflict there's a part of me that does\nand there's a part of me that doesn't\ncan we do this to ourselves you can\nabsolutely do it to yourself in fact\nmost human beings do it to themselves\nright most human beings find their\ninternal motivation over a long and\npainful process\nthe advantage of you know\nwhat we try to do is accelerate that\nprocess so i i mean some i mean i guess\nthere may be theoretically cases of\npeople who wouldn't be able to do it on\ntheir own but what we really try to do\nlike our emphasis at healthy gamer is\nlike y'all can't wait like\nthere's a real cost if you spend three\nyears figuring this stuff out so we try\nto accelerate the process\nright we can guide you like that's the\nwhole point of like\ni mean anyone can start at the age of 15\nand like discover a lot of mathematics\nlike you can discover all that stuff on\nyour own\nbut depending on how much you get taught\nlike you can you know you learn the\nbasic stuff that is already known so\nmuch faster and then you can like\ndiscover like mathematics that has never\nbeen discovered before so that's what we\nreally try to do\nis there a world in\nokay so dr kane regards specifically on\ncannabis is there a world in that daily\ncontrolled use of cannabis can be\nhelping with no negative effect side\neffect am i addicted or is the substance\nhelping me for real so that's a good\nquestion so let's let's take a quick\nlook at this question as it re relates\nto cannabis use\nis there a world in which i can use\ncannabis every day and have no negative\nside effect\nam i addicted or is this substance\nhelping me and i think the biggest thing\nyou need to do is stop using the word or\nit's and okay\nso is there a world in which there's\ndaily controlled use that has no\nnegative side effect i would say no\nso there is you can use is it helping\nyou sure but is it going to have a\nnegative side effect almost undoubtedly\nso that's where like when we think about\nthe you know medical use of cannabis\nit's not about no negative side effect\nit's about the benefits outweighing the\nharm so i'll give you guys just like an\nactual example of like clinical cases of\nwhen i recommend cannabis use\nso the number one reason i will\nrecommend cannabis use is to reduce the\ndependence on prescription opioids\nso opioid addiction is far more damaging\nin my opinion than like\nsome amount of cannabis use\nso there are studies that show that if\nyou are addicted to opioids first of all\nit's very impairing ver causes a ton of\nsuffering people are in a lot of pain\nthey use a lot of opioids they're\nmentally impaired they can't work they\ncan't drive they're super constipated\num you know people are stealing their\npain meds it causes all kinds of\nproblems narcotic addiction is super bad\nthere's an opioid epidemic people are\nlike overdosing all the time\nso in a harm reduction strategy adding\ncannabis can sometimes clinically be a\ngood idea because it reduces their\ndependence on opioids now would i\nrecommend that people stay on cannabis\nand opioids for the rest of life no i\nthink that that's like that's a step\nalong your path right and ideally you\nshould be from also free from all\nsubstances\nand so can it help you sure like can\ncannabis have positive effects on\nanxiety like absolutely and can you\nbecome chemically dependent on it\nabsolutely there are also prescription\nmedications like clonazepam is a good\nexample\nthat can be very effective for anxiety\nand have people having like a chemical\ndependence on it which is unhealthy\nso i think it's all about risk versus\nbenefit and that's why you should have a\nconversation with your actual doctor to\nfigure out okay where am i on the\nspectrum\nbut my gut instinct is that 70 to 80 of\npeople who use cannabis use it in an\nunhealthy manner and it probably is like\nmore about\nlike addiction as opposed to being\ntherapeutic and that's especially like\nbasically all the people that i know\nthat use cannabis in a relatively\nhealthy way are the ones that use it\nrarely basically right like if it's like\nsomething you use like every two or\nthree months like then it's\nalmost certainly like not addictive\nbecause you just can't be addicted at\nthat point\nright so and then this is where like you\nknow if you're if you're listening to\nthis video and the idea of using\nmarijuana once every two to three months\ncreates a lot of resistance in you then\nyou may have a problem\nright\nyou"
