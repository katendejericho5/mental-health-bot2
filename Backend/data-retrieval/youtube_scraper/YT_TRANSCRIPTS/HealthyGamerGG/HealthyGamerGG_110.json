    "transcript": "one thing that I found is uh instead of\ntelling like my carry player to like\nstop going to some part of the map after\nthey die three times in that part of the\nmap I will ask them hey do you want me\nto place Wards so you don't die there\nagain or do you want to play around\nwhere I have Wards like tell me what you\nwant me to do in like 90% of the time\nwhen I ask them what do you want me to\ndo and I point out like hey I can play\naround this and place Awards where you\nkeeping dying do you want me to do that\nwhat they'll actually do is just switch\nto the right part of the map yep but if\nyou tell a question posted yeah dumb\nstop going there you keep dying they'll\nI'm do it twice as much now that's what\nthey do yeah and that that makes sense\nbecause like if if you if you had\nsomebody come and attack you for playing\nthe way that you are when you were\nfailing especially in the in the most\nvulnerable moment where deep inside you\nknow that you're screwing up and you\nwant to lash out at everyone around you\nand then you give them a Target to lash\nout of course they're going to lash out\nat you it's just going to spiral the\nwhole team out B you can't do that"
