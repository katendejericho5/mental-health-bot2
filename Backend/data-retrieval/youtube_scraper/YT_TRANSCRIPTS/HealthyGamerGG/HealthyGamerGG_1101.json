    "transcript": "we're going to talk a little bit about\nevolution\nso do you guys know what the word\nvestigial means\nhow the hell do i go outside so\nthis is the most neat thing i've ever\nposted but seriously i spend all my free\ntime on the internet watching youtube\nand playing video games i don't have any\nfriends that i see in person anymore and\nthe ones that i have online stopped\ntalking i stopped talking two months ago\ni want to meet new people i keep hearing\nthat the first step is to go out and\nactually do stuff but what does that\neven mean what even is there to do on my\nown every time i think of going to the\nbeach or the library the local state\npark on my own i cringe because i see\nmyself just awkwardly standing around\nnot really knowing what to do i have all\nthese ideas for stuff that i i think\nwould be fun to do with friends but i\ndon't have any friends and i don't like\nlooking\nawkward around other people so i don't\nwant to do them by myself\ni feel almost trapped inside my room\nbecause of this even though there's\nnothing physically preventing me from\ngetting out and it's really frustrating\nliving life like this on a day by day\nbasis i put a lot of thought into\ngetting a hobby or joining a sport or\nsomething but i've always had\na hard time finding something that\ninterests me that isn't on a computer\ni also don't want to go into a hobby\nwith the majority of my intentions being\nto meet people because then i'll put too\nmuch expectation on myself to make\nfriends and as i've learned the hard way\nmultiple times over that never goes well\nlong story short i'm at a loss here not\nreally sure what to do with myself\nso how do i make this happen\nso this is a fantastic\npost and i love\nhow self-aware people are becoming about\ntheir challenges okay\nso let's start by sort of summarizing\nyou know what this person is is kind of\ndoing\nso they've struggled they spent a lot of\ntime on the internet and they like\nliterally don't know how to go outside\nlike they don't know what the first step\nto going outside is and as as they put\nit doing stuff\nso\ni think there are also a couple of other\nthings that i want to highlight\num\ni keep hearing that the first step is to\nactually go out and actually do stuff uh\nyou know every time i think about going\nto the beach i cringe\nbecause i see myself awkwardly standing\naround\ni don't like looking awkward around\nother people so i don't want to do them\nby myself\ni feel almost trapped\nbut there's nothing preventing me\nit's really really frustrating\nright and then they've also understood\nabout like what it's like to go out with\nexpectations of making friends and so\nthat doesn't seem to work\nso\nwe're going to talk a little bit about\nevolution\nso do you guys know what the word\nvestigial means\nanyone know\nso a vestigial\nlimb is something that is like no longer\nnecessary okay\nso in evolution\nwe evolve things so for example snakes\nactually have like\nsome i think most snakes actually have\nlegs so they have these like tiny little\nlegs which are i think primarily used\nfor essentially mating\nbut they have these tiny little legs\nwhich are like tiny and small so some\npeople have said that for human beings\nthe appendix is a vestigial organ\nand so the running theory that i like\nabout what the appendix is for\nis that the appendix is a storage of\nbacteria so it's basically like if you\nlook at your intestine your intestine is\nlike a loop right and it has this little\nlike pocket off to the side let's say\nlike there's just a pocket over here\nthat just stores a bunch of bacteria and\nwhy is that important or why did that\nused to be important so as human beings\nwhen we used to get diarrheal illnesses\nour bacteria our gut would get infected\nwith some kind of bacteria and we'd\nflush that bacteria out and we'd flush\nall the bacteria out of our system and\nso then our gi tract would no longer\nhave much good bacteria\nso\nas we would get healthy again if we\nweren't careful we would populate our gi\ntract with the wrong kinds of bacteria\nafter an illness we've flushed out all\nthe good bacteria along with all the bad\nbacteria it's like we're resetting our\ngi tract so we need a place for the good\nbacteria to survive so that it can\nrepopulate our intestine and that's what\nsome people hypothesize the appendix to\nbe which is why the appendix gets\ninfected so much and inflamed so much so\nwe have appendicitis people get\nappendicitis it's quite common\nand what happens is the appendix get\ngets inflamed it usually has to be\nsurgically removed and then doctors were\nlike okay like this thing is clearly\nlike it needs to come out and then they\nstarted removing appendices and then\nwell the appendix\num appendixes maybe\nand then what they sort of discovered is\nthat like people seem to be doing fine\nwithout it so it doesn't seem like the\nappendix actually causes like losing\nyour appendix doesn't seem to cause any\nproblems so that's an example of that of\na vestigial organ maybe the appendix\ndoes do something and i just don't\nreally know about it i'm not a gi\nspecialist\nso a lot of times evolution will sort of\nhave vestigial parts that no longer\nreally serve a function\ni think what's happening right now in\nsociety is that going outside is\nsomething that used to be so basic\nand is now actually like not really\nnecessary i know it sounds kind of weird\nbut going outside to a certain degree\nhas started to become vestigial so if we\nthink about like we live in a world\nwhere there's grocery delivery where\nthere's like amazon like two hour\ndelivery where there's like doordash and\nuber eats and there's food delivery you\ncan get social you can socialize on\ndiscord you can hang out on twitch you\ncan work online you can you know so you\ncan have a job online especially during\nthe pandemic you can have a community\nonline you can play video games by the\nway you don't need to go to toys r us or\nbest buy to buy the video game anymore\nbecause you have the internet and you\njust purchase it on steam or some other\nplatform and you just download it\nso like we have a life now where going\noutside has started to become vestigial\nand so this is what happens is like when\nwe have a life that's changing and what\nwe need to survive and function changes\nthere's also a lot of judgment with\nthose changes right so you see like are\nthese articles like i see these articles\nwhere like you know essentially the\nboomer generation is like oh kids\nnowadays don't know how to change a tire\nand it's like yeah that's because first\nof all we don't need to go anywhere\neverything comes to us and secondly like\nthe\nprevalence of like uber and lyft makes\nit so that it's actually cheaper for me\nto like uber and lift around as opposed\nto owning a car\nright so like we live in a world now\nwhere i don't need to own a car and if i\ndon't need to own a car i'm never going\nto learn how to change a tire but\nthere's this societal expectation that\nbeing able to change a tire makes you\nlike a functional human being\nand so then what happens is like the\nboomers are like oh kids nowadays they\ndon't know how to change tires they\ndon't know how to like build\nfurniture\nwith their hands in all manner of other\nskills like they don't know like it's\nlike you know i'm sure 150 years ago\nwhen people started like\nbuying yogurt in grocery stores there\nwas a group of people that were like\nthese noobs don't even churn their own\nbutter anymore it's like what the hell\nlike these slackers these kids nowadays\nthey don't know how to churn their own\nbutter\nand it's like yeah they don't like no\none knows how to churn butter now like\nwhen did we stop knowing how to churn\nbutter when it became useless like you\ndon't need to churn butter anymore you\ndon't need to change the tire and now we\nget to a devastating devastating part of\nour society which is that you actually\ndon't need to go outside\nnow is it healthy to go outside\nabsolutely are you gonna suffer if you\ndon't go outside absolutely\nbut start by doing away with the shame\nright because what happens right now is\nthat your inability to go outside is\ncoming with a big side helping of shame\nit's like i'll order one\none\nplate of don't know how to go outside\ni'll take a side of shame with it right\nit's like would you like fries with that\nyeah i'll take that side of shame\nbecause society right now shames us for\nbeing able to not being able to do\nthings that we think are like normal to\ndo which in a sense like sure it was\nnormal it's not like you know 10 000\nyears ago no one had to worry about\ngoing outside because outside is all\nthere was it was like a non-issue\nbut going outside learning how to like\nread facial expressions these are things\nthat are starting to become vestigial in\nour society is it good i don't think so\nso this is where i'm gonna be a little\nbit of like a butter turner right i'm\ngonna say like you should know how to\nburp churn butter but let's start by\nacknowledging that the like now i want\nyou guys to take a step back let's look\nat it differently\nwhat kind of society so this person\ndoesn't know how to go outside right and\nwe say like shame on you like how stupid\ncan you be but let's just think about\nthis i don't think we should that's not\nthe right approach think about what kind\nof society must exist where someone can\nget to the age where this person is and\nnot know how to go outside\njust think about that what kind of\ncircumstances must exist for this kind\nof person to to be in our society\nwhat kind of circumstances must exist\nfor the term neat to even be like a\nthing\nit's not just like one person like 30\nyears ago there were no needs there was\njust like every now and then there was\nlike a dude who was sort of like a\ndeadbeat right that's what you called\nthem there it's not a it's not a like\nsocietal phenomenon i saw an article\nrecently in either the washington post\nor wall street journal or something that\n59.5\nof people going to college or women\nmen are 40\nof like people going to college now\nright so there's a societal effect\nthat's going on\nand so i want you all to understand that\nif you're in this situation like you may\nfeel ashamed and like it sort of makes\nsense because society may shame you but\njust pause for a second and think about\nwhat kinds of circumstances must exist\nfor you to evolve into the state that\nyou're in right now\nwhat has to happen in our society where\nbeing going outside becomes vestigial it\nbecomes a thing of the past right and\nwhat has to happen is that you have to\nbe able to\nget food delivered to your house\nyou have to be able to\nentertain yourself at home you have to\nbe able to work from home\nand all of these things exist and the\nfact that there's like a global pandemic\nthat's sort of forcing everyone to be at\nhome anyway is like certainly not\nhelping you guys get that right this is\nwhat's happening\nso the first thing is cut yourself a\nbreak\nbecause it's not you're not\nfundamentally messed up if you don't\nknow how to go outside it's such a basic\nthing that i would say that the more so\nfor those of you who feel ashamed of not\nknowing how to do basic things\nokay\ni want you all to understand that like\nthe more basic it is the less your fault\nit is\nbecause if it's something so fundamental\nand you haven't learned it by now that's\nactually societal it's not personal\nlike you can't get it's not like anyone\nout there doesn't know how to speak\nright like if there's someone if there's\na child out there who does not know how\nto speak at the age of 10\nthat's not their fault you guys get that\nit's like it's due to their upbringing\nlike it's like duh but when it comes to\nsome of these basic things like going\noutside we don't treat it that way we\ntreat it with shame right we're like oh\nwhat's wrong with kids nowadays like why\nare you so stupid you don't even know\nhow to go outside no it's the other way\naround the more basic it is\nthe more the less likely it is to be\nyour responsibility because no one\nbasically taught you how to go outside\nor you didn't need to you never needed\nto learn which is why you don't know how\nto do it that's the whole point behind\nevolution is evolution teaches you what\nyou need to learn\nand there are people who will now i mean\nwe've had people who've been like\nagoraphobic for you know decades but\nthis isn't agoraphobia it's now\ngenerational it's now societal so that's\nthe first thing it's vestigial\nso the second thing is like okay what do\nyou do about it right and so this is\nwhat i'd say if you're having trouble\ngoing outside don't\nover complicate it with like all of\nthese different goals at the same time\nfinding hobbies making friends things\nlike that i'd say the first thing that\nyou should do is literally go outside so\ni don't know where you live or what your\nenvironment is like but i'd grab a book\nor grab a kindle or grab your phone\nright and i do it in that order so i'd\ntry to like get something that's not\ntechnological\nand i'd like go to a part like literally\nleave your house like shower clean wear\nsome clean clothes\nand like literally just go for a walk\nlike grab your book or grab a book bag\ngo to a library or something like go to\nsome public space where it's socially\nacceptable for you to be alone and so\njust sit on a park bench and just read\nif it's a park like make sure it's not a\npark where they're just kids right so\nthat can sometimes be creepy and get you\ninto trouble\nbut like go to a public space where it's\nlike acceptable to be a lone adult and\njust hang out by yourself\nokay i'm serious\nit's unfortunate the world we live in\nright it's also like i also hear stories\nabout people who are like the wrong skin\ncolor like hanging out in a neighborhood\nwhere people don't believe they belong\nand like cops get called and stuff like\nthat\nso go to like a place where it's like\nsocially acceptable for you to be by\nyourself and be like an adult\nand and just because you because this\nperson's already saying i'm socially\nawkward so let's just acknowledge the\nworld for what it is let's not go down\nthe tangent let's accept it for what it\nis and figure out how the hell to get\noutside so i'd say grab something to do\nor you can even grab like a journal or\nsomething like grab a notebook if you\nwant to try some journaling\nand then like go to a public place and\nhang out there for half an hour 45\nminutes and just do whatever activity\nyou brought\nbreathe in the fresh air start to\nappreciate it maybe go for a walk around\nyour neighborhood or like if there's\nsome body of water like walk along the\nriver or like go to like a national park\nor like a public park and go for a\nstroll with your headphones in and\nlisten to some music or listen to an\naudio book\nthat's literally where it starts don't\neven don't even worry about interaction\nwith anyone else\nso start by literally going outside\nand so you want something to do because\nif you feel socially awkward you need to\nhave something at the very beginning\nto\nalleviate that social awkwardness and do\nsomething that you know is socially\nacceptable bonus points if you can\nactually get lost in the book so like\npeople are asking about dune like if you\nguys haven't read dune go grab dune\nyou know order it off of amazon it'll\ncome to you in a box so you don't have\nto go to a bookstore\nor if you want to if you want to go like\nif you want to go ham you can go to a\nbookstore and purchase a book you can\nsay hey i'm looking for a good book to\nread\nright and that's like second second step\nso start by literally going outside and\neither going for a walk or sitting at a\npark bench and doing some reading or\nsomething like that and then come home\nso do that ideally two to three times a\nweek and when you're ready like bump it\nup a notch so then like go to a\nbookstore and ask someone hey i'm\nlooking for something to read because\nnow you've been you've been reading dune\nright so you're halfway through dune you\nwalk into a bookstore and you interact\nwith another human being\nokay and then you're like hey i'm\nlooking for a good book to read halfway\nthrough dune i really love it do you\nhave any recommendations and here's the\ncool thing when you go into a store like\nthat and you ask a question like that\nthe person who works there like\nabsolutely loves it\npeople who work in bookstores are\nusually there for a reason they're pro\npossibly overworked and underpaid just\nlike everyone else in society but the\nreason that they do it is because they\nlove books they love recommending books\nthey like reading books i\nmost people\nright i don't know about dune two\njust personally but\nyou know and so like that's what they're\nthere for like other human beings like\nyou're gonna it's gonna be like a fun\npart of their day i can like 99\nguarantee you that they'll enjoy it if\nyou come in and you ask for a\nrecommendation\nand then you kind of\nyou know you kind of like just interact\nwith another human being don't even\nworry about making friends or things\nlike that\nand then the third step is like if if\nyou form a relationship with that person\nyou know so you like read the book then\nyou circle back and then you say like\nhey\ni really enjoy the book thank you for\nmaking the recommendation i'm interested\nin exploring more good books\nor do you know if there are anything\nlike book clubs around here that i can\nget involved in so you just ask like\nthis person at the books or you have a\nlittle bit of relationship you ask for\nwhat their name is you know you don't\nshow up every day because that's creepy\nso like you actually read the book and\nthen you like you increase the\ninteraction\nthen when you go to the book club it's\nlike it's about reading right it's not\neven about the social interaction it's\nabout reading so i like dune i like dune\ntoo like what are these people reading\nnext\nyou do the activity at hand so for\npeople who are concerned about social\ninteraction here's the main thing i'd\nsay you focus on the activity the hobby\nfirst and the social interaction second\nrecognize that people aren't there to\nmake friends and if you don't make\nfriends like that's not a big deal\nyou're there to read books\nokay\nand so you focus on the activity at hand\nand you try to enjoy that activity at\nhand and this is where the person the\nperson who made the post sort of pointed\nout that the more i get caught up about\nmaking friends like the more awkward i\nbecome the more expectations there are\nthe harder it is it's very insightful\nthat's why you don't worry about making\nfriends\nfriendship is going to be an organic\nlike happening that that once you hang\nout with people on a regular basis you\nwill start to make friends\nso friendship making friends usually\nrequires a couple of different things\nokay so here are like dr k's rules for\nmaking friends number one is it requires\nrepeated unplanned interactions okay\nso you have to just run across the same\npeople over and over and over again\nthat's why it's like easier to make\nfriends in school because i show up in\nclass and you show up in class and i see\nyou it's not like i you know we're both\nthere for class\nthe second thing is not actually common\ninterests so that's not bizarrely an\nimportant part of friendship in my\nopinion the next thing is common cause\nso you have to have like a shared goal\nthat you can sort of unite around so in\na class for example it's like you you\nthe person sitting next to you you sit\nin a particular seat where you're\ncreatures of habit next to you the same\nperson sits there every day you see this\nperson like every day in class and\nyou're like hey my name is so-and-so\nwhat's your name okay cool\nand then like one day you miss class\nand then you're like hey man do you have\nlike notes from yesterday and the dude\nis like sure and then you get the notes\nand then you all are like you're good\nthen when a test is coming up it's like\nhey dude thanks for the notes i really\nappreciate it you want to like get\ntogether or study for the test\nand the person is like sure or they'll\nsay no and it's like no big deal because\nit's not about making friends it's about\nstudying for the test\nand if you do that\nenough times and you sort of show up in\nplaces and you focus on the activity the\nfriendship will come naturally\nright\nand so yeah this is when people say skip\nclass on purpose case in point\nright so this is where a society is now\nwe have a society where like you can\nafford to skip class i went to medical\nschool and all of our lectures were\ntaped or recorded not taped because\nthat's you know\nback in the 60s\nour lectures were recorded and uploaded\nand you could watch them at home if you\nwanted to so i had some students that\nlike i had one student who lived in a\ndifferent state and would commute four\nhours to come to school like on during\nrequired things and then he was like\nin his different state and just like\nwatching videos\nright so there are people who don't go\nto class so now we wonder like oh why\naren't people why don't people have\nsocial skills because we don't need them\nanymore\nyou guys get that\nso do await the shame give your cut\nyourself a little bit of slack recognize\nthat first of all if you don't know how\nto go outside like that's not a you\nproblem\nit's like a you plus society problem\nright do you have a hand in that could\nyou have been a little bit more social\nwhen you were 14 sure could you been a\nlittle bit more social when you were 17\nsure\nso you do have some agency in that but\nit's not like you're just a reject human\nbeing it's just society hasn't needed\nyou to go outside so you didn't really\nlearn\nand then start by like literally going\noutside having some solo acceptable\nactivity and going to a neutral place\nwhere it's not awkward for you to be\nthere and just do your thing\ngo for a walk with headphones on you\nknow like listen to some music listen to\na podcast and like you can listen to a\npodcast at home\nyou know like even if you watch youtube\nvideos i don't know if you guys do this\nbut sometimes i'll listen to youtube\nlike i'll just have youtube on while i'm\nlike driving in the car if i'm like\nlistening to a video essay you don't\neven need the visuals\nand then interact with someone and then\nlike maybe like go for an activity and\nlike you'll get there slowly but surely\nright when you're going on a walk like i\nthink the the\nbro nod is something i'm a huge fan of\nright like you're walking by someone\nthis is something that i don't do this\nwith women i do it with men it's the bro\nnod right you just give them the nod\nit's like i see you and i salute you and\ni respect you it's like it's my favorite\nsocial activity the bronx is like my\nfavorite thing to do\nlike there's this like old dude like\nsome like 75 year old like dude who like\nwe go for a walk at the same time so the\ndude is like old and unretired it is\nretired i'm sure he's like this old i\nthink he's a vietnamese guy\nhe's like an old vietnamese dude who's\nlike you know\nwandering around my neighborhood\nand then like i also wander around the\nneighborhood at like 11 o'clock during\nthe day so before i stream i go for a\nwalk to clear my head and i like i\ni feel like my best friend in the\nneighborhood is a 75 year old vietnamese\nman\nand we just see each other we not do\neach other every day that's the extent\nof our interaction\nyou know and i think if i grow something\ni'll if i see him i'll i'll bring him\nsomething that i grow from my garden\nbecause i think he's got a garden too so\nwe're going to be like gardening bros\nand it's going to be like easy\nyou know it doesn't have to be anything\nmore than that\ni don't even i don't think he speaks\nenglish so i don't even think we can\nreally interact much but we don't need\nto it's just we're just gonna hang it's\ngonna be great\nright\nyeah\nso that's how you go outside\ncut yourself some slack\nif you don't know how to go outside it's\nnot entirely your fault\nyou"
