    "transcript": "dr k is your passion the same thing as\nyour purpose hi everyone lately i feel\nlike my life is my life passion is\npsychology like this is the one thing\nthat i should pursue i started thinking\nabout pursuing it in middle school or\nhigh school but then i thought it wasn't\na good idea for a while\nnow i'm thinking about it again and i'm\nalmost 25. almost every day i think\nabout the psychological struggles that\nmy friends or just people like\nco-workers have told me about and i'm\nalways applying things i learned from\nwatching your videos as well as other\nsources of information to\nto to them to try and figure them out\nsometimes i get lost in thought trying\nto solve people's mental struggles like\npuzzles and when i do feel like i found\nan answer i get excited i get the\nfeeling to tell the person right away\nbecause i think it may help them i do\nnot usually try to give advice though\nbecause i'm not properly trained to do\nso and don't want to spread\nmisinformation\ni've wondered if i i like feeding my own\nego in it but i really feel like i\ngenuinely want to help people especially\nwith things that i manage to cope with\npretty well like anxiety however maybe\ni'm wrong i'm not sure\nbut when i\nthink of pursuing psychology i think\nabout how difficult it will probably be\nand feel like i'm just not in the\nposition to pursue it\nand it appears to be competitive it\nseems like to really have a career in\nthe field i need to get a doctorate from\nan accredited school it sounds like a\nlot\ni'm barely able to take care of myself\ni'm majoring in i.t right now and i'm\nstruggling to balance it with my job and\ni'm struggling to stay motivated to\ncontinue it but i still feel like\ni have my own problems to fully overcome\nsuch as social anxiety and past traumas\nwhich i think has gotten better but\nneeds much more work i simply\njust do not feel like i'm ready to\npursue it but at the same time i wonder\nif i'll ever be ready\nand then i think is this really what i\nmeant to do\nor am i just making\nexcuses so\ngreat post\nso this is what i'll say okay\nthe biggest handicap in life is waiting\nto be ready\nso everyone wants to do things when\nthey're ready\nbut the truth is that like readiness is\nlike kind of a scam and waiting to be\nready is the most paralyzing thing that\nyou will ever experience in life\nso let's try to understand what does it\nmean to be ready so if we look at this\npost what we see is this person is like\ni'm 25 years old so maybe some shame\nthey've fallen behind things like that i\nreally care about psychology i really\ncare about helping people fantastic\nbut it's a lot of work\ni don't know if i'm gonna be ready\nand i don't even know like if i even\nstart the doctorate while i finish it\nlike will it be good enough am i going\nto be capable you see all of the excuses\nso i want this is what i want you guys\nto see okay\nall positive\ni found the answer i get excited i get\nfeeling i'm not properly trained i don't\nwant to spread information i'm trying to\nhelp people i like helping people\nand then the doubts start to arise\nright so here's like a pretty honest i\ndon't know if i'm feeding my own ego and\nthen but\nmy passion in life is psychology\nyou know i'm thinking about it again\nalmost every day i think about a\npositive positive positive positive\nbut\nappears to be competitive it sounds like\na lot i'm barely able\nmajoring struggling\ni also have my own problems to fully\novercome you see that i'm not going to\nbe ready until i fully overcome my\nproblems\ni wonder if i'll ever be ready\nright\nso this person is already starting with\nthe idea that i have to be ready\nin order to do it\nso readiness is the most paralyzing\nthing in life\nis what is readiness\nwe look at this post and i encourage you\nguys to think about it when i'm gonna be\nready to ask this person out when\nwhen i'm in shape i'll be ready to go to\nthe gym when i won't embarrass myself\ni'll be ready to apply for the job when\ni know i'm gonna get it i'm gonna be\nready to apply for college when my gpa\nis good enough i'm gonna be ready to\napply for college when i've written an\nawesome personal statement\nso what is ready\nwhat does that mean to be ready it means\nto be free of your doubts right because\nif you do it before you're ready what is\nthe experience what is the state of\nbeing before you're ready oh it may not\nwork i don't know if it'll work what if\ni can't do it i have all my crap to\novercome it may not work uncertainty\nwhat you're looking for is something to\nwipe it away readiness is like a cheat\ncode in life right it's like a cheat\nthat wipes away it's this mythical thing\nthat wipes away all of your anxieties\nand you're uncertain because when you're\nready\ni'm ready i'm confident let's do this\nlet's go\nright just you don't want all those\nfreaking anxieties and no i may not be\ngood enough it's a lot of work like i\nwant to be white i want to be free of\nall that crap i want to just wipe it\naway and once it's wiped away then i\nwill be ready once i fully overcome my\ntraumas and anxiety i've made a lot of\nprogress but i'm not ready yet i'm not\nready yet i need to fully overcome it\nright\ni will only act\nwhen it's easy for\nme my solution to success is to wipe\naway all of the negative things that i\nlive with on a daily basis and then i\nwill go i will go when i'm ready\nand this is what holds us back in life\nbecause you're never going to be ready\nwon't happen\nright think about this just think about\nthis for a second\nhow can you be ready for something\nbefore you do it it's absurd\nright like like think about becoming a\nparent like no one's ready to become a\nparent you don't know [ __ ] about being a\nparent before you become a parent like\nit's absurd\neven having a second kid\nlike\nhaving one kid and having two kids is a\ncompletely different ball game like so\nhere's the thing when you have one kid\nso thankfully i'm in an intact household\nso i'm still married right so like you\noutnumber your child\nso you like you think like okay i'm\ngonna be a decent parent because it's\nlike me and my wife and we're like tag\nteaming this right so like gg kid\nwe got this\nthen they get a second kid you think\nyou're ready because you've got a kid i\nhave a kid\nthey're two years old i've succeeded in\nparenting\nand then it's a whole different ballgame\nbecause you don't outnumber them anymore\nit's an even game it's like oh my god\nscrewed\nthere's two of them and they're both in\ndiapers\ngg like i was not expecting this\nright i was not ready for a second kid\nthe truth is in life we're never ready\nfor anything it's an absurd concept\nthe only way i was winning the game of\nbeing a parent is when i had the odds\nstacked in my favor\ni wasn't ready for the second kid i\nnever will be and you gotta have one\nanyway i mean not y'all it depends you\ngotta be ready\nbut in reality so this is the thing like\nbeing ready is the most paralyzing idea\nin life\nbecause it's it's a continually being\nready is the ultimate form of\nprocrastination\nit's like the highest level of\nprocrastination this idea of being ready\nbecause what is procrastination\nprocrastination is nothing but not today\nthat's what procrastination is right\nand until you're ready you have an\nendless supply of not today's i'm not\nready yet i need to work on this i need\nto work on this i need to overcome this\ni need to fully process my traumas\nbefore i apply for a doctorate in\npsychology what\nyou don't need to fully process anything\nyou just need to get your ass up and\napply\nbut what if i don't get in what if it's\na lot of work what if this what if that\nwhat if this what if that okay yeah sure\nwhat if all of those things what are you\nlooking for certainty\nare you like\nit's not gonna happen\nso if you guys are waiting to be ready\nfor something\nstop waiting because you'll never be\nready\nright on a more practical sense\nsometimes you'll be ready i mean i think\nthat there's you know\nlike\nthere's good reasons when people aren't\nready but for the most part what i find\nis that being ready is just like it's\nthe biggest source it's the strongest\nparalytic in life it's the ultimate form\nof procrastination so let it go\nif you want to live your life you can't\nlive your life in a pain-free way if you\nreally want to make it worth living it\ncan't be pain-free\nso to this person i would say apply for\nthe doctorate who the hell cares what if\nyou aren't ready you're just going to\nfail so do it anyway so you've got a\nchoice you can live your life so for the\nlast you're 25 years old and you've been\ninterested in psychology since middle\nschool\nso for seven years of your life you\ncould have been doing psychology and you\nchose not to or you weren't able to so\ngive yourself some forgiveness cut\nyourself a little bit of slack\nand also recognize that you've got a\nchoice\nseven years from now you could have a\ndoctorate or you could be thinking about\ndoing psychology\nright and it just apply\nwork on it try\ngive it a shot and you say oh i'm not\nready yet so what\nthe consequence of not not being ready\nis experience that's what you get by not\nbeing ready\ncould you fail sure would you could you\nget accepted sure\nbut then you're gonna learn stuff and so\nthen what happens i think it's good that\nlike you're learning stuff from here\nright\nbut it's very easy\nit's easy to watch our videos and like\nlearn something from it and like try to\ntalk to your friends and give them\nadvice but then also try not to give\nthem advice\nbecause you're not a trained\nprofessional so go be a trained\nprofessional\nif it's what you're interested in if\nit's what you're passionate about if\nit's what you've cared about since\nmiddle school then go do it\nand then you say but\nbut this but this but this but this good\nso then now you have your sequence of\nthings that you have to take care of\nright so good job you've done some of\nyour work in processing your social\nanxiety you've learned how to cope with\nanxiety like you're probably very good\nbut\nbut this but that but this but that so\nthen ask yourself this question what do\nyou what do you want your life to be\nare you ready to\nnot be ready at life or do you need to\nfix everything first you need to put all\nyour ducks in a row\nand recognize dig into that look into\nlike why do you need your ducks in a row\nbefore you start doing something\nnow what's the consequence of your ducks\nnot being in a row\nand now we come back to it failure right\nyou want everything to be perfect\nbecause if you're perfect then\neverything will work and then you can\nhave confidence that everything will\nwork\nonce you're certain then you can have\nconfidence it's an interesting oxymoron\nbecause confidence doesn't come from\ncertainty\nconfidence can't exist when there's\ncertainty\nif i'm playing sc2 and i use a map hack\nin some kind of bot to like do\neverything i can be certain that i'm\ngoing to win\nbut i'm not going to be confident in my\nskill at starcraft\nyou guys get that\nconfidence doesn't come from certainty\nit comes from uncertainty it comes from\nacting in the face of uncertainty it\ncomes from surviving uncertainty\nyou're never going to be confident if\nyou're ready\nconfidence comes from acting when you're\nnot ready from giving it a shot and\nlearning that hey even if i'm not ready\nlook at this\ni'm able to succeed\nand then you'll then you'll really be\nready then it's going to be like gg game\nover and you're going to start living\nyour life the life that you deserve to\nlive in the life that you owe yourself\nso get your ass to actually like\napplying and doing the things that you\ndo and don't wait until you're ready\ngo"
