    "transcript": "a lot of people will like so a lot of\npeople will say like go see a therapist\nbut then a lot of people are like kind\nof confused because\nthey've never seen a therapist they\ndon't know how it works and then they\nthink like oh like i don't know how to\ndo that because i've never done it\nbefore\nso that makes perfect sense because\nwe're not really taught like what the\nthe rules of therapy are\nso what we're going to try to do is i'm\ngoing to try to share a couple of like\nfour basic points about you know how to\napproach therapy\nso the first is that it's not your\nresponsibility to know what the rules of\ntherapy are so i know this is like a\nreally challenging thing to understand\nbut\nyou know when you go to the hospital\nlike let's say you go see your doctor\nlike let's say you get diagnosed with\nlike cancer okay so heaven forbid\nit's not your job to know like what to\ndo it's not even your job to like seek a\ndiagnosis right so as medical doctors\nlike all you have to do is go see your\ndoctor and your doctor it's their\nresponsibility to like you know check\nyour body\ncheck it for lumps do a colonoscopy\nafter you're 50 years old\nlike do a mammogram\nafter a certain age\nit's the expert's job to know what to do\nright so i think about like going to a\ncar mechanic like you just go in and you\nsay\nhey\nmy car is making a weird noise and\nthey're like what kind of noise and\nyou're like i don't know\nlike you know you just you're it's\nyou're not supposed to know you're not\nsupposed to know if it's a fan belt or a\ncarburetor or like a you know like\nan oil leak you're not supposed to know\nanything you're just supposed to show up\nyou're supposed to be like here i am\nhere's a basic direction for my problem\nmy car doesn't seem to be working right\nyou don't even you just say that so with\na therapist all you really need to come\nin with is like just a general reason\nand it doesn't even have to be a good\none you can just say like life is hard\nfor me right now right and they're gonna\nhelp you figure it out\nso the first thing is that you it's not\nyour responsibility like how to know\nlike how to be good in therapy like you\ncan even go in and ask your therapist\nhow am i supposed to do this i've never\ndone this before and like we're all\ntrained to help orient you to like how\nthis works so for example anytime i see\nsomeone for the first time i'll ask them\nhey have you ever been in therapy like\ndo you understand how this stuff works\nthey'll be like no and i'd be like hey\ncan i take a few minutes to explain it\nto you\nthey'll be like yeah i'd really\nappreciate that right so that's like\npart of my opener as a therapist if\nsomeone comes in i understand that like\nmost people don't know how this works so\ni have to explain to them the rules of\nthe game\nso the first thing is you don't have to\nknow so just you don't have to know\nreally anything you just show up with a\ngeneral idea of what you're looking for\nyou can say i feel depressed or i'm\nlusting over a streamer or\nyou know like whatever i don't know\nwhat's wrong with my life i just feel\nlike i'm stuck like all that kind of\nstuff is perfect you just need like one\nsentence of generally speaking why\nyou're coming you can even go in and say\nhey i'm not even sure why i'm here but\nlike i've heard that a lot of people\nbenefit from therapy so i'm here to try\nit out and like that's actually awesome\nso then like the therapist knows okay\ncool i know what i'm dealing with\nthey'll start to ask you questions and\nstuff like that they'll take over right\nyou just have to bring the car to the\nshop and then the mechanic will figure\nout what they're supposed to do\nso the second thing is that a second\nthing to understand is that therapy is\nnot a passive process\nso some people will say like oh if this\nis your problem go to therapy and so\nwhat some people will do is they'll like\ngo to therapy and they'll be like\nhere i am\ntherapize me and fix it\nyou know like but that's not actually\nhow therapy works so the success in\ntherapy has to do with how much the\npatient is invested and how much the\ntherapist is invested so when you go to\ntherapy like expect to do the work it's\nnot your job to know what you're\nsupposed to do but you still have to do\nthe work so a lot of times people will\nsay i tried therapy and it didn't work\nfor me\nand oftentimes when i dig into those\nkinds of cases i'll say like what didn't\nwork for you and oftentimes what i'll\nrun across maybe like 30 to 40 percent\nof people are like very very passive and\ndon't actually like try to do anything\nso the analogies i'd use here is like\ngoing to work with a personal trainer\nso the personal trainer is the expert\nlike you can walk up to a personal\ntrainer and you can say hey i'm trying\nto get into shape that's all you have to\nsay they will figure out they'll figure\nout the how right it's not your job to\nunderstand like how these weights work\nor whether you should do cardio or\nwhether you should do like you know\nheavy weights or like low reps or high\nreps or body weight exercises or like\nparkour or like a decathlon like it's\nnot your job to figure it out it's their\njob to figure it out but once they tell\nyou what to do\nyou have to sit down and actually lift\nthe weights and so i'd say therapy is\nkind of the same way where you can't\njust show up it's not like a passive\nprocedure like a biopsy or an x-ray\nwhere you just sit there and they do it\nto you it's not like taking a pill where\nyou just like just swallow and then like\nthe antidepressant is going to work its\nmagic as a therapy you have to be an\nactive participant and even if you say i\ndon't know how to do that that's a great\nthing to ask your therapist you can ask\nyour therapist hey how am i being active\nenough like should i be doing more like\nhow can i be a better patient in therapy\nlike\nbut generally speaking don't assume it's\na passive process understand that when\nyou go in\nthe more you think\nthe more you share and the more kind of\nvulnerable you are for lack of a better\nterm you have to try right you have to\npersevere you have to be patient those\nare all really important parts of\ntherapy so the third thing\nto understand is that in addition to\ntrying if it's not working you need to\nbring it up with your therapist this is\nprobably the thing that is\nif i were to pick one prognostic factor\nso one factor that predicts success in\ntherapy versus not success in therapy\nit's the patient bringing up their\nconcerns with the therapist\nso as a therapist we're not like mind\nreaders right if you come in and you\nkind of like\nsay and i ask you hey how are things\ngoing and you say like everything is\ngoing well because you're trying to be\npolite because you don't want your\ntherapist to feel bad\nthat their therapy is not helping you so\nyou're actually trying to protect them\nfrom feeling bad because oh it's not\ntheir fault it's your fault because you\nknow you're so depressed that you're\nunhelpable but you need to tell\ntherapists if stuff isn't working\nso you've got to say hey i've been\ncoming here for like a month or two like\ni'm not really feeling a whole lot\nbetter can we talk about that like i\nfeel like i come here every week and we\ntalk about my feelings but i actually am\nnot seeing much change in my life like\nthis is not what i was hoping for i was\nhoping for more and they may ask you\nwhat were you hoping for and then you\nmay say i'm not sure but but it isn't\nthis which is a completely acceptable\nanswer so then it is the therapist's\nresponsibility you may feel in that\nmoment like oh how is this\nperson supposed to help me if i don't\neven know what i want and then you're\ngoing to feel ashamed of yourself and\nyou're not going to want to share that\nbut it's absolutely the therapist's\nresponsibility and your responsibility\nfor the two of you to figure it out\ntogether that's what therapy is about\nit's a co-op game right\nso if someone even if you don't\nunderstand like how to cook like if you\ntake a bite of something you say it\ntastes off\nand you're not the trained chef and then\nthe chef asks you like how does it taste\noff and you're like i'm not sure\nit just doesn't taste good and then then\nlike the chef should start asking you\nquestions right they should start like\noh is it like is it too salty no okay\nfine does it need some spice no it's the\nspice is fine oh maybe like how about\nsome citrus like let's try a little bit\nof citrus and you're like oh yeah that's\nin the right direction\nso you have to bring up your concerns\nwith your therapist about it not working\nokay that's the third thing you've got\nto do and the fourth thing is to\nremember that modalities of therapy are\ndifferent so therapy much like food has\nmany different varieties okay so you've\ngot like\nthe third wave of therapies\nwhich include like a lot of mindfulness\nso this is like acceptance and\ncommitment therapy dialectical\nbehavioral therapy then before that kind\nof the second generation of therapy was\nlike cognitive behavioral therapy and so\nthat tends to be a little bit more\nstructured like sometimes you have\nworksheet and homework it's worksheets\nand homework like it's like very like\nfirst you do this then you do this then\nyou do this it's very systematic and\nthen like you know way before that you\nhad like freud and jung who would do\nlike psychoanalysis so freud would like\nhave people lay down on a couch and he\nwould sit behind them and wouldn't say\nanything for an hour and like they'd\nmeet for like one hour a day like it was\nlike a daily therapy thing where people\nare like free associating so there are\nlots of different models of therapy it's\nsort of like saying i don't like video\ngames like you may not like video you\nmay not like fps you may like you know\nmobas you may not like mobas you may\nlike you know chess you may not like\nchess you may like you know candy crush\nor whatever\nand so there are lots of different kinds\nof cuisines and lots of different types\nof therapy so if you're not if something\nisn't working for you you can also you\nknow try out something else or even\nbring that up with your therapist in\naddition to the different modalities\nthere are different levels of activity\nso one thing that i've observed is that\na lot of people seem to like my style\nwhich is a very like high activity style\nso some people don't like it like some\npeople will you know think that they\nwant me to like\nstfu\nbut\nyou know so so i think something is\nchanging where like this generation like\nthe digital generation is looking for\nmore active therapists in my experience\nso a lot of the older therapists who are\na little bit more passive who are a\nlittle bit like let's just see where\nthis goes you can't rush therapy it's\ngoing to take six months it's going to\ntake a year it's going to take two years\nit's going to take three years i get\nbored and impatient i'm like i want\nthere's a lot of impatience\nin some therapists but i think that\nthere's a lot of impatience with a lot\nof patients as well\nbut that's kind of like i think that's\nokay whereas i think a lot of my\ncolleagues like feel like that's a bad\nthing and one of the most important\nthings that you can teach in therapy is\nyou have to teach a patient to be\npatient\ni sort of disagree a little bit there\ni think it's a little bit paternalistic\nand it's like oh we have to teach you\nhow it is because you don't know the\nright the truth\nbut\nso i i think that remember that there's\na lot of different modalities of therapy\nthere's a lot of different like types of\ntherapists so two cbt therapists may not\nbe the same i've worked with some cbt\ntherapists that are very focused on the\npast i've worked some that kind of\ncompletely ignore the past\nso there's a lot of different stuff to\ndo so remember if you're kind of\nconsidering therapy and you don't know\nhow to do it\nthe first thing to remember is that\nyou're not expected how to do it they're\nthe expert right so that's what they're\nthere for they're there to help orient\nyou so just take your car to the\nmechanic and say it's making a weird\nsound and when they're like then it's\ntheir job to figure it out second thing\nis to remember that it's an active\nprocess so you can't just show up and\nlike get yourself therapized it's not\nlike getting a cortisone shot you know\ninto a joint it's not like taking an\nantibiotic pill or an antidepressant you\nhave to show up there and the therapist\nis sort of like a personal trainer or\nthat's really what we kind of think of\nas coaches\num you know the the coach is a personal\ntrainer for the mind but at the end of\nthe day you're gonna have to show up and\ndo some of the work right like ideally\n50 of it\nthird thing is if it isn't working for\nsome reason bring that up with them\nbecause that's something that you all\nhave to problem solve together and the\nfourth thing is to remember that not all\ntherapists are the same and not all\nmodalities are the same so even if you\ndon't it's you know just because you\ndon't like french cuisine doesn't mean\nyou don't like food\nit's just that's one kind of cuisine and\nthere's indian food and there's sushi\nand there's like you know\nthai food and there's like nigerian\ncuisine there's all these different\nkinds of cuisine\nand so before you write off quiz like\nfood as a whole try a couple of\ndifferent things then a couple of chefs\nwithin the cuisine right they're going\nto be like different versions of sushi\nthere's like you know the americanized\nversion of sushi which is like lots of\ndifferent toppings and sauces and stuff\nlike that and there's like the classic\nlike you know sort of japanese sushi\nwhich is just like you know\nfish\nor rice and fish with a little bit of\nwasabi or whatever there are different\nflavors of even an individual modality\nso if you guys are thinking about\ntherapy definitely check it out you\ndon't have to know how to be good at\ntherapy before you do it\nand lean on your therapist to help show\nyou the way\nyou"
