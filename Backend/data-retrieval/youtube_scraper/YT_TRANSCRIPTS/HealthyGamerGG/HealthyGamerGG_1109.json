    "transcript": "that's the big trick right that's the\ntricky thing that's the paradox of life\nis that if you want to stop being a\nfailure the first step is advertising uh\nthis is kind of interesting\nand broke sand is saying i'm a\npsychologist but had little to no\nbenefit from therapy myself for anxiety\nand depression although i know the\nliterature supports efficacy over\nplacebo my experience creates an\ninternal conflict within me when\nthinking of exercising the profession of\na therapist\ni'm considering changing career path\nbecause of this and i feel lost so i\nthink this is great\nso i mean not that you're in the\nsituation the situation's unfortunate\nbro but i think this is a a great\nexample also you may not be a bro and\nthis is a great example of like it's\nthat internal conflict that you've got\nto potentially work through with a\ntherapist right so i don't know if you\never did that but going to a therapist\nand saying hey i'm not sure if this is\nworking even though i'm a psychologist\nlike i don't i don't know exactly what\nto do about that\nit's working through that internal\nconflict which will absolutely be the\nright thing\nright because as long as that internal\nconflict is there like you're not going\nto benefit from therapy that's the first\nthing you need to go through go to\nokay\nuh yeah so but why do i want to play\nsolo so much because when you're playing\nsolo no one has to see your failures\nthat's why we love playing solo\nright\nso you guys ever do this thing where\nlike\nif you know like if you're going to a\nlan party and you haven't played a game\nthat you like practice at first before\nthe lan party so you don't get owned\nif you do that then you know why you\nplay solo\nit's one thing to be a failure it's\nanother thing to advertise it\nthat's the big trick right that's the\ntricky thing that's the paradox of life\nis that if you want to stop being a\nfailure the first step is advertising it\nthat's how you get help and help is op\nlike just think about this for a second\nchat\nthink about this there are people out\nthere who are better at this than you\nare\nand you can try to learn it yourself the\nhard way but like you can just like go\nand get help and they'll tell you how to\ndo it people are there to help you\npeople love helping you like think about\nyou like you love helping other people\ny'all are great\n[Music]\nbut\nit's it's devastating but\nremaining a failure is borum\nis\nhow can i say this\nfor most people\nthey would rather remain\na hidden failure\nthan advertise being a failure and no\nlonger being a failure\nwe'll we'll choose hidden failure over\npublic success any day of the week\nand that's one of the most devastating\nthings about being human and i think our\ncurrent like internet based environment\nonly exacerbates that\nso let go of ego meditate\nyou know\nand let yourself suck\nlike that's okay\nlike this is the other problem that\nhappens is we identify with sucking\nright so we don't say to ourselves\nlike we\nwe don't think about ourselves as\ninexperienced\nall we see is our performance so like we\nwe attribute our failures not to a lack\nof inexperience but to personality\nissues\nso we say like oh like i am lazy or i'm\nan idiot or like other people are\nsuccessful\nwe use these be verbs are am\ni am this way i am a failure i am an\nincel it's an identification with a\nthing\nyou know i am\nlike we don't say i just haven't had a\ngirlfriend yet like that's not what we\nsay\ni haven't had is like very different\nlike we identify with the thing and if\nyou look at research on psychedelics and\nmeditation\nthe method through which psychedelics\nand meditation seem to work is they\nchange your perception of identity\nso they change the identification that\nyou have with a particular condition\nso people who will use psychedelics like\nthe ones that use it in the therapeutic\nenvironment the ones that have good\nexperiences\nwill say things like i realize that i am\nnot a failure like i'm what i am is\ndifferent from a failure like and so\nthen they separate that out therapy can\ndo that meditation can do that you have\nto divorce yourself from like the\noutcomes of your actions and when you\nstart defining yourself as a failure\nthat's when you're screwed\nright because then all kinds of like\nsubconscious calculations change\nand i've come to appreciate over the\nlast couple weeks like the value of\nsubconscious calculations\nand your mind is like constantly\ncalculating about what you can do and\nwhat you can't do and if you perceive\nyourself as a failure you're kind of\nscrewed there yeah so gravy boat is\nsaying a bad trip on lsd is as helpful\nas a good one you still learn about\nyourself albeit it's chaos so that's\nwhere i'd say that you're lucky so i've\nworked with unfortunately too many\npeople who have had bad trips that have\nlike basically permanently disabled them\nso i've had people who have like ptsd\nfrom\nlsd trips and they're like not able to\nhold jobs\none person described it to me as\npermanent anxiety like this so they feel\nanxious like constantly and like i\ncouldn't\ni really couldn't help them i tried i\njust didn't it was just weird\nlike i couldn't find any like root to\ntheir anxiety or whatever\nit's weird\nso i i i wouldn't really advocate\nsubstance use especially psychedelics\nit's just\nyou're playing with fire so that's also\ntrue of like advanced meditation\ntechniques so like my teachers told me\nfor example that you know some\ntechniques that i was taught like i\nshouldn't do unless i was like with them\nand like out in the woods\nso deep meditation techniques the ones\nthat are a little bit more like\nhallucinatory\nare have been described to me as playing\nwith fire so even like the kundalini\nshakti\nis like viewed as fire that can like\nconsume you so it can burn away like all\nof your negative karmas or it can burn\naway everything so those practices need\nto be done with with a lot of care and\ncaution\nyou"
