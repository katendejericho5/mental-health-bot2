    "transcript": "so can't live a life because of social\nmy social anxiety and can't seek\ntreatment because of social anxiety\nso social anxiety is like kind of tricky\nokay so part of the reason that\nmental illness is so bad\nis because\ni kind of think about it almost like i\nthink about hiv\nso the reason that hiv is such a\ndevastating illness is because it\nimpacts your ability to fight back right\nso if we look at all of the illnesses\nin most of them you have an immune\nsystem that's fighting against the\nillness\nthe problem with a lot of mental illness\nis that we use our minds to fight back\nwe use our minds to adapt like if you\nlook at like cancer survivors for\nexample right like they use their mind\nthey're resilient they seek help\nthey go see doctors they like if their\nmind is like working okay like they\nthey will like go and like they can\nfight against the cancer because their\ntheir weapons are still intact\nthe most devastating thing about a lot\nof psychiatric illnesses like if you\nlook at depression or social anxiety\nis that they actually attack your\nability to fight back\nso the hardest thing about social\nanxiety is that it's hard to go get help\nso this is where you know if you look at\npeople\nso i'm gonna take a quick tangent so\nthey're like two personality disorders\none is avoidant personality disorder and\nthe other is schizoid personality\ndisorder so in avoidant personality\ndisorder and schizoid personality\ndisorder people are loners but there's a\nbig difference\nso avoidant people who are also kind of\non the social anxiety kind of bucket in\nmy mind\nare people that want connections but\ncan't get them and schizoid people are\njust loners so they're actually like\ncontent being alone so the tricky thing\nabout social anxiety is that you want\nconnections or if you have avoidant\npersonality disorder if you're like\navoidant right\nyou want connections but it's just\nreally really hard to get them and\nthat's just what's so devastating about\nit because like\nyou know you want the connection you\nwant to seek help but you're so damn\nsocially anxious that overcoming that\nsocial anxiety is like half the problem\nso then the question is okay what do i\ndo\nif i'm socially anxious and i can't get\ninto therapy\nand this is where the short answer is\nask for help\nso if you can't do something on your own\nand by the way if you want to think\nabout one variable that correlates with\nsuccess in life i think it's the ability\nto ask for help\nand so if you can't get a therapist on\nyour own because you're too socially\nanxious\nyou know i would say just ask for help\nand then the people with social anxiety\nmay come fire back and they may say but\nlike asking for help makes me anxious\ntoo and that's where like yeah that's\ntrue\nbut this is where in my experience even\npeople with social anxiety or even\npeople who are avoidant have some people\nthat they can't ask for help\nthere are some people that they can\nreach out to that they feel comfortable\nenough like asking for help so it's\nsomething as simple as asking um\nyou know a friend of yours like hey can\nyou help me find a therapist\nand even go to the first appointment\nlike with someone who's got social\nanxiety so sometimes i'll have you know\npatients who will come to like their\nfirst appointment with me and they'll\nlike bring a friend or bring a pet\nlike and they'll ask you know can i\nbring a pet and sometimes i'll i i have\nto say no but\ndepending on where i'm renting space\nbut sometimes they'll come in and then\ni'll say like you know if it makes you\ncomfortable and they're you know you're\nokay with them like hearing what i\nanswer about medical questions then\nthey're welcome to come in is it okay if\ni ask them to\nto\nstay out for a little while\num\nor step out for a little while so i'd\nsay in short ask for help from people\nthat you're comfortable with and there\nmay be some amount of social anxiety\nthere but this is also where like\num you know the social anxiety you have\nto overcome to go see a therapist may be\nover here but the social anxiety ask a\nfriend for help maybe over here it's\nstill going to be present maybe and then\nhopefully you have like a really good\nfriend that you feel comfortable asking\nfor help and just ask for help so ask\nthem to help you you know like look\nthrough things make appointments make\nphone calls maybe you're comfortable\ndoing all the research but you're not\ncomfortable making the phone call\ni've even done that for family members\nand stuff where like i'll even talk to\nlike i'll have some family members who\nare like very reluctant to engage in in\nlike mental health treatment or some\nvery close friends and i'll make the\nphone calls for him and i'll put it on\nspeakerphone and i'll say hey let me\nmake the phone call for you so i'm going\nto call the number because like making\nappointments not actually that hard\nright it's not like that difficult of an\ninteraction it's not like people are\ngoing to grill you\nand so you know i'll make the phone call\nfor them and even even in coaching one\nof the the things that our coaches are\nactually trained to do is to help people\novercome their resistance and\noperationalize getting into therapy so\nwe even give the coaches like sort of a\nguide\num to help their clients get into\ntherapy because sometimes coaching you\nknow sometimes people really do have\nwell coaching can improve depression and\nanxiety sometimes it appears that the\ncoach can't really diagnose things but\nthey they may really like notice they'll\nbe like okay it really seems like you\nknow something's off here and you're\nhaving a lot of trouble getting out of\nbed in the morning why don't you get a\nmental health evaluation to see if this\nis depression\nso they're kind of trained in that so\ni'd say the short answer is like ask for\nhelp if you can't do it on your own\nyou"
