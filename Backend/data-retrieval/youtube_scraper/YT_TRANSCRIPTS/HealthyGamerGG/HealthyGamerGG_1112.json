    "transcript": "okay this is a good one chat\nso how do i stop lusting over a streamer\ni work for\nhi dr kane chat i have a crush or lust\nfor a very attractive streamer i'm\nleaning more towards lust as most of my\nthoughts for her are sexual rather than\nfantasy of being in a relationship\nthis fac\ninfatuation has led me to constantly\nwanting her attention and getting\njealous when i don't get it or she gives\nit to someone else such as her boyfriend\ni know usually in this situation you\nstep away and distance yourself and use\nother activities to distract yourself\nbut i'm her editor so i'm quite\nliterally exchanging dms editing and\nphotoshopping images and videos of her\nhours every day\nit's not something i can just quit or\nfocus less on as she pays me\nsignificantly more than average since\nshe is a successful streamer youtuber\ni mean sorry for the alt account had to\nuse it since a lot of community members\nwould recognize my main account\nso let's just kind of quickly review\nwhat this uh post is sort of about so\nthere's someone who\nseems like they're a successful youtube\neditor or you know photoshopper or\nwhatever their editor\nand they have a work relationship with a\nvery attractive streamer\num\nwho seems to be female and they're\nhaving kind of lustful thoughts for this\nperson and they're trying to figure out\nyou know how to stop lusting for this\nperson\nso there are a couple of important\npoints here to think about so first of\nall this is very common right so the\nfirst thing to understand is that\nparasocial relationships are a growing\nfactor in our society so what i mean by\nparasocial relationships is you know\nlike these like relationships to a\ncertain degree with streamers youtubers\netc\num but it's not just a parasocial\nrelationship right this is like older\nthan that like people have been lusting\nover their work colleagues since you\nknow there has been work in since the\ndawn of time\nso there are a couple of important\npoints here the first thing is that you\nknow if you're in this situation and you\nfind yourself lusting over someone\num the first thing that you need to do\nis be honest with yourself so this\nperson is saying all i experience is\nlust i don't really i'm not interested\nin a relationship but if you really pay\nattention to some of the the posts and\nstuff like that it seems like they also\nfeel jealous when\nsaid streamer is like spending time with\ntheir boyfriend\nso it seems like if you really are\nhonest with yourself there's more there\nthan lust right so if you're feeling\nlike jealous or like\nupset if this person is doing more than\npotentially\nyou know\nthen\nyou have to be a little bit careful\nabout that\nthe second thing to think about is that\nyou know if all you feel is lost\njealousy is not necessarily like an\nappropriate emotion\nand what i mean by that is that like if\nall you feel is lost it shouldn't\ntheoretically matter to you whether like\nthis person is engaging in sexual\nactivity with other people because all\nyou want is sexual activity with the\nperson\nso if you you know are concerned that\nthis person is like having sex with\nsomeone else and you don't want that to\nhappen then the the truth is that you\nprobably feel more than just lust so\nthen the question becomes like why is\nlust the primary thing that you\nexperience and that's because i think\nlust is the safest feeling for people in\nthis situation to have\nright lust is the feeling that is the\nmost justifiable it's the one that\nactually hurts the least right i'm just\nhorny like that's all it's just like\nit's a physical thing so it's actually\nlike a very protective\ndiagnosis as opposed to i'm in love with\nthis person so sometimes remember that\nthe mind will tell you a lie to try to\nprotect you and one of the most common\nlies that it tells you is like\nwhen you feel like there's no\nopportunity for you to have a\nrelationship with someone your mind will\ntell you oh you're just you're just\nhorny that's it and because that becomes\nlike a lot more like internally\ntolerable so the truth is that you may\nactually have more feelings for this\nperson than just lust it's a little bit\nunclear\nto me but i would seriously explore\nthose and that'll become important in a\nsecond because\nyou know\nso the next thing is that unless you\nreally understand how you feel in the\nspectrum and depth of your feelings\ndealing with them is going to be\ndifficult because if you diagnose this\nas a problem of lust\nand you try to fix a problem of lust but\nthe truth is that there's like\nsuppressed feelings that go beyond lust\nyour solutions may not work right so if\nyou misdiagnose the problem you're not\ngoing to be able to treat it well so the\nfirst thing that you need to do is be\nhonest with yourself\nthe next thing that you need to be\ncareful about so this goes for everyone\nout there\nso a lot of times we know what we need\nto do\nbut there's a reason that we can't do it\nright so this person says\ni know that the right answer here is to\ndistance myself but\ni can't\nright and that's a very very dangerous\nway of thinking so anytime our mind is\nresistant to something\nwhat it actually does is provides us\nwith a very good logical reason that\ngives us an excuse\nto not do what we need to do so when i\nreally need to do something and i really\ndon't want to do something my mind will\nsubconsciously give me a really good\nexcuse so that i don't do it\nright and what this person is saying i'm\na successful editor i get paid above\naverage\nand so i can't leave my job right i have\nto say oh that's too bad that you have\nto stay and then internally some part of\nyou that wants to be closer to this\nperson that wants to like you know\nthere's probably some amount of\ngratification that this very successful\nand attractive youtube streamers like\nsending you like you have such an\nintimate relationship with them they\nrely on you you're a part of their life\nyou know you're responsible for their\nsuccess they owe you in some way you\nalso get to see slices of this person's\nlife that other people don't see there's\na certain intimacy there right there's\nall the plebs who get to see the\nphotoshopped images and you're the one\nthat gets to see like the real images\nthere's a lot of like thoughts there\nthat are that are kind of interesting\nthere's a lot of actually intimacy and\ncloseness in the relationship\nwhich there's a part of you that\nprobably doesn't want to give up\nand so because like there's a lot of\nlogical answers here even if you get\npaid above market rate like if you work\nwith this streamer and i'm pretty sure\nyou apply for jobs with other streamers\nlike if you're a successful editor for a\nsuccessful streamer that probably allows\nyou to you know do that kind of work for\nother people at a comparable pla pay\nbut what i'm sort of noticing in this\nsituation and this is for all of you\nguys is like\nif you know what the right answer is and\nyour mind says but i can't do it because\nof this other reason and it provides\nsome kind of justification be careful\nbecause that's a sign of resistance\nremember that the mind when it has a\nsecret desire and this is where like you\nhave to properly diagnose it as long as\nthat desire is secret it will fight\nagainst you in terms of like creating\nsome kind of artificial resistance\ni don't i mean maybe this person is\nright maybe they get paid an\ninappropriate amount and it is sort of a\nchallenge for them but that too i would\nencourage you to think long and hard\nlike just because you get paid less\nsomewhere else\ndoesn't mean that it isn't like a\nbad idea for you to switch jobs right so\nremember that what you pay for with\nfinancial security can sometimes be like\nmental health or stalling in other parts\nof your life\nlike sure you can get paid more if you\nwork 80 hours a week but is that\nactually like a trade that you want to\nmake\nthe first thing that you need to do is\nbe honest with yourself and recognize is\nthis just lust or is it more than lust\nand the challenge there is that\naccepting that it's more than lust will\nprobably be more painful because\nthe actual opportunity for a real\nrelationship may be smaller than like\njust lost\nthe second thing to do is be aware of\nyour internal resistance\nand if you know what the right answer is\nand your mind says but you can't do the\nright answer because\nof x y z be careful about that can you\nreally not do that\nis the resistance really real like that\nmay actually be true but you can\nprobably still you know exert some\ndegree of\ninfluence or change or switch your jobs\nand the third thing to consider is like\nspace in your life\nso oftentimes you know the people the\nreason that people get stuck in a\nparticular relationship is because they\ndon't create the space in their lives\nfor an alternative so i'd be really\ncurious whether this person is in a\nrelationship of their own right so are\nyou are you single are you in a\nrelationship\nthis is where we kind of get into issues\nof like emotional affairs and stuff like\nthat\num or even like you know having\npersistent sexual thoughts about someone\nwho's like outside of your\nwho your relationship is with\nso i'd really be curious about like the\nempty spaces of your life so generally\nspeaking when our when our when we have\nsome emptiness in our life\nwe tend to fill it in with some kind of\nlike\napproximation of the real thing\nright this is like one of these like you\nknow when i'm super lonely and like i i\nbuy like a a pillow that's shaped like\nanother human and i cuddle that that\npillow\nit sort of like is an approximation of\nthe real thing and it can bring me some\nkind of comfort\nbut it never really fills up the void so\nwe also see this in like substance use\nright so when i feel like lonely and bad\nabout myself i feel like empty on the\ninside and so i can seek oblivion\nthrough drugs and like it'll sort of\nfill things up kind of right so like if\ni let's say i like do a lot of coke and\ni go to a party and i like have a blast\nand i get laid and stuff like that and\nso like i fill up you know the emptiness\nin my soul with like\ndopamine\nand enjoyment and pleasure but it never\ntruly fills it up\nand what i found a lot of times is when\nwhen we're empty on the inside it can be\nreally really hard to actually get rid\nof the thing that like is holding us\nback\nso when i feel super empty inside like\ngetting sober is actually the hardest\nthing\nwhen you feel like very lonely on the\ninside sometimes stepping away from some\nof these like parasocial or work\nrelationships is actually the hardest\nthing and this is unfortunate but we're\ngoing to kind of take a quick tangent\ninto like yogic thinking\nbut anytime we feel empty inside are we\ntry to fill that emptiness through the\nindriyas or the sense organs so this is\nwhere like if you feel like alone or you\nfeel\nyou know like you're not loved or that\nyou want a fulfilling relationship or\neven if you want to get laid\nand you bombard your senses with like\nimages of this particular person\nyour your brain is going to be like oh\nwe're empty over here we're getting all\nof this like sensory input let's try to\nfill up that input over here\nand this is where you know if you really\nwant like if you really want to fill\nthis thing up you actually have to get\nrid of like the sensory inputs\nso this is where sometimes you know\npeople that i'll work with like they\nkeep on breaking up with each other and\nthen getting back together and the\nreason for that is because there's not\nactually space in their life for a new\nrelationship right so when when you\nbreak up with someone and then you're\nkind of like like then you're broken up\nand then you start like texting them\nagain and stuff like that out of habits\nand you kind of hang out with them and\nstuff like that as long as you're\nsocializing with that person there's not\ngoing to be space in your life for\nanother person so it's really important\nto be careful about the way that you\nknow you have a void and the way that\nyou fill it up through certain sensory\norgans or experiences\nand try really hard to create the space\nin your life for someone else to move in\nbecause what i'm kind of noticing in\nthis situation is that there's like\nthat thoughts of this particular\nstreamer or youtuber like you have so\nmuch sensory input they're like entering\nyour life so much\nthat there isn't space for you to like\nlust after someone else right because\nall of your lust is already occupied by\nthis person and as long as your sense\norgans are being bombarded by these\nphotoshop images for hours and hours and\nhours a day\nthen you're like you know that's gonna\nlike occupy your lust\nso i'd say um\nyou know and the last thing to kind of\nthink a little bit about is just\nacceptance and grief so this is hard but\none of the\none of the skills that we're never\ntaught\nwhich i think is one of the most\nimportant skills to learn is how to\ngrieve\nso the last thing that this person could\ndo is like grieve this loss and what do\ni mean by this loss\nit could be the the possibility that um\nyou know you'll never have a sexual\nrelationship with this person so you\nhave to kind of like let that go like\nexcept hey it's never going to happen\nthe other thing that you could do is is\ngrieve the loss of the the lack of a\ntrue relationship that you have a\nprofessional relationship and that maybe\nyou want more than lust and you just\nhave to like learn how to grieve right\nlike you can't ignore it you have to\naccept that it's there and this goes\nback to number one which is like be\nhonest with yourself\nand then like grieve it so you have to\nlike mourn it right so you have to like\nsit there and think about all the things\nthat you want\nand accept and think about how you're\nnever going to get them\nand as you go through that process of\ngrief even though it's really really\npainful because you're going to be\nuncovering all of your coping mechanisms\nand you're going to feel like naked and\nlike terrified and pathetic\nas you go through that process the good\nnews is all of that negative energy all\nof that negative emotion that you're\nsuppressing\nis actually gonna like come out it'll\noverwhelm you for a while but then it'll\nactually start to subside and then\nhopefully you'll have the space to take\nkind of the right steps forward\nso unfortunately this is something that\nwe see very commonly so this is a case\nof\nyou know someone who's close to\nlike a streamer or youtuber or something\nlike that has something of a\nprofessional relationship\nmaybe a parasocial relationship and it's\nreally challenging because it's\nhappening more and more and more so like\nbasically how do you deal with\nyou know lusting over someone that you\nmay not be able to have a relationship\nwith\nand it comes down to first of all being\nhonest with yourself because there may\nbe more there than lust and sometimes\nwhat our mind does is like tries to give\nus the most manageable version of our\nfeelings so it would be really really\nhard for you to say i'm in love with\nthis person so instead your mind is like\noh you're just horny don't worry about\nit just horniness it's like a physical\nthing comes from the scrotum no big deal\nthe next thing that you have to do is be\ncareful about your resistance because a\nlot of times in this situation we know\nexactly what we need to do but then our\nmind since it really doesn't want to\nleave will tell us oh you can't do what\nis good for you because of this reason\nbut the more that you look at that\nreason the more you realize actually\nlike you can do something about it right\nthis person could try to apply for being\nan editor for like they're they're like\nliterally\n10 000\nstreamers or youtubers out there that\nare relatively successful right there's\nso many different platforms there's\ninstagram there's facebook there's\nyoutube there's twitch\nand if you have a resume where you've\nhelped this person like and you put on\nyour resume i started editing when this\nperson was this big now they're this big\nyou know i'm very professional like i\nhelp people like succeed and put forward\nthe best best content there will people\nthere will be people who will hire you\nyou just have to apply for enough jobs\nbut this person says but i can't so be\ncareful about your internal resistance\nbecause chances are there's a\nsubconscious feeling that's\ndriving you and telling you logically\nyou can't leave because it doesn't want\nto leave so it'll provide for you the\nbest argument that it can to keep you\nthere\nnext thing to kind of think a little bit\nabout is making sure that there's space\nin your life so sometimes when we have\nthese kind of relationships with people\nthat are sort of like infatuations or\nlust or parasocial the reason that we\ncan't get free of them is because we\ndon't have something else in our life to\nlean on\nso\num you know be a little bit careful\nabout creating the space in your life so\nthat you can kind of move from\nyou know this unhealthy relationship to\na healthy relationship\nand a lot of times\nwhen we feel like an emptiness inside\nwe'll fill up that emptiness through our\nsense organs so as long as you feel\nempty inside and you're editing these\npictures that's going to be like a\nreally bad combination\nthe last thing you have to learn how to\ndo is you have to learn how to mourn you\nhave to learn how to grieve\nand and grieve this relationship because\nthere could have been something that was\nsuper awesome right like if you like\nreally sit down and think about the\nfantasy how awesome would it be to\nbe this person's editor and to be in a\nromantic relationship with her right to\nbe like an integral part of their\nsuccess for you all to be working\ntogether to create this brand and how\nawesome would it be if like you guys\nlike work together and like had a\npersonal relationship right there's a\nreason why a lot of people engage in\npersonal relationships like in the\nworkplace you have power couples um you\nknow i i\ni'm speaking from kind of personal\nexperience in terms of they're like a\nlot of advantages and a lot of\nattractive things\nabout working with someone who you're\nengaged in a personal relationship with\ni think 90 of the time it's a mess and\nusually unhealthy\nbut that doesn't make it any less\nattractive right it's so awesome to be\nin that ten percent so if you are in\nthis kind of situation you know my\ncondolences i think um you also may want\nto think a little bit about working with\nsomeone to kind of work through these\nfeelings because it can be really hard\nto manage on your own your mind is a\ntricky tricky thing\nand so will do its best to keep you from\nunderstanding like what's actually going\non right it's doing that to protect you\nso working with a coach or working with\num you know a therapist or something\nlike that even having like a long talk\nwith someone that you can really confide\nin\nis really really important that's part\nof what i think is the advantage of like\na coach or a therapist is that you know\nthey're they're like they're not\ninvested in anything except for you\nright they're there for you you can be\nhonest with them about the deep and\nembarrassing thoughts they may pick it\nup and they ask you questions that are\nlike hard for you to like figure out on\nyour own\nso you can always do something like that\nmake sense\noh yeah sorry the the notification is\nwrong for squid game\nis it good to address this with the\nstreamer i would say you shouldn't\naddress things\nwith the streamer yet right so when you\nlike so here's it's a really good\nquestion so like if i'm lusting over\nsomeone that at work like\nwhat should i do\nyou should settle your own feelings\nfirst before talking to them\nso you have to understand exactly what\nyou feel and you also have to understand\nthe kind of position you're putting them\nin\ni think that generally speaking like\nhonesty and authenticity is like a good\nthing to have but you also have to\nrecognize that like that may place a\nburden on someone else\nand part of the reason there is that\nlike the reason this is so bewildering\nfor the other person is because you've\nconstructed like\nlike you've spent\na thousand hours thinking about this\nwhereas like the streamer will have\nspent\nmaybe zero\nso when you kind of like present them\nwith a conversation they're gonna feel\nlike really shocked and generally\nspeaking it's gonna be hard for them to\nrespond in a positive way\nso you know you're kind of like it's\nhard to describe but you're sort of like\nyou've got one leg up on them because\nyou've been thinking about it for a long\ntime and it may be like completely new\nto them\nso i think a good example of this is um\ni saw a post recently in in the\npolyamory subreddit\nabout\nyou know someone was kind of saying like\nsomeone like one partner had been like\nworking with paulie feelings for like\nfive years\nand then like the other partner they'd\nbeen in a monogamous relationship and so\nthen like you know the partner who\nthought their polly was like hey this is\nhow i feel\nyou know and then like a month later\nthey're like so can i can we open up the\nrelationship and then like the other\nperson was like\nyou've been thinking about this for five\nyears i've been processing it for one\nmonth like i need more time\nand so you have to remember that you can\ndo a lot of processing internally but\nanytime you have a conversation with\nsomeone you have to give them time to\nprocess\ni do think in a perfect world it's\nactually okay and maybe even\nprofessional to share with the streamer\nyou know why you're leaving and when you\nask for like a reference or something\nlike that you can say hey it's kind of\nweird but like for some reason like my\nmind is going into weird places about\nthis relationship it's not genuinely how\ni feel about you and like you know i\nrespect you a lot as a professional\ncolleague and i'm just having trouble\ndealing with these things i don't expect\nyou to do anything about it\nand i definitely don't want to put you\nin an awkward circumstance\nso um i think the best thing for me to\ndo is actually leave like i'll help you\nfind a replacement absolutely i'd really\nappreciate a reference um i'm still like\nyou know i still care about you a lot as\na professional colleague i hope you do\nreally well but just for personal\nreasons i think i have to you know step\naway from this job\nis that cool and just be like kind of\nprofessional about it and say like hey\nyou know like it's just getting weird to\nbe like editing your pictures all the\ntime\nso\nyou can always have a conversation like\nthat but i'd say be careful about it you\nknow and then the other thing is that if\nyou want to go for love you can always\nconfess your feelings and see what\nhappens but that's probably not going to\nend well"
