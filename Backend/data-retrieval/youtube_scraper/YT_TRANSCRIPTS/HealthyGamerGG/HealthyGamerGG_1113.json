    "transcript": "at the end of the day\nwhat is in your mind when you set out to\ndo a task drastically alters how\nsuccessful you are so today what i'd\nlike to do is uh\num share a couple of thoughts with y'all\nthe first is on a very high level\nhow i think about performance\nso having worked um having consulted at\nstartups having worked with c-suite\nexecutives having worked at investment\nbanks having worked at major tech\ncompanies\nuh in terms of like optimizing their\nperformance working with like content\ncreators\num you know physical athletes like nfl\nplayers football players things like\nthat\nand also working with like students and\nand you know medical students things\nlike that\nwhat i've come to realize and now having\nworked uh very intensively with an\nesports team we've i've done work with\nesports for the last three years\num but this was is definitely like the\nmost intensive engagement\nwhat i've kind of realized is that like\nit boils down to four things and what i\nlike to do today is share\nwhat i would call the four pillars of\nperformance\nand this is where if we kind of take a\nstep back like it kind of goes back to\nwhat i was saying earlier which is that\nat the end of the day you can be an\nesports professional a physical athlete\na student\num a parent\nuh or like a ceo and at the end of the\nday\nyou're human right so the common element\nis not the industry it's the human\nso what can we understand from a human\nperspective from a personal perspective\nthat will translate into success in any\nof those fields\nand too often i think what we have is\nlike we have like industry specific\num\nresults like we have industry specific\nlike performance improvement right so\nfor example there will be someone who\nspecializes as a sports psychologist and\nthey have a lot to offer don't get me\nwrong you'll have someone who\nspecializes in like you know physical\nsports you'll have you know people who\nspecialize as like consultants for\nyou know investment banks or like\nconsultants for like it solutions or\nthings like that so we'll have a lot of\nlike industry specific support which is\nwonderful and it's very effective don't\nget me wrong\nbut i think what's actually missing is\nsome\nsomewhat more of like\nunderstanding on a fundamental level\nwhat works in all of the industries\nright and in my experience like the\ncommon element is the fact that they're\nhumans and if we look at humans sure\nhumans can be quite different\nbut if we look at humans what we see at\nthe end of the day is that the\nsimilarity between two humans is greater\nthan the difference we all have one\nbrain two eyes you know for the most\npart two nostrils a mouth one heart two\nlungs two kidneys one stomach\nand so there's a lot of similarities\nbetween humans our brains are all wired\na certain way like we all have occipital\ncortices we all have frontal lobes\nand so there are common elements of\nperformance which i think transcend any\nindustry and the other thing that i'm\ngonna so i'd like to share with you all\nkind of my\nidea of like the four pillars of\nperformance\num\nso\nthe other thing to kind of think a\nlittle bit about and and why i sort of\ndivided it into four pillars is to\nunderstand that in my experience when\npeople are looking to improve\nthey tend to focus on one of these\nthings and neglect the others so what\ni'm going to do is share with you all\nwhat i think the four pillars of\nperformance are and then also go through\ntwo examples one is a student and one is\na programmer of like how\nhow to apply like these ideas\nand in my experience what tends to\nhappen is that people will get like\nhyper focused on one of the four pillars\nand they won't and they'll keep on\ntrying to improve that but that there's\nlike a diagnostic problem so people will\nlike diagnose themselves as like they'll\nonly look at one of these four things\nand they'll keep on trying to improve\nthat and then they end up getting\nfrustrated because they don't think\nabout these other dimensions\nso um you know\nhere are the four things that i think it\nessentially comes down to the first is\npreparation so this is like what you do\nthat sets you up in a long-term sense\nfor performance on a given day so this\ncan be like studying for example like\nfor a test right how you prepare for the\ntest will result in performance for the\ntest\nas a programmer this could have a lot to\ndo with for example\nwhere you went to school if you went to\nschool what kind of certifications you\nhave what your work experience is so\nlike did you work at this company for\nthis amount of time or this company for\nthis amount of time and i know like a\nlot of y'all are thinking like oh isn't\nisn't my performance on a test like\ndoesn't it depend on how much i study\nlike isn't that because that's what we\nsort of think of right which is exactly\nthe point which is there's way more to\nit than just how you study so\npreparation is definitely a huge part\nand generally speaking when we think\nabout performance i think preparation is\nthe first and unfortunately oftentimes\nthe only thing that people think about\nso then what happens is when they do\npoorly on the test like people get\nfrustrated they say like oh i need to\nstudy more i need to study more i need\nto study more\nthe second pillar is going to be\nadaptation so this is where when i look\nat people who are successful across\ndifferent fields what i see is that\nthere's like a big difference between\nlike the the winners and the losers\nand it's that the winners know how to\nadapt and the losers sort of don't so\ni'll give you guys kind of a quick\nexample of this\nso as a student you know if i like do\npoorly on a math test\nwhat a lot of people will do is like\nconclude and they'll say like i'm not\ngood at math and they'll sort of like\ndetermine some sense of identity around\npoor performance the tricky thing there\nis that sense of identity of i'm not\ngood at math or i'm not a math person or\num you know something like that like i\ncan't cook is a good example another\nthing that i i hear you know a lot\npeople say like oh like i just can't\ncook like it's not something that i'm\ngood at so when people will make\nessentially identity determinations\nbased on performance\nthey stop adapting right so once you say\nlike i can't cook\nthere's nothing you can do about that\nlike if you say i'm bad at math or\num you know if some people will also\nlike in the dating world they'll say\nlike i'm ugly so that's just gg right\nit's like over like i can't do anything\nabout it and so there's a fundamental\nlack of adaptation and if you look at\nthe difference between some you know you\ncan have two people who are ugly but the\ndifference between one who winds up in a\nhealthy relationship and one who stays\nalone is not the ugliness because that's\na i mean ugly people are in\nrelationships all the time i'm not\ntrying to be mean but i'm just sort of\nstepping meeting them where they're at\nand sort of assuming that that that's an\naccurate physical characterization what\ni'm saying is that there there's you\nknow you can take any kind of identifier\nof the self like ugliness or i'm stupid\nor i'm bad at math and what you'll find\nis that like of all of the people who at\none point identified as being bad at\nmath some of them will actually be very\nsuccessful in fields that require math\nright\nand the big difference is their capacity\nto adapt\num\nso someone's saying i'm low iq so here's\nwhat i'll tell you i've worked at a lot\nof\nstartups and places where there are very\nstupid people at the top and they can\nstill be really really successful right\nso like for example leadership is a good\nexample where you don't need to be smart\nyou just need to be good at managing\npeople who are smart\nright so you can\nthat doesn't need to hold you back\ni'm low iq is also a prime example of\nexactly the kind of thinking that i'm\ntalking about\nso people who don't have an adaptive\nmindset will label themselves with\nsomething that is unchangeable they'll\nsay i'm ugly i have a low iq it's like a\nthing that is like fixed right and so\nthen it's like you're screwed like i'm\njust bad at dota it's like gg game over\nthere's nothing you can do about it so\nthat dooms you to like low performance\nonce you start thinking about it that\nway so this is exactly why adaptability\nis a huge part of this right it's the\nability to adaptation is not about like\nchanging who you are it's about\naccounting for who you are and not\nletting that get in the way of your\nperformance\nso the third pillar that we're going to\ntalk about is communication so i think\nirrespective of what field you're in or\ni i guess there are a few cases where\nthis isn't true but i'd say for like you\nknow 99 of people that communication is\na skill that transcends any industry\nand that what i've seen is that people\nwho perform well in a particular\nfield\nare like tend to be good communicators\nso you can have two doctors for example\nwho have comparable iqs comparable test\nscores and comparable training\nand there's a big difference in how well\nthey do in the workplace and if you've\nworked in medicine in in any way shape\nor form you recognize you'll know this\nthat like the doctors who get along with\nother people are the ones that are going\nto have like like have a better time and\ndo a better job so there are some\ndoctors for example that are very\narrogant\nand they can still rise in positions of\npower but like if they're the more\narrogant they are and the worse they are\nat communicating like the more abusive\nthey are to their underlings and their\nnursing staff\nlike the worse they end up doing and\nthat you know generally speaking the\nbest people in the hospital are the ones\nthat like you can communicate with so\nyou know if there's some doctor\nthat you're consulting and they're like\na pain to work with then like you're not\ngoing to want to work with them and then\nlike there's a part of your mind that's\ngoing to be thinking about that and\nthey're going to be like mean to you and\nso like it doesn't and the patient is\nthe one who suffers\nand i've worked with some doctors that\nare just excellent communicators and\nlike they're by virtue of their\ncommunication skills their actual output\nimproves and so this is also true\nwhether you're looking at c-suite\nexecutives or\nstudents even and we'll kind of go into\na lot of examples for students and even\nprogrammers this is this is actually\nreally really important for programmers\nespecially because there's this idea\nthat like programmers like don't\ncommunicate right like we're all about\nsitting in front of our computer screens\nand typing things out whereas what i've\nseen when i work with clients who work\nlike you know work at places like google\nand amazon and microsoft and stuff like\nthat is that the the programmers that\nare very good at communicating like if\nyou guys have worked with good product\nuh you know project managers for example\nor um like a product dev team that\ncommunication is like absolutely vital\nto a good product\nuh there's also i forget whose law it is\nbut you know there's a law that says\nthat the\nnumber of programmers that you have\nworking on a project is inversely\ncorrelated with the speed of the project\nso if i have five programmers that it's\ngonna take\none year for them to build a product and\ni add five more people to the project it\nactually the time doesn't reduce it\nactually increases to like two years\nso this is kind of a it's sort of a meme\nbut i think there's actually a lot of\nreality to this and i think essentially\nwhat it comes down to is like\ncommunication\nso um our third pillar is gonna be good\ncommunication and if you're good at\ncommunicating you're going to like do\nbetter no matter what field you're in\nthere are a couple of exceptions to this\ni imagine like you know i've heard for\nexample that like enya who's you know\nmakes music she's like very isolative\ni've never talked to her these are all\nrumors i don't know if this is true but\ni imagine that there are some creative\npursuits and some examples of like you\nknow authors that like historically will\nlike go into the woods and like hang out\nin a cabin for a while um and and\nthey'll kind of be isolated and maybe\nthat supports creative output maybe they\ndon't need to communicate much but\ngenerally speaking i'd say 99 of that of\npeople that i've worked with need to be\ngood communicators\nthe last thing and i know it's kind of\nweird that i say this for last is\nmindset\nso at the end of the day what is in your\nmind when you set out to do a task\ndrastically alters how successful you\nare\nso um\nyou know i'll just give you guys kind of\nan example from from\nmy experience so like most of what we do\nhere at healthy gamer is mindset so\nwe'll kind of review some reddit posts\nand stuff like that you guys we kind of\nlike this is our bread and butter but i\nthink uh\nyou know even when i play a dota game\nlike there's like a mindset that you can\nhave of going in so a lot of people will\nsay that if you want to win\nin in like you know climb and dota or\nlike league of legends the first thing\nyou should do is like mute all other\nplayers right\nand so i think that that sort of makes\nsense in some ways\nbut in my experience actually like\ntrying to communicate with people and i\nknow i'm sort of talking about\ncommunication actually works pretty well\nif you get good at it right but in the\nreason i bring it up in terms of mindset\nis like if you go into the game of dota\nwith the assumption that all\ncommunication is bad\nthen it's going to sort of create a\nsituation where like communication is\nunsuccessful\nso mindset is incredibly important if\nyou go into a game of dota thinking like\noh i can actually try to communicate\nwith my teammates and i know what all\ny'all are saying y'all are saying lol\ni've tried that it doesn't work gg noob\nyou can't communicate with these animals\nand and i think that that mindset is\nactually like destroying your ability to\ncommunicate so there's overwhelming\nresearch for example that there's this\nthing called the placebo effect and what\nthe placebo effect is it's really\nbizarre but if a human being thinks\nthat something can work it actually\nobjectively increases their likelihood\nof it working now there may be some\ninteresting example uh exceptions to\nthat so for example like maybe in\ngambling like it doesn't really matter\nwhat you think i don't know i'm not\nreally sure\nbut in most industries and definitely in\nlike scientific studies like we know\nthat giving someone the same medication\nthe results of that medication or the\neffect of that medication is going to be\naltered by the mindset of the person\nand so\nthese are kind of our four pillars of\nperformance and now having worked with a\nbunch of industries i think it basically\ncomes down to these four things so\npreparation adaptation communication and\nmindset\nso the next thing that we're going to do\nis go over two examples so we're going\nto run through the case of a student in\nthe case of a programmer and we're going\nto kind of talk a little bit about how\neach of these things impacts these two\npeople's lives\nso i i picked these two examples because\nthese are um you know examples of people\nthat i've worked with like a lot of\npeople in these industries so i feel\npretty confident about what i'm about to\nshare with y'all\nso the first thing to understand is that\ngenerally speaking like i said people\nhave a diagnostic problem so most people\nwho struggle with something will\nlook for solutions not look for problems\nand i know that sounds kind of weird but\nif i'm if i'm failing math right i'm not\ngoing to google\nhow do i figure out why i'm failing at\nmath what i'm gonna google is how do i\nsucceed at math how do i get better at\nmath so the first thing that we have to\nunderstand which i think is a huge like\nsocietal problem in terms of thinking is\nthat we jump straight to treatments\nwithout understanding diagnosis because\nlike if you if you if you're bad at math\nand then you kind of say how do i study\nbetter like the problem may not be\nstudying right like there could be all\nkinds of other interventions that you\nhave which will allow you to succeed at\nmath that have nothing to do with\nstudying maybe studying isn't the\nproblem\nso let's kind of talk about prep because\nthat's where studying is so\nyou know there are some efficient ways\nof studying and that like you know if\nyou prepare appropriately like if your\npreparation is good it will lead to a\nbetter result this may be super simple\nwhen it comes to studying but like\nbasically the more you study you know at\na very high level the more you study the\nmore likely you are to succeed\nso\num\nyou know the kind of preparation that\nyou do is going to be also important so\nlike this is where okay so let's just\nsay on a high level the more you study\nthe better you do\nbut this is where it's important to\nremember that preparation is not just\nabout like brute forcing it right so um\none of the big theories that i have in\nin\nin esports for example\nis that mindlessly grinding pubs does\nnot make you better\nso in in the same way i think mindlessly\nstudying does not make you better so if\npractice was\nis all it would take to improve then we\nshould see a clear correlation between\nthe number of games played\nand\nyour skill at a particular game but we\nknow if you guys have played valorent or\nleague of legends or or you know dota or\nanything you know that there are people\nout there who have played 10 000 games\nwho are lower ranked than people who\nhave played 1000 games and so if we kind\nof think about it how the hell does that\nactually work right it's a very very\neye-opening revelation\nthat brute practice does not equal\nresults\nand so a lot of times what we'll do is\nlike if i if i do poorly on a test what\nam i going to say to myself oh i did\npoorly because i didn't study enough\nlike i studied two hours a day and i\nshould have studied four hours a day so\nwe default to making preparation one\ndimensional and brute forcing it\nso there's been a lot of research on\ndeliberate practice right which is a\nmindful or intentional practice so back\nwhen i was tutoring people in the mcat\nwhich is the medical college admissions\ntest it's the standardized test that you\nhave to take to get into medical school\ni had a big revelation which was like\nyou can take a bunch of practice tests\nand up to a point it will improve your\nscore but then what i noticed is that\nsome people would top out essentially\nand that despite taking more and more\npractice tests\ntheir scores were not improving and then\nwhat i kind of realized is that like oh\nthis is kind of interesting because\nthey may study more so like they may do\npoorly in a particular subject so\nthey'll go and like read the chapter\nagain but that doesn't actually improve\ntheir performance and essentially what\nthese people need to do is sit down and\nthis is essentially what i you know what\ni did myself and what i taught other\npeople to do\nis like look at the you know why did you\nget the questions that you got right\nright and why did you get the questions\nthat you got wrong wrong right what is\nthe reason\nfor the question you got this question\nright and the question you got this\nother question wrong so as a student a\nlot of times what i find people will do\nis just like increase their studying\ntime or they default to increasing their\nstudying time but actually being a\nlittle bit more thoughtful about the way\nthat you study can actually be very very\nhelpful and actually lead to an\nimprovement in your test scores\nso other examples of like optimization\nlike this so these are examples that i\nwould put into preparation are memory\nlike taking advantage of memory\nconsolidation so memory consolidation is\nop\nso a lot of people for example will\ncram the night before the test or what\nthey'll do is like have these marathon\nstudy sessions of like eight hours at a\nstretch right whereas like when i was in\nmedical school what i would do is\nbasically study for two hours a day and\nthen like take advantage of memory\nconsolidation by taking a nap in the\nafternoon so i would have uh you know\ncolleagues who would like like wake up\nat 8 a.m and they'd like study from 8\na.m to 8 p.m because the more hours you\nstudy the better you're gonna do and\nwhat i tended to find is that i'd study\nfor two hours a day i'd take a nap and\nthen i'd wake up and i'd like chill a\nlittle bit i'd studied for a couple more\nhours maybe\num and when preparing for a test but on\naverage i only studied for two hours a\nday and those like that those two hours\nwere like\nideal studying kind of systems and so as\nyou ideal ideally study like you\nactually don't need to study more you\ncan study less and still get a good\ngrade so i think there's a lot of\nsophistication and you can take\nadvantage of a lot of physiology and\nneuroscience and psychology to improve\nyour\nactual preparation\nso other good examples of this is like\nwhen i work with traders for example\nlike i'll sometimes get um you know\nconsulted by a group of traders\nand what they will they'll all do their\nkind of research and stuff but like\ndoing research on your own and doing\nlike 10 hours of research may or 10\nhours versus 20 hours of research you\nmay not get a whole lot out of 20 hours\nof research and what i actually found\nwhen i worked with like day traders and\nand things like that is that\num for example spending five hours\ntrading and one hour discussing what\nyou've learned with your colleagues\nleads to an improvement of performance\nover six hours of just doing research\nright so there's some things that you\ncan do to optimize your preparation\nbeyond brute force\nso that's the preparation category so we\ntalked a little bit about study habits\num\nand so what you know the key thing here\nonce again is like when people think\nlike oh i just need to study more that\nmay not be correct you may actually be\nstudying more you may be studying enough\nit's just the nature of your studying\nmay not be like optimal in some ways or\nit's not even about optimal it may\nactually be like horribly deficient in\nsome ways and another good example of\nthis is that a lot of students when they\nstudy they'll just passively read\ninstead of like taking notes\nand even their notes will be like very\npassive so what i recommend to students\nwho want to to learn actually is to like\nyou know read let's say a chapter and\nthen sit down with a blank piece of\npaper and write out what you understood\nabout the chapter because this is the\nkey thing that people don't understand\nabout like a test\nso the skill that you need for a test is\ninformation recall it's not like\ninformation going in so there's actually\nlike a difference between recalling\nstuff that's implanted and like putting\nstuff in so it's actually more efficient\nto instead of read a chapter twice to\nread it once and then spend time\nactually trying to recall it so then\nwhat you're actually doing is like\nthat's training the skill of information\nrecall\nand then when you try to recall and you\ntry to write down like all the key\nconcepts then when you go back to the\nchapter at hand and you kind of like\nlook at and then then what you do is\nyou're like very focused right because\nyou're gonna say okay the second time i\nread the chapter i'm gonna see what did\ni miss and what did i get okay i got\nthat i got that oh i missed this\nand then you don't jot it down there oh\ni missed this i missed this i missed\nthis okay let me close the book let me\ntake a brand new sheet of paper and\nlet's see if i can put everything down\nand so you're actually practicing\nexactly what you're going to need to do\nduring the test and so when people start\nto study in a situation like that it\nimproves their preparation and their\ngrades go up\nthe second\nthing that we're going to talk about is\nadaptation\nso for students\nlike i was saying a lot of people will\nmake and\nwill claim a particular identity\naround something like i'm bad at math or\ni'm just not good at studying or these\nkinds of things and so what i want y'all\nto understand this is really important\nis that there's a big difference between\nsuccessful people and non-successful\npeople and that big difference\nessentially has to do with like what\nthey do when they fail so for\nunsuccessful people what they tend to do\nis\nthey'll say like i am a failure or\nthey'll make some attribute of their\nidentity instead of adapting so instead\nof concluding that i'm bad at math the\nquestion that you should ask yourself is\nwhat can i do to get better at math what\ncan i do to get a better grade here\nright and that's it's like it's such a\nhuge problem not only within our\ncommunity but within society as a whole\nyou can ask people like all the time and\nthey'll make like all these kinds of\ninteresting statements about themselves\nthat define who they are oh i'm just not\ngood at relationships sorry\noh i'm sorry that's just the way that i\nam like if you can't like you know i'm\njust someone who sometimes loses my cool\nyou know yeah like i just like sometimes\nwhen i get drunk i do stupid things\nsorry\nand so these are people who when faced\nwith failure don't ask themselves the\nquestion how can i actually be better at\nthis there's a complete lack of\nadaptation and so as a student if you do\npoorly in a class\nit sort of doesn't matter whether you\ndid good or you did poorly the main\nquestion that you need to ask yourself\nis how can i do better right what can i\ndo differently\nand so when i work with top tier esports\nteams\nand you all will see this if you like if\nyou you know watch tournaments it's like\nsome teams will be one-trick ponies and\nthen like they can get like halfway\nthrough the tournament but they can't\nmake it to like you know\nthey'll come in with like a very clear\nstrategy that they practiced and drilled\na ton but it's the teams that are that\nare able to adapt that are the ones that\nconsistently go the mo you know the the\nlong distance\nand that's also true in life like you\ncan look at people who will get\nhamstrung by a particular thing it's\nlike if i just say that i'm bad at math\nand i'm good at these other subjects and\ni've just got like one c on my\ntranscript that's going to tank my gpa\nand decrease my chances of getting into\nlike medical school or whatever\nit's the students who are able to ask\nthemselves the question what can i do\ndifferently how can i get better at this\nhow can i adapt to this situation even\nif i am bad at math even if you accept\nthat as true what can i do about it\nthose are the ones who end up succeeding\nso if you're a student\nand you have these like defined\nqualities of yourself about yourself\nlike i am bad at this or i'm good at\nthis i'm just not a morning person there\nmay be some truth to that you may not\nhave quite the gift of mathematics that\nsomeone else has you may have a\ncircadian rhythm that's a little bit\nharder to control than other people\nbut that's not the important thing the\nimportant thing is how can you adapt to\nthat circumstance okay so if i'm not a\nmorning person how do i need to adjust\nto make sure that i i can perform well\non a test that's like scheduled for 8 am\nright you have to ask yourself that\nquestion and then that's going to be the\nfirst step to like actually figuring it\nout\nso the next thing is communication so\nthis is where i hate to break it to you\nbut like students that communicate\namongst each other and are good at\ncommunication tend to do better than\nones that are bad at communication so\ni'll give you guys just a couple of\nexamples so like study groups are really\ngood ways to like anchor you to like\nforcing you to study\nand and so what we find is that\ngenerally speaking people who form study\ngroups tend to outperform people who\ndon't\nand so a big part of forming a study\ngroup is like you know because it kind\nof forces you to study you show up other\npeople show up things like that so it\nkind of helps with the issues of\nprocrastination and motivation and stuff\nlike that but if you really look at it\nthe formation of a study group really\ncomes down to communication so one\nperson usually organizes it other people\nare like communicative enough to\num you know kind of like show up and let\nthey'll be like yeah i'll be there or\nwhatever and then there's a lot of like\ninformal communication that happens some\npeople talk to each other in class and\nthings like that\nand as students start to communicate\nbetter amongst each other it also gives\nthem like particular advantages so like\nstudents that are socially well plugged\nin and have a study group that they show\nup to on a regular basis if you're sick\nor you need notes\nlike you're much more likely to get them\nif you need help or you're struggling\nwith something and you ask for help\nwhich by the way is communication you're\nmuch more likely to like get it right\nwhereas you'll have other students who\nare not very good at communication and\nso if something bad happens if rng\nscrews them by getting sick then their\nrecovery is like way harder than the\nstudent who's the good\ncommunicator the other thing that's\nabsolutely op is that students who are\ngood at communicating will also\ncommunicate with their tas professors\nand that is a huge advantage so when i'm\nwriting someone a letter of\nrecommendation\nit's the communication that the student\nhas had with me that ultimately\ndetermines like how good the letter that\ni write is right so like writing a good\nletter of recommendation as someone who\nwrites them is all about knowing the\nperson right so like i can have two\npeople like if i if i'm teaching a class\nand they both get a's it's even gotten\nto the point where if someone gets a an\na in my class like i won't even write\nthem a letter of recommendation if i\ndon't know who they are i'll tell them\nhey i don't know who you are like i can\nall i can really say about you is that\nyou got an a in my class\ni can't really say much\nso what i've really found and i don't\nknow if you guys have known this but\nlike if if you're if your professor like\nknows who you are and you communicate\nwith them they're also much more likely\nto give you slack and this is where you\ncan say that that's unfair and i'm not\nsaying it is unfair but unfortunately\nit's like human\nand we as like social animals tend to um\nwe tend to value like communication and\npersonal relationships so this is also\nwhere like networking comes in and so\nwe'll talk about that for programmers\nbut\num you know communication is absolutely\nvital to like like success and\nperformance in the case of studying it's\nabout forming studying groups it's about\nforming relationships it's even about\ncommunicating your needs and asking for\nhelp because that all falls under\ncommunication\nthe last thing is mindset\nso this is where you know we talk about\nthis a lot\nbut generally speaking when i think\nabout mindset what i what i really think\nabout is\nuh you know things like action\norientation versus outcome orientation\nthat's all up here so you can do all of\nthe other stuff right you can\ncommunicate more you can prepare more\nyou can adapt more but what's in here is\nultimately going to shape all the other\nthree okay so in the case of mindset\nlike being able to adapt has a lot to do\nwith mindset do i understand that like\nmy identity as a human being is not\ndetermined by certain outcomes so if i\nask 10 women out and they say no does\nthat mean that i am a reject or i got\nrejected by these 10 women so there's a\nhuge difference there in terms of like\nwhat's your mindset is it egotistical\nand what i mean by egotistical is not\nlike arrogant but\nwhen things happen to you do you\nattribute them to like personal\nqualities of the self or do you\nattribute them to like potentially\nexternal factors so if i ask out 10\ngirls and like they say no that may have\nnothing to do with me one of them may\nnot be heterosexual one of them may be\nin a relationship one of them may not be\nlooking for a relationship one of them\nmay have just lost a parent to covid you\nknow one of them may like\nbe racist like you never know like\nwhat's going on in the other person's\nmind and so your mindset and what you\nidentify with in terms of like why\nthings happen to you makes a big\ndifference\nanother example of mindset is outcome\norientation versus action orientation so\nthis is a growth mindset versus\nperformance mindset which carol dweck\nhas done a lot of awesome research on\nand so the main thing that she sort of\ndiscovered and the yogis discovered this\na couple thousand years earlier is that\nlike people who devote themselves to\naction as opposed to outcomes are the\nones that perform better so when i focus\non studying as opposed to the grade um\nyou know that actually makes like a big\ndifference in terms of like what happens\nafter the test so if i am focusing on\nthe grade and i'm shooting for an a\nand i end up getting a b\nif my attitude is okay what can i do\nbetter like how can i grow from this\nthen it's actually going to boost my\nmotivation and i'll try twice as hard on\nthe next test\nif i'm focusing on getting an a and i\nwind up getting a b it actually tanks my\nmotivation and then i do half as good on\nthe next test it sort of dooms me to\ngetting a b next time so mindset\nliterally with the same result a\ndifferent mindset will lead to an\nincrease in motivation or a decrease in\nmotivation\nso the other thing in terms of mindset\nso for example when you look at\ncommunication mindset matters there too\nso there are some people who will form\nsocial connections for like personal\ngain and like that's really what's in\ntheir mind oh i need to like form a\nstudy group so that if i get sick people\nwill be able to give me notes and that's\nthe kind of thing where like you can do\nthat but i think other people will pick\nit up so why are you socializing you\nknow what is the nature of your\npreparation so even when it comes to\ncommunication like professors are pretty\ngood at picking up you know who's a\nstudent who's here to just like kiss my\nass and brown knows and who's a student\nwho's here who's genuinely trying to do\ngood in the class and is like trying to\nlearn this subject\nand so i've seen this a lot you know\nteaching at harvard medical school\nbecause everyone has to do psychiatry\nand there are two types of people who\nare like tryhards at psychiatric or\nthree types of people who are tryhards\nof psychiatry so type number one is like\ngenuinely interested in psychiatry and\nwants to be a psychiatrist tryhard type\nnumber two is like wants to be an\northopedic surgeon and needs to get\nhonors in this rotation so they're going\nto try really hard for a grade but\nactually don't give a crap about\npsychiatry and tryhard 3 is actually my\nfavorite kind is these are the people\nwho don't aren't actually interested in\npsychiatry like they're not interested\nin becoming a psychiatrist but they're\ngenuinely interested in learning it\nbecause it's like the last opportunity\nthey'll have to learn psychiatry\nthose are actually my favorite students\nto teach you don't have to like what i\nlike in order for me to like care about\nteaching you all you have to do is like\ngenuinely be interested in the material\nso even the the mindset that you have\nwill alter your communication right you\nhave this linguistic cortex you have all\nthese empathic circuits in the brain and\nso all of those things will essentially\nact in concert depending on what's on\nthe inside and if you show up with a\nstudy group and your attitude is hey\nlike if we all study together we're\ngoing to do better together right we can\nall rise together by working together\nversus joining a study group out of a\ncompetitive mindset and i'm gunning for\nnumber one and i'm going to use you guys\nto help me get to the top\nthose two mindsets are going to\ntranslate into different kinds of\ncommunication and will result in like\ndifferent things because especially like\nmed school is a good example of\nyou know half of the people are gunners\nlike when i went to med school\nat the beginning i was a gunner too and\ni hated it like it was like not who i\nwas and i was like screw this like you\nknow because what happens is there's\nlike a medical school honor society\nright and only the top 10 of students\nget into the honor society so i was like\ni'm gonna get in the honors society i'm\ngonna get in the honors society and then\nlike it turned me into like a bad person\nso i stepped away from it and then the\nsecond year i was like screw that i'm\njust gonna like learn medicine like i'm\ngonna try to learn medicine forget about\nbeing at the top of my class and then\nyou know i get an award for academic\nachievement at the end of four years\nonce i change like my mindset\nso even mindset can change like all of\nthe other dimensions we talked about\nadaptation and how mindset changes that\nwe talked about preparation we talked\nabout communication\num so the next thing that we're going to\ndo is run through all four of these as a\nprogrammer so the first thing is like\npreparation right so depending on how\nyou learn programming and like what are\nyour you know avenues of like preparing\nto be a programmer that can obviously\nadjust how successful you are so for\nexample if i'm gonna program um\nso you know depending on where you train\nor like whether you do different kinds\nof certification courses or things like\nthat some programmers will learn like\nancillary stuff so they'll learn stuff\nthat's a little bit about uh different\nfrom their own field which i think makes\nthem far more effective programmers so\nfor example like even if my job isn't ui\nux but i like spend some time learning\nabout ui ux it'll probably help me like\nin my programming because i understand a\nlittle bit about ui ux and will help me\nlike talk to people who are doing the ui\nux for the back end stuff that i'm i'm\nbuilding\nother examples are you know a lot of\ntimes like\npeople are like they're almost like bots\nwhen it comes to like being a programmer\nlike a lot of people like the difference\nthat i see between the really good\nprogrammers and like the mediocre\nprogrammers who are still like pretty\nsuccessful is like some of them behave\nlike bots so like i'll work with two\npeople let's say like just random\ncompany google right and one of the\npeople at google is like very proactive\nabout programming they'll like try to\nlearn different things they'll take like\ncertification courses things like that\nand then another person is sort of like\na bot and what they'll do is they'll\nlike go to work and they'll nine to five\nit and then they'll like kind of do\ntheir job they're smart they're talented\nthey you know studied cs at stanford so\nthey're good at it and then they kind of\nlike leave\nand it's not that the other person like\nworks more hours right so this isn't\nlike a capitalist like i'm going to take\nadvantage of of people and try to get\nthem to work more oftentimes actually\nwhat i find is that the people who are\nwho don't behave like bots and are\nactually thoughtful and spend time like\nthinking about the job that they're\ndoing spend time trying to talk to\ndifferent people in the company trying\nto talk to like product developers and\nthings like that um doing different\nkinds of certification courses they're\nactually the ones who become more\nefficient at programming and can work\nfewer hours\nso preparation can be like kind of you\nknow twofold either you can prep like a\nbot or you can actually be like\nthoughtful and stop and think a little\nbit about oh like you know how can i\nbecome a better programmer like what are\nthe different things that i can do to\nprepare the good news is that your\nbosses will tend to love it because you\nwill do better but you're not\nnecessarily doing it for the sake of\nyour bosses you're doing it so that you\ncan become a better programmer that's\nlike a piece of mindset there right\nso the second thing is to adapt so this\nis a good example of actually something\nthat i think that programmers are very\ngood at so this is something where\num\nwe'll still talk about adaptation but i\nthink that\nprogramming is one of the few industries\nthat iteration is like a part of what\nyou formally learn right and and this is\ngoing to be it's kind of weird because\nif you're a programmer like i encourage\nyou to talk to other people in in\nindustries and you'll discover that\nyou're a lot better at iterating than\nthey are so as a programmer you know\nthat when you write code they're going\nto be bugs right like you know that from\nthe get-go so programming is one of the\nfew industries where you write code\nthere are bugs you're gonna have to\nrewrite it you're gonna have to rewrite\nit and you're gonna have to rewrite it\nand this is where for example if you\ncompare it to like budding authors\nbudding authors will write a first draft\nor they'll write three chapters and\nthey'll say\nthis thing that i'm writing does not fit\nthe vision of the epic story that i have\nin my head so screw it and they walk\naway from writing right they go back to\ntheir like programming job and they're\nlike oh screw this\nit's the programmers who understand\niteration and even the authors who\nunderstand iteration that are the\nsuccessful authors\nthere's no such thing as writing a good\nbook the only thing that you can do is\nwrite a crappy book and then it's\nthrough the process of adding editing\nand iteration that you write a good book\nand so programming has iteration already\nbuilt in but this is where when i work\nwith programmers what i'll have them do\nis iterate on things besides code right\nso this is where like you can still\niterate on things like work life balance\nso you know how can you maintain\nwork-life balance\num you know google is another good\nexample of you know they provide meals\nand things like that and like some\npeople that i've worked with at google\nhave like d gen sleep schedules and\ncircadian rhythm problems and like\ngoogle sort of doesn't care right let's\njust like you have to write the code by\nthe time that the deadline is there and\nwhat i really found is that you know\nworking with with um some programmers\nwho like\nare able to iterate on a good schedule\nand healthy work-life balance and the\nfact that like they're not famished at\ntwo in the morning because they started\nwork at 10 p.m\nand then they're like ordering uber eats\nand then they feel like sluggish or\nwhatever and they're eating crap and\nthen they're like exhausted and it's\nlike this cycle of like just like\nunproductive stuff\nand then they end up drinking tons of\nred bull and like hammering it out\ntowards the end and since they're\nbrilliant\nthe code is pretty good and like they\nend up sticking at google\nbut on the flip side they're the people\nwho are who are like really really good\nat iterating even like personal life\nstuff or even iterating communication so\ni've worked uh with some uh you know\nclients that are at some of these\ncompanies where\nyou don't even have a job description\nright so these are some like the open\nwork kind of companies like valve is an\nexample of this kind of company\nwhere like you can kind of work on what\nyou want to work on and you know your\nperformance review is essentially like\nsome kind of like peer review\nand so when you're at i actually don't\nknow if that's precisely what valve does\ni don't know their internal processes\nbut i've worked at i've had clients who\nwork at spaces like that and a lot of\nprogramming is turning into that kind of\nstuff\nand so if you kind of think about you\nknow how you get promoted how you get\nraises it's not just based on the\nquality of your work what you actually\nhave to adapt is like your interpersonal\nskills and social skills because part of\nyour raises and benefits and uh and i\ncould tell stories and stories and\nstories about the internal workings of\nthese companies i've also worked with\nexecutives who are at these kinds of\ncompanies and have this kind of\nphilosophy so unfortunately like getting\na raise at some of these kinds of\ncompanies is like half work product and\na half popularity contest\nand so this is where if you want to\nadapt right there's two kinds of people\nthat i work with one is like oh it's\nunfair because this person is\ncharismatic so they got more of a raise\nthan i did like sucks like i like it's\nunfair\nand then there are the people who are\nlike oh this is a place where i need to\nlearn social skills so let me adapt and\nlike learn how to play this game a\nlittle bit let me learn how to be a\nlittle bit more political\nand then they're the ones whose\nperformance improves\nit's unfortunate that this is the way\nthe world is i wish it was different\nbut unfortunately it's the way it is\nright so now we can i kind of already\nsegued to communication\num but the truth is that if you want to\nperform\nin a programming team or\nyou know\nanything else you need to learn how to\nbe a good communicator so this is also\nwhere like if you think about sprints\nright so like a lot of these agile\nmodels for like programming involve\nsprints where people are get in a room\nand they sort of like sit down and\nthey'll like maybe whiteboard things out\nor things like that but one of the\nbiggest yields i've seen working with\nprogrammers is actually training them in\ncommunication skills because then what\nhappens is like at the end of like the\nfirst sprint meeting or whatever like\neveryone understands like what they're\nsupposed to be doing and when everyone\nis kind of on the same page the\nprogramming goes much more smoothly and\nnot being on the same page involves\nthings like like you know not laying out\nyour argument clear enough not asking\nquestions not asking other people if\nthey understand so communication is a\nhuge part of this\nso i really do think that like\ncommunication is like very important for\nprogrammers and what you'll find is that\nlike you know who ends up being the cto\nthe cto like if we take let's say take\nfive programmers who winds up being cto\nit's not the person who's the best\nprogrammer it's the person who can\ncommunicate\nwith\nthe ceo the coo and the cfo right so\nlike this is really really important if\nyou want to be a successful cto you need\nto practice communication skills because\nthis is what's going to happen your ceo\nis going to come to you and they're\ngoing to say hey we want this feature i\nwant to add a button\nright because they've got this idea and\nthen like because they don't understand\nanything about programming you as a cto\nare going to be like\nokay it'll take us six months because\nyou've already learned to say we can't\ndo that or you've learned that it's\nwrong to say we can't do that well the\ntruth is you can't do that it's requires\nsome weird back-end architect\narchitecture stuff that you have to like\ndo from scratch\nright because the ceo saw some of one of\nyour competitors that has an app that\nadded this feature and they're like oh\nthat's a cool feature like we should\njust add just add the feature yo\nand you're like\nso the there's the worst ceo who says we\ncan't do that\nthen there's like this the second level\nlike one level up from that\nis\nuh the the ct sorry cto who says\num\nokay that'll cost us like six months and\nlike five hundred thousand dollars\nand then the cfo gets pissed at you and\nthey're like we can't afford that like\nyou need to do it with 250 000\nand then the ceo is like you need to do\nit in three months and so then they're\nkind of pissed at you\nand then one level above that is like\nthe cto who can smooth over those things\nand kind of like massage them into like\nhelping you understand okay you do need\na bigger budget here's why things like\nthat and then the highest level of cto\nis the one who when the ceo comes in and\nsays i want to add this button is able\nto say we can't do that and the ceo\nactually respects your opinion and\ndoesn't get pissed at you and listens to\nyou\nso like at the bottom in the top you're\nsaying the same damn thing it's just one\nof you in one situation you actually\nknow how to say that right and these are\nlike this is like when i work with ctos\ni'll teach them the skills that i learn\nas a psychiatrist talking to a suicidal\npatient right and like you can tell\nsomeone who's suicidal hey bro you can't\ndo that it's\nthat may not work it's about how you\nexplain to them how to bring them to\nyour point of view\nthat's really really important\nso communication is vital in programming\nand is like so underdeveloped in the\nfield that it's it's really sad\nand then so the last thing is mindset\nand this is where you know\nthis is where things honestly fall apart\na little bit for me\nbecause i want to say that like\nthe best programmers that i've worked\nwith actually are like have this weird\nkind of mindset\nof like cynicism\nand like a defeatist attitude but\nperseverance\nso there's something i'd say that the\nthe best mindset to have as a programmer\nis like one where you know things are\ngonna be screwed but you're gonna yolo\nit\nright and if you're in programming like\nyou know like it's hard like this is\nwhere i've made observations and i don't\nquite understand it to be honest chat\nbut they're like some programmers who\nare like yeah let's just yolo it and\nsomething about that attitude\nis like it actually leads to like the\nbest products i don't understand it i\nreally don't and this is where you know\ni wish i could say like you could talk\nabout action orientation or outcome\norientation or things like that\nit may have something to do with that\nbut i think that there's there's\nsomething about you know programmers who\nsay this is hard and maybe it's just\nlike it kind of goes back to like what\nwe were saying about uh students but\nthere's some programmers who are saying\nthis is hard and then they and\nwhine and like going into it they have\nsomething like the nocebo effect which\nis when you believe that a medication\nisn't gonna work it somehow doesn't work\nand so it's the opposite of a placebo\nand so there are some programmers who go\nin kind of thinking like hey this is\ngoing to fail it's never going to work\nand so like they're mauling on the\ninside and then maybe molding in real\nlife and they're like grumps and people\ndon't enjoy working with them and\nthey're kind of annoying and then like\nit sort of doesn't work out and then\nthere's another kind of programmer who's\ngot a slightly different mindset which\nis like let's yolo it like this is\ndoomed for failure but let's see what we\ncan do let's try it anyway and not only\ndoes that attitude change\nto change the communication\nbut it also like they just do better\nthis is one of the areas where frankly i\nprobably need to do like a little bit\nmore research but you know i've done a\nlot of mindset work with programmers and\ni don't know\nhow exactly i've done it but it seems to\nwork\nso some of it is is also helping them\nunderstand that you know your success as\na programmer has a lot more to do with\nlike because some of them will be like\nhopeless right you're one of these cogs\nin the wheel the ceo doesn't understand\nwhat's going on the cto is like riding\nyour ass the project manager is an\n and plays favorites they're all\nthese kinds of attitudes that people\nhave when they go to work and like if\nthat's the attitude that you've got when\nyou go to go to work it becomes a\nself-fulfilling prophecy\nif you think that the cto the the\nproject manager is playing favorites\nlike\nthen what happens is like if as long as\nyou hold that attitude in your head when\nyou make a mistake like you're not going\nto think about the mistake you made\nyou're not going to try to get better\nwhen you make a mistake and some product\nmesses up\nyou're going to blame the other guy and\nsay that like oh they're just blaming\nyou it's not because i did anything\nwrong it's because this the project\nmanager is playing favorites and so\nyou're never going to realize like what\nyou're actually doing wrong and you're\nnever going to actually improve and so\nit becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy\nwhere then the project manager starts to\ndislike you\nbecause instead of taking constructive\nfeedback and trying to fix things you\njust mauled on the inside and like go\nafk\nso mindset's very important for\nprogrammers\nquestions\nyou"
