    "transcript": "so this is definitely a case where like\nif y'all are in this situation i would\nhighly highly recommend a mental health\nevaluation all right how do you stop\nbeing racist i'm 18 year old male and\npinoy living in seattle i wasn't racist\nuntil three months ago when i started to\nget a sense of racial hierarchy it's\nbasically all the stereotypes it's some\nkind of internal evil that came forward\nor brainwashing i picked up from the\nmedia i consume i feel like i can't\ntrust people unless they're asian and i\nhave an obsession with asian superiority\ni've spent months binge reading and\nbinge watching youtube channels about\nhow race isn't real and i know it's\nwrong to be racist logically speaking\nbut can't make myself fully believe it\nokay let's pause here already okay\nso we just talked for a second\nabout ego syntonic and ego dystonic okay\nso as a reminder ego syntonic thoughts\nare thoughts that like enter your mind\nand align with who you are and ego\ndystonic thoughts are ones that enter\nyour mind and like don't align with who\nyou are\nso if we think about someone and\nremember they're not necessarily good or\nbad right so you can have good ego\nsyntonic thoughts or you can have bad\nego syntonic thoughts\nso people who are like actually racist\ngenerally speaking will have racist\nthoughts that are ego syntonic so\nthey'll say to people like oh you know\nlike these immigrants should leave my\ncountry immigrants are bad they're nasty\nwhatever they're lazy like whatever so\nlike someone is happy to have those\nthoughts they think those thoughts are\ncorrect they love to share them with the\nworld they think that they like kind of\nalign with things right so what we're\nseeing here are ego dystonic racist\nthoughts\nso this person like recognizes they have\nthese thoughts and they're like trying\nto brainwash themselves something\nhappened three months ago where they\nkind of like you know\nstarted having like these racist\nthoughts and now they're trying to like\nbrainwash themselves in the opposite\ndirection so that's very ego-dystonic\nokay so this like it's sort of like i\nrecognize these thoughts are wrong so\nlet me try to fix them so if you're\ntrying you know if you don't like the\nthoughts that you're having they're ego\ndystonic so let's keep going\nokay\nso\ni've spent um\ni start to doubt content creators and\nget suspicious about their intentions if\nthey aren't asian i get so uncomfortable\nthat i have to watch something else at\nthe same time while i just listen if i\ncare about their opinion\ni like i like the more\ni feel like the more i try to\ndesensitize myself to non-asian people\nthe more uncomfortable i get right so\nthis is where do you guys see like the\nego ego destonicness here there's like\nthey're trying to fix it\nbut the more they expose themselves to\nnon-asian people the more uncomfortable\nthey get\num\nso i'm going to go ahead\nuh\nso there's some stuff here about like\ni'm worried that i'll become violent\nlose control and commit hate crimes\num\ni'm afraid to go outdoors because i\nmight snap i was going to go to college\nand get a job but i cancelled it all and\ndid nothing\nwith my life because i didn't feel well\nso we're gonna go ahead and pause here\nfor a second too\nso this is definitely a case where like\nif y'all are in this situation i would\nhighly highly recommend a mental health\nevaluation\nso here's the key thing to remember\nmental health evaluations are not\nnecessarily about\nwhether you're ill or not ill i know\nthat sounds kind of weird because we're\ntalking about mental health evaluations\nright so i think the main thing to\nremember is that if whatever is going on\nis impairing your function and\npreventing you from living the life that\nyou want you should go get evaluated by\na mental health professional so this is\na case of an 18 year old person who was\ngonna go to college and now isn't going\nto college that's the kind of thing that\nwe call in the field of psychiatry\nimpairment of function\nso this isn't it's not an issue of like\nwhether you actually have a\nneurochemical imbalance or not that's\nnot really kind of like what we're\ntalking about here\nit could be it couldn't be but my point\nis that if your life is is so severely\nimpacted by this stuff whether you have\na real diagnosis or don't have a real\ndiagnosis that's irrelevant like the\nmain thing is that you want to live a\nparticular life and something is going\non inside your mind that is preventing\nyou from reading\nfrom living this life\nso if y'all meet that kind of criteria\nyou should definitely go and see a\nmental health professional does that\nmake sense\nso it's it's really about impairment to\nfunction because this is i want you all\nto think about mental health\nprofessionals is like they're not just\nabout treating the sick okay\nmental health professionals are a\nresource for you to utilize\nto build the life that you want that's\nwhy we're here we're a tool in your\ntoolbox right it's kind of like happy\nhour run around with like debuffs at\nhalf hp and you keep on wiping when you\nzone in it's like this person trying to\nzone into college and they've got like\n20 hp and like i'll have all these\nstacking concentration debuffs minus 50\nto concentration mana pool is cut in\nhalf and you're zoning in and you're\nwiping\nso if that's the case like if you all\nare zoning in and wiping and you're not\nable to like live the life that you want\nto live go get evaluated by a mental\nhealth professional\nyou"
