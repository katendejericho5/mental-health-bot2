    "transcript": "so why feeling oh i love this why\nfeeling self-pity feels good so after\ntwo years of therapy i managed to\nimprove and get rid of anxiety and\ndepression and life is amazing like look\nat that there we go so stay in therapy\nkids\none of the things that i learn and that\nstill puzzle me is to stop self-pity\neven though in short term it feels good\nsometimes i just feel in my brain that i\nwant to feel miserable this happens way\nless often now and thinking that i'm\nmiserable feels good saying to myself\nthat i'm unlovable feels good now when i\nfeel this i\nuse effort to fight this feeling either\nby ignoring it or finding counter\nevidence of why i'm level lovable and\nnot worth the pity and why when i do\nthis it hurts but makes my makes but\nlong-term makes my life great why does\nthis happen it doesn't make any sense\nalso when indulging in this\nself-pityness that feels good to imagine\nothers feeling sorry for myself but it\nonly feels good as long as it's not real\nthis is so good\nokay so first of all huge props so to\nthis poster because of the\nspecificity of like what they're\ndiscovering right\nif i imagine other people feeling sorry\nfor myself it feels good but if people\nactually feel sorry for me it feels bad\nlike what's up with that\nwhy does the fantasy not mirror up to\nthe reality\nthinking i'm miserable feels good\nbut saying to myself that i'm unlovable\nalso feels good\nand sometimes i fight it but when i\nfight it\nit hurts\nlike what's up with that okay\nthere's a lot of really good stuff here\nso let's start at the top\nthe first thing is that our brain is not\ndesigned to\nfeel good it's designed to like\nunderstand things and like put things in\norder okay so what i mean by that is\nthat like the brain seeks to bring\norder from chaos it's all about like\ngenerating patterns so that we can\nunderstand and make sense of the world\nthe brain would rather generate a bad\npattern that makes us feel bad rather\nthan have chaos and confusion okay this\nis a really important thing to\nunderstand\nso if you look at people who get into\nabusive relationships over and over and\nover again like why on earth do they do\nthis okay it's really it's an\ninteresting question is really\nfascinating once you understand it\nso\nin the mind of someone who\nhas been in abusive relationships they\nhave low value okay so like i'm a bad\nperson i deserve to be treated like crap\nright so we just saw a post about a\nbunch of shame so i'm like really\nashamed of myself like i suck at life\ni'm a pos\nso then what happens is they like date\ntwo people so one person treats them\nlike a pos and somehow like they wind up\nwith that person so like what's up with\nthat like how does that happen and it's\nbecause the world is congruent right so\nthe way that i feel about myself\nother people are treating me the way\nthat i i should they should treat me\nbecause it's the way that i feel about\nmyself so the world makes sense things\nare very orderly let's stick with that\nit's the same reason that like people\nwho are like you know super narcissistic\nwill surround themselves by like\nyes men or like other people who will\nsupport their narcissism i'm the best\nthing since sliced bread so i'm gonna\nengage in relationships who help me feel\nabout myself the way that i feel okay so\nactually it's slightly different\nnarcissism because\nyou're looking at people to assuage your\ninternal insecurity but let's not go\nthere for now the key thing is that\nhuman beings will prefer\norder\nor a pattern that makes sense to a good\npattern\nand even if you look at people in\nabusive relation who have a history of\nabusive relationships or history of\ntrauma if they enter into a healthy\nrelationship\nif you actually talk to them they don't\nsay oh wow this person is treating me\nlike amazing like this feels great i\nnever realized how much self self-worth\ni have i never realized what i was worth\nthat's not actually their experience\ntheir experience is terrifying and\nconfusing they're like what on earth is\ngoing on like i was sick\nand this person like took care of me\nlike what are they what am i missing\nbecause like i'm not worth taking care\nof like or is this a scam of some way\nlike i'm waiting for the other\nshoe to drop like what's going on like\nwhat is this person what's happening\nhere i'm confused i don't like it it\nmakes me uncomfortable i dislike it\nand because then if i don't care about\nmyself and someone else starts caring\nabout me like how does that make me feel\nit actually is very discongruent and\nlike i don't like it\nright it's like something's missing it\ndoesn't i'm not used to this\nwe pick we prefer as human beings what\nwe're used to over things that are good\nright and this is explains like half of\nour problems is that we prefer the\nfamiliar to the good\nso what happens in the mind of this\nperson is like if we look at the abusive\nperson is when they when they you know\ndate someone who's like abusive that's\ntotally fine like it makes sense even\nthough it hurts emotionally like at\nleast it makes sense and i know i've\nsurvived this it's totally fine it's far\nmore terrifying to actually date someone\nwho treats you with like respect because\nthen you're like what do i what do i do\nabout this i'm so confused like i don't\nknow how to behave in this relationship\nit's bewildering and it's scary\nbecause here's the really scary thing\nthat then happens\nis there's a part of them that over time\nstarts to believe and they're like oh my\ngod\nis it possible that i'm worth something\nand then\ncomes the test\nbecause\nif there's a possibility that i'm worth\nsomething and i continue in this\nrelationship\nand it turns out and then the other shoe\ndoes drop it was a scam if i let myself\nhope and this person turns out to be an\nabusive just like everyone else\nthen i hoped and my hopes are completely\nshattered\nso something really bizarre happens is\npeople start to hope they actually as\nthey start to be convinced that maybe\nthey're wrong they actually pull away\nfrom the relationship because the idea\nthat you could be wrong is like so scary\nand devastating you never want to put it\nto the test it's really terrifying\nand then if if that shoe drops then\nyou're defeated for the rest of your\nlife because you you thought for a\nmoment that you had value and boy did\nthey prove you wrong okay\nso the first thing to understand is that\nthe mind prefers the familiar\nover the good okay and we like we like\nseek things that are congruent with the\nway that we feel about ourselves so\nenter this now our case of like someone\nwho feels self-pity and is kind of like\ndoing well in life right\nso i want you to understand there's like\nan echo left over of the self-pity so\ntwo years ago before you went into\ntherapy\nyou pitied yourself right because you\nwere like oh so sad so sad bro like oh\nmy god or girl like so sad\nand so like you recognize that you\ndeserve pity and and so like you learned\nhow to like comfort yourself right and\nthat's like a thing that has lingered\nthat you learned how to comfort yourself\nyou learned how to tell yourself hey\nlike oh my god it's so sad like you\ndeserve so much pity like oh like you\ncan't you're not really capable of\nanything because that that was a that\nwas a solution for you right it was a\nway that you dealt with some of your\nproblems and as we get healthy we no\nlonger need that solution but it still\narises from time to time right like so\nthe brain doesn't forget everything all\nat once like if i haven't spoken a\nlanguage in a decade i still remember a\nfew words i still sometimes think about\nit from time to time that's just how our\nbrain works\nand so the first thing to understand is\nthat you know it's an echo like it's\nokay\nlike\nthat you feel self-pity and it's also\nokay for you to indulge in it from time\nto time\nbecause it kind of feels good right it\nfeels congruent that's why it feels good\nby the way it's not healthy but it feels\ncongruent\nso here's what i'd recommend if you're\nkind of in this situation now is don't\nalways push it away\nright like notice what it is and notice\nthat it was your friend for a while and\nit helped you for a while and it helped\nyou survive some dark times and so it's\ncoming to visit from time to time you\ndon't really need its help anymore\nyou know like\nyou know your life is pretty good\num but that it's still allowed to come\nthere from time to time you don't always\nhave to push it away you don't always\nhave to tell yourself that\nyou don't always have to shout it down\nso this is what i'd say in terms of like\ninternal self-dialogue the next time you\nfeel like pitting yourself and you say\nto yourself i don't deserve the pity\nthat is very devaluing or invalidating\ntowards that feeling right like if if\nsomeone is feeling self\npity and i tell them hey screw you you\ndon't deserve to pity yourself look at\neverything that you've got you you're\nsuch a whiny little stop doing\nthat\nthat's like not gonna make the person\nfeel good right it's incredibly\ninvalidating which is what you're doing\nyourself which is why it feels bad\nso instead what you need to do is like\nnotice it and say like hey like i\nunderstand that you know there's a part\nof me that feels self-pity like i've i\ncarried that pity around for a long time\nit's an old friend\nand it's coming to visit and that's okay\ni i've grown a lot i don't actually\nbelieve that i need that much pity\nbut i certainly needed a lot of pity a\ncouple of years ago and so like it's\nfine for me to feel this way like it's\nokay for me to feel this way and i'll\nprobably continue to feel this way from\ntime to time and that's okay like\nyou know because\nthere was a period of my life where it\nseemed like i needed\na lot of compassion and pity i was\nhungry for it and i didn't get it from\nother people which is the other thing\nyou can kind of explore\nand so if you were hungry for that\ncompassion from some time ago and like\nnow you're clearly not going to get that\ncompassion because your life is better\ngood job by the way\nthen that hunger will be left over right\nit's like that desire will will be left\nunfulfilled and so it's coming back and\nit's giving you an opportunity to like\nfill it so go ahead and fill it and fill\nit with awareness don't dive too far\ninto self-pity but by all means like be\ncompassionate towards it and like\nindulge in it a little bit and and\nrecognize that okay is today a day that\ni'm going to indulge don't indulge in it\nevery day right so you don't want to\nkind of slide back but it's okay for it\nto be there because you haven't had a\nneed that left was met unmet\ni mean it was not met and if you have an\nunmet need it's going to linger with you\nand it's just kind of psychologically\npopping up like hey remember me we used\nto be good friends and so let it be\nthere treat it with compassion it'll\nmelt away over time don't worry about it"
