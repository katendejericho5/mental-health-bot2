    "transcript": "so what you're saying is that we need a\nhealthy gamer only fans\nno\nno what I'm saying at all all right\nmaybe one day\nI was thinking about the inundation of\nporn and graphic sexual content in\ntoday's culture I was wondering what\nwould be Dr K's thoughts on how this is\naffecting the human mind and mental\nhealth\nI feel that genuine human intimacy is\ngoing down in this day and age but it\ncould just be me sexuality is something\nso common and frequent to humans\nnaturally however\nthat it just seems natural that in the\ninternet age it would be everywhere\nhowever I feel that as I said this is\naffecting human intimacy and it at least\nin my eyes seems to be making sexuality\nand sexual experiences not as special or\nexciting as they should be just some\nthoughts in the community would love to\nhear people's ideas\nokay let me think about this oh man so I\nthink this is such a complicated\nquestion like so the simplest questions\nactually have the most complicated\nanswers because it depends on what level\nyou want to talk about okay so if we\nwant to try to understand the inundation\nof porn and sexuality and like sexually\nexplicit not even sexually explicit it's\nactually implicit\nthings on the internet right so if you\nlook at things like the hot tub meta on\nTwitch that's not sexually explicit but\nsexually implicit so we are absolutely\nbeing inundated and bombarded with\nsexual stimuli and so the question is\nwhat does that do to us\nand the short answer is like no one\nreally knows but I suspected it ain't\ngreat\nso here's what we do know\nif we look at content on the internet\nwhat I have come to realize is that like\nthe content that does well is the stuff\nthat from an evolutionary or sort of\ntakes advantage of like the evolution of\nour brains\nso our brains have evolved to be\nattracted to particular things\nand though that attraction in our brain\nled to survival benefits so a good\nexample of this is like we're attracted\nto high calorie density food so we're\nattracted to food that is like you know\nsugary fatty delicious right we call it\ndelicious like food that is like low\ncalorie is not usually considered\ndelicious\nand so then what happens is we've our\nbrain is our body has evolved to have a\npreference for this one thing because it\nused to be a survival advantage\nand then we started making like you know\ntwinkies and then suddenly people are\nnow dying of diabetes\nbecause their body has evolved to tell\nthem to like eat this unhealthy food\nand what we have is we have industries\nthat have adapted to this evolutionary\npreference like fast food right so like\nwe have calorie dense Pizza all this\nkind of stuff I had pizza last night it\nwas delicious I hadn't had pizza in a\nwhile\nand I ate like a thousand calories and\nlike our so we have entire industries\nthat have adapted to meet this need\nand then what happens is like the\nindustry is just sort of like we're just\nmaking the pizza like we're not you know\npeople can choose to eat it or not eat\nit it's like we're just making pizza\nright and so there's like personal\nfreedom arguments and all that kind of\nstuff but I think Industries are\nadapting to\nfit the existing architecture of our\nbrains\nand I think this is essentially\nhappening with the internet dopamine and\nlike sexuality\nso you know the last big revolution that\nwas predatory on the way that our brains\nand bodies have evolved may have been\nlike the food industry and now what\nwe've got is this whole cognitive\nlike technology like predatory kind of\nstuff I don't think they're oh I mean\nsome of them are trying to be predatory\nsome of them aren't trying to be\npredatory right so if like you're a game\ndesigner some of them are like you know\nsitting there like as CFO and trying to\nthink like how can we extract more how\ncan we like extract more juice from this\nsweet sweet pudgy gamer\nand then like some people are like you\nknow how can I make the game that I want\nto play how can I make a game that's\nmore fun than anything I've ever played\nbefore\nand and so both of those things will end\nup with with arguably like things that\nwill be predatory on our on our\ncircuitry and so I think we're seeing\nthis in sexuality as well where like\ncontent people are sort of figuring out\nlike you know Instagram is a good\nexample right so like everyone is like\nediting Instagram photos and I saw that\nthere was recently legislation in Norway\nwhere you have to like let people know\nthat your Instagram is edited\nand so like what everyone is doing is\nthey're like gravitating towards Like\nThese people aren't really sure they\ndon't they're not neuroscientists but if\nI look if I'm an Instagram model I'm\ngonna real like I'm gonna figure out\nfrom a darwinian sense right I'm gonna\ntry this post and it's not gonna work\nI'm gonna try this post it is gonna work\noh what did I do there oh I was wearing\nsomething skimpier okay now I'm gonna\ntry skimpy but this is too skimpy and\nnow people think that I'm kind of like\nyou know ho-ish so like people didn't\nlike that as much so I need to be like\njust hoist enough\nright so that's sort of like the idea\nbehind like and they figured this out\nthey figure out like how the brain is\nwired and what leads to the most kind of\nlike pull\nso some of the impacts that we're seeing\nare you know we're seeing things like\npornography addiction so we're seeing\nthat for example the more likely you are\nto get addicted to pornography like\ndepends on how early you were exposed to\npornography and also the intensity of\nthe pornography that you were exposed to\nso we are seeing real like psych like\npsychiatric consequences we're also\nseeing as this person suggests like some\nconfusion around intimacy and\nexpectations so a lot of people who you\nknow grow up watching porn will have\nparticular expectations of what the\nappropriate response is\nso I one time had a patient who told me\nthat they were unable to have an orgasm\nwhen they masturbate\nand as I talked to them I realized like\nactually when they masturbate they are\nhaving an orgasm it's just in the\npornography there's like so they used to\nsay that I get I can get to the first\npart of orgasm I was like what do you\nmean the first part of orgasm and\nthey're like well I get a little of I\nget like a small amount of ejaculate but\nI don't get to the full ejaculate I was\nlike what do you mean the full ejaculate\nand then I realized that like when you\nwatch pornography there's such a copious\namount of ejaculate that like this\nperson had what I assumed to be like a\nnormal ejaculation I still remember I\nlooked up what is the\nI still remember like after an\nappointment I looked up what is the\naverage amount of human what is the\nmedian amount of human ejaculate in\nmilliliters\nand so pornography had given this this\nidea that like orgasm is this like just\nexplosion of like buckets of ejaculation\nand they just didn't understand that\nright so like they would actually\nmasturbate and they like they thought\nthey were like busted in some way so\nlike you know the the impacts of\npornography is their pornography\naddiction absolutely is it affecting\nwith intimacy like I think so and then\nthere are all these other like\nunexpected outcomes\nthat we just don't We're Not Gonna know\nright like you can't predict that if\npeople watch a lot of pornography like\nteenagers are gonna get confused about\nwhen they have an orgasm that's not like\nyou just can't make that prediction but\nit's it's an effect\nand so you know what effect is it having\nthe short answer is like we sort of\ndon't know so we're certainly seeing\nsome of these things like you know death\ngrip syndrome and some of these other\nthings where our brain is like wiring to\nexpect a certain kind of stimulus and\nthen it takes some time for us to like\nrewire to like regular stimuli\nand so you know there are a couple of\nthings like this but the short answer is\nlike is it affecting us absolutely and\nthe reason that we don't know is because\npornography and sexually sexual sexually\nexplicit and implicit material is\nevolving so quickly that we can't even\nstudy it like we can't study it fast\nenough so if you think about you know\nfive years ago like only fans didn't\nexist\nbut at least I don't think so\nmaybe it did but now what's happening is\nlike I'm sure that only fans the\nparasocial element of only fans is going\nto create intimacy issues in real\nrelationships because it for you know\nfor a long time Partners have always\nbeen concerned about what was I saying\noh yeah only fans\nso you know partners for a long time\nhave been concerned that like oh if my\npartner watches pornography like it\nfeels like they're cheating right like\nPartners have all like been concerned\nabout you know watching pornography and\nlike you know\nwhatever and then like I think that\nthere's an emotional component there's a\nparasocial component on only fans which\nis is going to exacerbate\nthose kinds of feelings and the people\nwho are like are vulnerable to them\nright so like it's completely possible\nthat you know their majority of the\npopulation or maybe the minor I have no\nidea will be totally fine with you know\nsomeone donating 100 or or purchasing I\nguess you know a hundred or a thousand\ndollars of content a month on only fans\nlike some Partners may be like\ncomfortable with that right because\npolyamory is also growing like open\nrelationships are growing like there's\nthe everything's changing so that could\nbe fine\nbut at the same time I think that like\nthe reason that only fans is successful\nis because\npornography has evolved and what people\nhave figured out is that like\nthere's an element of pornography that's\npurely physical and it started off with\na magazine right there's like zero\ninteraction and then like how much will\nit prey on our brain if I get like\ninteraction with that woman I can lust\nfor a particular I'm just sort of think\nabout the heteronormative here in a\nmasculine perspective but you know if I\nif I'm a man and I'm lusting for a woman\nlike looking at a Playboy magazine like\nthat's fine but then suddenly like I'm\nable to interact with the woman I'm able\nto get the woman's attention like I'm\nable to like have more contact with her\nwe just saw from a post earlier today\nthat like you know people can get\naddicted to Twitch and stuff because\nthese parasocial interactions so there's\nlike the sh like you know what effect is\nit having honestly as a scientist the\nright answer is I don't know and no one\ndoes\nand at the same time we are clearly\nseeing signs of something is changing in\nour brains in the way that we interact\nwith each other\nnow I'm not going to be quite as\ndoomsday as many people will everyone's\nlike oh my God the world is coming to\nthe end like like only fans will be the\nthe death of all relationships and I'm\nsure that someone out there believes\nthat but I also think that you know the\nreason we stream on Twitch is because we\ncan sort of Fight Fire with Fire right\nso like we can\num we can people can become addicted to\nTwitch and people can hopefully watch\nTwitch which I know sounds kind of weird\nto like help themselves not become\naddicted to Twitch it's bizarre but I\nthink that we can probably like we can\nteach people how to have healthier\nconversations and relationships I've\ndone that before\num in terms of like you know pornography\nand and only fans and stuff like that\nlike how can you communicate with your\npartner because that kind of\ncommunication education like hasn't been\navailable for most of the history of\nhumanity so it's possible that we can\njust build healthy relationships despite\nall this stuff by just learning more\nabout ourselves\nso what you're saying is that we need a\nhealthy gamer only fans\nno\nthat's not what I'm saying at all\noh\n[Music]\nmy God all right maybe one day\nI'm happy on Twitch chat\nokay\nall right and so this is where like is\nis this the same person that was asking\nis this why Magneto is never depressed\njust to be clear the world is changing\nwe don't know how it's changing\nis it causing problems probably and or\nyes and I don't think that that means\nthat the world should stop changing\nright so like the whole\ngoal of humanity is that new challenges\narise and like as the human race like we\nhave to figure out\nhow to like unscrew ourselves from all\nthe screwing over we've done so like you\nknow the Industrial Revolution happened\nand we started like using fossil fuels a\nton and now there's like concerns around\nclimate change so we gotta like fix that\nright so they're like\nreforestation projects and like you know\nall kinds of things that that is the\nhuman race hopefully will you know start\ndoing\nand so that there's happening there's a\ncognitive Revolution as well there's\nlike a cognitive change there's like\nlike you know we're doing a lot of\nthings that cognitively offer short-term\nbenefits and there's almost like a\ncognitive climate change happening right\nnow with the human race and I think the\nreason that we we're seeing so much more\nmental illness and why mental illness is\ngetting worse and suicide is getting a\nlittle bit worse if not significantly\nworse depression is increasing anxiety\nis increasing I think it's a sign of\nthis cognitive climate change so is\npornography have something to do with\nthat sure as only fans have something to\ndo with that sure is YouTube has\nsomething to do with that sure switch\nhave something to do with that sure\nand are these things evil do we want to\nstop advancing as a human race and like\nstop advancing technology just because\nit has some downsides I personally don't\nthink so I think this is where like we\ncan learn about ourselves and we can\nmanage it\nI love video games yeah so when when VR\ndevelops haptic feedback that is going\nto eliminate the human race I gave a\ntalk about this at a\nvideo game developer conference a few\nyears ago\nthat my biggest concern about the\npornography industry is when you can\nhave haptic feedback with VR\nand like then like literally people may\nstop having children and then like you\nincorporate things like Ai and stuff\nlike and you have like a fully virtual\ngirlfriend that will throw temper\ntantrums\nand frustrate you\nand then yeah AI waifu with haptic\nfeedback then it's like GG dude\nso you know there's this idea right now\nthat like people who are into waifus are\nlike less than human\nyou know people will mock them a lot and\nwill denigrate them a lot and things\nlike that\nbut I think as technology improves like\njust like gaming has become we used to\ndo that with the gamers remember that\nchat you remember when Gamers used to be\nthe minority\nand before everyone was doing it and\nthen his games got better everyone\nstarted doing it\nthe waifu revolution is coming chat\nprepare yourselves"
