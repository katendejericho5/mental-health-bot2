    "transcript": "dr k\nhow to manage trust issues with porn\naddiction so i'm in a distance\nrelationship\ni found out that my boyfriend watches\nporn before we started to be together he\nused to watch it very often then he\npromised to stop but i found out it was\na lie he was telling me that the problem\nwas solved that he doesn't do it anymore\nyet after a few months then after\nanother year i found out he kept lying\nto me i wanted to break up but he\nmanaged to convince me to stay and he\npromised again that he won't do it\nanymore\nit was very hard for me for a long time\nand we've been together for a few years\nnow but the trust has never come back\ntruly and other issues have come along\ni watched dr k's video about porn\naddiction on the youtube channel it did\ngive me some more information about how\nthe addiction goes and so on dr k was\nvery understanding towards the problem\nand brought some help to brave guys that\ndecided to come on stream\ndr k could you bring some help for\ngirlfriends of addicts i believe there\nis many girls and that that are with\ngamers or even not gamers but just\nregular guys that have the same problem\nthings that i struggle with except for\nthe trust are low self-esteem feeling\nnot enough feeling not desired feeling\nnot comfy and shy when being naked\nobsessed with worries during intimate\nmoments\nas if he thinks of porn scenes\nfeeling very bad during any sex scene\nwhen we watch movies at some point i\nunderstand that the problem isn't about\nme that it's about him but still it\nbrings all of the above will it ever go\naway what do i do to make it go away\nthe situation between us is is that we\ndon't talk about it anymore i used to\ntry but he was very ashamed many times\nhe was just nodding and agreeing to my\npoint of view but he wasn't really open\nto talk to himself\nit happened only when i started the talk\nand also the conversations about it were\nmostly bringing more pain and sadness i\nwish to get better i wish to help for\nmyself i wished to be help for myself\nand him and i just don't know what to do\nthis is a fantastic post and\nunfortunately a very common problem\nso let's try to recap okay\nso\nsometimes\npeople watch pornography\nsometimes they watch a lot of\npornography\nthen they enter into relationships and\nthe pornography becomes kind of an issue\nso it's a little bit unclear how we get\nhere but at some point people who will\nbe addicted to pornography will promise\ntheir partner that they don't watch porn\nand then eventually they'll\nfail to keep that promise and then time\nwill go by they'll promise again fail to\nkeep the second one so on and so forth\nright so like\nthis creates\na lot of problems in the relationship it\ndamages trust it makes it hard for\npeople to communicate this is a really\nclassic situation\nwhen someone watches pornography in a\nrelationship it can make the partner\nfeel very insecure and insufficient\nbecause there they are having their\nsexual gratification\nlooking at a particular kind of beauty\naesthetic and my body doesn't match that\nright so like\nis my partner truly attracted to me or\nam i just like the best that they can\nget like do they really want to be with\nsomeone like who's in the porno\nor do they want to be with me are they\njust settling with me like creates all\nthese issues which are really common so\nhow do we approach this\nthe first thing to understand\nis that\npeople make promises of abstinence\nout of fears and wants\nnot what they're capable of okay\nso what do i\nhold on a second\nwhere's my father\nokay sorry\nso the first thing to understand is that\nwhen people make promises of abstinence\nin a relationship with porn addiction\nthey do so out of fear of the\nconsequences and like what they want\nright\nso i'm gonna be brave and i'm gonna\npromise you something because i care\nabout you and i'm afraid of what's going\nto happen if i don't promise it right\nbut when we think about dealing with an\naddiction\nkeeping your promise is not like a good\nway to fuel motivation it's an\ninsufficient motivation to deal with an\naddiction just my general experience as\nan addiction psychiatrist\nso if i swear to you that i'm never\ngoing to drink again that doesn't\nactually lead to me not drinking so if\nwe think about\npromises promises are emotionally driven\nright they're like i'm in this moment\ni'm so like oh my god i'm so bad i hurt\nyou i'm so mad i hurt you i don't want\nto ever hurt you again i swear that's an\nemotional emotionally driven decision\nwhen you have an emotionally driven\ndecision the motivation behind it is\ngonna wane as your emotions equilibrate\nwhich is normal okay so the human brain\nis designed to always return emotions to\nbaseline this is why despite having the\nmost awesome win in league of legends\nsix months ago you were still not happy\ntoday the happiness just doesn't last\nthe sadness just doesn't last the\nemotions just don't last it's the way\nthat our brain is desired uh designed\nso as the\npromise\nso we have an emotion we make a promise\nas the emotion wanes the promise is\nprone to fall apart so the first thing\nto understand is don't make promises\nthat are driven by like emotions in\nrelationships around porn addiction okay\nthe second thing is communication is key\nso this is where what i would recommend\nto girlfriends of partners who are\nwatching porn is that you ask them\nquestions about why they watch it you\nneed to understand what their\nmotivations behind the pornography is\nbecause this in turn can help a lot of\nyour insecurities you may discover all\nkinds of things like oh like i wouldn't\nwatch porn if we were able to be\nsexually active but i just have sexual\nneeds and i'd much prefer you but we're\nin a long-distance relationship so i\njust like use it to get some degree of\nsexual release it's sort of like more of\na physiologic thing or a mechanical\nthing as opposed to like i don't find\nyou attractive or other things like that\nright so there are all kinds of reasons\nthat people will watch porn\nespecially if you look at people who are\naddicted to pornography a lot of the\nreason that they watch porn has nothing\nto do with sexuality or desire it has\neverything to do with internal emotional\nregulation coping with negative emotions\nthat's why people watch porn that's why\npeople get addicted to porn right if i'm\nhaving a bad day and i watch porn and i\njerk off then what happens is i feel\nbetter and like that pain from earlier\nin the day like that emotional pain goes\naway i get that hit of dopamine i get\nthat rush from ejaculation and then i\nkind of feel better\nso in terms of like the insecurities\nthat your partner may have like once\nthey understand why you watch porn\nhopefully some of those insecurities\nwill be dealt with\nand the third thing to do is to have a\nconversation about the insecurities\nright so i think communication here is\nkey non-judgmental communication is key\nand for you to share with your partner\nhey i feel insecure about like being\nnaked i feel embarrassed especially\nbecause you watch porn because my body\ndoes not look like the people's bodies\nin porn\nand so when you share that with your\nyour partner what they're gonna do is\nthey'll say oh they're gonna feel hurt\nthey're like oh my god i can't believe\ni'm hurting you like no i love you so\nmuch i swear i'll never watch porn\nthat's a mistake don't do that okay\ndon't change your behavior don't make\nany behavioral changes at the beginning\njust have a conversation where you're\nlistening because at that point the\npartner isn't even listening they're\ntrying to fix it right they're not even\nhearing you anymore they're trying to\nmake it go away\nand if you're trying to make things go\naway that's what's going to result in\nthe promise that's what's going to\nresult in making a promise that you\ncan't keep and is going to decay the\ntrust so it starts with a conversation\nit starts with very practically can you\nhelp me understand\nwhat you like about watching porn can\nyou help me understand\nwhy you watch porn what does it do for\nyou\nare you concerned about your porn use\nare you not are you okay with it if i\nwas okay with it would you be okay with\nit\nyou know here are my concerns about your\npornography use\nhere are my insecurities in the\nrelationship\nlet's talk about those so i think that\nif you're thinking about rebuilding\ntrust it has to do with like\npeople not reassuring each other it has\nto do with people not jumping into\nconclusions because the next time he\npromises you don't know what to believe\nbecause you don't know what's in his\nhead he's not you don't know what's in\nhis head you just know that what's\ncoming out of his mouth right and you\nknow some of his behaviors that's not\nhow you build trust building trust is\nabout understanding where the other\nperson is\nbuilding trust is about recognizing what\nis in the other person's head and\naccepting what is in the other person's\nhead even if we decide we want to change\nit you have to start by accepting it\nokay i understand that you're addicted\nto pornography i understand that you\ndon't want to be addicted to pornography\ni understand that you do find a sexual\nrelationship with me to be gratifying\nand that this is going to take time and\nthat we should work on it i don't want\nyou to promise i'm just curious where do\nyou think you can start\ndo you think it's is it like a cutting\nback kind of thing like what what's a\nreasonable place to start don't go\nstraight for the the 100\nlike what's the first step we need to\ntake not where we want to go forget\nabout the goal where can we start\nso it it involves having a conversation\nabout understanding why they you use\nporn like what does it do for them\nsharing your insecurities understanding\ntheir insecurities not jumping to\nsolutions not jumping to conclusions and\nhaving conversations and then the two of\ny'all together coming up with like what\ncan we agree on you know what's the\nfoundation that both of us are going to\nbe operating from and that's how you\nrebuild trust and it's also how you\novercome negative behaviors in\nrelationships"
