    "transcript": "let's go chat chat ours\nso today lots of fun so we're gonna do\num we're gonna\ngive you guys an insight into uh\nour coaching program so we we have one\nof our awesome coaches today\nwho is going to be coaching dr k and so\ni'm going to be the client and he's\ngoing to be the coach\nwhat uh do we want to vote on a coaching\nscenario\nor are we going to wing it\nyeah vote gaming addiction\n[Music]\nyou guys tell me what do you all want me\nto play\nokay so let's uh oh no\ni've blocked him so chat meet pax\npax can you just um is that okay if i\nask you a couple of questions about your\nexperience as a coach\nat healthy gamer before we dive in hell\nyeah so why don't you tell us like how\nyou\nhow you came to be a coach to start off\nwith think about it karmically it's a\nlong\nlong story but i basically heard about\nhealthy gamer\nthrough uh bobby scar and then\nfrom there i was like oh this seems cool\nuh\nand then i saw you guys were like\nlooking for coaches i was like i\nmaybe i can do that uh and so i just\napplied for it uh\nlike last like almost a year ago now\nthis you should be familiar with right\nso you remember our coach role playing\nfrom\nfrom training and how terrible it was to\nhave you as a client\nyes well i was actually trying to\nremember that i was like i don't know if\ni ever did it with dr k\nbecause i think i remember doing that\nwith other coaches okay\nand i was like curious i was like i\nwonder what dr k's version\nof like a challenging client is because\nthat's my assumption of what we're going\nto be working on\nokay um so yeah so we've got i'm going\nto give you a choice pax\nyou can tell us a little bit about like\nyou know what clients you see commonly\nand what kinds of problems they have\nand then we can kind of pick one of\nthose or\num you know or maybe you can just share\na little bit about that and then like\ntwitch chat has given me some\nsuggestions\nwe could you could you could give\nyourself over to the webs\ntwitch chat if you want to or why don't\nyou tell us like a little bit about what\nyou usually see\ni guess what what i experience as coach\nwhat i see a lot\nis um i see people who\nyou know they're almost they always\nalways are like i just want to get\nunstuck it's like what is that you know\nwhat is unstuck\nright um and very commonly they know\nwhat they should be doing uh but\nthey can't bring themselves to do that\nstuff so then they're like well now what\nand then we talk about that and kind of\ngo from there we end up getting into\ntheir past and\num you know that tends to be helpful for\nreasons i'm sure\neveryone hopefully everyone here\nunderstands um\nbut i'd say that's like the biggest\nbiggest trend is like\nlike i know what to do but i don't do it\nwhat's happening am i broken\nlike yeah great perfect okay so we're\ngonna we'll do that then\nso let's let's um i'm gonna be a\nparticular flavor of unstuck\ni'm going to combine have you been\nwatching the stream did you see what\nchat wanted\nhell no i've okay yes yeah perfect\nokay so um let's let's get started\nuh hello alok it's all okay\nyeah okay cool yeah so i'm paxton\nwelcome to coaching\nuh or pax whichever doesn't matter no\ni'm just gonna talk about some boring\n[ __ ] for like a few minutes and then we\ncan kind of like launch into like what\nwe need to be doing\nyou know coaching like i don't know what\nyour understanding of coaching is but\nbasically we kind of operate\nunder the assumption that like if you\nunderstand yourself then like you can\nkind of\ndo what's in your best interest and kind\nof go from there and what keeps people\nkind of in place is like they don't\nreally understand much about themselves\nand so i'm assuming that's like part of\nthe reason what brings you here and\nabsolutely we'll get into that more cool\nso\ni think sometimes i understand myself\ntoo well\nokay yeah i want to get into that in a\nsecond\ni've been coaching for you know since\nlast summer this is like what i do\nfull-time it's like what's on my mind\nall the time it's\nthis is my jam just some expectations\nabout um\nhow this is gonna work so we're gonna\nshow up at the same time every week for\n50 minutes sometimes we go\na little bit over that that's usually\nfine um\ni try to avoid it because i have other\nclients kind of lined up afterwards\nbasically what we're going to be doing\nin session is like i'm going to ask you\nquestions and you're just going to like\nanswer me and we're just\nkind of just having a conversation\nsometimes i give assignments i don't\nusually do that it's not really my thing\nsome coaches do more some coaches do\nless i'm\ni'm one of the ones who do less i'm not\nreally great at assignments anyway\nyeah that makes sense to me uh\nthere's going to be surveys after every\nsession so like i encourage you to get\nthose done\nas you get them if you have trouble with\nassignments and that\nsort of be is one of them that we could\ntalk about that we might have to do them\nin session but i don't get any of that\ndata none of that goes to me so you can\nbe as honest as you need to i don't i\ndon't see what you write\nas for like confidentiality like you\nalready signed off on that i'm not gonna\nlike tell people your business\nuh like me and the other coaches we kind\nof talk about cases anonymously to kind\nof like\nyou know get input on sort of like how\nto help people like just like which my\nclients in this situation like what\nshould i focus on\nright okay um and then yeah\nmedical disclaimer you know this isn't\ntherapy i know this isn't therapy\nit's not treatment of any kind we're\njust two people but what what's\nbut i i've never really been in therapy\ni thought this was like what's different\nabout this in therapy\nisn't it yeah that's good about your\nfeelings\nuh it can be but it not always is like\nit's not always the case so like we talk\nabout feelings here that tends to be the\nnatural progression\num but some clients we talk more about\nfeelings than others\num therapy is very specialized it's very\nspecific um whereas coaching is\ni i don't want to just say i'm just a\ndude but like i'm kind of just a dude\nand you know i just want to like help\nyou figure your [ __ ] out\nwhereas a therapist is like no they're\nnot\ni can't really speak for them so maybe i\nwon't but i hope that makes sense\nyeah cool um yeah so like\nthat sounds great man like how do we get\nstarted\nwhy don't you tell me like what brings\nyou to coaching like what's your\nsituation what's like your deal what's\nyour vibe\num well kind of like you said i i kind\nof feel like i'm stuck\nyeah you know what makes you say that\nwell i feel like um\nyou know i kind of know\nwhat i need to do it's just i'm sort of\nlike lazy\nlike i was born with like the\nundisciplined trait\non my character sheet okay and so um\nyou know you kind of mentioned that like\nwe're here to figure things out but i\nfeel like i've kind of already figured\neverything out like i know what i need\nto do\nit you know i kind of know who i am and\nwhat my weaknesses are it's just like i\ncan't figure out a way to\nyou know i i really want to get more\ndisciplined okay\nuh so first thing i apologize if i laugh\ni laugh a lot but it's nothing\nyou know if that bothers you let me know\num second i get laughed out of that\nsounds like no big deal\nfair enough uh we will talk about that\nmore\num come on facts you can't let that\nslide bro\nwhat would you actually it's your fault\ni know i know it's my fault it's my face\nthat would not\nthat you know that would not yeah that's\nnot how you would respond\nsorry sounds like you know yourself\npretty well\nand so it's like you know if that's the\ncase it's like what can be done\nabsolutely go from here yeah right\nthat's why\nyou know i've been watching dr k streams\nfor a while\nand um you know i was thinking that like\nyou know by the way when do i get to see\nhim uh\non stream this week later i think um\nthat's not like kind of how\nlike you're not gonna like have a\nsession with him i mean you can like\napply for like his\nindividual like he's like a psychiatry\nwebsite where like you can kind of\nsign up for i think they're at capacity\nright now because healthy gamer kind of\nblew up out of nowhere but\nwas that an expectation you had did you\nthink no i just\ni wasn't sure it's just you know\nsometimes i think that like um\nyou know i feel like i like he would\nreally understand me\nand he seems to like help a lot of\npeople like get on stock so\nyou know that's why i signed up for\ncoaching\nright okay uh\nlet me think about that\nyeah so you're saying because he\nunderstands people he could be helpful\nyeah i mean i've tried help from a lot\nof people and it hasn't really worked\nso you know i sometimes feel like this\nis my like last chance\nokay what does that mean well\ni don't know man like i've tried\neverything you know i've tried like\nreading books and like i've tried like\nyou know i've watched a lot of jordan\npeterson's stuff and\nand you know like no matter how\nimportant it is to clean my room like i\njust can't\nclean my room like it's just\nit's still a mess and so i i don't know\nit just sort of feels like\nyou know like i was just born with that\nundisciplined trait so i don't really\nknow\nyou know like i feel like if i could\nflip a switch in my brain\nthen like my life would be awesome\nlike i know exactly what i need to do\nand i just need to flip that switch\nand once that switch gets flipped\nand i've seen it kind of happen on\nstream with dr k where like you can see\npeople like flip a switch in their brain\nand like i just know that\nyou know their life is transformed\ngotcha\nso so what i'm hearing is that you've\ndone a lot of kind of\nexternal like research yeah and like\nabout how that relates to you about all\nthe things you like need to do\nand so you're saying like you know since\nyou know everything that has to be done\nyou just need to like find this switch\nand like flip it\nand like once that happens it's like\nyour life is perfect\nabsolutely man\nokay what what about you makes you\nsay that you're just like undisciplined\nthat you just like have this trait\nwell i mean like i see other people like\nliving their lives right but that's not\nwhat i do\nlike other people get up and they you\nknow like shower and shave and like\ncook themselves some breakfast and stuff\nlike that and in my case it's sort of\nlike\ni just wake up and you know just hop\nonline and like\nkind of screw around on reddit for like\nan hour or two and then\nyou know i know there's like stuff i\nneed to do but and then like i start\nwatching twitch and i kind of have that\nup on my second monitor\nand then maybe i'll like play some games\nand then like\nyou know i have some pizza left over\nfrom yesterday\nso okay so what i'm hearing you say is\nlike\ncompared to other people you're like not\ndisciplined because\ninstead of waking up yeah because like\nother people other people like wake up\nand they\n[ __ ] do stuff and i just wake up and\ni don't do [ __ ]\nwhat do you think about that it\nsucks what sucks about that\nwell i mean it's like every day is like\ngroundhog day\nlike every day is the same and like\nevery day is like\nyou know like every day that goes by\nlike i know i like i just know exactly\nwhat i need to do i just can't do it\nsounds frustrating yeah\ni just think of like a dog on a leash\nthat's just like barking at everything\nbecause it wants to like run at stuff\nbut it's like on this leash\nand doesn't really understand it\nyeah i mean i guess that's that's a good\nway of putting it like i do feel like\nyou know definitely there's something\nholding me back so that's like you know\nlike the switch like i want to get off\nthe leash\nyou know yep\nwhat's it like to be on that leash like\nyou say it sucks\nand like it's frustrating but like is\nthere more to it\ni mean i think it's it's sort of like\nyou know the difference is that with a\nleash you can take it off but like in my\nsituation that feels like it's like a\nleash made\nout of concrete like it's just the way\nit is\nand you know i've tried a lot of stuff\nand like people have tried to help me\ntoo\nand it's been a waste of time and you\nknow sometimes like it's also kind of\nlike [ __ ] annoying because like they\ntell me like they know what it's like\nto like be in my shoes so they'll just\nlike tell me stuff right they'll be like\noh you should just do this bro\nyou just go like just right go and do\nthat bro\nand i mean i would if they could yeah it\nsounds like they don't really get it\nand like there's kind of a disconnect\nit's like you know that stuff already\nyeah it's like you don't need you don't\nneed captain hindsight telling you what\nyou should have done or what you should\nbe doing\ni mean it's like their brain is\ndifferent from my brain right like they\nwere born with the discipline right so\nthey can do that kind of thing\nyeah oh look you've kind of said a lot\nof times now like you've kind of made\nthis allusion to like\nyou know i'm just this way and that's\njust how it is and like other people\naren't\nyeah i guess i\nyo what what he isn't that\ni'm confused why do what is that yeah\nwhat yeah so like\ni'm just yeah because that's how it is\nright so\nwhen i think about that like if that's\njust how it is then it's like i don't\nknow if we can do anything\nright\nwell i mean yeah i mean that's why i\nkind of feel like this is my last chance\nbecause it's like\nyou know i don't feel like i can do\nanything\nlike it would be easy if i was like\ndisciplined\nyep so what i mean you say like it's\njust how it is but like what\nlike what's the what's underneath it\nlike how do you know that\nhow do you know that that's just how it\nis for you\nwell i mean because i have lots of\nevidence\nright so i i have like\nlike you know just for example like\ni'm i sometimes like am alone and like i\nwant a relationship but i can't\nget one and you know i've kind of like\ni've tried that in the past but like\nwomen just find me unattractive so\nyou know there's just really nothing i\ncan do about that\nit's just truth you know\nthat that you're unattractive yeah\nso like you can't ask people out because\nit's just like you just know like you're\nunattractive and it's like\nthere's no point absolutely\nyou know because like like i was reading\nthis website and they were talking about\nsignals like\nyou know how to tell if a girl likes you\nand like they don't give me any of the\nsignals like so i know they don't like\nme\noh okay\nso because you're not getting these\nsignals that you that you researched\non the internet it's like you just know\nthey don't like you at all\nyep\nright because that's how you know\nlike whether they like you or not and so\ni just know cause like i can also look\nin the mirror\nand i can tell you know i don't have the\njawline\nright because you don't have the jawline\nyou're not gonna you're not getting the\nsignals so\nyou can't ask anyone out yep\nokay\nso yeah man i feel like the way you're\nyou're presenting oh go ahead\ni was just gonna say i mean i guess i\ncould but like it's not gonna go well\nyou know wha what makes you say that\nwell because i'm not getting the signal\nso like\nit's just not going to go well\nwhat does it mean to to go well\num i i don't know i guess like she'd\ngive me her number\nokay i guess i i don't really know\ni haven't really thought about that\nbefore\nokay what does it mean if you ask her\nout and she doesn't give you her number\ni i think it i think it just confirms\nwhat i knew before right that like\nshe wasn't giving me the signal so\nthat's you know\nthat i'm unattractive like i kind of\nknow that already it's just like\nyou know it's just testing a hypothesis\nlike finding proof for your hypothesis\nso if you know it to be true what's the\nharm in asking then what's the harm in\njust trying and seeing what happens\nwell i mean i already know what's gonna\nhappen so like what's the point doing it\nyou sound like you you know what's going\nto happen a lot of the time\nlike you sound very convinced like you\nknow how things are going to pan out\nyeah smart dude super high iq\nright have you ever been wrong about\nthat\njust curious have you ever thought you\nknew what was gonna happen and then\nyou were pleasantly or unpleasantly\nsurprised i mean very few times\nright like sure like theoretically i can\nbe wrong\nlike sometimes i make posts on reddit\nthat get downvoted and people tell me\ni'm wrong\nthat's just because they're a bunch of\nnoobs\nhow do how does that how does that feel\nwhen like a post gets downvoted\na bunch that's a really good question i\nnever really thought about that\num i mean i i think it sort of like\nfeels like i'm\nyou know like the world is all like\ntelling me one thing and like i think\nsomething else\nyou know and it just makes me feel a lot\nlike you know they're like\nall the regular people out there who are\nsort of like living their lives and like\nthat's their perspective of like regular\npeople\nyou know it kind of feels a lot like\nwhen people say\nyou know just go do this it's like they\nall like they all think that and like\neveryone tells me this stuff like all\nthe time\nlike people tell me that like i'm\nactually like pretty good looking\nyou know like you know\nand stuff like that like people tell me\nall this stuff all the time but\nyou know that sounds like kind of very\nconflicting\nyeah i guess so i mean it's just you\nknow it's like people like my mom though\nyou know so it's like it's her job to\ntell you that\nand then also like some of my sister's\nfriends and things like that so it's\njust like\ngot you it it's your mom's job and your\nsister's friend's job to\nsay that you're attractive well i mean\nit's not really their job but\nyou know they're just they're like\nmaking fun of me you know\nwhat what makes you say that well i mean\ncome on dude\nlike do you think i'm attractive what\nwould it mean to you\neither way\nwhat do you what do you mean by that\nso i mean you're pretty certain that\nyou're unattractive that's what you're\ntelling me\nyeah and so whether i did or not it\nsounds like it doesn't matter sounds\nlike\nit like means nothing\nwell i mean if if you were like genuine\nabout it i\nyou know that's kind of interesting\nbecause like i feel like if you were to\nsay\nyeah i do think you were attracted first\nof all that'd be [ __ ] weird and then\nsecondly like you know i feel like it'd\nbe your job to say that\nyeah but then i'm kind of like i'm kind\nof realizing that i'm putting myself\ninto like a logical fallacy which is\nlike\nyou know no matter what it's like\ni kind of ask a question but like i i'm\njust noticing that\nyou know no matter what you say i'm\ngoing to think the same thing yeah\nthat's kind of what it sounds like to me\nis like no matter which answer i give\nyou\ni'm either doing my job and like\npatronizing you or i'm weird\nor you were right the whole time at the\nend of the day you're correct\nwhat does that mean i'm gonna give that\none back to\nyou like what do you think about that\nwell i know what you're gonna say\nwhat am i gonna say well you're gonna\nsay it's like all in my head and like\nthis is all self-fulfilling prophecy or\nlike\nand like you know that no matter what i\nlike\nlike i see what you're saying like\nyou're kind of like maneuvering me into\nthis corner of like\nyou know it doesn't matter you know it\ndoesn't\ni don't know man it feels like\nyou know it feels like you're going to\nsay that it's like all in my head\nwhat makes you think i would say that to\nyou\nwell because it is like it's like you\nknow like\nlike kind of like you what you said like\nyou were like you know what would it\nmean to you and i\ni don't know i mean i'm kind of seeing\nthat you know i can see like it doesn't\nmatter what\nhow you would respond to that and so\nlike what you would tell me is that\nyou know maybe i'm doing that in other\nparts of my life like i've i've watched\ndr k's videos like i know how this [ __ ]\nworks you know\nand then and then you know i don't i\ndon't know man\nthis is not what i was expecting isn't\nit\nyeah how do you feel right now uh it's\nlike different from what i was expecting\nlike i thought that\nyou know you would be like teaching me\nhow to meditate and\nyou know i thought like like maybe you\nwould ask me like bunches of questions\nabout like my feelings like what feeling\nis that\nand what feeling is that and what\nfeeling is that but i don't know i just\ndidn't think it would be so\ni don't know man it's just it's just\ndifferent from what i was expecting\nyou know your expectation was not met\nthis is not what you were expecting at\nall and so\nyou're feeling a type of way it's\ninteresting because i've asked you twice\nnow kind of like\nabout feeling like how do you feel and\nand you've kind of never really given me\na straight answer so if you don't mind\ni'm going to ask you again like how do\nyou feel right now\nhonestly like you know like kind of\nconfused but also like a little bit\nintrigued\nlike i i think you may be a pretty smart\ndude\ni don't know uh but okay so you feel\nconfused and intrigued\nwhat's intriguing i mean it's just not\nwhat i expected you know i think that\nlike\ni've watched so much stuff about this\nkind of thing and like usually people\nare\nyou know just like giving you like you\nknow people will say like these are the\n10 things you need to do\nto get your life in order like jvp's\nbook about you know the 12\nrules and it's like you know\nand and so it's different because we're\nnot i mean you're not really like giving\nme rules\nwhich is like what most people kind of\ndo right so it's kind of weird\nyeah i mean it sounds like you've sought\nout a lot of those rules and nothing has\nreally come of it\nwell yeah because i'm undisciplined\nyou know so it's like it's like how do i\nget undisciplined is the\nis the question i i don't really know if\nwe're\nworking on that or not i thought you\nwould like give me like a\nyou know like do this and then do this\nand then do this kind of thing\nright uh let me think for a second\nremember when we were talking about\nattractiveness like two seconds ago\nyeah right and like it really seems like\nfor a moment there you kind of like\nstarted to think a little differently\nabout\nyour assumption was am i wrong there\nno i mean i think it's it you know i\ndon't know that i was thinking\ndifferently but like\ni was definitely thinking about it you\nknow i'm still pretty sure like i've\ngotten mountains of evidence about how\nunattractive i am so i'm\nyou know that past is still real but\nlike\nyou know i think it's definitely sort of\na little bit different i don't know\nwhat do you mean by that how is it\ndifferent\ni don't know man i just feel kind of you\nknow confused\nwhat's confusing i thought you knew that\nyou like weren't attractive you had like\nall this evidence right\nyeah but then there's this whole other\nangle of like maybe it's all in my head\nright\nwhat makes you think that\nbut i guess you\ni mean don't you think i'm stupid\nlike for i mean like it's dumb dude like\ni'm like confused like\nyou must think i'm an idiot because like\nyou're asking all these simple questions\nand like i don't have good answers for\nthem\nyou say you don't have good answers like\nwhat makes you say that\nwell because like i could hear the words\ncoming out of my mouth and they're like\nthey're not like you're asking me like\nwhy i'm confused and i can't even answer\nthat you know it's sort of like\nyeah you seem pretty taken aback right\nnow yeah\nabsolutely man like i said this isn't\nwhat i was expecting\nhow do you feel like physically right\nnow\nkind of uncomfortable like like just i\ngot like a little bit of tightness in my\nchest like i'm not\nyou know i feel like i need to take a\ndeep breath and sort of sit up\ndo you think do you want to try that do\nyou want to like take a deep breath and\nlike sit up\nyeah maybe i guess\ni'll do it with you i mean i'm standing\nbut\nyeah yeah that's that's cool i should\nget a standing desk too\nuh i'm not laughing\nat the client i'm laughing at dr k um\nsure so let's take a deep breath yeah\nall right pax let's pause\njust like yeah please so pax\nhow was that for you\num familiar but\nvery extreme i would say i've never had\na client who's like on that end\nlike so far on that end right absolutely\nso pax i thought you did a fantastic job\ni was trying to throw you as many\ncurveballs as i could\nin wednesday i could tell yeah i thought\nyou did a really fantastic job let's\njust i'm going to check\na chat what did you guys think about\nthat\nno so this is the thing is so so even\nthough i was trying\nreally really hard pax to be\nso sure of my beliefs you did a\nfantastic job of like confusing me which\nis exactly what you need to do\nright so like because when people have\nvery rigid beliefs about themselves\nwhat what we want to do is like we want\nto you know it's sort of like they've\nsaved a document that is only readable\nbut is not editable\nand so confusion is actually like the\nfirst step of moving from\npre-contemplative to contemplative\nso you did actually a really good job of\nthat of you know kind of\nasking open-ended questions i also threw\nout a lot of traps for you\nwhich you dodged really well right you\nwant to tell people what the traps are\nand what we explain about traps\nyeah i mean asking me [ __ ] like um do\nyou think i'm attractive like do you\nthink i'm stupid like\nyou know anything where like if i say\nyes or no i have like\ni've essentially confirmed something\nthat they believe right\nand so by kind of avoiding that you know\ni'm not giving them what they want\nbecause a lot of times when people are\nthat pre-contemplative like they just\nwant to be\nright about what they feel so sure about\nbecause like\nweirdly enough that's like it's kind of\nego gratifying and like it kind of makes\nthem\neven though they feel like [ __ ] all the\ntime like makes them feel better because\nthey're like well i'm right no one can\nhelp me so like there's nothing to be\ndone\nright right so the beautifully said i\ndon't know\nso pax i thought that was a perfect\nexample\nsummary of what i was projecting\nwhich is i want to be right and [ __ ] you\nand so nothing can be done right i'm i'm\nhelpless i'm hopeless\ni'm sure i'm helpless and hopeless and\nthere's no way that i'm wrong about\nbeing helpless and hopeless\nand so like when you create confusion\nthat's actually\nreally really good because then like\nwhat am i confused about it changes the\nrigidity of me being hopeless\nand so you also did a really good job of\ni said like oh you\nyou think like something about when i\nwas talking about the self-fulfilling\nprophecy\nyou did a really good job around that\ntoo where you were like oh i said\nsomething like\nyou think that what did i say\ndo you remember what i'm talking about\nwhere like um you kind of um\nlike i said that i felt confused and oh\nyou must think this is all in my head\nand you did a really really good job of\nlike not\nstepping into that trap too because you\ncould have said\nyou know because it is all in my head\nand you know it's all in my head and you\ncould have said\nit's all yeah like you know\nsort of like i wonder about that\nsometimes\nand and so even though that would have\nand so i i for people watching so like\nthat was a really really important point\nfor pax because\ni was moving in the right direction and\nif pax had agreed with me that i would\nhave gotten super defensive and then\nlike retreated\ni don't know if you guys were able to\nfollow that but\num so so like but when you didn't own\nthat when you were like no i actually\ndon't you didn't say yes or no right you\ndid a good job you're like no i\ni don't think it's all in your head no\nit must be so hard for you\nand like yeah maybe like maybe it is all\nin your head bro\nyou know and so the more that you\nwere and this is a very like sort of tai\nchi kind of like manner to you pax which\nis awesome\nwhich is that i'm trying to push you\nlike one way or the other and i'm like\nit's all in my head right and then\nyou're like i'm not gonna take that bait\nand the the less bait you take like the\nfurther i\nmove in my own exploration because like\ni have all these patterns in my mind\nthat are gonna snap to judgments\nand close off kind of like free thinking\nand so when you don't like let me do\nthat i'm trying to snap either way\ndo you think i'm attractive oh if he\nsays yes\noh it's his [ __ ] job to say that like\noh he's just lying to me right\nit's just like my mom and if i say if\nyou say no oh see i knew\nall right all along in either case i'm\nmoving\ninto completely explored territory that\ndoesn't help me at all\nand so when you avoid that trap it like\nforces me to like think about stuff\nand so confusion in this in this\nscenario is absolutely like that's what\nwe see in coaching is like\npeople get confused because we start to\nlike\nwork in a way where we don't let them go\ndown like the same old track over and\nover and over again\nand if you let me go down that same old\ntrack over and over and over again\nit's gonna be the self-fulfilling\nprophecy cool thanks a lot pax\nthank you poggers cool thanks a lot take\ncare\nall right peace"
