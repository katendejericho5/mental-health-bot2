    "transcript": "hello\nhi welcome\nthank you thank you for having me um can\nyou first start by just telling me what\nwould you like to be how do you want me\nto refer to you today\nann anderson okay and can you tell us a\nlittle bit about where we can find you\non the interwebs\nyeah um i've been streaming on twitch\nfor\nseven and a half almost eight years just\nover seven years um yeah so i'm\ntwitch.tv slash ammunition i've been all\nover the place for a long time um\n[Music]\nyoutube all the socials are all the same\nsure cool and what kind of streaming do\nyou usually do\num i mostly play fps games i was really\nbig into rainbow six siege for a long\ntime um lately i've been playing a lot\nof escape from tarkov\num and i kind of sometimes will just get\nyou know some uh variety games and i\nlike first person um like rpgs last of\nus the witcher that kind of thing um but\nmost of the time i'm playing fps games\nwhat do you like about fps games\num i\ngrew up on fps games i started i think\none of my very first video games was\ngoldeneye when i was a kid\nand 64.\nyeah\nyeah and i've just always i mean i was\nreally big into halo\num\nyeah i've always i've just always played\nfbs games\ncool yeah i've always sucked at fps\ngames including it started with golden\neye\nand has continued through quake and\nunreal tournament and at that point i\njust kind of gave up back around 2004.\nso yeah i had a lot of fun playing that\nin high school like halo and halo 2.\nyeah yeah cool\num so thanks for coming on today uh is\nthere something in particular you wanted\nto talk about\nor anything that we could potentially\nhelp you with yeah we talked about um i\ntalked about this a lot on stream\nactually about how i feel like streaming\nover the course of time that i've been\ndoing it um has had a lot of impact on\nthe way that i socialize and i was\neven with streaming i feel like i i've\ni've always struggled to\nmake friends with people that i\ni feel like i've struggled to make deep\nfriendships with people\num it's easy to kind of have these like\nsurface level friendships with people\nthat you\num are in band with or you know whatever\nin school\num but i think streaming has kind of\nexacerbated that and made it very\ndifficult because it's almost like\nthere's\nthis underlying um\nit's almost like transactional sometimes\nand you worry about\nyou don't want the other person to think\nthat you're trying to like leach off of\nthem you don't want to feel like they're\nleeching off of you\num i've had experiences before where i\nstarted trying to befriend someone and\nthen found out that they just wanted to\nuh get on my stream\nand so stuff like that really kind of\nlike bites you you know um and so now i\nfeel like i just can't i feel like i\nreally struggle to\nmake friends with people because you\nalso like don't see people in real life\never you know conventions are pretty\nmuch gone for now um\nso yeah so\nand can i kind of ask you are you so do\nyou\nhave people that you're kind of close to\noutside of the streaming world like in\nyou know irl friends and stuff like that\nor do you think that's\nbeen hard given streaming and\nall that stuff\nwell so when i was i when i was in\ncollege and i had a lot of um\ngood friends when i was in college\nthat were\npeople that i worked with i worked on\ncampus and\nafter college i feel like we all just\nkind of\nsplit up um i didn't really mean\nmaintain any of those friendships\num and now most of my friends are either\npeople who are streamers or people who\nuh like work at twitch or work in like\nkind of the same industry\nsure\nso you're noticing that there's like um\na blend or overlap between your\nprofessional life and your personal life\nyeah i mean i feel like that's not too\nout of the ordinary probably a lot of\npeople yeah that's like how you make\nfriends is yeah at the office or\nwhatever absolutely right so there's a\nlot of overlap there um and so how you\nknow how would you say that streaming\nhas changed the way that you socialize\nwhat i mentioned before where i feel\nlike there's always this kind of\num\ni'm usually worried that if if i'm\ntrying to like befriend someone um\nwho is also a streamer who\nhappens to have like a larger social or\nsorry a larger um like viewership than\nme um i don't want them to think that\ni'm\ntrying to\nlike leech off of their their success\nand so if it's somebody you know that\ni'm like genuinely i would be interested\nin being friends with them\num\ni feel like i i will make an effort to\ntry to be friends with them and then if\nthat effort isn't\num\ni forget the word like reciprocated\nreciprocated yeah if it's not\nreciprocated on like an evil\nuh equal level then\ni usually just like back off and then\nthat's kind of it\nlike kind of you know i don't want to\nlike be pushy with people\nand and how would you know okay i\nthis is hard and\nyeah\nyes welcome to my life\nlet me just think for a second usually\nit takes me a while to get there\nbut um\nso here's the first problem that i'm\nseeing\nso usually when people come in with\nproblems\nit's easy if like the problem isn't as\nreal as they think it is and it's like\nsomething that has to do with them\ndoes that make sense\ni think so\nso like like for example let's say like\ni have a patient in in my practice right\nand they say they come in and they say\ni'm depressed\nand like if their life is wonderful and\nthey have a clinical illness then the\nproblem is within them\nand so that i'm like i'm good with right\nso like that's what i do i help people\nlike fix things that are busted within\nthem\nwhat's really hard is sometimes i'll get\npeople that come into my office and\nthey'll say like oh you know\num i'm going through a divorce\nuh and\nmy partner is making allegations that i\nwas like sexually abusive to our\nchildren to get a leg up in the divorce\nwhich is in turn cause problems at my\njob\nand so that's\nand if someone comes in saying something\nlike that like\nyou know i don't think necessarily that\nthe problem is within them it's not like\nthey're mentally ill and have a\nneurochemistry imbalance it's like\ngenuinely like their life is falling\napart\nand that's not something that i can fix\nso it kind of gives me pause does that\nmake sense\nyeah so the first thing that i'm taken\naback by is just\nhow challenging your circumstances are\nlike i don't know that you're like i'm\nnot hearing that you've got social\nanxiety\nor like you know any that's maybe you do\nwho knows maybe we'll get there but you\nknow i'm not hearing like a you problem\ndoes that make sense\nyeah i understand it's kind of it's just\nthe circumstances of my profession and\nthe way that\nmy people in my profession socialize is\nchallenging yeah absolutely and and so\nthat's what kind of gives me pause\nbecause i'm noticing there's lots of\nissues i suspect around boundaries there\nare issues around expectations i see big\nissues around conflicts of interest\nright so you have dual relationships and\nanytime you have a dual relationship it\ncomplicates things it's the same reason\nwhy you know therapists are not allowed\nto date their patients\nright so like there's like an inherent\nconflict of interest it's the same\nreason why you shouldn't go into\nbusiness with family\nbecause there's like a dual relationship\nthere and anytime there's a dual\nrelationship things get muddy\num and so i'm i'm struggling a little\nbit because i\ni don't know how to help you with this\nso i i need a second to think\nokay which because i don't want to be\nlike sorry sucks for you the world is\nwhat it is gg i'll catch you next time\nthanks for having me yeah\nwhich is which is honestly what where\ni'm kind of leaning towards right now so\ni gotta i gotta check check myself for a\nsecond\num\nso and let me ask you a question so i'm\nnoticing that\nyou're\nare you usually like pretty even keel\num yeah\nyeah i get that on stream a lot of uh is\nshe depressed because i just i have a\nvery um\nmonochrome uh\nattitude i think pretty yeah you know\nlevel\num\nyeah how long have you been that way\nuh i would say probably my whole life\nokay\num and how does it feel when people kind\nof like notice that when people in your\nchat ask like is she depressed\num i don't i usually make a joke about\nit um\ni think it's i it's something that's\nvery obvious to me about my own\npersonality is that i'm not uh\ni'm not a person who has very\nextreme reactions to things\num which i think\noften on camera that is kind of\nexacerbated\nby being on camera i feel like if you if\nyou have just like a regular reaction to\nsomething the camera doesn't usually\npick up on that i feel like a lot of\ntimes that's why content creators end up\nover exaggerating things\num\nand so i think because i'm i'm pretty\nneutral most of the time even when like\nbig things happen\ni think that comes across as me like not\ncaring and sometimes that kind of\nfrustrates me where\neither like people will think that i\njust don't care about something that\nhappens and it's just because i'm not\nforcing myself to overreact to things\num or if i do actually have a moment\nwhere i i react in a big way then\nthere's people that are just like why is\nshe faking her laugh and why is she\nyou know pretending or something so\nkind of sounds like you can't win\nsituations yeah i was gonna say it\nsounds like damned if you do damned if\nyou don't yep\nyeah\nwhat's it like to be put into those\nsituations\nit sucks that's one of my least favorite\nthings about streaming it feels like\nyou're kind of trapped in between uh\nlike i feel like you you can have those\nmoments where\nyou're\nabove it and you're like well you know\nyou can't please everyone and so\ndo whatever you want and that's fine but\na lot of content\ncreation\nsurround is surrounded by having to\nplease\nthe audience right like that is that's\nhow you get a bigger audience is by\nbeing interesting to people that are\nwatching and\nso it's like you kind of have to do both\nyeah so\nand let me ask you it's okay if i call\nyou ann right yes okay\num\nso\ni'm kind of\ngetting a sense that like you know like\nyou said you're kind of trapped so i i'm\ni'm really\ncurious and almost confused also amazed\nand it's a weird plethora of things but\nhow you manage to get up every day and\nstream\nlike because if you're faced with a\nsituation where you can't you know it's\nlike if you emote too much\nit's like ah she's being fake for views\nand if you don't emote enough it's like\nshe's heartless\nyou know maybe a little bit of a\nhyperbole but i'm trying to mimic the\ninternet here\nno that's pretty accurate actually ah\n[ __ ]\noh my god that's pretty spot on\nyeah\nyeah\nhow do you do that how do you i don't\nknow there's um there's a florence in\nthe machine song where she says i don't\nknow how i don't just stand outside and\nscream and that's how i feel sometimes\nit's like i don't know um i mean i like\nplaying video games i've been playing\nvideo games for\nyou know forever so\ni got into streaming because it was\nsomething that i wanted to\nshare with people you know um\nbut\ni mean it is\nit's like a constant\nassault of\ndifferent\npeople's opinions and like people who\nwill just throw out a comment without\nreally\nthere's not a lot of like\nspice behind it you know they're just\nsaying things i think a lot of times\nit's like you know like young kids who\nwill just be like oh you look depressed\nor like why are you ugly today you're\njust like and sometimes it just hits you\nand you're like\nyou want to just snap back at them and\nsometimes probably too often i do\nbecause i just get so frustrated with it\nbut\nthat's just kind of part of the job\nwhat makes you want to stand outside and\nscream\nuh\nwell the double standard of it is\nfrustrating to me um\nif i try to\ntalk about social justice issues i get\ncalled a social justice warrior people\nbe like oh here comes the feminazi blah\nblah um if\nsome\nyou know 20 000 viewer white male\nstreamer does it then everyone's like oh\ngood for you you know good job\num\nand so that that kind of thing really\nfrustrates me where it's like people who\nchampion\nthe ideas of like\nuh i mean mental health talking about\nmental health and um\nyou know that kind of thing is\ni feel like a lot of times you get\nshouted down and then\nif you have enough of a following then\npeople will praise you for it and that\nis frustrating to me\nyeah i just realized something\ncan you have a male feminazi\noh probably\nbecause i would think so too but i just\nrealized that i've never heard someone\ncall a man a feminazi right if you're if\nyou're a female feminist\ni've seen lots of female feminists get\ncalled feminaz i don't think i've ever\nseen a male feminazi before\nyeah i think people will then usually\ngo for like the white knight or like\nsimp is now just the modern yeah white\nknight you know yeah yeah simping for\nsomeone yeah so it sounds like the\ndouble standard frustrates you um\nand i am kind of noticing that you'll\nsort of voice an emotion but we as i was\nmentioning earlier you're kind of even\nkeel so you don't sound frustrated\nyou don't look frustrated\nbut you feel frustrated\nsometimes it's not like a 24 7 i feel\nthis way um\nbut sometimes yeah i think i've seen\nmaybe youtube clips of you owning people\nwho are\nmisogynistic\nif\nyeah that was a big day\nwhat was that\nwhat was the kotaku article\nuh i was playing siege and i was i think\ni was off stream but i was recording\njust in case anything like cool happened\nyou know um\nand\ni th there were just a couple of guys\nthat were\nbeing really shitty toward me um and so\ni was like recording it and just\ni wasn't responding to them i was just\nsaying like making call outs in the game\nand then i ended up being like the top\nfrag on our team um and they were still\njust being like really\naggressive and like\nyou know the whole go kill yourself etc\netc\num and\ni posted it on twitter and then someone\ndecided to post it on kotaku i guess and\nthere was a whole thing about it\nhow did you feel after the kotaku\narticle was posted\num i feel like i it surprised me it felt\nlike\nit was a lot of more attention being\ndrawn to something that is\num\nnot\nto me it doesn't it's not that big of a\ndeal you know so it felt like there was\na big spotlight being shined on\nsomething that was kind of a daily\noccurrence\num\nso i mean it would be kind of like a\nkataku article\nabout the color of your shirt today and\nyou're just like i don't know i just do\nthis um\nso it was a little bit uh intimidating\nto me because there were a lot of people\nthat came into my chat that day that\nwere saying like\nyou know um\nthey were saying really nice things\nactually they were like really positive\nabout the way that i responded or my\nlack of response to what those guys were\nsaying\nso\nwhat was intimidating about it\nuh well like i said it was just it was a\njust a big spotlight of\non something that to me was um\nnot\nthat interesting\nand so it was just i i was worried more\nabout um\nlike any negative reaction that might\ncome from it like i said of people that\nare just like oh you know who cares if\nthey told you to kill yourself like who\ncares if they said that why you know why\ndo you why do you care about that\nso i'm here i'm hearing that you were\nalmost anticipating\nan amplification of the hatred\nyeah\nyeah um well\nabout um\nanytime you talk about\npeople being\nmisogynistic or\nuh\nyou know\naggressive or just rude in online games\nthere's always the people there's always\nso many people that are just like i just\nmute them or whatever just ignore them\nor you know\nit's your fault because you didn't mute\nthem or you should have just ignored\nthem or who cares what they say like\ndon't let it bother you and\num so that kind of thing is\nfrustrating\nokay\nso\nand i think i have a sense of where to\ngo\nand i'm i'm going to\nchallenge you a little bit is that okay\nokay okay\nso we're gonna go into hard mode you\nready for it\nokay\nso i don't want you to use the word\nfrustrating anymore\nokay so i'm noticing what i think is\nthat frustration is actually an umbrella\nemotion\nthat covers other emotions\nso i'll give you an example um\nso you just said that like this is\nfrustrating because here's a spotlight\nof you doing something that is generally\nreceived by the internet is like a good\nthing like you're a champion\nyou're a hero\nright but that's not how it feels to you\nso it's kind of strange because a lot of\npeople are grateful probably like for\nwhat you did like they appreciate that\nyou're putting a spotlight on an issue\nthat's very common for people and yet\nyour response to it is not positive at\nall in fact you're kind of like\nintimidated concerned on guard\nthat yeah you know the the [ __ ] will\nlike they're gonna grab their pitchforks\nand they're gonna come right they're\ncoming for you\nand so you'll use the phrase like\nintimidating i mean it's very\nfrustrating\nintimidating is a good example of of\nkind of like i think you could have used\nfrustrated there\nbut i i'm getting the sense that like\nfrustration for you is sort of like what\nyou feel but i think there's like stuff\nunderneath the surface there\nso for example\nthere's a sense of like you've\nso i would venture i'm just gonna toss\nout some things one is that like\nthere's a complete gap in understanding\nbetween the kotaku article and like your\nactual experience\npeople are gonna look at you and be like\noh like she's such a champion of women's\nrights on the internet and she's\nschooling noobs right yay\ncheering for women in gaming you go girl\nbut that's so discongruent of your\nactual experience like you're not being\na hero\nyou're not like that's not how you see\nit you're not fighting for women's\nrights you're just trying to play a\n[ __ ] video game\nand you just want people to not be toxic\nand this is what you deal with every day\nit's it's kind of like i remember seeing\ntalking to my friends who uh i don't\nreally like work in a hospital anymore\nbut i have like friends who still work\nin hospitals and everyone is like\nhailing them as heroes and they're like\nwe're not heroes like we don't want to\nbe here we're not doing this out of\nchoice\nwe're being like ground down by a\npandemic where like people are dying\neveryone's getting sick and like there's\nlike you know we're sacrifices we're not\nheroes\nright and so what i can imagine could be\nfrustrating is like a complete lack of\nunderstanding between the way the world\nsees you and your experience\nyeah what do you think about something\nlike that\num\nyeah i think that happens\na lot um that\nif i\nif i do anything to highlight the way\nthat\nwomen are treated online even if in my\nmind i'm not doing this as a\nlike this happened because she's a woman\nbut rather just\nlike people are really shitty for some\nreason sometimes online\num and then it gets turned into kind of\na political\nthing that was not necessarily my\nintention but i can see where like where\npeople are getting that from\nand um\ni think intimidating is a good word or\njust worried uh worried about\nbacklash from\nyou know random people\num and then sometimes i i honestly\nactually sometimes i think i would feel\ni feel a little bit guilty almost that\nmy intention wasn't to\nlike they'll say like oh you did this\nthing for women and i have that feeling\nof like oh i that's not actually what i\nmeant to do but like maybe maybe that\nshould have been what i was doing and\nlike am i\nnot doing my job properly if i'm not you\nknow thinking of that\nso\nso and i'm gonna struggle to find the\nwords to say this\nbut\ni i think um i'm just noticing like\nthere's you\nand there's a really thick wall\nand then there's like the outside world\ndoes that resonate with you at all\nyes\nyeah exactly help me i don't i don't\nunderstand that can you help me\nunderstand that\nwhat do you mean you don't understand it\ni don't know why i'm getting this image\nbut that's just the image that i'm\ngetting\ni think that's the image that everyone\ngets and i think that's my problem with\nmaking friends is that\ni have\ni i can't tell you the number of times\nthat someone has come to me and they'd\nbe like anne\nyou're so cool i think you're just like\nthe coolest person i've ever met and\nthey'll talk to their friends they'll be\nlike isn't she so cool we want to be\nfriends with her\nand then we're just not friends and i\ndon't know how to like\nmake friends with them even though\nthey're like they i feel like sometimes\ni don't know if it's that there's\nmaybe it's a combination of things maybe\nit's the fact that i put a wall between\nmyself and others or for some reason\nthat wall exists but at the same time it\nfeels like other people\nsometimes put me on like a pedestal\nwhere they're like oh she's over here\nand she's cool and\nshe's\non it like unapproachable\nand then and i don't know how to get\nmyself off of that right like i don't\nwant to be there i just want to\nmake friends with people\nyeah so when you're saying people put\nyou on a pedestal you're talking about\npeople in your real life for kotaku\nno uh i meant like other streamers like\nother content creators or just like\npeople that i've met in person\num\nyeah\nyeah so my question was actually like a\na subtle point which is that i'm\nnoticing\na theme here\nabout\nand i'm still not i'm sniffing at it i\ndon't know exactly what it is yet but\nlike\ni'm getting the sense that you're not\nunderstood you can't form connections\nyou've sort of said that explicitly\nbut i i suspect that that has something\nto do with like\nare you at a disadvantage because you're\na streamer and this is the streaming\nworld and y'all are essentially in the\nbusiness of friendship so this is\nsomething we say a lot in our content\ncreator coaching program is we help like\nstreamers work through this idea that\ny'all are in the business of friendship\nright because friendships are collabs\nand collabs is work therefore\nfriendships are work and then you start\nto enter into this dual purpose of like\nare you my friend are you here for the\ncollab\nwhen you approach someone else and you\ngenuinely like them and they have five\nmillion more\nfollowers than you do\nlike how do you let that person know\nthat you actually don't give a [ __ ]\nabout that right you just think that\nthey're genuinely a cool person and you\nwant to connect human to human\nyeah exactly\nwhat i'm\nbut the the thing that's kind of\ninteresting\nand about the way that you view these\nthings is i'm noticing that in your\nlanguage you're like a separate entity\nfrom the outside world\nit's sort of like\nyou know you kind of say like oh that's\nwhat kotaku was thinking but that's not\nwhat i was thinking there's like there's\nno there's like not connection you feel\ntrapped because you know they're going\nto react to you this way or they're\ngoing to react to you that way they're\ngoing to either call you depressed or\nthey're going to call you\nyou know simp farming\nby expressing emotion you can't win so\ni'm just noticing that like the way that\nyour mind views the world\nis that the world is going to be like\nrunning on autopilot\nand then like you're you can try to move\naround within it but you can't really\nlike affect how the world interacts with\nyou\nyeah\nso i think as long as that i suspect\nthat contributes\nto the way that you form\nrelationships with people\nwhat do you think\nthat sounds accurate yes\nright so so i don't know how to\nundo that or to like change that you\nknow we'll get there i think so\nyou know i i think we\ni hopefully will get there so so i i\nthink there's there's actually something\nreally interesting which is while you're\na champion of women in the gaming space\ni don't get the sense that you feel\npowerful\ndo you feel powerful\nno not really\ndo you feel like you have agency\nlike the capacity to change things\nminor things\nyes\ni think but not\non a grand scale\nwhat about making a friend\nwhat's the scales had a grand scale of\nlife\nuh\ni mean i\nit's like not for lack of trying you\nknow it's like it's i feel like i try\nmaybe i'm not doing a good job of it but\nthat's not the question i asked okay pay\nattention now and i think your answer is\nrevealing\ndo you have the agency to change things\ni didn't ask you if you try to change\nthings i asked you can you\ncan you can i have friends\ncan i\ni think so yes\ni think i'm capable of that yeah\nwhat's the likelihood of the outcome\nthere\nare you theoretically capable or do you\nthink like you know who should where\nshould i place the bet should i bet on\nyou or should i bet on should we bet on\nfriendship or bet on not friendship\ni mean yeah like it's a thing that i\nhave done before so it's like i know\nthat i can do it it just feels like\nsomething that is\nvery challenging\nfor me\nso how hard have you tried\ni don't i don't know how do you quantify\nthat gut\nyeah um\nyou feel like you've tried hard uh well\nthat's that's what i was talking about\nearlier where it's like i feel like i\nwill\ntake a step forward\nand then i get\nworried\nabout\nwhat the other person is thinking what\ntheir reaction is or i don't feel like\ni'm seeing a\nreciprocation\nand so then i back off because i don't\nwant to pressure people or push people\nso i think i\ni would say i probably don't try like\nsuper hard in that sense because i don't\nwant to be\num\ni don't want to be overbearing\nokay so\ni'm gonna this is gonna be a bit blunt\nso i want you to envision something okay\nokay i'm going to take a step forward\nand i'm going to take a step back and\nthen i'm going to take a step forward\nand i'm going to take a step back and\ni'm going to take a step forward i'm\ngoing to take a step back\nif you're watching someone doing this\nand someone told you\nwhy don't you think that person is\nwalking forward and someone was like\nit's because there's an invisible wall\nthat's why they can't move forward what\ndo you think about that\nis that fair\nwhat do you mean by fair\nlike is that a fair interpretation of\nlike if someone just keeps on like\nstaying in place right like you're\ntaking a step forward and then you kind\nof pull back it's sort of like i'm\ngetting this image of a wall is like in\nthe way\nright i mean this is a bit blunt because\ni'm i'm asking you to stretch here i\ndon't think we've we've appropriately\nfilled in all the steps\nbut like i'm noticing a resistance right\nmaybe it's not a wall it's more like a\ntether\nthat keeps you like\nfrom really pushing forward and like\nyou know like i i think we're on to\nsomething here i'm sniffing something\nwhat do you think i could be wrong\nthough\nwell if we\nif we take your example\nof\ntaking a step forward towards someone\nand\num\nmaybe you take two steps forward and\nthey don't move you take another step\nforward and they still don't move or\nthey even maybe\nget distracted by something and they you\nknow start walking in another direction\num\nat what point do you\nyou know\nstop following that person\nyou know or you're just like\nwe're not actually like friends yet but\ni'm just\nwalking after you you know like\nfollowing you wherever you're going at\nwhat point does that person then turn\naround and be like\nwhy are you following me you know so i\nthink that's more of my\nmy fear i'm with you so where does that\nfear come from does that happen to you\num i mean i think that's just generally\nwhen i when i feel like i i'll like\nmessage people\num to ask them if they want to like play\ngames um they'll say like yeah sure like\nthat sounds great and then we just like\ni'll be like cool when you know do you\nwant to do that and then just like they\ndon't talk ever again\nwhat about\nbefore you\nlet's step outside of streaming for a\nsecond okay\nif you had any experiences where you\nfelt like you kind of chased someone\nand they were like what are you doing\num like middle school\nhigh school maybe college\ni think um i think most of the time\n[Music]\nit's more like uh\nlike for example i i mentioned that i\nworked at a place um that was on campus\nwhen i was at college and\nthere were probably\n15 employees\num and they were all students they were\nall about the same age\nand\ni always felt like we were all\nacquaintances\num\nand some of us were even friends and\nwould hang out\nbut i felt like i\nwas one of the people who\nwas i i never really felt like like i\nwas one of the the core group\num where\nit felt like there were people who were\num\nif they wanted to study together they\nwould call each other and i was not one\nof those people right like i was\nsomebody who worked with them and who\nwas like kind of friends with them\nbut was not\nthe like\nyou're an outsider\nyeah\nwere you an outsider in high school\nyeah i think it was kind of the same the\nsame scenario where i\nwas in like marching band or concert\nband or whatever\nand\nit always felt like kind of the same\nsocial dynamic\nwhat was it like to be in marching band\nuh\ni played trumpet so i had to hold my\ntrumpet up for many hours so i had\nreally great biceps but it was um\nit was a lot of\na lot of long hours\num\nwith like you know the same group of\npeople and so\ni mean there were people that i was like\npretty good friends with um\nat the time and then\nwe either\nkind of fell out of contact or\njust\nweren't friends anymore um\nyou know for various reasons so\nokay\nand can i ask you kind of a couple of\nlike\nrandom questions that are sort of all\nover the place\nokay\ncan you help me understand um so i\nnoticed you have some tattoos can you\ntell me a little bit about those\num sure uh well i have a star wars\ntattoo here if you can't tell i like\nstar wars i've got my own stuff back\nhere\num this one is from the witcher\nthis is from a\nuh a russian novel\num and the text says uh bold is the\nheart that steers her through the night\num and then i have uh this one here\nthat's supposed to be a representative\nof my family my siblings and my mom and\ni\nwha what is that one\nuh so it's a it's a horse here because\nmy mom loves horses and then it's a sun\nmoon and star which is my uh brother\nsister and i\ncan you tell me a little bit about your\nfamily\nyeah um\ni have an older brother and an older\nsister um we're all within about four\nyears of each other\nuh\ni grew up with my mom\n[Music]\nmy dad\nuh where my parents were divorced and he\nwould visit when i was a kid he would\nvisit maybe like two or three times a\nyear um\nand then\nuh now most of my family lives here in\ncalifornia we actually we all kind of\nended up here through\nwe lived in the midwest and then through\nyou know all sorts of different things\nwe all ended up in california\num\ni'm really\nclose with my sister and my brother and\nmy mom\nmy dad and i see each other every so\noften\nwe're not super close but\nwe have a like amicable relationship\nsure\ndid you\nwant more of a relationship with your\ndad\num\nsometimes i think i would i would see\nlike uh\nfor like again for our college we had um\nlike parent weekend and\num i would see like girls with their\ndads and i i wished for\nmyself that i had that kind of\nrelationship with my dad\num\nbut we just\nnever really had that\nand\ni don't know it's okay like i i like i\nsaid my mom and i are really close i\nfeel like she did a really good job of\nraising us and certainly\nyeah i think that much is clear\nyeah also sounds like you have very\nclose bonds with your siblings\nyeah yeah we're pretty close\num and why do you think you didn't have\nmore of a relationship with your dad how\ndo you understand that\nhow long do you have\num\nuh well when i was a kid um so my dad is\nuh korean and my mom is american and my\ndad uh\ni think\ngot a lot of uh\nof negative negativity from his his side\nof the family\nbecause he married an american woman and\nhad half american kids\num so his side of the family was always\npretty\num\nrude to us and kind of dismissive\num i was always frustrated with my\ndad not allowed to use that word oh yeah\num i was\ndisappointed\nand\n[Music]\nunhappy and resentful of my dad for\nsee what's under my frustration yeah\nright\num\ncan we just go back to the blanket term\nso i don't have to figure other words\nout yeah um\nbut he\nhe wanted us to\nbe\ni think he i think he had this idea that\nlike being american was like the secret\nto success and that\nhe didn't want us to\nbe very\nkorean so like he\ncould have taught us how to speak korean\nwhen we were kids you know like kids\nlike pick up languages and he just never\ndid\num because he wanted us to\num\nhe just didn't want us to be\nyou know korean and\ni just i think that also i mean if we\ntalk about feeling like an outsider\nwhenever i would go to my dad's\nyou know family function\num\nthey\nwell first all the other kids that were\nour age all spoke korean so we didn't\nand i think that was one of the reasons\ni really resented my dad because it's\nlike my cousins speak korean and i like\ncan't i feel like i can't hang out with\nthem\num\nsounds like he kind of doomed you to be\nan outsider\nyeah thanks dad\num i don't think it was like\n100 his fault um i definitely don't like\nblame it on him i think he\ntried to do\nwell because i think he tried to do\nwhat he thought\nwas the best\num i think he wanted us you know at the\nroot of it he wanted us to be\nsuccessful and healthy\nand now especially as we've gotten older\ni think my dad is kind of mellowed out i\nthink when we were kids he was really\ntrying to control\nour futures and our path and i think now\nthat we've all grown up and we're all\nkind of established in our own ways\num\nhe's\nreally calmed down about all that and\nhe's just like\nyou know\nyou guys are doing great and i'm glad\nyou're healthy and i think he's kind of\nhas a\nbetter perspective on what's really\nimportant\nrather than just\nget rich and\nyou know\nhave a lot of kids or something i don't\nknow\nand do you think your dad loves you\nyeah\nyeah i do think he does\ni think he does too\nyeah\num\nthat turned out to be a shorter story\nthan i was expecting oh there's more but\nthat's just i think the start of it you\nknow\nwhat what do you mean there's more\nand it sounds pretty\nreasonable and wholesome\nyeah um\ni don't know my\ndad\nuh\ni just hope he never watches this he got\nremarried without telling us um\ni'm pretty sure that the woman that he's\nliving with he also got remarried too\nwithout telling us\num\nhe\nhad to borrow money from me a lot when i\nwas in college\nhe\nwas uh he rented a car didn't pay for it\ngot arrested\num\nmy cousin who i hadn't spoken to in many\nyears called me to say that it was my\nfault because i didn't give him money\num\nwhen i didn't even know that he needed\nmoney because i had given him money in\nthe past\nso i think he just kind of shuffled the\nblame over onto me\num\ni don't know what else\ni think that's sufficient\nthat's yeah you know we'll start let's\njust start there\ndifferent picture huh\nyeah i mean but like i said despite all\nthat i think he's made\nlike not good decisions in his life but\ni do think that he cares\nabout us you know he cares about us as\nhis children\nso\nyeah i mean\ncan i think for a second\nhow does it feel to talk about this\nstuff\num\nit's okay it's been\nmany years since all of that and since\nuh\ni think the last time any of that really\nhappened was\ni don't know i think i was still in\ncollege at the time yeah i was still in\ncollege so that's been a while\nuh\nso i think now i'm okay with it it's\nkind of in the past you know\ni've moved on\nso and other random question okay this\nmay be the most offensive question that\ni ask you're welcome to not answer it\nyou're welcome to go tell me to [ __ ]\nmyself\num so i i noticed that you're wearing\nblack\nand that you have you know you have it\nseems like black is kind of your color\nokay technically this is gray okay\ntechnically sure\ntechnically do you is am i just catching\nyou on a day where you're like like\ndressing darker or is this sort of like\nis this your aesthetic like even when i\nlook at your cool like first of all it\nlooks cool okay your your room looks\ncool like there's a lot of like black\nand like some cool lighting and stuff\nlike that looks looks dope\nbut i i'm noticing you know there's not\nlike i don't see any blue i don't see\nany pink like there's a there's a plant\nin there\nthere's some there's some lighting in\nthere but it's very like black and white\nis kind of like your aesthetic there's\nsome blue okay yeah\nhow uh\ni mean is this is this usually kind of\nhow you\nlook or how you or is am i just catching\nyou on a darker day in terms of color\npalette\nyeah i think sometimes especially when i\nwas in\ncollege and then when i first started\nstreaming the first couple of years i\nwould say i wore a black shirt every day\num\nand i think the past maybe a year or two\ni've started wearing um\nmore different colors\nthan just black so and how do you can\nyou help me understand like when you\nstarted wearing so you started wearing\nblack a whole bunch when you started\nstreaming\nno uh i meant like\nfor\na long time but for probably all of like\nhigh school college and then when i\nstarted streaming and then\nokay i know it's kind of\ni don't know where i'm going with this\nokay so so you got to help me out here\nbut help me understand what what's\nappealed to you about\nthat like\nthe way that i dress yeah\noh um\nuh\ni\nwell i wear like i said now recently i\nwear more um i still wear some pretty\nlike neutral colors uh like\ngray black and and white but then i also\ni've started\nkind of branching out more and i have\nsome like blue and red and\num\ngreen and stuff like that um\nand\ni don't know i don't i don't really\nthink about it too much i think i just\npick what i think looks nice on me\nyeah so when when when you so yeah so\nlike when you like wear a dark color\nlet's say and i get that you're\nbranching out\num when you just like look in the mirror\nlike something about that\nlook feels right to you or like looks\ngood to you\nyou look great in dark colors by the way\nso we're not i'm not trying to make a\njudgment thing yeah oh that's okay um so\ni'm curious what would it feel like to\nwear like a pink shirt\nuh i do have like a i mean it's more\nlike a salmon colored shirt that i\nreally like\num it kind of just depends on\nwhat i feel like wearing that day\nwhat do you think makes you feel like\nwearing a salmon color versus a dark\ncolor\nuh\ni genuinely don't know it depends on\nwhat's clean\nwhat my hair looks like that day i guess\ntruly one of us yeah\nmy wardrobe choice is dependent on body\nodor more than anything else\nand what will will you know make me\nstink the least truly one of us yeah you\nknow and i you know if i if i need to\napologize for that line of questioning\nplease let me know i wasn't intending to\nbe offensive or anything but\ni don't know why i've never asked anyone\nthat before on stream but there's just\nsomething about your appearance that\nfeels very\nintentional to me\ni have a very\ni have an aesthetic that i feel like is\nespecially when you see me with\neverything i feel like that is true um\nso i don't i'm not offended by that at\nall yeah\nand i guess we don't really understand\nwhat the origin of that aesthetic is\nwhich may be like a philosophically\nfoolish question right what's the origin\nof aesthetics we don't know\num\nso here's kind of what i'm\nnoticing so\nokay let's take a step back any\nquestions for me by the way\nno okay um anything that you think we\nshould talk more about\nuh i'm not sure\nokay\nso um i'm gonna try to just lay a couple\nthings out and then i'm curious kind of\nwhat you think about them and maybe we\ncan\nkind of shift a little bit into more of\nlike a\nactive phase as opposed to an\ninvestigative phase does that sound okay\nto you\nmaybe it's inappropriate maybe it's\npremature so let's take you for example\nyou're ann you're a twitch streamer you\nschool noobs on the internet you love\nstar wars\nyou know you're branching out in\ndifferent colors it's all good you're it\nsounds like you're capable of forming\nlike healthy and close relationships\nyou're really close to your mom you've\ncome to some kind of dynamic equilibrium\nwith your dad\ni get the sense that he loves you a lot\ni get the sense that you love him a lot\ni get the sense that he's done a lot of\nstuff that maybe you could blame him for\nmaybe at some point you did but i don't\nreally get the sense that you're holding\non to a ton of resentment\num and that hopefully you've forgiven\nhim or something there may be more to do\nthere because when i asked the question\nabout your dad you're like how long do\nyou have so maybe there's more to\nexplore there but uh maybe that's for a\ntherapist\nso you came here with some sort of\nquestion of okay i'm trying to form\nrelationships with people and it's like\nhard and then\nand so here's the challenge is that like\nyou're interested in forming\nrelationships you want you know true\nfriends you had good friends in the past\nthey kind of\nsloughed off over time\nand now you're in the world of streamers\nwhere like a lot of friendships are\ntransactional so here we are\nis that fair to say\nso what do we do about this so first\nthing that i kind of want to point out\nto you is that you do seem to have a\nsort of like fatalistic approach to\nthings and i don't get the sense that\nyou have a what's the grin\ni just i just like the word fatalistic\nthere we go\nyeah that's because you know\nyeah so like you have like kind of a\nfatalistic attitude right so and what i\nmean by that is that\nyour ability to exert change on the in\nthe external world that's been written\ndown on my notebook for a while i've\njust been waiting for the right\nchoice\ntoss it out\nbut like if you just think about how you\nview this it's sort of like the\ncircumstances are what they are and i\ndon't really know like how to fit into\nor make this work in this situation\nyeah that's the approach that i hear\ni also hear like a sense of being an\noutsider like you know you're uh you're\nyou're a female streamer on twitch but\nyou're kind of different from the other\nfemale streamers on twitch is that fair\nto say\nmaybe\ni think there's a i mean there's a lot\nof women on twitch now which is great so\ni definitely\nalign with\ni've got to align with some of them you\nknow absolutely so maybe that's not\nunique\nmaybe that's a little bit of an\nincorrect statement or an unfair\nstatement on my part\ni'm sort of noticing though that there's\nlike a theme of being an outsider right\nso like that you can't really connect to\npeople that there's a so if i think\nabout you know outsider like literally\nwhat determines whether someone is\ninside or outside\nwhat's the dividing line between inside\nor outside\nright\nit's a wall right like it's like\nliterally a wall and we're kind of\ntalking about like sort of like i'm\nnoticing this theme emerge and so this\nis where you got to be careful right\nbecause sometimes like people who are\ntrained like i am in therapy like we\nlove to find connections\nand we love to be like oh this is the\nanswer i figured it all out i'd say that\nhalf the time we're just wrong we just\nreally don't know and it's just all in\nour head and we love to come up with\ncomplicated theories\nbut what i am really noticing with you\nand is is a strong theme of like not\nbeing able to connect with people and\nthat starts with like literally going to\na family event and not speaking the\nlanguage and then recognizing oh like\nthe reason that i can't connect is\nbecause my dad didn't teach me korean\nand so what i'm kind of imagining is\nlike i'm imagining five-year-old anne\nwho's trying to understand how does the\nworld work what are the rules of the\ngame and you correctly conclude that my\nability to connect with these people is\ndetermined by whether my dad teaches me\nkorean or not is that fair for that\nfive-year-old to conclude\ni mean yeah partially it wasn't just the\nlanguage thing but it was also the fact\nthat like\ni think even as a kid you can sense when\nadults are like side-eyeing you you know\nabsolutely that's i think a big part of\nit too\nyeah so i think that there's like a fear\nof judgment\nyeah which is what i'm hearing there\nwhich is also like so i'm noticing there\nare a couple of things which seem to be\npopping up\nso the first is that it's kind of like\nthere's nothing you can do about the\nadults that sideline you right or side\neye you like you can't do anything about\nthat so that there's like a sense of of\nyou know actually like a lack of agency\nis what i'd call it that you don't\nactually have\nit's not within\nyou know the scope of what you can\ncontrol to like change those people\nright and we sort of hear that thinking\nwhich is logical by the way i'm not\nsaying it's incorrect in any way shape\nor form\nin terms of like even when i ask you\nlike okay what if you take one step\nforward\nand then like you pull back a little bit\nlike what's the alternative you can say\nlike i take one step forward i take two\nsteps forward i take three steps forward\nthey start moving away and i keep\nchasing after them like that's just dumb\nright\nand and once again i'm kind of noticing\nthat that\nirrespective of what you're doing like\nwhat your mind jumps to is like what's\nthe scenario where i can't win despite\nmy efforts\ndo you see that\nyeah\nso and i think this is what i refer to\nas like fatalistic so there's kind of\ni'm noticing\nso i'm going to share a concept with you\nthat's that's locus of control\nso generally speaking when i try to help\npeople solve their problems\nwhat i tend to find is that\nthere are two places that they think\ncontrol comes from one is an internal\nlocus of control one is an external\nlocus of control so for example\nlet's say i apply for a job and i don't\nget the job people will come to two\nconclusions they'll say oh i should have\nprepared better i should have dressed\nbetter i could have answered these\nquestions better they'll adopt an\ninternal locus of control where change\nin the world is controlled by like what\nby them\nother people will adopt an external\nlocus of control like oh i didn't get\nthe job because the company is racist i\ndidn't get the job because the manager\ndidn't like me i didn't get the job\nbecause of factors outside of i didn't\nget the job because of the economy\nright factors outside of them and\ngenerally speaking people will do both\nbut in a given issue they'll sort of\ndefault to the locus of control being in\none place does that make sense yeah\nand so what i've often times found is\nthe best way to help people is to switch\ntheir locus of control because you tend\nto be doing everything for the locus of\ncontrol that you think is\nimportant right so if someone says oh i\ndidn't get the job because of the\neconomy that may be a factual statement\nlike the economy may suck but it still\nremains that that company was hiring and\nthey probably hired someone it's just\nthat someone wasn't you\nso in spite of the world being rigged\nagainst you if you switch your locus of\ncontrol it changes the way that you\napproach the problem and actually helps\nthose people land the job\nokay does that make sense\nyes\nokay\nso when it comes to you\ni think you're right that genuinely\nspeaking it's an uphill battle to make\nfriends with streamers it's a problem\nthat all of y'all face and i think it\ncomes down to what you were kind of\nsaying about the transactional\nrelationship of streaming because you\nnever know like\nyou know\nwhat's personal and what's professional\nin terms of when we hang out like if\nwe're gonna go to dinner is that gonna\nbe posted on instagram and then i'm\ngonna get you're gonna get likes because\noh look ann is going to dinner with like\nwhoever right and then people like oh\nyay you know\nevery aspect of what like because if i'm\nfriends with someone and i go out to\nsome somewhere and we like take a\npicture of ourselves and i post it on my\ninstagram there's no there's no\nprofessional impact there right right\nso i'm noticing that that's absolutely\ntrue but i do think that you in\nparticular may be like sensitive\nto the consequences of dual\nrelationships\nand where i kind of get that from is\nlike\nyour dad hitting you up for cash\nyou know like what do you think about\nthat\nwhat do i think about my dad asking me\nfor money yeah\num\nwell i i think when it happens\nor when it happened when i was in\ncollege\ni'm not sure i mean i just i remember\ntrying to figure out you know how much\nmoney\ndoes he need and like how much am i\ncapable of giving on my you know like\ncollege student salary and like paying\nmy rent and everything\nuh\ni i honestly i don't remember having\nvery like strong feelings about it\nbut that could just be because of how\nmuch time it's been i just don't really\nremember but whatever it was i don't\nfeel like it left like a super strong\nimpression yeah i don't think it did\nleave a super strong impression so let\nme ask you a question slightly\ndifferently what impact do you think it\nhas on a father father-daughter\nrelationship if a father asks a daughter\nfor money\nuh well i mean\ni i\ni never really\nhave felt like my dad\nand i i mean we've never had a very\nclose relationship you know we've never\nbeen like a\nfather-daughter you know he kind of\nfeels like\nthis older\nmale stranger you know\num and it's like i know i'm related to\nhim and i know he's my dad but\nhe's still kind of\ni mean he's he's not my father really\nsure so let me ask you a question in a\ndifferent way\nright so\nif an older male stranger hit you up for\ncash would you give it to him\nuh\ni mean a stranger no but because he's my\ndad i did\nright so like\nthat's\ni don't know how to say this but exactly\nright so here you are not really having\na father-daughter relationship\nbut like you're giving him money because\nhe's your dad\nright right so like that feels very like\nmuddy in terms of like what the\nrelationship is\ndoes that make sense\nright i mean yeah like one of us is\nsupposed to be\nmore of an adult than the other well i\nmean i i know it sounds kind of weird\nbut let's let's change things up a\nlittle bit how would you feel giving\nyour mom money\nno problem exactly because she's\nactually your mom\nright\nright so it's kind of interesting\nbecause\non the one hand sure the adult is\nsupposed to be the the adult but at the\nsame time like family comes first and\nthey're actually scenarios where you\nknow kids help parents out financially\nall the time like i help my mom out like\nevery week\nand and that's fine because i'm grown up\nnow and she took care of me and i took\ncare of her and like it's kind of weird\nbut but it was sort of like almost like\na trick question in a sense because\nthere's sort of like a right answer\nwhich is that adults aren't supposed to\nhit up their kids for money but what i'm\nkind of noticing is that like\nyou know\nthere's like a dual relationship there\nit's kind of weird like it's it feels\nkind of transactional to me it feels\nlike he's not really playing the part of\nyour dad but you're giving like he's\ngetting the benefits of sort of like\nbeing your dad\nright\ni don't think that the goal here is to\ndig into your relationship with your dad\nthe reason i'm highlighting this is\nbecause i think it\nwhen you have someone who grows up in\nthis sort of situation\nit shapes and informs the way that they\nview relationships\ni see okay\nhow do you feel with some of the\nquestions that i'm asking you right now\nuh\n[Music]\ni mean i feel fine i'm i'm\nlike just processing what you're saying\ni i haven't really thought about any of\nthat for a while like i said it's many\nyears in the past and so i don't like\nthink about it on a daily basis sure but\nit makes sense to me that that um\nlike you said kind of informs the way\nthat i\nview relationships and the way that i\ntry to\nmake friends with people\nyeah so i and i think that like one of\nthe most so the i've noticed this\npattern where\nwhen when people grow up with like some\nof these kinds of relationships and i\nknow in a sense you didn't really grow\nup with a relationship with your dad i'm\nnot saying it's all like daddy issues\nbut that i'm kind of noticing that there\nhave been multiple times\nthroughout your life where\nyou felt like an outsider right in\nmarching band or in college like you are\nnever like the tier one friend there's\nlike the tier one friends and they're\nlike the tier two friends it's like if\nwe're going to party queue and we've got\nfive spots\ni'm going to ask these four people first\nand if none of them are available here's\nthe invite and you want to play some you\nwant to play some cs go\nright\nand you're why are you smiling now\nbecause that is how it feels yeah it's\nlike we've got four spots and\nuh\ni mean\nant's available i guess you know like\nit's not like i'm the first person that\npeople are like let's invite anne and i\ni have like i would say i have\nprobably a couple friends that i would\nbe their first choice um\nand i appreciate\nthat and i appreciate them um\nand i think it's just like my my kind of\nsearch for more of that right i want to\nbe\ncloser with more people but i definitely\nfeel like\nthe\nnot one of the first\nchoices\nso my point is that when i hear that\nfeeling\nthat you're sort of experiencing i'm\nactually hearing that it pre-dates\nstreaming\nso this is where locus of control\nbecomes important because if you\ndiagnose this problem is exclusively a\nstream or problem\nthen your sol\nbecause you can't change the streaming\nworld but what i'm sort of noticing is\nthat this actually pre-dates streaming\nthat you've learned how to be protective\nof yourself\nand even erect a wall because i'm\nguessing that when you sort of figured\nout that they weren't\nyou weren't the first person that they\nthought of to invite to study\nyou didn't chase them very far\nwhat do you think about that\nthat's i mean yeah that sounds accurate\nright and the reason you didn't chase\nthem is because it hurts\nit hurts to like\nwant something from someone\nand\nthem not give it to you\nso there's an easy way to protect\nyourself from that hurt which is don't\nwant it from them\nright don't chase him in the first place\nand if you want to get like if you want\nto get super classic about it you could\nsay that this is all starts with your\ndad\nand that you may have made overtures\nwith him and like he didn't like meet\nyou halfway you saw him two or three\ntimes a year so you learned early on to\nbe like i'm not gonna get anything there\nand so you've normalized this is the\nother thing that i see i see that you've\nnormalized a lot of like what seems like\npainful stuff\nso it doesn't feel painful anymore like\nwhen everyone else on the internet\nthinks that what you go through is\nterrible and you are a hero for standing\nup to injustice and you're like it's my\neveryday that's [ __ ] sad\nyeah\nhow does it feel to hear me say that\nuh\nagain that feels very accurate i think i\ndo that a lot and i actually just talked\nwith my partner about that recently\nwhere i i think i take\nemotions and i put them into a box and\nthen i put that box away and then\ni just don't bother with it again so yep\ni don't know if this is this is probably\nthe poorest prediction i'll ever make on\nstream\nbut i i gotta wonder whether your choice\nto wear a salmon shirt has to do with\nthe way that you're feeling on a\nparticular day\nwhether the emotions are in the box or\nnot in the box\nyeah\ni have no idea\nbut i i gotta wonder\nand so i\ni don't know how else to say the sand\nbut i think if you wanna form\nconnections with people\nyou ha\nso the last point that i'll sort of say\nis i think a lot of the wall is being\nunderstood\nand that i think that you have like an\ninternal experience of the world that\nyou don't advertise to the outside world\nlike what do you think about that\nyeah i mean i've always been even\neven with streaming and before streaming\ni would say i'm like a pretty\nprivate person um\nand definitely like\ni don't know if it was that i\nlearned to be\nlearned to operate solo\nbecause of what we're talking about or\nif i like have always been like that you\nknow it's like chicken and egg i don't\nknow which one came first\nbut i have kind of always operated on my\nown\nso here's how i would understand that so\ni think that generally speaking the\nbrain uses the tool that works the best\nand then that tool improves with\npractice\nso what we tend to find in people is\nthat when they have a strength\nthat's what they default to to get them\nthrough difficult situations which then\nin turn in turn improves that strength\nmakes it adaptable so like emotional\nsuppression putting up walls\nand like putting your emotions in a box\nor like absolutely adaptations\num the the challenge is that over time\nthey can become maladaptive because now\nwhat's happened is like you're a\none-trick pony like i'm a s i i'm a\nspawn camping sniper rifling noob right\nand and you get to that way because like\nthat's what let you in\nand then\nat the same time though like you don't\nknow how to use like an smg or like\nwhatever as a result\nso i i think what what i'm really\nhearing is that you probably had you\nhave a natural tendency to be like kind\nof closed off right\nand that that worked well for you and so\nyou like got better and better at it you\nleveled it up and leveled it up and\nleveled it up and then you kind of find\nyourself in this weird situation where\nit's kind of like hard to connect with\npeople\nyeah\nso then the question becomes\nwhat do you do about it\nwhat do you think\nuh\nwell i would guess\nif we go back to the analogy of taking a\nstep towards someone um\ndon't take the step back and to just\nkeep\ntrying i guess\nyeah how do you think that's gonna work\ni'm gonna annoy someone into telling me\nto [ __ ] off probably or or maybe it'll\nwork out i don't know\nokay so very good so like in a sense so\nhere's the key thing i think you're\nmissing it's not about the action it's\nabout the worry so when you take a step\nforward what happens in your mind\nuh\ni think like okay i tried and now we see\nwhat they do\nand then if they don't do anything i'm\nlike okay goodbye\nso at that point\nis when i have to be like i'll try again\nright\nyeah so like i even you even said it you\nsaid it beautifully because you're like\nafter you take a step forward what\nhappens then you said well either they\nget annoyed with me and tell me to they\nget so annoyed with me until\nuntil they tell me to [ __ ] off which\nlike think about that for a second okay\nso out of all of the possibilities of\nwhat the reactions are\nwhat is the one that you default to\nit's kind of an overreaction they\nprobably would just ignore me i guess\nbut but why do you default there like do\nyou see what your mind is predicting is\nthe responses to taking this step\nforward\nyeah\nit's like why the hell does your mind\ndefault to they get annoyed with me so\nannoyed with me that they tell me to\n[ __ ] off like why is that the\ndefault response\nyeah or they ignore me and it's you're\nnot dumb for having that default\nresponse like there's a damn good reason\nwhy your mind comes up with an answer so\nif i ask you what kind of games you play\nyour mind comes up with fps why does\nyour mind say fps it's because it's like\nwhat you play it's been your experience\nit's what you do it's what the how the\nworld works what color is your hair it's\nblackish\ndark gray\nyou know so so your mind generates\nthings\nthat\nare based on your experience and i think\nthe real tricky thing here is that\nyou know when you take a step forward\ntowards someone your mind is worried\nabout their response that's what's\nactually preventing you\nthat's the wall\nbecause if you're worried about how\nthey're they're gonna respond what are\nyou gonna do how does that worry shape\nyou it's not a rhetorical question i'm\ncurious like what do you what do you do\nwhen i'm worried about people not\nresponding to me yeah or finding you\nannoying and telling you to go away\nuh\ni i i think that just i mean encourages\nme to\nnot try\nlike you said it's like i've kind of\nlearned how to deal with my worry in\nthis one way and so\ni just keep building up that same\nskill essentially right\nso i think it's kind of tricky because\nnow now what we get is sort of like a\npersonal\ntendency that is particularly poorly\nsuited for your social environment\nbecause at the end of the day streamers\nare [ __ ] flaky\nand so when you have someone who's\nworried about chasing after people and\nannoying them which by the way i would\nbet money there's a story somewhere\nthere about like\nyou're like hey can you guys invite me\nto study next time and they were like\nsure and then they didn't do it and then\nlike\nlike you i think you've made overtures\nin the past and they didn't work out for\nyou\nright\num or romantic relationships is another\nplace that you can kind of explore that\nor parental anyway so i i don't think\nthat you're\nand you sound very competent capable and\nintrospective to me and i think you've\nlearned\nhow to manage this stuff for a reason\nso i think like when you take a step\nforward towards someone and your mind\nworries it actually causes you as you\nsaid to pull back there's not actually a\nwall\nit ends up looking like a wall and\nfeeling like a wall but it isn't a wall\nand i would even go as far as to say\nthat there are opportunities for you to\nconnect to other people but it's your\nconcern about how they're they're gonna\nrespond that causes you to like slow\nplay it right like you're one of these\npeople that\nif you get to the highest tier if you\ngrind\nrep\nwith the faction of ammunition\nand you ever get to the grand master\ntear you are friends for life\npeople like your mom and your brother\nand sister but grinding up until that\nway is like really hard\nyeah because i suspect that you pull\nback from people or even don't let\npeople in\nyeah\nwhat do you think\nyeah i think that\ni think i've always thought of it as a\nwall and the way you're describing it i\nfeel like it's more like a like i'm\nattached to a bungee cord that like ex\nextends to a certain point and then\nsnaps back like straight away and\nbeautiful image because here's what i'd\nask you\nif you take three or four steps towards\nsomeone how quickly do you retreat when\nthey don't meet you\nwhere you're at\nquickly yeah very quickly right just\nlike a bungee cord the deeper into\nunknown territory you go the harder it\nis and the quicker you are to pull back\nand so now we get to like this idea of\nconnection\nso it may be things like you you know\ni'm not saying that you should like\nhammer paying people to play games with\nyou on a daily basis right because\nthat's [ __ ] annoying but i also\nsuspect that when you do have some of\nthese interactions\nthat there are moments where you can be\nmore like emotionally vulnerable with\nthem or emotionally connected with them\nand that you're kind of concerned about\nlike how they're gonna respond\nwhat do you think about that\nabout\nlike telling people yeah directly that\nthat's how i feel\nyeah like like i think that there are\ntimes where you'll feel a particular way\nbut you\nyou know\nyour like brain is going to be like you\ndon't want to be too much for them\nyeah does that tell you those kinds of\nthoughts\nyeah like i mean i said a couple times\nat the beginning that i don't want to be\noverbearing and i know like i know that\npeople are busy um and there's plenty of\ntimes that i've like gotten a message\nfrom someone and i i\ntake a couple days to respond or\nsomething\num so i completely understand the\nyou know the schedule it's just\num\ni don't know it's i think it's like a\nthing where i see a lot of other\nstreamers is like the cool kids and\ni'm not the cool kid\nat least you know that's how i see\nmyself and so i don't want to be\ni don't i just want to bother people\nwhat do you think about\nthis is hard\nwhy do you think you're bothering people\num\nbecause\nthey're\nbusy\nwith\nall their other\nlike things that they're doing in their\nlives like streamers are very busy\num\nand\nokay i said that i feel like uh\nif i if i try to like make friends with\npeople who\nare like also happen to be streamers um\nand let's say we start to kind of become\nfriends uh\nand then if i\nif i see\nwith regularity then i'm not being\ninvited to do stuff then to me i\ntranslate that as\nthey\nare being polite but they don't actually\nwant to like play play games with me or\nlike be friends with me they're just\nbeing polite because\nlike if you want to be friends with\nsomeone you\ninvite them to play games or you invite\nthem to hang out and so i i i translate\nthat as like if you're if you're not\nlike if i invite you to do something and\nyou decline because you have something\nelse going on or whatever and then you\ndon't ask me to do stuff then it's kind\nof like\ni feel like it's they're trying to\nreject you but nicely you know\nsure so for me i'm like i'm gonna take\nthe hint and just leave you alone\nyeah\nokay so and i'm gonna try\nnow we get into the territory that i'm\nthe worst at but i'm gonna give it a\nshot okay okay so now what i'd like to\ndo is actually be very very concrete\nwith you and see if we can actually\nadjust some of the way that you\ncommunicate with people i don't know if\nthis is actually going to work or not\nall right so you got to take this with\nso here's the challenge\nso if you reach out to someone and they\ndon't respond back and then you reach\nout to them and they don't respond back\nyou don't want to reach out to them a\nthird time you're like i get the hint\ni'm taking the hand right i'm not going\nto force you into telling me that you\ndon't want to hang out with me right\nright\nso that makes sense and i think is not\nan effective style of communicating to\nbuild relationships\nright\nso\nhere's a question for example that i'll\nask people when\nso i have a i have a\nfriend of mine so i sometimes play d d\nand sometimes do other things like i\nwatch esports tournaments and stuff like\nthat and i've got like my group of nerd\nfriends right so we like get together on\noccasion and we'll like we'll play d d\nor we'll like watch esports stuff or\nwhatever and then there's some people at\nthe fringe of the group\nthat i have a relationship with them and\nthen like i'll invite them to the stuff\nand they always turn me down\nso i don't know what the deal is but\nsometimes what i found is actually\nreally really useful is like a specific\nquestion which is hey i've i've noticed\nthat you know i've invited you a couple\nof times it seems like you've been busy\nno big deal i was just curious do you\nwant me to invite you in the future\nlike being a little bit explicit instead\nof inferring into their communication\nbecause for them to not respond to you\nthere's like a differential diagnosis\nthere are all these kinds of reasons one\nis that i'm not really too interested in\nann\nshe's my second choice in terms of\nhanging out with so i would say yes\nif i had no one else better to hang out\nwith you know there's like that whole\nline of thinking which you've got to be\ncareful about and i think that\nexperience of yours actually shapes the\nway that you interpret their response\nwhich is that oh i don't want to bother\nthem which is kind of weird because if\nyou're bothering someone it implies to\nme like a sense of like lower value in\nyou\ndoes that make sense\nyeah and i've i've actually done that\nbefore with someone where i've said like\nuh\nlike thank you for inviting me all the\ntime and i genuinely have just had\nschedule conflicts the past couple of\ntimes but i do want to hang out with you\nso like please keep inviting me so like\ni've said that to other people before\nand how did that work for you\ngood yeah i mean they were like okay\nwe'll just keep inviting you even if\nyou're\nyou know busy a lot of the time yeah so\ni think that's that's a beautiful\nexample right so like it's so\nconsiderate when you let people know hey\nit's not that i like don't want to hang\nout with you it's like genuinely like\nlife is busy right now\nyeah so\nand and i think that's like a very good\nthing for you to do so i'd say like\nlet's kind of take a step back and let\nme think through this for a second so\nfirst is to acknowledge that you know if\nyou're barking up the tree that is a\nstreamer for friendship i think it's\ngonna like you've got the deck stacked\nagainst you so mentally like you have to\nprepare yourself for a higher amount of\nrejection than normal or higher amount\nof radio silence i think is probably\nwhat it's really going to be which radio\nsilence can be deafening and hard to\ndeal with and sometimes even harder than\nrejection\nthe problem with radio silence is that\nwe as human beings and social\nrelationships when we experience radio\nsilence we\nproject our prior experiences to\ninterpret that radio silence\ndoes that make sense yeah so i think\nthat any time you get a neutral response\nfor from someone you're gonna they're\ngonna fill it in with like\nwhatever their insecurities are\num\nso just be aware of that first of all\nsecondly i would also consider being a\nlittle bit more explicit in your\ncommunication to like play games and\nhang out because i think there are i\ndon't know how this is going to work by\nthe way so you got to take this with a\ngrain of salt um but i i would say like\nyou know if you want to hang out with a\nstreamer and you're actually like want\nto be friends be a little bit explicit\nthat hey like do like\nyou know i really i think you're a cool\nperson i'd love to hang out\ni'm not interested in like collabing or\nanything like that i just you know\nlooking to make friends\nwhat do you think about saying something\nlike that\num\nyeah i guess it depends on\nlike how i feel like the relationship\nalready is with someone because i\nwouldn't of course you would i don't\nthink it you wouldn't want to do that\nwith just like some random person that\nthat's like the first time you're trying\nto talk to them right you know but it's\njust after like\ntrying to establish something with\nsomeone it's just it's really hard when\nyou're just like i don't really care\nabout collabing but the only time\nthat\nwe can like hang out would be on stream\nso it's like kind of\nis a collab you know\num\nso i feel like that's also one of the\nthings that is tough because it's\nuh\nlike you can't hang out with people in\nperson very easily um\neither so\nthat's a good point so that's why i'm\nsaying like i don't really know if some\nof the suggestions i'm going to make\nmake are going to land or not\nbut i think the main goal anne is to\nclarify the dual relationship\nso like you know when you're engaging\nwith someone to be as is explicit i\ndon't know what this practically looks\nlike but try to be explicit with them\nabout what you're looking for from the\nrelationship\nyou know there's a certain amount of\nlike let's talk about romantic\nrelationships for example like there's a\ncertain amount of flirtation and\nyou know not leaving things unsaid that\ncan make things kind of exciting but at\nthe end of the day the successful\nrelationships are the ones that like\nwhere people usually at some point\nexplicitly make their intentions known\nand the relationships that get confusing\nand messed up are the ones where people\nare like ambiguous and\nyou know half-assing it and like not\nsure what they want\nso i i don't know what do you think that\nwould look like in terms of the kinds of\nfriendships that you want to pursue\nuh i'm not sure how to answer that i\nguess\nneither am i so i think this is a\nproblem that actually all streamers are\nfacing right now\nis that they don't i haven't heard\nanyone really like talk about figuring\nout how to determine with a stream or\nrelationship like how to draw the\nboundaries and set expectations about\nwhat people are looking for from the\nrelationship\nyeah so i think that's a genuine\nchallenge with your situation and one\nthat you can't affect what streamers do\nbut i do wonder a little bit about\nwhether you can adjust your language to\nsomehow compensate for like the\ncircumstances\nyeah\num but i i think if there isn't a clear\nway to engage with streamers i'm just\nnot sure\nthis i'd say then what you should really\nfocus on is your internal sense of worry\nwhen you start engaging in a\nrelationship and be a little bit careful\nabout letting that dictate when you pull\nback\nyeah\nyeah i agree i think it's\nit's like an internal thing that i have\nto kind of overcome that i\ni cut the cord pretty quickly when i\nfeel like\ni'm not sure if i'm gonna be annoying\npeople or or whatever\nand\nso yeah i think the challenge for me is\ngoing to be just not\nimmediately cutting and running\nyep\ni think i think spot on so very\npractically like what that's going to\nlook like in is you're going to do one\nor two things and then there's going to\nbe a voice in your head that's going to\ntell you hey these people think i'm\nannoying\nyou can still you're still allowed to\ncut the cord if you want to\nbut just be aware that you're doing it\nand say to yourself like\nin this moment i'm actually like this\njust feels too uncomfortable for me and\ni just don't want to take this chance\ni'd rather not be friends at all than\ntake the chance that i'm annoying them\nyeah\num\nyeah oh i'm sorry i was just gonna say\nthat at least then it's like um\nyou have a i guess more of like a finite\nanswer rather than just being like\ni don't know i don't know what happened\nand i just made this up maybe how how do\nyou have a finite answer\ni i meant like if you try to talk to\nsomeone and you're more explicit about\nkind of what you're\nhoping to achieve and they i mean\ni i mean i when you talk about it it's\nlike i have a hard time imagining\nsomeone just being like\ndon't talk to me again you know but like\nimagine if there was some equivalent of\nof that where they're just like no\nthat's cool like i don't really want to\nbe friends or something like that um\nso\nvery good yeah yeah no so\nthe the cool thing actually and this is\nkind of bizarre but the really cool\nthing is that human beings are evolving\nto say that\nso people didn't used to say that but\nnow like i've seen this sometimes like\npeople will post on like you know tinder\nscreenshots and stuff where people will\nactually say like hey i'm you know i\nthink you're a wonderful person i just\ndidn't feel a spark and i'm not\ninterested in seeing you again that\nthat kind of communication is becoming\nmore common because of the nature of\nhuman interactions has never required\nthat before\nnow it does and i think the interesting\nthing is that even if someone told you\nthat hey i'm not interested in pursuing\na friendship with you i think you would\nfeel okay with that i think you would\nactually like it like you'd be fine with\nthat it may hurt a little bit but the\nclosure and the simplicity of it i think\ncan be very like therapeutic\nyeah\nyeah i agree\nso and the last thing that i'd say is\nthat you know just just look a as i can\ni don't know how else to say that any\nexperience with meditation by the way\nuh no\nokay\nso um i can maybe try to teach you\nsomething in a little bit but\nyou know i would say that this thing is\ngonna like arise in your mind i don't\nknow how else to put that does that make\nsense to you\num\nno okay so i want you to imagine this\npeople find me annoying\nyou remember the days of pop-up ads\nit's gonna be like a pop-up ad like\nyou're going about your business you're\ndoing your thing you're browsing the web\nyou know looking at 4chan or whatever\nand then like there are going to be\nparticular circumstances\nin which\nthis thing is going to pop up in your\nhead and you're going to feel like\nyou're annoying someone you're going to\nfeel like the\noutsider and i want you to just really\nprepare for that pop-up ad and just\nremember that just like a pop-up ad\njust because there's something on your\nscreen that's telling you\nthat there are hot singles in your area\nand you can take this this pill for\npenis enlargement doesn't actually make\nit real right that's coming from the\npop-up ad it's not actually coming from\nlike\nreality\nright\nright and so the really confusing thing\nabout our human psychology is that our\nmind tells us things that are based on\nlike our experience which is sort of\nlike our cookie history\nright and so like that then we get\ntargeted with the kinds of things that\npop up but that's just based on our\nhistory of what we've been browsing on\nthe internet\ni remember one of my friends worked at\nit and he was he was he worked at it in\nit at a university and he was saying\nthat like you know like one of the\nprofessors complained that like they\nwere getting all these like ads for like\ngay pornography\nand then and then the it dude was like\nthe ads are based on your browser\nso he's like he's like there's it's not\na virus bro it's just\nthe internet just knows what you're\nlooking at yeah\nand so in that way our mind also\npopulates our head with the trash that\nwe've engaged in in the past\nyeah\nand so i know it's kind of hard but as\nyou notice that pop-up come up if you\nuntil you know it's a pop-up like you\njust think it's what's there right it's\nwhat your mind tells you it feels real\nbut just look for it wait for it it's\ngonna pop out it's like it's trying to\nyou know spawn camp you\nand it's gonna be waiting download\nbuttons when you're trying to download\nsomething and there's like the real\ndownload button and then there's like 12\nfake download buttons and you have to\nlike figure out which one is the right\none absolutely and just like that your\nmind is going to be feeding you lots of\ncrap that is not actually accurate\nso and hopefully as you notice you can\nnot give into a little bit and like take\none step forward maybe have a\nconversation with someone maybe kind of\ntry\nand then my hope is that you'll actually\nbe able to form better connections over\ntime\nthoughts questions\nthat sounds good that all makes a lot of\nsense\ni'm having trouble yeah\ni was just gonna say i feel like i the\nthere's a lot of like analogies that\nwe've used today that i haven't like\nreally thought of in the past so i think\nthat gives me a lot to think about like\nwhat\nuh well the thing\nthat i\ni default to assuming that people are\ngonna be annoyed by me and so i i back\noff the fact that i back off really\nquickly at all\num and that i don't\nsuper like i i feel like i'm trying but\ni think that i am\nkind of half trying you know i'm not\nlike really trying uh yeah\nand the fact that a lot of that can be\nit's\ni mean like i'm aware that it's\nsomething that's been a part of my life\neven before streaming um so i know that\nit's not directly as a result of\nstreaming it's just something that is\nreally exacerbated by the circumstances\nof streaming\num\nso yeah\nand that's that was a beautiful summary\nuh the one thing i'd kind of add i\nreally love the way you said you'd have\ntrying so here's what i think you're\ndoing i think you're trying really hard\nin one direction and not trying it all\nin like another direction\nthat also sounds like something that i\ndo yes yes\nyeah right so you're willing to like\nthere's a certain game that you feel\nvery comfortable playing and you're like\na try hard there but i'm not going to\ntouch this other way right right\ni'm really happy to hear by the way that\nyou're it sounds like you're in a\nrelationship and i hope that's going\nvery well for you um\nyou know be a little bit careful about\nsome of these things popping up there\nlike you may occasionally get a pop-up\nad but my sense is that once you get to\na certain tier of intimacy with someone\nthe pop-up ad stop\nmaybe\ndo you get pop-up ads with your mom\nuh no\nsometimes\nso\nit's not the same kind of bad but\ni wonder if my mom loves me i'm not sure\nso\ni think a lot of it may have to do with\nyour intrinsic sense of value so when\nyou feel valued and loved by someone i\nsuspect the pop-up ads will stop\nbut\nanyway\num\nnow i have to you want to talk a little\nbit about meditation or you have any\nquestions before we kind of potentially\ndo meditation and wind down anything\nelse you want to talk about\nuh nope\ni think we're good\num so\nmeditation yay\nyou don't have to say yes you're allowed\nto say no i've never not really like\ndone it before so i don't know\ni don't know how to say yes or no\nbecause i'm not sure what it is\nokay\ni mean i understand the general concept\nof meditation but\nnever tried it before\nokay let me think for a second\nokay so i'd like to teach you a\nmeditative practice that will ideally\nhelp you with your relationships\nokay\nokay\nthis meditation practice i'm afraid will\nbe a little bit memish\nbecause it's going to be it's going to\ninvolve\nyeah it's gonna be a little bit mimic so\nyou're welcome to decline or ask for\nsomething else okay\nokay so in the theory of meditation\nthere's this idea that we have these\ndifferent chakras chakras which are\ncenters of energy\nand that different chakras within our\nbody govern like different attributes of\nour life\nso scientifically if we look at the\nscience of meditation we know that\nmeditation has a lot of scientific\nbenefits like reduces our cortisol level\nyou know reduces our stress\nreduces our experience of anxiety and\ndepression and all that kind of stuff\nthere's really and people have looked\nso\ni would say that there is evidence that\nchakras do not exist\nso we're not saying that we don't know\nwe're saying that people have looked for\nit and have failed to find it\nwith me\nat the same time i'd like to teach you a\npractice that is\ngoverns your swadhisthana chakra which\nis the chakra that supposedly governs\nrelationships\nokay okay the mean part of this is that\nyour swadhisthana chakra is located\nhalfway between your navel and your\nperineum\nokay the perennium is also colloqui you\nknow what the perennium is\nnope okay so it's like the point halfway\nbetween um\nthe\nscrotum and the anus\nthe taint if it were i know it's kind of\nneemish so the sweat is actually located\nat like your pubic symphysis which is\nlike the point where your two hips your\nhip bones kind of meet so for men it's\nkind of like the top it's kind of like\nwhere your bladder is basically\nokay\nso what's kind of meamish about this is\nlike that you know that region is close\nto the genitals and so everyone's like\nhahaha genitals\nso\num for\nyou know you can kind of view the\nswadhisthana chakra is kind of like\nwhere\num yeah so it's your pubic symphysis so\nit's kind of like at the top of your\nin the center at the top of your hips\nlike we think about hips on the outside\nbut the hips actually wrap around and\nthey like touch in the center okay\nso what we're gonna do\nis\nactually breathe into that part of your\nbody\nit's just a very introductory practice\nokay so i want you to sit up straight\nyou okay doing this or is that too weird\nfor you like too close to them\nall right so i want you to think for a\nsecond about you know when you really\nneed to pee like where do you feel that\nokay right so you know like the general\nregion of the body\nso i'm going to ask you to sit up\nstraight\nand close your eyes\nokay\nand slowly start to breathe in through\nyour nose\nokay\nand so notice that cool air entering\nyour nose you'll feel the coolness in\nyour in your nose\nmaybe in the back of your throat\nmaybe in the pit of your throat\nyou'll feel your lungs expand\nyou can go ahead and exhale whenever you\nknow whenever you're ready to\nthen as you breathe in again\nyou can kind of notice like your solar\nplexus area will also kind of maybe feel\ncool or expand a little bit\nand then let the breath go down into the\nabdomen\ngo ahead and exhale\nand now when you breathe in i want you\nto push your belly button out so expand\nyour abdomen let your diaphragm come\ndown\nand then breathe out and contract your\nabdomen\nand let's just focus on abdominal\nbreathing for just a second so deep\nbreath in push the belly out\nand exhale let the belly relax\npull your navel in towards your spine\nif people are watching y'all can do this\ntoo\nsome of the imagery may not work for you\nit's not a big deal you don't have to\ntry to do everything just go with the\ngeneral direction of it\nand now take a deep breath in follow the\nbreath all the way from the nose down\ninto the throat expanding the chest into\nthe abdomen\nand then exhale and notice the warmth of\nthe return flow\nand take a few moments to breathe\nexpanding the abdomen with each breath\ncontracting the abdomen\nand now what i want you to do is notice\nthat when you expand the abdomen\nthere's kind of like a bottom\npart of the abdomen\nwhich is going to be kind of right at\nyour pubic synthesis synthesis\nas you breathe in\nyou're going to kind of feel almost like\na slight pressure around your bladder\ndo you feel that\nso i want you to focus on the spot where\nyou feel that pressure\nand then as you exhale you'll notice a\nrelaxation in the area of your bladder\nthat that pressure kind of gets relieved\nand gets loosened\nand kind of like\ni don't know how to say this but when\nyou breathe in it's like you're pushing\nsomething into that\nand when you breathe out you're creating\na vacuum and letting it kind of come out\ndoes that make sense at all\nyeah i think so\ncool that means you're doing it right\nso now what i want you to\njust practice sort of\npushing the breath into that part of\nyour body and letting the breath come\nout of that body and it's almost like\nyou're\nbringing like cool nourishing air\nand that you're letting out like heat\nand toxicity and like like pent up\nenergy\nso kind of breathe\ninto the pubic bone and out of the pubic\nbone breathe into the bladder or out of\nthe bladder call it whatever you want to\nand now i want you to think about the\nsensation\nof bothering people\nand recognize that there are times where\nyour mind is telling you\noh this person doesn't like you\nor that this person wouldn't enjoy\nhanging out with you\nor other kinds of negative thoughts\nand imagine that all those negative\nthoughts are kind of stored\nin that\nwhere the pubic symphysis is in the\nswathe of chakra and that with each\nbreath\nyou're bringing stuff into that and\nletting those kind of like negative\nthoughts out\nand we're gonna do three more breaths\nnice and slow\nand now let yourself relax\nkind of shrug your shoulders a little\nbit move around\nwhen you're ready you can kind of open\nyour eyes\nokay\nwhat was that like\nuh it was a bit weird at first because\ni'm aware that i'm on camera um\nbut it was\nrelaxing\nwhere did the sense of weirdness go\nuh\ni i just left i guess\nyes\nso that is the purpose of meditation\nright so when you say weirdness like\nyour mind may have been thinking oh what\ndo people think about me\nright oh no so the weirdness i would\neven argue as a pop-up\nbeing concerned about the opinions of\nothers and so the purpose of this\npractice is to do away with those kinds\nof thoughts\nright so as you the next time you feel\nthe bungee cord pulling you back\ni'd practice this maybe three times a\nweek or\npotentially even every day but i'd shoot\nfor three times a week five minutes\nthat's it\nokay 15 minutes a week\nand then if you the next time you kind\nof engage in a social interaction and\nyou feel that pop-up coming up\nclose your eyes for a second breathe\ninto the bladder\nand then\ntry to like\nact in a slightly different way\nokay\ncool\ncool\nthoughts questions\nconclusions\num\nwell we kind of summarized before i feel\nlike there's a lot of analogies that\nwill help me\nthink about\nhow i'm interacting with people and\nwhat i what i default to and how i can\num\nkind of change that\nyeah and\nthe meditation thing is\num\nsomething i i'll try\num\ni'm not like i'm not against it it's\njust something that i've never really\ndone sure\nso\nyou don't have to do it yeah but it's\njust something that i offer and if you\nknow if it works for you great if it\ndoesn't work for you no big deal and now\nthe next time some someone asks you have\nyou ever tried meditation you can say\nyeah i've tried it once\nyeah\nit's okay\nyou know so that's the point right so\nit's it's not to commit to anything or\nanything like that it's just it's just\ngive it a shot\nit works for you great if not no biggie\nall right\nokay do you want to just tell us one\nlast time and where we can kind of find\nyou and and what you are known for and\nwhat people can expect if they come to\nyour channel\nyeah um\nwell i stream on twitch so it's\ntwitch.tv ammunition and\ni play a lot of fps games i\nplay sometimes some variety games but\nusually i'm playing escape from tarkov\nor rainbow six siege stuff like that\num\ni you use the term even keeled which i\nthink is a good way to describe me um so\nthat's probably what you can expect\nand yeah i stream all the time so well\nthank you so much for coming in i hope\nthis has been helpful good luck to you\nthank you\nand uh yeah thanks a lot for coming\ngreat yeah thank you so much take care\nbye\nyou"
