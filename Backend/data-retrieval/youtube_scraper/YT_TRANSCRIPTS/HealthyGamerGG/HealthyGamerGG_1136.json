    "transcript": "because some of them will just i mean\nyou guys will hopefully realize this too\nthat you just don't have to live like\nthis it's like\nyou know like you can fix this like you\ncan feel\nbetter on a day-to-day basis like the\nsun can be a little bit brighter you can\nbe a little bit happier\nyou can just enjoy things more\nso about one year ago we had a pretty\nsignificant suicide in the gaming\ncommunity and i think we've had\nover the last year um we've had\na lot of suicides in our community i\nthink some of them are not quite as\nadvertised as others\nand so i thought what we would do today\nis try to just do like a quick\num sort of like educational segment to\nhelp us understand\nsuicide so today what i'd like to talk\nto you guys about is just sort of like a\nquick\nalmost like lecture about you know who\ncommits suicide\nwhy people commit suicide how like\nwhat's the process or what we\nwhat do we understand about the how of\nsuicide and what you can do\neither for yourself or for someone else\nso we're just going to answer these four\nbasic questions and the reason that i\nthink that this\nthis kind of lecture is important is if\nyou look at medicine\num it's advancing and we're winning as a\nprofession\nso if you look at for example like hiv\nso hiv used to be a terminal\nillness and now people with hiv have a\nregular life expectancy\nwe've all but eliminated some kinds of\ncancer\num at least in terms of people who get\nthe appropriate treatment so for example\nthere are certain kinds of like b-cell\nlymphomas if i'm remembering correctly\nthat we now have targeted antibodies\nthat we have really good\noutcomes for we also have for example\nlike hpv vaccines which have done a huge\njob at sort of reducing or almost\neliminating cervical cancer at least in\ncountries that have access to the\nvaccine so we're\nlike we're doing good like i don't know\nif you guys get this but like modern\nmedicine is pretty dope like do you guys\nunderstand that\nif my heart is busted i can like\nliterally get a heart from someone else\nand we can transplant into my body and\nthen i can continue to live a relatively\nnormal life\nif my kidneys are busted i can literally\nlike\ntransplant someone else's kidney into my\nkidney\ni mean into my body and then like i can\nlive off of that kidney\nso like medical science has advanced in\nan amazing rate and it is like really\nawesome so we're seeing\ngenerally speaking improved outcomes\nin most disciplines or just about every\ndiscipline of medicine\nthe one place where we don't seem to be\ndoing a good job and in fact arguably\nthings are getting worse\nis in the mental health realm so we are\nsort of losing the war\nagainst mental illness and so if we look\nat suicide for example like suicides\nhave not\nappreciably gone down in fact if i\nremember correctly they've sort of gone\nup over time\num it's also kind of staggering because\nuh you know if you look at statistics on\nsuicide like 80\nof suicides are men if i'm remembering\ncorrectly i think that's kind of a\nballpark figure\ndepending on what source you kind of go\nto it'll\nyou know that the numbers may look a\nlittle bit different depending on\nwhether you're looking at the world\nor a particular country developed\ncountries versus developing countries\nhave slightly different um statistics\naround that\nand and so we're we're losing this war\nand so like\ni don't really know that just given the\nnature of the human mind i don't know\nthat we're gonna have like a\npharmaceutical\nrevelation like we're not gonna have\nsome kind of pharmaceutical discovery i\nmean if we do that would be great\nthat you're gonna take a pill and it\nwill\ncure you of your suicidality like we\ncertainly have medications that\nimprove outcomes for people with\ndepression who you know may be somewhat\nprotective against suicidality\nso we'll talk a little bit about that\nbut as we'll see today the reasons that\npeople kill themselves may not all be\nsolved\nby medication so the reason that i'd\nlike to talk to you guys about suicide\ntoday is because i think that like the\nfirst step in\nin fighting this war is actually like\neducation right so like kind of like sun\ntzu says\nyou know you have to know your enemy in\norder to win and so my hope today is to\neducate\nour community and whoever's listening\nwhoever watches this down the road\nto help you understand a little bit\nabout like okay who\nkills themselves why do they kill\nthemselves how do they kill themselves\nand what can we do about it\nwhether you are dealing with suicidal\nthoughts or you're not dealing with\nsuicide or a friend is dealing with\nsuicidal thoughts\nfurthermore we're going to tackle a\ncouple of different myths around\nsuicidality\nand some of these i think are quite\ndangerous so it's really more of like a\npublic health educational approach\nand i will urge you for the first but\nnot the last time that if you're dealing\nwith suicidal thoughts\nyou should really go see a licensed\nprofessional and get help\nand we'll deal with some of the reasons\nwhy people don't and why it's a bad idea\nto listen to the part of your mind that\nsays\nbasically i haven't killed myself yet so\ni can manage it\nwhich we'll we'll look at some\ninteresting data around that\nso the first question is who kills\nthemselves so what we what we can sort\nof discover like i sort of mentioned if\nyou actually look at suicidal attempts\nwhat you discover is that more women\narguably\nattempt suicide than men\nbut it turns out that when we kind of\nwhen we're sort of looking at it\nattempts what we sort of discover is\nthat not all suicide\nlooking behavior is actually like\nintended to be suicidal\nso sometimes for example like i've had\npatients that will\ntake a bunch of pills and then will\nproceed to call me\nor they will call a friend and they'll\nsay hey i just took a bunch of pills\nso it's sort of a suicide attempt but\nthere's sort of like this kind of\nidea that like sometimes it's people are\nlooking you know to say goodbye but\nsometimes they're actually like\nit's a little bit more provocative and\nit's sort of almost like a cry for help\nyou're sort of demonstrating to people\nthat um you really need help and you're\nwilling to go to drastic measures but at\nthe same time you're not like\nyou're not using your full faculty\nof thinking to actually commit suicide\nand so what we sort of discover is that\nwhen you really tunnel down into the\nresearch there are a lot of parasuicidal\nbehaviors\nso things like cutting or self-injurious\nbehavior\nor like threats for suicide attempts\nthat it seems like statistically\nwe're not entirely sure about you know\nwhat's happening where but\nwomen seem to make more suicide attempts\nand men\nseem to actually kill themselves uh more\noften\nand so the about four out of five\nsuicides are men so sometimes\nas we look at the research what we sort\nof like look at so one hypothesis is\nthat the manner of suicide sort of\ndetermines\nis responsible for that statistic so for\nexample women are more likely to\ntry to commit suicide by taking pills\nand men are more likely to commit\nsuicide by using a firearm\nand if we just sort of think about that\nfrom a medical standpoint if someone\ntries to commit them\ncommit suicide via pills the window to\nsave that person is far\nlarger than someone who you know uses a\ngun because like\nyou know it's just gg depending so some\npeople have argued that because of the\nvariance in attempts\nuh that's what sort of alters the\nstatistic in my experience i think it's\na little bit more complicated than that\nand i think that um as we get to the\nreasons of why\npeople commit suicide i suspect that\nat least in my clinical experience and i\nalso suspect that epidemiologically that\nmen uh there are more men who are more\nserious about taking their life\nthan women on average it doesn't mean\nthat women aren't serious about taking\ntheir life i'm just saying that\nthat there seems to be something\ndifferent there which i think is sort of\nborne out in the statistics\ncould it have to do with just the manner\nand psychologically both genders are\nexactly the same it's completely\npossible\nin fact there's good evidence for that\ntheory my experience as a clinician and\nwe'll get to the kind of the how\nor sorry the why and we'll sort of see\nthat suicidality also is not necessarily\ndue to psychopathology which i know\nsounds weird but it's not all\nsuicidality is due to mental illness\nso let's talk a little bit more about\nwho commits suicide so\num you know men tend to be more of four\nout of five\nare men i think we're seeing a rise in\nsuicidality like\nin younger populations as well just as\nother kind of interesting examples one\nis that there's a black box warning\non antidepressant medications called\nserotonin selective serotonin reuptake\ninhibitors\nthat for the few weeks after you start\ntaking an ssri\nadolescents especially are more likely\nto commit suicide\nthere's something really interesting\nthere that like if you kind of think\nabout you know the mind of someone who\nmay be suicidal you may have thoughts\nbut if you're severely depressed\nyour low energy level and your like lack\nof motivation\ncombined with the suicidal thoughts is\nalmost like a protective mechanism\nthat you may want to kill yourself but\nyou have such low energy or your\nmotivation is so low\nthat you never actually like get up off\nyour ass and and make an attempt\nso there's a really interesting\nphenomenon that's been observed when you\nactually treat someone with depression\nwith\nor treat adolescents with depression\nwith medication\nis that there's actually a temporary\nspike in\nsuicidal behavior which suggests that\nand the best\nkind of theory that i've heard is that\nthis the spike actually happens because\nyou're sort of dealing with that\nmotivation first\nso people actually get a little bit more\nenergy but the suicidal thoughts take\nlonger to treat\nand so if if you really have to be\ncareful if you're a prescriber and\nyou're prescribing antidepressants to\nsomeone in adolescence to really watch\nthem carefully for like two weeks\nand then it seems like the effect kind\nof goes away in terms of like then it\nreally starts treating the suicidal\nthoughts and depression as well\nbut it's a really interesting thing for\nyou guys to be aware of that if you're\nstarting antidepressant medication\nso here's kind of like the first kind of\nlike psa um\nis be a little bit careful because there\nmay be something weird going on in the\nsuicidal thoughts i don't know if they\nbecome stronger\nor you may actually feel like a little\nbit more motivated to act on them which\nis kind of weird\nright so it seems like younger people\ntend to be\ncommitting suicide more often so it\nseems to be getting slightly worse\nand it seems to be men more than women\nso when we look at something like the\ngamer community we don't really have\na good idea about you know who\nlike what the suicide rate is\nspecifically in our community at least i\nhaven't seen\nany convincing research in that we don't\nreally know but hopefully over time\nwe'll learn more about that and we'll\nfigure out how to intervene a little bit\nbetter so now what i'd like to do is\nactually screen share for a minute\nand we have an awesome one of our\ncoaches\nis actually a suicide researcher and so\nhe's done awesome work as a coach\nand kind of does research on the side so\nhe put together an awesome presentation\nto educate our coaches and what i'd love\nto do is\num you know he goes by james\nso um james has done an awesome job of\nputting this together this presentation\nand so what i'd love to do is share like\none or two slides from the presentation\nwith y'all\nokay so let's kind of start with this\nso suicide is the 10th leading cause of\ndeath in the united states with about 50\n000 people dying by suicide i think this\nnumber has actually gone up a little bit\nsince the presentation was made\num this is the key thing so our pop you\nknow\nwhen we talk about like who the audience\nis of people who uh who\nwatch stream and who healthy gamer\nreaches we tend to reach people who are\nlike\nyou know hopefully like 13 to 40 for the\nmost part but a lot of parents watch our\nstream now too\nso when we think about you know what is\nthe most likely thing that will kill you\ni think it is probably accidents is\nnumber one the leading cause of death\nand number two is suicide and so\num if we kind of look at like\nthis is an important graphic so trends\nin the leading cause of death\nover time in the usa so this is usa\nspecific\nwhat we kind of see is like i was saying\nearlier like we're we're winning the war\nagainst like stroke heart disease cancer\nbut suicide i don't know if this is\nactually this isn't interesting\ni'd have to double check this this\nparticular statistic whether this is a\n33\nincrease because the causes of death of\nother things are\ngetting better so the percentage\nincrease is higher but generally\nspeaking i think\nsuicide has been increasing over time\nwhich i feel pretty confident to say\nthe next thing that we're going to kind\nof talk about so that's sort of like who\ncommits suicide so\nyou know we need to be really careful\nabout that in this community\nthe next thing that i want to talk about\nis why people commit suicide\nso this is going to sound kind of weird\nbut there are many reasons why people\ncommit suicide that may not necessarily\nhave to do with psychopathology okay\nso um there's a great paper by\na guy named malzberger so malzberger is\na\nis like a great suicide researcher and\nso if you actually sit down and you talk\nto people who\nare um have tried to commit suicide or\nthinking about suicide and i've sort of\ndefinitely noticed this as a clinician\nwhat you're what i was really shocked to\ndiscover is that\nthe reasons are not necessarily mental\nillness so we sort of think about mental\nillness as the number one cause of\nsuicide and i think that that's probably\nreasonable\nand yet i know it sounds kind of weird\nbut like\npsychopathology isn't necessarily the\nonly cause of suicide\nand what i mean by that is that if you\nactually talk to people what you'll find\nis there are all kinds of\nreasons um and some of them have to do\nwith like\nyou know self-worth which is that like\nan organic brain disease i'm not really\nsure\nsometimes suicide has to do with like\nnot having\na way out for lack of a better term\nand so suicide sort of serves as an\nescape\nand so i think we have to be really\ncareful about sort of\nassuming any suicidal behavior is the\nhas a root cause of mental illness\nbecause if we misdiagnose that\nif we assume that everything is mental\nillness what i think we\nend up doing is like we're gonna leave\nout\nand we're gonna lose sight of a lot of\nimportant reasons why people kill\nthemselves\nso as a clinician what i'd like to do is\nkind of start with this idea okay so the\nfirst thing to understand is that\nsuicidality\nis not an illness it's actually a\nsymptom\nokay and so what what do i mean by that\nso if we think about like\nfever for example like fever is not an\nillness\nit's actually a symptom that can have\nall kinds of different root causes\nso if i have a fever maybe i have a\nlymphoma\nmaybe i have a cold maybe i have covid\nmaybe i have lupus there are many\ndifferent diseases that lead to fever\nand so in that way if i have suicidal\nthoughts\nthere are actually many different\nreasons why i may feel suicidal\nso for example one reason is\npsychopathology\nso what we mean by this is we know that\nthere are some kinds of mental illnesses\nright so we know that there are things\nlike\ndepression or actually this is\nincorrect major depressive disorder is\nis better\nright so there's like major depressive\ndisorder bipolar disorder\nwe also know that you have like things\nlike addictions\nsometimes you'll have things like\nschizophrenia right\nand these are like arguably biological\norganic malfunctions in your brain\nthat lead to a malfunction in your brain\nthat sort of allows you to create\nsuicidal thoughts and potentially act on\nsuicidal thoughts\nbut if you kind of uh another really\ninteresting thing and i don't know that\nthis mechanism is the same\nso um so like this is what malzberger\ncause\ncalls loss of the ideal self-state\nor broken life dream\nso some people will have like let's say\nlike\naspirations right so they say like i\nwant to be this or i want to be this\nand something will happen in their life\nwhere they feel like their\nlife has become broken and irreparable\nand if you really talk to them so a lot\nof people will assume\nthat this thing from a mechanism\nstandpoint\nis the same as major depressive disorder\nbut as a clinician what i oftentimes\nfind is people who have major depressive\ndisorder will become depressed\neven when nothing is wrong so especially\nwhen i've worked with people who are\nlike uh\nsuicidal sometimes i don't actually like\ndo they qualify as depressed absolutely\nbut sometimes they don't really respond\nto medications and what it really is is\nlike\ntheir perception of life has become so\nshattered\nthat they don't believe it is worth\nliving now the this further gets\ncomplicated that sometimes\nthis can actually trigger a major\ndepressive episode\nbut it's not that the major depressive\nepisode is like shattering your\ni mean it can actually go both ways but\ni know it sounds kind of weird but in my\nexperience sometimes as someone like so\nfor example\num you know i was working with a\nparticular person\nwho was accused of um sexual\nharassment and was essentially like\nfired from their law firm or put on\nsuspension\nand they were it was sort of a situation\nwhere it was kind of like guilty until\nproven innocent they were sort of\nostracized\nit turned out that um you know they\ndidn't actually do anything\ninappropriate\nbut their life was sort of shattered\nlike they lost their job like\nthey had lost the respect of their\ncolleagues and so like this person's\nlife had fallen apart i don't know that\nthis was actually the result\nof an organic brain disease i don't know\nthat it was\nthe cause was like a neurochemical\nimbalance\nbut it really feels to me more like a\nbroken life dream\nthere are other kinds of weird\npsychoanalytic sort of stuff\nbut other other causes of suicidality\nare going to be\nsudden defense breakdown so what do we\nmean by this\nso sometimes we have something called\nchronic suicidality\nand what that means is like i have um\nyou know i think about killing myself\nand even though i think about killing\nmyself there are a lot of things like a\nlot of people so suicidal thoughts are\nremarkably common i think something\nbetween like 10 and 30 percent of the\npopulation\nhas suicidal thoughts or has had\nsuicidal thoughts at some point\nand so if we kind of think about it\nsuicidality is actually like a balance\nbetween\npro-suicidal factors and\nanti-suicidal factors and we'll get to\nthat in a second in terms of how we deal\nwith suicidality\nbut sometimes what can happen is that\nlike you know you've got this balance\nbetween like reasons that you don't want\nto live and reasons that you do want to\nlive\nand sometimes that defense mechanism\none of the things that you kind of use\nto hold the suicidality at bay\nkind of falls apart so like a good\nexample of this that i'll sort of use is\nlike alcohol usage\nso you know in your normal mind\nyou can kind of keep the suicidality at\nbay\nbut in some situations if you like alter\nyou know your state of consciousness\nthrough alcohol\nor some other disinhibiting substance\nthe suicidality can kind of break\nthrough\nand then you can sort of result you know\ncan it can end in an attempt\nso i know it sounds kind of weird it's\nnot necessarily like you know you can\nsay that addiction is like an organic\ndisease\nbut alcohol in a temporary sense this\nisn't an addiction this is just like\ni can be not addicted to alcohol use\nsome mind-altering substance\nand then it causes something in my\npsychology that\nkeeps the suicide at bay from like fall\nit kind of breaks down my defense\nmechanism and i end up acting\nso and i know it sounds kind of weird\nbut like just you don't have to have\nmajor depressive disorder to have\nsuicidal thoughts\nso the next thing to kind of think about\nin terms of why people commit suicide is\nanger turned against the self so if we\nthink about why people commit suicide\nsome people\nfind their life to be like intolerable\nright like\nthis life is not worth living anymore\nand sometimes if you go back to freud's\nearliest theories\non depression i believe it was freud\nalthough i may be misquoting here\num who basically said that he he sort of\ndiscovered that depression\nis anger turned against the self so like\ninstead of being angry at the outside\nworld like if you look at the mind of a\ndepressed person they're actually like\nangry towards themselves so if i get\nfired from my job\ninstead of blaming my boss for being\nincompetent or feeling threatened by my\ncompetence\nwhich may actually be the reason that i\ngot fired i what i'll end up doing is\nblaming myself oh i'm so bad\ni'm so dumb i can't do anything properly\nlike i deserve to be fired\nand so sometimes in the case of um\nsuicidality what we actually see is\nanger turned against the self with like\nrevengeful intent\nso what this means is like sometimes we\nhave these ideas about ourselves that\nare like\nlike i i am such a bad person\nthat like you almost want to like punish\nyourself for being so bad\nand this it's kind of really toxic but\nif i really it's kind of sad but when i\nwork with some people\nwhat i really find is that when people\nhave like this self-loathing and\nself-hatred\nthey don't believe they deserve to get\nbetter\nthey actually believe that they like\ndeserve punishment\nand so sometimes suicidality is not\nabout like\noh woe is me i no longer have a life to\nlive sometimes it's not like a sudden\nbreakdown of a defense mechanism of like\na dynamic equilibrium\nand sometimes what it is is like i\ndeserve to kill myself\nbecause a pos like me doesn't deserve to\nbe alive\nand so what we can kind of see is as you\ntalk as i've talked to people\nyou know i'll have someone like in the\nmdd camp who for example is like\nhas a happy marriage and has a stable\njob\nand has like kids who love them and\ndespite\nall of these positive factors they'll\nstill be suicidal\nand so when i kind of see that like\nthat's when i really think about like\nthis seems to me like a malfunction this\nis not supposed to be the way\nthat this person this person isn't\nsupposed to feel that way\nright so if we think about a brain\nmalfunction\nit's like your brain is not thinking the\nway that it's supposed to be\nbut as you actually spend time with\npeople who are suicidal what you\nactually find is that some people\nlike it sort of makes sense that they're\nsuicidal because their life really has\nfallen apart\nthey really don't believe that there's\nanything worth living for\nand we may call that depression they may\nget diagnosed with depression but i\ndon't know that this is like an\norganic brain disease does it sort of a\nchicken or egg situation or like the\nbrain and our psychology is complicated\nand sometimes it's not that like life\nisn't worth living\nso this is sort of like life isn't\nworth living okay\nand then over here what we have is i\ndon't\ndeserve to live you guys see how like\nthese thoughts are different\nand over here is like and over here what\nwe have is\ni'm suicidal despite\nlife being great right and so these are\nvery different buckets\nin terms of what goes on in the mind of\nthe person and then like\nyou know as we kind of go to other\noptions so like here's another kind of\nlike psychological manifestation\num but i'd kind of say that another one\nis\nintolerance\nof humiliation shame\nor envy and and so like this is kind of\ni know it sounds kind of weird but like\nthis is sort of like a different bucket\nif you think about the\nemotion that's at play for these\ndifferent buckets like sometimes it's\nlike hopelessness\nso if we look at the first column okay\nso if we look at this column\nokay this is transmitting so if you look\nat this column this is hopelessness\nthis is going to be anger and this is\ngoing to be shame\nokay so these are going to be like a\nlittle bit different\nso the point here is that when we're\nthinking about you know why\npeople want to kill themselves um\nyou know in what is the nature of their\nsuicidality what we sort of\narrive at is that they're actually like\na number of different reasons which are\nnot all the same\nso this isn't just like one thing it's\nnot just mental illness that is causing\nsuicidality\nand i think that it's the assumption\nthat like you know ssris will cure\nsuicidality\nthat despite the fact that our ssri\nprescriptions have gone through the roof\nover the last couple of decades\nsuicidal suicidality is still increasing\nwhich sort of naturally\nimplies that um you know we're missing\nsomething here\nlike as a profession and as a society\nwe're\nmissing something really important about\nsuicidality so if people are kind of\ncurious this is the the paper that i'm\npulling from which is\na sort of an an examination of a\nparticular narcissistic\nperson and different causes um and it's\nby\nuh elsa ronningstam igor weinberg and\num john maltzberger i think all these\nmaybe all three of these people are at\nharvard that's number two\nokay so we started off by talking about\nyou know who is vulnerable to suicide\nthe second thing is like why people kill\nthemselves and what we sort of discover\nin terms of why people kill themselves\nis that there's actually like a lot of\ndifferent reasons so sometimes it's\nhopelessness sometimes it's anger\nsometimes it's shame and humiliation and\nsome degree of envy\nand i think each of these causes as we\nsort of think about the differential\ndiagnosis of suicidality what we sort of\nresult in\nis that different causes are going to\nhave different solutions so once again\nif you're\nfeeling like killing yourself or you\nhave suicidal thoughts this is like\nreason number two to go see a mental\nhealth professional right like\nunderstand that these things when you\nwork with someone can be addressed\nso for the person who's hopeless you\nknow\nwe can sort of help them build a life\ndream again\nso a big part of what we try to do here\nat healthygamer is like help people\nconstruct a life\nthat is worth living our original goal\nwas like helping people with video game\naddiction\nand what we sort of found is the\nantidote to video game addiction is\nhaving a life that is worth living\nin the real world and so as you build\nthat\nlife which can absolutely be done right\nit takes time and it takes effort and\nyou may feel hopeless\nbut like with a little bit of help and\nwith a little bit of an intention you\nwill be amazed at what you're capable of\nthe biggest thing about people who are\nhopeless is that they don't exert effort\nright and so you can even beat yourself\nup over that\nso there can be some amount of\nhopelessness there can be some amount of\nanger and self-hatred i don't deserve to\nlive i don't deserve to be happy\nand so that sort of has a different\nsolution as well in terms of like\nlearning how to gain compassion\nright so sometimes we'll teach like\nparticular meditation techniques that\ncan help people like\nlearn how to love yourself and learn how\nto forgive yourself\nthere's a lot of stuff about this and in\none of the dr k guides\num around you know anahat chakra\nmeditations and things like that\nso like there are different antidotes to\nthat there's also things like shame and\nenvy which those tend to be some of the\nhardest things to deal with like\nthey require a lot of self-reflection\nbecause it's sort of like\nyou know there's some amount of you know\nhopelessness is something that\nwe want to fix anger is something that\nwe want to replace\nwith compassion like we sort of want to\ndo that but when i deal with people who\nare like really envious\nand suicide at the suicidal because\nsomeone else's life is like better than\ntheirs\nthat's really really hard to deal with\nit requires a lot of self-reflection\nbecause it's like people hold on to\ntheir envy\nso much more so now what we're going to\ndo is sort of talk a little bit about\num how people go about killing\nthemselves and understanding\nsort of like a clinical approach to like\nsuicide risk assessment\nand a couple of common myths that i want\nyou guys to be careful about\nso the first thing to understand is that\npsychiatrists are notoriously bad\nat predicting whether someone is going\nto kill themselves or not\nin fact overwhelming amounts of research\nhave shown i know this is kind of\nshocking\nthat psychiatrists cannot see the future\nand so we don't really know whether\nsomeone is going to kill themselves or\nnot\nand so the question sort of becomes well\nlike why is that\nand this is where like research gets to\nbe really really interesting\nwe have this kind of idea that when\nsomeone wants to kill themselves\nwhat they do is put their affairs in\norder okay\nthere are signs absolutely we're gonna\nget to those\nso like they put their affairs in order\nbecause what the media sort of says\nright like you like you settle all your\nthings you like\nyou know you make sure no one's in the\nhouse you write all your like suicide\nnotes and things like that\nbut it turns out that so this there's\nsort of this idea that like people kill\nthemselves like their suicidality kind\nof starts out here and then gradually\nover time it increases and increases\nincreases increases and when it gets to\nup here this is when you kill yourself\nso a lot of people feel reassured right\nthey kind of say like okay yeah i'm\nsuicidal but like\ni'm over here and since i'm over here\nit's okay i don't need to get help yet\nbecause i'm not up here\nand all know i need help when i start to\nfeel worse and things like that\nso there's sort of this myth that like\nsuicidality builds up over time and\npeople like\nmake a calculated decision to kill\nthemselves whereas if you look at the\ndata\nwhat you actually find is if we look at\nthe decision\nto make the most recent suicide attempt\nthe most common is that like you know i\ni don't know exactly\nwhat the y-axis is here it may be\num number of people so if you look at\nlike let's say this is like\n30 people who tried to kill themselves\nwhat you find is that 12 out of the 30\npeople\ndecided to make the attempt within one\nminute\nof the attempt um you know the vast\nmajority of people\ndecided within half an hour or\nwithin two hours to make the attempt so\nwhat we actually discover\num is that like most\nof the like attempts of suicide are\nactually\ndrastically impulsive decisions\nand what we actually see is out of this\nsample\nno one was planning suicide for more\nthan three days\nright so like what this means is that if\nyou guys have been struggling with\nsuicide\nfor a long period of time and you think\nto yourself\nlike oh like since i'm not planning it i\ndon't need to be worried\ni know it sounds kind of weird but you\nshould absolutely be worried because\nwhat the data actually tells us if you\ntake people who tried to commit suicide\nwho survived and you ask them this is\nhow the study was done\nwhen did you make the decision to kill\nyourself the vast majority was like\nwithin 60 seconds\nand so it this is a kind of another\nthing to kind of look at so if you look\nat suicidal ideation\nover time okay and this is\npeople like checking their suicidality\nlike four to eight hours apart\nwhat you basically see is that like the\nsuicidal score like\nis all over the place right so like this\nperson will be\nvery suicidal this moment and will be\nlike\nnot very suicidal four hours later\nso basically like the key takeaway here\nis that the first\nimportant myth to address is that like\nif you're telling yourself that because\nyou're not planning to kill yourself\nyou are safe that's something you need\nto be really careful about\nso what you want to really do is go see\na clinician either way\nlike if you've been dealing with\nsuicidal thoughts for a long time\ni know it sounds kind of scary but like\nyou just never know like\nwhen we come to that sudden defense\nbreakdown you never know when the stars\nwill align and like something will crack\nthrough and you will actually make an\nattempt\nso what i strongly encourage everyone to\ndo is just because you've been feeling\nthat way for a long time and nothing\nnothing has happened yet is not a\nsufficient reason\nto not get help so even if you feel like\nit hasn't\nif you have it under control if you feel\nlike\nyou know it hasn't happened yet so\nthere's a famous saying from the stock\nmarket you know like people in finance\nwill say that\nthe stock market past performance is not\nan indicator of future gains\nright and i think that's absolutely true\nof suicidality as well\nwhen we're thinking about performing\nlike a risk assessment\nyou know that's not really like that\nreassuring because we just know as\nclinicians that it's sort of like on a\ngiven day like something may happen in\nyour mind we don't really know\nand you can kind of result in an attempt\nso what do we look at as clinicians\nso we tend to look at means of access\nand this is why means of access is like\nthe number one protective thing\nso if we think about if we now\nunderstand that suicidality\nis impulsive and most people decide to\nkill themselves within 60 seconds of\nmaking the attempt\nhaving a gun at home is part of the\nreason why suicide is like so dang\nso much more likely if there's easy\naccess to an attempt\nif you have a gun at home if you if you\ncan like\nmake a decision and 60 seconds later you\ncan actually make the attempt if you\nhave the means to do that\nthat's incredibly dangerous so when i\nthink about like suicidal like\nlike probabilities what i really try to\nprotect against\nbecause remember like what we've got is\nlike your mind\nworking against you and your mind\nworking for you so as a clinician what i\nreally try to do is\nbuy time for my patients\nto like get their head above water and\nreach out for help\nand so if someone has to you know order\nsomething from the internet\nin that 24-hour period their suicidality\nwill fluctuate and they'll reach out to\nme\nand they'll say like hey i had like a\nreally scary like near miss\nand then we'll kind of talk about it\nwe'll help them through it and then they\nend up\ngenerally speaking doing well okay\nyou know when it comes to a risk\nassessment we think about things like\nand this is for you guys to understand\ntoo if you're thinking about a\nparticular\nthere's a big difference between it\nwould be okay\nso let's talk about like the scale of\nrisk okay\nso if i went to bed and i never woke up\ni would be fine with that\nthat's something that we call passive\nsuicidality it's not that you actually\nwant to die it's just sort of like\nyou know if you unplug things like you\nwould be okay with it\nthen they're sort of like i wish i went\nto bed and never woke up\nso at that point it's sort of like a\ndesire but it's not really like an\nintent\nright you're not trying to not wake up\nit's just like\nwe move from a passive suicidality to\nlike sort of a wish\nand then the next phase is like i\nactually don't want to wake up like i'm\ngoing to try to not wake up\nright so then we sort of cross over into\nintent which is like scarier\nand then like the scariest thing is like\nplans and then means\nso then like if you kind of think okay i\nam going to\nnot wake up in this particular way right\nso like once you start to think about a\nplan\nthat increases your risk of a bad\noutcome\nand then once that plan becomes\navailable that's when things get really\nscary\nand it's usually towards those like\nlater stages that we sort of really\nthink about things like hospitalization\nyou know\njust a another important reminder here\nthat like\nyou should not be using this risk\nassessment to determine\nwhether you should go see a clinician or\nnot if you were\nanywhere on this axis in any way you\nshould get a professional evaluation\nbecause we know how to ask questions\nthat will sort of help us figure out\nwhere you are\nbecause i know hopefully you guys if you\nguys have been watching the stream for a\nwhile\na big part of this problem is that\npeople don't\nknow what's in their mind right the\nwhole point of this stream if you think\nabout like how to benefit\nhow do people benefit from coming on\nstream watching stream\nit's that we help you understand the\nthings that you are not aware of in your\nmind\nand this is why i cannot urge you more\nstrongly that if you are\nanywhere on the spectrum or even not on\nthe spectrum\nit's completely reasonable and i urge\neach and every it doesn't\nnow that i think about it like just go\nget evaluated like even if you don't\nthink you need to\nright because you may be missing\nsomething the other reason to go get\nevaluator to reach out for treatment i\nknow this sounds like absolutely crazy\nlike it sounds absolutely crazy is that\nyou don't have to live\nin this mindset so for people who are\nchronically suicidal and think about\nnever waking up again\nyou don't have to live that way right so\nlike there\nare trained professionals whose job\nit is to help you through that stuff\nand this is the really crazy thing right\nis like our mind does this really stupid\nthing where it's like\nif i can't figure it out no one can\nfigure it out\nit's like i've been dealing with this\nfor a long time i've read so many books\ni've watched so many youtube videos\ni haven't figured it out so like i don't\nthink anyone can help me i'm unhelpable\nlike they can help other people but i\nhave tried really hard to figure this\nout and i haven't been able to so i\ndon't really think there's any point\nin seeing a professional be careful\nbecause if you have\nthat thought if you think there is no\npoint\nthat is actually you should do the exact\nopposite\nif you think there is no point to see a\nprofessional you should actually go see\na professional\nif you're on that axis you should\nabsolutely go see a professional\nright and when it we'll get to this in a\nsecond in terms of like what you can do\nor i guess we can so so now like moving\non to like point number four is like\nwhat do you do\nin this situation right so the answer is\ngonna be like sort of a broken record\nhere is like you go get help\nso like in the same way that if like if\nyou've got a flat tire like maybe you\nknow how to change it to yourself but if\nyou're let's say your engine is busted\nright like you go see a mechanic like\nthere are as as human beings we have a\nsociety we have a community and we have\na diversification\nof our labor pool like if you want to\neat\na burrito you go to a place where people\nknow how to make burritos or you make it\nyourself\nright if you wanna you know\nget if you've got covid like you go see\na medical doctor because they're gonna\nhelp you with covid\nyou go to the appropriate person for the\nappropriate thing and if you're dealing\nwith feelings of hopelessness or\nsuicidal thoughts the appropriate place\nto go because there's a profession of\npeople whose job it is\nand who's been spending years of their\nlife to train and get good at helping\nyou\nso you should go see them right and be\ncareful about all of the reasons\nthat your mind may populate and if your\nmind populates these reasons\nthen you should really like notice that\nand recognize that this could be\na process a part of like the negative\nprocess\nso if your mind is telling you there's\nno point if there's your mind is telling\nyou that you don't deserve help\nand that you deserve to feel this way\nbecause you're such a pos\nand you like you know like other people\ndeserve help but you don't deserve help\nlike that's like just recognize that and\nthen don't give\nin to that so i know this sounds kind of\nweird but i encourage all of you all to\nreally think about\nwhat is it that dictates your life do\nyou want to live a life that's based on\nlike what your emotions tell you and\ni know it sounds kind of weird but based\non what your thoughts tell you\nbecause the mind is just a thinking\nmachine it just generates thoughts it\ngenerates all kinds of random crap\nlike your mind will say like i want a\nburrito or it'll say like i want to play\ndota\nor like i don't want to do this and do\nyou want to listen\nto your mind so be careful right because\nsometimes you want to listen to your\nmind and sometimes you don't\nbut you don't want your mind and your\nemotions to be in control of you\nyou want to be in control of them\nso the last thing that i'm going to kind\nof talk about is like you know\nthis sentiment that you can handle it is\nnot a sufficient reason\nto this is not the last thing this is\nthe second last thing um\nthe sentiment that you can handle it is\nnot a sufficient reason\nto not see a mental health professional\nbecause it's just dangerous like\nstatistically it's very dangerous\nthe last thing that i'm going to talk a\nlittle bit about is like how to help\nsomeone\nelse who is dealing with suicidality\nso this is really tricky because a lot\nof times people in our community are\nlike\ngood people and you try to help other\npeople out which is awesome\nright like we love that it's part of the\nreason that we're here like our discord\nhas a lot of people that try to help\neach other out our subreddit has like\npeople posting about their problems\nand like other people post on the\nsubreddit to try to support them it's\nlike fantastic like\nit's really great it's beautiful we have\ncoaches who will also like you know are\nalso kind of trained in our\nmethodologies or\nspecifically there to help you out and\nand that seems to be going really well\num i had that i had the privilege of\ndropping into a\ncoaching group this morning and and it\nwas fun to really see like\nyou know how their how people are\nprogressing\nso the last thing is like you may have a\nfriend who is struggling with suicidal\nthoughts so the first thing to\nunderstand is that like\na lot of people feel like i don't know\nhow to help them or they won't let me\nhelp them which is\nsort of fair because it's i know it\nsounds kind of weird but like it's your\njob to be their friend not their doctor\nso a lot of times i notice that people\nget really kind of like frustrated or\nthey feel like really like stressed out\nbecause they're trying to\nfix this person's suicidality they're\ntrying to like because it's like so\nscary and you want to fix it\nbut you're just not trained or capable\nand so i know it sounds kind of weird\nbut like you shouldn't\nstress about that right so like fixing\nsomeone's suicidality\nis not your job as a friend you're not\ntrained in it so you i mean i guess you\ncan kind of give it a shot but like\ni wouldn't really recommend that really\nyour job\nas a friend is to be their friend and\nsupport them through it so this is where\nit's like\nencouraging them to actually get help\nbecause this is huge\nwhere a lot of times people won't want\nto get help for any number of reasons\nbecause they feel ashamed so like you\nknow you can kind of support them\nthrough that sometimes it's like\npractical like\nyou know their their mental is not\nfunctioning properly so that like they\njust don't have the wherewithal to like\nsit down and like\ncall around and try to find an\nappointment so you may be able to help\nwith that like it's kind of crazy but\nyou could ask them\nhey would you like my help in making an\nappointment like\nbecause 60 minutes from now like you\ncould have two appointments\nwe can make you know one phone call\nevery six minutes and we can make 10\nphone calls\nand out of those 10 phone calls it's\nthere's a decent chance that\n20 percent of the people like will have\navailability\nso it's going to be an uphill battle\nbecause in the mind of the depressed\nperson in the mind of the hopeless\nperson they may muster up the courage\nto make one phone call but when like you\nknow they don't get an appointment they\nkind of give up\nso as a friend you can help them get\ninto treatment you can encourage them to\nget into treatment you can support them\nto get into treatment\nthe second thing is don't underestimate\nthe power of being a friend\nso while you may not be able to actually\ntreat their suicidality and nor should\nyou try\ndon't underestimate the value of you\ncaring about them\nright because in their mind remember\nthat there's an equation between\npro-suicidal factors\nand anti-suicidal factors but like\none of the things that you're doing\nthere just by being their friend and\neven like i know it sounds kind of weird\nbut like\ni'll even say this as a psychiatrist\nlike it's one of the most powerful\nthings that i've like learned how to say\nlike when i'm dealing with patients with\ntrauma you know they'll tell me about\nall this terrible stuff\nthat happened to them and it's like\nwe're 10 years later\nand i can't do anything about that and\njust sharing\nhow much i wish i could like you know\nbecause really the\ncure for this person is for me to invent\na time machine go back in time and\nprotect\nthat from protect them from like that\never happening\nthat's the cure and i wish i could do\nthat but i can't\nand i'm actually completely powerless in\nthis situation to like\ntake that trauma away from them and\nbeing able to share that with them\nbecause like instead of like\nyou know you trying to help them you're\nactually joining them in the\nhopelessness\nand then what happens once you join them\nin the hopelessness is like\nboth the all are down there together\nand you all are hopeless together so at\nleast you can't change time you can't\nchange the past\nthey can't change the past either but at\nleast both they all are down there\nand like they're not shouldering that\npowerlessness\non their own you're helping them carry\nthat powerlessness\ntoo and so then once you kind of get\ndown there in there with them and you\nsay like hey i can't take this away from\nyou i wish i could\nbut i'd like to try to help you in some\nway what can we do\nwhat can we do and that's really the\nmost important question you can ask as a\nfriend\nright and then like meet them where\nthey're at and try to like help them\nlike if they if it's sort of like can i\nmake phone calls for you can i help you\nget into treatment like\nwhat can i do you know what is it that\nyou would like to do that you're not\nable to do\nand sometimes it's like other kinds of\nthings right it's like hey let's play\nlike\nlet's make phone calls for 30 minutes\nand then like we'll play like\none game of league and then like\ndepend after that like we'll take a\nbreak and we'll make phone calls for\nanother 30 minutes\nand then like we're gonna keep doing\nthat until you have\ntwo appointments and then we'll\nyou know there's a lot that you can do\nas a friend so remember that your dharma\nas their friend is to be their friend\nit's not to cure them\nand so be careful about what you're\ncapable of and what you're signing up\nfor\noh so let's actually start with kind of\na quick summary so today we're talking a\nlittle bit about suicidality\nand how to understand it so we started\noff by talking about\nyou know who suicide affects who has\nsuicidal thoughts\nkind of how that works we sort of talked\na little bit about how\nwomen may be more likely to attempt\nsuicide although men are more likely to\ncomplete suicide successfully\nabout 80 percent of suicides are men\nwe also talked a little bit about why\nthat statistic may be different\num so some of it may have to do with the\nmeans of suicidality like women are more\nlikely to try to overdose\nwhich means that the the window for\nmedical intervention in the window to\nsave that person's life\nis a lot greater than using something\nlike a gun which men are more likely to\nuse guns women are more likely to try\noverdose 5 pills\nso we talked a little bit about\nstatistics i suspect that there's more\nto it than that\ni think that there's something going on\nin terms of like why men are so much\nmore likely to kill themselves\nthe second thing that we kind of talked\na little bit about is like you know why\ndo\npeople kill themselves and as we sort of\nget into the\nthe mechanisms to recognize that\nsuicidality is a symptom\nit's not a diagnosis and that\nsuicidality is\nborn out of all kinds of psychopathology\nas well as potentially like\npsychological\ncomplexes that are not necessarily a\ndiscrete medical illness\nbrain malfunction or neurochemistry\nimbalance\nso we talked a little bit about diseases\nlike major depressive disorder bipolar\ndisorder addiction\nsometimes things like trauma but also\nthat when you actually sit down and talk\nto people with suicidality what you\ndiscover is that\nsometimes they want to kill themselves\nbecause they don't feel like life is\nworth living\nthat their dreams have been shattered\nand they don't really feel like they can\never put things together again\nsometimes people kill themselves because\nthey have an immense amount of\nself-hatred and it's not that\nlife can't be put back together it's\nthat they don't deserve to live a life\nthat is like put together\nsometimes it's born of things like envy\nand humiliation and shame\nand sometimes what can actually happen\nis is we always sort of have this war\ngoing on in our mind\nbetween reasons to live and reasons to\nnot live\nand sometimes we can have acute events\nthat will sort of shatter some of our\ndefense mechanisms that help keep us\nalive\nand sometimes i'll see this especially\nin the case of disinhibition through\nsubstances\nso like you know if you think about\nalcohol alcohol will make you more\nlikely to do things that you wouldn't do\nif you were like level-headed\nand suicidality includes that so like\nthe number of suicide attempts that i've\nseen\nunder the influence of alcohol is like\nstaggering it's like through the roof\nand then we sort of talked a little bit\nabout\nyou know how to think about suicidality\nso we talked a little bit about risk\nassessment\nand the main takeaway here is that\nregardless of how suicidal you've been\nif you've had those kinds of thoughts or\nyou're currently having those kinds of\nthoughts you should absolutely go get\nhelp it's a no-brainer\nand a big reason for that is one of the\nmost common myths behind suicide\nsuicide which is that people like really\nplan it out right it's like weeks and\nweeks of careful planning and i'm gonna\ndo this and\nsettle my affairs in order whereas if\nyou look at the research\nat least in one study no one planned\nmore than three days\nand like the vast majority like 50 or\nmore 60\n70 80 percent of people made the\ndecision within two hours\nand about 30 of the people made the\ndecision within 60 seconds so the reason\nyou should go get help is because\nyou never know when your mind is going\nto change and the last thing that we\ntalked a little bit about is okay like\nso what do we do about it right\nif you're struggling with these thoughts\nlike the short answer is get help\nrecognize that there are all kinds of\nthoughts in your head that will prevent\nyou from getting help\nand if you're having those thoughts\nthat's not a reason to not get help in\nfact it's the very opposite\nso sometimes your mind may be telling\nyou things like no one will be able to\nhelp because i haven't been able to fix\nit myself\nyour mind may be telling you i don't\ndeserve help and if you have any of\nthose thoughts you should actually get\nhelp\nbecause you're having those thoughts and\nthe last thing is you know how do you\nsupport someone else the short answer is\nget them into treatment\nand in terms of how you do that it's\nsupporting them sometimes through like a\nvery practical hey do you want me to\nlike google stuff for you\ncan we make phone calls together and\nsometimes it's just being their friend\nbecause it's your job to be their friend\nit's not your job to be their doctor\nand a lot of times people get really\nbent out of shape and stressed out\nbecause they try to\nbe their doctor when you just can't\nyou're not trained to do that nor should\nyou\ni don't i don't play doctor i i don't\naccept patients that are friends of mine\nso like you know people who have working\nrelationships with people who are my\nfriends people who are my family like i\nwon't be their doctor\ni will send them to someone else\nso that's our quick talk about suicide i\nhope it's been helpful\nyou know the goal of having this talk is\nbecause as we looked at earlier\nwe are sort of losing the war against\nmental illness we are losing the war\nagainst suicide and despite\nmany advances in medicine despite you\nknow a lot of new pharmaceutical\nmedications and things like that\nsome of which i've really seen like\nclinically do a fantastic job\num i really have seen some patients with\ndepression who've tried like\nfive or six medications and a new drug\ncomes comes on the market\nit really does turn things around for\nthem so it's great that like we have all\nthese advances and at the same time\nyou know the suicide has like increased\nas a cause of death by like 33\nover the last like 20 years i believe\nwhereas like you know deaths due to\ncancer and heart disease and stuff like\nthat have gone down by 20 to 40 percent\nand so the the first you know we're\ngoing to start by educating on\neducating y'all right so we as a\ncommunity need to understand more about\nsuicide\nwe need to understand like what it looks\nlike what it feels like what to do\nwith it and i encourage all you all to\nget some help because\nthe the you know the biggest the most\ncommon thing that i hear from my\npatients\nwho are reluctant to engage in mental\nhealth is like i wish i had done this\nsooner\nbecause some of them will just i mean\nyou guys will hopefully realize this too\nthat you just don't have to live like\nthis it's like\nyou know like you can fix this like you\ncan feel\nbetter on a day-to-day basis like the\nsun can be a little bit brighter you can\nbe a little bit happier\nyou can just enjoy things more you can\nactually live life with like more\nmotivation\nand like food can taste better and all\nyou have to do is just\nget a little bit of help because\nsomeone's asking a question\nwhat if you don't have money so\num it depends a little bit on where you\nlive but\nuh you know most places actually have\nmost places meaning like even countries\nlike so the u.s basically has\nfree mental health clinics or community\nmental health clinics\nin most like cities actually so\ni don't think people realize this but\nlike you can just do like community\nmental health center\nand you call the community mental health\ncenter and you say hey i have no money\ni'm depressed can you guys help me\nyou'll be surprised because there are\nall kinds of programs out there right so\nwe also have programs like rise above\nthe disorder\num or rad which is like you know a\ngaming non-profit that supports like\ngamers and actually\npays for their treatment through like\nscholarships and grants\nso there are non-profit organizations\nout there that'll help\nthere are community mental health\ncenters that are helped just call them\nup and ask\nso i wouldn't let that be a barrier\nokay so what's a good way i can open up\nto a clinic or therapist about this kind\nof topic without making it seem like i\nam in\nimmediate danger but it is still a very\nserious ongoing issue\nso it is their job so my job as a\nclinician is to keep people out of the\nhospital right like the hospital is like\na last resort\nit's not a first resort and so i would\nsay\njust share that with them just say like\nhey\ni'm not in any immediate danger but this\nis a very serious issue and i'm afraid\nthat you're gonna think i'm in immediate\ndanger just tell them\nthey'll be like okay cool thank you for\nsharing that that's like one of the most\nreassuring things that i can hear as a\npsychiatrist oh great this patient is\ntaking this\nseriously good\nthat means i can rely on them i can\ntrust them they respect the enemy that\nthey're\nfacing uh someone's asking why do you\nnot want to be a doctor for people that\nyou know\nso being a doctor is about being\nobjective\nright so what i want to do is like not\nlet my emotions\nget in the way of like my clinical\ntraining and when personal\nrelationships arise emotions and other\nkinds of boundary issues arise that like\nmake it hard for me to actually\nfunction as a competent doctor so there\nhave been numerous studies\ndone that show that physicians who\ntreat family members are more likely to\nmiss diagnoses\nthan like arando from the street\nah so what if your friend doesn't want\nyou to get them help how do you convince\nthem otherwise\nthat's a great question you don't\nconvince them otherwise\nso this is sort of where like what i\nwould encourage you to do is like\ninstead of trying to convince them to\nget help\nask them why they don't want help\nso anytime\nso anytime you have a disagreement with\nsomeone\ni think we try too hard in this society\nto like\nconvince instead of understand and i\nwant you guys to just pay attention to\nany argument like i\nreally wish i could so i i anyway i wish\ni could share something with you but i\ncan't but\nso like i want you guys to just pay\nattention to any argument and like think\nabout the arguments in your life\nwhere you try to convince someone and\nthey try to convince you\nwhat happens like\nit doesn't work whereas it's kind of\ninteresting because if you try to\nunderstand\nthem they will automatically\nempathically like their\nsome circuit in their brain will flip\nwhere they will try to understand you\nyou know and and so it's kind of\ninteresting because i wouldn't try to\nconvince them\nbut i would still like state your\nperspective and you can say like hey i\nsee you suffering\nit hurts me to see you suffering i care\nabout you i think this would help\nbut if you don't want to like you know i\ncan't make you\ncan you help me understand why you don't\nwant help\nbecause there may be something there\nthat needs to be addressed right so\nsomeone else is asking\nwhat if i'm afraid of my parents not\nknowing or my parents knowing\nso like there may be something like that\nwhere they're like you know they have\nsome fear like they're afraid\nthat they're gonna be hospitalized or\nthey're afraid they're gonna you know\nget kicked off of like whatever team\nthey're on or they're afraid that\num you know their parents will find out\nand so then you can kind of like help\nthem work through that right like you\ncan be like okay so like what\nyou know what are you afraid of your\nparents knowing what are you afraid of\nin terms of reaction or do you think\nthat they're not going to be supportive\nyou think they're going to call you weak\nyou think they're going to punish you\nfor it\nand then like you know then the\nconversation sort of becomes like we can\nmaybe talk about you know parents who\nare against mental health treatment at\nsome point\nthe conversation then becomes like you\nknow what's more important to you\ni know it sounds kind of weird but like\nyou know when i work with\nkids who whose parents aren't supportive\nof mental health treatment\nit's actually like really amazing to see\nwhat happens because the kid actually\nlike\nwe work to the point where like they can\nbe strong about it and it's sort of like\nmy parents may react poorly and i can't\ncontrol that but that's on them\nand i'm not going to let the opinions of\nmy parents\ndictate the life that i lead and that's\nhard like it's it requires a lot of like\ninternal fortitude and support from the\noutside\nto get to that point where you can let\nyour parents know and sometimes we'll\neven coach people\ninto how how to have a conversation with\nyour parents so when you tell your\nparents hey by the way like\ni want to see a therapist they'll be\nlike\nyou don't need that and then like once\nagain\ndon't try to convince them right so\nyou're you ask the question you ask them\nlike\nwhat do you think i'm feeling and what\ndo you think i need\nand they'll be like you know\nand just listen and be like okay i see\nso you think i'm feeling unmotivated\nbecause\ni got a b\nhow would how would like how would that\nlike how would you\nso you think that i don't need therapy\nbecause you think\nthis is just a temporary part of\nadolescence\nif i were to tell you that what i'm\nfeeling is very different from your what\nyou're describing\nif i'm feeling something that's very\ndifferent from what you think i'm\nfeeling\nwould that change your mind about\nwhether seeing a therapist is\nappropriate or not\nit's kind of like a weird question right\nbecause they're like\nit's kind of a weird question it's like\na hard question to answer because if\nthey say\nand then you may even get to therapy\ndoesn't do anything\nand then you can ask them like what's\nyour like help me understand why you\nthink therapy doesn't do anything what\ndo you base that on\nwhere does that come from\nand just have a conversation with your\nparents and then like even i i've had\nlike you know people working with super\nreligious parents who will be like\nyou know you just need to go to church\nmore like like you know\nmental weakness can be solved through\nthrough god\nso you can say like okay so what's your\nunderstanding about like why\npeople like you know why the profession\nof psychiatry exists and then the answer\ncan be something like well\nit's because people have gotten away\nfrom god\nand then you can be like okay so\ndo you think that like seeing a\ntherapist necessarily means that i've\nmoved away from god\nor can i do both like what do you think\nabout me trying it\nand like just being open-minded and\nseeing what the deal is\nand oddly enough when you approach i've\napproached\nvery religious parents in that way and\nfound them to be\nyou know like quite receptive it's\nbizarre\nyou know and even as a psychiatrist like\nsometimes like they'll come into my\noffice right and they'll be like\nprepared to do battle and so you just\nlisten to them\nyou can be like yeah like i completely\nagree would it surprise you guys\nthat i spent seven years training to\nbecome a monk before i became a\npsychiatrist\ni actually agree with you that a lot of\nthe reason that's that mental health is\ngetting worse in this country\nis because we've lost some element of\nspirituality and\ni think that like god puts out like\ngives us like\na lot of options right like and so we\nshould use\neverything at our disposal\nit's crazy like they'll be like and i'm\nlike do you guys think i'm evil\nyou just ask him and they're like no you\nseem like a nice guy and i'm like okay\nso like how do you guys feel about your\nson coming and seeing me once a week for\nan hour\nand we're just like going to talk about\nstuff they're like\nokay i'm like you guys can come\nonce a month too and let's just check in\nlike when you guys drop him off if you\nguys have any concerns\nyou can let me know and they're like\nokay like it's really strange but i i\nthink just\nyou know if you have someone who's\nresistant to being convinced\ndon't try to convince them try to\nunderstand them\nright and try to find some common ground\nlike because it's there like just\nbecause they don't want to see a\ntherapist for some reason\ndoes not mean that you know they they\nmay they may\nwant to avoid therapy for a reason but\nthey may want therapy for another reason\nso it's about sitting with them in that\nspace this is why it's kind of\ninteresting\nthat you know one of the outcomes we're\nnow measuring from our coaching program\nis like how good our coaches are at\ngetting people into therapy\nbecause a lot of people a lot of times\nfor whatever reason you all feel more\ncomfortable working with a coach than a\ntherapist\ntherapist will work with you for a\nlittle while like asriel is a good\nexample if you guys caught that\ninterview he like\nwas in coaching for a little while like\nwent to therapy for a while and then\ncame back to coaching and he seems to be\ndoing way better\nthe two are complementary yeah so what\nif you're dealing with someone who's\npsychotic so the other thing that i\nfor the sake of completing this i really\nshould have included is if you think\nthat someone is at like imminent risk to\nthemselves\nit's absolutely appropriate to call\nwhatever emergency services\nnine one one one one two like if you\nthink someone is like actually gonna\nhurt themselves y'all should absolutely\njust\ncall 9-1-1 or whatever the emergency\nservices\num and\nand like you know because\nlike if someone someone asked a question\nlike what if someone is psychotic like\nif someone is high on drugs or psychotic\nand like\nor something like that like you should\njust call an ambulance\nand get that person to an emergency room\nbecause that's what\nthe doctors in the emergency room are\nthere for which is you know most of my\nbread and butter when i work overnight\nshifts in the ed\nand it's really fantastic like i'm so\nglad that you know someone picked up the\nphone and like\nmade a phone call because they're going\nto come i mean there's a decent chance\nthey're going to wind up in the\nemergency room either way\nand it's just going to be like you know\nif their friend called\nthen we've got a good shot at saving\nthis person's life and\nif no one calls then we have less of a\nshot at saving this person's life\nand i can also say that you know i would\nsay\n90 percent of people that get\nhospitalized\nare grateful that they were hospitalized\nwhen they leave in my experience\ni wish it was 99 but honestly it's 90.\n10 of people really dislike it yeah so\nsomeone's saying i feel like i'm where\nreckful was that they died i don't know\nwhere to go\nseriously dude i'd pick up a dude or\nwoman or\nyou know whatever you identify as i i'd\npick up the phone and i'd call 9-1-1\nif you guys are where he was you'd pick\nup the phone call\nseriously that's like that's the only\nanswer if you're aware he was"
