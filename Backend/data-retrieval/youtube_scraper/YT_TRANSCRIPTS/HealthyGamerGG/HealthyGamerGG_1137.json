    "transcript": "dr k why are we so different to our own\nmind shouldn't our mind be nice to us\nno our mind should not be nice to us\nthis is a good question\nsomeone's asking shouldn't our mind be\nnice to us no what so chat let's do a\nlittle bit of socratic teaching okay you\nguys are gonna get like\nprofessor kenosha today instead of dr k\nwhat is our mind designed for absolutely\ngood job chat has learned a lot it is\nfor\nsurvival it is not it has evolved to\nsurvive\nnot to make you feel happy right so if\nwe think about some of these things like\nego negative emotion even stuff like\nshame like\nthink about this for a second there's a\nthere's a there's\na video on dr k's guides about why we\nhave negative emotions\nit's like one of my favorite videos\nbecause like like just think about this\nchat\nwhy the hell do we have the experience\nof shame\nand sadness and fear like they're just\nnegative they make us feel like crap\nso this is conserved across the human\nrace\nevery single human out there is capable\nof feeling\nanger sadness fear and shame why\nright like just just like understand\nthis this is important\nso the reason we have negative emotions\nis because\nthey're helpful from an evolutionary\nstudy we wouldn't have them right it's\nnot even like 50 50. it's not like\nyou know brown hair or blonde hair it's\nlike\nthere's a variance in the population\nbecause bl blonde hair is not\nnecessarily better than brown hair\nbut there is no variance in the\npopulation about the\nexperience of negative emotions so\nnegative emotions absolutely serve a\nfunction\nand at the end of the day you can say\nsurvival but if you kind of think about\nyou know like on a day-to-day basis like\nyou know what is the purpose of fear\nlike fear is to protect you what is the\npurpose\nof anger anger is to like help you stake\nout your territory and like\nnot be you know taken advantage of by\nother people like those are necessary\nemotions\nand and so like anxiety like what is the\npurpose of anxiety like anxiety\nforewarns us of danger if we didn't have\nanxiety\nwe wouldn't like anxiety is just our\npredictive capacity\nand our ability to plan for like\nnegative scenarios in the future\nright it's like anxiety is the reason\nthat we're able to like store food for\nthe winter\nlike those link like those circuits are\nlinked\nshould we prioritize survival or\nhappiness survival first happiness\nsecond\nso remember maslow's hierarchy of needs\nso this is what we sort of discover and\nthis is part of the reason so if we want\nto talk about why is mental illness\ngetting worse it's because i think we've\nas a society met a lot of our basic\nneeds\nso self-actualization and finding\npurpose and meaning\nis like more of an issue now like i\nstill remember\ntalking to my grandmother about when she\nwas growing up like\nindia had rationing right it was like\nunder british colonial rule\nand basically like it doesn't matter how\nmuch money you had like there wasn't\nenough flour or sugar to be bought there\nwas no such thing as a grocery store\nthere was like a dispensary where you go\nonce a week\nand you get a certain amount of thing\nand if you run out of flour you're out\nof flour until next week you're not\ngonna get any more\nthere's nowhere to buy it just doesn't\nexist\nand self-actualization is like not that\nimportant\nin that situation survival is important\nand what we sort of discovered\nas the human race gets better we start\nto become like more\nmentally unsatisfied which is not a bad\nthing it's just part of the process so\neven if you look at buddha like there's\na reason why\nif you look at all of the p not all but\nthe majority of\npeople who started religions\nin the east they're all kings\nso like it's kind of interesting because\nif you look at the indian subcontinent\nright so like\nindia gave us buddha he gave us rama it\ngave us krishna it gave us all these\nlike deities from this like karmic set\nof religions\nand in india there used to be a caste\ncis or there still is a catholicism sort\nof\nand the top cast were the brahmanas who\nare the the closest to god\nthe teachers of meditation in the most\nspiritual\nand all of the enlightened figures from\nindia are not brahmanas\nthey're chatrias the the noble cast the\nwarrior cast\nthey were kings so then it begs the\nquestion why don't brahmins get\nenlightened and why do the chatris why\ndo the students get enlightened but the\nteachers don't\nthere's a really simple answer for it\nit's because\nthe brahmanas lived in poverty\nand the chatris lived in luxury so\nthere's\nalways a seed of like desire in the mind\nof a brahmana\nwho takes a vow of poverty right they're\nnot allowed to earn\nwhat they do is they live off of the\ndonations of other people\nand so the chaterias are the ones that\nget enlightened because like if you kind\nof think about it if your mind is\nunhappy what does your mind tell you\ntells you\nif you had this you would be happy if i\nhad a girlfriend i'd be happy if i had a\nboyfriend i'd be happy if i had more\nmoney i\ni'd be happy if i had a you know the\nright video card\ni'd be happy if i had a ps5 i'd be happy\nif all these things happened i would be\nhappy\nand so what happened with the nobles is\nlike they got all those things\nand they like climbed the hedonistic\ntreadmill for a while and they sort of\nlike reach the top and they're like wait\ni'm still not happy now what\nwudo was loved respected revered\npowerful and wealthy\nand then he woke up one day and he was\nlike i'm unhappy\nand so all that's left is spirituality\nright so this is when people are saying\nall kinds of stuff like if i had a\ngtx or rtx 3090 or whatever\nand other people like if anime was real\ni'd be happy no you wouldn't you'd be\nhappy for a time and then you'd become\njust as unhappy as the people in the\nenemies\nare you are you saying that spirituality\nis required for us humans\nto be happy that's been my experience\nright so like\ni think so i mean y'all are welcome to\ndisagree i have read the power of now\ndo i recommend it sort of so i think\nthat like\nyou know reading a book is never a bad\nthing but i i don't think that\ni think it's good like you should read\nbooks on spirituality and meditation and\nlike\npower of now is eckhart tolle right so i\nthink he's got a lot to offer\ni personally find\na lot of those books to be like a touch\nsimplistic and a touch repetitive\ni tend to be a little bit more\nsystematic and like want more detail and\nunderstanding\nand i think a lot of that has been lost\nwith like the explosion of mindfulness\nso like mindfulness is like\nthis is also in dr k's guides we'll sort\nof contextualize where mindfulness\nbelongs in the tradition of meditation\nmindfulness sort of offers five percent\nof what i think like the meditative\ntraditions offer\nsomeone's asking i've heard of spiritual\nreasons to live in poverty too though\nso i don't i don't know if this is like\nuh okay so we're gonna do a little bit\nof lore\nall right so this story maybe is top of\nmind because i just shared it this\nmorning\nin in said group but so when i tried to\nbecome a monk at the age of 21\nmy teachers were like they didn't tell\nme this at that time but they\nyou know they said go back finish your\nstudies get a doctoral degree and we'll\ntake you if you\nif you still want to do it when you're\n30. and i didn't understand this but\nlike you guys understand that like\nbecoming a monk is about renunciation\nright so you like give up your life\nat the age of 21 i had less than a 2.0\ngpa was on academic\nprobation had a net worth of zero\ndollars and had never been in a\nrelationship\nhad never like accomplished anything i\nhad nothing to give up\nmy life was like completely empty\nthere's nothing to renounce\nit was escapism right it's like this\nlife is like there's nothing\ni'm not giving anything up i'm running\naway from a pile of crap that is my life\nand so they were smart because they\nrealized like you're not gonna make it\nunless you give something up like\nbecoming a monk is about\ngiving up stuff it's about renunciating\nright like it's like renouncing stuff\nso in order to renounce something you\nhave to have something\nso like we'll take you like once you\nsucceed in the material world\nso my teacher told me he's like be as\nsuccessful as you can in the material\nworld\nand when you reach the height of success\nin the material world then give it up\nand then we'll take you so like win the\ntrophy\nand then quit the tournament before you\nget your prize\nyou know that's that's the road of\nrenunciation\nso when when we kind of say that like\npeople people like so someone was asking\nabout isn't there\npoverty through spirituality like yes\nthere is but i think it's\ngrossly misunderstood and tends to be\nlike really really abused\nso i want y'all to understand this when\nsomeone like a monk like a real monk\nlike someone who understands this stuff\nthe reason that they don't\nwear a fancy watch is not because\navoiding a fancy watch makes you\nspiritually strong\nit's the other way around it's the\nspiritual strength that allows them to\nrecognize that like\nwhether you wear a watch or you don't\nwear a watch it doesn't mean anything\nright it's detachment from the thing so\nwe see this a lot like especially like\nin the indian and hindu community like a\nlot of people will\nfast because they think i mean fasting\ncan be healthy and can be a spiritual\npractice\nbut i think a lot of times they'll like\nlook at the way that monks eat and\nthey're like wow like you see how that\nmonk doesn't indulge in anything\nif i don't indulge in things i will\nbecome spiritual too\nmonkey see monkey do i will get\nspirituality too\nbut they've got it backwards it's the\nrenunciation and detachment of the monk\nthat allows them to eat\nwhatever without a problem and so like i\ncan eat like rice\nand dal every day because\nit's all the same to me it's the\ndetachment that allows me to live a\nsimple life\nit's not forcibly living a simple life\nthat will create the spirituality\nso you'll see a lot of people who will\nbe these like\nfalse spirituality egotistic people\nand i've seen them all the time right\nthey're like these people who like\ni'm not going to live a material life\nlike i'm going to be above\nthat crap i'm going to deprive myself of\nall of the materialism\nbecause i'm going to be a spiritual\nperson so much ego\nit's all ego completely misses the point\ni'm gonna be better than that that's ego\nyou're not doing anything\nyou're just confusing yourself\nright like it's it's like bro you're\nlike completely missing the point\nthe desire to not want material things\nshould come\nnaturally as a consequence of your\nspiritual practice that's been my\nexperience\nlike sometimes people will be confused\nby how i dress and it's not i'm not like\ndressing to advertise my spirituality\ni just genuinely don't care like why do\ni care about you know sometimes i'll\ndress nice because i recognize that i'm\na human\ni have to play by the rules of the\nhumans so you know\nback i don't know if you guys remember\nthis but back when i like worked in an\noffice i would stream\nin a suit and it's like\nwhy do you like you know i don't need to\nstream in a suit anymore i don't\nso i don't thought crosses my mind it's\nlike maybe every now and then i should\nwear a suit i was thinking about\nstreaming in a suit actually recently\nmore just because i was like i should\nuse this article of clothing that\ni spent some money on but understand\nthat spirituality is like it's a little\nbit\nbackwards right so and there is value to\nfasting for the sake of gaining\nspirituality\nthere's definitely value to that but\nit's not quite what i see mo\nthe way most people do it which is like\nthis is what spiritual people do\nso i'm gonna do that thing to become\nmore spiritual\nwhereas those behaviors are the\nconsequence of an internal change that's\nwhat they don't understand\nand so then they walk the walk and then\nthey think that like\nthat's sufficient but spirituality isn't\nabout outward behaviors it's about\ninternal stuff it's like you know you\ncan be in the world\nor not in the world and you can be a\nmonk either way\nis the waking up app an okay way to get\ninto meditation sure i think it's an\nokay way to get into meditation but\nhere's the problem with the apps\nthe apps don't have in-depth\ninstructions so like\nso if you look at most meditation apps\nwhat they actually will do is give you a\nvariety of techniques to keep the\ncuriosity of the mind engaged\nright they say like okay like today\nwe're going to do this kind of\nvisualization today we're going to do\nthat visualization\nbecause like the monkey mind that we\nhave like needs novelty to continue to\ndo something\nwhereas like if you want to do real\nmeditation like i've been doing the same\ndamn meditation practice for 17 years\nand that's when it really starts to work\ni encourage you to just think about\nanything else that you like build a\nskill in\nright it's like today i'm gonna write\nand today i'm gonna paint or tomorrow\ni'm gonna paint and the next day i'm\ngonna play music like\nthere's value to that sure like you're\nsort of artistically doing a bunch of\nstuff\nbut i mean i i think that there's a lot\nof power to\ndoing the same meditation practice which\nis the right meditation practice for you\nover a long period of time and generally\nspeaking when you look at\nyou know people who are very\naccomplished meditators\nthey didn't get that way through an app\nthey like\nlike i've never heard of anyone becoming\nenlightened through an app\nit generally tends to be like a\ndedicated focused spiritual practice\nlike taught by a real teacher\nbut i think apps are a great\nintroduction i think they're a great way\nto like anchor\nsome degree of ben like like you know\npractice\nbut i just don't think they're that in\ndepth\nso it's a good introduction"
