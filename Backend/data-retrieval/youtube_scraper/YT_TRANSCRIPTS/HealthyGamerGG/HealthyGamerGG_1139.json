    "transcript": "welcome\nthank you thanks for having me good\nmorning happy to be here yeah um you\nseem happy to be here which i'm not sure\ni oh should not be i don't know\nyou you seem so um energetic\nand ah yes i get that a lot i do get\nthat a lot really\nyeah what do people say\num\njust i don't know\nthat i yeah a ball of energy or like\nit's way too early for me to be this\nhappy or whatever else\nyeah\num\nthat's that's cool it sounds like it's\nfun to be you\nyeah i mean sometimes not all the time\nbut\noften enough\nyeah and so can you just start by\ntelling us a little bit so it's city on\nis that right\nyeah but uh you can call me sid or\nsydney whatever is more comfortable\nwhat do you prefer\ni like said\nokay sid it is\nand can you tell us i i'm sure most\npeople know who you are because they're\nspamming an emote that looks like you in\nchat but uh that'll do it\num can you just tell us a little bit\nabout where we can find you on twitch\nand on the internet and what you\ndo on the internet\noh yeah cool um i'm a twitch streamer\ni'm full time now uh you can find me at\ntwitch.tv cityon and i think all my\nsocials are the same but yeah i stream\nuh variety i like to say games but it's\nmostly valerie but then i switched some\nother stuff in there so yeah\nyeah awesome that\nand when did you become a full-time\nstreamer\nabout 10\nmonths ago\n10 or 11 yeah how's that been\namazing\nso i actually uh graduated school with a\nnursing degree and then i kind of just\nwas like well i'm at a crossroads here\nlet me just try out full-time streaming\nand it worked out for me so i'm i'm\nreally truly happy with what i do\ncongratulations on graduating\nthank you thank you\num and also you know going full time as\na streamer that's not easy to do\nyeah thank you i appreciate it i'm\nreally happy though i don't i don't\nregret any choices i made\nyet\nyet well there are other choices i\nregret but you know here we are\nyeah\nso sid is there something in particular\nthat you wanted to talk about today or\nor anything that i can help you with\num i think some things that you know i\nhad brought up prior were just like\nmulticulturalism is a huge thing for me\num in a discussion that i have on stream\npretty often uh imposter syndrome moving\ninto full-time streaming and like you\nknow\nkind of\njust my life completely flipping the\nopposite direction of where i thought i\nwas gonna go has been a big thing for me\nlately so kind of just feeling like i\nfit in here or belong\nwith like where i am\nokay awesome um i mean not that you have\nan imposter syndrome but i think these\nare wonderful things to talk about that\ni think will be you know very\neducational and hopefully helpful so can\nyou start by um telling me a little bit\nabout what multiculturalism means\nyeah so\nfor me like i'm half black and half\nwhite and i've grown up in a community\nthat\na community of people that never looked\nlike me and my entire life you know i've\nbeen around people who don't look like\nme um and so it's been\nan interesting adjustment to just try\nand balance the two cultures that i\nshare between like being black and white\num and i've always found it really\ndifficult and like as i continue to get\nolder\ni continue to find myself in spaces\nuh where i don't feel well represented\nlike even on twitch you know i don't\nnecessarily feel well represented as a\nblack woman um and so like having these\ntwo cultures is\nso much of my identity but i often times\ndon't feel like i\nyou know\nfit in or have people around me who are\nsimilar so um it's just a big thing for\nme to\nkind of\nuh recognize both and then try and\nfigure out how i can\nlive harmoniously with all of it\nit sounds like a lot like a lot of\nmoving pieces that you have to\ncontinually like try to fit together\nit feels like that\nyeah\nbecause i'm also kind of noticing that\nif you know if if your identity has\ndifferent facets in any given group\nthere may be a part of you that fits in\nbut other parts of you that don't\nexactly\nthat sounds challenging\nit is a hundred percent i think there's\nlike this famous lyric that's like too\nblack for the white kids and two white\nfor the black and that's like exactly\nhow i feel um for the entirety of my\nlife that's how i felt so\nuh it is definitely an interesting\nbalance\nyeah so i think that reminds me of one\nof my own kind of experiences growing up\nso i am what is known as a coconut which\nmeans brown on the outside and white on\nthe inside\ngotcha so i i grew up in east texas\nwhere um you know i was like\nnot indian enough for the indian kids\nlike i didn't go to indian dance class\nand like didn't know how to do like the\nball like i didn't watch bollywood\nmovies or listen to indian music\num and listen to like you know blink 182\nand and other angsty emo things\nand then but also was you know faced a\nfair amount of racial discrimination in\neast texas\noddly enough because i looked mexican so\nmost of the insults were actually\ndirected towards a race that wasn't even\nmine which is kind of\nfunny in some ways yeah\nbecause it's like how racist are you\nthat you don't even know\nno\nyes i am you know\nand\nand then occasionally you know\nappropriate racial insults\num yes\nbut i you know i i still think i imagine\nin some ways it was\neasier for me because at least i you\nknow i\ni don't know it it sounds more\nchallenging for you than what i remember\nmy experience being\nbut\nso can you tell me a little bit about um\nyou know what it was like to grow up\nuh you know with one parent who was\ncaucasian and one parent who was\nblack oh\num\ndifficult i guess because\nbecause\nyou know i think there's a phenomenon\nwhere people more heavily identify with\ntheir\nlike their culture that is um\nkind of discriminated against right so i\nfeel like i maybe lean more towards\nbeing a black woman that's if you walk\npast me on the street you see me as a\nblack woman you know all those things\nand i think that i often\ntalked growing up like i forgot about my\nwhite side or like my mom would feel\nhurt by me because she thought that i\nwould like forget that i'm also white\nyou know um so that was always really\nhard to balance with my my mom because i\ndidn't ever want her to think that i\nwasn't proud to be her daughter or\nwhatever else um but\nthat was that was difficult and also i\njust kind of felt like my mother could\nnever truly understand what i go through\nas a black woman as much as she tries\nyou know and is is a part of my life and\nmy experiences and like\nseeing how i've you know had to grow up\nin this world but i think uh\nthere are some things that she will just\nnever understand you know and so\num\ni don't know i guess like a lot of my a\nlot of my experiences as a black woman\nlike she's never faced the same\ndiscrimination so she can't like truly\nunderstand what i've been through you\nknow she can see it and she can hurt for\nme and be empathetic which she very much\nis um but it's just like\nshe's never\nshe doesn't like walk into stores and\nnotice that people are like watching her\nor whatever you know she doesn't have\nthose thoughts whereas like when i walk\ninto\nuh\nthe sephora and i notice that the person\nat the front door is like kind of\nfollowing me around i i see those things\nwhere she would never notice if she was\nwalking with me yeah so that kind of\nstuff i i love how illustrative that\nexample is\nlike\nyou know because i i think sometimes\nwhen we think about discrimination we\nthink about statistics\nlike you know like things that are like\nmeasurable but but what i'm hearing from\nyou is it's it's kind of just baked into\nwhen you walk around\nyeah yeah it's very like uh a lot of\nmicroaggressions all the time that most\npeople wouldn't recognize unless it's\nhappened to them\nevery time they've walked into you know\na place\ncan you tell me what a microaggression\nis\nyeah i mean i guess i don't know the\nexact\nuh\ndescription for it but i would just say\nthat like it's these small\num\nunder like undertones of racism that i\nwould face\nday to day things like uh that you\nwouldn't expect me to\nreally pick out but someone's saying\nlike something i got growing up was like\noh you're so pretty for a black woman\nyou know like you're so pretty for a\nblack girl and it's like you're not\nbeing super aggressively outwardly\nracist but you're like putting in this\nvery backhanded portion of what you're\ntrying to say to me so it's like these\nvery yeah\npassive-aggressive sly things that\nhappen\nan insulting compliment\nyes\nthat's what it feels like\ninteresting um i actually really like\nthat\nthat\nuh example as well\num\nyeah so i you know sid i find myself\nand you know we can talk about whatever\nyou want to but the thing that i\nactually find myself so curious about is\njust wanting to hear more about what\nyour life\nlike is like you know what is it like\nit's so illustrative\nfor me to just\num\nyou know to hear about your experience\nat sephora and and like just what it\nlooks like because i think a lot of\ntimes especially on the internet you\nknow words like microaggressions get\ntossed around and people will like say\nlike oh like microaggressions or bs or\nlike microaggressions are real but i i i\nthink the thing that i appreciate the\nmost about talking to you is how you\nbring some of these like abstract\nconcepts that people on the internet\nargue about to life\nbecause i think everyone i would hope\ncan understand you know how that's\nit's like oh you're pretty for black\ngirls like it's kind of\nyou know yeah\nthe the underlying tone of you're pretty\nfor a black girl is like i don't find\nblack women pretty but you oh you're\npretty which feels really bad\nand um uh it's definitely a comment i\ngot growing up all the time and i didn't\nrealize that it made me feel bad until i\ngot older and then i was like oh yeah\nthat's not a nice thing to say at all\nyeah\nso\nyeah it's interesting kind of reminds me\nof like cough syrup where they like make\nit artificially sweet\nbut it still tastes nasty\nyeah\nit's like\num\nyeah so can you just tell me a little\nbit more about so it sounds like your\nmom is white and your dad is black\nand do you have siblings\ni do um i have a younger brother and a\nyeah a younger brother and a younger\nsister and an older brother and an older\nsister okay\num and and so what was growing up like\nfor you like we're you know\nand i know that sometimes people are\nsense like you should be sensitive to\nprivacy and stuff so you don't have to\ngive me like a specific city or anything\nlike that but i'm just curious like what\nwas\nyou know what was life like for you\ngrowing up\nyeah so i grew up and i lived with my\nmom mostly because my parents have been\nseparated since i was young um i lived\nin the suburbs outside of seattle so uh\ndefinitely predominantly white and\nkorean i would say that i\ni think i had like\na few other black students in school and\nlike we all knew each other but i wasn't\nclose with any of them um\nso i felt like a lot of the time i was\nmaking friends outside of my race which\nis totally cool and awesome and like i\ngot to learn about a ton of other\ncultures and things like that but um\nit definitely makes you feel really\nalienated and i grew up\nif i'm being super candid hating the\ncolor of my skin i hated my skin i hated\nthat i was different um\ni\nhated my curly hair i\ndidn't like you know my more black\nfeatures that i had\num\nand that took me a really really long\ntime to accept myself for who i am and\nlike now i'm completely on the opposite\nspectrum i like love the color of my\nskin i love my culture you know whatever\nit is um but it was really hard growing\nup for sure because all you want to do\nis is fit in especially in high school\nlike the last thing you want to do is be\ndifferent than everybody else\num so i would do things like\ni don't know straighten my hair every\nsingle day i would uh if it was sunny\noutside i'd make sure that i didn't have\nany skin showing so that i wasn't\ngetting any darker like real self-hate\nstuff um growing up\nand\nit was something that i couldn't talk to\nanyone about because i didn't have\nanyone who could relate to me and my dad\nis like this super\num\nproud to be black man black man right\nand so i didn't feel i didn't want him\nto feel\ndisappointment or sad if i came to him\nand was like i hate being black you know\num that wasn't a conversation that i\nwanted to have with my dad because i\nwould feel so bad and then like\nmy siblings\nnot super close to growing up\num had very very different experiences\nso\ni definitely felt very very alone but\na part of something at the same time\nbecause i was in sports and leadership\nand like asb and all that kind of stuff\nso it was like i fit in but only because\ni was trying so hard to fit in\nhmm\nsid i\nyou know you\nyou do a wonderful job of like\nconstructing a narrative\nlike it's so interesting to hear a\nlittle bit about you know how you kind\nof piece things together and um\nit's also kind of interesting because\nwhat i'm sort of hearing is that you\nfelt a lot of shame but you couldn't\nshare that shame with your dad\nand at the same time you kind of like\nalso like identified with being black\nand that made it hard for your mom so\ni'm sort of noticing that it was hard\nfor you to like really\nopenly and authentically connect with\neither of your parents maybe yeah\num\nand and i guess that's where the kind of\nthe feeling of alienation comes in or is\nthat like more related to school\nuh\nno i definitely think it was a little\nbit of both and i mean not being able to\nrelate to my siblings my parents or the\npeople that i go to school with was just\nkind of like\nfeeling alone in that aspect all the\ntime\nyou said that you used to hate the color\nof your skin can you help me understand\nlike where those when you started to\nhave those thoughts\nlike how did that happen\noh\num\ni couldn't\nnecessarily pinpoint i want to say maybe\naround middle school is like when it\nreally became apparent to me that the\ncolor of my skin was going to\naffect the way that people around me\ntreat me or act or what they expect of\nme there are so many expectations\nas a black woman\nyou know my age but so many expectations\nas a young black woman as well\num\nand so i was oh sorry\nyeah no of course i guess like things\nlike\num\nyou don't sound black as something that\ni would get all the time and i'm like oh\nbecause i'm eloquent and well spoken and\nyou know whatever i don't sound black\nyou expect me to sound this very certain\nway that's a comment that you know\ni would get growing up and i didn't\nreally understand i would be like oh\nwhat does what does sounding black mean\nyou know and it's\nwhat people are expecting of a black\nwoman\nis these very like stereotypical things\nthat you see\nin in movies and like that's what you\nthat's what you expect and if you don't\nget that people are like shook you know\num\nso those those sort of expectations or\num as i've gotten older an expectation\nthat i feel put on me often is that like\ni need to be this really strong\nindependent black woman and like yeah\nthat's what i have to do and if i'm not\nthat you know if i'm vulnerable or\nany of those type of things then like\ni've failed as like the strong\nindependent black woman\nso the expectations have changed but\nthey've always been there\nsounds rough\nyeah yeah\ni guess i also don't want to make it out\nto sound like it's all bad or like it's\nalways sucked for me you know um\nbecause i guess that's what it sounds\nlike right now\nbut that's what i'm asking about okay\nokay right but i'd love to hear about\nyou know how has it been good\num yeah i guess it just like it makes me\ndifferent i have these very different\nexperiences than other people and i feel\nlike not only was i taught empathy from\na young age from my parents i also feel\nlike i\nlearned it through my experiences like i\ndon't want other people to feel the way\nthat i've had to feel and so\nit's made me this like really empathetic\nperson so i kind of try and twist them\ninto like positive things\nthat i would never like pass along to\nother people or i also think like now\nthe fact that i have a platform feels\nreally good because i get to talk about\nmy experiences and i feel like\nin my chat at least so many people\nrelate to me or\nfeel heard or seen or like i'm here to\nbe representation on twitch and so i'm\nlike really proud of that and happy that\ni could can be a part of that too\nhow does it feel to be a part of\nrepresentation on twitch\num\nyeah i mean obviously i want more i'm\nalways gonna want more uh\ni just remember like\nsorry go for it go for it\num i remember coming on twitch and like\nthe first time that i started watching\nit was never something that i could see\nlike myself\ndoing right and then i saw another like\nblack girl streaming and it was like oh\nokay this is there are black people on\nthe platform like i could do this you\nknow i feel seen i feel hurt i feel\nrepresented um and so\ni\nlike the idea of me being able to do\nwhat she did for me for other people\num\nand yeah of course i'm always going to\nwant more representation\nof of like black women in gaming and\nblack women black women and twitch\nbut i'm happy to be you know a start of\nit or and a part of it\nwhy do you want more representation of\nblack women and in gaming and twitch\nbecause growing up like obviously i've\nalways been into games um i've always\nread comic books i've always gamed and\nthen i felt like\nthere wasn't space for me in the\ncommunity\num and when i came on twitch and then\nsaw nobody that looked like me it made\nme feel like there was even less space\nand i'm like wow is there\nyou know could i stream on this platform\nwould i be able to make fred you know\nwhatever um and then when i found that\nthere is like a community of of black\npeople on twitch definitely feels more\nlike\nwould be accepted you can be a part of\nthis and like just despite your race\nbecause\ngrowing up the way that i did and i have\nlike you\nkind of a count race into a lot of\nthings you know\nhow do you\num\nuh\ni guess a lot of the time i'm like\nseeking out\npeople who look like me like i'm seeking\nout representation like i want to see\nblack movies uh you know black\nblockbuster movies like selling out\nwhatever those kind of things and so i\njust kind of move\nthrough life in that way so i come on\ntwitch and i'm like yeah i'm excited to\nwatch video games but then on my like\nthird day on the platform i go\nbut where can i find the black streamers\nlike where where are the black streamers\non here winning which is like what i\nreally want to see\nso can you help me understand like when\nyou see\nyou know let's say like\nblack representation being successful\nlike let's say like a like you said like\na you know box office or like a you know\na black streamer with let's say 50 000\nviews or whatever how does that make you\nfeel to see those things\nit makes me feel great like hi so help\nme understand that\ni\nunderstand the setbacks\num\nthat\nthese people have\ngone through right and i understand that\nthey probably felt the same way as me\nwhere they feel like\nuh pigeonholed or feel like the space\nisn't for them\nand then they're able to come on and\ntranscend that so like i know they had\nto work really hard and they've probably\nbeen through it and like\ni mean the amount of racist comments\nthat i get in my chat i can't imagine if\nyou have 50 000 viewers how much how\nmuch of that you're getting you know um\nand so i just recognize how hard it it\ncan be and so it feels very like i feel\nvery triumphant for them like their win\nis also my win because like i get to see\nthis\nyou know black creator succeed\nso i'm almost noticing like some degree\nof like identification\nwith this person like there's there's\nlike like i'm getting a strong sense of\nus\nyeah absolutely and so their win is is\nmy win\ni'm also kind of curious can you tell us\na little bit like have you been\npigeonholed like you've mentioned a\ncouple of microaggression kind of\ncomments\nright like you don't sound like a black\ngirl and you're ready for a black girl\nhave there particular been particular\ntimes where you feel like you've been\nkind of\nyou know pushed or forced to behave a\nparticular way based on the color of\nyour skin\num\ni definitely think\npushed yes i wouldn't say\nforce necessarily because i don't think\ni've ever really like\nconformed to those\nideas that are pushed upon me except for\nwhen i was younger because i was trying\nso hard to fit in you know but like\nyeah\nnow i'm like\nyou know you can think this way about me\nbut that doesn't mean that i have to act\nthat way um\nbut i definitely think\nyeah like in high school i was like i\nwas you know i did sports that's what i\nwas like supposed to do i didn't talk\nabout gaming or my interest in it like i\nwould go home and play video games and\nnot tell anyone or like read comments\nand not tell anyone that kind of thing\nbecause it didn't feel like it was the\nspace that was available for me um so\nand those points yes i definitely felt\npigeon holed\nthat's so interesting that you were like\npublicly into sports and privately into\ngaming\nyeah yeah\nyeah and and were there particular\nexperiences in in middle school or high\nschool that made you feel like\nfitting in was super important or you\nknow times where you kind of like had to\nlearn that harsh lesson of like you need\nto maybe talk differently or\nstraighten your hair or things like that\num\ni think like\nsorry can you repeat the question yeah\nso sorry it was a weird abstract\nquestion so let me ask a better one um\nso you said that you used to hate the\nway that you look\nyeah so help me understand how you\nlearned to hate the way you look um\ni think i just learned it through\nlike the fact that i was different like\nalways seeing people who look different\nthan me and like that's the beauty\nstandard so the girls who are considered\nthe prettiest in school looked\nabsolutely nothing like me so if i'm\nconstantly being told like\nso and so\nis is beautiful and like that's you know\neverybody is you know interested in this\ngirl or i think she's the prettiest and\nthen i'm like well my hair doesn't look\nlike her my nose doesn't look like her\nmy lips don't my skin doesn't then it's\nlike\nyou just learn to not like the way that\nyou look when you're the opposite of the\nbeauty standard um\nbut then yeah also through the\nmicroaggressions that definitely like\nhelps with that for sure um and then on\ntop of that not only am i like getting\nit in my school but i'm getting it in\nmedia too like the prettiest celebrities\nor the people who are you know\npop stars or whatever um it can just be\nyeah hard to see\nto look around and not see anybody that\nlooks like you\nyeah so that that's\nso what i'm hearing is that it's not so\nmuch\nlike you were made fun of or anything\nlike that like you weren't like bullied\nbecause you were a black girl it was\nmore like you know\nthere's like clearly like everyone kind\nof agrees\non what's good like who has the\nprettiest hair\ntop three all of them have straight hair\nwho's the prettiest girl in the class\nall of the girls are white\nyou know when you watch a movie\nthe heroine is usually a white girl\nyeah\nand and um\nand even then i mean i'm kind of like\nnoticing in media that you know you'll\nhave people who go\nlike you'll have like a movie that's\ndesigned for a black audience which will\nhave a black heroine but you won't have\nlike a black heroine in like a regular\nmovie right like even there's like\nseparation there\nwhere there's like the regular they're\nthe movies for everyone\nand then they're like the movies for the\nother people and you all get to be the\nprettiest over here\nyes but you're not going to be the\nprettiest over here\nexactly that's another form of like that\npigeonhole feeling like i'm supposed to\nwatch those black movies to feel good\nand like there's this whole like i love\nthat there is obviously this like black\ngenre for us by us for us to watch you\nknow um but at the same time it does\nlike have that effect on you it's like\nwell you're only allowed space separate\nfrom what's mainstream\nyeah\nyou get to be the prettiest in the\nspecial category yes\nexactly yeah so you know i said i i\nreally um\nreally appreciate your characterization\nbecause i i think that\nwhen i think about racism what i i just\nrealized and connect this until now but\nwhen i think about racism the way that i\ndefine it is by these things that are\nupvoted on reddit\nright like they're like very overt\nracism\nit's like things on like you know with\npeople freaking out and like you know\ni'm walking down the street and someone\nstarts calling me the n-word or whatever\nlike people like everyone's got cell\nphones so you tape it gets uploaded to\nthe internet gets passed around every\nlooks like oh like look at how bad\nracism is but what i'm i'm kind of\nreally appreciating from hearing you is\nthat\nit is systemic right it's not like it's\nnot like overt\ni mean there's that too\nyeah but that that you know there are\nyoung girls or boys\num who are growing up\nin these particular scenarios where like\nthe the rules of the game are set in a\nparticular way that like kind of creates\nan experience for you\nyou know\num and and so how did you start to\nnot hate yourself\nor hate the way you look i should say\nyeah\ni don't\nknow when i really\nstarted i would say\nmaybe like after high school\num after high school i went to college\num i\njoined the black student union um albeit\nmy college was still mostly white um but\ni definitely had the opportunity to\nsurround myself and i made the choice to\nsurround myself with other\nblack people and\ni finally felt like i found a community\nin that\nand i saw the way that other people in\nthat community had similar experiences\nto me but then other people in that\ncommunity had didn't have that at all\nthey like grew up in areas where they\nwere always surrounded by black people\nand they're just like yeah i love myself\nand i love my skin and i see that and\ni'm like wow i want that so badly like\ni'm tired of hating myself i've done it\nfor 18 years like it's time to move on\num\nand\nyeah i just kind of made a point of\nlike faking it until i make made it you\nknow and then i it was a really long\njourney and i would say i'm 24 now it\nprobably\ni didn't really like love love myself\nuntil it was i was like 22\nalmost 23 probably so the last year has\nbeen awesome but\nyou know fine finding that was\ndefinitely hard\nyeah that's so interesting so what i'm\nalmost hearing is that you know when you\njoin the black student unit i may be\nsimplifying this a bit but like everyone\nthere is like proud to be black and you\nhad all these like feelings of being\nashamed to be black but they're all\nproud to be black so you're going to\npretend to proud to be proud to be black\nyeah and then internally maybe there was\nsome degree of conflict and then i like\nfaking it till you make it then at some\npoint you're like oh actually like i\ncan't take pride in this that sounds\nreally great\nyeah um\ni think it highlights for me the\nimportance or also how long it takes\nif you've grown up believing something\nyou know how long it takes to start\nchanging the way that you think\nand how powerful of an influence you may\nneed to kind of\nyou know\nfeel that way\num i'm also super curious about how many\npeople now in like black student unions\nare secretly still partially ashamed of\nthe way that they look or the way they\nfeel\nand and you know it's kind of\ninteresting because it sounds like it's\nnot a place that really voices those\nkinds of experiences because we're all\nproud\nyou know strong independent black woman\nyeah i wonder\ni'm trying to think did i ever feel like\ni couldn't i guess i put that on\nmyself to feel like i couldn't share\nthat i'm sure everyone i could have\nyeah i think we definitely could have\nhad the conversation but because i felt\nso much shame now for instead of being a\nblack person now i feel shame for being\na black person who's not proud to be a\nblack person and so like ah i don't want\nto voice this either\ni think i probably did that to myself\nyeah it's kind of interesting i also\nthink it's it's fascinating that when\npeople talk about you know positive\nblack women that they define them with\nthe same three words every single time\nyes\nwhat do you think about that\num it just creates another box\nuh it creates an expectation\nuh\nit puts me in a position where now i\nfeel like if i\ndon't hit those expectations those three\nwords then it's like well\nam i the\nright black am i am i the right black\nwoman um and so it feels hard to do but\ni think one of the things that i want to\nlike a mold that i want to break is that\nblack women are also sensitive\nand you know you know all these other\nthings that they're are opposite of the\nwords that they're given to work with\nyeah so i'm kind of curious said who\nmakes that box\ni don't know\num\nfirst thought is like media\nyou know and and the there's like a\ni think it's i don't know what old trend\nit is or if it was a video or what it\nwas but it was like i'm a strong\nindependent black woman and blah blah\nand it just kind of like\nstuck\nyou know or like the the\naggressive or angry black woman has just\nlike stuck in media and it's like\nconstantly represented that way it feels\nlike\num\nand\nso i i'm sure it's not just media but\noff the top of the head\noff the top of my head that's what i'm\ngetting\nyeah so i can kind of see how media\nwould propagate it like what i'm\nnoticing actually is that um and you\nknow let me know if this this is\noffensive in any way but like what i'm\nnoticing is actually like i think that\nthe black student union put you in a box\ntoo\nright that like pride is what we have to\nfeel\nand i can understand why why they would\nfeel that way because like you have to\nfight really hard for that pride\nyeah\nbut it's it's kind of interesting\nbecause i i sort of notice and i know\nthis is like shaky ground but like a\nparallel in terms of you not feeling\ncomfortable sharing your shame in that\nsituation because it wasn't like what\nwas socially acceptable like what do you\nthink\nyeah that's why i definitely think it\nwas like i have\ntwo opposite shames but both are bad i\nguess i kind of viewed one as equally\nworse because it dug me out of this like\nreally deep hole you know yeah but\nessentially it's it's the same thing\nyeah which is fascinating there's so\nmuch about you that's very yin-yang\nin terms of\nyou know yes\nnot to capture the color of the imagery\nbut like really that's the term that i\nthink of it's not because you're half\nblack and half white it's because you're\nconsistent\nyou know it's just very fitting though\nyeah\nis that is that a microaggression or is\nthat fair\nno i think that's fair okay\nyou gotta let me know if i micro\naggressive\ni think that's fair a joke i would have\nmade for sure okay\num\nyeah so that that's so sid i'm really\nnoticing that like\noh man let me just think for a second\ncause i'm feeling something i just don't\nknow what it is\num\nyeah so i guess the main thing that i'm\nkind of noticing that has changed for\nyou is that you felt uncomfortable with\nwho you were\nand then as you started to move in a\ndirection towards like being more\naccepting of your black half for lack of\na better term even then like\nthere are certain norms that are put on\nlike actually\nnorms or boxes that i think\nyou know black people put on other black\npeople that you have to be a particular\nway\num and and that you know i think it\ncomes down to kind of the strong\nindependent black woman which i i just i\nalways think it's so interesting that i\njust hear all three of those words and\nit's like you can't be\nyou know degenerate gamer independent\nblack woman yes yeah you know like but\nwhat\nand and what i i'm not surprised that\nyou left nursing school or not sorry\nleft nursing as a career because and\nthis is i think what i was kind of\nhitting on is that you kind of said that\nin the last year you've learned to love\nyourself and i don't think it's\ncoincidental that you being able to love\nyourself and stepping away from maybe\nthe path that the world has laid out for\nyou and jumping towards a path that is\nactually like not easy right like you're\non an uphill battle there where you know\nwhen i i mean occasionally i'll get the\nracist comment when i stream\nbut you know it's not most of what i\ndeal with thankfully whereas like you're\nchoosing to fight this somewhat uphill\nbattle\nand like help me understand i mean is\nthat fair to say that loving yourself\nand deciding to go full time on twitch\nlike has some connection\nyeah definitely i think it's because you\nknow in loving myself i've found this\nconfidence that no matter what i do like\ni'm gonna do it well and\ni like truly believe in myself to\nmake it work and if it doesn't work i\nknow i can pivot like that kind of thing\nand that's i think a chance that i\nwouldn't have taken\nif i was still hating myself i wouldn't\nhave believed myself i wouldn't have\nbelieved that i could have done it\nso i'm yeah that's so interesting so\nlike\nhow did you learn that\ni know i'm trying to find a better\nanswer for that no no no that's what\nwe're here for right because i think\nhere's the thing sid what we see for you\nis somewhat of the finished product like\nyou told us a little bit about where you\nstarted a little bit in the middle but i\nthink when it comes to people who\ngravitate towards twitch\ni think it's like people who\n[Music]\nyou know there's a part of all of us\nthat like is happy to be\npart of twitch\nbut then we're also like ashamed because\nwe're not like the other people\nyeah and\ni think it would be so curious to try to\nlearn\na little bit about how that confidence\ncame about and like where it came from\num\ni think it helped because my parents\nwere always really supportive of\neverything that i did they always\nbelieved in me wholeheartedly um so that\nhelped a lot if you're just like\nconstantly being told which i know not\neverybody experiences that especially\nfrom their parents so that's like one\nportion um\nanother is that i kept seeing things\nwork out for me like i knew i had the\nwork ethic to do it you know i just have\nthe motivation to like get things done\nand i had the work ethic and like those\nkind of things like i succeeded in like\nschool and like anything that i put\nmyself to i did well so\nonce you've seen it go well enough times\nyou kind of go okay this isn't just like\na random one-off like i'm making this\nhappen like i feel like i felt a lot of\nautonomy and the things that happened\naround me so it wasn't\nyou know any outside forces that made me\nsuccessful it was me that made me\nsuccessful\num\nand\ni\nguess\ni just found confidence or i found\ncomfort in knowing that everybody else\naround me has their own stuff going on\nlike everyone else is worried about\nyou know\ntheir meeting today or they're also\nfeeling insecure or whatever else as\nsoon as i could look around and be like\noh yeah all these people around me are\nhuman beings too and they're all they\nall have their own struggles it made me\ngo okay my struggles are okay because\neveryone's going through it essentially\ni guess that helps too\noh that's that's a beautiful answer so\nthere are a couple pieces of that that i\nthink are quite illustrative\num\nnot that i'm like the ultimate judge on\nthis but one is that i i think it's\nreally interesting when you mention\nautonomy\nthat's not usually something that i hear\nwhen i ask people where their confidence\ncame from\nbut it's such an interesting way to\nthink about it because i think\npeople who lack confidence i think\nultimately believe that the world is\ngoing to determine what happens to them\nyeah right it's sort of like i don't\nhave the power to change what the world\nis going to give me\nwhereas people who are confident\nacknowledge that the world kind of like\nyou said because at the beginning you're\nlike if i put my mind anything i'll\nsucceed and i'm like i don't know if\nthat's true but then you kind of qualify\nthat in a second and you said if i fail\ni'll pivot\nyeah and i think that's the key thing\nabout autonomy that even if you do kind\nof stumble\neven if you do have a setback that you\nactually have agency and that you can\naffect your future\num\nso that's interesting because when i\nwhen i talk to people who aren't\nconfident i don't hear that\nyou know i hear people\nfeeling kind of like fatalistic and like\nthat they don't really have a choice and\nit's not in their control or that\nnothing is in their control or there is\nnot enough in their control\nyeah and the second thing is that i\nthink a lot of people who are not\nconfident compare their insides to other\npeople's outsides\nso they compare the way that they feel\nto what they see other people doing yeah\nand my my favorite example of this is\nlike class presentations everyone is\nnervous no one looks yeah\nyes\nbut i'm really i think it's really\ninteresting to see that you sort of\nrealize that like\nyou know we're all struggling here yes\nand it's okay to struggle\num\nwhich is cool\ncan i ask you a question that may be\nlike a little bit\ni feel like we're there's a\npositive vibing right look we're talking\nyeah oh my god like oh like you're\nso brave like\nyou've grown it's just struggling to pin\na black woman\nbreaking barriers on twitter like it's\nall that's true right it's like\ni'm with you and i i genuinely feel that\nexcitement and pride but i want to ask\nyou something that i just really\nstruggle with as a medical professional\nand as someone and i'm going to lean on\nyou for expertise here okay okay can i\ndo that could we do that or you want to\nsay yes\nwe do not need to stay safe here it's\nokay so this is something i really\nstruggle with so like i know there are\npeople who get discriminated against i\nknow we have beauty standards i accept\nall of that you know i faced a fair\namount of racism myself\num\ninterestingly enough i also have like\npositive racism which is kind of weird\nlike i get stereotyped like i remember\nwhen i was in med school i would have um\nfemale black colleagues who when we were\nall doctors they people would refer to\nthem as nurses and when i was like a\nfirst-year medical student in my suit\nand tie everyone thought i was a doctor\nbecause i was indian yeah yeah and\nthat's\nyou know so like i even have the\nbenefits in some ways of of you know\nbeing brown um but what i'm really what\ni really struggle with as a medical\nprofessional is like fat acceptance\nlike what do you think about that like\ncan you help me understand how you view\nsort of like the fat shaming fat\nacceptance movement\nyeah i guess um it's\ninteresting for me because i don't\nnecessarily have direct experience right\nso i can empathize sympathize try my\nbest to understand what you know people\nwho have experienced fat shaming have\ngone through but i myself haven't\nbecause i have the privilege opposite of\nthat\num\nso for me in terms of like\nthe movement i guess i'm always going to\nsupport people who are like\nhealthy and\nfeel good about themselves right so like\nif you're someone who has been\ndiscriminated against your entire life\nbecause of your body but you feel\nhealthy in yourself and you're happy\nwith the way that you look and like\nyou've like worked so hard to accept\nyourself i'm gonna be appreciative of\nyour acceptance and like i'm proud of\nyou for that of course and then if you\nare in a different direction and you're\nlike i want to\nlose weight like people in my family\nhave struggled with this so i've like\nseen kind of firsthand the struggle but\ni've never experienced so it's kind of\nhard to say but like in watching my\nfamily go through like the weight loss\nacceptance you know that kind of thing\nit's like\nyou can\ntry so hard and it can be one of those\nuphill battles all the time to lose\nweight and then eventually you can get\nto a point where it's like i'm happy\nwith where i'm at then i'm like proud of\nthat too i guess my thing i'm like\nreally dancing around an answer because\nit's so hard to say when you don't\nreally know but i just want to be\nsupportive\ni guess of like whatever journey it is\nif it's a self-acceptance journey i'm\nsupportive of that if it's a weight loss\njourney i'm supportive of that\nso i don't answer your question yeah you\ndid um was it okay that i asked it or is\nthat like too much of a\nyou know\nno i think it's fine i mean like my goal\ncoming on here today was to be super\nopen and candid so i don't\ni mean i'm happy to talk about whatever\nyeah so i i really thank you so much for\nengaging in the conversation because i i\nthink it's like um\njust as someone who's faced a lot of\ndiscrimination and as you can we're kind\nof talking about like i can understand a\nlot of aspects of you know that\nperspective\nyeah um you know in terms of having a\nparticular beauty standard right so like\nwhen you think about a beauty standard\nlike\nit's not equal in terms of body types\nand there's actually like you know\nthere's research from that started 100\nyears ago that human beings basically\nhave three body types and that all three\nare like normal variants within the\npopulation there's an ectomorph\nmesomorph and endomorph\nand and endomorph is what we call big\nboned\num\nuh ectomorph is what we call like you\nknow people who have a fast metabolism\nthey can like eat whatever they want to\nand they kind of won't gain weight and\nthen mesomorph it tends to be what most\nof our male actors are\nin terms of their like you know muscular\ndon't have too much fat but aren't too\nskinny\nso there's definitely like standards\nwithin these three biological body types\nthat is not equal\ni can kind of get behind that i think\nwhat i'm really curious about is when\nyou say like healthy\nlike you say that you know you can\nsupport anyone in their journey which is\nwhat i try to do\nyeah so i try to just you know meet\npeople where they're at and support them\nin in terms of like self acceptance and\nstuff but i'm curious like what when you\nuse the word you know\nhealthy what does that mean to you when\nit comes to fat shaming or fat\nacceptance\num\nso i used to work at an eating disorder\nclinic actually when i was in nursing\nschool and i got to see a lot of people\nwho were\nmentally unhealthy because of the things\nthat they had experienced right so like\na lot of these eating disorders were\nlike a product of\ntheir environment and like you're you\nknow like being told this your entire\nlife or you're in sports or whatever and\nthis this this that about your weight\nand like that's really really mentally\nunhealthy which obviously affects your\nphysical self um and so\nto me i'm like if you are working\ntowards being mentally and physically\nhealthy like\nthat's what's important like if you\nif accepting your weight and feeling\ncomfortable where you are\nimproves your mental health it's you\nknow they kind of like go hand in hand\nand so for me it's like\nthat\nthat is health like you you feel good\nabout your weight you're accepting of it\nlike you're managing it that kind of\nthing and when i say managing i just\nmean like\nyou're you're you've like\nhmm\ni'm i don't want to say\nthat in order to be\nhealthy\nyou have to like\neat less or work out more but like you\nknow you're just like eating well you're\nfeeding your body what it needs\ni guess and so that might be more for\none person than it is for the other\nperson and that's still healthy for them\nbecause that's\nthe that's what they need\ndoes that make sense yeah i i'm getting\nthis one\nsorry no it's okay like i i like this is\nwhy i was honestly asking for permission\nbecause i recognize i could i may have\njust dropped you off in my mine field\nsaid\nwell it's not necessarily that it's just\ni'm not well versed on this at all you\nknow like in terms of like my\nmy\num\ntime at the eating disorder clinic is\nlike i'm on the opposite side of the\nspectrum so when it comes to you know\nbeing overweight i\nhave only seen it in like my family and\nso yeah definitely i am trying to be\ncareful because i don't want any of my\nideas to be misconstrued and ultimately\nfor me it's just about\nis the individual happy with where they\nare do they feel mentally healthy and do\nthey feel good about their body if so\nawesome if not i would be happy to like\nhelp support someone to get there\nso let me let me um\nmake sure i understand you because i\nwant to acknowledge this too so here we\nare two people who have body types that\ngenerally speaking are more acceptable\nin society that that conform generally\nspeaking to you know a beauty standard\nthat society has and we're commenting\nabout the experience of people that\nwe're not it's like you know two old\nwhite men talking about what it's like\nto be a young black woman right so let's\njust acknowledge that and i appreciate\nthat acknowledgement part of the reason\nthat i actually asked you is because\nis because actually we're both separate\nfrom it so i'm really curious because\nyou have lived through i think some of\nthe things that are similar\nto what these people face\nand so that's why i was kind of curious\nabout because i'm never gonna just like\nyou said i'm never gonna maybe i will\nbut you know i've already grown up being\nan ectomorphic body type so like\nthroughout high school and stuff i was\nlike super skinny now i have like a\nsolid dad bod which is like you know\nthat's just where i am now but um\nyou know it and maybe there's some\namount of acceptance there and an\nappreciation that i've got a dad bought\nbut\nyou know like i i i really appreciate\nyour carefulness and and your um\nstating very clearly that you don't know\nwhat it's like to live that live in that\nperson's shoes\nand that's actually why i really also\nappreciate what you said which is sort\nof like it's not about kind of an\nobjective right or wrong it's about\nsupporting someone in their journey and\nkind of trying to help them get to the\ngoals where they're where they want to\ngo right and which i'm with 100\nand this is something that much like you\ni've worked with eating disordered\npatients\nand and the challenge there though is\nthat i noticed you kind of said like\nmental health and you said like\nacceptance\nbut i'm a little bit curious and you\nkind of will tiptoe out and so i'm going\nto pin you down a little bit with all\nthose cabinets okay so you kind of said\nlike you know if they're eating food\nthat\nis what their body needs and to\nrecognize that different people have\ndifferent caloric requirements and\nthings like that i think like you know\nuh professional like olympic swimmers\nwill eat like 9 000 calories a day or\nsomething ridiculous because that's just\nwhat your body needs\nbut what about for people who aren't\neating food that's physically healthy\nin terms of like junk food\nsure\nor excessive calories\num yeah i mean\ni can't be one to say like you should or\nshouldn't do that right it's not my job\ni'm not their doctor um or their\nnutritionist or whatever uh\nbut as like i guess if it were my friend\nwho was eating in an unhealthy manner uh\ni definitely think it kind of depends on\nwhat relationship i have with that\nperson but of course like if\ni could be there to help if they want to\nhave a more healthy lifestyle then i'm\nlike happy to be there supporting that\nkind of thing but i also know that it's\nreally hard to like\nforce someone to do something that they\ndon't want to do you know and i'm not\ngoing to try and be like oh well you\nshould eat less or you should eat\nhealthier you should come to the gym\nwith me or like those kind of things you\nknow because\nuh unless they've explicitly asked for\nthat kind of support i'm not going to\nforce that on them\nyeah i think that makes a lot of sense i\ni really\nam grateful that you're talking about\nthis because i think it's helped me\nnavigate how i'm going to work with some\npeople that i you know have\nin a clinical capacity\nso here's the kind of key takeaway that\ni have which makes so much sense\nbecause i think with eating disorders\nyou know we sort of have an objective\nright that we're shooting towards as\nmedical professionals that is um\nkind of independent of their particular\nviews and that's why i get really kind\nof confused about um how to handle fat\nshaming versus fat acceptance because i\ncan acknowledge a lot that you know\nthere are unfair beauty standards and\nthings like that so i'm with i'm there\nuh\nand at the same time you know one of the\nmost devastating things you could\ni could say in this kind of situation is\nthat\nfat acceptance and fat shaming\nit can be correlated with an eating\ndisorder right so to say take this\njourney of acceptance and pathologize\nand say you're sick\nyeah and at the same time i think after\ntalking to you i now understand that i\nthink it's kind of irrelevant that\nreally the goal is to accept because\nthis is what i do with people who do\nhave eating disorders is you know you\naccept them for who they are\nand then you kind of see what they're\nwhat they're willing to do what they're\ninterested in doing you you kind of as a\ntrader i try to align my goals i don't\ndetermine goals for my patients i align\nmy goals based on what they want\nand kind of accept them for who they are\nand where they are and then\nyou know offer an opinion maybe but like\nnot to say that that's\nyou know i mean it is kind of\nobjectively right in some situations\nlike sometimes when i'm working with\nlike hospitalized people who like you\nknow yeah late stages of starvation and\nstuff but\num but even then usually in those cases\nthe more that i can accept where they\nare and what their goals are the more\neffective treatment is\nabsolutely i think like patients feel\nreally supported too when that's when\nthat's done\nyeah accepting and listening of\nwhat they want\nand and i know it sounds kind of weird\nbut sometimes what the conversation\nturns into is like\nthere are medical consequences to your\ndecision but you are actually allowed to\nmake those medical consequences\nright it's your choice and if this is\nthe life that you want to live whether\nit's an alcoholic who's got you know\nfatty liver disease\nor a smoker who's you know well on their\nway to emphysema people get to make\nchoices and they get to make choices\nthat can damage their body and if that's\nthe life that they want to live and now\ni recognize i'm doing it again because\nsuddenly i'm lumping in fat shaming and\nfat acceptance with like smoking and\nthings like that that's something i try\nto avoid\num\nbut i i do think that eating fast food\nlet's say you know which is something\ni'm guilty of from time to time\nbut thank you so much for kind of taking\nthat tangent\nyeah of course helping i feel like i\nunderstand it a lot better\num\nyeah cool so do you want to talk about\nimposter syndrome or any questions or\nwhat do you want to talk about\num i don't know i'm pretty open to\nanything i have like seen you chat about\nimposter syndrome before so if you're\nlike totally sick of it we could talk\nabout something else too but it's you\nknow i think kills a lot of streamers so\nyeah so tell me about imposter syndrome\nwhy do you think that you have imposter\nsyndrome\num i think part of it is like i\nnever expected myself to be here and\ni kind of like always thought i was\ngonna be doing something in the medical\nfield or science you know and then to\nkind of like switch it so quickly it's\nnever too hard\nyeah well\nit is never too late and that's you know\nthat's part of my pivot that i was\ntalking about earlier is like i have\nyou know i'm here and i'm doing this but\nif it ever comes to it i'll just you\nknow pivot to nursing and whatever um\nbut\nyeah i just always thought one thing for\nmyself and then to switch and have\nanother that i\nyou're kind of like given this idea that\nyou need to dream about whatever it is\nyou're gonna do and you're gonna need to\nwork so hard in school like most of your\nlife to get where you will be as an\nadult right but like i didn't spend\n10 years streaming and like building\nthis craft or whatever it is\num and so to be where i am now kind of\nfeels like well i didn't work that you\nknow i didn't work that hard where i\nobviously i did you have to work hard to\nlike\nstream for the most part\num what do you deserve\nwell\ni feel like i don't deserve most of the\nthings that i have but\ni think that other people\nlike my friends and my family would look\nat me and say that i deserve it which is\nwhy i try and like reframe my my brain\nto think so but\nit's just\nhard to feel deserving of the life that\ni get to live now like that i get to\nwake up and do something that i love\nevery day\nand be a part of such a cool community\nand like those kind of things it doesn't\nnecessarily feel like i\nlike i get really awesome opportunities\nand when they're brought to me i'm like\nwhy are you talking why is this for me\nlike why are you bringing this to me or\nwhat did i do you know\nokay which whenever i say it obviously\nlike sounds really silly but it's just a\nlike one of those things in the back of\nyour head that you have to like work\nthrough all the time why does it sound\nsilly\ni don't know i guess like when i when i\nsay it\nto my to friends or people around me\nthey're always like well you can't\nyou know you can't say that about\nyourself or you are deserving of what\nyou've done like you've worked really\nhard and so if people are constantly\ntelling you the opposite then you feel\nreally silly for thinking those things\nor i feel really silly\nyeah so let me ask you when\nyou know are your friends accepting you\nin that moment\nyeah i definitely think so um i would\ndisagree\ni think i think they're i don't think\nthey're trying to tell me that i'm being\nsilly i think that they're trying to\num combat those\nnegative feelings that i have\nyeah so are they accepting you\nor are they combating you\nokay fair enough fair enough\nyou're interested right\nyeah i guess i guess that's the way that\ni deal with it too when my friends come\nto me so then i'm like oh well i'm doing\nit wrong too because to me if a friend\ncomes in like oh i don't think i deserve\nthis opportunity i'm like well no of\ncourse you do like you worked so hard\nfor this and like blah blah and that's\nalways felt like the right thing\nyeah so\nnow this is great because we're back\nback in the black student union\nyeah right\nyeah oh of course like everyone deserves\nit man like oh we work so hard like\nyou're strong and you're independent and\nyou've worked so hard you absolutely\ndeserve it\nwell you're crazy for thinking that you\ndon't deserve it\nyeah\nnow hold on a second\nbecause you've done this before this is\nyour strategy sid\nyou fake it till you make it\nyou're gonna have this internal struggle\nwhere a bunch of people are gonna tell\nyou you deserve to be proud and\neventually they'll convince you and\neventually you'll understand it for\nyourself and all that kind of good stuff\nlike i think it's good i think it's\nnormal right they're trying to be\nsupportive they care about you yeah i\ndon't think they have negative\nintentions\nyeah and at the same time i don't think\nthey're accepting you and it's kind of\nweird\nbecause like\nand this is where i i'd kind of ask like\ndo people get what they deserve\nsometimes i'm sure other times i'm sure\nnot\nand so it's kind of interesting because\nif if people if you're saying you know\nif the structure of your imposter\nsyndrome is i don't deserve this there\nare two things\none is you can convince yourself that\nyou deserve it\nor\nor\nyou can say so what\nwhy do you need to deserve it like why\ncan't you just\nlike i don't deserve i honestly said\njust between me and you i don't deserve\n90 of what i've got\nlike i really don't and i don't think i\nsay that out of like shame i think it's\njust true\nlike my kids are amazing\nlike i have not done\nthat much good in the universe to\ndeserve having my kids in fact i don't\neven deserve the professional\nsuccess that i have to be honest i\n up royally like most people\nup really royally until the age of 26\nand 27 and they don't get to wind up\nwhere i am\ni don't think i actually deserve it i\nthink i'm lucky\nwhat do you think about that\ni have questions good um\none i'm curious if\nlike does that feel like you're\ndiscrediting yourself\nno i forget the things that you've done\nno i think it's actually accurately\ncrediting myself\nso i think that the credit that i\ndeserve is the effort that i put in\nit's not the outcome it's not the\nsuccess\nwhat i get credit for is applying to\nmedical school three times in a row and\nnot giving up\nbut the third time if i didn't get in i\nmean i didn't get in the first two times\nso like i don't think i deserved to get\nin the third time does that make sense\nkind of yeah\nso you're\nyeah i had another question but now i\ncan't really remember it so\nso i know it's kind of a weird way of\nthinking because it's clear to me you've\ndone a lot and i think your strategy\nwill work people will eventually\nconvince you that you deserve it\nyeah if you keep getting brainwashed\nit'll happen\nand then you'll have it\nworked once it'll work again\nand at the same time i know it sounds\nkind of weird but like\nyou know if you get something that you\ndeserve i know it's weird but it's like\nin a weird way it's hard to feel\ngrateful for it\nand if we think about where resentment\ncomes from it's not getting what you\ndeserve\nyou know so i would say oddly enough\nlike you can we can try to convince you\nlike oh like sid you're strong you're a\nstrong black woman like you deserve it\nlike the world has denied it to you\nyou've worked so hard and like you\nabsolutely deserve your success like i'm\ntotally fine with that line of reasoning\ni really am\ni think what you\nbut i i think even if you don't deserve\nwhat you have like you can still be\ngrateful for it and be like i lucked out\nthat's a pass for me\ni'm going to try to help other people\nand like there there are people people\nwho have been you know transformative in\nmy life and like people who inspired me\nto become a twitch street streamer i\nactually don't deserve the success i\nhave on twitch but i'll take it i'll be\ngrateful for it and i'll\ntry to make the world a better place\nwith the platform that i have\nwhat do you think about i think\ni think that particular reasoning is so\nhard for me to kind of break what i've\ntold myself my entire life in terms of\nlike autonomy\nyou know how we spoke about it earlier\nit's like very much like well i if i\nwant to get somewhere i have the power\nto do that you know so then the whole\nlike luck thing is really hard\nto\nfit into this idea that i've always had\nyou know and i'm not saying that i'm\nopposed to it i'm absolutely not opposed\nto it all super open-minded those type\nof things it's just more like um\ni'm going against the grain in thinking\nthat way or it's a little bit harder for\nme to think that way which i'm willing\nto do love it love it so here's what i\nlove so much about your response so\ngenerally speaking\nif we think about growth\ngrowth is actually stepping away from\nthe things that we used to believe\nright so like it's kind of i mean i i'm\nsure that sort of makes sense but a lot\nof times like growth is is people and\nthis is kind of what we\nyou know what i've seen in people who\nare successful is that what gets them to\ntheir point of success becomes\nmaladaptive at some point\nand that is as people continue to like\ngrow and become more successful they\nhave to let go of the things that got\nthem there which is terrifying so one of\nmy supervisors once told me that growing\nup is literally giving up what used to\nwork\nso i'm with you that at some point you\nhad to sort of discover that confidence\ncomes from autonomy\nbut i think actually we can squeeze in\nif we don't want to talk about luck but\nlike you know i think there's some\nphilosophy here but i think the key\nthing here is i think what you can what\nyou have autonomy in is your choices not\nthe outcomes what do you think about\nthat\ni agree i feel like my\nchoices\nlike dictate the outcomes you know like\nit's like a causal relationship which is\nnot necessarily\ntrue sometimes i can work so hard and\nnothing will come of it or i can work\nreally hard and something will come of\nit you know there's it really can go\nother ways it's just easier for me to\nthink that like if i work really hard\nthen it's gonna be really great you know\nthere you go\nthat's the problem and you've just\nfigured it out yeah your mind chooses\nthe easy route because otherwise the\nworld is a terrifying place\nyes\nyeah right the idea that it's out of my\ncontrol really is terrifying\nyeah\nbut\nlet me explain something to you said\nyou know i'm not that i don't really\nunderstand this stuff maybe you can go\nask an actually successful twitch\nstreamer\nbut i would argue that you actually\ncan't control who shows up when you\nstream\nand if we're saying success means like\nhow many people are watching you can't\ncontrol that all you can control is like\nclicking the go live button\nwhat you're wearing you can control what\nyou play you can control what you say\nyou can control the attitude that you\nbring you can control but you can't\ncontrol who shows up\nyeah and it's absolutely a terrifying\nway to think about life because what i'm\nasking you to do is actually\nnot surrender your autonomy technically\nbecause you still have choice but you\ndon't you get to you know if you're\ncrushing on someone and you ask them out\nthat you get to control\nwhether they say yes or not you don't\ndeserve\nand if you understand half the\nresentment of the internet it's crushing\non someone and\nyou know not getting the answer that\nthey want to that they want right yeah\nso i'm i'm with you i'm i'm happy to\nhear that you're saying you know i don't\nquite accept that like i'm not ready\nlike i'm open to it but i'm not which is\ngreat i don't think you should accept it\ni think you should think about it\nyeah no i definitely think i i am\nthinking about it i guess um\none of my things and like i hate to use\nthe term but i would definitely consider\nmyself a control freak and so i work\nreally hard like those say that\nsituation where it's like i'm crushing\non someone i would not\nsay anything until i knew that the\nanswer was like 99 gonna be yes and if i\nknew it was 99 gonna be no i wouldn't\nsay anything so i like put myself in\npositions where the risk is really low\nand i've like pretty much always lived\nmy life that way until it came to\njumping into streaming that's like the\nriskiest\nchoice i've ever made for sure and it\nfeels like the only one\nand how did that what was your\nexperience of jumping into streaming\nit worked out fantastically\num\ni\nobviously there's like lots of you know\ndownsides to streaming and whatever else\nbut like\ni'm the happiest i've ever been so i\ntook a risk and it really worked out but\nit could have failed\nit could have\nit's still but then why would you do\nthat\ni guess because i was\ni don't know if i was confident i guess\nit was just like no matter what i'm\ngonna be okay even if it fails i know i\ncan do something else but what i've\nprepared myself\nwell i don't know it it went out the\nwindow for that one decision for that\none singular decision i just\nleft it up to chance and\nwhat do you think about using that\nstrategy again was that just a one-off\nor you think maybe sounds terrifying\nthat sounds terrible\ni don't want to do it again it happened\nthis one time there's no way it happens\ntwice\nah you lucked out\ni might have i might have\nright so\nbecause you you certainly didn't deserve\nit\nright it doesn't feel like it no to my\nstandards it doesn't feel like it and i\ni would i know some kind of sound kind\nof weird right\ni agree with you\nyou don't deserve it\ni don't think you deserve success on\ntwitch\ni think what you're entitled to is what\nyou choose to do\nso i don't applaud the if you want me to\ncheer for you you want me to say you go\ngirl i'm not going to say it because\nyou're successful on twitch i'll say it\nbecause you decided to step away from\nfrom nursing and hit the go go live\nbutton for that i'm 100 in your corner\nwhether people show up or not is like\nthat's not up to you\nyeah and so what i judge you for what i\nvalue you for what i respect you for\nis not your success it's for your\nchoices\nwhat do you think about that\ni think it feels good because so much of\nthe way that we are taught to value\npeople in this society is based off of\nsuccess so to be valued\noff of something else feels good as\ncounter-intuitive as it may seem like oh\nyou told me that i don't deserve this\nyou know i'm sure chad d colin what the\nheck whatever you know but\nultimately like\nyou're saying that\nyou're proud of me for doing something\noutside of my comfort zone for taking\nthat risk whatever it is rather than\nlike\nproud of the success which feels good\nbecause i had autonomy in the choices\nthat i made but no autonomy and a\nsuccess\nyeah\nand so then now we have to talk about\nthe fun stuff which is like\nso you don't have to answer this if you\ndon't want to but you know since you\nmentioned that you're not going to ask\nsomeone out until you're 99 sure they're\ngoing to say yes\nyou know are you in a relationship right\nnow do you feel comfortable answering\nthat\num i'm not i'm seeing someone yes okay\nso like is it okay if we talk a little\nbit about and you can say no i can see\nyou\nso maybe we should i should\ni just haven't told my chat so if my\nchat's in here and they're like\nso that's all no i'm not so concerned\nabout the details of your personal life\nwhat i think it's a really good um\nwhat i what i think is useful is that\nrigging the odds in your favor\nbecause when it comes to romantic\ninteractions boy do we do that\nand what i want to have a conversation\nabout is like not so much the details of\nwhat's going on but like what was in\nyour head in that process\nof like approaching in early phases how\ndid you try to stack the deck\nwhy does the deck need to be stacked why\ndo you have to wait until 99 percent to\nlike shoot your shot\nbecause i'm a terrified projection\nokay\nwhat does that mean\nthat means that like literally worst\ncase scenario this person is not as\ninterested in me as i am in them or\nwhatever else and\nthat would put me in shambles so\nhow does that put you in shambles\ni don't know because i just don't\num\ni know not to take it personally right\nlike it's probably don't\nwell\ni don't know how to explain it like it\ndoesn't feel good no one likes to be\nrejected right it doesn't feel good to\nbe rejected so i don't want to be\nrejected there you go but don't feed me\nthat line of that you were\ngoing down a second ago\nwell what the thing that me and my i\nlike try and tell myself is like if\nsomeone rejects me\nit's not a me thing it's because it's\nlike wrong time or like whatever else\nyou know unless someone is like\nexplicitly like i don't want to date you\nbecause xyz then obviously i'm like okay\nthis is a me thing and whatever but in a\nway to cope with rejection oh\nhold on\nso if someone says it's a you thing how\nwould you feel\ni would be like damn that really sucks\nuh now i need to take a look at like why\nxyz is so bad or i didn't know xyz so\nlet's fix xyz if i think it needs to be\nfixed if it's someone like i don't like\nthe way you organize your shoes like\nwhatever like okay whatever but if it's\na really valid reason that someone\ndoesn't like me then\njust just think about what you said\nbecause that's brilliant\nright so you're saying like if i get the\nfear of getting rejected i'm going to\nassume it's going to feel personal but\nif someone actually told you no and it's\nbecause of something personal your\nresponse to that is crushing it\ndude\nit's like i'm going to do some self i'm\ngoing to do some introspection i'm going\nto see like is this something i actually\nwant to change you're not actually going\nto wind up in shambles if someone\npersonally rejects you\nyeah i guess it would still suck though\nlike it would feel really bad\ni'm with you that it'll feel bad but i\nalso want to point out that if someone\nactually rejected you as a person\ni think you're going to handle it\nbizarrely well\nyeah i would explore those feelings like\nwhy\nis it something that's valid do i agree\nshould i be working on this\nwhatever else yeah which which doesn't\nsound like shambles to me\nnow i'm not doubting that you'll wind up\nin shambles we'll get there in a second\nand we'll wind up in shambles but but\nlet's just understand that if the\nscenario that you are so afraid of\nactually does happen i think you'll\nactually handle it pretty well\nyeah i'd be all right but if you get\nrejected you'll you'll wind up in\nshambles and we'll get to that that'll\njust do with self-confidence and\nimposter syndrome and all that crap\nokay we'll get there a second but can we\nacknowledge for a second that instead of\nfeeding me the line of bs which is like\noh like don't take it personally no\nyou'd like if if you did take it\npersonally if someone said this is a you\nthing\nyou would actually introspect you'd\npivot it's actually what makes you\nawesome right you'd like come out of\nthat kind of badass because you're\nsomeone who takes feedback and works on\nyourself and you try to like be a good\nperson and all that\nyou know so that's good so if someone\nyou know with a particular person like\nwhat is the thought of someone saying no\nlike what is that how does that make you\nfeel\num\ni mean yeah i guess i\nwould take it personally uh because\nyeah it's probably a me thing\nbut i i that's also expecting someone to\ntell me like a lot of people just say\nrandom right like i\ni am expecting that person to be like\nyeah this isn't gonna work out because\nblank you know where as i feel like a\nlot of the time people are like this\nisn't going to work out and then i'm\nsitting there like well why is it going\nto work out what did i do and it's like\nthis really deep dark ugly hole that i\ndon't want to go down okay\nnow we're getting somewhere right so\nwhen someone doesn't give you a reason\nwhen there's a question mark what does\nyour mind do\noh i would be haunted for like years to\ncome\nokay so let's think about that for a\nsecond so like this is going to be kind\nof weird okay said because we're\nokay\nwhere does your mind know how to fill in\nthat question mark\nlike where where does it you know\nbecause it could be like\nyou know because like when when when we\nare faced with a question mark in life\nour mind supplies us with answers yeah\nyeah so where does all that stuff come\nfrom like what kind of things would you\nhave\nit would be stuff that i've seen in like\ntv or movie\ntv or movies it would be like what i've\nseen happen in my like with my friends\nor with my family or like reasons why\nyou know they've been dumped or whatever\ntell me tell me i mean don't oh you know\nno no violating a privacy or anything\nbut yeah yeah\nyeah so um\ni guess i've seen like on so i watch a\n ton of reality tv shows\nspecifically baby ones it is my vice\nit is my advice love island binges for\n12 hours at a time okay\nso i\nthe disappointment in your face but like\ni'll see people like yeah it's not gonna\nwork out because you are too hot-headed\nor something like that right then i'm\nlike oh my god am i too hot-headed i\nknow that's not true so what's the next\none um is it because i'm not emotionally\navailable well that very well might be\ntrue um so i would assume something like\nthat or\nuh i\nam not\nvulnerable enough is like okay now i'm\njust like\ntelling you my relationship fears\num i'm scared yeah i'm not vulnerable\nenough with my partner or\num\nsomething like i'm really scared to be\nboring i'm really scared to bore my\npartner\nuh okay\nso now\nso yeah so you\ngood job\nyou're telling me your emotional\nthis has nothing to do with them it has\nnothing to do with the reason they\nrejected you what your mind fills in\nis coming from you\nright so why do we fear\nfail like because like because here's\nthe thing\nif you stack the odds in your favor and\nthey say yes what happens to all your\ndoubts about your emotional availability\nand you're scared to be boring and all\nthat crap\nthey say yes what happens to all those\ninsecurities\ni mean they're definitely still there\nthey're just kind of like\nsubsided for the moment that they're\nlike\nyeah damn right and then if if i'm just\ngonna assume a heteronormative\nperspective for a moment so like if if\nyou text him over a weekend and he\ndoesn't respond what happens to those\ndormant fears\nthey just pop right back up there we go\nyeah so when you stack the odds in your\nfavor and you trick them into saying yes\nin the back of your mind\nwe're gonna act\nwe're gonna put on this act we're gonna\nbe look at you like in the first 30\nseconds what did i say about you look at\nhow lively you are\nheaven forbid you appear to be boring\noh my goodness\nright\nyeah\nand so as long as you like stack the\nodds in your favor i know this is kind\nof weird but you're actually\nhamstringing yourself in terms of\ndeveloping confidence\nbecause if you put on this show and you\nlike work extra hard to not be you\nbecause heaven forbid they see all that\nugliness on the inside so i'm going to\nput on this act i would make sure that\nthis person is going to say yes\nbut then it's tricky because like\nwhen you say you're kind of not\nemotionally available i think what your\nit sounds like what you're not\ncomfortable doing is being vulnerable in\na relationship\nand then\nyou know\ni don't know exactly where i'm going\nwith this but it feels\nlike it's in the right direction if yeah\nit does for me too yes\ni feel like i should give you some kind\nof answer instead of just\nmaking you feel naked on stream\nno no it's okay it's okay i i will help\nyou just give me a second fair enough\ni ended up so this is the problem when i\ntend to be right is like usually when\ni'm wrong i can ask more questions\nbut when i say things and it seems to be\nright i like hit the end of the train\nlike way too quickly so you got to give\nme any any thoughts or questions about\nthis\num\nno i guess it's like uh yeah one of\nthose you pulled the table cloth out and\nlike\neverything kind of shattered not really\nnot in a bad way but just sort of like\noh yeah well these insecurities are my\nown and i'm projecting them into like\nthe way that i handle\nrelationships or like these fears are\nnever going to go away no matter how\nmuch validation i get from my partner\nit's like a band-aid it feels like a\nband-aid\nokay now we're gonna no no they will go\naway they're absolutely okay but what\nyou need to get from your partner is not\nvalidation\nbecause here's the thing like what you\nneed to get like what you like here's\nthe problem you can't if you're tricking\nsomeone into falling in love with you\nsid\nstacking the odds 99 in your favor\nyou're gonna do your hair cute you're\ngonna look cute and it's gonna be great\nand like he's not he's not gonna know\nwhat hit him like all that stuff is\nfantastic but then the problem is that\nlike you can never have confidence that\nhe's into you\nright because it's the odds stacked in\nyour favor because you've compensated in\nyour mind the more you stack the odds in\nyour favor the more you're compensating\nfor all the negative stuff\nand so if he says yes why did he say yes\nis it because of the way that you stack\nthe odds or is it because\ndoes that make sense\nyeah i guess one thing that i do want to\nsay is like the whole stacking the odds\nand the favor thing feels very\npreliminary for me like\nonce i'm past that\ninitial\nlike\ni'm equally like i'm interested in this\nperson and that they're equally\ninterested in\nme\nlike that stuff kind of goes out the\nwindow like i but i also feel like\neverybody puts on their best face when\nthey're like beginning dating someone\nyeah i'm not saying like it makes sense\nyou know be slovenly\nyou go out you know but but so so that's\na really good point so like what happens\nis you start to stack the odds in your\nfavor right like they say yes now you\nfeel reassured you can show them a\nlittle bit more and then we get to your\nother fears which is like you're not\nemotionally available you're scared to\nbe bored\nand you know whatever and so then i\nthink the next thing is is that if we\nlike talk about relationships and if\nyou're dating someone at some point\nyou're gonna have like\nlevel two of that thing i don't know how\nelse to put it but you're gonna have an\nopportunity to stack the odds in your\nfavor and not show something\nor\nbe vulnerable for a moment and give the\nother person a chance to accept or\nreject you\nand the confidence comes when you\nactually like put yourself out there\nand give him a chance to reject you\nyeah\nright so like\nshow and that can be incredibly\nterrifying because you don't actually\nknow like you know the thought\nthat\nyou'll be rejected for all of these\nthings that you because you're afraid\nright and you don't ever want to give\nyourself a situation where you will be\nproved correct\nbecause right now you've got doubt on\nyour side baby\nyou could be wrong it's all my\ninsecurities thank god it's not real\nit's just my insecurities but if you\never take a chance\nand it turns out that your insecurities\nare real\nthen you're sol\nwith me\nyeah\nso it's it's the trickiest thing in the\nworld but like we can never like this is\nwhat paralyzes people is that\nthe insecurities that we have we never\nreally give people an authentic chance\nto like\nit's not about validation it's about\nlike testing them\nand instead when you tell your friends\nall they're going to do is reassure you\nwhat does that do to your reassure your\ninsecurities\nit's like a band-aid fix again yep and\nthey'll come back\nyeah and so when i asked you about\ndeveloping confidence when you say fake\nit till you make it like i think you\nmade something there's something very\nreal there\ni don't think they just convinced you i\nthink that on some way there is\nconditioning right so they started to\ntell you particular things and this is\nwhere you know honestly if i you know i\nhope i can authentically be like oh my\ngod you're watching dating shows because\nthis is where there may be a real thing\ngoing on which is that if your mind like\ni know it sounds weird but we do get\nconditioned by what we're exposed to so\nin the case of black student union you\ngot exposed to like tons of like\npositive language and so you started to\nlike really test it for yourself i don't\nactually think that dating i mean i\nwould i would be curious but i don't i\ndon't think it's really the dating\nshow's fault but i would be curious if\nyou kind of cut back on the dating shows\nor you even acknowledged that this is\nthe dating show talking\nand see its effect on your mind whether\nthat would help\nbut those things don't even approximate\nreality right\nno\nokay yeah no it's all\nyeah i don't know i guess like\nit's stuff that i've always watched\nthough like\neven when i was younger i would i\nwatched like\ni don't know next in parental control\nand like all of that garbage um\nso it's hard for me to say\nwhat it\nthe take that i would have on\nrelationships if i wasn't watching it\nyeah i mean\ni i gotta say\nthe more that i think about it the more\ni think i'm just kind of memeing with\nyou that i don't really think i mean\nbecause it sounds like your insecurities\nare based on real experiences actually\nwhich is what they usually are\nyeah because\nyou know\nbecause i\nsomething tells me that\nyou know being emotionally unavailable\nis not like what\nthey demonstrate on dating shows\nyeah i guess sometimes like when i see\nthere's definitely like a season that i\nwas watching with my friends and there\nwas this girl who like could not share\nher feelings i was like oh my god like\nmy friends were like oh look it's you\nyou know like those kind of things and\nit's like yeah that's uh yeah that's me\num or but it is an experience that i've\nhad\non my own in dating and then it's like\nyou just see it in someone else and\nyou're like oh that's how i act that's\ncrazy ah so maybe this is a chicken or\negg issue because maybe it's not the\ndating shows that condition you\nbut maybe it's your own because that's\nthat's why we watch twitch right that's\nwhy people actually watch this channel\nit's because the people on here are like\nrepresentations of what we ourselves\nexperience\nyeah\nso i i'm so now i think if we want to\ntry to make this productive because now\nfor some reason i'm feeling bad\num oh\ni'm not quite sure why but so i want to\ntry to help you be more emotionally\navailable\nwhat do you think gets in the way of you\nbeing emotionally unavailable\nor emotionally available what makes it\nhard for you\num i think there's a lot of things if\ni'm getting super personal about it two\nthings in my life come to mind first\none is that my mom and watching her date\nso like my dad and my mom separated when\ni was young like three or something like\nthat and there\nhave my mom has like been in and out of\nlove a lot of\ntimes growing up and so\ni was constantly witnessing her\nput her heart on like she wears her\nheart on her sleeve right she's very\nemotionally available like\num upfront about those kind of things\nand i just saw\nit not work out so often\nthat it made me go well i need to be the\ncomplete opposite and i don't want\ni don't want to go through like what my\nmom went through you know\nso that's one of them and then i think\nthe other one is this strong independent\nblack woman box that i'm supposed to\nlive in\num makes me feel like if i am vulnerable\nand open or like weak you know like\nthat's seen as weak it's the opposite of\nlike this box that i'm supposed to be a\npart of\num\nand so it makes it\nreally uncomfortable and hard for me to\nexpress the way that i feel\ndamn you are introspective\nyou're good at this\nthank you\nit's like speed running\nokay\nall right so i've got three things for\nyou\nnumber one i think it's it's makes sense\nright so\nyou saw firsthand over and over and over\nagain the consequences of being\nemotionally available\nand you were like this is a bad strategy\nit leads to suffering\nand so we're not going to do that so i i\nthink oddly enough\nchanging our behavior like if we want to\nbecome more emotionally available the\nfirst thing to understand\nis that emotional unavailability is not\na problem\nit's a solution\nso it's a solution that protects you\nso this is the biggest biggest mistake\nin general that i see with people trying\nto change themselves is they see the\nthing that they want to change is a\nproblem that needs to be fixed whereas\nwhat they really need to understand is\nthat is a solution\nthat as long as the problem that that's\nfixing is there it's going to be really\nhard to like let it go\num so i don't know exactly how so and i\nthink essentially what you're saying is\nthat like you're not\nyou're doing it to protect yourself\nyeah right it's like protecting me from\nthat rejection or whatever else yeah so\nthis is do you have a therapist\nactually okay so i think this is have\nyou talked about this with your\ntherapist\na little bit yeah so i think this is the\nthe great thing to do i would recommend\nthat you spend this time like with your\ntherapist and what i would actually\nrecommend you do is like talk about the\nactual experiences of watching your mom\ngo through what she went through\nand something cool will happen there i\nmean it's going to hurt when you recall\nit\nbut the cool thing is that the more you\nkind of like process and metabolize\nthose emotions\nthe less need you will need the less\nimportant that shield will become\nit's just how it works okay\nthe second thing is the box now this is\nimportant sid\nyou got to let yourself be a weak\ndependent\nblack woman\nyeah\nright like we have to like\nthat's going to be tough but i think\nthat's the short of it like so i think\nthe problem with a lot of this\nyou know acceptance stuff is that we\nonly accept a certain kind of acceptance\nyeah\nand and you know like we should like\naccept people who are like overweight\nand we should accept minorities but\nheaven forbid we be compassionate\ntowards people who support donald trump\nscrew those guys\nor like we shouldn't be compassionate\ntowards like anti-vaxxers or\nanti-masters or whatever right like like\nwe have it's kind of interesting because\nas a society we sort of have something\nthat is acceptable to cheer and if you\ndon't live up to that then you don't\ndeserve\nyou know and so i i love the way that\nyou kind of talk about the box of the\nstrong independent black woman because\nlike i think if you want to be a weak\ndependent black woman you go girl and\nyou've got my support either way\nand i i think oddly enough what happens\nis that whether you're strong or not is\nnot fitting into that box i think your\nstrength is not something that can be\nmeasured by like what people's put in\nthe box that i see very clearly i think\nyour strength is in your choices it's in\nthe things that you do it's in your\nfailures it's in you know putting\nyourself out there it's in\nyou know having these challenges and\ncoming on the internet and like talking\nabout and that's your strength it's not\nlike whether you succeed and wind up in\na good relationship it's like what you\nchoose to do it's how you choose to live\nyour life\ni don't know how you go about accepting\nyourself as a weak dependent black woman\nbut i would say that you deserve your\nlove and your compassion and your\nrespect either way\nand that you don't have to be a\nparticular thing to like be respected\nright like if that's the choice that you\nmake just kind of like what you were\nsaying when we were talking about you\nknow fat acceptance versus fat shaming\nwhich is like\nyou you accept the people for what they\nwant to do\nyeah and the third thing is skills just\npractice\nso like this is where i'd say very\nconcretely like you know if there's\nsomeone that you care about and you have\na feeling that your mind is telling you\ndon't share it\njust share it a tiny tiny tiny bit\ni've gotten better about that for sure\ni've actually been very vocal with the\nperson that i'm seeing about these\nissues that i have\nand have\nthey they understand how hard it is for\nme to say the things that i want to say\nor like when i do\nyou know\nexpress my feelings they they understand\nhow difficult it is for me which helps a\nlot\nyeah so you actually stumbled upon a\nreally cool technique there which is if\nyou have trouble talking conveying your\nfeelings\nwhat you can actually do is go meta so\ngo one level above it and say hey i'm\nhaving trouble conveying my feelings\nyeah\nand it's i'm serious it's it's how you\nbecause then then as he accepts that\nthen you're gonna feel like more\ncomfortable talking to him and then\nyou'll get there so i'd say you know use\nthis what sid has stumbled upon which is\nif you have trouble communicating your\nfeelings or even if you don't know what\nyou feel you can just explicitly say\nthat to your partner\nhey i feel\nlike i don't know what to say right now\nor it's hard for me to connect with you\nand then that's actually really good\num i don't know if that's a solution for\nyou or not but i felt compelled to give\none i don't even know why because i\nusually don't feel compelled to do that\nuh in terms of like\npracticing yeah that yeah no i\ndefinitely\ndo\nthink it is a solution\nand i'm trying really hard at it it's\njust different there's a butt there's\nnobody no no no\nit is it is a solution it is hard\nwhat's the butt give me the butt\nis it really no butt\num\nno i mean like okay it is a solution but\nit sucks like it's not fun it's hard\nit's really hard for me to do but i\nunderstand that it's like probably good\nfor me\nyeah yeah and then but what\nokay so now now we okay so we're gonna\ncome full circle and maybe this will be\nthe end\nso is it okay to not use that solution\nis it okay for it to be hard and for you\nto decide actually you know what this is\ntoo hard for me today\ni think so but it would not be something\nthat i would want to give up entirely\nlike if like one day i feel compelled to\nsay something but i'm like oh yeah this\nis too hard i'll try again tomorrow\nwhich is actually something i do really\noften like really really often that's\nawesome i'm really happy to hear that\nbecause i think what that's actually\nallowing yourself to do is be weak\ni get to be weak today\ni don't have to be strong every day\nbecause the strong version of me would\nhave said it and like pushed myself past\nwhat i yeah yeah exactly so i i said i\nthink you're doing fantastic i'm very\noptimistic for you\nhey um\nas far as being an imposter\ni know we were supposed to talk about\nthat\nhmm any thoughts about that how are you\nfeeling about that whole thing\n[Music]\nfor me\nit's a feeling that doesn't have an an\nend necessarily like i i'm not like oh\nonce i'm able to do this i will no\nlonger feel like an imposter i don't\nknow\nwhat that is going to look like it feels\nlike something that i'm like gonna need\nto reframe over time but i don't really\nknow how to do that you know um\nbut i suppose i'm like optimistic about\nit i'm hopeful that eventually it'll be\nsomething that i'm able to get past\nanother part of me recognizes that so\nmany of my peers feel that way that it's\nlike oh does it is it just like the\nterritory that comes with what we do\nyeah so\nlet me share one or two thoughts about\nthat um and i apologize that you know we\ndidn't spend more time on that so one is\nit's interesting because imposter\nsyndrome\nso we have an internal sense of identity\nand that internal sense of identity has\nevolved like literally like over the\ncourse of evolution our internal sense\nof identity is slow to change\nso if we think about like a human being\nlike\nyou know like i'm a kid and then i'm a\nteenager and then i'm an adult but i'm\nnot really like a full adult\nlike i'm adult in the sense that you\nknow i have a job but i don't know how\nto pay my taxes yet\nyou know those kinds of things and then\nwe like gradually become the people that\nwe are right it's not like an overnight\ntransition even if you thought think\nabout you know your transition from high\nschool to like confidence was like a\nfive or six year thing\nso imposter syndrome literally like this\nis like what i think i consider it's not\nreally a diagnosis but the diagnostic\ncriteria it's when your external value\nskyrockets outer proportional to your\ninternal value\nso you see this with people who become\nvery successful very quickly because\nyour internal sense of value hasn't\nbecause generally speaking like how\nsuccessful we are is like a gradual\nupward slope and what we see especially\nwith content creators and social media\nis that people will explode right so one\nyear ago you were like a nursing student\nyeah and now you're sid\nand so it just it literally takes your\nbrain when there's a discrepancy between\nyour internal sense of value and your\nexternal sense of value which happens a\nlot in terms of the pace of social media\nimposter syndrome increases so imposter\nsyndrome is the gap between what you\nfeel you are and the way that the world\ntreats you\nso i also see imposter syndrome is more\ncommon at places like harvard and\nespecially places like harvard medical\nschool so the greater the external value\nthat society places on you the more\nlikely you are to experience imposter\nsyndrome\nso i think over time\nassuming that your growth starts to\nbecome somewhat linear at some point the\nimposter syndrome will slowly hopefully\nstart to fade\nthe second thing that you can do is kind\nof take a step back and like we were\nsort of saying like acknowledge that\nyour external value\ndoesn't actually correlate with your\ninternal value\nand that who you are is who you are and\njust because you blew up on twitch\ndoesn't mean that you know you're a\nspecial person that you're just a\nregular person and this kind of gets\nback to all that deserving stuff and\nlucky stuff and things like that and\nwhat i ultimately tend to find is that\nwhen people really work through this\nidea of what you're responsible for and\nwhat you deserve credit for is your\nactions not that your follower count\nwhich is separate from this idea that\nyou know obviously you can count you\nmake calculated decisions to like grow\nyour brand and things like that right so\nwe're not saying it's random but your\nfundamental sense of value does not get\ndetermined by\nyou know your following\nyeah and the more that you navigate that\ni think the better imposter syndrome\nwill get\nthe last thing is to accept yourself for\nbeing weak because then you don't have\nto be an imposter like you can just suck\nand that's okay and the moment that you\nbeing successful and sucking is\nhas the same weight for you imposter\nsyndrome won't be a thing\nyou look like you're about to say\nsomething\num\nno i was so present and listening to you\nthat whatever i was about to say is gone\ngreat\nokay yeah i guess it's like\nthe imposter syndrome thing i\nit's it's like a buzzword that you hear\nso often but i've never had it explained\nin a way where it's like\nyou know the way that you explain the\ndeficit and it definitely makes a lot\nmore sense\nfor me in that way like it that made\nsome things click for sure\nand so the way that i think about it is\npeople are treating you in a way that\nyou don't deserve you feel but you don't\nfeel you deserve to be treated right and\nthat's because you deserve to be treated\nthis way but this is the way that people\nare treating you and it's in that gap\nthat imposter some syndrome exists\nso if you detach from the idea that you\ndeserve to be treated a particular way\nthen you'll be fine too\nyeah\nyou can grow as a person\nyou can\ncave your viewership\nwhich in turn will not actually fix\nthings\nbecause you'll still feel like a failure\nyou just won't feel like an imposter\nsyndrome you won't get an imposter\nbecause they're treating you the way\nthat you know you deserve to be treated\nwhich is still negative and then you\nknow you can grow grow your internal\nsense of value over time and like you\nknow nice healthy real life\nrelationships where people where you\nexpress vulnerability and people value\nyou anyway because hey i know it's kind\nof weird sid you're allowed to be boring\nyou know\nno you're not that's no i could say it\nyou're like no i'm not that's fine it's\nit's hard to feel that way but i know i\nam it's just like uh\ni think on top of\nyou know like i have this job in\nentertainment essentially i'm like i\nnever want to come on stream and be\nboring but i don't want to be boring for\nlike my friends or the people around me\neither you know um but i know it's okay\nto be boring like if i just want to sit\non the couch all day and do nothing\nthat's okay\nit\nit's about it's okay for others\nyeah so we're gonna try one last thing\nso i i think you're right said like you\ndon't other people can be boring but\nlike you've got to be better than that\nyeah\nhow does that make you feel when i say\nthat\nother people can afford that you can't\nafford that\nwell yeah obviously it feels bad\ndoes it\ni mean\nit feels in line with the way that i\nfeel about myself but it's not something\nthat it's my fear that allows me to say\nthat to myself but i don't want to hear\nother people say it to me right because\nnow my fear is realized and you saying\nthat i'm not or like i can't be boring\nso that's kind of yeah it makes a lot of\nsense but i would say that something\nweird also happened is that you realized\nthe irrationality of your thoughts when\ni supported them\nyeah\nbecause you started calling it your fear\nright so when i start when i say oh like\nyou're allowed to be boring the voice in\nyour head pops up and resists it when i\nsay oh man it's like tough because like\nit sounds like you really can't afford\nto be boring\nand then you're like well\nthat doesn't make sense\nyeah even though it agrees so you see it\nyou see how that\nhappens yeah where like whatever like if\ni agree with you like your mind will\nnaturally pop up and defend against it\nand say that's my fear and that's\nactually progress so this is the first\ntime that you've taken that thought\nprocess and you've applied the\npossessive to it instead of saying i am\nyou said it's my fear\nliterally i think it's the first time in\nthe interview and that's actually how\nyou overcome it like something just\nshifted in your neurons where you\nyou own it now instead of it being true\ndoes that make sense you're\nexternalizing it as a fear which is good\ni feel like that became apparent to me\nwhen we were talking about my\ninsecurities and how they're like my\ninsecurities that i'm projecting and\nlike that's what i'm afraid of yeah and\nthat i didn't get it from shows and\nstuff like that so it so\nyeah so the cool thing about your\ninsecurities is that they're not truths\nthe problem with our insecurities we're\nafraid their truth but it's not it's\njust your insecurity you're just\ncarrying that around\nyou know yeah\ni think it's clear to me that you are\noh can i say this\ni was about to say awesome\nbut you can accept that right\nyeah\nokay so you're awesome we're agreed\ni i think i accept compliments well okay\nyes sure also i think you'd be great\neven if you weren't awesome\nthank you\nactually you know what you're you're not\ngreat all the time\nbut i'm still a big fan\nhow does that feel\nthat's fair yeah\nthat feels good\nall right well\num\ni sometimes teach meditation on stream\nare you interested in learning something\nor you want to\npause or\nkind of just bow out at this point or\nwhat i mean i'm down um the issue that\ni've had with like meditation and stuff\nlike that in the past is i don't um like\ni don't have any visual imagery and so\npeople are like i don't produce my own\nvisual imagery with that um fantasia get\nrid of it\nso people will be like oh like imagine a\nbeach or something like that i don't\nimagine it and so then i can't like\ndo that part of it but i'm down to hang\nout and and try\nwe're not gonna have you visualizing\nanything okay okay if i don't have to\nvisualize i'm cool wait you what is this\ncondition that you have is this like a\nmedical thing\nwell it's like not um it's something\nthat i heard about recently and it's not\nlike diagnosed or anything like that but\nit's a thing called a ontasia where you\ndon't\nlike my entire reality changed recently\nwhen i realized that other people see\nimagery in their head they like picture\nthey like\nyeah can actually picture things whereas\ni i can't at all\nokay so we're gonna we don't need you to\npicture anything i teach you meditation\nwithout imagery i i personally am not i\nactually wonder if maybe my problem with\nguided meditations because i don't do\nguided meditations\nand maybe it just occurred to me that\nmaybe the reason i don't is because i've\nnever been able to do them\ni wonder if i actually have the same\nthing\nyou should look it up\ndefinitely look it up because like i've\nalways liked i don't teach like you know\nmost of the meditation apps and stuff\nwill be like guided imagery meditation\nyes yes and i'm like this does nothing\nit does nothing for me\nso\nso we're okay so we're going to teach\nyou a very simple\nbreathing meditation it's going to be a\nfocusing meditation okay\nso i want you to raise your right hand\nspread out your fingers okay\nand then i want you to fold these two\nfingers down can you do that good and\nthen can you put these together\nokay uh hopefully this will work with\nyour nails you can close your nostrils\nwith your nails right\nyeah yeah okay so got it okay so what\nwe're going to do is sit up straight\nokay i'm going to t\nhuh\noh i was sitting criss crossed i put my\nfeet down\noh no you could say chris are you like\nyou were sitting cross-legged yeah yeah\nthat's just your back should be straight\nbut okay\nso i'm going to teach you a technique\ncalled nari shudi or nadi shodhana which\nmeans like it means cleansing of your\nenergy channels okay so we're gonna do\nis block our right nostril with our\nright thumb and breathe in through our\nleft\nhold the breath and switch\nand breathe out\nexcellent now breathe in for the same\nnostril\nswitch\nand breathe out\nin\nswitch\nout\ngood now close your eyes\nand continue at your own pace remember\nto breathe in\nand then switch with a full breath of\nair\nand then breathe out\nand then in through the same nostril\nswitch\nout\nbeautiful\nin again\nswitch\nout\nin\nswitch\nout\nyou're doing great we're gonna do three\nmore breaths in\nswitch\nout\nin\nswitch\nout\nand last one in\nswitch\nout\nexcellent now let your eyes stay closed\nlet your hand relax\ni want you to sit in this space\nsit in the experience of yourself\nnotice your breathing\njust be\nnotice that in this moment you are not a\nstrong independent black woman\nor a weak independent black woman\nyou're not even black and you're not\neven a woman\nyou're just you\nwhen you're ready\ngo ahead and come on back\nthat was nice i like breathing exercises\nwhat were you\nwhat was your experience like\ni don't i know it's kind of a weird\nquestion\num\nvery present i feel like\na lot of the time i'm living ahead of\nmyself or behind myself\nbut\nyeah being able to like practice\nbreathing and just\nfocus on my body and what i'm doing\nfeels very present\nwere you thinking things\nnot really i like was kind of\num like when you said just be in the\nmoment i was like i can't have a fan on\nso i was like hearing whirring which was\nnice and i just like felt very relaxed\nnot thinking about too much\nso this is so good job you've now\nmeditated\nso the interesting thing about\nmeditation is that it's the absence of\nthoughts that's really what we're\nshooting for\nso it's kind of weird but like you're\npresent you exist you're awake you're\nconscious but you're not thinking and\nit's normal for us to have thoughts here\nor there but like as we focus on the\npractice\nas we drive our attention towards a\nparticular thing the thinking will\nactually stop\nand so like now we're like thinking\nagain and so just keep doing that and as\nyou do that i think even like\ninsecurities and stuff will start to\nkind of like melt away because i don't\nknow if this makes sense but\neven in that brief moment you know if\nyou look at the middle of the practice\nlike you weren't emotionally unavailable\nyou weren't emotionally available none\nof those things actually existed you're\njust you\nright all that stuff is like crap that\nour mind makes it's like all these\ninsecurities we have and stuff like it's\nall function of the mind it's not\nactually who we are\nand so stepping outside of your mind\nfrom time to time can actually alleviate\nsome of the pressures of what our mind\nplaces on us like oh my god you have to\nbe better sid you have to be like you\nhave to be so good you can't be born\nlike no you can just be you just just\nwho you are you're great the way you are\neven with all your flaws\ncool\nany last thoughts or questions before we\nwrap up\num\nno i guess if this is goodbye i just\nwant to say thank you very much it's\nbeen great\ntalking with you and um yeah practicing\ni would say today i practiced being\nvulnerable for sure\nyes you did\nso i am i appreciate the guidance\ndefinitely yeah i and i appreciate\neverything about what you brought today\nand and i really\njust love the way that you know i think\nyou've been very introspective and you\nunderstand a lot of things so i think we\ncovered a lot of topics where usually we\njust focus on one thing but i think you\nknow it's clear that you've thought\nabout this stuff a lot\nand do you want to just tell us one last\ntime like where we can find you on the\ninternets and what you do\nah yeah um so you can find me pretty\nmuch on all socials under cityon i am a\ntwitch streamer but you know do other\nplatforms and everything play a lot of\nvalorent but other games too so yeah\nthat's kind of my deal\nyeah awesome and she's definitely not\nboring right\nyeah guys i'm not boring i swear\n[Laughter]\nwell thanks a lot soon and best of luck\nto you you know\ni'm rooting for you\nthank you i appreciate that a ton\nthanks a lot bye thank you bye-bye"
