    "transcript": "so\na lot of times um you know there's a lot\nof stuff about mental health psychiatry\nuh you know understanding\nthat we kind of talk about that\noftentimes\nthere's a lot of stuff about mental\nhealth and psychiatry that we don't\ncover very much on stream so what i'd\nreally like to do today is cover a\ncouple of other topics\nso today we're going to talk a little\nbit we have a great post from our\nsubreddit\nabout um\nbondage domination and sadomasochism\nand so we're going to take a quick look\nat that and i'm going to explain some\nbasics about how to understand like what\nis healthy and what is unhealthy okay\nso let's take a look is bdsm healthy\nso i'm making this post because i'm\nstruggling and i need some advice i've\nseen a lot of conflicting evidence\nsurrounding bdsm kink and mental health\ni i have a submissive kink and i feel\nshame for engaging with it i have this\ncycle where i can manage to move my mind\naway from the thoughts for a while until\ni feel like i can't take it anymore and\ni take action\ni don't know if what i'm doing is\ninherently bad or just part of who i am\ni've read that these kinks could be due\nto childhood trauma related to sex\ni can say this does map onto my\nexperience because i was molested as a\nchild i'm not sure what dr k or the\ncommunity point of view is\nthanks\ncontext i'm a heterosexual male\nso this is a fantastic post once again\num for a couple of reasons the first is\nthat this is like i really like the way\nthat this person is trying to figure out\nokay what is healthy what is illness\nwhat should i kind of do about it is\nthis because i was traumatized and i\nthink these are all like really really\ngood important questions to consider\nokay so we're gonna talk we're gonna do\nkind of a quick\nkind of run through of how i think about\nbdsm and what is like\nyou know healthy and what isn't healthy\nand stuff like that okay so what's an\nillness what's okay\nso the first thing to understand\nis that\nthe\npsychiatric attitudes\ntowards different kinds of sexualities\nhave changed a lot over time okay\nand so you know like back in dsm-3 which\nwas maybe in the 70s\nhomosexuality was considered an illness\nokay\nand then uh was a pathology\nand then like in dsm-4\num i think bdsm was considered an\nillness\nwas also considered pathological\nokay\nbut the interesting thing is as we've\nsort of started to learn a little bit\nmore about bdsm\nand this is one of the areas where\nthere's actually like very little\nresearch\num so we don't have a lot of good we\nhave like very few clinical trials or i\ni don't think i've ever seen a clinical\ntrial on like treating people with bdsm\nit's mostly things like case reports and\nlike observational studies so we don't\nreally understand the science of it very\nmuch\nbut in dsm-5 for example they sort of i\nthink they have an acknowledgement that\nyou know bdsm in mild forms\nis okay\nso let's try to understand like how do\nwe think about the classification of\nlike mental illness with bdsm\nso\nthe first thing that so we're going to\nkind of explore a couple of terms okay\nso one is going to be like a paraphilia\nor fetishism\nokay the second is going to be um so how\ndo we define this so fetishism is the\nuse\nof a\nnon-living object\nor\num\nnon-genital\nbody part\nfor sexual gratification\nokay so it's sort of like you know like\nshoes or feet like these are things that\nare not generally considered\nlike sexual organs and so like when\npeople are\nsexually aroused or use these objects\nfor sexual gratification\nthen that's what we call a fetish okay\nso this is what's what's kind of\ninteresting so there was a a a study\ndone in quebec\nthat sampled about a thousand people\nokay\nand what percentage of them do y'all\nthink had fetish fetishistic thoughts\nwhat do y'all think\nyeah so it's 50 to 60 percent\nwild chat okay\nso this is i i think i i think this was\nnot self-identified\nuh people who had a fetish or paraphilia\nbut 50 to 60\nof people were sexually aroused by a\nnon-living object or non-genital part of\nthe body okay\nso about\neight to ten percent\nwere like intensely aroused by a\nparticular thing so this is when we're\nprobably getting into\ntrue kind of more fetishism where like\npeople were like super into feet or\nwhatever\nand by the way a quick question\ndo you all know oh sorry sorry this is\nthis is wrong i got these statistics\nwrong\nthis is actually 45\nand so here's the next question of\npeople who have a fetish oh no it\ndoesn't it's not displaying i'm lagging\nso of people who have a fetish\ndo you guys know what percentage of them\nare into feet or sexually aroused by\nfeet\ni know the ipad's not updating it well\nit's just lagging\nit's actually fifty to sixty percent of\nwhat fetish\nisn't that wild\nokay so we'll see if i can get this\nback in but\num\ni'm not desktop okay so in the meantime\nokay here we go all right we're back\nokay\nso\nso eight to ten percent ha are intensely\nattracted to something okay\nand then um\n25\nactually 26\ntried it once\nand about 3.5\ndo it regularly\nokay so like fetishes are actually like\nremarkably common\num\nand so like this is not considered\nreally an illness okay\nso then there are a couple of other\nthings so let's talk about you know\num yeah so 50 to 60 this is the quebec\nstudy so once again we don't know if\nthis is like\nthis is all people or just maybe people\nin quebec are super in defeat we don't\nknow okay\nso now like if we think about you know\nhow do we define an illness an illness\nis really defined as something that\nimpairs function\nokay so this is where when we kind of\nthink about it there's like a there's\nthere's a you know fetishistic disorder\nso what happens here is like their\nfetish is so powerful\nthat um and we'll get to this a little\nbit later their fetish is like so\ndominating that for example when they\nhave\nproblems when they have sex with a\npartner their partner will feel like\nthey actually are not having sex with\nlike a partner they'll feel like the\nthe you know the person with the fetish\nis just like using them as like an\nobject it's kind of hard to describe\nbut you know with patients that i've\nworked with um and we'll get to this in\na second but\nyou know with patients that i work with\nlike what the partner will describe is\nlike they don't feel like you know they\nfeel like if i'm if i'm the partner and\nmy partner has a fetish what i'll just\nwhat i'll hear people say is that oh you\nknow the person with the fetish isn't\nhaving sex with me they're just like\nusing my feet like they'll use language\nlike that so at that point for example\nit's creating a problem within the\nrelationship and so therefore can be\nqualified as a disorder right because\nthen it's impairing function other\nexamples of fetishistic disorder is you\nknow people are engaging in the behavior\nin a way that like is non-consensual or\nlike you know impacts other people\nso for example um you know like\nrubbing genitalia against like people in\npublic places i think is called\nfrauderism and so that's another example\nof a disorder because you know that's\nsomething that is like sexual assault\nand if you like engage in that or you\nhave thoughts that you really want to do\nthat kind of thing then it's really\ngoing to get you in trouble and so\ntherefore we sort of classify it as a\ndisorder okay\nso next thing um is so then there's also\nsexual sadism disorder\nso sexual sadism disorder is when\nsomeone\nis kind of defined as the recurrent and\nintense arousal to inflict physical or\nphysiological suffering on another\nperson\nso this is like where the intent\nis to create suffering and this is going\nto be really important\nokay\nso it's kind of interesting so if you\nlook at statistics the overwhelming\nnumber of people who get diagnosed with\nsexual sadism disorder are men so it's\nmale predominant\nand um\nyou know there are some associations\nwith trauma and we'll kind of get to\nthat a little bit more but like\nso trauma is kind of tricky let's just\ntalk about it now so like what's the\nrelationship between you know sexual\nfetishes and trauma the short answer is\nlike we're not sure\nso it does appear that people who are\ntraumatized\num\ni think\nyou know there is a link between trauma\nand some amount of like sexual stuff\nbut i don't think the i haven't reviewed\nthe evidence very well i don't think the\nevidence is is really that\ncompelling yet i think there are a lot\nof questions that we need to ask the\nresearch is just poorly done so for\nexample you know\ni haven't seen any studies that look at\nhealthy members of the bdsm community\nand ask them how many of you were like\nsexually abused\ni have also haven't seen studies with\npeople who are who are vic victims of\nlike sexual abuse and ask them you know\ndo you are or like do you have fetishes\nright so like i'm sure you all can\nunderstand hopefully you can understand\nthat those are like like really\ndifficult questions or arguably even\nlike inappropriate questions to ask a\npatient with trauma right like if\nsomeone comes in and says yeah i was\nsexually molested at the age of eight\nand as a provider like it's it's it's\nvery difficult to ask a question like oh\nyou know what do you get sexually\naroused by like that's it's a very like\nit's a hard question to ask\nthere's even evidence for example that\num\nlike there are a lot of clinical\nconsiderations that come into play when\ntreating like bd people who engage in\nbdsm some of them\nreally demonstrate like so this paper\ntalks about a lot of\nconcerns that you know practitioners\nwill judge people who are into bdsm\npractitioners will think that bts bdsm\nis a consequence of sexual trauma which\nin turn is like incredibly val\ninvalidating right so if like if someone\ncomes in and has a sexual preference\nlike let's think about homosexuality for\na second and if i as a provider say oh\nif you're gay because you were you know\nassaulted like that can be like very\nvery like invalidating to the person so\na lot of like challenges in a clinical\nsetting and in a research setting for us\nto really get good answers on this but\nat the same time i still think we can\nlearn a lot today okay so the people who\nare traumatized we don't the short\nanswer is like i don't know so i tend to\ntreat people with disorders and trauma\nlike i don't really tie the two together\ni may assess them with trauma just\nbecause i uh for trauma because i assess\nall my patients for trauma but i try to\nlike treat them as kind of like their\nown unique thing and i don't draw\ncorrelations with trauma\nthere may be evidence out there i'm not\nan expert on trauma and sexual fetishes\nso\nso be it okay so these are the two\ndisorders that i sort of think about\nwhen it comes to bdsm so then we get to\nactual bdsm\nright so and this is where like for\nexample the the icd-10\nwhich is the international\nclassification of diseases\nactually classifies bdsm is still as a\ndisorder we're up to icd-11 now\nand so i think it's changed a little bit\nbut i think generally speaking this will\nclassify it as a disorder\nbut it's kind of changing so here's the\nkey thing so if you're if you're\ninterested in bdsm and you're trying to\nfigure out you know do i have an illness\ndo i not have an illness here's the key\nthing so in people who engage in healthy\nbdsm relationships\nthey kind of inflict\npain\nas a source of pleasure\ni know it sounds kind of weird okay\nso when i when i have an someone in my\noffice and they're they're asking me\nliterally like am i ill like what i'll\nwhat i'll ask them is like what's the\ngoal\nof the bdsm relationship\nlike so because usually what happens in\nhealthy bdsm relationships is you've got\na you know\na\ndominator and you've got a submissive\nperson and they both kind of agree to\nthat right because like the submissive\nperson can get sexual gratification out\nof being submissive and the dominator\ngets sexual gratification out of being\ndominating and so you kind of pair up\nand the goal of the behaviors is to\npleasure both parties right so like i'm\ngoing to dominate you you're going to be\nthe submissive or you're going to be\ndominating me i'm going to be the\nsubmissive and the goal of that like the\nreason that we're engaging in this is so\nthat both of us can have fun\nso when i really think about bdsm and\nwe'll get to some statistics here so it\nseems like\num you know so the way i kind of\ndescribe it is like they seek to provide\npleasure along with the pain or\nhumiliation or the pain or humiliation\nis actually an avenue to like pleasure\nand satisfaction\nokay so that's what i kind of think of\nin terms of healthy bdsm and with sexual\nsadism disorder the goal isn't to\npleasure the person in the end it's to\nactually like hurt the other person\nso the goal here ultimately for bdsm or\nhealthy bdsm i'd say is pleasure and the\ngoal for the disorder is to actually to\ncreate suffering like you're trying to\nhurt someone\nokay\nand so let's go through a little bit of\num kind of statistics about the bdsm is\nis a non-clinical entity so the\ninteresting thing is that men tend to\nhave urges for bdsm starting at less\nthan 15 years old on average\nwomen on the other hand sort of\nrecognize their bdsm urges\num usually post puberty so once they're\nfully sexually mature like women will\nstart to have like more bdsm thoughts\nokay\num the average person\nwho sort of recognizes that they're into\nbdsm and sort of fully sort of gets it\nactually happens in their mid-20s\nso what we kind of see is that like real\ninsight happens like in their mid-20s so\nlike what you'll see is i guess\nstatistically you know you'll have like\na 14 year old kid who sort of gets\naroused like maybe watches pornography\nthat's like a little bit rough\nand then\nfor a woman what you'll tend to see is\nthat you know they'll start to have like\nmore thoughts like that\nafter they're they're done with puberty\nand then like by the time you're mid-20s\nlike you kind of know whether you're\ninto bdsm or not\nand so then kind of\nso that's kind of how i think about bdsm\nso i think that\num i want to say that one to two percent\nof the population\nis into bdsm based on some natural\nsurveys it may be as high as three\npercent we're not really sure but it\nseems like it's a normal sexual variant\nis kind of how i classify it unless it\nis crossing into the realm of impairing\nfunction\nor really has the intent to like create\nsuffering\nand people may be kind of confused by\nthis and they may say like what does it\nmean to inflict pain as a source of\npleasure\nso the best analogy i actually have here\nso if we think about negative\nexperiences right let's so we think\nabout pain or fear so let's like think\nabout fear as an analogy generally\nspeaking fear is not desired\nright you don't want to be afraid\nbut\nevery year at halloween\na group of people pay money\nto get scared and find the experience\npleasurable and that's what we call a\nhaunted house\nright so haunted houses are good\nexamples\nof like willingly engaging in what\nappears to be like a negative experience\nfor the sake of pleasure and it's lots\nof fun\nso i'm you know hopefully i'm not\noffending anyone who's into bdsm or\nanything like that but i think that we\nhave to remember that like for some\npeople who don't understand this it can\nbe really confusing that pain would be a\nsource of pleasure or shame would be a\nsource of pleasure right if you're a\nsubmissive person\nand you want to be humiliated like how\ncan someone have fun being humiliated\nlike what the what's that about and so\ni'd ask the question how can someone\nhave fun being afraid and when i'm\ntalking to people who don't understand\nthat i find that the haunted house\nanalogy actually works really well\nbecause it explains to people oh yeah\nlike i you know i can understand how\nlike being afraid is actually like can\nbe fun so in the case of bdsm what we\ntend to see is that there's shame\nhumiliation\npain\ndomination\neven like you know controlling people so\nthese are like emotions or experiences\nthat generally speaking or classified as\nnegative\nbut when you engage in a consensual\nhealthy relationship that's like secure\nwith another person they can actually be\nlike\npleasurable and completely okay right\nand so haunted houses are an analogy of\nthat\nthere are other examples i'm sure you\ncan think of you know where like you\nknow in relationships like you and your\npartner may like try to scare each other\nright and that's like kind of fun kind\nof not fun you know whatever\num\nso now let's talk a little bit about you\nknow like kind of clinical presentation\nand like as a psychiatrist like\nwhat do i see\nso the first thing\nis you know if you guys are concerned\nabout where you are on the spectrum i\nwould say by all means go see a licensed\nmental health professional and have them\nhelp you sort it out because that's what\nwe're here for right we're here to help\nyou sort out is this a problem is this\nnot a problem\nso i'd say that people tend to present\nto my office in a couple of ways one is\nthat they unfortunately\nthey get into trouble\ni unfortunately have seen my fair share\nof this\nwhere people are coming in because\neither a court is mandating it or you\nknow like they did something at school\nthat they weren't supposed to do or like\nyou know like they they're just doing\nsomething that they really weren't\nsupposed to do so they get into trouble\nand either some authority figure or some\ninstitution or someone close in their\nlife basically like forces them to come\nthe second reason that people\npresent and so by the way if it gets you\ninto trouble it's more likely to be\nclassified as a disorder because it is\ncausing you real life consequences\nsecond reason that people come in his\npartner is uncomfortable\nand so like i mentioned earlier so like\na lot of this is like comes from the\npartner where the partner's like you\nhave this kink\nthey'll judge the person with the kink\nand they'll say you need to go get\nmental health help because you are a\nsicko right so the partner's\nuncomfortable with particular things\num sometimes it'll be judgmental\nsometimes it won't be judgmental\nsometimes it'll be an actual problem\nright so this is this is a case where\nthe patient\nhas\nmore interest\nin\nthe fetish\nthan the partner\nso what that sort of means is like the\npartner of the patient\nsort of feels like objectified and it's\nthey don't feel like you know they're\nhaving sex with a partner they feel like\nthey're being like used in some way\nand then the third i actually never seen\na case of this now that i think about it\nthe third reason is that you know a\npatient could self-present with concerns\ni've just never\nyou know\num no one i've never had someone with\nbdsm self-present i've had people\nself-present with concerns about you\nknow sexual orientation i've had people\nself-present with concerns about um you\nknow sex addiction or porn addiction or\nthings like that but then the third you\nknow option is that someone shows up\nwhich maybe some of y'all will do now if\nyou're you're concerned you'll go seek\nmental health help and then you'll try\nto figure out you know what's what's\ngood and what isn't\nwhen it comes to sort of trying to\nfigure out so once someone shows up in\nmy office there's a series of kind of\nquestions that i'll i'll ask right so\ni'll ask like when did it start\nyou know is there any kind of trauma\ninvolved\nyou know like like you know how much\nhow intense is it\nright so these are like questions that\nyou know will sort of help me understand\nokay so if you've got a foot fetish like\nare you able to engage in sexual\nactivity without feet and you can still\nor and you're just kind of turned on by\nfeet or is it something that like unless\nthere are feet involved you can't really\nengage in sex at all so we'll sort of\nask questions like you know the\nintensity of it\num you know is it disruptive in some way\neither in terms of your relationships or\nthings like that\ndo you have trouble concentrating so\nlike concentration relationships you\nknow there are all kinds of ways that it\ncan be disruptive\nso has it negatively impacted your\nrelationships\nare do you have trouble like going about\nyour day because you are obsessing about\nthis i have seen actually cases of ocd\nmasquerading as sexual fetishes before\nthat's really interesting so it's not\nreally a sexual fetish fetish but it's\nan obsessive\nintrusive unwanted thought\nwhich is actually ocd it's not a sexual\nfetish at all they're not actually\naroused by it they just keep thinking\nabout it\nand then a lot of times with you know\nwith the clinical presentation we see a\nlot of stuff like shame\nwhat right so like like the the person\nwho posted\nthey feel ashamed for having these kinds\nof thoughts\nand so in terms of how to work with\nthese people you know i i think a big\npart of it is like asking some of these\nquestions and sort of determining okay\ndoes it negatively impact your life in\nsome way yes or no\nnext thing to kind of think about is is\nthis something that you can engage with\nwith a partner for the sake of mutual\npleasure\nand once you find a partner and you guys\nkind of talk things out you sort of\nfigure out okay what are our safe words\nand stuff like that if you're in a\nhealthy secure relationship where you\ncan experiment with someone and you know\nthe purpose of engaging in these\nbehaviors is for sexual gratification of\nboth of the parties involved then i i\nwould call that just a healthy normal\nvariant of sexual relations it's kind of\ninteresting because just as i was\npreparing for this i looked at the\nwikipedia page for bdsm and it was\nreally interesting to see like you know\ncave art from like the 5th century bce\nof like you know bondage and domination\nand things like that right so like\nhistorically humans have been into this\nstuff for like thousands of years\nand so\nin terms of going back to this actual\nperson\nyou know this is what i'd recommend is\nthat you know i have a submissive kink\nand i feel shame for engaging with it so\nthis i think is something that you\nshould work on changing so having a\nsubmissive kink is one thing but\nremember that the goal here is not for\nyou to feel ashamed about yourself for\nhaving the kink\nit is for you to engage in the shame for\nthe purpose of like enjoyment\nright so if you feel ashamed about a\nparticular sexual practice\nthen i would encourage you to go see a\ntherapist this is something that i'm not\nsure that our coaches you know they\nhaven't gotten any training in this kind\nof stuff so i'd see an actual therapist\nfor this\nand so that what what i'm kind of seeing\nhere is that i have the cycle where you\nknow i can manage to move my mind away\nfrom the thoughts but then you know they\nget control of me so like this doesn't\nsound healthy to me\nright where you're pushing something out\nof your mind and then it forces itself\nback in\nfor the the people who i've worked with\nwho are in healthy bdsm relationships\nit's it's like a part of their day or\ntheir week that they enjoy to engage in\nyou know they're kind of like looking\nforward to it at the end of the week um\neven people with a submissive kink who\nare into being humiliated\nlike\nyou know before and after they feel good\nabout it right so they're like really\nlooking forward to it and they'll engage\nwith their partner and they'll you know\nlike you know go down to the dungeon\nthat they have in their basement they'll\ndo some like really solid bdsm and then\nthey'll like you know go to bed and the\nnext morning it's like pancakes with\nstrawberries and chocolate chips\nright so it's like part of a lifestyle\nthat's like sort of like is healthy\nright\nso i'd say if if\nyou know feeling shame is part of your\nkink and part of the way that you engage\nin pleasure\nthere seems to be you know the current\nprevailing thinking in my personal\nopinion is that that is probably a\nvariant of normal sexual activity\nif you're feeling shame about the way\nthat you feel\nor\nyou know what sexually gratifies you is\nnot pleasuring another person through\nkind of shame and humiliation but if\nyour actual intent is to like hurt\nsomeone and you mean them like malice\nright like if you're malicious and you\nreally want to like hurt someone then i\nreally\nyou know get more concerned about a\ndisorder\nonce again you know this is definitely a\nsituation where like the goal of this is\nnot to diagnose or treat anything you\nknow i haven't listed out diagnose for\npeople who are curious what does\ndiagnosing this actually look like you\nknow for each of these things that i'm\nsort of sharing each of these has\ndiagnostic criteria right so there's\nlike a set of questions that you have to\ncheck certain boxes and then you will\nmeet diagnostic criteria or you wouldn't\nmeet diagnostic criteria how people\nanswer all of these questions and i ask\nmany many more will ultimately be how\nyou form a diagnosis so the goal of this\nstream is not to diagnose anyone and\nwhat i mean by that is like nothing you\nlearned on this stream is sufficient for\nyou to diagnose yourself because the\nprocess of diagnosis is actually like a\nmore complicated in-depth and thorough\nprocess where you do have to talk about\nokay what's the role of trauma is this\nsexual sadism disorder or is this the\nresult of some kinds of emotions that\nhave come out of trauma so that's like a\ngood example of like a good diagnostic\nprocess that you need to work through\nwith a clinician the real goal is just\nto explain to people okay so like is\nbdsm healthy like what's up with that\nwhat what is healthy what is unhealthy\nwhat is what do those buckets kind of\nlook like and if that seems kind of\ninteresting to you or important to you\ni'd really recommend you that you go see\na licensed mental health professional\nquestions\num\nyeah so i you know for people kind of\nsaying interesting stream\nso\nyeah so there's actually uh there i saw\na study i have i thought i had a\nreference let me see if it's\num\nso maybe this one\ni'm not sure if this is the study\nbut i think this one\nin the background of this paper that i\njust linked i think they actually do\npoint out that there's evidence that uh\ncouples who engage in bdsm are happier\nthan couples who don't\nnot saying that everyone should engage\nin bdsm but and i forget exactly what\nthe population was that may be like\ncouples that engage in bdsm where one\npartner wants to are happier than than\nin in other situations so that's\nsomething where you definitely want to\nlook at the population\nright so remember anytime you're looking\nat a scientific study\nthe result\nis not the only important thing the\npopulation that you're studying is the\nonly is like just as important right\nso\nthere are all kinds of results and this\nis the problem with like media media\nwill just share the results they won't\ntell you what population you're looking\nat so if i were to make the statement\nyou know couples that engage in bdsm are\nhealthier than couples who don't\nbut the population matters are we\ntalking about all people are we talking\nabout people who are interested in it so\npeople who because a lot of these\nstudies what they'll do is they'll ask\npeople who self-identify\nis having a fetish and then they'll\nsample them so if if you take couples\nwho self-identify as having a fetish\nthen you look at which ones engage in\nbehavior and which ones don't what you\nfind is that people who engage in\nbehavior are happier than people who\ndon't but you're talking about everyone\nwho wants to right so that's that's\nuh important distinction and at this\npoint i'm just rusty on you know which\npart because like these studies are like\nthere's no uniformity so it's like\nreally hard to remember which study was\nlooking at what population\num\nare people or more people into the\nfantasy of bdsm than engaging in it\nfifty shades of grey so like we said\nright so i think the quebec study was\nsampling everyone and that's what's so\ninteresting about that study is that 44\npercent of people voice to desire so i\nthink it makes sense why 50 shades of\ngrey like took off so much right because\nthere's like nearly half of the\npopulation is like interested in kinks\nin some way\nand then the person was asking are more\npeople interested in engaging it and\nthen like like i said so 44 of people\nseem interested in some kind of fetish\n26 of people have tried it once and like\nthree percent engage in it regularly so\nsort of makes sense right so like fifty\nshades of grey was like there's a\nthere's forty four percent of people are\nlike sort of into it\num\nuh\nyeah\nso then the other thing that i really\ndidn't get into with this conversation\nis you know there are a lot of like\ntheories of psychotherapy like freud for\nexample thought that you know all kinds\nof sexual desires were like you know\nmanifest in weird ways or weird\nchildhood\nexperiences early in childhood would\nmanifest his particular sexual desires\nyou know sexuality and like edible\ncomplexes and like erotic drives and all\nthat kind of stuff\nyou know that's very well represented in\nin psychodynamic theory\nit's not something i'm an expert in and\nit's not something that i've seen great\ndata about so like i think you can have\nall the theories you want is you know\nthe question is like what about the data\num\nand and so from a clinical perspective i\nthink those can be really useful\nso i sometimes think that you know big\npart of\nfreud's emphasis on sexuality\nhad more to do with freud than it did\nwith psychotherapy or psychoanalysis\nisn't freud regarded as 99 wrong i don't\nthink that that's a fair way to regard\nfreud i think what's happened so freud\nactually gets a bad rap so here's what\nhappened with freud\nthe stuff that freud was was right about\nhas become such a common part of\nthinking that we don't even credit it\nfor him so any time that you use the\nword subconscious or you think about the\nsubconscious as a concept that's\nsomething that freud should probably get\ncredit for in terms of popularizing that\nidea so what happened with freud is like\nhis major contributions and the reason\nthat people like respect him so much is\nbecause he's the first guy that really\nlaid out the idea that we have a mind\nthat has a conscious component and like\na not conscious component and that some\nof the things that you do consciously\nare driven by things that you're not\naware of that central concept which has\nbeen revolutionary for the field of\npsychology like you think about you know\neverything that we talk about you think\nabout like you know so much stuff about\nsubconscious why do we tilt oh it's\nbecause subconsciously this this this\nlike freud gets some props for that\nright because he's the one who really\npopularized that concept the other thing\nis that freud was quite prolific so i\ndon't know like percentage-wise i'd say\nthat most of probably most of what he\nwrote is like not widely regarded but\nthe thing is he he really\nhe really knocked one out of the park\nlike he really like struck the jackpot\nonce with a major concept\nthat i think we've all sort of like\ninternalized and accepted as a society"
