    "transcript": "so welcome hutch\ncan you\nstart by telling us a little bit about\num what kind of\nyou know stuff you do on the interwebs\nand where we can find you\nsure yeah so typically if you just\nsearch hutch on most of the platforms\nyou should find me there's another hutch\nout there i'm sorry to disappoint some\npeople in your chat my chat was saying\nthat\nsome people in your chat was were\nexpecting another hutch who does gta rp\nthat's unfortunately not me but i\nstarted doing video stuff with video\ngames and youtube\nin 2008 uh when there were no\ngamers that were doing it for money so\nback then we were like the the original\npeople that were doing it it was just a\nhobby\ny'all are the ogs\nyeah some people will call me an og sure\nyeah and then um\npeople figured out that if you can get\nenough people to watch it then you can\nmake money doing it and sort of the rest\nis history but\nsince then i've sort of\ngone through like i've had to reinvent\nmyself a couple times i'm a little bit\nolder now and um so you know i dabble in\npolitical coverage as well as video game\nstuff and more recently i've started a\npodcast of my own discussing mental\nhealth best practices with other\ncreators\noh wow that's that's been a ton of fun\nand um uh you know i try to advocate for\nfor people to take care of themselves\nand be open about their struggles and\nthat's something i always have done with\nthe platform that i have so i reached\nout to you thinking like it would just\nbe such a great uh idea to sit down and\nget a chance to talk to you cool so um\ncan you tell me a little bit more about\nthe podcast or tell us a little bit more\nabout the podcast\num yeah it's just uh it's just this\npodcast like i call it fitter happier\nit's a that's a radiohead song and\nthere's some lyrics behind that that\nmakes sense but no it's just i bring in\nother creators and and i you know i try\nto make it clear that i'm not a\ntherapist and so and this isn't therapy\nand uh you know that if they have any\nquestions they should if any viewers\nhave any questions they should\ndefinitely consult a professional and uh\nand then we just talk about people's\nvarious struggles uh\nmore specifically as it pertains to\ncontent creation because there's this\nexpectation that you're always supposed\nto be on you're always supposed to be\nhappy and funny um\nand i'm trying to challenge that as much\nas i can because i think that that can\nlead to bad outcomes sometimes\nyeah can you explain that a little bit\nsure i just think that\num it's easy to get lost in your online\npersona when you do this for a living\nthat's happened to me a couple of times\ni've struggled with\nsort of a sense of identity of who i was\nand uh there were different times where\ni was letting the kind of person that i\nwould become\nwhile recording content i was sort of\nletting that take over\nuh most of my personality\nuh and that person wasn't very likable\nto me when i when it when i would stop\nand think about it\nand so\num yeah i would say that that issues of\nidentity and kind of keeping a solid\nfoundation of who i am has been\nsomething that i've struggled with and\nit's gotten a lot better for me recently\nbut\nit's it's it's been my downfall a couple\na couple different times\nand is so hutch did you thanks so much\nfor sharing man like there's so much\nthere that i would love to talk to you\nabout\num\ni wanted to just uh kind of clarify a\ncouple things so\nwhat do you think would be like a good\nuse of our time today like do you want\nto talk about\nyou know what you sort of learned\nrunning the podcast uh kind of like\ntalking about content creation or were\nyou hoping to have or do you think it\nwould be more productive have a little\nbit more of a personal conversation\nbecause i'm super curious about your\nexperience of you know figuring out who\nyou are and sort of getting lost\nin your identity and and things like\nthat\ni think the latter would be the better a\nbetter um way to spend this time of of\ndiscussing uh the personal stuff i don't\nknow if i have too much of an interest\nin discussing like the podcast stuff\nokay cool can you hold on just one\nsecond uh my producer is calling me\nbecause much like you i'm i'm a little\nbit of a boomer\nand i use this thing called a telephone\nall good\nhey what's up\nyeah sure\nno no thanks\nokay i had your volume too\noh i see so it's been fixed now um and\nso i thought maybe it was your producer\ntelling you that you got the wrong hatch\nno i think i think we love the hutch\nthat we got whether right or wrong\num\nand and so\njust to clarify is your understanding\nthat what we're doing if we're going to\nhave a personal conversation is your\nunderstanding that you kind of mentioned\non your podcast that you kind of say\nconsult a professional do you think that\nwhat we're doing today is therapy\num not in the strictest sense of the\nword i wouldn't say okay\num\nso what what do you think we are gonna\ndo today\nwell just to clarify i i have my own\ntherapist and so like i understand that\nthe sessions that i have with that\ntherapist are going to be um\ncomprehensive and long-term and that\nsort of thing and i understand that this\nis just a conversation so okay um\ni'm sorry i forgot your question what\nwas it again oh that's fine so i i'm\nkind of curious so\nyou um\nmentioned like i was really intrigued by\nwhat you said about like loss\nuh you sort of lost your sense of\nidentity and sort of had trouble\nfiguring out kind of who you are\ncan you tell me a little bit about that\nyeah you know i think\nif i go all the way back to when i was a\nkid i struggled with um relating to my\npeers getting along with my peers i was\nvery\nsocial very very naturally hyper-social\nwhen i was a young young kid i would\nwalk up and introduce myself to\nstrangers and\ni was just very curious about the world\nand then when i got into uh second grade\ni went to like a private catholic school\nand that was in that catholic school\nthrough\nuh 12th grade\nit took me a long time to connect with\nmy peers i was sort of ostracized and\nteased and that kind of thing and what i\nfigured out at some point was if i can\nmake them laugh then i can sort of get\ninto the in-crowd\nand so i\ni didn't realize it but i was sort of\nmodeling my personality back then based\non what other people thought of me\nand i wasn't really spending a lot of\ntime with my own self and you know\ncultivating the things within me that i\nliked um\nand uh by the time i got to adulthood\njust\ngenerally speaking that was very\nconfusing\nbecause i didn't know who i was and uh\nthat that question terrified me\nwhat was scary about that question\nwell imagine thinking that\nyou have an idea of who you are and then\nall of a sudden something comes along\nand challenges that\nuh it it just feels like the rug is\npulled out from underneath you all of a\nsudden it felt like i didn't know how to\ninteract with people i didn't know how\nto\nexist in the world and so like really\nsmall and mundane things like an\ninteraction with a barista at starbucks\nprovoked a ton of anxiety for me like\njust everything was overwhelming\num\ncan you help me understand that\num\nit's kind of i mean\ni don't know how else to explain it i\nmean everything i was just afraid all\nthe time it was fear was uh my god fear\nfear was a very um\npresent\nconstantly every waking moment of the\nday i was consumed with fear holy [ __ ]\ndude that sounds terrible\noh yeah it was tough it was real tough\nyeah\nhow did that start\num well back then i was\nuh\ni was abusing\nuh marijuana like uh quite a bit\nuh to the point where i you know i went\nfrom being on the dean's list my first\nsemester to\nalmost failing out my second semester of\ncollege uh\nso it was for me at the time it was\nhelping me to just sort of cope with\nthings i was still having fun i was\nstill like\nyou know having a good time with life\nand then uh after a while\nmarijuana would provoke uh really\nintense panic attacks\ni think that's what really kicked it off\nlike i would i would have these\nconversations with myself\nuh when i was high and those\nconversations i didn't i didn't have any\ngood answers to the things that i was\nasking myself and so i would invent\nthese horrible things about myself\nto sort of explain you know why i was\nhaving a hard time so i just i would i i\nbecame like a bad person in my own mind\ni thought i was a monster can can you um\ni'm having trouble envisioning\nwhat you were saying to yourself and\nbecause it sounds like you were trying\nto make sense of something\nright you were coming your mind was\ngenerating hypotheses\nto explain your situation so can you\nhelp us understand a little bit about\nlike what kind of situation would you\nkind of come up with some sort of answer\nfor or understanding\num it's hard to go back and remember the\nspecifics honestly mostly it was just\nnonsense like i you know\nif i had a if i had a\nawkward interaction with a girl or\nsomething like that well that meant that\ni was\nyou know forever going to be this\nawkward weirdo mess and i was just\ndoomed to be\nlike that forever\nand you can apply that you can imagine\napplying that to all different types of\nthings but if i could give you like one\nexample that would be like one example\nthat i would give you of a story that i\nwould tell myself\nto sort of try to make sense of\nwhy i was struggling so much\nit wasn't that i had gone through hard\nstuff as a kid and and i was just having\ndifficulty sort of\nunraveling all that when i was an adult\nit was oh i'm just this fundamentally\nbad person i'm i'm crazy i felt like i\nthought i was going to lose my mind i\nbecame convinced that i was going to\neventually just lose my mind\nhow did you get become convinced that\num well i mean just\nif you can if you can imagine just\nfeeling afraid all the time and like\nwhat that would do to your thought\nprocess you're not really going to have\na lot of like rational thoughts when\nyou're in a place of\ntotal fear\nlike my body was was releasing\nadrenaline and cortisol as if i was\nbeing chased by a tiger in the in the in\nthe you know rain forest or something\nbut it was like that all the time for\nfor no\nuh\nrational reason it was none of it was\nrational\nand did it seem rational at the time\nyeah i firmly believed it yeah\noh hutch\nso first of all i i really um i think\nthere's a lot of good that can come out\nof this conversation and part of that is\nbecause\ni can tell that you've grown a lot\nand and so i think what could be really\nillustrative is\num\nas we sort of explore\nwhere you were and how you got to where\nyou are i think it could actually give\npeople a road map\nwho are like where you were maybe years\nago um but i want to ask you is there\nsomething in particular that you kind of\nwanted to talk about or anything that\nthat maybe i could help you with\nanything you're curious about given\nyeah so i i knew that you would ask this\nquestion because i saw that you you\nstart these sessions by asking that same\nquestion\nand i've been sort of grappling a little\nbit with uh like what i wanted to talk\nabout i mean i can tell you that\nuh i had a sister pass away about a year\nago and i was there for\nthe last week of her life um i was there\nlike with her you know me and my family\ntook care of her as she was dying\nand that has had a really profound\nimpact on me and it's sort of triggered\nsimilar\nfeelings of confusion about my identity\nbecause\nwhen it actually happened it felt like i\nwas entering this\nnew phase of my life like it felt like i\nwas a different person after\nthat experience happened because it was\nuh you know if you can and i'm sure many\npeople can just imagine how difficult\nthat would be so um that's been\nsomething that's been\nchallenging for me recently and this is\nsomething that you've talked about uh\nwith your therapist is aware of this\nyeah okay\nyeah um sure so\nlet me just can i think for a second\nsure yeah i mean the the grief part\nitself is pretty i think straightforward\nat this point for me but it it that that\nexperience sort of relates to this other\nsort of broader issue of identity\nand um and and and my difficulties with\nthat so\ni just wanted to clarify that yeah i\nthink i i think i i took that away from\nwhat you said\num yeah\nso\nhow can you can you just explain that a\nlittle bit so\nwhat happened to your sense of identity\nwhen\nyour sister passed away\nhow did you start to think about\nyourself\nwell there was a lot of guilt because uh\nshe was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer\nat the end of 2019\nuh which has a very high mortality rate\nas many uh-huh many of you viewers\nprobably know it's 95 percent of people\nthat get it die\nand uh\ni had all these plans of going up and\nthey lived in the she lived in the bay\narea or the rest of my family i had all\nthese plans of going up and spending\ntime with her every month and then you\nknow a couple months later the pandemic\nstarted\nand so i didn't get to spend a lot of\ntime with her um for her last year\nso i feel quite a bit of guilt about\nthat um i wish i would have\nsaid mortar uh during that time\nokay\num and so that\nhas led me to feel\na lot of guilt and so that's been\nsomething that's uh\nyou can you can kind of get lost in that\nguilt i think so yeah\nso\num\nlet me just so hutch i'm tempted to ask\nyou a question which i think will\nuh\nadvance the conversation but i'm\nconcerned that it may not be\na nice question or may evoke some\nnegative emotion\nwhat do you think we should do\ni'm okay with being challenged that way\nokay\nso let me ask you this so it sounds like\nyour sister was diagnosed with\npancreatic cancer and you know you're\nright it has a very high mortality rate\num\nand so you had plans to visit her and\nthen the pandemic hit\nand then you spent the last week with\nher so i'm kind of curious what kind of\nperson\ndoesn't vis visit their terminally ill\nsister with cancer\nthe year before they die\nuh well i think that could be like a\nreally broad question because i think a\nlot of people could have different\nreasons for not doing that\nin this case it was i was asked not to\ncome\nso it wasn't like i was choosing not to\ncome it was she was already sick and\nthey were taking the pandemic very\nseriously and\nso was i so\nso then why are they guilt\nuh well\ni could have picked up the phone more\num\nand i didn't know what to say to her to\nmake\nher feel better and um\nand i think a part of me avoided picking\nup the phone and i think that's where i\nfeel the most amount of guilt okay it's\nnot like we didn't it's not like we\ndidn't talk and there was also a large\nstretches where she was very sick and\ncouldn't pick up the phone even if she\nwanted to\nbut it's just something that i think\nabout there was just so much that i\nwanted to say and i also didn't want to\nremind her that she was dying\nso i i had no idea how to\nhave that conversation with her\nsorry\nsometimes when things get really morbid\ni just\ni i laugh because if i don't laugh i'll\ncry\num\nso i know it sounds kind of weird but\nwhat what do you say you feel guilty\nabout not calling her or not knowing\nwhat to say or\nuh both yeah um\ni\nyeah both um i wish when she was\nmuch more lucid and much more\ncapable of having those phone calls i\nwish i would have used the phone more i\nwish i would have called her every night\num\nand it and it took me going up there and\nseeing her\ndeteriorating to\nrealize that i\nthat the mistake that i had made um\nand it's uh that's just difficult to\ndeal with because it's so final there's\nno there's no do-overs with that\ncan you help me understand where\nidentity comes into this so i'm i'm\nhearing that after she passed away you\nsaid something about\nyou know it's kind of related and and\nyou started uh\nthink about yourself differently\nyeah so\ni'm i'm very blessed at this point in my\nlife i have a relationship that is very\nstable um we just got engaged actually\nthis last weekend so congratulations\nthank you i mean she's just such a great\npartner to me and so she's been there to\nhelp me go through this and so\nif i was alone i think\ni may have fallen into old patterns of\ncoping\num\nwhich is to say like very destructive\npatterns\num\nso\nwhen i look at like what's happened\nmy\nfeelings of guilt around what happened\nwith my sister\nuh\nyou know absent my relationship i think\nthat could have been like a really dark\ntime for me\num\nwhere i can get to kind of like really\navoidant behavior or sometimes really\ndestructive destructive behavior\num\nand so i guess\ni guess maybe\nit makes more sense to focus on just\nlike\nin terms of our discussions how to get\nthrough the difficulties of this life\nwithout\nshutting down or\nfalling into destructive\npatterns of coping\nwell it sounds like you're doing pretty\ngood at that\ni'm doing okay i mean\nit's a struggle sometimes but i'm\nactually doing much better than i used\nto\nwhich is\nvery good good for you man\nthanks so i think if we want to talk\nabout avoidance you know what is it that\nyou\n[Music]\nwould be avoiding\nin what context so you kind of mentioned\nthat if it wasn't for this relationship\nyou're afraid you would have fallen into\navoidance behaviors\nright yeah and so they avoid its\nbehaviors but then there's also like\nwhat is it that you're avoiding so what\ndo you what what do you think you would\nhave tried to avoid\num i think i would have tried to avoid\nthe pain\njust the emotional pain\nand one hurts\nlike how does it affect my body like\nphysically or um\nyeah i mean what sure physically\nmentally\nif if i go through a really difficult or\nchallenging\nthing sometimes my anxiety can become so\noverwhelming that it's difficult to\nfunction uh it's difficult to work\nespecially in the kind of profession\nthat i do where it's like it's my job to\nbasically entertain people and\nuh that can be difficult when you are\nconstantly\nhurting\ndifficult sounds like the understatement\nof the year\nit's impossible yeah i've i've dipped\ni've dipped from content creation a\ncouple different times just totally\ndipped and disappeared for a little bit\nyeah um yeah\nso can you tell me like when you say\nokay let me let me try it a different\nway so you said that you were avoiding\npicking up the phone\ncan you help me understand\nwhat was hard about picking up the phone\num well\nshe had uh\nshe and some other people in my family\nwere um\nthey wanted to have hope that she could\nuh overcome the diagnosis\nand that she could be a part of that\nfive percent\nand i operate much more\ni don't know what the word i'm thinking\nof is\ni look at odds and i look at statistics\nand i and i take them at face value\nand so i began grieving basically\nright when the diagnosis was given i\nbegan\npreparing for\nthat eventual outcome\num\nbut i also was conscious of the i didn't\nwant to bring that around her i didn't\nwant her to\nexperience that any kind of pessimism or\nfatalism when it came to\naccepting the the outcome or the\nprobable outcome\nand\nso that just made it\ndifficult for me because i didn't know\nwhat i didn't know what to say a lot of\nthe time because i couldn't say anything\nto make her feel better and i couldn't\ntake away\nher pain\nshe had also just given birth to a\nlittle boy like she had wanted to be her\nmom her whole life\nand so she had just given birth and then\nit was only a couple months after the\nthe birth that she got the diagnosis\nand so the whole story is just um\nvery very very sad i mean her her little\nboy is is great and\nit's just he's such a blessing to be\naround\nso we're all very grateful that she she\ngave him us or she gave us him before\nshe left but um\nit was just so overwhelmingly sad to me\nthat i didn't want to make her sad\neither\nand so i would just think about her a\nlot instead of picking up the phone and\nshe was just constantly on my mind\nso i'm hearing that you know there's\nalmost uh\ni'm gonna use a loaded word here there's\nalmost like a propaganda going on right\nthere's a there's a sense of um\nyou know playing the music while the\ntitanic goes down\nwhere your sister and maybe the rest of\nyour family were like shooting for\noptimism\nyeah\nand and what i'm hearing was really hard\nfor you is that like you kind of saw the\nodds and you were like\nlike you couldn't be optimistic in this\ncircumstance\nbut i would but i didn't fault them for\nfor wanting that i understood why she\nwould want to hang on to that absolutely\nabsolutely so so i and i i kind of get\nyou like i i think i understand your\nstruggle because\nthere you are sort of facing the reality\nand there they are holding on to hope\nwhich like makes perfect sense right and\nwhen someone's got cancer like\nyou want people around you like giving\nyou hope you don't want people around\nyou\nyou know\nand so you were kind of what i'm almost\nhearing is that like you're almost\nprotecting her by not picking up the\nphone\ni don't know if i quite thought about it\nthat way at the time it felt when i look\nback on it it feels cowardly like it\nfeels like i should have just powered\nthrough and maybe even faked it\nyeah so that i can understand so like\nmaybe maybe what you should have done is\nfake it right that makes sense\num you know pick up the phone and be\nfalsely optimistic and like\nbe like a you know a cheerleader for her\num\nbut\nand i can see that for sure at the same\ntime i do wonder a little bit because\nwhat i'm sort of hearing is that\nshe couldn't kind of afford to have your\nmentality be a part of her sphere\num i think that would have been really\ndifficult for her\nif i you know if i would have brought\nthat energy into into her life yeah so i\ni'm i am kind of hearing and i'm curious\nwhat do you what do you think about that\nbecause that that does seem quite quite\nyou know\nbrotherly to me to sort of recognize\nthat you're in a dark place and and\nyou're seeing these like negative odds\nand like you don't want to expose your\nsister to that because\nyou know\nheaven knows she's got enough to deal\nwith\nyeah\nthat's an actor accurate\ncharacterization i think yeah yeah and\nwhat do you what do you think about it\nwhen i sort of say it like that\ni still beat myself up i mean the louder\nvoice is saying just you should have\njust faked it you should have just\npicked up the call and faked infected\nand\nyeah\num i think that makes a lot of sense\nwhat else is that voice saying\num i just miss her\ni told myself i wasn't gonna cry by the\nway\nokay we\nare\ncrying um yeah a little bit\ni just miss her a lot\ni miss her a lot\nthat doesn't sound to me like the same\nvoice that is calling you a coward\nwell there's a lot of voices fighting up\nthere sometimes yep\nso i i mean do you think the one that\nso here's what i'm envisioning there's a\nthere's a toxic voice in there right\nwe're gonna call it toxic but there's\nmaybe there's a part of you that tells\nyou i'm not really toxic i'm just real\ni'm the reality of it\nyeah and and it's kind of saying you\nknow like you should have manned up you\nshould have like you know put on a\nbright face you should have been\noptimistic\nif that voice is really really\ndevastating it may even say maybe if you\nhad done that things would have been\ndifferent today does it ever say those\nkinds of things\nno\nokay i'm happy to hear that\nyeah um\nand so you feel\nhe's mentioned cowardly and i think\nthat's a good word because it implies\nlike an identity\nright like sadness is not an identity\ncowardly is an identity you see that\nyeah\nand so what do you what do you kind of\ni'm going to ask a question i asked\nbefore but just modify it a little bit\nwhat kind of person doesn't put on a\nbrave face for their sister dying of\ncancer\nsomeone who's selfish\num\nsomebody who\ncan't put the needs of somebody else uh\nahead of their own\nand a time that calls for it the most\num\ni think selfish selfishness is more\na more accurate description of\nthat toxic voice\nuh than\ncowardly i think\nalthough i think maybe they can be a\nlittle intertwined\nyeah\num uh yeah i can sort of see that\ni can see how those two are intertwined\nin the sense that\nyou know you weren't able to\nput her first right and the reason you\nweren't able to put her first is because\nyou couldn't tolerate\nbeing falsely optimistic\nyeah i mean also just just generally on\ntop of the fact that it was difficult it\nwas just a difficult difficult situation\nit was a difficult thing to process\nyou know\nto go from having your sister who wanted\nto be a mom her whole life having a kid\nfor the first time and she you know\nshe was a great mom and she would have\nbeen a\nincredible mom\ni think\nthat was like her calling i think she\nshe wanted kids since she was a kid\num and we used to kind of tease her for\nthat\nlike a playful teasing but um\nso to to have this blessing of a child\nand then\none one or two months later get this\nhorrible diagnosis that was uh\npretty incredibly powerful 180.\num time just kind of stopped i think\nwhen i when i got that when i got the\ncall from my mom to let me know that she\nhad the diagnosis\ni felt like everything just kind of\nslowed down and got quiet\ni\nfelt like i was entering this new\npart of my life\ncan you tell me about that part of your\nlife\nwhat were you entering into\num\ni was entering a world without her\nuh for the first time in my life and um\nthat bothers me\noh boy that sounds like a shitty world\ni don't even never even met the woman\nand i\ni mean i didn't make a promise not to\ncry so i get to cry you can cry if you\nwant to\ni'm gonna grab it i have one\nuh she was a wonderful sister so i mean\nit was it was a devastating loss\nyeah that much is clear\nyeah on on both accounts\ncan i ask you something hutch did you\nyeah i mean so it sounds like you wanted\nto talk to her more\num\nbut it sounds like you talked to her\nsome like while she was lucid\na little bit yeah\nwent up there and\nyeah\nwell we went up there a couple uh i went\nup there with us me a couple i mean um\nesme is my fiance so she came up with me\none time when we did uh we did like a\nthe most kobut friendly\nvisit that we could do it was all\noutside and\nuh you know we didn't we stayed at a\nhotel and you know we didn't we didn't\ndo hugs um\nwhich is also like really difficult yeah\ni was gonna say that sounds hard to go\nthrough an experience like that and not\nhave the the freedom to hug\nhug her put her on your arm like\neverything in me wanted to just comfort\nher in that way so that i mean\nkobe really made the whole situation\nlike a lot worse um\nso i did i did spend some time with her\nuh and i did call her\na few times and i texted her\num and then of course i was there for\nat the end but\nshe wasn't super lucid by the end a\nlittle bit and then the last couple days\nnot at all\ndid you ever share with her your\nkind of negativity\nno\nno she\nshe i never told her that i felt\ni never told her that i thought she was\ngonna probably gonna die no\ndo you think she picked up on it anyway\ni don't think so\ni i hope not i don't i don't think so\nthough\nbut it it's a\nyou start to think about your own death\ntoo\num\nthe finality of death is\nterrifying to me now in a way that it\nyou know i was always kind of afraid of\ndeath but i think i'm even more afraid\nof death now\nand i don't have the benefit of uh\nreligious faith to\nhelp me\ncope with that fear\num\ncan you help me understand what what\nmakes you afraid of death\ni just i think we live in a on a very\nbeautiful planet at a really\ncrucially important and interesting time\nin terms of like the\npath of human development and um\ni feel very blessed in the life that i\nhave i feel very blessed to be born when\ni was\non this planet to be able to witness\neverything i mean it can be a [ __ ] show\nout there a lot of the times but\nand especially here in these states oh\nboy but um\nit's still a beautiful world that we\nlive in and the the idea that you know\nwhen i die\nyou know\nyou know probably never going to see it\nagain if if reincarnation is real i'd\nprobably end up on another planet as an\namiibo or something uh\nso that that thought is very sad to me\nto to not be able to\nsee how the rest of the story plays out\nand to\nspend time with the people that i care\nabout here and\nit's just horrifying it's a horrifying\nthought\nso\ni'm tempted\nto teach\nokay um\ni i don't know if it's appropriate or\nnot but\nso especially i think because you it's\nclear to me you've done a lot of work\num you have a therapist\nso\nyou know\ni just want to share some thoughts if\nthat's okay i mean i can ask you more\nquestions if you like but i'm really i'd\nlike to share some thoughts and really\nsee what you kind of think about them\ni'd be happy to listen for a while\num\nyeah maybe give you a bit of a break\nso\nman where do i can i have a second to\nkind of\nyeah of course\ni think the challenge here is i don't i\ndon't know\nhow much of what i'm going to say is\ngoing to make sense but\ni don't know we'll try to figure out so\nlet's just talk\nso you had a sense\nof who you were growing up and i i think\nthat what i'm sort of hearing is that\nwho you are has not really been set set\nin stone and is fluctuated and maybe\nactually it was kind of always down\nthere\nbut depending on how turbulent the\nsurface of the water is you weren't able\nto really connect with who you were\nand that you've\ndone i think that's a really good way of\nputting it yeah\nand over time you know as you've gotten\nknocked about by the waves you've sort\nof figured out the hard way\nwho you are\nyou know it was either get swept away or\nfind that anchor you know that that core\nof who you are\nand that you've done a lot of positive\ngrowth in that direction\nyeah i think that i had to think about\nthat but yeah i think that's that's\nsomewhat accurate yeah\nso i think when your sister gets\ndiagnosed with cancer you know it throws\nit throws your world into confusion\nright like so the world like operated\nbased on certain principles like i'm\nhere like my my sister\nis meant to be a mother her entire\nthat's what she's put on this earth to\ndo\nand now she's got a kid and and this is\nlike you know we're figuring things out\num you know i'm dating someone things\nare kind of going well like this is the\nway that life is supposed to be like had\nsome bumpy patches a lot to be grateful\nfor you know some struggles but like\nthings are sort of sorting themselves\nout\nand you were feeling good about yourself\nyeah i was on a hot streak yeah a good\npoint in my life\nand then you know that the diagnosis\nhits\nand then you know tragedy hits with it\num\nyou found yourself not being able to\ndelude yourself\ninto thinking she would make it\nuh you started judging yourself for\nnot being able to lie\nto someone that you cared about\num i know that's not the way that you\nthink about it i saw the way that you\nlooked there for a second but let's be\non and this is where the teaching kind\nof comes in\nwhat we're talking about is lying\nwe don't really think about it that way\nand this is sort of where the teaching\nkind of comes in is\num\nyou know i've worked with a lot of\npeople who have cancer and a lot of\npeople are you know\nterminally ill with cancer because i'm a\npsychiatrist and\ni trained at a general hospital which\nmeans a lot of my work is not with\npsychiatric patients it's actually\nyou know there was something like 23\nbeds out of 960 that are for psychiatric\npatients\nand the other\n940 so some odd beds are for people who\nare hospitalized for medical conditions\nthe cancer award was quite big\nso a lot of the work that i did was on\nthe cancer awards\nand\nyou know i\ni don't know if this is going to make\nyou feel better or worse because i can\nsee your mind interpreting it kind of\nboth ways\nbut i think one of the most terrifying\nthings for a cancer patient\nis\neveryone around them is being hopeful\nand they [ __ ] know the odds\nright they're the patient a doctor is\ngonna explain to them\nbut since everyone around them is being\nhopeful\nthey can't show the abject terror that\nthey feel inside\nbecause no one is there who like\nlike you know she can't\nbreak down and cry in front of her mom\nor her kid or you know the dad or you\nknow like she can't afford to do that\nbecause\nwe're all like in this play right like\nwe're like acting it out and we're gonna\nhope because everyone tells people with\ncancer like you gotta hope\nright we place like a moral judgment on\nthe right way to behave when faced with\na terminal illness\nand so\nyou know my experience with with those\npeople is that the best thing that i\ncould offer them was not hope\nbut a place where\nthey didn't have to be hopeless alone\nbecause like hopelessness is one thing\nand i think it's something you\nunderstand because it sounds like\nyou kind of did this\nbeing hopeless is one thing being\nhopeless alone is entirely something\nelse\nyeah\nand there's a part of me and i don't\nwant you to beat yourself up for this\nbut you know there's a part of me that\nwants to say that\nyou know\ni don't know i'm just gonna say it\nbecause i it's i think it's authentic\nthat like what you had to offer your\nsister wasn't\na mistake\nthat like the way that you felt about\nher like if everyone else is pretending\nthat the five percent is gonna roll like\nyou don't think\nthat she is\nunbeli unbelievably terrified that the\ndice are not going to go her way\nno she told me she told me as much\nyeah oh so i'm really happy to hear that\nbecause i i wonder you know why she told\nyou\ni asked her if she was afraid\nand she told me that she told me the\ntruth\nso so oh thank god because here i was i\nwas afraid because i think that's the\nright move honestly and i was afraid\nthat i was gonna replace one kind of\nguilt with another but now i actually\nfeel really good\nbecause i think that's the kind of\nquestion that people who are offering\nsomeone false hope or not\nthey can't ask\nyou get that\nlike we can't ask her if she's afraid\nbut if there's if there's one thing that\nreassures me that you are a good brother\nto her it's actually asking that\nquestion\nbecause she gets to share that right\nbecause like when you ask her that\nquestion like those thoughts are there\nman she's living with them day in and\nday out just like you lived with a day\nin a day out\nright she's thinking about what's gonna\nhappen to her son like she's thinking\nabout all that [ __ ]\nand she's\nkeeping it inside\nand there you are terrified right so you\nask like you're not like hey i'm afraid\nthat everything's gonna go to [ __ ]\nand you're gonna die like you're not\ndumping it on her\nwhat you're really doing now\nmy water works really going\num just because i'm thinking about it\nbut like i think that\nthat's the most important question that\nyou could have asked her it's the most\nimportant thing you could have said\nand what did she say when you asked her\ni think i'll keep that between her and\nme sure\nbut she was\nshe was afraid\nyeah\ni think the important thing\nfair enough i'm glad you drew that\nboundary by the way um\nbut i cannot in the purpose of teaching\nhutch i can tell you as is someone who\nprofessionally works with terminally ill\npeople\nthat question is the most therapeutic\nand supportive question you can ask\nwhen someone is facing death pretending\nit's not coming\nhelps\ni mean don't get me wrong\nbut it's like insufficient man\nhaving her brother understand and be\nwilling to listen\nright like\nbecause it sounds like she answered your\nquestion and like you listen we don't\nhave to go into it but i'm hearing that\nyou know you gave her a door to walk\nthrough and she needed to walk through\nit\nwell i told her i was scared too and i\nand i don't remember if the conversation\nwent too much further after that other\nand and i feel like\nthere's a part of me that that wishes i\nwould have\nsaid more than that um but i asked her\nshe was afraid she said yes i said i am\ntoo and um\nit felt like a moment of honesty and but\nbut i didn't want\ni i i could tell she was really\nstruggling with that with that fear and\num\nespecially with her her mom instincts uh\nshe want she wanted to be there for for\nher boy um\nand\ni put myself in her shoes and just\nimagine how devastating that must have\nbeen\ni think maybe i'm angry that there was\njust nothing\ni could say to make her feel better\num\nand i wish that there was\nsomething i it just\ni think it's a natural instinct to to go\nback and scrutinize like the way that\nyou behaved and like look for ways you\ncould have done it better or whatever\ni think that's a very human thing to do\num\nbut it\nit's difficult to grapple with sometimes\nwhen i when i think about that question\nlike what could i have said or what\ncould i have done differently\nand um\nyeah it's been it's been very\nchallenging\nso hutch i don't know if you're gonna be\nable to hear or receive this\num\nbut\nand i i never met your sister i'm not\nomniscient\ni've spent\nthe better part of 16 years of my life\ntrying to figure out how to help other\nhuman beings\nand i think i've figured some of it out\nand every instinct of everything that\ni've learned\nleads me to conclude that what you said\nin that moment\nhelped immensely\nnow i'm not saying you couldn't have\nsaid more\nbut i think there's also something that\nwe i think this is a mistake on\nour part we sometimes believe as a\nsociety that saying more is worth more\nyeah\none moment of honesty\nin\none moment of because like i don't\nespecially between like brothers and\nsisters like you don't need to say a\nwhole lot\nright\nyeah\nlike i remember when i got engaged\num you know my dad\nwas like i'm not sure she's the one for\nyou\nbut if you really like if this is the\none that you want i'm behind you and\nthat was it it was like one sentence\nit's all i needed to hear\nthere wasn't a long discussion about\nwhether she was the one or wasn't the\none or whatever like\nit was just like one sentence\nbut\nit means\nit was enough\nand that would that actually meant\nsomething to you that was that was a you\nyou you took that as a\na kind gesture\nyeah so i can give you more examples\nif you want\nyeah so the day i got so i i struggled\nto get into medical school for three\nyears i i really didn't much like\nyourself i kind of didn't do great in\ncollege except i wasn't even dean's list\nthe first semester it was\nf straight out of the gate\nand so for years you know i started\nmedical school at the age of 27 or 28\nand so there was a gap there between\nlike undergrad for like five years\nwhere you know i wasn't really\naccomplishing much and my dad was always\nlike pretty supportive you know he\ndidn't seem like disappointed in me or\nanything like that but\num and i was terrified right because\nlike he's not gonna say hey you're\n[ __ ] for life like he never said that\num but i was like i'm [ __ ] for life\nit's like 25 years old no job no money\nno you know i'm not going anywhere who\nand so the day i got into medical school\num\nyou know i still remember now i'm gonna\nget emotional because he passed away uh\nsoon after i got into medical school but\nyou know he told me that like now that\nyou've gotten and he was crying and he\nsaid nothing is gonna hold you back\nand that's all he said he was like now\nthat you've gotten your break like\nnothing is gonna hold you back\nand it was like\nit was honesty and like i realized in\nthat moment that he was like terrified\njust like i was\nyou know and that like i mean\nhe never showed it to me\nuntil that moment because he you know\neverything was going to be fine then\npresumably and he was right\nyou know i don't think i've been held\nback by much and and\nbut\nyou know a few words are like they can\nbe transformative\nmy my mom she went when she called me to\nlet me know that um\nit was time to come up there and\nher time was limited\none of the reasons why she wanted me to\ncome up there was you know if there's\nanything that you want to say to her in\nperson then then this would be the time\nto do it\nand i really really struggled with\nfiguring out what i wanted to say\nbecause i could say something that was\nfive pages long\nuh with all the memories that we have\nand and all the different myriad ways\nthat she positively impacted my life\nbut i couldn't organize my thoughts all\nthat much beyond just\num thinking about how much\ngratitude i had that she was my big\nsister\nand i ended up just that was all i\nthat was the thing that i said to her i\njust asked her you know do you know how\nmuch i love being your little brother\nshe kind of jokingly said well now i do\nlike even towards even towards the end\nshe was trying to like make us laugh a\nlittle bit and um\nbut i think\nmaybe that was enough like maybe that\nwas enough of of like\ntelling her what i wanted what i wanted\nto you know say\num\nand maybe it wasn't but\nbut yeah\nthere's no manual for this there's no\nyou know there's no there's there's no\nbook to tell you what to do in these\nsituations and\nyou just\ndo your best\nuh\nyou just show up and do your best and\nthat's what i tried to do um\ni'd like to be able to look back on that\non that on that time that with\nsome degree of acceptance and i think\nthat's what i'm struggling with is sure\naccepting that it happened the way that\nit did\nwhat would have been enough hutch\nwhat does enough look like\ni genuinely have\nno concept of i have no idea\nyou know why\nbecause it's not a real thing\nso now we get to the weird part okay\nenough is an abstraction of the mind\nokay let\ni may have to explain myself here\nso you have an id\nso we have an identity\nright like we have this like\nidentity that kind of\nsets standards for ourselves\nbut like\nthere is no such thing as enough\nthere's only what is\nlike the only thing that exists is what\nyou said what does it mean if there's\nenough how do we measure that right like\nlet's be really precise here because i\nthink that idea of enough\nis born out of your guilt\nthe two are intrinsically tied\nand you want to hold on to your guilt\nlike your guilt is like sure there's a\npart of you that wants to let it go but\nthere's something about\nnot being enough for her which got\nit's hard to describe but like you know\ni think the reason that\nyou know guilt doesn't hold on to us\nlike we hold on to it\nwhat possible reason would i have to\nwant to hold on to guilt like what\npsychological need would that be\nfulfilling because of your sense of\nidentity right so if we look at why do\npeople hold on to negative ideas\nit's because of who they believe they\nare\nso what does that say about my sense of\nidentity then\ni'd say that there's an echo left over\nfrom your hard times which as you\nmentioned has resurfaced\nbecause i think that you what like what\nwould enough been for like it's\nridiculous\nyou want to do enough for your sister\nthat doesn't doing enough for your\nsister doesn't\ndoing enough for your sister starts the\nmoment she dies\nthat's not the end of doing enough for\nyour sister she's got a kid you have a\nnephew\nshe's not going to be able to take care\nof him you want to do enough do enough\nwhy that\nit starts now buddy\nforget it like i mean not don't forget\nabout her that sounds mean but like\nseriously like\nyou're you're like you're thinking about\nthe wrong thing\nlike this is just starting\nand the more that you get caught up in\nlike doing enough i mean i think you did\nenough i mean she was it sounds like you\nguys had a close relationship sounds\nlike she felt loved\nyou know\nshe was joking at the end but don't\nconfuse\nhumor\nfor the real feelings underneath\nand that's just all be like i mean what\ncould you like it's the pandemic you\nshowed up when you could you said what\nyou were capable of\ncould you have said more yes but this is\nalso where you have to like meet\nyourself where you're at\nright you can't expect yourself in the\nthird grade and know what you know now\nabout your identity\nall that exists were you enough back\nthen in the third grade\ni think it's like you said i just was\nwhat i was\nexactly and so when did that change\nwere you\nenough in the fourth grade sure\nenough in the fifth grade sure and\nsomewhere along the way something\nhappens and you start becoming not\nenough\nit's idiocy\nit's ahamkada it's ego\ngo ahead you wanna say something\num that's that's\nuh uh that feeling of not being enough\nthat's all i remember i i don't have a\ntime in my life where i felt like i was\nenough so\nyeah\nso\nthis is where the teaching comes in so\nthis is where the feeling has existed\nit's just looking for a particular way\nto like thing to latch onto does that\nmake sense\nyeah\nand boy is losing your sister a really\neasy thing for it to latch on to\nbeing enough has nothing to do with her\nit has everything to do with you\nand if you tell me that you've had the\nfeeling of not being enough forever well\nyeah\nright that should give you evidence that\nyou didn't do anything wrong by your\nsister\nit's just there's something about your\nidentity it's something that you carry\nwith you\nthat makes you feel like you're you're\nnot enough and if you pay attention and\nyou go back and we ask you lots of\ndifferent stories about your upbringing\nwe can come up with a time in fourth\ngrade when you didn't feel like you were\nenough and then your jokes weren't funny\nenough and then you became a content\ncreator and you made good content and\nthe next week you made content that\ndidn't have as many views and then you\nweren't goody enough\nand then you start dating this girl and\nyou were racked with insecurity because\nyou don't know if you were enough\nand then over time you grew that you'd\nrealize that was bs and then you asked\nher to marry you and now you're gonna\nget married\nwe can see the enoughness the lack of oh\ni'm not enough i'm not enough\nbut in any of those individual\nsituations were you ever not enough for\nyour fiance no bro you've been you\nyou've been great do you need to grow\nsure are you gonna continue to grow\nabsolutely\nyou'd have to ask her\nyou ask her for me see what she says\ni think i know the answer yeah i think i\ndo too\nand so\nnot being enough is part of your it's\npart of what you carry\nand it's just really really hard because\nit's like really easy\nfor that insecurity to latch on to i\ndidn't say enough for my\nmy sister\nit was like what the [ __ ] does enough\neven me like what are you gonna\nlike\nlike what could you possibly say\nthat will\njust think about the tragedy of her\nbeing a newborn you know having a\nnewborn son and then dying of cancer\nlike what are you gonna say like how\nyou're not gonna make a dent in that\nyou can only say what you can say\nright and i think you actually did jen\nyou honestly like my professional\nopinion is that like you offered her\nsomething really really important\nwhich is\nsomeone to be afraid with which when the\nend is coming\nlike\npeople don't want to put on a brave face\nit's false it's a lie\nso i think that authenticity and if we\nthink about even like what i do on\nstream and stuff like we don't pull\npunches like am i making you feel bad\nbecause we're both crying\nlike does it hurt to have this\nconversation of course i never met the\ngirl i feel devastated\nright i have my own grief\ndoes it mean it's bad that we should\nretreat away from this\ndoes it mean that it's bad that we\nshould retreat away from the feeling of\ngrief you mean\nall of it all the negativity\nyou know my point is that like\nbeing someone that you can say like are\nyou afraid and she says yes and then you\nsaying i am too like that's huge bro\nlike objectively\nyou can go ask a hundred grief\ncounselors what they think about the\nvalue of that but like generally\nspeaking when we get trained to you know\ndeal with people in grief like we get\ntrained not to tell them hey\neverything's gonna be okay what they\nactually train us to do is like help\nthem be with them in the negativity\nso i'm pretty sure yeah\nit seems very counterintuitive because\nyou your instinct is to protect them\nfrom that feeling yes protect him from\nthat feeling of uh\nsadness and fear but you're not going to\nprotect him from [ __ ] dude your your\nsister knows\nyou can't\nyou know and that's why like for example\nwhen i work with people who are suicidal\ni will say very counterintuitive things\nso when someone's suicidal and i say\ncheer up you have so much left to live\nfor\nhow do you think that makes a suicidal\nperson feel\ni'd probably roll my eyes at you if you\nsaid that to me if i was in a suicidal\nplace exactly\nisolated\nalone\nmakes the suicidality worse\ninstead saying hey help me understand\nwhy life isn't worth living wow that\nsounds awful it sounds like you don't\nhave a lot left to live for\nright you don't want to leave them alone\nand then once you're with them once\nthey're not alone then you can start\nmoving forward\nright then i can say hey i understand\nwhy you feel that way\ni'm having trouble being hopeless when i\nlisten to you\neverything you're saying is correct\nbut i still have hope in spite of that\nwhat do you think about that\nso authenticity and honesty is like\nthe basis of human emotional support\nyeah\nso\ni i mean i i know i kind of bounced\naround but i i think kind of going back\nthis idea if you felt\nif you felt like you've never been\nenough like that's what you need to work\non but that doesn't have to do with her\nright and i met what i say earlier in\nterms of like if she passed away like\nenough doesn't start with her end with\nher death that starts with her death\nso how do you even begin to\nstart challenging a voice that's as loud\nand ingrained\nas the one that i'm describing that says\nthat i'm\nnot enough i can't think of that is the\nloudest voice in my i'm a content\ncreator we're all\ninsecure [ __ ] lunatics we're all\nmesses uh\nself-esteem comes from like metrics and\nstuff like that it's just so\nyeah\nit's a beautiful question and your\nanswer is right there\nyou don't challenge it\nyou accept it\nso there's a part of you\nthat feels like you're not enough and\nhow do you treat that part of you\nuh like it's an authority\nokay\nso\nnot the answer i was looking\nit's not a belief it's like a it's a\nconviction it's not i wonder if i'm not\nenough it's\nso i may have to change my answer\num\nbut i'm going to share what i wanted to\nshare with you anyway so\nthe thing is you're trying to get rid of\nit\nright\nit would make my life a lot easier i\nthink\nso i think that's why it's not going\naway\nso when there's a part of ourselves\nso i would say that how do you start\nchallenging something like that you if\nyou want to get rid of it the way that\nyou\ndo that\nis not by challenging it by actually\naccepting it\nso\nthere's a big difference between arguing\nwith yourself when you say i am not\nenough and arguing with yourself and\nsaying no i am enough and then you guys\nfight in your mind\nno peace will come from that i'm sure\nyou've tried it a thousand times\nno peace comes from fighting against\nyourself a house divided itself against\nitself cannot stand\nyou can't think your way out of that\nkind of thing you can't\nso what you can do is say i'm not enough\nand that's okay\nand then you just live your life and put\none foot in front of the other\nsort of\nit's harder than i'm making it sound\nwhich i'm hearing the skepticism in your\nvoice\nno that wasn't skepticism actually\ni i understand that to a certain degree\nso so it's it's to understand that that\nfeeling of not being enough was not\nsomething that\nis random\nyou were taught that\nright how does a child you think about\nyour nephew does your nephew think he's\nenough\noh yeah he fights he plays with blocks\nhe's having a great time yeah\nand so like if you think about it how\ndoes a child like that start to believe\nthat they're not enough because someone\nteaches it to\nthem they learn it\nso what you need to understand is that\nsomewhere within you like there's\nsomething that you learned\nright because it's such a strong belief\nlike it's not\nyou know i i don't know that there's\nlike a not enough circuit in your brain\ni mean there sort of is but it's neither\nhere nor there\nbut i think that what it comes down to\nis somewhere along the way like you felt\nlike you were not enough and now what\nhappens is there's a part of you that's\ntelling you you're not enough and what\nare you doing you're pushing it away\nright\nyou're telling it you're not good enough\nyou need to stop telling me that i'm not\ngood enough you see that it's like\ncyclic\ni know it's kind of getting abstract but\nyou were so there's a part of you that's\ntelling you\nthat is not being accepting towards\nyourself that's telling you to do better\nand what are you telling your mind you\nneed to do better you need to start\ntelling me i'm enough [ __ ] you do better\ntoxic part of my mind get the hell out\nof here\ni i typically don't have that kind of a\nself-dialogue though it's it's uh it's\nmore of a\nyeah i'm not enough okay and then i just\neither make a joke of it or cope in some\nother way yeah so i don't i'm\nusing a little bit of hyperbole with my\ndialogue i don't think you respond to it\nthat way but i do think that that's a\nshade of not acceptance so i think\nyou've learned how to cope with it\nthat's what i'm really hearing is you've\nheard you've learned healthy coping\nmechanisms in response to that voice but\nyou haven't figured out how to uproot\nthe voice\nwell if i do what would that make me\nthough because like one of the reasons i\nyou know i can be kind of funny like\ni just you know some people are a lot\nmore funny than me but i can be kind of\na funny guy\nand that is one of the ways that i dealt\nwith\nfeelings of\ninadequacy it was just turning\neverything into a joke\num\nso if i were to uproot that\npart of me that tells me that i'm not\nenough i have concerns about\nmy long-term financial well-being what\nif i'm no longer funny like what if i'm\nno longer interesting or entertaining\nand now we understand why it stays\nbecause you're afraid of what would\nhappen to you if it goes\nso do you want to change that part of\nyourself\nyeah there we go\nright\nso this is the really confusing thing\nwhen i you asked me earlier why would\nsomeone want to hold on to their guilt\nwhy the [ __ ] would someone want to hold\non to the toxic voice in their head\nthat's telling them that they're not\nenough now\nyou have the answer\nso understand that everything in your\nmind so like this is kind of cool like\nif you don't believe in any religions or\nspirituality or stuff like that let's\nassume biology for a second or maybe you\ndo i don't know\ni'm\ni'm i\ni\nthink that there is\nsomething much much bigger than me and i\nchoose not to try to define it so i'm\nopen to i'm not i don't get offended by\nother people's religious beliefs yeah\nright i was just anyway that was an\ninteresting aside we can talk about that\nin a second but let's let's talk about\nso your mind like you have neurons right\nand neurons like have like action\npotentials and they fire and they calm\ndown and they depolarize and they move\nsodium and potassium like there's like\nscience and biology and chemistry and\nbiochemistry in physics that governs\neverything in your brain\nand your brain has evolved\nthis is kind of weird just think about\nthis for a second your brain has evolved\nwith the ability to be anxious with the\nability to be afraid with the ability to\nfeel guilty\nwhy the hell does do our brains\nhave the capability like why aren't we\njust happy all the time we could have\nevolved that way\nwhy does your brain torture you like\nthis is a system that was designed to\nproduce this right\nand so what people don't understand is\nthat all emotions\nhave evolutionary benefit all emotions\nhave value all emotions have function if\nthey didn't have function it wouldn't\nhave evolved\nyeah okay you know\nso it's kind of interesting because\neven this idea of not being enough what\ni'm hearing is that it propels you you\nuse it\nand so what would happen if it went away\nyou're afraid that you wouldn't be funny\nanymore that's what i'm hearing\nnot just that though i'm afraid of a\ncascading series of just\nmental collapse just not just like how i\nam in my job but like what kind of a\nboyfriend would i be what kind of a\nfriend would i be what kind of a general\nperson would i be and that's question\nthat question mark is what scares me the\nthe unknown of\nletting that go i don't think it's an\nunknown bro\nyou remember what it was like before you\nlearned how to crack a joke in the\nsecond grade\nuh yeah\nthat's what you'd go back to\nbecause how did you get\nwell i'm not trying to regress into like\na\nseven year old\nexactly which is why you're not gonna\nlet go of your your fuel for jokes\nyou see that\nbecause you learned how to be funny and\nyou learn how to get people to like you\nand where does the fuel from your jokes\ncome from the sense of inadequacy\npain\npain you're damn right traumatic pain\nyes yeah and so who would you be without\nyour pain\nso now we come back to identity you'd be\nwho you are\ni'm just afraid that i wouldn't be\ninteresting at that point\nyep\nbut you will be don't worry about that\ni mean you are worried about that which\nis okay so we have to meet you where\nyou're at and let yourself be afraid\nso i know it's kind of weird but like\nyou're afraid that people won't like you\nif you get better\nright that you won't be funny\nthat there will be a collapse\nyou know there's there's i'm of two\nminds on that because i have\nyou should have seen me\nlike 12 years ago doc because i was\ni was a [ __ ] mess like and and you\ncould see it i wore it on my face like\nif you tuned into my videos\nlike people used to leave comments like\nare you okay\nlike how i looked physically because i\nwasn't taking care of myself and um\nand and since that point i have gotten\nbetter i've gotten healthier i've i've\nprogressed and i have my own like little\ncommunity on on twitch here and\nthey see that and they comment about\nthat and they give me you know praise\nfor that and it and it feels good to\nto know that\ni mean i already know that i i've gotten\nbetter but to to to have other people\nsee that happening is is validating to\nme\num and so it matters on that level\nsure so i do i do i do recognize that\nlike that\nit's it's sort of a\nit's sort of a\nfalse expectation that people would no\nlonger be interested in in who i am or\nmy content or whatever if i were to get\nbetter there's a problem that recognizes\nthat that that's that's false how\ninteresting\nright but i said well i still grapple\nwith it it's like i'm with you so\nmost of what keeps us stuck so this is\nanother common misconception when we get\nstuck we think that we don't know what\nto do or that we lack motivation\nbut most of the time what keeps us stuck\nis conflict\nbecause there's the doubt\nright there's like and it's it's been\nfascinating to talk to you bro because\nit's clear to me that you've done an\nimmense amount of work\nso what i see is someone who's like\nhalfway there or even well past halfway\nit's like 75 80 percent\nand yeah i know it's it's shocking\nshocking\nbut i i think that's really the issue\nright is is like so and what's happening\nis\nwhat these people are teaching you and i\nknow it's kind of weird but i think\ntwitch is doing a lot of good in the\nworld but what they're teaching you is\nthat oh you're not like a screwed up\ndegenerate that used to be kind of funny\nand we accept you anyway\nright we can be proud of how far you've\ncome\nwell chat roasts me harder than anybody\nelse on the internet but\nthey do it\nout of kindness i think exactly so\nthat's also where like they say they\nroast you right but they also like\nthey do it\nit's kind of like i i run a group for\nesports professionals and one of them\ngot a girlfriend\nand the funniest thing was\nman they would not leave him alone\nthey were like\nhis teammates were roasting him for it\nuh not just his teammates it's like kind\nof a more open group for esports\neveryone was roasting him they just\ncould not stop giving him [ __ ]\nand so i was like what are and if you\nlook at everyone's smiling right\nokay and i was like asking people i was\nlike why you know what are we doing here\nlike i asked the person like how do you\nfeel everyone's giving you [ __ ]\nand he's like i kind of feel like\nembarrassed but i sort of feel good and\nwe ask everyone else like how do y'all\nfeel and we're like we all feel good\nwe're also smiling right and it's like\nwhat we're actually doing this is the\nway that men communicate their approval\nyeah\nright yeah\nit's the negative expression of a\npositive affection\nyeah that pisses me off sometimes i like\nlike i buy into that [ __ ] a lot good\nbecause i just i'm programmed to do that\nbut sometimes i really get bothered by\nthe fact that\nguys it's hard for it's hard for a lot\nof men\nand i think that's getting better which\nis it gives me a sign it's a sign of um\nit's a sign that you should be\noptimistic about where things are headed\neverybody talks about how everybody's\nbecoming such sensitive babies these\ndays it's all [ __ ] because i think\nit's a good thing that that men are\nstarting to feel more\nsafe to express those emotions but yeah\nit does bother me sometimes i wish\npeople i wish\nfriends could just simply just say like\ni'm [ __ ] proud of you you did a good\nthing that's so great without having to\nwrap it into some sarcastic\nyeah you know [ __ ] whatever i mean\n20 years ago if we were crying the way\nthat we were 20 you know maybe half an\nhour ago we'd have to toss out no homos\nright yeah people yeah people would be\nlike you know people can see you right\nlike this is live and they can actually\nsee you crying yeah\nand we were crying and what are we doing\nnow hutch\nwe're smiling yeah\nyeah right so i if that bothers you i\nwant to actually commend you\nbecause you coming on here and\nexpressing your emotions\nis going to be rewiring the neurons of\nevery person who's watching they're\ngoing to be learning\nright that it's actually okay to express\nmyself\nthat i don't have to rap\ni sure hope so yeah and i think that's\nwhat you're doing with your podcast too\ni think you're showing people that it's\nokay to struggle\nyeah that's the goal yeah\nkind of\ndid you um i wanted to kind of go back\nto this conflict for a second\nwhich conflict so just the not enough\nbusiness\num yeah\ni just want to kind of tie that up if\nyou have other questions um that's fine\nbut\nuh you know so here's what i sort of\nunderstand there's a part of you that's\nfelt like for a long time\nyou haven't felt like you\nit's enough did you kind of get what i\nwas saying that\nthat\nhow can i say this so sometimes we have\nthese things in our minds that are\nlooking for excuses\nso the best example i can come up with\nis i i had a i'd have a patient who had\nbeen\ncheated on\nby someone they cared about a lot\num they found out like just before they\ngot married and so they called the\nwedding off quite traumatized for it and\nthen their\nafterward their mind would like look for\nreasons\nwhy their future partners would be\ncheating on them they were like paranoid\nfor it does that make sense yeah and and\nso what happens is in our mind once we\nhave a belief about ourselves like i'm\nnot worthy enough like i'm like she\nstarted to think really negatively about\nherself right because when you get\ncheated on you feel like you did\nsomething wrong you could blame the\nother person\nbut you also feel like there's something\nfundamentally wrong with you and so any\nsign in the external world for her\ninternal psychological complex she'd\nlike latch on to\nokay yeah i see right and so that's just\nhow the mind works like once i have a\nbelief about something you can see this\nin politics because you know i know you\ndo some political content now like\npeople who have a political belief will\nsift information to reinforce whatever\nthey believe\nso it's just a function of the brain\nit's a function of our psychology and if\nyou have this thing in in you this\nauthoritative voice that tells you i'm\nnot enough\nit's gonna find whatever it needs to\nfrom time to time depending on your\nemotional state like if you're feeling\ngood about yourself the voice will be\nquiet but if you ever start getting into\na dark place it'll reactivate and it'll\nfind reasons\nand boy the death of your sister is just\na juice like how on earth are you gonna\nfight against its authority there it's\nnot even a contest\nand no wonder you say yes sir when it\nsays something to you now because it's\nplaying the trump card you didn't call\nher enough\nyou know\nyeah\nit\nand\nas that part of you so how do you deal\nwith that one is i'm seeing that you're\nstarting to deal with it already because\nyou're starting to recognize oh like i\nused to be this degenerate on on youtube\nand now i've like cleaned myself up and\npeople are like\nthey're like\ngood job\nright\nand so you can and but there's there's\nstill that conflict and then there's\nalso these other confusing things that\nyou have about you know if i really fix\nmyself if i get to be like completely\nnormal like what if people don't think\ni'm funny because so much of our\nhumor comes from pain\nand this is where i'd reassure you hutch\njust because you feel better about\nyourself doesn't mean you're going to\nlose access to that\nyou'll know what it feels like to be in\npain you'll be able to you know it's an\nold friend\nyou don't need a gps to navigate that\nroad anymore\nlike you know it by heart\nand it's\ngoing i wanted to ask you a question um\nyeah is the problem of identity of\npeople not having a strong sense of who\nthey are is this a common\nthing that's out there\ni mean it's just something that i i've\nstruggled with\nin such a\npronounced way for my whole life\nand i see some people\nobviously i don't have access to like\nevery detail of their lives but they\nseem so comfortable in their own skin\nand\ni feel like an alien a lot of the times\njust wondering how common that is\nyeah so it's a universal human condition\nand it's getting worse\nso if you look at like you know the\nsense of who you are as a person we\ntalked a little bit about how not being\nenough like that's not a real thing\nlike literally it's not a scientific\nthing it's a construction of the mind\nyou are what you are and the more that\nyou begin to realize that the more\ncomfortable you'll be in your own skin\nbecause he can't be any different\nis it again is it getting worse because\nof social media and the students\nyeah yes\nabsolutely\nand why would you ask about social media\nwhat's your hypothesis there\noh i mean i just spend way\nway too much time on twitter sometimes\nlike\nway too much time and um it's gotten\nbetter but i still have days where i'll\nbe on twitter interacting with people\nfor like eight hours\nand i feel like absolute [ __ ] at the end\nof it\nand then i wake up the next day and\nmaybe do it again like it's it's it's\nlike uh sort of like alcoholism in that\nyeah absolutely\nso let's talk about that for a second\nand then we'll talk about you and why\nit's been hard for you and what that\nmeans for your garma\nokay so\nyep oh yeah we're gonna go off the rails\nnow you ready okay i'm down\nso hutch the first thing to understand\nis that there's a self you remember how\nhe's talking about there's turbulent\nstuff at the top and then there's you\ndown below\nyep so the buddha called that the buddha\nbuddhism\nhe called that the self\nthe interesting thing is if you look at\nask these like yogi's from thousands of\nyears ago\nwhat is the self the answer they came up\nwith was neti neti and neti means not\nthis\nso if you ask someone if you ask these\nyogis what is the self is it\na person they'll say\nit's not that\nis it\na cosmic thing they'll say it's not that\nis it black not that is it white not\nthat\nis it conscious they'll say no is it\nunconscious no\nthey the self is formless\nand so i know it sounds kind of weird\nbut we'll ask you to do this in a second\nyou know i'll ask you to like meditate\nso like close your eyes and notice that\nthere's like an experiencer we'll go\nthrough this more formally in a second\nokay\nbut like there is a thing no not right\nnow\nthere's a thing that experiences all of\nyour life\nso the experiences can be separated\nthere's happiness and sadness but who is\nthe person who is experiencing the\nhappiness or sadness\nit kind of goes like one level like\ndeeper into the matrix\nand what they sort of realized is they\nfollowed the the matrix all the way back\nto its source and what they found was\nthe self\nso then what they sort of discovered is\nthat that thing is formless and we'll\nwe'll show you how to get there in a\nsecond sort of or take one step\nthen what they realized is that we also\nhave an identity but the identity and\nthe self are two different things so the\nidentity is what they call the ahamgara\nor the ego\nand the identity is anything about you\nit is not you it is anything about you\nso anything you can put down on a piece\nof paper\nis part of your ego but it's not really\nwho you are\nso for example i call you hutch\nis that your name\nwell sure i mean my first name is sean\nbut people call you hutch\nyeah people call you sean\nwhich one is you\ni think they're both me\nhow does that work\ni don't know i didn't think about it\nthat much i just answered reflexively\nyeah it's weird right so like i would\nsay that those things are both you and\nneither of them are you\nright if i like\nyou know does your nephew know that your\nname is sean\ni don't know he's very very young so i i\ndon't i don't know if he knows my name\nquite yet the answer is probably no but\ndoes he know who you are\nyeah\nhow's that possible\num because this little tiny human brain\nis\nforming memories\nsure right so there's something going on\nthere but name isn't a part of it\nso if you think about who am i\nif you ask me who am i i'm going to say\nmy name i'm all look like the first\nthing that we answer with is actually\nfalse it's not who we are it's just\nsomething that we attach to ourselves\nanything that you put on a resume is not\nwho you are it's part of your identity\nfor sure but it's not part of the self\nand so the fundamental confusion that we\nhave is we start to identify with our\nidentity which we can't really blame\nourselves for right because when i think\nabout like if i start to think of myself\nas like i'm a doctor and i\nattach myself to that identity or i\nthink of to myself as i'm someone who\napplied to medical school three times in\na row and failed to get in\nthat's all part of identity it's all\nthings that i can put on my resume it's\nlike people can ask me about it but it's\nnot who i am\nright it's just attributes of my life\nand that's where our suffering comes\nfrom because when i start to attach\nmyself of being a doctor i can become\nprideful which is going to be a source\nof suffering because once i have pride\nthere are doctors who are better than i\nam why don't i get\nrespected as much as other people do\nyou know they're doctors on tick tock\nwho have more followers than i do\nso any kind of seemingly positive thing\nthat comes out of identity actually\nbrings suffering with it and then what\nif i lose my medical license then\nsuffering comes with it\nso all of the attributes\nof our of our identity are the cause of\nour suffering that's what with the would\nsay and that the closer that you get to\nwho you are\nand you sort of remember this right\nbecause you had this fluctuating\nidentity didn't matter what the [ __ ] it\nwas like it could have been whatever it\nstill sucked\nuntil you got the hell away from all of\nit\nand i would venture that i don't know if\nyou've ever put your nephew to sleep but\nif you've ever put your nephew to sleep\nif you haven't you should try it\nsometime you know hopefully\nhe lives all the way up in the bay area\nso i don't get to see him as much so\nmaybe one day you'll have kids and then\nyou'll understand this when you put your\nkid to sleep like there's no hutch\nthere's no content creator there's no\nor maybe you've got a fiance right so i\ndon't know if you've like ever fallen\nasleep with your fiance or she's ever\nfallen asleep and you just like laid in\nbed with her and in that moment like\nyou're not you don't have a beard\nyou don't have a certain hair color\nyou're not like a particular height you\njust are you\nand you're holding her and there's just\nan experience there\nand the more that you tap into that\nexperience or you don't have a bank\naccount you don't have a mortgage you\ndon't even have a name you're just like\na human and you're in enveloped within\nthat experience and it feels [ __ ]\namazing\nwatching a sunset\nyou know\nyeah\nlike\ntaking a really good piss\nafter you've been driving for a long\ntime\nand at that point yeah i chase i chased\nthat feeling that that\nclarity i suppose you could call it the\nthe\nstillness i i've chased that feeling\nwith all kinds of destructive ways\nthroughout my life because my\nthoughts are so loud\nand so gambling that would quiet those\nthoughts or drugs may have quieted those\nthoughts or sex may have quieted those\nthoughts and so beautiful or or\nobsessively playing video games or chess\ni mean just i would chase that feeling\nof stillness because whenever i would\nnot have something to stimulate my mind\nthese loud negative thoughts would just\nsort of\nswim in my mind with you a hundred\npercent right so now we come to social\nmedia and dopamine\nyeah so what happens so first thing is\nthat social media amplifies our ego\nbecause what we're doing is we're not\nshowing we're showing ourselves to the\nworld right it's all about display it's\nall about resume it's all about what you\nshow it's not about who you are\nand so is where that we actually have a\nlot of like stuff that is moving us away\nfrom our\nself and into our identity and so\nsuffering is coming with it but holy\n[ __ ] is it dopaminergically reinforcing\nbecause it feels good\nright sometimes\nyeah and it and it feels bad which then\nbegs the question why on earth are we\ndoing it if it feels bad so you know\nlike you're kind of saying you're on\ntwitter for eight hours and that's where\nlike what's happening is we're getting\nlike that dopamine reinforcement without\nany sort of like spiritual gratification\nit's like spiritually empty\nyes right and so this is where what we\nwe tend to find is that people chase\noblivion they chase the stillness they\nactually chase nirvana which is like the\nstate of enlightenment\nwith drugs\nbecause it like it gets us kind of close\nto there\nand this is why like buddha figured this\nout and he was like\nyou can get to that sense of peace\nconsistently and even permanently you\ncan live in that way where 24 7 you are\ndetached from your identity and you're\njust living as an experiencer and that\nis enlightenment\nand he was like that would work in the\nwestern world but yeah\nso it it wouldn't\nright so this is the challenge is that\nlike someone who's enlightened doesn't\ncare about their resume and so they\nwon't necessarily chase success and so\nit is problematic\nhe ran into a lot of problems in his\nmaterial life\nand then we kind of get to why you've\nstruggled for it\nwhy this has been a problem for you and\nthat's because your karma\nis\nto learn\nso i think you've been given so i've\nnoticed this really interesting trend\nwhich is that people who have a lot to\nbe grateful for suffer a lot in terms of\nquestions of like identity\nand so there's an interesting there's\neven an interesting theory that\nthe more ready you are for spiritual\ngrowth the greater advantages you'll be\nborn with\nbecause you can't meditate on an empty\nstomach you can't chase enlightenment if\nyou have to worry about making rent at\nthe end of the month\nliterally the adrenaline and cortisol\nand the stress you don't have time for\nany of that crap\nand it feels a bit\ni i don't know if it feels a bit like\nearlier than now though\nit looked like well i had good karma\ntherefore i've been you know i've had\nsome yeah\nso i don't like thinking about it in\nterms of separating me from other people\nit could have been just a crap shoot\njust total luck luck of the draw yeah so\nthat's your ego as well\nso any comparison that you make to\nanother person is your ego\nokay we're not talking about other\npeople we're talking about you\nokay you know if you think about taking\ncare of your nephew does that make you a\nbetter uncle than most people\nsure\nmost people aren't going to do as much\nfor their nephew as you will\nbecause\nmost people's enough you still have a\nmom\nbut we're not concerned about them we're\nnot saying that you're holier than now\nit's just it's your [ __ ] duty\nit is it is you\nhas nothing to do with anyone else\nall right\nso i wouldn't worry about that like\nseriously\nthis is an important point and it's all\nthere it's their karma too don't worry\nabout it\nso i say this to a lot of people\nbut it's important for you to understand\nthat like this like this is an important\nquestion for like your growth as a human\nyou know and i think you're grappling\nwith which i think is super healthy like\nit's fantastic\nthe question being who am i or what yes\nyes\nand this idea of like you know when i\nshare with you that you're not and not\nnot enough is not a real thing\nall you've ever been is what you are and\nall you will ever be is what you are\nand the more centered you become in that\nthe happier you'll\nbe i get kind of tripped up on i just\nsometimes i think about\nthe fact that i'm one bad year away from\nbeing a monster you know like i don't\nif i go through some\nsome people that we we consider to be\nevil or whatever um\nthey had a\nyoung self they had a young pure self at\none point and then something happened to\nthem people don't choose to become evil\nand do evil things\nso sometimes i think about like the\nfragility of\nof uh identity and how it can be broken\ndown by horrible and traumatic\nexperiences and i get afraid\nand what if something really [ __ ] up\nhappens to me and then\ni turn into a monster i i don't think\nabout that so much any anymore these\ndays i'm i have those thoughts less but\nthat was one thing i got really tripped\nup on when i was about\n19 or 20\ni couldn't see a meaningful difference\nbetween me and\nyou know evil people\nit's all turbulence at the top\ni'm not saying that you didn't see i'm\nwith you\nthat you had those thoughts\nbut\neven if you're a monster i know it\nsounds kind of weird\nyou are what you\nare right and i know that sounds kind of\nlike a weird spiritual statement but\nit's actually like a scientific\nstatement no you can't you know and so\nthat's where like and the more you begin\nto understand that\nlike sometimes you got to be careful\nbecause you'll have like false gurus\nwho will use that as justification to do\nhorrendous things\nthe most common example is you know\nspiritual gurus who put their dick where\nit doesn't belong\nno that happens\nall the time\nso but but i actually think that on some\nlevel like you know you have to\nunderstand that we're all one step away\nfrom becoming a monster\nthat's how we\nyou have to respect it\nright that's what's going to make you\nlike a good person\nlike is like the the people the people\nwho commit the worst evils in the world\nare the ones who are convinced that\nthey're righteous and they're not\nmonsters\nsure yeah\nso so i and i think this this also goes\ninto\nlike\nnon-dualism and things like that but\nthis is just the idea that there's\nneither good nor bad there's just what\nis like like you know go outside and\nlook at a flower is the flower good or\nis it bad then look at a blade of grass\nis the blade of grass good or bad now if\nyour mind is comparative it'll say that\nthe flower is prettier than the blade of\ngrass then you'll assign a judgment you\nwon't accept things as they are and then\nyou'll elevate some people and you'll\nyou'll denigrate others\nthe blade of grass is just doing its\nthing\nyou know yeah that's isn't that more or\nless the whole point of the yin yang the\nthe fact that the it's all encompassed\nin one circle so that's duality is an\nillusion\nyes\nyes yeah\nyeah and so are you a monster or are you\na good person\ni mean i can be a shitty person for sure\nbut i i\ni genuinely try to be a good person i\ntry to be an empathetic person yeah so i\nthink as long as you live that way right\nso as long as you recognize that there's\nboth within you\nthen i think you'll move towards being a\nbetter person\nand and if we think about like you know\nwhat that core is that core of you is\ncapable of everything and nothing are\nyou sean or you hutch well i'm kind of\nboth\nand there are arguments to be made that\nthat's a contradiction that you can't be\ntwo people sean\nright people will say like you can't be\nboth that's stupid you got to have one\nname but no that's not how it is they're\nneat it's neither you you're not a\nmonster you're not a good person you are\nwhat you are\neverything and nothing\nyep yeah\nyeah okay\nwell you've given me a lot to think\nabout\nthat's what we're here for\num i've really enjoyed this conversation\nby the way thanks thank you for having\nme on i appreciate the insight me too\nhow do you feel about learning a little\nbit of meditation\nuh\nmy thoughts get loud but i'm down i'm\ni'm open to the experience okay\nso\nif this isn't um\nif this is hard for you not a big deal\nthere are other techniques that we'll\nwe'll send you so we have a we made a\nmeditation guide and you should get\naccess to that just because you're a\nguest on stream so you know you can\nwatch that and there are a bunch of\ntechniques like introductory things that\nyou can start with but based on where\nyou are there's a particular technique\nthat i want to share with you\nand it's kind of tricky so it's sort of\nan advanced technique and you may not be\nready for it yet you may have to work up\nto it but i still want to share it with\nyou okay\nso\ni'm going to start reading to you okay\nbut what i want you to do is close your\nso sit up straight so your spine should\nbe straight when you meditate and then\ni'm going to start saying different\nthings to you okay\nbut what i and that i'm going to\ninstruct you to pay attention to\ndifferent things while i'm speaking to\nyou it's gonna be weird okay so first\ni'm gonna ask you to pay attention to\nthe words\nthat i'm saying\nall right\nand then what i'm gonna ask you to pay\nattention to is not the words\nbut where the words enter your ear\nso i want you to notice not what you\nhear\nbut the faculty of hearing\ndoes that make sense\nyeah\nand so what we're going to sort of\nrecognize is that the words are outside\nof you right there's you and then\nthere's the words on the outside with me\nyeah\nand how do we determine that the words\nare on the outside it's because you are\nobserving them so you're the observer\nand they're the object of observation\nright\nand so then what's going to happen is\nwhen i ask you to observe the faculty of\nhearing is the faculty of hearing a part\nof you or is it then outside of you\nokay so i know it's it's weird\nfeels inside i don't know it does feel\ninside that's why we're gonna do this\npractice okay\nso\num i want you to start by listening to\nmy words okay\nand just try to you know interpret them\nand understand them so the development\nof adult attachment styles for lessons\nwhy are some adults secure or insecure\nin their relationships the authors\nreview four lessons they have learned\nfrom longitudinal research on the\ndevelopmental antecedents of adult\nattachment styles\nfirst although adult attachment appears\nto have its origins in early caregiving\nexperiences\nthose associations are weak and\ninconsistent across measurement domains\nsecond attachment styles appear to be\nmore malleable in childhood and\nadolescence\nso now what i want you to do is don't\nlisten to my words i'm gonna keep\nreading but i want you to pay attention\nto the faculty of hearing\nnotice your ability to hear\nand don't really focus on the words okay\nthird early experiences do not determine\nadult outcomes fourth there is still a\nlot to learn and future research\nrequires examining relationship specific\nattachment patterns the distinction\nbetween distal and proximal factors and\ninteractions between relational and\ngenetic vulnerabilities\naddresses\nuniversity of illinois at\nurbana-champaign usa\nuniversity of minnesota usa\ncorresponding author\nfraylee r chris\nso now what i want you to do i'm going\nto keep reading to you in a second\nis\nmove between hearing my words right now\nand noticing the faculty of hearing\nand notice that as the experiencer\nyou can observe the words on the outside\nand the words are on the outside and the\nperson who experiences it is on the\ninside\nbut as you notice now go to the faculty\nof hearing\nand notice that as you as you move into\nthe faculty of hearing suddenly the\nexperiencer goes further within\nand your ability to hear\nis actually\noutside of you now you're observing it\nfrom within\nit's no longer a part of you but is\nactually outside of you\nand now what we're gonna do is open your\neyes\nand look at my face\nand see my face\nsee the different now look at your room\nnotice all the different objects in your\nroom\nand i want you to pick one direction\nand instead of looking at an object let\nyour eyes remain open\nnotice the faculty of sight\nso notice that there is a looking not on\nany particular object\nbut that there's like all sorts of\nobjects there and that there's a looker\nand put your attention on the site\nitself not the object of the site\ndoes that make sense\nas much as it can\nand so if you want to do the third level\nof this practice\nyou can actually\nnotice the faculty of sight\nokay\nthen what you can do is look at a\npicture of your sister\nand what you'll see is that within the\nwhen you look at the picture of sister\nthere's the object\nyou can notice the faculty of sight and\nthen there's an internal emotional\nexperience that'll happen when you see\nher and then what i want you to do is\nzoom out and look at that emotional\nexperience there will be sadness there\nwill be grief there will be tragedy\nthere will be love but you can even take\na step back from that and just look at\nall of those feelings\nand when you keep on going all the way\ninside what you'll notice is that\neven though you feel sad there will be\npeace in spite of the sadness\nand then eventually if you keep going\nyou'll find what's at the bottom of the\nocean and that everything above it is\nwaves\nis that the same thing as catharsis\nso i'd say catharsis is a slice of this\nprocess but it goes deeper than\ncatharsis\nyeah\nso\nwhat a what catharsis is what i'd say is\nthat as long as the mind is turbulent we\ncan't see inside and all the knowledge\nis really at the bottom\nwhat catharsis is is like\na moment where all the waves are still\nand then we can see into something and\nthen we have like this revelation that\nis like transformative\nyeah\nbut it goes even deeper than that\nso i'd say that\nthere are stages of enlightenment and\ni'd say catharsis is arguably like\ncatharsis in the flow state or like\nearly early early stages of some idea or\ntemporary enlightenment\nokay gotcha\nwell i did feel um\na bit calmer after that exercise\nimmediately opening opening my eyes felt\nlike i was in a different place\nyeah so you know i think the good news\nis that the spiritual stuff like we\ndon't really know\nmuch\nif any of that [ __ ] works we just don't\nknow there just isn't data the good news\nis that any of it will affect your\ncortisol and neuro adrenaline\nany of it will affect your co2 your\nrespiratory rate your o2\nall those things no spiritual stuff\naside from like a physiologic\nperspective there's overwhelming data\nthat you know any kind of mindfulness\npractice will help\nso at the least you'll get some kind of\nphysiologic benefit and if any of this\nweird spiritual stuff happens to be\ncorrect you may get something a little\nbit more\nhow often do you meditate\ndo you do it every day every day\nso i do different kinds of meditation\nthere's one sort of meditation that i've\ndone every day\nbut at a minimum of three breaths is is\nlike kind of the core meditation that i\ndo and then i'll do like formal\nmeditation practices maybe about 20\nminutes a day three to five days a week\nokay\nit sounds like a realistic goal yeah so\ni'd start with five minutes and it i\ndon't know if you know but our practice\nwas like two or three minutes that's it\nman\nso like you don't have to do a whole lot\nto feel a little bit better i was\nteaching this one practice in the\nemergency room that was like\n180 seconds and people loved it it was\nenough for them\nbut\ncool i had um one more question for you\nthat's okay yeah you said that you\nworked with um terminally ill patients\ni'm wondering\nwhat kind of an effect that had on you i\nmean how did you\nhow do you not\nsuccumb to the overwhelming sadness you\nmust have felt connecting with these\npeople that were coming to the end of\ntheir lives what is it what does\nmaintenance for a therapist look like\nit's a beautiful question so um how did\nit affect me it helped me understand\nlife in a profound way\nso i am grateful for that ex there's a\nhandful of experiences i'm really\ngrateful for and that's definitely the\ntop of the list\nyeah you know we live our entire lives\nlike getting caught up with crap that\ndoesn't matter\ntalking about like oh you know so and so\ndidn't like invite me to their birthday\nparty\nyou know and like there's like even crap\ngoing on like in the residency where\nlike\nyou know there's like a class president\nand like people are applying for crap\nand this person like five people are\napplying for this grant and only one\nperson got it it's all kind of crap that\nour ego\ngets wrapped up in that we think is\nimportant because it has to do with me\nso the biggest lesson that i learned is\nlike a lot of that crap doesn't matter\nreally gives you perspective\nyeah\nand as for how i survived\nwell i noticed the emotions and then i\nstepped away from them\nlet's see\nright so like even like i was super sad\nwith you like i felt tragedy and so be\nit\nright that's not tragedy is not i know\nit sounds kind of weird but it's not a\nbad part of life it's just a part of\nlife\nno i understand that\nso\nyeah\nwell\nthank you so much for your time i\nappreciate the um a little bit of\nclarity you helped me get today it means\na lot to me thank you for coming on and\nsharing and i really you
