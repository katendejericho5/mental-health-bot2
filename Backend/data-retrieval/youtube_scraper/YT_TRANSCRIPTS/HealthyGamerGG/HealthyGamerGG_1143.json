    "transcript": "so if you're feeling jealous towards\nother people if you find yourself sort\nof having this mental frankenstein then\ni'd highly highly recommend that you\nsort of really think about where\nthoughts come from\nwhere your own unhappiness comes from\nunderstanding the relationship between\nyour unhappiness ego and comparison and\nthen start to learn how to cultivate\nthoughts in the right direction so we're\ngoing to talk i'm going to move to a\ndifferent prompt for a second but you\nknow basically like\ni want you all to really think long and\nhard about like what is the influence of\ndifferent things on the thoughts in your\nhead\nokay\nso what we're going to talk about now is\nlike where do thoughts come from so i\nknow it sounds like kind of a weird\nquestion but i'd love to talk to you\nguys because i think it's really\nimportant to understand like where the\nthoughts in your head come from if\nyou're a doomer if you think that the\nworld is going to hell if you think\nyou're going to be alone for the rest of\nyour life where do those thoughts come\nfrom and how can you start to go about\ncontrolling your mind so let's take a\nquick look at a case\ni am more than my sex life i compare\nmyself to my friends all the time over\neverything imaginable relationship\nstatus social media presence physique\nmental health career goals sense of\nhumor etc the list goes\nas specific as you can imagine i compare\nmy friends sex lives to my own\nnon-existent one this is the most\nembarrassing comparison i make\nyet the one that affects me the most as\na result i'm extremely jealous of my\nfriends on basically every level\neverything i want my friends seem to\nhave so naturally or they have more of\nit it's leading me down a spiral where i\nhate myself the more i hang out with my\nfriends then that jealousy makes me feel\nlike a shitty friend because i want so\ndesperately to be a good friend and be\nsupportive of my friends without having\nit affect my self-confidence or\nself-perception but feeling crappy\ndoesn't stop my jealousy so i keep\nfeeling more jealous and then crappier\nit's a terrible thought loop and i've\nbeen struggling for with a year now\nanyway i'm making this post to remind\nmyself that i'm more than my virginity\ni'm terrified of relationships even\nthough i want to be in once so\ndesperately so i'm extremely jealous of\npeople who don't struggle with\nself-loathing to the point where they\npanic at just the idea of falling in\nlove with someone and having them fall\nin love with you back i have to believe\nthat i'm more than my virginity even\nthough it feels like my non-existent\nsex life is indicative of so much more\nof being unlovable because i'm not\ngiving up\ni have to remind myself that my\nvirginity doesn't define me unless i let\nit it's really hard to but i have to\nit's really hard to feel like i'm living\nin my friend's shadows when i hang out\nwith them but i have to i'm thankful i\nfound this community and i have this\noutlet\nso this is a fantastic post so let's the\nfirst thing that i want to point out to\ny'all is do you guys notice the war\nthat goes on in the mind so the mind\nsometimes produces\nparticular thoughts and sometimes we\nfight against those thoughts and there's\na lot of exploration of this in in dr\nk's guide and this is something that i\nthink would be really good because there\nare a lot of points in dr k's guide that\ni would encourage this person to check\nout one is the mental frankenstein so\nwhen our mind makes comparisons\nwhat it always does is since those\ncomparisons tend to be fueled by\ninsecurities what our mind constructs is\na mental frankenstein\nanytime i make a comparison i make a\ncomparison that proves my own insecurity\nso i don't compare 10 dimensions against\none person what i do is i compare\n10 people and i look at the best things\nthat each of those people do and i i\npick the best things for from 10 people\nand i compare them to myself so this\nperson says i compare myself to my\nfriends in all aspects careers sex life\nhow they look how social they are and so\nif your mind wants to if you have that\nfeeling\nfeeling of insecurity what you'll do is\ncreate this mental frankenstein of how\nyou were inferior all the time to\neveryone and it's a very unfair\ncomparison\nso then the question becomes okay so\nlike if you're having these kinds of\nthoughts this person is trying to say\nokay i'm more than my virginity etc so\nwhat do you do in this situation what do\nyou do if you make lots of comparisons\nand you feel really jealous of the\npeople that you care about right so\nthere are two things that you can do one\nis you can get to the root of the\ninsecurity so there's a very important\nyogic principle\nthat sort of shows where insecurities\ncome from and why we compare when we\nhave insecurities so we'll get to that\nin a second\nthe second thing that we can do is\ncultivate the right kinds of thoughts so\nwhat is this yogic principle i'm talking\nabout\nso anytime that your mind feels negative\nemotion or feels insecure\nthere's a part of your mind called the\nahamkar which activates\nand the aham god is your ego and is sort\nof like the bouncer of your mind so\nanytime you feel insecure the ahm god\nwill activate and will do one of two\nthings it'll either pump yourself up or\nput other people down or it'll make\ncomparisons so if we kind of think about\nit all kind of comparison is coming from\nthe ego so it's sort of like you know\nanytime i compare myself to someone else\nto make that comparison i have to have\nan idea of myself and what i am all\ncomparison is driven by ego so like if i\nlook at someone else and i genuinely\nappreciate them and i don't think about\nmyself i'm like oh look at how happy my\nfriend is he got a you know he found a\nnew partner it sounds like he's like\ncrushing it and he's like really in love\nlike that's fantastic\nnotice that that appreciation\nhas to in order for that appreciation to\nexist there can't be any ego involved\nthe second that my mind produces oh let\nme compare that to myself because all\ncomparisons are going to have like at\nleast ego comparisons are going to be\ncomparisons to yourself\nso that's going to involve ego ego steps\nand then i start thinking about who i am\nin my identity because you can't make\nthat comparison unless you have a\nparticular identity\nso what should you do about that so that\ninsecurity or that ego is gonna come\nback to some kind of emotional\nexperience or emotion that you're\nfeeling and as you work on the source of\nthat emotion what's gonna happen is the\nego will actually calm down and then\nyou'll be able to appreciate what your\nfriends have because then like you know\nyou have no insecurity that that goes\nthat underlies that ego fuel\nso then the question becomes okay how do\ni work on my internal emotions so this\nis something that you can you know if\nyou have clinical concerns or things\nlike that this is something that\nabsolutely um you know therapists can\nhelp you do this is something that we\ntrain our coaches to do which is sort of\nlike help you understand your emotions\nand where those kinds of like emotions\ncome from and it turns out that as you\nstart to like recognize the underlying\nemotion like the jealousy and the ego\nabove it will start to fall apart\nbecause the only way that you can be\njealous of someone is if you yourself\ndon't have something so this is the\nquestion that i would ask this person if\nyou were in a healthy loving\nrelationship that was like positively\nsexual would you still feel jealous of\nyour friends and the answer is almost\ncertainly overwhelmingly no right and so\nif we really think about that then\nwhat is the what is the key to disarming\njealousy it has nothing to do with them\nthey haven't changed at all their\nsituation is actually exactly the same\nwhat needs to change is you what needs\nto change is your perception of yourself\nbecause the other interesting thing is\nthat you don't have to have a\nrelationship that is loving in order to\nstop feeling jealous towards other\npeople that's what we think so we always\nthink that sort of fixing something on\nthe in the external world will be the\nsolution to our internal problems but\nwhat you really need to do is work on\nthat sense of being unlovable work on\nthat sense of being ashamed work on that\nsense that you'll be alone forever right\nso this person even says\ni'm terrified of relationships even\nthough i want to be one\nso desperately i'm extremely jealous of\npeople who don't struggle with\nself-loathing to the point where they\npanic and this is what you need to fix\nright why are you terrified of\nrelationships why do you struggle with\nself-loathing like you know like why do\nyou panic at the idea of falling in love\nas long as these things are there\nthat jealousy will continue to exist\nright so then the question becomes when\ndid you start to feel\nlike like when did you start to become\nterrified of relationships how did your\nbrain learn\nto fear relationships and as you do that\nkind of work as you ask those kinds of\nquestions as you work through those\nissues then the jealousy will actually\ncollapse it'll like just kind of fizzle\napart right as your own insecurities\nstart to get metabolized as you start to\nbuild confidence the jealousy will\nactually kind of just it'll fall apart\nbecause it has no basis because the\njealousy is based on an idea of what you\ndon't have and that idea of what you\ndon't have is based on your fear your\nshame your sense of unlovableness so the\nsecond thing that you can do is be\ncareful about the way that you cultivate\nthoughts\nso when we talk about cultivating\nthoughts what i mean is that if you\nreally think about it and there's a lot\nof information about this in the the\nguides by the way\nso if you think about where does a\nthought come from right so we were just\ntalking a little bit about you know how\nthe world is going to hell\nwhere does the idea that the world is\ngoing to hell come from it comes from\nexternal sources right it comes from the\nindriyas and when i get exposed to\nthings through my sense organs either\nthrough sight or sound that exposure\nwill create particular thoughts so i\ndon't know if you guys is going to sound\nlike kind of a weird question but how\nmany people do you thought\nhow many people do you think we're\nlooking forward to wow classic in 1979\nnot a single one right no one was\nlooking forward to wow classic in 1979.\nwhy is that why did no one look why did\nno one think about wow classic in 1979\nbecause their indriyas had never gotten\nsense exposure to it right when did\npeople start to look forward to wow\nclassic when their sense organs\nencountered something if you think about\npeople who are addicted to video games\nwhy are they addicted to video games\nit's because their mind dwells in those\nthoughts all the time when i play a game\ni'm thinking about it right so the more\ntime that my mind spends thinking about\na game the more hours it spends thinking\nabout a game then when i turn the game\noff i've cultivated i've spent a lot of\ntime growing those kinds of thoughts so\neven when i'm not playing the game i'm\nthinking about the game and this makes a\nlot of sense if you look at games that\nactually aren't fun to play\nif you talk to people who are addicted\nto video games\nwhat they'll say is that i don't even\nenjoy playing the game anymore like you\ntalk to law players or dota players or\nlike whatever and they'll say like\nit's frustrating to play it's not\nactually fun but i can't stop and even\nwhen they're not playing the game they\nlike start thinking about the game when\nthey go to bed they think about their\ngame they're like oh my god that game\nwas so crappy i hated it that person fed\nso much and so what it turns out is that\nyour the thoughts in your head can\nactually be cultivated right so the more\nsensory exposure that you get to a\nparticular thing the more you will\ncultivate that thing we also see this in\ncases of trauma right so if someone\ngrows up in an emotionally abusive\nhousehold where they're told that\nthey're like a crappy person and that\nthey're not worth anything\nthat sensory exposure will start to\ncreate thought-generating machines in\nthe mind and that's what they'll think\nto themselves all the time thoughts\nbegin from kind of the outside world\nright they come in through our sensory\norgans so you have to be very careful\nabout what kinds of thoughts you\ncultivate the second thing is that once\na thought enters your mind you can\nchoose to engage with it or you can\nchoose not to engage with it and we see\nevidence of that here too i compare\nmyself to my friends all the time over\neverything imaginable so as long as you\nare giving in to that desire to compare\nas long as you are letting thought\nnumber one compare to thought\nchain into thought number two and grow\nthought number three what i want you\nguys to to realize is that this person\nhas a gigantic fruit-bearing tree and\nthe fruits that it actually grows are\ncomparative thoughts and we see that it\ncompares to all kinds of stuff right\nbecause at this point\nthis person is compared so much has\ncultivated all of these thoughts of\ncomparison that the second they start to\nmake one comparison their mind they'll\ngive into it and their mind will make a\nsecond comparison third comparison\nfourth comparison fifth comparison and\nthen when they go see their friend and\ntheir friend is like you know there with\ntheir new\nlike girlfriend or boyfriend\nthat sensory trigger will activate this\ncomplex within the mind that has been\nheavily heavily cultivated fertilized\nwatered and then the comparison train\nwill begin\nso then the question becomes how do i\nstop cultivating a particular thought\nso what you need to do is notice\nthat when your mind starts to make\ncomparisons that you can indulge in that\nthought or you cannot indulge in that\nthought you can start to change the way\nthat you think and we see that this\nperson is doing that too right so as i\nmake anyway i'm making this post to\nremind myself that i am more than my\nvirginity right so what this person is\ndoing is like the thought comes comes up\nin their mind that i am based on my sex\nmy value as a human being is based on my\nsexual experience and there's another\npossibility that you can sort of start\nto cultivate thoughts that actually you\nknow my value as a human being doesn't\nnecessarily have to relate to my\nvirginity\nthere are actually things that you can\ndo that will cultivate thoughts in a\ndifferent direction\nso one recommendation that i'd have for\npeople who experience a lot of jealousy\nis ask yourself if you were in a happy\nplace\nwould you still feel ill will towards\nthe other person\nand then if the answer to that question\nis probably no you wouldn't feel ill\nwell like so if you feel jealous of\nsomeone else's relationship ask yourself\nif i am if i was happier in my\nrelationship would i be jealous then the\nanswer is no and then what you ask\nyourself is okay so what am i unhappy\nabout in my relationship and as you do\nthat what you're going to be kind of\ndoing two things one is you're going to\nbe\nstopping the process of cultivating\ncomparative thoughts you're going to be\nsort of reigning in the jealousy because\nif you don't ask yourself that question\nyou're going to think about how jealous\nyou are you're going to think about how\ngood they have it and for the next 30\nminutes you're going to be fertilizing\nyour comparison tree\nso instead ask yourself what am i\nunhappy about and then as you go through\nthat introspection not only are you\nstopping the cultivation of comparison\nyou were also introspecting about your\nown unhappiness\nand as you sort of start to ask those\nquestions and hopefully do it in sort of\na productive way where you start to try\nto remain a little bit objective try to\naccept yourself for who you are\nhopefully you'll get to the root of the\nyour unhappiness and you'll start to\nmetabolize that as well\nso if you're feeling jealous towards\nother people if you find yourself sort\nof having this mental frankenstein then\ni'd highly highly recommend that you\nsort of really think about where\nthoughts come from where your own\nunhappiness comes from understanding the\nrelationship between your unhappiness\nego and comparison and then start to\nlearn how to cultivate thoughts in the\nright direction there are a lot of\ndifferent things in dr k's guide that\nrelate to this concept and this is sort\nof like why it's hard because there's\nnot going to be one video about this but\nthere's actually half a dozen videos so\ni'd recommend looking at the video on\nsangha or community that's a video that\nexplains where thoughts come from\nthere's another video about you know the\nmental frankenstein i think it's falling\nbehind and the depression uh\nthe depression guide but this concept of\nlike how do we make comparisons there's\na lot of stuff in the meditation guide\nabout the nature of confidence versus\nego and where ego comes from and what is\nego there's a long lecture like almost\nan hour-long lecture on vedic psychology\nthat explains the relationship between\nyour emotions and your ego and your\nintellect and how we make different\nkinds of comparisons so there's a lot of\ngood stuff in there there's not a\nspecific video about this but i think as\nyou understand all of those different\nconcepts hopefully you'll be able to\nlike really get a good handle on sort of\nwhat we talked about today\nvery shelley's for aging in her grave no\ni think mary shelley shouldn't be raging\ni think that she's done a very good job\ni guess frankenstein's monster\nmaybe that's why she's raging in her\ngrave but\num i i think she did a wonderful job of\ngiving us a concept that we can then use\nbecause frankenstein isn't isn't the\nthing that was stitched together right\nit was the doctor fair enough"
