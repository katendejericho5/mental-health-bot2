    "transcript": "so today we're going to do something fun and \nsomething different something i'm really looking  \nforward to so you know we've been on the david \npakman show i think about twice now and um you  \nknow really appreciate his dialogue in the way \nthat he works and the way he thinks and stuff  \nlike that and so you know the last time we were on \non david pakman's show we sort of talked a little  \nbit about you know sometimes he'll he'll say \nthat people will kind of disagree with him and  \nwill be pretty vocal and i sort of mentioned to \nhim that you know it would be really cool to like  \nsort of talk to someone in an open-ended \nnon-judgmental manner about you know what they  \nbelieve and how they came to believe it because \ni find that so much of political discourse right  \nnow is like really just you know plastering the \nother side as backward or idiots or whatever and  \none of the things that i really appreciate about \nyou know training to be kind of non-judgmental  \nthrough you know be training to become a monk \nand sort of accepting people where they're at  \nand like learning how to listen is all and also \nlike learning how to be a good listener through  \num you know training as a therapist i think that \nthose skills can actually be applied to like you  \nknow non-therapeutic or non-spiritual places and \none of the goals that we we kind of are focused on  \nyou know here at healthy gamer is just to try to \nunderstand people right and educate people about  \ndifferent different perspectives and so a lot of \ntimes our focus has been on like mental health but  \nsometimes we'll talk about stuff like you know \nhow to efficiently study and things like that  \nbut today we're going to try something a little \nbit different and we're going to hop into a call  \nwith david pakman as well as a long time i don't \nknow if i should call him fan of the show but um  \nyou know there's someone who's who disagrees a lot \nwith david pakman but i understand calls in a lot  \nand i think they've got like a good and healthy \ndialogue hopefully and that's jimmy from philly  \nand so we're going to hop in with them and we're \njust going to talk to jimmy for uh and david for  \na little while and try to sort of understand you \nknow a little bit about jimmy's experience of the  \nworld and what he believes so i know it's a little \nbit different but i'm really looking forward to it  \num and let's get started welcome everyone \ndavid do you want to go ahead and kick things  \noff or let me do that yeah just to kind of \nset the the situation here um so basically  \ni talked to all sorts of people on my show \nat some point jimmy started calling in and we  \nknow jimmy is jimmy from philly and we would he \nwould bring to me different ideas and questions  \nand i found jimmy to be an interesting \ncharacter a sad character in many ways  \na concerning character in some ways as well um i \nthink our rapport is sort of okay although jimmy  \ndoes regularly say you know homophobic things \ntransphobic things racist things etc and i  \nthink there's probably a lot to dig into there \nabout the the sort of origins or oranges of that  \num a couple things i'll mention about you \nknow our dialogue with with jimmy um jimmy  \nhas talked to me about his um problems with \nalcohol and you guys can probably see he's  \ngot some bottles there over his right shoulder and \nthat's something i've talked to jimmy about before  \num jimmy has talked about how he has a daughter \nbut at least at one point wasn't allowed to see  \nher because of some physical violence that jimmy \nwas at least i'll say he was accused of and we'll  \nmaybe leave it to jimmy to tell us more about the \nspecifics of that um jimmy was also arrested not  \nlong ago because of as i understand it chasing \na car with four black teenagers down the street  \nwhile intoxicated and that led to a sort of legal \nsituation as well for jimmy and that's kind of the  \njimmy that i that i know big picture and every \nonce in a while jimmy will say something that's  \nsort of open and he seems open to considering \nother ideas etc but very quickly he'll go back  \ninto the transphobia the homophobia the racism \num and uh and that that's kind of that's jimmy  \nas far as my relationship with him which has \nbeen through the internet and through my show\nquite the introduction so i want to just clarify \na couple things so i noticed um you know david  \nmentioned like alcohol use and things like that \nso just to clarify and make sure we're all on  \nthe same page jimmy i am a psychiatrist but i and \nmy understanding of this conversation is that you  \nknow i'm not here because david's here too we're \ngonna just three people having a conversation i  \nwanted to just make sure that are you under the \nimpression that i'm your medical doctor or that  \ni'm not going to diagnose you with anything yeah \ntreat you for anything okay so we're just going to  \nhave a conversation and and try to understand \neach other better so the goal of what we do  \num the reason i stream is just so that we \ncan try to understand people better and  \nshare that understanding with everyone who's \nwatching um are you kind of cool with that yes  \num just so you understand you know if after the \ncall if you do sort of decide that you do want  \nmental health support or treatment or things like \nthat you're welcome to kind of message us and we  \ncan kind of provide you with resources we do that \nfor every uh you know guest that that comes on um  \nit you know but that's kind of at your request \nwe're not going to push anything on you or  \nrecommend anything or anything like that it's \njust sometimes fine okay um so jimmy is it okay  \nif i uh kind of ask you i mean do you want to \nshare a little bit like do you want to offer an  \nintroduction or or i've got a couple yeah i mean \nyeah so first of all like how did it feel to hear  \ndavid's kind of like litany of how he introduced \nyou well he's gotten a little bit wrong actually  \nokay can you when i did the call with him last \nyear um i clearly said that they were four  \nblack 20-somethings not teenagers um this didn't \noccur in philadelphia it occurred in the suburb  \nof philadelphia um let's see what else um i was \narrested for public drunkenness but i beat the  \ncase they had a video of me going after her car \nit doesn't prove that i was drunk they the rest  \nof me because i was off my the video showed them \nthat i was off the property and they said i was  \npublicly drunk the video showed that i was \nangry not that i was drunk i was drunk but  \ni i was very i i wasn't that drunk i was they \nwere ready to let me go at the police station  \ni said the m were in the back of the police \ncar so they wouldn't let me go sure so what  \ni'm kind of hearing is that like you didn't get a \nfair rap from david well doc here's what happened  \nokay so i'm a trump supporter i have signs on my \nlawn they continued to get stolen right so i sat  \nout there and was guarding them and i'm drinking a \nlittle bit while i'm out there four black men bomb  \nrushed the lawn they take signs real quick and \nthey ride around the clock torning me three times  \n[ __ ] whitey [ __ ] trump the second time \nthey did it around the house i got a knife  \nthird time they got caught at the light i ran \nafter the car i was a little tipsy i stopped to  \nstab the top of the tire i should have stabbed the \nsidewall but the knife just disintegrated in my  \nhand and uh they got out of the car laughing then \nchased me back to the house and something that we  \ntook a video of me doing this and uh they gave it \nto the cops and the cops locked me up for public  \ntalking this but i beat the case because they \nnever showed up they never they didn't have a case  \nso yeah so i i mean thanks for sharing that \njimmy i appreciate it but what i'm kind of  \ncurious about is like when you have kind of \nyour side of the story and like i was frankly  \nkind of shocked i mean david is it i mean is \nit okay if i be critical of you for a second  \nplease i wouldn't i would love it so like here \nhe is introducing you and like he starts off with  \nlike bottles in the back and like got arrested for \nthis and like you know it's kind of a weird way\nyeah i mean how does that feel \nto be i mean like because it's  \nalmost like he's sharing like the most \nnegative or provocative things about you  \nwell david's a propagandist what can \ni tell you i mean he's good at it yeah  \nyeah so how does that how does that make you kind \nof feel to be i was laughing the entire time i  \nnoticed that yeah that's what i was kind of asking \nright because and so so i don't get offended easy  \ndoc if that's what you're getting at i i really \ndon't people can say what they want i really don't  \ncare yeah so okay definitely a happy person yeah \nso now see what david wants to make hey out of in  \nthis situation is basically that i'm crazy for \ngoing after the car well i had two choices doc  \nhow many men are going to sit there when four \nmen come on to their lawn take their property  \ni don't give a [ __ ] what it was took for my \ntrump signs then they have to to marry me to  \ndrive around the neighborhood three times yelling \nracial appetites at me pointing me with the signs  \nout the window and i'm just supposed to sit there \nlike a little soy boy i don't think so that's not  \ngonna happen that's not the type of person i am i \nam going to do something about it right or wrong  \ni'm going to jail i don't give a [ __ ] you do \nsomething like that to me you are you're going  \nto get held responsible in some kind of way \nand you know i think the whole thing's funny  \nthe whole thing's funny you know so jimmy you kind \nof said that's not the kind of person i am can you  \nhelp me understand what kind of person you are \nwell apparently david would have sat on the wall  \nand watched these morons ride around and taunt him \ndavid thought it was crazy for me to go after them  \nyeah so jimmy i'm gonna just i may do something \na little bit unusual i may sort of ask a question  \nagain so like when i ask you like you said that's \nnot the kind of person i am and you say well david  \nwould have done this like i'm not interested \nin what kind of person david has destroyed  \nlike in other words i had two choices right \ni was either to call the police or do nothing  \nbut but david was trying to make me sound \ncrazy that and i actually took action and  \nwent after these people that just stole \nfrom me and do you [ __ ] i'm saying i'm  \nnot the kind of person that's going to sit \nthere and watch something like that yeah  \nyeah you know i i i get that uh so i'm i'm \ndo you oftentimes so what i'm hearing is  \nthat like you know a lot of people in your \nsituation kind of may lay down and take it  \nbut you're not going to lay down and take it why \nyeah but this was basically a thing david put out  \nthere you know like i was nuts for taking action i \nwas not crazy not just the type of person i am and  \ni wouldn't blame a guy for not doing nothing \nsure so i mean but yeah yeah and and do you  \nfind that oftentimes um you know people try \nto like paint you as crazy by sort of sharing  \nstories like this or or things like that well i \nam a little nuts doc i have no problem with that  \nwhat does that mean i do think that most \npeople wouldn't do i'm very aware of that  \nthat is my personality that's how i am can you \nhelp me understand that a little bit like what  \nwhat do you do that other people wouldn't \nlike help me understand like who are you bro  \nuh gee i don't know uh i i like to have \nfun okay um i see everything is funny um  \ni make fun of everybody and everyone including \nmyself okay see david see if i make fun of like a  \nhomosexual or transsexual let's face it \nthe man in the dress is the funniest thing  \nsince the dawn of time all right i'm sorry i make \nfun of these folks but that doesn't mean that i  \nhate them if these people want to be accepted as \nnormal then they better be ready to take jokes  \nyou understand yes because if if you're making \nthem some sacred cow which is what david does  \nand then that that's that's just they're not \nspecial people okay i have nothing against  \nthem but i think when [ __ ] is funny it's funny \nand i'm gonna point it out sure so what i'm kind  \nof hearing is the way that you you kind of you \nknow treat them in a sense fairly right because  \neveryone gets made fun of i don't treat them \nanywhere i make fun of them sure yeah big deal  \nthey can't handle that and you're wearing the \ndress trying to look if you look like steve i'm  \nnot calling you susie okay i'm just not doing it \ni'm not doing it i think in new york a landlord or  \nan employer is fined well over a hundred thousand \ndollars if they don't refer to these people  \nas a certain pronoun it could be they zur zay \nwhat that's insanity i'm not going to accept  \nyour delusion go ahead and be deluded you have the \nfreedom to do it but you're not going to force me  \nto address you as a woman when you're clearly \na man it's it's that simple this is com this  \nis logic it's science biology yeah and and so i'm \na little bit curious jimmy when when you sort of  \nyou know when there's a group of people that \nare defying science and logic and biology like  \nhow does that because you seem to get kind of \npassionate there as you were talking about it  \nhow does that kind of affect you it pisses \nme off and what pisses you off about it  \nwhat pisses me off you're trying to get me to \naccept your delusion you have the right to be  \ndelusional but you ain't making me look if you \nlook like steve i'm not calling you susie that  \nthat sums it up my whole philosophy on the issue \nsure i got no problem with gay people i got no  \nproblem with trans people i i think it's funny as \nhell i i i think it's abso [ __ ] lutely hilarious  \nand i mocked them but that doesn't mean i hate \nthem that doesn't mean if if i if look if i  \nwere the grand pooh bar would i stop it no i think \nit's hilarious it's a [ __ ] show i mean you know\ni just think it's funny and can you \nhelp me understand this may sound like  \na weird question okay but can you help me \nunderstand what you think is funny about it\na man in a dress that says it all okay my name's \nlinda and i got a deep voice i mean come on man  \nthis [ __ ] is funny okay okay i hear what you're \nsaying so i i think part of the problem with you  \nknow dissecting humor is this the moment you \ndissect it it kind of falls apart right um so  \npart of it is the commies are destroying \ncomedy that's what it really is  \nokay everybody wants to get you don't have the \nright not to be offended you don't people can make  \nfun of you it doesn't make them hateful people \nokay i'm not a hateful person not a racist either  \nhow do you know whether someone is is you know \nwhen someone mocks you how do you know whether  \nthat person is hateful or not hateful you \ndon't but this is the way the left paints  \ncomedy anymore you can't make fun of the homos \nyou can't make fun of the [ __ ] you know that i  \nmean i mean look at youtube they've got a library \nof things you can't talk about what why not okay  \ni hear what you're saying so what i'm also \nhearing that you know that they're they're kind of  \nanti-science in a sense um and that that they're \nalso they can't become a woman this is impossible  \ni don't care if they cut their dick off don't \ncut that i don't care they cannot become a  \nwoman when they can change dna maybe you got an \nargument but these people cannot become women  \nand it's just impossible so jimmy let me let me \nkind of ask you so you were kind of saying when  \nsomeone mocks someone else you know you can't tell \nwhether there's hatred or not hatred right like if  \ni mock you if i make fun of you you know but look \nif you're if you're known as a person to do that  \nif you're known as a per like i used to do \nstand-up comedy people that know me know  \nyou know i mean it's not my fault that you're \na snowflake and you can't handle a joke  \nyeah i mean that's not if you want to get offended \nand go ahead and get offended i'm going to laugh  \neven harder okay so so now what i'm kind of \nhearing you say is that if they know you're  \na comedian then it's okay to make you know no it's \nalways okay to make fun of people why not humor is  \na spiritual principle it actually brings people \ntogether but the left is trying to destroy it  \nokay um so jimmy is it okay if i ask you a little \nbit about it seems like you have a lot of really  \nstrong beliefs about what's going on is that \nfair to say yeah so is it i'm so curious can  \nyou help me understand like how you came to these \nopinions and how you came to believe these things  \nbecause i believe my ears and my eyes when i see \na man in the dress i almost fall the [ __ ] down  \ni'm skipping down the street when i see this [ __ \n] like oh my god did you just see what okay i have  \na certain amount of sympathy for these people \nbut the solution isn't to follow their delusion  \nit's not dress up play barbie i don't give \na [ __ ] but when you're trying it's coming  \ndown the plank where they're gonna i'm \ngonna be forced to address these people\nwhatever they [ __ ] want like what i'm i'm \ngonna point something out to you so there have  \nbeen like three or four questions and i'm \ncurious you know what you think about that  \nthat i've asked you about you and your answer \nseems to be doesn't involve you so i'll ask you  \nlike how did you come to believe these things \nand you kind of started out with like saying  \ni believe i told you i believe my eyes and my ears \nyeah this is how my brain works everything's funny  \nokay everything's funny like i think \nin cartoons sometimes i don't know why  \nso jimmy can you help me understand \na little bit about where you grow  \ngrew up can i ask you some questions about \nyour past yeah yeah i grew up in philly  \nokay what was growing up like for you what \nwas what what was growing up i was very happy  \ni used to be so happy i used to skip down \nthe streets and of course the kids in philly  \nbroke my balls until i stopped doing it \nyou know you know the kids on the corner  \ni would skip i was literally that happy and i have \na lot of energy too so kids would make fun of me  \nbut you know i mean that's philly for you you know \nyou can't do a goddamn thing without getting your  \nballs busted on the corner you know it's like \nthat's what happens in philly i don't know dr k  \ni don't want to interrupt at such a key moment but \ni do want to just say because i i'm not sure how  \nfamiliar your audience maybe is either with me or \nwith jimmy but this is not staged and i think it's  \nimportant that we just mention that none of this \nis staged first for your i'm being serious here  \nthis is not an act of any kind we're just having \na real conversation here yeah i i didn't think it  \nwas changed no no no i know you don't think \ni know i know you know it wasn't stage but  \njust for people some people in your audience \nthink this has to be staged this is not staged  \nthis is not okay sure so so jimmy let me ask \nyou so apparently i'm stuck in the snowflakes\nyeah\num so jimmy so it sounds like when you \nwere growing up you used to like skip  \nand and you said people would bust your balls \nfor that what does that mean can you help me  \nunderstand what that means well i mean i was so \nhappy that i literally skipped down the street  \nas a child and the kids would make fun of me it \nwasn't that big of a deal i just stopped skipping  \ndown the street i was still happier than the [ __ \n] but you know i stopped skipping down the street  \nthat's all yeah and i have kind of a \nweird question like so do you think that  \ni mean how did you feel before you know \nwhen you were skipping down the street  \nand people would start making fun of you \ndo you remember how you felt as a kid  \ni didn't like it but that's that's what happens \nwhen you grow up in philadelphia everybody knows  \nwhat you're doing they see you you hang on the \ncorner you know you got the girls you got the guys  \nyou know sure so break your blows people \nbreak your butt you know i'm hearing that  \npeople would make fun of you and and that \nyou sort of didn't like it but that's life  \npretty much yeah and i'm kind of curious like \nyou know this is going to sound kind of weird but  \ndo you think as a kid you would have \npreferred it if they didn't make fun of you  \nno because it taught me how to uh come back \nwith snappy witty responses to uh insults and  \n[ __ ] i see so it's you gotta be on your guard \nin philly you know you're hanging on the corner  \nyou know you got to be able to hold your own \nyou know sure so i'm hearing that it was kind  \nof like you kind of grew up right so the school \nof hard knocks like it's sort of big streets  \ni wasn't in some really bad neighborhood \ni grew up in roxbury it's almost like the  \nsuburbs but i hung all over philadelphia i \nhung in some tough neighborhoods i was in a  \nboys home when i was a child and uh i would hang \nout with the kids in their neighborhoods because  \nit didn't sound west philly well i've been all \nover philadelphia i used to call me the rabbit  \nwhat does that mean you were in a boy's \nhome yeah my mom put me in a it's called  \nsaint francis vocational school and that \nyou didn't have to be adjudicated but  \ni was doing a lot of stupid [ \n__ ] i had gotten into drugs  \ni had committed some crimes my mother didn't know \nwhat to do with me she put me in this boy's home  \nshe thought she was helping me believe me i \nhad a [ __ ] ball there i didn't want to leave  \nbut you know you were allowed out in the community \nyou weren't you know i had friends i had you know  \nwe went went to concerts like 50 of us like i \nwent to school in the area i mean i pretty much  \nah doc i have fun i i literally have fun \neverywhere i go like i have fun in jail so  \nyou know i mean like i always my number one goal \nis to have fun okay so can i ask you uh jimmy  \nso how old were you when you got put into the \nvocational school 13. and do you remember how you  \nfelt when your mom kind of put you in there well \ni i i felt abandoned was very angry with my mother  \num i remember her crying kissing me and my dad \ngoing something like fly right or some [ __ ] you  \nknow and and but uh that wore off very quickly \nbut like the con artist i was at that age i kept  \ntrying to let my mother think kind \nof let her letting her feel guilty  \nbut within days like i was having a very \ngood time there these were all kids my age  \nlike they put you on different divisions and \nuh there were some really cool characters you  \nknow what i mean like i liked a lot of these guys \nthey had a pool table they had a ping pong table  \nyou know i mean i had fun there i you know i did \ni got sent to another place called saint gabes  \nthat was a [ __ ] had the christian brothers ran \nthat you had to stay in line for a punishment  \nstand in line means you stand and face the wall \nfor hours and of course i was always online  \nso so what what why did you get sent to \nsaint gabes um the court sent me there i um  \nand with the insistence of my mother my \nmother thought that these places would help me  \nshe didn't know what to do with me what was \nwrong what did you need help for well i was doing  \ndrugs i was committing crimes she thought \ni was going to die early so she told me  \nshe used to come to court and the judges were \ngoing to let me go and she would i want him  \nplaced in and they would listen to her and i \nwould get real pissed off for her now this was  \nas a child as an older man now i understand what \nmy mother was doing you understand i agree with  \nher you know she just she just placed faith in \nagencies that i don't know probably made me worse  \nbut you know as a child i [ __ ] hated her \nso i'm i'm kind of what you're saying on the  \none hand makes a lot of sense so can i just \nkind of repeat back what i've heard so far  \nso you kind of grew up in philly right like not \nlike super bad situations sort of suburbs but you  \nkind of hung out with some kids went to some parts \nof town where you got kind of got made fun of  \nit sounds like you were sort of like a \nhappy-go-lucky kid and yeah i've been described  \nas exactly that yeah and and and you know the kids \non the street like they you know they kind of got  \nyou to stop being so carefree pretty quickly no i \njust stopped skipping and started being a comedian  \ni just started being a comedian you know they \nwere calling me gay and this and that you know  \ni mean it's just it just teaches you to toughen \nup that's all i mean you know you're living in  \nphilly you're on the corner you can't be a [ \n__ ] sure you can't be skipping down the street  \nlet's put it that way and then somehow you kind of \nstarted getting into trouble with like drugs and  \nand some criminal activity and stuff yeah and \nthen your mom kind of shipped you off to one place  \nand then she kind of shipped you off \nlike and it sounded like you kind of  \ndid what you were supposed to do right so and \nthen well see here's the first thing they did  \nthey took me to the valley forge military academy \nright they were gonna put me in there right  \nand there was no [ __ ] way i was going to be a \n10 soldier right so this the the guy that runs a  \njoint he said i'm going to talk to him privately \nand he pulls me in a room and he says listen  \nif you don't want to come here we're not going \nto make you come here he's like i don't care  \nwhat your parents say he said do you want to \ncome here i said absolutely not he said okay  \nhe had a little consultation with my mom and \ndad we walked away how did you feel about that  \ngreat what what yeah i mean so i'm gonna ask \nyou kind of a weird question do you have a  \nsense of why you felt great there because \ni didn't want to be a little cadet you mean\nmarch around wake up at five o'clock [ \n__ ] that i was 13 what the [ __ ] i see  \nand then how did it feel when when you know the \njudge was ready to let you come home and your  \nmom was like uh oh we gotta st gabes when i was \na child that really pissed me the [ __ ] off what  \ndo you think about that i'm watching i'm watching \nbecause she wouldn't take me back in other words i  \ngot angry with her and i would be in the cell with \nthese kids from kensington where kenston's like  \na real bad sex in philadelphia it's you know it's \nwhere the men are men and so are the women i mean  \nit's it's crazy that it's gotten even crazier but \nthese kids would do all kind of [ __ ] like way  \nworse [ __ ] than me and their mothers and fathers \nwould pick them up mine wouldn't you know and it i  \nmean as as young as that that that was my thinking \ni i couldn't stand her i [ __ ] hated her and my  \nfather behind her back would say you know if it \nwas up to me this wouldn't happen you know so he  \npissed me off too because i thought he was a [ __ \n] snowflake you know when i got older i realized  \nmy mother was trying to help me that's all i \nwas an [ __ ] i was a kid i mean i was immature\ncan i think for a second jimmy \nwhat's that can i think for a second  \nyou don't need my permission to think\nso you know jimmy what i'm \nkind of hearing is that you  \nhave every reason to be a snowflake but \nyou'll be damned if you're a snowflake\nyou get more respect if you're not a snowflake see \nbut the way the left paints people now soyboy is  \nthe way to go the real me yeah yeah so i i think \nthat's exactly what i'm saying so i'm what i'm  \nsaying is that like you know the story that you're \nsharing makes you if you look at like if the check  \nboxes of being a snowflake like getting abandoned \nby your mom getting sent to a military academy  \ngetting sent to a vocational school getting sent \nto a nut like you're be you know doing what you're  \ngraduating from there or whatever and then you \nknow your mom is like like the judge is about  \nto send you home your mom's like i can't handle it \ngetting sent back to another place having your dad  \nhuh i hated her for that yeah and so \nlike if we think about like you know  \nwhen you use the word snowflake what i sort of \nthink of is like a victim complex right is that  \nfair yeah and so when i'm thinking it like when i \nhear this story bro like it sounds like you know  \nif any wasn't one is entitled to call themselves \na victim it's you but you're not gonna do that  \nwell what no i don't i'm not a victim \nof of of anything i'm i'm i'm just  \na person that's shaped by their experiences i you \nknow i don't see myself as any kind of victim no  \ni i get i get that you don't see yourself \nas like that's sort of what i'm saying but  \nif you like if you think about it right \nso if you had like you know let's say a  \nliberal snowflake who had your background do you \nthink they would think of themselves as a victim  \ni i i don't know interesting okay i couldn't \nyou know i can only speak for myself i mean  \nyou know i don't know is it i mean i was a i was \na liberal till my brother put me hip to what the  \ncorporate media does it all started with trayvon \nmartin like what a bunch of [ __ ] that was  \nand then michael brown what a bunch of [ __ ] \nthat was and you got to hear about racism like  \nlike nothing has went forward between the races \nlike like it it's it's systemic racism which  \nmeans everything's racist right sick and tired of \nhearing this [ __ ] and my brother proved to me  \ni mean nbc doctored the 9-1-1 call that zimmerman \nmade that's clear they admitted it they fired two  \nunderlings but guess what this is how the news \nworks and david knows this once you get someone  \nto make an emotional judgment a nuclear bomb \nof truth isn't going to make that person change  \ntheir opinion very few people will well because \nthey don't want to admit they were duped and  \nthis is how the news works and this is how they \nbrainwash people you know it's just it's sickening\nthat's kind of interesting so let me \njust make sure i heard you correctly  \nso once someone makes an emotional judgment no \namount of truth is going to change their mind  \nfor the most part the media that's what the media \ndoes sure so heard some hyperbolic [ __ ] report  \nan absolute lie and then the truth comes \nout a few days later and people already  \nmade a judgment on it for the most part human \nbeings are not going to go back on the initial  \nemotion emotional judgment that they made that's \njust you being human yeah so people radioplasia  \ndo you think people who make emotional judgments \nare aware that they make emotional judgments\nsure why wouldn't they be interesting you see \nsomebody emotionally you know they they know that\ninteresting so so you because i would actually \nsay like the opposite like i would say that you  \nknow once what what emotions tend to do is cloud \nyour judgment and most people who make emotional  \ndecisions believe they're behaving rationally \nand that the more emotional you become the more  \nrational you think you are what do you think \nabout that maybe not in all circumstances i mean  \ni don't know how to you know\ni don't know okay it's just the way i am it's \nsure i don't like being lied to i don't like  \nbeing gaslighted and they're doing it constantly \nthe media politicians you're being lied to all the  \ntime everything's a grift everything is a grift \neverything jimmy a couple things so so the second  \nthing is uh you know so i'm sort of hearing like \ndo you think it's possible for you to be a victim\nthat's wow that's\ni guess anybody can be a victim yeah why not what \nwhat would that mean to you if you were a victim\nuh i wouldn't know because i don't behave like a \nvictim if somebody wrongs me i get back at them  \nyou know i mean i i find a way to get back to \nthem and i generally make it funny and spectacular  \nokay and this is what i do and what \nwhat would it what would it feel  \nlike to not get back at them horrible \nin what way help me understand that\nit's just like an unpaid debt you know the \nbest way i could describe it like i got  \nto get back at you i mean i'm not saying be \nviolent but justice you're disrespecting me  \ni gotta top it yeah so what do you think \nabout stuff like forgiveness and compassion  \nuh well you know i was in a.a for a while and \nand they taught me about forgiveness right  \nbut then i started um investigating different \nreligions and i heard this rabbi on the tv say  \nhe said we believe in forgiveness too \nbut not like the christians and he said  \nwe believe you got to atone for something before \nwe forgive you that i agree with the christians  \nwant you to just forgive a [ __ ] for just to \nforgive them no forgiveness should not come easy  \nnow if you did somebody wrong and you're \nlooking to make amends you gotta atone for that  \n[ __ ] before i forgive you i think that's more \nreasonable now i'm an atheist but you know i do  \nsome of the religions basically it's a philosophy \nright religion some of them come up with some  \npretty good [ __ ] i mean i see no problem with \ntreat others as you should treat yourself you know  \nwhat i mean i i think that's a good thing you \nknow i just don't believe there's a god i mean  \nit's just ridiculous but yeah they do come up with \nsome good [ __ ] for human relations so you know  \nand i'm gonna ask you kind of personal question \nyou're okay totally fine to not answer it if you  \ndon't want to i'll answer anything have \nyou oh you haven't heard my question yet  \nbut um have you forgiven your mom oh yeah yeah \nhelp me understand how you did that well i just  \ngrew up and realized that look my mother \nwas manic depressive she had her own issues  \nshe was in psychiatric hospital twice six \nmonths right the woman was a little [ __ ] up  \nyou know and and she wanted to help me \nthere's no doubt about it i remember  \nmy aunt from scotland said she my aunt i \nsaid something derogatory about my mother  \nand she sat me down she said jimmy do you realize \nyou're the golden boy i said what do you mean she  \nsaid well there's a problem with your eyes she \nwished you right off to the doctor every time  \nyou were sick she brought you the heart she \nsaid that woman wasn't trying to hurt you she  \nhad her own problems and she went with what she \nthought would help you and apparently it didn't  \nyeah yeah i i think i wish they would have \nput a [ __ ] guitar in my hand or something  \ni mean i was a very happy-go-lucky energetic \nchild but you know they tried to make me into  \nbeing hyperactive they got me taking ritalin they \nhad me in the crazy kids school you know all this  \n[ __ ] stupid [ __ ] you know they should \nhave just gave me something to keep me busy  \nlike if computers were around then you know i \nthink i would have got into that if streaming  \nwas around then i think you would have become \na stranger in the early 70s i don't think so  \nyeah so jimmy that's so interesting so i'm i'm \nkind of hearing so what i'm hearing is that your  \nmom really doesn't have anything to atone for \nno she was look she did her best she told me  \nshe said jimmy there's no book on how to raise \nchildren i make mistakes you know so you know my  \nmother loved me she was a little nuts i mean she's \nsmack depressing i mean you know i mean you know  \nbut i i've no the rest of my family don't forgive \nher they're they're kind of and they're kind of um\nsurprised that i take the tact that \ni take my sister said to me one time  \nshe put you in a cage like my sister was \nthreatening to put her in a home right  \nmy mother was definitely afraid of this and i got \nreal pissed off my sister i said look she calls me  \ncrying one more time i'm gonna [ __ ] you up you \nknow what i mean like i'm tired of this [ __ ] she  \nwanted to die in her own home the woman had the \nright to do that there was nothing wrong with her  \nshe fell one time big [ __ ] deal my sister was \nlike literally terrifying her and i stuck up for  \nher my sister was shocked she said well she put \nyou in the cage i'm like she put me in the cage  \nfor a [ __ ] reason she's trying to [ __ ] help me \nyou ain't trying to help this woman i mean i don't  \nlike that [ __ ] and she stopped hmm you know [ __ \n] that [ __ ] you ain't gonna [ __ ] with my mom  \nmother wasn't perfect she tried to do the best \nshe could with me guess what you know what she  \ntold me until you're 18 i'm gonna keep \nyour little ass alive and you're gonna go  \nwhere the [ __ ] i want you to go and when \nyou're 18 if you die it's on you hey it worked  \ni'm 58 right right so mom wasn't that crazy you \nunderstand yeah so what i'm hearing from you um  \njimmy is that despite you know being very upset \nwith your mom when you were growing up what i'm  \nreally hearing is that you kind of really respect \nher you understand her you sort of understand that  \nshe kind of did the best that she could given \nthe circumstances she had her own struggles and  \nyou kind of don't blame her for that sure that \nthat's what a mature person does it does i mean  \nthat's that's the only way to look at it what am \ni going to still be angry at this woman she's dead  \nthe woman's dead some people \ncontinue to say angry right yeah\nyeah there's no point in it \nthere's no no percentage of it so  \num jimmy i'm kind of curious you said \nyou kind of got into drugs and and kind  \nof criminal activity and stuff as a kid like \nwhat's your understanding of how that happened  \nwell i mean i started committing crimes to get \nmoney for drugs okay but and i don't want to  \nblame it on drugs i mean i did it i owned it \nbut had it not been for drugs i wouldn't have  \ncommitted to crimes so i certainly committed to \ncrimes how do you understand you know drug like is  \nlike so like some people think of uh you know \nsubstance use is an addiction is a disease is an  \nillness uh what do you think about it the whole \ndisease thing was a bunch of [ __ ] with the  \ninsurance companies and i'm very well reversed on \nall that [ __ ] on a.a the history of it and all  \num that's just a word that's all it is it's [ \n__ ] whether or not it's a disease who cares  \nyou know like i went to a free a helped me \ntremendously i went through the 12 steps  \nin two weeks you know people said oh that's \ncrazy well if you study the history of aaa  \nhe did it in days and that's a fact but it did \nshake like like i had a therapist explain me  \ntherapy's supposed to kind of shake you up and \nthen you settled down differently right that  \nwas the best description i've ever heard that's \nsomething that's really exciting it got me to  \nit got me to take a look at things especially \nmy mother and i remember when i went to make  \namends to my mother i went to her grave \nand i cried like a baby and i never  \nlooked ill of my mother ever again and i was 38 \nyears old so i was hating on my mother when i  \nwas 38 years old and i was a damn fool but you \nknow i did a fourth step i did a fifth step i'm  \nrunning around making amends you know what i \nmean got my car and just started making amends  \nthe man just to fix or repair something to \nthe best of your ability and that's what i did  \nbecause of these actions see a lot of these \npeople they're just told to go to meetings  \nand listen to other people's sob stories i'm \nsorry it doesn't work it doesn't work you can't  \nthink your way out of bad thinking you have \nto act your way into better thinking and the  \nactions that i took to the 12 steps helped me even \ntoday to be more honest to not be deceitful to  \nnot that not that i wasn't an honest person but \nyou know but you know to get a real [ __ ] view  \nof what's really going on rather than that dumb [ \n__ ] that was running around in my head hating on  \nmy mother hating the world thinking the world of \nme a living it doesn't life ain't fair it's not  \nit's how you react to it and it really helped \nme i mean and then i started to become a  \nsponsor which was the best thing ever because \nwhen you're helping somebody else you ain't  \nthinking about yourself right that was my whole \nproblem i thought about my [ __ ] self too much  \ni was self-centered selfish and helping \nother people really i really enjoy doing that\num jimmy i'm just going to kind of give david a \nchance to kind of uh chime in for a second and you  \nknow just because i noticed he's been listening \nthoughtfully and maybe taking notes dave did you  \nwant to add anything or ask any questions or kind \nof share any thoughts no i mean i think you know  \none of the interesting things from a complete \nlay person's perspective is that it's i didn't  \nknow the background of jimmy until today but it's \nexactly what i imagined it might be that gets him  \nto where he is today at 58 in the sense of i do \nsee jimmy as a victim myself and it's not about  \nwhether he has to quote behave like one but i i \ni you know in hearing about the situation that he  \ngrew up in it makes a lot of sense to me that \nhe kind of behaves in the boisterous way and  \nfinds this need to always uh have this opposite \nreaction to what he's experiencing and he doesn't  \nfeel right unless he does that that it's like \nan unpaid debt i mean it's other viewers of mine  \nhave told me similar stories about how they got to \nwhere they are in their 30s 40s 50s and so it just  \nit it makes a lot of sense everything i'm hearing \nis putting a lot of pieces into into place so\ni know you've got you want to respond to that i \nsaid okay if i follow up with david a little bit  \nyeah and okay so david when you said this is you \nknow the picture that we're kind of uncovering is  \nexactly in a sense what you're not surprised to \nhear help me understand like what do you mean  \nby that why aren't you surprised to hear this \nhow do these dots how do the dots of what we've  \nlearned in the past about jimmy connect with your \nunderstanding of him today well i mean i think it  \nwas very interesting that i've experienced jimmy's \num homophobic and transphobic language right i'll  \ngive him the benefit of the doubt he says he \nhe's just making fun but he doesn't hate people  \nthat's fine so i'll use the term i won't say \ntransphobia and homophobia his transphobic and  \nhomophobic language and for ex i've experienced \nit with jimmy as an adult and he revealed today  \nthat he was the recipient of that when he was \nskipping along and being called gay that makes  \nthat that that makes a lot of \nsense to me in the sense that  \nhe's weaponizing the way he felt when that was \nused against him against other people that maybe  \nhe wants to go after or get back at like that's \na that's one example of why it's fitting together\num what do you think about that jimmy\ni don't know i mean david i certainly am no \nvictim you know good and bad things happen to  \npeople all the time and and in fact like what is \ngood and bad what's bad what the chinese see um  \nwhat is that um um conflict as um like opportunity \nyou know i mean if something bad happens you can  \ngo one or two routes right you can become a victim \nget angry get depressed stay that way for years  \nor you can turn that [ __ ] around make \nlemons out of lemonade lemons right  \nand how do you how do you think so if someone is \nkind of a victim and someone is sad and depressed  \nhow do you think you kind of speaking about what \nyou were sort of mentioning about aaa and becoming  \na sponsor and helping other people how do you help \nsomeone like that turn their lemons into lemonade  \nwell the whole thing with that is it's i guess \nit's a form of selfishness i mean if you keep  \nthinking about you and your [ __ ] up situation \nyou're not thinking about a solution you're  \nstuck in the problem so you got to get out of \nyourself somehow and but me yeah so you've been  \na sponsor right so you've helped people who are in \na dark space and how did you help him out of that  \njust helped them with the uh the big book \nof alcoholics anonymous i helped them  \ntake them through the 12 steps and and they got \nto define it the way they did and you know like  \nthey got to experience it the way \nthey did the more they practiced it  \nmore they experienced and they got to \narticulate it any way they wanted to i  \ndidn't tell them to say i didn't tell most of \nthese guys would tell you when i got sponsors  \nright and believe me these are these were \nall well-meaning people but they would say  \ncall me every day right so i called them they \ncould they'd last about 10 minutes because i was  \ni was pissed off i was disgusted one thing that \ncomforted me drugs or alcohol wasn't available  \nanymore and they'd lasted about 10 minutes right \nand they would say go tell that at a meeting  \nyou'll feel better i never did i never felt better \ntalking about my problems all the [ __ ] time  \nand believe me i talked about my problems i never \nno i'm asking i'm asking you guys other people  \nwhat's that so i'm hearing that you seem to \nbe talking about when someone else is your  \nsponsor it sounded like you were a sponsor yeah \nyeah yeah yeah how did you help other people  \noh what i did was i helped help them to open their \nown eyes how did you describe me i was helped  \nthrough the 12 steps do a fourth and fifth step \nwith them shared the way i made amends discuss  \nthat with them and then they had to go out \nand do the work like i was just like guide  \nokay i was no special person or anything i you \nknow i it's not like i had superhuman powers  \nsure but i had a problem that i got over and \nyou're the same way ain't you and you have a  \nproblem with gaming and you got over it now you \nhelp gamers well then you understand this uh  \nabsolutely oh sure i mean i understand my \nexperience of it so my experience of it and i  \nwas kind of curious because you know i'm sure it's \nsimilar i i think it is too so let me let me kind  \nof share with you kind of my experience and you \nlet me know so you know i found that when i was  \nplaying video games like i was really struggling \nand and you know some people um would kind of you  \nknow not really understand that i was struggling \nthey would sort of blame me they thought it was  \nweakness things like that some people made fun of \nme um you know i got bullied a lot when i was kind  \nof growing up for playing video games and things \nlike that and the people that helped me sort of  \ni think did sort of what you did which is that you \nknow they didn't make fun of me or or things like  \nthat they sort of helped me see things in a new \nlight they helped me sort of recognize that that  \nyou know while i may be a victim in some ways \nthat if i'm a victim if it's really my fault  \nlike you know they also empowered me in some ways \nby sort of helping me understand that like there  \nis some element of this that i control well you \nknow doc you know sometimes bullies can be good  \nyou know they can help you to face reality a \nwhole lot quicker yeah so um if it's okay with  \nyou jimmy what i'm gonna actually do is like \nshare some thoughts and and i'm i'm kind of  \ncurious what about this will kind of land well \nwith you and and what won't um you know and  \nand just i'm super curious because i think getting \nto talk to you by the way first of all bro this  \nhas been an absolute privilege i i really \nappreciate it thank you i'm having fun great\num do you have a doctor by the way you have \na doctor that you see huh got a shrink okay  \nokay cause i'm just you know noticing that \nyou're you're smoking cigarettes and vaping and  \nand stuff like that so i just want to make sure \nthat you know your health is okay and that you  \ntalk to a medical professional about all that \nstuff i'm i'm fine i'm trying to vape more  \nokay okay um but it sounds like you you were \nyou joking when you said you have a shrink or  \nno i said i don't have a shrink oh you don't \nhave it you have you have a fit physical health  \ndoctor yes okay yes yes and they're aware that \nyou're smoking and vaping and stuff like that  \nokay and promote the vaping actually okay okay um \nso a hard reduction now yeah yeah it's good so the  \nfirst thing that i kind of want to point out is is \nuh you know so like i think jimmy what i'm really  \nhearing from you is like you know you grew up and \nyou learned a couple of really important lessons  \nso you were kind of like young and carefree \nand and stuff like that right and then like  \nyou kind of learned that when people behave \nin a manner that is maybe a little bit unusual  \nis maybe a little bit funny that like the way that \nyou respond to that like the way that you were  \ntreated because that's how we learn right like we \ntreat other people the way that we were treated  \nright so that's how human beings learn \ninteraction so you know i grew up in texas  \nwhere a firm handshake is a great way to greet \nsomeone and so that's sort of what i thought was  \nnormal and what i'm sort of hearing from you \nis that you know when when someone's a little  \nbit different the way that you treat them is you \njust kind of make fun of them right because that's  \njust that's just what we do like that's the way \nthat that's what happened to you that's the way  \nyou kind of respond that's sort of the system of \nthings not not not always i don't always make fun  \nof them i generally what can i say my personal \nlife everyone knows me no one takes some of  \nthe things i say seriously but when there's a \ntime to be serious they know it you know i mean  \ncan i ask you to come up and respectfully you \nknow can i ask you a little bit about your  \npersonal life for the band so like who's in your \nlife right now who are the you know what are the  \nrelationships that matter to you well i live i \nlive in a very nice rooming house in a very nice  \narea i run the place um i'm i'm the kitchen nazi \ni can find you fifty dollars if you don't clean  \nup now i've yet to do it but this landlord here \nshe likes renting all these kids and you know  \n[ __ ] vegetarians you know they're going to save \nthe world of animals but they won't clean up the  \nkitchen it's amazing you know i point to the floor \nso so you're having uh artichokes onions and looks  \nlike there's a tomato there too yeah these kids \nit took me two years to whip this place into shape  \nnow we got a professional cleaner yeah so yeah so \nit sounds like like you're you're kind of like uh  \nit sounds like there are kids like in the sense \nof young kids young folks here and so it sounds  \nlike you're kind of you're kind of imposing \nsome discipline in order it's this is the uh  \nthis is the international house of pancakes \nwe got west africans we got koreans we got  \njamaicans we got black people we got i mean we \ngot we got everybody here so so i'm hearing that  \nyou know that some of the relationships \nin your life are kind of the people that  \nare in the rooming house what about like um \nyou know significant others partners family  \nno i don't i don't have a significant other my my \ni haven't had a steady girlfriend since my ex and  \ni threw the baby on the floor so you know she \nbetrayed me and uh you know i really don't give  \na [ __ ] about a relationship okay when you say \nyou don't give a [ __ ] do you ever feel lonely  \ncuriously enough now that is kind of curious \nright how do you understand i think i would  \nno listen i walk down the street i have fun \ni talk to everybody i pet every dog i see i  \ni don't know what to do i have fun i have i'm a \nrelatively happy person mm-hmm yeah i see that but  \nhow do you how do you think that happened \nbecause you know i'm thinking 58 year old  \nyou know well i'll say this for you lsd has \nhelped me tremendously how so this made me happier  \ninteresting okay and and so when was \nthe last time you were in a relationship  \n20 years ago okay let me ask you kind of \nweird question you don't have to answer  \nif you don't feel comfortable but have \nyou ever wondered if you might be gay\nno and i know it sounds kind of weird but why not\nuh because i don't think a \nman's hairy ass is appealing  \nthat's basically as right of \nan answer as you can give okay\nand so it does sound like you're sexual i got no \nproblem i got no problem with homosexuals i don't  \nyeah in fact i've had a few homosexual friends \nthat were some funny [ __ ] yeah so i'm just  \nhearing that you're sexually attracted to women \nand you're pretty sure about that yeah yeah okay  \nwas it okay that i asked you those questions yeah \nyou know i hit the sucky [ __ ] every now and then  \nyou know what i hit the sucky [ __ ] every now \nand then i massage place and he's a massage place  \nokay uh anyway so if you must know what i \ndo for sex because that would be the next  \nlogical question and i was just yeah i mean \ni i suppose it would be the next logical  \nquestion jimmy i gotta say man you are you \nare a blast to talk to bro that's cool yeah\nyeah so i i just wanna you know so here here's \nthe thing if it's okay with you i'm gonna sort of  \nshare some thoughts and a couple of observations \nyou know i i met you now what like about an hour  \nago right and and so you got to take all this \nwith a healthy grain of salt you you know  \num but so i'm going to kind of just start out with \nlike it it seems like you kind of grew up and you  \nwere taught a particular you know here's the rules \nof the game of life right if you're a little bit  \ndifferent you get made fun of you know and that \nlike making fun of people is is sort of what  \nwhat happens and there's no like there's no victim \ncomplex here you know you kind of you it's like  \nit's like tit for tat like if someone makes fun \nof you you make fun of them and it's like that's  \njust the way of the world no i gotta top them and \nyou gotta top em why is that i don't know it makes  \nme feel better okay yeah so i'll share a couple \nof thoughts with you about that in a second but  \nso i and and then i think that you know honestly \nlike what what you're so i'm a psychiatrist and i  \nsee a lot of people you know who have ptsd and \ngone through traumatic experiences and stuff  \nlike that and i'm i'm actually i know this may \nsound kind of weird but i do think that there's  \num you know people some people really \ngo too far on the victimhood complex  \nand and as a psychiatrist sometimes what i find \nis that you know if you play if you kind of think  \nof yourself as 100 of a victim that also means \nthat you have no control or agency over life  \nand that you can be a victim and at the same time \nthere are parts of your life that you can control  \nyou know so i think that there were some well let \nme say this to you the biggest thing that i felt  \nlike a victim when my ex used the police in the \ncourts to lie and say i threw the baby on the  \nfloor they were all against me the accusations \nwhat's meant what what was what what mattered  \nnot the fact whether or not it happened they did \nno investigation they didn't ask if the child  \nwas taken to the hospital they just charged me \nmade me spend thousands of dollars for a lawyer  \nto this day that pisses me off \nthat's the way the system is  \nso i had detectives tell me you're guilty till \nyou're proven innocent if it's with a girlfriend  \nor a wife if they say you did something boom \nyou're locked up no investigation yeah i don't  \nbelieve that's extremely unfair it's very unfair \nhow did it feel to be a victim in that situation\nnot good i went down there and screamed at the \npsychiatrist and the security guards came in  \nand he put his hand up and he talked to me and \nuh here's what he my lawyer got the notes from  \nthe psychiatrist so the psychiatrist said that i \nwas very affable right but that i needed some my  \nmental health support right yeah no [ __ ] my ex \njust said i threw the [ __ ] baby on the floor  \nand i didn't you know what i mean but then he \ndoes the report on her and he says the distance  \nthat miss beef claimed that he threw the child on \nthe floor became lower and lower as the interview  \nwent on in other words he called her a liar \nbecause she is a [ __ ] liar she got away with it  \nshe got away with it because she said she said \nthat's ridiculous it pisses me off to this day  \nand i don't feel like a victim anymore but i'm \nstill pissed off it i'm still gonna talk about it  \nyou know [ __ ] ridiculous now the kids in \nharvard so and guess what that kid read books  \nbecause she saw me reading books i always read \nher my prior series in their entire [ __ ] life  \nokay you know are you kid calls me when it's 10. \nlisten to this she calls me when she's 10 years  \nold she says daddy mommy told me to get in the \ntub but i was already in the tub i'm like what  \nshe said mommy told me to get in the \ntub but she was already in the tub  \nshe said uh is mommy drinking she said yeah \ni should put her on the phone i said she's at  \nthe age of reason now if you want her to hate you \nlike i [ __ ] hate you keep [ __ ] drinking and to  \nher credit three weeks and three weeks later she \nwent no rehab i believe she's still sober i'm i'm  \nnot sure but she's been sober a number of years so \nare you assassination the kid won't talk to me the  \nmother poisoned her you know the mother got both \nher titties chopped off right i found on facebook  \nand i sent her a message it couldn't happen \nto a nicer person i'm skipping down the street  \ni'm gonna have a party well apparently saying \nmean things is worse than doing mean things  \nyeah yeah well i said was terrible uh but her \nsaying i threw the baby on the floor costing  \nme thousands of dollars forever ordering the \nrelationship i would have with my daughter it's a  \nlot worse so you deserve that you know what i mean \ni don't give a [ __ ] they can cut her head off  \ni mean i don't care yeah you sound very very angry \nwell what the [ __ ] what would you threw the baby  \non the floor what the [ __ ] it never happened \neven my kid when she was five she's like dad  \nwouldn't i have gotten hurt yeah you think \nthese detectives would ask those questions  \nno but they're forced to charge you that's \nthe way the law works if it's a girlfriend or  \na spouse if they make some allegation like that \nyou're just sent off the court no investigation  \nnone so how would you like to \nbe treated not without evidence\nhow would you like to be treated in that situation\nlike to be treated fairly like there was some \nkind of investigation to go on before i'm charged  \nso it's fun i'm gonna put myself in in the shoes \nof someone else let's say a cop or or you know  \nyour ex-girlfriend or whatever and i'm gonna \nsay for a second that you were treated fairly  \nlike what if they thought they were treating you \nfairly even the cops admit it's unfair i've talked  \nto scores of detectives they say look in that \ninstance you're guilty to approve an innocent  \nit's [ __ ] up it's [ __ ] up no investigation \nlike look if somebody accused me of murder they do  \na [ __ ] investigation right if somebody accused \nme of burglary they do a [ __ ] investigation  \nif somebody accused me of anything they do \nwith investigation but when a woman says  \na man did something to a kid there's no [ __ ] \ninvestigation they just charge you that's wrong  \nshit's wrong cost me thousands of dollars \nto disprove a lot [ __ ] yeah that's wrong  \nbelieve women [ __ ] that not \nwithout evidence [ __ ] that\nyou're supposed to get mad about [ __ ] like \nthat yeah i completely agree i think the worst  \nthing a woman can a man can do is rape a woman \nand i think the worst thing a woman can do  \nis lie and say that you abused your own child \nthat's [ __ ] up a kid made it to harvard  \nlooks like i did something [ __ ] right yeah \nit doesn't sound like you got a whole lot of  \ncredit for it what's that doesn't sound like \nyou got a whole lot of credit for it well yeah  \ni shouldn't get credit look the kid was smart kid \nlike to read you know what i mean and they're all  \nmy whole family's like thinking carol did \nsomething that kid went to harvard despite  \nthat dumb [ __ ] he drank a fifth of jd a \nday for 10 years that kid was born smart  \nand she liked to read and she would ask me daddy \nwhat's your book he said and i would stop because  \nmy father read all the time but he would get \npissed off he stopped him so i would stop put  \nthe book down well julia here's what happened so \nfar i'll let you know when it ends jimmy i'm going  \nto tell him i'm gonna kind of interrupt you for a \nsecond is that okay how does it feel to share this\ngood what feels good about it i don't know i like \ntalking about um but i put it uh about my daughter  \nbecause see i can tell the [ __ ] truth my ex has \nnever told the truth and you know apparently uh  \nyou know she's gotten away with a lot of this \nyeah not a very bright girl but you know so\ni'm gonna try to do this one more time so \nif it's okay with you i'm going to share  \nsome thoughts about you know what i'm seeing so it \nkind of starts off i'm sort of noticing that when  \nyou grew up and you know you behaved somewhat \ndifferently and when people didn't understand  \nwhat you were how you were the way you were like \nyou know you're a kid who skips and the kids on  \nthe corner who like don't understand what that's \nabout so they make fun of you right and then you  \nsort of learned how to like how to survive in that \nsituation you also learned that like hey you know  \nthis is where humor comes in like you know you \nkind of fight fire with fire and like i'm sure  \nthat early on before you learned how to how to \ndefend yourself using humor it probably hurt when  \nthey make fun of you but you sort of learned that \nlike hey if you get hurt laying down and playing  \nthe victim there's no point to that you got to \nkind of you you know you got to fight back and the  \nway that you fight back is you put people in their \nplace you teach them a lesson you kind of make fun  \nof it you laugh with them you laugh at them you \nkind of like you know that's the way the world  \nworks and then i'm sort of hearing that you know \nthat that you had a couple of interesting things  \nhappen to you you kind of got into drugs and stuff \nlike that you got into crime because of the drugs  \ni think you've come to acknowledge that your mom \nwasn't perfect in a lot of ways but she sort of  \nin her own flawed way did the best that she \ncould and you've come to even defend her and and  \nkind of be a champion for her when other people \nwere trying to like you know kind of abuse her  \nor not kind of treat her properly like you weren't \ngonna let her be a victim and you would stand up  \nfor someone else who kind of couldn't stand up for \nthemselves um and that's actually despite you know  \ngetting sent off to like become a tin soldier \nand by the way i think part of the reason that  \nthat you really you know part of the reason \nthat you were telling that story i think i  \nheard some positivity there and i think part of \nthe positivity with that story is that someone  \nactually like paid attention to what you wanted \nand what you cared about and the guy was like  \nstraight with you and said hey if you want to \nbe here i got your back and if you don't want  \nto be here eternally grateful to that commander or \nwhatever the hell he was it's weird right because  \nwe go there yeah and he had your back right so \nlike you know when i was in saint gabes we played  \nvalley forge military academy in football \nand we beat the [ __ ] out of them  \nyeah so what i'm sort of hearing is that you know \nsome some people like your mom it sort of felt  \nlike she didn't have your back right when she's in \nthe court judge is like time to go home and mom's  \nlike uh-uh whereas like it's interesting because \nthere are like some people here who who sort of  \nhave your back right and he's like a stranger but \nit's it was really interesting to kind of hear  \nyour and see your emotional expressions and stuff \nas you were kind of telling that story you kind of  \ngot sent to saint francis you actually you sort of \nliked it but you sort of made your mom pay for it  \nright you weren't going to let her off the phone \nfor feeling that she abandoned your kids yeah  \nand then you went to st gabe's which you really \ndidn't like but it i mean it sounds like in a lot  \nof ways you were sort of a dealt and unlucky hand \nin life but i'm also sort of hearing that you're  \nnot going to play the victim because like that's \nnot who you are no and so this is just that's you  \nknow [ __ ] happens to all kind of people all kind \nof negative things happen to people yeah of course  \nof course and and so i think that like you said \nyou know the one place where you maybe get to play  \nthe victim card or you feel like you were really \ntreated um you know unfairly was probably the  \nsituation with this whole domestic violence kind \nof thing and stuff like that but i'm also kind  \nof hearing that that you know this aaa experience \nhas been really interesting for you because what  \ni'm sort of hearing is that you know acknowledging \nthat people have their own experience of alcohol  \nhelping people understand their experience of \nalcohol um sorry it's just a bit distracting  \nand and sort of help other people sort of like \nlistening to you and sort of being like kind of  \ncompassionate right but also they're not saying \nlike oh it's like it's not your fault alcohol is  \na disease like they're not sort of using that kind \nof victim language but what they're sort of doing  \nis recognizing that hey you may need a little bit \nof support and i think affable and may need some  \nmental health support i think is a great great \nway to describe you by the way to be fair the  \nwhole disease thing let me just stop to be fair in \nthe big book and bill wilson wrote it it did not  \ndeclare the disease that he called it an illness \na melody used other terms the whole disease thing  \nis a [ __ ] joke it really really is i think \nit's i think it's ridiculous and you know like  \nthe problem from for me for many years is i would \ngo to aaa they would tell you to go to a meeting  \nif you got a problem put it down in the meeting \nlike it's group therapy i'm not about you but  \nconstantly talking about my problems doesn't \nmakes you feel worse you should feel worse  \nso i had to like take some actions i knew i had to \ndo something i didn't know what the [ __ ] to do  \nyeah but this man helped me and i was very \nimpressed with the fact that he [ __ ] spent his  \npersonal time with me and he said now you go do it \nyeah no i'm with you no i did i was afraid but i  \ndid it so so i and i i'm i'm with you i mean i i \nthink we'll i'll kind of address that in a second  \ntoo but and so what i'm kind of hearing now is \nthat you know you're you kind of got your opinions  \nand you're going to stick to them and if if people \nwant to be snowflakes they can go screw themselves  \nyou're going to say what you're going \nto want to say and so this is where  \nyou know i i'd actually encourage you to rethink \nthat a little bit and here's the reason why okay  \nso like what i'm hearing is as many situations \nin your life where you were not people didn't  \nlisten to you in other situations where \nthey kind of did like so we can talk about  \nyou know that the the the general or whatever at \nthe tin soldier place we can think a little bit  \nabout your aaa sponsor we can even think about the \npsychiatrist who sort of said you know sort of had  \nyour back and sort of looked at the situation well \nlet me finish you know what doc i even look at  \nit like even the bowie's helped me in some sense \ni'm with you i'm with you i i'll get there right  \nso like th those those moments uh you know where \npeople really like you know cause i'm not hearing  \nthat your aaa sponsor made fun of you and i'm not \nhearing that when you're in a sponsor he actually  \ndid but he was a funny guy he okay he just died \nno i was real he died of hep c he got treated  \ni had had c2 i got treated and cured but he had it \nfor like 30 years and it [ __ ] with his liver so  \nbad that even though he was cured it killed him \nwhich was a real shame it sounds like a shame  \nyeah and and so i'm also hearing loud and clear \nthat you know your experiences have made you the  \nperson that you are which is sort of a survivor \nyou know if i had to use one word to describe you  \nknow you've been through a lot the number one will \nof a human being is to survive is it not yeah and  \nwhat i'm also hearing and i know this may sound \nkind of weird but there have been a lot of times  \nwhere we've sort of talked a little bit about you \nknow maybe how you're feeling or or you know like  \nfor example like that you don't feel lonely and \neven you're a little bit surprised at that and in  \nmy experience actually like psychologically and \nneuroscientifically like sometimes what happens  \nwhen people are survivors is parts of their brain \nactually shut down because like you were kind  \nof saying if you didn't shut those parts of the \nbrain down it'd be like going to an aaa meeting  \ntalking about all the negativity and it just sort \nof like feels worse and worse and worse and so  \nsometimes what the brain actually does is numb \nourselves to negative emotions and the last kind  \nof thing that i'd sort of share with you is that \nyou know you were talking a little bit about how  \nlike you don't like to wallow in the negativity \nwhich i get because you're not a victim and all  \nthat kind of good stuff but there was a little bit \nof time today where you sort of did share hey the  \none place where i think if i you know if anyone \nwanted to call me a victim it was in this place  \nyou got pissed off you started off you can even go \nback and watch this you started off laughing about  \nit and then towards the end you really got angry \nand then i kind of asked you like how does it feel  \nto talk about it you actually said good now i'm \nnot i i think if we had spent an hour and a half  \ntalking about it you would feel worse at the end \nbut what i'm sort of maybe yeah well you're the  \none who said that wallowing in the negativity \nmakes you feel generally speaking worse but  \nso so this is where you know what i i'm kind of \nnoticing is like you're someone who had to kind of  \nadapt you had to survive you had to learn how to \nlaugh you had to learn how to swim yeah you had to  \nyou know tit for tat and at the same time like the \ncost of that survivor that survival like you know  \nhis his comet maybe like you know to a certain \ndegree like kind of toning down your compassion  \ntoning down your empathy toning down even feelings \nof loneliness or negative emotions because you've  \nsaid time and time and time again everything to me \nis funny everything is to me is funny i'm a happy  \nguy right and so what i'm sort of noticing there \nis like that seems really unusual and so there's a  \npart of me that you know based on our conversation \nmakes me wonder whether there's like stuff that's  \nkind of like tucked away swept under the rug that \ni think i just i have a different personality type  \ni have a rare type i've been typed before \ni'm just i have a rare personality type  \nyou know does it make me special or \nnot and i just see things differently  \ni don't know yeah i i get that i mean i i think \nthat you do see things it's better than laughing  \ntry doc isn't it i mean i mean i had i had \na therapist tell me jimmy about my family  \nshe said there's the brady bunch and then there's \neverybody else so you know that helped put it in  \nperspective yeah so here's what i'd say i i'd \nsay that it's it's it's best to laugh and cry\nno no i ain't cried in a while yeah \nright and like even then you kind  \nof said i haven't cried in a while and \nthen you laughed what's funny about that\nyeah so because when you say better to \nlaugh that's kind of interesting because  \nwhat that doesn't mean i'm looking to cry oh \ni think it means you're looking to not cry  \nright so when you say it's better to \nlaugh than to cry and every time you laugh  \nwhat i'm sort of noticing is \nthat you've got a choice there  \nand you're deviating towards laughter instead \nof crying i wouldn't say that i i think um\ni'm just a happy good lucky person and there's \nthere's nothing in my life that would make me  \ncry right now it's true nothing like you know \nlike like like i don't know i mean okay it's  \nnot an option to cry there's nothing to cry about \nthings are this is one like one the best period of  \nmy life i got a little youtube channel you know i \nmean uh i i like that that's going pretty good um  \nyeah quick quit one job for another got two more \nhours now you know i'm doing all right yeah i hear  \nthat man i i i don't disagree with you i'm not \nsaying that you need to sit there and and you  \nknow cry all day oh my god your life is crap and \nand things like that what i'm sort of saying is  \nthat you know i think that you've got maybe one \nor two things that you could feel rightfully sad  \nabout but i sort of also understand that you \nknow playing a victim is not something that  \nyou're gonna do when i think a little bit about \nyour daughter and and her being at harvard and  \ni hear you kind of speak with pride and also that \nshe's been poisoned against you like i think it'd  \nbe okay to shed a tear on that if you felt like \nit nah you know sometimes i get a little sad about  \nit but i've i basically convinced myself that \nlook a kid has reached the pinnacle of schools  \nshe's not going to run for anything if she plays \nher cards right and up to now she's played her  \ncards right so she's not going to need her father \nthat much and if she doesn't want me in her life  \nthen that's her choice there's nothing i can \ndo about it so you used an interesting word  \ni've gotten a few hobbies look \ni started painting that's great\njimmy i just want to point one thing out \nto you and then we we can you know can that  \ndiscussion but okay you said i've convinced \nmyself so when someone uses that word when  \ni think about convincing what i think about \nis starting from a place where you believe  \none thing and working really hard to believe \nsomething else well in a sense yes because look  \nlet's face it that's a sad situation the kid \nain't talking to me yeah right there's nothing  \ni can do about it there's nothing i can do about \nso hopefully the kid grows the [ __ ] up and you  \nknow like apparently it was okay for this woman to \nfalsely accuse me three times twice of abusing her  \nonce i'm abusing yeah so jimmy can i cut you off \nagain is that okay so here's here's what i'd say  \ni'm with you that there's nothing you can do about \nit so a lot of times when there's nothing we can  \ndo about something like why cry about it right \nbecause it's not gonna help anything i'm with  \nyou makes perfect sense right so like why why \nwhat's use of crying over spilled milk right\nso this is the last thing that i'd leave with \nyou and you know you you don't have to agree  \nwith whatever i'm saying it's really just i'm just \nmaking observations and you can you can decide you  \nknow you're the expert on you so the last thing \nthat i'd say is like you know i'd encourage you  \nto try you know if you're a funny dude that's \nfine you find something funny that's fine  \ni'd encourage you to try to be like a \nlittle bit more compassionate towards people  \nwho may be confused or struggling or see \nthemselves as victims i'm not saying that  \nthey are victims i'm not saying that there's an \nobjective right or wrong but what i've heard from  \nyou time and time and time again is that there \nhave been periods in your life where like whether  \nyou were a victim or you weren't a victim you \nknow whether it was really your fault that you  \ngot sent off to these schools or things like that \nwhether they formed you into being the person that  \nyou are and so therefore good experiences i'm \nwith you all all through that even in terms of  \nmy own video game addiction i'm grateful for it \nbecause it turned me into the person that i am  \nand at the same time while i'm going through \nit if someone sort of shares a kind word with  \nme even if my head is in the wrong space i don't \nunderstand exactly what's going on you've kind of  \nsaid that about yourself you know when you were \nkind of like going through this a a stuff and  \nyou started to have realizations that during \nthat dark period before you understand things  \nthat a kind word or even someone sort of like \nyou know taking you seriously and saying hey  \ni don't think that's really what it is \ncan actually have like a positive impact  \nand what i'd encourage you to kind of think about \nis like you know these people that you kind of  \ncall snowflakes and stuff like that you know i \ndon't know if there's an objective right here or  \nan objective wrong you may think that there's an \nobjective right i think that it's possible that  \nyour decisions are also your judgments are also \nemotional and then you know no amount of truth  \nis going to change your mind what i'm saying is \njust like from a human perspective even if you can  \nthink they're ridiculous can you be kind to them \ntoo oh absolutely one one of one of the quotes\nin the book of alcoholics anonymous says those \nwe dislike you practice justice and courtesy  \nso i mean you got to be fair with people and \nyou got to be silly you know you got to try to  \nbe civil with them you know we really should \nfight fire with water you know quite often i  \ngotta fight fire with fire yeah backwards but \nyeah yeah what do you think about that bro  \ni get myself into some situations yeah so you know \njust one last thought and then you know david can  \ntalk or you can talk i'm kind of done with my \nspiel but you know just like you said like it  \nsounds like a lot of times you fight fire with \nfire and the words came out of your mouth like  \nsome maybe you should think about using water from \ntime to time bro oh yeah sometimes weather doesn't  \nmake sense when when you're dealing with somebody \nwho's irrational and unreasonable no well i i  \nlook i'm not saying that fire isn't appealing \nbut i'd i'd even argue that the more rational  \nsomeone is the more water helps rather than \nfire i don't know if they're willing to listen\nyep yeah i think it's tricky but you \nknow i'm i'm hearing that maybe you're  \nrethinking things a little bit but you know you \ncame to use fire for a reason right because the  \nwater wasn't working well and at the same time \nmaybe there's some exploration to have there  \ni think with what i went through in my \nlife i've turned down pretty goddamn good  \nand i'm relatively happy so yeah yeah no problem \nwith my life i i think i think you've done a good  \ni'm about to say something that make you let \nme know if this is like a victim complex kind  \nof thing but i would say given the hand of \ncards that you've been dealt you played a  \nreally good game of poker yeah maybe leave me \ni [ __ ] up along the way yeah learn more from  \nfuck-ups to any kind of success trust me abs \nabsolutely man i hear you failure is overrated\nunderrated can i ask a quick question jimmy you \nknow when you when you and i started kind of uh  \ni don't know about corresponding \nbut when you started calling in  \nthere was a different sort of anger that i feel \nlike in our interactions has dissipated over time  \nwhere you and i have even communicated privately \nby email and i feel like it's a different jimmy  \nthan from maybe a couple years ago is that about \nsomething has changed for you over the last couple  \nyears or is that about your relationship with \nme specifically i would say lsd has helped me  \nthat's i honestly believe this \nmay be happier yeah honestly  \nnow i get in arguments with these people online \nthey say oh it taught me this it taught me that  \nlsd it's a drug it ain't teaching you [ __ ] \nbut it does seem to make me happier it does seem  \nto make me want to take risks now like i i was \nafraid to start the youtube channel that i got  \nand i was unconfident about it i don't know how \nto do this i don't know how to do that [ __ ] it  \ni just did it i don't even know how to do this [ \n__ ] you guys help me right so i see somebody who  \ndoesn't know how to do something i'm willing \nto help them that's how it should work right  \nso you just have to have the will to do something \nyou don't necessarily have to understand it  \nknow how to do it you just move towards it \nright that's what i'm doing words to live by\nwow and jimmy did i'm just curious and \nyou don't if you don't want to answer that  \nthis obviously you don't \nhave to do you own firearms  \ni'm a felon i can't okay okay i wouldn't own one \nanyway i have no problem with people to do but i  \nhave no need for a gun oh is that right yeah i've \nyou know i could defend myself but some people  \nit's their right no they they have a \nright to do it i lost that right by being  \nconvicted so yeah well wow well jimmy \nlisten you you've really said it all i  \nmean i don't know about you dr k but this \nhas been incredibly illuminating to me  \nsame i mean i i i really appreciated you \nknow jimmy's honesty and his perspective and  \nhis cojones for coming on and and kind of maybe \nstepping a touch outside i had fun fellas yeah i  \nhear you man yeah maybe that's my oh sorry \ndr k no no good i was just gonna say like  \njimmy you gotta you gotta talk to your doc \nabout you know all the stuff you're using bro\nokay\nthat was actually\nno but jimmy what i was curious is during this \nhour and a half i think it's been consistent cool  \nwhip cigarettes and vaping the the entire time \nis this all day while you're up or are you maybe  \nlike understandably a little nervous about this \nconversation so you're doing it or is that all day  \nwell listen whippet gods were good to me  \nthey just delivered 600 150 \nminutes before the stream started\nno but what i'm asking jimmy is from the time \nyou wake up till you go to sleep are you cool  \nno no no no no i do hit these whippets a little \nhard i mean you know but not in the morning or not  \nyou know i mean okay and then absolute last thing \njust because aaa was such a prevalent thing are  \nare you sober now from the standpoint of alcohol \nno but i don't drink as much okay i was knocking  \ndown two bottles of that whiskey a week i've had \nthat for 10 days the bottle behind you yeah so  \ni'll drink i'll drink um three strong beers nine \nor ten percent a night of course in five hours  \ni'm not driving i'm doing a stream david i'm kind \nof curious what pushes you to ask questions to to  \nuh fill about his i sorry jimmy about \nhow much substances he's using well my  \ni'm curious in my interactions with \nhim how influenced by substance use  \nthey might be because i'm hearing you know \ni'm getting an email or hearing a voicemail  \nand my instinct is it would help me maybe \nto frame the context a little bit if i know  \nmaybe what his state of mind is \nthat's my kind of curiosity about it\nwell okay\njimmy any questions from your end yeah \nyeah i had a great time thanks fellas  \nall right thank you let's do this \nagain in a year let's do this again  \nsure david you want to

dr k really appreciate  \nit yeah thanks a lot for the opportunity jimmy it \nwas nice to meet you man and nice to meet you take  \ncare thanks for setting this up all right david \nthank you all right we'll talk to everybody soon\nnow that was something else\nchat what on earth okay\nmy favorite quotes you gotta fight fire with fire  \nand beat them at their own game sometimes \nfire doesn't work you gotta use water  \njimmy was fantastic man you know it's so \ninteresting because i i think a lot of times we um\noh maybe i need to go this way oh my god\nso i think a lot of times man i\ni don't even what did y'all think chad\num\nlike people are saying like it was i \nmean he was he was quite the character  \nand and it's really interesting because i you know \ni i think it's like i don't know if y'all kind of  \ncaught this but at the very beginning like it was \nreally hard to get him to talk about himself it's  \nlike any personal question you ask him becomes \nabout propaganda and so like the media and like it  \nbecomes like an externalized issue and then once \nyou start to like actually get him talking like  \nyou know i i think he's someone that really \nviews the world is like you know he's had to  \ni want you all to just think about this for \na second so sometimes when people have very  \nstrong views they're incredibly rigid right like \nthey're like super rigid with their thinking and  \nit's good once you make an emotional judgment no \nnuclear bomb of truth will change your mind so  \nsometimes i'll talk to people who have very very \nstrong and rigid views and and you know it's not  \nreally my place to say what's logical or illogical \nit's not you know but i think what's really  \ninteresting is that if you listen to his life like \nmy experience people i don't really know 100 with  \nhim but generally speaking when there are people \nwho grow up in really difficult circumstances\nthe need to adapt and survive has \nto come with a ton of rigidity  \nright like you you gotta wear a full plate armor \nin those kinds of situations like going to a court  \nafter being at a school and then like graduating \nfrom the school and wanting to go home  \nand having your mom sit there and say he can't \ncome home like you gotta build pretty big walls  \nand we can kind of like note and i shared \nthis with him i mean i i don't usually  \ni not usually i almost never talk about people \nwhen they're not on stream but i feel it's okay  \nbecause he was just there and i told it to his \nface but it's kind of interesting right because  \nhe has a peculiar absence of like certain \nemotions and what i've seen a lot in people  \nwho have traumatic upbringings especially men is \nthat the most accessible emotion is like anger  \nand we can kind of see that and and it's kind of \ninteresting to hear him sort of talk about you  \nknow how angry he was and stuff like that and \nthen underneath that so i kind of think about  \nanger as an umbrella emotion which means that \nit's the emotion that covers all other emotions  \nbut you know i have to imagine i mean i don't \nreally know but like you know if i had to put  \nmyself in his shoes and you know i did something \nright in terms of raising my daughter and she  \nwound up at harvard of all places in spite of all \nof her circumstances i imagine i would feel pride  \ni imagine i would feel shame i imagine i would \nfeel angry at her for like not maintaining a  \nrelationship with me and allowing herself to be \npoisoned and then i imagine that in addition to  \nfeeling angry with her i would work really hard \nto devalue those feelings within myself right  \nso i would try to convince myself that i wasn't \nangry with her because that's a crappy thing to do  \nand we want the best for her and i don't really \ndeserve it and it's not really her fault and all  \nthat kind of stuff right like and that's just kind \nof you know i don't i don't really know where i'm  \ngoing with this but i think it was just really \neye-opening to talk to him and i can sort of see  \nnow where a lot of like rigid beliefs sort of come \nfrom and what i've noticed with people who are  \nvery like politically charged and also like \ndon't express a whole lot of compassion is that  \nthere is an immense amount of rigidity that these \npeople often times like so i remember back in 2016  \num so when trump first won the election so i was \nat uh you know i was training at harvard medical  \nschool at the time and like i was in this like \ngroup therapy education thing so i was like in a  \nclassroom with like a bunch of my colleagues \nand like psychologists and stuff like that phd  \nstudents and so people were talking about \nthe election and and how it made them feel  \nand so i sort of shared this idea i was like you \nknow everyone's like i don't understand how anyone  \ncould vote for trump he's like so despicable and \nthey kind of point out like all of like the the  \nworst things in their mind about trump and so i \nsort of said because i'm from texas right so i've  \nlike talked to some of these people and i sort of \nsaid like you know i don't think people are voting  \nfor him because of those things i think y'all are \nmissing like a big part of what he's appealing to  \nand what trump is really appealing to is that like \nthere are a lot of people who have been growing  \nincreasingly disenfranchised they're \ngetting squeezed their life is getting worse  \nand like year after year like all they see is like \nthe sort of the easy life of the 80s and 90s kind  \nof like decaying towards 2016. you know your house \nis in disrepair you've got like a truck on cinder  \nblocks in your front yard um you know you can't \nafford health care and and all that kind of stuff  \nand so what he was is like a \ngreat big screw you to the system  \nand i just don't think that like people in the \nacademic setting like i don't think they've spent  \ntime in like you know rural ohio or rural texas \nso they can't fathom what these people go through  \nand what i found time and time and time again \nis that you know people who are very like rigid  \npolitically and also like trump kind of supporters \nis that their lives are like incredibly hard and i  \ndon't quite understand i'm not i don't mean to say \ni think it's actually like really kind of unfair  \nto say that if your life sucks like that's why you \nsupport trump like people have their beliefs for a  \nreason and we should respect that instead of you \nknow assigning some kind of weird psychological  \nreason but it's just a pattern that i've noticed \nthat when people have really really hard lives  \nyou know sometimes it really galvanizes them \nand it sort of like really forms they have to  \nform really rigid thinking almost to sort of \nsurvive how do you make sense of a world where  \neach light each each time like the world gets like \neach year that goes by the world gets a little bit  \nharder and a little bit harder and a little bit \nharder and a little bit harder and so i i think i  \ndon't you know it's something worth exploring it's \njust a pattern that i've seen and i think it's  \ninteresting because david even said he was like \ni'm not surprised to hear this story which makes  \nyou think right why is not even david surprised \nto hear this story i mean he has no training in  \npsychology and i don't think it's necessarily \na psychological thing i think sometimes our  \npolitical beliefs have a lot to do with our \nupbringing which sort of makes sense right\num i think we see this a lot with like \ndoomers and in cells and stuff like that  \ntoo like the way that you believe that \nthe world works is heavily influenced by  \nthe way that your brain interprets the world \nworks and the really tricky thing there is  \nthat your experiences are a hundred percent real \nbut your conclusions and the abstractions that  \nyou draw from the world are not 100 real and \nthis is the really tricky thing is that when  \nyou talk with someone who believes their \nabstractions about the world are 100 real  \nwhat you're really running up against is their \nexperience which is absolutely 100 real so if  \ni asked out three girls and i saw the three girls \nthat i asked out ended up dating football players  \nthat experience can form a view of the world \nthat is like very very rigid and we can't blame  \nthat person for believing that because like you \nknow we all form beliefs about the world based on  \nour experiences it's literally how our brain is \ndesigned it's how we learn how to walk it's why  \nkids drop things on the floor when they're eating \nright they're like learning how gravity works  \nand based on your individual experience you draw \nconclusions about okay this is how gravity works\nso you know i'm actually pretty hopeful i think \njimmy i i actually feel really hopeful for him  \nin some ways um i think i don't know if you \nguys caught this but he was making a lot of  \ncontradictory statements towards the end you know \njust like a lot of like you know you gotta fight  \nfight like the whole time it's like when someone \nwrongs you you can't it's not just payback it's  \nlike you gotta overdo it like if you fight like \nyou wanna you wanna you know toss and match my  \nway i'm gonna toss you know a torch your way \nand and so towards the end some of that stuff  \nand i think he's really had some experiences \nwhere like you know hopefully he's one step  \ncloser to being compassionate and understanding \nand it sort of makes sense why he makes fun of  \npeople right because that's sort of like what \nhappened like even his a sponsor made fun of him  \nhe was a funny guy so that's just \nyou know it means a different thing\nso so rl was saying he was more open-minded than \ni expected so this is my experience this is really  \nimportant so i think most human beings are pretty \nopen-minded the only challenge is that when you  \nengage with them about a rigid thing and you \ntry to argue with them they're not open-minded  \nbe someone being more open-minded than you \nexpected has a lot to do with the way that  \ni approach him so when you approach someone with \na closed mind they are going to be close-minded  \nwhen you approach someone with an open \nmind they're more likely to be open-minded  \nand so like i see this a lot with especially \npolitical discussions and even fall victim  \nto it myself where like sometimes if i have a \nbelief and i start off like pretending to be  \nopen-minded by asking questions and listening \nto them like you can you can notice this  \nthought process in your head where you can like \nask a question but you don't really care what  \nthey say you're not really listening what they \nsay you've already formed your own conclusion  \nand you're just waiting for them to stop talking \nso that you can point out how they're wrong that  \nperson is going to be close-minded because \nyou're approaching them in a closed-minded way  \nright it's sort of like i'm going to trap you \nwith my questions and what do you think about  \nthis i'm just using that as a facade to pretend \ni'm open-minded and therefore as soon as you're  \ndone talking i'm going to tell you how you're \nwrong if that's the way that you approach people  \nyou're going to be they're going to be \nclose-minded because you're being close-minded  \nso and this is we've seen this time and \ntime and time again on stream right like  \nwe kind of joke that we haven't had a real incel \non stream and like why is that it's because you  \nknow you know the the fire breathing angry incels \nthat we see on the internet when you actually  \napproach them with like compassion and an open \nmind like they all turn out to be relatively  \nrecent decent people and like well i mean i \ndon't know about all but you know we've got  \na sample size of like two or three or whatever \nyou know and that's been my experience so in in  \nterms of y'all if you guys you know have political \nbeliefs that you disagree with or someone who's  \nsuper rigid even like parents who are narcissistic \ntrying to understand them can go a really long way  \nlike and and sort of doing your best to sort \nof like recognize that this is a human being  \nwho believes what they believe \nfor a reason they're not stupid  \nand this is the other thing that happens with \ntrump supporters right is like people call them  \nstupid like that's not gonna work all you're \ngonna do is galvanize their beliefs cause them  \nto dig their heels in more and double down on \nwhat they believe so you know i've had some um  \nyou know some interactions with folks \nwho are like anti-vaxx and then like  \nyou know got sick and then you know telling \nthem hey this is dumb you should you know this  \nis your fault you deserve this is not an effective \nstrategy that actually causes them to double down  \nand sort of saying you know treating them like \ntreating human beings who are sick with compassion  \nis the right move irrespective of what their  \nyou know vaccine beliefs are you're allowed to \nfeel frustrated you're allowed to think that  \nit's incorrect that they believe that way but \nlike i think they still deserve your compassion  \nright i told you so is not a winning \nstrategy to like open people's minds up\nyou"
