    "transcript": "so I don't know if you guys heard this\nbut\num there was recently I think like as of\nthis weekend\nso China actually passed a law that\nlimits online video games to three hours\na week for young people so what this law\nbasically says so for those of you who\ndon't know\num\nwhen you play an online video game in\nChina this is correct me if I'm wrong I\nmean I've talked to people in China and\nstuff but this is my understanding is\nthat you have like a national ID that\nyou you know anytime you sign up for a\ngame like you link your account in game\nto your national ID\nand so then what they what they've\nessentially done is they've like\ninstituted this this law that you are\nnot allowed to play games like Monday\nthrough Thursday at all so all of your\naccounts are linked to this national ID\nand so they're like don't let you play\nthose games and then on Friday Saturday\nand Sunday you're allowed to play I\nthink one hour a day and they may even\nhave restricted it from eight to nine PM\nyou also get to play one hour a day on\nholidays so China recently passed this\nlaw\num and so we're going to talk a little\nbit about it you know why I think this\nis happening and then also like you know\nwhat to kind of expect going forward so\nthe first thing to understand is that\num video game addiction is like a big\nproblem and we don't quite understand\nwhat the relationship between video game\nthe increase in playing video games and\na group of social movements is so like I\nmentioned earlier you know there's stuff\ngoing on in lots of different countries\nso in in you know the US and Europe\nwe'll call them neat so these are people\nand not an employment education or\ntraining in South America they're called\nnini's Sonia studiar people who are not\nworking or studying\num in in Japan you know I think they\ncall them hikokomoris and in China\nactually recently there's been like a\nbig movement called laying flat which is\nthat there's a group of young people who\nuh are sort of like not engaging in like\nthe work culture so China also recently\npassed um their Supreme Court made a\nruling that the 996 work culture which\nis 9 A.M to 9 p.m six days a week is\nactually illegal so there's this big\nculture or and if you're Chinese you\nknow feel free to correct me this I'm\nsort of hearing the second hand from\ncolleagues of mine and friends of mine\nin China\nthat you know there's there's sort of\nlike young people there are just not\nlike not interested in working like\nthey're not interested in you know\ngrinding all day spending six days a\nweek 12 hours a day for like a small\namount of money and then like you know\ngetting on this this you know stair\nstepper of like walking every day and\ngetting nowhere and eventually getting\npromoted and stuff there used to be a\nlot of you know Pride that people took\nin this kind of sacrificial work culture\num you see that kind of that that\nsacrificial work culture in Japan as\nwell you see it in the United States you\nsee it in residency for sure where\npeople are like you know I worked 100\nhours a week and it was like it was\nterrible but man I survived and like you\nknow there's like this really like\nmachismo kind of like culture where the\nharder you work and the more you deprive\nyourself like the more you know\ncredentials you get the harder you train\nthe more badass you are there's this\nkind of like sentiment right but what's\nwhat we're seeing just across the world\nis that younger people right so we're\ntalking like starts with the Millennials\nand gen Z are just not signing into it\nand so people have hypothesized that\nvideo games are a big part of this I do\nthink that they are a part of that but I\nthink that what's happening is people\nare demonizing video games\nfor essentially like a lot of other\nsocietal problems so you know our video\ngames kind of addictive yeah absolutely\nand we're going to talk about that in a\nsecond but I think that what people here\nare missing is that there's a Confluence\nof events that gets young people\nuninterested in participating in society\nand then when I choose not to\nparticipate in society because I don't\nget paid enough I don't get enough\nrespect I don't enjoy my job it's not\nfulfilling when all of those things\nhappen right I'm I have tons of this\nstudent loan debt\nwhen all of those kinds of things happen\nthen I choose not to participate in\nsociety and when I choose not to\nparticipate in society what do I do with\nall my time and so what I end up doing\nwith all my time is like video games\nright so I think that there is an\naddictive component for sure which we'll\nget to in a second but I think\nessentially what's happening is that\nthere's a great deal of unrest with\nyoung people right so people are\nconcerned about climate change they're\nconcerned about wealth inequality\nthey're concerned about all this kind of\nstuff which are very valid concerns and\nso people are taking a step back and\nsaying you know what I'm just not going\nto play this game and what they turn to\nis video games instead there's also\nreally interesting I'm gonna try to dig\nup this reference for you guys but I saw\num you know this is a paper that a buddy\nof mine at Harvard Business School sent\nme about young people's uh young people\nentering the workforce is it an all-time\nlow so historically like in the last 100\nyears especially young men are at an\nall-time low for entering the workforce\nso it used to be that the demographic\nthat\nenter the workforce in the most stable\nsolid demographic of people kind of\ngoing into work were like young men like\nmen between the ages of 18 and 25. and\nfor the first time like that number is\nlike remarkably low and people are\ntrying economists are trying to figure\nout you know what's the reason for this\nchances are it's multifactorial but I\nthink what we see is that people are not\nentering the workforce and they end up\nplaying video games like what's going on\nthere what's the cause what's the effect\nI imagine it's like somewhat circular\nand reinforcing right so video games\nmake it harder for people to enter the\nworkforce and when people are not\ninterested in entering the workforce\nthey end up playing video games\nbut I think what you see is a lot of\nInstitutions and governments and policy\nmakers what they're doing is they see\na bunch of young people playing video\ngames and they say that's the problem\nthat's what you see right it's like the\ntip of the iceberg above the water but\nit's not it that what they don't ask\nthemselves is why are these young people\nplaying video games like sure they're\nplaying video games but what's the root\ncause what's driving the behavior all\nthey're sort of focusing on is the\nbehavior itself and this is something\nyou know you learn if you work in\naddiction Psychiatry is like you can and\noh my God I'm about to go on a fun\nattention but you can take an alcoholic\nand you can send them to rehab for 60\ndays where there's no alcohol available\nand this is the business model for like\nhalf of the rehabs out there they're\nlike we're gonna take you to this\nawesome spa-like place where we're not\nyou're not going to have a choice to\ndrink because there's no alcohol\navailable\nso what we're going to do is remove the\nproblem from your life and that's what\nwe're going to call a rehab and these\nrehabs are fantastic because they don't\naddress the underlying issues they don't\naddress the drivers of behavior they\njust restrict the behavior artificially\nand so people go to the rehabs they get\nsober for 60 days they feel awesome and\nthen they go home and then alcohol is\navailable and what do they do they\nrelapse\nand when they relapse that's fantastic\nbecause you had such a good experience\nat that Spa that charged you seventy\nthousand dollars\nI guess I need to go back because I had\nit I was so good so it's this awesome\nbusiness model that that you know\nencourages temporary sobriety and repeat\ncustomers\nand so what happens is I'm seeing a lot\nof these like policy level changes where\npeople are sort of targeting video games\nas the problem and it's definitely a\ncontributor don't get me wrong\nbut I think it's sort of like that's\nthat's the equivalent of taking an\nalcoholic and and sticking them into\nrehab and preventing them from sort of\nlike playing games right and that that\namount of restriction could help it\nprobably will help but it's not\naddressing the underlying causes\nand I think part of the the other kind\nof interesting thing here so I think\nwhat's going to happen is that the the\nlaw will pass and hopefully it'll help\nsome but I think two things will happen\nuntil you when you have a bunch of\nGamers who want to play video games\nthey'll find a way to play video games\nokay so first thing that a buddy of mine\nwas explaining to me is that you know\noftentimes like like you have a national\nID right so it's like linked to like\nyour driver's license or whatever like\nso you have a national ID then you're a\nminor you're a 16 year old kid like what\n16 year old kid is going to do is good\nthey're going to go at their Grandpa's\nnational ID and they're just gonna sync\nthat with all their accounts and then\nit'll lift all the restrictions they'll\nkeep playing games anyway\nit's not hard to find someone's like\nnational ID to link a Grandpa's not\nplaying video games like you got Grandpa\nyou've got grandma you've got Mom you've\ngot dad you've got your great uncle you\ngot a bunch of people out there who\naren't playing video games and you've\ngot a bunch of national IDs so you're\njust going to keep playing and I think\nthat's what's gonna happen so as long as\nthe driver for the behavior is there you\ncan try to like suppress it right like\nyou can try to restrict we see this in\naddiction as well where like you know\nyou're yeah you know there are kids who\nsmoke pot and their parents don't want\nthem to smoke pot they're addicted to\npot so what do they do like they find a\nway to smoke pot chat they find a way to\nsneak out of their their house you know\nput a ladder outside their window climb\ndown their friend meets them in their\nbackyard they pass them a joint like\nthey find a way to do the behavior\nso I think it's an interesting\nintervention I think it's kind of an\nauthoritarian approach that doesn't\naddress some of the underlying problems\nI'm not surprised that the the passage\nof this legislation came now because\nlaying flat in China has been growing so\nmuch so like people have noticed right\nso I heard about it right and I'm not\nlike in China so I think that there's a\nthere's an increasing amount of like\nfrustration and dissatisfaction with\nyoung people and so like policy makers\nare looking at that and they're saying\noh video games are the problem right\nbecause this is freaking video games\nlike these stupid video games we see\nthis from parents as well in our parent\nprogram where like you know parents will\ncome in and they'll say like how do I\nget my kid to stop playing video games\nbecause like the video game is the\nproblem the video game is like the ABS\nyou know that's the real problem like\nhow do I get them to stop\nand what we do when we work with these\nparents is we like hopefully the ones\nthat work with us begin to realize like\nthe video game is a symptom it's not the\nroot cause and that if you really want\nto get your kid to stop playing video\ngames and you want to fight them\nconstantly for it what you need to do is\nlike get them on the same page and help\nthem understand how video games are a\nproblem and address the underlying\nissues sometimes it means getting your\nkid into therapy sometimes it means\nhelping your kids succeed in ways that\nlike they're struggling with right\nsometimes it means being being like okay\ndo you like or do you feel or you're\noverweight and people make fun of you\nlike what do you think about like going\nto jiu jitsu class would you be down to\ndo that and then the kids are like yeah\nactually like that'd be pretty cool and\nso then like the parent encourages them\nand it involves dealing with the\nunderlying drivers of behavior instead\nof restriction\nand when we do that it works out really\nreally well so I think what's happening\nis this this measure is somewhat\nreactionary I think we're going to see a\nlot of people bypassing it because\nthat's what gamers are going to do\nthey're going to find a way to play\ngames if they really want to\num and at the same time I think it's\nalso like\nin response to a growing\ndissatisfaction that young people have\nand they're sort of blaming the video\ngame for it now speaking of blaming\nvideo games I'm not surprised that this\nlegislation passed for a couple of other\nreasons and I think we're going to see\nmore stuff like this actually all over\nthe world because the truth is that\nvideo game developers are actively\ntrying to make their video games more\naddictive and more damaging to people so\nlike what people are trying to do right\nso like like you know MMO makers for\nexample are trying to find ways to get\npeople to play the MMO for longer and\nlonger and longer right like you want\nthat lifetime customer like you want\npeople to play your MMO for a decade and\ncharge them they're 15 bucks a month and\nso game developers are actively trying\nto make the games more addictive so I\nthink that you know if you look at some\nof these um online like arena games\nright like fortnite and stuff like that\nwhat you actually find I was it was\nreally interesting I was trying to like\nfigure out why kids like playing these\ngames so much and I think what they've\ndone that makes it really interesting is\nthey've affected the rate of encounters\nright so they do this very very well so\nthey make it so that you can never relax\nin a game of fortnite because you never\nknow when you're gonna encounter someone\nand they shrink the arena so that like\nyou know once the player count kind of\ndies down every few minutes you're gonna\nrun into someone so you need to be\nconstantly paying attention to the arena\nlike you have to always be like paying\nattention but it it never gets to the\npoint where there's like a const it's\nnot actually constant it's like a random\nencounter right so like on in a six\nminute period you may encounter three\npeople in the first two minutes or you\nmay encounter one person at one minute\nand one person at five minutes so\nthey've done a really really good job of\nlike engineering the situation that is\nvery addictive for the brain and keeps\npeople really really excited to play\nbecause you can never really relax and\nencounters are not so common that they\nbecome like boring right so if you think\nabout like grinding mobs in an MMO like\nthere's a lot of like stability to that\nwhereas in some of these online like\nbattle arenas like which you essentially\nwind up with is like this kind of really\ninteresting random encounter schedule\nwhich is consistent enough to where you\ncan never relax and that's actually very\naddictive for your brain\nand I'm seeing like growing amounts of\ndangerous unrest within parents and I\nthink that if video game developers are\nnot careful and they continue to make\nmore and more addictive games which I\nthink they're going to do what we're\ngoing to wind up with is like a\ncigarette kind of situation where the\nnegative impact of games is so profound\nthat you're gonna have governments like\nChina it's going to start with China but\nit'll happen elsewhere too mark my words\nyou're going to have parent groups that\nrise up and will be like calling their\ncongressman and stuff and saying like we\nwant you to ban this kind of game as The\nAddictive potential of games grows\nwhat's going to happen is more gamers\nare going to get addicted and more\npeople are going to start to think it's\na problem and then what what will\nprobably happen is people will come down\nhard on the gaming industry and the\ngaming industry May fight sort of like\nthe you know the tobacco industry did in\nterms of saying oh no they're not\naddictive and stuff like that and\nthey'll even find people like myself who\nwill say like hey there are positive\neffects of video games they'll find\npeople like myself who will say hey like\nyou know find the root causes because I\nactually believe that so I do think\ngames are addictive and I believe that\nthey're if you really want to conquer\naddiction it's not about restricting the\nsubstance it's about protecting you know\nthe underlying lying psychological\ndrivers right that's true that we have\nto address but I think if we see this\ntrend we're going to see this a lot more\nbecause as games get more addictive and\nas more lives get ruined like\ngovernments parents and societies like\nwon't stand for it\nand I think that you know I don't know\nhow this is going to affect you know 10\ncents it tencent is a major video game\ndeveloper in or publisher or whatever\ncompany in China so I don't know how\nit's going to affect their bottom line I\nsaw you know one figure that said that\nlike you know their income comes from\nthree percent of their income comes from\nMiners and 97 comes from non-minors so\nit may not affect their bottom line but\nI think it's like it's just the\nbeginning\nand so if we're not careful like as an\nindustry as a whole and we do not\nsupport the mental health of our of\nGamers like you're going to see more\nregulations like this and parents are\ngoing to come out and they're you're\ngoing to see like lawsuits and you see\nall kinds of crap\nyou're going to see like Congressional\nhearings you're going to see it all and\nso I think you can the last thing that\nI'll share with you guys is just a page\nfrom like darwinian evolution\nso you know a lot of the the bacteria in\nour gut at one point infected us right\nso I don't know if you guys know this\nbut we have for every one human cell you\nhave in your body you have ten uh\nbacterial cells so you have 10 times as\nmany bacterial cells in your body as you\ndo human cells\nand so essentially what happens is that\nwhen when you have an infectious agent\nif you want to survive what you need to\ndo is become symbiotic and what that\nmeans is that you have to deliver enough\nvalue to the organism to where the\norganism doesn't try to kill you it\nactually like is happy with you hanging\nout because you bring something to the\ntable\nand I think the video game industry and\ngames in general are are at a really\ncrucial Tipping Point so games do do\ngood things they like they were they\nwere somewhat they helped us somewhat be\nresilient during things like the\npandemic you know people like my wife\nwho like aren't Gamers like had trouble\nwith social interactions where I was\nlike I'm gonna play DotA like that's\nwhat I did before the pandemics what I'm\ndoing during the pandemic can actually\nhelp a lot\nbut if the gaming industry is not\ncareful what and we continue to make\nmore addictive games and more damage in\ngames games that bankrupt your player\nbase what you're going to actually get\nis a situation where like you're going\nto get a darwinian response and then\nlike people are gonna say hey these\nthings actually hurt us more than help\nus and then you'll start to fight\nagainst it whereas I think really the\ndirection that we should move in because\nI I love video games is to become more\nsymbiotic right to like have video games\nbe like a healthy part of your life but\nnot an unhealthy part of your life for\nvideo games to be a a way that you can\ninteract with people and like form\nconnections with like people and have\nthose connections be real have ways to\nfind support\nand at the same time like all of those\npositives like being balanced by you\nknow just the the right amount of\nEngagement and if we don't like in the\nnext five to ten years I think we're\ngoing to see a lot more legislation like\nthis I don't usually make predictions\nchat but I mean I'm seeing it we're\ngoing to see a lot more parents getting\nreally really upset and then like you\nknow once the Facebook moms start going\nto town on something like it can get bad\nreal fast\nso\nyou know I'm not surprised that China\npassed the legislation I think it's like\na signal of things to come if the\nindustry continues moving in in the\ndirection that it is and at the same\ntime I think that the legislation is\nsort of like addressing a small part of\nwhat I view to be like a much bigger\nproblem"
