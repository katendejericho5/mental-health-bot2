    "transcript": "so i i know that today's interview was\njust a little bit different so you know\na lot of times when people come on on\nstream like\nit's all about negative emotions and and\nthings like that\nand you know people are crying and\nwhatnot but\ni think it's important to remember that\nreally the goal of the stream is to be\nlike educational right and help people\nunderstand different slices of life and\na lot of times those slices of life are\na little bit negative but it's\ninteresting because a lot of the\nquestions we get are like how do i do\nthis like how do i become successful how\ndo i understand the flow state how do i\nenter the flow state how do i you know\nwhat what are the pieces of that and the\nreally interesting thing about lyle is\num i think he's he's done a good job of\nlike stumbling on a lot of this stuff\nthrough his own\nexplorations and so\nit's really more a little bit\nabout understanding the flow state like\nhow to do creative work how to be a\nlittle bit successful by carving out\nyour own niche\nand those are all like important topics\nfor people as well so i know that\nsometimes it's not quite as you know\nentertaining\nin terms of like voyeurism but hopefully\nit was helpful to people who are curious\nabout this kind of stuff\nanyway welcome friend\nthank you for having me\nthank you for coming on i see you are uh\nyou appear to be a gecko\ni i i do appear to be a gecko i uh i\nspent like while you were running late i\nactually i was glad you were running\nlate because it gave me some time to\nlike i was trying to screw around with\nmy uh background because i normally have\nlike\nclouds or outer space or something but\nuh\nit didn't work\nyeah so um can you tell me what you go\nby like what do you want me to call you\nshould i call you\nyeah\nhow do i you he's you can you can just\ncall me lyle that works okay lyle yeah\nso tell me a little bit um you know do\nyou have a is there a particular topic\nthat we're talking about today or um\nyou know something in particular that\ninterests you\ni don't know i guess the\nthere's like a sort of\nmaybe it's trite but like the idea of\nyou know what's what's you know if\nyou're a a person who\nyou know talks to people about their\nproblems on the computer it's like what\nare your problems you know but i don't\nknow that felt cliche\nto me in a way isn't you asking\nme what my problems are or i'm asking\nyou what your problems are\ni guess i guess you asking me what my\nproblems are but i think this is sort of\ninteresting because well i mean you're a\nreal therapist\nand i'm a gecko\nguy\nyeah i mean are you\nare you not a real therapist\nno\noh okay\noh wait did you not know that no i i\nwasn't sure\noh okay okay yeah\ni hope i didn't like yeah i hope i\ndidn't want to feel like i was tricking\nyou\nno i i mean i i i think you're pretty\ntransparent in in you know that this is\na character and an act and at the same\ntime i actually you know have no idea\nabout what your educational background\nis or things like that so i try not to\nassume\nbut um if you want to you know talk\nabout or share uh something about maybe\nthings that you struggle with or stuff\nlike that sometimes people like to get a\ndifferent perspective\num\nand so we can definitely do that\na lot of times people will want to talk\na little bit about\nstress related to\nyou know being a particular character i\nthink interestingly enough um you know\nit's very overt that you or a character\nmight assume once again that lyle once\nthe makeup comes off and the gecko suit\ncomes off that you're a different person\nbut one of the things that i notice with\na lot of content creators is that it can\nbe hard because their content creator\npersonality can conflict\nor almost like even dominate their like\nreal personality and that can be really\nhard to kind of struggle with\num yeah\noh it's funny you say that because i\nactually i don't feel like i am all that\nuh\ndifferent\nuh from who i really i really i mean i\nfeel like every like you know\nuh you know online persona is just like\nan exaggerated version of who the person\nactually is\nand so i i think that i'm as much of a\ncharacter\ni think that the the the being on camera\nand broadcasting myself\nis like\nwhat would make me a character more so\nthan the fact that i'm wearing a gecko\ncostume i actually i made a i made a\npretty intentional like uh decision not\nto like\nhammer so hard into a character because\nlike you know it's one thing if you're\nlike you know borat and you're like\nmaking a skit for three minutes or\nsomething but like if you're streaming\nfor hours and hours and hours a day\nand i'm you know up there talking about\neating bugs or whatever\nyou know that just i feel like that\nwould just have gotten exhausting if i\nhad like committed really hard to like i\nam a gecko and all that you know\nyeah so what i'm hearing is that to\nretain some of your sanity\nyou can't go too far away from being\nyour authentic self\nyes absolutely\nyeah that's well said i think it so can\nyou just tell me a little bit lyle about\num\n[Music]\nso you know if you're okay with it i'll\njust ask you a couple of questions about\nhow you got to where you are and then if\nthere's something that um maybe we can\ntalk about that would be interesting to\nyou or helpful like by all means\num and then if you've got questions for\nme you know feel free to jump in at any\npoint so can you just tell me a little\nbit about you know how you got to\nbeing a therapy gecko on the internet\nsure um\nwell\nit was a quarantine and uh i started um\ngoing live on instagram with my friends\njust sort of\nscrewing around and\ntalking about nothing and like there\nwould be you know two people\nfrom my high school watching and uh it\nwas a lot of fun i liked\nlive streaming and i sort of thought\nlike\noh i wonder if like i could kind of do\nthis like in front of people who do not\nknow me\nand uh so i kind of had that thought in\nthe back of my head and then uh\nso there was that and then i made this\nother like youtube video uh where i\nand one of the one of the costumes was\nwas a gecko so i had a gecko costume\nthat's prong too\nand then uh\ndo you know about reddit streaming like\nrpan is yeah yeah yeah\ni know that tries to get me to watch\ntheir live stream a lot but\nyeah everyone hates them the top the top\npost it's it's a it's called rpan yeah\nand the top post every week in rpan is\nhow do i disable\nrpan you know everyone really doesn't\nlike them but uh\ni i started street i found our pan and i\nthought it was really interesting in\nlike a cool community because it's it's\nsort of different from twitch because\ntwitch is like gaming focused and rpan\nis like\nmore sort of anything um\nand so the combination of those\nthree things i started streaming on uh\nreddit as a lizard\nand and uh posting clips from tick tock\nand\nall of a sudden it became\nwhat i do to exist\nwow\nso how long did it take to become what\nyou do to exist what are we talking\nabout in terms of a journey here\nfairly quickly uh like you know i i\nstarted on um\nrpan and then i started a i started a\ntwitch like two months\nafter that and my twitch sort of grew\nenough that it became like a lucrative\nthing to do and now\nit's i am i am therapy gecko awesome man\nso how has how's that journey been for\nyou\nuh it's been a lot of fun it's been cool\num\nhow has it been\num it happened really fast i feel very\ngrateful because i know a lot of people\nlike you know i i don't i've only been\nstreaming for like\na year and a half and i know that it\ntakes a lot to get a stream off the\nground so i feel uh\nyou know grateful that i i was able to\nkind of make this into a thing pretty\npretty fast\nyeah\nyeah it's interesting a year and a half\ni i can't tell if that's really\ni mean it sounds like on the one hand\nit's fast right because some people will\nstream for years and slowly grow and on\nthe other hand it's still like a year\nand a half of your your life bro\nyeah that's true that's true yeah so it\nsounds like you've been working at it\nfor a while and putting in kind of\nthought and effort\nyeah and you know i'd been like do i'd\nbeen like\nmaking things on the internet for\nlike you know since i was like 13 years\nold you know and i\ndid uh\nstand up from the time i was like 16\nto uh like 22. so i'd been like\ni guess if you could call twitch\nstreaming performing you know performing\nuh you know\nfor for a while\nwow that's interesting can you tell me a\nlittle bit about what\ndrew you to making things on the\ninternet at the age of 13.\nuh\nyeah\ni guess uh i had this uh like\ni had this i can't describe it but i had\nthis like\ninternet show thing when i was 13 i\ncalled it i weekly and uh i was just\nripping off of robot chicken like i\nwould take like\nlittle dolls and stuff and like act out\nlittle things and then like cut to\nanother little thing with\ndolls or mcdonald's toys i had\nlying around that was\nactually that was when i was in like\nfifth grade\ni think\nand uh i've been pretty much making\nstuff on the internet since then\nso what drew you to making stuff on the\ninternet in the fifth grade\ni don't know i think that that's like a\nsort of\nlike\nlike pot like every every kid wants to\nbe like an internet star in a way like\nyou would see like fred and\nsmosh and [ __ ] and be like oh that is\ncool i want to have as many\nyou know youtube subscribers as fred and\nso you just start making stupid videos\non the internet which is interesting\nbecause i feel like that's gotten i feel\nlike that's\nmultiplied itself by\n10 000\nnow with uh you know tick tock and all\nthat\nyeah so it sounds like you you were you\nactually like you know you created stuff\nand you\nwere looking\nalmost like you had a goal in mind right\nwhich is that you wanted to be like\nthese people who had\na lot of subscribers and and created\ncontent and\ni think so i think so i'm trying to\nit's so hard i i'm so bad at going into\nlike my past with uh man whatever i i\nhear people like whenever i hear someone\nlike give a\nuh uh\nintricate story about their childhood\ni'm like how the hell do you remember\nthat i'm like trying to\nthink about what my motivations were\nwhen i was in fifth grade and i don't\nknow how deep they were but i that that\nthat that might have that might have\nbeen it yeah no i and by the way lyle\nit's it's completely normal to not have\nyou know not remember what you were\nthinking in the fifth grade\ni i thank you\nthank you you know so like validating\nthat so the interesting thing is if you\nreally look at like memories from our\npast yeah generally speaking i think um\nyou know the prevailing theory or at\nleast the one that i subscribed to is\nthat most of them were constructed after\nthe fact\nso like i'm really surprised when my\nkids will like\nremember things from when they were i\nhave a four-year-old and a six-year-old\nso they'll like remember like my\nsix-year-old will remember things from\nwhen she was three i don't think she\nremembers i think she just has heard the\nstories and so she constructs a memory\nit's a lot of time\nyeah so like a lot of times if you\nreally kind of look at it and there's\nsome meditation techniques and stuff\naround this as well\nmost of what we remember or impressions\nand then the narrative that you hear\npeople construct or the narrative that\nyou hear people share is actually\nconstructed\nbased on like some kind of memory\nimpression\num and there's like a lot of blanks\nbeing\nsort of filled in yeah absolutely so you\nkind of have like some kind of imprint\nand then\nyou know like you fill it in\nand then like human beings try to form\nnarratives about themselves it seems to\nbe incredibly adaptive and so you know\nat some point you know in your mind\nyou're kind of conceptualizing who you\nare and how you've become a gecko and\nwhat it means to be lyle as a gecko\nand where is the lile and what is the\ngecko so i think it's normal to not you\nknow have well-constructed memories\num and even\neven people like myself who will you\nknow tell stories and my stories come\nacross as coherent from my past\ntend to be like storytelling right it's\nnot like i really i mean i'll have\nparticular memory impressions which are\npowerful and emotional and then since\ni'm you know then i'll construct a\nnarrative around that which then makes\nsense to other people\nand so you're like exaggerating certain\nparts of it to fit in to like make a a\nstory\ni wouldn't say that clear beginning\nmiddle and end yeah so i wouldn't call\nit exaggeration but i'd say that if you\nreally think about it what you're doing\nis filling in the gaps absolutely right\nso and our mind does this automatically\nlike as it makes sense of things you'll\nkind of reinterpret things and then\nrealize oh the reason i did that was\nbecause\nyou know so for example like\nyou know the reason i got bullied is\nmaybe because of you know i was a year\nyounger than everyone in my class and\neverything was related to sports and\nstuff like that so i was like a\nfive-year-old competing against\nsix-year-olds and so that's the reason\nthat i sucked at sports was because you\nknow a six-year-old will destroy a\nfive-year-old in basically any sport\num\nand as actually i started school when i\nwas four so i was like a four-year-old\ncompeting against five-year-olds and so\nit was like not even a contest\nand then\ni can say that no wasn't impressive it\nwas actually i got i got rolled\nbut though it was impressive that you\nyou you were you were four but you\ndecided to do it anyway even if you were\nscared\nyeah so you know that that's see there\nthat's kind of interesting what you did\nthere because you said i decided to do\nit anyway because i was scared so if you\nsay something like that it constructs a\nnarrative of me being impressive\nbut actually what happened is\ni go to pe i dread pe every single day i\ndon't have a choice i know if i cry i'm\ngonna get bullied more\nso it wasn't like a testament to my\nbravery it was like you know being\nmarched off to the\nyou know like a the noose every single\nday\nand so it was it was a harrowing\nexperience but as we kind of put that\ntogether even that is sort of like i\nremember the fear and so what i'll do is\nlike fill in the gaps around it to kind\nof construct a narrative about my\nexperience\nright and you can reframe it to say that\nyou were brave\nsure i mean i i try not to but\nbut yeah absolutely sometimes people\nwill reframe things to make themselves\nappear better or more noble\nand in my experience that doesn't\nactually help and being honest about\nyour negative emotions and when things\nare hard for you is actually\nhealthier\nbut that's\ni like that\nso what do you kind of remember about\ngrowing up and what was growing up like\nfor you\ni grew up\nin a\nsuburban jewish neighborhood\nuh\nwe we did i i went to hebrew school\nuh i went to\nsleep away camp\ni was thinking about camp today because\nlike years ago i was at the jewish\ncommunity center\ncamp\nthat was fun\nuh i had uh i see my parents divorced\nwhen i like 2 000\nfour\nmaybe\nthat was a big that was a that was a big\nthing\num how old were you at the time\nah man i was\nhow [ __ ] old was that\nlike young like i had to be like\nsix or seven or something like that\nokay\nand you said that was a big thing what\ndoes that mean\nuh i don't know it's just like like i\ndon't like think about it that much\nbecause like it doesn't affect me that\nmuch in my current life it's something i\nnever think about like you know i know\nit's like\nfor a lot of families it's devastating\nbut for me it wasn't that like\nbig of a deal i guess but like\ni remember like i just i just remember\nlike that being a\nbig thing when it happened which i guess\nmakes sense in a way\ni know this may sound like kind of a\nweird question lyle but in what way was\nit a big thing\nuh\ni don't know maybe i just said that\ni i i don't have like a\nit i guess it wasn't a big thing now\nthat i think about it so let's let's\nlearn for a second okay so i'm going to\nmake an observation okay\nso do it\nremember we said that when you're young\nyou have just impressions\nbut when i ask you about it you don't\nhave clear memories and so before you\nwalk yourself back from the big thing\nchances are the only impression that you\ngot left with was that it was big\nright which is\nliterally exactly what we were just\ntalking about and so if i ask you about\nit and you're not able to provide\nanswers it doesn't mean it wasn't a big\nthing it just means you were\nsix\nyes and so like what are you gonna\nremember that is correct the\ncomplexities of why your parents get\ndivorced when you're six that is correct\nit was a big thing i can't dive further\ninto it because i was sick and have\nlike i cannot form other words to say\nsure that creates\nit\nbut i i but i remember like when i was\nyou know i mean it was a big thing in my\nfamily like when i was like\nyou know by the time that both of my\nparents had remarried it was like\ni mean it was actually kind of a great\nthing in a way because i mean the\ncircumstances of it\nuh you know might not been as great but\nlike it ended up being good because they\nthey my my mom and my dad are not\nvery uh\nlike compatible with each other they're\nkind of polar opposites\nso it's kind of it's good that they\nremarried to other people got it so it\nsounds like it ended for the best\nended for the best exactly yeah\nso just to think a little bit about\nconstructing narratives so we're gonna\ntoss out a couple of things okay let's\ndo it so you remember how you were kind\nof saying that\npeople will\nreinterpret things and make themselves\npotentially feel braver right we'll tell\nourselves tell ourselves stories that\nresult in like positivity and the\nreframing of negative things into\npositive things\nyeah yeah\nso a very common thing that i hear have\nno idea if this is actually the case\nwith you but just for something for you\nto think about is oftentimes divorce\nsucks for kids\nand sometimes what children will do is\nin order to kind of smooth everything\nover and not be angry and resentful to\nour parents for throwing our life into\nchaos at the age of six\nwhat we'll do is the whole family will\nshare and construct a narrative of it's\nfor the best because mom and dad are\nboth happier now and it's good to have\nhappy parents for happy kids\nand and i'm not saying that that's right\nor wrong or or whatever it's just a\ncommon pattern that i've seen that a lot\nof people will kind of reinterpret\nthings in that way and i'm not talking\nbecause i have no idea what exactly\nhappened with your parents or anything\nlike that sure but it's just such a\ncommon occurrence for us to say oh like\ndivorce actually was for the best like\nsometimes you know\ni i will say things about that in terms\nof my life like i'll say like oh you\nknow failing out of college was a really\nformative experience for me and made me\nwho i am which is absolutely true\nbut yeah also it was awful\nlike it was a terrible experience to go\nthrough yeah sure\ni will say\ni\ni do believe that the\nuh\nidea that everything happened the best\nis something i genuinely decided\non my own i don't think it was like uh\nlike i i wouldn't i don't i i don't look\nat it at all as like a narrative i\ncrafted to like have to deal with like\nyou know i totally think that it was it\nwas for the i mean i don't think like\nyeah i i don't remember like uh you know\ni don't i don't really have like any\nit's not it's not a tragic\nsort of part of my life or anything like\nthat i genuinely truly do believe it's\nit was it was for the best and can you\nhelp me understand how you came to that\ngenuine decision\noh yeah i mean i just i mean just\nlooking up who my parents like you know\njust looking at who they're with now\nyeah versus like like versus like each\nother like\ntheir spouses are who they're currently\nmarried to are like\nyou know and any anyone could look at\nthem and say objectively they are much\nbetter with the people they are with now\nthan uh the people that they you know\neach other\nso i'm hearing that you're you're both\nyour parents married far more compatible\npeople\noh for sure\nand so as a result you know it's like a\nno-brainer that they're like with\ncompatible people and being in a\nrelationship with someone that you're\ncompatible with is objectively better\nthan being someone in a relationship\nwith someone that you're not compatible\nwith which makes perfect\nand it doesn't have to be some kind of\nweird psychological\nre you know retelling of history or\nanything like that it's just like\nhonestly yeah exactly they just weren't\nright for each other and they found yeah\ni almost i feel like i feel nerve like\nnot nervous about this but like i do i\nyou know\nwhen talking to you i i wanna i'm trying\nto be conscious about like like in my\nlike i like my parents divorce is not\nlike a big like i i don't believe that\nlike\nwe would go down this whole\nrabbit hole that would be like oh my\nparents divorce is actually the root of\nmy entire problem i i genuinely don't\nbelieve that i'm trying not to\ntalk in a way that would lead us down\nthat rabbit hole because i don't think\nit would be\ni don't think it would lead anywhere\nyeah sure so what do you think\nsomewhere\ni don't know\ni thought i was kind of you know i you\nknow what's i thought was kind of funny\nis that i was uh i was like watching\nsome of your stuff\nuh i'm a fan i was watching to like\nprepare to come here and i heard you\nwere talking to a\npoke you were talking to pokemane\nand you said you asked her what you\nshould you should call her\nand uh you said like poke she's like\npokeman is more of a character and you\nsaid you don't like characters\nand i was like oh i'm about to show up\non this guy's stream he hates characters\ni'm gonna show up\nas a gekko\nand\nwhat was the conclusion that your mind\ncame to from that\ni don't know\ni think\nbut i don't know i'm not really i guess\nwe already sort of talked about this but\ni'm not really like a\ncharacter\nor anything\nis it important for you to show up in a\nway that i would like\nuh i\ni guess so i mean i don't wanna i did i\ndidn't think i was gonna piss you off by\nshowing up as a gecko\nbut\nyeah would it be okay if you did piss me\noff\ni'd like to not piss you off i\nappreciate that feeling is mutual\nand\nwould it be okay if it did piss me off\ni think i could i think i could get over\nit if i if i pissed you off\nyeah i don't want to piss you off but i\ndon't i wouldn't\nit wouldn't destroy me if i pissed you\noff yeah and i i'm i'm happy to hear\nthat because i think you know we're not\nhere for you to make me happy\nsure that's not why we're here\nand i'd say if you pissed me off i'd say\nlike you know me getting pissed off is\nmore on me now if you're acting in a way\nthat's like toxic or disrespectful or\nmalicious then i think that is fair to\nblame but i mean you get to come on here\nin whatever way you want to\nsure right and if i don't like it\nthat's something i have to deal with\nit's not your responsibility\nyeah i agree with i feel like if if if\nfor whatever if if me wearing a gecko\nsuit i didn't i don't i don't think i\nreally genuinely thought i would i was\ngonna piss you off but even but like\nthat's the thing is if i did if me\nwearing a gecko suit really did piss you\noff that i'd that would that i agree\nthat would be a you problem yeah\nall the more power to you dude i'm\nthrilled the only real concern i have\nabout the gecko suit is i'm curious\nabout whether the makeup is you know\nsafe to wear on a prolonged basis and\nwhether you've dr k i went to a\ndermatologist i went to a dermatologist\ndr well done\nand i and i i went to a dermatologist\nand i told them that i wear\ngreen paint\nand they didn't ask why but i told them\ni wear green paint for 20 hours a week\nand they were and i said uh\nis am i and i asked them like am i gonna\ndie\nand they said uh\nyou'll probably be fine\nperfect\ngreat i'll probably be fine dr k\ni'm so glad that you sought real medical\nadvice for that that's honestly the only\nconcern that i have about the gecko suit\notherwise it's like you know people have\ndye their hair people\nwear makeup people\nor you know where whatever\nand it's like you do you bro\nthank you doug i appreciate that\nand\nyou know kind of going back you were\nsaying like your divorce isn't really\nyour problem i'm sold i'm not worried\nabout it it's just sometimes for some\npeople it is you know i think like you\nsaid you kind of said they just weren't\ncompatible and they're like it's like\nnot that big of a deal totally fine man\nand then i got kind of curious about you\nsaid like oh it's like the root of my\nproblems but then i'm curious like what\nwhat do you mean when you say problems\nlike what are your problems your\nproblems\ndo i have problems\ni think\ni think well i think everyone has\nproblems one of my problems\num\ni don't know right now i'm have i'm\nenjoy i'm having a good time\nokay i don't think i'm trying the last\ntime\ni i feel like i really had a problem\ni don't know i i my life's pretty good\nright now i'm like i i'm i'm pretty\ngrateful for where i'm at right now i\nmean everyone like you know complains\nabout [ __ ]\nbut like if i were to actually like you\nknow take it like in the moment that i\njust did where i had to think like what\nlike what are my\nproblems to talk to dr k about\ni'm like i i'm\ni'm pretty pretty grateful for\nmy life right now i think in a large\nscale i\ndon't think i have any\nany glaring problems\ni i think you know i'm okay not fishing\nor digging for them\nif you're okay not\nwith if you're okay with me not doing\nthat\nlike did you come on here with the hopes\nthat i would uncover or unearth some\nproblem because if so we can go down\nthat route i could try harder but\nthere's a ton of stuff that i'm curious\nabout and i think that we can talk about\nthat could be like useful i would love\nto talk about the stuff that you are\ncurious about yeah so dude tell me about\nstand up bro like that's washed\nuh\nthat was fun i um\ni started when i was 16 years old like\nbecause i really here because the thing\nwas the reason i started when i was 16\nis because i i mean i wanted to do it\nsince i was 13 but i really did not want\nmy mom or dad to like watch me\nso i waited until i got my driver's\nlicense so i could go alone\num and so i did that and then i started\nlike uh it was it was it was fun i would\nlike uh\nyou know i was 16 and it was like there\nwould be like a school night and i my\nmom was [ __ ] really cool and she\nwould let me like drive down\ninto the city to\nhang out at like a punks club until 1am\nwaiting to go on at the\nopen mic and then i'd come back and wake\nup at\n6 and go into high school and i'm like\nyou [ __ ] do your intramural soccer\nand your\nfrisbee but i'm doing the cool thing\nhere you know\num\nbut yeah that was it was fun um\ni was gonna stop doing it\num\nbecause uh\ni don't know i just got i i i like i\nlike streaming more than stand up\nbecause stand-up you'd kind of do alone\num\nlike when you like when you have to\nwrite it like you sit in a [ __ ] dark\nroom and you have to like bang\neverything out but what i like about\nstreaming is like if you have a if you\nhave something that you want to express\nlike a feeling or a thought or something\nyou just you literally just say it\nand it and it and the purest form of\nwhat you just said is what makes it\nto\nthe person that is ingesting it as\nopposed to like you know a a\ntweet or something where you yeah right\nright write your thought go ah that's\nnot the perfect way to say it delete it\nright that's not the perfect way to say\nit delete it you know\nwhile you strike me as someone for whom\nlike authenticity is like very important\nabsolutely yeah you know like like what\ni'm hearing is that there's a certain\namount of\nsterilization that goes into tweeting\nand and you know crafting jokes and\nchanging editing words and\nthings like that i mean i think one way\nto look at it is craftsmanship i think\nanother way to look at it is\nsterilization right like it's like it's\nit's crafted\nit's it's you know processed it's not\nall natural\nabsolutely and on stream\nand i'm also kind of noticing like even\nwhen it comes to you know being a gecko\nit seems like the gecko isn't\nis really just\nyou know something that you kind of put\non but you're not really becoming a\ndifferent person\nno not really um\ni mean i like i like being the gecko i\nthink it's um\ni will say i think it's easier\ni don't i wouldn't even say this but\nlike i i like being slightly removed\nfrom myself even though i'm not like you\nknow i go by a lot like when i'm gekko i\ngo by\nlyle or geck or whatever but it is it is\nit's it's fun to be in and to speak as\nlike an entity\nas as opposed to like yourself\nfun to speak as an entity\nuh\ni don't know\nlike being uh\ni'm trying to think of how to go deeper\ninto that but like\nit's\ni like i like speaking\nas a i mean i stream as myself too like\ni mean i i guess i am always streaming\nwith myself but\nuh i stream not wearing the gecko\ncostume um\ni don't know it's like i i like\nokay so the biggest the thing on like uh\nthe reason why i think that like my\nstream has worked for me is like\nif i if i got up on twitch and i was\nlike\nmy name is lyle drescher and this is the\nlyle drescher show call in and ask me\nlyle for advice or something people be\nlike who is i don't know who this guy is\nwhat the who cares you know squirrel or\nwhatever but like presenting myself as\nthis like it's it's like a it's like a\nbeing\nthat i feel like can be more easily\nidentified with than like just some\nother random [ __ ] guy you know and i\nand i like that you know i think that\nthat is more more interesting\ni'm going to use a weird word here\nplease um but i almost almost getting\nthe sense that you're channeling the\ntherapy gecko\ni totally channel the therapy gecko 100\npercent\nyou know it doesn't sound like an act it\nsounds like you become a conduit\nyeah medium\nyes yes i definitely\nfeel like i channel\na therapy and if i and i will say if i'm\ntrying hard to channel therapy gecko\ni don't i don't want to say it's\ndifferent from myself because i believe\nthat like\nev every part of\nlike like i don't know\nif if people are so complex like i feel\nlike every\ni wouldn't say that me my channeling of\nthe gecko is like a different for me i\nwould say it is a part of me so i don't\nwant to say it's playing a character but\nit is like\ndifferent than how i would be if i were\njust like\nyou know having a conversation with\nsomeone\nyou know off stream or something\nlyle i have a concern that this\nconversation may completely go off the\nrails\nlet's do it so like here's the thing so\ni i don't know i mean if there ain't no\nproblems to talk about totally fine\nright so i think one of the biases that\npeople have is they assume that\npeople come on to the stream\nexplicitly to talk about problems and\nthat's what we're interested in but i\nthink what the story is really about is\nunderstanding people\noh yeah and so in a weird way\nwhat i kind of want to talk to you about\nwhat i think is interesting to hear\nabout\num is creative process\nsuccess\nand actually like flow\nlike are you familiar with\ni love i love the i always say i always\nsay like uh you know i don't try to give\nadvice too often but like i do feel like\num\ni genuinely feel like uh you know people\nare always like trying to like how can i\nbe happy but i feel like flow is better\nthan happiness well help me understand\nwhy flow is better than happiness\ni i don't know because fl because\nhappiness just feels like\npassive in a way like flow is like\nall-encompassing and it's it's\nit's very\ni don't know i like it like i like i\nfeel like i'm in flow right now talking\nto you i feel like i'm in that's why i\nlike streaming is because i feel like\nwhen and it doesn't always happen you\nknow streaming can you know it's it's\nnot great a hundred percent of the time\nbut like when it is it's like i'm i'm in\nflow state i'm fully engrossed in the\nconversation that i'm having and that's\nthat's when i feel the best is is when\ni'm in a flow state i'd like to be in a\nflow state as much as i possibly can\ni'm almost hearing you kind of say that\nhappiness is sort of like you kind of\nsaid it's passive and being in a flow\nstate is like alive\nit's like violent and experienced it's\nnot like\na calculation about like oh am i like\nhappy like yeah i'm happy like you can\nyou say that kind of in the abstract\nright\nlike if someone else was like\nit's like you know like\nlike like yeah like you could sit around\nlike like if you're sitting in a chair\nin your big house and you have a bunch\nof\nmoney and you have a loving family and\nyou like are piecing look you're\nthinking about your life and you're like\noh i'm happy you know i got good stuff\ngoing on i'm really grateful for my life\nlike that's good but i like\nbut like when you're when you're in a\nflow state it's it's you're not you're\nnot even [ __ ] thinking you're just\ndoing you're being you're in the you're\nfully in the present and i think that's\nwhen people are most happy is when\nbecause when they're when they're in the\npresent not when they're like\nthinking about their life from this\nethereal\n[Music]\nyou know sort of step ladder position or\nwhatever\nyeah so it sounds like you know\nsometimes when you ask the question are\nyou happy what people do is they\nmake an abstract or intellectual\njudgment\nabout whether the person in their\nsituation\nshould be happy\nsure and then they will say\nyes\ni have the big house in the big chair\nyes and and interesting that you use the\nword chair there\nyou know the big chair\nbut i like i like i like the way that\nyou phrase that like i like the way you\nphrase that like\nthinking should a person who has what i\nhave be happy\nas opposed to am i happy\ni like i like the way you phrase that\nyeah so i think unfortunately a lot of\npeople that i work in work with will you\nknow come into my office and say i have\nall of the things that people\nwho should be happy have\nand i'm not happy\nwhich is a really interesting\nexploration because\nif those things don't necessarily lead\nto happiness and you decouple having\nthose things from happiness what it also\nimplies is that if you have nothing you\ncan actually be happy\nright exactly exactly\nso let's try to understand\nwhere\nyou're i'm trying to think about the\nword\nhow did you get to be in a situation\nwhere you are grateful and engage in the\nflow state how did that happen for you\nwhere i was grateful or when i was\nengaged in the in the following how did\nyou get to where you are\num\nhow did i get to where i am well\nso i've noticed that sometimes when i\nask you a question maybe it's like kind\nof too broad\ndo you think it do you think it would be\ngood if i ask a broad question and kind\nof give you some time to think through\nit or would it be more helpful if i\njust kind of teed you up a little bit\nmore\nlet's try let's try what you took me up\na little bit more looks like so here's\nwhat i'm envisioning\nthere's lyle dresher\nyes six-year-old kid growing up in a\njewish neighborhood presumably jewish\ngoing to a hebrew school\nincompatible parents parents get\ndivorced you're not really in the flow\nstate then parents remarry and stuff\nthere's no real trauma or anything like\nthat you know nothing juicy\nfor like a psychologist or therapist or\nanything like that and then you're like\ni'm i'm in fifth grade\ni'm gonna make cool stuff on the\ninternet and so you started making cool\nstuff on the internet you got like six\nviews\nand then i don't know if if you were\nhappy then or not and then you're like\ni'm gonna go to stand up at the age of\n16 which if you want to talk about\nhaving a pair of balls of being brave\nlike you know going to punk clubs at the\nage of 16 and doing stand-up and unclear\nwhether people are laughing or not\nlaughing like\nyou know you kind of say you guys go do\nyour intramural stuff but i'm gonna go\ndo the cool thing whereas the other way\nto look at it is like you guys\nparticipate in society and i'm going to\nbe over here being an outcast\nyou know because i i i something tells\nme that when you were 16 years old you\nwere not the cool kid even though you\ndescribed doing the cool\nthings i felt as though\ni didn't feel like i was like actively\nuncool but i did feel like uh\ni had carved you know my friends and i\nhad carved our own\nsort of like if you think of a a\ntraditional\nyou know\nbuy it cool kids and not cool like that\nspectra i felt like as though we carved\nour own\nsort of lateral sort of thing later yes\nwe were lateral\nyeah and so were you\nhappy then\nand then i'm not quite sure how old you\nare it sounds like you're maybe like 23\nor something\nyeah i'm exactly 23. so\num\nyou know and then about a year and a\nhalf ago unclear whether you went to\ncollege or you know what happened or\nwhether you were supporting yourself and\nyou kind of start doing this side thing\na couple years ago\non instagram on reddit public access\nnetwork\non tick tock and twitch and now when we\nhear you talk about stuff it's sort of\nlike\ni'm grateful for what i have and i enjoy\nfeeling alive\nyes\nand so how where did when did you start\nto feel that way how did you get there\nman\nthat's what teeing up looks like by the\nway okay\nah okay yes you asked this yes there we\ngo okay you asked the same question but\nyou tweeted me out for it perfect\nuh\ni don't know if there is i don't i don't\nknow if there is a there\nright like is is is isn't that a thing\nlike is there a there you know of course\nthere's not like uh\nthere\nbut like um\ni've had uh\nbut it's like it's it's you know it's\nit's interest i feel like it's the same\nthe feeling that i have i had it when i\nwas 16 when i was in the rock club about\nto get on stage at one o'clock in the\nmorning when i had school tomorrow where\ni think to myself i'm like this is cool\nyou know and then there's a feeling that\ni have when i'm like\nyou know an internet gecko guy and you\nknow i'm twitch streaming for a living\nwhere i'm like this is cool you know\num\nbut i don't know if it's uh if it's a\nthere or anything like that\num\nyou know\nyeah so i i think lyle i think you're\ndoing it right because the more that you\ntalk the less sense you make and the\nmore you sound like a zen master\nso you know is there there is a very\nmaster kind of statement\nright because if you look at zen\nbuddhism they'll say like weird things\nlike that there is no there there is\nonly here and it's like does that even\nmean yeah yeah\nbut so help us understand what do you\nmean by like is there really a there\nthere is no there\nwhat does that mean man\ndoesn't make any [ __ ] sense\ni don't know is there like like there is\nnever a time in which like\nyou know you are completely\nyou you you have unlocked i mean i don't\neven know what the [ __ ] that would look\ni think that i genuinely think that\nlooks like death like if you\nlike you've unlocked everything you are\nsupremely happy you're in post game new\ngame plus whatever\nyou know\nuh uh\ni don't know i don't know if what that\neven looks like i think that there's\njust like people i think\nthe way to combat that is just to really\nlove the process and the the the the\njourney toward\nthe thing you know\nyeah but what if the journey sucks\nlike what happened so do you have any\nmemories of of going to the rock club\nwhen you were 16\nlike specific memories yeah like can you\ntell us like paint us a picture of like\nyou know\nlike what you remember like if you have\nkind of memory yeah i mean yeah i would\nlike show up and park my car in\nsomewhere where i was just hoping i\nwasn't gonna get a ticket and then i\nwould come into the\nthing and i was younger than everyone\nelse so i like i mean everyone else was\nlike you know\nlate 20s like like mid to late 20s or or\nsometimes early 20s\nwhich i guess looked like mid to late\nwhat i look at now if that makes sense\nyeah um\nand so like i was afraid i didn't i just\nkind of didn't talk to anyone\nyou know and i was real and a few like\npeople would come up and talk to me i\nwas really grateful\nfor those people because i was too you i\nwasn't gonna like\nmake the first like hey what's up man\nkind of thing\nyou know um\nso i really remembered everyone who came\nup and like would talk to me uh\nbut i i was being i was like nervous i\njust wouldn't like talk to anyone i just\nreally wanted to like wait\nsit watch comedians they don't like to\nwatch each other like stand in the back\nbut i but i didn't know anyway i didn't\nhave anyone to stand in the back with so\ni would just sit and watch\nand um\nuh\nand just kind of wait my turn i remember\nactually no this was the very second\ntime it was when i went to the rock club\nthe very second time i did stand up i\nremember being\nno i remember being in the i went to the\nbathroom it was like a punk bathroom and\nall these stickers and i was like really\nnervous i was nervous to be there like\nto walk into the room like while i was\n16 like from all these people who were\nyou know older than me and i remember i\nhad just read this book\nby this guy named chris gethard and in\nthe book he talks about uh\nhow he like well he he likes going out\nof his way\nto um\nput himself in situations\nthat are uncomfortable just for the\njust i i don't know i remember reading\nthat when i was 16 and that spoke to me\nso i was in the bathroom thinking about\nthat and being like all right i'm going\nto embrace that and i've actually that\nsort of started a\na a thing of like embracing\nbeing in uncomfortable\nsituations\num\nso i remember i was in the bathroom and\ni was like okay i'm not gonna leave i'm\ngonna stay and i'm gonna do my set it's\ngonna be uncomfortable but i think it's\ncool that i'm really uncomfortable\nright now you know i could like i said i\ncould i could have played soccer\nand what was it like when you did your\nset\nit was the second so that was the second\ntime i did stand up the first time i did\nreally well and then this is what\nhappens is you do really well and then\nyou second time you do the same like\njokes or whatever and they don't do as\nwell\nand uh\nbut it didn't jar me that much\none of the cool things about like going\nto open mics and stuff is like everyone\nthinks that stand up is so like\nlife like life or death like i can't\nfeel like oh my god i can't fathom the\nidea of like being up in front of people\nand like trying to be funny and not\nworking but then you go and you do it\nand you're like oh it's not it's it's\npart of the thing it's not that bad and\nyou see other people fail and and you\nknow\nit wasn't that bad it was kind of it was\nfun um you know i had a couple things go\nover well and i talked to a few people\nand uh\ni came home i felt cool and uh\nand yeah even though the second set\ndidn't\ngo well helped me yeah i know i still i\nstill felt cool i felt cool for having\ndone it you know i i wouldn't say it\ndidn't go well i said i i think um\nit went okay\nyou know um\ni i wouldn't say like like i like i\nwould rate it you know a six out of ten\nmaybe\num\nbut i liked uh i liked i liked the scene\ni liked\ngoing there and i liked being\nsomewhere weird at a weird time\nas a 16 year old you know i liked that\nso i really care\nhow the set went if i got to\nyou know do that\nso it felt\ncool\nto once again i'm kind of getting the\nsense of like carving out\nright like you're gonna follow\nright\nyeah\nyeah you just did a help me understand\nthat what what happened what is that\nwhat does car what does carving out mean\ni you're the one who used the words\ni am\nyeah so you were\ncarving out and forget that i said that\ndon't worry about it oh oh like oh oh oh\nyes carving the pa oh yes yeah okay yeah\nso but but something about when i used\nthe words just now to describe your\ncomedy experience it seemed like it hit\na nerve\nright like oh because i because i didn't\nrealize what you were uh oh okay okay\nbut now i do oh yes\nyes yes and that's um\nyou know that's i think that's kind of\nbeen a big part of uh\nmy\nlike a\nin a way approach to life you know\nas i've always wanted to\nyou know try to carve out my own\nthing you know\nand uh that's that's been a big goal of\nmine\nfor a while and and that's why i'm\nreally grateful i get to do this weird\ngecko talk show thing because it it\nfeels like i'm able to carve out my own\nuh\nyou know sort of path in life oh\nabsolutely i think i think you literally\nwear carving out your life on your\nsleeve\nright that's awesome\nlike i mean literally like you you\nput on a [ __ ] costume\nyes to show people that you're not going\nto play intramural whatever\nright\nyou're not going to look you're not\ngoing to look human\nyes yes you're goddamn right dr k\nand uh\nbecause i'm noticing like that's\nabsolutely a theme right like it's sort\nof like what i'm what i'm hearing is\nthat within you\nthere's a voice that has said don't do\nas others do do this other thing like\nand not so much that there's anything\nwrong with what other people do but\nreally like listen to what that internal\nvoice is because i don't know many\npeople who at the age of 16 were going\nto comedy clubs and doing stand up\ni know a lot of 16 year olds who had\ndreams of doing stand up\ni know a lot of 16 year olds who wanted\nto be stand-up comedians and have like a\nnetflix special or hbo special or things\nlike that i know a lot of 16 year olds\nwho thought they were very funny\nand could do stand-up\ni certainly knew a lot of 16 year olds\nwho thought they were as funny as the\npeople who are actually doing stand up\nbut i didn't know many people who\nactually did stand up\nwell now if you're a 16 year old and you\nthink you're funny you don't even you\ndon't even have to go to the rock club\ndowntown you just whip out your phone\nand make a tick-tock\nand granted i was sort of doing that\nsame sort of thing but uh you know\nso there's another thing that i kind of\nwant to just touch on for a second which\nis just really really sharing an opinion\num i don't know that i have a whole lot\nof questions for you but you know feel\nfree to\nrespond but like\nso i think a lot of times when people\nlook at success\nwhat they really look at is\nlike people will say like oh the guy put\non a gecko costume and like blew up on\ntick tock and that's why he's successful\nright there they'll say sort of say\nthings like put right place right time\nkind of like the stars aligned and and\nlike\nyou know\nthat's how you became successful but i\nthink for most people that i've worked\nwith who are very successful what i\nalmost always find is a story actually a\nlot like yours\nwhereas like you know the therapy gecko\nis not\nthe first step in a journey like you\nstarted making content on the internet\nat the age of what sounds like 10 or 11.\nyeah and so you've been thinking about\nit working on it you literally went to\nstand-up comedy clubs at the age of 16\nand you've been practicing creating\ncontent and being funny in the somewhat\nintentional way ever since your brain\nwas like very very young and like\nliterally wiring\nand then it's not surprising at all but\nwhat i tend to find i'll see this also\nin like you know some of the startup\nfounders that i work with that like\nvery few of them are successful with\ntheir first company like what happens is\nthey're like in when they were eight\nthey started a lemonade stand\nand then when they were 14 they like\nstarted this hustle at school where they\nwere like selling candy bars\nlike one guy that i worked with like\nthey you know the school stopped\nusing having a coke machine or something\nso they were like selling cokes like\nbehind the cafeteria and [ __ ] like that\nand then like you know they went on to\nbe like\nyeah black market cokes\num\nand and so i think i just wanted to kind\nof comment because i think a lot of\npeople in our community are sort of\ntrying to figure out like how do i be\nsuccessful\nor they'll sort of try to you know ask\nthemselves hey i'm like trying to work\non this stuff but it doesn't seem to be\nworking and i don't know what to do next\nand i think it's just important to\nhighlight that like\nyou know you've been working at this for\nprobably over a decade in some way shape\nor form\nand so the therapy gecko that people see\nis not just a random guy putting on like\na gecko costume\nit's like actually like you know when\nyou speak and you wind up being\nrelatively funny that there's like\nyou know a lot of like internal\npsychological work that you've done\nsitting in a bathroom and sort of like\nyou know\ndealing with your nervousness and then\ngetting up there and trying to be funny\nbeing okay with a six out of ten and\nthen showing up the next week and doing\nit again and like practicing and working\non your your craft\num\nit was just something that i i noticed\nhearing your story and just wanted to\nkind of point it out\nwhat do you think oh yeah i know i i\nappreciate that um it's funny i i've uh\ni've like sort of thought about that um\nyou know\ni\nuh\nthe the therapy gecko is very new but i\ni i like\nthis is sort of a random thing i was\nlike thinking about in my head i was\nlike you know\ntrying to give myself credit because i\nwas like you know the therapy echo is\nvery new but like the i\na lot of the\nsort of roots of it are are it are not\nyou know like i've been trying to you\nknow as i said sort of carve out my own\npath you know for a very long time and\nuh\nyou know\ntrying to do\nsilly things on the computer for a very\nlong time so\nlike even though like\nstreaming and being a lizard\nare kind of new i think the stuff behind\nit\nis is kind of not\nyeah\nso\ninteresting so okay um and\nwhat do you think it is that helps you\nget into that flow state\nyou need me to see you on that\nsure i'm\ni'd love to hear the tea up\ni don't have one\nokay all right well if i don't know that\nthat i think i could uh that question i\nthink you could answer um\num because i love this thing the tea up\nuh well okay so i mean a lot of the\nstuff that i was doing before like i was\ndoing this was like\ntrying to like\nwrite\njokes or write uh\nsketch and like that that's like right\nlike sitting down and writing\ngetting into the flow state is so hard\nlike i respect the [ __ ] out of people\nwho can like sit and write essays or\nwrite\nthe sonnet whatever the hell you're\nwriting like uh\nyou know i respect the [ __ ] out of\npeople who can do that because it's this\nthere's infinite like this is like i'm\nin the flow state with you right now i\nreally feel like you know we're having a\nconversation i can't\nstop our conversation to like go look at\nyoutube\nor like go eat a snack\nor you know go do this or like like\nthere's no\ni like i'm i'm in this i'm talking to\nyou we're doing this right now we're\nlive\nthere's no room for\nme to get distracted or anything whereas\nlike if you're trying to like write\nsomething or edit a video or\nmake a song or something like that you\nknow there's no\nthing that's like i don't know if i'm\ngonna use the phrase holding accountable\nbecause i don't really feel like i'm\nbeing like held accountable but like\nyou know\nit's it's much so so when i stream and\nlike you know i talk to people you know\nit's easy for me to get into the flow\nstate because like a conversation is\ndeveloping naturally\nand it's just it just is a\nmuch more natural thing to do than like\nyou know sit down and put pen to\npaper so you know i'd i'd been\nsorry so that's why i like it i like it\na lot as a\nas a as a medium of of doing things on\nthe internets\nand creating in a sense\ni'm with you so lyle now i'm gonna ask\nyou a question which yeah i'm gonna try\nto answer after i ask you but i'm gonna\nask you okay what what would you say are\nthe features of the flow state what\nmakes the flow state different from the\nnon-flow state\num you're doing more than you're\nthinking about what you're doing and\nyou're not\nso critical critical of yourself and\nanalyzing yourself\nyou know like if i'm really in the flow\nstate i'm not\nlike like if we're like when we're like\nlike you know at the highest points of\nlike flow i would say like in our\nconversation i'm not thinking about like\noh how's chat reacting to this or like\nhow is this coming off or anything i'm\njust talking you know and that's how i\nfeel like when i do my own stream is\nlike you know i'm not i'm really not\nthinking about anything else except for\nyou know the person i'm talking to but i\nguess to answer the question more like\nthe the traits of the flow state so i\nguess i'll maybe a lack of\na loss of ego i don't know i'm not gonna\nstart pretending like i know anything\nabout\nspiritual stuff but uh oh you know a lot\nabout spiritual stuff while\nuh\nwhat does that mean\nsee this is why i didn't want to say\nbecause then you were going to ask me\nwhat it means and i was i i don't know\nif i can explain it as well i guess like\nuh well i guess like what it means to me\nis like you know\nlike i said like if if i'm not thinking\nabout how i'm coming off i have the free\nlike like that's a crutch like thinking\nabout what other people think about you\nis like a [ __ ]\ncrutch and it'll prevent you from\nspeaking\nfreely because you're like oh no that\nsounded stupid that says you're just\nyou're speaking freely\num\nand\nso i think that that\nfreedom from\nself criticism as you're speaking or or\nas you're writing or painting or doing\nyou know whatever you'd be doing is is\nan integral part of the the flow state\nsounded like a pretty good answer to me\nabout what loss of ego is\nright so what i'm hearing is that there\nare times where you think about yourself\nas it relates to an activity\nif i'm writing am i a good writer is\nthis good writing and then there are\ntimes where you are removed from the\nequation and there is just\nyeah so it's kind of interesting because\neven if we go back to the beginning of\nthe interview\nthere were times where your ego was\npresent\nlike oh is dr k gonna be pissed if i\nshow up\nsee then you're thinking about how other\npeople will respond to you and now you\ndon't care what i think\nyou're not even thinking about what i\nthink\nthey're just having the conversation and\nso what we've actually done is somehow\nwe've managed to remove ego from the\nequation\nright and as we remove as you're no\nlonger concerned about oh am i supposed\nto be talking about problem am i\nsupposed to be doing this so i think\nsupposed to is another good word that\nsort of shatters the flow state\num\nbut i i think you you know this stuff\nand and that's why i don't feel like i\nhave to tee you up for it and i think\nthe only thing is you don't know that\nyou know it or you have you have you\ndon't have faith that you can explain it\nbut it's pretty clear to me and what i'm\ngoing to do at the end\nand maybe the end is you know whenever\nwe can do it now if you want to it\ndoesn't have to be the end but what i'm\ngoing to do is actually go through a\nlist of statements that you've made\nand kind of tie them together to like\nold spiritual texts on meditation\nspiritual growth and enlightenment\nbecause you do say a lot of remarkable\nstuff that like overlaps with what those\nfolks say\nthat's uh\nyou know what's funny is like i when\nyou're i'm always like\nhad this uh thing of like you know\nwaiting like\noh god you know no no no say the thing\nfirst and then i'll and i'll say go for\nit now i'm curious i guess like uh like\nif i had like if i had a thought like\nlike if you have a thought you're almost\nlike waiting for it to get like like\nyou're sort of waiting for it to get\nvalidated for other people to like be\nsomething that makes sense\nand like i think everyone has that i've\nbeen active\nand like and like i definitely have that\ni've tried to fight against that so you\nsaying that like i've said something\nthat oh another guy said that wrote a\nbook that was saying that thing i'm like\noh okay so i was onto something there\nwhen i thought that thing that wasn't\njust a crazy thing that i thought\nno yeah no i think you're on to a lot so\nthis is what i think is really i guess\nwe can do it now um because\nso the first thing that i want to kind\nof share is that like when you look at\nold texts on spirituality\num sometimes people will sort of talk\nabout philosophy or like argument or\nlogic and say like this is not like like\nyou know you can't\nwhat is ego death and they'll like try\nto understand it on an intellectual or\nlogical level so like what does it mean\nto lose your ego you know the loss of\nego but the really interesting thing\nabout these at least the spiritual\ntraditions that that i tend to place a\nlot of emphasis in that i've studied\nthat i propagate in some sense\num are sort of like the hindu and\nbuddhist traditions and and what i\nactually really like about them is that\ni think they're\nthey have a very scientific attitude so\nthey don't say that this is logically\ncorrect and they don't say that you\nshould believe this they say that if you\ngo and explore\nand try to figure out how this stuff\nworks when we tried to figure out how\nthis stuff works here are the\nconclusions we came to and we suspect\nbecause then we had a bunch of other\npeople go and investigate it on their\nown and this is consistently what people\ncome up with and so what i really love\nabout this is like literally today lyle\nyou've made statement after statement\nafter statement that i have read in\ntexts that are 600 years old a thousand\nyears old 2 000 years old or 4 000 years\nold and i pointed out one which is like\ni asked you how do you get there and\nyour [ __ ] answer is like it's like\nclassic zen there is no there\nright and no one knows what the hell\nthat means but like you understand it\nit like doesn't translate into like\nlogical words we can try to do a\nslightly better job there because there\nis a there's you know\npractice that can be done in explaining\nsome of these weird concepts\nbut they're sort of like anyway so let's\nkind of start from the top so the first\nthing that i actually want to point out\nis so i think how you got to where you\nare okay\nso\nwe've already talked a little bit about\nsuccess\nand how like i actually think that i'm\nnot surprised that you blew up because i\nthink you've actually dedicated yourself\nto like a craft for some time\nand if you think about you know your\ncognitive development and the way that\nyour neurons have wired like you are\nsomewhat of a professional when it comes\nto whatever whatever it is that we see\nlike this is not just a random\nhappenstance right you've been creating\ncontent since you were 10 you did stand\nup comedy like i was stunned to hear\nboth of those things but now it's sort\nof making sense for me\nand then you you also have like you know\nyou've experimented with different kind\nof platforms and stuff like that and\nfound a nice combination of what sounds\nlike live streaming on twitch which\nbrings out the flow state so you're also\ndoing a couple of really cool things\nthat i'll try to help creative people do\nwhat are the circumstances that\nnaturally blink bring out the flow state\nbecause when you bring out the flow\nstate you're going to create the best\ncontent\nand then you're sort of pairing up\ntwitch to get that live interaction to\nset yourself up to bring out the flow\nstate and then you kind of clip that\n[ __ ] for tick tock because you can't sit\ndown and make a tick tock yes some\npeople can sit down and script the tick\ntock but you cannot\nyou've got a farm tick tock moments on\ntwitch\nyes i this is i this is like i've been\nwaiting my almost like i've been waiting\nforever to figure this out and it's\nsomething i try to like\ntell people who are having like trouble\ncreating things is like i\nlike exactly what i can't sit down and\nlike write a tick tock but like what\nthe the way in which i edit\nlike\nthe twitch and streaming allows me to\njust get the [ __ ] raw thoughts\nthrough of whatever it is i'm thinking\nor or feeling and then when i go in to\nedit it i actually i have like it's it's\nthere and i just chop it away and like\nfind it you know and that's like\nsuch\na better creative process\nthan\nsitting and writing you know so can i\ndiscover that until recently yeah so can\ni share a couple of thoughts on that so\ni've worked with a lot of people who\nsort of experience things that way so i\nthink part of the problem with when we\nthink about how to become successful\nis that we're given a script right so\nthere are some people who have become\nvery very successful\nand then we'll look at them and we'll\nsay like you know you can look at\nsuccessful authors like you know let's\nsay like someone like brandon sanderson\nwho will say like you know sit down and\nlike write every day what you've got to\ndo is like write every day and then if\nyou read other people like stephen king\napparently like early on you know he\nwould use a lot of drugs and and just\nwrite very\nlike a ton of stuff so different people\nhave different creative processes so a\ncouple of things that i want to kind of\nhighlight about yours because i think a\nlot of people can become successful\nwithout forcing themselves into\na cognitive temperament that does not\nsuit them so a lot of the work that i i\ndo is about helping people understand\nokay what what's your cognitive\ntemperament and how can we set your\nbrain up for success so some people are\nthe methodical route like i'm gonna sit\ndown and i'm gonna write every day for\nsix hours and you gotta just sit down\nand just like do it and then some people\ni think this is really important so\na big part of the flow state like we\nsaid is separating the ego from the\naction\nand with some authors that i've worked\nwith what they struggle with is there's\nthe author and then there's the editor\nthere's like you know the person there's\nthe creative and then there's the judge\nand if both of those are coexisting in\nyour mind if you sit down and you try to\nwrite\nand the editor is there criticizing the\nsentence that comes out you will be\nparalyzed in front of the page you will\nnever get a single sentence out you have\nto let yourself write crap you have to\nseparate out almost like left brain\nright brain it's not really\nneuroscientifically based but it's a\nconcept that people understand you know\nyou have to set out to separate out the\ncreative part of you from the judging or\nediting part of you and what i hear you\nkind of say is like in the editing\nprocess what you do is you vomit out\ngolden trash on twitch\nand then you can let the editor step in\nand sort of sift things apart but if you\ntry to filter or create gold to begin\nwith you will never succeed\nyeah of course of course yeah that's\nthat's why\ndude that's that's almost like probably\na big\nkind of i was doing that for a while\nlike when i was like you know doing\nstand-up and making videos and stuff\nlike i was able to like get stuff out\nbut um [ __ ] i hate i hated that process\nof like sitting down to i never got into\nthe flow state\nof it you know and it's it's it's it's\ntough that's probably a big reason why i\nlike\nyou know i like to do twitch stuff\ninstead of that\nyeah so let's talk a little bit about\nthe flow state so i think there are a\ncouple of very important\npsychological things that you have done\nwhich have really set you up for success\nand these are things that i want to\nhighlight\nso you remember how your memory sucks\nyou don't remember anything\nyes\ndo you i'm gonna ask you kind of a weird\nquestion\nso there's been really only one time\nduring our conversation where you have\ngiven us an incredibly vivid and lively\npicture of a past memory from your life\ndo you remember what\nyou you remember what it was yeah it was\nthe i was being at the rock club\nabsolutely right so this is like how\nmemory works because i think that was a\ntransformative moment for you\nbecause what you did in the bathroom was\nembrace discomfort\nright that's that's those are the words\nthat you used so this is like when the\nyogis are saying acceptance\nlike that is literally what acceptance\nlooks like it's a 16 year old\nremembering a book they read sitting\nthere with butterflies in their stomach\nfeeling out of place in a [ __ ]\nbathroom about to vomit and saying you\nknow what let's go yeah let's go [ __ ]\nbecause you can retreat in that moment\nor you can embrace that discomfort and\nso the yogis say that like you shouldn't\ntry to push away negative emotions you\nneed to accept your negative emotions\nright right that's what literally what\nacceptance looks like and once you begin\nto accept that and embrace that there's\na there's a very common problem here is\nthat if people think oh if i accept my\nnegativity doesn't that do me like if i\naccept that i feel ashamed about myself\ndoes that mean that i'm like never gonna\nbe confident right because if i accept\nmy shame does that mean that like i'm\nnot gonna be confident but something\nfunny happens it's kind of like\nparadoxical that when you accept the\nnegative things when you embrace that\ndiscomfort what happens when you go on\nstage\nyou you don't feel\nas\nuncomfortable it's bizarre right yeah so\nsomehow by embracing and so you've\nstumbled upon you know a ton of these\nlike i'm telling like 2 000 year old\nlike\nlike you know wise things so that like\nembracing that discomfort and really\nsaying hey this is where i am like this\nis i want to carve this out this is what\ni want to do i don't want to play\nintramural soccer i want to be here and\nit's okay to be uncomfortable because\nthis aligns with like the life that i\nwant to live and when you embrace i\nthink that was a really transformative\nmoment for you and i think it's like\nthat acceptance which has been and\nthere's a reason why your brain\nremembers it right so\nthe reason that you have a vivid memory\nreason you don't remember anything about\nyour divorce is because it doesn't mean\nanything to you it's like there's\nnothing there yes right yeah yeah so\nlike what you do remember the important\ntransformative moments of your life and\nlike i think that was a big one where\nyou learned how to accept\nlike negativity and so if we talk a\nlittle bit about getting into the flow\nstate i think you know embracing the\nnegative is a big part\nof the flow state because in the flow\nstate you've used the phrase natural so\nhow do you get into the flow state as\nlong as you have internal conflict and\nwe can kind of hear this in a lot of\nwhat you've said the first is if you're\nediting the thoughts in your head right\nno flow state that's internal conflict\nif you have negative feelings that\nyou're trying to suppress or push away\ninternal conflict you're not going to\nget a flow state\nso a big part of the flow state is to be\nas you put it natural what does that\nmean to be natural i would argue that\nfeeling natural is not having an\ninternal conflict so if i'm laying out\non the beach and not thinking about\nanything and i feel completely unnatural\nand i'm alive and in the moment there's\nno conflict\nif i'm sitting there in my head thinking\nabout oh my god i'm here on the beach\nand i have so many bills to pay it's\ngoing to create internal conflict and\ni'm not even going to enjoy being on the\nbeach\nyeah okay\nso i think it's really like that that\nmoment that you had there was like a\nreal like you know\nturning point in a in a movie about\nsuccess\nkind of thing it's like when people play\nthe triumphant music and\nand then you go out on stage\nand then i think there's another really\ninteresting thing there which is if you\ntalk about the way that you respond to\n[Music]\nto\nhow people responded to you so the first\nset you did you had sounds like not\nreally a whole lot expectation so you\nwere pleasantly surprised or maybe you\nthought you'd suck you just went up\nthere and people like you you kind of\neven remember like it's so interesting\nthat you remember what your first set\nwas like what the reception was like\nwhat the second set was like what the\nreception was like first one went really\nwell and then second one\nit's really interesting because if you\npay attention it's beautiful the way\nthat your cognition works because you\nsay\nit didn't go as well or you said\nsomething like it went bad and then you\nactually rewind it a little bit and you\nwere like actually it was about the same\nit didn't go that much worse it was like\na six out of ten so if we look at those\ntwo statements what happens is probably\nwhen you went up there the second time\nyou had an expectation hey i'm fine\nit's gonna go great and it did not go\nthat great and then you felt emotionally\nlike oh my god this is going so much\nworse and now when you think about that\nmemory in the past the first answer that\ncomes out is that emotional oh crap\npeople aren't laughing as much but then\nas you start to think about it a little\nbit more calmly a little bit more\nintellectually actually it wasn't that\nbig of a difference\nyou know it's just that comparison that\nyou made to the first time\nand i think it's not surprising because\nif you want to get into the flow state\nyou can't compare\nyou can't think about how the last\nstream went you can't expect anything\nyou can't be like oh my god do i have\nproblems like oh my god i don't have\nproblems now what am i going to do if\ni'm talking to dr k if that is the\nthought in your head this conversation\nwill never happen\nyep you gotta go with the flow\nright\nso i think that that this too like in\nthat in that moment i think it was a\nreally good like instance\nof when you have an experience if you\ncreate an expectation about the next\nexperience it will actually make it very\nhard for you to enter this flow state or\nimpossible actually because the flow\nstate is a one-pointedness of the mind\nand if you are trying to fulfill an\nexpectation\nyour mind is not fully in the task\nbecause a small amount of your ram is\nbeing spent comparing to like the last\ntime am i there yet am i there yet am i\nthere yet\nand this is kind of really interesting\nbecause when i teach people meditation\ntheir first like spiritual trippy\npsychedelic experience is actually easy\nto get so when i teach people certain\nkinds of meditation they'll have these\nlike weird spiritual experiences where\nthey'll be like oh my god it was bizarre\ni felt connected to the universe i\nrealized whatever or they like have\nmemories from their past life for like\nweird stuff starts to happen\nand then the first one is like super\neasy because they have no idea it's\ncoming so they can enter the flow state\nin meditation they can attain one\npointedness of the mind and then like\nsomething weird happens in their\nconsciousness\nthe second time is the hardest\nbecause once it happens the first time\nyou sit down to meditate and you're like\ncan't wait let's go let's feel connected\nto the universe and then like it doesn't\nhappen why am i not feeling connected oh\nmy god oh my god it's not working it's\nnot working it's not working so you\ncreate that kind of expectation and then\nit kind of like shatters the flow state\nand then kind of the third thing that i\nwanted to say is we talked about loss of\nego\none-pointedness not being critical right\nso as long as you're being critical of\nyourself it's going to create that\ntension shatter the flow state and the\nlast thing that i kind of want to say\nabout the flow today is like the words\nthat you use to describe it so we talked\nabout channeling right like you're\nchanneling the therapy gecko and on days\nthat you try to be the therapy gecko i\nwould suspect it's harder to be the\ntherapy gecko\nhmm\nactually it's this sort of weird thing\nwhere like uh it's funny you say that\nbecause uh\nsometimes uh uh i i do have like uh like\nlike i like to\nchannel\nthe therapy girl and sometimes i feel\nlike if i'm not making\na uh intentional decision\nto to act in a certain way\nit doesn't happen and then i and then i\nlook back and i'm like\noh i was i didn't i didn't like\ni didn't do that stream in the way that\ni i wanted to i was too like this way\nmaybe like i laughed too much when like\nyou know i i would have rather been you\nknow\nsort of more more stoic or something\nlike that so while there's a huge\ndifference i completely agree with you\nyeah there's a huge difference between\nintention and expectation\nsure\nright so i think that when we talk about\nthe flow state there must absolutely be\ncomplete intention one pointed intention\nall of your intention is to be something\nand this is where things like even my\nlanguage is gonna start to fall apart\nbut like\nintention and expectation are two\ndifferent things because intention is\nabout what you're putting into it\nexpectation is about what you hope to\nget out of it yes yeah yeah right so i\nthink there i think when you try too\nhard to be the therapy gecko you will\nnot actually be the therapy gecko what i\nwould say is when you let yourself\nbecome the therapy gecko\nyou will be the best therapy gecko\nyou have to let it take you for a ride\nyou can't you know turn on the engine\nand just go and tell it where to go you\ngot to let it take you\nwhat do you think about that\ni'll i like that i think that makes a\nlot of sense\nletting\nthat's what this that is that's fun that\nis like meditation where like if you sit\ndown and you're like i'm going to\nbecome the\none with the worlds or whatever it\ndoesn't work but if you sort of let it\nhappen\ni'm trying to i'm trying to like i'm\nthinking about like like last night's\nstream like because i i felt like i i\nwas very much in the flow state and\nacting presenting myself in the way that\num\nyou know i wanted to you know um\nand yeah i i would say that's pretty\naccurate\nso i i and i think even if you go back\nto the early part of our stream today\nand you talk about you know what what\nit's like when i use the word channel\nand you started using these words like\nyour being and alive you know like maybe\nthat was my word but\nthe way you were kind of describing it\nis like\nyou know there's\nsometimes the you know some of the yogis\nand zen masters and stuff will describe\nit as a flowering\nso the reason i i think they use the\nword flowering is because you can't like\nmake a flower bloom\nyou know like you can't like if there's\na bud like you can't peel it apart and\nlike turn it into a flower it's\nsomething that you have to let happen\nright so it's not something you can do\nbut it's something you have to let\nhappen and this is this is a concept\nthat i think is very very like lost in\nour society today because we're all\nabout like metrics and performance and\nlike living up to expectations and\nhaving job descriptions and like you\nknow you know what's your kpi like how\nmany views are you getting how many subs\nare you getting we're all like outcome\noriented so we don't we've forgotten\nsort of as a society how to let things\nbloom\nright how to set everything up how to\nyou know start making content on the\ninternet at 10 but you didn't care about\nyour views and i mean maybe you did but\nyou're focused on making content then\ndoing stand up and then like is all of\nthese factors kind of go together as you\nwater the plant is you give it sunlight\nis you give it the right kind of soil\nand fertilizer eventually something\ngrows and it takes a decade and then you\nsee a flowering it's a happening\nand so what i i'd kind of say is that\nwhen you talk about the flow state this\nis sort of the last concept that i'll\nshare is there's this idea in in yoga\nand in meditation that we each have\nwithin us a piece of divinity\nand that gets kind of confusing because\npeople like what the does that mean like\ndoes that mean i can move out what does\nthat mean\npeople don't know what divinity is\nand so i'd say like instead of trying to\nunderstand divinity\nfrom kind of like an ab like a logical\nway or abstract way\nthere's something within you that once\nyou channel it like everything is just\ngood baby\nit's like you feel alive you produce\nbetter content you feel happier right\nit's not like an abstract because you've\ngot the chair it's like a it's like an\nexperience of happiness\nand it's not even like happiness like\nyou're laughing\nit's not even emotional right because\nthat's the other thing that confuses\npeople about the word happiness is they\ncorrelate happiness with positive\nemotion but in the flow state what it\nreally is is when you're channeling that\ndivinity that's when you produce work\nright so like i think it was the greeks\nthat talked about\ngenius is something that like strikes\nyou right so it's like this thing that\nis not something you aren't a genius you\nchannel genius and so genius is like a\nstate of mind as opposed to a person\nand so this state of flow like makes you\nfeel happy makes you feel alive not on\nan emotional level not now i've got at\nmy big chair level but in that moment\nyou feel present you're not thinking\nabout the future you're not thinking\nabout where things are going you're not\nthinking about metrics you're not\nworried about whether you're doing a\ngood job or bad job and so what i really\ncall that i think like you've got a\ntaste of that which is like what they\njust they use the word divinity because\nthey couldn't come up with what that is\nright so they said that oh each each of\nus has the spark of the divine because\nif you look in you look in that moment\nyou're opie\nright you're performing well you're\nhappier\nyou're like doing a fantastic job and\nthat sounds op so what we're going to\ncall that is the divine\nand then they also went through a series\nof like different practices and stuff to\ncultivate that state to spend more time\nin that state to advance beyond that\nstate into other states and then\neventually you get to something that\nthey called moksha\nor enlightenment which has all of the\nfeatures of the crap that you've already\nbeen describing like loss of ego and\nother things like that which i know you\nsaid you couldn't explain but i think\nyou did a very good job of because i\nthink you actually understand it because\nit sounds like you've lived it\nthat's mushfield interesting\ni said i i this this is making me like\nwhat like when people say that like uh\nyou know\ngod told them to paint a\npicture or something maybe that's like\nthat's their interpretation of\nthat or something it makes a lot of\nsense\ninteresting thing there is\ni'm not so sure that that's the case\nbecause there's a great book by a guy\nnamed\nwilliam james called the varieties of\nreligious experience and some artists\nwere like mentally ill or possibly\npsychotic\nor or maybe they had a spiritual\nexperience\nlike through prayer it's interesting but\nwhat i do find is that that um\nespecially with like the creative like\npeople who i i i work with who make\nmusic and and write and things like that\nthat they really have to like the more\nthey can cultivate that channeling of\ndivinity the more they sort of almost\naccept that i can't control it because a\nbig part of like creative folks is that\nthey set themselves up with the\nexpectation of today i have to write\nlike a blockbuster piece of music and if\nthey\nthat expectation will paralyze them\nwhereas if they go back because their\nfirst blockbuster came without any\nexpectation of being a blockbuster and\nthey made music for the sake of [ __ ]\nmaking music\nyou know and that's what made it a\nblockbuster and then they try to make a\nblockbuster and then sometimes they they\nsucceed because it's procedurally\ngenerated you know highly processed\nkind of algorithmically driven stuff\nit's like netflix is just adding a\nsprinkling of a homosexual sex scene\nsomewhere in all of their shows you know\nso sometimes it's driven like that but\nthen you have like you know the real\nartistry behind certain shows where\npeople are like they're not trying to\nmake a blockbuster they're just trying\nto tell a story or trying to you know\nreally make something genuine\nthat'll make perfect sense anyway i want\nto just acknowledge that i've been\ntalking most of the time\nand just checking with you about how you\nfeel about that like especially over the\nlast half hour or so\noh i think i i think that's that's\nthat's fine i uh i always say um like\nlike i already know what i think about\nthings and i know my so i i don't like\nso i don't talk as much\nyou know especially on like my uh stream\nand stuff\nlike i'm like you know i don't i already\nknow what i think about things you know\nbut i want to hear what you think\nyeah i think what's so i would encourage\nyou to maybe share a little bit more\nlyle because i i think you've happened\nto stumble upon a lot of answers that\npeople are really looking for\num and unless i'm i'm totally misreading\nyou in terms of you know where you are\nbut it sounds to me like you've worked\nreally hard\nfor a long time and it may have looked\nlike non-traditional like heart like\nit's not like you were sitting there and\nreading books right but you were like\n[ __ ] going comedy clubs at the age of\n16.\nand having like i see i appreciate you\nsaying that because i i uh\nyou know i i i don't read a lot of books\nbut uh you know i do think a lot about\nthings like you know\nhow to be yourself and accept discomfort\nand all that and i'm not like uh\nit's funny that because you know i i do\nfeel like that was a transformative\nmoment that i had when i was 16 and the\nrock club and everything and um\nand and and yet weirdly it doesn't like\nlike like that the whole thing of like\nthere is no there\nlike\nyou know i didn't at 16\nembrace discomfort and then never feel\ndiscomfort ever again like you know i i\nstill have times all the time where i'm\nlike\nyou know uncomfortable and i have to\njust like think of\ni i feel like i've developed like good\nconcepts for myself of like being\nyourself and embracing discomfort but\nthey're they're just like concepts that\ni am like following not so much that i\nhave mastered in any way shape or form\nthey're just like they're they're like\nthey drive me but i i i'm i'm still\nyou know on the on the path to getting\nbetter\nhandles on them\nyeah i think that makes a lot of sense\nso i think part of the reason that you\nunderstand so much is because you\nhaven't read a whole lot\nwhat does that mean\nexactly what it said so so understanding\nso in the the yogis sort of realize that\nthere are two kinds of knowledge there's\nvidya which is information which is\nobjective and which is transmissible\nand then there's understanding\nwhich is subjective not transmissible\nand in in western society we trend tend\nto rate vidya\nas more than understanding or nyan which\nis the other word video is the the\ninformation one yeah so we tend to value\ninformation over understanding and i\nknow that sounds kind of weird\nbut we want we want we value objectivity\nover subjectivity but you can\nunderstanding is\nby definition like subjective right it's\nnot yeah like it's just how you\nunderstand something right there has to\nbe a subject for understanding there\ndoes not have to be a subject for\ninformation yeah\nyeah\nand and so i think what you've managed\nto do is like a lot of the things that\nyou're cut like you're stumbling upon\nthe same way that they have stumbled\nupon for like you know and they kind of\ncame to these conclusions like oh\nactually it's important to accept your\nnegative emotions it's important to\nembrace those difficult things and then\nthere's sort of this idea i'm glad you\nshared this that you know all the video\nfolks who hear the story of you and\nthey're like oh i need to have my\ntransformational moment in the bathroom\nand then i'll be good then life will be\neasy then i'll live my life with\nconfidence and i'll crush it and it's\nlike no no no you're still gonna\nstruggle with discomfort you just\nit doesn't actually make it objectively\nany better it makes it subjectively\nbetter\nsure yeah that makes sense um\nyeah that's that that uh that like\ninformation over understanding thing i i\nthink it's i think it's really true like\nuh\ni don't know i don't i don't have like\nas much of a handle of like current\nevents as as a lot of people do um and i\nfeel like sort of uh\nyou know i guess in the way that the\ninternet works like everyone's talking\nabout a different thing every five\nseconds and it's like and i know\nsometimes i look at that i'm like but\nthere's that's not as interesting to me\nas like all the problems and [ __ ]\nthat's you know people have been dealing\nwith for for thousands and thousands of\nyears that i don't really see a whole\nlot of people uh\nyou know talking about you know i don't\ntalk about the current events or stuff\nlike that on on on my stream but like i\nknow that that's\nsort of like a big driving thing in uh\nin twitch and internet culture is like\nyou know talking about like oh here's\nwhat happens like in the news or here's\nlike this youtuber that's feuding with\nthis youtuber or something like that and\nuh i'm i'm very anti that and i'm like\nyou know\ni like i like more sort of like uh uh\ntimeless or or broad concepts you know i\nlike talking about that more than that\nkind of stuff i don't know what i just\nsaid is related to anything that we were\ntalking about just now but uh that's how\ni think about stuff\nyeah so here's kind of what i heard i\nheard that\num\nyou know you like to focus not so much\non like information but on like\nunderstanding related stuff right so not\nlike what's going on and just\npropagating and sharing like oh this is\ngoing on here there this is kind of like\nfactual sort of objective kind of like\nstuff\num and i i'm not surprised and what i\nsaid what i meant by you know i think\nit's because you don't have information\nthat you have understanding it's because\nyou don't read a lot that you understand\nso much because i think what happens is\nwhen people read something\nthey form an idea of it which can\nsometimes actually get in the way of\nunderstanding and the best example i can\nthink of is when people talk about sex\nso like i remember when i was like 13\nand my friends and i were like all\ntalking about sex and how amazing it is\nand like you know you'll see like\neveryone talking about sex and different\nyou know communities and stuff and then\nlike people will form notions of\nsexuality or virginity or like what it's\nsupposed to be like or whatever and then\nwhen when you actually start you know\nhaving sex like\nsome of those preconceived notions that\nyou may get from watching pornography or\nhaving conversations with people is like\ncan actually get in the way of you\nunderstanding and appreciating the\nexperience for what it is\nand once you start having sex and you\nkind of become comfortable with it and\nhopefully you have\nyou know a partner or more that that can\nyou guys can kind of explore things and\ndiscover it kind of your own way then\nyou have your own understanding of it\nwhich may be like completely foreign to\nwhat you see in the pornos\nbut like the people in the pornos\nmay have lots of information about it\nright like they have all this external\nunderstanding\nand oftentimes we see this a lot in\nspirituality too like sometimes i'll get\npeople who are like read a bunch of\nbooks on spirituality and they'll say\nthings like oh i'm gonna like live in\nthe moment so living in the moment means\ni get to put my dick wherever i want to\nwhen i feel like it and if if my\ngirlfriend has a problem with that well\nthat's just her being full of attachment\nand she needs to be free and like\nembrace her pain and\nbecause if she embraced her pain and\nembraced her discomfort it wouldn't be a\nproblem for her so like i'm going to\ncontinue putting my dick wherever she\nwants to wherever i want to and then if\nshe has a problem with it i'm living in\nthe moment i'm living in the present i'm\nbeing happy i'm being me\nand she's the one who's not un able to\nembrace\nher\ndiscomfort\nso they'll like take all these concepts\nand like\nsort of use them as rationalization or\njustification\nto propagate whatever negativity they're\npropagating\nand so i think on the other hand you've\njust discovered on your own so like you\nactually have sort of a like an\nuntouched understanding of things which\nis great\ni'm not surprised that\nyour stream is\nsuccessful well i appreciate that it's\nuh i i started talking about this\nearlier where it's like you know when\nyou're talking about the the the reading\nversus the sort of something on the\nthings of my own it's like uh\nyou know sometimes i like think about\n[ __ ] and i'll be like uh and if you\ndon't if like if you read something like\nif something is presented to you within\nthe binds of a book or like it's being\nsaid by some you know guy on the\ninternet who has a bunch of followers or\nsomething it's like it's it's it's very\nit's you you can accept it as more valid\nthan a thought that you stumble upon on\nyour own\nso you know it it's uh\nit's difficult to like val like validate\nyour own\nthoughts\nyou know as opposed to your own like\nthoughts and understandings as opposed\nto like information that is presented to\nyou even though you know all information\njust comes from just some other [ __ ]\nperson who understood it on their own\nyou know accord\nwell i think if you really tunnel down\nthere there's like a nuance there that's\npretty important which is that you keep\non using the words information and\nunderstanding\nso information can be validated\nunderstanding cannot\nbut you can sort of validate it\ninternally\nbut when that person is actually\npropagating is information and you\nshouldn't compare your their information\nto your understanding\nultimately i think the the reason i\nshare information is to catalyze\npeople's understanding\nso and nothing i've said today is\ncorrect it's just a framework\nright so like i i really appreciated a\nlot of what you said and i just sort of\ntied it into things that i've read\nbecause i thought it was like it's a\nreally cool example of like you know\nlast time i checked you haven't spent\nyou know years studying religious texts\nso it's really awesome and it's actually\nquite validating for me\nto hear someone who's not formally\ntrained in any of this stuff start to\ndescribe these experiences because\nthat's like oh wow like this is really\ncool this person has not been polluted\nby religious study and yet\nthey are coming up with these\nconclusions so this actually gives me\nmore faith in what i've read because it\nsounds like you kind of figured this\nstuff out on your own which means that\nit's more likely to be true because\nanything that's true someone should be\nable to figure out on their own\ni love that that's that's pretty wild\nyeah i don't know what you were\nexpecting today and i apologize if i you\nknow dominated the conversation oh oh no\ni expected absolutely nothing i am\nactually to be honest i'm like uh you\nknow\nyou know i i\nwhen you sort of brought up the fact\nlike oh we don't have to like go in and\nlike find it because i guess i wasn't\nexpecting to like\ntry to find a problem with me yeah or\nanything because i i don't think i have\nlike anything that's sort of glaring so\ni'm glad that we've been able to have uh\na very great conversation without uh you\nknow having to do that\nyeah\ni mean i i think one of my teachers once\ntold me that you know you should have\nthe conversation in the room that you\nneed to have\nand that's not always a conversation\nabout negative emotions\nright it's like\nour purpose here is to educate and\nsometimes that education involves the\nexploration of people's problems and\nsometimes like today i think it involves\nthe exploration of their successes\nthat's awesome\nany questions for me i feel like i i'm\nkind of\ni got out what i wanted what i felt was\nappropriate\num cool i don't really have much else to\nsay but i'm happy to continue talking\nfor a little bit longer if you have\nthoughts or questions that you want to\nshare\nuh lots of questions that i want to\nshare um\ni don't know i guess\nnothing nothing nothing nothing strikes\nto mind\noff the bet\nso is there anything from the chat i\ndon't know how often you\ncheck so i i i think it's now is a great\ntime to check in with chat\nsure\ni usually try to once again to not break\nthe flow state i try to steer clear of\nchat while i'm interviewing people yeah\nthat's that's that's another thing too\nis like uh i i i don't look at chat when\ni'm like on the i used to look a chat\nwhile i was on the phone with people and\nthen like the chats the way that the\nchat would like make judgments about the\nperson that i'm talking to the phone on\nwould like get into my head and i hated\nthat because i wanted to form my own\nyou know relationship with the person on\nthe phone so i stopped doing that\ncan the gecko levitate\ncan i levitate\num\nthere's price for that\nso so there's a little bit of context\nthere lyle\nin that context is yesterday we were\njust talking a little bit about\nmeditation and there's an old text on\nmeditation that talks about how to\nlevitate\num\nand so it's just it's actually like\nconsidered by most scholars to be the\nmost important text\nlike historically about meditation or\nyoga and and there's an entire chapter\nin there about developing supernatural\npowers\nyou know anyone that can levitate\num i'm gonna decline to answer that\nquestion\num\nis that okay of course\nokay\num so someone's asking how do you go\nabout getting rid of expectations that\nprevent the flow state\nhow do i go about getting rid of\nexpectations that prevent the flow\nstates\ni don't know i i think i've recently\ni've i've tried to make a better um\ngo at like recognizing those and just\ndeciding to\nnot give a [ __ ] about them like um\nlike i was like recently like you know\nlike before i go on a stream i'll just\nbe like i i don't i don't care how many\npeople are watching i don't care about\nthis i don't care about that i don't\ncare about this but i don't care about\nthat all i care about like i actually\nsort of have a little\ni you could call it a mental ritual of\nlike you know looking at myself in the\nmirror and going all i'm going to focus\non\nis my conversation with the person that\ni'm talking to on the phone\num\nand not any like you know looking at\nview or chat or anything like that\num\n[Music]\nthat's how i do it with this in this\nparticular case but uh\nthat's that's a great answer um\nso i i just to kind of add one or two\nkind of thoughts onto that one is i\nthink that\nso if you listen to lyle he says he has\na ritual right so the subtle thing there\nis that i think this is practiced\nso like the more time so the first time\nthey've been in the bathroom when you\nwere 16\nbut\nwhat i'm hearing is that you actually\nhave like a cognitive process that's\nalmost like working out\nwhere you're like using your cognitive\nmuscles to let go of that expectation\num yeah\nso i'd say for people who are struggling\nlike maybe start with or do you actually\nlook in the mirror like do you literally\nlook in the mirror\nsometimes i literally look in the mirror\nif if there's a mirror um\nwhat do you say to yourself\ni just say to myself like i don't think\nlike you know i i don't i don't have\nlike a like a mantra or anything like\nthat but i just sort of generally think\nto myself like you know don't worry\nabout views don't worry about like you\nknow\nchat or don't worry about job or like\nhow you're being don't worry about like\nanything other than\ntrying to have uh you know a good\nconversation\num and it is it is uh\nit's it's weird getting because like\nit's weird getting asked about like how\nto rid myself negative expectations for\ntwo reasons one is that i totally\ni i i never ever ever want to present\nmyself as like\nan expert on anything because everything\nthat like like getting like you know\ngetting rid of negative expectations\nlike not negative but just getting rid\nof expectations something like i'm\ntrying to do i present it like like that\nconcept i present is like uh\nsomething that i'm trying to do not\nsomething that i've like mastered or\nanything like that uh\nbut then two like uh\nwhat i have like any any work that i\nhave done\non that uh is very much just like\nputting in like reps of it i think\nwhat's wrong with presenting yourself as\nan expert\nwhat does that mean to present yourself\nas an expert\nare you presenting yourself as an expert\ni don't know i just like\ni this see this is a sort of a thing\nthat i get into on my stream maybe now\nwe could talk about like the whole uh\nthing of um\nyou know i don't really i know the show\nis called therapy gecko\nand it is like\nit's i don't i don't like calling it an\nadvice show for that particular reason\nthat i feel like to have an advice show\nyou inherently have to present yourself\nas like\ni know things ask me for advice because\ni will give you the answer because i\nknow\nyou know and i hate doing that um\ni guess what's wrong with that um\ni don't know it it it feels like a\ndisingenuous way to present myself i\nguess\ni think that makes a lot of sense so i\nthink disingenually presenting yourself\nas an expert is probably not a good idea\nand at the same time lyle i would\nencourage you that you know if someone\nasks you a question\nyeah that you know when you give your\nanswer you can give it as not an expert\nor you can give it\nlateral to the axis of expert\nright you can just give your answer\nand let it be what it is and let them\njust share what you have to share\nyou know maybe that's something you know\ni actually kind of like you know i have\na thing with is like how do i\nhow do i like\nyou know i have all these people like\nyou know who will sometimes like call me\nand ask me for advice\nand i'm like how do i balance the fact\nthat like maybe i have an idea of\nsomething i want to tell them\nbut i don't want to present it as the\ngolden answer but then like you know if\nif i'm gonna be like you know if people\nare gonna ask me stuff like i i should i\nshould present myself\ni should answer things confidently and\nnot like give up on my thoughts because\nthey're not validated but the same hand\nlike you know on on the same thing it's\nlike i don't\ni don't like to feel like i know\nanything you know it's that whole thing\nof like you know all i know is that no\nnothing and all that uh\nlike\ni think that's a problem so that's your\nego interesting\nokay so your ego is uncomfortable\nwith the idea of presenting yourself as\nsomeone who knows things\nbut i would say that you are neither\nsomeone who knows things or someone who\ndoesn't know things you just are what\nyou are\nyeah and i i think you've actually done\nthis really well because i think that\ni think you should so i would encourage\nyou to just step away from all that crap\nand just share when people call in just\ngive them whatever is inside\nright channel that get like just share\nwhatever you've got down there because i\nthink there's a reason why people are\ncalling you and by the way i don't know\nif you know this but\nwearing a gecko costume and painting\nyour face green i think makes it pretty\nclear to people that they're talking to\nsomeone who's like\nthey're talking to a guy who dresses up\nas a [ __ ] gecko\ni i'm not afraid of i'm not afraid of\ni'm not afraid of accidentally present\ni'm not afraid of accidentally\naccidentally presenting myself as\nliterally a professional i think\neveryone who calls me yeah knows that\ni'm not like actually a real thing but\nit's more like in the\nbut but\nwhat i'm saying is like i think you you\nclearly are presenting yourself is just\nyou so just give them you\nand if you if you you don't you don't\nhave to offer a disclaimer that i'm not\nof an expert on this\ni mean just look at you bro\nright like i don't i think you go out of\nyour way sure to make it clear to people\nthat you're just a dude in a gecko\ncostume which paradoxically\ni think like the more that you embrace\nthat authenticity the closer to the\ndivinity that you get and don't let\nyourself edit what you're about to say\nbecause of the concern that you could\ncome across as an expert because that's\ngoing to shatter the flow state\nso if someone calls\ninto a show on twitch where there's a\nguy who's dressed up in a green gecko\ncostume\ni don't think you have to worry about\nlike overselling your qualifications i\nthink you just give them what they're\ncalling this in for\nbecause it's good [ __ ]\nthere's kind of another thing of like\nand i and i i think i've been able to\nrecognize the fact that like you know if\npeople didn't want\nmy whatever on whatever they wouldn't\nhave called in but then there's a thing\nwhere like\ni think\nif if i okay i feel like if i can give\ngood advice on something you know\nthere's this expectation i could give\ngood advice on anything like like like\nif i have an 18 year old college student\ncall in and go\nhow do i make friends in college i feel\nlike i could actually\nreally like talk with that guy and like\ngive some you know what i what i would\nfeel is good advice but then if someone\ncalls in is like\nuh i'm 38 years old and i'm about to be\na mother for the first time do you have\nany advice on that no\ni don't and i want to be comfortable\nwith the ability to be like\nyeah for that specific thing i i i have\nnothing to say about that\nyou know\num so we can talk because\nthat is that is what i say yeah\ni think that's beautiful\nso i think you could say i'm i'm a 22 23\nyear old 22 year old dude\nyeah in a gecko costume\nand unfortunately i don't know how to\nadvise you about being a 38 year old\nmother for the first time\nbut i'd love to talk to you for a few\nminutes\nyou know and this is where you can toss\nout you know question like what are you\nafraid of\nwhat are you concerned about\nthat's what i that's what i kind of do\nif i get into a situation like that is\nlike i'll just ask them questions and\nnot like\ntry to\ngive advice or anything just sort of\nbeautiful\ni've been told um\nsometimes i'll get someone like who's\nlike a real therapist and this is kind\nof sort of what happened with this where\nit's like someone who's a real therapist\nwould be like hey you might not know\nthis but what you're doing is like this\nthing called motivational interviewing\nand then i'll like go and look at that\nand i'll be like oh that's kind of\ninteresting so that's like what i'll\nlike uh just you know\nask questions instead of trying to give\nadvice or anything like that\nyeah so i i think something you know\nweird has happened if you look at the\nresearch on therapy\nso people will will do studies and\nthey'll look at like\ndifferent kinds of therapies so you'll\nhave like different kinds of therapy\nlike very\ndrastically different you'll have\nmindfulness-based therapies you'll have\ncognitive behavioral therapy you'll have\npsychoanalysis\nand like those are like very different\none is like worksheets and homework and\nstuff like that and the other one is\nlike laying down on the couch where dude\nsits behind you and doesn't a woman sits\nbehind you doesn't say anything for\nfour hours a week right those are very\ndifferent like worksheets and homework\nand so people were kind of curious\nbecause if you look at most of the\ntherapies\nthey tend to have comparable outcomes so\nif i have depression\nand this is sort of an over\ngeneralization and i go see a\npsychoanalyst for four hours a week or i\ngo see a cvt therapist for one hour a\nweek it turns out that generally\nspeaking i get the same amount of batter\nand so then people got really confused\nbecause they're like which kind of\ntherapy is best\nturns out that they're all comparable\nand then people are like how the hell\ndoes that work because they're doing\nsuch drastically different things\nand then what they sort of discovered is\nthat\nthey did something called common factors\nresearch and what they sort of realized\nis that like if you look at what is\nresponsible for the improvement it isn't\na particular modality it's a set of what\nthey call common factors that are\nuniversal to all therapy\nso one of those things is for example\nlike being a good listener\nand so then the really interesting thing\nis that if you look at some of those\ncommon factors of of therapy what you\ndiscover is that there are a lot of\nother situations where those common\nfactors apply right so like you don't\nhave to be a therapist to be a good\nlistener\nyou don't have to be a therapist to like\nyou know answer questions and provide\nadvice and try to help people understand\nthemselves we have a lot of different\nprofessions and situations you do it\nwith your friends\nbartenders are famous for doing this\nstuff right like you go and you talk to\nyour bartender and your bartender is\nlike actually like a trained listener\nit's like part of their job\nyou know sometimes in religious\nprofessions and things like that you'll\nget you know folks who are like you know\nwill offer counsel and advice and will\nask like important questions and stuff\nlike that there's also the field of\ncoaching which is emerging and one of\nthe core competencies of coaching is\nwhat they call asking powerful questions\nand so i'm not surprised that you know\nwhat you were doing has been described\nin therapy but i don't know that that i\nmean i think that long before there was\ntherapy people were asking\nquestions of each other\nyes that were like impactful and help\npeople were like emotionally supporting\nthemselves like each other like\nlong before there was therapy\nand so now you have like narrative\ntherapy and art therapy like people were\n[ __ ] painting on in caves for like\nthousands of years and chances are it\nwas therapeutic so it's kind of like i\nthink you got to be careful when it\ncomes to therapy because i'm not\nsurprised that people are saying hey\nyou're doing something called\nmotivational interviewing like how do\npeople come up with motivational\ninterviewing\nit's because they observed the things\nthat regular humans do that like seemed\nto help motivate people\nand they kind of like figured that out\nand then they codified it and formalized\nit and figured out where the money is\nand things like that but i'm not\nsurprised at all that you know\nthe irony of you calling yourself a\ntherapist and winding up doing something\nthat looks a lot like therapy but i\nthink that's more just because it's not\nthat it's therapy it's just that there's\na lot of basic human stuff that for some\nreason therapy has seemed to like claim\nyeah\ni think we also see this in things like\nalcoholics anonymous where like you know\npeople do a lot of things that inter\nthey do a lot of interventions with each\nother they're not trained in therapy but\nthey do lead to positive clinical\noutcomes in addiction improvement and\nthey like emotionally support each other\nand they're there for each other but\nthat doesn't mean that they're doing\ntherapy it just means they're being\nemotionally supportive\nbut somewhere along the way i think that\nthat definition got kind of muddled\nbut anyway it's just because i one of\nthe big things that i like if um and\nagain i don't i i hate the idea of like\ncentering um my\nlike\ni don't i don't like referring to it as\nan advice show it's more of like a i'd\ncall it a chat\nshow more than advice but um\ntypically like if someone ever does come\nto me with like something that i i feel\nlike is absolutely 100 above you know my\npay grade uh the question i'll ask them\nis like\ndo you have a real therapist and what\ndid they say about this when you\ntold them i've always wondered like what\nlike uh\nyou know\nhow does how does a like like sometimes\npeople come to me thinks i'm like i have\nno idea\nhow the hell to respond to this in any\nway shape or form and i'm like what what\nwhat do you learn in like\npsychology\nschool or whatever that like teaches you\nhow to like respond to these\nthings you know\nso i'd say there are like two things\nthat you learn\none is like if you look at the\ncurriculum right so if you look at\ncurriculums for\ntherapy\nso if you become like i'm a medical\ndoctor so that the curriculum that i\nwent to with through was like psychiatry\nwhich is like the practice of medicine\nthat is focused on\npathology relating to the mind\nright so we are i'm a medical doctor\nwhich means that i treat patients who\nhave something busted and so a\ncardiologist will work with people whose\nheart is messed up you know an\nendocrinologist will work with people\nlike diabetes a pediatrician will work\nwith children i will work with people\nwho have trouble with their mind so we\nget training in pathology so we'll get\ntraining in like bipolar disorder major\ndepressive disorder generalized anxiety\ndisorder and then people get a little\nbit confused because remember that\nsadness and depression and anxiety are\nall normal human experiences what do we\nget trained in we get trained in the\npathological version of those right so\nwhen anxiety reaches a particular\nthreshold where it in interferes with\nyour ability to function as a human\nbeing\nthen you get diagnosed with a disorder\nso we see those people\nso that's kind of what our formal\ntraining is in right so it's like mostly\nin pathology and stuff like that\nthen the other thing that i'd say you\nlearn which is not necessarily something\nthat you get trained in\nbut you know when you become a\npsychiatrist or a therapist when you do\nclinical work you just get experience\nsitting with people who are going\nthrough really bad [ __ ]\nyeah\nand and i think that like you know\nthat's not really a formal part of your\ntraining like it's not like there's a\nclass for you know how to deal with\npeople whose life is just awful\nnow you can diagnose with them with\ntrauma or whatever but like you know one\nof my\none of the best nurses that i worked\nwith\nshe would sometimes say she was an er\nnurse and she would i ask her you know\nwhat what is the patient in room 12 like\nwhat's going on with them and then she\nhad this acronym sls which is [ __ ] life\nsyndrome\nand you can call it like some kind of\nyou know depression or bipolar disorder\nor whatever but like we just sometimes\nget these kids in the emergency room\nlike their 17 year old kid has been like\nin foster care for 12 years sexually\nabused at the age of four\nyou know just like really terrible stuff\nhas behavioral problems has substance\nuse problems\nyou know has like it went to juvie for a\nyear and like what's the kid's problem\nthe kid's problem is that they had a\n[ __ ] life\nlike it's not like they're ill like sure\nthey have manifestations of illness and\nthey have trouble like you know\nfollowing rules and like they have\nintermittent explosive kind of problems\nbut the problem is like they've just had\nlike\nthey've got a really crappy spawn you\nknow that's the real problem if you want\nto blame something it's just like the\ncircumstances of their [ __ ] life it's\nnot really their fault\nand so the other thing that i think you\nlearn as a clinician is when you you\nknow when you work in hospitals for four\nyears and you sit with those kinds of\npeople and you like talk to them and you\nget to know them\nit allows you to be able to like handle\nand sit with things that as you call it\nor above your pay grade because you just\nbecause what else are you going to do\nlike you're the one who's on call that\nkid is there you've got to go in and try\nto help them\nand so you just show up and you kind of\ndo the best that you can and i think a\nlot of it is really just trial by fire\nand\nyou know i'd say that\nthe most important thing that i learned\nwith kids with [ __ ] life syndrome is not\nto be a clinician it's to be a human\nand that's what they need more than\nanything else\ninteresting i like that\nand i think that you're fully qualified\nto do you can be human sure sure sure\neven though you're a gecko\num\nno it's it's uh it's it's we're actually\nlike i kind of feel that like uh you\nknow the more that uh i i do this um and\ni i i try to invite people to like um\nthat it's it's you know if\ni i feel like i'm trying to create a\nspace where that you know it's more\nlighthearted than not uh\nso but you know um\ni think the more that uh i've gotten uh\na call that i don't know how to respond\nto the better i've gotten with dealing\nwith with that\num\nyeah like uh like i did i did i do like\nlive shows every once in a while i\nstarted i've been redoing that recently\nand um i always like i had this\nimpression that uh people who\nyou know uh i've started like uh the\nfirst half i'll like take phone calls\nand they're gonna bring people up from\nthe audience and when people come up\nfrom the audience i have this like\nexpectation that uh the the subject\nmatter that they will want to talk about\nis a little bit more lighthearted than\nnot and i had this guy come on at one of\nthe live shows who like got really like\nsort of serious and deep\nwith me about um like his\nhis um\nwife like recently opened up their\nmarriage and uh like he wasn't able to\num like\nyou know find other people to have sex\nwith but she was and that was making him\ninsecure and like i and and uh he was\nlike really going off and i was not\nexpecting this\nwhatsoever but um\nweirdly i didn't\ni don't know i didn't feel like nervous\nor like oh [ __ ] what the [ __ ] am i gonna\ndo i just kind of like let him\ntalk\nuh\nand sat in that moment\num\nand it and i think it ended up turning\nout okay but uh\nyeah i don't know i i i i\ni'm trying to figure out how to deal\nwith stuff like that when it occurs and\ni've i've found that i just sort of uh\nsit in it and let them let them keep\ntalking if i don't have anything to say\nthat's typically what i do if i don't\nhave anything to say is i just\nlet them know yeah so i think that\nthat's\nyou know\nsounds very\ntherapeutic to me\ndoesn't mean that it's therapy right\nlike but\ni think you know just giving human\nbeings like just being human first and\nforemost\nis what it sounds like like that person\njust needs you to be human in the gecko\ncostume\nand then secondly you know if you really\nwant to know how to you know help people\nand and\nreally want to like\nyou know in a sense get get better in a\nparticular dimension of what you do\nbecause i think you're quite good and\nyou know how to get better what you do\nyou can also you know become a therapist\nif you really feel like it right so like\nyou can go through those those kinds of\nthose kinds of trainings and really\nlearn\nin a guided fashion i'm not recommending\nit i'm just saying like that's one of\nthe options\nsure i you know people tell me that all\nthe time and i always i'm like i would\nnever want to be a therapist in my\nentire life i think that would be uh\nbecause i don't\nyou know thing things like what i just\ndescribed like happen\nbut i i'd prefer if they stayed\nyou know in the ratio of like 10\nor less of the uh yeah overall i i i you\nknow\ni like being you know like uh i like i i\nyou know i do twitch to like you know\nentertain and community and stuff not\nnecessarily um\ni want to do like you know be be a\nbe a therapist\ntrue or anything like that but uh\nyeah i don't know i think that would be\nthat would be hard maybe too hard i\nthink it makes sense man i think it\nsounds to me like what you enjoy doing\nis being an entertainer\nyou like being kind of funny and\navailable to people but just because\nyou're an entertainer doesn't mean that\nyou can't help people\nand as some people said have said in the\npast laughter is the best medicine for\nsure for sure\nso i think sometimes you get some heavy\nstuff i think that just speaks to\nthe atmosphere that you create in\npeople's comfort\nin terms of coming on and being able to\nshare that and like knowing that i know\nit sounds kind of weird but if they if i\ncan imagine how much courage and shame\nthat person must have been feeling\nthen they kind of came on\nand also like to know that\ni'm gonna go up and talk to a dude in a\ngecko costume and no one is going to\nlaugh at me\nlike that's quite the achievement in\nterms of the atmosphere you've created\nthe one one actually\nprobably\namong the biggest problems that i have\nwith the stream is\ni'm really is is is balancing out the\nthe atmosphere in a way because i i i\nwant to like reserve the right to like\nyou know [ __ ] around and like you know\nnot be a jerk to callers but like you\nknow be whatever little gecko character\nyou know but but also reserve like like\na very lighthearted energy but then also\nlike you know\nreserve all the other stuff and like\nreally trying to find that balance has\nactually been\npretty sort of difficult\ni think i can imagine\nso i think i think lyle i encourage you\nto keep trying man because i think that\nwhat we're seeing is that\nhow can i say this\ni feel like the the line between\nentertainment and therapy\nis\nnarrowing so i think like like i know it\nsounds kind of weird but like\ntherapy used to be therapy is the place\nthat we used to contain all of the bad\nstuff in life and entertainment used to\nbe the way that we\nlike the place where we keep all the\ngood stuff in life\nand i i don't know if you've uh seen or\nheard you know inside by bo burnham\nbut but\ni think like that's a prime example of\nhim like\nin a very like entertaining and comedic\nway like offering a lot of really\nawesome\ninsight and even support to people who\nare like really really struggling\nand and so i think striking that balance\nbetween like being a place where people\ncan come and laugh but also like people\ncan come and like\nsay some heavy [ __ ] and we can all kind\nof laugh about it like together\nlike that's increasingly important\nbecause i think it's these weird kinds\nof interventions\nthat we really need like into mental\nhealth arena which are not just\ntreatment it's sort of like you look at\nphysical health you know we have\nnutrition we have exercise all of those\nthings improve cardiovascular health but\nare not medicine\nthe problem is that it when it comes to\nlike mental health like we don't really\nhave\nthose well-developed societal like\nsupport structures which i think\nsometimes you'll see people like you\nknow comedians and stuff like that i\nthink dave chappelle actually does a\ndecent job of this too where he you know\ntalks about like toxicity and like\nthings like that sometimes we'll have\nyou know folks that are a little bit\nmore\num\n[Music]\nyou know like i think jordan peterson's\nanother i know he's a divisive figure\nbut i think he's like a good example of\nsomeone who's like talking about mental\nhealth without it being treatment\nand so i think you being able to strike\nthat balance between like heavy and\ncomedic is actually like really\nimportant societally\nit's what we hear a lot on twitch is\nthat you know a lot of streamers are\nthere for like mental health support for\ntheir communities\nsure because\nyou know there's nowhere else to get it\nlike we're not getting enough of\nwhatever that emotional nutrition is so\nwe got to get it from a dude in a green\ngecko costume\nhere i guess i have this fear of like uh\nyou know i if if i if i ever like you\nknow my stream just becomes\nyou know heavy calls and like\ni i wouldn't want to do it anymore sure\nyou know if it was like\njust\nthat you know i i'd like to\ni don't know it's been it's been a\nreally hard uh sort of sort of balance\nof\nthose um\nthose things but um i i totally see what\nyou're saying i think uh\ni think it's it's a good\nyeah he wants to to learn how to strike\nmakes sense man\nlisten i gotta get going um for sure\nkind of last thoughts or questions\nbefore we wrap up\nuh\nno i think we're we're good thank you so\nmuch for having me this was this was\ngood yeah man i really loved it so two\nor three kind of final points one is i\nnormally teach meditation at the end of\nthe stream but i'm not teaching because\ni'm sick\nand my teachers have told me not to\ninstruct in meditation when i'm ill so i\napologize for that you know if you're\ninterested in learning something down\nthe road um let us know you should get\nan acc access to um\ndr k's guide to mental health because\nyou're a guest on the stream\nand there's one video in particular if\nyou're curious about there's a video on\nvidya and nyan which is sort of that\ninformation understanding thing that we\nkind of talked a little bit about\nbut there's also some stuff about kind\nof like confidence and not sort of like\ndeveloping the flow state and stuff like\nthat a lot of things that we talked\nabout there i would check out the\nmeditation portion of the guide because\nnot as directly as we talked about it\nhere but a lot of those concepts i think\nif you're curious about there's more\ninformation there are particular\npractices and stuff like that so i\napologize that i can't teach you today\nand the second thing is do you want to\nlet people know where they can find you\nwe posted your info at the beginning\nyeah absolutely\nuh i'm on\ni'm on uh twitch.tv slash lyle forever\nl-y-l-e-f-o-r-e-v-e-r and i'm also on uh\nyoutube\nuh youtube.com lyle forever i have a\npodcast
