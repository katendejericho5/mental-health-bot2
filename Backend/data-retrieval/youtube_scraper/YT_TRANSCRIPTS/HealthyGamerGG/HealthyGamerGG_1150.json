    "transcript": "and then what happens when you go\nlooking for a big solution\nyou never find it right there you are\nlooking for the magic bullet that's\ngoing to transform your\nyour mind and then you'll be a\ndisciplined person and you will be like\none of those people\nit'll be a personality transformation so\nthis is why people stay stuck\nso you have to experiment not all big\nproblems require big solutions\ni've noticed that there are a lot of\npeople in this community who have sort\nof these cycles\nof like boom and bust when it comes to\nmotivation\nso there's a lot of people myself\nincluded who like you know you'll wake\nup one day and something weird will\nhappen and you'll be like highly\nmotivated\nand then you try to you know you work\nreally hard and then there's like this\nthought in the back of your mind like oh\nmy god like when is this gonna end i\nknow it's gonna end and then you're like\nmotivated for a week and then like\nit falls apart and then you're kind of\nlike you let things kind of\nfail and you don't follow up with stuff\nand things like that\nand then you're kind of like you got a\nweek or two of like you're in a gray\nzone where you're like you know not\nreally\nfeeling it and then you feel ashamed of\nyourself and all this kind of stuff and\nthen eventually like you wake up and\nyour motivation comes back\nand then like you know then you you kind\nof go back to it so there's almost this\ncycle\nof success in failure and if we want to\nunderstand the cycle of success and\nfailure we have to take a slightly\ndifferent perspective on emotion\non motivation that i think actually\nwestern science\nis sort of missing out a little bit on\nand not to say that it you know misses\nout on it entirely but if we kind of\nlook at western perspectives on\nmotivation\nright so for example we have a very\nstrongly supported model of personality\ncalled the five factor model and the\nfive factor model has\nthis attribute called conscientiousness\nand what conscientiousness is\nessentially like your ability to like\ncomplete tasks over a period of time\nso if you look at median income and\nworldly success\nit's correlated with high\nconscientiousness so the people who have\na personality trait\nof high conscientiousness or people that\nwe call\nlike disciplined right and those are the\npeople that like are lucky\nbecause their personality is more\noriented towards being conscientious and\ndisciplined and organized\nand they're the ones who can wake up at\n7 00 am every day and exercise before\nthey go to work and\nthey apply to promotions on time and\nthey like you know\nkeep their resumes up to date like\nthey're very consistent and\nconscientious focused\nand so so in the west we sort of think\nabout and we can even see it in our\nlanguage\nso the way that our science is sort of\nstructured is to sort of look at\nmotivation or discipline or\nconscientiousness is a trait\nright it's an aspect of who you are it's\npart of your personality\nand while personality can certainly\nchange over time it's not like a\ntemporary thing\nso the word trait refers to something\nthat is like kind of a permanent part of\nyou\nand then they're also states so a state\nis something that is inherently\nfluctuating so for example states of\nconsciousness\nthere's like being conscious there's\nbeing asleep there's\nan uh like fever is another example of a\nstate right being sick\nis a state it's not a trait it's not a\npart of who you are\nit's something that fluctuates within\nyou and when i\nhear people talk about motivation\npeople i've sort of noticed that there's\na bias of talking about it like a trait\nright so there's\ntwo types of people there's lazy people\nand they're disciplined people there are\nunmotivated people\nand they're motivated people so this is\nsort of like trait like dialogue\nand our science sort of supports this\nkind of hypothesis or bias right where\nwe sort of like have five factor\nanalysis and we sort of like look at\nthat and we say okay like there is\nactually like a conscientiousness trait\nto your personality and it's kind of\ninborn and it's relatively constant so\nit sort of makes sense it's scientific\nthat you know people are disciplined and\npeople are lazy\nbut if you really look at it right if\nyou look at it very carefully what you\nreally discover in your own life is that\nmotivation is actually a temporary thing\nby nature your motivation fluctuates\nover time right so like just like we\nsaid i mean the whole problem is that\nour motivation fluctuates over time\nand then we kind of get into a a problem\nbecause you know if we acknowledge that\nour motivation fluctuates over time\nlike that it's essentially a state right\nso i'm highly motivated today\ni'm not motivated tomorrow then\nyou know it's kind of tricky because\nlike if our if our solutions\nare sort of trait based if they're\npersonality based and people sort of\ntry to figure out how can i become a\ndisciplined person\nthat's where our target is what we\nreally try to do is become\nsomething that we're not so we want to\nlike flip a switch\nthat turns on our motivation like almost\npermanently right i want to become a\nmotivated person\nand that's what i sort of gear towards\nthat's what like\nsuccess gurus will sort of talk about\nright like this is how you become a\nmotivated person\nbut it's all very trait-based thinking\nit's kind of interesting because\nyou know in the east they sort of think\nabout motivation a little bit more like\na state\nso this is also you know generalization\nbut if you look at yogi's for example\nwhat they'll say is like you know the\nnature of the mind\nis that it fluctuates and that like\nmotivation will naturally fluctuate over\ntime\nin fact the definition of yoga so\nthere's a sanskrit\nyou know line yoga cheetah\nwhich means that yoga is the cessation\nof fluctuations of the mind\nthat is literally the definition of yoga\nand so what does that kind of mean like\nso how how is it that yoga and\nmeditation and yogis are like they're\nlike pretty hardcore right like they\nwake up at like\n4 a.m every day and they like meditate\nand do yoga and they're very careful\nabout their diet and things like that\nand so it's kind of interesting because\nlike how does that you know\nwhat they kind of focus on is not\nbecoming disciplined\nwhat they focus on is controlling the\nstate of their mind\nand acknowledge that by definition it's\nactually\nfluctuating okay so i want you all to\nthink about something\nso let's kind of so what i'd like to\nshare with you all today is an\nunderstanding of motivation\nas a state instead of a trait so i want\nyou to think about something so if i\nplay video games every day let's say i\nwake up every day and i spend all my all\nmy time watching twitch and video games\nand youtube and netflix and whatnot okay\nso when i look at that when i look at\nmyself i say to myself\ni am unmotivated and that is why\ni spend all my time playing video games\nand netflix and whatever right\nso i want you all to think about this\nfor a second is it because you are\nunmotivated that you spend all your time\nwe waste your time right they say oh if\ni was more motivated i wouldn't\nlike if i was motivated i would go out\nand like get a job or exercise or\nwhatever if i was motivated\nso you know if i was motivated then i\nwould spend all my time doing this stuff\nbut i want you guys to think what's the\nchicken and what's the egg is the lack\nof motivation what causes you to play\nvideo games all day\nor is it playing video video games all\nday that causes the lack of motivation\nand so there's a really simple\nexperiment for this right so like you\nthink about you know your motivational\nlevel\nlet's say like you want to work on your\nresume when you wake up first thing in\nthe morning on a scale of one to ten how\nmuch do you\nwant to work on your resume let's call\nit a four okay let's say like you're not\neven work on it\nbut if you measure your motivational\nlevel it's like a four out of ten\nand then like after you play like an\nhour of a game\nwhat happens to your motivation are you\nlike more motivated or less motivated\nto work on your resume and then like\nafter six hours of the game\nand eight hours of a game like if you\npla been playing league for 10 hours\nhow motivated are you to\nwork on things right and so it's\ninteresting because\nmost people are saying less some people\nare saying more so we'll get to that in\na second some people are saying the same\nbut i'm not saying that you know even\nwithout doing the behavior\nyour motivation towards the behavior\nwill fluctuate i know it's kind of\ninteresting right but if you really pay\nattention to yourself\nwe're not saying that if you say the\nsame because you're not doing it that's\nnot actually correct\nyour motivation actually fluctuates\nwhich is a really fascinating discovery\nbecause\nthen what we sort of realize is that\nlike playing video games\ninduces low motivation which is a really\nshocking discovery because\nthat doesn't mean that you're lazy or\ndisciplined right it's not a trait\nit's that the things that you do will\nactively contribute or not contribute to\nyour motivation\nso essentially what the yogis sort of\ndiscovered is a system where\ni would kind of think about it this way\nthere's certain actions so i want you to\nthink about motivation not as like a\npersonality characteristic\nor like a stat on your character sheet\nit's not like they're disciplined people\nand undisciplined people\ni want you to think about motivation as\na bank balance and there's some actions\nthat you take\nwhich will contribute to the balance and\nthen when you want to do something\nyou will actually like pull from the\nbalance right i'm going to make deposits\nand i'm going to make withdrawals\nso if i i know it sounds kind of weird\ngoing to the gym\nrequires a withdrawal right\nbut being at the gym actually makes a\ndeposit\nwhich is interesting so now we begin to\nsee like how disciplined people are\nable to do it because every time they go\nto the gym they make a withdrawal but\nthey also make a deposit\nand y'all you know it's kind of like\nreally fascinating because if you\nnotice yourselves and you know the cycle\nof motivation what essentially happens\nis like\nyou do something right and then you feel\nmotivated and like okay i clean my room\ngood\nnow i'm gonna do this and now i'm gonna\ndo this and now i'm gonna do this and\nnow i'm gonna do this\nand if we spend all of our time playing\nvideo games like what's happening to our\nmotivation like we're making withdrawals\nfrom it right like if i'm\ni'm decreasing my motivational capital\nwhen i\nwaste my days and so it's kind of\ninteresting because then if we look at\nthe cycle of motivation inevitably what\nwe find\nis as people become more motivated and\nthey start doing more stuff\nthey start engaging in actions which\nrequire withdrawals but they're not\nmaking the appropriate deposits i know\nit sounds kind of weird\nbut if i start like you know if i clean\nmy room that requires an energy\ninvestment and gives me a burst of\nenergy\nand then eventually what i'll end up\ndoing is i'll take on like bigger tasks\nmore difficult tasks like more\nchallenging tasks\nthat actually withdraw more of my\nmotivational energy than i'm able to\ndeposit\nso a good example of this is like\ntackling finding a job\nright because like that task is so big\nthat you don't really get the reward\nuntil the end but there are all of these\nsteps involved which\nyou may actually be making motivational\nwithdrawals for\nand then you kind of like run out of\nmotivation and i know it sounds like\nreally really weird but\nif you look at people who who go into\ncycles of success and failure\nwhat they essentially do is like they\nstart off lighting the candle\nand then they like light a firecracker\nand then like they light like you know\nthey just like burn all their motivation\naway and then it's like\na set of fireworks and then they feel\ncompletely spent afterward\nand what what i really find is that if\nyou really want to sustain your\nmotivation\nyou have to continually make deposits so\nwe see this in addictions too okay so\naddictions is a\nfantastic example of this where you know\nsomeone is like\nyeah like i'm i'm one week sober hell\nyeah like how did you get one weeks over\ni went to three meetings a week\nand then they're like i'm sober it's\ngreat i feel awesome i'm gonna start\ndoing this i'm gonna start doing this\nbecause i'm sober now i'm sober now\nand eventually what happens is like oh\nlike what about going to meetings\ni don't need to go to meetings anymore\nlike i'm sober i don't need meetings\ni've done it i'm three months sober so\nthey stopped going to meetings\nright and at first they were like super\ncareful and they like went to their\nfirst barbecue where people were\ndrinking and they were going to meetings\nat the time they're like oh i can handle\nthis now.\nso they stop going to meetings and they\ncontinue going to barbecues\nand then eventually what happens they\ncontinue going to barbecues and then\nthey relapse\nit's like how did that relapse happen i\nthought you had it under control like i\nthought\nyou had solved it and they're like yeah\nnow i am\nsober it becomes a trait in their mind\ninstead of a state\nit's no longer something that i have to\nwork towards i have it on luck\ni am sober now i am disciplined i don't\nneed to worry about maintaining\ndiscipline\nbecause i am disciplined and so\nessentially what we discover\nis that there are contributing factors\nto our motivation\nwhich is it's a state right so you've\ngot these motivational bucks\nand it's going to fluctuate over time\nand instead of chasing\nafter becoming a disciplined person all\nyou really need to do is like keep on\nmaking motivational deposits\nin the case of sobriety what it means is\nlike you go to meetings\neven if you're sober you keep going to\nmeetings\nbecause i see this all the time you know\nin mental health treatment especially\nis that people love abandoning the\ntreatment that works\nlike if i put someone on an\nantidepressant medication and six months\nlater they're no longer depressed\nthey come into my office and they're\nlike yeah i want to stop the medication\nwhy because i'm not depressed anymore\nit's a reasonable like request right but\nlike\nlet's understand how you got\nthere and so if you're experiencing\ncycles\nof success and failure what i really\nwant y'all to pay attention to\nis what are what is like the state of\nmotivation\nthat what led to your state of\nmotivation\nso like really think a little bit about\nyou know when people say like okay like\ni shouldn't play video games i need to\nstop playing video games entirely\nwhereas recognize that each hour of the\nday that you play video games it\nactually makes like a motivational\nwithdrawal\nso and this is really dangerous thinking\nbecause if i play like\nlet's say valorent for 10 hours a day or\ndota for 10 hours a day\nand i think to myself if i play for\neight hours a day\nwhat difference does it make eight or\nten what's the difference i'm not gonna\nyou know i'm not gonna put together my\nlife if i'm playing dodo for eight hours\na day\nwho the hell cares about ten hours a day\nlike eight or ten what difference does\nit have to degenerate either either way\nand those are the people that don't\nacknowledge that playing dota for two\nless hours a day\nis actually going to boost your\nmotivation by a small amount\nso i want y'all to really focus on the\nstate of motivation\nand you can also kind of understand this\nwith with\nfood as well right so like you can think\nabout\nwhen you eat like how much do you feel\nlike studying how much do you feel like\nworking and like depending on what food\nyou put into your body\nhow does that affect your motivation if\ni'm like you know if it noon rolls\naround and i eat like six slices of\npepperoni pizza like what's gonna happen\nto my motivation afterward\nwhat happens to my motivation when i\ndrink coffee what happens to my\nmotivation when i take adderall\nso we begin to see that once again and\nthis is why yogis have a very specific\ndiet because they sort of discovered\nsomething called the satwik diet\nyou know what the satwik diet\nessentially does is like enhances the\nstate of your mind\nso that you're like highly motivated and\nso it's kind of tricky because like\nyou know we think about discipline and\nlaziness but what we really don't think\nabout is like what is the cost of eating\nsix slices of pizza\nit's not just calories and you're like\ni'm a degenerate i don't care about\ncalories like whatever\nlike i'm overweight whatever or you're\nnot overweight maybe you've got avata\nmetabolism and you're totally fine\nbut what we don't really think about is\neach action that you take\nis going to be making a motivational\ndeposit or a motivational withdrawal\nand what i encourage you all to do is to\nreally think about the state of\nmotivation\nand think about how does my motivation\nget altered and how do i need to\nnurture it because it's not a trait\nright it's not like a house that i build\nand then stays up there\nmotivation needs to be cultivated like a\ngarden now i can water it every day and\nit'll grow\nand it'll be great but if i stop\nwatering it the garden's gonna die\nso most people that i work with who have\ncycles of success or failure\nessentially once they start harvesting\nfruit or vegetables or herbs or whatever\nfrom the garden\nthey stop taking care of it which\ninevitably leads to the failure\nso start to think a little bit more\nabout motivation as a state and start to\nthink a little bit about how your diet\nhow your actions how your the company\nthat you keep how your environment\nsort of gives you motivational deposits\nand be really careful if you start to\nwithdraw a ton without\ncontinuing to maintain whatever brought\nyou the motivation in the first place\nhow do i get enough protein with a\nscotic diet it's tough but remember that\nthe saatvik diet you can eat tofu\nand you can eat lentils right so those\nare the two major sources of protein\nbut if you're going to be a bodybuilder\nand you're trying to eat one\nyou know one gram of protein per kg i\nthink is what it is\nyou know that's really hard to do on the\nscottish diet remember that scottish\npeople are not bodybuilders\nwhat about discipline so here's what i'd\nsay about discipline\ndiscipline is what a high state of\nmotivation\nlooks like from the outside so if you if\nyou actually look on\ninside the mind of a disciplined person\nthey're not\ndisciplined like it's not very different\nfrom your mind it's just i i know it\nsounds kind of weird but\ndiscipline is like what we see from the\noutside it's an emergent property it's\nnot actually a thing\nyeah so can you provide some practical\nexamples of depositing and withdrawing\nstuff from your motivational bank\nabsolutely so like i've done i have\nright so like playing a video game what\ndoes that do to your motivational bank\ndecreases it or you're not making a\ndeposit right\nso like if you think about doing a small\ntask like cleaning cleaning is going to\nbe a motivational deposit\nand a motivational cost but generally\nspeaking it's going to be an\nupswing so if we think about cleaning\nthis is the way i'd think about cleaning\nso cleaning requires\nwithdraws five motivational points but\ngives you a plus two\nfor the next week every single day\nright so what we tend to see is that\npeople who are highly disciplined like\nwill do multiple things\ngoing to the gym is a minus 10 but is a\nplus four\nfor the next week eating a healthy meal\nmaybe like a minus two but will be a\nplus one\nfor the like a plus three for the next\nthree days\nright so this is how i want you guys to\nthink about your motivational bank\nhe's like what is the small task every\ntime i play a video game like if i play\none day of dota\nthat's a minus two for the next 72 hours\nright and then eventually we get to like\ndopamine detox realm where if you play\nthat\nso much then it's like a pretty bad like\nminus\n30 or minus 50 percent to all\nmotivational deposits\nit's a 50 tax on every deposit that you\nmake\nso this is why if you look at people who\nlike you know put their lives together\nthey do so\nnot by transforming themselves\nright and even like this is the problem\nis if you look at like people who become\nsuccessful and i fall into this\ncamp right i say oh i went to india and\ni found myself and then i became\nsuccessful\nand it seems like a magical like\novernight thing\nbut i went to india at the age of 21 and\ni started medical school at the age of\n28.\nthere's seven years in there of like\nlittle\nsuccesses and little failures that sort\nof build up over time\nso it took me seven years to get on the\npath to success\nlet alone another like eight\nto actually like become qualified to be\na decent human being\nis a scottish diet gonna be vegan no so\nsativic diets will include dairy\nactually unless you take do you unless\nyou do like the east asian version of a\nsophic diet\nwhich may be dairy free those will\nprobably be vegan like if you eat at you\nknow a monastery in korea like that'll\nprobably be vegan\nhow does one overcome more difficult\nobstacles to gain motivation\nis it just do it no so this is my whole\npoint\nso the way that you become overcome a\ndifficult obstacle is by making\ntiny tiny deposits that are going to\nbuild up your motivational bank\nright so how do you overcome depression\nlike i've seen a bunch of these posts\nrecently where people like i cleaned my\nkitchen today\ndoes that overcome depression no is it a\nstep forward\nabsolutely so you clean your kitchen one\nday you do your laundry day two\nyou like clean the living room day three\nand you go through your mail\nday four\nyou look at your syllabus day five and\neach of those days\nis going to give you like a motivation\nbuff that's like stacking\nand then what happens is people stack it\nstack and stack it and then they get to\nthe point they're like\noh look at all this motivation i have\nnow comes the cycle of success and\nfailure\nbecause you've you've stacked up a buff\nof plus 28 motivation\nper day that starts decaying over time\nand then you stop doing the things to\ntake care of yourself\nand then it all disappears right so i\nwant you all to stop thinking about\ndiscipline\nor saying like oh i took a five-factor\npersonality test and\nmy conscientiousness is low i'm screwed\nlike that's scientifically that's true\nand you can still overcome it right by\nusing motivation\nbuffs which is the eastern style so\nif people want one really really simple\nconcrete\nthing to do to make a motivational\ndeposit\none day a week okay like if you have\nmedical concerns or something like that\nlike make sure you talk to your doctor\nbut i'd say one day a week\ndo a fast that includes fruits nuts and\ndairy and that's it\none day a week and water obviously so\nlike drink as much water as you want to\nbut\nyou know you can still get a decent\nnumber of calories so we're not saying\nlike starve yourself but like reduce\nwhat kind of macronutrients you take in\nfruits nuts and dairy that's it yeah so\nif you've got like diabetes and stuff\nyou know don't do this kind of thing but\nhow does this help it's going to give\nyou a motivational buff of like plus\nthree for the next few days\nthat's how it's gonna help no veggies\njust give it a shot so i'm not saying\nyou should do it for a prolonged period\nof time you try it for a day and see if\nyou like it\nso a lot of people i encourage all of\nyou all to experiment with your diet\nright try to figure out okay what are\nthe foods that make me feel more\nmotivated\nwhat are the foods that make me feel\nless motivated start to make adjustments\ni think a good place to start is like\nyou know you'll get\nsome amount of protein some amount of\nfat and some amount of carbohydrate\nit's a relatively safe thing to do and\nif it feels really bad or you start to\nget concerned or whatever like if you\nstart to feel super weird like\njust eat normally and you should be fine\nor go see a doctor\nmaybe ask your doctor before you do it's\nprobably good advice and so i want y'all\nto all pay attention to what's happening\nright now\nso in your life motivation is a big\nproblem\ntherefore it requires a big solution so\nthe other problem with cycles of\nmotivation and failure is that like\nthink see how your mind resists the\nsolution it's like oh that can't be\nenough\nbecause the problem feels so big to me\nthat it must have a big solution\nand then what happens when you go\nlooking for a big solution\nyou never find it right there you are\nlooking for the magic bullet that's\ngoing to transform your\nyour mind and then you'll be a\ndisciplined person and you will be like\none of those people\nit'll be a personality transformation\nthis is why people stay stuck\nso you have to experiment not all big\nproblems require big solutions like\nsomeone has been addicted to alcohol for\n15 years\nhow do i get sober it's such a huge\nproblem you go to meetings\nyou go see a therapist that's it it's\nlike four hours a week\nthree hours a week two hours a week\nmaybe even one hour a week\nit's really interesting so be careful\nwhen your mind\ntells you that a solution is too simple\nor too easy\nfor your hard and complex problem\nand what you really listen i i encourage\nyou to think about it in your own life\nright like when you've\nrealized something you're like oh crap\nit's so simple i just didn't realize it\nright so big solutions don't necessarily\nrequire big problems\ni mean uh big problems don't necessarily\nrequire big solutions\nis vitamin d deficiency messing with\nmotivation too absolutely\nso there's uh you know one of the tests\nthat i always run\nnot always but usually run for patients\nof mine who are depressed is vitamin d\nso vitamin d deficiency contribute is\none of the\ncauses for depression and so we also\nknow that\nyou know supplementing vitamin d or\ngetting someone's vitamin d level back\nto normal can be a treatment for\ndepression\nso this is where in the east they sort\nof say that there's seven\nthings that result in health and one of\nthem is sunlight\nand that sunlight is like important to\nbe healthy\nwhat are the others okay so let me see\nif i can remember\nsunlight food water air sleep\nexercise and meditation\nthese are the seven things that you\nshould do to take care of yourself\nyou"
