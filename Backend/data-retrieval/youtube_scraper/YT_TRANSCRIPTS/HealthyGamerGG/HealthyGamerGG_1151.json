    "transcript": "so this stream is going to be kind of\ninteresting because i think that\nfor those of you that are like\nrelatively familiar with our work and\nhave questions about ayurveda i think\nit's going to be fantastic\nand for those of you who don't really\nknow too much about ayurveda you may be\na little bit lost\nso um you know one of the challenges\nthat we have is that we'll\nteach a little bit about ayurveda but\nayurveda is like it's a\nbig system right so it's a system that's\nbeen developed for thousands of years\nif you want to understand ayurveda from\nstart to finish it's like a five-year\neducation like full-time medical\neducation and that's just\nthe end of school right so then you\nstart to practice and you learn a lot\nabout nuances and things like that\nso we introduce ayurveda um you know in\na basic way and there's like a lot more\ninformation about it in dr k's guide\nbut i thought what we would do today is\nactually like\nexplain some of the more detailed or\nnuanced things\nbecause a lot of the way that i talk\nabout ayurveda is very simplified\nand may also be incorrect to be blunt\nbecause\ni'm not actually a trained ayurvedic\nphysician i'm someone who\nstarted studying ayurveda at the age of\n21 studied it sort of like informally\nand then you know i've studied it for a\nlong time but i'm essentially an amateur\nthe interesting the cool thing about\nbeing an amateur is that there's a lot\nof traditional\nthere's a lot of stuff in ayurveda that\nhas become like shaped\nover time um and they've actually\nlike lost sight of like a lot of it so\nthe biggest example of this is like\npsychiatry and mental health\nso if you look at ayurveda there's to my\nknowledge really only one ayurvedic\nhospital\nin india anyway and arguably the world\nthat specializes in psychiatry i've only\nbeen able to find one there may be more\num so so it's kind of interesting\nbecause like even if you look at some of\nthe old texts on ayurveda\nthat you know two of the major texts on\nayurveda\nwill sort of acknowledge that when they\nwere written there were like\nayurvedic psychiatrists and that if you\nwant to learn\nabout that branch you should read this\nthird dude's text\nthe challenge is that it appears that\nthat third dude's\ntext has been sort of like lost over\ntime\nso i think that there's a lot of room\nfor development\nof ayurvedic perspectives on mental\nhealth\nand there's another kind of important\nreason why the ayurvedic perspective on\nmental health is like a little bit\nlacking\nis that mental health and like the way\nthat the mind work\nworks was actually more traditionally\nlike a part of yoga\nas opposed to the system of medicine so\nthis is kind of like thinking about you\nknow we have psychology\nand we have psychiatry and psychology is\nlike\na basic science uh that\nstudies the mind and psychiatry is a\nbranch of medicine right so it's about\nthe application\nand pathology of the mind and so in that\nsame way\nin the eastern system you had the\nayurvedic folks who were medical\nprofessionals\nand then you had the yogis who were like\nsort of the basic science here's how the\nmind works\nso a lot of what we would call ayurvedic\npsychiatry is actually\nfound in like yogic texts\nso this is kind of all a roundabout way\nof saying\nyou know i think that what i'm talking\nabout has some merit and at the same\ntime\nyou know i'm i'm not actually like\nformally trained in it\nso you got to take it with a grain of\nsalt okay\nso let's kind of start off with this so\nwe saw\nso our structure today is going to be\nwe're going to look at a couple of\nreddit posts and i love these reddit\nposts because\nyou know i think they speak to\ndeficiencies\nin what we've explained so far so like\nsometimes when we'll teach about art\nbecause i do simplify things there's\nlike a lot of people who are like\nwait but there's stuff missing here and\nyou're absolutely right\nso there's absolute deficiencies in what\nwe've shared with you there may even be\ndeficiencies in my learning i'm not sure\nwhich one\nis you know more accurate but so today\nwhat we're going to do is like do a\ndeeper dive into like\na couple of subtle concepts around\nayurvedic doshas\nand more importantly we're going to\nexplain like doshik combinations\nokay and and the way that we're going to\nkind of explain this stuff\nis going to be like actually more from\nlike a corporate consulting standpoint\nso one of the things that i do is\ncorporate consulting\nso i'll go to a company and i'll teach\nthem about ayurveda because the basic\nidea\nthat i'll share with them is that you\nknow not all people are the same\nand if you look at western psychology\nlike western psychology i know it sounds\nkind of weird\nbut sort of has the assumption that all\npeople are the same\nso if you look at like psychiatry they\nwill diagnose a person with depression\nand the depression is a disease that is\nindependent of the person\nright if you look at like something like\ncancer like cancer is an\nindependent process that can affect\npeople\nbut is not intertwined with the person\nand so we've taken that medical aspect\nwhich also has to do with like you know\nwas informed like our system of\nscience and medicine was heavily\ninformed by things like um\nyou know microbiology where there's like\nan agent that causes an\ninfection and the agent is independent\nof the person\nand we took that idea of like disease is\nan\nindependent process uh that we found in\nwestern medici\nlike sorry physical medicine and we also\napplied that paradigm to psychology and\npsychiatry\nwhere we said anxiety is an independent\nprocess\nyou are you and the anxiety is over here\nand the anxiety affects you\nthe two are not actually intertwined so\nayurveda is a little bit different and\nayurveda says that you can't have a\ndisease\noutside of a person that there are\nspecific\naspects of your dorsi balance which will\naffect the way that the disease\nmanifests within you\nand there's some really interesting\nsupport for this scientific hypothesis i\nmean this ayurvedic hypothesis\nso for example if you look at like the\nway that we diagnose depression they're\nessentially three types of depression\nand like this is like according to\nwestern science okay\nthere is an anxious depression which is\nlike\ndepression that's characterized by\ninsomnia\nrestlessness fidgeting rumination\na lot of thoughts and then there's a\nneuro-vegetative depression which is\ncharacterized by\nhypersomnia weight gain low energy\ndifficulty moving and like thoughts that\nsort of\naren't all over the place but focus on\none thing in sort of a sluggish\nand rigid way and it's kind of weird\nbecause literally if you look at the\ndiagnostic criteria for\ndepression it can include weight loss\nor weight gain hypersomnia\nor insomnia and not moving a whole lot\nor moving too much and if you just kind\nof think about it logically like\nthose sound like opposite ends of\nmanifestations right like\nit's not like you get you know back pain\nand back pleasure\nas part of rheumatoid arthritis it's not\nlike you get\nyou know fever and hypothermia is part\nof an infection\nyou know usually it's like it's kind of\nbizarre but like two polar opposites are\nnot the same disease\nlike it's kind of like so simple but\nthat's the way that our western medicine\nhas evolved\nand there's a third lesser known type of\ndepression\nwhich is called depression with anger\nattacks so these are people that like\nexperience depression but they their\nprimary manifestation is actually\nlike irritability and like anger so they\ndon't necessarily feel\nsad but what they do is feel like\nincredible incredible amounts of\nfrustration\nand it's also really interesting because\nif you look at pediatric presentations\nand adolescent presentations of\ndepression\nit appears that in pediatric populations\ndepression doesn't manifest as\nsadness it manifests as moodiness and\nirritability\nso it's kind of interesting because even\nin western science we're sort of\nfiguring out okay there are these three\ntypes of depressions but the really\nfascinating thing is ayurveda actually\nsays that if you take an\nindependent disease process and you plug\nit into a person\nyou will manifest in three different\nways depending on what the person's\ncontribution is okay so when i go to a\ncorporation i'll say like hey\ni can teach your staff to be healthier\nand like\nwork with each other more harmoniously\nand the way that i can teach all that is\nby teaching you about ayurveda because\nit'll help you understand\nyour temperament and once you understand\nyour temperament the way that your mot\nyour individual mind functions it will\nbecome clear\nwhy there is workplace conflict because\nyou'll have a vata who doesn't like\nstructure and likes to innovate\nand likes to you know explore and you'll\nhave a kapha who's like\nno no no we need like structure like we\nhave processes for a reason\nwe are organized for a reason like like\nwhen you stick to the processes when you\nget the best\nresult and the vata is like let's go\nlet's figure it out we'll figure it out\ndon't worry man like why are you so\nstuck up\nbro like what's going on and the kapha\nis like oh my god\nokay so you'll get a lot of like a\nworkplace conflict because of\nuh differences so what we're gonna do\nis is\nyeah so anyone can be a bully so we're\ngonna do is actually start\nwith um taking a look at um a couple of\nposts\nokay and then what we're going to do is\nexplain a little bit more about like how\nto approach\nvata pitta and kapha from sort of like a\nworkplace setting\num and then what we'll do is like think\na little bit about like workplace\ntemperaments and job roles\nas they relate to combinations because\npeople will ask like if i'm a vata kafa\nthen what do i do and so we'll sort of\nlook at different job roles in which\nthose kinds of people\ntend to operate well and then lastly\nwe'll kind of explore explore a couple\nof nuances of doshas\nand then we'll have a meditation\ntechnique which is sort of related to\nayurveda towards the end okay um so one\nlast thing about science okay for a\nsecond\nso i gotta say this so at the beginning\nof what i'm gonna explain to you guys\nit is very scientifically valid the\nfurther we go\nin today's teaching the more we're gonna\nleave science behind\nokay so it's we're gonna start like very\nscientifically grounded and i'll\nshow you all a couple of papers which\ni've shown before and then like the more\nthat we get towards the corporate\nconsulting side i want you all to\nunderstand there have not been\nstudies about the specificity of what\ni'm teaching\nit's anecdotally very useful people love\nit people get better i've certainly\nloved it i think there is science there\nbut the studies have not reached that\npoint right we're at the very\nbasic level of studying ayurveda\nscientifically and it's been incredibly\nfascinating\nbut the closer we get to application the\nmore we're going to leave the solid\nfoundation of evidence and sort of\nextrapolate from the evidence to come up\nwith theories and conclusions\nbut a lot of the stuff that i'm gonna\nteach y'all towards the end some of it\nhas been actually verified through\nsome personality assessments and things\nlike that but\nreally we're gonna like leave the\nevidence behind and it's gonna be a lot\nmore like clinically focused\nokay so um you know just i\nwant to just toss out that disclaimer\nokay questions\nyeah so one of the things that we try to\ndo so i want you all to understand this\nokay about leaving science behind\nso i'm a clinician so i know it sounds\nkind of weird but most of clinical\nmedicine is not scientific\nand it sounds kind of weird but you know\nwe have scientific trials right so we'll\nhave trials that tell us okay this\nantidepressant you should use first this\nantidepressant you should use next this\nantidepressant you should use third\nand when an actual human being comes\ninto my office\nthere's a protocol of the standard of\nlike\nwhat is you know on average the most\neffective\nbut what i want y'all to realize is that\nlike on average\nwhat may be the most effective is not\nvery effective for like 40\nof the population right so the goal of\nclinical medicine\nis to take a scientific foundation which\nis very well grounded\nand it to an individual case\nand if we want to be really precise\nabout it there are no randomized\ncontrolled trials\nabout you there is not a single\nrandomized controlled trial\nthat looks at what antidepressant will\nbe effective\nin you right i know it sounds kind of\nweird all of the trials are\nwhat's effective on average but if you\nthink about where you are\nand where average is there can be a big\ngap there right like\nyou are a very different person from the\naverage person\neach of us has like a different height\nand you may be above average or below\naverage\nthe other way to kind of think about it\nis if i'm a fashion consultant\ni can look at data and i can say like\nokay on average what do people wear\nokay what's the average size people are\na medium what's the average color\nokay most people wear like blue what's\nthe average of what people wear okay\npeople where\nare wearing this nowadays based on\nfashion trends and all of those averages\nmay not apply to you if you're\n4 foot 11 or 7 foot right like we we\nwant to\ncater to the individual and use a\nfoundation\nof what science tells us okay\nokay all right so last point is i'm\nhearing a lot of people you know i saw\none question that's like i'm becoming\nmore vat that what do i do about it\nso unfortunately today the focus is not\ngoing to be what\nto do about your vata the focus today is\ngoing to be\nall of the people who are asking what\nkind of dosha\nam i and how can i understand my dosha\nthere's going to be a little bit less on\nthe intervention side because what we\nreally want to focus on\nis the nuance of like like you know dual\ndoshik people\nand trying to understand that okay so\nfirst we're it's a little bit more of a\ndiagnostic\nand explanatory as opposed to like this\nis what you do about it\num so i apologize for that but that's\nsort of why we have\nanyway just occurred yeah i can't teach\neverything all at once okay\nso we're gonna do things in chunks all\nright so let's get started\nyou all okay with this chat is this good\nah what's the difference between about\nthen adhd okay so save all your\nquestions\nfor the end okay all right\nokay so number one your dosha is not\nyour pokemon type\nlook i get it you found a new framework\nyou're very excited about it you heard\nabout a new structure for understanding\nthe self and your immediate impulse\nis something like as long as i can\nfigure this out the best way to harness\nmy coffee strengths and shore up my\nthe corresponding weaknesses i'll be\nable to solve my problems\nand maybe you will whatever works works\nand i'm not here to tell you that you\nneed to abandon the idea\nfor the sake of some sort of immortal\ntruth if categorizing yourself is\na bit the somehow ameliorates your\nissues\nthere but for the grace of god go i have\nfun\nwhat i'm trying to make clear is that\ndosha the dosha concept\nis not some rigorous definition of\nindividual character\nit is like stated above a framework for\nintrospection\nlike many other classifications of human\npersonality types\nit's primarily useful as a tool to get\nthe individual to look inward and\nexamine pathways\nthat may not be obvious at first glance\nunderstanding your dorsa\nwhatever that may mean is not a solution\nin its in and of itself\nit's only a tool to enhance\nself-exploration\nmore importantly it's a tool that is\nonly relevant to the person using it\nyour classification is of minimal\nimportance to the people around you\nit's an entirely personal concept as a\nresult the people\nasking for advice on how to approach a\nsituation as\ninsert dosha type here are fundamentally\nmisguided because this whole framework\nisn't going to provide you a solution\nthere's all sorts of solutions to all\nsorts of problems and trying to peg an\nindividualized solution to a dosha type\nas though you're figuring out the best\nweaknesses to exploit\nin a pokemon battle is completely\northogonal to what you actually need\nframing your personal issues purely\nwithin the dosha framework is going to\nlead you astray because\nintrospection doesn't solve problems it\nhelps you solve problems more\neffectively\nthe resolution is ultimately on you as\nan individual the framework can't step\ninto your place\nokay now this is a wonderful post i\nuploaded it right\nloved the post it's a fantastic post\nand unfortunately\nthere are huge swaths of it that are\nkind of wrong\nokay so let's take a look at this so\nthis person's argument is that there are\na lot of\nsystems of let's look at this okay so\nlike many other classifications of human\npersonality types it's primarily useful\ntool\nto get the individual to look inward and\nexamine pathways that are not\nthat may not be obvious at a first\nglance so this person is correct\nin in some of these fundamentals okay so\nand like woefully incorrect in others so\nlet's try to understand\nwhat's correct about this and sort of\nwhat isn't or my opinion on what isn't\nso the first is okay we've got a lot of\ndifferent personality types right like\nwhat\nhogwarts house are you you know what is\nwhat's your myers-briggs type\num what's your balance on the five\nfactor model\nand it's it's good because even\nastrology right so like\nastrology can be useful as a framework\nfor introspection\nso this person is kind of coming from\nthe stance that personality analyses\nare useful as frameworks for\nintrospection\nyou can use it to guide your internal\njourney\nyou know use as a tool to self to\nenhance self-exploration\nand that that tool is only relevant to\nthe person using it right so like if i'm\nbig into astrology\nand like it i'm like oh my god i'm such\na libra i'm such a libra like\nno one else really cares whether i'm a\nlibra or not i can still use libra to\nhelp understand\nmy own internal kind of perspective\num and and that can be beneficial to me\nand i can still gain value out of it\nand that's sort of that's that's\nabsolutely true like this argument is\nlike theoretically like spot on right\nso we even know from psychological\nresearch that\nastrology is essentially a projective\ntest\nso in psychology there are certain tests\nlike the rorschach or inkblot test is\nthe best example of this\nthat's a projective test and so the\nvalue isn't\nyou know that something is objectively\ncorrect but that we can\nuse particular things to help people\nunderstand\nand serve as frameworks for\nintrospection\nand that if you provide someone with a\nframework of introspection the framework\ndoesn't need to be objectively correct\nthe value is in the introspection okay\nthat's what this person's\ncases and he's absolutely correct that\nin most situations a personality\nanalysis this happens to be true\nas it turns out ayurveda is actually a\nlittle bit different\nand the main reason for that is that\nayurveda is not\njust a system of introspection it's\nsomething that\nis correlated to your genomics right so\npeople have done studies\nwhich show that your doshik balance is\nnot just something that you use for\nintrospection\nbut can actually be genetically\nidentified so if we look at\nthe spectrum of human beings we realize\nthat some people\nare more prone to experiencing anxiety\nand some people are more prone to ulcers\nand some people\nare more prone to anger so if we look at\nhuman beings and we do a scientific\nstudy and we stress\na hundred people out 33 of those people\nwill become\nanxious as a response to the stress 33\nof those people will become angry and\nirritable with response to those stress\nand 33 people will become isolated and\ndepressed with a response to the stress\nnow those numbers i actually don't know\nif those are true or not but the point\nis that we can make very\nreal scientific observations about\nvariances within the human population\nand as we study ayurveda what we\ndiscover\nis that these um all of these variations\nwhich we can detect with people\nare actually like correlated to their\ngenome\nright we can actually look at these\npeople who all get anxious\nwe can look at their genome and see oh\nwow\nall of the people who are prone to\nanxiety\nactually share common genes let me show\nyou guys\nthis okay so here's just an example of\nthis\nso like here you know you can say that\nokay so like there are three types of\npeople you can use this as a frame\nuh you know an interest a framework for\nintrospective\nintrospection but what's really\ninteresting is that if you actually look\nat like\num you know papers that\nlook at science what you discover is\nthat\nthree basic genocycle somatotypes or\nbirth constitutions\nhave different nuclear receptors which\nare expected to regulate\nthe expression of specific genes thereby\ncontrolling embryonic development\nadult homeostasis and human metabolism\nof the human organism in a profound way\nthis is not a framework for\nintrospection my friend\nthis is something that has been\nscientifically shown to be\nbaked into genes okay so this is why i\nemphasize ayurveda\nover astrology or so because i've\nstudied a lot of stuff\nokay guys i've studied like vedic\nastrology\nnot so much western astrology i learned\nhow to read tarot cards\ni'm an energy healer i don't talk about\nany of that crap\ni'm also somewhat familiar with\nmyers-briggs but i steer it away from\nmyers-briggs\nthe reason i steered away from\nmyers-briggs is because when i looked\nfor evidence for it\nwhat i found is that there's the\nmyers-briggs institute\nwhich publishes a lot of evidence but\nthere is very little\nindependent verification of the\nmyers-briggs model\nwhich i have been able to find okay\nso like ayurvedic genomics establishing\na genetic basis for mind-body typologies\nright so like this is kind of\ninteresting so there's a significant\ncorrelation between\nhla type and prakriti that's really\nfascinating\nso hla types are sort of individual\nreceptors\non some of our immunes on our cells\nwhich immune cells recognize and stuff\nlike that\nbut it actually that hla types so these\nare\nthings that are sort of like blood\ngroups right that they actually\ncorrelate with vata pitta and kapha\nso it's sort of fascinating because i do\nthink that where i disagree with this\nperson\nis that ayurveda is simply a framework\nfor introspection\nnow some of the ways that we talk about\nit we use it as framework\nfor introspection so in that sense this\nperson is absolutely correct\nbecause when i tell you guys hey this is\nwhat avata is this is what a pitta is\nthis is what a kapha is\ni'm not doing genetic analysis on each\nand every one of you and sort of\nyou know determining your ayurvedic type\nso\nin this sense like we sort of you know\nwe do use it like a pokemon type right\nlike\nthe way that i explain ayurveda is\nfrom a sort of like take a personality\ntest and it's what you identify with\nso in that sense our application of\nunderstanding ayurvedic doshas are sort\nof a framework of for introspection\nwhich is exactly what this person is\nsaying and at the same time\ni want everyone to understand that\nayurveda is not just a framework\nfor introspection the reason that we\nthat's the way we're using it\nabsolutely but there is actually\noverwhelming evidence that ayurveda is\nnot\nlike the other systems of personality\nbecause i don't know of\nany systems of personality that have\ndone this much correlation to like\ngenetics and sort of figuring out okay\nthis personality type\nactually is developed due to a\ncombination of genetics\ngene expression embryonic environment\nlike that is absolutely wild\nchat but there is a huge difference\nin my experience between ayurveda and\nother systems of personality analysis\nso even if you look at things like the\nfive factor model which are also systems\nof personality\nanalysis that have been very well\nvalidated i don't know i haven't really\nlooked at this because i'm not an expert\nin five factor research because you\ncan't be an expert in everything\nunfortunately\nbut i don't know what degree of genetic\ncorrelation has been done with five\nfactor research and sort of like looking\nat people's genes\nso this is kind of a it's a it's a\nfantastic post and i think the person's\num you know like very correct about a\nlot of things\nbut i i do think that this is where\nactually in my experience this is not\nthe case\nso more importantly it's a tool that is\nonly relevant to the person using it\nand so we'll talk about this a little\nbit down the line but like literally\ni'll do\nconsulting for corporations where it's\nnot\nonly relevant to the person using it but\nwhen everyone in your team\nunderstands everyone's ayurvedic dosha\nit becomes very relevant and this will\nbecome a little bit more clear once we\nget to\nthe framework that i'm going to share\nwith you guys today but understanding\nthat you're avata\nand understanding that someone else is a\nguffa will help you\nchange the way that your mind or realize\nwhich way your mind is defaulting to\nthinking\nand acknowledge someone else's default\nthought and it actually\nreally really helps with like conflict\nresolution and team harmony\nonce you realize what your pokemon type\nis\nwhich the person is fair to say that we\ndon't really have good scientific\nways of connecting the genetics to the\npokemon type\nso we are sort of basically determining\na pokemon type\nbut i i have kind of two important\ncaveats which is one is that like\nit's not just a framework for\nintrospection that's how we're using it\nin these cases\nabsolutely and it has all of the\nshortcomings of that but it does appear\nthat your ayurvedic dosha\nactually correlates with genetics and\nother kinds of things which were you\nknow i can go into more detail but\nyou know even for example like some of\nmy uh ayurvedic colleagues in india\nhave been able to predict complications\nof kovid\nbased on the dosha of of the patient so\ncovid is one thing right\nbut whether this person uh needs icu\nstuff\nor they have cognitive stuff or they\nhave gi symptoms from covid\nappears to correlate with their\nayurvedic dosha which is incredibly\nfascinating\nright so unfortunately studies haven't\nreally been published\non this yet we'll see if they ever kind\nof get published um\nbut it does appear that like you know\nphysicians are able to sort of predict\nokay does this person need to watch out\nfor stroke does this person need to\nwatch out for gi complications\ncognitive complications or respiratory\ncomplications\nbecause covid can cause all kinds of\nrandom crap in random people\nbut if you really think about it you\nknow i know it sounds kind of weird but\nthere's absolutely biology and science\nthat\nleads to a complication of covid it's\nnot random it's not truly random right\nwe just don't have an understanding of\nbiology that's that's strong enough\nto where we can predict which kinds of\ncomplications are going to happen\nhappen with which people in western\nmedicine so it's really fascinating\nokay so um so this is also where you\nknow\nuh you know the kind of says that\nthey're fundamentally misguided because\nthis whole framework isn't going to\nprovide you with a solution\nand that's where i'd say like you know\nthat's not something so i'm going to say\nthat i disagree but this is where\nneither i am right nor this person is\nright you know to really\nunderstand whether this framework will\nprovide you with a solution or not is\ngoing to require data\nright so what really the way that we\nneed to answer this question\nis we take you know a hundred let's take\n200 people\nin a workplace setting and um and we're\nwe're not really thinking about doing\nthis study yet but you know i have\nmultiple corporate clients and\nhave some connections at academic\ninstitutions and stuff like that so\nthis study may arise within the next\ncouple of years\nand what we're going to do is is teach\n100 people about their dosha\nand we're going to have some kind of\ncontrol group where you know we're not\ngoing to teach people about their dosha\nand then the interesting thing is that\nwe can actually measure\nwhether teaching people about their\ndosha actually leads to measurable\neffects right so it's not about my\nopinion or this person's opinion\nthis is absolutely a situation where\nlike over time\ni think the goal is going to be to\nactually measure and test some of these\nhypotheses\nbecause this statement more importantly\nit's it's a it's a tool that is only\nrelevant to the person\nusing it that's a fair opinion i have my\nfair opinion i'm not saying i mean i\nbelieve i'm right and i believe this\nperson is incorrect\nbut i can't really say that right the\nreal money is going to be\nwhen we actually have an ayurvedic\nintervention\nand whether we can actually measure some\ndegree of change\nokay um so\nbut generally speaking i think that this\nperson's sentiment is absolutely correct\nthat generally speaking person systems\nof personality analysis\nare useful as frameworks for\nintrospection and that\nthe goal is to introspect learn\nsomething about yourself\nand then use that to solve problems more\neffectively like i think that's\nabsolutely a wonderful and reasonable\nlogical change\nand at the same time i do believe that\nayurveda\nhas scientific evidence which elevates\nit\nbeyond just the system of framework for\nintrospection\nand the caveat to that is that what i'm\ngoing to teach you all today\nis absolutely closer to a framework of\nfor introspection than it is\nuh you know like genetically verified\nright because we're going to apply this\nextrapolate this more as a framework for\nintrospection\nokay great fantastic post\nlove it and by the way um\nyou know i really hope that so i want\ny'all to understand this\ni love this post so much because\nour subreddit is not a place for dr k to\nbe right\nour subreddit is absolutely a place for\nanyone to be right and anyone to be\nwrong so someone i i sometimes post on\nthe subreddit\nand someone like realized that like i\nmy response was dr k and they're like\nhey man you should have flair so that\npeople know when you're talking\nand i'm like no bro i really should not\nright so that what's really great about\nthat is that\ni rarely have the top comment on\nresponses to the subreddit which is\nabsolutely the way that it's supposed to\nbe\nright we this is not a post reddit of dr\nk is right and everyone needs to know\nwhen dr k\nopens his mouth i have a platform where\ni get to be right and everyone gets to\nlisten to what i say\nthe point of the subreddit i know it's\nshocking chat uh the point of the\nsubreddit is that there are people\nout there who have better and more\nimpactful responses\nthan i do and that's why the subreddit\nexists\nit's a space for people to share awesome\nopinions like this\nright and so it's a space where you guys\ncan support each other you can challenge\neach other\nand like it's not like my word is like\nthe end-all\ni'm allowed to disagree with you and\nthere's sort of like an inherent power\ndynamic right because dr k is saying\nyou're wrong\nbut like i really want to emphasize that\nthis is exactly the kind of discussion\nwe need because i may not like i'm not\nthe arbiter of truth chat\nlike i know a lot but i'm not the\narbiter of truth and what i really love\nabout the subreddit is that a lot of\npeople post\nright a lot of people discuss a lot of\npeople help each other out\nand like they actually do a better job\nof it than i do which is like exactly\nwhat it's there for right we're\nwe're a community that fosters like you\nknow growth of each and every individual\nin the community\nwe're not actually like a dr k says it\nso it must be true community at least i\ndon't think so\nwe joke about memeing about being a cult\nbut i think it's these meta-level\ndiscussions that keep us from becoming a\ncall\nso it's fantastic love the post really\nappreciate this kind of discussion\nokay oh no i don't have water\nokay why don't you guys start reading\nthis and i'm gonna go grab water\nso hgg old heads will remember the\nclassic lectures on the vedic model of\nthe mind\nvata pitta and kapha three doshas okay\nso the first thing to understand is the\nvedic model of the mind is not ayurveda\nthose are different things okay\nbut we'll get to that just a\nclarification\num so vata being like wind the mind\nconstantly bouncing around between\nwhatever grabs its attention\nif a vat that plants 20 20 trees they\nmay succeed at getting all of them to\nblossom\nbut struggle to give anyone enough\nattention to flourish\npitha being like fire burning intensely\non whatever it's\nit it's focused they plant one tree give\nit a constant attention\nand care until they see the fruit and\nthen plant their next tree\nguffa being like earth moving slowly but\ngradually building\ninto something great they might only\never plant one tree but over many years\ncultivate it\ninto something truly magnificent i've\ntried to analyze\nmyself using this framework and i think\ni'm a pretty strong vata kapha hybrid\nwhich i don't believe dr k has ever\ntalked about\ni've always learned new things very\nquickly and on a day-to-day basis i'm\nconstantly bouncing around\nobsessing about whatever grabs my\nattention however over the long term i'm\nvery slow moving resistant to change and\nvery attached to the trees i've planted\ni find myself always coming back to the\nsame handful of things\nimproving them at at them in a short\nburst of time\nmoving on to something else and then\nweeks or months later when the wind\npulls me back sad and disappointed at\nhow i've neglected it\nthis fuels the obsession once again with\nmuch of the\ntime spent playing catch up only to lose\ninterest\nonce i get a feeling of okay i think\ni've made up for the neglect\nbut what about my other trees i'm now\nhesitant to ever commit to something\nentirely new paralyzed by the anxiety of\nletting my oldest trees\nwither and die caught in an endless\ncycle of trying to maintain what i have\nyet feeling like nothing i do will ever\nreach its full potential\nthis affects my relationships my hobbies\nmy responsibilities and my job\nwhat should i do to play into my\nstrengths and mitigate my weaknesses\nwhen there are so many\nwhen they are so naturally in conflict\nbeautiful\nuh beautiful post okay\nnow the lecture\nis about to begin chat\nokay so the first problem\nis that when i teach ayurveda i tend to\nteach it\nas if vatas and kaphas are opposites\nright if we think about wind and earth\nwe sort of think about them as opposites\nbut the truth is that vata and kapha are\nnot opposites they're actually like\nindependent\nokay and the idea that they are\nopposites\num comes from sort of essentially like a\nsimplification of the doshas\nso what we're gonna do is explain\nin more detail how to understand your\ndoshas okay\nso for people who are new let's start\nwith the basics\nokay so ayurveda is a system of medicine\nthat's about 5000 years old\nthat posits that are not all people are\nthe same\nand that each person has an elemental\nbalance\nof three types vata pitta\nand kapha so vata is like the wind\nbit is like fire and kapha is like earth\nokay i know i said five but let's focus\non these three that's another\nsimplification\nso what they sort of noticed is that\nsome people are like the wind their mind\nis very dynamic\nthey learn things very easily they're\nquick studies but they also forget\nthings very easily kind of like the wind\nthey blow really hard in one direction\nand can die down kind of randomly and\nthen they can blow really hard in\nanother direction\na lot of people sort of identify with\nvata especially because our society\nright now is very vatagenic so if you\nlook at things like notifications and\nlike the pace of society\nour minds are becoming more dynamic you\nhave to deal with more stimuli and it's\nlike becoming like\nyou know stimulus overload so all of our\nsociety\nmakes people more vata bitters are like\nfire they're organized they're focused\nthey discriminate which means they tease\napart things\nthey try to really like understand\nprocesses\nand they tend to be like ambitious and\ndriven and focused\nour society currently rewards pittas\nso if you think about school and you\nthink about like promotions and things\nlike that\nso i saw a statistic that if you want to\nearn the highest salary\nyou should move jobs every two years\nthat generally speaking if you stay at\none company for a prolonged period of\ntime\nyour promotion schedule is going to be\nslower than if you hop around\nif you hop around too quickly like\navatar would\nyou won't earn as much and if you stay\naround\ntoo long like a kapha would you won't\nearn as much so\nour society tends to be like very like\nbit the rewarding\nright so we we tend to emphasize and\nreward people who are like ambitious\ndriven focused those are the things that\nwe believe lead to success\nand then you have the kapha types which\nare stable resilient\narguably slow so they're like the earth\nresistant to change hard to move\nbut can be very very dedicated to one\nthing\nso it's really nice to be in a\nrelationship with a kapha person because\nthe kapha person\ngenerally speaking will be able to like\ntolerate a lot of your stuff\nit can be very difficult to be a coffee\nperson because often times you'll stay\nin situations\nlonger than you should because of your\nhigh ability of tolerance\nright so the video gaming analogy that i\nuse for kaphas is like\nif i'm sitting in a pool of acid and i'm\navata i get out of it really really\nquickly because\ni have a low hp pool and if you're a\nkapha you can just kind of tank that\ndamage for a while\nit's like not a big deal and even though\nyou should leave there's not a whole lot\nof like pressure for you to leave\nbecause your ability to\nwithstand is pretty high okay\nso quick uh you know take on doshas\nso what we tend to have is we've got\nvatas\nso the way that it works and this is\ndetermined by our genetics\nis that we have levels of vata pittan\nkapha so let's say here's the baseline\nand any human being based on their\ngenetics will have\nyou know avata that's up here maybe\na pitta that's down here and then maybe\na kapha that's like\nover here okay so these are our natural\nlevels that are genetically determined\nwe've seen good evidence\nevidence of that and then what happens\nso this is called our prakruti\nand then what happens is that based on\nour environment based on our diet based\non other kinds of influential things\nour levels can change and that's called\nour vikrti\nso let's say that my vata level is here\ni\ni force myself to go to a lot of like\nentrepreneurship\nand ambition and networking events so my\npitta is going to be kind of baseline\nand um since i'm sort of in a very\ntechnological society and i don't take\ncare of myself well\nmy kapha is going to actually be reduced\nokay\nso this is called vikrti and vikruti is\nyour current balance\nof your doshik elements that is can be\naltered\nokay so remember that and then what\nhappens is if we kind of look at it like\nlet's say this is the threshold\nfor illness so\nif your vikruti crosses this barrier\nthen you will manifest with illness if\nyour\nvikruti crosses this barrier you will\nmanifest this illness\nso someone earlier was asking about adhd\nso i have a very active and dynamic mind\nand if i'm not careful it gets to the\npoint where like my\nactive and dynamic mind if i cross this\nthreshold with\nwhich it's very easy for me to do i end\nup with\nlike being so vata that it actually\nnegatively\nimpacts my life so like it's nice like i\ncan juggle five balls but if my\nvata like elevates too much and then i'm\njuggling ten balls then i start dropping\nthem left and right\nokay so that is an example of\nuh prakruti which is your genetic basis\nand vikruti which can be changed over\ntime\nokay so this is an overview of vata\nso like for example vata elevations can\nresult\nin adhd or anxiety\nright when you cross the bit the\nthreshold\nyou're going to get angry and you're\ngoing to snap at people and when you\ncross the cuff of threshold you're going\nto be depressed\nokay now the other interesting thing is\nlet's take a look at depression for\nexample\nall right so let's say that here's our\nvata pitta kafa\nand so let's say that i have an\navata person a pit the person\nand a kapha person okay\nand then in each of these three people\nif if their kapha\nelevates over here then i'll get an\nanxious depression if this person's\nkapha elevates to over here\nthen i'll get depression with anger\nattacks and if this person's kapha\nelevates to over here which remember we\ndon't need a whole lot of\nthen this is neuro-vegetative depression\ndo you guys see how that works\nso depression is a kapha imbalance but\ndepending on what your\nprakruti is it will manifest in a\ndifferent way and the really interesting\nthing is that there's decent science to\nsupport this so like we know there are\nthree kinds of\num you know depressions and we don't we\nhaven't quite done the study i actually\npublished a paper about this about\nhow they huh what\nwhat is this why are you talking about\nme\nhack\nweird oh\nwe deleted it all what is happening\nokay let's just start from the top okay\nso um so essentially like depression can\nhappen in any um\nuh in any kind of person and depending\non what kind of person they have\nit'll manifest in a different way okay\nso now what we're gonna do so that's\njust kind of basics of\nayurveda okay so now what we're going to\ndo is we're going to talk about the\nhybrids\nand the way that we're going to high uh\nor talk about the hybrids\nis we're going to actually refer to like\nwork related stuff and this is where\nwe're definitely going to go more\ntowards the framework of introspection\nthere's less science to support this so\nthere's a ton of science to support the\ngenetic stuff\nthere's a decent amount of science to\nsupport the clinical stuff\nand now we're really getting into the\nplace where there's very little signs\nokay\nso i'd say about vatas is that they're\ninnovators\nbut those are organizers\nand kaphas are like structure oriented\nokay so like what avata does is just\nputs random things out there\nwhat a bit that does is take these\nrandom things and like organize them\ninto structure\nokay so like we're going to organize\nthis and what akapha is going to do is\nstart off from the get-go by making\nthings nice\nand structured so like i know it sounds\nkind of weird but like\nthis may sound like the same thing but\nit's fundamentally different like\nyeah i know it sounds kind of weird but\nit just is and we'll we'll explain that\nlater okay\nso let's kind of look at um some\ncombinations now okay\nso if i have a vata bit the person so\nlet's start with a straight vata\nso these people are innovators so they\ncome up with ideas\nbut generally speaking can't see them to\nfruition\nbecause they sort of lack an organizing\ncomponent or structural component\nso like avata can be like a visionary\nokay so like sometimes what what you'll\nhave like sometimes actually ceos can be\nvata\num but generally if they're if they need\nif they're vata so this is the kind of\ncorporate consulting that i'll do\nyou need like a strong bitta or a strong\nguffa is a ceo\nso if you've got a ceo that's vata you\nneed to balance it\nwith a coo that's either bitter or kaffa\nokay and then you may say like okay what\nis avata\nplus pitta so the vata is like the\ninventor\nhey i came up with this cool blockchain\ncool\nthe pit the vata pitta hybrid is\nactually the entrepreneur\nso if you think about it like what's the\ndifference between an innovator\nand an entrepreneur right so like the\nthe entrepreneur is someone who has the\ninnovation capability\nbut also the ability to organize it so\nlike then you can actually like\nstart a company right because you've got\nthat\ncertain amount of ambition you've got\nthat drive you can sort of organize your\ninformation\nthings like that whereas like you know\nif you're a pure vata\nwhat you what you've got is like you're\nthe guy who makes the discovery but you\ncan't\nstart the business and then if we've got\nlike you know\nanother kind of bitter so you also have\nlike people who will\nso for example like the dod kind of does\nthis right where\nthe dod will go around and find\ninventors\nand what they'll do is like they'll take\nthe invention and then they'll like\nturn it into a thing right so you'll\nhave people who will go out and like\npurchase patents they're not the patent\ndeveloper\nright so this is also like another kind\nof entrepreneur but it's sort of like a\nyou know let's call this the patent\npurchaser\nso what they're gonna do is come to\npeople with inventions and we'll help\nyou bring your invention to market\ni'm good at the ambition i'm good at\nlike you know all this stuff\ni'm gonna kind of bring it to market\nwhich is a little bit different because\nwe're not quite\ninnovating and the entrepreneur sort of\ndoes like both of those pieces right if\nyou really look at successful\nentrepreneurs they usually\nyou know do both of the pieces or they\nfind teams\nwhere they can they can supplement like\ntheir weak points\nokay so now let's get to some other kind\nof interesting things so like\num so let's look at\npitta kapha\nokay so the pitta kapha is sort of like\nan analyst\nso what we're gonna do is like look at\nthis organizing\ninformation and we're gonna kind of like\ndevelop a structure based on it\nso like bitter kaphas are like really\nreally good at analyzing data\num so they're good at sort of like you\nknow piecing things together and working\nwell within structure\num the other kind of oh actually sorry\nsorry this is wrong\nthis is actually a kapha pitta so\nremember that you can have a primary and\na secondary\nokay and then a bit the kapha so this is\nthe other point to illustrate\nso is a kapha pitta the same as a bitter\nkapha and i'd say no\nso a pitta kapha is a good strategic\nplanner\nso if you ask yourself like what's the\ndifference between like an analyst and a\nstrategic planner all right so pithas\nare going to kind of organize\ninformation and then sort of develop a\nstrategy going forward\nthey're not just about creating\nstructure for the sake of structure\nthey're sort of like\nyou know like kind of forward thinking\nand they're really good at sort of like\ncreating a structure that we can build\ntowards\nuh kaffa pitta may be a little bit\nbetter in analysis they're not so\nconcerned about forward thinking they're\nreally thinking about okay\nhow can we look at what we have that\nexists and sort of like analyze it and\nsort of like iterate or improve on it\nand i know it's it it sort of sounds\nkind of like this may be overlapping and\nthis is why we really are getting kind\nof away from science\nbut this is just sort of observationally\nlike what i've seen\nokay and now we're going to get to the\ncombo that people are talking about so\nlike what about\na kapha vata so i think kaphavatas excel\nat something like program development\nso what does this mean so if you look at\nprogram development we're going to make\nsomething new it requires some degree of\ninnovation\nbut if you want to develop a program it\nrequires a certain amount of structure\nright like you want the innovation\nbut you really need some kind of\nstructure around it so\nit's kind of interesting but even if you\nlook at like the ayurvedic dosha of like\nthe people who\nyou know wind up in different piece\nplaces within healthy gamer\nlike our strongest program developers\nare like program development people\nactually have a healthy dose of vata and\nkapha\nand so it's really fascinating but when\ni go to a corporation you kind of think\nabout okay what do you need for program\ndevelopment\nyou don't necessarily need ambition what\nyou need is like you're creating\nsomething new so you need\nlike this innovative kind of component\nbut you also need like a structural\ncomponent so i'm actually like\ngood at some aspects of program\ndevelopment and i suck in other aspects\nso i'm really good at sketching out\nideas and coming up with the innovations\nbut i'm very bad at creating the\npolicies and procedures\nthat are based on the innovation so a\nreally strong kapha vata\nis awesome because they can sort of\ninnovate a little bit but they can also\ncreate like the policies and procedures\naround that program when it's new and if\nyou look at something like a more kapha\npitta\nthe kapha pitta will be a lot stronger\nmaybe not quite\ndeveloping them but once we have them\nanalyze them to kind of see what's\nworking and how to improve\nokay so now what i'm going to do\nis is kind of like just touch on you\nknow a couple of other combinations\nand sort of help you all sort of\nunderstand like\nwhat kind of thought processes or\napproaches they have okay\nso let's look at vata pettas so\nlike kind of a spectrum okay so let's\nlook at the vata the vata says\nlet's try it out let's see what happens\nokay this is going to be kind of like\nyou know now we're getting into the what\nharry potter type are you what pokemon\nare you okay\nand then the bit that says let's try it\nout\nand measure it\nokay like let's like organize let's not\njust see what happens\nand rely on intuition\nlet's use analysis\ndo you guys get the difference like some\npeople like i'm like this where\nyou know so we're thinking about how to\nimprove particular things in healthy\ngamer\nbecause it's an ongoing process where\nwe're trying to get better at stuff and\nso my approach is like\ni'm just going to go and like watch\nother coaches\nfor example and that and i'll rely on my\nintuition to tell me like what these\npeople need to do differently\ni'm not going to design a curriculum yet\ni'm going to just go and like watch and\nrely on my intuition\nand vata pittas are like let go ahead\nlet's try it out but let's make sure we\nmeasure it\nokay and what about the pittavata\nso what the pittavata says is let's\nmeasure what we've got\nand see what we should try\nyou guys see the difference here like\nthe difference between a vata pitta and\na pittavata\nokay because there's a huge difference\nlike if you work with\nhuman beings you will see that their\ncognition literally the way their brain\nworks\nis gonna fall into these buckets like\nsome people like i know it sounds weird\nbut like i'm pretty sure\nthat this is scientifically verifiable\nokay\nsome people are more intuitive\nlike their approach to problem solving\nis like\ni'ma show up and i'ma figure it out\nwe'll figure it out we'll figure it out\nand that\npisses some people off so much\nwhat do you mean we're going to figure\nout how are we going to figure it out\nwhat methodology are you going to use to\nfigure it out what do you mean man we're\ngoing to figure it out\nyou can't just show up and figure it out\nwhat if you don't figure it out\nit's infuriating for them other people\nare like a little bit more about like\nanalysis and measurement right\ncool let's give it a shot but let's be\nstructured\nin the way that we're gonna give it a\nshot\nright that's totally fine like let's try\nwhite water rafting let's do a little\nbit of research ahead of time and figure\nout let's do one day of class one rapids\none day of class two rapids and one day\nof class three rapids\nand the vata is just going to show up\nand he's like hey i'm here to white\nwater raft\nlet's go and then the bitter vata will\nbe like okay\nlet me read about let me read about\nclass one rapids class two rapids and\nclass\nthree rapids okay so it seems like class\none you can do if you're nine and older\nand we're all adults\nso actually why don't we try class two\nfirst\nand if we like class 2 or if it feels\ntoo easy for us then we'll try class\n3. you know it's kind of interesting but\nlike i know it sounds weird but\ndifferent humans default\nto these different patterns this is an\nobservation that i am like 99 sure\nif you tested and measured and i'm\npretty sure it has been in some way\nso there's some like um research on\ncarnation for example which sort of like\nverifies some of this stuff um that you\nwill discover that different humans\napproach problems in different ways and\nlike you can just observe that in your\nown life right like\nyou may just be like a hey let's just\nsee what happens kind of person\nand like your partner is sort of like\nlet's organize\nyou know and and then people are going\nto be kind of in the middle\nso what what this sort of indicates is\nthat like when you\nwhen you understand like what you are so\nthis is like what you know\ndifferent combinations of doshas look\nlike\nso it's not just like innovation or\nversus structure it's not like those are\nyou know mutually exclusive they're\nactually like independent things so like\ninnovation plus structure\nand then you kind of wind up with like\nsomeone who's like a good program\ndeveloper\nright so they can innovate but they're\ngoing to create a lot of structure\naround it\num so the next thing that we're going to\ntalk about\nis remember we've got vata\nright and then we've got the upper\nthreshold and the lower threshold\nso remember that vata likes to innovate\nso what happens if your vata is down\nhere\nwhat happens if your pitta is down here\nand what happens if your kapha is down\nhere\nso there is a difference between having\nlow vata\nand high kapha this is not the same\nthese are actually different things so\nwhen we kind of when we simplify it what\nwe say\nis that okay vat like wind and earth are\nopposites\nbut the truth is that you can have a low\nlevel of wind\nor a high level of kapha and those may\nappear to be the same\nbut they're not actually the same they\nmay overlap\nbut in in actuality the more you dig\ninto the details the more you'll see\ntheir like nuanced perspectives here\nso low vatas are\nresistant to change right so you can say\noh\nisn't that a guff of quality like yeah\nsort of but you'll see kind of\ndifferences right um so\nuh lovatas are also tend to lack urgency\none of my favorites okay so like\nthey're not prone to panic easily\nand then they also have um\n[Music]\nyeah so they lack urgency okay so then\nyou've got low kaphas\nright so this person\nand so low kaphas are going to\navoid procedures\nand they're going to fight the system\nright so this is a good example of like\nso\ni have some kapha\nso the interesting thing is that i'm\nwilling to\njump in and innovate that's my\npreference i don't want to develop a\nstructure ahead of time\nbut i'm not necessarily like resistant\nto the system for the sake of being\nresistant to the system\ni will have some resistance to the\nsystem but generally speaking like i\nunderstand and see the value in systems\ni think systems are fantastic i just\ndon't\ncare to develop them myself i'm like\nthat's great you guys build the system\ni think the system is fantastic whereas\npeople who have very very low kapha will\nbe like\nactively resistant to the system because\nremember this is the threshold of\npathology right\nso below this is when we start to see\nnegative\nimpacts so my cough is over here let's\nsay\nand so it's like i still see the value\nof a system i don't need to actively\nfight against it\nbut when if my kapha gets drops kind of\na little bit too low then i'm going to\nbe like screw the system\nthe system sucks i don't want to use a\nsystem i want to be free i want to be\nuncaged\nand that also you can say okay doesn't\nthat sound like very high vata in a\nsense yes there's some overlap\nbut the more you get into the nuance\nthere's a difference between being high\nvata and not\nintuitively building a system\nversus actively resisting the system\ndoes that make sense and then let's talk\nabout lopez\nso um\nso lopez does have little attention to\ndetail\nand tend to not resolve complexities\nthey tend to like keep things\ndisorganized\nso now like you know now it's getting\nkind of interesting right because like\ni thought low vata was the opposite of i\nmean uh high vota was the opposite of lo\nkapha but\ni'm super disorganized and isn't that\nhigh vata\nwell it could be because you know\ndisorganization\nmuch like you know vata kapha like\nthere's a there's a spectrum there right\nand so lopita can actually have a\nspectrum so this low bit that can have a\nspectrum with high kapha\nand a spectrum with high vata you guys\nsee that so it's not like\nthe two are actually opposite which is\nsort of how i teach in a simplistic\nsense\nbut the truth is that like the low level\nof that thing manifests\nin its own way right so like\nand you may even say that you know low\npeople who have like\num very lopita have a pathologic\nand you guys may know people like this\nlack of\nanger right so lope what the\nbit does are not when we think about\nsomeone who is a doormat\nwe may think okay if this person has a\nhigh hp pool and they're a kapha\nand they're like they're not gonna move\neasily maybe they're a doormat\nyou may think okay kapha is like a\ndoormat is a cafe imbalance\nbut being a doormat could be having a\nvery low pitta\nso like you just have a pathologically\nlow level of anger\nand so you let people push you around\nbecause you you're like not ambitious\nright you're you're you have you lack\nyou have too little ambition\nso you don't advocate for yourself you\ndon't fight for the promotion\nand there could be cases of like lopet\nthen high guff in which case the problem\nis exacerbated\num but you could also have you know\nsituations where like their kapha is\nokay and like they're they're bitters\nthey're not like you know their cuff is\nactually within balance and then they're\nreally the pathology is lopita okay\nso this is sort of a more nuanced\nperspective\nand what you really find is that you\nknow human beings if you look at our\ngenetics right\nthe genetics behind vata pita and kapha\nare very complicated so it's not like\nthere's one vata gene one bit the gene\nand one coffee gene there are thousands\nof different or tens of thousands or i\ndon't even know\nreally how many locations are but there\nare tons and tons of locations\ngenes and there are different alleles\nthat may represent different levels of\nvata\nthan kapha and so it's a whole symphony\nof genetic stuff that creates an\nindividual balance\nand in order to try to understand that\nfrom a heuristic perspective which goes\nback to\ncreating the framework there is no such\nthing as vata pitta and kapha it just\ncorrelates with your genes so this is a\nsimplified way of creating a framework\nfor introspection\nbut it does appear to correlate with\nyour actual genes\nso now let's get to how do you determine\nwhat you are\nokay so if i've left somebody all in the\ndust i apologize but\nsorry this is like you really have to\nunderstand the basics\num so\nan ayurvedic physician does not take a\nquiz\nright that's not how they determine bush\nan ayurvedic physician will do an\nactual like complete body and mind\nanalysis\nof a person so for example they will\nlook at your tongue\nand people who are vata dominant have a\nparticular pattern of crap on their\ntongue\nbit the dominant will have a different\npattern of crap and guff\ndominant will have a different pattern\nof crap bittes\nvatas tend to have crooked teeth pithas\ntend to have back teeth that are yellow\nkaphas tend to have like pretty\norganized and straight teeth\nthey will look at your hair right so\nlike pittas will have a receding\nhairline\nand be prone to baldness vatas may have\na full head of hair but their hair will\nbe kinky and wavy\nguffas will have sort of like smooth\nstraight luxurious hair\nthey'll also look at your mental\ntemperament so under stress do you\nrespond\nwhen you're stressed out do you get\nanxious do you get angry do you get\ndepressed\nthat's a component as well they'll also\nlook at things like your stools because\nthe digestions of people are different\nvatas tend to be prone to hard stool and\ncomplicate\nuh constipation guffas will lay out\nreally solid logs that can be like kind\nof a little bit\non the wetter side but this can have\nkind of like watery stools mucousy\nstools things like that\nso it's kind of interesting like there's\nall kinds of different correlations\nright and if you think about what the\nayurvedic physicians were doing\nand it sort of makes sense right because\nyour genes are going to affect a lot of\ndifferent processes\nso you have like a gene that's active in\nthe mitochondria\nand so if it affects your mitochondrial\nfunction\nthe result of that mitochondria in a\ngastrointestinal cell\nwill create one effect in a lung cell\nwill create a different effect\nand in your brain will create a third\neffect and your skin will create a\nfourth effect\nwhich is how we get to the fact that\nlike they correlate\nvata with skin stool\nright because this remember that there's\nthis is a genetic basis so it's not\norgan system dependent our our system of\nscience\nin the west is very organ system\ndependent we think about the liver as\nbeing completely separate from the heart\nbut if you go on a deeper level and you\nlook at the genetic level\nthere may be some kind of metabolic\neffects which are\nat the cellular or genetic level which\nwill manifest\nin different ways depending on which\norgan you're looking at and that's\nliterally what ayurvedic physicians do\nit's fascinating okay\nso how do you determine your dosha a\nreal ayurvedic physician will look at\nall of these things\nbut one of the key things that they do\nwhich works really well is pulse\ndiagnosis\nso we're going to teach you this today\nokay\nso what they'll do is look at your pulse\nand your pulse has a lot more\nthan rate and rhythm to it according to\nthe ayurvedic physicians\nwhat they claim is that you can actually\nmake\ncorrelations between your pulse and your\ndosha\nso i know it sounds kind of weird but\nwe're going to teach all this today so\nlike\nthis is what i want you to do i want you\nto take your left hand\nand i want you to take three fingers so\nin ayurveda they say that\nthe pulse should be checked in men on\nthe right wrist\nand in women on the left wrist i don't\nreally know why\nbut we're gonna i'm gonna just teach you\nguys right wrist i don't know what\nhappens if you're transgender\ni don't know um so we're going to take\nthree fingers\nokay so you have your index finger\nyour middle finger and your ring finger\nand what we're gonna do\nis place it on the radial\nartery which is right here okay so what\nyou're gonna find i don't\nlike this is like you're gonna be able\nto feel your like you guys know how you\ncheck your pulse right here\nright you feel over here\nokay and you should be able to check\nyour pulse so the first thing that we're\ngoing to do and this is going to be our\nmeditation for the day okay\nis i want you guys to be able to feel\nyour pulse at your radial artery with a\nsingle finger or right hand facing up\nokay so\nfeel around a little bit so what you'll\nfeel is there's a bone right here\nlet me see if i can there's a bone right\nhere and right to the left\ni mean sorry yeah to the left of the\nbone\non your right hand is going to be where\nyou can feel the pulse\nyeah move a little bit more proximal so\nmove towards the elbow\nokay\nfull screen the bone okay\nlet's see if we can find you guys\nokay\nso here's your radial artery here's the\nradius\nand the bone that you're going to feel\nis probably the\nhead of the radius which is right here\nso this\nbump is what you're going to feel is the\nbone and the the radial artery is right\nnext to it\nokay let me see if i can find another\nhere we go\noh jesus okay\nso here's the\nconventional radial artery i suppose\nright so it's like right here so it's\nkind of like below your thenar eminence\nso this fat part of your thumb\ni've it's been a while guys i'm a\npsychiatrist so i don't do a whole lot\nof anatomy\nbut if you know medical school 11 years\nago\nrusty then our eminence and if you kind\nof go\nbeneath the thenar eminence right on the\nleft side\nlike at the end of the thenar eminence\nso if you look at my hand\nlike right here like below this is the\nradial artery you guys see\nlike this is my thenar eminence\nand then you kind of go below it okay\ni know chat listen i didn't say today\nwas gonna be easy\nokay or this is for advanced people\nokay so what we're gonna do is and\nonce you find the the\nthe radial artery then what we're gonna\ndo is we're gonna take three fingers and\nwe're going to put them kind of next to\neach other\nand then what i want you guys to do is\npress on your radial artery so that you\ncan feel\nall three so you can feel the pulse\nunder all three fingers\nand what you're going to need to do is\nprobably press a little bit harder on\nthis finger\nsorry like harder on this finger like a\nlittle harder on the middle finger and\nthen this finger can be quite light\nso you're actually going to press down\nlike this\nso the least pressure over here a little\nbit more pressure over here\nand the most pressure over here okay\nand then what i want you to do is pay\nattention\nto the feeling of your pulse\nand what you'll see is that it's not\nuniform\nacross all three\nokay don't need to apply lube\ndon't press too hard just press press\njust enough to feel it\nokay and what you'll discover\ni'll show you guys in a second what\nyou'll discover\nis\nthat the pulse is not uniform so one\nperson\nmay have a pulse like this\none person may have a pulse like this\none person may have a pulse like this\nand so actually when people were teach\npulse diagnosis\nwhat they equate it to is animal gait\nso there's a rabbit pulse there's an\nox pulse there is a goat pulse\nthere's a deer pulse there's a horse\npulse\nand what they're essentially doing is\nfinding these different patterns\nof pulsation right so or your pulse\ncould be like this\nand so what i want you all to do for a\nfew seconds is just close your eyes\nand see snake pulse is actually one of\nthem\nand see if you can feel the pulse\nright and this is where you may say oh\nokay but like it feels the strongest\nwith my ring finger\nand so if you press down a little bit\nthat's why we're going to alter the\npressure\nand the pressure really shouldn't affect\nthe pulse i know it sounds bizarre\num just like other bizarre things did\nyou know that\nhow hard you breathe out how forcefully\nyou exhale does not\naffect the length of your exhalation\nit's crazy\num you exhale the same the same distance\nevery breath\nno matter how hard you breathe a lot of\nweird things about the body that the\nyogis discovered\nso just close your eyes and feel the\npulse right feel where you feel it\nand you may also notice that not every\nbeat is the same\nokay\nso the um i'm not sure if this is\nactually correct but\ni'm using my ring finger on top like\nclosest to the edge of my hand so the\nring finger is closest to the thenar\neminence in your palm\nso it goes so\nokay yeah\nso this is how i'm doing it this is the\nring finger right and this is\nthe hand so you can also do i mean you\ncould do it like this but i'm i'm doing\nit like this\nit's hard to show oh my god how can i\nshow this\nthere we go if that can see that that's\nhow i'm doing it\nokay\nso\nyou know it's kind of weird i i get it's\na weird experience\nso in terms of the meditation technique\nhere's\nhow we can sort of use it as a dot or\nnot right so\nwe don't know i mean i i'm not qualified\ni don't know pulse diagnosis\nso i've i've met some ayurvedic\nphysicians for example that can diagnose\npregnancy\nimpulse diagnosis it is wild\num and and so it's it's it's bizarre\nlike they can accurately diagnose\npregnancy through pulse diagnosis which\nsounds unbelievable\num but uh\nyou know i don't know pulse diagnosis\num but i i do think that it can be a\nuseful kind of like meditation right so\nit's\nhard enough so like remember that the\ngoals of a toddler are to bring your\nattention to the present\nand sort of to be able to detect subtle\nthings so you may notice that you know\nin order to really feel the pulse you\nhave to find the right balance your\nyour fingers have to push just as much\nas you want them to to feel it\nand that um uh you also\nneed to concentrate right like if your\nmind is distracted you're not going to\nbe able to feel the subtle nuances\num\nyeah so how how do we diagnose sardosha\nso essentially these different patterns\nwill result in different doshas so i\nforget exactly what it is but i think\nmaybe\nthe um the vata pulse\nis closest to the so if you have the the\nstrongest spike\nis near the wrist your dominant if it's\nin the middle your bit the dominant and\nif it's\ndeeper in your cuff if it's closest to\nyour shoulder it's kapha dominant it\ncould be wrong it's one one way or the\nother\nbut i think that's just a very simple\nthing i i think the real people who\nunderstand pulse diagnosis will look at\nthat pattern\nand based on the pattern of the three\nthings they'll determine your dosha\nnow the tricky thing there is that if\nyou look at it anatomically\nthe radial artery is the most\nsuperficial closest to the palm which\nmeans that just like\nbased on anatomy you're gonna everyone\nis gonna feel\nthe strongest pulse in uh closest to the\npalm\nso everyone will diagnose themselves as\nvata but and that's why you have to\nlearn how to press\nwith more force to balance\nthe depth of the tissue\nright so yeah\nand that's pulse diagnosis so the the\nquestion of okay how do i determine\nmy dorsha we can give you questionnaires\nlike so\nto my knowledge no questionnaire has\nactually been like scientifically\nvalidated\nin a very rigorous way\num you know actual physicians will use\ndifferent kinds of like features and\nthey'll sort of be able to tell\nso i'm like pretty decent at diagnosing\npeople as like mata pete and kaffa\num but you know my system has to do a\nlot with like bone structure\nthe prominence of veins on the back of\nyour hand\nalso will determine your dosha\nso like all of those factors then you'll\nkind of see okay this person is like six\npredominantly vata predominantly fit the\npredominantly kapha\nand i do believe that in our lifetime we\nwill have\nhopefully personalized genetic tests\nwhich will tell you what your dosha is\nright so things\nso it's hard to see but\nso like if you look at the veins i guess\nit's hard to see this way but\num or actually just look at look at the\nmy tendons you guys see how my tendons\nare very visible when i flex my hand\nlike my hand is like thin so like you\ncan see the tendons like popping out\nright like this so that's like it's a\nvery vata hand\nbecause there's not like flesh or tissue\nover it\nthose are tendons but it's hard to see\non camera with the veins\noh man i wish i could hear let me just\nshoot this\nso hard to see you guys see that\nthat's about the hand\nit's hard because i have to hold up my\nhand\nand then when i hold it up the veins\nstart to\nsink in a little bit right so like\nyou'll have like\nthickness of different people's like\nhands like some people like you won't\nthey won't stick out\nright and so if we think about it um\nso so it's complicated because remember\nthat the whole point so once you\nonce we recognize that ayurveda\ncorrelates with your genetics your genes\nare in\nevery cell and therefore your your dosha\nwill manifest in each part of your body\nor your being right and so depending on\nwhich\nalleles are at which locations that's\nwhat will manifest in a particular\nlike cell so even my mind is\npredominantly vata\nbut i absolutely have some degree of\npitta and\nemotionally i'm very kapha so it's\ninteresting because like emotionally\nlike i don't get\nupset easily i thought that was due to\nmy yogic training\nbut i recently spoke with an ayurvedic\ncolleague from mind and she's like no\nyou're actually like it's not your\nit's not the yogic training you're just\nemotionally cough i was like damn\nthat's interesting so it's interesting\nright because each of these dimensions\neach aspect of your body your teeth your\nbone structure\nyour hair your eyes um so even like the\namount\nof eyelid over the iris of your eye\neffect is correlated with your dosha\nyour stool\nyour your digestion your hunger all of\nthat stuff correlates with ayurveda\nso we've got a time for a couple things\nso we can do\ntwo options one is i can teach all a\nlittle bit about conflict\nbetween different doshas um\nand or what we can do is uh\noh so another just simple example or\nwhat we can do is just answer questions\nand i'm leaning towards\nanswering questions um\nwhat did i want to say i wanted to say\nsomething oh yeah and the other thing is\nmetabolism oh my god metabolism is so\nclearly there are three buckets of\npeople right so like\nif you guys have heard the terms um\nectomorph endomorph and mesomorph these\nlike this is people have noticed that\nthere are big boned people\nand people with fast metabolisms and you\ncan feed both people the same stuff\nand they like one will not gain weight\nand one will gain weight\nright so this is something that we've\nlike observed in like there's been\nscience\nscientific exploration of the three\nmetabolic types which is like\nyeah i've just been saying that for\nthousands of years\nokay okay let's do questions\nokay what questions let me see actually\nreal quick um\nwhat about vatakapha\nokay\nso people with high metabolisms are vata\nis generally speaking yes\nso remember when we say arvatas\nany one part of your body does not\ndetermine your dosha right like so the\ndoshik determinant\nis based on all the aspects of your body\nso you may have\navata metabolism but may have like a\nkapha mind\nor like you know bit the veins\nso the way that we determine is that\nlike you know the more\nthe greater percentage of your genes\nthat are vata\nthe higher number of vata features\nyou'll have\ndoes that make sense\nuh you missed scafavata what do you mean\ni missed scuff i thought we talked about\nprogram development\nso like that's a good example of um\nwhat okay so if you guys want to\nunderstand of vata kapha so remember\nthat there\nare different dimensions of it okay so\nlike\num you know your metabolism or bone\nstructure so i've seen this a lot where\nyou'll have\nkapha body types with vata mines so like\nyou can be\nbig boned and have really really bad\nadhd\nright it's not like everyone who's big\nboned has depression\nyou can have really bad anxiety and and\nbe big boat\num so there's absolutely like vata kapha\nhybrids uh i even said myself like so\nemotionally i'm very kapha where like\nit's hard to get me\nto be really upset so i tend to be like\npretty tranquil in that way\nbut i my mind is all over the place um\nin terms of what's the counterpart\nto the dev\noh oh what's oh i see so so the the\nkapha vata\nis a program developer and let me think\nabout avatar\num\nso i'd say like a vata kapha is like\nan innovator who also like uses a lot of\nstructure\nso not necessarily organizing but like a\navatar kapha maybe someone who is very\nstructured\nin the way that they innovate for\nexample\nright so even if you look at researchers\nso there are different kinds of\nresearchers right there are researchers\nwho will\nform hypotheses based on intuition\nand there were researchers who will form\nhypotheses based on data\nso i'll go to an academic medical center\nand talk to a research lab\nand you know we'll see like vata kapha\nconflicts within the lab\neven though everyone's a researcher\nso i i think that like you know the vata\nkapha which one did i talk about yeah so\ncoffee vata will be like a program\ndeveloper\nand like avata kaffa will be someone\nwho's like structurally focused or even\nlike\ntools or methodology focused but still\nbe like innovating\nso they may be all about so even like\nthis\nyou know so i think if you wanted to\ndevelop a system of ayurvedic\npersonality analysis\ni think avatar kapha would be a really\ngood person for it\nright because they're they're going to\nbe thinking a little bit about how do i\ncreate this structure\nfor systematically assessing\na relatively new concept\ndoes that help do animals have doshas\nyes\nso this is the other interesting thing\nayurvedic physicians are veterinarians\nthere's no difference\nit's neat\nthey'll prescribe medicine to pet snakes\nthey'll treat cows for illness\nno difference they're trained in it i\ndon't know about nowadays but\nhistorically\nlike if you go to like indian villages\nright and there's like a village doctor\nthey will treat your goat and they will\ntreat your child\nif you kind of think about it right like\ni mean like i was thinking about doing a\nlittle bit of veterinary\nmedicine you know doing a little pet\ntherapy we prescribe ssris apparently to\nlike dogs with anxiety now\nright part of my therapy practice is\ncats\nthey show up for their hourly\nappointment once a week\nyou know i sit down they lay down on the\nfreudian couch we do a little bit of\npsychoanalysis\nthey feel better about themselves it's\ngreat\npet therapy is a thing chat as is pet\nantidepressant and anti-anxiety\nmedication\nso probably within our lifetime we'll\nalso see veterinary psychiatrists\nright because you can actually diet you\ncan diagnose there\nare dogs who are on ssris\nbecause if you think about it you know\nwhat's really like so if you know\nif i if a dog has a staph infection and\ni have a staph infection antibiotics is\nboth of it like we know that dogs get\ncancer right like we know that dogs get\nheart disease\nit's interesting yeah someone's like my\nmom's dog takes prosthetics yeah it\nblows my mind but\nah what about people who have the same\namount of each dosha\nso there are that's a great great\nquestion so this is where\nonce again not really scientifically\nbased now okay but more from corporate\nconsulting\nyou all may notice that there are people\nin your social circles or group projects\nor whatever who are essentially like\nmediators and they'll kind of like tap\ninto whatever is deficient so\nyou know like like the the three doshik\nperson\nis the bard from d and d they do a\nlittle bit of everything\nthey're not the best caster they're not\nthe best warrior they've got a couple of\nthief skills\nand i think even in 5 5e they can even\ncast a little bit right they've got some\nlike divine spells and some like\narcane spells so like there are people\nlike that\nlike in your social circles there will\nbe like you know the one person who\norganizes your parties\nand when that person isn't around\nsomeone steps up there's the one person\nwho's sort of like the sympathetic\nlistener and good friend and when\nthey're\nwhen that not when they're not around\nthis other person steps up they're sort\nof the druids\nfrom wow right like i've got cat druid\ni've got bear form i've got healing\ndruid and i've got moonkin\ni can change shape and sort of tap into\nwhatever role is necessary\nand and some people may think well isn't\nthat what you want and the answer is\nlike not really because if you get\nyou know a bunch of druids you're not\ngoing to get like if you have a party\nfull of bards\nlike it's not necessarily more effective\nor even as\neffective as like a party where you've\ngot like a fighter a wizard a cleric and\na rogue\nright sometimes you want specialization\nand sometimes you want\nthe glue that gets all the pieces to\nstick together\nright so when someone's saying no dps no\nlike bards can do some dps\nright so try dorsi people can do\neverything to a decent degree\nbut you know i don't know that they'll\nbe like\nbrilliant you know in innovators\nor develop the best structure they kind\nof supplement they're kind of hybrid\nclasses\nyeah jack of all trades master of none\nis the tradoship person\nso the the reason that i call them\nmediators the the real benefit\nof of um tridoshik people\nis not so much in the highs it's\nactually in the absence of lows that's\nwhat makes them so good on a team\nthey're like you know the lubricant for\nthe team\nbecause the tridoshik people are not\nresistant\nto change they're not resistant to\nstructure and they're not resistant to\nlike\norganization so like they don't get into\ntrouble with anyone\ni mean they can still be you know like\nmean and stuff\nbut they don't have like the the\nworkplace kind of conflicts\nwhere so like we have this all the time\nwe're like you know i'm vata so one of\nthe biggest\nchallenges here at hg is like i will\nhave an idea\nand i will say like hey chat let's do\nthis and then everyone's like oh my god\nnow we actually have to make that happen\nand there's a whole team that's like you\ncan't go around\njust promising things to chat because we\nhave to make that happen\num and so you know there are advantages\nand disadvantages of each one and a lot\nof our conflict and a lot of our\nconflict resolution\nhas been figuring out like how i can\nwork with the more bit the people and\nhow i can work with the more kapha\npeople\nwhich i absolutely need because you all\nmay know this but if you have a party\nfull of vatas it's like\neveryone's got brilliant ideas and\nnothing ever gets done\nis laziness tied to dorsa not really\nso this is where you know there's\nanother concept which we haven't really\nexplained which is\ngunas\num so i think we're gonna actually talk\na little bit about this maybe on monday\nuh but we're gonna give you guys a\nslightly different perspective on\nmotivation\nso we think about laziness as a trait\nright it's an aspect of your personality\nso like a person is lazy we don't think\nabout laziness\nas a fluctuating state in our conception\nbut in in reality it absolutely is\nright there are some days that you're\nmore lazy than other days\nand so what that actually comes down to\nthe best explanation of the\nstate of laziness which i think western\nscience is very poor at like we don't\nlike you know we think about laziness\nin terms of things like five factor\nmodel where it's like high\nconscientiousness or low\nconscientiousness\nit's an aspect of your personality\nwhereas like all you have to do to be\nless lazy or more lazy is change your\ndiet you all know this like if i eat\nsix slices of pizza and have a couple\nbeers what happens to my motivation\nright whereas if i'm like eating food\nthat's healthy if i start to exercise\nthings like that\ni'm gonna feel more motivated and that\nhas to do with a concept in\nin kind of eastern thinking called the\ngunas so there are three gunas there's a\nsattvas rajas and tamas sattvas is the\nquality that makes us\nbalanced and clean rajas is the quality\nthat makes\nus active and passionate and tamas is\nthe\nquality that makes us dull and inert\nand our society is overwhelmingly has\nthompsic influences\nand vata influences so as a society\nwe are over where our vata is elevated\nand our thomas is elevated so we tend to\nbe like\na little bit like it's hard for us to do\nstuff\nand if we look at things like twitter\nthe primary twitter is very rajsic\nso like twitter like gets people riled\nup right it doesn't make people\ncalm it gets people like kind of riled\nup\nand so in the ayurvedic treatment of\ndepression part of that is if you've got\na thumb sick disturbance you actually\nwant to\nengage rajas first so you want to bring\nout people's activity and passion\nand once you have a nice balance between\ninertia and passion\nthen you can become calm\nso anyway we'll talk more about this on\nmonday\nlast questions\nwill there be a stream on more spiritual\nstuff like karma absolutely\nso this is the challenge that we have i\ndon't know what y'all thought about this\ni guess\nokay so not that low but so here's the\nchallenge with stream is i can teach\nthis advanced stuff about ayurveda and\nlike i don't know\nwhat percentage of people will be left\nbehind\nso the real challenge on stream is that\npeople come in and out\nand that a lot of people may not have\nthe sufficient prereqs\nthis is why it is hard to teach advanced\nor newest nuanced concepts on stream\nso this is why we like do things like\ninterviews and q a because we all start\nin the same place like\nwhen someone shows up on stream i have\nno idea what they're going to talk about\nand so we're all starting together which\nmakes it a good experience for everyone\ninvolved\nin terms of q a we're also starting\ntogether right\nwe all see the question and i'm gonna\nanswer it so we're all in the same place\num when it comes to advanced concepts\nwhat we're doing so i'd say like you\nknow did you understand this if you guys\nwatch\nstream on wednesday did you understand\ni guess that more people would be\nyou know in the yes column um\nand yeah so people come in later are\nscrewed right so\nthat's that's where if we think about\nadvantages and disadvantages of stream\nstream is a very like vata oriented\nplatform right it's live it's dynamic\nthere's interaction chat is spamming you\nduring streaming\npeople are coming in people are going\nout it's very different from a lecture\nthat has a start time\nand so like there are some kinds of\nteaching which work better in vata\nenvironments\nright like socratic teaching works\nreally well i can ask you all questions\nyou can ask me questions\nit's live it's organic it's it's fun and\nthen\nthat's why we made dr k's guide because\nit's not ideal for everything so\nif you guys want to learn about mantra\nand spirituality and stuff like that you\nhave to start at the\nthe basics what is the nature of the\nuniverse because unless you understand\nthe nature of the universe\nhow a mantra works is is going to be\nlike you're going to be missing\nsomething right\num if you want to understand karma like\nokay what is like what are the\nassumptions of like the meditative world\nview like how does\nhow do the yogis view the world and then\nyou can understand karma\nif you want to understand things like\nspiritual experience\nlike you have to understand like okay\nwhat is a spiritual experience it\ndepends on what a person is\nwhat the what the world is what the\nuniverse is then you can understand the\nspiritual experience in the right\ncontext\num so i think that's kind of the\nchallenge so i think for a lot of these\nquestions and\nthis is what we try to do so you know we\nmade a guide because it's start to\nfinish\nit's a ton of start to finish\ninformation about ayurveda\nuh the challenge on stream is we've been\ntalking for two hours and i haven't\ngiven anyone a solution yet because it's\nlike hard to do every like i can't do\neverything on stream\nand the problem with doing everything on\nstream you're like yeah but like you can\nbut not really because\nif someone's coming into stream now and\ni start giving solutions and they\nhaven't heard the first two hours\nthey're going to have even no idea what\nwe're talking about\nso the effective way to um\nyou know teach like sort of depends like\nwe want to use stream for particular\nthings\ndr k's guide is like it's going to we're\ngoing to explain what ayurveda is\nkind of like we did today but we also\ndon't want to restrict that information\nto dr k's guide right so we\ntaught advanced concepts of ayurveda so\nlike there are things that we taught\ntoday that aren't in dr k's guide\nso i encourage you all to you know like\ncheck out the guy like look at the intro\nto ayurveda\nwe also have a lot of dietary guidance\nand things like that where we'll tell\nyou\nokay dr k great i am avata kapha and i'm\nout of balance what do i do about it\nthat's going to be in dr k's guide\nand if you buy dr k's guide and you kind\nof check it out and then you're kind of\nwondering like okay what how can i\nunderstand like\nthese dorsi balances like come back and\nand watch this youtube video\nuh the tentative drop date is august\n18th\nsomeone's been asking what do i think\nabout homeopathy so\ni think homeopathy has less biological\nplausibility\nthan ayurveda uh there's a reason why i\nchose to study ayurveda instead of\nhomeopathy\nthe clinical evidence is like mixed um\ni i i don't put a whole lot of stock\ninto it\nit's kind of bizarre but there is some\nclinical evidence behind it but the\nthe scientific plausibility is just\nreally makes no sense\nwhich doesn't mean that it isn't true it\ncould mean that we don't really\nunderstand\nas much right so for thousands of years\nor like not thousands of years but\nyou know 60 years ago medical\nprofessionals did not\nunderstand the mechanism they didn't see\na way in which meditation could be used\nas a treatment for depression\nthey didn't understand i don't\nunderstand like you have to talk to\npeople's feelings to make them feel\nbetter\ni don't understand how sitting down and\nchanting om for 30 minutes\nis going to help someone's depression\nthere's no like psychology freud would\nhave been confused right because he's\nlike\nwhere's the edible complex where's the\noral phase where's the anal phase\nwhere's the phallic phase\nit's an understanding of these things\nand dealing with these issues that helps\nyou treat depression\nhow on earth could sitting there\nenchanting something for 30 minutes\ntreat depression so just because science\ndoes not\nunderstand something does not mean it is\nnot real\num it just means that we don't\nunderstand it which is something that\nscientists tend to forget a lot right so\nthere's like a camp of people who say\nthat\nthere once something becomes verified it\nbecomes medicine and therefore\nmedicine is defined as what works\nand if it is not medicine then it is\nalternative medicine and alternative\nmedicine doesn't work\nonce you study something you once you\nstudy alternative medicine and you\nverify that it works\nit becomes medicine therefore medicine\nis defined by what works so this is\na common argument for people who are\nlike kind of anti-alternative medicine\nright\nthey're like medicine is what works and\nso my question is if we go back a\nhundred years\nand people were meditating for\ndepression is it a part of medicine\nor not because we have no scientific\nevidence that it works\nso then it's not a part of medicine\nright and then the question becomes\nif it's not a part of medicine did\nmeditation help people with depression\n100 years ago\nthe answer to that question is yes which\nthen means that\nalternative medicine works so like the\nwhole argument kind of falls apart\nso this is where we kind of when we go\nback to homeopathy like i don't see a\nwhole lot of biological plausibility\ni don't think that the treatments the\nevidence that i've seen for homeopathy\nis not as strong as it is for ayurveda\nlike for example\nyou know ashwagandha is an ayurvedic\nherb that has been shown to\num you know clear beta amyloid which is\none of the things that causes\ndementia from the brain and like\nayurvedic folks have been using\nashwagandha for like neurological health\nand psychological health for\nthousands of years and so we have like\nscientific verification of their methods\nwhereas the problem with homeopathy for\nthose of you who don't know is they like\ndo serial dilutions\nso what they do is like they'll i'm\ngonna take like you know a drop of\nashwagandha and put it in a hundred\ndrops of water\nand shake it around so dilute the\nashwagandha\nto be like one part in a hundred and\nthen i'm going to take one drop of that\nsolution\nand put it in another vial of water so\nthen it's going to be like\n1 in 10 000 and then i'm going to take\none drop of that dilute solution\nand i'm going to put it in another\nsolution and then it's going to be like\none part per million of the biological\ncompound and then they administer that\nas medicine\nand claim that there's a therapeutic\nbenefit so there are some trials that\nshow that homeopathic remedies are\neffective like i've seen\nyou know homeopathic remedies for you\nknow like\num you know i reviewed a paper about\nhomeopathic remedies for\nuh benign\nprostate hyper hyperplasia\nbph and it seemed like their stuff\nwas effective like people saw a\nreduction in symptoms and it seemed like\nit worked\nit's just i don't understand the\nbiological plausibility so i think the\nevidence is not as strong\ni don't think that the biological\nplausibility is really there\nso you know\nany tips for pitta kaphas yeah so when\nit comes to tips so this is where\nthere's like a whole other section right\nso like the next phase of this is like\nconflict resolution and like tips and\nunderstanding your dosha and stuff like\nthat so for pitta kaphas\nyou know the the biggest gap that you\nhave is in terms of like\ninnovation and being dynamic right so\nthe conflict that you're gonna have is\nwith people who are more dynamic than\nyou are\nwho like wanna d so like the the\nstrategic plan or the pitta\nokay i'm going to look at the data i'm\ngoing to organize it when i come up with\na plan we're going to stick to the plan\nso the biggest problem that betha's run\ninto\nis that once they've gone through their\nprocess it's really hard to get them to\nchange\nand sometimes they can become too\nattached to their ideas\nright like once we've got a plan like\ndon't disturb it\neven if it's bad and the vata is over\nthere saying bro this isn't working\nbro this isn't working bro this isn't\nworking we see this in corporations\nall the time okay so like we see this\nwith\num like i think a lot of these\ncatastrophic failures with\ncorporations are like\nclassic examples of like bitter kaffa's\ngone wild so what you'll have is like\nyou'll have a corporation that goes\nthrough a lot of investment\nto come up with a plan like we're gonna\nlaunch\ncoke 2.0 and then like each step of the\nway\nthere are people who are like or\nactually you know maybe like cyberpunk\nis another good example\nso like i i don't actually know because\ni don't know the inside of\nuh you know cd projekt red but like\nsometimes you'll have these catastrophic\nlaunches right\nand then everyone's scratching there\nsitting there and like asking themselves\nhow could this company that does such a\ngood job\nlaunch such a catastrophic\ncreate such a catastrophic mess and what\nhappens\nis that all along the way you've got\nthe bit the kapha energy which is like\nhere's our strategy\nwe did a good job we did our due\ndiligence we hired consultants\nthey said it was going to be okay let's\nmove forward\nand then as they move down the process\nthere are vata people in the company who\nare like\nhey i think we need to change things hey\ni think we need to change things\nhey like the data that we're getting is\nactually not great\nhey this is not going well\nbut the energy of the company is pitaka\nso like this is the plan we strategized\nit we're sticking to it\nthese are the naysayers this person is\nin align with our vision\nthis person isn't going to get promoted\nright because they're like all these\npromotion kind of things where like even\nif you know that something's wrong you\ncan't be\nlike it's like absolutely kill the\nmessenger\nso you no one wants to be the messenger\nand some guy at the top is like\nthis is my vision it's gonna increase\nprofits 20 percent\nand the board is like do it\nand then what happens is they go back\nand they tell their their employees\nthey're like\ninstitute my vision and everyone's like\nyes\nand then they ask how are things going\nand then the manager\ngoes to the associate and he's like hey\ndon't tell anyone that everything is a\n[ __ ] mess it'll disrupt the plan\npeople won't like it\nkill the messenger so we're just gonna\nsay\neverything's okay and then\nthere were a thousand things in\nhindsight that went wrong and the ceo at\nthe top is like this is going to be\ngreat because everyone's thinking\ntelling me it's going to be great\ncatastrophic failure\nand then the ceo is like how could this\nhappen how could y'all let this happen\ni was told everything was okay i was\ntold everything was going to be great\nand it's because there's no room for\nthat vata energy with strategic planning\ngone\nthat strategic planning gone wild\nright so the tip is to be aware that\nyou can invest a lot into your strategic\nplan\nand listen to people that piss you off\nwhen they say hey maybe this is not a\ngreat idea\nthat is the tip for pithakafas listen to\npeople who piss you off\nokay\nso someone's asking why do vatas have a\ntendency to make jokes all the time or\nis it just me so there are multiple\nlayers of this question\nright so we can take a western\npsychology process\ni love this question it's such a great\nquestion we can take a western\npsychology perspective and we can say\nyou make jokes because it's a defensive\nmechanism you have difficulty tolerating\ninternal negative emotion so we're gonna\nlighten the mood and you can't sit with\ntension\nso we're gonna make a joke is a defense\nmechanism the defense mechanism can be\npersonal in your head\nor it can even be a defense mechanism in\nthe group\nright that's why we make jokes there's\nan ayurvedic perspective\nwhy do vatas make more jokes because\nvata's minds are bouncing all over the\nplace so vatas tend to be witty\nand even if you look at different\ncomedians right like you can see the\nvariance of doshas within different\ncomedians\nsome comedians are like have a very\nclear vision of where they're starting\nand where they're ending\nand they make it seem casual but it's\nvery well crafted\nsome uh you know comedians are\nvery kapha right so they'll even be like\nsuper like\nstructured um and which may sound a\nlittle bit like bit the comedians but\nthen you'll have vata comedians who are\nlike\nyou know they're the ones like some\ncomedians will laugh\nregularly at their own jokes before they\nhit the punch line\nthey'll lose it on stage right so\nthere's a touch of the vata in terms of\nlike the\ndynamicness and the wittiness the\naudience participation\nyou know\nso so dave chappelle\ni can't comment on individual people so\ni'm gonna steer clear of that\nah so when they say old dave chappelle\nis vata like that's very\nsmart right because dave chappelle's his\ncomedy has changed it's evolved\nright and then like like i think uh\nmitch hedberg\nhas a very i'm not going to comment on\nwhat he is but if you all know mitch\nhedberg\nhe has a very vatakapha style of comedy\nright like it's kind of like random ass\nthoughts\nbut actually like really like chill and\nstructure\nhe's not really witty but it's like\nreally random\ni don't know who my [ __ ] is can you\nbecome more pita kaffa if you're vata\nabsolutely so remember that\nyou can lower your vata and you can\nincrease your pitta and kapha\nthrough particular exercises and diets\noh god\ngg get wrecked get wrecked dr k\noh [ __ ] oh man i did not i did not\nexpect that that's good\nchat that's good\nokay so last thing that we're gonna do\nis our boy or girl i don't know what\nthe gender is our homie\ntramrant one of the\ngreatest meme lords of the internet has\nmade another video\nso now that we've owned dr k we can just\nyou guys can just you know\nwe can just stick with that theme okay\nhere we go i don't think it's like an\nissue\ni don't think it impairs your function i\ndon't think it's a problem\ni'm perfect the problem's you okay\nmaybe so the first thing is\nare you stupid i i wouldn't know\nthat makes you stupid is that a bad\nthing everyone's like how can this\nperson be so stupid\noh wow i didn't realize things were that\nbad okay\n[ __ ] dumb oh my god can i just think\nfor a second and try to figure out how\nto say this\nwhat are you what are you thinking right\nnow i just uh i forgot\nlike that's what you can't even remember\nwhat you were talking about now yeah\ni forgot give me a second all you're\ndoing\nis opening and closing your [ __ ] eyes\nwhat do you mean by that\nit's not going to alter wildly in the\nspan of 90 seconds whether you're doing\nthis\nor doing this um so what can i do\nwhat should i do what do you think\ni mean yeah i don't even know what to\nthink about that i don't know either so\ncan i think for a second\nyeah oh my god\nthis actually sounds like a conversation\nlike a real conversation\noh my god what was that ooh\nthat was epic oh my god i cannot okay\nwhat do you struggle with\nyou are a yo no quiet youtube\nokay yeah let's send you the link so i\ndon't know if you all know this but you\nknow we have\ntons oh god am i lagging what is going\non\ni can't post my chat is frozen\ni need to update streamlabs man this\nshit's getting buggy\nokay let me just tell you guys what the\num maybe someone else can post it\ntrying to i can't type in chat\nhold on there we go works\nthank you um\nyeah i'm just amazed\nand i can't believe that\nthey can stitch together like because\nit's not like 16\nconversations it's just two\nconversations that they're stitching\ntogether it's brilliant\nlike you know we had uh i mean we just\nhave so many brilliant people in our\ncommunity it's amazing\ntruly amazing like this is hilarious um\ni think it's you know i imagine it's\nobjectively funny it's not just because\nit's me\nbut i think it's brilliant and we've got\nlike good artists\nlike people will post things on the\nreddit about like you know art\nyou know they'll make pictures and stuff\nand then we've got folks who are like\nmusicians like there's some i think\nthere's like a healthy gamer beat\nhealthy beats collective i think is what\nthey're called\nand they have like a you know they made\nan album and it's like i think i think\nthey maybe\nhang out on discord or something i'm not\neven sure exactly where they come from\nthat they've got an album on soundcloud\nwhich is actually pretty dope\num and\nit's great like we've got uh you know we\nhad someone post on\non um on a reddit who like compiled\nresources for\nstudents we had someone else post who's\na therapist who was kind of like talking\nabout\nyou know like analyzing what i do on\nstream and stuff which was fantastic\nthey were sort of talking about what i\ndo well and like you know other kinds of\nlike you know i don't think they were\nvery critical but i think they had a lot\nof good like feedback and\nand helping people understand like some\nof the luxuries that i have on stream\nthere's a lot of just super thoughtful\npeople out there um even the person who\nyou know made the post about the dosha\nis not the pokemon type like\nyou know there's a lot of good stuff in\nthis community\nand uh i think it's really fantastic\nlike one of my favorite things about\nthis work is the fact that it's like you\nknow there's there's space for other\npeople to shine\nright and so i'd say like like tram ran\nthere's like comedy genius in there\nyou"
