    "transcript": "so as long as you're trying to solve\nthat problem in\nthe game that the anxiety is playing for\nyou it's like\nyou know playing against the house in\na casino it's a game you're designed to\nlose\nhow do i get out of this thought loop\nwhen i am quiet\nam i being boring and when i'm talking\nam i being annoying\nokay if we think about this for a second\nthis is brilliant by the way\nso let's start by just understanding you\nknow where does the root\nof this come from right so like do you\nguys see how this thought\nam i being boring like comes from a\npresumption\nthat people don't like you or that\nyou're not delivering value\nand this too comes with a presumption\nthat you're not delivering value\nlike you guys see how both of these\nquestions even though\nthe behavior is the exact opposite\nlike they share the same root so this is\nreally important to understand\nso a lot of times people think that\ntheir\nanxiety is dependent on a particular\nthought\nright so like my mind produces the\nthought for me am i being boring by\nbeing quiet\nor am i being annoying by talking\nand so what we do is we focus on the\ncontent of the anxiety what is like the\nworry that we have\nright am i being boring am i being\nannoying like both of those are the\ncontent of the mind\nbut if you kind of think about it that\ndoesn't make any logical sense because\nif you're worried about being\nboring the solution to that is to talk\nand then if you start talking\ntheoretically that problem should be\nfixed you're no longer boring\nbut you wind up being either your mind\nyour mind actually tells you now that\nwe're talking\nam i being annoying maybe i should be\nmore quiet so from a logical perspective\nand from a thinking perspective\nit's like a lose-lose situation there's\nno way you can win\nbecause your mind is producing for you\nthoughts and worries and concerns\nwhich theoretically should lead to a\nparticular behavior or solution\nbut even if you engage in that\nbehavioral solution you're still screwed\nso like how on earth do you deal with\nthat\nand the key thing here is to go back to\nthe root that produces these thoughts\nokay so like this is where you know as\nlong as you\nfeel internally emotionally\nthat you are not going to like be\npleasant to be around if you are\ninsecure about you know what value you\nbring to like other people's like social\nservice like social like situations if\nyou can't really like serve to be like\nsocially useful to other people\nas long as you hold that belief that\nbelief will spawn off\nthoughts no matter the circumstance does\nthat make sense\nso it's kind of interesting because like\na lot of people will will start\nthey'll try to solve the individual\nthought but like\nwhat this this picture beautifully\nillustrates is brilliant right\nis that you can try to solve as many\nproblems as you want to your your mind\nif you're socially anxious\nis still is like never going to be\nappeased right when i'm quiet am i being\nboring oh talk more\nand then when you're talking you're like\noh my god am i being annoying be quiet\nmore\nyou can ping pong back and forth through\nthis as much as you want to and you'll\nnever fix it\nso what do you do about it what you do\nis first of all recognize the process\nthat your mind is going to like give you\nthese thoughts kind of no matter what\nand as long as you're playing at the\nlevel of thought you're never going to\nfix it and this is why people get stuck\nright it becomes a loop you start\nlooping because you're like bouncing\naround\nup here instead what you need to do is\ngo down to the root up\ntell yourself notice first of all oh my\nmind is doing that thing again where\nit's like\nbehaving at an intellectual level but\nthis\nintellectual content of my mind is being\nfueled by the emotion\nand so instead of trying to solve that\nproblem up here just ask yourself how do\ni\nfeel right now what is the emotional\nenergy that is driving this anxiety\nand once you start working at that level\nlike so you may\ndiscover for example oh like i'm just\nafraid that people aren't gonna like me\nand i'm not confident about myself\nbecause i've been in like\nisolation for a year and i feel like\nsocially rusty\ni'm concerned that these people might\nnot like me and then you can kind of sit\nwith that and it's like it's not about a\nparticular manifestation it's sort of\nlike okay like\ni feel afraid that people don't like me\nand this is why it's useful to work with\nsomeone like a therapist or coach or\nsomething like that right\nif you really have social anxiety i'd\nrecommend seeing you know a clinician\nif you have like a diagnosed social\nanxiety\nand then you know once you start sitting\nwith those feelings working on that\nunderlying emotion\nthen what you can do is like as the\nemotion kind of kind of starts to like\nempty out and decompress\nthe thoughts above will start to crumble\nso it's kind of interesting but like\nit's it's tricky because we sort of\nthink like okay how do i deal with this\nthought loop because it keeps on looping\nup there\nand instead of like dealing with the\nroot loop it's like you know how do i\nstart move\nhow do i stop moving in this loop well\nlike the answer to stop moving in the\nloop is like you have to like\nempty your gas can right because as long\nas you've got fuel your mind will loop\nin that way those rational thoughts\nthose logical thoughts those anxious\nthoughts will keep on looping\nand you will keep on trying to problem\nsolve okay\nand that problem solving will never\nactually lead to well i'm not i guess i\ncan't say never\nbut it will it's not really consistently\ngoing to lead to anything whereas the\nreal money\nisn't actually is in dealing with the\nunderlying emotion that's fueling the\nanxiety\nokay so a good example of this so we\nhave a we have a\na video entirely about this on dr k's\nguides\nso this is the anxiety module okay just\nreal quick\nso there's uh by the way there's a video\nactually on thought loops\nso if you guys are there's but that's\nnot the one i'm thinking about this is\nwhat i call feeding the beast\nokay so sometimes in our minds there are\nactually a couple of videos about this\nthere are a couple ways that we deal\nwith anxiety and one way that we deal\nwith anxiety is by like\ntrying to rationally solve that problem\nright we can try to solve the problem of\nwhen i'm quiet am i being boring and and\nwhen i'm talking\nam i am i being annoying so as long as\nyou're trying to solve\nthat problem in the game that the\nanxiety is playing for you\nit's like you know playing against the\nhouse\nin a casino it's a game you're designed\nto lose\nbecause it's not an intellectual problem\nso you can come up with as many\nintellectual solutions as you want to\nand it's not going to work this is the\nother problem with anxiety right is\nbecause we have a bunch of like five\nheads out there that are like\nokay i just need two dot dot dot i\nfigured everything out\nlike i just need to develop confidence i\njust need to do this i just need to do\nthis\ni figured everything out up here and\nthey try to do it and never works\nit's because all of your energy is being\nspent on sort of like the symptom\nas opposed to the cause so get down to\nthe roots of your insecurity or your\nlack of confidence\nand notice in that moment instead of\nplaying the game with the anxiety up top\nnotice like what am i actually feeling\nright now like where does this\ninsecurity actually\ncome from right and as you kind of do\nthat work as you start to notice\noh this is just my anxiety producing all\nof these thoughts and worries it's not\neven me\nthat's another useful technique that you\ncan do is notice what is your anxiety\nversus you and you're like oh that's\njust my anxiety it's like no big deal\nlike it's gonna act up again and you can\neven anticipate it so the next time you\ngo into a social situation\nyou know okay so my anxiety is gonna\nstart producing thoughts\ni know it sounds weird but as you\nanticipate it and then the anxiety comes\nyou don't fight it because remember most\nof the time we try to fight anxiety\nwhich just feeds the loop because you're\nadding\nuh gas to your gas tank so instead what\nyou want to do is take a step back and\njust be like okay\nwe knew this was coming oh wow this\nanxiety is really powerful today\nis it so powerful that i need to leave\nor can i give it like half an hour and\nhopefully i can start to have fun\nwhen you start dealing with your anxiety\nlike this you kind of take the steam out\nof it you take the energy out of it\nit'll kind of calm down and the thoughts\nwill actually stop on their own right so\nsomeone's saying\nyou have to fight the idea that you need\nto demonstrate value to others i think\nthat's the right\nsentiment i wouldn't encourage fighting\nit\nright so i wouldn't encourage like i\nknow it's an\ninteresting nuance here but i would\nnotice\nthat that is a false belief so i i think\ngenerally speaking\nand fighting your mind and anxiety makes\nthings\nworse for most people as they've learned\nthey may conquer it for a time but it\ncomes\nroaring back the next day so i'd\nencourage people to just notice oh like\nthere's a part of me that feels like i\nneed to demonstrate my value to others\nit feels that very strongly i feel like\nsuper inadequate and i feel like a waste\nof space\nunless i demonstrate my value to other\npeople\nand then you don't go and bully that\npart of you you're not like\nscrew you believe in yourself\ndumbass you should believe in yourself\nmore\nwhy are you so stupid start believing in\nyourself more\nyou know it's like you got to be careful\nthere so you can conquer it for a time\nbut generally speaking my experience has\nbeen that\nencouraging people to notice it is\nactually like\nmore potent right so it's interesting\nit's tricky gets tricky\nthere is value to sometimes fighting and\novercoming your anxiety though like so\nit's just like\ngenerally speaking people tend to know\nhow to do that relatively well\nand it's this part that people generally\nspeaking need to learn"
