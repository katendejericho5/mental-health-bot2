    "transcript": "okay so how do i start reading page one\nof a 500 page book it's overwhelming\nyou're right so the way that you start\nreading page one\nis by ignoring pages two through five\nhundred whether it's a 500\npage book or a two-page book you gotta\nread page one\ndoesn't matter 500 pages 200 pages\nthousand pages\nlike you can't read it doesn't matter\nthe action is the same\nthe overwhelming part comes from the\ngoal\nthis is why we're telling you all live\nin the present\nbecause as long as you're living in the\nfuture as long as you're thinking about\nyour goal like when we talk about\nmotivation\ni don't talk about goals why do you guys\nthink i don't talk about goals\ngoals make things harder sometimes okay\nhere's another one but what if it feels\nbad if i leave 10 projects unfinished\nthen it feels bad okay so let me explain\nsomething to you guys\nthis is my notebook just one\nthere are lots of ideas in here okay\nthis is vata so there's a lot of stuff\nin here this is filled with random crap\nthis one is let me just make sure it's\nokay this is a random to-do list\nokay and on the next page here's my\neducation rant\nso i this is something i want y'all to\nunderstand so as being a vata\nnine out of my ten projects are\nunfinished so what\nit's all good one out of ten is finished\nseems to be working so far let's focus\non finishing the good ones this is where\npeople say but what about\nthese other nine and it's like where do\ny'all think all this crap comes from\nso i had like like i've had so many\nprojects that are half complete\nand when the community needs something\ni'm like halfway done it's great\ni have all these projects and they're\nhalfway done\nand i don't finish them until someone\nshows up\nand is like hey can you do this thing\nand that's like you know what\nactually i can it's like like we earlier\ntoday we're\njoking about you know group coaching for\nauthors who haven't finished books\nbut there are there are notes in that\nabout my notebook\nabout the creative like burden right\nlike we have notes like if we wanted to\ndo that we could\nso this is the strength of avata it's\nlike you have nine out of ten projects\nthat are incomplete sure great fine\ncomplete one\nand then be prepared for the other nine\nbecause they could come in handy it's\ncrazy ideate that's what vatas are good\nat\nand the other thing is if it feels bad\nit feels bad like that's okay\nlike does it feel okay to finish one\ninstead of zero\nyou still feel good about that yeah so\njust\nstart projects i'd say finish some of\nthem you know\nbut like garbage will help you with that\nkarma helped me a ton that was the big\nthing is like now it's like\nwe've got stuff going on\nokay so you guys you guys think you can\noutdo dr k\nhow about if you finish zero so\ni'm trying to figure out how to say this\nevery finished\nproject that i have completed\nwas unfinished at some point\nright you guys get that i know it sounds\nkind of weird\nbut like if you finished zero you just\nhaven't finished them yet\nright like you just haven't finished it\nyet\nso like so what so i'll\ni'll explain something so like the the\ndr k's guide to meditation\ni started writing in 2005.\ni started writing in 2005 and it was\nunfinished\nfor 16 years\nand now it is done\nso like was that bad that it was\nunfinished in the decade in hindsight\nabsolutely not\ni am so glad that i worked on that crap\nfor a decade\nand then left it in a drawer because\nwhen someone\nsits down and and asks me in four weeks\nto write two two or three feature length\nfilms about meditation\nthat ends up being 65 000 words it's\nready\nso for this something else to just to\nshare about myself\ni started writing all kinds of random\ncrap at the age of 21 that never turned\ninto anything for like over a decade\nand now like now it's like i'm just\nfinishing one thing at a time\nso i know it sounds weird but how about\nif you finish zero\nif you haven't finished zero you don't\nknow if you've finished zero\nyou could finish half of them you just\ndon't know yet\nso thus far you've finished zero so what\nyou could finish it tomorrow you could\nfinish it a year from now you could\nfinish it five years from now you never\nknow\nright it's weird so be careful because\nwhen your mind tells you you've finished\nzero well like obviously like everything\nis unfinished\nuntil it's finished and then you beat\nyourself up for not having finished any\nprojects it's like\nthat doesn't you could finish it later\neverything is unfinished until it's\nfinished it sounds so stupid\nand simple right and then like the other\nbig thing that that people seem to the\nother big realization i had is that\nyou don't need to publish to get value\nout of writing that was another huge\nrevelation that i had i wrote all this\nstuff and i thought\noh my god this is unpublished like i\nnever turned it into anything but like\nwhere do you guys think these answers\nare coming from like when i\nanswer a question like where do you\nthink it's coming from it's coming from\nmy head how'd it get into my head it got\ninto my head by writing\nso writing for me is the clarification\nof my thoughts which then are like\naccessible so like people talk about\nunfinished projects and they value\nunfinished projects over finished\nprojects but in my experience\nthere's so much to be gained from\nunfinished projects\nyou learn so much you learn about\nyourself you learn about the process you\nlearn about the material\nand if something comes along that\ndemands that it be finished it will be\nfinished\nbecause the other thing i want you all\nto think about is when you have an\nunfinished project\nlike it's just you finishing it for the\nsake of finishing it that's a waste of\nyour time\nit needs to be finished when someone\nneeds it for something\nnow if you're not finishing things that\npeople are depending on that are\nimportant that's a different story\nbut i would venture that for most people\ntheir unfinished projects\nare like existing in a vacuum and you're\njust placing this arbitrary label on\nfinishing it\nfor the sake of finishing it because\nthat's better than not finishing it\neven though it may not have value in the\nworld you know why don't you have\nunfinished papers when you graduate with\nan english degree\nit's because you finished all the papers\nthat needed to be finished\nand all the half written poetry crap\nthat you didn't finish isn't ready to be\nfinished yet\nokay change my mind don't coach george\nhow many notebooks do you have good go\nyou see that pile over there\nthat's my notebooks just in this\niteration that's\nmaybe 20 to 25 of them"
