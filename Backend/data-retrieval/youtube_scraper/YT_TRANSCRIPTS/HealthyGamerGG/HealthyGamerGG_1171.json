    "transcript": "it's it's caused a lot of friction\nespecially in high school and especially\nin college like i'm in the middle of\ncollege right now\nand\ni mean people all they want to do is\nparty dude i just i just want to play\nhearthstone\nthat's all i want to do\nwelcome friend\noh thank you thanks for having me it's\nuh it's good to be here yeah thanks for\nthanks for coming so help me uh let's\nstart with what do you go by\nuh my full name is dominic but people\ncall me dom so okay\nso dom and and what are we talking about\ntoday\nwhat's on your mind um\nuh the biggest thing uh and i saw the uh\nthe stream subject it was a computer is\nslowly ruining my life\nokay and\nthat's that's kind of\ni guess that's the biggest that's the\ntip of the iceberg\nand i guess we're gonna explore deeper\ndown as we as we go through\nokay so that's interesting because you\nsaid it's the biggest and you said it's\nthe tip of the iceberg\nthat's true i did say that most obvious\nhow about that okay yeah so so it and\ni'm hearing if you're if we're gonna dig\ndown dom what i'm hearing is that maybe\nlike you said you kind of said that's\nthat's what you see\nlike the behavior that you observe is\nthat you you the computer is slowly\nruining your life\nyeah yeah and it's it's like\nit's not just computer it's\nthe computer is kind of like the mode of\ntransportation to a lot of things\nuh\ni mean it could be\ncomic books it could be manga it could\nbe netflix video games i mean\nreddit it does it doesn't matter\ni i i label the computer because\nthat's what i use to get to my fix you\nknow okay\nso help me understand what what why do\nyou say that the computer is slowly\nruining your life what does that mean\num\ni think i think the biggest thing\ni mean by that is i have a lot of goals\noutside of electronic things\nuh\ni want to learn bass guitar i think my\nbass is in frame yeah i'm trying to\nlearn bass guitar funny enough i need to\nuse the computer to learn bass guitar\num i want to learn how to play right\nskateboard a lot of\nacademic goals and\nsports goals i run track and field\nthe university and\nit's\nit's hard it's hard to run a track\npractice on little amounts of sleep when\nyou're gaming all night so\nhmm\nokay\num\nso it sounds like you're not happy with\nyourself for not being able to achieve\nyour goals\nyeah yeah there's a\nthere's a lot of frustration um\ncan you hold on just one second\nthere we go\ni just realized i forgot to switch over\nthe overlay so people haven't been able\nto see you until now oh unlucky i'm not\nright we fixed it\nthank you now now check and see me you\nknow prior to the computer we have this\nboomer device called a phone and\nsometimes my my\nteam has to contact me it's like it's\nlike a miniature computer that can do\nvery few things\ndude that's that sounds really useful\nand helpful\nin your pocket\nit it it's like a device that can solely\ndo voice chat well you can you can do\ndms sort of we call them texts\nwhoa crazy kind of like emails kind of\nlike short emails yeah it's like a short\nemail exactly yeah\num so you sound uh\noh\na little bit frustrated that you're\nyou're not sort of achieving your goals\nyeah uh a little bit is kind of an\nunderstatement um\nthere there are times when because i\nused to i used to think i didn't have an\nanger\nand\ni used to kind of just like bury it in a\nsense or maybe just ignore it not kind\nof bury it because\nit kind of just explodes\nbut\nwhen\nover the past year it came to points\nwhere i just had nothing to do and i\ndidn't want to play video games but i\ndidn't know how to do anything else\nright i didn't know how to go skateboard\ni couldn't practice space because i\ndidn't own one um\ni couldn't start journaling because i\ndidn't own any journals right so like\nthe only thing i could do while in\nquarantine after i finished my homework\nwas play video games and\ni guess when\nit came to the point where i like\nacknowledged my anger at myself\ni don't know how to play piano and i'm\nfrustrated with that you know i'm not\ni'm not getting the grades that i wanted\nto so i'm frustrated with that you know\ni'm not\nrunning the track and field times that i\nwish i was you know and i'm frustrated\nwith that it kind of just explodes and i\ngot you know i gotta go take a steaming\nwalk outside\nand\nmake sure it's uh well steaming as an\ni'm steaming\nuh\nwhat what\nexplodes\nwell it kind\nof like my face gets red\num\ni can't focus on one thing\nlike i'll think about one thing that's\nupsetting and then i'll just think about\nthe next thing and then i'll just think\nabout the next thing and i'll just think\nabout the next thing\nand it kind of just gets out of control\nand all of a sudden i'm not thinking\nabout what i initially thought about\nright and all of a sudden i'm angry at\nmy parents or i'm angry at politics or\ni'm angry at youtube or i'm angry at\nthe current smash bros meta right like\nit doesn't matter what it is i just i\nget just frustrated with stuff\nyeah\nyeah sometimes you know i'll joke about\npeople becoming anger elementals\nyeah and and what i'm sort of noticing\nis that your anger will find\nsomething like you feel the anger and it\nseems like it's looking for some kind of\noutlet to latch onto\nwhether it's parents or\nthe meta in a video game and that each\nthing that you engage with with like\nactually like boosts up the anger more\nyeah yeah\nyeah definitely\nthat's it that's a good way to put it\nso help me understand um don\nokay let me just\nlay a couple things out okay so here's\nwhat i think we can talk about\num you know i want to better understand\nwhat\nwhat it means when you say like computer\ngames are ruining your life\nbecause what i see is you know you're\nlike\nyou seem to have a touch of the chad\nwithin you\nlike you're in school you run track and\nfield\nyou know you're learning like you have a\nbass guitar it sounds like you're not\nvery good but that\nyou know you're\nyou know there's there's\ni i can imagine i know it sounds kind of\nweird but like i can imagine that a lot\nof people who are walking uh watching\nwould actually like envy certain parts\nof your life and wish they could do what\nyou wanted to do\nyeah so i'm curious about you know how\nvideo games are ruining your life\ni also think that we may wind up talking\na little bit about you know two\ndirections which is like where does that\nanger come from because it seems like\nthe anger can choose to get mad about\nany sort of thing\nand what we tend to do is we say when we\nget mad about something that the thing\nis where the anger is coming from\nbut if you like you know if you have\nsomeone who's emotionally angry they can\nget angry about anything and it actually\nif you really pay attention it seems\nlike the anger is not caused by politics\nor the smash brothers meta\nbut that those are triggers for the\nanger that's already inside\nso we may talk about that and the last\nthing that um\nreally i think this could be interesting\nis we can try to understand like why do\nyou have these goals in the first place\nlike where do goals come from how does\nour mind decide hey i want to do this\nthing\nbecause what you're doing is you're kind\nof setting a goal for yourself and\nyou're buying yourself frustration by\nnot achieving it\nyeah\nyeah\nit's a\nlike a discounted price of the anger\nticket i guess\nexactly right so that's a great that's a\ngreat way to put it so what\ndoes that sound okay to you do those\ntopics seem like they would interest you\nor be honest maybe okay i mean\nespecially because it's like\ni've seen i've seen streams i've watched\ni love this i love this channel dude\nthis place is this is not a cult no\nmatter what uh chat says\nbut i'm part of the dr k colts so\nthere it is\nit was a pro cult face\nphrase\nthere is of course and so yeah i know\nhow these streams can\nkind of go where we didn't even expect\nit so it's like as long as we just get\ngoing and get rolling let's do it i'm\ntelling you pumped and excited how are\ncomputer games ruining your life\num\nthey\ni use them i use them to cope and i use\nthem to\ni use them instead of things that i wish\ni was doing\nincludes the talents and the things i'm\nworking on that includes hanging out\nwith friends or going on with dates\nand i don't like playing video games\nas much as i used to\num\nand\nwhen i say as much as i used to i wanna\ni wanna like go into that like explain\nthat a bit because\nuh although i have a little bit like\nsure like i have a touch of the chad\nwithin me um it's it i was the lucky one\nin my family to get the chad within me\nnone of my friends none of my brothers\nor sisters are athletic\nuh\nmy dad uh\nactually i can't play basketball\nironically\nbecause when i asked my dad to\nteach me how to play basketball he said\nhe didn't know how to either then he\njust took me inside and showed me his\ngamecube because he loved gamecube right\nand then we played rts's online and\ndawn of war\nlord of the rings battle for middle\nearth i mean\nwhat all the age of empires uh\nthat i just gamed with him that's how we\nbonded right\nso\nvideo games kind of became\nthat thing for me right\ni i wouldn't\njust a quick question why the the when\nyou say it's ironic that i can't play\nbasketball is that because you're black\nis that why you're saying it's sorry\nmissing something there uh\nthere's a touch of it it's all jokes\nhave it's like a pie chart right so it's\nlike i am black i'm athletic\num i'm tall i'm like six three and i\nhave big hands and everyone always\nassumes i play basketball okay okay so\nit's not just the color of your skin\nit's also your height and yeah yeah okay\ni just wanted to understand why why is\nit ironic that you know\na gamer can't play basketball i just\nlost me there yes i people people i mean\npeople never see me as a gamer right\nthey never\nthey never\npictured me to be that guy you know um\nfunny funny thing\nyeah well when i when i was a kid\num i moved into this new area and i was\nhanging out with a bunch of guys\nand these people were talking about\nnaruto\nand\none of my good friends today\nhe wasn't a good friend then because i\nwas just meeting him he turned to me\nhe's like don't pay attention to those\nlosers right he literally said that i\nwas like dude what's wrong with naruto\nlike that show's sick and all the losers\nlike freaked out they're like oh\nthis guy knows\nand he's one of us\nhe's one of us\nand\nuh\nit's funny though\nhe looks like a chad he had the heart of\na weeb\ndude oh no i i try not to be a weeb i\ntry not to i can't\nsorry it sounded like you're about to\nsay something important i couldn't help\nmyself well it kind of like it kind of\ngoes into\nanother facet of like why video games\nand\nmanga and anime and comics are ruining\nmy life because\nalthough\nlike once i said like what's wrong with\nnaruto all the chads in that group like\nimmediately dismissed me like\nimmediately like oh he's one of them\nright not one of us one of them\nand\nthroughout the school year like they\njust\nit didn't invite me out as much as they\ndid within that first week of me meeting\nthem\ni kind of hung out with those losers\nquote unquote\num but their schedules and their\nmotivations and their goals didn't line\nup\nso much with what i kind of wanted to do\nwith my life\nso i ended up just distancing myself\nfrom that group\nwithout having a connection to any other\ngroup and i kind of just ended up alone\nyou know i kind of just\nended up playing video games by myself\nfor a long time\num\nand it that that kind of happens\nuh a lot throughout my life and\nit's that weird balance between being a\nweeb\nand being big gamer reddit mode reddit\nchad\nuh\nand kind of just being a normal person\nquote-unquote right\num\nit's it's caused a lot of friction\nespecially in high school and especially\nin college like i'm in the middle of\ncollege right now\nand\ni mean people all they want to do is\nparty dude i just i just want to play\nhearthstone\nthat's all i want to do\nhow do you feel about yourself for just\nwanting to play hearthstone\ndude at times\nlike a loser i'm like dude i really am a\nloser like what what the heck i can't\nnot go out right or i can't not stay in\num\ni mean a couple weeks ago i like binged\nall of attack on titan in like three\ndays from friday to sunday\ninstead of doing anything else including\nworking out right\num and that like i i skipped i got sent\nworkouts by my coach for the summer he's\nlike hey use these\nuh\nand get in shape and i just stayed in\nwatched anime all day at night\nand\ni'm super ashamed to it i know he'll\nnever watch this so i can say it i mean\ni ended up lying to him on monday i was\nlike yeah i did the workout and these\nwere my times\nthis is what i did\num\ni just felt super ashamed and angry at\nmyself for that right like not only can\ni not just go work out because the\nworkout only took like an hour and a\nhalf right i can pause attack on titan\nfor an hour and a half\nand come back and watch it right\nbut i mean i apparently didn't then\nyou'll lose the race\nof watching attack on time within a\nwhole weekend before anyone else and\nthen it's just like\ni even watched it and it's it's not done\nright it's not caught up to the manga\nimmediately as soon as the last episode\nended i just hopped onto my manga\nwebsite and just read the rest of it\nlike i just i couldn't not stop\ni needed to consume\nthe whole\nthing\nand then i was done you know\nand it's kind of with everything right\nuh\ni read the boys all in one weekend the\ncomic out there like\nthe boys in berserk are two two comics\nthat i read when i was relatively young\nwhen i was like 13 14.\nand those are pretty\nheavy\nmanga and comics to read you know heavy\nsubject heavy\nconcepts and i just read it all in a\nweekend even though it's like training\non me mentally and i just\nand like looking back now when i think\nabout my 13 year old little brother i\nwas like dude i don't even want him to\nthink about berserk right it's just such\na\nkind of graphic\nsubject matter\nand\ni even though i\nfelt drained reading it\ni just\nflew right through it i needed to right\nmy i wouldn't allow myself to not stop\nwhat does it mean to need to consume\nwhat does that need\nit's\nit feels like\nat times like i i end up looking at\nmyself i'm like man i'm just a machine\nlike i just i input these\ni input this material whether it's the\nprimal tv show right the cartoon network\nsamurai jack\nor adventure time or anything\nand\ni log it right i catalog it like oh i\nknow all of this stuff\ni know all the lurthering fun facts\nright i know all the harry potter\nsecrets\nand then i just move on to the next one\nyou know it's like i\ni feel like i'm just trying to fill\nsomething that i can't be filled you\nknow when i look back at it when i when\ni'm in it when i'm in the mode i'm just\nenjoying it right i'm watching it i'm\njust doing what feels natural you know\nand it's in a sense\nand like i'm like oh just watch just\nwatch just watch\nwhen i look back i'm like man what did i\njust do like i just skipped workouts for\nthis i just it's going to be there right\nit's going to be there in 10 years\nwatch it then\nyou know don the way that you're talking\nabout it actually makes me think about\naddiction\nso what you're describing to me like\nactually reminds me of like patients\nthat\ngo on benders\nyou know like like\nand they kind of like wake up the next\nlike you wake up on wednesday morning\nand you kind of look around and you're\nlike oh my god\nwhere did where what happened where did\nmy time go what have i been it's like\nit's sort of like there's like a very\ncloudy awareness\nthat feels like\nprimal and hedonistic\nyou know and then and you're not really\nlike you just need to consume it sounds\nvery\nyou know base to me\nyeah yeah i i can\ndefinitely see it like that especially\ni mean it's like the hangover gamer\nedition right\ni guess like\nit just\ni don't text people while i do it i\nguess as well like i just\nlike if someone reaches out to me\ni like won't respond or i'll say like\nsorry i'm busy doing something else\nand\nwhat goes through your head when you say\nsorry i'm busy\nnot much it kind of just\nlike that's it like i just say like\nsorry i got it\nlike i don't want to it's not saying\nlike man i gotta think of this\nconvoluted\nplot to\nconvince them i'm busy it's like i i\ndon't want to go hang out with them so\ni'm just going to tell them i'm busy\nyeah not not so much like oh\ni got a\nfront that i'm so\nactive outside you know\nyeah\nso i i know it sounds kind of weird but\nyou know what what do you think it is\nthat you're trying to fill up\nwith all of the anime\num\nit could just be time\nuh\nit's always come to a point like\nthe reason why i'm reaching out now in a\nsense is because i've never before\nskipped workouts to watch anime or watch\na show or play video games or read a\ncomic\ni've always been able to like\nparallel them within my life you know\nkeep them separate like i got to work\nout now i got to get up for 4 a.m\nworkouts so i'm going to bed at 8 30\nright i'm gonna i'm gonna do what i need\nto do to make sure my outside life is\nsuccessful um\nwithin the past within the past year\nit's kind of just\nspiraled out of control you know yeah\nand a lot a lot of it could be because\nlike school canceled and workouts were\ncanceled so i was like dude all the time\nin the world to play video games like i\ncan do what i've been wanting to do\nsince i was 11 years old\nand\nman i again i just consumed like i just\ni got this game called vermintide 2 for\nmy dad for my uh for birthday present\nand i just played the heck out of it i\nmean all summer i just played and played\nand played\nand then i got guild wars 2. like it\ndoesn't matter what kind of game you\nknow like whatever game i just get\nattached to slay the spire\nplayed a lot of like\ni'll get it for one weekend\nand i'll play it for like\n30 40 hours\nwithin five six days\nand then i'll kind of get sick of it and\nthen i'll move on and\ni mean\nperfect example is this last christmas\nbreak when school was a thing so in 2019\nto 2020 christmas break\num\ni bought myself a christmas present of\nuh star wars knights of the republic one\nand two\nand for those two weeks\ni i spent like 41 hours\non the first game and then the next week\ni spent like 36 hours on the second game\ni just beat it and i just played right\nthrough and then like\ni'll like look at like snapchat like\ninstagram and i'll be like seeing all\nthese people going on trips\nand\nhanging out with hanging out with each\nother and like\nhanging out like down the street right\nthey're hanging out in the city right\nnext to i live i'm like man it'd be fun\nto it'd be fun to uh go hang out\ni'll just\ncontinue to game right i won't even\nreach out to them\ni like\ni'll get angry at them for not reaching\nout to me i'd be like oh i wouldn't be\nplaying this video game if they reached\nout to me you know\nand like these guys love me they would\nbe so down to hang out with me if i\nreached out to them\nlike i get in this point where i'm like\nangry at them for not reaching out to me\nso i like just continue playing you know\nthat makes sense is that is that a\nmakes a lot of sense\ncan\nmaybe i can share with you what i heard\nand then you tell me if it makes sense\nso i i am getting the sense that you you\nreally do have like almost like this\nkind of compulsion kind of thing where\nlike you'll you'll sort of like\nwillingly kind of dive into this right\nand you'll come up for air like a week\nlater\nand then it it's in those moments of\nlike when your head breaks the surface\nof the water and you're like looking\naround that you're like oh hold on\nthere's a life\nthat exists outside of this\nand then you'll kind of blame yourself\nfor\ndiving underwater for so long you'll\nblame other people for not pulling you\nabove water\nthere's like some amount of\nself-loathing like you know you'll blame\nanything and everything\nfor\nputting you into these situations and\nthen you take a deep breath and then you\nplay cotor2\n[Laughter]\nyeah\nright that's we'll put\nthat's why you're the doctor man the\ncult leader\ni mean\nyou're the one who shared it bro\ni'm just\nrepeating it back\num\nand so what do you think it is that you\nknow what goes through your head between\nkotor 1 and kotor 2.\num\nor is that is that really it was it was\nor not did you not come up for air\nbetween those two yeah i don't think i\ncame up here between those two i mean it\njust\nand the the problem is is i\nthose games are some of the best games\nof all time i freaking i love those\ngames and i recommend them to everybody\ni bought them for my cousin because i\nwas like yo dude you need this game\nand it's like i enjoy the things i do\nlike these binges i enjoy the the\ncharacters\ni enjoy\nreading like i read the invincible\ncomics like when i was like\n18 and i read them all in like a week\nlike again a weekend and i just loved it\nand then the show came out and i was\nlike dude\ni'm so pumped and it's actually\nactually a funny story because i was\nhanging out with a girl and i was\nscrolling through youtube and we were\ntalking and i could like tell like\nthings were moving to a point of like\nphysical intimacy right and then i saw\nthe trailer for invincible on youtube i\nwas like there i have to watch this like\nyou are going to be put on pause for\nlike 10 minutes so i can watch this\nand then i\nthen i think jk simmons was like the\nvoice act i was just losing my mind i\nwas like there's and i ended up nothing\nhappening because i was so worked up on\ninvincible in this new show coming out\nand it was it's just a funny thing kind\nof just like how my priorities like\nshift to like these\nthese mediums of\nentertainment you know whatever it is\ndon i'm getting the sense that you're\nkind of stuck between two worlds\nlike yeah\nyeah uh\ncontinue sorry sorry i was just agreeing\nwith you\nhow tell me about that\num\nand you again you guys know i'm i run\ntrack and field and it's not that i just\nrun track and field like i'm i'm pretty\ngood\nand i have a lot of potential\nand i mean like putting it say i\nwouldn't be able to pay for college\nwithout track and field you know like\nwithout\nit's basically like a job and it's not\nonly it's\nit's it can be a lifestyle there's\npeople\nand new people who would go to college\njust to be the track athlete at their\nfavorite college\nand\nto me it was always kind of just like\nsomething that i saw and i was like\nthat's weird that they\ncare about track this much\nand\nthen i would come you know come to these\nbinges and come out and kind of be\njealous of them right because they're\ngoing to the parties\nthey're\nyou know like them just running track\nand field is like what they\ndesire and what they strive for right\nand me being blessed and talented\nat kind of just being\na means to the end a means to an end\nright\ni just i feel\nlike what's\nlike i want to be part of that right and\nlike like we've kind of pointed out\nbefore it's like so i'll try to push\nmyself towards that right but it'll be\nfriction and it'll be kind of unwanted\nbecause i've never been a partier you\nknow i don't drink i don't smoke i don't\nknow do anything like that and\nkind of just trying to like fit myself\nin these\nplaceholders\nand like\ncause\num\nwhen i think about it i'm really\nreally close with my family\nand i'm really close with friends that\nare like like family you know um\nand i think when i when i kind of\nself-analyze myself like that's where a\nlot of this is coming from\nuh my fam they game that that's my thing\nthat's my family thing we have this huge\nland room in our living room where like\nthere's four pcs set up and all of us\nhave steam accounts and all of us buy\nthese games and we'll just play from\nlike\n3 p.m to 2 a.m right we'll buy terraria\nwhen there's a when it's on sale and\nwe'll just grind it we'll just play it\nand play it and play it we'll order\npizza\nit doesn't matter that's just\nwhat we do and\nit didn't it didn't like really occur to\nme like how unhealthy that can be\nuh for kids because i i mean i started\ndoing that when i was like 11.\ni when terraria first came out like my\ndad and i played terraria until like 3\na.m for like four nights in a row\nand that's one of like some of the\ngreatest memories i have with my dad you\nknow but when i think back to him like\ni'm a nutrition major right i'm learning\nabout how important sleep is for young\nkids i was like holy cow what was my dad\ndoing like why didn't he just tell me to\ngo to bed and we could just play in the\nmorning you know\nand i come back and i see i see my\nyounger brothers doing that thing\nthe same the same type of patterns and\nsafe type of things and like going\nthrough the same struggles\ni went through you know as a teenager\nand a lot of that's just teenager\nstruggles right\nit's tough being a junior high kid\num\nand i get\nangry right like like like like we said\nearlier i get i get mad\nand i also get mad that like that's how\nwe\nagain like that's what i care about like\ni care about my family\nthat's how we bond you know\nwhy does that make you angry\num\na big thing\nis because i've put so much time so much\nof my time\nas a youth into\nthese useless games\nlike on war 3 is one of the greatest rts\ngames of all time in my mind right and\ni've put hundreds of hours into it\nlike i look at them think myself like\nwhat if i put hundreds of hours\ninto like drawing right\nor theater or bass guitar or skateboard\nright\nsomething that would\nsomething that just doesn't\nleave me empty you know something that\ndoesn't\nkind of just drain me like it does and i\nget mad because i get mad that i didn't\nhave\nthe supervisors or like the adult\nsupervision to\nward me against that you know and i i i\ndon't have a problem with video games in\nmoderation\nlike\nbut when i go through these binges and i\ngo and i look back how many hours i've\nwasted on cs go\nlike that's just it's so pointless\nright i'm not i don't want to go pro why\nam i spending so much time on this\nlike i could be doing literally anything\nand it's like i could be reading you\nknow i've so i've bought so many books\ni've gotten to like the last four\nchapters and then like i just fizzle out\nyou know\ndon it sounds to me like you've wasted a\nfair amount of your life or lost a fair\namount of your life\nyeah yeah\nit's a it's a big it could be especially\nespecially from ages like 10\nto like 17\ni just\nso my parents got divorced when i was 10\nyears old\nand\nthey\nit's hard seeing your parents go through\ndivorce\nwhen you're not old enough to kind of\nunderstand why\nyou're not young enough to like just\naccept it as is you know um\nit's\nit's hard seeing like kind of seeing\nyour parents break down because you have\nthese these like immortal pictures of\nyour parents\nin your mind and then seeing them just\nkind of be\nhuman and like worthless in your mind\nuh\nlike again i just like there was one\ntime\nmy dad was like feeding us you know fish\nsticks because that's all he had and he\njust couldn't stop shaking because of\nhow sad he was and i remember like\nlooking like like he's like that's so\nlike that's so sad you know i just\nthought that and then my mom kind of\njust reclused herself right\nand i guess i guess from that point\nlike it's where these\ni just kind of threw myself into video\ngames and i\nwe had the lutheran discs\nat home the lord movie discs and i just\nconsumed all of it dude i went through\nevery special features\ni went through every second of the movie\nand i watched every little bit of it i\ndid that with like every movie i ended\nup going through like this because back\nin the 2000s right we had these huge cd\ncases or like these little hand flips\nlike\ncd books right\nand i would\nwe had tons of them and i would just\nwatch over and over and over and i'd\nwent through every single one of them it\ndidn't matter what it was right i\nremember watching uh live laugh love\nwhen i was like 10 years old or like 11\nyears old and it's super chick flicky\nmovie but it just it didn't matter to me\nright it was like that's the next one\nnext cd right and it's like thinking\nback i'm like wow like that's that was a\nreal girly movie\nbut\ndone what\nwhat was it like\nwhat did you understand about your\nparents divorce can you\num\ni just understood they were splitting\nuh\nthey're pretty volatile at times\nand i under i i knew within myself that\nit wasn't good\nlike what was going on\num\nand that that's about it i didn't\nyou know when they uh\ni feel like every kid like secretly has\nlike the good guy\nin\ntheir mind when parents get divorced\num unless it's just outright bad or it's\nactually done really well um\nwhat is it a good guy\nlike uh\nthe\nthe aggressor in the divorce and like\nthe one who's getting the short end of\nthe stick right or the one once you did\nnothing wrong in your mind the villain\nright the villain and the\ni see the villain and the hero so who is\nthe who is the villain and who is the\nhero in your parents divorce\nfor me like i just saw them both as\nvillains in a sense like it i was like\nthis is\nlike there wasn't\nuh both of them had their issues right\nand like i can see that and i was like\nthis\nlike i don't like this i don't like this\nat all\nyou know i wasn't like oh\nif mom would stop yelling at him or if\nlike if dad would stop hitting her like\nlike\nlike my dad didn't you know\ndo anything super destructive and it's\nlike\nthere was no moments like oh like i need\nto protect so and so in my mind right or\nlike i'm gonna put up it's like i kind\nof just like that's like this is bad\nthis is not good i don't like any of\nthis\nyou know what what was in your mind\ni don't remember a lot of it i remember\nfeelings you know the feelings of it bad\nbut like a lot of it was kind of\nnot blocked out or forgotten but i don't\nknow i just i remember\nlike few key moments i remember watching\nmy dad walk out of the house\nfrom the window\nand his friend came and picked him up\num\nand that's that's about it from\nlike it was like\nfrom ages like\none\nto\nlike eight\ni remember you know just being a normal\nkid growing up playing ghost in the\ngraveyard outside\num and then\nagain like those few key things i\nremember going on a trip with my dad\nwhen they were still together so my\nparents were still together i went on a\ntrip with my dad to montana\nand my mom didn't want to come with us\ni remember that and i remember being\nweirded out by that like my mom and my\nolder sister like stayed home like why\nit's a family trip we should all go\num and it just didn't make sense to me\num\nand that and that like those few big\nthings\nand like a general feeling of like i\ndon't like this like i don't like this\nuneasiness i don't like this tension\ni don't like how quiet the house is you\nknow\nor things like that\nand what were things like after they got\ndivorced\num\nyou know physically\nit was pretty weird\nuh going from one house to the other\ni didn't like that very much\num\nit was also weird because\nwe moved within the same neighborhood\nso like my parents had my mom the\noriginal house was right here\nand then\nmy mom just moved like two streets down\nso we're so my dad kept\nall\nout initially out initially my dad left\nand\nwas staying with friends and we'd go to\nthe friend's house\nand like spend time with his with his\nfriends or\nwith him\nand then my mom ended up leaving the\noriginal house two doors down like two\nstreets down then my dad ended up moving\nback into the original house\nand\nlike i'd we'd just walk back and forth\nlike the weekends and it was really\nweird because i mean he was just down\nthe street you know\nand like mentally in my mind he was just\ndown the street but like we couldn't go\nsee him i couldn't go hang out with him\nand that was kind of weird\nit was also weird because he didn't have\nlike any furniture so it was just like\nan empty house\nand\nwe got we got pretty poor at times\nbecause like one time like the water was\nturned off and like i had to go to the\nneighbor's house and ask for water so we\ncan like pour it into the uh\ninto the toilet so we can flush that was\nthat was really gross all the time\nespecially if like my younger siblings\ndidn't tell us they used the restroom\nbecause they just forgot and i was like\noh and i'd come to an awful surprise\num\nthen then we moved again my mom moved\nagain\nlike down the street to like another\napartment\nand like\nthe reason why we did this is we wanted\nto stay within the neighborhood and stay\nwithin school right we didn't want to\nmove schools sure\nand\nthen my dad ended up moving all over the\nplace all over\nthe state we lived in\nand again i just i didn't\ndidn't like it i didn't like going to\ndifferent houses for the weekend\ni didn't like\nthe fact that like we couldn't just get\nback together right because i remember\nwatching mrs doubtfire\nright and like\nthinking to myself i'm like wow like\nthey're just so good for each other they\nshould just get back together right\nthat's what you kind of think when\nyou're a kid you're like robin williams\nis such a hero right then you know they\nnow i look back and like well they\ndidn't end back back together because\nyou know they're adults and they make\ntheir decisions\num\nas a kid i kind of really didn't see\nthat i was like\njust say sorry figure it out right like\nlet's let's raise above\nour\nsinful states i guess\nwhat's wrong with that\nwith wanting to raise above yeah\ni don't think there's much i don't think\nthere's much to the desire but kind of\nlike my reaction it kind of just made me\nangry like again it just made me\nupset that they weren't doing what i\nwanted right it made me angry say that\nwith them that you wanted them to get\nback together\num\ni don't think so\nwe didn't there wasn't a lot of\nparent-to-kid communication\ni should say i should say there wasn't a\nlot of mother-to-son communication or\nfather-to-son communication there was a\nlot of parent-to-kid communication as in\nthey fed me they kept me warm\nthey kept me clothed right they made\nsure i was in sports\nthey sent me to school\nbut i mean when i would come home from\nschool\nthey'd say like how was your day i was\nlike sick it was fun super pogers right\nthen\ni just\nsit on the computer\nwatch some movies\nand then i wouldn't see them again until\ndinner then we'd have some dinner\nand i wouldn't see them for the rest of\nthe night\nyou know how does your dad feel about\nyour gaming\num\njust sees it as normal\ni feel about his gaming\nyeah i don't like it i don't like it at\nall\ni don't like\nkind of any of the family gaming because\ni can see\ni see my again like that period where i\njust go hide in the computer i see that\nin my younger siblings you know i see\nthat and what\nis going on with them\nand i'm like dad like that that's your\nkid man\ngo talk to him\ni'm like\noh have an argument\nand then next week make up then next\nweek have another argument right and\nthen make up and then develop that kind\nof bridge between them you know\nand i'm confused who's who's having an\nargument are you saying that you argue\nwith your dad or that your dad should\nargue with the kids so that you guys\nwould kill your relationship\nyou should argue with the kid to build a\nrelationship right\num\ni said argue but it could be like\nanything go talk with them go do\nanything\num\nlike where we are now\nis like my dad will be playing a video\ngame\nand\nthen\nmy two younger brothers will get in this\nhuge fight\nand then one of them will start crying\nand then my dad's attentive he's like\nwhat's going on right what's what's\nhappening right and then he has to play\ncatch-up for everything he wasn't paying\nattention to\nand then\nit just you know ends up and the thing\nis we live in like we i used i don't\nlive with them anymore but\nwe used to live in like a two-room\napartment so like\neverybody in the room\nhad to pay attention to\nthe argument that was going on with\nbetween my like the discussion\nand there are times like six of us in a\ntwo-room apartment so it's like\nyou get a lot of emotions and\ni don't know and i like seeing that now\ni'm like\neither a\nthe argument would be avoided because\nmy dad would be able to nip the problem\nbehavior of one of the little brothers\nin the butt\nor\nthe aftermath\nof trying to discuss the argument or\ndiscuss the problem will be a lot\nsmoother because my dad kind of\nunderstands where the younger brother is\ncoming from or the the slightly older\nbrother is coming from don how does your\nmom feel about your gaming\num\nshe doesn't care either because i'm able\nto keep track and field up right she's\nlike as long as your grades are good as\nlong as you are performing at sports\nlike you can do whatever you want on the\nweekends right\num how does your mom feel about your\ndad's gaming\nyeah you know i don't think she\nunderstands kind of like how much\nbecause they don't they don't know what\ngoes on in between the homes right they\ndon't they don't know what goes on\nin and home\num\nand i know she doesn't she does not like\na lot of the things about my dad\num\nand i there's just a lot of\nthere's a lot of residual anger\nbetween both of them\nthat to me seems childish do you think\nthat your life would be better if your\ndad did a better job\ni mean it's\nit's hard to see it's hard to say yes\nbecause i don't want to say yes\nbecause my dad tried\nthat's that's the hard part\nhe\nhe was raised a nerd i mean he was\nraised he\nhis dad my grandpa\nwas a huge star trek fan huge i mean\nand he he worked for nasa he had tons he\nwas just that guy right that that 70s\nnerd dad right\nand my dad looks up to him and i look up\nto him like you know there's no other\nand i think my dad kind of tried to\nreplicate that sense of\nwonder\nin\nthese imaginary worlds within me right\nwhether a star trek or star wars\nor\ndune right he was a big dune fan\num\ndon does your dad have a job\num\nhe just got rehired um covet's done a\nlot of hard stuff to him and the kind of\nhabits that he had right it kind of\nreally\ndoubled down on these habits that he\nalready had build up and they kind of\njust took over his life in a sense\num\nwhat about so you guys had the water\nturned off\nagain floating through\num\nwhat does that mean floating through\nuh he's like he was kind of like a\ncontract like he'd do\nside jobs for\nuh x amount of money and then he'd be\nokay for a little bit and then he'd end\nup doing this one acting gig for x\namount of money then he'd be okay for a\nbit and then he'd do this one computer\nthing and then he ended up getting a job\nthen got screwed over in the job and\nthen got a new job right and then at\ntimes like\nhe'd be working like two or three jobs\nand it's it's really it was really\nvolatile and he never\nagain one thing i'm super thankful is\nlike he never gave up right he never\ngave up on us\nand\nhe ended up he like he got food on the\ntable\nhe paid for what he could right whether\nthe water turned off or the gas was\nturning off he always made sure we had\nblankets we always made sure we had\npillows and\nmattresses\nso it's like again it's hard for me to\nsay yes i think he would have done\nbetter if he did a better job but we\ncould say that about any parent right\ni can say that\nwhat i can say is i know he tried his\nbest\nor how flawed he is\nyou know\nand i i love him and i love him so much\nfor that right\nand then the the greatest thing the\ngreatest thing about it is i'm not\nbiologically his kid\num he he married my mom when i was about\ntwo years old so he kind of he kind of\nstepped up and picked up this extra\nweight right and when the parents got\ndivorced he offered to pay child support\nfor me as well even though legally he\ndidn't have to because i wasn't his kid\nso it's\nin my eyes\nthe greatest honor a man and a choir is\npicking up the slack of another\nworthless man\nyou know and in regards to their kid\nand\nthat's what he did you know as flawed as\nhe was he gave me an awesome childhood\nhe spent as much time as he could with\nme whether you know whether he developed\nthis video game addiction right whether\nhe helped facilitate that\nyou know he\nhe loves me i mean\ni'm a 6-3 black guy right but he's a 510\nwhite nerd right and he\nlooks at me\nlike\ni'm his son you know and he hugs me like\ni'm his son\nand\ni love him eternally for that\ni you know i can acknowledge his flaws\ni can say how messed up his habits are\nyou know i can say anything\nbut it'll never\nyou know give away that love that he\ngave me\nand that love that i offer him\nit sounds like a\nreal hero\nyeah yeah\nit's interesting it's interesting when\nyou mentioned you know he was white i'd\nalready i you know i assumed that he was\nyour biological dad\nyeah\nand i liked it\ni'm sorry\ni can only imagine how much more\nchallenging it is to accept\na child that\nclearly everyone knows is not your child\nand so how much more he\ndeserves our respect\nyeah yeah\num\ni like to call ourselves the jigsaw\nfamily\num because i have a i have an older\nsister who has her own dad\nanother older sister who has her own dad\nand then me has my own dad and then the\nthree younger siblings all have the same\ndad who's the guy i call dad um\nyou know and again dude it's like i have\nso much love for both my parents\nbecause\nmy mom i mean that does not sound like\nan easy family situation to mother right\nthat's a lot of\nties and that's a lot of emotions and\nmy mom never gave up on us you know she\ndid so much for me\num\nshe's she's the reason i run track and\nfield because after\nseventh grade my first year running\ntrack and field i wanted to quit because\ni was like this is hard running sucks\nlike i gotta i gotta work out i gotta\nsweat i gotta\nget tired and she pulled over the car\nshe's like you are running track\nwhether or not like before i die right\nor something you know she said something\nsuper dramatic\nand\nshe saw because it was the only way i\nwas getting to college right we couldn't\npay for it\nuh getting to college without student\nloans\num\nand\nyou know she didn't she didn't really\nteach me how to do homework very well\nuh she didn't\ni took a lot of her procrastination\nwithin myself right\nand a lot of her bad habits within\nmyself but\nyou know just like my dad like as flawed\nas he is and as flawed as she is like\ni'm only running track and field because\nshe made me and i have that chad within\nme\nbecause she made me you know i have\na future in education and college\nbecause she made me she did the mom's\njob and\nso it's like again i don't have hate for\nmy parents i have nothing but love and\nwholesome you know\nhog champs from i think it's more than\nlove\ni think that's what makes this heart\nbecause once again what i'm kind of\ndetecting don is that you're a little\nbit stuck between two things\nso you said that the greatest thing that\na man can do is to make up for the\nfailings of another man\nyeah it's like it's it's pretty it's\npretty uh big greatest honor i think is\nwhat i said i like to say the honor you\nknow kind of\nnightly so i kind of wonder don are you\nmaking up for the failings of your dad\nwhat do you mean by that\ni mean so\nwhen i asked you you know a little bit\nabout\nwhat you thought about your dad you kind\nof said i was like you know could your\ndad i don't remember exactly what the\nquestion was but it was sort of like a\ncould your dad have done a better job or\ndo you think your dad let you down i\nasked some question like that right\ngiving you a chance to poop on dad\nand i was like would you like to poop on\ndad and you're like it's hard to say yes\nright he said i don't want to say yes\nyou didn't say no\nright and then and then we kind of\ntouched on then what you started to do\nquite gallantly may i add\nis rush to dad's defense\nand so magnificently\nbecause who can possibly think that\nyou're there's anything wrong like the\ndude is he's a white five foot ten nerd\nwho's raising\nwho calls the six three\nblack kid his son\nand genuinely loves you as a son like\nhow can\nhow can we toss any shade on on that guy\nright\nyeah yeah\nand and i i get that there's a lot of\ngenuine love i get that your dad went\nabove and beyond and like deserves a ton\nof love and respect\nand at the same time you face certain\nchallenges\nand when you get angry i think you get\nangry with your parents\nwhat i heard over and over again is you\ndidn't like it\nand it felt it was weird and you didn't\nlike it\nand i think that there's like there's a\nyou know an adult within you who can\nunderstand that\nyou know adults have problems and\nsometimes divorce is what it comes down\nto and that like on balance they did a\nfantastic job your mom you know helped\nyou get into track and field your dad\ngave you a love for gaming your dad gave\nyou love in general and so like on the\npro and con column like your your\nparents both win overwhelmingly so\nbut when i hear about your struggles\nthere's like an understory here that i\nthink part of the reason that you may be\nstuck is because like you're not willing\nto acknowledge it\nright i mean like when you\nyou kind of\nit's it's interesting because you said\nthat you used to be able to keep the\nexternal the reason you reached out now\nis because\nyou could keep it in check\nyou said that you used to be able to\nkeep your external life and your\ninternal life parallel\nbut i'm still hearing that there's like\none foot in two different lives\nyou know and i think that i know this\nmay sound like one of these weird like\nspiritual positive things that no one\nknows how to do but as long as you\nyou're living two parallel lives like\ndawn it's never gonna work\nright like you can't be\nlike you have to live your life and like\ni know it's kind of weird because you're\nlike how do you we'll get there so\nthere's there's a lot of practical stuff\nhere but like you know when when there's\nthe losers\nand the jocks\nand you're like\nyou know\nhalfway between those two\nyou know you can't i don't know i mean i\nthink there needs to be some kind of\nlike internal resolution\nabout the life that you want\nand i think some of that stuff\nis\ni mean i'm not out to make your dad seem\nlike a bad dude i mean clearly he's you\nplayed the ultimate ace card\nin terms of you know no one can ever\nthink your dad and i i i i mean like\nlike you know it's it's sort of like 50\nof a joke but like definitely i mean he\ngets away with a lot if he does that\nyeah right yeah yeah\nand so the reason i kind of bring it up\nis not to like put badness on him but\nlike to acknowledge that the things that\nhold you back\nor all the\nlike all the things that he gets a pass\nfor\ncan still negatively impact you and what\nwe're talking about is you it's not i'm\nnot out there and i you know i know i do\nthis a lot where people like i get\npeople to [ __ ] talk their parents it's\nnot that like i'm not trying to [ __ ]\ntalk your parents\nyeah it's that we need to understand\nthat like your dad is propagating\nprobably like\nquite unhealthy behavior\nin all of his kids\nwhich\nall parents do\nright he's not unique they're like i\npropagate on healthy behavior in my kids\nit's impossible i don't even say that\ndude so my kid will wake up at 7 30 in\nthe morning and she'll try to come wake\nme up\nand then\nand i'll like like she'll grab the ipad\nand she's like dad can i can i be on the\nipad and i'm like yeah sure absolutely\nso you know it's terrible but the first\n45 minutes of her day are like spent on\nlike you know\nmelting her brain on youtube which is\nnot what you want for a five-year-old oh\nno\nbut we all propagate bad behavior in our\nkids like i'm not a perfect parent\nthere's no such thing\nand the challenge for you though is it's\nnot about\nbashing your parents for blame it's\nabout understanding what is the impact\nthat you have to deal with\nand as long as we're giving your dad a\npass\nand we're ignoring his effects on you\nthen like how are you going to fix them\nyeah you know\nand so and so i get why you\nit's not\nbash your dad stream\nyeah\nand you know he really does sound like a\ntruly amazing guy like no doubt in my\nmind\nand at the same time like you know\nyou're a nutrition major and like you're\nstarting to learn a little bit about the\nworld and you're beginning to realize\nthat like maybe some like fish sticks\nand you know gaming until three a.m you\nsaid you guys did that four days in a\nrow so like was it summer vacation or\nwas it like\ndude it was probably spring break it was\nokay i mean\nit's good especially even if it's just\nlike a friday\nif there's if they're\nlike it kind of gets the point like if\nthere is no responsibility that i have\nto equip equate to tomorrow right i'll\nshow up to tomorrow\ni'm going to throw away right now\nyou know that kind of that's kind of\nlike how it\nlines up you know and like the more i\nlearn about habits right building habits\nwe are our habits right\ni'll know i'll never be rid of\nthis until you know i get rid of that\nhabit\nof\nthrowing away my night\nif i don't have anything at 8 a.m the\nnext morning right i should just go to\nbed right or something like that you\nknow\nso\nyou know when it was spring break when\nit was summer vacation or anything\nhe would do that as long as we didn't\nhave anything to do tomorrow\nyeah\nso let me ask you\nyou know don i don't know exactly\nif this has been helpful yet\nbut you know i i certainly feel like i\nunderstand you a little bit better and i\nthink it'll like clarify i don't know i\ndon't have a clear sense of let me just\nthink for a second\nwhy do you want to play bass guitar\ndude\ni think personally it's the sexiest\ninstrument\nknown to man um\nwhen i was\ngetting into music\num\nbecause you know when you're when you're\na kid you always listen to what your\nparents listen to\nso\nwhen i turned you know 1314 i kind of\nyou know started touching my own music i\nwas listening to these kids write or\nlisten to music at school you know\nwhatever they were listening to and i\nwent through a lot of stuff i went\nthrough like a little bit of an emo\nphase like mcr because my crush was\nfaith lap and she had the you know she\nwas emails like i gotta listen to this\nstuff you know\num\nthen my 10th grade year i started\nlistening to like\nmy own music like things that i really\nliked\nand a lot of it was bass guitar uh steve\nlacy plays a lot of bass guitar and he\nplays his own bass fit thundercat was a\nhuge one i love thundercat\ntyler crater has some really good\nbass lines in his songs\nand\ni just\ni didn't understand it was bass until i\nstarted looking into the music i was\nlike oh that's that's the bass that's\nthe bass line um\nthen my best friend's dad\num\nhe asked me out of the blue he's like\nplay bass i was like no he's like oh\nthat's [ __ ] like\nevery black person can play bass you\ncould play bass and then that kind of\nlike solidified it for me i was like\nokay i need to learn to play bass right\nnow so i can prove this guy that i can\nplay bass and i'm sick right and so\nalong with like all my love for music\nyou know so it kind of it was kind of\nlike a two-factor humor sense and actual\nlove for the bass\nokay so don\nokay can i think for a second\nplease\nplease\nso you've watched a fair number of our\nstreams\nyeah yeah i always usually turn tune\ninto the vods\nso like you're familiar with like the\nconcepts and stuff that we discuss\nyeah yeah i watch a lot of the youtube\nchannel as well okay so like do you know\nwhat a sum squad is\num\nrefresher please okay so like sometimes\nwe have emotion\nthat gets\nso when our mind experiences emotion\nwe can either\nbury it or process it\nokay\nand generally speaking a lot of the\nemotion that gets buried then manifests\nlater in life in particular\ncircumstances\nso\nwhat i um\ni'm gonna try to like\nput together\ni'm gonna try to like summarize what i\nunderstand\nas your situation and i'm gonna give you\nlike a couple of options\nokay\ngive me just a second\nokay so dawn\nyou know it was interesting when you\nwere telling me a little about yourself\nyou know when i when i mentioned that it\nseems to me like you're stuck between\ntwo worlds\nit's interesting because what i was\nthinking about you are you have any\nexperience with d and d\nyeah yeah okay so like you know i almost\nsaid you seem to me like a half elf\nbecause you're not in the human world\nand you're not in the elf world\nmy characters are always half works my\ncharacters are always half works even\nbetter\nright\nso so like and i'm really glad i steered\nclear that because like i i almost\nbecause given the the racial dynamics in\nyour family like i'm glad i didn't call\nyou just something like that really\ndodged a bullet there really but but but\ni i i do get the sense that there's\nthere's really like in so many different\nways man like you were stuck between two\nworlds\nit's like do you become a jock\nor do you become a nerd\nyou know like like do you play bass\nguitar like you can't play basketball\nbut you're gonna learn bass guitar so\nyou're gonna take advantage of your\nracial bonuses\nyou know absolutely and and so like you\nknow there's just so much there about\nyou know i think who you're trying to be\n[Music]\nthat\nand and i think that that's gonna so if\nif your problem you kind of come up with\nthis problem of like i spend too much\ntime on the computer and we can call\nthat escapism we can say it's due to\nlike some internal conflict or whatever\nbut i'd say the reason you spend too\nmuch time on the computer is a couple of\nthings one is i do believe that there's\nlike an addictive aspect to it\nso like straight up like like what\nyou're describing to me sounds like a\ndopaminergic binge\nwhere you're just like you know you like\nyou need to get that dopamine from like\nattack on titan what's gonna happen next\nwhat's gonna happen i have to know i\nhave to know i have to know you kind of\nget caught up in it the other\ninteresting thing is that given your\nupbringing\none of the things that we've discovered\nfrom studying addictions is that\ngenerally speaking the earlier you get\nexposed the more powerful the addiction\nso um you know when we look at things\nlike pornography addiction like there's\na very good chance that people who are\nexposed to pornography at like a very\nyoung age\nwill be more likely to be addicted to it\nthe same is true for like alcohol and\ncigarettes and marijuana and stuff like\nthat so you know if you start smoking\npot at the age of 12 it's like way\nharder to kick than like if you start\nsmoking a pot at the age of 50.\nso there's some stuff around developing\nbrains and and building habits and stuff\nlike that so i i do think that there's\nlike a dopaminergic aspect to your\nbehavior\nwhich can be kind of addressed on that\nlevel\nbut i i also get the sense that you know\nwhen you're choosing between two goals\nwhat i'm really getting the sense of is\nthat there's like this conflict about\nlike who you want to be\nit's like who does dawn want to wind up\nlike does he want to wind up being a\nweeb or does he want to wind up being\nyou know black guy who can play bass\nbecause generally speaking we don't\nthink about those people as the same\nkind of person which is why i think the\nnext thing to really understand if we\nhad to summarize who you are you're the\nchosen one\n[Laughter]\ni'm the main character yeah you're all\nside characters so so it's it it's it's\nlike and this is where like i i think a\nlot of this is going to come from really\na lot of like introspection about you\nknow where do your goals come from\nare they your goals or are they the\ngoals that come from either part of your\nhuman and your elven heritage\nand i i sort of get you know i i think\nthe\nyou know the story about how you got\ninto base i'm sure will\nupset a lot of people for a lot of\nreasons but i think it's like a great\nstory right genuinely speaking it's it's\nwhen it comes you know our racial\nidentity forms so much of like who we\nare and what we choose to identify with\nand stuff like that i think you know i'm\ni'm brown i'm indian\nand so i you know i did wind up becoming\na doctor and i do do yoga so it's sort\nof like\nyou know i have racial advantages there\num so i think it is there's an element\nof truth to that but i i think what i'm\nsort of really getting from you is that\na couple of different things one is\nyou know you're stuck between these two\nworlds and i think a lot of the goals\nthat arrive in your mind that you\nfall short of are not truly your goals\ni think as you really make them your\ngoals and you sort of deal with that\naddiction piece then it'll help\nso like as they truly become your goals\nas opposed to like societally imposed\ngoals that'll help you achieve them and\nthen you've got habit and dopamine\nrelated stuff that you've got to\novercome for sure the last thing is from\nan emotional standpoint you know this is\nwhere i'm sure we could ask you more\nquestions but like\ni i think that they're you know it seems\nlike the primary thing that you feel\ntowards yourself is like anger and\nfrustration\nand where do you think that anger and\nfrustration comes from\ni think a big thing\ncan come to be like me\nnot being what i think i should be\nin a lot of aspects right\num\nit's i get when you when you met like\nmentioning porn like that's a that's a\nhuge thing for all young adults right\nespecially young males like that\ni hate it right\nand i hate that i you know could be\naddicted to porn especially growing up\nas a teenager like a lot of that anger\nyou know you get that post-nut clarity\nit's just so it's so hard you know\npost-nut depression is not a it's not a\nhealthy thing to\nmove on about it's hard to talk about\nright no one wants to talk about\ntheir own struggles with that\nbut\ni'm telling you now because that to me\nis the clearest\npoint of like where my anger could be\ncoming from like that self\nloathing from what i could be right i'm\nlike i'm not there i'm right here and\ni'm angry about it and it's my fault you\nknow\nyou just lost me a little bit\nsorry\nwhat is this stuff about post not\ndepression\nuh\nso there's there's a joke right you're\nyou're you're watching some sus material\nonline and you know you fit you you\nclimax and then you you get you open\nyour eyes you know you come over the\nwater and you're like this is gross\nstuff like i do not like this right\nthat's usually post not clarity right um\npost\ndepression is just\nthe depression you feel\nof being attached to this being tied to\nit all right being tied to the computer\nthe pornography\num\nit's\nit's it's just it's really just a joke\nlike a play on words\num\nright\nyeah so so are you saying that in the\npost not clarity you're able to see that\nyour life is not where you want it to be\nlike are you\nclearly able to because like you're free\nof all of your like like mechanisms and\nstuff like that oh yeah\nyeah definitely i mean that's yeah yeah\nokay so\nall right sorry i just i\nwas a little bit confused so so you're\nyou know it sounds like you're angry at\nnot being what you think you should be\nyeah yeah and i mean especially this\nlast year\nit's also like angry at what i was um\nbecause i\ni gained a lot of weight in quarantine\nand track and field is a lot track and\nfield's base is about the strength to\nweight distribution how strong you are\nversus how much weight you're carrying\naround\nand i gained like\n25 pounds\nand a year\nand even a little less than a year and\nthat was like not good weight either\nthere was a lot of binge eating and just\ngarbage\nand\nright now where i am i'm in between\nwell i just look back at my high school\nlife right my freshman years i'm like\nman i was so in shape i was so\nmuch more fit than i am now\ni need to be more fit than i was then\nright like that's so i put myself so\nmuch further back\nthan the goal i i wanted i want you know\nand you know then anger and sadness and\nall the emotions come through\nokay\ncan i process that for a second\nplease please go ahead\nwhat do you think is gonna happen to you\ndawn\num\nwhere are you headed\nyou asked me that a year ago\ni would have had this huge awesome\nfive-year plan right\ni'm gonna\ngo graduate college go on this religious\nmission\ncome back\nyou know run professionally\nuh\nkick butt you know\num\nbut my life and my plans have all\nchanged so rapidly\nthat i'm unsure you know\ni\ncan tell you what i want you know i can\ntell you what\nmy metaphysical my my frontal lobe says\ni should want you know i want a solid\nnutrition job\npro runner\nshoe contract deal right with adidas or\nnike or something\nsmoking hot wife you know amazing you\nknow backyard barbecues fourth of july\nbarbecues you know\num\nthen you know there's that you know that\nother side the other the other world the\nother life\num kind of just saying like dude like\nyou don't need to do that you can just\nyou're charming guy you're handsome\nyou're athletic right\nbecome a twitch streamer do it do what\ndr k does right talk talk to the people\nright play video games change the world\nthrough video games right or something\nlike that\nand\nthere's that kind of\npull between like like you said the two\ntwo feet in two worlds\nokay\nso don\ngot these two dreams right\nlet's call one of them the twitch stream\nor one of them\nadidas whatever\nadidas chad yeah today is july 16th it\nis a friday\nthe weekend is coming up\nif you spend the weekend watching anime\nwhat happens to your progress towards\neach of those goals\nit decreases it goes back incorrect\nthere's no difference\nright so like\nhow many to get to the life of your\ndreams how many days does it take\nwe're gonna graduate from college we're\ngonna go on our mission trip get a\nsmoking hot wife become a professional\nrunner land an adidas contract how much\ntime does that take\na lot of time\nyou know years\nhow many years\num\ni would take about four\nat a minimum\nright\nyeah so four years is like\n1300 days\nsure\nif you take a if you take a break\nfor three days\nwhat difference does it make\nsee i see i see what you're saying i get\nit\nright so what's the cost of you spending\na week or two playing kotor two kotor\none and two\nwell you know you could\nlook at it you know grand scheme listing\nlike oh it doesn't cost much in the\ngrand scheme but then within these\nlittle little deals right i didn't go\nspend time with my friends playing kotor\nuntil i didn't go outside much i didn't\nspend time with a lot of my family you\nknow\ni guess\nthat is the cost that's the cost with\nyeah\nnow we get to a really tricky thing\nwhich is which way does your brain look\nat it so your brain calculates behavior\nright\nit calculates to engage in a behavior or\nnot engage in a behavior when you have\nfive years to do something\nwhich way like you know i know it sounds\ngood actually i'll just sort of say it\nbut like your brain calculates it\nin the long term not in the short term\nwhich is why procrastination is\nconserved across the human race\nright so if you have a month like no\none's studying for a test that's one\nmonth away\nand like if you think about it you know\nif all like not all but you know 90 the\nhuman beings that have not been\nconditioned or built habits\nto start studying 30 days before the\ntest the default human behavior is to\nwait until the last minute\nand i think your biggest issue and this\nis where like it doesn't matter which\nworld you're stuck in because in either\ncase like what's the cost of a weekend\nis absolutely nothing and this is why\nour generation\nis\nscrewed from weekend to weekend\nbecause what's the cost\nnothing it's just a couple of days\nthere's more days\nwhat's gonna happen seven days from now\nyou're gonna get another weekend\nyou can do it then\nand i i know it sounds kind of weird but\nlike you know i i think there's a lot to\nlike understanding you know your\ninternal conflict and stuff like that\ni do think there's a lot to understand\nabout your anger towards yourself\nbecause that i think is is to a certain\ndegree like related to\n[Music]\na lot of anger that you have from other\nplaces and you're kind of taking it out\non yourself\nso so this is sort of where like you\nknow you're you're upset with your dad\nfor helping you get into this situation\nright like do we want to\nwe want to forgive him sure on balance\ndid he do an awesome job absolutely\nand like don't tell me because when\nyou're walking around and you're\nsteaming right like who are you blaming\nmyself\nand your parents\nyou said that earlier it did i did say i\nwas getting angry at my parents and and\nwhat what kind of thoughts does your\nmind produce\nyeah so like can you give me an example\nof like what in what way you get angry\nwith your parents\nparents specifically i just get\nget jealous of my friends and their\nparents\num good tell me what are you jealous of\nbetween your friends and their parents\nstability that's a big one\nmy in my area it's really low divorce\nrate in my area\nand\nget really jealous i mean because i\nagain it's like that adult side of you\ntells yourself right you're like\nevery every you know\npast problems you know every family has\nissues right\nbut then you know my kids side looks i'm\nlike man i'd rather have those issues\nthe issues they're having and the issues\ni'm having right\nwhat especially\nyeah go ahead sorry i was gonna say\nespecially when i get grow closer\num\nsaying like a it takes a village to\nraise a kid right or raise a whatever\nthat was really really true in my sake\num\noutside of my own family i have like\nfour families\nwhere i could just walk into the door\nright and they'll say like oh hey dom\nand you know they already have a plate\nset up for me right\num and i'm really close and really\nthankful for those families so i know\nkind of their family issues i see the\nsibling arguments i see the parents\ndoing whatever\num\nwhen i was a kid\nto answer your question like what\nspecific issues when i was a kid i just\nhated having to move from week into\nweekend\nespecially when my parents moved further\naway\ni couldn't see my friends on some\nweekends just because i didn't have a\ncar\nmy parents were at work we can't we\ncan't make the 40-minute drive down to\nsuch-and-such city\ngo hang out with your friends right\nyou're just gonna have to sit and hang\nout right and i hated that and i was\nlike man i wish the whole family\nfamily's just in one spot right\num another one is kind of just\nreassurance that your parents love each\nother you know\num\ndon't take for granted if your parents\ntruly love each other\num that's a wonderful example to you\nabout true love right as a for a kid\nand i kind of really\ndidn't have that growing up you know i\ndidn't have that\ngolden globe of like this is what a\nmarriage could be this is this is what\nyou could produce like look at that look\nhow wonderful this family is right you\nhave all these kids and they are married\nnow and you're getting nieces and\nnephews and we're all here spending time\ntogether\nuh my family can't really do that you\nknow and i just\ni get angry and i get jealous and i just\nget sad you know because not only do i\nwant that there's the realization that i\ntruly don't have that i have to go to\nsleep with that knowledge you know i\nhave to wake up with that knowledge i\nhave to go to fourth like going to two\nchristmases as a kid\nsounds like a cool idea right two two\nbirthday presents\ndude the pain\nof driving away from one of my parents\nhomes from christmas morning\nand seeing them wave\non the sidewalk\njust tears me up inside especially as i\nget older especially because i'm the one\ndriving my siblings around right you\nwake up at my dad's house and\nhaving to say goodbye to a parent on\nchristmas morning\ngo to another christmas morning is\nsickening and i hate it\nand\nseeing the pain in their eyes because\nthey love us right they don't want to be\nalone on christmas morning they don't\nwant to be alone\nanytime\nand\ngoing 11 years like that it's just so\ndraining and\ni don't think\npeople you know they don't acknowledge\nthose moments\nwithin the divorce you know they don't\nacknowledge those 15 sentence 15 second\ninteractions\nthat you have nightmares about and it's\njust\nit's awful\nyeah man it's it's\nyou know i know we\nso like there's i think a bias in\nwestern society towards like\nthe individual over the unit\nso generally speaking you know there's\nthis sentiment that\nit's better to have two happy people\nthat are divorced\nrather than raise a kid\nin an unhappy marriage\nwhich as a psychiatrist i mean i have a\nbias in terms of my sample size right\nbecause the people who come to me are\nthe ones who are a little bit unhappy\ni'm not so sure that's actually the case\nthough\ni i i i when i hear stories like yours\nand the problem is basically every story\nof divorce that i've heard\ni'd say easily 80 percent are like yours\nwhere it does actually and this is\nsomething that i think is a is something\nthat gets propagated like\nyou know parents will tell themselves\nall kinds of things to justify\nbeing able to get a divorce\nand they can't tolerate the idea that\nlike this could actually hurt your child\nand we as a society sort of say that\ndivorce doesn't hurt children whereas i\nhaven't seen that\ni've seen that just about in all cases\ndivorce does hurt children\ni'm not saying that it's not a good idea\nto get divorced i'm not saying that\nthere aren't good reasons to get\ndivorced it's just i'm the one you know\nthe kid walks into my office\n20 years later\nand and so that's just what i see\num but i i think it's it's kind of\ndangerous because like when you said you\nknow everyone thinks two christmases is\ngood oh man the can the most\nconsistently terrible thing that i've\nheard from kids of divorced parents or\nholidays\nnever do you feel so trapped so there's\nno way to make every anyone happy\nand it's it's just it's a it's just [ __ ]\nfor everyone involved\nand this this time that's supposed to be\nlike happy and celebrating ends up being\njust like painful for everyone and it\nhappens every year\nand even especially with all the\nmarketing it's just\nit's bad continue sorry i mean it even\ngets to the point where sometimes i'll\nyou know when i work with like patients\nlike we'll even have to set limits so i\nhave some patients that over time have\ngrown to actually tell their parents\ni actually can't come home for the\nholidays anymore and see either of you\nbecause the toxicity is just so high i\ndon't have the bandwidth for it\ni'm gonna just be by myself during\nchristmas and i will come and visit each\nof you for one week at a time and we're\ngonna hang out and i'll fill you in but\ni just can't do it during the holidays\nbecause there's just no peaceful way to\ndo it it's crazy\nuh where things end up\nbut kind of coming back to you don i\nmean here's what i think like\nso there's a lot of that anger pent up\nfrustration with your self frustration\nwith your your parents i think the more\nthat you acknowledge that i think the\nbetter off you're gonna be\num\nnot to say that you i mean i think it\ndoes sound like you you know you feel it\nand stuff but i i think the real issue\nhere and i want to talk a little bit\nabout goal setting is that\nso when you look at your life and you\nsay i wish it wasn't like this i wish it\nwas this and then you build together\nthis five-year plan because you're you\nknow you have a touch of the chad within\nyou your chad touched not faye touched\nnot fiend touched your chad touched\nright\nuh\nyou're you're you're a chad touched half\nwork\ntotally totally and and and so then what\nhappens is your mind still builds these\nkinds of like goals for you you're like\nokay i want to be a twitch streamer i\nwant to be this i want to be this\nuh look at the chad drinking milk\nyes this is strong strong bones\nit's not like an energy drink\nno no [ __ ]\nso so\nthat's a lesson for everyone who's\nwatching by the way you're gonna\nyou know i'll i'll do one more\num\nso i think that\none of the\nyou know i think when it comes to your\ngoals and what you want to do but what i\nwould say to you don is to really think\na little bit about a given day\nand don't think about the goal but ask\nyourself in a weird way like who do you\nwant to be today\nlike do you want to be someone who\ni know it may it may bring up the\nself-loathing but i'd say actually\ntackle it head-on\nand sort of you know ask yourself like\nas you're about to watch like what are\nyou going to do this weekend don\ni'm asking it's a genuine question yeah\nyeah yeah yeah uh my buddy's getting\nmarried um\ni'm gonna go i'm gonna be groomsman\nwe're gonna hang out and swim and\nchillax\nyou know\nsome play some video games maybe smash\nbros meta who knows\nso so let me ask you don is that the\nperson that you want to be\nyeah yeah it is especially\nit's especially because it is like\nespecially these people these people i'm\ngoing to um luckily throughout the years\ni've been able to acquire\nuh companions in my dnd campaign because\ni'm the main character right\num\npeople who just love me right both the\nwebsite and the chad side right they\nthey understand that like they come to\nme with star wars questions because they\nknow i've read every single comic book\nand every single eu book like i know\neverything right um\nthey come to me with comic\nrecommendations when they when they want\nso but they also you know they support\nme at track meets they support my\nhealthy activities so these guys\ni i really\nwant to like be\nwith them so yes these like that's\nthese people are awesome so like like at\nthe end of the weekend are you gonna\nfeel drained or\nbe filled with self-loathing\num\nthis this kind of gets\ninto like a different material\nuh\nbecause and i it feels weird you know\nwe're already a bit into it and opening\nup a new can of worms is a bit weird but\nespecially this past few year it's been\nreally hard\nconnecting\nthe people who like actually love me but\nlike feeling connected\num\nbecause there are times when i'll go\nhang out with my best friend brian right\nand\nthen\nyou know something will go wrong or\num\nyou know specifically uh he'll ditch me\nor like something like that will go on\nand i'll come home and i'll just feel\nlike\nawful and i'll just feel like wow this\nis really sex because when when i have\nso few of like the real friends\nwhen my own mind senses that it's not\ngoing right it just kind of\nspins out of control\num\nit's like it could be like i can go into\nthis wedding and i can go and i can just\nyou know my jokes are firing off i'm\nkilling it\nand i feel loved and i feel accepted and\ni feel on top of my game\nbut if i go and like something doesn't\nfeel right to me\nor\nit doesn't like i don't feel loved or\nsomething like that i get i get into\npretty deep dark places\nand\nthat that kind of game\nhas been what i've been playing for like\nthe past four months\num\nfour or five months with\ncan you help me understand what you mean\nby a deep dark place\num\none of you my favorite stream that i've\nwatched of you\nwas the suicidality one\nbecause\nit explained the\nthe the phases and the spectrum of all\nof it and how every single one is\ndangerous every single every single step\nof it is important\num\nbecause\ni think one of the ways you phrased it\nwas\nhow i was sleeping like man i don't want\nto wake up tomorrow\nand i'm going to like actively stop\nmyself from waking up tomorrow and\nthings like that i'm like on the left\nside of like i don't want to wake up\ntomorrow because\nif it gets to that point where i'm like\nkind of just running through in my head\ni feel that like man i don't want to go\nto sleep\ni don't want to wake up tomorrow so i'm\njust like i'm just going to stay up but\ni don't want to i don't want to stay up\ni just want this night to be over and i\nlike end up running through the circle\nand\nwhat's helped me with that is writing\nactually i've become big big into\nwriting i actually\ni i restarted my high school blog and\ni've been writing i've been writing on\nstuff like that\nand\num especially these last like three\nweeks\nit's been pretty\npretty bad because a lot of stuff that's\nhappened in the past is coming up and\nlike specifically my my best friend\nuh\nitching me um i'll just kind of explain\nwhat happened um and new year's new\nyear's eve\nof 2000\njust just this last new year's eve i had\nthree buddies that i really really\nwanted to hang out with\nlike each one of them bailed on me and\nwent to their own parties and it wasn't\nlike oh like i'm doing this instead of\nthis dom like come hang out with me like\ni called him i was like hey what what\ntime do you want me to pick you up he's\nlike oh sorry dude like\ni'm so plastered right now i'm already\nat this one thing i gotta i'm gonna stay\nhere and then he hung up right and i was\nlike oh\ncool like awesome\nand\nthen i ended up going to this one other\nparty with someone else and he ended up\nleaving halfway through the party and\nlike i had to find a ride home talking\nyou know talking to other people and\nwhen\ni don't think i really processed it then\nbecause now\nwhen something like that happens\ni just\nfall apart i just i i fall apart and\nand again i need to go take a walk and i\nneed to go take a thing and like again\nwhen you fall apart what is happening in\nyour mind\nnot wanting to exist i'm just gonna be\nhonest i'm just gonna be frank and i'm\njust gonna be honest and i i'm not gonna\ntry and\nbecause i don't know who's gonna watch\nthis right it's it's scary speaking this\nto the world\num because who knows in a week my\nbuddies i'm talking about watch this and\ni freak you know they're like why didn't\nyou talk to me and it's like dude\nso continuing\num just not wanting to exist\nit's truly like that it's not like man i\nwant to kill myself it's like i just\ndon't want to be here i don't i don't\nwant to\nhave this you know what is your\nexperience of existence in that moment\ndude it's\nit's it's it's weird\nit\nit\none one one way is like i'll like look\nat myself in the mirror\ni'll be like seeing someone else like\nlook at me i'm like that like i don't\nwant that right like it kind of gets\nlike that i'm like i need to get outside\nright so i'll go outside\nwhat does the other person see when they\nlook in the mirror\ndude that thing is like i don't know\nit's not like something like\nit's not like\ni'm like talking to it or like\ncommunicating it's like that's just like\ni look at it and like that's not me\nright so i end up needing like a\nsensation so like i'll splash cold water\nin my face i'll go outside like feel\nwind right if i'm inside there's like no\nwind and like if i feel the wind i'm\nlike okay like cool cool right um\nsomething that i actually\nuh\ndo a lot now after watching your\nsuicidality stream\nis\ni used to\ni used to want to just go get drunk\ni've never drank before which was the\nweirdest thing to me right and i didn't\nthink much of it until i watched your\nsuicidality stream\nand you're telling me about how\nquickly the decision of suicide is how\nquickly decision of suicide is made\nand how much alcohol propagates that\nlike how much it swings that\num\nbecause one for some reason i've always\nbeen fascinated quote-unquote like my\nsuicide side's always been fascinated\nwith getting hit by a car\nand like stepping in front of a train\nand just something quick like a hard\nimpact and i get the sense that like\nwhen i do\nlike i'll just i'll just free fall and\ni'll fall through the air and i'll roll\nand then like my life is out of my hands\nyou know\nand like\nit's it's so it's so weird because all i\ngot\ni after watch again after watching your\nsuicidality stream\num i look back at my life and realize\nlike that's been a thing\nthroughout my whole life i'd drive to\ntrack practices or track workouts or\ntrack meets where i really didn't want\nto go i'd say to myself like man i\nreally wish a car would just hit me like\nman i just i really wish i just\nnot have to do\nwhat i'm about to do right\nand i used to not think it was a big\ndeal because i didn't have a plan right\ni didn't i'm not planning on suicide\nit's not like this and you're telling me\nyou are telling me you're like this is\nscary right\nand then i believed it so instead of\nindulging in alcohol when i go on these\nwalks i'll buy a bunch of candy i'll\njust\neat all the candy i'll drink soda\num\ni'll you know get an energy and i eat\nhealthy i drink milk\nso like these moments i kind of like\nindulge myself and\nstep away from that kind of stuff so\nanyways\nsorry how long have you been having\nthese um thoughts of just wanting to\nescape from your situation\num\na long time a really really long time\nit's not it's not like an everyday thing\nyeah do you do you remember how old you\nwere when you first had these kinds of\nthoughts\ni guess the first like prevalent\nsentence of like i want to escape\nwas my\nhad to have been\nsophomore year of high school because i\nhad dreads i had long dreads back in\nhigh school it was super cool\num\ni was driving and i just finished a\ntrack meet and we actually won the track\nmeet and i destroyed i\nwas carrying the big trophy i had four\ngold medals\nand we went to we went to a restaurant a\npopular burger joint\nthat\nit's tradition in my community that when\nwhen your sport your team does well you\ngo to the burger joint right you go eat\nthe burgers\nand we went to the burger joint the bus\ndropped us off and everything\nand\nhad a great time and i was driving home\ni just felt so alone\nand i just felt like everyone there was\njust like congratulating me only because\num\nbecause i was an athlete and i was good\nright\num because i also i grew up in a really\nreally white area and like they only\ntalked to me because i was black and\nthings like that\nand\ni was driving and i was driving and i\njust i started speeding up i was like i\ndon't want this i don't want this or i\nwant this and there was a there was a\nstone wall\nat the end of the street and like i was\nfixated on like driving into the stone\nwall\nand just\nlike getting in a car wreck\nand i ended up slowing down you know i\ndidn't i didn't go through with it but i\nthink that was like the first\nlike sentence of like i don't want this\nlike first like conscious thought\nbecause i guess you can you know we\ncould talk about escapism through movies\nand video games throughout my whole life\nlike that was the first time where it\nlike manifested into action you know\nyeah it sounds quite scary\nyeah\nand i just again like i don't know i\ndidn't really acknowledge it until you\nknow recently where i was like oh wow\nlike so dawn\nthat's the first time it became manifest\nbut\ni feel like we've talked about\nthe sentiment of i don't want this\nbefore over the course of this\nconversation\ndoes anything come to your mind about\nwhat we've talked about that you really\ndidn't want and really didn't like\nyeah i mean\nespecially within this conversation like\nmy own parents didn't want my parents\nuh\na life situation i didn't want to be\npoor growing up you know didn't want to\nmove around a bunch\num\ni mean even if you really if you really\nlook deep into what we've talked about\nbut i can no because like i didn't want\nto be a track athlete i had before i was\nforced to be a track athlete in a sense\nby my mom\num\ni didn't i d sometimes you know\ni don't want to be black especially\ngrowing up around here um with with my\nown dad i mean\nit's it's the little things because we'd\nbe at a gas station right\ni'm like six one right i'm 12 years old\nand i'm like six one my dad's still i\nstill like dad's still five two and all\nmy younger siblings are\ntiny white people right\nand\nwe're we're at the gas station getting\ndrinks and treats and i put my stuff\nnext to my siblings the register person\nsaid like is he with you to my family\nright\num because you know\nno fault on them because i looked like a\nyoung man\ntrying to sneak some kibbles and\nfreaking with this with this nice white\nfamily right\nso it's like even a sense of like i\ndon't want to be white or black i want\nto be white you know and like dude i\nremember\noh my gosh this is a weird memory that\njust showed up i remember wanting my\nhair to look like justin bieber's\nbecause it wouldn't because everyone\nloved justin bieber i was a kid i was\nlike man i want to look like that but my\nhair curls you know my hair doesn't do\nthat right\ni remember\ngetting like gel\nand like making it like a mohawk like\nlike like all the other kids in like\n2006 you know 2007 they all have that\nlike spiky mohawk and they're wearing\ntheir monster shirts right and i wanted\nto look like that because that's what\neverybody else looks like you know\nand my siblings didn't even look like me\nyou know no one looked like me growing\nup\nand i guess like even that can be like a\nsense of like i don't want this i don't\nwant to be\nyou know\nto be or not to be\nwhat makes the difference\nthat's that's one of my writing that's\nfrom that's from my blog so maybe i'll\npost a link in chat go read my blog\nall right\ndon so i i think um\nthank you so much for sharing all that\nuh don't worry you know for what it's\nworth i say this with love i think you'd\nlook absolutely ridiculous with the\njustin bieber haircut\nhe did i looked so bad i went to the\nmuseum with it because my friends were\ntaking me to the museum it was so bad\ndude oh\npoor poor 10 year old dom he just wanted\nto be cool he just wanted to look good\nyou know and i i think i think here we\nsee the you know the stuck between two\nworlds right like it makes sense man\nlike you have you have this conflict\nyou really are like the chosen one in in\nthe last of you're like the last of the\nuchiha it's like do you want to be in\ndo you want to be like one of these\ngood homies from konoha like which one\ndo you want to be i'd rather\nfreaking i'd be sure i'd be shikamaru\ni'd want to be shikamara if i was a\nnaruto character but\nit's\ntough dude\nbecause i i mean i i'm seeing the the\nyou know 10 year old with justin bieber\nhaircut or the bass playing dreadlock\nstyle\noh the two the two sides of the same\ncoin man\nsame person though that's the craziest\nthing to me it's like it's\nalso that's the same person that's all\nwithin me you know\nit's hard to like hate one side of it\nand be like oh i can't do that because\nthat's it's i truly want that right\nthat's something that not it's not\nforeign right so don i'm gonna actually\ndisagree with you a little bit\ni don't think either of those is you\nokay i think it's fine for you to want\nthose things i think that want is\ngenuine but i think actually your\njourney is about figuring out who you\nare\nnot what you want to be\nwhat you want to be is not who you are\nit's what you want to be\ni know it sounds kind of weird but like\ni don't think either of those things is\nyou\nmake sense you are not an orc and you\nare not a human\nyou're a half-orc it's its own thing has\nits own racial bonuses\nhas its own stat adjustments\nand play a half work like an orc you're\ngonna lose dude if you play a half work\nlike a human\nyou're gonna lose oh no\nright so i think it's like justin bieber\nhaircut bass playing anime t-shirt\nmilk drinking\ni actually i almost i almost wore my\nhouse moving castle shirt on stream yeah\nand i've been like oh no i can't do that\nright and i i don't know exactly what i\nmean by that i don't know how you figure\nout who you are but\ni i do think that i am getting the sense\nof um you know just in terms of the\nyou know it sounded like an ad for the\nsuicidality stream which is kind of\nawesome dude it's awesome dude that\nstream okay literally changed my life\nliterally so you know i don't\ni should probably say this for legal\nreasons but seriously don i don't know\nif you've ever worked with a therapist i\ndon't know if you you know if you're in\ncollege and stuff there may be like\nstudent health resources i think it's\nlike not a bad idea\num especially in your case i think\nthere's a lot that you could work\nthrough in terms of your parents divorce\nkind of figuring out who you are and\nmost importantly if you really do\nhaving thoughts of not wanting to be\nthere is actually like a normal human\nexperience\nuh going to bed and wishing you never\nwake up is a normal human experience\nand also you know\ndriving down a road and speeding up and\nlooking longingly at a brick wall is\n[ __ ] dangerous\nright and and so this has been my\nexperience as a psychiatrist which is\nlike it's almost like rng it's like\nyou're opening a loot box and 99 times\nout of a hundred you won't you'll slow\ndown\nbut the whole point of that suicidality\nstream was explaining to people that\nlike it can be and ultimately it's\nusually an impulsive decision i'm not\nworried about you like in this moment it\ndoesn't you know i'm not gonna pick up\nthe phone and call 9-1-1 because i'm not\ngetting that sense from you and at the\nsame time it's worth taking very\nseriously\num\ni also don't want this\nconversation to turn into\nthat i think we're still talking about\nyou and and what i'm hearing from that\nis it's just a part of who you are i\nthink it's a manifestation of some of\nyou trying to figure out like who you\nwant to be and what you want\ni am detecting one hell of a some scar\nthough that there's something really\nhere about like i don't like this i\ndon't want it this is not\nand and\nit's interesting because you really\ndescribe it um like a trigger right like\nif if you have an interpersonal letdown\nby someone that you care about\nyou feel very acutely unloved\nand that that can feel like a very\nintolerable state\nthat is absolutely something that it is\nworth seeing a therapist about because\nthe real the real thing there is you\nknow we don't we haven't asked you much\nabout your personal relationships but\nthe reason i think that's really work\nworth working on if if you or anyone\nelse has that kind of experience is that\nif you do wind up in a romantic\nrelationship that's important to you\nthat will rear its ugly head\nbecause they are not going to be\navailable to you 24 7.\nright so you're going to get that thing\nis going to be triggered even if you're\nin a relationship with someone who\nreally loves you and cares about you so\nunderstanding that experience is kind of\nimportant and being able to work through\nit\nyou know i\ni feel like i should advise you or guide\nyou in some way what do you think don\nis it enough to talk about what we\ntalked about or do you want some sort of\nlike\nplan it's been\nit's been it's been nice to just talk\nabout it\num because i've tried talking about it\nwith people in my life but it never\ncame out like this in like a cohesive\nway you know\nalways be\nlike i'll start talking and we'll hyper\nfocus on one thing and i'll feel like\nnothing happened you know like i didn't\ntalk about anything actually\num\nso much as like a plan\ni i'm\na bit unsure like again like\nyou kind of just like disagreeing with\nme in like the sense that i'm i'm not\nwho i want to be like that's that's a\nthat's a cool thought like i've never\nthought about that\nand like a big reason i did want to\nreach out was i\ni saw how you talked and like\nbug\nideas out of people you know with your\nyour probing questions\nand i was like man like that's that's\nawesome and like even like the life\ncoaches like i think those would be\nyou know they're trained to do the\nbasically same things and like that\ni don't i don't think i'm helpless you\nknow i don't think\nlike sometimes sometimes i do feel like\nchained to the ground right and like all\nthese chains or my vices you know\nlike i don't i think\ni think the key is within me to those\nchains you know and like i have i have\nto find them\nwhether or not i go like a psychiatrist\nisn't going to fix me\npsychiatrists will help me fix me right\na psychiatrist will do all that within\ntheir power to\nfix me\nlike that kind of applies to you like i\ndon't i don't think\ni don't think anything that we figure\nout within you know the next whatever\nminutes we have left or we do\nis going to be like\nthe golden standard it'll definitely\nhelp and anything you do say that helps\nbut like again i think listening\nhas helped and like just discussing\nand\na throwback back and forth and talking\nto someone who knows nothing about me\nlike exploring me with that person is i\nthink valuable and i've\nit's like you have helped in a sense\nyou've made me feel better within as\nwell like as as cheesy as that sounds\nlike that morale bonuses are no jokes\nyeah so don i'm very happy to hear that\nuh uh and i think i think that you know\nthat if if you take one thing away from\nthe conversation it's\nyou know what you kind of said about\nyou're not who you want to be\nbecause yeah\nand and because i i think that like who\nyou because i i know it sounds kind of\nweird but i think twitch chat knows the\nreal you\nthat's scary i think i know the real you\nand i think that dude's absolutely a\nchat he's not a chat in the way that\nlike you're you know\nnot in the traditional sense but i i\nthink we've gotten to see the real you\ntoday\nand i have like absolute faith in that\nperson i think the only problem is you\nget so confused\nabout\nbeing what you think you should be\nlike\nbeing human or being or\neither direction\nthat you don't really acknowledge that\nyou're really a half work\nbecause i think it's fine for you to\nhave a you know howl's moving castle\nt-shirt when you play bass and i think\nwe we actually all know we know who you\nare i mean you've made it pretty clear\nyeah from the get-go that you can\neat healthy and like you know take care\nof yourself and be physically in shape\nand learn how to play bass guitar and\nspend you know weekend here there\nwatching attack on titan like that's act\nthat sounds great sounds sounds like\nyou're done actually\nyou know\nand that's that's the really weird thing\nwhich i'd really encourage you to think\nabout is that you have all these goals\nfor like what you want to be but like i\nthink if you just keep on growing the\nperson that you are as opposed to\nstriving for a particular goal you'll\nend up\nin a really good place\ni think if you even i know it sounds\nkind of weird but i think you're in a\npretty decent place it sounds like you\ndo deal with a lot of like negative\nemotions that can come up\nbut you'll you know\nthat process\nhow can i say this\nyou know the goal the way you deal with\nthose emotions is by living through them\nwith a certain amount of like\nthoughtfulness and attention\nright like it could be journaling on\nyour blog it could be seeing a therapist\nit could be\nyou know\ntalking to your coach i don't know if\nyour parents know about your struggles\nit sounds like they kind of don't but\nlike that's where you know giving them\nan opportunity to like letting your dad\nbe your dad\nyou know telling him hey dad\ndid you ever like\nthink that like\nmaybe playing games like did it ever\ninterfere with your life because i feel\nlike\nyou know sometimes like you know you\ntell them the story you told us about\nthe coach and the training schedule and\nstuff like that tell your mom right and\nbe prepared for them to not\nbe able to listen to you\nbecause your mom will be like what the\nhell is wrong with you stop playing\ngames right just stop so you'll get that\nfrom your mom sorry whoops\njust turn off the computer silly yeah\nbut i mean you know i think it could be\na really like\nconnecting conversation to ask your dad\nlike really not in a judgment sort of\nway but say hey dad i'm struggling with\nthis did you ever struggle with it\nand i think that the last bit that i\nwould tell you is you know on a given\nday i know it sounds kind of weird but i\nthink when you think about the goal\nyou can afford to lose a day\nyou can afford because remember the\nattack on titan binge is not a you don't\nbinge the whole week\nin a day\nyou binge one day and then the next day\ncan i afford to watch attack on titan\nyeah i can kind of get away with it and\nthen the next day can i kind of get away\nwith it it's like yeah i can get away\nwith it\nand so i if there's one question that i\nencourage you to ask yourself is that\nwhen it comes to a given task as best as\nyou can\nwith awareness ask yourself\nwho do i want to be today\ndo i want to be someone who spends\nthis hour watching attack on titan\ndo i want to spend the day being\nlike what's more important to me on this\nday maybe that's actually the better\nquestion and you may be surprised this\nis going to be challenging but you may\nbe surprised because oftentimes the\nanswer may be\nit's actually really hard for me to go\nand meet up my friends\nmeet up with my friends down the street\nand actually like on this day and in\nthis moment this is actually what i want\nto do there can be self-loathing that\ncomes with that which is fine\nbut you don't want to like pile up the\nself-loathing and then experience it at\nthe end of the weekend i want you to\nlike deal with each piece as it arises\nand really just think about you know who\ndo you want to be today\nand i think you will find that like\nthe answer will be a half work like\nyou're not going to be an orc and you're\nnot going to be a human\ntoday i do today i want to practice bass\nand you know what today anime is more\nimportant than bass and on another day\nbass is going to be more important than\nanime\nthoughts thank you\nthank you i mean that's\nfirst thought is thankfulness i mean\nthat's\nthat's some powerful stuff i like\ni really like the idea that i am not\nwhat i want to be\nyou know it's not\nit doesn't define\nwho i am like who i am\nis the person i wake up as\nyou know\nand\nthat can change you know the ability to\nchange is\nhard but powerful you know\nit's slowly i always i like to say\nwell there's a quote\nhistory turns on hinges\nand i i think that's the same for people\nas well\nyou know it takes data day by day\nto\n[Music]\nbecome\nyourself you know\nand as long as i'm\ntaking two days to become this person\nand two days to become the other person\ni'm always gonna be one day in the\nmiddle you know and so i'm always gonna\nbe\njust in that weird friction place or you\nknow i can\nkind of like accept my person in the\nmiddle you know instead of\nthey're like oh i need to only be\nathlete chad gika chad you know\nand the other side is like i need to be\na\ncheesy eating\nvermintide two player or whatever you\nknow who\ncares like\ni'm you know i'm thankful and it's like\nit's also something to chew on right\nbecause within these like these dark\nweekends like i feel like i just sit and\nlike again just look in the mirror or\nnot know what to think about and then i\nend up thinking about things i don't\nwant to think about you know hard things\nhurtful things you know and\nhaving that kind of sense of mind\nthat\ni can kind of like direct where my\nthoughts are going\nit gives me comfort you know gives me\nstability i think so i thank you for\nthat\nwell you're very welcome don\ndid you you're kind of a gig of chad\nyourself\nyou know what\ni did\nnot i know it's kind of\nweird but what makes you think i'm a\ngiga chad\ndude i have a personal belief that chad\nit's a mentality thing it's not a\nphysique thing it's not a\nwhat is the mentality of a giga chad\ni raise others up that's the thing i\nmean it kind of that kind of ties into\nyou know what my dad did for me but like\nwe're on this planet together bro like\nlet's raise each other up when i think\nabout you know people at the gym\nhelp out the weaker one you know or the\nperson who's not doing good form just\nhelping each other out that's a gigan\nchat you know not the\n200 pound person who's only looking at\nhimself you know 200 pound uh\nbodybuilder you know so when i think\nwhen i think of gigachat i think of\npeople like you you know who's kind of\nwho has his life set up\nhas his life in a situation that can\nyou know he can live the rest of his\nlife\nthan you know on the side like you said\nyou're not a streamer\nhere you are on twitch helping out\nlittle old me\nyou know with with my mentality and how\nmany people are watching what 5k people\nwatching you know who knows if two\npeople in there\nare being changed to me that that's\nthat's a giga chat so when i say you're\na giga chat that's that's what i think\nso i'm sure that i look like a giga chad\nfrom the outside\nbut i would say to you don that you and\ni are exactly the same\nand and i i'm not just i know it sounds\nkind of like oh like that's what a geeky\nchad would say\nyou know i got that i understand that\nyeah but but i think this really\nimportantly needs to be understood\nthe problem don is that when you wake up\nand you try to be anything\nthat's the mistake\nlike you are what you are right and in\nthat moment you need to ask yourself\nlike what do i want to do right now\nbecause we think about who i am is\nsomething that's longitudinal over time\nbut it's not\nwho you are is only present in the\nmoment\nso i'd agree with you that a lot of giga\nchads have a mentality and that\nmentality is to not try to be a chat at\nall but just like what do i want to be\nin this moment devote yourself fully to\nlike when you went like today i don't\nknow where you are what time zone you're\nin but it's friday right\nit's 2 15 in central time and so like\nwhat are you gonna do for the rest of\nthe day that's who you are\nyou cannot like who you are is defined\nby your thoughts and your actions\nmore importantly your actions\nand so like what are you gonna do today\nand be like and it's okay for you to\nlike\nyou know be a degen person from time\nlike i do it too\nyou know like dinner for me last night\nlike oftentimes i eat healthy but dinner\nfor me last night was like a leftover\ntaco\nand like a glass of milk and some indian\nsnacks because it was just it had been a\nlong day\nand then today i'm gonna like eat better\nyou know and and so just you are you're\nalready exactly what you need to be and\nthe giga chad is one who realizes that\nthat it's okay to like not be where you\nwant to be\ni like that right\nand like the more that you like are you\ngonna be a professional athlete one day\nsure why not\nbut today are you going to be someone\nwho does your practice or not because\nforget about the professional athletes\nlike what are you going to be today\nyeah\nyeah\npowerful stuff you can't\ncan't skip today man\ni always want to montage rocky montage\nmy way through\nthrough life you know and then show up\nat the end but\nexactly so\nso one of my mentors once told me that\nno one wants to write a book\neveryone wants to have written a book\nyeah that's the problem with the goal\nmentality right you want like oh i want\nto have a backyard i want a barbecue you\nwant you want to be at the end like you\nwant to be at the end of the story\nno one wants to live through it\nyeah dude\nit's true\nand the biggest paradox is it's the\npeople who chase the end that never get\nthere\nand it's the people who let go of the\nend that are the ones that become the\ngiga chats\nso i do you meditate\ni i've been trying to um usually in the\nmornings\nsometimes i just fall asleep and it's i\nalways laugh myself\nthat's okay so if you fall asleep while\nmeditating\num\ni\nthat just means your body needs sleep\nso so that's okay stock\nstock\num\nbut i i'd give you one practice\nuh\nlet me just think about this\nso you say that sometimes you look in\nthe mirror\nand\nyou don't like what you see\nyeah it's it's like a mix of like not\nliking what i see and like not\nrecognizing it and that it's kind of\nlike why i don't like it like it's not\nit's not me you know it's not\ni just don't like it you know\nwhether or not how i get there\ni don't like it\nso i know it sounds kind of weird but\ni'd say do any one of our meditation\npractices\nlike uh alternate nostril breathing or\nanything like that and then i want you\nto go and look in a mirror\nand then you're gonna say to yourself\nthat's not me which is great then i want\nyou to go and sit and close your eyes\nand then ask yourself\nwhat about that person is not you\nand if that isn't you then who are you\nand try to figure out like if this\nbecause i agree actually\nwhat you see in the mirror is not you\nthen\nwho are you\nbe careful about doing this when you're\nin a dark place though okay the reason i\nsay like doing alternate nostrils do\nsomething else first because if you're\nin a dark place\nwhat you'll notice you can even do this\nbut what you'll notice is that all of\nthe things that are not you or all of\nthe things that you loathe about\nyourself i wish i was this i should be\nthis you don't want to like give in to\nthat so in a calm way\njust look in the mirror and try to see\nlike is this me\nand if not then what am i\ni like that\nseems easy enough you know\nso if you fall asleep during formal\npractice it seems like you're a\ncontemplative guy so i'd say that you\nmay be someone who benefits from a\nnon-formal meditation practice\ni definitely recommend one for you down\nthe road but for now like put some\nstructure around your thoughts\nand every day like you look in a mirror\nevery day\nyeah so then i'd ask yourself what am i\ntoday\nand is this person me\nyou know and that can be your meditation\nfor now\nare you giving us a link to your blog by\nthe way\noh muted\ngg\nokay\nwe're sol can't hear you\nhello\nyeah there we go\nis it is it back to normal\nit sounds different but\nit's like echoing but don't worry about\nit i mean we're basically just get send\nyour link\nall right all right\ni just posted it do i just post it in\nchat\noh is are you dom windu\ni am dong windu it may be that you can't\npost a link because mine is so showing\nis edited\nokay\nokay so this is what you message dm it\nto me i may be able to post it\num\nit's my old high school blog so\nyou know if you want people to read it\nyeah please go ahead and read it okay\num\nyeah so dom thanks a lot for coming on\nman\noh no thanks for having me you guys\nreally\nyou know put a smile on my face and\nthat's that goes a long ways for a lot\nof people\nso i'm gonna leave one last thing for\nyou okay this could be hard\nbut i want you to recognize that at some\npoint somewhere around down the line\nsomeone here may be listening to you and\nbe like wow dom seems a lot like me\nor maybe they'll think he isn't because\nhe's he's more chat he's chad touched\nand i'm not\nbut\ndom i'm gonna put some awkward\nresponsibility on you which may be a\nlittle bit unfair but i think you need\nto learn how to\nbe the person that you really want to be\nif that involves playing bass then learn\nhow to play bass\nand then come back and tell us\nwhat you've learned or how you've grown\ni know it's it's a lot of responsibility\nbut i i want people to understand that\nlike if they connect with you like you\nnow have a responsibility to each and\nevery person who's watching\nto see if like you can do it\nand maybe this is a mistake maybe i'm\nburdening you too much but like there\nare people out there who are going to\nthink that it can't be done\nand you need to prove them wrong\ni could do that\nyou know what\neveryone you know\nit's crazy to me to think that\nsomeone else is invested you know\nsomeone i've never met\nis now invested in me\nand\nalways\nyou look up to heroes and media who\ndo what you're asking me to do\nand\ni think i'm willing to commit to that\ni'm willing to commit to\nnot only improving myself for myself\nbut for someone else\nthat that seems pretty chat like for me\nyou know to me\ngood\nreally figuring it out i can i'll accept\nthat okay cool\nthank you very much because i can't do\nit alone bro\ni'm here for you man\nawesome i'll do it for dr k\nleader do
