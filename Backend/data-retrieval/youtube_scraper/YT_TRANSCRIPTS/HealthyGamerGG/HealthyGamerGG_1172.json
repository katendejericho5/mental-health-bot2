    "transcript": "hold the thought pay attention so this\nis what i want y'all to do chat there's\ntwo meditations here one we're going to\nteach you guys in a little bit so first\nmeditation is pay attention to yourself\nand notice what happens when you have a\ngoal and you're looking for motivation\nnotice the thought\nthat would get you to go and then notice\nwhat happens to it\ndon't even try to hold it at first just\nnotice what happens to it right because\nif you try to hold it then what's gonna\nhappen oh like\ni need to go to the gym and then you're\nlike oh my god\noh my god i'm trying so hard to hold it\ni'm trying so hard to hold it i'm trying\nso hard to hold it\ni'm trying so hard to hold it i'm trying\nit's not actually thinking about the gym\nor i need to go to the gym oh my god i'm\nso dumb i can't hold it\ni can't hold it i can't hold it i'm so\nbad at this i'm so lazy\ni'm so undisciplined not even holding\nthe thought\nweird pay attention\nso understand first chat open up that\nuser manual\nlook at the faq of your mind and learn\nabout yourself\nsecond thing tarataka we're going to\nteach you guys\na yantra okay so tarataka\nis fixed point gazing so what i'm going\nto teach you guys to do what we're going\nto do is\nopen our we're going to like stare at\nsomething\nand we're going to like look at it\nwithout blinking okay so what i want you\nall to do\nis i'm going to show you a picture and\ni'm going to instruct you\nto look at the middle of the picture\nwithout blinking\nnow you can do a half-litted gaze if it\nstarts to get too painful you can close\nyour eyes\nbut try to hold your gaze as long as you\ncan your eyes will start to tear up a\nlittle bit which is totally fine that's\nactually like a good thing it's going to\nlubricate your eyes if they start to dry\nout\nwe're going to keep our eyes open for\nabout 30 to 90 probably 60 to 90 seconds\nif you need to close them before that\nthat's totally fine\nwe're gonna stare at one point and then\ni'm gonna instruct your mind what to do\nokay so i'm gonna tell y'all to\nconcentrate\nat one thing so your eyes are gonna be\npointing to one thing like this\nbut i'm gonna tell your attention to\nmove around the periphery\nso i want you guys to stare at my nose\nbut pay attention to the corner of my\nchair and you can sort of see it in your\nperipheral vision does that make sense\nyou can move your attention away from\nwhere your eyes are focused\ni want everyone to sit up straight okay\nso this is uh the sri antra that's on\nwikipedia okay\nanyone's looking for a source so what\nwe're gonna do i want y'all to\nstart by closing your eyes just close\nyour eyes first\nsit up straight we're going to take a\ndeep breath in and out\ngood we're just going to calm down for a\nsecond we're going to take a couple\nbreaths\nand now i'm gonna ask you to slowly open\nyour eyes\nand stare at the red dot right in the\ncenter\nokay we're not gonna blink now\nstare at the red dot focus on it\nlook at it look at it look at it we're\ngoing to just focus on that red dot\nyour mind will be distracted by the\nsensations of not blinking\nso that's okay just keep looking at the\ndot\ntry to return your attention to it\nsquint if you need to i haven't done\nthis in a while i'm out of practice\n[Music]\nokay just look at the dot gently gently\nnow gently\nrelax so notice that as\nyou let the tension out it becomes\neasier to look\ndeep breath in and out\nfocus on your breathing keep looking\ndon't blink\nokay now as you stare at the red dot\ni want you to focus on the yellow\ntriangle around it don't move your eyes\nbut let your\nattention move to the yellow triangle\nand after a breath go to the green\ntriangles around that remember we're not\ngoing to move our eyes but move your\nattention\noutward expand your attention\nand then expand outward to the black\ntriangles\nand then expand outward to the red\ntriangles\ndon't let your eyes move\nexpand outward to the blue triangles\nnice deep breath subtle and then slowly\nmove outward to what you see outside of\nthat the red petals\nand then the yellow petals\ntake a deep breath in close your eyes\nfeel the relief and notice the after\nimage\nlook at the center of the after image\nso focus on the center of the after\nimage with your eyes closed\nand notice the different aspects so you\ncan even move outward from the center\nand put your attention to the after\nimage\nthe triangles the circles\nthen you may even notice it's like hard\nto hold on to the image\nbut you can almost relax a little bit\nand it'll float to the surface\nso what we're going to teach you how to\ndo is let it float forward so\nlook at it concentrate on it but if you\nhold on too tight it may become too hard\nall right now put your hands together in\nfront of you\nrub them together rub rub rub rub rub\nrub rub\nand then cup them over your eyes\ndeep breaths in and out\nnow slowly open your eyes and let your\neyes come down\nlet your hands come down it's okay\nblinking is fine better to blink than\nhurt yourself\nokay chat this is a forbidden jitsu\nis a powerful technique there's so much\nto understand about this technique it\nwill teach you guys so many different\nthings\nso take home points number one do what\nyou can\nif you need to blink you need to blink\nokay practice\npractice practice practice practice\nmakes perfect right so\nadept meditators like can comfortably do\nthis for like 20 minutes 30 minutes\narguably maybe even up to an hour i\ndon't know i've never i don't think i've\never done tractica for like longer than\nhalf an hour\nand the interesting thing is that\nthere's a very cool physiology behind it\ntoo like you're the way that your photo\nreceptors work and stuff like that but\nthe key thing here\nis focus that's all you guys really\nneed to learn from this and there's a\nlot of other benefits too like\npeople who do thrateka really well learn\na real\nlike because we think about focusing is\neffortful\nright i don't know if people like get\nthis but\noptimal flow state is not a state of\nstress\nit's a state of relaxed focus\nso tradica is the best practice to learn\nrelaxed focus\nand it's especially in the second phase\nof tradica after we close our eyes\nbecause if you're too stressed the image\nis like shaky\nand you have to like sort of like step\nback and the image will float to the\nsurface\nbut holding it there if you step back\ntoo much it'll slip away\nso it's like this sweet spot of like\nattention and focus\nright so if you didn't see the image\nthat's okay so\nthe image is going to become more clear\nthe longer you're able to keep your eyes\nopen\nokay and there's a physiologic reason\nfor that and it has to do with the way\nthat your\nyour i think rhodopsin is the pigment\nexhausts\nin your eyes and how it needs to get\nreplenished\nthe shape is called the yantra that is\nsri yantra\nand there's also spiritual elements to\nthis practice as well\nby the way there's a lot about this\nstuff in dr k's guide um for people who\nare like curious\nand and you know more about it\nbut there there's even a spiritual\ncomponent where the object\nthat you concentrate on is\nsupposed to cultivate a particular kind\nof spiritual energy\nnow when i teach meditation i sort of\nhave three kind of perspectives on it\none is psychological one is\nneuroscientific and one is spiritual\nor physiological as well so like\nthis practice i feel really confident in\nlike the psychological effects and the\nneuroscientific effects\ni understand the physiology of what\nhappens in your eyes and like why it\nhappens and stuff like that\nthe spiritual stuff you know i\npersonally place value in but you don't\nneed to\npeople are curious about that we can\nteach you guys about different kinds of\nyantras and\ncultivating you know cosmic energies and\nall that good stuff but\nlet's step set that aside so let's just\nbe a little bit scientific today and\nfocus on\nthe psychological and experience\nexperiential aspect and also like the\nneuroscience of\nhow meditation helps motivation\nso someone's asking why does this help\nmotivation because\nwe just explained that that motivation\nis the ability to\nhold one thing in your mind for an\nextended period of time\nand this is the practice that's\nbasically like push-ups for that\nsomeone's asking if you want to quit\nsomething can you think about not doing\nit\nabso no because\nwait hold on this is a tricky question\nif you want to quit something can you\nthink\nabout not doing it no because then\nyou're thinking about not doing it\nif you want to quit something you can\nnot think about it\nthat'll work and i know it sounds kind\nof weird but think about all of the\nthings that you've quit\nwhy did you quit them because you\nstopped thinking about them\nright so if you like think about like\ngetting into a game right oh there's a\nbunch of hype there are a bunch of\nadvertisements each of those\nadvertisements\nis putting the thought in your head then\nyou see your favorite streamers like\nplaying beta and it's like oh my god\nthen you're thinking about it more and\nmore then you play the game\nyou play it for eight hours and during\nthat eight hours\nyou're thinking about the game and then\nwhen you go to bed at night you're\nthinking about the game and when you\nwake up in the morning you're thinking\nabout the game and then what do you want\nto do you want to play it\nthink about the games that you all used\nto play when you were nine\nwhy don't you play them anymore do you\nthink about them and not play them no\nyou stopped thinking about it\nright why do we stop playing games chad\nbecause we stopped thinking about them\ncan you go too far\nocd absolutely you can go too far that\nis exactly what ocd is i don't know if\nsomeone's joining late but like we\nliterally talked about ocd\nso check out the vod i guess so\nsomeone's asking where can i learn all\nof this ayurveda knowledge like you so\nfirst thing to understand this isn't\nabout ayurveda this has very little to\ndo with ayurveda\nso this is more yoga um and\nit's because people have been asking\nthat question hey dr k where can i learn\nthis stuff that's why we put together\ntogether dr k's guide\nbecause it's not ayurveda like i can't\npoint you all to a single book\nwhat what we teach on stream is a\nsynthesis of knowledge\nit includes all the oh hold on it\nincludes\nall the crap on the bookshelf right\nthere are books on ayurveda their books\non neuroscience their books on\npsychology\ntheir books on yoga their books on\nmeditation their books on buddhism\nwe try to put it all together for you\ni'm done with my part of the guide i was\nhighly motivated for a long period of\ntime even though it was\nobscenely painful and tiring but i'm\ndone\nso now it's in post-production why don't\nyou use the word mindfulness\nthere's like literally a video about\nthat in dr k's guide so here's the\nreason i don't use mindfulness\nbecause mindfulness is not meditation\nso what happened is\nscientists who had had personal\nexperiences with meditation\ntried to figure out\nlike they're all these different types\nof meditation right there's like mantra\nchanting and\nthere's like zen meditation and then\nthere's like dantrix meditation\nand then there's like you know kundalini\nmeditation\nand kriya meditation and so like people\nare sitting there like how do i\nunderstand like how can we study this\nbecause it's so different\nand so what they did is they settled on\nmindfulness what they did is they took\nall of the meditative traditions and\nthey tried their best to reduce it down\nto the most\ncommon component and what they settled\non was mindfulness\nand then we started studying mindfulness\nand the way that i describe it\nis like there's bread there's pasta\nthere's couscous there's rice and then\nthere are carbs\nand so there's value in understanding\ncarbs but\nlike i don't want to feed people carbs\ni want to feed people like rice and\nbread and couscous right like\nthose are the real thing like you can\nreduce something to its most basic\nbuilding blocks\nbut in my experience meditation\nis in a sense better than mindful or\nmindfulness is just one branch of\nmeditation because there are a lot of\ndifferent branches of meditation\nand mindfulness is just one of them it's\nin a specific branch so we teach some\nkinds of mindfulness\nbut sometimes we don't teach mindfulness\nwe teach it on us which are the opposite\nof mindfulness\nso thrataka is not mindfulness\nmindfulness\ntends to be the wit cultivating the\nwitnessing attitude which is observing\nthings\ndharana is different because it's\nfocusing your mind it's not observing\nsomething\nit's forcing it into a place and so when\ni work with patients with trauma i do\nnot teach mindfulness\nbecause when you have trauma and you\nhave psychological defense mechanisms\nthat are\ntrying to keep it varied and you just\nlike\nobserve it and you let it out like those\npeople don't do well\nand so even if you look at the\ntechniques\nthe mindfulness techniques that work for\npeople with trauma they're not really\ntrue mindfulness\nthey're actually grounding techniques\nwhich is different they're focusing\ntechniques they're\nactually the exact opposite of\nmindfulness but we just call it\nmindfulness in the scientific\ncommunity because that no one you know\nnow that science has discovered\nsomething they think they understand it\nwhich is what happens with science\nhow often should we do this meditation i\nwould say at a minimum of every other\nday\nideally every day five to twenty minutes\nsakshibhav\ns a k s h i b a b h a v\nit means witnessing attitude in sanskrit\nit's just once it's the most actually\nbasic state of consciousness\non the path to meditation yeah so people\nare asking how to do this so what i\nwould say is like you know start with 30\nto 60 seconds\nof open-eyed thratika and then close\nyour eyes and do that\nand then you can try again and\neventually what you want to do is try to\nextend the amount that your eyes are\nopen because remember you're going to\nhave the eyes closed for the same amount\nof time\nso like if i can hold my eyes open for\n90 seconds\nand then i keep my eyes closed for like\nanother 90 seconds or two minutes or\nfive minutes\nthat's fine and then over time you want\nto work your way up to 20 minutes of\ntotal practice"
