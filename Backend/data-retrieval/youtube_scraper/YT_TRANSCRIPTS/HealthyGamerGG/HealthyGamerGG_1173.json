    "transcript": "what gives me anxiety is if i go to the\ngym\nthis is the anxious thought because it's\nnot holding the thoughts here comes the\nanxiety the anxiety bumps out\npeople will think i'm out of shape then\nyou're no longer focused on going to the\ngym\nyou're focused on what people think this\nis the anxiety anxiety is a really\npowerful thing to bump motivation out of\nyour mind\nso let's talk a little bit about\nmotivation chat the first thing to\nunderstand is like\nwhen i ask y'all you know how do you get\nmotivated\nor when i ask you like what is\nmotivation what do most people say\nright so what most people will do is\nthey'll like look at someone who\nthey perceive as motivated and they'll\nbe like oh that person is motivated\nand if i ask them like you know what\ndoes that mean to be motivated it means\nand then you'll get some kind of answer\nlike they get up and they do it every\nday you know they they get up they\nthey'll use some kind of like they'll\nsay like okay they get up they do it\nevery day\nthey're dedicated they're disciplined\nthey have dharma\nhave a goal and work towards it right\nlike that's beautiful\nexamples like they have a goal and they\nactually get up and they work towards it\nso it's kind of interesting because if\nyou think about it what that really is\nis like you looking from the\noutside and observing the behavior\nright and you say that oh motivation is\na behavior\nbecause if we're observing from the\noutside and this is sort of how western\nscience works this is actually like a\nreally interesting bias\nthat our entire society has is that when\nwe look for answers to questions we look\nfrom the outside and look in\nso this is like in medicine you know\nwe'll do an x-ray to figure out what's\ngoing on in the lungs\nwe'll do a biopsy we'll do a blood test\nwe'll try to get some sort of scientific\nexternal perspective\nthis is exactly what freud did as well\nright so when he was developing his\npsychological theories\nwhat he did is talk to other human\nbeings from the outside\nlisten to their words and make\nimplications\nabout what is going on on the inside so\nwhen we talk about motivation and we\nsort of start to think a little bit\nabout what is motivation\nthe perspective that we take is from the\noutside looking at behavior\nso therein lies like one of the biggest\nproblems and why motivation is a huge\nchallenge and so if i ask people what is\nmotivation i'm going to get 100\nquestions\nbecause it's like 100 people looking at\nthe out from the outside and then when\nyou try to duplicate\na behavior it falls apart and why does\nit fall apart\nis because motivation is nothing about\nyour behavior it has everything to do\nwith about the mind\nso if we really think about what is\nmotivation it's an internal thing\nokay so like if i say like i'm motivated\ni don't like i'm saying things that are\nvery simple but\nmotivation exists within the mind it's\nnot it has nothing to do with behavior\nit sounds crazy\nit may result in behavior but if we look\nat actually what is motivation\nit is purely mental it is like within\nthe mind\nand so this is where i think a lot of\npeople fall short because when\nthey try to figure out how to get\nmotivated\nwhat they end up looking at is like\npeople who are motivated and they try to\nlike see their behaviors and\nduplicate their behaviors and this is\nwhere we get to the just do it kind of\nstuff right\njust study just go to the library\njust go to the gym just take a shower\njust start using deodorant just clean\nyour room\nright because like and this is the\nproblem is like that's all external\nstuff\nit's all like behavioral stuff it's not\nactually motivational stuff\nand since our society is so good at\nlooking from the outside in\nthat's what science basically is we've\nsort of\nmissed understanding what motivation is\nand so then what we end up doing is like\nmimicking\nthe we try to mimic like the outside\nbehavior right so\nthey look you look at someone like oh\nthat dude is motivated they go to the\ngym every day\nso let me go to the gym every day and\nthey just mimic the behavior\nbut this is where like if you just mimic\nthe behavior without the internal\ncomponent you're destined to fail\nand this is something that i see a lot\nin the spiritual community right you'll\nhave someone who's like very spiritually\ndetached\nand and like you know like a a monk or\nsomething like that and like that person\nis relatively like not materialistic\nlike they don't care what they wear\nthey're never wearing jewelry they don't\nwear watches they don't care about what\nthey drive\nand things like that and then someone\nwill look at that person they'll say\nlike\noh if i want to be spiritual i need to\nbe non-material\nand so they'll impose non-materialism on\nthemselves but they're completely\nmissing the point because the spiritual\nperson\nisn't trying to be non-materialistic\nthey're just genuinely detached they\ndon't care if they wear a watch or they\ndon't\nwear watch but you're trying to impose\nnon-materialism from the outside is like\nan example of mimicking a behavior\ninstead of understanding what's inside\nthe mind of the monk and so the more\nthat we try to copy\nwhat motivated people do without\nunderstanding what's on the inside the\nmore destined we are to fail\nwhich is why we have a society of people\nwho's struggling with motivation\ni read an article recently about like\nyoung people in china\nwho are doing something called laying\nflat which means that they're just kind\nof chilling like they're not\nengaging in sort of like the rat race of\nsociety\nand and so it's like they're sort of\nlike embracing laziness\nand they sort of seem kind of\nunmotivated or something like that and\nit's kind of like it's this thing where\nthere's something going on inside that\nperson's mind\nthat is resulting in a particular\nbehavior and the biggest mistake that we\nmake\nis we try to duplicate the behavior\ninstead of understanding what is in the\nmind of a motiva\nmotivated person and so luckily enough\ni've had you know some degree of\npersonal experience in sort of\ndiscovering how to\nbecome motivated and i've also worked\nwith a lot of like very successful\nmotivated people\nright so i've worked with um you know we\ndo consulting for a lot of\nmajor tech companies um i've done a lot\nof like consulting and worked with like\nuh you know mental health startups tech\nstartups out of mit\nand like harvard incubators things like\nthat i've worked with a couple of\nbillionaires\nwho have started successful companies\nand sort of here's what i've discovered\nwhen i\nask them i don't observe from the\noutside what they've done when i\nask them like what does it mean to be\nmotivated what is actually going on\ninside your head then\nlike the answer that i get is like\nreally really interesting okay\nand so if you ask people like and let's\nbefore we get to that answer like\ni'll ask other people like what do you\nthink is in the mind of a motivated\nperson\nand so the common answer that we get is\nactually um\nthat you know so we'll say people will\nsay things like they want it more right\nso if i like ask like let's say i just\nasked a random person on the street\nwhy is one person successful and one\nperson not successful\na common answer that i get is because\npeople want it more\nand and so this just simply isn't true\nso i know it sounds kind of crazy but\nlike\nyou know as an addiction psychiatrist\nlike i work with people who are sober\nhopefully\nand i work with people who are not sober\nand what i can tell you\nwith a lot of confidence is that if you\ntake someone who's one week sober\nversus someone who's not sober at all\nthe person who's\none week sober wants the marijuana or\nalcohol way more than the person who's\nactively using\nthat though how much they want it is\nactually like so\nmuch stronger in acute one week into\nsobriety\nthan like the person who's using it\nevery day so it isn't that some people\nwant it more and we sort of see this\nsometimes within our community as well\nright like if i'm like\nlonely i want companionship\nand friends so much more than someone\nwho like has\nfriends like we see this sometimes like\nin places like the incel community but\nlet's just\ntalk about our community as a whole like\nthere's an epidemic of loneliness and\neveryone wants connection more than\nanything else\nright so wanting it more is not\nmotivation\nthat's the first thing to understand\nokay and then sometimes we'll also get\nthese answers like they're disciplined\nbut then if i ask someone what does it\nmean to be disciplined in\nsomeone's mind what does the mind of a\ndisciplined person look like\nokay and then they'll be like they just\nget up and do it every day\njust there's the just again so when you\nask people like what is the origin of\nmotivation like they'll give you these\nanswers like oh they want it more their\ndiscipline but that's all\nlike one is an external observation of\nbehavior which is not what motivation is\nbecause motivation is within our mind\nwe can see the outcomes of motivation\nright but we don't\nsee the inside of it we can see the\neffect of it but we still don't know\nwhat it is\nand then the problem is if you chase the\neffect\nand you don't understand like the\nequation then you're gonna get stuck\nbecause you can't mimic it because you\ndon't actually know what it is\nso i would argue that motivation is\nactually something that's very simple\nit is the ability to hold a thought\nsteady in your mind for a prolonged\nperiod of time\nthat's all motivation is so i would say\nwith all of my experience\nthe one conclusion i've come to about\nwhat motivation is is literally holding\na thought\nin your mind for an extended period of\ntime okay\nso let's think about like a new year's\nresolution for a second\nwhen someone starts with a new year's\nresolution you ask them on day one\nthey're like i'm going to lose 50 pounds\nthis year and i ask you on a scale of\none to ten how motivated are you and\nthey're like i'm 11 out of 10.\ni want it i'm motivated i'm gonna do it\nit's gonna be good\nand if you actually like you know assess\nthem their motivation is super high\nand then two weeks later like their\nmotivation is still like pretty good\nand then a month and two months go by\nand three months go by like what changes\nin their mind like what\nwhat actually where does the motivation\ngo and what happens is they have a\nthought over here that gets\nbumped by another thought right it's\nlike\noh i need to go to the gym but\ni want to stay in bed and there's almost\nthis like thought\nbumping process that destroys motivation\nand i know it sounds kind of weird but\nlike we can also understand this\nactually there's a great example of this\nwhich is sort of bizarre which is\nprocrastination\nso if we think about procrastination\nprocrastination\nis your mind's ability to try to\nmotivate you\nokay so it's like let's say i'm going\nabout my day like i'm going to chill\ntoday i must do some streaming\nand then procrastination comes in it's\nlike but hey we've got a test\nand then i'm like oh screw that forget\nabout the test\nand then here comes the thought again oh\nwe've got a test\noh no forget about that let's play some\nlegal legends oh we've got a test\nno screw you we don't have a test let me\ndistract myself\nso if you think about literally what\nprocrastination is it is your mind\ntrying to put a particular thought to be\nsteady in your mind\nand so one week away you know you kind\nof get bumped a little bit like here\ncomes the thought we just push it away\nforget you\nwe don't want to think about the test we\nactively try\nto not think about the test that's why\nwe distract ourselves when we\nprocrastinate and there's that voice\nagain here comes the thought here's the\ntest here's the test no no screw you go\naway\nokay fine and then what happens is the\nday before the test\nhere it comes and then we can't push it\naway the ability to push the thought out\nof our head disappears\nand then our mind is dominated by the\nthought of the test\nand then we start studying in last\nminute panic\nright it's kind of fascinating because\nif you look at procrastination\nit's like your mind's ability to try to\nmotivate you and get you to study\nand we actively try to push it away and\nwhat i find from people who are\nyou know very very actively motivated is\nthat they're\nliterally they don't feel like they're\ndisciplined they don't feel like they're\namazing\nthey don't wake up every day with like a\nfire in their belly and like\nit's not like these montages from movies\nit's just they wake up like if you ask\nsomeone who goes to the gym every day\nyou just ask them like what's in your\nhead they're like\ni'm gonna go to the gym gotta go to the\ngym let's go to the gym\nthat's it they just hold that thought\nsteady and it doesn't get\nbumped by anything else so motivation is\nsimply the ability\nto put something in the center of your\nmind\nand keep it there right and if you guys\nlook at\nyour cases of motivation like some of\ny'all may have tried to go like pro in\nan esport or you tried to\nclimb the ladder or something like that\nright or you decided like\nand like what was in your head when you\nwere like grinding\nout whatever thing it's holding that\nthought steady\nand so then y'all may say like okay this\nis kind of interesting like you know but\nis there any science to back this up\nand the answer is like overwhelmingly\nyes okay so let's like take a quick look\nat the science that supports this theory\nthe first is that like let's take a\ndisease like adhd\nso in adhd what someone's mind is is\nlike incredibly flighty and incredibly\nfast\nwhy on earth would we give a stimulant\nmedication\nto someone whose mind is moving way too\nfast\nbecause when you give a stimulant\nmedication literally what it does in the\nmind of someone with adhd\nis it allows them to hold a thought a\nsingle thought\nin their head for a long period of time\nif we look at like adhd and why these\npeople struggle to be motivated\neven though they want it a ton they want\nso\nbad to be a good student they try so\nhard\nbut their mind literally cannot hold one\nthought in their head\nwhen i open my book with adhd and i try\nto put my mind on one place it literally\ndoes not stay there\nand it goes somewhere else and therefore\ni\nfeel like i can't actually like read\nsomething right\nso it's kind of bizarre because it's\nlike there's a really interesting test\nof this hypothesis is that\nwe actually have a medication that\ncauses people's minds to sit in one\nplace\nwe also see this not just in adhd but if\nyou think about caffeine\nand like when you caffeine when you\ndrink caffeine and it allows you to\nfocus\nwhat does that mean allow you to focus\nit means it allows your mind to sit on\none thought\nand then you get done we also see\nholding a thought steady in the mind in\nother unfortunate cases in mental health\nlike in depression\nand suicidality right so when i think\nabout a patient who's highly suicidal\nand i ask them and they're like\nmotivated when i ask them what is going\non in their mind they have\none thought that dominates their mind\nwhich is that i don't want to be alive\nanymore i don't deserve to be alive\nanymore\nit's kind of bizarre but when you think\nabout people like the people that i'll\nactually hospitalize\nit's that their mind is dominated by one\nthought which leads to a high amount of\nmotivation\nright so it's interesting because we\ndon't think about someone who's\ndepressed and suicidal is motivated\nbut if you really want to be scientific\nabout it you know\nmaking a suicide attempt requires a huge\namount\nof like direction and motivation is it\nin the wrong direction\nabsolutely is it a problem absolutely\nshould you go get mental health\ntreatment or an evaluation if that's\nhappening in your mind\nabsolutely and at the same time\nthe mechanism in your mind that leads to\na behavior can be understood\nthrough procrastination through adhd\nthrough addiction and through\ndepression even and so the next question\nthat we would ask ourselves is okay dr k\nlike if this is true\nis there data to support this outside of\nclinical experience and psychiatry and\nstuff like that\nlike on a more basic science level\nis there science to support this idea\nand the absolute\nthe truth is the answer is absolutely\nyes\nand that is because if if there were a\npractice so you could make a hypothesis\nthat\nif there was a practice that you could\ndo\nto keep a thought steady in your mind\nfor a prolonged period of time\nwould that result in an increased amount\nof motivation\nand the answer is yes there have been\nthousands of studies on meditation that\nshow\nexactly that so if we look at meditation\nwhat meditation is is it's the ability\nto like\ntell your mind to do a particular thing\nand have it listen\nright so we'll concentrate on the breath\nwe'll concentrate on a yantra\nwe'll concentrate on a mantra we'll\nconcentrate on you know\nsight or sound or touch and you tell\nyour mind to do something and this is\nwhat's really fascinating\nis is that when you train people to\nmeditate\nwhat happens is their adhd clinically\ngets better\neven without adhd what you find so this\nis why you know i teach\nmeditation at like corporations and\nstuff and what i find is that people's\nlike motivation and focus\nand their output improves when i teach\nthem to meditate\nyou also see this in very rare cases of\nlike people whose motivational circuitry\nis actually like\ncompromise so if you look at the brain\nof some someone who has schizophrenia\nthey actually have a lot of motivational\nproblems which seem to be very\nneuroscientifically grounded\nand the really fascinating thing is that\nwe don't really have any medications\nthat will affect their motivation\ncircuitry we have medications that will\ndo things like reduce hallucinations\nbut we don't have medications that will\nhelp those people get out of bed in the\nmorning\nbut what is really interesting is there\nare studies on schizophrenia and\nmeditation\nthat show that meditation is actually\neffective at reducing what we call\nnegative symptoms which is problems like\nanhedonia and a motivation\nand so it's super fascinating but i\nwould pause it to you all that you know\nthe biggest mistake\nthat people make about motivation is\nthat when you're trying to motivate\nyourself what you're doing is looking\noutside you're making an observation of\nbehavior\ninstead of understanding my like what's\ngoing on in the inside of the mind\nand i want you all to understand that\nyou can never learn about motivation\nfrom like\nlooking at someone's behavior motivation\nif you really want to understand\nmotivation you need to look\ninside the mind because that's what it\ncomes that's what it comes down to right\nwhether i go to the gym or i don't go to\nthe gym the action\nis rooted in what is in my mind and\nfurthermore if you really\nlook very carefully across a lot of\ndifferent situations like\npeople addictions mental health you know\nstudies on meditation what\nthe conclusion that i've come to is\nmotivation is simple motivation is\nsimply the ability to hold a thought in\nyour head for a prolonged period of time\nand what i'll say to you guys is like\nyou know when i wake up and like\ni have a thought it's like i need to\nstream today like\nthat's a thought and the thought is held\nin my head and that's how i end up\nstreaming right because there have been\ntimes today where\nyou may say but but you need to isn't\nthat a need no because there have also\nbeen times in my life where it's like\ni wake up i have a spanish final today i\nneed to go to the spanish final\notherwise i will fail spanish class\nand then it's like okay let me load up\nwar three\nright so the need is separate the\nmotivation it's in in that moment what\ndoes my mind do\nit here's the spanish final here comes\nwarcraft three\nbump oh now we're playing war three for\neight hours\nwhere did the thought of the spanish\nfinal go it didn't go anywhere\nit just disappeared right so i would\npause it to you all that motivation is\nthe ability to hold\na thought steady in your mind for a\nprolonged period of time\nand that like once you understand this\nthing and as you cultivate the ability\nto hold one thought steady in your mind\nfor a prolonged period of time that's\nall it is\nyou can like literally practice that as\nyou practice that\nyou will become more productive you will\nbecome more motivated because that's\nwhat motivation is it's not like some\nspecial\nyou know fire like sure you can say\ndharma and all that kind of stuff but\neven if you talk about dharma and other\nthings what that all results in\nthe common element to need and should\nand duty\nand responsibility and passion and\nwanting and desire\nall of those words through the mechanism\nof holding a thought in your mind\nwhen all of that crap holds a thought in\nyour mind is when you act\nand that's that's it can you be\nmotivated and actively not look forward\nto the work you have to carry out\nabsolutely absolutely\nright because motivation is simply\nholding thought in my mind\nso i can like hold the thought in my\nmind that i have to do something today\nand as long as i don't displace the\nthought i don't have to enjoy it\nbut it'll get done okay so people are\nasking\nholding multiple thoughts you can't hold\nmultiple thoughts in your head\nyou can only hold one thought how can i\npractice\nholding a thought in my mind yeah so\none meditation that i think is really\nreally good for that\nis thrataka or fixed point gazing so\ndharana techniques which are\nfocusing techniques will be good for\nthat so you don't want to do mindfulness\nhere\nalthough mindfulness is effective but in\nmy experience there's some\ntechniques that are more effective which\nis dharma\nand so someone's asking about obsessions\nso\ncould obsession be a part of it\nabsolutely right let's think about that\nfor a second\nso if i'm obsessed with something i'm\nthinking about it all the time so if you\nlook at like ocd\nright what is ocd like i cannot shake\nthe thought so if you guys i don't know\nif you'll\nknow this but in in ocd it's obsessive\ncompulsive disorder so a compulsion is a\nbehavior\nan obsession is a thought so what\nhappens in ocd\nis that people discover that there is a\nthought that is lodged in their head\nthat they can't get out\nand the only way to dislodge it is to\nengage in a compulsion or a behavior\noh my god my my hands are unclean and\nthe only way i can dislodge that thought\nis by washing them 13 times\nand what people sort of figure out what\nocd really is is the compulsions the\nbehaviors\nare solutions to let go of the obsession\nso ocd is actually the best example of\nthis principle\nand if you think about people who are\nlike obsessed with stuff that's all they\nthink about and that's all they're\nmotivated towards\nright like you can see it in video game\naddiction too\ndesires also focus on one thought no\ndesire is something else a desire\nis a want right it's not a focus on one\nthought\nlike i desire a yacht but i'm not\nfocused on it\n24 7. so a desire is born of the\nindriyas or the sense organs\nso if we think about where our wants\ntruly come from they come from our sense\norgans\nright i can't want a yacht until i see\none and i see like people parting on a\nyacht i'm like wow that looks like a lot\nof fun\ni want that if you're walking down the\nstreet and you smell someone like you\nknow frying food\nit's like wow i want that where did that\nwant come from\nit came from a sensory stimulus so how\ndo you navigate\nlife if you have good motivation but no\ndesires that's the best way to navigate\nit\nright so like motivation is about\nholding particular thoughts and and\nhere's the thing\ndesires are the thing that bump the\nthought right if i want to eat healthy\nand then i smell fried chicken that\nbumps\nso if we think about what are the things\nthat bump\nthe thought that i want to be motivated\ntowards desires bump\nso if you as you become free from\ndesires you will actually become more\nmotivated\nokay how do you balance holding a single\nthought in your mind and bouncing\nbetween activities or being vata\ninclined so like\nit's actually quite easy because when\nyou\nare doing one thing that is the thought\nthat you have in your mind\nso here's what i'd say as a vata okay so\nthis morning for example like\ni did some writing i did some stream\nprep i saw a client and now i'm\nstreaming\nand so if we think about like what\nhappened is when i sit with a client\nthat is what my mind is focused on and\nthen when i'm done sitting with a client\nmy mind shifts to something else and\nthat's what i hold and i work on that\nand then like now that i'm streaming\nthis is what my mind is on so i'm like\nthis is the thought that's in my mind\nit's like now it's time to stream\nso you can rotate between things in your\nmind that's okay\nand then you're going to be motivated to\nthe for those for that period of time\nwhat if focusing on the thought of what\ni need to do gives me anxiety\nyeah so that's a good question but\nthat's where focusing\non the thing that you need to do does\nnot give you anxiety\ni know this is gonna sound weird so the\nquestion was what if focusing on the\nthing that i need to do gives me anxiety\nthat is\nincorrect that is not what is giving you\nanxiety\nwhat is giving you anxiety is the\nconsequences of doing it or not doing it\nit's not focusing on the thing it's the\noutcome of the thing that leads to\nanxiety\nso this is the other thing remember it's\nholding a thought steady\nso if the thought that i'm holding is go\nto the gym\nwhat gives me anxiety is if i go to the\ngym\nthis is the anxious thought because it's\nnot holding the thoughts of here comes\nthe anxiety the anxiety bumps out\npeople will think i'm out of shape then\nyou're no longer focused on going to the\ngym\nyou're focused on what people think this\nis the anxiety anxiety is a really\npowerful thing\nto bump motivation out of your mind do\nyou all get that\nit's it's critical to understand this\nbecause it's so damn subtle\nbut it's huge to understand this\nfocusing on the task is not what gives\nyou anxiety in fact\nanxiety is what keeps you from focusing\non the task the nature of anxiety is the\nconsequence\nof doing the task or or not doing the\ntask if i don't go to the gym people\nwill think i'm fat if i go to the gym\npeople will think i'm fat\nthat's not focusing on going to the gym\nit's focusing on people thinking you're\nfat\ndo you all understand that this is\ncritical\ndo you guys get that anxiety is the\nbiggest hammer that knocks crap out of\nyour mind\nthis is crucial to understand it doesn't\nactually keep\nthe thought it keeps the consequences of\nthe thought\nokay what if nothing but the that\nhedonistic dopamine\ncan't think of any goal like for my life\noutside of the next dopamine thing\nalso worrisome since i'm almost 40. so\nthis is another good example of like a\nquestion that\ngets at the general topic but is missing\nthe general point\nso goals have nothing to do with\nmotivation\nokay another weird thing\nright so if you like really talk to\npeople who are highly motivated they're\nusually not motivated towards a goal\nthey can be\nbut like you know people who are\nmotivated tend to focus on the action\nnot the goal so if you think about like\nyou know the best students\nsome of them may really want to like get\na 4.0 gpa and that's what they're\nthinking about but what they're really\nthinking about is like the task\nif we think about things like flow\nstates and optimal productivity and\nmotivation\nit's like devoting yourself to the task\nat hand not the goal\nand so if you're motivated like if your\nmotivations are based on hedonistic\ndopamine like that's absolutely why\nyou're not going to get anywhere right\nbecause let's think about hedonistic\ndopamine for a second so what is the\nrelationship between\nhedonistic dopaminergic stuff and like\nthis model of motivation\nso what that means is that i am highly\nmotivated towards something like oh i\nwanna smoke pot\nand then i smoke the pot and then what\nhappens to the thought it disappears i'm\ngood\nand then another thought comes in oh now\ni wanna eat cheetos\nand then i satisfy that thought in my\nmind\nand then i get a dopamine hit and then\nit's like okay let's play some games\nand then you get that dopamine hit and\nso if you really think about it what\nwhat's happening is you have tiny\namounts of motivation towards individual\ntasks\nwhich is why you call yourself\nunmotivated in life\nbecause there's no central thought that\nyou hold on to\nliterally dopamine hedonistic indulgence\nand dopamine reinforcement\ndoesn't lead to what we call motivation\non the outside because you're not\nactually holding a thought\nin the middle of your mind for a long\nperiod of time dopaministic\nhedonistic like dopamine satisfaction is\nactually like just cycling like\nrandom thoughts and being motivated\ntowards them\nright and that's what it means it's like\nokay now i'm going to eat this thing and\nthen i'm going to do this and then i'm\ngoing to do this and then i'm going to\ndo this\nso this is why i think like this once\nyou understand the principle\nthat all motivation is is holding one\nthought in your mind\na lot of these questions will start to\nmake sense and this is the problem is\nthat everyone has these questions what\nabout dopamine\nwhat about anxiety what about this what\nabout that e equals m c\nsquared once you understand it equals mc\nsquared you can take any number of test\ncases\nrevolving involving this crap and it can\nall be reduced down to the equation\nand the problem with motivation right\nnow is that everyone is looking at all\nof these random things like oh there's\nresearch on dopamine so let me go read\nabout that and\nwhat about dopamine what about anxiety\nwhat about this what about that\nall that crap can be reduced down to\nholding a thought steadily in your head\nthat's it how do i get self-discipline\nto achieve long-term goals\nyou don't this is the problem that kind\nof thinking\nis the problem because that is a\nthinking of\nfrom that comes from looking from the\noutside right you\nlike where do you get the idea that\nthere is a thing called self-discipline\nand where do you get the idea that there\nis a long-term goal\nlike what is that based on it's based on\nobserving\nother people and concluding oh that\nperson has self-discipline because\nthey're able to move towards a long-term\ngoal\nbut if you actually ask that person are\nyou disciplined\nthey will they may say yes and they may\nsay no\ndiscipline is not a thing in your mind\ndiscipline is an emergent property it's\nlike\nflight but it's not a feather it's not a\nwing it's not a bird it's not a muscle\ndiscipline is not something that you can\ncreate it's an emergent property\nfrom other things and so this is the\nproblem is like if you set out\ntrying to create flight you will never\nbe able to create it\nwhat you have to do is create the\ncomponents of flight\nand then flight will emerge a feather is\nnot flight a muscle is not flight a bone\nis not flight\nin that same way discipline is an\nemergent property that you can see from\nthe outside\nbut how you make it and what you observe\nare fundamentally different\ndo you guys get that the question is\nrooted in a false understanding of the\nthing and it's it's simply like you guys\nget this\nthe reason no one finds self-discipline\nis because it's not a real thing\nand everyone's constantly asking\nthemselves how do i get self-discipline\nto achieve long-term goals\nand you're setting yourself up for a\nstandard that when you don't get you\nfeel like you beat yourself up and you\nfeel like a dumb ass\nand it's like impossible to begin with\nwhich is why a thousand people are\nasking the question\nand a thousand people are failing\nand then once you're dealing with that\nnegative emotion of like oh look at all\nthese disciplined people out there and\nlike i suck\nthat makes things even worse because\nthen\nanytime you try to do something guess\nwhat's coming\nlet me go to the gym i suck\ni suck i suck i suck and then you sit\nthere at home and you never go to the\ngym\nit's tough this is the problem is people\ndon't understand\nthe root of what motivation is and once\nyou understand what it is on the inside\nand you start to cultivate it then\nlong-term goals will start to get\nachieved it's like i know this sounds\nkind of weird but do you guys\nthink i have long-term goals i do not\nhave long-term goals\nwould you describe me as motivated if i\naccomplished a lot\nsure do i have long-term goals no\nit's bizarre right like what do i do\nlike i wake up and it's like what do i\nneed to do today\nso when i ask y'all like you know why\nwhy we're doing this why are we doing\nthis instead of talking to someone\nbecause i we ask ourselves the questions\nis like the mission of the organization\nit's like\nwhat do these people need it's not about\nthe law it's not like\ni know this sounds kind of weird but i\nwant you to just think about this for a\nsecond right we don't wake up at healthy\ngamer\nand think to ourselves a decade from now\nwhere do we want gamers to be that is\nnot the question we ask ourselves\nthe question that we ask ourselves is\nwhat do you all need now\nwho the i don't know where you all are\ngoing to be in 10 years\nhow on earth what is it like i don't\nknow but what i know is y'all need\nsomething today\nand so it's like we sit there and we ask\nourselves okay what do gamers need\nall right they don't understand\nmotivation let's do a bit about\nmotivation\nokay people have questions on the\nsubreddit let's answer those questions\nand this is what a present focused\nmindset means\nright it's like focusing on like like\nwhat is your long-term goal to lose 50\npounds like that's not\nthat doesn't get you to go to the gym or\nit can sometimes\nbut what gets you to go to the gym is to\nhold that thought centrally in your mind\nand for some people it doesn't sort of\nmatter what thought as long as it gets\nyou to go to the gym\nif the thought that you're holding\ncentrally is i need to lose 50 pounds\nand you hold it in your mind constantly\nyou'll be motivated\nif the thought is i need to go to the\ngym today you'll be motivated you'll go\nso the goal itself is not as important\nis the mechanism through which the goal\nacts in your mind\ndoes that make sense and this is the\nproblem is everyone is\nout there looking for the right goal\nlike you're thinking if you find the\nmagical formula then it'll sit in your\nmind automatically\nright you're trying to but you just need\nto get it to sit in your mind like\npractice that that's what that is yeah\nthis is a good question so revelation be\nasked what does need to mean\nexactly what does that even mean"
