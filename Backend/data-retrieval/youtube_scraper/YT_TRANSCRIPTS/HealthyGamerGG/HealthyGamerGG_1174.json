    "transcript": "but the interesting thing is when people\nchase confidence what they chase\nif they're looking to be more confident\nwhat they chase is achievement\nright they think oh if i achieve then i\nwill be more confident\nwhich is missing the point because\nthat's actually what it actually does is\nplaces\nyour value in yourself to be conditional\non your success and that actually is the\nopposite of confidence\nyeah so how you been again thank you for\ncoming back\nyeah thanks for having me\nyeah is there something in particular\nyou wanted to talk about\nor today uh\nnot like specific specific um\nyeah nothing like particular mind may be\nlike\nslightly about confidence perhaps but\nother than that like there's no clear\ngeneral direct or\nno clear direction i guess yeah so let's\ni think confidence is a great place to\nstart what do you think\nokay sure yeah yeah so tell me a little\nbit about\nuh confidence and\nyou know what you were what you were\nthinking about when you\num i just feel like i have\nvery low confidence and i um\nand just really not just want to explore\nthat i guess i don't really know\nwhy or like how maybe it was like\nhow i was raised i don't know yeah\nabsolutely dude\nthat's such an awesome topic um because\ni\ni think confidence is like something\nthat we don't really understand right so\nwe like know that some people have\nconfidence\nsome people feel like they don't have\nconfidence but like what is it where\ndoes it come from\nwhy do some people have it why do some\npeople not have it\num how to get it if you don't have it\nthose all sound like really really\nimportant things to explore to me what\ndo you think\nyeah okay so tell me a little bit about\nwhat when you say you may not have very\nhigh confidence what\nlet's start with this how do you know\nwhat do you experience\nthat makes you think that you don't have\nlow confidence\nwell well toast says have some more\nconfidence you [ __ ]\nlike i think that's like one to start\num i feel\nlike basically a lot of my friends will\nsay a lot of great things about me\nwhenever i struggle to i guess\nhave a positive view of myself and i\njust\ni'm very much like huh like i don't\nreally see it the same way that they do\num and\nyeah i don't know that's just like oh\nyeah i\nuh kind of don't really see\nlike much of what i've done as\naccomplishments i see them more as like\nlike things i'm supposed to do or like\nthings that like just\nhappen and stuff like that i see so it\nsounds like\nwhat other people seem to think is like\npraiseworthy\nyou think is like pretty run-of-the-mill\nyeah i think it's very like very\nstandard or very\ni'm like just doing my job or um i got\nreally lucky with like\nmy group of friends and the people that\ni know um\nyeah okay so so what do your friends say\nabout you that they think is great that\nyou think is pretty standard\ncan you give us an example um\n[Music]\nmaybe like if they say that i'm good at\ndoing my job like\ni work at offline tv um and stuff and\nthen they'll be like oh\nlike you're doing great like you do this\nand that but i'm like\noh i i mean i'm just doing what like you\nknow job\nyou like you know you go to work you\nhave like a job description of like\nstuff that you're supposed to do i'm\njust doing like\nor i'm trying my best to do like\neverything that's that i'm supposed to\ndo and then also like\nthere's always things that you could do\nmore of and i\ndon't even necessarily have all the time\nto try to do that\nor necessarily there's always something\nmore you could do in like every\nand everything i guess yeah that's true\nso it sounds like people say you know\ngood\nthings about you that you think are not\nreally\ndeserved or like you don't deserve\npraise for him\nit's like standard yeah and\nwhat do you think would be like\nappropriate for you\nlike you know what would qualify as\nsomething that's like\nokay to be proud of like what would you\nhave to do to feel\nconfident or proud of what you've done\n[Music]\nmaybe if i was like really really good\nat a game\nthen if people ever complimented me in\nthat i would feel like\na little more confident or validated\nor if i would had like\ni don't know a skill like a specific\nskill set or talent or something\nor yeah i don't know\ndon't really know what i'm good at i\nguess yeah\ni know it sounds kind of weird but what\nwhat makes you think that\nhaving your job at ota otv and doing\nwhat you do is not a specific skill or\ntalent\nuh i guess i think of it like if\nsomeone else were to be in my position\nlike could they do the same thing and\npossibly\nyeah like yeah possibly better and i\njust think like\nyeah you know there's so many people out\nthere there's what i do\ni feel like is not very\nlike special i guess or um\nbut my housemates tell me that like\nno like not i guess it's\nthey're more concerned about i think\nlike getting along with everyone and i\ncan get along with everyone\nand stuff but that's like uh\ni mean i feel like if you just hired\nlike a really nice\nreally nice person too who also like\ncould work like that could also be the\nsame thing right\nso how hard do you think it is to get\nalong with everyone\num\ni mean it doesn't seem like the hardest\nthing in the world possibly but maybe\nit's like\ni guess you just have to mesh it's it's\nhard to say i think it's a\nvibe or personality i don't know yeah so\nlike\nhere's so here's the tricky thing we'll\nget to like past and stuff like that but\none observation that i've made is that\npeople tend to\ntake for granted what they're natural at\nso like when you're a natural it feels\nnatural to you it doesn't feel\nspecial right but the whole point of\nlike\nlike you know if i was like a chess\nprodigy let's say and i was just a\nnatural attack\nchest and like people were like hey man\nyou're really amazing at chess\nbut i was like i'm like it's not that\nbig of a d\nit just feels easy like i don't think\nit's that big of a deal\nyeah and does that make sense so i've\njust noticed that people tend to\nundervalue\nwhat feels natural at and actually\nbizarrely therefore\nthe things that they tend to be the best\nat are the things that they devalue the\nmost\nbecause there's a perception that what\npeople\nshould value is correlated with\ndifficulty\nright like the more we value things the\nharder the like the harder something is\nthe more we value it\nand therefore we can kind of create this\nweird situation where like the more\nnatural i am at something\nthe more likely i am to like undervalue\nbecause it feels easy to me\ndoes that make sense yeah so because i i\nwould say that you know getting along\nwith someone is exceedingly\ngetting along with everyone is actually\nlike exceedingly difficult to do\nand then if you look at most problems\nin like content creator groups or even\nfriend circles\nthat like a lot of people a lot of the\nreason a lot of the drama\nlike if you were a drama reducing\ninfluence like you are worth your weight\nin gold\nwhat do you think about that\nyeah i agree with that are you a drama\nreducing influence\ni hope so but i don't know i feel like\nthat's\ndifficult for me to say more for like\neasier for other people to say\ni think they and i think they do say\nthat\nright well they never said that\nspecifically\nyeah but i think yeah but when they say\nyou're good at getting along with people\ni think that they don't know how to i\nthink part of the issue is that\nthey may not be able to articulate what\nthe value they see in you\nis but if i had to bet money just\nyou know having seen a little bit of\nlike what different groups of\nlike he's like why do content creators\nbreak apart\nbecause of drama yeah and like what is\nthe otv\nlike turnover in terms of people coming\non and people leaving\nlike pretty low right yeah\nand and so i mean i i i don't know i\nmean maybe i'm wrong here maybe\nbut i can definitely see i think i think\nyou're it's easy to undervalue like\nwhat you're good at first of all it's\njust an interesting dynamic of the mind\nand if you're if you're kind of like\nsmooth things over and you get along\nwith everyone like that's not easy to do\nand that's actually very valuable to me\num how do you how do you feel about what\ni'm saying\nuh it makes a lot of sense it's like\nwhen\nyou say it it's like okay like that does\nmake sense and that\nmakes it easier for me to like digest\nthat\nlike what i do bring some sort of value\nwhen it's again\nexplained in that way so it's it's like\nyou're uh\nyou know if we think about drama\nas like i'm trying to think about what\nthe right video game analogy is\nyou're like a cleanse for otv right\nthere's like\nlike poison ticks and as people create\ncontent together like\nyou stack up the poison stacks yeah and\nand like you need something like you\nneed a healer\nright and the interesting thing is like\nthe thing about like someone who's\nspecifically it's not even like a healer\nit's like a cleanser\nis when the cleanser does their job\nright like sort of no one really notices\nbut when they do their job wrong\nlike everything just starts like\neveryone's like sitting around at half\nhealth in the raid and everything is\nfalling apart\nyou know you don't even see like because\neven if you look at the end when you\nlook at the you know the heel meters\nyeah the cleanser doesn't have like\nlooks they haven't healed for anything\nand like some other heel meters are like\noh you know i healed for like 20k like\nthe cleanser sitting there like i'm just\nspamming cleanse\nyou don't see it on the heel meter so\nit's sometimes hard to recognize\nbut anyway i suspect that your\nconfidence has more to do\nyou know there's more to it than that\nwhat do you think yeah\nprobably yeah um\nlet me just think for a second yeah so\nhow long have you felt like\nuh i mean do you feel like you don't\nhave confidence or that's just what\nother people tell you um\ni do i do feel like that a lot um i\ndidn't realize it until\nit was more prominent and in my head\nmore when one day i had a call\num and i was like talking to\ni was talking to toast and then he was\njust\ni can't remember i was like kind of he\nwas someone was saying something good\nabout me or he was saying something good\ni can't remember and i was like oh no\nit's like it's not like i was playing it\ndown a lot i guess\nand then he was just like hey like\nthat's my friend you're talking about\nright now\nlike he be like\nlike and i made me think like why am i\nso\nmean to myself in a way and\nyeah that was just where it mostly like\nstemmed from and what when you say\nyou're\nmean to yourself like what kind of\nthoughts do you does your mind produce\nabout you\num i guess just not really thinking too\nhighly of myself\nlike anything that i\nmaybe possibly accomplish or do well i\nattribute to a bunch of other things\nand um\ni guess i just don't really\nsee what i did as like that amazing or\nhard or\nso many layers of it um so what what is\ncan you give me an example of like\nsomething that\nmaybe people thought was praiseworthy or\nan accomplishment and like literally\nwhat your mind\nsaid um\ni guess like one of the things was like\ni\ngot masters in league and i had like a\nbunch of my friends who are\nlike really happy for me\nand i had a bunch of my friends who are\nalso like pro players who are like oh my\ngod like you work so hard and like\nyou're actually\ni like i had to ask them like do you\nthink i'm actually like a\nmasters player and they're like yeah\nlike you're act like you're\ncaitlin is actually like really really\ngood and i but like\ni still couldn't like i\ncouldn't get that validation so like i\ncouldn't feel it myself\nand um or people's\nsay like my friends will come up to me\nlike oh my god yvonne like you're so\npretty but like i never\nfeel like i actually am like i don't\nlike how i\nlook a lot of the time so i don't feel\nlike i'm actually\nwhen people compliment my looks i almost\nlike never believe them\nwhat does your mind tell you about why\nthey're saying that\num i think i don't know there's always\nlike different reasons for it they're\neither\nlike my friends so they're they like\nlove me no matter what\num or they're biased or\nother people who are just really\nsupportive\nlike viewers and stuff just very\nsupportive or just like yeah\nso yeah so just to\ni'm gonna see if i understand so like if\ni were to tell you\nyvonne i think you're quite pretty you\nwould say your mind would say oh that's\ndr k\nhe's gonna say that it has nothing to do\nwith you\nit has everything to do with me right\nthey're just they're just saying that um\ni mean\nit's not like i think that everyone\nis just saying that like they would lie\nto me or\njust say something like you know just to\nmake me feel better but i just\nnever like believe it okay\ni don't know if it's like it's like that\ndoesn't necessarily have like a\ncorrelation but like in my brain i still\nwon't really like\nbelieve it okay i like believe that they\nmean it but i won't believe myself that\ni'm like pretty\nif that makes sense yeah okay that\nthat's thank you so much i think that's\na really important nuance let me see if\ni got it\nso\nit's almost like you're you don't\ndiscount what they're saying like you\nthink that\nthey actually do believe you're pretty\nthey're not\njust saying yeah they could right\nthey're not just saying that because\nthey're your friend\nyou can understand that people outside\nof you may consider you to be pretty or\ngood at league or whatever\nbut you just don't believe that about\nyourself like they're entitled to their\nbeliefs but they're just\nyou know it doesn't affect the way that\nyou feel about yourself\nwhat do you think about your league play\ni think in the beginning i was a lot\nmore unsure but as time goes on\nyou see a lot of players and like the\nsame rank i think like you know what\nmaybe i\nam best or was masters at that time when\ni got it\nbecause i see the other players i'm like\noh man\nwhat is this and then that's what i\nbelieved it was but it was through\nseeing\nother people you know not really through\nmyself\nsure but yeah so i've also\ni think like at some point just trusted\nmy friends as well\nbecause i feel like i kept asking them\nlike no bias like\nserious judge like can you tell me like\nif you think like\nand then they a lot of them will always\nsay yes so that like\nmade me feel better but it took time i\ndidn't\nit wasn't something that i believed i\nactually think like i just recently\nlike what they said i just absorbed it\nand was just like\nokay like i believed it a bit more\nthat sounds so interesting yvonne can\nyou help me understand how one goes\nabout\nabsorbing what other people say\nit might go along with like observing\nmore like seeing like\nother players who are the same and like\njust over time um\nthinking about i guess more\nlike how much i know about the game when\ni'm talking about it with people\nor um playing it and like just\ni guess sometimes when you lean against\nother people you just know see\nlike the skill difference and so i felt\nlike i was\nfreaking a lot more a lot worse than i\nwas because i'm comparing myself to my\nfriends who are\nwho are pro players you know like that's\nmy my\nleague circle is like a lot of them are\npro players so it's like i'm\ni'm never gonna see that or like try to\ngo for that so why am i comparing myself\nto them you know\nso i always felt like i was so bad\nbecause i can't\ndo this like kind of similar things that\nthey do\nnot realistic yeah so that sounds kind\nof weird\ni'm i'm gonna repeat the question that i\nasked and i'm gonna repeat your question\nyou're going to i'm going to share a\ncouple of tidbits from your answer back\nat you\nand then i'm going to ask you one more\nquestion okay so i asked\nwhat allows other people's words to sink\nin\nand the interesting thing is that you\nsaid it's observing more\nand it sounds like and then you started\nto say things that happened\nin your own mind and really don't have\nanything to do with what other people\nare saying\nlike your answer was like when i play a\ngame and i really pay attention and i\nrealize that\nthis scrub is a master's level player oh\nmaybe i really am masters level\nright yeah like if you could be this bad\nand wind up in masters i certainly\ndeserve to be here\nyeah the things that you know i would\nbelieve on my own if it didn't have like\nother people that\nwell but the interesting thing is that\nit sounds like for other people's words\nto sink in it actually has nothing to do\nwith what they say\nit has everything to do with what you\nobserve\npossibly yeah and then like what they\nsay starts to make\nmore i start to agree with or that makes\nmore sense\nexactly right but so that's you agreeing\nwith it\nbut that conclusion you formed by\nyourself\nso the first thing is like there's a\nreally important principle here because\npeople will say things to you and\nwhether you\ndeflect or dodge or whether you accept\nthem\ndoesn't actually have to do with what\nthey say it has to do with like what you\ninternally believe\nso that's kind of interesting so\nis it okay if i ask you about your\nappearance some like\nlike we're talking about league like it\ni i just want to be a little bit careful\nhere because\nyou know i know that especially in our\nsociety today\nespecially streamers female streamers\nget judged a lot on their appearance\num that there's a lot of like value and\nself-worth\nthat society will attribute will be\nplaced on you\nor that you will place on yourself\ndepending about your appearance\nand i just want to kind of make sure\nthat it's okay that i ask you questions\nabout that because talking about you\nknow\nhow you don't suck at league feels safer\nto me\nthen no um i actually am okay with that\ni think it'd also be helpful to other\nlike girls or people out there who just\nstruggle with anything similar as well\nso yeah i don't mind yeah so what do you\nthink about\nuh are you pretty\nuh i can\nfeel pretty at times like when i put on\nmakeup or do whatever but then like i\nlook and i'm like oh\nnot as ideal as how i want to look\nand that's just how i feel like i just\nthink like oh like\nsometimes like my face is too like round\nor\nuh i just don't like a lot of\nit i don't know what it is i just yeah\nhow do you feel about not liking a lot\nof the way that you look\num i feel like it's\na big struggle\nin terms of being in this space because\ni think if i wasn't in this space i\nwould feel\nbetter like i because there's not as\nmuch emphasis i think on\non how you look but being\non in like photos videos everything\nlike you naturally want to look good if\nyou can\nespecially just for me like as as a\nfemale i want to\nlike look good all my friends are\nfreaking beautiful\nand it's just like\ni don't know it just sucks not\nreally feeling like you're pretty as\nwell\nsounds like it sucks yeah\ni mean it also sounds like you may even\nthink you're pretty but\ncompared to your pro-level league\nplayers who are freaking beautiful\nyou know i'm almost noticing a\ncorrelation there that like\nyour standard of comparison on the one\nhand you compare yourself to pro level\nleague players and on the other hand you\ncompare yourself to people who are as\nyou put it freaking beautiful\ni'm sort of noticing a correlation there\nwhat do you think\nyeah i think so\nand so help me understand when you look\nin the mirror what does your mind tell\nyou\nor when you see photos of yourself\num\nit could be anything i guess\nlike to be like completely candid like\ni'll just look at a photo sometimes be\nlike oh like i wish i was taller or\nlike you know sometimes you just look\nshort or then\num or like my face will look like\nreally oh it'll look fine sometimes but\nsome days\nit'll look like more round and i would\njust be like i wish i was more\nconsistent\nlike i wish i could just like take\npictures and not worry about how i look\nafter\nbut that's also a thing that i could\nalso\nwork on if i just like for example\nthey worked out more or like did\nsomething to improve\nlike uh or lost weight and stuff like\nthat like that could also\nhelp so it's something that i could\ncomplain about but i can also\nactively do something about the same\ntime so\nyeah i'm noticing some self-judgment\nthere\nyou're saying in a weird way right\nbecause you're saying like\noh i don't\ni shouldn't complain because i could fix\nthis if i tried harder\nyeah i mean i think\ni don't like complaining if it's\nsomething that i can do about it\nalthough i still do at times but it's\nlike uh you can technically do something\nabout this so\nso you don't deserve to complain if it's\nwithin your control\njust complain less you know don't\ncomplain as well\nyeah about it so let me so we're talking\nabout confidence right\nso let me ask you something if you were\npretty or do you think you'd be more\nconfident\ni'm not sure to be honest because i feel\nlike\neven if i was prettier there's probably\nlike something else\ni'd be like you know i think you're\nright\nin the picky about yeah right so i i\ni would say that you know i know it's\nit's kind of harsh but i think that our\nsociety sort of\ncan objectively rate people's\nattractiveness or people can\nagree you know out of a statistical\nsample and my experience has been that\nyou know oddly enough confidence doesn't\nseem to correlate with attractiveness\nin fact if you look at you know\ninstagram reality\narguably the people who are even like\nobjectively in the top one percent of\nphysical attractiveness\nfeel very very like a big lack of\nconfidence\nand will need to photoshop the [ __ ] out\nof their pictures\nbecause they're not confident in the way\nthat they look\ndoes that what do you think about that\nyeah i totally agree with that i\nreally don't think that even if i was\nlike\neven if all my problems were solved like\nif i thought i was like super pretty rfi\nlike\nwas really good at games that like there\nwouldn't be other aspects\nin life that would make that could make\nme still feel\nnot confident so\noh yeah i would even disagree with that\njust a tiny bit which is that\nyou're assuming that if you were\nobjectively better at league\nor objectively prettier that your mind\nwould feel\nnot confident about other stuff is that\nwhat you're saying\npossibly yeah and what i'm telling you\nhaving worked with a fair number of\nleague pros\nis that even if you're objectively\nbetter you can still lack confidence\nand even if you're objectively prettier\nyou can still lack confidence\nyeah so then that begs the question\nyvonne\nif you were prettier and you still sort\nof like if there are\npeople who are prettier than you are\nthat are still lacking a ton of\nconfidence in their appearance\neven though on paper theoretically they\nshouldn't then where does that\nconfidence come from\ni don't know maybe through other things\nthat they\nare good at because the thing is for me\ni feel like i'm not good at anything\nlike you know i'm like okay like you\nknow yeah so we can play this game as\nlong as we want to\nand i can tell you that you are better\nat me than league\nthat you are prettier than i am and you\ndo a better job at otv than 99 of people\nthat i know\nand it's not gonna matter right because\nearlier we already discovered that until\nyou were ready you're gonna swat away\nwhat people say\nand oddly enough i know it sounds kind\nof weird but like\nif you really observe people what you\nfind is that they can be anywhere they\nwant to\nin terms of objective attractiveness but\nthey their confidence can still\nis almost like independent of that does\nthat make sense\nyeah so let's try to understand that\nlike what do you think\nlet's dig in yeah okay so how long have\nyou\nfelt uh can you i think you had told me\na little bit about like where you grew\nup and how you grew up\nbut can you tell me a little bit about\nthat again can you refresh my memory\nyeah so i grew up back in canada\nin calgary with my parents\nand i was an only child\nthey were kind of strict on me growing\nup because i was the only child and i\nwas a girl\nso my mom very much was very strict\nand tried to like make like\ncheck up on who i was hanging out with\nall the time and stuff like that but\nbasically how i was raised was um they\nalways tried me\nobviously like to do well in school um\nalways tried like in chinese school they\nwould always like\ntry to\nmake it so that i get positive\nreinforcement for getting like first\nsecond or third place it's like a top\nthree in the class\num so every time i got like a top\nsomething i would get like a\nsort of reward of some sort and then\nuh i also they also signed me up for\nlike a bunch of tutoring classes for\nlike\nmath and other things i always had to do\nsomething that was like a couple grades\nabove\nor ahead of what i was actually so like\ngrade three i'd be doing like grade five\nmath books or something\num but it i\nfeel like in a lot of asian or chinese\ncultures\nit's very much like\nuh work hard like you do what you're\nsupposed to do keep your head down and\nlike you just\nlike try to succeed in life somehow\nideally be a doctor\nor a lawyer so um\nyeah there's a lot of that and also they\nalways\nlike kind of talk down on you in front\nof their friends but they praise like\nthe other kids so it's like oh yeah\nso-and-so is doing like so well in\nschool but\nuh like yvonne you look at you you never\ncleaned the house look at this person\nthey're cleaning up after themselves so\nit's like that kind of thing but for\nlike everything\num so i think a lot of it\nprobably did stem from that in terms of\nif you even if you\ndo do well even if you do get like first\nsecond third place whatever it is like\nyou can always either do better or like\ndon't\nget too ahead of yourself type of thing\nhelp me understand don't get too ahead\nof yourself\nlike don't get too overconfident and\nthen just like\nthink you're like i'm i'm great i'm like\ndoing grade five math right and i get to\ngrade five i'm kind of like i'm chilling\nand i don't think not\nlike you know progressing or doing\nanything after that it's kind of like\ndon't get too comfortable like you can\nstill work hard and like try to get\nahead\nyeah i hated it though tell me about\nwhat you hated about it\noh i just hated doing extra work and\nmath and stuff like i was a kid i just\nwanted to like\nyou know play games or like go outside\nor something\nbut instead i had to do all these math\npages\nlike and then but at the time it just\nfelt like something i had to do and i\njust did it it didn't it didn't really\nfeel like i had an option anyway\nno or i want to watch tv can't watch tv\nso yvonne this may sound weird but like\ncan you hm hold on let me think about\nhow to ask this\nso what was it like so i'm actually\ndetecting that you didn't have a choice\nright yeah i mean i was yeah and had to\nlisten to my parents\nyeah and so sort of like your feelings\ndidn't matter\nright and so i know it sounds kind of\nweird but\nlike how much did you hate doing that\nah\ni didn't like hate it because i don't\nrecall in my memory\ndespising it that much i think i did\nenjoy\nlike i mean i had nothing else to do if\nthey didn't let me\ngo watch tv or do other things it's like\nwell\nlike i guess i have time to do this you\nknow\nyeah i don't talk can i toss out what\ni'm sort of feeling and then you let me\nknow but this is like definitely leading\nokay so this could be wrong\nso i'm hearing that you actually hated\nit a lot\nbut that you felt like you didn't have a\nchoice so there's no point in hating it\nso you kind of turn down the volume on\nthe hate that you felt\nyeah i think so i am very good at like\nminimizing things or yeah\nlike your accomplishments\ni think i probably and now that you're\nsaying\ni do minimize in everything in life\nwhich is yeah which i think is what do\nyou think\nwhat other aspects do you minimize in\nliterally everything i\ni mean event things that happened to me\nthings that um how i'm feeling\nuh or\n[Music]\nand when you minimize your feelings what\ndo you\ntell yourself to justify that\nminimization\ni'm not really sure i think it's\ndifferent for everything\nokay um certain things it's like want to\nmaintain relationships so we'll minimize\nthat\nanother thing might be like\nthis is just what i have to do for like\nwork you know it's like current pain for\nfuture gain\nso it's like yeah i gotta just work hard\ndo this\num try to get ahead um\nuh well i don't know if i should think\nof trying to get ahead any\nmore i know that's what my parents\nwanted me to do but actually like\nthat thought itself never crosses my\nmind almost\ni never do work to get ahead i do work\nbecause i just want to like\nhave a better future but maybe that's\nthe same thing yeah i was going to say\ncurrent pain for future gains sounds to\nme like trying to get ahead oh\ni guess i don't see it it never like\nregistered the same way because i don't\nthink of like trying to get ahead of\nothers i just think of just trying to\nhave a comfortable life later\nyeah but it's like one is almost i guess\nthey're the same thing but it just\none feels like you're trying to like get\nahead of other people\nyeah but i'm not trying to get ahead of\nother people i just want to like\nmake sure like i'm okay and like my the\npeople i care about will be okay and\nthen\nyeah i'm not hearing that there's like a\nrace against others but i\nam hearing a lot about delayed\ngratification\nsacrificing the present for the future\nand how you feel in the moment isn't\nactually that important\nbecause getting ahead not of other\npeople but\nin your like and i think it's\ninteresting because that's probably part\nof the reason why you're\nyou know a drama cleanser does that make\nsense\nyeah like help me understand\ni'm seeing some connections there i'm\ncurious do you see any connections\nbetween\nminimizing your own feelings and like\nbeing a soothing\npresence for other people\nuh yeah there could be a connection help\nme understand that\num i mean i ultimately just want\neveryone to get along and for things to\njust be okay because i think when that\nhappens like we're just\nuh i don't know how to describe but i\njust\nthink everything's just better i mean\nyeah i mean that's just ideal right like\nwe ideally we just want everything\nand everyone to get along yeah and i\nwould even i would venture\nso let me know if you think this is\nrelated but that sometimes like you're\nwilling to set your own feelings aside\nor minimize your own feelings\nfor the sake of harmony of the group\nuh yeah that's that's happened but not\nin like a bad way it's like\nalways in a positive way everyone\nsacrifices somehow\nto like for\nthe happiness of the group\nyeah i i think i didn't i didn't want to\nimply that it was\nbad or that the group is like predatory\non you and they're like oh my god\nthey're all\nyou know pooping all over you all the\ntime but i i do think that when it comes\nto successful relationships\nyou know a certain amount of\nminimization of your own feelings is\nlike\ngenerally speaking there's a healthy\namount of that\nand as long as everyone's doing it to\nthe same amount it doesn't become toxic\nyeah and even sometimes it doesn't have\nto be to the same amount it's like you\nknow 70 30 is usually like\nwhat you can get away with and still\nmaintain a healthy relationship\nwhat do you think yeah i mean it's just\nhow like\nfriends you know just like how it works\nlike\neveryone no one is perfect but it's like\nhow you\nwork together and how you like how much\nyou love each other and everything that\nlike makes it all\nlike work out yeah so\ni'm gonna just switch gears on you for a\nsecond if that's okay and go back to\nsomething you said earlier\nwhat did it feel like getting first\nsecond or third\nuh it was nice it made me feel\nlike though that i had to like keep\nmaintaining that though so that was\npressure\nand what did it feel like to not get\nfirst second or third\ndisappointing\ncan you help me understand more about\nwhat\nwould happen if you didn't get first\nsecond or third\num i don't think\nanything would have happened but it was\njust like\ni was just getting it like somewhere in\nthe top three all the time\nand then it's like if i didn't get it\nthen it's like\nwhat's going on type of thing you know\nand it's not like\ni guess maybe if i was never for a\nsecond or third maybe that pressure\nwould have never been there\nbut uh okay so\ndid you ever relax\nlike mentally um\ncould you ease up on the gas pedal\ni don't think i ever really relax\nexcept for when i first\ngraduated university and i just like\ntold my mom i was taking a month off to\njust take a break\nbefore looking for work and i digen play\nleague for like a month\nand i think that was when i relax but\nprior to that i would say\nno unless i was ever like on vacation or\nsomething i never really like\nrelaxed it was always just school\nto work to like stressing about finding\nwork\nafter university because it was so\ndifficult to\nafter and then to also\nmoving tally and then all this as well\nso what\nlet me just think for a second and\nwhen did you start to have thoughts\nabout your appearance\nand being unsatisfied with the way you\nlooked um\n[Music]\ni mean i never liked how i looked all my\nlife\nor never thought i was one of like\nit sounds oh it sounds very dramatic\nwhen i say it like that\nbut it's i just never like grew up\nthinking like\nwow i look pretty or i'm good like it\njust it was never like a\noh i like woke up very uh i asked my mom\nbefore i was like mom can you honestly\ntell me\nhow you think i like do you think\nbecause i wasn't sure i was a kid\nbasically and i asked her like um\ndo you think i'm like pretty or am i\naverage and my mom was like\ni think you're average i was like oh\nokay i'm average\nand then that was just like a no is and\nthen um\ni also had a bunch of friends\nback then and like maybe i also had like\na long-term\nboyfriend at the time as well and\nso i never got it's not like i got\nvalidation through other people telling\nme i was prettier like through\nother guys like potentially like going\nafter i was in a long-term relationship\nand like he always called me\nugly girl as a joke i know it sounds\nweird\nbut it was like a it was like a\nyeah he just always said that and then\num\nuh i guess\ni don't know i'm trying to think um\ni just never felt like i really got\nor really was pretty i do think i got\ni looked better when i started in this\nspace because i\nstarted caring more about my my\nappearance a bit more\nbut it's not like i think i just like\nwas prettier than before that's just it\nthat's like the one thing that i got\nin comparison to before so i gotta ask\nabout the ugly girl thing\nright i don't even remember that that's\nso long ago\nyeah do you have a sense of like\nwhat was going on there like was that\nlike a term of endearment where he sort\nof meant the opposite is sort of what\ni'm feeling\nyeah i think he like is trying to mean\nthe opposite but he doesn't say it so he\nsaid the other thing\nto make it easier to say all the time\ni'm sorry i lost you there like i think\nhe just called me like ugly girl to like\ntease or\ntry to like be like obviously implied\nthat i'm not but just like\nsaying that yeah because he wouldn't say\nthat if you were really ugly\nyeah that's what i think was intended\nwhen he called me that\nin our during a relationship how did\ngetting called ugly girl make you feel\npretty\nnope but it it was just like\nno it didn't make me feel pretty but it\ndidn't make me feel awful at the same\ntime\nhow did that make you feel\nit felt like it was just like a nickname\nokay\ndid it make you feel loved\nnot necessarily but i didn't feel like\nit was really mean at the time either\nit sounds mean when i say it now but\nyeah it didn't feel mean\nat the time how old were you if you\ndon't want me asking when you were in\nthis relationship\nuh from when i was like 16 to 22.\nokay so oddly enough i think that makes\na lot of sense because i think when\nyou're 16\nyou don't really know how to communicate\nwith yeah\na significant other right yeah it's\nyou just haven't learned yet yeah so\ninstead what you do is you tend to\nsay like insulting things in an\nendearing manner\nbecause actually saying something\nendearing makes you feel like vulnerable\nand exposed and especially if you're a\ndude like you have trouble doing that\nyou want to sound tough and you want to\nkeep things playful\nand you want to keep things i don't know\nit feels safe somehow\nto you know\num\nand are you do you mind if i ask about\nlike\ndating recently mm-hmm\nlike it isn't you it's okay for me to\nask or it's not okay for me to ask\nyeah you can ask okay so are you in a\nrelationship now\nuh now i am yeah and how do you feel\nin that relationship\nuh happy\ndo you feel confident in the way that\nyou look\num not necessarily in the way that i\nlook\ni think i just\ni don't know i don't feel worse though\nokay\ni'm gonna ask you a weird question\nyvonne is it okay\ncan you be confident and not being very\npretty\nyeah i think i've been i've been trying\nmy best to do that\ni'm kind of just like going my way\nthrough being like\nyou know what i don't look the priest\nbut it's okay like just\nyou know you copy it's like that\nthat's how i feel yeah is that actually\nhow you feel though are you okay\nokay not being the prettiest yeah i'm so\ni'm\nlike there are obviously days where i\nwish i was free i don't expect myself to\nbe the priest\nat all i think i'm just like trying my\nbest to like get through\nwith just being okay with myself and\nlike i'm\nthere are days where i'm completely okay\nand obviously there's gonna be days\nwhere you feel\nlower but yeah what's the difference\nbetween those days\num well the difference\ni'm not sure uh\nnot very helpful but uh\ni guess some days i just worry more\nabout my parents those are the days that\ni don't like us\nwhere i'm like i just i yeah so when you\nworry about your appearance what kind of\nthoughts do you have\nlike i'm very thankful that there's\nmasks\nnow so i cover like most of my face okay\nso i know this sounds kind of weird i'm\ngonna ask you sort of a leading question\nbut\ni would guess i'm just going to say it i\nwould guess that on the days that you\ndon't\nfeel confident in your appearance you're\nthinking about what other people think\nbut yeah possibly and on the days where\nyou\nfeel more confident in yourself you're\nnot thinking about what other people\nthink\nyeah or i care less about what other\npeople think i'm like ah\nif it doesn't matter some some days have\na really\nlike effort mentality and other days i'm\nlike uh\nyeah i mean i don't wanna i don't like\nhow i look something yeah\nlet me just think for a second so i i\nfeel yvonne\ni i don't know i mean are you are you\nwanting to have some kind of like deep\nemotional catharsis today like do you\nwant me to help you cry on stream\nis that what we're shooting for oh god\ni've\ni was looking at the difference between\ni actually looked at our last session\na little bit before this i was looking\nlike oh wow i\nlook freaking depressed or sad or\nsomething i don't know it was so\nit looked so different to how i feel now\ncompared to before how\nfeel so much better yeah so i i was just\nat\njust to i'm gonna ask again do you do\nyou want me to help you have\na deep emotional catharsis uh sure\ni'm up for anything i didn't come back\nwasn't expecting anything\nin particular so here's here's the thing\ni i've got like a fork in the road here\nokay i'll let you pick okay\nso we can talk about you know if you\nwant to\nwe can talk about like you know how your\nparents sort of taught you like\nthat your value is not intrinsic right\nso what i'm sort of hearing from you is\nthat\nyou can never rest so i think like\nconfidence comes from like\nthe ability to like be where you are\nright so confidence is not about being\nprettier actually\nin fact it's the opposite it's about\nbeing okay with however pretty you are\nwhether you're on the ugly end of the\nspectrum\nor the freaking beautiful end of the\nspectrum yeah\num and so it's interesting but then then\nthe question of like you know why\nwhere did you\nhow did you learn that it's not okay to\nbe you\nbecause that's what i think confidence\ncomes back to\nyou know and so so this is where it's\nkind of interesting because when you\ntalk a little bit about your upbringing\nand stuff like\nit was never okay to chill right like\nyou had to work harder because what you\nwere\nyou weren't there yet you always needed\nto be better\ngot to be better got to be smarter got\nto do higher level math\nyou know it's never enough like even\nlike basically what i'm hearing is like\nyou were never enough\nyeah and so we can talk about that right\nso we can share stories and stuff and\nyou may have a good cry\nit you know or what we can do is like\nsince you are better i feel like it's\nsort of almost\nit feels a touch predatory to me to like\ngo down that direction and like give\neveryone something fun to watch\nand and on the flip side is like we\ncould actually like\nlearn something about confidence and\nhelp you sort of like\nunderstand how it's built so it's sort\nof like we can be\nentertaining or we can be helpful and it\nsort of depends on\nwhat you're looking for\nhmm um\nyeah uh\ni don't really know i also feel like\nat this point i'm not even sure if it's\nlike a\nnitty-gritty thing that we could get at\nbecause i feel like the confidence thing\nlike you said before it's just something\ni have to probably\nor like something that i just like have\nto believe in i don't know if that's\nnot saying that's what you said sorry\nbut like or something i just have to\nslowly come to a realization of\nin a sense for other things maybe\nyes you don't want to believe in it\nthat might that might be like a thing\nthat that's a terrible\nthat's a terrible idea that's what\nhappens when people\ntell you something that you disagree\nwith is you rely on belief\nright confidence is not about belief in\nfact it's the exact opposite\nit's like knowing that you're good\nright like like you you can try so hard\nto believe what everyone tells you about\nhow pretty you are but like\nif you're confident you don't need to\ntry to believe what other people say\nlike you just know it yourself\ndoes that make sense so i don't want you\nto believe anything i i want you to\nnaturally come to the conclusion\nthat i know it sounds kind of weird but\nthat you may not be the prettiest person\non the planet and there ain't no problem\nwith that\nyeah right i feel like that's just like\na work in progress\ni don't know if that's like is it i\nthink so\nwhat do you think yeah i think\ni think it's manageable like it's not\nlike a huge\nit doesn't feel like it's a big\ncrippling part of my\nmental although it does happen pretty\nfrequently but i can still like\ndo everything yeah and still do what i\nneed to do\nand yvonne are you enough\nuh\nin in what way in all of the ways\nin all the ways i can ask you\nyeah okay go ahead\nmaybe i'm not sure\nare you enough for your boyfriend\nyeah i think so are you enough for otv\nuh\ni think i could be more it's not what i\nasked\noh oh um\ni maybe okay\ndo you feel like you're enough for your\nboyfriend\num yeah but that's only because\nhe's like very this\nto me like what does that mean\num like he's extremely loyal and like\nsees me in like\nvery positive ways that he would like\nonly\nlike he makes me feel like i am like\nthat's just it just like what i want\nwhat he wants\nokay so i know it sounds kind of weird\nyvonne\nthat's a little bit concerning because\nwhat i'm hearing you say is is\nthat if he was less loyal i wouldn't be\nenough\noh oh\nbecause you're doing that thing where i\nask you a question about you\nand you respond with someone else's\nattitude\ni see do you see how you did that\nwhether you're enough doesn't depend on\nyour boyfriend's loyalty\ni feel like it's just different in\nrelationships because\nyou know sometimes you're not enough for\nsome people and sometimes you are first\nit's just like\nso it's like that's that's well\nyeah yeah so so let me just think about\nwhat i was saying earlier and whether\nmaybe i was wrong\nhow do you feel about yourself\nin that relationship um myself in the\nrelationship\ni think i\num i'm not sure how to describe it i\nguess\ni just say that i'm i think i'm like a\npretty understanding or pretty\ndecent girlfriend\nare you a catch\nyes do you really believe that\nyes good help me understand why\nwhat makes you a catch okay well\nuh that i think i am\ndecently like independent i don't really\ni like have my own stuff going on so i'm\nfairly\nbusy and don't need to like have someone\nlike joined at the hip\nall the time no we all can like do our\nown thing which i think is healthy\num and\ni think i'm fairly reasonable when it\ncomes to\nanything general like just talk it out\nor like discuss or anything\num\nlike it's a that's a i don't know so\nyvonne i'm noticing a couple of\ndifferent things okay the one\none thing i'm noticing is that i i i'm\nasking you\nchallenging questions that i think\nyou're giving good answers to\nthat you genuinely believe and\ni'm noticing that you have to work to\nget there\ndoes that make sense i could be wrong so\nlike i like just if i pay attention to\nyour body language and stuff\nit's like when i ask you the question\ni'm almost seeing like a flash of one\nanswer in your mind\nwhich then creates a war with like\nanother part that has gotten stronger\nand then you're like deeply\nuncomfortable for like three seconds and\nthen you come out with a yes i actually\nlike am awesome in this relationship and\ni am a catch\nwhich i do genuinely think you believe\nbut i\nis is it fair to say that you have to\nwork to get there\nyeah i mean it feels a little weird\nbeing like\ni'm a [ __ ] catch you know what it is\nyeah so what\ni have to be like well i think about it\nfor a second at least think about it you\nknow like\noh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so so here's\nthe thing\nyou'll be confident when it no longer\nfeels weird\nyeah i think i think so i think it's\njust like a working\nyeah so so help help me understand what\nis that initial feeling of like why is\nit hard\nat the very beginning to say yes like\nwhat is that\nbecause i absolutely agree that this is\na work in progress and you seem to have\ncome\na long and very healthy way i do\ngenuinely believe that like you see the\nvalue you bring to the relationship\nyou're absolutely a catch\nyou know it he knows it we all know it\nand yet\nthere's that little barrier you have to\nget over to be\nsecure in that does that make sense\nhelp me understand what what's that\nbarrier\ni just don't wanna\nfor one seem super conceited because i\ndon't feel that way\nbut also too is like um\nthere's always room for improvement or\nthere's always just\nsomething you can do better possibly or\nin any aspect not necessarily a\nrelationship but i just don't think that\nyou should be like oh yeah like i'm\nchill and i'm good from here on out type\nof thing because i\nthat's just how i feel because i think\num like you don't really grow as a\nperson\nmaybe since if you just feel like you're\ngood\nso i i'm totally with you like i think\nthat there's and i'm wondering where\nthere's like nuance here\nlike are you okay with where you are\nactually let me rephrase that can i\nrephrase that\nare you um let me think about\ni was something i wanted to modify in\nthat question\nnot is it oh are you okay with where you\nare\nis it okay to come as far as you have\nyes\nare you okay with where you are\nyes\nso when you feel like you're not\nconfident\nwhat do you think the answer to those\nquestions are can you help me understand\nthat\num\n[Music]\nso when i don't feel as confident i\nthink\nlike other people in my position would\nhave done better\ni think\nthat what i do is replaceable\nor that\ni just don't\nsee myself as that great okay\nso those yeah i think i think i\nstumbled upon something let me ask you\nsomething are you re\ncan your boyfriends find someone else\nwho's as good as you are\ni always thought he was like the type of\nperson who could get along with like\nlike so many people he's just that\nlike i mean i think he can meet someone\nelse and also be like\noh you're pretty cool type of thing and\nlike they could\ndo well i don't know if they'd be as\ncompatible\ni think we're very compatible um\nbut i think he could definitely find\nsomeone who's great as well\nyeah that makes a lot of sense i think\nyou know all of us could\nfind some you know where there's not\njust one person unless you know\ndepending on what you believe that love\nyeah but or do you feel replaceable in\nthat relationship\ni think it's different i think because\npeople are so different it's very\nhard to feel like you could be replaced\nin a relationship\nbecause that's a lot more intimate and\nthere's so many more layers to it\num so\nyeah yeah so then let me ask you this\nhow long\nhow how long have you felt replaceable\nlike how long is the feeling of being\nreplaceable been something that you kind\nof lived with\num\nit's not necessarily something that's so\nprevalent like i never think like\nat all the time like wow i'm i'm so\nreplaceable but i think like\nthe work that i do maybe or\ni'm not sure it's that like i feel like\ntasks are very replaceable like\nyou need someone to order something like\nsomeone else could do that\njob sort of thing here here's what i'm\nhere's what i'm kind of detecting so\nfirst of all i feel like you're\nwell on your road to becoming confident\nwhat do you think\nyeah i think um it gets better and it's\nit's not getting worse yep i i see that\nso here's what i'm here's the way i\nwould describe your lack of confidence\nso in your brain there is\nreplaceable.exe\nand on some days your brain is like\nturn on replaceable.exe and it runs like\na script\nand over time what is happening in your\nlife\nis that the number of times that you\nclick replaceable.exe appears to be\ngoing down\nwhat do you think\nyeah i think so and and so it's not that\non a cosmic level you feel like\noh my god i'm so blissful like you're\nstarting to\nsee that you have value and like you\nknow in in real relationships\nbut that there are times where like this\nit's almost like a script that like\nactivates in your mind where your mind\nis telling you like oh you could have\ndone better\nsomeone else could have done it better\nand it seems like your boyfriend doesn't\nreally like trigger\nreplaceable.exe yeah but there are some\ncircumstances or people or situations\nthat trigger replaceable.exe\nright so if we think about confidence\nwhat i'm sort of detecting\nin you and also from your story\nis that like early on like like someone\nwrote the script for replaceable.exe\ndoes that make sense do you have a sense\nof when that\nscript was written or how it got written\ni think so can you help me understand\nthat or explain that to me\num\ni think it's stemmed from\nhow\nit's something a little more complicated\nbut i don't\nknow if you follow like\na bunch of the drama and stuff that's\nhappened in the past\nbut um\ni think at some point i was going to\nleave otv and as i was going through\nlike the job description and everything\neverything that i was listing in the job\ndescription\nfelt very uh like someone else could do\nthis\nand i remember like that was a really\nsad time for me because\nyeah it just felt like\nsomeone else could do it\nbut it was like a position that i valued\na lot\nso i thought we were going down the\nnon-emotional\nroute sorry\nthat i'm talking about maybe my time of\nthe month is coming you know\ni did a little emotional it's sure it\nstarted coming in the last 60 seconds\nit kind of just random yeah we came\nyou're just you're over he's like boom\novulation time here we go yeah\nmaybe so i i want you to pay attention\nto that feeling yvonne\nlike remember how you felt\nright and like what i want you to really\nthink about is like in your mind\nwhether when i ask you are you enough\nfor your boyfriend\nwhether that's the lump that kind of\nrises up\nand then you're actually like no you\ndon't belong here\ni'm you don't belong here but is that\nlike\nthe quality of the feeling that kind of\ncomes to the surface\ndoes that make sense\nis that what it is\ni can try asking you again\nuh like sorry just to\ni guess re-ask the questions to make\nsure i got it right it's like\ndo i belong here type of feeling when i\nask you are you enough for your\nboyfriend remember how we talked about\nyou come to the answer that yeah i'm\nenough i'm great it's awesome\nwe're chilling it's all good but\nin order to get to that you had to do a\nlittle bit of work right you had to like\nmove past something\nis that fair yeah so what i'm curious\nabout is that thing that you\nmoved past does it feel\nlook taste or smell\nlike what you felt when you were going\nover the otv job description\num\n[Music]\ni don't know if this answers it but i\nfeel\nlike now there are fewer people\nwho can do like what's listed in the job\ndescription\num but i think maybe it just takes more\nof like\nthere's just different aspects to it i\nguess like\nthat i do believe that there is\nsomething some value that i bring that's\nmore\nbut that's just also based off my\nfriends and my roommates that constitute\nlike constantly\nreassuring me and validating on it too\nso like as time goes on i like believe\nit more and more\nyeah i think that makes sense so i'm\ngonna ask you once again about the job\ndescription so like\nthat feeling that you had when you were\nlooking at it can you tell me a little\nbit more about\nwhat was happening what was in your head\nor what you were feeling\num\nwell when i was looking over it it just\nfelt sad because it's like\noh like you're leaving\nthis stuff behind for like someone else\nto do and they're all stuff that you\nused to do\nand\ni don't know it's just like that just it\nwas a sad feeling that's all i could\nreally attribute to it there's not\na whole lot other than it was a really\ndifficult time and i was\nit wasn't even about the job description\ni think it was\nmore like leaving the people that i'd\ngrown\nreally attached to and that i value a\nlot because that's also part of the job\num but\nyeah is\ni just remember thinking like i\nwouldn't really have a general direction\nto walk towards anymore\nlike if i at twitchcon or any event\ni always have like a general direction i\nalways walk towards\nlike otv\nand that's like a very i was thinking\nabout that a lot i remember\ncrying to\nan old housemate of mine about that\nabout how like\nthere's no one or like i wouldn't have a\ngeneral direction to walk to anymore\nand then it's fine because he said that\nat the very end when he was moving out\nthat he thinks back to what i said a lot\nbecause now it applies to him\nwow\nwhen you say general direction to walk\ntowards can you help me understand that\nuh it's almost like you go to an event\nyou see like a group of people you're\ncomfortable with and you naturally would\ngravitate and like walk towards them\nto hang out talk it's\nit's just like feeling like you belong\nor that you're involved somewhere\nin the group yeah i think i know what\nyou're talking about\nit's the exact opposite of going to a\nparty and not knowing anyone\nyeah right you're just sitting there\nlike maybe you've got a drink in your\nhand and you're like i don't have anyone\nto talk to do people think i'm weird\ni don't know like should i approach\nthese people sound like they're having\nfun would i be intruding\nit's the relief of all of those feelings\nyeah a lot of comfort and\njust feeling like safe or like\nyeah comfortable\ni'm not really hearing anything about\nconfidence there\ni think it kind of went off a bit um\nbut yeah it's different\ni mean did you feel like they were ready\nto discard you\ni'm not trying to trash them or anything\nlike that i'm just curious i'm just\ntrying to think about\nhow that could relate to someone's\nconfidence and the best that i can come\nup with is like\nif you you know if they were like if\nthey could just you know\nyou could move on and it wouldn't make a\nbig difference to them like they're fine\nlike it's like whatever\num no\nno i think it was like\ni don't feel that way right now\ni think back then obviously i felt like\ni was leaving so sad\nbut they actually made it\nvery like\nthey didn't seem like they really wanted\nme to go\nyvonne do you have any questions for me\n[Music]\nin um of anything anything like yeah i\nfeel like we've covered a lot of\ndifferent\nground and and i was about to sort of\nshare what i've learned from you but\nkind of before we go there\ni was just curious whether you wanted to\ntalk more about something\nor um you know if there were\nany anything that i should have asked\nmore about or you wanted to talk more\nabout\nnot off the top of my head necessarily\nbut can i go to the bathroom quickly\nyeah absolutely\nokay thank you i'm sorry i have a really\nsmall bladder\nit never it never oh\ntesting testing one two three\noh there we go okay it never ceases to\namaze me how um\nhow people apologize for needing to use\nthe restroom\ni think i lagged there for a second chat\nsorry dr k i have a kidney yeah man how\ndare you\nyeah right\ni'm just reading chat i guess i should\nbe responding i i really\num there's so much interesting stuff\nhere\nblatter related stuff um\nyeah it's weird right like in school how\nwe we kind of we talk about\nyou know like using the restroom is like\npunishable it's like a punishment it's\nlike\ni remember when i was in middle school\nlike we would have a certain amount of\ntime to like\ngo to our locker and then presumably pee\nand we had these like gigantic textbooks\nso you really had to map out your day\nbecause like you know peeing a couple\ntimes a day would be a real problem\nbecause every\nclass you have to go back to your locker\nput away like one textbook grab the next\ntextbook it was idiotic\ni'm back welcome back so\nyvonne here's what i was kind of\nthinking is um\nyou know so it seems i understand that\nyou've got\nsometimes you've got like confidence\nissues but it seems to me like um\nyou're working on those and they're\ngrowing i was thinking actually\nsince you're so sometimes when people\nhave confidence issues there's like some\nkind of root\nthing which we can kind of talk a little\nbit about i think we could sort of touch\non that a little bit\nbut what i was actually feeling from\ntoday is is we can sort of almost put\ntogether a lot of what you've shared\nabout your\njourney so far and see if we can\nunderstand a few principles\nabout where confidence comes from so\nthat\nas you continue to walk this journey you\ncan maybe be a little bit more mindful\nor focused about building your\nconfidence\nhow does that sound yeah sounds good\nokay so it may not be i know we had a\nlittle bit of emotion there but it may\nnot be like\noh my god the reason you're not\nconfident at the age of seven like\nyou you know someone like yeah like\nthere's a dog that was walking down the\nstreet\nand it was about to lick your hand but\nit went and it preferred another human\nand then i don't know if my brain can\neven like i don't even know if i\nremember\nlike a freaking story like i could even\npinpoint that yeah\nlike that so so we'll get to that right\nso we'll\nso the first thing is i want you to just\nlook at your mind\nand recognize that sometimes people say\nthings to you\nand your mind like swats them away\nright or it like makes excuses and it's\nlike oh this person is saying this\nbecause he is loyal\nthis person is saying this because they\nare my friends\nthat what they're saying doesn't have as\nmuch merit\nis like the fact that they are the ones\nthat sang it\nand so it's almost like your mind kind\nof like discounts it right\num the second thing is that we do have a\ntendency generally speaking to\nundervalue what we're natural at\nso like you know you may think that this\nis something that anyone can do but like\nreally it's not the case\nlike a lot of people may be able to\ntheoretically do what's in the job\ndescription but to do it like\nas well as you do and as\nyou know because people can do it and\nstill be like complete pains in the ass\nmm-hmm does that make sense like i it's\nhard to describe but like i\nyou know i think it's very easy to\nundervalue like what people are natural\nat\num and then the third thing is i want to\npoint out that you know when you were\ntalking about like\nwhen you feel more confident there seems\nto be a correlation between\nwhen you think about other people and\nwhen you don't think about other people\nso when you compare yourself more the\nconfidence goes down\nwhen you observe like when the focus\nwhen the\ntelescope is pointed towards you\nconfidence will actually increase\nand when the telescope is pointed\ntowards other people it'll actually\ndecrease\nso that can look like comparison or it\ncan look like what will people think\noh my god it's so nice that i have to\nwear a mask because now people don't\nhave to look at my face\nright it's kind of a brutal thought but\nit's like literally what your mind will\nsay\nthe point though is that like confidence\nyou know it's kind of\npeople say stuff oh that confidence\ncomes from within like literally it does\ncome with it from within\nyeah and then people get confused\nbecause but people don't understand like\nthe mechanism of how do i get the\nconfidence within\nand literally it is like the more time\nyour mind spends thinking about other\npeople\nare thinking about what other people\nthink the less time you will be\nconfident\nnow you also said that you exist in a\nspace\nwhere there's a lot of inherent\ncomparison\nright and that's tough so what i see and\nthis is like what we found so we have\nyou know a content creator program at\nhealthy gamer and what we've found\nis that absolutely like the more that we\ncan help content creators\nsee themselves as like individuals as\nopposed to like comparisons like the\nmore that we can help content creators\nnot think about what other people are\ndoing or how this person oh my god this\nperson is completely blowing up\nand even though i'm growing at a steady\nclip i feel bad about myself because i'm\nnot blowing up\nso there's like a lot of comparison that\nwill\nnegatively impact your confidence the\nnext thing to kind of think a little bit\nabout is that i do\nthink there's something about\nyou not being enough or replaceable\nwhich was like definitely like it's just\npart of the asian upbringing\nyou know and and it's funny like you\nkind of said\nyou know like it's like be a doctor or a\nlawyer otherwise\nyou don't deserve to be confident like\nyou were literally taught that\nyou get to chill when you get into\nmedical school and not a day before\ni mean literally my dad told me when i\nwas nine years old\nand my brother was 12. he was like one\nof y'all is gonna be a doctor and one of\ny'all is gonna be a lawyer\nand then i used like that was not like\nhe wasn't kidding\nyeah he was like those are the options\nand also that we both couldn't choose\nthe same thing because he's like\ntogether we will be the uber family\nbecause of y'all will be a doctor and\none of you all will be a lawyer so we\nwill have both\nboxes checked so if someone runs into\nlegal trouble one of the two y'all can\nhandle that and if someone runs into\nmedical trouble one of the two y'all\nwill handle that that is that's crazy\nand so yeah he became a lawyer i became\na doctor oh my god\nthat works that just works you don't\ngive him another option\nit works uh yeah i think it i don't i\nactually don't really think the two were\nrelated\nbut i will say like so when i was in med\nschool people would ask me right because\nwhen you interview for med school\nthey're like why do you want to become a\ndoctor and i would tell them this story\nand then i would say my brother was\nolder so he chose he got to choose first\nand he went to law school so here i am\nand then we'd laugh about it and then i\nwouldn't have to answer the question why\ni was there because i didn't have a good\nreason\nokay that's good that's a good one yeah\num but but i i do think i see this a lot\nwhere people like struggle with\nbeing confident and because like this is\nthe this is the lesson you were taught\nright like you were taught like\nthey're like there's like the best\nthey're the perfect kids\nthey're the great kids and they're the\ngood kids\nand whether you're confident is\ndetermined by which\ngroup you fall into right and so the\ninteresting thing is that let's say for\na second i'm not going to try to be mean\nor anything here but i'm going to say\nsomething that maybe some people will\nfind mean\nlet's say you're not the prettiest\nperson on twitch\nwhich i will agree with like if you were\nto say\ndr k i don't think i'm the prettiest\nperson on twitch i would say yvonne i\nthink you are correct\nyeah and the issue though is that if you\nwere to tell me like\ndr k i wasn't perfect in school i will\nalso agree with you\nif you were not valedictorian you were\nnot perfect that's fine you were\nyou were not the best i will agree with\nyou\ni will not try to convince you otherwise\nthe difference is i will say\nthat's actually okay that you don't have\nto be the prettiest person on twitch\nyou don't have to be perfect and that\nactually if you want to give like the\nmost\nvalue you have in the world and the most\nbenefit you can give to the world\nis not by living up to an external\nstandard but being\nconfident in who you are and there's an\ninteresting point\nhere because it doesn't mean that you\ncan't be better that you shouldn't be\nbetter i don't think you should chill\nthis is the other thing that\nyou know the asian upbringing gives you\nis the idea that unless you're grinding\nyou're chilling it's like\nthere's two groups there's the people\nwho are two years ahead in math\nand they're the deadbeat potheads and\nthere's nothing in the middle\nand if you're not one you're the other\ndoes that make sense\nyeah right that's the way we were raised\nit's like if you're not\nahead you're behind yeah like it's weird\nit's like there's no\nthere's no like being just where you are\nand it's like okay to be where you are\nyeah it's just and and so i think it's\nkind of interesting because like in your\nmind you're gonna have all these\ndifferent like exes it's gonna be like\nyou know when you when you it's going to\nbe your boot order and like your\nyour processes that boot up when you\nload up windows and there's going to be\na lot of that crap in there\nand so when it comes to confidence i\nknow it sounds kind of weird but like\nthere's a part of me that says you know\nthe next time you feel like\nyou're not very pretty instead of trying\nto convince yourself that you should be\nprettier or that these people are\nprettier than you or whatever\ni would encourage you to think a little\nbit about what's wrong with that\nright like i would question the\nstructure that your mind is telling you\nbecause i think when it comes to people\nlike your boyfriend\nwhen it comes to the people who really\ncare about you like you don't need to be\nprettier\nlike what do you think what does your\nmind say when i say that\nyeah i agree i just uh\nit would just be nice to be so\ni'm going to the gym and like all this\nstuff to try to like\nat least feel better about myself which\ni do so going to the gym\nhas actually recently been very nice\nbecause i at least feel like\nno matter what you go to the gym you\nmake progress you never like\nregress so so i think that's that's like\nsuper\nhealthy and i would encourage that\nbecause it's not about living\nbecause the interesting thing there is\nthat it's not about living to a standard\nright it's just saying\nhey like i can that's where confidence\ncomes from it's sort of like looking at\nyour life and saying like\nthis could be better i'm gonna do\nsomething about that\nand so the interesting thing is that the\nconfidence doesn't come from your\nprogress at the gym\nthe confidence actually comes from\nbecause like if you're thinking about\nprogress at the gym i know it sounds\nkind of weird but then you're thinking\nabout other people\noh if i go to the gym three times a week\nthen people will think i'm sexy\nas long as that's the thought process in\nyour mind you actually won't gain\nconfidence\nyeah and that's not it\nfor me at least that's\num i feel better i feel healthier\ni feel like uh\nit's it's just like having the\ndiscipline that makes me feel\ngood that i went is\nlike the battle is really just get\ngetting up and going and leaving your\nhouse so when i already do that i feel\nbetter\nand then also just like you feel\nyourself making progress or getting\nstronger because it's\nvisible and then so like that feels\nreally good\nso who are you thinking about where is\nthe telescope pointed when you go to the\ngym\num not thinking about other people\nabsolutely and that's why it leads to\nconfidence\nand i've i've worked like so the let me\njust think about this for a second\none of the hardest if not the hardest\npatients\ni have ever worked with are people who\nare bodybuilders with body dysmorphic\ndisorder\nso like these are people that like no\nmatter how like it is the\nlike it's hard to describe but is like\nit is the the mental illness that is\nlike the hardest to displace\nlike i can convince psychotic people\nthat they're wrong i can convince\ndepressed people that\nthey should live i can even convince\nfrom time to time manic people that they\nhave not figured out\nyou know the grand unified theory of\nphysics the one person that i have never\nsucceeded in convincing\nis like the bodybuilder with body\ndysmorphic disorder no matter how hard\ni've tried i cannot make a dent\nthat despite being one of the most\nabsurdly chiseled people on the planet\nthat it is enough and it's so weird\nit's like the hardest thing to treat\nlike i feel pretty confident treating\njust about everything else but like\nbody dysmorphia specifically in body\neven women with body dysmorphia i do a\npretty good job\nit's like men with body dysmorphia that\nlike it's impo like\nas long as they're thinking about the\nother person they can be in the best\nshape of their life which is the other\ninteresting thing about confidence is\nthat as long as you're thinking about\nbecoming prettier you're not going to be\nconfident\nright so this is a very common\nmisconception about confidence is that\npeople think that confidence comes from\nachievement or success\nwhat do you think\ni mean it could help i just don't think\nit's like the one\nlike solving factor i guess yeah\nwhich which i and i think it can help\ntoo\nbut the interesting thing is when people\nchase confidence what they chase\nif they're looking to be more confident\nwhat they chase is achievement\nright they think oh if i achieve then i\nwill be more confident\nwhich is missing the point because\nthat's actually what it actually does is\nplaces\nyour value in yourself to be conditional\non your success and that actually is the\nopposite of confidence\nso like your parents basically you know\ni'm not trying to bash your parents here\nmy parents were sort of the same way\nright it's asian parents and they were\nlike or jewish parents or nigerian\nparents it's\nit's not exclusively asian as well yeah\nbut they were basically like\nyou know you we will be proud of you not\nbased on who you are as a person but\nbased on your achievements\nand so that's where like asian people\nlike i've worked with thousands of eight\nnot thousands hundreds of you know asian\nand indian kids\nwho like they are taught like they have\ntroubles with confidence because they\nare taught that your value as a human\nbeing is dependent on your performance\nand so i think like that's where it\nstarted and then i think you have had a\ncouple of these other\nexperiences where you felt like\nreplaceable and then the third thing if\ni wanted to understand your confidence\nwas that i think you live in an\nenvironment that causes you\nyour mind to compare more yeah and that\nthe more you look towards yourself your\nconfidence will grow\nand the last bit that i would say is\njust pay attention to the next time\nyou feel you notice that your mind is\nlike swatting things away\nand then like the more that you look and\nobserve that within yourself because\nwhen we asked you how did you gain\nconfidence you were like oh i started to\nobserve myself\ni started to make my own observations\ninstead of thinking about like i started\nlike watching players and be like\nthese people suck right\nand so the more you make your own\nobservations\nthe better off you're going to be\nbecause if you really think about it\nwhen you swat away someone's compliment\nyou're not making an observation\nit's a conclusion that you're putting\nforth does that make sense do you\nunderstand what i'm saying there\nit's like a reflexive pushing something\naway without actually like objectively\nlooking at it\nyeah like a reflex exactly\nso it's not like it's a reflex it's not\nan observation\nand so the more that you observe the\nmore you go to the gym\nthe more that you look at yourself like\nthe more your confidence will grow\nand i think you're well on your way\nwhat do you think yeah i think so\ni think like just doing small things\nalong the way\ndefinitely helps and it's not like i'm\ninstantly gonna\nbe there but i'm getting there i think\nand just\nlike i'm i'm not trying to be like super\nmega confident\nlike i can accomplish anything but i\njust want to be\nmore than where i am right now and i\nthink that's like achievable\nare you okay with where you are right\nnow um\ni'm fairly okay with it um i would like\nto be\nlike improve overall in general but like\nother than that like\ni can't complain too much\nso yvonne you sound confident to me\ni do yeah\nwell maybe right now\ndo you do you feel confident\nuh i mean not necessarily\nbut uh do you feel a lack of confidence\nit comes in waves like\nyeah so i i feel very like\nnormal right now there's not like a\nfluctuation\nnot like up or down very yeah so i know\nit sounds weird but it's that normality\nwhich i think is actually the essence of\nconfidence\noh you know\nit sounds kind of weird but it's like\nas you go into different places like\nwhen you meet your boyfriend\nand you feel normal like\nthat's what a healthy relationship looks\nlike right like that's how you feel\nlike it's not feeling is if your mind is\nlike oh i should be prettier or\ni'm hot [ __ ] he is so lucky to have me\nlike both of those like one of those is\nego\none of those is a lack of confidence\nyeah\nwhich he may be i mean it sounds seems\nlike he's a lucky dude tbh\nyeah yeah i'll show him this clip\nwhat do you think oh i mean i think i'm\nlucky too\ni mean i'm like just as lucky so as soon\nas i said that you crossed your arms how\nare you feeling did it pop up again\num i don't know because it could just be\nembarrassing\nbecause i complimented you or it could\nbe like which one was it um\nwas it an awesome oh stop it\ni mean i think like i think also like\nit's not just\nme you know i think he's i'm also or i\nthink i'm also very lucky because he's\nalso like why the [ __ ]\nare we thinking about you though i don't\nknow\nwhy can't you just dude he's a lucky\ndude like what\nwhy can't why can't you just bestow upon\nhim the awesomeness that is yvonne\ni because maybe i just see it like both\nit goes both ways you know relationships\nis just like like you compliment each\nother i may not be lucky\nlike i may not be a good girlfriend to\nsomeone else\nright yeah i'm i i'm really confused now\nbecause\nthere's a part of me that's like\nyou know if he's a lucky dude like you\nthink he's a lucky dude\ni know that sounds like a really simple\nquestion but i'm just like i mean\ni don't know what would you have to be\nfor him to be a lucky dude\nwhat would have to be different\nah i'm not sure\ni'm not even maybe if i was like\nbetter in like every aspect a little bit\nbe like oh yeah they're really like you\nknow like no\nwe're not like uh they're just\neach other yeah so it's interesting\nright because i think it's like it's\nweird because it's like\nit's 50 there yeah because there's a\npart of me that's like you know what\nyou're you sound confident i think it's\nthere but there's also some resistance\nlike you can't\nyou feel like you need to be better in\nevery dimension for him to be lucky\ni just never think like damn you're so\nlucky to have me that's like never a\ntype of thought yeah that\nthat that sounds like that that sounds\nyeah it's\njust very much like oh i think we just\nlike get along and complement each other\nwell\nokay so i don't know if that's like a i\ndon't look at like\nmy criteria or like my resume and be\nlike\nthat they're lucky to have me it's\nalways just like a compatibility thing\nor like a okay so like the other it's a\ndifferent thing\nfor me yeah i i hear you so i think what\nwas happening there is that i was trying\nto apply\na particular like system to your\nrelationship which is just not the way\nthat you see your relationship\nyeah so it's not necessarily yeah\nyeah i don't know i don't know that it\nwas actually like a lack of confidence\nthing\nit was just more like a lack of\narrogance thing and just sort of like uh\nthis is how relationship work\nrelationships work i just don't think of\nhim\nit is like i'm you know god's gift to\nthis particular person i don't think i'd\nbe like that for anyone you know it's\njust\nlike do you guys get along like how well\ndo you mesh and i think that's like the\na huge essence as to like whether a\nrelationship works out or not not really\nlike\nis this guy or girl freaking\nattractive af and like all these other\nthings got it so that actually sounds to\nme like if you had said yeah yeah so it\nsounds like you're moving away from an\nobjective standard and just appreciating\nwhat you have\nyeah i i don't feel like a huge emphasis\nwhen it comes to like\nabout above the things that we discuss\nlike in that role in this relationship\nyeah i i get that so i think that was me\ntrying to apply\na particular set of language to that\ndoesn't seem to fit\nso it was just weird though because i i\nthought when i\nyou know i mentioned something that\nseemed like a compliment like it was\nhard for you to take what do you think\noh yeah it's been like that\nwith a lot of things in general every\ntime there's like a compliment i think\nlike\nit's just so hard for me to take\ncompliments i can't and just\nyeah so what are we supposed to do when\nyou receive a compliment\nlike pay attention to your mind think\nabout what you're thinking we're going\nto try again\nokay oh gosh and i want you to pay\nattention to what your mind says\nif you can think out loud\nall right so you ready yes it's gonna be\na tough one\nyou're very pretty\nwhat is your mind doing\nit's like 50 okay so tell me what it's\nsaying\nyou're saying like oh like\ni just i just think in my hand like oh\nthanks and then like that's like\nmy confidence doesn't waver but it\ndoesn't like i don't feel\nthere's not like a huge up or down\nhey does it make you feel uncomfortable\nwhen i say that\nbut that is mainly because i'm\nuncomfortable with compliments or i\ndon't like accept them right away\nyeah yeah so so what's what pushes back\ntell me what pushes back\num i think i just don't\nokay it's weird like i just don't hear\nit very often that someone will say that\noutright to me\nyep yeah so you're on so should we try\nagain\nno not that's not what i meant so let's\nlet's we're gonna we're gonna\nteach you how to okay i mean like\nnobody like looks at me and says\ngo like that that's awesome here we\n[Music]\nmeant go this is we're going\non a really awesome at league\noh am i now\nyeah not anymore\neven if i was i haven't played in a\nwhile so\nyou used to be really awesome at league\nhow's that one\nso where's that thought coming from\nright well it's coming from the bad\ngames that i've had i've seen them all\nyou know when it's you you've seen all\nthe good and yeah\nbut your mind is not going to the good\ngames\nit's automatically going to the bad game\nso we're going to try one more time so\nwhat's what's your\nwhat's your job description at otv\nuh how do i name him\nyeah like what like what's your what's\nyour job like\nwhat's like what's not description title\nuh like a manager okay so you're an\nawesome manager\nthat i feel pretty confident in what\ndoes your mind do there\ni think i'm decent but i could do better\nright so like i want you to notice like\nwhat\nyour mind is doing right like where is\nit getting those thoughts\num i just think it's\nthe truth i think if i had like i could\nthere are always things i could do to do\nbetter in that aspect like there's so\nmuch\num i could learn or that i could put\ntime into\num yeah i could do better but i'm still\nawesome\nwhy can't you be both\ni could be both but\ni just don't feel entirely\nthere yet maybe but i feel like i'm\nputting my heart into it\njust like\nmy capabilities or experience wise may\nnot be there\nif that makes sense like i'm not like uh\nthere's other areas that i'm not as\ninterested in or that i'm not as like\nexperienced in which is just you know\nnatural and\ni think that's okay\nbut i could be better in those areas\nokay well you so you said something that\nwas really interesting to me you put\nyour heart into it\nthat seems really amazing to me\nwhat do you think\nuh well i think that mainly just goes\ninto like caring about the people in it\nso i like i think what makes you an\nawesome manager is that you care so much\nabout the people that you work with\nhow is that\nyeah i can agree with that\nand what are you feeling now emotional\nwhat's the emotion\nwell um seriously i think what's it's\nawesome like i think that's why everyone\naround you appreciates you so much\nbecause there may be people who have\nmore skills there may be people who have\nmore experience\nbut you care so damn much and you give\nit everything you've got\nand they can count on you to do that\nand that's what really sets you apart\nthat's why you're irreplaceable\ni cry every time one i want to hear\nthere we go how do you feel about it\nit feels better i feel better\nhearing that yeah it's weird like but i\ni think that that's something that i can\nfeel you\nown\nwhich is good i think you're on your\nroad to con like\nbecause that's that's a hefty one right\ni was like really like\ni mean that was some high praise right\nthere that's some good [ __ ]\ni mean i can only believe because i feel\nthe emotions very intensely than that\nit's like\nyeah so so i and i think that's that's\nwhere it's like it's it's what you feel\nin here like that's when we say like\nconfidence comes from within that's what\nit is because that was\nthat was clearly i think a better\ncompliment than anything else i've said\nwas the best yeah that was like the best\nthing\nyeah and and so i i don't know where we\nare now but i feel like we've learned\nsomething i just don't know what i did\nbut i think we're getting there and\nhonestly i\nappreciate that so much more than\nsomeone telling me that i'm pretty\ni like that like so much more\ni don't know it's a correlation or\nanything but\nlike i yeah i'm gonna meme with you here\nbut if i went into as much detail about\nwhy i think you're pretty that would be\na tos violation and we all have\nto go home so okay we gotta\nstay with safe professional stuff it yes\nyou know\nyeah any questions you want\num no i\nyeah nothing that comes to mind\num what about you i i mean i\ni think not really i mean i shared what\ni\ni've loved talking to you i think it's\nbeen awesome i think it's been really\ninteresting because\nwhat we see is people who are at the\nbeginning of their confidence journey\nand we see people who are confident i\nthink it's been an\nabsolute pleasure to talk to someone\nwho's like\nhalfway there um i\ni was really really happy to see that\nyou can actually like receive like\nauthentic praise that's well deserved i\nthink it demonstrates to me that\nyou know you have your mind will latch\non to whatever justification in a sense\nthat it has that maybe\nsomeone can do stuff better but that you\ncan genuinely see\nlike what you are worth to otv\nyou can genuinely see what you're worth\nto your boyfriend you can genuinely see\nyou know what you're worth to like the\ntwitch community and\nand other people and that it you don't\nhave to be the smartest person\nyou don't have to have the most\nfollowers you don't have to be the\nprettiest\nyou can just be you and that's like\nawesome um\nand so i i think it's cool to really\nlike talk to you and see\nexactly where those barriers of like\nwhat you can take and what you can't\nright like what feels natural and like\nokay and what doesn't\nand that's the tricky thing is we think\nabout confidence i have confidence if\nit's binary\nbut it's not binary right it's like a\nslow process\nand i think you really did an awesome\njob of illustrating especially when you\ntalk about going to the gym it's not\nabout being prettier because like when\nyou hear yourself talking about it's not\nyou know it's like i'm doing something\nthat i can be proud of and that's where\nconfidence comes from it's all internal\nmm-hmm it's very much like for me\nprogression\nhelps me build like confidence if i\ncould like\nsee it or feel it yeah and i think the\nreally tricky thing is when people lack\nconfidence they swat away the\nprogression\nright because there's there's this voice\nin your head that for some people when\nyou go to the\ngym it says it's not enough you could be\ndoing more\nyou could be doing more you could be\ndoing more and so it's interesting\nbecause we can hear\nactually in specific cases where your\nmind defaults to i\nyou could be doing more and where it's\nlike you know what i'm actually pretty\ngreat\ncould i do more absolutely but i feel\nokay with what i've done i'm genuinely\nlike bringing\nvalue so that's what i really enjoyed\nabout this it's kind of nuanced\nbut yeah\nlast thoughts or questions before we\nwrap up\n[Music]\nnothing but i'm just really glad that\nlike i don't know the two i feel like\nthe two sessions that we had were so\ndifferent obviously but like i feel\nreally happy that we had this session\nlike just like\nvery like one year later and like\nyeah it's been i think it's been a\nlittle over a year\nbut uh you just helped me so much the\nfirst time i really appreciate it you\nlike hit the nail on the head a lot\nof how i felt and\nput a lot of like i guess feelings that\ni had in my head into words\nthat like perfectly described it so\nyeah just wanted to thank you for that\nyeah yvonne i'm debating i'm just gonna\ngo ahead and say this so the first thing\nis that\ni'm incredibly proud of the progress\nyou've made in the last year i think\nit's truly amazing i think\nwhat you have managed to do with\nyourself and the person that we're\ntalking to\nis a testament to like the resilience of\nthe human spirit\num and you know\nthe other thing is that sometimes\nparticular events will happen to people\nthat will shatter their confidence\nyou know and it doesn't necessarily have\nto happen in your upbringing but like\nthere are particular things that can\nhappen to people that can really\nshake the way that they feel about\nthemselves and be confident about\nthemselves\nand it's been really nice to see like\nhow confident and comfortable you are\nit's cool like it gives me hope for\nhumanity\nso thank you for being you\nyeah well you too thanks for helping a\nlot of people as well\nyou're most welcome um\ni guess that's it\n[Laughter]\nwell best of luck to you yvonne you know\nlet us know if you\nneed help on your journey down the road\num\nyou know if you're if you're all the way\nthere at some point and want to share\nwith us that's totally fine or if\nsomething else comes up\nbut i think i think you're crushing it\nso keep crushing it thank you\nyou're welcome take care thank you\noh [ __ ] i forgot meditation yeah i\ncompletely flubbed\ni forgot that i i was i need to ask you\nif you want to meditate today\nokay i've never done it before but i'm\nhappy to try\nokay um let's start with this what do\nyou\nwhat would be the goal of you meditating\nwhat do you want meditation to do for\nyou\nmaybe to de-stress but i feel stressed a\nlot\nokay um and when you get stressed what\nwhat happens to you\ni just\nhey i lay down or something i don't know\nokay so you feel like mentally\noverwhelmed and you become like\ninert like you don't move around\num it depends sometimes i feel stress\nand i work\nso then i feel less stressed because i'm\nproductive and have done stuff\num and then sometimes i just like\nfeel stressed or tired so i lay in bed\nand just like take a break\nfor a bit\nokay um i'm gonna teach you\na meditation practice called bellows\nbreath okay\nokay so it's a particular kind of\nbreathing practice that is going to be\nforceful inhalation followed by forceful\nexhalation\nand we're going to breathe like\nrelatively rapidly and then kind of calm\ndown a little bit afterward\nfor people who have watched this before\ni actually got the names confused so\nthis is different\nfrom actually what i used to teach is\ncalled breath of fire but\nso bellows breath i want you to sit up\nstraight i'm gonna blow my nose\ni think you should too i got teary\ntowards the end\noh yeah and got caught up with how\nawesome you are\noh god\ni'm just going to toss those out\nokay okay so i want you to sit up\nstraight\nsuper straight okay so\nare your knees lower than your hips\nno i'm saying cross-legged so no oh\nokay so that can be good do you have a a\nsmall\nlike pillow or bro blanket that you can\nsit on if you're sitting cross-legged\nbut just i have this yeah so can\nfold it up\noh it's a rope yeah oh i thought it was\na blanket\nwell it's a blanket room okay\ncan you sit on top of that yes\nbut not under your knees you want to put\nit under your\nhips okay\nand then sitting across like this good\nso now you may notice if you sit\ncross-legged are you sitting up\nstraighter\nnow that you're sitting on the robe okay\nso\nthis this technique is actually super\nsimple so what it's going to hopefully\nhelp you do\nis kind of calm you down and energize\nyou at the same time\nso what we're going to do is i'm gonna\nbreathe in\ngot it\nokay so this is um\nyeah so what we're going to do is like\n15 breaths so i'm going to close my eyes\nand i'm going to demonstrate one round\nso\nand you kind of want to do like one\nsecond in one second out so one\ntwo one two okay but you're going to\ncount for like 15 breaths\nso i'll demonstrate\nthen you're gonna be like super chill\nafterward okay\nall right you ready yes i don't know if\ni'm going to do it right though\nyou're of course you're not going to do\nit right it's your first time okay who\ndoes something right the first time\nuh really talented people\nbasically no one all right okay okay so\nclose your eyes sit up straight\nand then begin\nokay were you breathing out pretty hard\nlike in and out hard or could you could\nyou give it more oomph\nit felt hard but i don't know how hard\ni'm supposed to go because i feel like\nif i went harder it wouldn't be very\nit wouldn't feel very nice go harder\ngo harder okay okay we're gonna do 15\nrounds\nokay so i have i was i wasn't sure how\nmany times do i do i get 15\nyeah okay or if you want me to i can\nkeep track and i'll tell you\noh you want me to count with you would\nthat help\nokay okay so close your eyes\nand go hard this time okay okay three\ntwo one go\none two three\nfour five six\nseven eight nine\n10 11 12\n13 14 15.\nnow just sit\nhow do you feel that's really comfy\nhe's really relaxing were you exhaling\nhard too\nit seemed like you were putting\neverything into the inhale i\ni think oh well yes but i feel tired\nyeah so it's like i think i think it\nworked right\nis it supposed to make you tired after\nwell i think if you\ninhale really hard and you don't exhale\nas hard\nit may have a slightly different effect\nokay\nwell i felt like i was chilling yeah you\nwere chilling that's good\nso you can have a chilling so if you\nwant to be if you want to balance the\nenergizing a little bit better\ni would push out practice a little bit\nmore on\non pushing out the exhalation okay\nbecause let me let me think about what\nthis is doing\nyeah you may be becoming slightly hyper\ncarbic\nwhich is the opposite of\nhyperventilation\nif you're not exhaling forcefully enough\nif you're just like sucking in a bunch\nof air like if you're sucking in more\nair\nthen you're exhaling you may actually\nstart to feel a little bit\ntrippy is that when you say\nrelax or we stop talking to like a\nlittle bit woozy trippy\nor more just just relaxed i think just\nrelax\nokay yeah okay you want to try one more\ntime\nwith hard exhalations are you done you\ncan be done\ni might just feel too tired for it i\ndon't know\ni feel like tired now okay so just\nlet's stop then so i i swear i'll do it\nafterwards\nyeah try again because the i mean i\nguess it's this is the how to tire\nyourself out meditation\ni suppose we may we may have stumbled\nupon a new technique which i'll have to\nthink about\nbut it might also be me waking up like\na little bit earlier than you no i mean\ni had some coffee and then\nit's like no i'd say it's possible\nyvonne that you have you have\nunknowingly stumbled upon a wonderful\ntechnique for insomnia\nbecause you have your coffee and you\nfeel tired\nsome coffee crash caffeine\ni don't know so i'll experiment with\nthis i encourage if people are watching\nand and practicing with you i i i wonder\nif you do like\nsharp inhalations with minimal\nexhalation whether you feel\ntired\nif it's useful i'll meditate because\nsometimes people want to calm down and\nthey want to like mentally chill out\nright like they want to like\ncalm that down yeah that's really\nhelpful too so we may have stumbled upon\nsomething i don't think i've ever seen\nthis\nit's interesting because we have the\nopposite where we have forceful\nexhalation with very mild inhalation and\nthat\nis breath of fire and then this one is\nbellows breath\nbut i i don't think that there's a\nthere's an opposite version of this it's\ninteresting so i'm gonna experiment\nthank you yvonne you may have stumbled\nupon something\nokay good job yeah no problem anytime\nall right take care everyone yeah thank\nyou\nbye bye\nall right chat that was unexpected but\nhey\nevan may be super yeah breath of a\nbreath of fire is uh\nthe it's the yvonne method"
