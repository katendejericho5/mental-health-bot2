    "transcript": "they're looking for that one thing no\nmom of course i don't hate you\noh my god mom i'm so sorry please stop\ncrying and then you pat them all\nnarcissism dr k's comments about\nnarcissism\nhave shaken me from the stream today dr\nk talked about narcissistic tendencies\nand i realized that what he has\ndescribed that he is describing me\nperfectly\ni feel as though this piece of\ninformation has completed a puzzle i've\nbeen trying to figure out since i was\n22.\ni'm now 38 so i'm probably one of the\noldest people here and i'll tell you\n15 years of anxiety and depression is no\nfun thing\nmanipulating people expecting special\ntreatment expecting success\nwithout putting the effort in slow\ndegradation of relationships not caring\nabout others etc\nfalse modesty and hoping for adoration\nit feels like a massive rock has been\ndropped on me i realize that my ego and\nexpectations have been the root of\nso many problems in my life i've always\nknown i have low self-esteem and i can\nsee how that\nthat low confidence has led me to this\nbizarre state of mind where you expect\nthe world\nfor no good reason dr k if you're\nreading this please please please do a\nvideo about steps one can take to reduce\nthis trait\nand take steps in the right direction i\nreally need some guidance here any\nadvice from other members would be\ngreatly appreciated too\nso let's start off so before we get to\nadvice\nokay what we're gonna do is talk a\nlittle bit about\nnarcissism in in a kind of a weird way\nso the first thing that i'm going to\ngive you guys kind of a a quick\nbackstory okay\nso i think what this poster was\nreferring to last week on stream we\ntalked a little bit about\nhow narcissism manifests kind of in two\nways\nright so if i have if i'm insecure about\nmyself\none way i can deal with that is to be\narrogant so\nlike i put on this like very like big\nshell\nthat's like grandiose and i'm like hey\neveryone look at me\ni'm so awesome and i need other people's\nadoration\nthe other thing that sometimes happens\nthat can result in like people sort of\nbeing kind of manipulative and hard to\ndeal with but they're not\narrogant is for people to actually have\nlike insecurity on the inside but then\nthey still engage in all of these\nbehaviors to like get other people to\nlike like them but they're not like\narrogant behaviors they're like softer\nbehaviors\nso there are things like excessive\nmodesty um\nyou know like like sort of help seeking\nkind of behavior like\noh woe is me behavior they have these\nemotional needs of insecurity where like\nthey need to\nfeel loved and respected by other people\nand they just engage in like\nnon-arrogant behaviors\nto sort of get that kind of like\nreassurance from the outside\nand this creates a real problem in\nrelationships because like\nsometimes when you're with these kinds\nof people like they're not doing\nanything\nwrong but you still sort of feel\nsubconsciously manipulated\nand when you feel subconsciously\nmanipulated like if you start to blame\nthem in your mind you kind of like feel\nguilty\nso you're kind of in this situation\nwhere like oh man like this this person\nis trapping me but also like making me\nfeel like an [ __ ] for being trapped\nit's kind of really hard to describe but\nlike that's what i would kind of say\nso this is a weird kind of subtle\nnarcissism so today what i want to talk\nto you all about is like kind of the two\ntypes of narcissism okay\nso to start off with let's start with\nkind of looking at\nyoga so what we want to do is we want to\nstart by sort of understanding\nnarcissism and by\nthe way that we're going to understand\nnarcissism is actually through a yogic\nlens all right so in yoga we have\nthree parts of our mind the manus is our\nemotional mind\nthe ahamkara is our ego and the buddhi\nis our intellect there's usually like an\ninterplay here where\nthe the goal of the ahamkar is to be a\nbouncer\nis to protect us from feeling hurt\nso anytime we feel hurt in our emotional\nmind\nthe bouncer steps in and then goes to\nour intellect and like\ntells us to rationalize\nokay so the classic example that i use\nwhen illustrating this is\ni remember when i was in college my\nfriends and i would talk about the\nladies\nand then eventually one of us would like\nmuster up the courage to ask one of the\ngirls out\nand when we asked her out and she said\nno\nthen something weird happened because\nthen we'd start like\ndissing her right like we'd start saying\noh she's not that attractive\nshe's not even that great oh yeah i was\nlike i was like\nyou know she's like i'm i i can do\nbetter than that\nand we sort of do this weird kind of\nlike rationalization to like\nput her down and pump ourselves up and\nso that's actually what's going on there\nis we feel hurt by the rejection\nand then our ego steps in and is like oh\nno\nwe're feeling hurt let's feel better\nand then it goes over to the intellect\nand it's like hey\ncome up with some kind of\nrationalizations about how awesome we\nare\nand let's put her down and let's pump\nourselves up\ni need evidence to support these two\ngoals okay\nso this is kind of a quick primer so\nlet's take a look at narcissism\nso in narcissism what we're talking\nabout is\nlow internal self-worth so people with\nnarcissism\nactually like the reason they're\narrogant is because they actually have\nlow internal self-worth\nand so this is where what we usually see\nright when we think about narcissism is\nlike people who are narcissistic have to\nlike\nadvertise how good they are so since you\nhave low\nuh internal self-worth what we have to\ndo is we rely\non external\nsigns of worth so if i don't feel\nconfident in myself\nwhat i end up doing is like i'll go to\nlike other people\nand i'll like i i need them to\nexplain to me that i'm really really\nawesome right so when we think about the\ntraditional narcissists we're thinking\nabout\nsort of traditional narcissism okay so\nlike if we look at the\nuh features of traditional narcissism\nwe're talking about stuff like arrogance\nokay we're talking about like showing\noff\nwe're talking about being grandiose\nright so like\nif i don't believe that like i'm a good\nperson on the inside\nwhat i have to do is like advertise how\nawesome i am\nif i don't think that i'm like a great\nperson like and i don't have an\nintrinsic sense of self-worth\ni need to wear really expensive clothes\ni need to drive a really nice car\nbecause then i can\nshow the world how much i'm worth i need\na really big title\nat work i need to have a lot of money\nnot only do i need to have a lot of\nmoney i need to show people that i have\na lot of money\nand sometimes we even end up with a 30\n000\nmillionaire which is someone who makes\n30 grand a year\nbut lives like a millionaire they rack\nup the credit card debt they like drive\nnice cars they're like living the high\nlife\nand you know they're gonna make all\ntheir money down the road like they know\nthat they're gonna be like\nthey're gonna hit it because they're so\nawesome right so we have sort of this\ntraditional narcissism\nwhich we can also kind of think of as\nthick-skinned so these people sort of\nseem thick-skinned because if you insult\nthem you know they're not going to start\ncrying\nthey're very overt right they show off\nthey're very also oblivious this is what\nwe think of in terms of narcissism\nthey're so clueless the world revolves\naround them\nthey don't think about anyone else\nrelating to this is exhibitionistic\nshowing off right they're grandiose\nand if you also think about traditional\nnarcissists they\nthey devalue other people so when it\ncomes to dealing with other people\nthey'll\nkind of devalue them okay what these\npeople do is they have to elicit\nreassurance\nokay so we're gonna end up eliciting\nreassurance because that's what you need\nright you guys remember this\nwe have to rely on external stuff so i\nhave to like post stuff on social media\nand then everyone's going to tell me how\nawesome i am i'm going to tell everyone\ni got promoted i'm gonna wear these nice\nclothes\nand then when you get those compliments\nwhen people give you likes and stuff\nlike that\nthat in turn enhances your self-worth\nbut only for a time because it's\nexternal right\nso what these people end up with is sort\nof like this fragile sense of self-worth\nbecause if people don't compliment your\nclothes\nand someone else in the room is like by\nthe way you got promoted oh i just like\nstarted my own company\nso it's a very like fragile sense of\nself-worth that like\ncan fluctuate very wildly which is what\nleads to kind of this like\nbad behavior okay so this results in bad\nbehavior\nthis is why they become arrogant and\nthey devalue other people\nso if someone if i got a promotion and\nthen someone else is like oh i just\nstarted my own company\nthen i'm gonna have to devalue that\nperson to poop on them to make myself\nfeel better\nbecause they're exposing my inferiority\nand remember the ahm guard doesn't want\nthat it's the bouncer of the mind\nso it's like oh no this person is making\nme feel bad\nso let's not do that so this is what\npeople think of as narcissism make sense\nchat\nso now the interesting thing is that if\nwe look at the pieces\nokay if we look at these pieces over\nhere and we look at these pieces over\nhere\nand we look at eliciting reassurance\nand we look at enhancing self-worth\nand we look at bad behavior there's\nactually another\nset of features which hits all of these\nsame things okay\nand this is what this poster is talking\nabout so let's go back to the top\nso let's talk about non-traditional\nnarcissism\nlet's take a look at our list chat and\nlet's see if we can figure this out\nokay so thick skinned\nwhat do you guys think these people are\nlike thin\nskin overt\noblivious hyper vigilant exhibitionistic\nin the closet or closeted okay\ngrandiose vulnerable and instead of\ndevaluing\nthey idealize okay\nso this is the the profile of a\nnon-traditional narcissist so let's run\nthrough this real quick okay\nso like when people insult you instead\nof fighting back\nyou feel really hurt but still on the\ninside the reason that you have to fight\nback\nlike if if i get insulted by someone and\ni don't feel confident let's say about\nmy intelligence\nright what i have to do is i have to\nargue with them i have to prove them\nwrong\nbecause secretly on the inside i believe\nthat i'm i may not be very smart\nso that's the traditional narcissist the\nbelief is still the same in the\nnon-traditional\nnarcissists they still feel insecure but\ninstead what they do is they feel hurt\nthey avoid right they withdraw\nso we'll get to these in a second but\nwe'll get to like avoidance behaviors\nand then they're also so the the the\ntraditional narcissist is over\nwhile the non-traditional narcissist is\ncovert\nso both of them once again are insecure\nso how does the traditional narcissist\ndeal with it they deal with it by like\nadvertising how awesome they are whereas\nthe\nthe non-traditional narcissist hides\nright i don't want people to see me i\ndon't want people to hear me i don't\nlike\noh my god like everyone is like going to\nrealize how\nbad i am and we'll get to that in a\nsecond so then we get to oblivious\nversus hyper vigilant right so the\ntraditional narcissist\nis like doesn't think about or doesn't\nappear to be aware of\nhow other people think or feel whereas\nthe non-traditional narcissist is hyper\nvigilant\nthey're always paying attention to how\nother people are reacting and how they\nfeel\nthe traditional narcissist is\nexhibitionistic kind of\nrelated to covert so like the\nnon-traditional narcissist keeps\neverything on the inside\nand will occasionally show people things\nso instead of being grandiose they'll be\nvulnerable and this is a big one chat\nso the traditional narcissist places\neveryone else below them right so i am\nhere\nand i need to put other people down here\nthis balances things out whereas the\nnon-traditional\nnarcissist puts everyone up here they\nidealize instead\noh look at how crappy i am everyone in\nthe world is better than i am\nso then this leads to manipulative\nbehaviors via eliciting reassurance\nwhat are the behaviors that the\nnon-traditional narcissists engage in\nlet's look at this\nright so they avoid and they hide but\nthey also\nemotionally manipulate because you feel\ninsecure about yourself so you'll do\nthings like seek reassurance\nyou know you'll do these like little\nlike things that sometimes are quite\nfrustrating to people they're like oh\nare you busy\noh you're busy today oh that's okay\ni i i know you have a real life worth\nliving it's okay don't worry about it\ni'm gonna hang up now\nyou go enjoy your life and then the\nother person on on the phone is like\nwait what\nwhat what what what's happening like\nwait\nwhat and so what they end up doing is\nthey have this\nhunger that comes from their low\nself-esteem\nso what they'll end up doing is like all\nkinds of stuff being falsely modest like\nyou know eliciting reassurance in some\nway but it's kind of like this sneaky\nkind of manipulative\nsort of like you know like woe is me and\nlike you're so awesome and i'm so bad\nand they do that like all these things\nbecause when you say that to someone\nright it's not insulting\nlike when you're dealing with an\narrogant narcissist you don't want to\nspend time with them because they're\nbeing an [ __ ] to you\nand when you're dealing with a\nnon-traditional narcissist it's like you\nstill don't want to spend time with them\nbut you feel guilty for not wanting to\nspend with time time with them\nso you end up spending time with them\nanyway and like trying to convince them\nthat they're awesome\nit's kind of this weird thing that like\nonce again\nsort of enhances self-worth what doesn't\nreally enhance self-worth\ntemporarily but it doesn't really unders\nlike it doesn't really address the\ninsecurity\nbecause you're kind of manipulating them\ninto\nlike you know supporting you and so this\nis kind of an\ninteresting pattern of non-traditional\nnarcissism\nand it's it's interesting because the\nreason i call it narcissism is if we go\nback to the roots\nthere are a lot of common factors right\nso low internal self-worth and\nrelying on external sense of self-worth\nto\nbuffer your internal sense of self-worth\nthis is the last key thing okay this is\ngoing to be the last thing that ties all\nthis together\nspends a lot\nof time thinking\nabout how they\nare perceived so this is the last common\nelement\nso in both of these situations if we're\ntalking about what are the traits of\nnarcissism it's this box right here\nbecause both of these people at the end\nof the day 20 of their ram\nis spent thinking about how other people\nare thinking about them\noh does this person realize how awesome\ni am if they don't realize how\nawesome i am i better tell them does\nthis person\nthink about how pathetic i am if they\ndon't realize how pathetic i am i better\ntell them i better advertise\ni better get some get me some of that\nsweet sweet\nreassurance and then like and so this is\nsort of like a good example of\nunderstanding like traditional and\nnon-traditional narcissism so what are\nthe key features here\nand and what are we kind of talking\nabout so the first thing to understand\nis that\nnot all narcissists are the same and we\nsort of have this idea in society that\nnarcissism is characterized by like\narrogance and devaluing others and\nthings like that\nbut if we go to the roots of it there's\nanother subtle kind of narcissism\nand i call it narcissism but really from\na yogic perspective it's\na an ahamkar that's kind of bent out of\nshape\nlow internal self-worth so i need\nexternal reassurance from other people\nand then like since i need that external\nreassurance from other people like it\ndoesn't matter how i get it i can go the\narrogant route\nor i can go the pathetic route they're\nboth still the same thing\nright so i spend a lot of time thinking\nabout how other people perceive me\nand so what what ends up happening is if\nyou look at this person why am i using\nthe term narcissism it's because\neverything revolves around them still\nright even though you feel really\nterrible\nit's like if someone doesn't have the\ntime to talk to you today\nit's like oh my god like i am that i'm\nnot worth\nanything like they're they i'm not\nworth it enough for them to spend time\nwith me like i'm not good enough whereas\nit's like no it has nothing to do with\nyou it's because like\nthis person is moving today like it has\nnothing to do with you\nand so in both of these cases this mind\nthat they have\nthinks that everything is kind of\nrevolving around them right if someone\ndoesn't have time for you\nthat's a personal insult or is justified\nbased on how little you're worth but at\nthe end of the day like you're not\nconsidering them\nyou're just thinking about how they\nthink about you\nand so that's kind of we caught why we\ncall it sort of traditional and like\nnon-traditional narcissism\nokay and so it has these other features\nlike being covert being\nthin skin being hyper vigilant\nidealizing people instead of\nnot idealizing people this is why i like\nthe sunscreen because if you\nthink about that kind of person it's\nlike is that person really narcissistic\nnot really\nbut they have features of an ahamkar or\nan ego that is functioning in a\nparticular way\nwhich is low self-worth on the inside\ntherefore i need self-worth from the\noutside and i'm going to spend a lot of\ntime\nfiguring out how to get those emotional\nneeds met\nno matter what strategy i use i'm gonna\nget\nother people to notice and appreciate\nand tell me how great i am\ni can do it by pretending to be pathetic\nor i can do it by pretending to be\nawesome\nbut it's still pretending and i still\nneed it from other people\nyou know a lot of people are going to be\nasking what do we do about it\nso once again i think the first thing is\nto understand these patterns\nright like notice what you're doing\nnotice like what you do with people\nwhen you're feeling like emotionally\nneedy\nhow do you manipulate them into engaging\nin a behavior with you\nright so like like and notice that kind\nof thing and the interesting thing is\ninstead of like giving into that\nbehavior\njust notice the need and maybe be a\nlittle bit transparent with them and be\nbe like hey i understand you're busy i'm\nkind of feeling down today like do you\nhave some time to talk\nand just be transparent that you have an\nemotional need it can be\nabsolutely terrifying but\nnotice yourself first and then start to\nlike give people the benefit of the\ndoubt and let them participate\nin the relationship in a healthy way\nwhich can be challenging\nso unfortunately there aren't like tips\ni mean i can give you a tip but it's\nlike easier said than done\nso this is the kind of thing where\nthere's like actually a lot more work\nthat has to go into it right so we can\ndiagnose someone with depression if\nsomeone asks me what are tips for\ndepression well there's like treatment\nfor that right\nso in the same way like you can you know\nwork with a therapist work with a coach\nwe have a section of dr k's guides on\nthe nature of self which is sort of\ngeared towards\nnarcissism and self-esteem and sort of\nthese ideas of like\nwhat is the true self and what do you\nthink you are and what's the difference\nthere\num so we've got some of that kind of\nstuff in there so hopefully that'll help\nbut i just wanted to kind of explain\nthat concept because i know it's kind of\nweird that i called like\nthose kinds of people narcissists so i\nwanted to clarify and also explain to\nyou that\nyou know there's there's actually this\nlike common route to narcissism which\ncan manifest in two separate ways\nso the non-traditional narcissist is the\nsame as a needy person\npotentially yes right so if we if we go\nback to the core\nof it an emotionally needy person\ncan sometimes have this kind of world\nrevolves around them\nsort of perspective but i think that and\nemotionally there are other reasons why\nother people can be like emotionally\nneedy without that ahamkar kind of thing\nso it's one of the things on the\ndifferential diagnosis of an emotionally\nneedy person\nare there other terms for the\nnon-traditional narcissist\ni'm not sure i think that\nsometimes people will uh call them like\ncovert narcissists as well like it\ndepends on\nwhat the literature is that's why i like\nto use the yogic terminology because\ni think the yogic terminology still\nexplains it the best\nwhich is it's like it's a humkar it's\nlike a sense of\nego and a low sense of self-worth and\nwhen you\nstart with that low sense of self-worth\nyou can get those emotional needs met\nthrough two different pathways\nhow to recover from being hurt by a\nparticularly manipulative narcissist\noh man this is tricky um it takes a lot\nof work but i'd say one really powerful\nthing that people\ndon't tend to under utilize is actually\nforgiveness\nso once you get really manipulated by an\nemotional narcissist i'd say forgiveness\nand boundary setting\nare the two things that you need to do\nto like fix it right so you sort of\nunderstand and you accept that this\nperson\nlike doesn't have control over their\nemotional needs so they engage in\nmanipulative behavior so like\nyou know that like it's nothing personal\nit's not like they tried to screw me\nover it's just\nthey're hungry or thirsty and they're\ngonna get their food or drink however\nthey can\nand at the same time while you can\nforgive them for that and like let go of\nthat\nanger and let go of that resentment\nthrough forgiveness you also want to set\nsuper firm boundaries because as long as\nthey are\nlike you're letting them back into your\nlife like it's gonna keep happening over\nand over and over again\nso this is also really confusing for\nsome people but you can forgive someone\nand never talk to them again forgiveness\nis about\nletting go of your own resentment and\nlike not blaming them anymore\nand at the same time like setting a\nboundary like you can forgive someone\nand also like move on so i'll give you\nguys just another like simple\nexample to drive that home so like let's\nsay i'm in a romantic relationship and\nmy partner cheats on me\ni can forgive him i can say like you\nknow i understand you made a mistake\nlike\ni understand you didn't mean to and\nyou know you hurt me a lot but i can\nforgive you for hurting me like i\nforgive you\nand also i'm never gonna date you again\nthis is where people get really confused\nbecause they assume\nthat forgiveness means that we're wiping\nthe slate clean\nand we're reversing time and we're back\nto square one\nright like but that's not necessarily\nthe case you can let go of that\nresentment you can say like look\ni'm not gonna like i'm gonna go on and\nlive my life\nand i'm not gonna hold on to this anger\nand like don't worry about it like you\nmade a mistake\ni forgive you you go live your life i'm\ngonna go live mine they're like wait but\ni want to get back together you're like\nyeah i\nunderstand you want to get back together\nbut i can't trust you\ni can forgive you but like i don't trust\nyou and i'm not interested in a\nrelationship with you\ni don't hold it like you know i i i wish\nyou no\nill will or malice like i hope you go\nand find a healthy relationship and i'm\ngoing to go find a healthy relationship\ntoo\nit's just i don't think i want to do\nthat with you\nso someone's asking what's so let's\nlet's understand a couple of things one\nis\nwhat's the point of forgiveness and\nsecond is what's the point of telling\nthem that you forgive them\nso the point of forgiveness i mean sure\nyou can sort of do it for them but like\ni really think forgiveness is powerful\nuh for your own benefit because if we\nthink about\nuntil i forgive what am i holding on to\ni'm holding on to anger i'm holding on\nto resentment\nyou know and you're allowed to hold on\nto that if you want to i'm not saying\nnecessarily that it's\nbad to hold on to them but that's just\nwhere you need to make a judgment call\nis this resentment interfering in my\nlife yes or no\nright and if the resentment is bothering\nyou then like it's it can be healthy to\nforgive\nand then what's the point in telling\nthem because they may be feeling guilty\nand they may want your forgiveness they\nmay be asking your\nfor your forgiveness you're no one is\nentitled to forgiveness by the way right\nso\nforgiveness is entirely the right of the\naggrieved party\nlike the person who committed the sin or\nthe crime\nis not entitled to forgiveness of any\nway shape or form\nand so i i would say you can tell them\nbecause you know that way they can move\non with their life it's good for them\nand at the same time hold your boundary\nright like fool me once shame on you and\ni'm not going to give you the chance to\nfool me again\ncan you move on without forgiving i\nthink so i know it sounds kind of weird\nbut i think you can move on without\nforgiving right\nyou can say you're you can accept so you\nhave to accept that's the key thing\nmoving on is about acceptance\nyou can accept that this person hurt you\nand that you've forgiven them and you\nlet them go no hard feelings let go of\nthe results\nor you can accept you know what i'm\nnever gonna forgive this person\nfor the rest of my life i will detest\nthem and what they did\nand that's just like i'ma hold that it's\ngonna be part of me like it's cool like\ni'm gonna go on and live my life\nand i can still build a healthy life but\nthere is a corner of my heart\nin which i will always loathe and detest\nthis person for what they did to me\nand that's okay no problem and if people\nare skeptical about that because we\ndon't hear that very much right\nso i'm a psychiatrist who works with\ntrauma survivors\nand one of the healthiest things that\ni've ever realized in therapy because\nyou don't get taught this\nit's like to tell a trauma server you\nknow what you want to hold on to your\n[ __ ] hatred you do it\nyou do it go for it no big deal i will\nsupport you\nyou detest this person and you never\nforgive them and they\nthey ruined your life now i want to help\nyou build\nrebuild another one so like let's work\non that right we don't want them\nruining our life to like ruin the rest\nof your life\ndo they absolutely ruin things for the\nfirst 28 years\nyes but we're still going to rebuild but\nyou can absolutely detest that person\nwhen they die if you want to go and you\nknow like don't go to the funeral and if\nyou want to you know\nflip them go walk over to the grave and\nand flip them the middle finger like\nthat's fine you can do that\nyou don't have to forgive him you can\nhold on to that hatred\nbut we don't want their what they've\ndone to you in that hatred\nto prevent you from like building a life\nworth living right you're 28 years old\nyou've got 40 years left they screwed\nyou over for the first 28 but like let's\ndo something about the next 40.\nand if you want to hate them for doing\nthat to you like i'm completely behind\nyou let's do it\nlet's talk about how awful they are\nbecause they sure do sound awful\nyeah so when someone says i want those\nyears back bro that's\nthat's where acceptance comes in because\nyou ain't never getting them back\nright so you can be resentful over that\nand you can get stuck\nyou can spend all of your time thinking\nabout the time that you've lost\nand never looking forward and then your\nentire life will be spent\nin resentment or you can acknowledge\nthat time is over\nand this is where i should be looking\nand you can build something worth living\nhow would you handle a parent that's\ntoxic acceptance slash forgiveness\nand boundaries folks\nsame answer all the time we'll teach you\na lot more about this so we're planning\nlike something a lot more in-depth about\nhow to set boundaries and things like\nthat but\nthe short answer is like you accept like\nyou know they're toxic and they're not\ngoing to change\ndon't expect them to change you're just\ngonna\nyou're setting yourself up for\ndisappointment and frustration\nthey ain't gonna change you treat them\nlike a force of nature\nrain is gonna be wet it's just who they\nare if you have a narcissistic parent\nlike that's not going to change like\nmaybe one day it'll change and then\nlucky you it's like winning the lottery\nmy narcissistic parents is now capable\nof being emotionally available\nwow i never expected that\nand at the same time like they're your\nparent but they are the way they are so\nlike you know\nyou can get frustrated at the rain for\nmaking you wet or you can\ngrab an umbrella and like\nmove to arizona where it never rains\nso i encourage everyone who's got toxic\nparents to like do your dharma\nis their child right so whatever that\nentails it can be very little or it can\nbe a lot\nlike i'd encourage you to like try to be\nnice to them and try to help them if\nthey need help\nand also like you know if it's like one\nif you see them once a year because it's\nchristmas time because you're their kid\nand you're like okay fine\ni'm gonna i'm gonna have a crappy\nchristmas this year and i'm just gonna\nsee them once for one week and they ask\nyou i never see you this happens a lot\nright because like\nif you set limits with your parents any\ntime you show up\nthey're like oh my god i can't believe\nyou abandoned me like don't you love me\nlike\ni only see you during christmas and then\nyou stop and you ask him\nso like what's your understanding of why\ni come here\nonce a year they're like because you\ndon't love me\nyou you don't like me this is so like\nyou're so mean you don't care about your\nmom\nand then and then you can kind of point\nout to them that like everything you're\nsaying is about you\nhas it ever occurred to you that like i\nam a human being in this relationship\nwhat do you think my needs are that i\nonly see you once a week and then\nthey're gonna be super confused\nthey're like just tell me tell me what\nto do i'll do anything\nand that's when you say okay if you were\nwilling to do anything\ni want you to think about what my needs\nare in this relationship and tell me\nwhat you think they are\nno just tell me just tell me this is the\nproblem\nyou're you're not even spending the\nenergy to think about it\njust think about it and tell me what you\nthink i need in this relationship\nno you won't tell me like why are you\nbeing so mean and you can say this is\nexactly why i come once a year\nbecause any time i have a conversation\nwith you it's always like woe is me\nand i i literally am unable to have a\nconversation with you\ni'm asking you to think about my\nperspective and i'm not seeing you being\nable to actually do that which i don't\nblame you for it's fine like you are who\nyou are\nand your grandparents you know weren't\nnice to you either so like no big deal\nbut if you want to understand why i come\nonce a year that's why i come once a\nyear because when i come here\ni don't feel like i can have a\nconversation with you like tell me how\nto have a conversation i've asked you\nwhat to do\nwhat did you hear me say what did you\nhear me ask\nyou want me to what again just tell me\ni'll do anything\ni want you to just think about what my\nneeds are in this relationship\nthey're like okay fine will you stay\nlonger\nno i won't i'm willing to stay for four\ndays\ni love you mom but i can't tolerate you\nit's the most i can handle and until\nyou're able to understand my needs and\nlike\nhelp support them in some way like i\ncan't be here for longer than four days\ni'm sorry i wish i we i wish i had more\nstamina\nis it so painful to be with me yes\nyes it is oh my god\nyou hate me i don't hate you i just find\nyou intolerable\nright like i'm trying but like i need\nyou to do more than what you're doing\nright and that's where like sometimes\nyou don't want to pull punches because\nthat's what the narcissists do right\nyou guys see that have the narcissistic\nparent we just flipped to the vulnerable\nside\noh my god do you hate me you're\nyou're because you're you're you know\nyou're\nbludgeoning your parent with truth and\nthen they play that card\nthey're gonna find some way to\nemotionally manipulate you\ninto like telling them that they're okay\nthey're looking for that one thing no\nmom of course i don't hate you\noh my god mom i'm so sorry please stop\ncrying and then you pat mother\nnarcissism non-traditional narcissism\nplus traditional heart system\nthey can flip back and forth with\nwhatever they need to get their [ __ ]\nemotional needs met\nthat's how it works whatever they need\nthey'll find a way to get it so you\ndon't give it to them you lay your\nboundaries you encourage them to\nintrospect\nyou can also say things like here's what\ni think would be helpful you're like i\ndon't know what to\ni don't know how to think about your\nneeds i don't know what you want you can\nsay okay so if you're having trouble\nfiguring out i totally understand\ni recommend you see a therapist and talk\nto them about it and see what they think\nthey're like okay so i made a\nrecommendation to you\ni think that would be helpful you're\ntelling me you don't know what to do i\nthink this will be helpful\nand you're choosing not to do it what is\nthe therapist going to tell me you just\ntell me what is the therapist content\ni'm not sure\nit's my recommendation do you want to do\nwhat i'm recommending yes or no you\ndon't have to\nyou just tell me i don't see how it's\ngonna help why won't you just tell me\nwhat did i do wrong\nyeah so i've said what i'm gonna say i\ndon't think continuing this conversation\nis useful at all\ni'm happy to listen\nokay so i've shared with you what i\nthink we need to move this relationship\nforward you're welcome\nto do it if you want to you're welcome\nto not do it if you don't want to\ni don't see the point tell me the point\nyou know like go to therapy and you'll\nsee\nlike no tell me like why should i do it\nand they're just constantly trying to\nengage with you\nconstantly trying to pull you in pull\nyou in pull you and pull you in\nare you telling me i'm broken are you\ntelling me that i'm a bad parent are you\ntelling me that\ni ruined your life there it is looking\nfor the reassurance\nand you can say did you hear me say any\nof those things\noh okay i'm gonna just step out i'm\nliterally gonna step out of the\nconversation right now because\ni see that you're talking but i don't i\nthink i've already made my point you\njust keep talking\nyou seem to be like trying to corner me\nwith like asking me for particular stuff\nso i'm literally going to walk away from\nthis conversation you turn around\nyou walk out because they will continue\nasking you questions\nthey will continue talking to you until\nthey wear you down\nyou get become cognitively disinhibited\nyou can't control your emotions anymore\nand then if you lash out at them they're\ngonna feel vindicated\nbecause they feel unloved they feel\nhated and if you lash out at them\nthey're like oh see he hates me oh my\ngod i was right\nall along and then the cycle reinforces\nso literally extract yourself from the\nconversation\nonly solution you can do\nokay what if you do hate them you could\ntell them\nit may not help what i would say is that\nthere's a part of me that hates you\ni'd leave some wiggle room in there\nshe's in my room though so\nwalk out of your room i can't give\nadvice though they'll be like you came\nout of my\nand now giving me advice no i'm not\ngiving you advice i'm letting you know\nwhat i think what i need in this\nrelationship you can do it or not do it\nand they're like screw you i ain't gonna\ndo it\nyou're like okay fine no big deal\ni've asked you to do something you don't\nhave to do it right i came out of your\nv five asterisks anyway yeah so for a\nlot of people who are talking about like\ni get slapped and stuff like yeah so\nthere's there's a whole like\nthis is why i like so i i'm kind of\ngoing off script here this is why like\nthis is actually a whole\nlong thing which includes\npower dynamics okay so that's the really\ntricky thing here\nis that if your parents if there's a\npower dynamic between you and your\nparents you have to respect that power\ndynamic you can't get over it\nyeah need skill 100 for this yes you\nabsolutely do so let me explain\nsomething to y'all chat\nif dr k is sitting here on stream and\ntelling you just do this\njust say this man it's it's how it works\ni want you all to understand\ni have literally had like eight to ten\nyears\nof training and experience like\nresidency is like 80 to 100 hours a week\nfor four years okay so what i am capable\nof doing\nis not because i'm amazing but also is\nlike requires a lot of like\nexperience right i am a professional i'm\na professional\ntalker and so you you all need to\ncut yourself some slack give yourself\nsome patience\nbe patient with yourself and work on\nthese things like\na little bit at a time and i've seen\npeople get there it's going to take you\na year to not kidding\nlike don't expect everything to turn\naround six months from now\nsetting limits with your parents is a\nlifelong journey\nokay it is exhausting\nbut you know you can do it it just takes\neffort\nenergy awareness and patience like you\nall will get there like i have faith in\nyou\nlike i don't think you have to become a\npsychiatrist because we learn all kinds\nof other crap\nright it's not just setting uh\nboundaries with\nentitled parents or narcissistic parents\nthere's more there's things like ect and\ntms and pharmacology there's a lot of\nstuff packed in there but like it's\ngonna take some time\nwhy is life so exhausting because we\ndon't understand the rules and no one\nteaches us\nthat is why life is exhausting"
