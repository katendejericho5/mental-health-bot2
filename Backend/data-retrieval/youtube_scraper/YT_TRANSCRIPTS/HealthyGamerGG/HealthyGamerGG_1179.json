    "transcript": "okay a request for dr k to talk about\nnarcissism i watch dr k's entitled\nparents video\nand as i listen to him explain the\ndefinition of a narcissist i realize\nthat i do know a narcissist it's me\ngood job bro basically i only knew about\nnarcissism from a grandmother who\npeople called a narcissist and all the\ninternet horror stories and it led me to\nbelieve that narcissism is something\nelse\ni don't believe i am better than\neveryone else i believe i'm worse\nactually\nand i don't use people or intentionally\ndo evil things to them\nbut i fit dr k's definition of\nnarcissism to a t\ni have been told by friends that i only\nthink about myself and i seem to be\nunable to consider how other people are\nfeeling before i do or say things\ni've also recently caught myself feel\nhaving anxiety that a friend's sad mood\nthat i knew wasn't about me the french\nhad told me about several difficult\nthings\nin his life so i i knew for sure it\nwasn't about me was actually about me\nthat's perfect\ni mean that's a good example narcissists\nare so vilified on the internet and i\nreally want dr k to make a video\ncompletely dedicated to how narcissists\ncan change their mindset and behavior\nagain\nagain i don't consider myself a horrible\nperson and i believe\nand i badly want to be a better one i\nknow that\nhe would take a very empathetic loving\napproach and understand we're not just\nhorrible people to be avoided at all\ncosts\nthere's even a little bit of\nthere's something about that statement\nthat just strikes me as\nokay something about this person's\nnarcissism is coming through in the\nstatement\nso here just to recap for people\nso a lot of people think that narcissism\nis being is what they call being an\nentitled [ __ ]\non the internet right so if you go to\nthe subreddit am i the [ __ ] that's\nfull of narcissists and i think the term\ngets thrown around a lot\nentitlement narcissism there's a lot of\nlike things that kind of get wrapped up\ntogether\nand i think the challenge is that\nnarcissism is\nmore than being an [ __ ] okay\nthere there are many [ __ ] who are\nnarcissists there are many [ __ ] who\nare not narcissists and there are many\nnarcissists who are not [ __ ]\nso here are a couple of features that i\nreally think about in terms of\nnarcissism\none is a sense of\ninternal self-worth that is low or shaky\nand therefore requires outward\nvalidation to like preserve a sense of\nself\nso what this kind of means is like if i\ndon't feel confident in myself\ni'm gonna require the rest of the world\ntelling me that i'm an awesome person\nto feel good about myself and so what\nhappens with narcissistic people\nis they engage in behaviors that\nlead to those kinds of like outward\nshows\nso for example you know a lot of people\nwill like\nbe like sympathy farmers so they'll go\naround like people who are narcissistic\nwill go around and like\ntell stories of like woe is me and what\nhappens is like when they\nare sympathy farming people will be like\noh my god poor you and then they\nfeel cared for right they feel loved\nbecause other people\nare like telling them oh my god that\nmust be so so\nhard for you the problem is that it\nbecomes narcissistic because you become\nself-centered like\nand this is where the self-centeredness\ncomes in because when someone else is\ntelling a story about sympathy you're\nlike\noh wow like look at that sweet sweet\nsympathy that that person is getting\nlike\ni need me some of that sweet sweet\nsympathy man like i feel bad about\nmyself i don't feel loved like let me\nget some that sweet\nsympathy oh man you got you got\nemotionally abused by your parents\ni got physically abused emotionally\nabused i got all the abuses man\nand so then you one-up them right you\nengage in behaviors to garner that\nsympathy\nbut in doing so you actually like are\ninsensitive to the needs of others\nright so that's how like that narcissism\nkind of like complex works\nso one aspect of it is like insecurity\nin your\ninternal environment requiring you to\nengage in behaviors that garner that\nsympathy\nand this is also why like people like\ngive you the sympathy but they feel\nmanipulated by it right like they're\nlike man [ __ ] that like\nlike you don't sometimes people don't\neven understand what's going on but they\nstart to dislike you\nthe second aspect of narcissism is\nself-centeredness\nit's hard but that like you can't not\nthink about yourself\nand this post has such a good example\nthey're like\nyou know if your friend is having a bad\nday your mind automatically thinks about\nhow you are making their day worse\nyou're not an [ __ ] it's just your\nmind is like oh my god how did i screw\nup\nlike i'm screwing up so bad this person\nis so upset\nand the person can even say hey it has\nnothing to do with you like\nthis is the world does not revolve you\nmy suffering does not revolve around you\nbut their brains are just like\npopulating thoughts but like\nyou're just they're just saying that to\nmake me feel better but it is my fault\nthey're trying to say that to make me\nfeel better but clearly i'm screwing up\nin some way i could be a better friend\nand so it's kind of interesting but like\nthe world kind of revolves around them\nso sometimes that\nresults in like entitlement and [ __ ]\nbehavior right where you show up\nsomewhere and you're like\nwhere is my food waiter i've been\nwaiting for 15 minutes\nand you have like no conception that\nother human beings have like\nlives and challenges and maybe the\nwaiter has something going on or like\nwhatever\nright so sometimes it results in\nassholery but like it doesn't always\nresult in [ __ ]\nsometimes it actually results in like\nreally low self-esteem\nsometimes it results in like a lot of\nlike once again behaviors that can be\nfrustrating to other people like\nreassurance seeking\nlike are you sure that you're not upset\nat me are you really sure that you're\nnot upset at me like are you really sure\nthat you're upset because your dad\npassed away and it's not my fault\nare you sure and so it's not like you're\nbeing\nmean or an [ __ ] to them but you're\nalso doing things that\nmake people like not want to engage with\nyou\nand so that's kind of like the end\nresult of narcissism is that people\ndon't enjoy\nbeing around you and the reason they\ndon't enjoy being around you is not\nbecause of like\nsome you're not fundamentally like a bad\nperson\nit's that your narcissism dictates\ncertain kinds of behaviors that you're\nhungry for\nthat feel like manipulative or\nfrustrating to the other person\nand neither of y'all can really pin it\ndown\nwhat is actually wrong here it's a\nfeeling it's like something feels a\nlittle bit like manipulative about this\nbut you're not really sure what it is\nand so you can't really call attention\nto it you can't really fix it\nand this actually further reinforces the\ninsecurity and this is why narcissists\nget stuck\nbecause as you engage in these like\nhungry behaviors to get\nthings people feel manipulated they\ndon't feel\nlike you're empathic you're not really\nlistening to them you're one-upping them\nyou're kind of making it about you\nand then as they dislike you and feel\nmanipulated they don't really like\ncriticize you but they start to pull\naway\nand as they start to pull away like the\ninsecurity gets worse\nright and then the vicious cycle like\ncontinues because then you're like you\ncan feel this person pulling\npulling away and and then it's like if\nwe think about this person you know\nuse this example of are you sure you're\nnot sad because of me and they're like\nno dude i'm really not sad because of\nyou\nyou're not mad at me no i'm not mad at\nyou and then is the more you keep asking\nthe more mad at you they get and then as\nthey like they're like you know what bro\njust don't worry about it i'm just gonna\nhang up\nthe person leaves and then you're like\noh my god they're mad at me and it\nbecomes a self-fulfilling prophecy\nand the next time that someone is upset\nthat has nothing to do with you\nyour mind has learned this lesson oh\nthey were upset with me i did screw it\nup\nand then the whole cycle repeats\nso that's sort of like the narcissistic\nconstruction we can go into more detail\nso step number one it's about internal\ninsecurity that requires external\nvalidation to make you feel good about\nyourself\nit's hungry you're hungry you're hungry\nfor it that causes all kinds of\nbehaviors\nsecond thing is that it's self-centered\nwhich means that\nother people are living their lives but\nfor some reason\nwhatever is going on in other people's\nlives\nyou feel like the pc and they are npcs\nas opposed to them being the pc and you\nbeing the npc\neverything revolves around you not like\nin an [ __ ] entitled way but like your\nmind can't help but think\nabout you in the situations that other\npeople have\nand then those kinds of behaviors will\nin\nit will result in impacting your\nrelationships in a way that\nreinforces the insecurity and like makes\nthe whole problem worse\nand then makes you hungrier to begin\nwith\nthat's narcissism in a nutshell we'll\ndefinitely talk about it more"
