    "transcript": "so the solution was when you play in\nyour region\nhow do you feel about the people in the\ngames that you're with\nand he's like they're dog and i\ntold him as long as you treat them like\ndog\nyou will be treated like you will think\nthat you are dog because that's the\nconstruction\nthat's the play that your mind enacts\ni recently discovered that a lot of the\nemotions i've felt in the past can be\ndescribed as fear of missing out\nor fomo i don't know if there's a mental\nhealth equivalent\ni've had the hardest time trying to\ndescribe this feeling and i've always\ndefaulted to\nenvy that wasn't always true i get fomo\nfrom people doing stuff i don't even\ncare about or want and it's borderline\ndebilitating\ni've ended friendships because of the\nlife they live and how much it scared me\nand upset me that they were living more\nlife than me even though i didn't care\nto have that particular thing\ni've recently pledged to myself to live\nmore and improve\ndoing more and experiencing stuff i\nhaven't experienced before\nbut i still get this absolutely\nheartbreaking feeling that others are\nsomehow enjoying it more than me\nand i get angry at myself for not\nenjoying myself or finding satisfaction\nin things\nit's a vicious cycle that keeps feeding\nin on itself and causing\ncausing me to want to give up even\ntrying\ni think if i was somehow able to find\nthe real satisfaction in things\ni do i'd be less likely to feel dwarfed\nby other people's experiences\noh man i feel like each of these could\nbe an hour-long lecture chat\nthe fear of missing out is a really\ninteresting\nchallenge and i think once again it's\nlike an umbrella term that may have\nmultiple\nroots to it okay the first thing that\ni'm going to share with you guys\nso is actually from yoga so it's a\nreally interesting\npassage from i forget which upanishad\nmade maybe the taitreya upanishad\nthat talks about proximal emotions and\ndistal emotions\nso what the yogis realized is that\nthere's a set of emotions that we\nfeel that are like\nmore acceptable that actually have like\nunderlying\nmore toxic emotions underneath\nso like envy can actually be like the\nproximal emotion\nit's like oh like i feel happy for\nsomeone\ni wish i was like that and underneath\nthat can actually be like\nanger or hatred so it's kind of really\ninteresting because i'm not surprised\nthat we see\nif you guys paid attention to the case\nright like the further down we go\nthe more we get to like hatred so\ninterestingly enough\nwhen you're dealing with these proximal\nemotions and distal emotions like the\nacceptable emotion which is like envy\nlike it's okay to be envious of someone\nright like i wish i had that\nit's less okay to be like i hate that\nperson for having that\nand so the interesting thing is that you\nknow a lot of this\ncould come from dealing with your hatred\nso like do you hate those people\nlike do you hate people who have more\nthan you what is it like that\nother people have had more than you and\nyou have not\nso i would ask this person if you have\nfomo and you kind of feel envious of\nother people\nask yourself like step one underneath\nthe envy is their hatred\nand like how do you because a lot of\ntimes like we don't want to hate our\nfriends right like it's very\nconflicting internally it's very\ndistinct\nso we don't let ourselves feel that and\nsince we don't let ourselves feel that\nit never goes away it just stays there\nit lingers\nit's the trash can that's rotting in the\ncorner that you never let yourself look\nat\nbecause you never explore it and so it\nkind of like fuels this stuff\nthat's number one okay so explore for\nhatred underneath\nthe second thing is to start to think a\nlittle bit about like when did you miss\nout\nright so now we're gonna take the\nsumscar approach so like i\nif i was talking to this person in an\ninterview what i would kind of ask them\nis like\nwhen did you start missing out in life\nwhat does it kind of feel like to miss\nout like have there been times in your\nlife where like\nyou know there was someone who like got\nsomething that you didn't have\nand like there was like the person who\nwas happy and then there was like you\nwho was like neglected and you really\nwanted to be that person\nand explore that stuff that's how you\nmay find the root of it\nokay so to ask yourself when did you\nstart missing out\nwhen was the first time that you felt\nfomo really really powerfully\nand forget about social media because\nchances are it has\nlike it may be something for your\npersonal life maybe something when you\nwere young\nlike your parents took your sibling on a\ntrip and they left you behind like\nsomething like that okay\nthe third thing is that social media\nmakes fomo worse\nright so like social media creates a\nsystem for our brain\nthat is busted so if i have 30\nfriends on facebook the stuff that\nfacebook is going to populate my feed\nwith is the stuff that gets the most\nlikes\nso person number one has a birthday\nbunch of likes bunch of comments i see\nthat person number two the next day goes\non vacation\nperson number three has a baby person\nnumber four graduates from college\nperson number five wins an award person\nnumber six gets engaged\nperson number seven gets an uh promotion\nperson number eight\ngoes has a big surprise party that their\nparents throw for them\nperson number 10 gets a gift from their\nparents gets a brand new car\nand what happens is our mind sees\nall of these like high points from 30\ndifferent people's lives and then what\nwe\nsee appears to be like this glot of a\nperfect life\nbecause our brain doesn't really process\nthat like for every post this person\nmakes\nthat they get a thousand likes they make\na thousand posts that get one like\nwhat your brain sees is the thousand\nposts that you make that get one like\nso this kind of fomo phenomenon is like\nvery clearly tied to social media\nand like is almost predatory in terms of\nthe way that it like\nyou know enhances this feeling so there\nis this stuff about you know\nenvy and hatred there's absolutely\nfinding the roots of it and then there's\nlike what propagates the phenomenon of\nfomo in your life what builds up fomo\ndespite the roots\nwhat's the fertilizer we're throwing\nwhat's the fuel what's the gasoline\nthat we're pouring on top of the fire\nthe fire's there the fire is there\nbecause of deep yogic roots\nand past experiences in your life and\nthen social medias\nthe gasoline so this is where people say\njust get off social media\nwhich is challenging for any number of\nreasons but my experience has been that\njust getting off of social media doesn't\nfix the problem that's the boomer\nsolution\njust stop it no like people had fomo and\nenvy and hatred and jealousy far\nbefore social media social media making\nit worse is it aggravating it absolutely\nright but then there's also like the\nroots of the problem that you kind of\nhave to get to\nso what i'd say to this person and if\nyou're kind of thinking about fomo right\nis that like\nit's normal to have fomo it's important\nto understand that social media is going\nto exacerbate it\nbut really ask yourself what are the\nunderlying emotions that are like\ndriving my feeling of fomo and then the\nfourth thing that they said which i\nthink makes perfect sense\nis um if i'm able to somehow find real\nsatisfaction in things i do i'd be less\nlikely to feel dwarfed by other people's\nexperiences\nthat person's precisely correct but it's\nthe other way around\nyou will never find real satisfaction in\nthings as long as you\nare comparing based on other people\nthe way to find real satisfaction in\nthings is to let go of comparison\nand so as long as your mind looks at\nsomeone else and says this person is\nbetter or worse than\nmine me you will never find satisfaction\nor happiness\nand this is the really tricky thing so\nthe last thing if you the secret to fomo\nokay if you want to really unplug fomo\nthere's one tiny psychological life hack\nas much as i detest the term\nthat you can use that will actually\ndisarm fomo\nand that is you feeling superior to\nother people in particular situations\nso as long as you let yourself feel\nsuperior to others\nthe reverse of that will happen to you\nyou will feel inferior\nso letting go of your feelings of\ninferiority start by letting go of your\nfeelings of superiority\ni was working with a professional player\nfrom a particular region in a particular\nsport\nthis person is very good was very high\nup\nin their region and traveled and would\nboot camp in a different region that is\nknown to be a quote-unquote stronger\nregion\nand he would find himself in pub games\nwith other people\nwho were like the top players for that\nregion and he felt\nlike his words literally dog\nplaying with them\nany mistake he made he would feel like\noh my god like these\nepic players that i've looked up to my\nentire life must\nthink that i am dog he would think\nthat and he would ask me like how do i\nlet go of this like i just can't play\nwith these people\nit's really messing up my mental so the\nsolution was when you play\nin your region how do you feel\nabout the people in the games that\nyou're with and he's like they're dog\nand i told them as long as you treat\nthem like dog\nyou will be treated like you will think\nthat you are dog because that's the\nconstruction\nthat's the play that your mind enacts\nand as long as you're feeling superior\nit's just the flip side of the coin\nand so it's interesting because he's\ngotten a lot better\nright like he's like oh like the less\njudgmental he's become the less superior\nhe feels\nright towards those people like actually\nlike he has gotten way better\nand his performance is actually\nobjectively improved and\nand he has been placing higher in\ninternational events\nso the last thing about fomo is if you\nfeel inferior to other people\nyou can also disarm the suit feeling of\nsuperiority\nnotice that why do i feel better than\nthis person as you explore that you will\nactually deflate the inferiority with it\nit's both it's all ego\nahamkara right so the ahamkara so we'll\njust summarize with like sanskrit baby\nit goes back to the yoga\nthe ahamkada is the eye feeling it\ncompares\nas long as the hum god is active you're\ngoing to be making comparisons\nthe sense of identity the me the i'm a\ndoctor i went to harvard\nin my mind every time i say i went to\nharvard my mind is drawing a comparison\nto everyone who did it\nit makes me feel a little bit superior\nso i have to notice that\neach and every time and as long as i\nnotice that and i say actually you're\nnot better than anyone else\nlike just rng baby you just lucked out\nlike literally it was rng right\nand so as long as you're feeling\nsuperior to other people you're gonna be\nfeeling inferior somewhere else it's\nit's because equality is equality man\nlike you can't\nif you're not equal you're not equal and\nthat's gonna come with superiority and\ninferiority\nhow to not feel guilty about your\nsuccessful rng like it's rng dude\njust appreciate it just right so\nit's it can be challenging that's\nanother thing so\nwhen you say how to not feel guilty\nabout your successful rng it's not about\nthe rng it's about the feeling of guilt\nso the question is like\nwhy does your mind find something to\nfeel guilty about\njust can't chill that's what you need to\nwork on forget about the rng you can\nthis is the problem is that a lot of\npeople look at the\nobject that their mind looks at instead\nof the\nway that their mind looks at it like a\ncase of the what ifs\nright like a case of the shooter woulda\ncut us i should have done this i could\nhave done this i would have done this\nyour mind is always thinking like oh i\nshould have done this i should have done\nthis i should have done this\nwhy is your mind producing the should\nthoughts to begin with that's what you\nneed to focus on\nyou should focus on why your mind is\nfocusing on\nyeah i love this quote from billy fanboy\nthere's nothing from\nernest hemingway there's nothing noble\nin being superior to your fellow man\ntruman nobility is being superior to\nyour former self\nbeautiful"
