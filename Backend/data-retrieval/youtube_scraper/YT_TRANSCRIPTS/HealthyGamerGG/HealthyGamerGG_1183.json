    "transcript": "how much do you think sleep schedule\nimpacts mental health huge\nso if you look at sleep sleep is the one\nsymptom that i think is impacted by\nevery single mental health diagnosis\nfor the most part if i'm remembering\nthat correctly so i remember looking at\nyou know sort of like each mental it's\nthe most common element\nif if not every single one it is the\nmost common\nsleep disturbance is the symptom that is\nthe most common across all mental\nillnesses\nso the way that i understand that is\nlike sleep is the time\nthat your mind and brain use to like\nrepair itself\nor heal and so when your sleep is\nimpaired your healing function is\nimpaired and so it propagates mental\nillness\ndo you tell your patients to sleep\ngenerally speaking that is not something\ni say to them i don't say to them\nsleep what i will do is ask them how\ntheir sleep is\nand i will try to help them sleep\nhealthier because\nexactly like people are saying just\nsleep doesn't work okay so here's a\ncouple tips on sleep\nthree quick tips first of all if you\nwant to control your sleep schedule it's\nnot about bedtime it's about waking up\ntime\nit is far easier i'm not saying it's\neasier\nit's far easier to wake up when you're\ntired than it is to\ngo to sleep when you're not\nso if you're trying to control your\nsleep schedule\nyou're in for 48 to 72 hours of rough\nwake up\nokay so i'd say that what you all should\ndo is set an alarm\nset it loud and set it outside of hand\nreach\nideally like outside your door with the\ndoor open\nso when it rings you have to get up and\nphysically get out of bed\nbonus points if you can splash your face\nwith a little bit of water it'll help\nyou make up wake up\nby all means if you guys drink caffeine\ndo that\ncontrol your waking up in order to\ncontrol your sleep but i just go back\nso that that's where like yeah so you\nhave to learn how to not do that\nright so notice that you just want to go\nback and then as you're going back to\nbed\nask yourself do i want to switch\nuh fix my sleep schedule if the answer\nthat question is yes you can't well\nnot do i want to what matters to me more\nfixing my sleep schedule or going back\nto bed now\ntry to ask yourself that question second\nthought\nis screen time and blue light inhibit\nmelatonin production\nso ideally two hours before you try to\nfall asleep you want\nno access to screens so physiologically\nit's going to be\neasier to sleep because your melatonin\nwill start pumping\nand then you'll it'll like\nphysiologically literally be easier to\nsleep\nthird thing is a bedtime routine is very\nvery helpful for sleep\nso you can train your body and your mind\nto fall asleep at a particular time like\nin a very pavlovian way\ntwo hours but i'm addicted yeah it's\nhard dude not gonna lie\nso that's why there's a reason i started\nwith number one first\nbecause if you're tired enough despite\nso what we want to do so\ngetting a good sleep schedule is all\nabout\nharnessing the power of fatigue\nso that's what i recommend especially\ngamers so we're not gonna like we're\ngonna use\nfatigue as our gravity to fall asleep\nso the more you can increase your\nfatigue the easier it will be to\nget on a good sleep schedule you can\nread a book absolutely\nyou just don't want blue wavelength of\nlight\nso audiobook is good book is good\nyou know exercise if you guys feel like\nit stretch do yoga all that stuff is\nfantastic\ni think e-ink is actually okay yawn\nso it's funny that you guys mentioned\nthis because like literally today i'm\ni'm starting the process\nof resetting my sleep schedule so i woke\nup this morning about\nthree hours earlier than i usually do um\nso i'm resetting my sleep schedule as we\nspeak\nso now i'm already tired i'm gonna be\nready for bed in like four hours\ni have i've recently enrolled in school\nyes that is correct"
