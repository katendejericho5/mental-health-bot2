    "transcript": "i want to talk to y'all today a little\nbit about something that i call\nreintegration anxiety which is kind of\nweird okay\nso this is what i noticed something\nweird happened chat\nso back at the start of the the pandemic\nthere were you know everyone was like oh\ni'm stuck at home\nlike the journal of the american medical\nassociation did a study that showed that\ndepressive symptoms are 300 percent\nworse than they used to be\nanxiety was getting worse people didn't\nknow if they were going to be able to\npay their bills they didn't know what\nwas going to happen to the economy\nthey didn't know if they were going to\nbe able to pay their rent and so\neveryone was like oh my god the mental\nimpacts of kovitt are so bad man they\nsuck so hard\nand now that things are starting to open\nup it's kind of like\nweird because everyone was like i can't\nwait for covey to end i can't wait for\nkovid to end but now that covet is maybe\nstarting to end i know that delta\nvariant is bad but people are getting\nvaccinated people are starting to open\nand\nopen things up people are sort of like\nokay so are you thrilled that you're\ngonna be back in school and like hanging\nout with people socially\nsomething weird has happened especially\nwith a lot of the students that i work\nwith\nwhere they're kind of like actually i\nfeel really anxious about reintegrating\ninto society\nlike what i hear from students that i\nwork with is i'm not sure i'm gonna be\nable to like\ndo school anymore like i don't know if i\ncan do school\nand now that i can socialize with people\nit's like oh my god i can't wait to\nsocialize with people and it's like now\nwhen you think about socializing with\npeople\nyou want to do it but you feel like\nreally really anxious about it\nand it's really weird but the best term\nthat i can kind of come up with\nis something that i'd call reintegration\nanxiety and so it's it's kind of weird\nbut there seems to be a new kind of\nanxiety where everyone's been waiting to\nget back into society\nbut at the same time like now that we're\nable to do it it seems actually really\nhard to reintegrate into society\nso i'd like to do today is talk to you\nguys a little bit about this\nand sort of try to explain a little bit\nabout how i understand it\nokay so to begin with you know when\ncovet hit everyone was sort of like\nkind of positive about it like people\nfelt isolated people\nfelt depressed people felt anxious about\nthe future\num they had difficulty maintaining\nsocial connections and they actually\nturned to online communities to start to\nsocialize with people\nand the cool thing is that if you if you\nkind of look at you know data or not not\ndata because there aren't really a whole\nlot of studies about this but if you\nlook at people from our community what\nwe found is that\npeople who have robust online\nconnections\nwere actually a little bit resilient to\nthe negative\nimpacts of covet and what we did as a\nsociety is we turn to like more online\ninteractions\nand that's sort of a double-edged sword\nbecause research does show that spending\na lot of time on social media\num actually is has negative impacts on\nyour mental health\nand at the same time we were kind of\nstuck because we couldn't spend time\nwith people\nin the real world so like it was nice to\nhave like discord and twitch and things\nlike that\ngaming and so it's sort of like a little\nbit of a double-edged sword where like\ngamers were somewhat resilient but we're\nengaging in more social anxiety i mean\nsocial media so sometimes that can make\nmental health stuff worse\nso it's kind of a wash the interesting\nthing is that\nif you talk to people who engage a lot\nin in\nonline communities and like engage with\npeople social uh\nsocially online as opposed to the real\nworld what you find is when when they go\nback\nout into the real world you can form a\nreal connection online but when you go\nback out into the real world\nit seems to be hard for people and so\nwhat i found is that especially now like\nworking with a lot of students that\nyou know they've been hanging out on\ndiscord for the last year they've been\ndoing\nonline school and like zoom classes and\nall this kind of stuff\nand they've like hated it in some ways\nbut at the same time\nit's been sort of like comforting in\nsome ways\noh no so when kobit started everyone was\nlike\nthere was there were huge impacts to our\nnegative health people felt isolated\nthey felt depressed they felt anxious\nyou know um\nstudies showed that like depression and\nanxiety was like three times worse\nthan prior to covid the isolation was\nreally really messing with people\nthe gaming community was somewhat\nresilient to these effects especially at\nthe beginning because we already had\ngood online support systems\nand the rest of the world shockingly\nswitched over to like this online world\nwhere\nthis is how we socialize it was zoom\nbirthday parties\nand and you know like hanging out with\npeople\nover like discord and whatsapp and and\nstuff like that\nand so this was okay for a while right\nso people like\nespecially in the gaming community we\ndid okay for a while but then as the\npandemic wore on people were like i\ncan't wait to get back in school i can't\nwait to like see my friends again\nthis sucks i'm trapped in my house and\nso then something weird happened like\nnow that things are opening up and we're\nlike hey you can go socialize again and\nlike you're gonna be back in school like\nthe people that i work with are like\nwait a minute i actually feel really\nreally uncomfortable with that stuff\nand now they would they come to my\noffice and they say things like\nyou know i'm not sure i can actually do\nschool anymore\ni'm not sure like like i got invited to\na party but like i don't know if i\neven want to go and people are really\nconfused by this because\nthey're like you know at the beginning\nof the pandemic it's like okay we're\ngonna be trapped for a couple weeks like\ni'ma learn how to break\nbake bread i'm gonna learn how a new\nlanguage i'm gonna like learn all this\nstuff i'm gonna take this as an\nopportunity\nand then the isolation sets in the\ndepression sets in i'ma work on a\nproject\nand now that the world is opening up\nagain everyone's like oh god thank god\nlike that oh i can start doing things\nagain and now when you try to do things\nlike\nit seems actually really really hard to\ngo out and like get back into school and\ni have students that come to me and are\nsaying i'm not sure i can do school\nanymore like i hate\nzoom school but i don't know if i can\nactually cut it in real school\ni people are like i'm so isolated i'm so\nlonely i'm so depressed do you want to\ngo to this party no i feel super anxious\ngoing to the party\nso what's going on here why is this\nhappening\nand what can we do about it so this is\nsomething that for lack of a better term\ni call\nreintegration anxiety which is sort of\nlike this\ntendency to not be able to like go back\ninto the world\nand what i actually have found is that i\nthink that it correlates with some\ninteresting principles of neuroscience\nwhy is there a\nthere's a blanket in my door\nokay so going back to where things are\nso here's how\nhere's my understanding of like how\nreintegration anxiety works okay so when\nwe start socializing with people online\nwhat tends to happen is that our brain\nhas certain like social\ncircuits which sometimes don't get used\nand so\nstart to rust a little bit so if we\nthink about how our brain works what we\ndiscover\nis that you know if you don't use a part\nof your brain it kind of like starts to\nrust so if i speak two languages and\nthen i don't speak one of those\nlanguages for a few years\nwhat happens is that part of my brain is\nsort of like oh we don't need this\nanymore so let's get rid of it\nand what i found in people who interact\na lot online\nis that there are so there are social\ncircuits that start to go like\ndormant or rust so there are parts of\nour brain that will look at\nbody language facial expression tone\nother things like even like physical\ntouch and use those\nas means to kind of socially reassure us\nso when i when i interact with people a\nlot there are circuits of my\nin my brain that are very active that\nare telling me hey these people like you\nlike\nthey're sort of interpreting all of this\ninformation\nabout people's body language and the way\nthat they interact with me and their\nfacial expressions and things like that\nand it uses that information to reassure\nme\nand what happens when we interact with\npeople a lot online\nis those circuits of our brain kind of\nlike don't get used right because if i'm\ntalking to people on a discord call like\nsure it may be a video chat\nbut especially if i'm playing games and\nstuff like i'm not going to be\ninterpreting their body language and\ntheir facial expressions\nand if we think about the way that our\nmind looks at a social situation\nand tells us whether to be anxious or\nnot anxious\nwhat it'll do is include a lot of like\ninformation about stuff like facial\nexpressions and body language\nso when these circuits in our mind go\ndormant what happens is we're left with\na big question mark\nand if you think about what anxiety is\nthe bigger the question mark is the\nbigger your anxiety is going to be\nbecause anxiety is all about uncertainty\nright so if i think about i'm anxious\nabout going to the party\nand i ask people like you know if i ask\nsomeone why are you anxious about the\nparty they'll say things like i don't\nknow who's going to be there i don't\nknow if i'm going to say something\nstupid i don't know if people are going\nto like me\nso a lot of anxieties have to do with i\ndon't knows you don't know what's going\nto happen it's uncertain\nand so as we sort of turn to online\ninteraction and some of these other\ncircuits of our brain go dormant\nwhat we're left with is more and more\nquestion marks and the more\nwe're left with question marks the more\nlikely we are\nto feel anxious so now what's happened\nis we have these\nreassuring parts of our brain which\nnormally will help us feel comfortable\nin social situations\nthat have basically been dormant for a\nyear to a year and a half\nand so i think this is part of the\nreason that we're experiencing what i\ncall reintegration anxiety\nwe also sort of see this when it comes\nto online schooling so like\nyou know in school it requires like\nparticular faculties\nlike i have to wake up at a particular\ntime i have to like you know show up i\nhave to shower i have to do these\nkinds of things which online school\nsort of insulates me from and i don't\nhave to do those things\nso as those parts of our brain get rusty\nwe start to understandably\nstart to feel somewhat concerned about\nbeing able to kind of re-integrate\ninto regular school and so\nwhat we kind of end up with is um\nthis situation where like we're we're\nbasically like out of practice\nintegrating into the real world again\nand since we're out of practice this\nsort of results in anxiety\nand so people sort of ask me okay what\nshould i do about this\nright and so this is the kind of tricky\npart but like there's no way to\nartificially turn on those circuits\nagain and there's no way that i've been\nable to discover to sort of make it\npainless\nin terms of reintegrating into society\nbut what i have found is that people\ntend to do\nfar better than they think they're gonna\ndo and what i mean by that is that like\nyou know if i'm working with let's say\nlike\na college undergraduate who's like oh\ni'm not sure\nabout like starting up a study group\nbecause i don't know if the people are\ngonna like me and stuff\nand they're sort of envisioning all of\nthese negative things and what my\nexperience has been is that if you can\nactually\nget yourself to go there right if you\ncan show up there you may have a lot of\nanxieties that are very hard to\nalleviate\nahead of time but the cool thing is it's\nalmost like magic but once you\nshow up there and your brain starts to\nlike\ndust off these old circuits like facial\nexpression and body language\nwhat happens is the anxiety kind of\nstarts to melt away\nit's almost like you know if i if i've\ngotten rusty in terms of speaking a\nlanguage if i\nshow up in the country it's going to be\na little bit uncomfortable because i\ndon't really remember how to speak the\nlanguage\nbut my brain will sort of start working\nfor me and will start to activate and it\nactually gets really really easy\nfor me to relearn language and so i it\nmay i may think that it'll take me three\nmonths to learn the language but it\nactually turns out that after about a\nweek like my anxiety is way better i've\nlearned a lot\na lot i may not be 100 back to 100 after\na week but it actually gets\nit gets far easier and is far better\nthan i expected it to be\nso this is basically what i found in\nterms of reintegration anxiety\num you know just to kind of summarize\nwhen we started covid people were really\nisolated and depressed and\nreally wanted to get back and socialize\nand like go back to school and live a\nnormal life\nand now something really weird is\nhappening which is that like as we're on\nthe cusp of hopefully starting to\nlive a normal life again delta variant\naside\nwhat we actually find is that people\nhave a lot of difficulty reintegrating\ninto society\nthey're concerned about being able to\ncut it in school they're concerned about\nlike\nyou know socializing and feeling dumb\nand feeling out of practice\nand things like that and the good news\nis that it's actually seems to be\nsomewhat solvable\nthe other thing that i want to let\npeople know is that this appears to be a\nrelatively normal and shared experience\nfor most of society\nso it seems like you know most of the\nuniversity students that i work with are\nexperiencing something about\nsomething like this and the good news is\nthat you know\nyou may be kind of anxious\nin terms of like socially integrating\nwith people\nand it it turns out that they're anxious\ntoo so one of the tips that i'll give\nthe you know like my university students\nis actually to tell people be like hey\ni've been cooped up for a year\nand i'm actually looking forward to like\nmaking new friends\nlike if you meet like a group of people\nright you can say hey i'm looking\nforward to making new friends\ni'm curious like how other people feel\nabout that\nand what i actually find is it's like\nincredibly relieving to everyone in the\ngroup when one person says that because\nwe're all in the same boat and all it\ntakes is like one person\nto like you know crack the damn a little\nbit and then everyone's super relieved\nthey're like yeah man like absolutely\nlet's hang out\nand all you have to do is kind of take\nthat first step and then like\nit's actually really easy to kind of get\neveryone on the same page and people\nseem to be excited\nthey're anxious they don't know if you\nwant to be friends with them right like\nno one knows everyone's like oh my god i\nwant friends but i don't know if this\nperson wants to be friends with me\nam i too weird have i been like enclosed\nin my room too long is it like awkward\ndo people not like me anymore\nthis is what reintegration anxiety is\nand as you kind of bring awareness to it\nit turns out that actually like it gets\nbetter like way faster than\nyou may have thought so the first thing\nis you know as covet is ending if you if\nyou guys have been like\nisolated and like wanting to get back\ninto society\nit's completely normal to feel a little\nbit confused about that\nand like be surprised by oh i really\nwant to make friends but i feel like\nreally anxious and i feel like people\nmay think i'm stupid or i've gotten\nrusty\nthere's probably a neuroscience reason\nfor that it's probably because you have\ncircuits in your brain that\nnormally are able to reassure you and\nsort of can't right now because they've\ngotten kind of like they've turned off\nthey'll turn back on but it may be a\nlittle bit\npainful for you to tolerate that anxiety\nand it does seem to get better\nschool is sort of also seems to be kind\nof that way\nbut jury's a little bit out there\nbecause now we're into the summer so\nmost people aren't in active school\nbut for the people who have reintegrated\nand like sort of started school back in\nmarch or april some places started\nin person classes then i noticed that\npeople also had reintegration anxiety\nand it kind of got better\nyeah so someone's asking what if you had\nsocial anxiety before\nand it's worse now during covid i think\ni've seen the same thing\nso the reason it's worse as far as i can\ntell is because like we've gotten rusty\nsocially\nso what i've seen in in my patients with\nsocial anxiety\nis that they've gone back to their\npre-covered state and actually like i'd\nsay\nmaybe a third of them have actually\ngotten better like\npost covet it's kind of weird i don't\nunderstand that myself but like a third\npeople seem to be\nbetter than their baseline what about\noverall confidence i don't feel like\ni've lost social skills as much as\nconfidence so this is a great\nquestion because that's exactly how it\nmanifests\nso you don't if you think about what is\nthe nature\nof confidence in your mind what circuits\nin your brain\nlead you to confidence and so what what\ni found is actually that like\na lot of our confidence comes from sort\nof\nmirroring from the outside world right\nso when i walk into a room and\neveryone's like\nyay dr k is here\nthat's gonna help me feel a little bit\nmore confident so those are the kinds of\nsignals that we haven't gotten right we\nhaven't gotten reinforcement\nin our ability to feel confident about\nourselves and so in the absence of that\nreinforcement\nthis reintegration anxiety manifests as\na lack of subjectively feeling confident\nthe good news is that for people who\nseem to lack that confidence\nas they integrate just they kind of have\nto understand that you're going to feel\npretty anxious but just show up\nand it seems to get better relatively\nquickly\nso this is when someone says so it will\njust get better i know it sounds\nshocking\nbut that has largely been our experience\nso when it'll just get better\nif you expose yourself to social\nsituations\nright if you go into situations and you\nstart talking to people\nyou start hanging out with people if you\nsee facial expressions in body language\nthen chances are this will start to go\naway or will be at like a pre-covered\nbass line\nso someone's asking aspiring lawn lawn\nclippings is asking\ni quit my study how will it not spiral\nin a gap year\nso if you have a gap year and you quit\nstudying there's a decent chance it will\nspiral\nunless you have like a good amount of\nstructure or something to kind of\nreplace it with\nso you got to be careful about taking\ngap years because sometimes people do\nspiral right like when it comes to a gap\nyear\nsome people like really flounder in the\nlack of structure and some people can\nreally like\nsome people take a break and really\nenjoy it and they sort of view it as a\nvacation\nother people will use it as like uh you\nknow an opportunity to like learn skills\nor projects and just like\ngrow in a space outside of school\nother people will actually spiral and\ngap years so it's absolutely something\nyou need to be\ncareful about um\nsomeone's asking how fast do you unrust\nhonestly i say it gets like 50\nbetter in a week that's what i've seen\nand like in two weeks you're like 80\nthere and then maybe in a month you're\nlike back to normal\nso oxymoron indeed asks what if it\ndoesn't go away even after trying to\nreintegrate\nthat is the anxiety you guys see that\nwhat if\nwhat if it doesn't get better oh my god\nbut like what if it does then it's a\nnon-issue so this is the nature of\nanxiety so people are like what if it\ndoesn't get better\nthat is a product of the anxiety\nyou guys see that like it's a completely\nnormal thought\nbut i can answer that question then i'll\nsay well then there's a decent chance\nthat you\nthis will happen and then your anxiety\nwill say but what if that doesn't work\nand what if that doesn't work and what\nif that doesn't work your anxiety will\nany reassurance that i give you your\nanxiety will find\nsomething else to be anxious about right\nbecause reassurance doesn't actually\nhelp that much with anxiety\nso as long as the root of the anxiety is\nthere you're gonna\nfind some way to be concerned about a\nwhat-if in the future\nand this is the really tricky thing\nabout anxiety because anxiety says\nwhat if that doesn't work and then as\nlong as that thought is there\ndo you actually take that first step so\nthis person is asking what if it\nwhat if my anxiety doesn't go away after\nreintegrating\nand so as long as that that thought is\nthere will you try to reintegrate\nand this is why anxiety controls your\nlife this is why anxiety can be so\ncrippling\nbecause it's so worried it wants a\ncomplete solution\nbefore you take the first step and so\nthis is why you're stuck because there's\nlike there's no way\ni can give you a hundred percent\nguarantee that everything will work out\nand if you're waiting for that one\nhundred percent guarantee for the last\nthing\nto happen before you take the first step\nthen your\nlife will be controlled by anxiety"
