    "transcript": "i could have been stronger i could have\nstood up for myself\nyep right so like like any time i try to\nblame her\nyou're gonna say like i should have been\nstronger\nlike you're gonna protect her by blaming\nyourself\nand so can you start by just telling me\num what i should call you today or what\nyou go by\nyou can just call me by my name gabriel\ni think i'd actually prefer that because\nit's gonna feel a bit more personal if\nyou don't mind okay sure\nso gabriel and what did you want to talk\nabout today\nso there's a few things uh i wanted to\nyou know uh introduce you to my past a\nlittle bit so to speak because i think\nit's gonna be helpful i'm a very open\nperson so\ni don't really have an issue talking\nabout the\nthe [ __ ] i went through pretty much okay\nand\nuh something really good is happening to\nme actually i\nhad some pretty severe social anxiety it\nwas\nvery bad pretty much and i came across\nyour content like two months ago\nand your stuff and the interviews i\nwatched so many of them by now that\nit has helped me so much like the\nmeditations the alternate nostril\nbreathing\nlike i'm doing a lot of stuff and it's\nbeing very helpful and\nsenior stuff actually convinced me to\nsee a therapist as well because i was\nvery resistant for years and years i was\nlike\nyou know i always had that feeling of if\nthere's something wrong with me\nand i can't fix it myself then no one\ncan and i was just like\ni'm not gonna go see a therapist like\n[ __ ] up it's not useful i had that\nkind of mentality pretty much and\ni saw your stuff in our cycle this guy's\na therapist he's pretty cool i guess\nyou know i'm gonna try at least and so\ni'm seeing this therapist that's\nactually\na friend of my family and it's been\ngreat we we clicked\nso it's nice and it's part of the topic\nfrom today\ni've dealt a lot with my anxiety and\nit's a lot better\nand then i'm noticing that underneath it\nthere's like this layer of\nwhat i call depression it may or may not\nbe i don't actually have a diagnosis to\nbe honest\nbut you know for the longest time i\nthought i didn't do things\njust because i was anxious and then more\nand more i lowered my anxiety\ni noticed that there's something lying\nunderneath\nthat's like a total lack of motivation\nfocus concentration it's\nyou know i just don't have that impulse\ni kind of don't want to call it an\nimpulse because it kind of has a bad\nconnotation to it but i don't have the\nimpulse to do the things that\ni know i want to so i can rationalize\nthat i want to do something\nbut it's like my body doesn't respond in\na way\nand my senses also feel very numb it's\nlike\nit's gonna sound weird to put it this\nway but i'm very into philosophy so\nbear with me here uh it's like i see\nthings but i don't perceive them and\nit's like i hear\nthings but i don't comprehend them and\nit's like i touch things and i do not\nfeel them\nthat's kind of it\ngabriel dude you're a poet my friend\nthank you i actually wrote a lot of\npoetry during high school i mean\nyeah i know i mean you certainly have a\nway with words i think you captured\nthe resistance to see the a therapist\nand honestly the best way i've ever\nheard\nthank you which is which is that i i\nmean the scent of it was perfect it's\nlike\nif i can't fix it no one can fix it\nright it's so weird\nit's like this kind of weird\nself-reliance that like i should be able\nto do\nthis and if i can't do this there's\nsomething wrong with me\nand if there's something wrong with me\nno one outside of me is going to be able\nto fix it right\nit exactly and yeah because as human\nbeings\nstarted to interrupt i didn't notice you\nwere going to keep talking sorry here we\ngo\nas human beings we are so like unique\nand have so much individuality\nand we like notice things on such a big\nscale that the problem can like feel so\nhuge to us and you're like yeah nobody's\nfacing this there's no way\nyeah absolutely um\nlet me just\num so let's start with your past then\ngabriel so maybe we can help you kind of\nunpack things understand\nwhat's underneath by all means be\nphilosophical bro\nthank you thank you um yeah i think\nthat's a good place to start as well\nyou know my first therapy session that's\nbasically what i unloaded into my\ntherapist that's the word i used right\ni didn't tell them i unloaded like all\nof my past and that\ntook like one and a half hour to two\nhours don't worry i'm not gonna do the\nsame here because it's very enough time\nbut\nuh basically you know\nuh my father was very nice he was pretty\nyou know he was that type of\nintimidating guy that liked to\nwin over people by being intimidating\nand\nforcing them to agree with him in a way\nso he was a very oppressive\npresence around the house and\nwhere do i even start like sometimes he\nwould get home drunk and he would beat\nme for no reason so\nthat was a lot of fun i remember\nspecifically at this one time i was just\nsitting in the couch watching dbz and he\njust like he just\nwalks in and he i was like you get five\nor six five before\nhe just walks in and he's like straight\nup he's just holding me\nup like one leg in the air it's just\nlike\nbeating my hands and here and\nif i try to remember how i felt like i'm\nnot even sure i was just like\ni'm not even sure i knew what was going\non i just kept staring at the tv i just\nkept watching\ni was like i don't know what's going on\nand he had a bunch of friends with him\nas well\ni heard them laughing that kind of\nhappened but\ni think you know my child mind made it a\npoint to not look around\nbecause you know i didn't want to see\nthe people that were laughing at me it\nwas just like\nyou know i'm just going to stare at the\ntv i'm not going to look around\nkind of like you you maybe were seeing\nbut not perceiving\nyeah i never thought of it that way\nactually but\nyeah absolutely absolutely and so i\ndon't know how many times he will do\nthat my memory gets kind of foggy i\nthink it's\nsort of a protection mechanism maybe\nsome things i\ncan't really remember well so uh he was\nvery like that\nthere would be a lot of arguments in\nthat house and a lot of screaming and he\ndidn't get along well with his brothers\nas well like\nsometimes they would pull knives on each\nother like troll drawers at each other\nsome real [ __ ] up [ __ ] actually at\nthis one time my father was out\nin the garage so the way that house is\nset up is kind of like\nthere's a staircase for you to go inside\nand that staircase\nwhen you go down it garages and\nlike there's a window it's kind of hard\nto explain but basically um\nmy father and my uncle were having an\nargument through this window\nyou know one down into the garage and\nthe other one you know up\nnear the kitchen area and like they just\nstraight up take a [ __ ] drawer and\nchuck it through the window there's\nglass everywhere straight up trying to\nmurder each other in a way\nbut they never did they're both still\nalive\nso that kind of thing would happen a lot\nand\nmy father also wasn't a fan of my\nexpressive outgoing extroverted\npersonality because\nhe's the type of guy that has that\nmentality that a man should be serious\nand you know stone-faced\nyou know it's not supposed to have a lot\nof feelings or\nno i was a little fried firecracker i'm\nvery energetic so i would be jumping up\nand down sometimes i'd be running around\nthousands\nyou know my father was having none of\nthat [ __ ] pretty much\nso he wasn't very happy about it he was\nalso\nyou know he had a lot of i don't even\nknow how to say this but basically he\nwas homophobic\nbecause i behaved it that i behaved that\nway he believed that meant that i was\ngay\nyou know because i was very expressive\nand all that kind of thing\nand so he would say things like you know\ni'm not going to raise no gay son and\nall the classic stuff and so he\nreally like tried to beat that my\npersonality out of me because he didn't\nlike it and\nhe thought it meant that i was fruity\nand all kinds of things so it wasn't\nvery fun\nbeing around him and basically what\nhappened was\nyou know i guess it's pretty obvious\nfrom everything that's going on there\nwould be a divorce when i was like six\nuh he and my mom got separated and\ni remember feeling very confused at the\ntime because i didn't know who i wanted\nto stay with and it wasn't actually\nbecause of my father because\nat my father's house he lived together\nwith my grandma his mother\nand one of my uncles that i really liked\nhis brother\nbecause we would play a lot of games\ntogether it's like uh his room would be\na safe haven for me i would just walk in\nthere and\nstart playing especially because my\nfather\nalong with with this brother than my\nuncle he wouldn't like interject\nvery much on what we were doing inside\nhis room so\nyes he was just like i don't want to\ntalk to this guy so\nwhatever so i liked my grandma\nquite a bit so i was very confused on\nwhere i wanted to stay and i would\nlike live four months and with my mother\nand then four months with my grandma and\nmy uncle and at the time my father was\ngetting\nuh busy doing uh nurse stuff because\nhe's always been into medicine that's\nsomething he wanted me to do he was like\nyou know he noticed that i was very\nsmart from the young age and he was like\ni'm gonna mold you into this thing\nbut just very annoying type of thing\nwhere he was like um\ni never managed to be a doctor but now\nbecause i [ __ ] up you're gonna be a\ndoctor if you're gonna be like this\nblah blah blah all that kind of stuff\neventually i would settle on uh living\nwith my mother because\nmy grandma and uncle also started being\nquite unpleasant\ni want to say in the beginning it was\ncool and then\nthey started criticizing my mother a lot\nsaying things like she was misusing the\nchild support money that she should be\nbuying\nclothes and you know main courses for me\nto learn [ __ ] but there you know the\nreality\nof the matter is you know i was kind of\nbored into\npoverty here in brazil and so\nthat child support money she had used to\npay rent and i would always explain it\nto them like\nyou know what do you expect you want me\nyou want her to buy me clothes\nthen we're just going to sleep under a\nbridge or something that doesn't make\n[ __ ] sense\nso they would criticize her unfairly\nbecause they were just like\nit wasn't fair at all just unfair\ncriticism very much\nmy uncle was becoming more and more\nbitter i don't know what was going on\nwith him at the time\nand my grandma she like spoiled me way\ntoo much so it's like\ntotal contrast between my father and my\ngrandma where\nmy father would have a totally\noppressive aura about him and those\nthings he wanted me to do that i was\ngonna do\nand then my grandma on the other hand he\nwas she was too far\nyou know on the other end so for example\ni remember going to a preschool and it\nwas on the same street\nactually the same street where this\nhouse was the preschool was just like\nright across the street and all you know\nit's like that either you had one job\nshe had one job that was to uh wake me\nup at like\n6am or something for me to get ready and\nshe'd be like\noh i tried to wake you up but you you\nweren't waking up so\nyou know just i i felt bad so\nand so i would miss a lot of school days\nbecause of it she like she felt bad\nwaking up to go to\npreschool or whatever you know six\nand something that was very bad that\nused to happen while i was living there\ntoo\nand in this period where i kept going\nback and forth\nwas actually there would be nobody\naround the house for the most part so i\nwould stay in there alone all day\nbecause my father and my grandma would\nbe working all day and i can't remember\nwhat my uncle was doing for some reason\nbut\nshe also would not be home so i would\nstay home alone all day\nand i wasn't allowed to go outside with\nother kids so i didn't have any friends\nat that point\nand i would also like may start uh\nstarve a fair bit because you know i was\nall alone in the house i had nothing to\neat\nand so here comes you know another part\nof my grandma\nspoiled things that weren't very faces\nshe would come home\nafter a day where i you know didn't have\nanything to eat\nand she would offer me like cookies and\nstuff like that it's like\nthat's not what you should be giving me\nand i was no too young to know any\nbetter but anyways\neventually that would cause me to\nactually have some sort of uh\nissue with my eating i'm not sure what\nit was no i was too young to actually\npay attention\nbut that's gonna tie into later\nwhen i'm living with my mother\nconsistently and i never protect her\nto live at least i did some visits\nand unfortunately she would have this\nguy come over to liverpool who would\nbecome my stepfather he\nwould also be abusive to me in a similar\nmanner to my father\nand you know it's in some points he was\nworse than some he was better so\npeople are different even interviews\nright the\nindividuality of humanity\nand i remember specifically i\nended up having these stomach issues and\nthat was one of his biggest like\nproblems with me because uh\ni would go you know have breakfast uh\nat the the kitchen desk or whatever you\ncall it english\nand i'd sit there like for three hours\ntrying to eat a loaf of bread like it\nwas really hard for me i was having some\nreal\nand he would get so mad over that [ __ ]\nactually\nso just one time and\na fair warning chat if you have a weeks\nor if you're having lunch right now just\njust stop for a bit uh i was trying to\nhave my lunch and i would stay basically\nall day\nbecause my mother would be working she\nwas the provider and\nhe would take care of me\nuh i was having lunch and i just\ncouldn't eat i\nate like two spoons of it and i just\ncouldn't eat anymore\nso he forced me to eat more and that\ncaused me to\nvomit all over the plate and then if\nthat wasn't bad enough he also made me\neat a spoonful of the vomit that i just\nyou know so that wasn't very nice either\nit's one of the more uh things that\nmarked me that i can remember about that\ntime because i'm sure there were\nall other kinds of [ __ ] that he would do\nto me but my memory just\nit's like i said i think it's maybe a\nprotective thing i don't know because i\ncan't remember much else but\nuh the feeling was very bad it was like\nmy mother is going to work she was the\nonly\nfamily member that was fair and kind to\nme but she would also\ninstill some you know maturity like my\ngrandma\nso like my mother was the the star of my\nmy world standpoint so\nshe would leave and i would be alone\nwith my stepfather and was like well\ni guess now i know i'm alone with this\nguy maybe i'll eat my vomit today again\nyou know\nwho knows what's gonna happen so\nsounds like it would be important for\nyou to eat it but not taste it\nyou're good\ni never thought about it like that\neither so\nyeah and it was rough for my mother too\nshe actually ended up\ndeveloping depression over the years\nliving with this guy because\nyou know she will tell him to [ __ ] off\nand leave the house because she didn't\nwant him leaving\nus anymore and he just would not do it\nfor like\nthree or four years she would keep\ntelling him to go away and he just\nwouldn't\nbecause you know it was a free easy life\nfor him he didn't have to work\nmy mother was providing for everything\nand when we\npicked him up so to speak uh his father\nhad just like\nthrown him out of her house because he\nrefused to get a job he just did drugs\nall day\nor whatever and so his mother was very\npissed at him and\nthrew him on his house and my mother\ntook him up\nyou know my mother is a very kind person\nshe would eventually fall in love with\nhim and all that stuff\nin the beginning he wasn't so bad he\njust he transformed into a total [ __ ]\ndick over the years and said\nso like at first he was that kind of guy\nyou wouldn't look twice at it's like\nyou know just normal but eventually that\nwould cause problems so she would fall\ninto depression keep telling him to\nleave her home he wouldn't\neventually he did but at that point i'd\nsay a lot of damage had\nhad been done to me already sounds like\nyeah he had a similar thing to my father\nwhere\nhe would also call me gay and all kind\nof stuff because of the way i just stick\nwith a lot and talk you know and all\ntypes of things\nand like sometimes i wonder like if i\nwas actually homosexual how hard it\nwould be\nbecause i'm not even then these things\nyou know still affected me like imagine\nif i actually was\ni think i'd have a lot more trouble too\nbut\nyeah part of the sad thing about this is\nmy uncle would get in on it\nmy mother's brother in this case not\nfrom the family of my father\nso this uncle of mine uh brother to my\nmother was also getting you know\nmaking fun of me for acting and moving\nthe way i did\nbut all that kind of good stuff so they\njust kind of would come in here\nand basically leech of homeowners work\nbecause they would turn on the computers\nand use the internet to play like\ngrand chase at the time it was a level\nup game or whatever\nand you know while they were doing that\nthey would take the opportunity to rip\non me and\nall kinds of [ __ ] you're talking about\nyour your uncle and your stepdad\nyeah okay okay they will join forces\na malevolent force\nokay so\nthat was kind of what family life was\nfor me i was always very oppressed for\nbeing too well going too loud too\nextroverted\ni was like damn i should have been born\ninto a italian family nobody would have\nhad an issue with me but\nyou know that wasn't the case in fact\nuh so my cousin sorry there's some\nloud thing going on in my street right\nnow i hope that doesn't bother you but\ni don't hear anything actually okay\nthat's good\nthat's good i'm super like conscious\nabout the noise because i'm using a\nphone as a mice\na lot of things get picked up uh\nwhat was i saying i have a lot of mind\nby the way you can tell\ni think that's what they mistook for\nhomosexuality\num yeah so can you just tell me a little\nbit so it sounds like you gave us a\nlittle bit about your upbringing\nand um can you tell us a little bit\nabout the social anxiety\nyeah so i think it's connected like i've\nmade a lot of observations\nuh myself along the the years and part\nof my\nannoyance at myself is that i knew so\nmuch about the roots of my issues but i\ncould never solve anything\nand that's like without a lot of your\ncontent has provided me like\nways to deal with it because i've always\nbeen very good at noticing so the whole\nsocial anxiety thing is like\ni i definitely see it as you know my\nnatural personality that was so\noppressed by my family and then\neventually it would become oppression\nduring the repression because\ni would take those ideas that i should\nnot be that way and i wouldn't implement\nand internalize\nthem so school wasn't easy for me either\ni was always bullied a lot and i didn't\nhave a lot of friends so like i was\n[ __ ] at home i was [ __ ] at school\nlike ironically the place i felt the\nsafest\nwas the streets between my home and\nbetween the schools like\nin the streets i'm the safest so\ni got bullied a lot too for being 12\ngoalie uh\nthe kids used to call me [ __ ]\nbecause like i was always laughing too\nmuch and making too many jokes\nso that would happen as well and i\nremembered that i had to specific\nduring the elementary at some point\nwhere i was like you know i'm gonna turn\nmyself into a machine\nso like that was my goal i was like i'm\ngonna take all these things that people\nare saying you know\npeople pick on me for and i'm gonna just\nshove it all inside\nlike it's not gonna come out and people\ni'm not gonna be a target\nanymore that's kind of how i learned to\ndeal with it\nand what would happen eventually is that\n2013 or 2014\nafter going through a long process of\nshoving all the [ __ ] inside\ni would have my first panic attack which\ni see you know as those things coming\nout because whenever you repress\nsomething it's gonna blow off in a\ncertain way so i ended up having these\npanic attacks\nand part of the social anxiety issues\nthat i was having is connected to all\nthis\nin the sense that uh you know probably\nbecause of what i was taught and how i\ninternalize things if um\nif i go in and i talk to people and i'll\nbe myself\npeople are gonna make fun pretty much so\nthat would cause me anxiety\nbecause then what i would do is you know\ni would put on the mask on like so much\nof us do it's like i can't let that come\nout so\ni'm gonna put on this mask on and the\nproblem with putting masks\nis that it's like an eagle thing that\nstrives for perfection so you know i'm\ngoing to go into the social\nsituation and i'm going to act\nmathematically in a\nspecific way and so people aren't going\nto see the real me\nyeah hopefully they're you know not\ngoing to make fun of the mask and i was\npretty good at it too\nand when you have that perfectionism\nof having to put on the mask and what\nthat ego and all that\n[ __ ] jumble together that causes a lot\nof anxiety because you get\nlike performance anxiety right it's\nalmost like you're going on a stage\nit's like i have to you know do this so\nthat's my understanding\nand so tell me a little bit about it\nsounds like the the\nsocial anxiety has gotten better\nyeah it has gone so much better you have\nno idea like\na lot of it is thanks to you the\nmeditation the\nso much it's been amazing yeah you're\ni'm glad things worked out for you it's\nkind of you know it's weird gabriel like\ni was thinking one of the downsides of\nstreaming is that i never\nget to follow up with people right\nand and so it's kind of interesting i\nnever had this thought until now so i\nwas thinking that part of the problem\nwith streaming\nis i can never show people step two i\njust keep showing step one\nover and over and over again but there's\nsomething strange that's happened over\nthe last week and hearing you\ntalk about it uh hearing you kind of\nshare because like you're already giving\nme\neverything like you're packaged in a\nsense like in a good way right like so\ni think you've like figured out and so\nlike in in about 15 minutes\n20 minutes you're able to do a lot of\nwhat takes\nwe normally spend an hour and a half on\ndoing so the interesting thing is like\nwe may actually be able to take step two\ntoday\num which i never normally i take step\ntwo with the same person because we you\nknow we meet for a couple of weeks and\nstuff like that but\ni think there are potentially like other\nconcepts or advanced concepts that i\nnever thought i would get to\non stream because everyone um\nyou know but it sounds like you all are\nlearning\nand so that's pretty cool um\nbut let's kind of talk a little bit\nabout uh\nyou know so after as the social anxiety\nhas gotten better what have you managed\nto uncover instead\num like there was just\nit's like i said i don't actually have a\ndiagnosis but it feels a lot like\ndepression or at least aspects of it\nin the sense that my understanding of it\nis\nmaybe i'm wrong my understanding of it\nis i've been depressed this entire time\nbut i didn't realize it anymore because\nmy anxiety was like at\nsuch a peak so if my depression is here\nmy anxiety was like here\nand so like my anxiety was just so loud\nand deafening that i could not notice\nthe depression anymore and as i'm\ni'm noticing that down here there's\nstill like a big issue where\ni it's like i was saying it like my\ncognitive functions are just\nnot okay it's very hard for me to\nactually focus and learn things that\ni used to be very good at and there's no\nmotivation to do things\nit's like i'm detached from reality in a\nsense like it's not\ni don't feel like i'm a part of my room\nright now for example it feels very\nweird\nbecause back when i used to be mentally\nhealthy in a circumstance\ni would always feel like i was a part of\nmy environment like\nit's like things had a presence like\nit's hard to put into words but\nlike the desk i'm using right now it's\nlike this desk has a presence to it even\nthough it's not a living thing\nand i was all i would always be able to\nperceive like the presence of the\nobjects around me it's just\nlike there's nothing there everything is\nkind of a shade of gray\nand my mind is also very like scattered\nand foggy\nsometimes i'll have like good thoughts\nbecause like i i'm planning on actually\nstarting a philosophy\nchannel and writing a book and actually\nthose are things that i want to do\nand sometimes i'll have a thought that's\nlike oh that's good so i record it to my\nphone\nand i'll take my phone to record it and\ni'll press record and then\nit's like between my mind and my mouth\nlike things just get lost sometimes\nit's disappears in the midst it's very\nhard to explain\nokay so what are some of the other\nthings that you've noticed\nhave come up as the anxiety has gotten\nbetter\nthat sounds pretty hard so why do you\ncall it depression\nwell it's kind of like because of a\nthing i used to feel before so i gotta\nfeel you feel your wind on this actually\nuh i was playing actually competitive\ndaughter for a while\ni mean like 2014 to totally something\nso what happened was uh my cousin\nintroduced me to\nthe end of 2013 and that was during my\nhigh school periods where\nyou know i didn't have any friends and i\nkind of hated everyone i had a big ego\nat the time i was like\nyou know all these people they're just\nstupid i'm not gonna associate with any\nof them\nwhich was also a defense mechanism at\nthe time because you know\npeople always rejected me so my thought\nprocess was if i reject them first and\nthey can't do it\nso i would just like disqualify and you\nknow\nlower everyone in my mind so that you\nknow i'm the one rejecting all of you\nnow\nsuckers so i didn't have a whole lot of\nfriends with that attitude obviously\ni just gave to myself so i was playing\ndota and through dota like i was amazed\ni fell in love with the game because\ni've always been very good at games\nactually and i was picking up the game\nso fast and learning so fast and i\ndidn't even know if esports at the time\nlike i had no idea that was a thing\nactually\nso i would see an art easy screen event\nand like\nhe had like 10k viewers and he was\nplaying the whole chat was vlogging and\ni was like\nwait people liked us a lot i had no idea\nwhat's going on here\nand when i would watch dota tournaments\nit was back when zyrie had like\ndreads or whatever and i thought that\nwas so cool i was like man\nyou know that guy's working like that\nit's like it felt to me like a community\nwhere you could really be yourself\nis what i'm trying to say like that guy\nis himself he's being himself he has\nthis haircut\nand he's doing all this cool [ __ ] so i\nalways felt like i couldn't be myself in\nthe real world\nbut in the daughter the online gaming\ncommunity i was like yeah\nand i'm gonna have value as a player and\nthen people are gonna have to pay\nattention to\nmy thought process and i was actually\ndoing very well\ni was like playing very well i'm still\nmore touring currently i don't want to\nreplay anymore\ni think i'm not like 6.3 km bar and the\nonly reason i'm giving you all these\ndetails is because i know you know about\nit\nit's gonna be helpful uh what would\nhappen unfortunately\nit was something that was absolutely so\ncrushing to me because\nthough i was pushing everybody out and\njust focusing on dota and i had a\npessimistic view about\npeople around me i i didn't feel\ndepressed at all i actually felt like\nvery obese i felt like my feelings were\njustified\nand i would embrace them like hey i\n[ __ ] hate these people i don't care\nlet's play shorter\nyou know i still felt good basically\nand that was until i had my first panic\nattack so when i was going to school\nsecond year of high school\na friend used to come here for us to go\nto school together\nand when we were approaching the the end\nof the street i just\nmy body just did something it had never\ndone before it was a very weird\nexperience so\nit's gonna be kind of hard to explain as\nthese things are but\nit felt like everything was moving like\na speedo light around me\nand at the same time nothing was moving\nit's like\neverything was moving what uh at the\nspeed of light\nokay around me it felt like the road had\njust like evolved into light speed in a\nmillisecond\nand there wasn't even anything going on\nlike the street was completely empty\nthere were no cars like there was\nnothing but\nin my mind like everything was just so\nfast and rushing and\nit felt like i could see like 10 years\ninto the future or something it was some\nreally scary [ __ ]\nand you know i told my friend to stop\nlike i couldn't even speak because i\nfelt like i'm not in my truth and i\njust you know signaled to my friend i\nwas like wait\nlike took a deep breath\nand i was like okay i think i'm okay so\nwe went to school that was the first\ntime that happened\nand what would end up happening is\nyou want to say something yeah i'm just\ntrying to figure out\nuh where so it sounds like you talked\nabout dota now you're talking about a\npanic attack\ni'm not quite sure how this relates to\n[Music]\nwhat depression feels like for you\nunderneath the anxiety\nit's about to connect sorry i know it's\na big tangent to just okay\nuh what would end up happening is i\nwould have this more and more frequently\nwhen it was time to go to school\nso eventually i just told my mother like\ni don't want to go school anymore\nbecause\nevery time i just merely think about\ngoing to school or i know that i'm going\nto have to\nlike my body my nervous system would\njust completely [ __ ] itself pretty much\nso i told her like i don't want to go\nanymore\nwork you know i'm talented just cut out\nthere for a second i don't want to go\nany more what\nyeah i don't want to go anymore because\ni felt\nreally bad just at the thought of having\nto go to school and i was telling her\nyou know i'm going to do this dota thing\ndo i know what i'm doing i'm talented\nit's gonna work so i don't need to go to\nschool anymore\nyou know all that just pretty much and\nshe actually allowed me like\nshe put her trust in me because i was\nspeaking about it very confidently and\nshe was like okay i trust you and and\nthen a terrible thing happened and this\nguy's is why you don't run away from\nyour feelings because\ni run i ran away from school because i\nwas feeling panic attacks in there\nand daughter was always completely fine\ni would get home from school\nsure and then what happened was is these\nattacks transferred over to when i had\nto play dota\nit was absolutely terrible so like i\nwould kill up press find\nmatch and divide i felt like there was a\nhand in my throat a lot of times like\nthere was something just crushing it and\ni would always just like be dry heaving\nand coughing\nand i would have to like pause in the\nmiddle of matches to run to the bathroom\nand just throw one\nthen i i would come back and keep\nstomping noobs but i would be throwing\nup\nso it's going to tie into your question\nit's about it i promise\nso well what happened was this you know\nit was a very soft rushing process to me\nbecause all i had was\nyou know i had shoved people out of my\nlife involved like\ni don't want anything to do with any of\nyou and i had a big ego of like\nyou know i was that which is good at\ndota you know\nit was my identity and like\nwhen that started getting taken away\nfrom me for something that was out of my\ncontrol like i felt so [ __ ] crushed\nit was like there's nothing left\ninvolving like for me it's\nlike this thing that's my passion and i\nlove so much and i'm doing well at it\nnow my body is breaking down and\ni can't really do it anymore so that's\nwhere i started getting depressed\nin the sense that everything just lost\nmeaning at that point\nand because you know the only thing i\nloved was taken away from\nthat sense i couldn't do anything and\nyou know i was a stubborn [ __ ] still\nat the time so i didn't go seek any help\nfrom my panic attacks or anything maybe\ni should have done that but you know\nwho knows what happened in that parallel\nuniverse but\nit everything just felt really bad and\nthat my i felt my\nemotions start to numb so like i wasn't\nreally there anymore and i would refuse\nto eat as well\ni remember this one time i'll just\nno longer eat and something very bad\nhappened because i\nwasn't really eating properly for like\ntwo days straight and\nit's like my head was spinning a lot\nevery time you moved it i couldn't\nreally walk very well\nso my mother found me i wasn't even\ngonna tell anybody it's like\ni was ready to die in a sense i was just\nsitting in my room in my bed not eating\nanything\nand i couldn't really get up very well\nanymore and i was like you know i don't\ncare\ni don't have anything so whatever and\nlike my mother opens the door to my room\nand she's like like you're okay you\nhaven't come out in a bit and\nshe comes to check on me and i just told\nher like very matter of fact\nactually i can't talk right now because\ni'm feeling this way and no no\nso like she gave me strain at the time\nshe came she held my hand\nand you know you have to snap out of it\nkind of thing\nso i started eating again and eventually\ni would recover\nbut i wouldn't really feel anything\nanymore i would be numb\nfor a very long time for maybe like\nthree years\nand then after those three years just\nbeing completely numb and be in my room\nnot doing nothing i didn't go out i\ndidn't get a job nothing like that\ndidn't get any new friends\nbut after that time of three years just\nin that deep state of what i believed to\nbe depression against little diagnosis\nuh what happened is that my anxiety\npicked up and that's what i have lived\nfor the past like\nfive years of my life just baseline\nanxiety that i told you about\nso now that i am rid of it i'm seeing\nthat maybe there's remnants of\nthat point in my life and that's why i\ncall it depression that was a very long\ntension thing\nyeah so let's we'll talk about tangents\nin a second but so so\ni'm still curious about what you\nexperience on a day-to-day basis\nthat makes you use the word depression\nthat's what happened back\nthen what do you experience today\nuh it's less what i experience and it's\nmore what i don't experience\nit's a lack of experiencing things what\nare you ignoring what do you not\nexperience today what's missing from\nyour life\ncolor connection are you\nsad no actually that's something that\nbothers me a lot\nbecause it's like i don't feel the\nemotions like i want to feel sad i want\nto cry sometimes and i just can't\nand i don't think that's normal okay\nokay so gabriel we got to talk about\ntangents for a second okay\nso now you ready for the level two\nexplanation so there yes\nyou're gonna have to be careful because\nif if if\ni if we want me to help you\ni don't need your conclusions i need the\nraw data\nso one thing that's happening right now\nthis is a double-edged sword it's\nneither better nor worse\nso on the one hand we can cover a lot of\nground but i think we're still like\nmissing a lot right so you basically\nyou've watched it's clear you've watched\nit sounds like videos so you kind of\nknow what kind of\nquestions i ask you're sort of sharing\nlike particular traumatic\nmoments um but you're kind of giving me\nthe package\nthe problem is that like if you give me\nthe package\nthe you've set up the problem in a\nparticular way\nwhere there is a answer yeah i didn't\nneed to do that\nyeah i understand so so that's that's\nwhat we're sharing it right so like no\none's done that before because\nyou did what i usually do which is fine\ni hope you're not\nit occurs to me maybe i'm shaming you\nbut like\nyeah so like i think there's because\nhonestly there is a lot of good stuff in\nthere but like i i think that\num i\ni would like it if i could ask you\nquestions and you try to stick to the\nanswer don't give me the conclusion\nbecause i'm i'm hunting for raw data\nright so like when you like i'm\nabsolutely fascinated like i have so\nmany questions for you about\nwhy sa is toxic and like why do you guys\nshow up on usc\nservers like you know\nlike i have tons of questions for you\nlove that you shared that you know you\ntried to go pro dota and\nstuff like that i i do think you're\nyou're genuinely like you're\ncreating a lot of value by offering like\nsome of the nuggets that you've learned\nlike i\nimagine that could help a lot of people\num\nbecause you certainly have a way with\nwords but if we're talking about helping\nyou\nyou know i like so my my question is\nlike you know i have some questions\nabout your upbringing like how do you\nfeel about your mom\nsee it's hard for me to know what i feel\ni have to think yep\ngood that's what i that's what we want\nright because usually when i ask you a\nquestion you'll give me like a narrative\nthat connects and has a\nyou know a finale yeah\nyeah sorry so\nuh i know it's not a very nice thing to\nfeel but we don't control her feelings\nbut\ni felt like she could have done better\nin a sense just you know\nhaving recently separated from my father\nand like going so quickly into a\nrelationship with a guy she\ndidn't know enough about i think you\nknow i would have liked if she\nput a little bit more thought into what\nthat would have done to me\nbut it's not like resentment i don't\nfeel any resentment towards sort of\nlike with like that's uh\nthe house here i live it it's me and my\nmom so you know\nwe live together we we're both there for\neach other we help and we support each\nother we have a really good relationship\nwould you allow yourself to feel\nresentment towards her\nwhen i was younger it was a lot easier i\nused to feel it a lot back in elementary\nand things like that like\nyou know like how could it\nit was like how can she allow this to\nhappen like this guy to do these things\nyou know\nand what was the answer you came up with\nthere was no answer if i'm being honest\nso how did you deal with that\njust smile you know good old fashioned\njust stuffing\nhow does it feel talking about it now\nit was kind of unfair i feel like i was\nrobbed of something\nwhat were you robbed of\ncan be something upbringing where i\ncould connect emotionally with the\nadults around me probably\nand who's who robbed you of that\nwell you could make an argument it was\nmy father first and foremost if he\nhadn't been such a dick\nin a sense you know she kind of dropped\nthe ball later as well\nno everyone has their issues okay\nso now i'm going to invite you to notice\nwhat you did when i asked you that\nquestion\nright so what was the first thing i\ndon't know if you remember because it's\nhard\nso i said who robbed you of that and\nwhat was the first thing you said\nnope technically you said you could make\nan argument\nright which means if we think about it\ndo you\nblame your father\noh i've done that i know but when i ask\nyou that question who robbed you of that\nwhat was the answer that we got\ndoes the answer indicate that you blame\nyour father\nno no what was the next thing that you\nsaid\nthat my mom dropped the ball\nand then you said something else\nyeah it was some rationalization i can't\neven remember very good\nright so like it's really interesting\nhow does it feel when we kind of unpack\nthings and like i'm\ni'm blaming your mom you feel that\nhow does it feel to have me blame your\nmom\nit doesn't feel bad actually i i think\nyou know it's reality whether we like it\nor not\nokay\nso you feel okay with me doing that\nyeah i don't mind okay\ncan i think for a second sure\nokay i should have said no damn it\nwhat are you up to nowadays\ni have some things i want but that's\nfuture so what i'm up to right now it's\nbasically just self improvement i'm\nreally trying to you know\nuh figure myself out and so i can have a\nmoral life again kind of thing\nso i watch a lot of your videos i do a\nlot of meditation i have\nbeen trying my hand at the whole uh\ndopamine detox thing because\ni don't actually feel like playing any\ngames anymore that's part of what i\nconsider depression is because it's not\njust about the games\ni actually don't feel like doing\nanything so\ndo you feel like improving\nsometimes it's very sporadic sometimes\ni'll have a day where i'm like\noh i really want to do this thing or\nreally play this game that's like\nonce every two weeks maybe\nokay um\nso we've got a couple of options gabriel\nokay\nso one option is we can kind of like in\na sense almost start from scratch i\nthink i can ask you\nquestions in a particular way\nthat will lead to maybe a\ncrack within your emotional shell\num i think we both know where those\nquestions are gonna go because we've\nseen\nyou know all of your transparency and\neven as you're thinking about it i can\nsee there's changes in the way that\nyou're sitting\nin the way that you're thinking you know\nyou've had a smile on your face for a\nwhile and sometimes as we get close to\nsomething like you haven't needed to\ndeflect\nmuch right but there are like very few\ntimes where you'll\nyou'll deflect you'll block right\nbecause\nlike it sounds like a and and we you\nknow we can talk about that if you want\nto\num we'll see i i think you are\nwell defended so i don't i don't know\nthat that's actually the best use of our\ntime but if that's what you want if you\nwant to like cry on stream we can try to\nhelp you get there\nokay i think you are quite intellectual\nand there are other things going on on\nhere which\ni i'm i'm almost inclined to\nmeet you on an intellectual level which\nis very different from what i would do\nin therapy but i think like we're here\nto teach really more than to do therapy\nso i think that there are like a lot of\nimportant principles or lessons to be\nlearned because this is actually a\ni'm kind of offering this today because\nit's a rare opportunity where someone\ncomes in\nand has already understood so much of\nwhat we usually do\nso it gives us a unique opportunity but\ni think for you\nyou know some people come on here and\nthey have this kind of like emotional\ncatharsis and then they like start to\nmake changes in their life and it's like\ni just got a dm this morning from\nsomeone you they were being really nice\na prior stream guest that was like hey i\njust wanted to say i've like\nbenefited a lot and like i'm realizing\nthings in a new way like\ni don't i don't know that if we go the\nsort of academic or intellectual route\ni don't know how much it will actually\nhelp you as a person\ni think it'll be very intellectually\nsatisfying but like would you like to\nunderstand yourself from a high level\nor would you like to like feel yourself\non an instinctive level like what do you\nwant definitely\ndefinitely what i'm missing is the\nfeeling and i like that you used\ninstinctive because\nthat's always like how i've been\navoiding like very connected to the\nthe animal side of the human being let's\nsay where\ni've always felt things very strongly\ninstinctively and now i don't feel them\nanymore so that's where all it sounds\ntells you okay that's gonna be tough so\nlet me think about this\nokay i may wind up going the\nintellectual route anyway\nall right it's your show\nyeah no let me just give me a second\nokay\noh [ __ ] hold on\nwhen was the last time that you did feel\na lot\noh long ago holy [ __ ] it's gonna be hard\nto remember\nprobably back then because i considered\n2014 the year i died in a certain sense\nbecause\nthat was when i was having the panic\nattacks in total and from that point\nonwards i remember specifically\nfor some reason i don't know why uh\naugust of 2014\ni'm not sure what's up with that date\nbut i remember that from there\nonwards i haven't felt a whole lot\nokay so it's like five years give or\ntake maybe\nwhen you think about the traumatic stuff\nthat happens to you\nthat happened to you do you feel any\nemotion\nno it's because it's it's why i joke\nabout it i'm not really feeling anything\ntoo\ndramatic\nit may be just part of my personality\ntoo because i have that kind of\npersonality where i'll make fun of\nserious [ __ ] and i have offended people\nin the past let me answer\ncan you tell me about writing poetry\nyeah actually this this is going to be a\nlittle bit embarrassing\nso i used to fall in love very easily\nduring my school years\nand a lot of the poetry i would write\nwould like be specific for a girl i was\nin love with at the time\nand i would like show it to her and\nshe'd be like that's [ __ ] stupid\ncountry\nbecause you know at least like you know\npublic schools in\nlower income areas in brazil it's a\nrough crowd\ni'll say that much there were kids that\nwith problems probably worse than mine\nin a sense so people weren't very happy\nwith the kind of\nyou know very happy with me in a sense\nbecause i was too happy and like a world\nboy three about love\nand and what do you\nhow how long has it been since you've\nfallen in love\noh it's been a long time as well and\ni i had some like in cell issues for a\nwhile in the sense that\nyou know i've never been reciprocated so\nyou know for a while there\nit's been a long time maybe seven or\neight years where\nyou know i actually blame the women and\nall that stuff but\nit's not like that anymore i realized\nthat i was at fault at the time because\ni kept constantly trying to fill in a\nhole that i handed me by\nyou know acquiring partners so to speak\nso i know it was completely my fault but\nit's been\nwe're in 2021 maybe four years\nokay\nhow do you feel about yourself\nuh i feel like i am capable of a lot of\nthings\nand it frustrates me that i did not\nhow does it feel to be someone who is\nincapable\nof doing what you're capable of\nfeels very weak uh cowardice\nin a sense also\nmaybe\nuh some resentment towards myself too\ncan you feel that resentment\nyeah it's liking my stomach right now\nokay and what do you feel in your\nstomach\nit's gotten heavy on and over\nokay\nwhat do you wish you were\nis gonna sound like some philosophical\n[ __ ] but they in their meet that i\nknow that i am\nwhat's it like to not have access to\nthat person\nvery disheartening uh\ndisappointing and also maybe\nuh rage inducing even though i don't i\ncan't feel a lot of anger\nit feels like i have anger in me\nsomewhere\nit feels that way i guess how do you\nknow you have anger in you\nit's a very instinctive thing i can't\nreally explain it\nit's like i i can kind of just tell that\nit's in there somewhere\nthat there's no logic to it okay how can\nyou tell though like\nyou know it's kind of a weird question\nbut\nit's it's sort of like like how does\nyour mind\nknow how do your neurons know to produce\nthe word\nrage inducing\ni have no idea but i but i do embody the\nconcept that we aren't just our minds so\nbut yeah it's just michael bs\nit comes like from somewhere i don't\nknow the soul\nbut that's philosophical right like so\nso like in a very\npractical sense when i ask you how you\nfeel about yourself\nright what i'm hearing is like\nthere's some like you're there's it's\nrage inducing\nlike the way that you live your life\npisses you off\nyeah because i've had this thing of kind\nof seeing myself in the third person for\na very long time and it's like i'm\nwatching myself\nruin my life by inaction and it's\nit's raging basic and what are you doing\nabout ruining your life like you can see\neverything\ngabriel what are you doing about it\nwell i'm trying very hard i'm watching\nvideos i'm seeing a therapist\nbut it's like\nthey're but it's it's a yeah it's as you\nsaid there's something missing i don't\nknow what it is\nexactly what's missing\nme yeah more importantly whose fault is\nit that it's missing\nwho's responsible for finding it\ndefinitely me and how does it feel to\nhave\nnot found it yet\nvery frustrating it's like it's why i\ngave in a little i tried for so many\nyears and then i'm like you know i'm\nfinally gonna see a therapist because i\nwas trying really hard to do that\nand i had a lot of pride about that as\nwell like i'm a smart\ni could figure this off so i had a lot\nof broadband how do you feel about\nseeing a therapist\nit's been great but i absolutely agree\ndo you feel weak\nyes because back then when i was\nyou know when i shoved people aside and\ni had a big eagle\nand all that i felt very strong i wasn't\nlike\ni didn't like pick on other people or\nintimidate them but i would always stand\nup for myself i was a strong guy and\nwhere people would always like be lazy\nor falter like yeah i'm not going to do\nthis like i would go and do it i\njust have so much presence to me and\nnone of it is here anymore that's what\nmakes me feel weak it's like i have no\npresence\nand i know it is my fault because i made\nit a point to\ndisappear with my presence because it\nwas making people make fun of me\nsounds like you screwed up gabriel yeah\na lot is that what you feel like\na screw-up\nyeah that's in there alright\nit's like i'm in such a good position\ntoo uh\nyou know my mother is taking care of all\nthe the financial [ __ ]\nshe she's like she's doing so well like\nit's that thing to where i saw you talk\nabout in one of your interviews when you\ndon't have to do something it's you know\nharder to get yourself to do it because\non a financial stand gabriel do you feel\nlike a deadbeat\nyou know what that term means\nyeah i know what it means but i won't go\nthat far okay\nhow far would you go\num someone who's\nvery actively wasting their time i don't\nknow like what word i would use\nactively\nlet me see if i understand you here so\nit sounds like you know you get an a for\neffort but certainly not an a for\nresults\nyeah pretty much\nso is that something that feels distant\nfrom you\nthat feeling\ni would say so yeah everything is just\nso numb the negative the positive it's\nlike\nit's all equally hard to get to yeah\nso here's what i think is going on i\nthink we got close\num i i i don't know so this is the kind\nof thing where like i think i could\nbludgeon you\ninto emotion\nlike i could do things like i could call\nyou\nthe things that you have called yourself\nin those dark moments and i'm pretty\nsure the emotion will come\nroaring out i think a lot of stuff is\ngonna come roaring out\nlike the negative emotion is gonna come\nout\nand also like anger and hatred and like\nlike you're gonna get like you'll like\nthe ego is gonna come out\nand you'll then it's going to be me and\nyou like you're going to be in the\ngarage i'm going to be upstairs\ni'm going to pick up the drawer and i'm\ngoing to throw it through the window\nlike the emotion is there does that make\nsense\nabsolutely yes and so if we were\nactually a cult and we were\nat a retreat you know there may be some\nutility to like having that kind of deep\nemotional exploration\ni don't know that this is the time or\nthe place or that i feel comfortable\nheaping on you the abuse that it takes\nto get you to feel\noh i i would actually like to go for it\nif you're willing because\ni think that's what i need i'm not so\nsure\nthat i'm willing okay\nbecause i i don't know that that'll i\nunderstand that you're hungry for it\ni don't know that it's gonna be good for\nyou\nokay so like yeah\nwhat do you think about that\ni wasn't thinking anything i was just\ngetting a little suck\nwhy are you sad\nbut because it's like you said i feel\nlike i really need this but\nyou know\nyeah so there's something important\nthere right so like\nwhen i say that you're not gonna get it\nwhat am i sentencing you to\njust going back to my daily routine of\nyou know kind of trying to do it myself\nand it never works\nand how so like how do you feel then\nright so i i think that as we get to\nthis because like here's what i'm\nhearing from you okay\nit's like you're doing all the good\nstuff\nright and like you have a lot of\npatheticness in you\nbut you've learned how to like manage\nthat in a positive way\nright you're like i'm gonna devote\nmyself to growing and i'm gonna put my\nlife together\nand so you're almost in a sense putting\non a mask like it's the mask of like i'm\ngonna be\nsomeone like this is the road that i\nhave to walk and see\nlook everyone look at how much social\nanxiety i've cured dr k i came on like\ni've cured i've been cured of social\nanxiety i've been watching\nwatching your videos for two months and\nlike look at me look at how\nhow much i'm growing can everyone\nreassure me that i'm growing please\ncan we talk about how much progress\nwe've made\nand i played right into it right i was\nlike oh gabriel you're level two bro\nyou're not level one so you came in and\nyou asked me to play a part and i played\na part with you\nwhich is that gabriel is growing\nbut behind that is like this little\nthing right this little voice in the\nback of your head which is like it's not\ngonna work\nbecause like the person who's doing it\nlike we can pretend all we want to we\ncan have an a for effort we can check\nall the boxes\nbut something fundamentally is [ __ ]\nand that fundamental thing is me\nand you can pretend all you want to\ngabriel we're gonna do all this stuff\nand like at the end of the day like\nthere's just me\nwho's always known that there's a\nproblem and like i've\nnever been able to do anything about it\nthere's powerlessness\nright and there's like all kinds of\nother notes here of like\nyou know you love your mom your mom has\nbeen the one person who has like\nyou know been there for you and also\nyou blame her the most\nand then like that creates conflict too\nbecause like if you\nlike that's crazy like your dad is the\none who deserves the blame\nyour stepfather is the one who deserves\nthe blame but\nwho is the person who let those people\nin\nright who is responsible for protecting\nyou\nfrom her like from those people and so\nit can like it can feel really confusing\nto like blame and feel resentment\ntowards like the one person who's good\nin your life\nand then what ends up happening is like\nsomewhere in there like you're not going\nto blame your mom dude because that's a\ndick move\nso there's like one punching bag that\nyou've got left which is yourself\nand so like all of the blame that that\nlike she deserves like i\ni'm just gonna tell you you redirect it\nto yourself like does that make sense to\nyou\nlike i think i\ni could have been stronger i could have\nstood up for myself\nyep right so like like any time i try to\nblame her\nyou're gonna say like i should have been\nstronger\nlike you're gonna protect her by blaming\nyourself\nwhat are you feeling\nactual sadness for the first time in\nlondon\nand i'm very happy about it ironically\nright so like now like the dam is\nopening up and like\neverything is coming out yeah\nhappiness there's\nthere's there's anger about my father\nand my stepfather but also with me for\nnot standing up to them\nand there's frustration of the things i\nhad to go through and have\nnobody to talk to talk those things\nthrough with anybody because\ni didn't have friends like that\nso going through it is bad enough going\nthrough it alone\nyeah i also like\nthe the few friends i had they would\nusually be trained as well\ni remember telling some very personal\nthings that this elementary friend of\nmine\nthat he just like exposed me to the\nwhole class for no reason\noh sure he had a reason\nyeah i just don't know what it was i\nthink he's wanted to be a dick right\nhe wanted to take advantage of you he's\nbeing a bully well\npretty much and the [ __ ] the thing is he\nwas also like a\nanother isolated student like me so\nmaybe he wanted to feel powerful for a\nday on\nthere's your intellectual mind\nso notice that every one of those\nstatements you make you're going to move\nfurther away from\nthe emotion yeah i do with that don't\ndie i never\njust now be careful because now we're\ngetting very\nlike meta because do you beat yourself\nup for doing that\nbecause like you like it from my\nfeelings yeah\nabsolutely yes see\nso you got to be careful okay\nso like i i know it sounds a little bit\nunsatisfying and if you want to feel\nmore we can\nwe could go for round two if you really\nwant to\ni i'm not sure i'm just confused i don't\nknow what would be good for me anymore\nyeah so here's what i think would be\ngood for you okay\nso i i think that you have worked very\nhard\nto turn the dials on your emotions way\ndown\nbecause like in the span of like what do\nyou feel nothing what do you feel\nnothing what do you feel uh\nsome anger in there how do you know i\ndon't know and then like in 30 seconds\nit's like\nanger relief right you said happiness i\nthink it's relief\nreally yeah is that like oh i actually\ncan\nfeel like this is what i've been going\nfor right like but there's also like\nsadness and like self-loathing and like\nloneliness\nwhich we really haven't heard at all in\nany of your narratives\nright of like reaching out to people\nlike for support\nand like you know them really like\nstabbing you in the like there's there's\njust a lot of betrayal\nlike just of so many dimensions\nyou know like your grandmother not\nteaching you like just\nkind of abandoning you and then like\nlike you know like\ngiving you bad habits like that's\nthe other thing like i i think you\nprobably let yourself\nblame them for screwing you up\nbut then what happens is then you tell\nyourself like any time your mind is like\nit's their fault for like\nbecause we can hear that right like your\ngrandmother should have done a better\njob\nbut then what you end up doing is you\nstep right into it and you're like oh\nbut i could have been stronger\nyeah it's always about me\nright and so it's really interesting\nbecause like gabriel i think the reason\nthat you're stuck\nis because the person responsible is not\nactually responsible like if i blame\nmyself\nsingularly for global warming and\nclimate change\nthen like i'm never gonna be at peace\nbecause\ni can't single-handedly fix the planet\nand you're doing this thing where like\nit always comes back to you\nand i think the first thing you've got\nto start with is like self-loathing\nright because i i mean i think it's like\nthere's a lot there\nthat like you really detest about\nyourself\nyou know there's a part of you that like\nrationally says yeah it's other people's\nfault\nbut then there's a part of you that's\nlike no it isn't\nyeah you're just like screwed up or\nsomething wrong with you\nyep right and to sit with that thing\nis like really hard\nright so in a weird go ahead at some\npoint you know that's just the\nconclusion you come to because\nyour family is beating on you the school\nstudents are beating on you\njust like every person so it must be me\nright\nyeah that is the conclusion you come to\nlike i guess these people are right i'm\njust i'm just too loud i'm just\ntoo outgoing i don't keep to myself\nenough it's just\nyou know and uh well one particular\nthing that\nmy mother my cousin told me once when i\nwas like playing video games there\nwith them is that i used to play games i\nwould like\nstand up next to the couch like doing\nlittle hops with the controller in my\nhand like i was very energetic\nand a bunch of other kids were there too\nand she was like\nwhy can't she be like the other kids it\nwas like\ni was too young to even know what that\nmeant you know i was just like\nwhat the [ __ ] does that mean it can't be\nlike the other kids don't know\noh sure you know what that meant\nwhat that meant is why can't you be\nnormal why do you have to be screwed up\nin some way\nyou understand exactly what that meant\nyeah\nit's sunk everyone's just everyone's\njust like playing sitting down\nthough i'm the only one doing everyone\nelse is living their lives and they're\nscrewed up gabriel\nhopping around gabriel\nhomosexual gabriel\nright like it like everyone looked at\nyou and they saw like they weren't sure\nwhat it was\nbut they knew something was wrong that's\nlike really the one conclusion\nthe chicks i fell in love with it was\nthe same sentiment as well\nyep right\nhow are you feeling about this\nconversation\noh it's definitely cracking the shower\ni'm enjoying it\nit's weird it's it's yeah it's like you\nsaid it's relief\nit's still hard like the tears don't\nreally come out they're just like\nyou know there's camping here so gabriel\ndude we don't want to take a\nsledgehammer to your psychological\ndefense mechanisms\nas much as like we're gonna do relief\nlike a little bit at a time okay\nokay you have to like build up a\ntolerance to it\nlike irritable in this i feel\nvery confident that like\nyou know it's sort of like like if i'm\nif i'm learning yoga for the first time\ni don't bend all the way\ni'll break something or snap something\nand the mind ain't no different\nright so like you have to like let your\nmind gain that flexibility like you're\nnot right like i know you want it\nlike i get that you want the full relief\nyeah and so like we're gonna like teach\nyou how to like handle a little bit at a\ntime\nokay oh yeah that totally makes sense\ni was just sitting here thinking like\nwell the thoughts came to my mind now\ni'm not sure what i was thinking anymore\nbut\ni was in agreement with what you're\nsaying i was gonna make an example i\ndon't remember anymore\nit's okay good so we're short-circuiting\nyour mind which is good\nso that means that your intellectual\nlike crap up here is like\nnot able to function because there's\nlike a motion that's down below which is\nexactly\nso that's good okay so like you'll\ngabriel like you'll get there man\nlike you don't need to even even there's\neven another layer of like\ndon't judge yourself for not being able\nto get there\nall at once right you're walking your\njourney\nand so like it's okay to like feel a\nlittle bit of emotion\nfeel a little bit i get you want more\nyou'll get there man like i have\ncomplete faith in you\nokay you'll start to feel again you know\nand you're just gonna need a little bit\nof help like and that's okay\nbecause let's be honest you weren't\ngiven a whole lot of help for like\nwhat sounds like the first few decades\nof life okay\npretty much i'm 23 now and and if your\nsolace and bright point of your life was\nsa dota like\nyeah it was so good and i actually had\nan offer to be like people to invite me\nnow i'm not trying to like suck my baby\nbut\npeople still invite me even though like\ni haven't played for months i got a\nthing off or not\ni don't know i just don't feel like\nplaying\nyeah so now\nwe oh okay i mean so i we stepped into\nthe ring twice\ni'm hesitant to step into the ring a\nthird time i feel like\nthat size what we're looking for that's\nour limit okay\nyou feel okay with that yeah how's\nhow's your disappointment\nit's long okay good right so i i know\nthat earlier when i said i don't know if\nwe can get there you felt disappointed\nit's cool like that's fine\nit's all part of the game yeah so that\nit was like\nit was like a little voice in my head\nlike oh no even dr k\ncan't help it so yeah yep right so so\nlike that's like\nwe triggered that you know i'm\nbroken.exe\nand so you came here with that that you\nknow the like oh could dr k will help me\nlike\nand oh my god like he can't oh my god\ni'm screwed and then it's okay\nwe'll get there okay yeah\nso so now i if it's okay with you if\nyou're really feeling okay with it i\nmean if you want to go round three we\ncan\ntry to each round we go it's going to be\ntrickier for me to do in one setting\nbecause i have to like\nsquirt skirt past some of your you know\nintellectual stuff but i think it's if\nyou're feeling okay with it two rounds\nof relief like i'd like to share a\ncouple of concepts with you if that's\nokay\nyeah absolutely\nwhat's going on i said i accidentally\nsaid squirt instead of skirt\nand twitch chat is having a field day\nwith me\ni noticed but i was like whatever yeah i\nknow\num so so here's the first thing that i\nwant to say gabriel okay so\nwhat so you were kind of talking about\nhow like you experienced anxiety and\npanic attacks and underneath was\ndepression\nright yeah and you kind of call it\ndepression because you're maybe not\nfeeling sad but you don't have any\nmotivation there are problems with your\nconcentration things like that\nso this is the first thing to understand\ntrauma\nis the great chameleon of mental illness\nbecause it can look like and manifest as\nanything\nso one of my teachers once told me that\nif anyone has\nthree separate diagnoses\nall of them are wrong and chances are\nit's trauma\nso like any time i work with someone who\nsays i was dealing with anxiety first\nand then i\nfixed the anxiety and i found depression\nyou're going to fix the depression too\nand you're going to find something else\nthat's like that's exactly the feeling i\nwas describing to some people i'm like\nthe more it fits the more [ __ ] i find it\njust like\nit's and that that's trauma in short\nokay so trauma is the great chameleon of\nof mental illness like it just manifests\nas all these different kinds of things\nit's like it's like morphing where like\none minute it's this thing\nand then it's gonna turn into something\nelse and then it's gonna turn into\nsomething else\nthe good news is that even though it\nchanges\nshape on you that usually means you're\nmaking progress\nand at the end of the day if you can get\nto the root of the trauma\nall of the individual symptomatic\nmanifestations will fall apart\nand this is where we have to talk a\nlittle bit about the western system of\npsychiatry right\nbecause these are symptomatic diagnoses\nwhen i say you have\nanxiety that is not about a root it's\nabout a symptom\noh i get nervous and sweaty when i speak\nin front of people i feel tightness in\nmy throat when i queue up for a game of\ndota good god bro i'm so sorry\nlike dona's our last bastion from panic\nattacks and anxiety\nand you're so screwed if you don't even\nhave that\nright but it's a symptom it's not like a\nroot it's not like you have you know\ndota is not the root of your mental\nillnesses it may be the root of other\npeople's mental illnesses\nbut in yours it's a symptomatic\nmanifestation\nand this is why people get saddled with\nlike multiple diagnoses\ni'm sure that someone will diagnose you\nwith anxiety someone will diagnose you\nwith panic attacks\nsomeone will diagnose you with\ndepression someone will definitely\ndiagnose you with adhd\nand at the root of it all is trauma\nand so like as trauma manifests in\ndifferent ways\nour diagnostic system\nbecause it focuses on symptoms will end\nyou up with like four diagnoses on your\nchart if you're not careful\nokay but at the bottom of it is trauma\nso let's talk a little bit about like\nyou know what happens in trauma and\nhow these different things happen so if\nwe really listen to you what we hear\nis really one problem which is that\nyou're busted\nthere's something fundamentally broken\nwith you right\nand for women it's one thing you went\ndown the in-cell route right so you\ncould have gotten diagnosed with\nin-cell syndrome you know when it comes\nto\nlike school it may have been something\nelse when it comes to dota like it's\nsomething else like the one message that\nyou've gotten over and over and over\nagain is like you're busted and broken\nin some fundamental way\nand where does that come from so it\ncomes from trauma and very specifically\nwhere does it come from\nso when you're a child or an infant\nreally because do you know if you were\nphysically abused when you were like one\nyear old two years old things like that\ni cannot remember but i would not post\nit but i would not put it past my father\nsure so like this is essentially what\nhappens when you're now your\nphilosophical scientific self is gonna\nlove this [ __ ]\nokay so when you are young\nthere's this thing called theory of mind\nwhich is the realization that\nother human beings exist okay\nso when you're very young you don't\nrealize that other human beings exist\nlike your brain really doesn't have that\ncapacity as we get a little bit older\nlike as we become a toddler like let's\nsay\ntwo years old three years old four years\nold we start to realize there are other\norganisms\nlike so like when you're an infant when\nyou're one year old\nyou're a single player in a sandbox game\nthere aren't even npcs\nand then like when you're five years old\nyou sort of start to realize oh there\nare npcs in the world\nand then like when you become an\nadolescent this is why adolescence is so\nterrifying\nyou start the process of discovering\nthese aren't npcs\nthis is actually an mmo with other\nplayers\nand that everyone is their own pc in\ntheir own world\nand as we become adults and hopefully if\nwe become empathic and stuff\nwe begin to realize that there are all\nthese other people in the world\nand so the interesting thing is once we\nrealize there are other people in the\nworld\nand something goes wrong whose fault can\nit be\nall the yours so that's what you\nthink because but when once pcs exists\nright like\nonce other people are this is exactly\nlike\nyou answer the question incorrectly\nwhich shows us the problem and shows us\nyour thinking\nbecause once two people exist in the\nworld responsibility can be on\neither one but if you're a solo player\nin a sandbox game\nwhose fault is it it can only be your\nfault\nso this is what we see in trauma and\nit's actually like very well studied now\nand we sort of know this\nthat because of theory of mind if i'm a\none-year-old child and i get hit whose\nfault is it\nit's my fault and if you think about it\nif if\nif we didn't think this way we could not\nfunction as infants\nso when i learn when i'm learning how to\nwalk and i stumble and fall\ni have to think about what i need to do\ndifferently i can't go around like\nblaming my mom\nfor me stumbling and falling at the age\nof one it's just you'll never learn\nanything\nand so like our brains are wired to\nblame only ourselves which is why trauma\nis so devastating\nbecause when you get abused like the\npain that you\nfeel you think is your fault like every\ntime your dad hits you\nyou think you're doing something wrong\nit's your fault it's your fault it's\nyour fault because you're the only thing\nthat exists in the world\nand then we get to this like complex\nwhere like you go through life\nblaming yourself constantly\nbecause early on like your mind is like\noh clearly like when i'm in pain it's my\nfault because other people don't exist\nand then you discover that formula that\nform formula\ngets you know not really hardwired but\nit gets put in right protect mode so\nit's hard to change\nand then as you go through life that\nformula gets reinforced\nright when girls reject you\nthere's something wrong with me there's\nsomething wrong with me there's\nsomething yeah something wrong with me\ni was just about to say it makes a lot\nof sense for me because back when i was\nan insult that's\nexactly what would happen it's like like\ngirls would reject me and i'm like\nwhat did i do wrong just because they\nweren't into me like doesn't necessarily\nmean anything i know that now\nbut back then yeah so then what happens\nis we have the trauma\nand then our intellectual mind comes up\nwith all the adaptations and protections\nand defense\nmechanisms which is what happens within\ncells right so like i can't deal with my\nsense that i'm doing something so wrong\nso let me construct an external world\nview that like deflects blame for myself\nokay and this is where like you are just\nmisattributing blame right and left like\nwe're like because now\nlike when it comes to your mom you're\ntaking too much blame\nand when it comes to incels like they're\nattributing too much blame to the\noutside world\nright so like the point though is that\nsomething about the responsibility\nstructure in your mind has gotten like\nmiswired and so we see this a lot\nbecause like and this is why like it's\ngonna keep on manifesting as weird\nthings as long as you're fundamentally\nbusted\nit's going to manifest in particular\nsymptomatic ways\nyeah that makes a lot of sense because\nlike for example i have all these\nphilosophical ethios that i said i\nwanted to\nwrite a book or like make some youtube\nvideos so i have them here on the\nnotebook and\nwhat will usually happen is uh\nwould you allow me to like read a very\nshort stream\nsure something that i wrote down that i\nfelt very good about and basically what\nhappens is\nafter enough time passes i'm like yeah\nyou know that good thing you wrote down\nthat you're proud of yeah it's trash you\nknow don't share it with anyone\nthat happens a lot so there's this thing\ni wrote\ni'm just gonna read it uh\ntake notice of your insecurities and\nhealth reproductions of past events\nby fixing this you will no longer be\nanxious and require your ego to protect\nyou\nso that's like like the type of things\nthat i write down and then you know i\ncan go deeper into it i'm\nif i'm gonna make a video about it and\nso i write these things down\nand it depends on how good i i felt\nabout it like the more\nthe better i felt about the idea at the\nmoment it takes longer for that thought\nto come\nbut eventually it comes like either a\ncouple hours or a couple days i'm like\nyeah you know that thing you wrote down\nyeah not like\nit's obvious it's not there's no point\nin sharing it\nabsolutely so now let's talk a little\nbit about like principle number two\nwhich\nis how this trauma leads to a lack of\nmotivation\nso like there's a there's an equation\nthat's going on in your head right like\nyou\nyou do something that you're proud of\nand then that voice creeps up in the\nback of your mind that then says\nthis is dumb because from a very young\nage you were taught\nthat like you're fundamentally busted\nright so when you get abused\nand you start to like blame yourself for\nthe things that happened to you\nwhich is the basic problem like that's\nwhat you experienced through and through\nthen how can you ever be motivated\nbecause what's the point\nif you were fundamentally busted in even\nyour greatest\nefforts are actually trash\nwhy would you ever act\nso this is where like you know when you\nsay there's a lack of motivation\nabsolutely so the motivation the lack of\nmotivation is because like human beings\nour brain is wired to predict the\nsuccess\nof an action and that's what causes us\nto act\nlike i'm not gonna go you know try to\nchop down a tree to get a glass of water\nbecause my brain\nsays like it's absurd my brain's like\nthere's no point in doing that because\nit'll never work\nand so as long as you believe that thing\nabout yourself the motivation will be\nnot even hard to come by it'll be\nimpossible to come by it doesn't mean\nthat you can't act\nright but like as as long as there's a\nvoice in your head\ntelling you any action you take is\nworthless because it's never going to\namount to anything\nit's going to be impossible to motivate\nyourself so that's what we sometimes\ncall\ndepression because you're like i don't\nknow what to call this thing so i'mma\ncall it depression\nright which is fair it's like it's the\nexperience of depressed people but i\nthink that depression is actually like a\ncomplicated\nterm that can actually lead to like\nif you follow depression down to its\nroots we're going to see multiple things\nand what i'd say is if you're struggling\nwith motivation and you have a history\nof trauma\nthe key thing that will really just\nshatter that apart in the same way that\nwe like\nyou know cracked your damn and like all\nkinds of emotions came out\nsadness anger relief happiness like what\nthe hell is going on\nthe system will fall apart and in the\nsame way your lack of a\nmotivation will also just like it'll\njust crumble man\nthat feels very good to hear yeah if you\ncan change your perception of yourself\nand that's where we get into like all\nkinds of other things because\nif you can't change into your perception\nof yourself whose fault is it\nmine absolutely it'll keep going okay so\nbe careful for it\nbut i've seen it happen and in the same\nway that all the emotions will come\nrushing out\nlike you'll just start to feel motivated\nbecause there's a point to you acting\nthen motivation will come but in order\nfor there to be a point\nin you acting you have to have like some\ndegree of like\ncompassion and faith in yourself that\nyou can do it\nand that's a slow journey and in your\ncase it starts with learning how to feel\nand also like crazy yeah\nit's crazier mentioning this because\nit's like it's like i was saying i can\nsee an inner knee\nlike i know what he's like he's very\nlike charismatic\ngood with people he has lots of friends\nlike he just goes and does\nthings and he sparkle when i'm dipping\nto meditation i can\nsee that person inside myself so what\nyou're saying makes a lot of sense that\ni need to try and get to him because all\nthis shit's in the way\nyeah and if you want to go even deeper\nyou don't need to get to him he's\nalready there\nit's your effort to try to get to him\nthat creates the sense of incapability\noh i'm chasing an idea oh [ __ ]\nright so this is where like like it's\nweird\nbut as long as you're trying to get to\nhim\nyou're not him and what makes you not\nhim is like\nnot being him you know does that sound\nkind of weird i completely understand\nbecause i'm all about the philosophical\n[ __ ] so i got\nit you you get me so it's it's the chase\nfor the goal\nthat actually it becomes the\nself-fulfilling prophecy\nbecause you don't need to be any\ndifferent gabriel that dude's there bro\nyou're there we've seen him today\nyou've always been you it's [ __ ] up\nbecause people tell me that all the time\nthey're like they can see like my\ncharisma and my whatever and i'm just\nlike\nnah i don't think it's there right but\nyou know it's there\nit's the fact that you can't see it\nthat moves it away\nyeah that's that's exactly what happens\nyeah absolutely\nand you know it's like you were saying\nas long as i chase it so i'm not going\nto get to it i just need to pee\ni completely understand and it reminds\nme of you know\nuh vegeta chasing goku he's like he\nnever gets up he catches love because\nhe's just chasing\nyeah and this is where where there's um\nyou know i think like the last thing\ni'll kind of leave you with\nis this sort of idea from like like this\nis why like when we we look at\nenlightenment\nthere's all the zen masters will say\nthat we're already enlightened\nwe actually don't need you can't become\nenlightened you can't\nbecome anything there's just what is\nand so like the the first thing that a\nzen master does when they become\nenlightened is laugh\nbecause and someone asked him why are\nyou laughing like a crazy person like\nthis has all been a\ngargantuan waste of time i didn't need\nto do any of it\ni was already perfect and so even when\nwe say\nenlightenment we will also translate it\nas realization\nrealization is not about gaining\nsomething new\nright it's you already have it you just\nrealize it\nyeah it's noticing what is\nright so like when you meditate and you\nfeel that\nperfect you that's not a perfect you\nit's you\nand as long as you think of it as a\nperfect you you will by definition\ncreate and imperfect you the two come\nhandily yeah\nyeah because i will be the one that is\nnot\nthat yep so as long as there's\nthis you're going to create a vat and\nsince you love the philosophical stuff\nthat is the root of advaita vedanta\nif you know what that is it's\nnon-dualism which is like the\nmajor yogic philosophy that i tend to\nteach from\ninternational families yeah so i'll oh\nso it's a d v a i t a\nv a d a n t a i'll message you in\ndiscord\nokay but but it's sort of this idea that\nlike you know there's just a one thing\nand\neverything else is an artificial\nconstruction that's created from the\nmind\nand i think when you as you start to\nlike you know meditate and stuff you'll\nbegin to understand\nso this is a philosophy that wasn't\ndeveloped as a philosophy it wasn't\ndeveloped as an intellectual exercise\nit was devel it was the way that people\ntried to put into words the experiences\nof meditation\nmakes sense so you know\nany questions\nuh not really i think you've taught me a\nlot\nbecause you're definitely right on the\nthing that you know i wasn't trying to\ncome across that way as\nsmart as when i joined but i definitely\nhad this whole\nthing of you know i've learned a lot\ni've done all these things and\nblah blah blah and you've helped me see\nsomething that i could not see so that's\nthe biggest gift i could ask for\nwell i'm happy to give it so i'm gonna\nleave you with a meditation\npractice and and i guess i'm going to\nleave it for everyone i don't know that\nmany people are going to be able to do\nit very easily\nbut like gabriel this is the main thing\nyou need to learn when you meditate\nand you find your perfect self i want\nyou to just\nsit between your perfect self and your\nimperfect self\nso every time you tell yourself you are\nincapable\nthat should become your meditation and i\nwant you to look at that and realize\nlike\nwhy do i feel imperfect now\nand when you meditate and you feel that\ntrue you\nwhy do you feel like that's the true you\nlike because if you really want to\novercome this you need to understand\nlike\nwhat is the true you so every time you\nfeel incapable\nsit with it every time you meditate sit\nwith it in the same way\nbe non-judgmental don't prefer one over\nthe other\nand for those of you who have experience\nwith meditation i would encourage you to\ndo the same thing right so like\nwhen we meditate we sometimes see a\nversion of ourself that we try to\ngravitate towards\nwhy do we prefer that person as opposed\nto this person what's the difference\ni want you to swim in that space between\nperfection and imperfection\nsounds hard but i know what you're\nsaying yep\nand so what you'll discover i'll give\nyou a little do you want to hint\nyes please so what you'll discover\nthis is the real thing it says you swim\nbetween perfection and improv\nlike there's the perfect you and there's\nthe imperfect you right\nhopefully one day you'll realize who the\n[ __ ] is doing the swimming\nthat's a very good question\nhuh\nno i don't have a philosophical [ __ ]\nanswer this time so good because you're\nnever going to have one\nit's impossible so that's good so then\nthat's the meditation practice for you\nso at the edge of\nphilosophy i'm not saying philosophy is\nbad it's definitely very useful\nbut at the edge of philosophy comes\nsubjective experience\nbecause philosophy is like the\ntranslation of it's the objectification\nof subjective experience\nthat we try to transmit between each\nother so by all means like do philosophy\ndude write your book\nshare your thoughts because i genuinely\nthink they have value i think you need\nto work on them\nright so thank you but that means a lot\ncoming from you because i'm definitely\nfelt\nlike i didn't know you wanted to write a\nbook on philosophy but like within the\nfirst five minutes i thought the way\nthat you put things together\nis like quite good it's like\ninstagram calendar level tweet\nlevel deep shower thoughts yeah\nso that's just i am very smart\ni've done so much introspection and gone\nthrough so much that i want to share\nthis with other people pretty much so\nthat's how we see it\ni i think it's fine to share but i would\nreally\nlearn be a master of it before you share\nit don't share a half-baked thing\nit's like that right so like devote\nyourself to this and then like\nabsolutely write a book but like it\nshould be packaged complete and thorough\nokay i'll take that advice yeah\nthank you thank you guys so much for\nhaving me\nthank you man see you chad see ya\nokay chat tricky one was gabriel"
