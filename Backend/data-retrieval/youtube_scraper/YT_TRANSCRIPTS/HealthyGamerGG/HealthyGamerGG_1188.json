    "transcript": "[Music]\nokay so are we talking about\nnarcissistic parents great question so\nwe are talking about\nentitled parents and so this is the\nfirst thing so let's talk about entitled\nparents so what i\ni want to do is explain a little bit\nabout my experience with\nuh working with people who have entitled\nparents and sort of how to understand\nthem\nand what seems to work the first thing\nthat we're going to talk about is that a\nnarcissistic parent\nan entitled and an entitled parent is\nnot\nnecessarily the same so oftentimes\nentitlement and narcissism tend to\noverlap\nbut i think about narcissism as\nessentially a fragile sense of\ninternal self that requires a lot of\nvery careful outward appearance and\ntreatment to sort of maintain your\ninternal sense of self\nso narcissists sort of take the like\ntake things in the world around them is\nlike personal insults\nso if for example you're supposed to\npick me up from the airport and you get\na flat tire on the way\ni will take that as a personal insult if\ni am a narcissist well i'm not\nnecessarily but\noftentimes we'll take you know things\nthat have nothing to do with my life and\ntake them as\npersonal insults so it's like oh my god\nyou don't care about me enough to be on\ntime i waited so long\ni've been waiting here for a long time\nand there was this creepy person\nand oh my god like i can't believe that\nyou would do this to me i would never do\nthis to you\nso everything sort of becomes about the\nrelationship between me and you\neven though it's like you got a flat\ntire and you had to change your tire in\nthe rain like that sucks but\nall i can kind of think about is myself\nthe other aspect of narcissism is also\nthat you have to maintain\nan outwardly elevated sense of self\nbecause you feel\ninsecure on the inside so you know i\ncan't be insulted\ni can't i have to dress a particular way\npeople need to treat me a particular way\nbecause that's how i know that i'm worth\nsomething because on the inside\ni'm afraid of of you know what my true\nvalue is\nso that's a little bit different from\nentitled parents so in\nentitled parents what we're really\nthinking about is entitlement so\noftentimes they overlap\nbut entitlement is sort of about rights\nright so it's like\ni deserve x y and z\num and so oftentimes narcissism and\nentitlement can go\nhand in hand but what i really think\nabout in terms of entitled parents is\nparents who don't respect boundaries\nparents who don't respect autonomy\nparents who don't\nsort of give their kids choices and\nrespect their choices\nthat's what i think of as an entitled\nparents\nso i'm gonna give you guys just like one\nexample so i was working with a kid who\nwas south asian\num so growing up you know his parents\nwere very controlling\nand also kind of very entitled and so\nthey would sort of regulate a lot of\nwhat he\ncould or couldn't do they they started\nhim like\nplaying tennis at the age of like seven\nstarted having him play\nlike chess in a musical instrument at\nthe age of like\neight or nine um maybe even younger\nso he was sort of like this indian kid\nand then in high school\nyou know they told him like okay here\nare your career options\nyou're gonna you know we want you to\nplay chess we want you to play a musical\ninstrument\nand you're gonna be a tennis athlete\nthose are gonna be your options\nhe sort of like was interested in\nbasketball and baseball and they're like\nyeah we\nyou know literally the the what his\nparents told him is\nour people don't do that okay and so he\ndecided like they were like yeah like if\nyou you know we'd really like it if you\nwanted to be a doctor but he wasn't\ninterested in being a doctor\nso he ended up um becoming a studying cs\nwhich was somewhat of an uphill battle\nuh his parents didn't allow him to go to\nprom so he wanted to go to prom and was\narguably dating a girl but they were\nlike no you're you're not\nallowed to do that so they were just\nreally really\ncontrolling and felt like they had the\nright to make decisions for him\nso they were also he was also a gamer\nbut they were very very strict\non what kind of uh you know gaming he\ncould do and\nhis mom would set like really really\nfirm limits so he goes off to college\nhas a little bit of a rough year or two\nin terms of like\nlearning how to deal with his newfound\nfreedom parents were also quite\ncontrolling in terms of like\nmandating all kinds of random crap that\nhe really didn't adhere to because they\ndidn't have any power over him but\nthey're like you need to be you know\nyou can't no leaving your dorm past nine\no'clock\nyou need to be back at your dorm by nine\npm every single day\nand they would like call him and and\nthings like that and if he didn't answer\nthey'd get pissed off\nall this kind of stuff so like super\ncontrolling felt like his choices were\nnot his own like his parents made his\nchoices for him\nso he tried to sort of argue with them\nabout this stuff so like at many points\nthroughout his life he would like have\narguments with his parents and he'd say\nthings like this is not what i\nwant to do and they'd say like okay well\nwe don't care\nright like you have to do what we tell\nyou to do because we're your parents and\nyou have to listen to us\nand so something funny happened so\ndad actually so mom was a stay-at-home\nmom dad was\num lost his job during the pandemic\nand so after he had been out of school\nfor one year\nlanded a pretty good job and still\nparents were like pretty entitled pretty\nyou know would want him to call every\nday and things like that so he goes home\nand because his parents need help\nsort of supporting the family and things\nlike that because his dad has lost his\njob so he's essentially like paying the\nparents bills\nand you know he goes home and then he's\nlike gaming at night and his mom comes\nin at like 10 p.m and she's like\nit's too late and you should stop gaming\nand he's like\ni have a job like what are you\ncomplaining about they get into a brief\nargument\nand then mom unplugs his pc\nso what do you think he does at that\npoint\nabsolutely right so he doesn't rage\nhe moves out and so he's like\nand because mom you know mom and dad are\nkind of like there's like a brief\nargument and there's this sort of like\nmy house my rules you have to respect\nthe rules of the house and he's like\nokay\nso if i have to adhere to your rules\nliving here i'm gonna move out\nand so the next morning like overnight\nlike he doesn't say that so the next\nlike overnight he kind of packs his\nstuff\nand moves out and then parents are like\nwait what you're moving out and then\nhe's like yeah i mean you said\nyour rules your house so i'm moving out\nso i can live my life the way that i\nwant to parents start to panic there are\nfinancial considerations\nthey're like oh no no like like\nwait no don't do that don't do that like\nwe need your help like things like that\nand he's like okay so if you need like\nfinancial support\nyou know you guys raised me and stuff so\nthat's fine i'll like\ni'll pay your bills for some amount of\ntime not a big deal but\ni'm not going to live here and and so it\nwas a really kind of\ninteresting you know dynamic because\nthen like the parents were kind of\nreally shocked\nand so as the conversation kind of went\non as i\ni was working with him at the time and\nso he started to have like a couple of\nconversations with his parents\nand and were actually able to bring his\nparents around to a couple of things\nbecause i don't think his parents sort\nof realized what they were doing\ni don't think they really understood the\npower dynamics of the situation\ni don't think they had accomplished what\nthey thought they had accomplished\nthey were shooting for obedience instead\nof like understanding or any kind of\nrelationship\nthey wanted a robot for a son as opposed\nto like a thinking\nadult part of that is i think heavily\ncultural but i sort of see it outside of\nthe south asian culture for sure\nwhere people parents sort of expect\nobedience they expect\nyou know that they are entitled to\num you know private communications that\ntheir kid has\nthey are entitled to violate their kids\nboundaries in space and determine what\nthey do and what they don't do\nso what i'd like to do is just share\nwith you guys like a couple of ways to\nthink about entitled parents\nif you guys have entitled parents how to\nhave conversations with them\nand more importantly how not to have\nconversations with them\nand then ultimately hopefully try to do\nyour best to\nbuild a relationship that is like\nsomewhat\nhealthy okay so the first thing to\nunderstand\nis entitled parents tend to be entitled\nnot because of like moral deficiencies\nof character that are genetic\nor intrinsic but honestly because of the\nway that they were raised\nso oftentimes if you think about a\nparticular parenting style\nwe learn what appropriate parenting is\nby how we were parented\nso in in this kid's case i mean this is\nlike a long it's like a whole\nculture right so where like in the south\nasian culture like\nthis is what you do you do this and then\nyou do this and then you do this\nyour parents even not even in extreme\ncases i was about to say in extreme\ncases\nbut even in quite common cases will\ndetermine who you will marry\nlike i met someone in my neighborhood a\ncouple months ago and you know they were\ntelling me so they're my age\num and even a few years younger and they\nwere actually telling me that they met\ntheir spouse like on the day of their\nengagement\nand hung out with them for a total of\nabout three hours before their wedding\nso they met once for like an hour and a\nhalf and they like saw each other twice\nfor like\nan hour and then like half an hour so\nthis is kind of a culture that you come\nfrom so\nin the case of south asian stuff it's\nlike very cultural but we also find that\nyou know you don't have to be south\nasian i've worked with a lot of people\nwho are caucasian a lot of people who\nare black\na lot of people who are african-american\nor even nigerian whose\nparents are very very controlling and\nvery entitled\nto their kids life and so what we tend\nto find is that\nthe reason oftentimes the reason that\nthey are that way or one big reason is\nbecause that's the way their parents\nwere with them\nand so it's not to say that we shouldn't\nhold people responsible\nfor their actions but at the same time\nwe should try to understand\nwhere their actions are coming from\nbecause if our goal is to build a\nhealthy relationship\nunderstanding is just as important as\nchange\nso then the next question becomes okay\nso if they were raised to like kind of\nthink this way what do we do about that\nand this is where we get into the first\nproblem that many people who are dealing\nwith entitled parents\nmake so many kids is that they try to\nconvince\nso in my experience trying to convince\nentitled parents of something\nis generally speaking a waste of time so\ndon't try to justify\ndon't argue don't explain don't try to\nbring them\nto your way of thought because generally\nspeaking like it's gonna frustrate you\nand like they're just not gonna do it so\ninstead the goal is to get them to think\nokay not to convince them that you're\nright but to get get them to sort of\nlike\nquestion and examine their own beliefs\nright so you're not trying to bring them\nto where you are\nwe're just both going to look at their\nviewpoint\nso for example like you know this was a\nconversa this was part of the\nconversation you know\nmy patient had with his parents was so\nhe kind of talked to them and he was\nlike\nso as as as he moved out he's like if\nyou guys need financial support that's\nfine i'm just not going to live with you\nand they felt like really hurt and\nbetrayed\nand then he was kind of asking them like\nyou know what is our what is our\nrelationship right now so like\nand this is where we use a technique\ncalled going meta so you ask\nthem to think about or explain to you\nwhat their\nunderstanding of your relationship is so\nyou can start with a question of like\nwhat is this relationship like what are\nthe rules of this relationship to you\nhow does this relationship work this is\nwhere a lot of things like power\ndynamics come in but it's essentially\nlike\nyou know just asking them like you know\nhow does this work\nand it's kind of weird because most\nentitled parents never\nreally think about the rules of the game\nthat they are teaching you\nand it's my experience that once you\nshow them\nand and once they realize the rules of\nthe game that they're playing\nthey no longer want to play it anymore i\nknow it sounds kind of weird but you\ndon't have to convince them of anything\nyou just have to point out the rules to\nthem\nso it's kind of interesting because you\nknow it's sort of this idea that like\nthe parents were like well like you're\nour son so you have to listen to us\nand then and then so he he was kind of\nsaying well like i listened to you\nbecause i didn't have a choice\nlike what do you guys think about that\nyou know\nas soon as i have like and so this is\nwhere a conversation often times a\nconversation about\npower dynamics comes in so this is a\nquestion number one is like what are the\nrules of this relationship like how does\nour relationship work\nsecond a second uh question is you know\nwhat is the value of my opinion\nin this relationship so you have a\nparticular opinion\ni have a particular opinion how do we\ndecide\nwhat to do so if we have a disagreement\non opinion this is not even talking\nabout anything specific it's not about\nwhether i can go to prom or not go to\nprom it's just asking them\nyou know so in this relationship when i\nbelieve one thing and you believe\nsomething else\nhow do we decide which person to go with\nand essentially what entitled parents\nwill come down to\nis that it's a game of power dynamics\nright i'm the parent\ni'm the boss i pay the bills therefore i\nget the decision\nand this is where you really have a good\nopportunity because if if that's the\nsituation you can't\nreally argue with them right so as you\nare not financially independent as you\nare dependent on their\non your parents you have to play by\ntheir rules like it's it's going to be\nreally hard to change that\nso you can acknowledge that power\ndynamic but you also want to make it\nclear to the parents\nthat if this is the way that the game is\nbeing played that's fine\nwhat do you think is going to happen\nwhen i am no longer financially\ndependent\nright so if this is the rules of the\ngame is that like if if it's your house\nand your rules\nand and you know like we're just\ntrusting you because i don't\nhave an opinion or because you're the\nadult and i'm a child in the\nrelationship\nlike that's fine but what happens when\nwe're both adults like\ni'm not you know so you kind of like\npoint out the rules to them\nand eventually kind of what we got to is\nyou know the parents sort of understood\nthis when like\ntheir son was like yeah so what do you\nguys expect\nso this is another thing is ask the\nparents so when dealing with entitled\nparents i think a big\na big solution is to get them to think\nabout the evolution of your relationship\nover time so this is kind of how how\nthis patient did and he's like\nwhat are y'all expecting about you know\nwhen i get married what do you guys\nthink is gonna happen\nwhen i get married and they were like\nwell you know we'll have a big indian\nwedding and he's like\nwhy do you why would i why would i do\nthat\nwhat makes you think that i'm going to\ndo that if we've determined that the\nreason that i'm listening to you is\nbecause you guys hold power over me\nyou no longer have that so why would i\nlisten to you anymore\nand so then they were like what does\nthis mean does this mean that you're not\ngonna get married and he's like no i may\nget married but what do you guys\nyou know i'm gonna do what i feel like\nbut what are y'all envisioning about the\nfuture of our relationship\nare you guys envisioning that you will\ncome to my wedding\nand this is the kind of thing where it's\nlike you know this can feel like an\nattack\nand it's kind of interesting because the\nparents will perceive it as attack but\nthat's really not an attack so you don't\nwant to get upset\nyou don't want to convince you don't\nwant to punish your entitled parent you\njust want to get them to think\nwhat does this mean you're not going to\ninvite us to our wedding i didn't say\nthat\nso this is where you guys can use\nanother meta technique which is like\nasking the parent in the conversation\nwhat did you hear me say\nor what did you hear me ask and so\nreally what you want to do is don't try\nto convince them of anything\ngenuinely try to understand their\nexpectations\nand what we find is that as a lot of\nthese unthought\nand unconsidered ideas come to the\nsurface\nthis is when we start to see entitled\nbehavior change\nso as is the the kid genuinely sort of\nis asking his parents like what are you\nguys expecting\nand what do you base that on and so this\nis where like\nremember step one is like what is the\nnature of our relationship\nwhen we have a disagreement how does the\ndecision get made\nand what are you guys expecting our\nrelationship to look like in the future\nright so these are kind of like the\nthree steps that you've got to take and\nthis is where like i've had this\nconversation\nso another person i worked with you know\nhad a very controlling mother was a\nwoman\nand so she was sort of asking the\nquestion of like you know\nwhat's your understanding of like how\nhappy i've been as a kid growing up\nwhat's your understanding of like what i\nthink about\nyou know how decisions make and like do\nyou understand that i find you to be\nquite controlling\nyou know and they're like oh yeah but\nit's it's for your you know it's it's\nfor your benefit like we're doing this\nbecause like i know better\nand so then you know this is a another\nclient of mine who's like so\nmom like what's what's your expectation\nabout\nyour like how much you're gonna see your\ngrandchildren\nand then like that she's like well of\ncourse like i'm gonna like i'm gonna be\nvery involved and then\nthen this is where her daughter is like\nwell what makes you think that\nyou know it's kind of interesting\nbecause like but i'm your mother\nyou're like yeah i understand you're my\nmother but you know it seems that\nmost of our relationship seems to be\nlike quite one-sided\nlike you seem to determine the nature\nand style of interaction\nand you don't seem to respect my\nopinions or really listen to what i'm\nsaying\nand so i don't i don't want that kind of\nperson\nin my in my kid's life and so then the\nmom is like but\ni but i i deserve like are you telling\nme that i'm never going to be able to\nsee my grandkid\nit's like well no i mean you'll be able\nto see them but i don't want you to be a\nbig part of\ntheir life if you're going to be like\nthis and so then like the then this is\nwhere the parent is like well\nbut then like like what do you want me\nto do like and so oftentimes what the\nparents will do so when you kind of\nget through to them okay so you're not\nreally saying that you're gonna\nyou're not like trying to convince them\nof anything right it's just about\nsort of laying a boundary and then\noftentimes what the parent will do is\nwe'll be like well like you know what\nhow how can i fix this like i'm\ni'm sorry just tell me what i need to do\nto make it better\nand so this is where things get really\nreally tricky um so i'll give you guys\nkind of a third example\nso i had i had a a client who\nparents wanted them to come home for the\nholidays client really didn't want to\ncome home for the holidays was like yeah\ni'm not comfortable coming home\ni'm just i don't want to do that and and\nthen the parent was like well why don't\nyou want to do that you should come and\nit gets into this argument about the\nparent trying to convince them like come\nhome for the holidays come home for the\nholidays like if you don't do this oh\nyour\nyour dad will be so disappointed and\neveryone will wonder where you\nare like you know your aunts they'll\nstart asking questions why isn't this\nperson home for the holidays\nis everything okay like why don't you\njust come home like everyone will like\nthat\nthey're like yeah i'm not interested in\nthat and so then then it kind of gets\ninto this situation where you're like\nokay so then like how do you deal with\nthat and so you can lay a boundary and\nyou can say\nyou know mom if we're talking about\ncoming home from the holidays like what\nis this conversation about\nwhy are you calling are you trying to\nconvince me to come home from the\nholidays go meta\njust ask your parent like what is this\nwhat are we doing what's the purpose of\nthis conversation\nand then lay your boundary okay so then\nthey're like yeah well we are talk well\ni'm\nwe're talking about the holidays and\nyou're like i'm not interested in\ntalking about that i'm gonna hang up the\nphone now\nif you want to talk about other stuff\ni'm totally fine with that\nand then you hang up so lay a boundary\nright so this also involves a certain\namount of\npower dynamics and independence on your\npart\nand then you know mom will call back a\nlittle bit later and so once again kind\nof go meadow what are we talking about\nmom yeah i'm not comfortable with that\ni'm gonna hang up the phone and so then\neventually\nthe parent will like ask why are you\ndoing this\nwhy are you doing this to me why are you\nbeing like this\nyou can say yeah the reason i don't want\nto come home for the holidays is because\nyou don't respect my boundaries\nand then the parent is like okay fine\ni'll respect your boundaries fine\nfine just tell me like how to respect\nyour boundaries\nand so then you can say this is one of\nmy favorite interactions\nso what have i told you is my boundary\nabout coming home\nin conversations about coming home and\nthen they're like you said that\nyou don't want to talk about coming home\nand you don't want to come home\ngood how can you respect my boundary\naround that\nnot talk to you about coming home and\nnot pressure you to come up\nexcellent but then what about coming\nhome exactly mom\nnow do you get it this is the problem\nwhen\ni share something with you about the\nboundary they have\ni have you are willing to say that\nyou're gonna do anything\nyou'll respect my boundaries you'll do\nyou'll respect any boundary that i set\nexcept for the one that you don't\nrespect\nright and like this is the key thing is\nlike it's about understanding right\nso like when you get to that point and\nlike you you just\nshare with your parents you're like yeah\nso and they're like how do i get you to\ncome\nwhat do i have to do to get you to come\nand this is where like that you can say\nyou can't part of respecting my\nboundaries is respecting my decision\nthat i'm not gonna come\nand if you can do that i think we can\nhave a relationship\nif not i think it's not going to be\nit's not going to be much of a\nrelationship\nright so this is really challenging but\nwhen dealing with entitled parents once\nagain don't try to convince them\ndon't try to tell them hey it's like a\nbad idea for me to come\ni don't want to come here's why i don't\nwant to come\nhere's why coming is a bad idea for me i\nwant you to\njust like like don't try to convince\nthem of anything\nokay just get them to think and the way\nthat you get them to think\nis by asking them questions like what is\nthe nature of our relationship\nwhat is the what what is going on chat\nwhat clip city what are you guys talking\nokay oh coming home for the holidays\nchad come on\njesus okay i'm gonna keep going all\nright\ni'm gonna just keep plowing forward okay\njust keep\nkeep plowing forward okay let's keep\ngoing okay so number one\nask about the nature of the relationship\nnumber two\ntalk a little bit about like what is the\nnature of how agreements and\ndisagreements are resolved\nwho gets to decide and this is the\nreally tricky thing is as you guys have\nconversations about this\nyou know it's like completely fine to\nhave a conversation about it like it's\ngonna\nwe'll get to a couple of other points\nabout why these conversations are hard\nbut you just want to bring it to the\nsurface about how the decision gets made\nso is it because they're parents is it\nbecause you live under their house like\nthat's fine right like\nif you can't if that's the power dynamic\nthat exists\nand you don't have power in the\nrelationship there's really not much you\ncan do about it which is feels bad man\nokay so like sag but that's the truth of\nit at least acknowledge it\nand then the third thing that's really\nreally helpful in terms of getting\nentitled parents to really like think\nis to ask them like what do you imagine\nour\nrelationship is going to be like two\nyears from now five years from now 10\nyears from now\nand then if you want to you can ask them\nis it okay if i share my perspective\nand so then they say of course you can\nshare your perspective and then you\ncould say well so like\ni think that are in this relationship i\ndon't feel respected\nso i think that you have power and i\ndon't\nbut the reason that we maintain this\nrelationship is because i don't have a\nchoice i feel like i'm a hostage\nwhich is fine it's just you know as i\nstart to gain independence\ni'm not sure how much of a relationship\ni want to have\nand you have to be really careful about\nsaying something like that especially if\nthere's a power dynamic or something\nlike that\nyou have to be able to sort of determine\nyour parents ability to tolerate that\nkind of statement\nbut i think it is a really useful\nquestion\num to sort of ask your parents like what\ndo you imagine\nour relationship is going to look like\nfive years from now 10 years from now\nand you know what how is that\nrelationship going to be different from\nthis one\nand it's been my experience that when\nyou stop trying to convince them and\ninvite them to like really understand\nand you\nalso try to understand you genuinely try\nto understand their perspective like it\nactually\nreally helps move things in the right\ndirection\nso a couple of caveats okay the first is\nthat this is very\nvery hard so like a big part of these\nconversations\ninvolves grieving and letting go\nand accepting that your parent is not\ngoing to say\nwhat you want them to say right so\nthat's really tough like it's hard\nto sit down in a conversation and\nrecognize that your parent has\npower over you whether it be financial\nor like\nother kinds of power and that like\nyou're the weak person in the\nrelationship\nthe interesting thing is that like as\nyou start to like accept that and admit\nthat\nand actually come to that conclusion\nwith your parent the relationship can\nfeel a lot less burdensome because\noftentimes what i find is that people\nare like\nthey're so upset by the injustice of it\nwhich absolutely like you should be\nupset by the injustice of it\nbut you being upset by the injustice\ndoesn't actually by itself change the\ninjustice\nright i know it sounds kind of weird\nlike this is something that i know is\nconfusing for the internet\nbut outrage does not make the world a\nbetter place\nit is the actions that follow outrage\nthat either make the world a better\nplace or a worse place\nright because there are a lot of actions\nthat come out of a feeling of outrage or\ninjustice\nthat actually can make the world a worse\nplace\nand it's really really dangerous\nterritory because and so this is why\nlike you know what i advocate for y'all\nis\nnot necessarily to take a drastic action\nbecause of the injustice but just\nacknowledge\nif your parents have the power in the\nrelationship just acknowledge that they\nhave it\nand what power do you have in the\nrelationship now\nyou have the power of memory right so\nyou are going to remember\nhow they treat you and how they treat\nyou today\nis going to a certain degree so the\nkarmic seeds for how you treat them\ntomorrow\nand this is the main this is really only\nlike the only\nleverage that you have if you're in a\nlarge like power dynamic\nrelationship and so this is kind of the\nsort of thing that like you just need to\nshare with them like okay if this is\nwhat the relationship is like\nwhat do you imagine it going because\nbasically\nyou know i feel like our connection is a\nlot\nis very circumstantial like i'm here\nbecause i have to be here\nbut i don't feel like you all respect me\nas people like you don't respect me as a\nperson\nyou don't respect my opinions you don't\ncare to listen to them or understand\nthem which is my observation\ni don't need to convince you that you\nshould be listening to me\nso don't go down that route which is\nlike very dangerous right because it's\neasy to go down that route where you can\nsay\nthis has been my observation because\nwhen you tell me to do something and i\ndisagree like i don't want to be\na doctor but you tell me that i have to\nmajor in this\nso that's an example of me not\nrespecting y'all not respecting\nmy opinion and then this is where they\ngo down the tangent of but no but it's\ngood for you like we know better we're\nyour parents you can say like yeah i'm\nnot\ni'm not debating that you guys have been\nalive longer than i have\nand that you may know better than i do\nbut i'm still not hearing you guys like\nask or care about what i what i want\nright so you guys are operating from you\nknow better\nbut i'm not hearing anything about what\ni want\nand so you can point that out right\nthat's the nature of the relationship\ndecisions get made by their subjective\nsense of what is better as opposed to\nwhat you want\nand so then like later on you can kind\nof let them know okay so like you guys\nbelieve this but you don't\ndo you all see how it doesn't appear to\nme like you guys care about what i want\nyou guys are valuing better over\nwant right what i care about is not as\nimportant as what you guys think is good\nfor me\nwhich is fine let's just call it what it\nis\nand so over time yeah so someone's\nsaying\nlike my parents don't believe that their\ntheir view is subjective which is fair\nright so like that's a fair point of\nview you don't need to argue with them\nabout that they say\nwe've been alive we are higher level\nthan you are we have more xp\ntherefore we know better if i am you\nknow\ndiamond league in law and your bronze\nleague in law\ni may know more about the game than you\ndo so you don't want to go down that\nroad of whether they're objectively\ncorrect or subjectively correct or\nwhatever\nthe the argument that you want to go\ndown or like the point that you want to\nmake is like\nyou guys are operating on a belief of\nwhat's better and i'm operating on a\nbelief of like\nwhat i want to do right if i want to\nplay techies\ni'm going to play techies forget that it\nruins everyone else's game\nso so this is kind of like this is my\nkind of guidebook to dealing with\nentitled parents right\nwhich is like so notice the nature of\nthe relationship\nlike ask them okay what's going on here\nacknowledge the power dynamics\nso that's sort of like when we have a\ndisagreement how does the decision get\nmade and then\ninvite your parents to think a little\nbit about how this relationship is going\nto evolve over time\nso this is also where you don't want to\npunish them right so you got to be\nreally careful here because it can turn\ninto a\nif you don't let me do this i'm going to\ncut you out of my life that's not what\nyou want to do you don't want to be like\nemotional about it\nyou don't want to threaten them you just\nwant to say like okay so\nyou know what do you imagine this is\ngoing to look like and i'm not so sure\nthat like i'm going to be comfortable\nwith that kind of relationship as i\nbecome more independent\nwhat do you think about that right\nand so the conversation should be calm\nit should be collected you have to let\ngo of your own emotions\nright acknowledge that your parents may\nnot care about your opinion\nacknowledge that you're the weak party\nin the relationship and recognize that\ntime is on your side right so as as you\nget older you will\ngradually gain more independence you\nhave more independence in college than\nyou did in high school\nyou have more independence after college\nthan you did\nyou know during college as you become\nfinancially independent then you will\nhave\neven more you know control over your own\nlife\nand the main message that you want to\nget across to them is not that you're\ngoing to cut them out because you don't\nwant to threaten them\nbecause if you threaten them that's\ngoing to evoke their defensiveness and\nwhatever narcissism is there\nwill come out swinging if you kind of\nthreaten them so you don't want to do\nthat you just want to invite them to\nthink\nthat's the goal not to convince to\ninvite them to think\nso what do you guys think is going to\nhappen"
