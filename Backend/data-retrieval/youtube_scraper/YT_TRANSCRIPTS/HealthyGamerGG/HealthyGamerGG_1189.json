    "transcript": "right because like what you're trying to\nlike you have this artificial\nconstruction of like one day i'm gonna\nbe this thing and i'm gonna be fixed\nand once i'm fixed then i'm gonna go out\nand i'm gonna help the world like it's\nnot how it works man like\nyou're never fixed you just got to do\nthe work that you got to do like there's\nno like fixed is not a thing\nwelcome thank you uh\nand can you tell me what you want to be\ncalled today or how i should refer to\nyou\nuh jt like by the alphabet because i\nhave a chinese name so it's just easier\nokay\njt okay welcome jt\nare you joining us from uh it's a form\nof a foreign country are you\nuh yeah yeah i'm from singapore\nokay southeast asia okay cool\nso welcome and um\nhow are you feeling today uh\ni'm like excited and also nervous yeah\nyeah\nthose two those two usually go hand in\nhand right\nyeah yeah and and what can we help you\nwith j\ntoday jt or how can i help you today\nokay uh\nsorry is it okay just use my phone cause\ni just jotted this down um\nyeah of course it's just how how to not\nlet the fear of falling behind\nfurther hinder my life and how i\ninteract with other people\nokay um and and can you tell me a little\nbit about\nyour fear of falling behind\nwell it's i mean like uh it's just that\ni've fallen behind\nin terms of education uh my social\nrelationships with people\nuh my love life essentially\nyeah and i i think like i've also like\ni i i think maybe like uh i felt like\nshame from it\nor like people have to have like uh\npointed it out that\nlike let's say like in terms of my\nschooling my classmates like dude you're\n20 already like\nhow are you still here or like like can\nyou like add your age and stuff like\nthat you know when i'm behind\nlike like when i'm talking to them and\nstuff like that so yeah just like\nyeah and it's just like sorry\nyeah keep going oh um\nis this that uh yeah i'm just like\nconstantly reminded that\ni'm like following further behind and i\ndon't have like a lot of time left\nif i want to like achieve like my goal\nin life\nokay so and how old are you jt\ni'm 20 this year 20 this year okay\nso i i'm i'm sort of getting the sense\nthat\nyou may be feeling desperate\nuh i guess yeah that's right\nokay and and so\nwhat um what do you want to achieve\nuh my life goal oh you said it\noh yeah sorry uh yeah okay so i'm just\ngonna preface this by saying like okay\nit sounds very\nit's like very big okay but it's just\ngenuinely how it truly feels i'm just\ngonna say it\nokay like good i essentially plan to do\nwhat\nyou are doing but in singapore and then\nlike uh i just wanna start like a mental\nhealth startup that way and\nlike in order to do that you just have\nto get like singapore is like a very\nmonotonic like society so like you have\nto get like super good grades if you\nwant to like\ndo something big so yeah that's why like\nuh\ni i'm like uh working so hard to ensure\nthat i\nat least like get into university okay\nyeah so so um well so\ni know this may be a little bit weird\nbut i'm\nin a weird way like you know i wouldn't\nhave been able to do\nwhat i did unless i had fallen behind\nright because like like\nyou know so i think like in short\ni mean so you know we'll talk a lot more\nbut like\nlike falling behind is like a core part\nof who i am\nand you have to if you want to help\nother people like\nyou can't be someone who's at the top of\nyour class and like\ntell someone hey like just you know this\nis the road to success\nyou have to have actually failed if you\nwant to help people who have also failed\ni'm not saying that i'm not recommending\nit to anyone because it sucks\nyeah it does you know so the first thing\nis so i just want to kind of toss that\nout there\ni still want to learn a lot more about\nyou i think we're not really\nyou know i want to learn a lot more\nabout you but my first thought is that\nyou know if you want to start a mental\nhealth\nif you want to be the the singaporean\nversion of me\nyou're doing it perfectly and falling\nbehind is how you start so that's like\ngreat\nlike that's the first step of your main\nquest is to fall behind\nand yeah okay yeah i guess that's true\nbut like\nbecause like you've mentioned before\nlike you essentially have like a limited\ntime frame of\nof like of like how you want to help\npeople because you feel like\nthere's going to be a time of age like\nwhere you don't feel a sense of relation\nto like the\nyoung adults right so like i feel like\nthe\nthough if i keep falling behind further\nlike maybe like 10 years or like maybe\nor like maybe like five years\nmaximum in terms of how i want to help\npeople yeah so\nwhat i'm hearing is that there's a\ncertain amount of falling behind\nthat is on track and if you\nfall behind too much you have fallen\nyou've missed that\nsweet amount of falling behind and\nyou're worried about that\nyes it is very okay cool we can we can\nwork on that okay so tell me a little\nbit about um so it sounds like people\nyou know will will like point your\nthey'll tell you about your age and what\ndo they say\nthey'll say like oh you're 20 years old\nand can you tell me about that\noh so like um i guess like\nwhen i'm wrong people that i'm\ncomfortable with i tend to act like\nimmaturist right so like\nsometimes i tend to annoy them and stuff\nlike that it's like my friends were like\noh my god can you just like\nyou're 20 and like we are 18 really you\nknow and and we're just like okay yeah\nthat just keeps me in check you know\nlike like grounded yes i'm supposed to\nact like this\nor like let's say like sometimes they\ntell me like oh i forget that sometimes\nyou're 20 you know so like it makes me\nthink like\nlike damn they're like really so behind\nbecause like these people like 18 and 20\nalready they're like\nthey're literally at the same pace that\ni am and then like people like\nlike let's say like in my boxing gym\nthose people who are my age they're\nalready like serving their mandatory\nlike national service\norderly like in university like pursuing\nthe things that they want and i'm just\nlike\nlike in my second year of like like uh a\nsecond year\ncollege okay so is that not universal\ncan you help me understand what\nuniversity is and what second year\ncollege is\noh okay so um so in terms of singapore\nthere's like\nuh like we don't really go to like when\nyou go from high school you don't really\ngo to like a\na college for like a like just a general\ncollege you get\nthere's like three like junior colleges\npolytechnics\nand uh ide so that's like uh like it's\njust a\nso like uh from when i was like when i\nwas 16 i went to\nite so that's the worst one essentially\nit's a bit harsh but yeah uh so but in\norder to get the university you actually\nhave to get to like the second tier in\norder to get into university\nright because the first year is not able\nyou only have to do it when you're 16.\nif not\nyou you don't have the chance uh yeah so\nso\nsecond year is just like yeah this is my\nsecond year in polytechnic because\nthere's like three years in\nthis college okay so what are most\npeople who are 20 doing in singapore\nuh they're either serving their\nmandatory national service or they are\nin university\nmost of them like if they follow the\nlike the first day of path right\nuh they they're already like in in\nuniversity\nokay so how many years behind\nare you uh\ntwo three four five five four\nfive oh five okay okay so\nyeah how does it feel to say that uh\ni think like i've i've i think i've come\nto come with\nokay i've not come to terms with it but\ni don't know it use\ndisheartening yeah yeah because\nyeah i'm just constantly reminded about\nit whenever i'm just interrupting people\nbecause like\nif i like new people that i'm trying to\ninteract with like for example\nlike they i tell them like i'm 20 in the\nsecond year college isn't like\nthat after them then i'm the second i\nmean like the second year college like\nprobably\n10 and they're like oh are you like\ngraduating soon like oh no\ni'm like in my second year then i oh\nokay or if i tell them like\ni was actually from the third tier\ncollege that's why then there's like uh\nthere's a stigma there because like\nin singapore like people tend to like\nlook down if you were in the third year\ncollege\nfor example yeah there's like all this\nlike uh\nfactors okay and jt can you help me\nunderstand\nhow you fell behind in the first place\nuh just like mistake that i made like uh\ni guess like uh when i was 16 15 like i\njust\nthroughout my secondary school um and\nlike just in high school uh\ni wasn't really very studious as a\nperson um\nyou know i didn't really work hard as\nwell uh like a lot of people keep\ntelling me like oh i'm smart you know\nyou\ndo it you know but like like yeah i just\ncan't i just couldn't study\nand like i just stick to games all day\nlike every day just playing games even\nlike during\nlike exams like when it was exam period\nlike during the exam day i was playing\nyeah i wasn't even studying yeah and\nthen that's how i got into\ncollege and the only reason how i got\ninto like the second year college was\nbecause often like a like a inter\nattitude interview assessment\nlike they assess you like if you're in\nthe third year college and you want to\nget the second year you can do this\ninterview where you can like soak\ncourses like also i wanted to stop\ncourse from\nlike i.t like computer stuff to like\npsychology like and drama and\ni applied psychology and drama so like i\ninterviewed there and\nlike in the polytechnic and then they\ngave it to me yeah then\nhow do you feel about that i think that\nwas like the happiest moment of my life\nwhen like they sent me the like email\nnotifications and they say like\nuh dear like dear jt congrats oh my then\ni just\nstarted freaking out like i was in a bus\nmy jaw dropped and everything i was so\nhappy\nyeah because i was then i was like yes\nfinally like you know\none step like further i'm like at least\ntake one step you know i'm not as far\nbehind now\nyeah and and so are you\nmoving on pace now that you're in the\npolytechnic college\num like slowly yeah i i i think i'm\ndoing\nquite quite well actually like maybe but\ni need to be better\nif not i just need to be like way better\na little bit but\nokay so help me understand\nwhen you say you're doing quite well how\ndo you determine whether you're doing\nwell or not\ni guess through my grades like okay so\nlike the max in terms of gpa is like\nfour right and like 3.79 now\nand so but in order to get like you like\npoly university like\nbecause from second tier day that's like\nit's very very hard\nto get in compared to if you're in a\nfirst year college from four\nuniversities\nand only universities they're like they\nhave like psychology and they're like\nmore reputable\nit's like only like two universities the\nthird one is like just like longer a\nlong way longer but uh\nso like uh yeah it's like you need to\nget like three point nine maybe\nlike three point like a high you want it\nso like essentially\nthis semester i have to get everything a\nbut like sorry i'm\nsorry like talking a lot by like just\ngiving more information but like i think\nthis is like elective\ni like it oh okay i did this like\nelective and i\nand then like uh like uh\ni got a b plus and i was like so sad\nabout it but like i'm trying to like\nwork on it like\nit's something that like trying to work\non like uh it's like accepting the\noh sorry i'm just gonna you know because\ngood because this is i just\ni just like note things that i've\nimproved on and like things i should\nimprove on\nsorry so like uh focusing on the process\nnot the outcome\nit's like i can't control getting an a\nbut you can be confident in my own work\ndone or like\ni accept the outcomes gained by\nvalidating the emotions of my outcomes\nbut like sometimes i feel like they\ndon't work as well\nsure or like i don't think even though\ni've been like working on it for like\na year now like i it's not as\nit's not it there's not much improvement\ni guess\nokay\ni i really like the level of detail\nyou're going into jt and by all please\npull out your phone whenever you want to\nbecause i think it's really helpful\num can i just have a second to think yep\nokay\ncan you um tell me a little bit about uh\nyou know\nwhy you you want to why you want to be\nthe singaporean version of dr k like\nhelp me understand what\nwhat appeals to you about that why is\nthat your goal\num i think i think i literally found my\ndharma because of you\nokay yeah yeah okay i'm noticing that\nhow how whenever i say that\nit sounds as though it feels my mind is\nlike liking me like that sounds\nstupid you know okay but sorry uh yeah\nyeah uh\nyeah i you you helped me for my dharma\nand i think this is just what i wanted\nto do and like i think\nlike uh like singaporean society needs\nit a lot\nright because uh we are very\nneurotographic and we are like go go go\ngo go you know we don't have time to\nrest it's just\nlike drilling it in very technical\nintegration you know just like\ni drill it in don't like don't stop you\nknow it's just this is how it is so like\ni want like\nlike so like most people they feel like\nthey don't have anybody talking about\nthings and i\ni want to offer that help to people and\nalso like how you're doing it like your\nhelp yeah you're doing like peer-to-peer\ncoaching and stuff like that which is\nreally so i want to like\nput people who are who know better than\nme in like terms of like uh how like uh\nlike maybe like\nx convicts fields like because they're\nthey will x-con convicts themselves you\nknow like then they can't be sure that\ncan't stop like i love that\nyeah so let's do it here because and\nalso\nbecause when i wanted to like be a\nhealthy gamer coacher\nit was it was not it was not legal when\ni tried to sign up\nin singapore's i mean like like from\nsingapore so i guess\ni just want to do it here cool okay so\nso why do you want to help other people\nlike help me understand what what do you\nwant to help them\ndo or see differently from the way that\nsociety is right now\num\nlike sorry can you just repeat the\nquestion yeah so so like\nso you said that the problem is that\nsingapore is like very like\na meritocracy and they like kind of\ndrill you to like you know\ndo this then do this then do this then\ndo this if you do all these things\nthen you are successful and you are a\ngood human being\nand if you don't do those things you are\na bad human being\nright that is that fair yep\nso how do you want to change that\nuh\ni just want them to tell themselves that\nthere are other pathways it's just going\nto take longer and you just have to\naccept it\nsorry so i just gave myself the answer\nof like\nmy work sorry sorry\nbut you know but like but for me i have\nlimited oh crap\ni'm saying like oh i have limited time\ni don't know man oh or maybe i\nshouldn't maybe i shouldn't do that\nbecause i don't even know how to combat\nthat if i\nyeah but i don't even know myself no no\nbut\ngood so you're doing you're doing great\njt right because like it starts with\nnoticing\nyou're like like the answer that you\nwant to give them is like the one that\nyou need to hear\nand then like why is that funny because\nthen as soon as you say that you realize\nokay this is the advice that i need to\nfollow\nand then like your mind is like when i\ntry to follow that advice your mind\ntells you\ndoesn't want to listen to it right yeah\nso so what does your when you say\nyou know it takes time you have your own\npath you know just keep persevering\nand what does your mind tell you in\nresponse when you try to tell that to\nyourself you can tell to someone else\nbut when you tell it to yourself what\ndoes your mind tell you\ndude you're not gonna yeah you're not\ngonna make it if you\nif you slack over you don't study you\ndid but you're not gonna have time\nlike uh there's no way because if you\nwanna do like like uh you can do like\nthe third university but you're gonna be\nlike\n30 by the time you you even get out of\nthe university then what you're gonna do\nlike 30 to just just to get a bachelor's\ni'm like okay\ni don't know what i'm supposed to do and\nthen that that can happen to me because\nlike\nokay this is very egotistic but like i\nthis goal is so big i\nlike all bigger than like the norm like\npeople like most people\nlike i hear like oh they just want to\nearn money they want get rich so they\ncan do everyone\nbut like this goal of helping people\nlike i i need to get there faster\nbecause\nbecause i need to help those people and\nif i don't help those people\nin time then it's useless\nlike oh like my life is like worthless\nokay because it all right yeah\nokay\nokay i'm gonna try one thing that's\nprobably gonna bounce off\nso like how old do you think you need to\nbe to help people\num what how old is too late\ni mean i can actually like like okay\nwhen you say help people\nlike uh i can help people now honestly\nin terms of volunteering and stuff like\nthat and i have done that\nbut it's just um like help people the\nway i want like the way you're doing it\nlike in need like in terms of you need\nlike good like\nsuccessful like education and you need\nto have like scholarships and stuff like\nthat\nin order to like enforce change in terms\nof like macro system levels like\nin terms of society and stuff like in\nsingapore's like i i need to have good\ngrades if not they won't listen to me\nright cause like i could like like like\nsomeone like a second year\nlike a college person like with a\ndiploma and applied psychology telling\nyou oh this is how you're supposed to do\nit when\nlike they're like people like in\nuniversities with masters already\nlike i mean how how old\nhow old tell me what\nwhat do you need how old do you need to\nbe and what kind of professional\ncertification do you need to be\ni calculated it would be 28 for masters\nand then hopefully i can work at the\nsame time and do my doctorate\ni'll be like 34 or something 34\n34 by the time i get my dog but\nlike 28 i can start helping people in\nterms of my master in terms of getting a\nmilestone yeah\nand and buy 30 are you on track by 34 to\nget your doctorate\ni hope so okay right yeah\nso like i i mean do you know how old i\nam\n38 yeah do you know how old i was when i\nfinished training\nuh no no\nlet me just make sure i have this right\ni was 36 when i finished training\ni don't know oh sorry uh i said\nwhat wait you need i'm doing this for\ntwo years from now\nyeah well i thought you like seeing\npatients for quite a while yeah so\nso much like masters so i finished\nmedical school at the age of 32\nbut i finished residency at the age of\n36.\nhuh go go\nso like like i said like i said right so\nso you're on track to be faster than me\nwhat does your mind tell you\nthat i want to help people faster as in\ni i yeah\nor like like i have to be faster or like\ni\ni don't know it just does many to be\nfaster okay so like\nyou are already on track to be faster\nthan dr k\nyou're gonna be you're on track to be\ntwo years faster than dr k and what does\nyour mind tell you in response to that\nuh it's telling me nothing he's just\nsaying okay cool yep uh oh wait\num\nuh yeah okay i don't know i feel\nsatisfied now\nbut i don't\nmy mind is like telling me like no it's\nnot enough because\ni like i'm trying to my mind is trying\nto discredit you by saying like\noh dude you are you're in the u.s\neducation system and i'm in the\nsingaporean education system it works\ndifferently you don't have the same\namount of opportunities\ni don't have the same amount of\nopportunities that you have okay good\ngood so now so the first thing to\nunderstand so i want you to notice\nsomething okay when it comes to feeling\nfallen behind and desperate the reality\nthe situation\ndoes not matter at all\nbecause here you are with your goal\nand i'm telling you you are two years\nahead of me\nyou're two years faster than i am and\nand your mind is gonna find\nsome way to like\nset that aside and discredit what i say\ndo you see that\nlike it doesn't i i could tell you jt\nyou're doing great\nand you'll find some way to tell me i'm\nwrong\nyou'll find your mind will find some way\nto keep you feeling desperate and\nashamed\ndoes that make sense yeah\nwe're doing it again yeah but i'm just\ntrying to notice it so like it will go\naway but like that's the problem because\nlike like\nyeah i'm just like noticing it right but\nlike sometimes it will just already just\nlike fades and then\nit comes back no like like oh god do you\nknow i did i did this like\nlike a few days ago when like my friends\nwere critiquing me about how i should\nimprove right so like\nuh i i was trying to notice that because\ni went to sleep by angry and i was just\ntrying to notice my anger\nand just like kept coming back so i\ncouldn't sleep for like three hours\nbecause i kept noticing it\nit was like so hot yeah yeah so it's\nit's really hard man\nso i think you're doing a good job and\nwe're going to try to help you okay so\nthe the key thing\nhere though is that a lot of times when\nwe feel like we've fallen behind\nwe think that something in the outside\nworld will\nmake it better right like if i fix\nsomething outside if i catch up if i get\na 3.79 if i get a 3.9\nif i do this then it'll go away we think\nthat that the solution to falling behind\nis changing something in the outside\nworld right\nyeah your mind is telling you i will be\nsatisfied\nwhen dot dot dot but what we can kind of\nnotice is that like\neven though you got accepted and you are\nsuper happy and you're getting a 3.79\nyou know and maybe it's not enough if\nyour mind is always going to tell you\nit's not enough do you see that\nyep even though you're making progress\nsounds like you're going to be okay\nactually but like your mind is like it's\nnot enough it's not enough so we have to\nrecognize is that an objective\nachievement in the outside world\nis not going to make you feel like\nyou've caught up\neven if you're telling me that you want\nto be dr k and that sounds grandiose\nlike fine whatever\nand then dr k is telling you you're\ndoing it two years faster than i am like\nthat should be enough\nright but it's not going to be which is\nwhy i said it's going to bounce off\nwhich is fine which is why i said it\njust so we can appreciate that it\nbounces off so this is where like the\nwork that you need to do has\nnothing to do with your external\nperformance\nit has everything to do with like the\nfeeling of falling behind and where that\ncomes from\nbecause it sounds like you're doing okay\nright like so it sounds like you weren't\na great student and then you've worked\nyour way up to a 3.79\nyou've got some work ahead of you and\nyou've got to shoot for a 3.9 will you\nmake it will you not make it like who\nknows\nbut like you may you know sometimes\nyou'll get a lucky break in the future\ntoo like you take enough shots\nyou open enough loot boxes and like\neventually you'll get\nyou know like some rare item\nand and you'll like i'm not i'm not\nworried about you jt\nso because i i think that like you know\nthis is where you say you got lucky but\nlike\nyou also it sounds like you had an\ninterview right\nyeah and and like sometimes in life like\nwe just have these opportunities where\nwe just\nhave to like you know crush it in a\nmoment and then we can catch a break\nand and so i think if it's been my\nexperience that like people will catch\nbreaks\nas long as you keep looking for them\nlike if you sit at home and like play\nvideo games all day like\nyou're it's gonna be really hard to\ncatch a break but if you're out there\nyou're trying you're applying to stuff\nyou're taking classes\nlike someone somewhere will like notice\nyou and be like okay let's give this guy\na chance\nright that's what happened like that's\nhow you got in because someone like saw\nsomething and they were like oh like\nthis guy really is not in person he is\ndifferent\nfrom what we see on paper\non paper he doesn't have much much merit\nbut this kid is a little bit different\nso let's give him a chance\nand i i do think that the world\nfunctions like that and if you keep on\nlike\nputting yourself out there that people\nwill notice that\nand like value that\ncan i say the comments yeah uh because i\nlike uh recently okay so like our our\nteachers like sometimes i do check-ups\nduring the holidays to see how we like\nhowever in terms of mental health and\nstuff\nand like like just now when you stay\nthere like yo\nyou're the way you're gonna progress the\nway how hard working on the way you do\nthis kind of things you you're gonna be\nfine\nbut like my teacher told me like like if\nyou wanna like\ndo great things like for example my\nfriend he was doing like he wants to do\nlike policy making in singapore right\nand like i started it but you need\nscholarships and stuff it's like i\nrelate what i'm doing like in terms of\nhow\nlike how grandiose is his goal is to\nmine so like equal\nit's like and she said like like you\nneed to have scholarships if not\nno one's gonna notice you if not like\nlike you're not gonna\nyou know you're gonna know where like\nit's only because he volunteered\nthat they're doing so many volunteering\nwork right now they're like like\nthey're like working they're doing so\nmany things like all these kind of\nthings like all these big things\njust so that they will get noticed like\nand i'm here like i'm not even\ni'm not not right now i'm not even\nvolunteering i'm just like studying\nright but but my my peer my friend like\nhe has been volunteering\nhis gpa is like way higher and this way\nhe'll probably get it and i won't okay\nyeah\noh i said yeah okay it's not that i\nwon't but like uh like i stand a lesser\nchance\nyeah so i think that makes sense\nso jt i don't think you are your friend\nyou're not one of them\nand and i think the harder that you try\nto be\nthe more you will miss out on who you\nare\nwhat does that mean because like so so\nthis is where like i know it sounds\nweird but like you don't need to be them\nlike you need to be you\n[Music]\nyeah sorry yeah go ahead\noh like yeah isn't like usually like i\nneed to be me but like\nyeah i was in but i still need to\nvolunteer i still have to do this\nstuff right if not i can't get the\nscholarship i can't get noticed\naccording to the teacher\nso so the we'll we'll get to that in a\nsecond\nright but like if you're not capable of\nvolunteering and studying at the same\ntime like can you do that\nokay so okay so that's what i'm saying\nif you're not good enough i know it\nsounds kind of weird but like that's\nwhere you need to start\nright so like what are you capable of so\nthat\nthere are there are a lot of different\nthings here so let me like let me\nsay there's two different tracks here jt\none is that\nyour personal sense of shame and\ndesperation\nis emotional and like if you want to\nunderstand like so\ni can say as much logical as i want\nto and it's gonna bounce off every time\nuntil you deal with that emotional thing\nif someone feels like they're unlovable\nsomeone else can try to love them as\nmuch as they want to and it just won't\nit will never land it'll never hit right\nit'll just bounce off over and over and\nover again\nso if you want to like discover your\nconfidence you have to start by like\nexploring where your shame comes from so\nwe can talk about your parents and stuff\nlike that\nand like you know what it was like\ngrowing up like where you started to\nfeel\nfall behind like you know you can tell\nme about how ashamed you felt and all\nthat kind of stuff\nand as we start to see because you kind\nof say that you know\nthe shame you you notice it and it comes\ndown and then it pops back up right\nso where is it coming from where is it\npopping from it's\nit's because your mind has that\nemotional energy\nfrom being 16 years old and getting into\nthat\nthird college the ide and you felt so\nashamed and then you started to play a\nvideo game\nso where did all that shame go it got\nburied\nand now what it does is pop up and the\nmore you played the video game the more\nyou buried the shame you felt behind\nother people you know then you were 17\nand then your friends were 17 the\nfriends that you used to be with when\nyou were 12\nthey started to grow and now every time\nyou compare yourself to your friend\nthere's more shame building do you see\nthat\nyep okay so like there's the getting rid\nof the shame down below which has\nmeans working through it the second\nthing to point out is comparison\nokay so comparison is a function of the\nego\nand the ego arises when you're\nexperiencing negative emotion\nso the more you compare yourself the\nworse this is going to be\nbecause if you think about it falling\nbehind can only\nhappen if you have a standard of\ncomparison\nokay then the third thing and don't\nworry jt\ndon't worry we're gonna calm your mind\ndown the third thing is there is a very\nharsh reality\nthat you live in a country that is very\ncomparative\nright we can say as much like dr k like\nyou can make me feel wonderful on the\ninside\nwe can deal with all the shame i can\nconquer my ego\nand at the end of the day when i apply\nfor something they're going to look at\nmy resume they're going to look at my\nscholarships they're going to look at my\nvolunteer\nsituations and they're going to say\nscrew this guy\nand who they're going to listen to is\nthe guy who's got all that stuff and\nthat is the world that i live in\ntrue so what do we do about\nthat right so like\nright so like these are the different\ntopics we can talk about because i i do\nthink that we could have a discussion\nabout\ngrowing up in a society that you say is\na meritocracy but it's not actually a\nmeritocracy\nso like it's it's an artificial\nmeasurement\nof merit right it's it's a\nmeasurementocracy\nbecause it's not real merit it's like an\napproximation so like\nour society has become more and more\ngeared towards\nwhat we can measure versus what is\nvaluable\nand we've started to confuse the two so\nlike if you look at the stock market\nlike\nif if a stock price is high that means\nthe company is doing well\nright that's what we started to do we've\nstarted to replace\nmerit and value with measurement\nbecause it's easier so it's like hard\nfor people to like get\nto know every student so what we do is\nwe give them a test\nand we say based on the test we're going\nto rank you\nand that's just the way the world is\nwhich i totally get\nright and i think that there's\nparticular like strategies and stuff to\nto navigate the meritocracy but like\nyou know i i think that if anything i\nmean jt you're 20.\nthe question is what is singapore going\nto be like 10 years from now\n20 years from now 30 years from now and\n40 years from now\nright huh\nyou wouldn't know you wouldn't know\nright so so and this is where i think\npart of the problem here is that\nsome of your goals i think are very\nartificial\nlike and this is where you can try to\nbe something that you can envision\nbut like i don't know if this makes\nsense but like once again since you said\nyou want to be like me\nat 20 years old what i thought i wanted\nto be i was completely wrong about\nright and and like the whole point of\nlike\nyou know like the way i became dr k is\nby like ignoring\nwhat the world was doing instead of\ntrying to live\nup to the world standard\nit's like being myself and the more i\nstarted to be myself\ninstead of chasing after what other\npeople wanted like\nthat's how i became me\nit's actually moving away from like\nwhat everyone wanted like it's like you\nknow quitting\na good position at harvard\nit's like that's what everyone wants\nlike you know when i graduated they were\nlike\nyou know because like even when you\nfinish you know there are tears right\nthere's like there's the good jobs\nand they're the medium jobs and they're\nthe bad jobs\nand since i did really well they offered\nme the good job\nand i was like no thank you so like like\nthat\nthat rat race that like that\nyou know that treadmill of like first\nyou have to do this and then you have to\ndo this then you have to do this you\nabsolutely have to play the game to a\ncertain extent like don't get me wrong\nbut like i wouldn't put i wouldn't get\nit you know i would strongly encourage\nyou to like realize\nthat you don't you know affecting policy\nlike that may change\nwhat you need to affect policy may\nchange\nyou know and this is the kind of thing\nwhere it's like you know\nanyway i mean you have no idea what the\nworld is going to send you like just\ntrust me on that one\nyou just you just have no idea\nyou know and and and this is where like\nlike this just to be blunt this is just\ntoo bizarre\nbut like recently someone put me in\ntouch with someone\nvery high in the singaporean government\nand and they're like they're like\ninterested in doing something around\nmental health in singapore\nright so like i have no i like it's just\na bizarre i don't know if anything is\ngoing to happen to it\nbut like it's very possible that i have\nno idea because\ni don't know what comes next but like\nit's very possible that like\nsome healthy gamer could move into\nsingapore and if healthy gamer moves\ninto singapore i would be like\nhey i know a guy what do you guys think\nmy point is i have no idea if that works\ni don't think we should rely on that\nexpectation\nmy point is that you just have no\n clue\nlike what the future holds and so trying\nto build a life\nbased on like okay this is what i've got\nto do and this is what i've got to do\nand this is what i've got to do\nso i wind up in this place and this is\nwhat i want to achieve is like the wrong\nway of thinking about it\njust the whole the idea of falling\nbehind is a mental construction\nit's not actually a real thing now i\nmean there's some reality to it because\ndo you need like a good resume so that\npeople will listen to you sure\ni'm not disputing that but you need to\nbe like fluid\nin the way that you achieve your goal\nand like if if you don't if you have a\n3.79 the question\nand if by all means go for the 3.9 like\nwork your ass off\nstudy really hard learn how to study\nbecause your friend learned how to study\nwhen he was 15\nor 12 and you like missed that part\nright\ni missed it too and and this is where\nlike i\ni also think you don't you don't have to\nbe big\nthis is another big common misconception\nlike the most gratifying work that i do\nisn't with like huge numbers well it's\nnot most it's all about even\nbut like this is why you know why do we\ndo this like i'm talking to you man\nlike what i care about is like talking\nto one person at a time i\nhave to talk to thousands of people\nthat's not actually what's fun it's\ntalking to you like i want to help you\nand whether the internet is watching or\nnot watching there may be an objective\ndifference in terms of the impact that i\nmake\nbut it doesn't that's why we stream but\nlike at the end of the day whether\nin my office or we're on the internet\nlike it feels good either way dude it's\nvery fulfilling either way\ndoes that make sense yep\nit's yeah yeah i'm just i'm just like\nprocessing everything you're saying and\ni yeah i'm just like because every time\nyou try to talk right and sometimes\nlike my mind will like shoot up so i'll\njust like try to notice it immediately\nthen like\nit just goes and then you go to the next\npoint it comes up there i'll just like\nnotice it so just try my best\nyeah it's just yeah i'm just thinking\nbecause like uh you took\nlike uh so if i can't remember a lot of\ninformation because i'm just trying to\nlike process it all\nit's just um like you tell me like okay\ndude you just\nfor example i give you like the example\nlike you told me like like studying\nright i learned how to study and i i\nhave learned how to study actually\nstudy quite well learn how to study\nquite well because of the guides that\nyou put out\nand uh but the thing is sometimes like\nthey they still get like it's still like\na plus or it's still like uh\nstuff like so i think like something\nlike yeah still comparing where i think\nlike\noh if i do what you tell me to do i'll\ni'll get the result that i want but it\ndoesn't add up\nyeah so so and and that's that's where i\nmean i i think you kind of like\nlike you know you're like you're going\nto tell people some someday\nright like let go of the result yeah\nand and and that's where it's it's hard\nman like don't get me wrong it's hard\nbut like you're you know you're growing\nyou're not in your final form yet\nand and you know i i can try to reassure\nyou i think that's not going to work\nvery well like it's only going to work\nso much but it's like\nyou know i mean you just you just never\nknow what's going to happen\nlike you just never know so i think\nbuilding a plan\nso and this is i mean it's not really\nyour fault because you know you probably\nyou have been conditioned right your\nmind has been taught\nthat unless you do a b c and d in this\norder\nyou will not succeed that there's a\nformula for success\nright and you're you're not living up to\nsnuff therefore you will not succeed and\nwhen like\n90 of people are telling you that of\ncourse you're gonna feel that way\nyep and and this is where it's kind of\nweird but like if you're talking about\nyou know changing policy like you have\nto be the example\nlike you can't be you know like\nyou know like yeah yeah dude exactly\nthat is exactly why like i'm trying to\nlike\nthat's why like that's what i'm trying\nto like buff myself up i mean i'm trying\nto like make sure that i don't have any\nof these kind of problems you know\nbecause like okay like like uh yeah it's\njust like\nlike this i'm trying to improve improve\nimprovement so that i can be the best\nversion so that i can help people you\nknow so that so that i don't have to\nlike\ndo this interview with you so you can\nhelp me you know i'm saying\nyeah so and this is where i mean i got\nto tell you man like\nthat's the whole thing is like wrong\nright because like what you're trying to\nlike you have this artificial\nconstruction of like\none day i'm gonna be this thing and i'm\ngonna be fixed\nand once i'm fixed then i'm gonna go out\nand i'm gonna help the world like it's\nnot how it works man like\nyou're never fixed you just gotta do the\nwork that you gotta do like there's no\nlike fixed is not a thing\nright like the world may tell you it's a\nthing like the world will\nabsolutely tell you that this is what a\nfixed person looks like\nand we can we our mind has been\nconditioned towards that\nbut i think jt like honestly i think\nyou're doing great we'll we'll get to\nsome of the other emotional stuff in a\nsecond but like i think you're doing\nlike you're doing the most that you can\nwhich is great which is perfect\nand this is where like i think you're\nliving your karma like you just weren't\nborn with like you know a high level of\nconscientiousness it sounds like do you\nknow what that means\nlike the five factorial stuff yeah\nyeah right so like some of us are just\nnot born with i wasn't born with a high\nlevel of conscientiousness either either\ni still\nsort of don't have one which is fine\nlike you can still be successful\nthe problem is that the world believes\nthat a particular kind of person\nis success but it's been my\noverwhelming experience that\nif you play the game like if you watch\nsomeone who's like playing like let's\nsay wow\nokay what do you play by the way uh\ni read league of legends uh monster\nuntil uh\nokay all right so so like let's say like\noverwatch right so like\nif if i'm watching someone who's like an\nawesome tracer\nright and i'm like they're like giving\neveryone right and left\nand then i'm reinhardt and i try to play\na tracer style game and i keep losing\ni'm like oh i need to like\ni need to be faster right i don't know\nwhy it's not working\nso your friend is like tracer and you're\nlike reinhardt you just have to play who\nyou are\nright and and i know it sounds kind of\nweird because the world is going to tell\nyou like it's it's like back to like i\ndon't know if you watch pro overwatch\nbut\nyou remember back when there was like\nthe three tank meta\nyep goats right so like like like so\nlike like the meta right now in\nsingapore is like a three tank meta\nand you're trying to play a dps and so\nyou can look at the meta and you can say\nthis is what success is because that's\nwhat the meta is the meta is the\nmeritocracy\nyou do this you do this you do this you\ndo this you do this\nbut over time the meta evolves and how\ndoes a meta evolve\njt no\nlike i just i just\ni went up because i would say i'm gonna\nsay like buff patches you know like\nthe the the company but then the company\nmeans the government that means the\ngovernment\nis they can change stuff and stuff like\nthat you're right\nso the meta can change through policy\nwhich means back to your original plan\nyou have to do really good someone has\nto change something somewhere not so but\nthe meta doesn't only change due to buff\npatches\nhow did the goats meta evolve that\nwasn't through a patch\nlike reducing the champions ability so i\ni i\nso the point i'm making is that like\nsure something got nerfed right but it's\na combination\nof buffs uh patches plus player\ninnovation\nbecause like it's not like someone you\nknow the patch happened and then\nimmediately people were like oh let's\nstart playing three tanks\nsomeone was like oh let me try\nsomething differently\nbased on the circumstance of the world\nand then something becomes op but that\nopenness\nis the circumstance that the world\ncreates\nfollowed by the innovation of thinking\ndifferently thinking outside of the box\nso like let me say no\nwait for like to like revolve around me\nno\ndude so this is what i'm saying so if\nyou look at healthy gamer's story\nlike the world was what it was right and\nwe innovated\nwithin the balance balance patch system\nof like the government\nso like there was like and like\nliterally there's like policy stuff that\nmatters here so we've like\ntalked to attorneys and like things like\nthat we've said can we stream we talked\nto twitch and we were like\ni'm a psychiatrist can i talk to people\non the is that allowed\nin the rules will the government can i\ndo this i talk to people\nin like you know the medical community\nand i'm like i have a license like what\ndo you guys think am i allowed to do\nthis\nand then we innovated the point is\nand now everyone's like you\nyou now you're just playing meta decks\nyou're like oh i'm going to be like dr k\nnow like following my meadow is my\ninnovation\nbut that's that's how the meta evolves\nmm-hmm right so and this is where where\nit's kind of weird but like i think that\nthe part of the thing and i know this\nsounds\ni'm going to say something kind of\nrandom so i was once in a class that\nlooked at\nnobel prize winning papers in biology\nokay so all we did in the class was we\nread\n12 papers that won the nobel prize\nlike 12 experiments and the really\nfascinating thing is like\nlike the you know what it takes to win a\nnobel prize\nis to like think off meta\nthat's like literally what it takes to\nwin a nobel prize\nthe whole meta is one way\nand then someone is like oh wait\nlet me think off meta instead of doing\neverything the way that things have been\ndone before\ni'm gonna try something different\nand so like that's what it takes to win\na nobel prize\nso there's a part of you that's like\ntrying to chase\nlike what everyone else is doing\nand that's fine for the plebs\nright but like if you if you really want\nto make an impact in the world\ni think you've got to step away from\nlike what you\nlike forget about what you want to\naccomplish\nand just like focus on who you are and\nwhere you are\nand then like opportunities will come\nlike you'll have you know like it'll\nclick\ni'm not worried about that for you it's\njust about\nconvincing you that like you can just\nlike be who you are\nand i i don't know how else to say it\nbecause i think we've already said this\nbut like\ni wouldn't be who i am without the\nfailure like it's such a\nit's just as important as the harvard\nwhat do you mean by like be who you are\nlike like or just accept that you are\nlike this like what does that mean\nthat's a good question so i think\nespecially in meritocrac\nuh societies like singapore india is the\nsame way\neveryone's like what the hell does that\neven mean\nright because like all we're taught is\nlike what we should be\ndoes that make sense yeah\nlet me just think about how to answer\nthat because it's hard\noh sorry no no it's it's it's the most\nimportant question um\nso you know what you want to be right\nyep what are you\ni'm just a polytechnic student\nyeah i'm just student and honey i'm not\nthere\nno i'll get there i i just gotta like\nkeep this pace and if and\nnot up yeah so so i i think that's\nactually like a pretty good answer so\nlike\nyou know islam is there's some emotion\nthere what's that\nyou feeling some emotion no not really\nsorry okay no no so i i think that the\nmore that you kind of accept\nthat i'm a polytechnic student i i would\nbe a little bit careful about the word\njust right so you said i'm just a\npolytech\nthat's just what you are it's not better\nor worse\nthan anything else which i know sounds\nweird in a meritocracy society\nbut like i know it sounds weird but like\nyou can't be\nanything but what you are\nlike how tall are you jt right\n172 cm uh five foot eight okay\ncan you be five foot ten\nuh with the proper shoes okay okay\ncan you can you be no no it's a good\nanswer can you be five foot six\nuh i don't know right so like\nso like when you when you go and buy\nclothing\ndo you buy clothing for people who are\nsix foot\nor five foot\num like yeah i guess like my size or\nlike maybe a little bit bigger\nyeah right and so but what if you want\nto be six foot\nwhat if i came to united jt so imagine\nyou succeeded in your goal\nand one day i come to you and i say i'm\nfive foot five\nand i want to be six feet so i keep on\nbuying six foot clothing\nand then why do you want to be six foot\nall right because\nsix foot is better than five foot and\nit's what i want to be so i'm i'm gonna\nmove towards that\nuh\nokay i'm just noticing the the metaphors\nthey're using and how it applies to me\nso explain that it's just it's\na different ball game it's just a\ndifferent game you can't\nbe this thing because you're just on\nthat thing\nor like you actually have to like show\nappreciation that\nthe piper is not a bad thing you know\nlike you stupid\nthere's no things that you can't do but\nlike like women like dudes who are\ntaller so let's be\nlet's be clear right well let's just\nassume that for a second i don't know\nthat's actually true but like\nthat's the way a lot of dudes think\nright so even if we say that six foot is\nbetter than five foot five\nthey're like there's studies that show\nthat height is correlated to\ncorporate advancement so the likelihood\nof you being a ceo\nis seems to be correlated with how tall\nyou are so let's even say that it's\nbetter to be six foot than five five\nwhat then uh\n[Music]\ni don't know there's like nothing you\ncan do actually because they're so\ninsistent on wanting to\nbe this thing even though they can't\nokay sorry right so so so\nand here's the thing is like if you want\nto succeed right let's say i'm\na five foot five dude and i want to find\na girlfriend\nthen dressing in six foot clothing\nis not gonna help\nright i have to play to my strengths\nlike like if it's the goats meadow like\nwe're gonna get three tanks like and\nforget about tracer like who cares\nbut we don't need a tracer right play to\nyour strengths\nthat's what it means to be who you are\nis you may objectively be worse than\nyour friend like\ni i know it's kind of weird but like we\nlive in this society where we say like\neveryone's equal like no they're not\nlike does every human being have\nis any human being worth more than\nanother human being no\ni mean yes sorry wait wait hold on i'm\ngetting confused i think\nin terms of intrinsic value they're\nwe're all the same\nbut in terms of like capability like\nwe're not\nright like some people are just like\nbetter at basketball\nlike some people are just like more\nsuccessful at life\nand i think that like if you're someone\nwho's fallen behind\naccepting that is the way that you\nreally start to shine\nlike you can still have a wonderful\nloving relationship if you're five foot\nfive\nyou just have to stop worrying about\nbeing six foot and just play to your\nstrengths and i think you'll be fine\nyou can still be a ceo at five foot\nseven even though\nheight apparently is an advantage but\nyou just have to accept that like you're\nplaying life with a handicap\nyou can still win but as long as you\nlike\npretend to live a life where you're not\nhandicapped\nand you get so caught up with the\nhandicap that you forget about the game\num what's your mind saying now\nthat um okay so like\nyou know like there's like peter kapha\nand right so like i'm very pita right so\nlike\nlike uh like so you you mentioned like\nmany times like these\npeta people are just like the ordinary\nlike just the average\nkind of people right in terms of\nstatistics in class or whatever\nand like the thing is like if i were to\nlike\nplay to my strengths like many people\nare like average and stuff like that so\nlike how can i play to my average\nstrength\nlike if i want to like innovation and\nlike must be powerful right like in\nterms of how you counter the ghost\nmethod it must be\nstronger than that meta right so how can\naverage\nsorry sorry i'm putting down myself but\nlike in a way but like\nlike how can average stats be better\nthan like other statistics\nso it's a good question so let's like\nanswer it in a weird way okay the first\nthing is that\nthe reason you're average is because\nit's an\namalgamation of different qualities\nyour total stat pool may be average\nbut there are some things that you're\ngoing to be better at so one thing i'm\nalready noticing is you have a very\nvery high level of self-awareness\nof awareness of your internal\nenvironment you're like in the top one\nto five percent of people i've ever\ntalked to\nso like your problem is that you think\nthat like okay but how does that help if\ni can't change it\nwhich is a good question i haven't quite\nfigured that out yet\nbut i i would say that the thing that\nmakes me the thing that i'm really good\nat\nis also self-awareness like that's the\nthing that i'm really the best at\nand so if we think about my ability to\nwork with people like my ability\nwill work with people is all based on a\nvery very careful analysis of myself\nthe problem is that this is the kind of\nthing that is not easily translatable\ninto external success like it took me a\nwhile to\ncraft my life to be suited\nto myself but i was able to craft it\nbecause i was aware of what i was\ndoes that make sense it's like playing\nthe long game definitely\nbecause the world is not you have to\nlike craft the meta of your life\nto suit your internal characteristics\nmy mind is telling me like oh my god i\ngotta wait again\ni don't like like uh like i just scared\nthat crafting is gonna take so long\nyeah yeah yeah you know\nyeah and so go ahead\nyeah i'll just go behind further but if\ni can okay if i try to innovate because\nbecause like oh yeah because when you\nmention like innovation i've always\ntried to do that in terms of my projects\nand assessments that they give\ni always try to innovate but when i\ninnovate i get like\nb pluses but and if i stick to the meta\ni get like a's\nso like so i'm like so scared now\nbecause like if i try to innovate in\nlike that in that context as well i'm\nscared that it won't work out\nsure yeah no i mean that that's that's\nthe problem right that's the problem\nwith changing the meta\nis that most people who try to change\nthe meta fail\noh this isn't like okay as in like\nbecause if i fail take\nit will take longer and i'll just have\nto try try again okay so now we see\nsomething really important now we're\nactually going to help you okay\nthe rest of it was for everyone else but\ndo you see how no matter what i say\nwe're coming back to this yep yep i see\nit\nokay so so now the question is what\nso how long have you felt like you're\nfalling be\nuh let me put it this way actually it's\nit's interesting because it's not just\nfalling behind i think we've actually\nstumbled upon something else\nhow long have you felt like you can't\nafford to fail\nonly recently actually or like maybe\nit's like more prominent\nwhen i actually when i actually got into\nthe second year college right\nwhen i got when i got to do what i\nwanted that was when i realized oh\ncrap yo like the universe has given me\nsomething\nand i'm gonna take it so i'm gonna use\nit properly and i'll use this\nlike rng like 0.1 percent like luck that\ni have and use it good\nbecause i'm so unlucky that i'll never\nlike even in games i'm always very\nunlucky so like\nif i even when i get 0.1 i got to use it\nto like the fullest potential if not\nlike i'm just wasting that you know\njt did you feel more\ndid you feel like you were more behind\nbefore you got into polytechnic or after\nyou got into polytechnic\nso how do you understand that because\num i guess in uh like in idea i was\nstill like\nuh like i i didn't really care as to\nwhat kind of direction i was going\nit didn't mean that well i i mean my\ngrades were still okay like 3.56\nbut like um only when\ni got into yeah only when i go into poly\nthere's many changes\nso let's think about that what would you\nexpect\nif you've fallen behind and you take a\nstep forward\nwould you expect that person to feel\nlike they're catching up\nslowly yes right right yep but how did\nyou feel\nwhen you got into polytechnic\num in terms of catching up uh\ni was\nokay sorry i'm just trying to fight my\nmy my inner thought because i'm like no\njust just just just shut up yeah it's\nit's like that was when i realized that\noh my\ngod i'm so far behind again or like i\nlike further behind i thought\nokay so\nyou feel like you're super far behind\nright oh my god the\nthe ipad of truth of knowledge\nokay i used to watch your online\nwebinars with this so cool\nokay hold on here's here's the problem\nokay\nso now let's say i'm\nlet me think about this okay so let's\nsay\num let me think about what these axes\nare\nso feeling\nof falling behind\nokay and progress\nall right does that make sense\nyes okay i see it so if we were to say\nlike let's say i'm behind right so my\nprogress is really low\nand so how far behind do i feel do i\nfeel really far behind or do i feel not\nvery far behind\nlike fall behind i guess right so this\nis where i am does that make sense\nyeah i feel super super bad because i\nhaven't made any progress\nand then as i make progress what should\nhappen to my feeling of falling behind\nit should go lower right yes\nwith me right and then at some point\nwe're going to even cross the x-axis\nthis is what the curve should look like\nokay so now let's talk about u\nso let's call this\nide and let's call this polytechnic\nokay when you were\nat ide is ite sorry\nyeah my bad okay i-t-e\nso when you were it let's just start you\nin the middle okay\nhow far behind did you feel when you\nwent to polytechnic\nor increased\nright so what can we deduce\nabout as you make progress how are you\ngoing to feel\noh good sorry it's just going to stay\nout\nit's going to peak and gonna continue\nforever\nso i know this sounds kind of weird but\nhow far behind do you feel\nright now where are you over here\nright like let's say you're like over\nhere\nbut what what this means is along this\nline the higher up you go on this axis\nthe worse you're going to feel i mean\nlike like\ndo you see like it's weird because it's\nthe opposite so what we can almost infer\nis that the more behind you feel\nthe better you're doing\nnow i know i know it doesn't make any\nsense but i'm just asking you to be\nscientific i'll explain why in a second\nwhy this happens but this is really\nimportant for you to understand\nthis is why you were terrified and i am\nnot\nbecause i understand this is what your\ncurve looks like\nand that the higher up you go on over\nhere\nactually what i'm paying attention to is\nthis and i see this for sure\nthat's why i'm not worried bro i'm\nreally not\nthe problem is this is the way that your\nmind interprets progress\nnow we're gonna explain why this happens\nbut like does does this make sense to\nyou\nyep it does okay so\nnow let's explain it okay i'm gonna\nuh i'm gonna stop sharing okay we're\ngonna go back\nso it's a it's a really common problem\nokay\nuh and then i know i know it sounds\nweird but\nso when you're in\nwhen you were at ite right you weren't\nactually playing the game\nyep that was it so it's impossible to be\nbehind\nwhen you play when you're not playing\nthe game it's like\ncan't be behind if you're not you're not\ntrying\nand so this is the really dangerous\nthing about feeling like you've fallen\nbehind\nas you start to catch up you begin to\nrealize like so if i'm at the bottom of\na mountain\nand i'm not gonna climb it like i don't\nhave very far to go\nthere's a ten thousand foot mountain i'm\nsitting at the bottom like yeah i'm just\ngonna play games all day\nlike i don't i'm not gonna i don't need\nto climb the mountain like it i\ndon't need a gold i'm just chilling\nscrew that like sure you're filled with\nshame and stuff you're playing video\ngames all day\nthere's a land center that's at the base\nof the mountain you're just kind of\nhanging out there\nit's no big deal something dangerous\nreally happens\nas you start climbing the mountain then\nyou begin to realize oh crap\nonce you climb a thousand feet then you\nlook up and you say oh i have nine\nthousand feet to go so this is really\nreally tricky\nbut if you have this some scar of\nfalling behind\nas you make progress success\nmakes it harder\nactually making progress makes the\nmental feeling\nso much worse it's really paradoxical\nbut once you understand it actually\nmakes perfect sense\nwe did an interview like over a year ago\nwith a guy named crucif\nthat i think is a really fantastic\ninterview i don't know if it's on our\nyoutube channel\nbut crucif is a guy who is really\noverweight and he was like falling\nbehind like he was like\nstuck in a lot of ways and he had this\nreally interesting thing where like he\nwould\nlike dig really deep fight his inner\ndemons and then would like start to lose\nweight\nand he would do good for a week or two\nand then like\nat the two-week point he felt like\nreally really bad\nand we we almost called it like a rubber\nband like he was attached to something\nlike with\nwith like a rubber band and then he\nwould run away from it\nand the farther he ran away from it the\nincrease\nthe tension of the rubber band and he\nwould come snapping right back\ndoes that make sense yep and so that's\nkind of like what you're doing too is\nlike as you're actually making progress\nin a weird way you feel like you're\nfalling behind\nmore and more and more and more\nbecause now that you're in polytechnic\nwhat do you do\nyou compare yourself to your friend\nbut when you were in ite you weren't\ncomparing yourself to him as much\nand then what happens is like let's say\nyou get into university\nand if you're not careful\nand like you used to compare yourself to\nthe people in university\nright or maybe but then once you become\none of them\nyou're going to find something else to\ncompare yourself to and then\nas you move on you're going to find\nsomething else even when you start\nmaking policy\nand you are have the same job title as\nyour friend\nyou're going to find someone else to\nmake a comparison to\nthis is why people like i'll work with\npeople in investment banking it's really\ncommon in banking\nbecause they get a promotion and they\nwant to get the next promotion you want\nto get the next promotion you want to\nget the next promotion\nthat feeling of falling behind jt you\ncarry\nwithin you and your mind will find\nwhatever kind of comparison it needs to\nmake\nit'll find like you know thousands of\npeople\nwhy do you compare yourself to this\nfriend\nbecause it reinforces the feeling of\nfalling behind\nthe feeling of falling behind is its own\nentity\nthat will push aside any data\nthat makes it feel weak\nand will latch on to any data that makes\nit feel validated\ndoes that make sense yep\nthey're just discrediting like my\nachievements and just uh focusing on my\nnegatives and what you improve on\nyeah yeah you do that right yeah\nright so so so like you can and\nyeah sorry yeah go ahead no no isn't it\nbecause\nbecause like i i i always thought that\nit wasn't like a bad thing that i'm\ntrying to make improvement because i\nalways draw them down on my phone like\nwhat i'm supposed to improve on\ni yeah i don't know i guess i didn't\nknow it was like\nmale adaptive so so it it's not a bad\nthing the question\nso all of these things jt in your mind\nare not bad\nthe only thing that's bad is is who is\nin control\nso like i'm not saying you should stop\ntrying to improve like\nyou should absolutely try to improve the\nquestion is\nis that desire for improvement coming\nfrom a place of this is what i need to\ndo to catch up\nor is it an improve is it about\nis this what i need to do next right\nthese are two very different things so\ni'm i'm gonna\nbust out the ipad one more time okay so\nnow like here's the tricky thing\nso right now when you think about\nimprovement\nthere are two ways to think about\nimprovement okay\none is a goal focus so this is like the\nfuture\nthis is your goal this is this is your\nfriend\nso when you think about improvement are\nyou trying to go from here to here\nbecause this is a this is an improvement\nout of a deficiency does that make sense\nyep like so improving from here to\nhere is fine like ask like being in the\npresent and saying what is one thing i\ncan do to\nmake one step forward that is present\nfocus this is what you're looking at\nthis is where i am this is who i am\nthis is where i am i need to you know i\ni have a 3.79\nand i need to make it a 3.9 that i think\nis a healthy improvement\nbecause this has to do with your goal\nright this is like\nwhere i am this is the next step that i\nneed to take\nbut if your goal depends on this over\nhere\nif this is where you are if you're in\nthe future\nthen what you're going to create is no\nmatter this is the only stuff you could\ntake dude this is how long your leg is\nright\nthis is your leg you can only move this\nmuch\nand if this is your goal if you move\nthis much\nthis is going to be not enough\ndo you understand so every step\nyou take what is the thought in your\nmind\nnot enough not enough\nif your mind is over here so in a\nbizarre way\nthe more you move forward the more\nbehind you feel\nbecause what is the emotion that you're\nreinforcing within yourself\nwhat is the some scar you're building\nnot enough\nit's never enough it's never enough\neven though you're making progress\nso what you need to do is like i know it\nsounds like this is where we got like\npeople say this really simple stuff like\nfocus on the present\nlike yeah i would like why how like\nwhat's the deal with this is why this is\nimportant\nbecause as long as you are thinking\nabout your end goal of being dr k it's\nnever going to be enough\nright jt you will never be me nor should\nyou try to\nbecause like the patch like the meta and\nthe patches like\ni arose in a particular meta that meta\nis gonna change\nby the time like you're ready\nso you shouldn't try to be me you\nshouldn't try to be your friend you\nshouldn't try to be\nanything really just be who you are and\nfocus on the next step\nand recognize that even though you're\nmoving forward you're gonna feel\nlike it's not enough\nbut like all of that i don't know\nhow to say this man like it's all\nwrong it's all false it's all a\nconstruction of the mind\nbased on this idea of falling behind\nbecause here's the problem is like this\nis where you are\nlike this is where you are that's it\nthere's no falling behind like this is\nwhere i am like\nthat's it if i say i've fallen behind\nthis much now i've created\nan artificial construction if i've\nfallen behind this much now i've created\nan artificial construction\nright so you're 20 years old and you're\ncomparing yourself like you're hanging\nout with 18 year olds\nso maybe like that's the gap here\nokay but like it doesn't matter like all\nthis stuff is false like this is just\nwhere you are if you're 20 year old\nin polytechnic with a 3.79 gpa your road\nforward\nis absolutely the same whether you fall\nin behind or not\nthe big difference is that one of these\nthings\nis going to help you anytime you take a\nstep forward\nand one of these things is going to make\nyou feel worse every time you\ntake a step forward\nyep i see it\nthen how do i combat that that some scar\ni guess or like like how do i combat\nthat\nthat that that that fear of falling\nbehind off or like not or telling myself\nthat\nactually i'll just go on my own pace you\nknow and stuff like that\nlike how do i combat the fact that i\ntell myself that no enough\nyeah okay so so good so the answer\nis you don't combat it\nso what you need is not to combat\nyourself\nyou need compassion towards yourself\nso what i want you to imagine is like\nyou've become successful okay so you're\ndr jt and there's like a 20 year old\nwho's going to come to you and is going\nto be like dr jt\ni've fallen behind and like how\nwhat are you going to tell him like\nwhat have you fallen behind on okay sure\nyeah so like ask yourself questions\nright that's good and then what\nlike i guess like identify what i'm\nfalling behind on\nand whether or not that that like factor\nor falling behind is\nis uh changeable in any way okay so\nlike so like in terms of my age or like\nmy height or like uh\nor falling behind in in grades it it's\njust like\nit's just that it's just that you just\nhave that\nyep you're you're that's\nyeah my mind tells me that oh my then\ni'm supposed to be happy with being\nthis way or like but what if i want to\naim higher you know\nhigh standards so let's\nroll reversal okay\nbut i i'm i'm 38\nand i've fallen behind dr jt\nwhat should i do\ncan you help me\ni uh\nsorry uh i'll i'll yeah i can uh\ni don't know where to start but it's\njust\nwhat have you fallen behind on or like\nlet's say maybe like you're too late\nno no yeah so i want to be i want to be\na professional dota player\nbut i've wasted the last 15 years of my\nlife becoming a\na doctor what a waste oh sorry uh\nare you like taking any steps to improve\non it in terms of\nlike maybe you're playing a lot and\nstuff like that no i actually\nuninstalled dota a week ago\noh then why do you uh what do you have\nthis worry about\nwanting to to like what do you just\nworry about\nfalling behind when you're not like\ntaking steps to improve on it\nthat's a really good question i i i see\nlike that's that's good right like\nthat's that's great\nso like like just inquire\nright like and so i i could say but i i\nwant to be a dota player and then you\ncan point out that like if you want to\nbe a dota like a pro dota player like\nyou know install dota that's the first\nstep\nright and that's what you would tell me\nto do i i mean\nmaybe you're going to tell me that's not\ngoing to be possible and you can't\nbecome a dota pro at your age which i\nprobably can't\nyeah right so so so if you it so like if\nyou would tell me that then like what\nwould you say to me like do you think i\ncould become a pro dota player at my age\nwhen there's like such a bad\npsychologist slash psychiatrist if i\ntell you\ndo not but like realistically like no\nright you can't you can\nyou can try you can always try your best\nand see how it plans out for you\nyou know like and then offer them like\nthis these ways that they can help but\nlike\nin the end if it doesn't work out you\njust have to like accept it\nor like yeah yeah right so i think you\nknow what you have to tell yourself and\nthis is the kind of thing where it's\nlike\nyou know when when you when that voice\ncomes up and says this is not enough\nwhat i want you to recognize is that\nlike that voice is a part of you but it\nis not the whole\nyou right and so what you need\nin that moment is actually like some\ndegree of like validation\nand reish like validation and faith\nactually so you can say you're right\ni am behind\nand i'm gonna keep moving forward anyway\ni don't need to catch up\ni just need to move forward\nand then the voice is going to tell you\nbut it's never going to be enough\nand so then you're going to tell the\nvoice you're going to say you may be\nright it may never be enough\nso what should we do about that\nright like talk like recognize like like\nwhat are you gonna do like so\ndon't argue with it be like yeah you're\nright like i can never\ngo back in time and be 15 and learn how\nto study well\nand therefore i will always be\ntwo years behind my colleagues\nor four years behind my colleagues i'm\ngonna be behind for the rest of my life\nnow what\nright so yeah what is your mindset\nit's not you saying nothing yeah it's\nlike it doesn't have an answer for it\nexactly that's how you disarm it\nit's weird right\nyeah i always thought awareness would be\ngood or like just noticing they would\ndisappear\noh yeah no no it is good it is good\nyou're chipping away at it\nthe problem is that every time like some\nbattles it wins and some battles you win\nawareness is helping but every time you\nmake that comparison every time you take\na step forward\nit actually gets reinforced because you\ntell yourself it's not enough it's not\nenough it's not enough\nso you are you are shrinking it and also\nfeeding it at the same time\n[Music]\nno wonder there was no progress see no\nthere was problems\nyeah i mean you've come a long way dude\nright because like you use it sounds\nlike you used to play games all day\nyes like all the yeah and\nhow many hours a week do you play now uh\nnow it's the holidays so like\nbut like obviously like because like i\nstudied in the morning right so like i\nstarted like four hours or like two\ntwo three hours and then i was just\nstarting because like\nmy mind doesn't attack me anymore so\nyeah it's good yeah\nyeah man like do you do you not get like\nhow enviable you are\nto so many people who are watching right\nnow like they would kill for that\nyeah but suddenly oh all right my\nmind's gonna discredit me again but it's\njust like\ni have to do that if not i don't if not\ni can't because like\nnormal people like the way i'm starting\nright now is like i'm revising the\nrevising so like\nlike i'm triple revising so that when\nthe revision comes i might triple revise\nso that i know because i'm not that\nsmart right\ni can only rely on my hard work like\nbecause that's why i need that thing\nother people they don't really need to\nstudy a lot like this a little bit\nadvocate\nbut like just yeah i need to do it\nyeah good i i don't think that that's\nbad at all i love that statement\nyou need to do jt what you need to do\nthat's how you will be successful\ni need to do it because i need to do it\nother people aren't that smart who the\n cares\nwhether you're smarter or they're dumber\nthat is irrelevant\nwhat what matters is what you need to do\nand every step of the way if you want a\nstep-by-step guide to being dr\nk it's do what you need to do and don't\nworry about what anyone else is doing\nlike you have to play the game right\nlike doing what you need to do it's not\nlike i just wake up one day and like\nhere i am no like i have to you know\nhave to work hard i have to decide like\nokay i'm going to go to medical school\nbecause it's what i want to do\nwhen i when i went into medical school i\nwasn't even going to be a psychiatrist\ni wanted to do oncology and i wanted to\nlike save people's lives\nwho had cancer and then like when i\nthought about being a psychiatrist like\nmy family was like\nyou're joking right\nso they're like why would you want to be\nlike\nyou're joking right\nso the world is going to tell you like\nthat oncologists and definitely\nyou know the world says this a lot that\noncologists are worth more than\npsychiatrists\nbecause cancer is real and if you want\nto be a real doctor like that's like\nhelping people with cancer because how\nmuch more of a doctor can you be\nso forget about the world man and like\nyou just do you\nand like walk your path every single day\nand recognize that like\nyou know you're gonna feel behind and so\nbe it you are\nwhat are you going to do about it you\ngot to start somewhere\ndon't fight that voice like you're doing\nnotice it\nyou know you can even like thank it in a\nweird way right because\npart of the reason that you've gotten to\nwhere you are is because it has told you\nthat this isn't enough and it drives you\nforward\nso try like different things which is\njust like\nacknowledge right be like yeah like i've\nfallen behind recognize that\nso when you're like 35\nand starting university\nyou know like like there's gonna be\nthere\nhow did you respond to that\nshock i'm just like i'm just like maybe\nit might be real dude\nlike yeah maybe right i'm just like that\nwhat you're telling me now is like\nacknowledge it and stuff like that right\nbecause but like i think like similar to\na lot of interviews\ninterviews they've done right most of\nthem don't want to change this stuff\nright\nbecause like it's like it's like\nproductive for them even though it's\ntoxic in a way\ni'm just scared that if like i debate it\nright like talk to him and stuff like\nthat right\nthat won't give me the drive to do like\nwork as hard or like work super supply\nyeah yeah so\nso so that's why i'm saying once again\nnot don't get rid of it\nyou should be in control of it it should\nnot be in control of you\nright so recognize that the feeling like\nyou've fallen behind\nis like a temporary buff\nthat comes with like a long-term debuff\nright so you do use it and you should be\ngrateful so like recognize that there's\nlike\na an 18 year old kid inside you\nwho's terrified that he's never going to\nbe enough and what i would encourage you\nto do is\ntalk to yourself the way that you would\nto a younger brother\nwho feels like they've fallen behind\nright like you want to be encouraging\nyou also don't want to like lie to them\nyou don't want to say like oh no\neverything will be okay like\nyou're beautiful and i love you like\neverything will be fine no you're gonna\ntell them like hey man\nlike you are behind but like you gotta\nyou gotta start somewhere\nand i have faith in you you can do it\nlike you've shown me that you've come\nthis\nfar you went from like ite to\npolytechnic\nyou have a 3.79 gpa almost 3.8\nyou need to shoot for a 3.9 so you got\nto start working your ass off\ni'm proud of you for even on your\nholiday or whatever\nlike it sounds like you study two to\nfour hours a day\nand you're revising things for the third\ntime which is awesome\nand i don't know if you're ever gonna\ncatch up but\nif you are i think revising things three\ntime is the way that it's gonna happen\nwhat does what is your voice what does\nyour mind say to that\nyeah i just have to keep going at it but\nyeah i'm just thinking like when do i\nlike allow it to like like uh like uh\nlike buff me and when do i like i cause\nit's very hard for me to notice when\nit's a debuff and when it's above\nbecause like sometimes i just think that\nit's just a debuff and that debuff\nkind of like creates a new buff of\nmoving forward\nand then yeah that will make me how do i\nidentify that yeah so\nit's generally speaking you want to get\nrid of this\nokay generally speaking but it's going\nto take time\nand i have to be really careful because\ni'm trying to give you\nso you keep on asking me questions about\nthe future and i'm trying to avoid\ngiving you\nlike answers about the future you're\nlike how do i tell you just you just\nkeep doing what you're doing man don't\nworry about it basically\nbut generally speaking i do believe this\nis a negative some scar\nand in like just about everyone that\ni've worked with where we've worked\nthrough\nfalling behind when they no longer have\nthat mental complex\nthey start to do better now the problem\nis that if i tell you that\nyou're gonna cr your mind is gonna\ncreate a new goal and then you're gonna\nstart telling yourself oh i need to get\nrid of falling behind i need to get rid\nof falling behind i'm not getting rid of\nit fast enough i'm not getting rid of it\nfast\nenough and it's just gonna the whole\n cycle is gonna start over again\nbut if you really want an answer like\nyou need to get rid of it\nbut just when i find that i'm scared\nall right i mean so this is where\nyou know i think it's like it's a whole\nother conversation but\nyou know i i'd say like it goes into how\nlong have you felt desperate\num actually forget about that we're\ngonna go we're gonna go\ntry to speed run this okay so tell me\nabout your romantic relationships\nuh i've only had one but it wasn't\nreally real\nand it wasn't it wasn't really like like\nuh\ni mean like i don't really consider it\nlike like real stuff because it was\nreally toxic and bad\nand that's it that was like six years\nago\ni had like oh wait like four years ago\ntwo years ago okay\nand how do you feel about like have you\nfallen behind in terms of like\ngirlfriends relationships you're\nheterosexual\nyes okay uh\nrolling around that uh i don't know i\njust go on my own pace i'm like\ni mean it doesn't really affect me like\nwhether or not i'm singing a lot\ngreat okay so like that's that's good so\nso it doesn't seem to apply there\noh but sometimes it it comes up\njust sometimes like it it will come up\nlike my\nlike my feeling of loneliness and stuff\nnow i'll try like notice that because\nlike sometimes it will\naffect my actions and how i interact\nwith people\nhow do you mean like okay let's say like\nokay my best friend right so like i'll\njust like\nlike i'll just complain to him that i'm\nsingle and i want to change it and stuff\nlike that\nand they will give me solutions there\nlike then after once i notice it i'm\njust like you know actually you know\nit's just like is this how i feel\nsometimes sometimes it comes out like\nyeah it's just a thing it's not really\nhow i feel\nit goes back down yeah cool so like\nlike over time are you feeling the\nloneliness grow\nor shrink or stay about the same\num\ni guess now i would say it's drinking\nactually yeah i'm quite like\nokay with it yes so so i think the big\ndifference if we look at\nfalling behind right when it comes to\nyour professional\ncareer academic stuff like that i think\nyou do a lot more things to feed the\nsamskar\nwhich paradoxically is what we talked\nabout with like moving from\nite to polytechnic you felt so much\nrelief\nand you were like oh crap i've fallen so\nfar\nnow i'm playing the game like i just\nstarted the race like everyone else\nstarted a few years ago\nand i'm starting now right\nand so i've like missed like the whole\neveryone's like ahead of me and i'm\nstarting late\nso so i think the relationship is\nactually a really good example of like\nhow to do it\nwell right because like it's interesting\nbecause you're doing all the stuff that\ni'm telling you to do\nprofessionally because you're saying oh\ni'm just lonely like you don't tell\nyourself\noh i shouldn't be lonely or i need to be\nwith someone you're just like\nhey sometimes you feel lonely and like\nthe reason i feel lonely is because i'm\nalone\nthat's okay like it'll work itself out\nhopefully eventually\nright you just kind of chill with it\nit's just like there\nyou're like does it is it feel bad yeah\nbut like you don't your mind does not\nfeed off of that does that make sense\nyeah yeah\nwhereas with falling behind your mind\nlike really feeds off of it right and\nstarts like\nlike oh my god then this is gonna happen\nand this is gonna happen and then i'm\ngonna do this and this is gonna have\nnever gonna be enough and look what that\nguy's doing look at that like you don't\ndo that when it comes to loneliness you\njust kind of acknowledge the feeling you\nsit with it whereas there are definitely\npeople who have it reversed right\ntheir professional career is like going\nokay but when it comes to their romantic\nlife their life is like oh my god i've\nfallen so far behind like\ni know i'm okay like with my job it's\nlike yeah like i didn't get promoted\nlike who the cares\nyou know i'll get there eventually and\nthen when it comes to personal i feel\nlike i'm gonna be alone forever like no\none's ever gonna like me like i don't\nknow what to do\nlike let me i'll give you more realistic\nthoughts it's not i'm gonna be alone\nforever it's like\nother people learned how to date in high\nschool and i did not\nother people learned how to date in\ncollege and now i'm 25 years old\nand i don't even know how to date\nlike it's gonna be so hard for me to\never find anyone because like\neveryone has more experience than i do\nand like i missed that boat\nand now i'm screwed i've fallen so far\nbehind\nright but your mind doesn't do that it\nsounds like when it comes to dating i\nwas hoping it would and then we would\nyou know get an easy answer but in an\ninteresting way i'd say\ndo you see the difference between your\nprofessional stuff and your dating stuff\nand how you respond to your mind\nyeah yeah\nso yeah so i i would say\njt there are two ways to deal with the\nsome scar basically okay\none is to notice its action in the\npresent you actually don't need to go\ndigging into the past and you can just\nwork on it every time it arises\nthe second way is to dig into the past\nusually what we do on stream\nis actually digging into the past but\nthe reason that i\nkind of went this way with you today is\nbecause i think you're actually\ngenuinely really good at noticing in the\npresent\nso this is something that most of the\nguests that we come on i actually don't\nknow if they're capable or not but\nit feels easier it feels like i have to\nteach them so much more\nto do what i did with you today\nit's way easier to ask people like you\nknow\nhow their dad didn't get you know get\ngot their brother a\nnintendo switch for their birthday and i\ndidn't get a nintendo switch and then\ni felt a lot like it's easier that way\nbut\num i don't know that we're gonna have\ntime to really\nopen up that whole discussion and i also\ndon't want to lose\nanything from what we've gained by like\nmoving on\nhow does that sound to you yeah i think\nthat sounds very fair i'm also gonna\nlike revise this later anyways like just\nsee it\nany tips i can improve on later oh yeah\nyeah\nquestions um\nis there any like specific meditation to\nlike stop this because like sometimes\nlike\nthe meditation i do is like i don't\nreally think it addresses it as much\nor like it just like like relieves my\nit just released my neurotism for like a\nperiod of time yep yep so let me let me\nthink about that that's a good question\num\nwould it be easier if i inform you of\nthe meditation that i do\nsure uh okay sorry just let me put up my\nthoughts\nuh i do like yogic sleep on an\nalternative day\nand then another day i'll do like uh\nlike\nthe mantra that you gave and then also\nthe\nuh rum sorry ram bam\nbom rum thing yeah okay\nokay so um\nokay damn dude you're\nyou're a real tryhard bro yeah i'm sorry\ni'm a smithy\nsweaty neck i'm like a it's impressive\nman\nokay so let's talk about\nokay so since you have some background\nwe're gonna this is great\nokay\nso i'm gonna give you advanced versions\nof two of the practices that you're\ndoing\nyes okay okay so the first is yoga nitra\nso what you need to do is develop a sun\ngulp\noh i have okay\ni am capable\ntricky tricky tricky tricky tricky oh so\nokay so\nokay tricky sorry tricky tricky so\nthis is going to be subtle okay\nso the weird question\num so let's think about this okay\nyou are capable involves what\ntime\nwhat does that mean so like capability\nis about\nwhat it's it's a\ni don't even know how to ask this it's\nit's so subtle but that\nsun gulp is exactly incorrect so like\ncapability is about what you are going\nto become\nit's about catching up\ndoes that make sense it's a potential\nthat is not realized but one day you\nwill be\nright one day you'll catch it's like the\nexact wrong thing\nit and it's it's such a good i mean i\ndon't blame you for picking it i think\nit's beautiful that you picked it\nand that you shared it and that you were\nlike here's the things\nit's like perfect it's like karmically\nperfect but do you see how like that is\nreinforcing the wrong thing\ni did not realize that yeah and you're\nnot going to right this is why some\ngulps are usually given by like teachers\nright because like and this is like but\ndo you see like\nand this is really why like this\nmeditation stuff is shouldn't be taught\nover the internet but like\nit's a good example of something that\nseems really positive\ni we can totally understand why your\nmind generated it because it's like\nexactly what your mind wants\nright it's the dream that your mind is\nattached to and it's saying\nif i do this practice i will catch up i\nwill achieve my dream\ni will get there one day i will climb to\nthe top of the mountain i am capable of\ngetting to the top of the mountain\nbut the eyes are still at the top of the\nmountain instead of at the sep\nthe next step that you need to take\nso let me just think about that for a\nsecond so we gotta\nremap your sun gulp\nuh does that make sense you with me yeah\nyeah yeah\num\ni always thought it was so helpful\nbecause it was such a good buff\nlike i've used it so much so yep\nyeah so i think it is a good buff and a\ndebuff\nyeah right so so so it's it\ni think it's like it's hell like it's\nthere's no doubt in my mind that it's\nhelped you\nand i think like time to let that go\num i think this is gonna be\ntoo far for you but\none thought that comes into my mind\nwe're gonna find a different one this is\ngonna create too much tension\ni think if if you could replace it with\ni don't need to be capable\nokay i will try that but but how do you\nhow does your mind react to that\ni think uh based on this interview i\nthink uh my my mind has kind of\naccepted it okay i'll just try it\nbecause it's like something new right\nmaybe my work\nokay let me try to come up with\nsomething better um\num so you can do\na mantra of soham\nokay so so is gonna be\nyour inhalation if you close your eyes\nand you just listen to it\nyou'll you may hear\nsomething like and then the inhalation\nand exhalation you may be able to hear\nthat\nbut what soha means is i am that which i\nam so it it\nyou just you are you and like it sounds\nkind of weird but like in your own\nbreath\nyou can like you know when you breathe\nand you just like feel yourself like\nthat's all you are\nso i would say you can use that as a uh\nso the sun cult will be like\ni am what i am period\nokay um wait so do i change the mantra\nas well because like i do the\nbecause i think you gave it when you\nwere interviewing the\nthe russian asian something like that a\nhome brahmasmi\nlike me is not what you want\noh okay so okay so yep\nyep so a ramos means a little bit\ndifferent\nso um\nuh yeah so like you're you're i would\nsay like if you're going to repeat\nan english or i don't know what your\nnative language is but like a sun help\nalong the lines\nof something like i'll get there\nor what i am is good enough or i am what\ni am\nperiod like like you\nlike so if you like i\nam what i am and then in terms of your\nmonth or practice i would change that to\nsoham\nso okay sorry oh sorry yeah go ahead\noh uh because like uh so like it's like\nbecause i want to get this right because\ni also use the beats right when yep\nbecause you say like there's like buffs\nand stuff\nso like i i use my the pre beats and\nlike so i just\ninhale and then like i say so hump and\nthen i\nexhale and then i move on like to the\nnext yep so so this is where we're gonna\ngo to advanced practice okay\nso so so hum so you can say soham\nand then what i want you to do is with\neach bead i want you to hear\nsoham within your breath\nso close your eyes okay do i get the\nbeat sorry is it okay if i get the beat\nyeah you can get the beats\nokay all right all right okay so\nclose your eyes\nokay can you hear me if\nyou have your headphones off yeah i have\ni have you on speed\nokay okay so\nso close your eyes sit up straight\nactually let me go get let me go get a\nset of beads hold on\nokay so we're gonna teach you guys japa\nokay\nso i gotta okay so let's do\na quick refresher this is the guru bead\nokay the guru beat is like going to be\nat the end\num and what we want to do is in\ngenerally speaking your right hand\nyou want to hold the bead between\nyou don't want to use your pinky finger\nor\nyour index finger so what we're going to\ndo is\nrotate it between the fourth finger the\nthird finger\ni know it looks hard\nsorry try it like this\nall right i'm just trying to copy it\nfully\nit i know it sounds kind of weird but\njust move it\nwithout using your index or your pinky\nfinger\nokay i see it and then it's going to be\neasy okay\nso what we're going to do is\ni don't know how many beads your mata\nhas but in the hindu tradition they have\n108\nso we're going to go all the way around\nright one at a time i'll teach you how\nto do this\nand then once you hit the guru bead you\nactually don't cross it\nwhat you do is then you start going you\nflip the m the mata around and you go\nback the other way\nokay so\nyou can absolutely chant soham\num i'm not going to chant it for\nweird reasons but you can chant it\nbut what i would recommend is that you\ntry to hear it\nokay so as you as you sit up straight\nyou know you've got your\nyour uh mara and then\nbreathe in and out\nthank you\nokay can you hear it\ncan you hear the soul and the hum\nyeah it's very low\nso you can increase the sound you can\nincrease the speed\nof your inhalation and your exhalation\nto increase the volume\noh of the of the oh okay\ni was saying like lowest and low in\npitch yes\nyeah it's gonna be yeah i think that\nmakes sense\nit i never thought about pitch but i\nthink that'll make sense\num so\nyeah so i'd say i'd say you know change\nyour sun gulp\nand and alhambra masmi is like\nyeah i don't think i don't think it's\nwhere you are that too\nis like aham brahmasmi means i am the\nuniverse\nand i think you're some people\nneed to be more connected to the outside\nworld\nlike um but i don't think that's your\nproblem\nactually i think your problem is that\nlike your way to\nyour your sense of self is like\ncaught up in the outside world\nright like you need to be less connected\nnot\nmore now i'm not saying you shouldn't\nyou know i don't think by all means\ncontinue to study and stuff but like all\nthis stuff about the meritocracy and\nwhat you have to be in what the world\nwants you to be like you need to pull\naway from all that\nokay okay so quick reminder of java\npractice so let's practice together for\nabout 60 seconds okay\num yep and or we'll practice for like\nlet's say like two minutes\nokay so and your back is straight how's\nyour\ndo you do yoga and stuff or no yep i do\nit in the morning before i do my\nmeditation\nokay good all right so sit up straight\nand begin\nme\nyes\ngo ahead and come on back when you're\nready\nokay yeah i mean i i didn't manage to\nlike restart it\nlike i was i was hungry yeah yeah you\ndon't have to go fast\ngod i'm so grateful i'm just so grateful\nto have this opportunity and like just\nlike\nit's just surreal that i'm meeting
