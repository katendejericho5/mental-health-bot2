    "transcript": "so lost and weird okay so hi i'm new\nhere i love dr k\nvideos on youtube it's something that\nhas been helping me a lot i'm 23\nand i have a feeling of emptiness inside\nand a strong need for human warmth\nalmost like a child i think that that's\ncreepy but it's how i feel\ni have a hard time socializing i hate\nthe sense that i have to put a mask on\ni feel like i'm being false and isolated\nfrom everybody\nit's like we all individually live in\nour our own small islands and we are\nalone forever trapped inside it's weird\ni want to be more confident and care\nless about what other\npeople think and be myself but i don't\nknow how\ni just feel alone\nokay this is a really great um\npost because i think it there's a really\ntricky\nproblem about that we run into when we\nlike\nlack confidence and have trouble making\nconnections with people so let's just\nthink\nthrough how this works okay so\nthis is like the problem with the\nchicken and the egg because\nwhen you don't so let's say like on the\ninside i'm not confident in myself\nso what happens is i put a mask on and\nthen i go\nand like relate to other people with the\nmask and then the problem that arises is\nbecause\nthe people are relating to the mask\ni don't necessarily become more\nconfident in myself\nright like what happens is i become\nconfident\nin the people's reaction to the mask so\nas a person\nwhat i think so for example i'm all oak\nand then like let's just call the mask\ndr k\nand so what i start to think is oh\npeople like dr k but what does that do\nto my confidence\nit actually doesn't increase it at all\nin fact it can make me even more\ninsecure\nbecause what people are responding\npositively to is dr k\nand is not alok and so the more that\nthis happens the more we get stuck\nso now i know that people like dr k\nand i think that they may not like me\nbecause they clearly like dr k what if i\nshow them the rest of me\nlike there's no way that showing them\nthe ugly bits on the inside of my psyche\nis gonna get them to like me more than\nwhat they like dr k\nas right and so then i get stuck because\nlike what happens is like\npeople start to love dr k more and the\nmore that they love dr k the harder it\nis to be all look\nbecause then it's like oh my god like i\ni can be this and then people will like\nme if i continue to like\nbe dr k and so what happens is we get\naddicted to wearing the mask\nbecause we think other people are\naddicted to the mask\nand that they won't like us on the\ninside and then we get really really\nstuck because we know how to put on the\nmask we know how to get good reactions\nfrom people\nbut we get more and more stuck and we\nbecome more and more insecure\nand then we wind up feeling empty on the\ninside we long for human connection\nbut we don't want to risk it right it's\nan al\nall an issue of risk because if i take\noff the mask what are people going to\nsee\nhow are they going to react what if i\nand it hurts\nit's fear there's like fear right what\nif they don't like me on the inside\nand it's tricky because the very\nadaptation that we use which is the mask\nwhich is to like you know make make it\neasy for us to interact with other\npeople\nbecomes our curse so our solution\nis the problem the fact that i put on a\nmask that i don't behave authentically\nwith people\nbecause there's so much ugliness on the\ninside because i'm so insecure\nactually reinforces that insecurity and\nthat insecurity will never get fixed\nso that it's challenging so what what\nthis person should do and what all\nall of you should do if you've gotten\naddicted to wearing a mask\nand if other people know just the mask\nis you've got to show them\nwhat else is there and that's really\nreally dangerous because then they could\nreject you\nrejecting the mask is oddly enough like\nkind of okay because it's not really who\nyou are\nright it's just a mask so it requires a\nlot of courage\nand it's tricky because like how are you\ngonna know\nhow are you gonna form that connection\nwith someone they can't form the\nconnection with a mask\nyou have to take the mask off but then\nyou have to be vulnerable and if you're\nvulnerable then they can hurt you\nand this is where the insecurity the\nlack of confidence comes in so it's\nreally really tricky\nbut you got to take the mask off right\nand you can do it in small steps i'm not\nsaying like\nyou know bear your soul to everyone\ni'm just saying like do it in little\nsteps you can say like\nhey you know if someone asks you how are\nyou doing\nyou can try i know it sounds crazy you\ncan try saying\nnot great and then they'll be like\nyou know so you what you're doing is\nyou're like it's it's a game of like\nping pong or tennis\nwhere you're like hitting a ball across\nthe other side and you're gonna see what\nthey do with it\nsome of them are gonna peace out they're\ngonna drop the racket and walk away from\nthe court right which is totally fine\nand then that hurts a little bit\nbut some of them will hit it back oh\nwhat's not what's\nwhat's not right in your life what's\nwhat's going wrong what's going wrong\nand then you can choose to share a\nlittle bit you can say oh i had a\nterrible game of valorant\nwhere i was gonna win but then we ended\nup feeding\nand then there was just one dude left on\nthe enemy team and he wiped us all\nokay you could say that or you could say\ni feel kind of like i feel kind of\nlonely\nlike i feel alone and then\nyou hit that across you know that's a\nthat's like a fastball like you're like\nand then you'll see what they do with it\nright\nand so this is where you know part of\nthe reason that like we have this\ncoaching program is because we got to\nteach people how to be vulnerable\nwe want to create a space where you can\nstart to swim in those waters\nand like learn to express vulnerability\nand then sure they're your coach so\nthey're supposed to accept you\nwhich they're actually not trained to do\nwe train our coaches to be authentic\nnot polite and not nice it's actually\nsomething that we try to get out of them\nlike because i think like authentic\nresponses are important\nright so like if if you screw up or you\nsay something\nbad your coach isn't gonna like forgive\nyou for it they'll like hold you\naccountable\nand they'll tell you how they feel\nlistening to it but they're gonna be\nthere\nthey're gonna be there anyway they'll\nshare their reaction they'll be like\nokay this is how i feel about what you\njust said\nwhat are we gonna do about that and so\nthe tricky thing here is that the more\nyou wear a mask\nthe more it keeps you from connecting to\npeople and then taking the mask off\ninvolves opening yourself up being\nvulnerable\nand then you can get hurt but ultimately\nthat's what you have to do\nand so if we go back to what this person\nis saying\nright i have a hard time socializing i\nhate the sense that i have to put a mask\non\nand i feel like i'm being false and\nisolated from everyone exactly\nlike we're all individually live in our\nown islands and we're\nalone forever trapped inside so build a\nbridge\nto someone else's island and this is\nwhere like you can also if you guys are\nconcerned about how do i build a bridge\ni don't want to be vulnerable\nyou pay attention to other people\nbecause other people will be hitting\nthings across your court\nwhen someone says you know how are you\ndoing today if they don't say fantastic\nthey say things are going okay\nthen you say oh so it sounds like some\nstuff is going well and some stuff isn't\ndo you want to talk about either one and\nthen they say yeah like so\non the upside i got a promotion on the\ndownside i just got dumped\nand then that's where you can say like\noh yeah i've been dumped before too in\nfact\ni got dumped two years ago and i still\nhaven't gotten over it\nyou know and like then you guys are like\nhitting the ball back and forth\nyou're sharing a little bit there\nsharing a little bit\nand then hopefully you start to feel\nmore connected with people and as you\nfeel more connected with people like you\ncan't develop that confidence unless\nyou test their reaction to what's on the\ninside\nand we see this a lot too sometimes with\nlike provocative stuff\nright sometimes people will be\nprovocative and they'll be like oh\nyou know like if someone's provocative\nthey're like yeah no one likes me and\nthey'll say that out loud\nthey're like provoking you to engage\nwith them in some way\nso it's tricky tricky\nright so so like type 2b says i've never\nbeen in a relationship to get dumped\nso you toss that out there\nand that's where we say like yeah man or\nwoman\nlike what's that like\nand so other people are saying like you\nsee what's happening so i want you guys\nto pay attention to chat because it's\nhappening here\nso i've never been in a relationship and\nthen someone else is saying i'm so fat\nand and like other people are like\nopening up a little bit see like if you\nguys are reading chat\nthis is where like people are making you\nknow people are like putting themselves\nout there\nright so you can add someone else in the\nchat so\nsomeone else is like i'm the opposite of\nfat so\nnow this is now we're talking about fat\ngang\ni'm ugly i'm this i'm that so now this\nis where we\nas a community we come together and i'm\ngonna ask you guys the question\nwhat's it like to have a body that\nyou're unhappy with\nright so like what's sad about it\nwhat's not great about it\nso one person says it's very restrictive\nwhat's restrictive about having a body\nthat you're unhappy with\nwhat's anxiety inducing about it\ni can't feel free what keeps you from\nfeeling free\nwhat does your body restrict you from\ndoing\nthanks for the host by the way tell do\nyou get treated differently it feels\nharder to be accepted\nso now we get somewhere there's social\nlimitations\nright who is putting those limitations\non you when you say it feels harder to\nbe accepted\nis that a feeling or a truth\npeople judge you for it right how do you\nget judged what's it like to be judged\nall right so so this is hard right so\nthis is where now people are saying like\nit's mostly myself i don't feel\ncomfortable around others but let's be\nhonest\nthey judge you too right so if you're\nwhen i was thinking about like\nbeing restricted like summer is coming\nup some people may go to the beach and\nyou may not feel comfortable going to\nthe beach because you have to wear less\nclothing and like you may feel judged\nlike it certainly sounds restrictive\nme judging you judging me\nright and this is tough and so then like\nwhat are we going to do with that\nabout that as a group right so this is a\nproblem that a lot of people\nlike have right one person is even\nsaying i occasionally have suicidal\nideation\nright i can get that like feeling so\nashamed in yourself that like you don't\neven want this body anymore like screw\nthis body like\nthe body is screwing you it's not\nletting you live your life\nso you're gonna be like screw it i can\nunderstand that\nand now what's happening so i know it\nsounds weird but like you're talking to\nsomeone on the internet\nbut like hopefully if you pay attention\nto yourself\nmaybe you feel a little bit less alone\neven with no like direct interaction\nwith another human being right so we\nhave this weird\ndr k interacting with twitch chat\nand so it's kind of like but like this\nis good because\nyou guys have taken a very safe step\nforward and being vulnerable\nwhich is like being vulnerable to people\nin twitch chat\nand like they can't see you they can't\njudge you but you can hear them and like\nwe all share an experience\nthat's what we're about and so this is\nwhere like\nthis is why we kind of have our group\ncoaching model because there's always\nthis problem\nif you work with a therapist or a coach\nwhich is that like your therapist is\npaid to accept you they're paid to do it\nright so if you like go to a therapist\nand you say like oh i'm a disgusting\nyou know i'm like my body is hideous the\ntherapist is like hey no it's not\nyou're beautiful on the inside i think\nyou're a wonderful person\nand then there's some part of you that's\nlike\nwell you're paid to say that\nand so this is what i really like i\nthink the most important thing about\ngroup coaching is like\nit's not about us right it's like about\nyou guys\nwinning your each other's respect\nbecause sure your coach is paid to like\nyou\ni mean that's not actually what they're\npaid for but that's how it feels\nright that's how it feels and so\nwhen you guys share this stuff with each\nother like this is what the connection\nfor the community is about\nthis is what like this is why this\nperson posts on reddit\nand let's just go and take a look at\nthis real quick\nright what are people saying in the\ncomments\nso like even this is enough\nlike i can relate don't have answers for\nyou but you aren't alone at being alone\nlike that\nright and then like thank you\nand then this person's like did i write\nthis i was thinking basically the exact\nsame thought\nespecially about the island thing\nperception is reality and therefore we\nall live in our own world\nalone i personally think i think it\ncomes from\nan intrinsic lack of self-worth great so\nsomeone's been doing some\nself-reflection\nif i don't have the worth i have to be\nsomeone else to be valued by others\nso i never show my true self so this\nperson's been perfect\nbasically exactly what i said and so we\ncould both be wrong but at least we'll\nbe wrong together\nand if i never show my true self then\nnone of the connections i've ever made\nare real ironically reading this\nfeels makes me feel less alone\ni hope we figure this out this is like\nthis is basically what we this is group\ncoaching happening on reddit\nright and then like this person's great\ntoo why do you have to put a mask on\nand so this is what the aoe healing is\nabout like we\nso the problem is that you know\nhere's the problem is that we all feel\nlike islands but we're all one connected\nlandmass we're like a continent it's\nlike pangaea up in here\nand then like everyone's like oh i'm on\nmy own island\nand why are you on your own island\nbecause everyone's wearing a damn mask\nand no one talks about like what they're\nfeeling\nso when one person goes out there and is\nlike oh\ni feel alone and i feel like i'm on an\nisland and they're all like hey we're\nall on islands too no you guys are on\nthe same loneliness island\nit turns out that it's actually pangaea\nand how did this interaction happen\nit's because one person went out there\nso i i do uh i'm trying to think about\nthis but\ni was hold on let me just think about\nlet me think about privacy concerns for\na second so so\ni i work with some people and we like\ncame up with this analogy right so some\nof these people are gamers\nand i don't know if you guys are\nfamiliar with like the idea\nof like in in mobas you know how you\nhave like tier one towers tier two\ntowers tier three towers\ntier four towers and like the the base\nor fountain or whatever\nand so like the right thing to do is\nwhen someone dives the fountain like\nwhat do you do\nlike you dive with them so in a group\nsetting when someone expresses\nvulnerability they're out there they're\ntaking that like\nthey've dove way deep into enemy lines\nand there's like no support\nand they're wiping and so what do you do\nyou charge\nright in there out with them and sure\nlike you throw the game\nif you're playing a moba but like when\nit comes to connecting with other human\nbeings like that's what you've got to do\nyou\nfeed together exactly if we're gonna\nthrow the game we're gonna like fountain\ndive together\ndon't alt f4 and report them that's the\nproblem is like that's what we normally\ndo that's what we expect to do\nbut you've got to dive with them when\nyour teammates are diving like you dive\nwith them\nhave you guys i don't know if you guys\nhave seen og fountain dive people in pro\ngames\nbut like that doesn't work if only one\nof them is fountain diving like the\nreason that it works is because\nthey all found dive together and then\nyou crush the enemy spirit\nand that's what we're gonna have to do\nwhen one person is vulnerable you have\nto\nyou know you gotta meet him meet him\nmeet him there don't let him do it alone\nyou"
