    "transcript": "and just a reminder that uh dr k's\nguides to mental health are going to be\ndropping probably in august\nso it's a chance for people to get a\nmore kind of personalized experience\non a mental health journey the way that\nit's kind of organized is sort of like\nwhat\ni think about what i do with actual\nclients and what i do with clients is\nnot like you know one size fits all\nsolution it's sort of like a branching\nlogic\nand so the goal of the guides is to\nactually like kind of walk that\nbranching journey that you sort of pick\nat each of the branch points like what\nyou want to do\nobviously you can do it all but it\nreally sort of is designed to be like\nsimilar to what happens in my head\nwhen i'm sitting down with a person it's\ngoing to hopefully be ready in august\npre-orders are available now\nokay so today we are going to talk\na little bit about um why men struggle\nin relationships\nand this is a really important topic\nbecause i think that a lot of times\num we're conditioned in a particular way\nwe're raised in a particular way and it\ntends to create problems in our\nrelationship\nso this lecture is really geared at\npeople who sort of like fit the\nfollowing kind of like criteria\nokay so if you if you feel like the\nstuff that i'm about to say applies to\nyou hopefully this will be helpful\nso the first thing is that you're\nconfused by inner turmoil like when\nyou're in a relationship sometimes you\nfeel angry\nsometimes you feel frustrated and upset\nbut you also feel really stupid for\nfeeling that way\nsecond reason to you know that this may\napply to you\nis that you feel like sometimes other\npeople do a bad job in a relationship\nbut you have a lot of trouble\narticulating what they're doing wrong\nthird reason um that this may be\nrelevant to you is that\nyou're someone who kind of feels cold or\nnumb in relationship kind of like a\nrobot\nlike some parts of you want to connect\nwith people more authentically\nbut you keep them at arm's length you\nyou tend to become\nreally uncomfortable when people get too\nclose but you also don't want them to\nleave\nso it's sort of like you get stuck in\nthis kind of like limbo zone where you\nwant to be closer to people\nbut you\nand and just be done with it all and so\nthis is something that i've seen more\ncommonly in men it can certainly happen\nin women as well um but we're going to\ntalk a little bit more\nspecifically about men because some of\nthe things that i think\nsome of the way that we're conditioned\nand raised as men\ntends us it makes us more vulnerable to\nsome of these states\nnow the next thing to kind of think\nabout is that it you you all could be\ndating someone who's like this\nso if you're in a relationship with\nsomeone\nhere are some of the signs that it looks\nlike from a partner's perspective\nthe first and foremost is mixed signals\nokay\nthis is where like someone will say to\nyou like your partner will say to you\ni'm fine nothing is wrong when like\nclearly something is wrong\nsometimes your partner will get moody\nwithout a clear explanation and when you\nask them like\nwhat's wrong there aren't they either\ndon't tell you or they're not even\nable to tell you like you're clear it's\nclear that they're upset about something\nbut when you're like what's wrong\nthey're like nothing\nnothing nothing's wrong nothing's wrong\nand\nin in good cases you know usually we see\nthis pattern where like people will be\nmoody for like\na week and they'll kind of like\nnaturally come out of it and they'll be\nback to their\ntheir normal selves in more severe\nor kind of like negative situations what\nactually happens is that people will\nlike\nhold on to and harbor resentment that\nmoodiness sort of lingers in a\nrelationship and cert can really start\nto create toxicity\nsometimes partners can get very confused\nwhen like\num you know you your partner gets mad at\nyou for seemingly like benign or trivial\nthings\nand the last thing is once again that\npeople will your partner kind of keeps\nyou at arm's length\nso like they're kind of sending you\nmixed signals that they want to be\ncloser maybe they want to be more\nintimate\nwant to be more authentic want to be\nconnected but anytime you try to get\nclose to them or you start to get close\nto them\nthey push you away so this is kind of\nlike\nyou know it's been my observation that\nmen sometimes struggle in relationships\ndue to these things\nand so what we're gonna try to do this\ncan actually it can certainly happen to\nwomen as well\num or you know non-binary people\nbut at the end of the day i see the\npattern more commonly in men\nand so what we're going to do is try to\nexplain to all you know why does this\nhappen why are we socialized this way\nwhat is sort of going on psychologically\nand scientifically like\nin our minds in our development that\nleads us to this way and then we're\ngoing to end up with sort of practical\ntips\nas to what to do about it going forward\nso it turns out that a lot of this stuff\nhas\nhas to do with something that called\nattachment theory okay\nso what we're going to do is explain a\nlittle bit about attachment theory\nthis starts off with discussing\nsomething called the strange situation\nthere was a great um psychoanalyst named\njohn bowelby who i think back in the 70s\ndesigned a really interesting experiment\ncalled the strange situation\nso in the the strange situation which\nyou've got is a mother\nusually in a kid and they're in a room\nand then what happens is mom leaves the\nroom and then a stranger\nenters the room okay so stranger comes\nin and mom leaves so now the kid is\nsuddenly like\nalone with a stranger and then what\nhappens a little while later is\nmom usually comes back into the room and\nis is kind of back\nand so what bowelbee kind of noticed is\nthat um\nthere are actually like a lot of\ndifferent ways that the child actually\nresponds to this situation\nand so over time there were other\nresearchers who kind of contributed to\nthis work\nwork and eventually they sort of came up\nwith\nfour kinds of what we call attachment\nso the first kind of attachment is\nsomething called secure attachment\nso what happens in this case is the\nparent leaves the room an\ninsecure in secure attachment\nthe child may start to cry when the\nstranger enters so they'll cry\nbut when mom comes back they are easily\ncomforted\nso they like calm down real quick like\nif mom is around\num i'm totally fine like it's not a big\ndeal\nthey also notice that there was a second\nset of kids who\nwhen mom leaves they also start to cry\nbut when mom comes back they seem to be\nlike really really like\ntorn so they start to get like kind of\nclingy\nbut then also like are sort of like not\nquite as clingy\nas another set of kids they tend to\nlike get a little bit frustrated get a\nlittle bit angry\num tend to be like kind of like confused\nlike they they want to go to mom for\naffection\nbut they sort of like feel torn and they\nseem kind of like\nstuck they kind of start to send mixed\nsignals\nokay and then the third type is the\nanxious avoidant attachment\nand in these kids it's really\ninteresting so like when they when mom\nleaves they start to become\nanxious they start they may start to cry\nbut when mom comes back they\nactually like don't go to mom for\ncomfort and instead what they do is they\nthey sort of like become kind of like\nindependent\num and they'll sort of like they won't\ngo to mom for comfort even though\nthey're kind of upset and they'll sort\nof like remain independent\nthey'll move somewhat close to mom so\nthey'll like move like a little bit\ncloser\nbut they won't actually go to mom for\nlike comfort or security\nand then the last category of people so\nlike they sort of remain\nindependent and the last category of\npeople are have insecure attachment\nwhich is they freak out when mom leaves\nthe room\nand even when when mom returns they're\ninconsolable so they'll start to cry\nwhen mom leaves\nand even when mom comes back like\nthey'll still continue crying\nand what we're going to focus on is\nactually these two okay so this is like\nwhat we're going to talk about today\nso the anxious ambivalent attachment\nstyle and the anxious avoidant\nattachment style\nand essentially what balby discovered is\nthat these\nkinds of responses actually have a lot\nto do with the way that we're raised or\nthat was his theory anyway\nand he sort of realized that when\ncaregivers give us\ninconsistent responses to\nour need for affection we end up as\nanxious ambivalent\nso what that sort of means is if i like\nhurt my leg and\nand i get a boo-boo and i go to mom how\ndoes mom respond to me so\nfor the people with secure attachment\nevery time i get hurt mom is there and\nis\nis comforting for insecure attachment um\nit can be it gets a little bit\ncomplicated but generally saying\nspeaking we can say that mom is not very\ncomforting her parents aren't very\ncomforting\nfor the anxious ambivalent attachment\nstyle what we see is\ninconsistent caregiving this is going to\nbe somewhat true of avoidant as well\num but sometimes like so sometimes mom\nis like really care\nlike is really warm and loving and other\ntimes like mom is like\nnot warm and loving and so what that\nwhat that does is tends to confuse us\nand so we never know like this child the\nanxious ambivalent child\nnever knows like what to expect\nand so what that means is that there's a\npart of them that's like okay let me go\nand like get comfort from mom\nbut then there's also part of them\nthat's like well sometimes when i get\ncomfort from mom\nlike mom sort of gets like you know\ndoesn't give me what i need\nand so what that sort of results in is\nkind of this like clinical presentation\nof mixed signals so like this is what\nthis kind of looks like so it's really\ncharacterized by mixed signals\nokay and what we mean by mixed signals\nis like these can be internal or\nexternal so in the relationship you can\nsend signals to someone that you know\nyou're upset\nbut at the same time like if they ask\nyou are you upset\nyou're gonna say no so are you upset and\nthen you\nsay no but you mean yes so that's one\nkey characteristic of the anxious\nambivalent attachment style\nthe other thing is that this mixed\nsignal doesn't have to be external it\ncan also be internal\nso these people have inner turmoil so\nthey feel a lot of like\ninternal conflict feeling frustrated\nangry\nupset and then they also feel like very\nstupid for feeling that way\nso they're like kind of confused\ninternally they're like i don't\nunderstand\nwhy i'm so upset or angry like i don't\nreally know what's wrong\nand sometimes what happens is that these\npeople actually like\nthey have they have a lot of difficulty\nin relationships\nbecause there are things that will set\nthem off so they get\nticked off but they're not really able\nto articulate\nwhat it is that's wrong right so this\nkind of goes back to the mixed signals\nbecause\nlike are you upset like clearly i'm\nupset\nbut i'm not able to articulate like\nwhat's wrong\nand the reason for that actually has to\ndo with the the roots of how like\nthese anxious these attachment styles\ndevelop which is emotional mirroring\nso what happens when we're young is that\nwe don't really understand\nwhat we feel emotionally and so the way\nthat we discover\nand start to learn our internal\nemotional state\nis through the mirroring of the adults\naround us so this is best exemplified by\nthis example of like\nyou know when there's a kid that's\nrunning around like a toddler and they\ntrip and fall\nand then like there's a brief moment\nwhere the toddler will look around at\nthe adults in the room\nif the adults in the room freak out and\nexpress to the child oh my god are you\nokay then the toddler will start crying\nbut if all of the adults start laughing\nthe toddler will be like\ni'm not hurt at all so it's kind of like\nreally fascinating because\nearly on like you can think about you\nknow if i'm a one-year-old like how do i\nknow\nwhat i'm feeling the way that i know\nwhat i'm feeling\nis through the emotional expressions of\npeople around me\nso like when i'm a child and i get a\nboo-boo\nand i go to mom and mom is like oh you\npoor baby let me\nlike help you let me make it feel better\nso i'm feeling hurt mom expresses\nconcern and the world makes sense\nso things get really confusing when that\nthat emotional mirroring is inconsistent\nso when i'm hurt and mom tells me to\nlike\nshut the hell up and sit down then it's\nlike i'm like wait what how does this\nwork when i feel this way\nand mom tells me to shut the hell up did\ni do something wrong\nand then at other times when mom's in a\ngood mood and i hurt myself and i go to\nmom and\nshe's like oh you poor thing and so it's\nlike really confusing like what do i\nfeel\nis the feeling that i have good or is\nthe feeling that i have bad like what is\nthis emotion\nand so children are actually like\nthey're not they don't know what their\ninternal feeling is\nthis is further reinforced by especially\nthis is thankfully changing now but like\nyou know by the conditioning that we\ntend to do towards\nboys versus girls right so this is like\nstarting to even out but if you go to\nmost parts of the world it really isn't\nwhere you know boys are told to like not\nexpress emotion\nessentially right we won't say that\nexplicitly we won't even say\ndon't express emotion because we don't\neven have that degree of eq what we'll\nsay is like man up or stop crying or\nboys don't cry or you need to do this or\nyou need to man up or like whatever\nright if you're hanging out at school\nand you start crying like\nwhat are the other kids going to do to\nyou like the kids are going to make fun\nof you\nright and like even teachers will\nsometimes like\ntreat you poorly you know parents\nsiblings things like that like we're not\ntaught to express emotion\nand so the interesting thing is as we\nare taught to not express emotion\nour ability to learn what our emotional\nstate is\ngets handicapped right because remember\nthe way that we learn what our internal\nemotional state is\nis through the emotional mirroring of\nother people so when i stop\ncommunicating with people about what my\nemotional state is like even if i don't\nknow what it is\nif i stop talking about it and i just\nkind of manage it on my own\nwhat i'm essentially relying on is like\nparts of my brain to like\nacclimatize and just turn off so i don't\nactually learn anything\nso there's there's interesting research\nthat shows that you know if you get\nangry you're not going to stay angry for\n10 years\nthere's our our brain has a natural\nhomeostatic mechanism which sort of\nexplains the weak of moodiness\nright so you feel really moody you feel\nupset by something you're not quite sure\nwhat you're upset by\nyou feel kind of angry you feel kind of\nconfused and this is all because you\nwere never\ntaught like how to understand what you\nfeel\nbecause people tend to be socialized or\nconditioned\nto not express their feelings and like\nnot communicate with other people\nthis gets further compounded by the fact\nthat like if you think about you know\ndads\nlike your dad let's say you're 20 years\nold now and your dad became a dad in\n2001 and so then like you think about\nyour dad's upbringing right so like your\nyour dad may have been born like in 1970\nand so what was his emotional\nunderstanding and\nhow does he pass on that emotional\nunderstanding on to you right because\nlike\nhow is your dad going to teach you if he\nnever learned like how to be in touch\nwith his emotions\nso we see like definitely a conditioning\neffect a socializing effect\nthat leads to ignorance of your internal\nemotional state\nprobably through a lack of mirroring as\nwell as like social conditioning\nthat leads us to be confused about what\nour internal emotional state is\nand so we wind up with this anxious\nambivalent attachment style which is one\nof the two things that we're going to\ncover which is sort of like all about\nturmoil confusion ambivalence\nand like mixed signals and this can\nmake relationships really really\ndifficult because like\nthere can be something that upsets you\nbut then you can't articulate to the\nperson like\nwhat they did wrong and the reason that\nyou can't articulate\nmay be because of some amount of\nemotional vulnerability\nsome amount of self-judgment so this is\nreally common where people like they\nfeel\nstupid telling this person yeah like\nyou you know did this like you didn't\ncall me like\non thursday and like that really hurt my\nfeelings like we're just not taught how\nto say things like that\nbecause what we're actually taught like\nyou have this voice in your head\nthat's like you shouldn't feel that way\nlike what what difference does it make\nlike\nyou should be able to handle it if your\ngirlfriend doesn't call you on a\nthursday like even if it's kind of an\nimportant day to you like\nyou should grow the [ __ ] up man like\ncome on right\nso like that's that anxious ambivalent\nattachment style kind of like\ncoming through right and so as that kind\nof\nshame and as that self-judgment arises\nit makes it difficult for you to\ncommunicate\nand then causes problems in the\nrelationship because then your\ngirlfriend is kind of like i don't know\nwhat i did wrong did i do something\nwrong you're like no\nno i'm fine i'm fine and then you just\nkind of like\nwait a week and then you start to feel a\nlittle bit better and then you kind of\nforget about it so a couple of other\ninteresting things\num so people with an anxious ambivalent\nattachment style\nalso have a couple of interesting\nbehavioral correlations we're not going\nto go too much into that\nbut it's really interesting because\nthese people have low self-esteem which\nsort of makes sense\nthey also have a low amount of intrinsic\nmotivation which is really fascinating\nso for a lot of people who feel like oh\ni'm lazy i'm undisciplined\nthey're actually studies that show that\nlow intrinsic motivation\nis associated with a particular kind of\nattachment style\nand sometimes you all may understand\nthis because like you know they're the\npeople who are just like good at life\nthat are not like\nus like they're emotionally in touch\nwith themselves they're like confident\nthey're brave\nand they go out and they work hard and\nthey do their resume on time and they\nstudy for their tests\nand they apply like for things at the\nright time like\nyou know there are those people and we\nget so confused because like why do\nthese people\nhave what seems like everything and we\nhave nothing\nand it turns out that they're actually\nlike correlations right like so there\nare correlations between\nsecure attachment confidence and\nintrinsic motivation and if you're one\nof those people fantastic\nso i used to be an anxious ambivalent\nkind of person\nor even anxious avoidance which we'll\nget to and now i think i've got pretty\nsecure attachment\nall right so anxious ambivalent\nattachment\nis what we call a resistant attachment\nso what this means\nis that it it's a it's an attachment\nthat's characterized by feelings of both\nanger and helplessness when the\ncaregiver returns the child is\nambivalent\nthey seek contact but also rebuff it\nit's kind of like this conditional\nstrategy to preemptively take control\nof the interaction so what this sort of\nmeans is that i'm going to keep you at\narm's length so that you\ncan't hurt me by leaving again but i\nalso want you to be close to me\ni don't really like this situation but\nit's the best thing that i can do to\nprotect myself\nlike it's kind of you're stuck between\nwanting more in a relationship\nand also not wanting to be hurt again\nokay\nso what this sort of means is like this\nis what the mixed signals are because\nthere's a part of you that's like\nif i put myself out there and i let this\nperson connect to me which is really\nwhat i want\nwhat that means is that they could leave\nthe room again\nand then i'm gonna be left like all on\nmy own\nand so like you know it it really is\nsort of like this protective mechanism\nthat we sort of engage in\nwhere there's a part of us that wants to\nreach out and connect and there's a part\nof us that's like don't do that because\nthey're just going to hurt you again\nand and so what this means is when when\npeople sort of kind of going back to the\nmotivation thing what this kind of what\nthis ambivalence means so ambivalence\nmeans being like\nyou know uh 50 yes and 50\nno being on the fence is this is what\nsort of leads to this like intrinsic\nlack of motivation because what happens\nis\nthese people are always on the fence\nright there's a part of you that's\nsaying like i want to apply for this job\nand there's a part of you that's saying\nbut if you apply for the job you could\nget rejected and that's going to hurt\nso this is sort of what the the anxious\nambivalent attachment style looks\nlooks like which is a resistant\nattachment like i\nam attached but i'm like not thrilled\nabout it so that's the anxious\nambivalent attachment\nnow what we're gonna talk about is the\nanxious avoidant attachment so the\nanxious avoidant attachment\nis gonna be like present like this okay\nso it's gonna be like\nthe emotional robot is what i call it so\nyou guys may know\nyou know you may feel this way or you\nmay be like this or you may know someone\nlike that\nso it was people who are like numb and\ncold\nso like they're all so fiercely\nindependent and so we'll go more into\nthis\nbut like this is people who have like\nsort of a safe zone\nyou kind of have this place where you\nlike to hang out\nand that place is like not too close but\nalso not too far\nright you're not like anti-social and\ndon't form relationships at all\nwhat it is is like you want to be in\nthis really safe zone where like you can\nremain independent you don't have to\nrely on anyone\nwhere like you don't have to feel\nemotionally hurt and you don't have to\nfeel\nconnected from a partner perspective\nthese people so from the partner\nperspective\nthese your partner keeps you at arm's\nlength\nthey don't want you to come close but\nthey don't want you to get too far\nso we're gonna like we're gonna stay in\nthe safe zone\nand the problem with this is that these\npeople even though they feel\nnumb and cold and they they kind of feel\nlike they're emotional robots\nthe safe zone is very unsatisfying so\nit's safe\nbut it's like not a fun place to be so\nsometimes people who have anxious\navoidant\nattachment styles like they want more\nlike they recognize that they shouldn't\nbe this way they recognize that they're\nmissing something\nimportant in the relationship they just\ndon't know what to do about it\nso going back remember this is the the\nsituation where\num you know the parent comes back and\nthe kid is like\nnot really too messed up about it they\nkind of remain\nunruffled so i think the best way to\nkind of categorize this\nis using the word unruffled so they're\ncalm in the face of separation\nand at the same time they actually like\nuh even though they they appear calm\nthis is actually\nuh a mask for their internal distress\nso these people may appear fiercely\nindependent but internally\nthey're like really really distressed\nabout it and this is what's really cool\nabout this\nis so you know when researchers they\nwere doing the study like with\ntwo-year-olds right so what researchers\nwere trying to figure out is okay it\nseems like the kid actually doesn't care\nwhether like mom is in the room\nor mom is not in the room and they were\ntheorizing like maybe this is a mask for\ndistress like we're gonna\npretend to be strong and we're gonna say\nlike even though they're internally like\nthey're really freaking out\non the outside they're like yeah it's no\nbig deal like i can handle this i'm cool\nlike it's a shell\nso what researchers did was measure the\nheart rates of the children\nwho appeared to be completely fine and\nwhat they\nactually found is that physiologically\nthese children are depressed\ni mean distressed okay so what happened\nis like they would measure the heart\nrates and what they'd find is that like\nthe kid is putting on this facade of\nbeing like totally fine and not needing\nconnection and being independent\nbut internally their heart is hammering\nright so they actually are\nphysiologically very very distressed\nand so the anxious avoidant attachment\nstyle is sort of like a protection\nagainst like the emotional hurt okay\nso um what this actually means is that\nthe the kids are not\nactually fine right they may appear to\nbe fine and even in the case of the\nanxious avoided\nattachment style you may feel cold and\nnumb but it's not\nactually healthy like you've learned how\nto adapt to the circumstance\nbut it's not actually good for you so\nthe anxious avoidant attachment style\nis caused by when a child communicates\ntheir emotional needs\nand they essentially get like no\nresponse\nso remember the ambivalent attachment\nstyle is an inconsistent response\nbut the avoidant attachment style\nhappens when you communicate your\nemotional needs\nand you get like essentially like a\nneutral response or no response\nthat's when you learn to become avoidant\nand also like fiercely independent\nright so what this what what researchers\nsort of discovered is that when\nthe parent's response to you is not\ninfluenced\nby you expressing your needs you put up\nthis emotional wall\nand you sort of like really rely on that\nindependence\nso when voicing your needs essentially\ndoes not get a good response so like a\nclassic\nexample of this is like being told the\nman up\nright this is like the most classical\nexample like i'm hurting i go to my dad\nand my dad is like\nwhy are you crying like men don't cry\nman up and so this is also caused by\nyour emotional needs being rebuffed and\nthis sort of creates like\na really problematic cycle and this is\nsomething that i see a lot\nwhich is that like as men become more\nunable to communicate their emotional\nneeds\ntheir subtle attempts at emotional\nconnection tend to\nbe perceived as rebuffed so remember if\ni'm like independent and i'm an\nisland and like i don't want to hurt\nmyself i don't want to risk being hurt\nand furthermore if i'm like kind of\nalexa thymic and i don't understand what\ni feel or why\ni'm even upset remember i'm emotionally\nnumb\nso if i'm emotionally numb and don't\nfeel a whole lot of stuff\nwhen i like communicate to people that i\nhave emotional needs\nlike i'm gonna be really bad at that\ncommunication right because i'm not\ngonna be able to say like\nhey this really hurt me and i was really\nlooking forward to spending this weekend\nwith you but\nyou went out with your friends and i\nfelt like emotionally neglected\nand unlovable you don't know how to say\nthat\nso instead what you do is like you just\nask your partner you're like hey do you\nwant to hang out\non sunday for brunch and they're like oh\ni was planning on doing this and you're\nlike okay cool\nand you don't tell them what it means to\nyou and then inside what you feel is\nlike that rejection\nright because you never signal to them\nand the more you get rejected the more\nindependent you become the more you like\nstay in that safe zone where you don't\nwant to like get too close but you also\nlike really like your partner right so\nyou don't want to like break up with\nthem\nand so you end up by withdrawing so\nthese infants withdraw from their\ncaregivers\nand and this is where things get really\nweird because actually what\nwe do is like we withdraw just enough\nbut we never leave entirely\nso we enter this like paradoxical like\nlimbo zone which is also like the safe\nzone\nwhere it's like i'm never going to get\nclose to you but i\ni want to be close to you so i'm never\ngoing to leave and so it creates this\nkind of really tricky situation where\nlike men have difficulty connecting\nwomen can do this too\nbut i think that men once again are more\nsocialized to this kind of behavior\nand so we kind of stay at the threshold\nof a close relationship\nand we're scared to move closer and\nwe're scared to move further away\nokay so that's the anxious avoidant\nattachment style\nfiercely independent i don't want to get\ntoo close i don't want to get too far\ni'm kind of safe over here but i'm also\nunsatisfied\ni have a lot of difficulty communicating\nmy emotional needs\nokay so now the question becomes okay\nlike what do we do it about this okay\nlike okay so like dr k this is fine this\nis who i am you've described me i'm\neither the\nanxious ambivalent or the anxious\navoidant person i'm a situ\ni definitely fall into the camp of being\nlike\nemotionally torn and having in inner\nturmoil or you're dating someone who's\nsending you mixed signals\nhey are you upset with me no i'm fine\ndid i do something wrong no\nit's fine i'm telling you it's fine\nright like that's one example or the the\navoidance like yeah like whatever man\nlike\nyou can do whatever you want to and then\nlike you're like\nwait are you upset no man i'm cool it's\nall good\nlike you do it's fine like really like\nand then sometimes what what\nyou can even see is like you know fear\nof becoming dependent\nwhere it's sort of like this is like\nwe're fear of commitment or like these\nother kind of\nyou know societal things that we say oh\nlike this dude is afraid of commitment\nit's not that he's afraid of commit i\nmean maybe that's a good way to put it\nactually but like\nthere's other stuff going on right it's\nnot like he doesn't he doesn't\njust dislike commitment for the sake of\ncommitment it's sort of that\nit's not that he's like afraid of\ncommitment in general it's that like he\ndoesn't know if he can trust you\nand this is where things get really\nconfusing because like he sends these\nlike\nminor minor signals to his partner that\nare sort of like hey can i trust you are\nyou like able to see what i'm feeling\nhere\nand then the partner is oblivious which\nis not really their fault because the\nsignals are very very tiny\nand then they get rebuffed and it sort\nof creates this this\nlike vicious cycle so we kind of end up\nwith this anxious ambivalent attachment\nstyle and anxious avoidance attachment\nstyle\nnow if we go back to the original\nresearch by bowelby what bowelbee kind\nof hypothesizes and what other people\nlater hypothesized is that all this\nstuff is formed in childhood\nso like if if we sort of look at the\npeople who are like intrinsically\nmotivated and securely attached\nthey lucked out because they had good\nparents and like i\ngot the short stick because my parents\nwere not emotionally available to me\nso it turns out that that's actually not\ntrue and now we're going to go to a\nreally interesting article from\ncurrent opinion in psychology so as\npeople have started to look at\nthe origin of attachment style and how\nattachment style\ndevelops there's a really important\nlesson to be learned here\nwhich is that foundations are not fake\nand what this means is that your\nattachment style for\nearly on is determined by socialization\nso what this means is this is the\nparental influence okay\nso like when i'm a one-year-old my\nattachment style is absolutely\ndetermined by my parents for the most\npart\nokay but the cool thing that researchers\nhave developed is that when you look at\nadults\nthe way that you are raised starts to\nmatter less and less and less\nand what matters is what they call\nselection effects\nso socialization is your environment and\nselection is your choices\nso people play an active role in\nselecting and shaping their\ninterpersonal environments\nwhich means that if you fall into one of\nthese categories\nyour parents may have gotten you off on\na particular trajectory\nbut it's ultimately the people that you\nchoose to hang out with\nwhich is going to determine whether your\nattachment style stays\ninsecure or becomes secure\nokay so this is your spawn point right\nlike this is my starting gear\nbut as it turns out the further i go\ninto the game just like video games\nthe further i go into the game i have\nmore of a choice about how i play\nright because when i spawn like this is\nmy starting equipment like it's the same\nlike i can't do anything about that\nbut every every level that i gain and\nevery time like i get a new shop i can\nstart to control\nyou know what my gear looks like how i\nspend my skill points etc\nso the cool thing so if you're worried\nabout this and you're asking me what do\ni do about it\nthere are a couple of really simple\nthings that we can do about it okay\nthe first is to understand that your\nfate is not set in stone\nand essentially the people that you hang\nout with\nwill determine how your attachment style\nevolves\nso this is where you have to be really\nreally careful so like\nare the people that you're hanging out\nwith able to emotionally\nlike help you out some can they be\nsupportive\ncan you turn to someone and say hey i'm\nfeeling kind of confused right now can\nyou help me figure out how i feel\nso we're going to give you actually some\nvery key dialogue okay\nso if you fall into these categories\nanxious ambivalent or anxious avoidant\nwhat i want you to do when you're\nfeeling a particular way and remember\nthese are the signs right so\nif you're anxious ambivalent you're\ngoing to feel angry\nfrustrated confused and you're going to\nfeel dumb\nright so like you're going to have those\nfeelings of anger and frustration\nyou're going to be kind of confused why\nyou feel that way and you're going to\njudge yourself for feeling that way\nthat's\nthat's the presentation so if you find\nyourself feeling that way\nwho is someone that you can communicate\nthat to and just communicate it to him\ndirectly like ideally a romantic partner\nso that's sort of the assumption we're\nhaving here\nand you go to your partner boyfriend\ngirlfriend whatever and you say\nhey i'm feeling and if they ask you are\nyou is something wrong\nyou can even say something like hey i\ncan't tell what's wrong but something\nfeels wrong\ni am upset but i don't understand why\ni'm upset\ni am upset and i feel stupid for being\nupset\nso you literally communicate with them\nto them what you're feeling\nnow what's why is this hard because when\nwe think about immune emotional\ncommunication\nwe think that we should have everything\nfigured out on the\ninside before we communicate with\nsomeone\nright because we think to ourselves that\nlike what the hell is someone gonna do\nwith that\nyeah i'm upset but i don't know why i'm\nupset\nlike how are they supposed to deal with\nthat so then we feel ashamed for even\ncommunicating something that's like half\nbaked\nlike how would they deal with that and i\nknow that that feels like very very like\nstupid to do but that's exactly what we\nneed to do\nbecause here's the cool thing right\nremember that attachment style has to do\nwith emotional mirroring\nso as you share a half-baked\ncommunication about your feelings\nthat gives your partner the opportunity\nto be like confused with you they don't\nhave to figure it all out\nbut then the two of y'all figure it out\ntogether\nand so then they may say something like\nokay i don't know what to do with that\nand then you're gonna say yeah i don't\nknow what to do with that and that makes\nme feel stupid\nand like this is like and then like you\nmay feel embarrassed for\nfor sort of saying that but it's really\namazing if you give your partner the\nopportunity to support you\nyou know and then like they may say like\nokay i don't know what to do but like if\nsomething occurs to you like please let\nme know and if you are the partner and\nsomeone shares something like that with\nyou\nyou can kind of be honest with them hey\ni want to help you but i don't know how\nto help you\nand you know i'm gonna try a couple\nthings or maybe you can make a\nsuggestion or like maybe we can work on\nthis together\nright you don't have to figure out the\nanswer because fixing your attachment\nstyle is not about\nfiguring out the answer it's about not\nfacing your problem alone\nit's about emotional mirroring not\nemotional correction\nit's just about the other person meeting\nyou where you're at\nokay so to recap the first thing that\nyou need to do\nis you know be a little bit careful with\nwho you hang out with\nand try to find people that you can\nshare a half-baked thought with\nabout your internal emotional state the\nsecond thing that you need to do so this\nis where\num if you look at research for people\nwho are securely attached versus people\nwho are not securely attached\nwhat you find is that securely attached\nindividuals\naccept their own emotional needs while\ninsecurely attached individuals\nespecially anxious avoidant folks do not\nso like people believe that they can't\nrely on other people's\nsupport which sort of makes sense may\nhave something to do with the historical\nway that they were raised\nbut the second thing that you need to do\nis acknowledge your own emotional needs\nright and that can be really confusing\nbecause you may not know exactly what\nthey are\nbut acknowledge whatever you can so you\ncan at least acknowledge that\ni'm feeling angry and i'm feeling\nfrustrated and i feel stupid for feeling\nthis way\nand if someone did do something that\nhurt your feelings\nyou have to be really careful because\nyou have an emotional need and what you\ndo\nis denigrate or devalue your emotional\nneed\nand in your mind you say it's stupid for\nme to feel upset about this\nand in doing so you're actually not\nacknowledging your emotional need\nso the second thing that you need to do\nis really be careful because\nif you're calling yourself stupid for a\nparticular having a particular emotional\nneed\nthat's what you need to like turn around\nright it's okay\nfor you to have emotional needs that\nother people don't understand\nnow this is also where like you don't\nhave to blame them for it right but like\nacknowledging your own emotional need\nis separate from someone else fulfilling\nor not fulfilling it\nso you can even go to them and you can\nsay hey like\ni know that your friends were visiting\nfrom college and i still really felt\nlike i wanted to see you last weekend\nand i do think objectively that like you\nshould spend time with them because\nobviously\nyou know they're only here once a year\nand like i get to see you every week\nso it makes sense to me to objectively\nfor you to see them\nand at the same time i still really like\nfelt\nlike i wanted to go to brunch with you\nand like i felt kind of\nemotionally rejected and i acknowledge\nthat that may not make a whole lot of\nsense\nbut it's honestly it's the need that i\nhad like i felt lonely that weekend\nlast weekend was like you know i felt\nlonely\nso you can kind of like acknowledge your\nemotional need\nand be you just have to acknowledge it\nyou actually don't have to fulfill it\nthey don't actually have to change their\nbehavior\nthe key thing is that securely attached\nindividuals except\ntheir emotional needs and so this is the\nreally tricky thing is that like a lot\nof people like how do i fix this\nand this is where people get really\nconfused because really fixing it does\nnot actually have to do with changing\nmuch on the outside\nthey don't have your partner doesn't\nactually have to change and this is\nwhat's so damn confusing for them is\nlike\nwhen you when they ask you like is\nsomething wrong and you say no and then\nthey're like i don't know what i need to\nchange\nno one needs to change anything in terms\nof behavior\nall that really needs to be changed is\nawareness acknowledgement of your\nemotional needs\nand then sharing those emotional needs\nfor emotional mirroring with other\npeople\nyour partner doesn't actually have to\nskip out on the weekend with like their\ncollege friends to go to brunch with you\nthat doesn't actually have to happen\nall that has to happen is you need to\nacknowledge that emotional need\nand like they need to hear you and sort\nof like mirror it back\nand they can say just like hey you know\ni understand that you feel lonely like\nthis is really important to me can i\nmake it up to you next weekend\nthat's all all that has to happen okay\nso just to summarize i think a lot of\nthe reason that men struggle\nin relationships has to do with the way\nthat we're socialized and conditioned\nand can be explained\nbest by something called attachment\ntheory\nwhat attachment theory kind of relies on\nis this idea that\nhow we relate to other people has to do\nwith the way that\nour emotional needs were mirrored or met\nby our parents early in life so for some\npeople our parents were really are not\nnecessarily parents but just key\nemotional figures\nso for some people our parents were very\nlike\num inconsistent with the way that they\nresponded to our emotional needs\nsometimes they were loving and sometimes\nthey were neglectful\nand that results in something called an\nanxious ambivalent attachment style\nwhich is really characterized by\nturmoil and mixed signals i feel angry i\nfeel frustrated i feel stupid\ni blame myself for feeling that way when\npeople ask me what's wrong i say\nnothing's wrong when really something is\nwrong\nso it's like filled with mixed signals\nand can make relationships really\ndifficult\nfor other people they were sort of their\nemotional needs were actually like\nnot really answered in any way or when i\nexpressed an emotional need\nwhat i was told is that like my\nemotional need is like not\nimportant it's not necessarily neglect\nor abuse which leads to a different kind\nof attachment style\nit's this the quintessential this is\nwhen like i go crying to my dad at the\nage of seven i say hey this person\nbullied me\nand my dad is like you need to man man\nthe f up and\nand you know you have to if he pushes\nyou you've got to push back\nit's like when when kids are in a\nsituation\nwhere they express an emotional need and\nthey're met with like a wall\nwhat the kid learns to do is put up the\nwall themselves\nand so as adults these people become\nfiercely independent\nor afraid of forming connections and\nkeep people at arm's length\nand so the solution to these things and\nthe good news is that\nearly on we thought that this stuff was\ndetermined in childhood\nnow because of the primacy of selection\neffects which basically means\nearly on you can't control your\nattachment style but later on\nit turns out that the people that you\nhang out with and how emotionally\navailable they are\ncan actually fix your attachment style\nso the people you hang out with are\ngoing to be crucial and what we want you\nto do to fix your attachment style is\nfirst of all\nbecome aware and acknowledge your own\nemotional needs\nno matter how irrational they are and\nsecondly\ncommunicate your half-baked confusing\nidiotic emotional needs\nto your partner and let them emotionally\nmirror remember they don't have to fix\nanything\nthey don't have to change themselves\nthey don't have to do any of that all\nyou really need to become more securely\nattached and understand your emotions\nbetter\nis for someone to just mirror and\nacknowledge what you feel\nokay questions\nyou"
