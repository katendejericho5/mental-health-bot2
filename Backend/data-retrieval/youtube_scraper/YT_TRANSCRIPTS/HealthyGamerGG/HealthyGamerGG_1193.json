super\nexcited about is also the meditation\nmodule so for those of you who are\ncurious\nabout understanding you know my approach\nto meditation like what are the\ndifferent\nit's there's a lot of theoretical\nunderstanding as well as\num you know 20 practices or more so if\nyou guys are interested in that you know\ngo ahead and check out the guides\nso how's it going good buddy how are you\ni am good a little hectic this morning\nuh\nyou know as i told you before coming\nhere but\nyeah i woke up really early i had to get\na bunch of stuff done and then uh\ncame back home just in the nick of time\ncool friday's we're calling you fridays\nthose days where everyone sort of you\nknow does their thing comes home and\nrelax and then i'm just\ni'm one of those people where it's like\nfriday's the busiest day of my week\ntwo weeks i think that is uh\nmy work schedule is more geared towards\nthe weekend like weekends are where i\njust sort of\nget all of my stuff done and then i try\nto make a\nrelaxing weekday for me you know as much\nas i can\nthat i'm really all over the place so\nit's like\nwhen it comes to weekends after i'm done\nmy work i don't\nmy off time is doing more busy stuff is\ndoing more like intricate stuff\nso that's that's that that's what comes\ndown you know it's like there's really\nthere's really no moment where i'm like\ncompletely off you know like just\nrelaxing on a weekend\nso um with ours uh thanks for coming on\nby the way and and dude what do you go\nabout pleasure to be on\nmy name is uh just muda mudahar it works\ni'm actually glad you're one of the few\npeople that first messaged me and it\nwasn't like hi mr ordinary gamers\nbecause i get that a lot and\nyou know yeah it's never fun give me\njust one second i'm gonna try to just\nswitch our server and see if that fixes\nit\nso so you go by mudahar yeah that's what\ni go by\nyour first name um\nyeah no go ahead i thought i was just uh\ni was getting like a weird\nthing on here but yeah no i know it's a\npretty weird unorthodox\nyou know first name and everything\nhow many people have it yeah so mudahar\nversus mutahar\ndo you know which one uh i should go in\nno\nthat is uh no mudahar is fine i never\nwent with the second one that's\nokay i got it that that may be i\nmay i may get it wrong a couple of times\noh don't worry about it almost everyone\nalmost everyone gets it wrong\nmuda sounds very texan so i just got to\nchannel my inner texans\noh you're from you're from texas that's\nsome good stuff i've been down there a\nfew times so\ni hope to go again when all of our\nlockdowns take you know\nyeah and restrictions go down and how\nlong have you been in canada\nuh my whole life really wow uh\ni would say i would say like if you're\ntalking about me moving here probably\nwhen i was less than a year old so\ni wasn't i wasn't born up here in canada\nbut you know i'm\npretty much born canadian if you will\nright\nyou know i'm surprised by how how\nsimilar your accent sounds to people\ndown here\nyou know i i thought about that too for\na while when i lived in the states a\nlittle bit uh the first i ever lived in\nthe states was michigan everyone told me\nthat i didn't sound canadian and i was\nlike what is the\nwhat is the metric for sounding canadian\nyou know what i mean\nand then i drove an hour up from where i\nlive and then i was like oh that's what\nthe real canadian sounds like okay\nall right okay that's really off\nso you said you moved here um you moved\nto canada when you were a year old\nfrom where yeah uh india you know\nand what what part of india are your\nparents from uh\nmy whole family is uh from luck now\nutter pradesh uh\nyou got like half my family from luck\nnow and then you got half my family who\nlike\nmove to pakistan during the partition so\nit's like it's just spread across the\nboard you know\nokay um so i i have family back home but\ni would say like\nmy side of the family where i'm from\nwere were indian\nyou know yeah got it and it was there\nsomething in particular that you wanted\nto talk about today muda\nhonestly uh as i mentioned this earlier\nit's just the idea of the whole like\nlockdowns on isolation it's just been\ninsane\nthe last from a canadian i think we've\nhad the worst lockdowns\nuh when i look at all my american\nfriends right like they're able to go\nout for like months on end and we've\nbeen locked down for like six seven\nmonths straight like the hardest\nlockdowns no stores open\nno nothing everything has been\ncompletely curbside yeah uh\nmeeting family has been the hardest\nbecause\nyou you know when you go to meet family\nin canada during the lockdown\nyou have to you have to do what's known\nas car tetris i guess where you have to\nlike park your cars in like\na block over so the police driving by\ndoesn't like notice like more than four\npeople are in a house meeting each other\ndespite them being family so it's been a\ncomplete like everyone is stuck home\nand the entire government sort of pushed\nthis just talk over zoom which\nisn't the healthiest thing right like\nyou can't just sit over and hold on a\nsecond if there are four\ncars in a parking lot the police will\nyeah if they if they notice more than\nlike two cars in a driveway they have\nthe idea that there's like a big\ngathering in the area and then they just\ncome in and find you like crazy and it's\noh my god so they're just like police\nlike patrolling\nyour residential streets yeah\noh yeah well there was a there was a\npoint i think two months ago where they\ngave like the\ntoronto like greater toronto area police\nofficers the right to just like\npull your car over on the drive like out\non the road\nand they could pull you over and ask you\nwhat you were doing and they could like\nfine you i guess if you didn't get the\nright answer\nno cop ever enforced that all the police\nchief said that was a bad idea so\nthat's where we were for a while in\ncanada at least\nuh all while they didn't stop all the\ninternational travel so\neveryone from around the world just kept\ncoming in and we had to like you know\nstay in our houses which\num i'm not like i'm not a doctor so i\ndon't want to like elaborate more on\nthat i'm sure there's a reason but like\nyou know it's just at some point it gets\ntoo hard to deal with you know like\ntrying to meet your family i haven't\nseen my family well now i've seen them\nyou know in the last several weeks but\nthere was a period where i was like okay\nlet's you know talk over the phone i\nguess let's facetime each other and it\nwas\nit was never the same because i took it\nvery much for granted before the\nlockdown ever began\ni was always like a solo guy like i was\nalways living you know on my own and\nhaving a good time\nbut we would always go meet each other\nover the weekends right like you know\ndinners you know go out to eat and then\nit's like for the last six months\nthere was like a period where they\nstopped the lockdown for like 12 hours\nand then they just started it up again\nthat same night so we had\nwe had lockdowns over six months i would\nsay and then it was just we were\nyeah we were completely separated\nhardcore in\nin the province that i'm in what's that\nbeen like for you\nuh i would say the worst\ni mean like i said it's it's something\nthat i definitely took for granted\nhardcore and i'll never take it again\nfor granted after right like the last\ntime i could remember\ngoing out for like a meal with friends\nwas like august of\n2019 you know like that's what like 2019\nis where like my last you know brain\nkicks in like wow that was when uh\nthings were normal\nand then i had a flight to texas you\nknow\nbecause we had packed south with friends\nand i went over there we had a good time\nthe moment i flew back january 2020 is\nlike when the whole lockdown started\nramping up and you know this whole\ncobin 19 broke down and then\nin home ever since you know work from\nhome\ndo nothing occasionally meeting friends\nyou know\nonce in a while but so other than that\nwhen you say it's been rough like\nin what way has it affected you\ni i miss having people next to me you\nknow i miss having people over you know\neven if it is just a talk right like\ni have very like i would say minimal\nsocial needs i don't need to go anywhere\nyou know what i mean i need to like\nexperience\nthe world in that you know traditional\nway what most people expect\ni i i i like to i like the concept of\nhaving friends over even if it is just\nto watch a movie over there to have a\ndrink or you know play a video game or\nsomething\nor have a barbecue over at my house like\nbefore the whole\ncoronavirus i used to see my uh got\nchild every once in a while right like\nwe went over there we had a whole family\nthing\nuh it's been over a year since that's\nhappened and he's already grown up to\nlike\nyou know just like kids grow fast so now\nit's just\noh wow it's been over a year i mean what\nam i gonna do\nand that's where we're at you know it's\nit really sets\ninto stone how important it is to have\nlike an actual physical\nconnection and like be there to other\nbecause you can't do it over the\ninternet like no matter what anyone says\nyou can't do you know zoom calls you\ncan't do\neven when it comes to work right like\nwhen it came to my job\nwe do like a small business over here so\nwe're like we're like a family right we\nsee each other in the office all the\ntime now that we're home\nyou know what the heck right like it's\nall over the place you know even\neven physical health-wise you know\nwhereas i used to go out and do\nactivities here and there now\nbecause we're all locked in you know\nwhat are you gonna do right like\nyour timings are all over the place what\nwhat do you do\nhow do you spend your uh for me my\nwell i have a pretty strict schedule now\nfor work right like i start work at like\neight o'clock\ni end it by 3 30 p.m like i used to a\nyear or two ago like i used to be\nhardcore into that 24 hour no work life\nbalance which\ncompletely threw me out for a loop right\nit was the worst thing you can ever do\nwith your health\nso now i have like this you know i wake\nup early\nfinish you know sometime reasonably\nbefore the sun goes down and then i go\nout for a walk you know i\ngo out and you know run here and there\nor\nyou know just breed some fresh air and\nthen by like seven o'clock i'll wind\ndown\nand and muda can you just can we\nactually rewind a little bit can you\ntell me a little bit about what\ngrowing up in canada was like and stuff\nlike that growing up in canada\nis about i guess one could expect like i\nmean i had a normal childhood i'm not\ngonna i don't have like\nwild stories but i'll say as an indian\nkid growing up post 9 11 that's\nthe one thing that i would remember the\nhardest a lot of people make canada out\nlike it's this\ncrazy multicultural loving society and\nthat's true for\nyou know 95 of the scenarios but when\nyou're the only indian kid growing up\nafter you know\nwhat is one of the greatest north\namerican tragedies you know\nthere's going to be a lot of people who\nlook at you and in a way\nthat whole experience probably shaped me\ninto the person that i am\nbecause i've always said this on stream\nright like when i went through\nthat period of you know being bullied\nfor being isolated based on you know\nwho i was i could either absolutely you\nknow\nlet this ruin me or i could just you\nknow hunker down\ni could realize okay i can take this\nadversity and i can you know channel it\nand i can\nturn it into a productive you know i i\ncan fight against it in a productive\nmanner and i feel like that's what i've\ndone now so it's\nhow do you do that uh work hard\nyou know back when i back as indian kids\ngrowing up you know as asian kids your\nparents always tell you about\nhow important it is you know to be good\nat school you know you always got to get\na pluses you always got to do this you\nalways got to do that\nand growing up in canada in that\nenvironment\nit's so much more important it's so much\nstronger to realize that\nthe only way that you can prove your\nworth in society right and at least this\nis how i learned is\nyou have to get into the system and you\nhave to be the best of the best in the\nsystem regardless of how much it is\nstacked against you right so\ni would say for an immigrant kid\nliterally an immigrant child\nyou know it's probably two times harder\nthan the average person you have to deal\nwith over here but\nit is doable regardless of how much you\nhave to sacrifice in your life\nand i've had to sacrifice you know high\nschool is when i pretty much started\nworking and only now at 27 am i winding\ndown my life\nyou know like only now do i feel like i\ncan breathe right so\nit's uh it's it's been a journey like\ngrowing up especially here especially\nwith how\num you know that environment was post 9\n11 right\nwow yeah and and so\nlet me just think for a second so do you\nhave siblings you mind if i ask\ni have uh one brother yeah okay older\nyounger\nyounger five years younger than me and\nand did you get a sense of\nso so you're you're like a full-time\nyoutuber now right\nuh it's a hobby sort of but okay yeah\nyeah hobbyist at this point so when you\nsay so when you say you work from eight\nto three thirty can you help me\nunderstand what\nwhat you consider work so eight to three\nthirty\nis when i start up my actual work\ncomputer because i have two separate\ncomputers right like a work computer and\nthen like a gaming computer right i keep\nit completely separate because\nwhen i have games installed on my work\ncomputer it\nyou know mine goes somewhere else i'll\nplay this match in there so i started my\nwork computer uh\nwhen it comes to my actual you know job\ni work as you know i work investing and\nyou know at this point right like stock\nmarket stuff so\ni got to wake up i got to wake up early\ni got to like screen stuff and i got to\nlike screen stocks and i got to like\nlook at investments so i'll buy and sell\nearly in the morning\nand i'm usually done by like noon\nif i'm you know oh so i missed that so\nyou're like a day trader\nyeah i used to be but now it's just you\nknow at this point that that was what i\nused to do for a while and now things\nhave become more\nrelaxed so it's just buying and selling\nand that's pretty much what it is for me\nso buying large commodities and putting\nthem on the market selling and things of\nthat nature\nand so what did you think you were going\nto do in high school\noh man i had no prospects coming out of\nhigh school i was so\nin the middle of work and studying that\naround the time of 11th grade\nbecause in high school they tell you is\nyour 11th grade results and your 12th\ngrade results is what matters to go to\ncollege\ni was so busy at the time that i was\nlike man what did i want to do\num if i had any goal in my life\nuh it was to be a lawyer because that's\ni would consider that have been my dream\njob for the longest time is to work in\nlaw\nbut uh this is a point where money going\ninto law school is probably one of the\nafter medical school it might be the\nsecond most expensive form of schooling\nmaybe\ntoe to toe so that wasn't a reality for\nme at the time\nafter high school it was just i actually\napplied to the army but\nyou know that didn't go anywhere\neventually i just worked\ni went to university for computer\nsciences and that's it\nand and so you said you were working in\nhigh school what kind of work did you do\nin high school\nuh just computer work early and that's\nwhat i was doing you know your basic\nlike part-time work nothing you know\nsubstantial i was also a student at the\ntime and\nin fact a lot of my work really ended up\nbeing just like basic community\nservice work just to rack on the hours\nbecause in canada you have to do your\nminimal amount of community service to\ngraduate like 40 hours\nbut 40 hours is like the minimum you\nneed like\nway over 40 if you want to get into a\ngood university or at least even have an\nattempt\nso i was always working for free either\nthat making some part-time cash on the\nside\num and that's pretty much or you know\ngetting my\nstudies done some night schooling\nbecause we had to get more credits than\ni had because i moved around a lot\nduring high school\nin america and canada so when you move\naround during high school\nyour credits don't carry over sometimes\nso i had to take some extra classes to\neven be able to graduate and get into\nuniversity so it was a hectic period\nhectic four years of my life\nthat you know that doesn't sound very\nfun\nit is absolutely the most unfun thing\nand\nyou know what makes it even more unfun\nis when you're not good at a lot of your\nsubjects like i was never good at\nenglish\ni didn't have a lot of good creative\nclasses i was in the only class that i\nwas really\nreally good at was math that's about it\nthat's my background right like math is\none of those things where it's like okay\nyou give me a formula i'll be able to\nyou know\nextrapolate based on that but uh i i\nliterally could not do\ni i was just i wasn't really feeling all\nthe other subjects i was good at it like\ni could get good grades but\nyou're not feeling it right like i don't\nwant to go to this english class like\nsure i'll\nget your 90 and i'll call it a day but\nit's not fun for me it's not engaging me\nuh the only class that i actually even\never enjoyed\nasides from math which i'm saying\nenjoyed because\ni i like numbers you know to an extent\nwas a video production class it was sort\nof like you know one of those electives\nyou would have\nyou would just pick in so i was like i\nget to edit videos on final cut pro it\nsounds like you worked really hard in\nhigh school\ntalking about taking night classes doing\ncommunity service\nlike side jobs on the side like mm-hmm\nyeah no it's it's blurred i'll i'll help\nyou understand\nyeah i mean can you help me understand\nlike what was in your mind\nlike if you're a sophomore in high\nschool\nlike my mind was to in my head i had\nthis long-term goal of keeping my grade\npoint average\nabove a certain point right that's my\nlong-term goal\num in sophomore year super important\nbecause in my head\ni always think like this right like when\nthey told me that 11th grade and 12th\ngrade was the important grades where\nthey would calculate them like there's\nno way you're ever going to be\nsuccessful in those grades if you don't\nstart that success from the 9th grade or\nthe 10th grade era right like if you're\njust slacking off for the first two\nyears\nthat mentality rolls in to those last\ntwo years so i was always\nworking hard and maintaining my gpas\nhaving my prerequisites all of that\nstuff even when we were moving around\nright i was calculating okay i just lost\nthese many credits\ni gotta have this much to graduate i was\nthere was a point man for like\n11th grade i was just focused on can i\ngraduate normally do i have to like\nvictory lap based on how much i moved\naround\nyou know that's that's what was running\nin my head so\num and i remember like moving around my\ndad who\nis in the medical field he moves around\na lot because of it uh i never\never told him that yeah this is really\npiling on to me dad because i didn't\nwant to like you know be a burden on it\ni don't want to tell him to\nknow screw your job over because i'm\ntelling you so i just kind of rolled\nwith it i\ndealt with the punches because i'm\ntelling you high school felt like i was\nin the longest boxing match of my life\nand there was no breaks right like it\nwas just that's punch\npunch it was punch punch punch dude even\nsummer breaks we had those two month\nbreaks and for a lot of students for a\nlot of guys it's like two months off\ni hold on i'm just getting a little two\nmonths off\ni it feels like forever for me two\nmonths off felt like a weekend now you\nknow\nit's just like all right school's ended\nokay i got some homework i got to focus\non what's happening\ngoing into this next grade i got to make\nsure that you know i have i even had\nlike a money\nyou know like goal too because i was\nlike i got to save enough cash\nin order to even think of going to\ncollege or university right so\nwow yeah like i would say\ngrowing up for me happened uh forcibly\nyou know\na lot of people get to enjoy their life\nlike you know their younger age they get\nto make their mistakes\ni was on like a tight rope with no\nsafety net\nimagine having the imagine having the\nlike the the skinniest thread going\nacross the niagara falls\nand you have to cross the entire thing\nand there's no safety net\nso that's what my life kind of felt like\nfelt like for a while\nwhen did you realize how old were you\nwhen you realized that you have no\nsafety net\nuh probably\nfirst year of college i would say when i\nwhen i got into college right because\nwhen i i thought when i got into\nuniversity for a while and i dropped out\nlike a semester in because i was like\nokay no no i'm not doing\nbecause university of toronto like the\nfirst semester that you went in you paid\nthis\ncrazy amount and uh\nat this point i started you know getting\nmore work on the side i started building\nup a career so i was like wait a minute\ndo i choose to go through this\nuniversity path which will work for me\nor to go on the career path that's when\ni realized like okay i'm on that tight\nrope you know like i'm on\ni've got no safety in it like i'm after\nhigh school high school was that era\nwhere i could make my mistakes right\nnow i'm in college now i'm in the\nprofessional field you know now i'm like\non my own i have to make money to pay my\nmortgages or\nrent at the time and that's when i\nrealized okay now i can't make a single\nmistake\nnow i'm stuck in now whatever i choose\nto go\nwhatever choice i make now will affect\nmy weeks going on forward that's where\nmy mind was\nyou know first year of college i find\nthat a little bit hard to believe\num because i i know it sounds kind of a\nweird thing to say but like\nit sounds to me like you you were sort\nof really think\ni mean maybe you had a safety net of\nsorts but it sounds to me like even when\nyou were a freshman or sophomore in high\nschool you were like\ni gotta start now like you know it's i\nalmost hear that mentality there\nlike even earlier than college where\nlike if you screw up\nin 10th grade there's no way you can do\nwhat you need to in 11th grade or 12th\ngrade\nno i i'll say that i had the mentality\nin high school like that then\nbecause like i told you earlier i was\nlike okay i got to make sure my grades\nare good yeah\nto get accepted into college but when i\ngot into college right you think like\nfor a second that you can breathe for a\nbit now that you're in college you know\nyou've gotten into\nthe university you've wanted to you're\ninto the program and it's still hard\nright like it you know it's\nit's not high school you know advanced\nanymore it's still\nit's it's you're professional at that\npoint and i think the reality of\nwhen i turned 18 and i became a full\nadult and you know i didn't have my\nparents to depend on anymore\ni had like it felt like every choice\ndecision that i was making was\ncompletely on me and like\ncollege that you know 18 to like 25 was\nthat moment where like every\ndecision i make will affect how my life\nis forward i feel like that's\nthat's where i realized like okay you\nknow call high school\nmaybe i could have made a mess up or two\nright maybe\nyou know but not not in my college or\nprofessional\nlife you sound very um\nyou know like the future was sort of\nlike bearing down on you like every\nsingle day like that's\nsort of what i'm feeling it's like\nthere's sort of this i still feel like\nthat man i mean\neven though like i'm 27 now and i think\ni've got my life together\ni still think about what life is going\nto be like at 40 for me right\nand yeah it's interesting because my dad\none day sat me down\nyou know just before the pandemic he's\nlike because i told him this exact same\nconversation that we're having right now\nit's\ndeja vu for me i told him about like i\ngot a prep for my life at 40 and my dad\none time he told me he's like do you\neven know if you're going to be alive at\n40. like my dad had this conversation it\nwas a weird conversation\nlike dad why would you think that right\nlike and the dad's like no it's a legit\nquestion like are you gonna be\nyou know alive at 40. like how do you\nknow that\nhow do you know why are you choosing to\nlike live for life and\nwhy are you prepping for 40 when you're\nnot even living now\nand even though we had that conversation\nit's hard to ever get out of that\nmindset you know like it's there's never\na night\ni have where i go to bed and i don't\nthink\ntomorrow you know the responsibilities\nthat i have right like\nyou know all of that just sort of\ncompiles on you\ni would absolutely love to have like a\nmental guide map i feel like\nthis is this is actually a really great\nquestion for me i\ni look at life in the numbers and like\nwhat's there you know like\ngood example right like when i look at\nthings tomorrow right i'm like this is\nhow much i need to pay for my bill\ntomorrow my mortgage you know every\npayment for the next six seven months\nright i look at it from a numbers\nperspective right like this is what i\nneed\nbut i never look at myself right i never\nrealized what do i need to make sure\nmentally\nis what i'm prepared for for the next\nday right like\nwhat how do i make sure that i'm\nmentally like sane six months from now\nright how do i make sure that i don't\noverwork myself to like you know literal\ninsanity so yeah i would actually like\nthe help there is there a problem\nyes there's a big problem that's because\nyour goal\nis actually reinforcing the problem\nso it's subtle but you're like\nyou know so like instead of thinking\nabout dollars like you've said oh\nmuda has like a bank account and he has\nlike\na mental bank account and what i'm doing\nright now is i'm withdrawing money from\nmy mental bank account to make sure my\nphysical bank account is good\nhow do i ensure that my mental bank\naccount\nis nice and full you see what i'm saying\nbut it's still that that mentality of\nlike how do i make sure that tomorrow is\ngonna be okay\nyeah and and we could talk about\nisolation in the pandemic if you want to\ni i you know this is it's\nit's really your i feel like it's more i\nfeel like it's more interesting to hit\nthe root of my actual mental problem\nhere\nyeah if you're gay this is yeah this is\nway beyond isolation this is like my\nentire life\nyep and that's what we're here so let's\nyou okay diving in a little bit\nyeah i'm okay diving in okay if i if you\nask you a question that makes you\ni'll let you know if i want to answer\nyeah yeah\nright okay um i was about to say it\nmakes you uncomfortable but\ni think it's okay for me to ask you\nquestions that make you uncomfortable\nand you got to let me know if i step too\nfar\nokay okay so i'm i'm going to start with\nso\ntell me what it's like to live one day\nin your head\nif i was an observer in your head what\nwould what would i witness\nwell you'd witness me waking up\nand immediately checking all my emails\nwork things for what we have to do today\nfor the next week throughout the week\nyou know doing all of that busy work in\nyour head making all your calls making\nall you know\nyou know your day-to-day communication\nand then uh living\nbasically i would say hour by hour as to\nhandling in and making sure all of your\nwork responsibilities are met day-to-day\ni would say that if you were an observer\nlooking in you'd probably notice that\nfor an hour in the morning\ni get to breathe a little bit and then\nfor the rest of the day it's like\nautopilot\nyou know like work i'm doing this and\nthen towards the end of the day like you\nknow\n4 4 35 is when you get to see me again\nright like i've entered my body\nseeing me be myself and what what is\nwhat is it like when you enter your body\nagain\nit's uh\ni guess it's like a feeling of just i\nguess uh\nwell for one you know you you get to\nbreathe again you know you get to be\nyourself you get to focus on what your\nhobbies are you get to focus on what you\nwant to do for the rest of the day right\nnow you finally gotten your body back\nso for me it's like hey do i go out for\na walk or do i go home and i sit and\nprogram something that i'm into because\none of the things that i love to do\nafter work is i love to you know sit\naround and program and tinker with you\nknow a couple computers that i have\nsitting around over here so for me\nthe rest of the day is just basically\nwhat i love you know like\nwhat i actually want to do not what i\nhave to do to to survive\nday by day right so for me that's what\nit comes down to and then\nthat's pretty much what it is regardless\nof what my channel name is some ordinary\ngamers i do\ni don't do a whole lot of gaming\nthroughout the week unfortunately\nbecause of responsibilities anymore\nbut uh you know that's the day of my\nlife an observer if you will\num i'm doing something every hour\nthere's never a point where i sit down\nand i\ni really breathe you know like i have\nlike my moments but i'm always\nwhat happens when you sit down and try\nto breathe\ni honestly can't like everyone gives me\nadvices on meditation uh you know like\nbreathe for like 15 minutes\nyou know do something and i keep doing\nit but like there's this feeling of\nanxiety\ni would say like there's this feeling\nthat a physical feeling it's almost like\nyou know when your\nthroat is raspy\nyou know what i mean like it almost\nfeels like it's just you're throwing\nlava down your throat like it's just\nit's\nyou just don't feel good it's kind of\nlike a panic attack if you will because\ni feel like i have to be doing something\nit could be anything it could be\nsomething it could literally be me like\nyou know spinning something in my hand\nright like a fidget spinner whatever\nanything but i i don't know if i can sit\ndown in a chair\nand just close my eyes and breathe\nnon-stop for 15 minutes because in my\nhead i'm always like wow you could have\ndone something productive you could have\ndone something\nyou've just sat down and literally did\nnothing you know you just sat down in\nyour own head\nmy brain doesn't allow me to sort of\nthink for a little bit to\nto be in my head you know because my\nhead there's another voice that tells me\nyou gotta do this you gotta do that you\ngot to make sure this is done\nyou're wasting your time you know you\nhave this responsibility for tomorrow\nyou got to make sure that it's set\nlike i had i had a video project that i\nhad to get done\non friday one time this was a month ago\ni uh i do a big video project on my\nchannel every month\nso i divide up the whole thing you know\nlike i'll do an hour of it\none day and then i'll do an hour of it\nthe other day so i've already divided it\nyou know but even though that i've\nallocated one hour of my day to this\nproject\nwhen i sit down to breathe i'm like you\ncould have applied this half an hour to\nthis project and sort of gotten it done\nfaster you could have made the project\nbetter\nso when i'm uploading this video in my\nhead i'm like wow it could be way better\nthan what i did\ni wasted you know free time it'll always\nconstantly run through your head like\nthere's never a there's never a point\nwhere your brain will allow you to stop\nand\nthink and be yourself it's always you\ncan do something you can be doing\nsomething\nyou're not doing anything so i wouldn't\nsay worthless feeling but you know\nit's it's not healthy at the same time i\ndon't know how to exactly describe that\ni don't know the term if it exists but\nhow does it feel to share that\nah it doesn't yeah it feels\nweird like i keep a lot of this in my\nhead man yeah\ni never have the i don't think i have\nthe courage to ever describe this\nto people you know like if you were to\nsit across from me and you asked me hey\nare you okay\ni would most likely give you a lie like\ni would lie to your face and be like i'm\ntotally\nyou know like i don't think i have the\nwhy does it require courage to i just\nfeel like i'm\nopening myself i feel like i'm coming\nacross as weak when i tell you like\ni you know i'm calling myself this\nworthless individual in my head i don't\nwant to like reiterate that same thing\nto you i'll tell you that i'm doing fine\nlike even when it came to my parents\nright it's like are you okay like are\nyou doing so i would always tell them\nyeah\ni'm absolutely wonder like even even\nwhen we were moving around and i could\nmy dad like hey moving around in high\nschool would have been pretty bad like\nit would have added stress i'm like no\ndad it's 100 great i'll make it work\nabsolutely so you know this is one lie\nyou keep telling yourself and you try to\nlie enough about that that you end up\nbelieving\nyourself i guess i feel weak in my head\nlike\ni can't i don't have the i don't have\nthe courage to tell somebody that i feel\nweak in my\ni've always felt that those feelings\nare a lot easier to deal with if you can\nbottle it up\nand punch through the day you know what\ni mean the boxing match that never ends\nthe boxing match that'll never end\nlike some days it feels like it feels\nlike i i guess\nit just it's like it's like somebody's\nshooting me you know what i mean\nit's like it's like it's like it's like\ni'm getting shot every day right like\nit's like that feeling right like that\npunch to your stomach you know what i\nmean and it's like\nyou can tell somebody that it hurts you\ncan tell somebody that it you know\nyou know you can lean on somebody or you\ncan just sort of\ndeal with the fact that it happened to\nyou and move on you know if that makes\nany sense right like\nyou know you've you've already had the\nimpact\nso are you gonna are you gonna waste\ntime sticking with it are you gonna\nwaste time\nthinking to yourself what you could have\nchanged or will you just proceed to go\non or will you fight on ahead right\nyeah persevere yeah perseverance exactly\nyou know\nthe strong survive type mentality that\nlike\nthere's no time for a break your brain\nwon't let you sit quietly for 15 minutes\nabsolutely not because you have to\npersevere\nand if you don't then your brain will\ntell you you're wasting time\ndo you feel me sharing this right now\nyeah actually\nto be honest with you i feel uh yeah i\nfeel i\ni i got i gotta i gotta i gotta\ni have spent my entire life bottling\nthings up you know like if anything is\ngenuinely hurting me mentally\ni felt that it's easier if i can just\nbottle it up and push on but i've got\nyou know younger siblings i've got\nparents you know like\nthe older they get the more i gotta take\ncare of them so it's like i gotta be in\nthat mentality\nin some ways i gotta get used to be the\nstone if you will right like this\ntanooki suit from\nmario which is like just perfectly still\nlike it just nothing can affect it\nyeah i know the thing about the tanooki\nsuit is that you can't move anywhere\nstay stuck\ni mean i know listen in my head i know\nat one point like for a long time\nthat if i keep doing it will be the\ndeath of me like physically\nif i if i choose to keep doing this\nconcept of\nif i choose if i choose to keep bottling\nmyself up\ni am eventually killing myself by doing\nyou know because there's no way that\ni i feel like mentally i'll be able to\nkeep doing it for 10 more years like if\ni'm 35 36 still bottling and things\nthat's going to be where my brain stops\nworking and\nyou know i'm just either i become such\nan emotionless person either i do with\nit that i lose who i am\nor you know gets worse it's\nunsustainable it's just not possible\nit's not something healthy but i don't\nknow the way out i don't know how to\nescape it\nwhat scares me the most is i won't ever\nfigure out how to escape it\nwhat's your understanding of\nwhat's my understanding of okay i think\nfor a second muda\nyeah yeah no absolutely go ahead take\nyour time\ni don't want to feel like i'm one of\nyour you know hard cases or something\nlike\nyeah so sorry i i i i get the sense\nyou're very anxiously looking at my face\nand trying to interpret\nhow i'm sitting with what you're sharing\nso let me just start talking because\ni've\ni'm afraid that if i sit silently for a\nminute your mind is gonna\nlike create all kinds of negative\nthoughts does that make sense yeah yeah\nit already is beginning so what is it\nshare with me what your mind is\ntelling you right now well in your head\nwhen you look around it's like when you\nhave when your eyes open up a little bit\nand you're you know it's like earlier\nyou're like the [ __ ] right like you were\njust like what's going on with\ni was like man in my head for a second\ni'm like i guess i'm i guess i'm too far\ngone i guess i'm just one of those\npeople that he's like\ni thought this guy was you know i\nthought i thought i thought you know i\ncould do some work with this guy and i\nwas just\noh he's gone i uh uh i'm i'm very\nconfident that we can do work i can\ni can feel very good about helping you\nwith this\num so so but and and i i think it's\ntricky because no matter what i say even\nif i\nif i say something like that i would\nimagine that instead of being reassured\nyou would actually feel like\nmaybe a little bit ashamed if i say\nsomething like that\ndo you detect it actually actually you\nhit it right on the money there\nright now yeah\nnow now what what is it tell me when i\nsay\nno no don't worry i can absolutely help\nyou with this and then what do you feel\ni don't know i just i guess i feel like\nthe the positivity like sort of the\nlaugh for a second that you had\nit almost i would feel like it's kind of\nlike a pitying in a way you know what i\nmean like i don't know we can we can\ndeal with it\nit's just it's it's hard for my brain to\nbelieve it\nyou know it's hard for my brain to\nbelieve it after so long what does it\nbelieve\nwhat is it my brain believes it's my\nbrain honestly believes\nso it's my brain just telling me that\nit's all like just bs and you can't just\ndo it you know\nyeah my my brain is working against it\nit's very difficult to explain how it's\nworking against it but it's it's it's\ntreating this whole scenario like\nlike it's it's all a joke and maybe like\nsomeone's pitying you for what you're in\nright now\num but i mean i i'm trying like in my\nhead i'm trying to convince myself yeah\nokay\nyou know this is help right i don't want\nit to be pity\nno yeah we're good we're gonna help you\nout so we're gonna calm your brain down\nyou ready\nokay yeah so it's it's better to be dead\nthan weak\nright that's true yeah you know you\ndon't like\nlike it's fine to suffer but like you\ndon't actually like need someone's help\nyou don't need your pity you can punch\nthrough\nyou know and if like if the cost is your\nmental health if the cost is a heart\nattack\nthat's a price we're willing to pay\nit's all good like we can handle that\nwe've survived this [ __ ] no mess\nyou know how messed up it is that i\nbelieve that 100 that is like\nthat is a mantra i could live by like\nit's better to be dead than it is weak\nthat's that's you've literally hit my\nlife [ __ ] like you\nyou like you know like you walk into an\noffice and they have like their company\nslogan\nyou've exactly like wrote the company\nslogan out there it's better to be dead\nthan it is\nyeah when you say you could live your\nlife by it bro you have been living your\nlife\nyeah you're right i haven't looked any\nother way hypothetical my dude\nyeah no no it's not\nyeah exactly i'm making it sound like i\ncould be in the situation no i\nam in the situation i am living in that\ni built the entire house myself\nyeah absolutely yeah right absolutely i\nmean it's like you know that's your\ncompany slogan this is the house that\nyou've built\nright that's the bet i made you know i\nbetter lay in it i guess\nabsolutely right it's it's my i chose\nthis\nyeah right i have no one to blame i\ndon't need anyone's help no one needs to\npity me like\ni did this yeah no 100\ni i mean like i think of life as like in\na way i know that i said isolation i i\ni said it earlier that i'm a very like\nreserved like i'll\nengage with everyone around me but in a\nlot of ways and\nif if i guess i feel i guess i feel like\nin my head like the only life i've ever\nknown is being\nalone on an island or sort of by\nyourself trudging through every aspect\nof your life yourself because it's like\nfor me i don't think i can rely on\nanyone professionally i always put it on\nto myself and that's\nhow i've succeeded in my life and that's\nhow i'll continue to succeed i think\nit's very hard for me to include any\nfull partner you know what i mean like\nuh\nhonestly i i feel like a lot of my\nrelationships in life have failed right\nlike\nwell you know romantic relationships\nbecause i choose to\nit's great for a while but then i just\ntend to reserve and\nget back into myself and it's hard for\nme to end up trusting anyone else and\nsort of confiding anymore like\nliterally the conversation that we just\nhad now i could never have even if i was\nwe're talking like two years into our\nrelationship if we talk\nnever this this is never going to happen\nme and you we can never be together\ni don't know i mean it could have been\nlife is\nyou know what i mean who knows but like\nthat conversation that like level of\nokay you gave me my company slogan we\nwould never even get like\na quarter into that conversation like\nanything they would like ask me\nuh you know it's like are you okay my\nresponse would be like i'm great\nyou know like yeah perfect absolutely\nyou know how's work\neven though i could have had the worst\nday like i could have lost a contract\ni'm like it's great\nwhat would it what would it mean to say\nthings aren't going great\nwhat would it mean to say things aren't\ngoing great for me is if you could look\naround me and see the entire burning\npile that i'm in you know\nlike if my if my if you walked by my\noffice and it was like yeah foreclosed\neverything gone company's dead you know\nthey have to dissolve\nthat's what it would take for me to say\nyeah you know\nit's not no but so so let's say that\nthat you you just had a bad day\nwhat would it mean to you or what would\nyour brain tell you if you tried to\nshare with someone\noh my brain would tell me you don't\nshare because like that other person\nthey're probably going to look at you\nlike wow this is the guy that\nlike what an idiot like only an idiot\nmesses up like that right like kind of\nlike if i lost a contract my brain would\nbe like don't tell them that they'll\nthink you're a [ __ ] idiot for telling\nthat they'll think you didn't look you\ncan't even do your job you're like\nyou're like inept doing your job because\nthat's what my brain says like don't\nbother like even if somebody asks me\nthat like if my parents will do it i'll\nbe like\nwork is going fine don't worry about it\neven though\nyou know if i have a bad day i have a\nbad day i can't you know tell anybody\nanything\nuh uh muda i'd i'd like a moment to\nthink\nbut i i want us to be a little bit\ncareful about what kind of judgments\nyour mind is telling you\nyeah okay um\ni'm just trying to figure out how to\nhelp help you through this a little bit\nand and don't worry you're going to do\nit all on your own i'm just going to\npoint the way you're going to do all the\nheavy lifting okay bro\nall right just can i have a second yeah\nno absolutely go for it\nhow you holding up by the way i i am\ni'm actually surprisingly good right now\ni had a good i had a good day before we\ncame over here like i got all of my work\npretty much done out with so\neverything's great\neverything is fine quite a bad day it'd\nbe up\ni had a i had a good day before we\nstarted this but but it's\nno no i have a good day now but like\nthat would have like if\ni had a terrible if i didn't get my job\nlike if i didn't get my work done before\nwe started i would have been like in a\ncompletely off mood\nso now i'm just like all right so here's\nhere's what we're getting here's my\nhypothesis okay i'm gonna just lay\nthings out for you because i'm a little\nbit\nconcerned about i want to try to help\nyou participate in the health healthiest\nway possible\none really healthy way to participate is\nthat i can just predict what your brain\nis going to tell you and we can kind of\nlike work through that just notice what\nyour brain is doing\nthat's actually that will help you come\nout of this i know it sounds weird\nbut just noticing these thought patterns\nwill start to give you power over them\nokay okay but what i'd really like to do\nis i i think that basically what's going\non is that you\nhave like this programming in your head\nand i think it actually comes from a\nparticular place\nand as we understand like\nwhere that programming comes from is we\nunderstand why that voice\nessentially like started in the first\nplace\nand further more like what has\nreinforced\nthe volume of that voice right because i\ni think\nat this point if we kind of talk about\nit like what we see is that\nit's that voice which has been looking\nout for you\nright like does that make sense\nyeah the the guiding voice in your head\nthat tells you\nhow to succeed day to day yeah yeah\nright but it's also the voice that kind\nof like makes you feel like as you say\nyou get shot on a daily basis\nbecause you know it's all tangled up\nright\nso so what i want you to understand is\nthat like you know our mind\ndoes things to adapt to particular\nsituations\nand then what ends up happening usually\nlater in life\nis that some of those things can be\nbecome maladaptive\nso you learned how to be like\nessentially like a one-man show right\nlike\nyou know i i would guess that while your\nparents probably told you like oh it's\ngood to do\nin school like they weren't the ones\nkeeping track\nof like which classes you need to repeat\nright right like you were doing that for\nyourself so like\nlike like your ability and so that like\nthat sort of self-reliance was probably\nlike\nreally helpful back then but now as you\nmentioned i'm glad you brought it up\nbecause then you know i don't i don't\nhave to but\ni i think like when it comes to romantic\nrelationships and stuff it's going to\ncause problems\nlike because because and so i know it\nsounds weird but\ni'd rather be dead than weak i think\nthat's actually not\nthe original slogan that's the rebrand\ni think actually this problem starts\nwith the phrase\nmaking sure and that if you can\nif you can learn how to like not make\nsure\nthat dot dot dot then\nyour life will be quite different does\nthat make sense\nor is that too vague no it makes sense\nyeah no it's like make sure you don't do\nthis negative thing or else it'll lead\ninto that negative\nyep so i'd say that the really the\ncontrolling thing in your life is like\nyou know and even if you kind of talk\nabout confiding how your day is like\nwhat are you really doing when you\ndon't share how you really feel\nyou're making sure right what are you\nmaking sure\nwhen does that make sense is that like i\nknow it's kind of a weird question\ni guess i'm making sure that i'm like\nnot exposing myself\nexactly right so like what are you\nactually controlling like you're\ncontrolling the perception you're making\nsure\nthat this person does not think about\nyou\nthis way and so what i'm really hearing\nis that like\nlike you know i could be wrong here okay\nso this is i'm presenting you with a\nhypothesis and it's\nyou know you're welcome to push back but\nlike the theme that i'm really hearing\nis that like\nyou're making sure because it's it's\ninteresting because i'm gonna just start\ntying stuff together okay\ncould be relevant i mean i don't really\nknow we're like\nyou know we're in alpha testing here\nokay nowhere near a finished product\nthis idea of like no safety net right\nand and so like if you think about like\nyou know what is someone who's\nyou did a beautiful job of creating this\nimagery of like you know a horse hair\nthat is like stretched across for a\nhundred miles\nand what is someone who has to cross\nthat tightrope\nhave to do they have to make sure\nbecause there's nothing to catch them\nyeah right and like you know why can't\nyou tell people how you feel because you\nhave to make sure\nthat something when you when you know\nwhy do you have to like\nwork you know you wake up every day at 8\n00 a.m and and and you know you're like\noh my work my weekends are my busy days\nbut it sounds like you work seven days a\nweek\nand then i get a little bit of me time\nand then even get a bit of me time yeah\nbut even in the me time right your your\nmind is like you better make sure like\nyou're not going to give yourself\nany me time if your mind says you need\nto make sure\ndot dot dot because in the meantime i'm\nguessing goes out the window\nwe haven't even talked about it but i'd\nalso guess that you know you said two\ntwo hours\ntwo years ago you're saying you would\nwork for 24 hours at a stretch\nno work-life balance and i'd guess that\nthe main thing was that you had to make\nsure\nyou had to make sure this went okay this\ngoes back to your partner business where\nlike you're kind of like i can't really\ntrust anyone right because\nyou have to make sure that everything is\nokay\nyeah so what i feel so like for me it's\nalso\ni guess there's also a feeling of like i\nhave to be in control of myself and i\ncan't just you know\ndeconstruct my feelings and myself in\nfront of somebody else i don't want to\ni guess there's also a feeling of i\ndon't need i don't want to feel like i\never have to rely on\neven if it's in like a roman\nrelationship like i want to feel like if\nif something ever happens in that right\nlike god forbid like a partner passes\naway or something you know what i mean\nlike\nacts of god that i can at least\ncompartmentalize and like make sure that\ni'm still\nme yeah so so i think that's a great\nexample right so because i think here's\nthe thing\nyou can't make sure that acts of god\nwon't happen\nabsolutely so what can you make sure\ni can see in front of me and i feel like\ni can control right like what i think is\nwithin my grasp you know\nso i'm gonna i'm gonna jump a little bit\nhere okay so what you can\nmake sure of is that you don't fall in\nlove with someone that acts of god can\ntake away from you\nright lord i made that mistake yeah\nyeah have your phones\ni fell in love with uh individuals with\nyour health\nthat you know i don't want to elaborate\nfurther because i don't want to like you\nknow\nexpose what they have but point is it's\nit's terminal and i guess i knew that\ngoing ahead of time like falling in love\nwith somebody knowing years later that\nthey would be gone\nexactly the smartest thing i could have\ndone but you know emotions are emotion\nthey tend to happen and\ni made that mistake you know\nin life they're still fine now don't\nworry like they have a few more years to\ngo\nyeah that was you know it's a rare thing\nwhen i say something like that is like a\nhypothetical\nno this person has a well i'll tell you\nthis person has a\npot so it's uh tachycardia it's really\nbad\num they have a couple more syndromes\nregarding it like long qt and everything\nof that nature so\nfor them the they've had to get like\nsinus note surgery modifications like\nburning on their hearts and things like\nthat\nuh doctors have told doctor specialists\nwho are trained in this field have\nstarted to you know give up and\nsort of give like end of life uh you\nknow i have to be told about like what a\ndnr is like a do not resuscitate order\ni don't know it's it's at the end stages\nand that's um\nit's a lot more common i guess than one\ncan expect you know people are going\nthrough it they just don't really like\nto talk about it\nvery similar to how i don't like to talk\nabout what my head is doing people don't\nlike to ever talk about their\nphysical ailments until you end up\ngetting to love them and you know\nthat comes out\nsorry i need a minute to process that i\nwas not expecting that one\nhow are you feeling when i say i need a\nmoment to process is it more of like oh\nmy god like i know i know i know you're\ni know it's definitely like you know a\nlot to deal with\nit's still a lot to deal with mentally\nin my head realizing somebody of my age\nis going through that\num especially somebody i still very\ndeeply care about but you know\ncan i ask you questions about\nno i i have no interest in in digging\ninto that person's privacy but\nright now i i can ask you about my side\nof the\nyeah yeah connection to that yeah yeah\nokay\num yeah can you tell me how old you were\nwhen you met this person\ni would say that i was 24\n24. so three years ago\nand that's uh can can you tell me a\nlittle bit about\nhow you it sounds like you fell in love\nyeah you know we sort of met we hung out\nfor a bit and\neventually we shared some common\ninterests\nuh you know she became much she became\nmy girlfriend\nthat's pretty much what it comes down to\nbut uh you know\naround that time she told me very much\nbefore we ever got together that she was\ngoing through all of this and all of you\nknow\nthese health issues and at the time it\nwasn't it wasn't as severe as it is now\nso i was always in my head like ah\nyou'll get\npositivity right i'm like you have the\nbest doctor care in the world you'll be\nfine\nand uh now it's also to a point where\nyou know the best doctors in the world\ncouldn't do it right god's calling her\nhome that kind of [ __ ]\nso yeah\nhow do you how do you feel right now\nsharing that\ni feel really [ __ ] sad that i'm about\nto lose someone as\nit's in my head there's nothing that i\nfeel like personally is happening to me\nlike you know i'm being\naffected mentally because of it because\nin my head i'm just realizing\nas much as it affects me right like you\nknow that's\ni would say inconsequential to the\nphysical health of this other person\nright\nyou know even if like it's hard to see\nsomebody in that situation you know what\ni mean like i don't want to see\nsomebody in that situation even wherever\ni care about and so i try to like\ndistance myself in a way as much as i\ncan\nyou know by burying myself in work or a\nhobby or something but then like\nyou know you can't completely do that\nyou can't completely ignore the world\naround you\nso i look at that\nand i guess i get really angry seeing\nthat that's happening to somebody i care\nabout somebody\na very young age you know in their\nmid-20s like me\nit's like what the [ __ ] you know like\ni guess i'm more angry than i am\nthinking about myself because i don't\nreally matter in the\nscheme of thing when it when i'm looking\nat you know somebody go through sailing\nthey're about to go die and you know\ni'm about to you know live on in the\nworld\nwhile losing somebody so what right do\nyou have to complain\nyeah right exactly like i'm sitting over\nhere\nand you know i'm not dying with a\nfunctioning heart\nyeah right like i'm not dead you know i\nget to i get to see tomorrow i get to\nsee\nour acts of god 2022 2023 and beyond\nyou know this person is at the end you\nknow\ni mean there was a period of my life\nwhere i actually thought i could have it\nlike i could have had like\nfamily something going forward right\nlike it could have worked past it could\nhave been everything\ni i had i had a i had a brief moment of\nlike\ni could have like you know really i\ncould settle down for once and then\nthings started messing up and we ended\nup growing apart\nyou know because of my work and\neverything\nthat was it you know do you do you talk\nto her\noh yeah here and there you know we have\nuh you know it's not like we\nstopped communicating fact i'm\none of the few people aside from her\nparents she'll communicate to about\nhealth issues right i guess i'm like an\nemergency contact\nso that tends to happen does she know\nhow much she means to you yeah\ni tell her that yeah i tell her that you\nknow at the end of the day i wish\nthings could have been different but uh\nyou know they're not\ndoes she get to see strong muda or weak\nmuda\ni don't think she's ever seen weak muta\nto be honest with you it's been we\nweren't\nlong enough together for her to ever see\nme like\ni think in a lot of ways when i saw her\nin the way that she was and i saw her\nphysical like\nyou know issues her terminal issues like\nyou know health problems i'd never ever\nwanted to show her\nmuta because i was like this [ __ ] on a\ndaily basis\nand she was already really strong you\nknow like dealing with all of her\nillnesses\nwhen you're putting a smile on your face\nafter the specialists have told you\nno i don't know if i could know you know\nwhat i mean i don't know if i\ni recently had appendicitis surgery\nright and i remember waking up in\nrecovery and the doctor like\nwas telling me we did your blood test uh\nyou're gonna have to stay another day\ni was losing in my mind i'm like die you\nknow what i mean like what is he saying\nright and i mean\nthat was like inconsequential compared\nto like this right like i was like\ni was i was in a recovery i was going to\ncome out just fine but then i look at\nher situation and it's like the doctors\nthe specialists are telling her okay we\nshould be discussing eol and all this\nnonsense only dude that would have\ncompletely broken me mentally i don't\nknow if i could have done it i think at\nthat point i would\nprefer that they stuck some cyanide in\nme and like ended it right there but i\nmean if you're still putting on a smile\nand you're still fighting through it and\n[ __ ] if you're still exercising day in\nand day out because of it\nyou're you're stronger man than i a\nstronger person than i you know\nso uh when it came to being with her\ni always had to put on like an extra\nsmile i guess so to speak like i had to\nbring out the extra smile just so that\nyou know since i knew this person was\nalready putting so much effort into\nkeeping sane themselves i didn't want to\nbring them down\nright like that's the last thing like\nwe're in a relationship i don't want to\nlike you know drag you down\nyou know if you're working so hard to be\nwhere you're at and also in a way\ndragging\ntoo\ni'm gonna need a minute i don't know\nthis is this is quite the curveball it's\nnot what i was expecting\nyeah well\nit's a it's an interesting it's an\ninteresting like point man because\nwhen we're talking about the loss of\nloved ones isil\nit all sort of ties back to that\nbeginning right like the loss of loved\nones\ni mean you're the psychologist but i\nknow there's never like a one track\nanswer to any of this\nthere's never like a one straight up\nsolid answer to how to deal with\nfor impending doom or any of this nature\nwhat makes it there isn't one solid\nanswer\nbecause because human beings aren't you\nknow computers right there's no like one\nprogram you can run and you get\na finite result at the end right like\nthe brain is different\num and again i'm not a psychologist but\ni like to think that human beings are\nmuch more complex than you\nwe let on so it's like when it comes to\ngrief everyone goes through it in a\ndifferent way\nwho knows that's where my mind is\nokay\nso there are a couple of different\ndirections i'm i'm honestly mood i'm\ngonna need your help\nand and i hope you're not getting this\nis like um\nyou know like you're so messed up that i\ncan't it it's really more about\nthat no i i know okay okay so so i it's\nreally just about choice because i think\nthere are a couple of uh\nthey're just a couple of really\nimportant conversations that we could\nhave\nfrom this point forward and and i i'm\nhaving trouble\nchoosing and i was hoping you could help\nme pick\nokay so one is you know we could talk\nmore about your\nfriend who it sounds like is terminally\nill\nwhich and and\nrelating to that there's just that\nwe could talk about that we can also\ntalk a little bit about and also\nrelating to that like\ni think there's a important conversation\nto be had about\nshowing weakness um\nand and i know it sounds kind of weird\nbut like\ni've worked with like terminal cancer\npatients uh\nmostly cancer and and sometimes you know\nthe family's trying to be like really\nreally strong for this person\nbut like actually what like\neveryone's just pretending to be part of\na play\nwhere like no one is being authentic and\nit really doesn't\nlike it can actually be like really\nwonderful to let\npeople who you care about know that life\nis hard for you to\nit can actually be like really really\nhealing to i know it sounds kind of\nweird but have the terminally ill person\ncomfort you\nlike it can mean a lot to them it can\nmean a lot to you\nlike and it's kind of weird but you kind\nof feel like they're the only ones that\nneed support whereas\ni i know you know for a lot of people if\nyou really think about love like what is\nsomeone you know you want to take care\nof her\nand presuming she feels the same way\nlike she wants to take care of you so in\na weird way one of the nicest things you\ncan do for her is to\nlet her take care of you\nso there's a there's a conversation\nthere if you want to talk more about\nthat that's fine i've also\nnoticed that um you know you're\ntalkative\nand and so i think we can just kind of\nmeander a little bit\num yeah we can meander and and you can\njust\ni'm happy to just listen because i think\nyou're saying a lot of\nimportant things that need to be said\nand\nthe third thing that that i was which is\nsort of what i was originally kind of\nhinting at when i\noffered this hypothetical but was just\nsort of trying to understand like where\ndoes making sure\ncome from like where does that complex\nin your mind\nif i were to call it something i'd call\nit the making sure monster\nbecause it's interesting because you say\nlike my brain won't let me which then\nbegs the question what is your brain and\nwhat are you\nbut i i think what we're really talking\nabout is like it's the making sure\nmonster right so if you sit down and you\ndo nothing for 15 minutes\nthe making sure monster will be like no\nno like you should be doing something\nthat way we can make sure\nthat something you know that this will\ngo well tomorrow\nso it's you know we can kind of\nleave it up to rng we can go down\ntalking about\nyou know loss of loved ones and and sort\nof what makes it hard for you to express\nvulnerability\nor we can talk about the origins of the\nmaking sure monster\ni feel like if i do the making sure\nmonster i'll be able to learn about\nmyself more\ni'd rather i want to deal with the\nmaking sure monster\ni feel like that's a mentality that's\ngoing to be the hardest thing i've ever\ndone in my life\nto get out of yep i i would agree i\nthink that's going to be the most useful\nso let me ask you something how long\nhave you been making sure\nfifteen sixteen okay\nyou sure it's not even before that\nwow you're really you're really getting\nme about elementary school all of a\nsudden\njesus you're getting me all the way back\nto the sixth grade with that\ni wouldn't say it was like as insane but\nyeah i guess i was making sure since\ntell me about the sixth grade\nsixth grade um we ended up moving for a\nbit like couple months\nand uh this is a time when i was moving\nback and forth from canada\nand the states and there's a period when\ni got into canadian school again\nthat they told me that i was going to\nfail the sixth grade because i guess\nthings were going to try\nmaybe i had to do a read and\ni remember my parents being there with\nthe teacher that day\nwe were having this long discussion and\nmy parents they weren't they weren't mad\nat me but i thought they were you know\nthey thought it was like stupid how the\nhell do you have to repeat the sixth\ngrade they never said it but in my head\nthat's the only thing that i could think\nof right\ni never asked them about that i never\nbothered to\nwhat am i going to ask my parents that\ni'm i'm a [ __ ]\nidiot so i didn't and it was at that\npoint i guess it's\ngreat that i had to make sure that i go\nto middle school right i go to the\nseventh grade i go one more up\nso i made sure by then\nand i guess it wasn't i i hate to say\nthat i was making sure\never since then because i don't think\nthe feeling is something that i\nrecognized until i was 15 and 16 when i\nstarted\nwhen i knew that i had the feeling but i\nguess if i\nsixth grade was that point\ni honestly i i hate to say it but i also\nvery much remember i don't remember a\nwhole lot of my\nlife at this before the sixth grade\nlike i know that sounds weird to say\nbecause people should have memories of\nit but\ni've lived such a blur at this point\nthat when i think you know like what was\ngrade five four\nthree two like i've forgotten like\nteacher names at the point like i've\nforgotten you know\nevery like i've forgotten you know the\nfinal tales and i've also forgotten\nwell i've forgotten the course details\nas well too i find that i can understand\nbut\ni should be able to remember a chunk of\nit were you worried about needing to\nrepeat a grade like did you have any\ninkling before that conversation\nwith that teacher and your parents that\nthings could have gone wrong\num yeah i know when the teacher told me\nright like my parents\nand i had that but uh did i have any\nlike i think i was too young to\nunderstand the idea of when i had\nso i didn't know about that\noh sorry your voice clipped out there\nfor a second oh\nuh yeah but i don't think that i i like\nwhen my teacher told me that i had to do\nit when my parents had to come in that's\nwhen i knew i don't think i had a\nrealistic understanding of what it meant\nlike to repeat the grades\nno no can you just tell me as much like\ndo you mind just telling me like a brief\nstory about\nthe sequence of events and like what you\nremember like\ni'd love to hear a little bit so what\nare\nlike how it happened so for us when we\nstarted this\nwhen we started school again right in\nlike september and everything\num things were fine uh probably up until\nnovember is when we had to like move to\nthe states and everything so we ended up\nswitching schools out into the states uh\nthis is around michigan\nso we ended up going to michigan in the\nsixth grade for me\ni went to school there for a little bit\num until\nfebruary or whatever like this was you\nknow we immediately\nuh and then around february\nmy dad you know had to move back to\ncanada for his job and everything right\nand\ninitially i remember at the time that my\ndad was moving back and forth like he\nwas coming back and forth from the\nstates and canada all the time\nso eventually you know in that sixth\ngrade right like when i'm telling you\nlike november we moved with my dad\nbecause we wanted you know i guess my\nmom and dad wanted us to be sort of like\na family rather than my dad going out\nand\nhearing that when i came back you know\nin february to school\ni i guess the system was so different\nthat i may have had to repeat the sixth\ngrade because i was missing like a chunk\nof the curriculum\num so around the time of you know\nfebruary when like this\ncame up right like and at this point\nmarch had started to roll in and this\nwas a week before march break\nso like my teacher you know they brought\nin my parents they talked about what i'm\nmissing out of the curriculum so i\nremember i had to read like two books\ni had to do like a big like project a\nbig project you know\nsixth grade project like something you\ndo over the weekend like put stuff on\ncardboard paper or whatever i had to do\na bunch of these reports or whatever\nbasically i had to do the entire\ncurriculum\nof six months school you know and i did\nit all in march break like i\ni i asked my teacher i'm like can i just\nhave all of what i missed\nand can i just do it for you so i\nremember i spent that entire march break\ni didn't go outside and play or do\nanything i literally\ndid a curriculum work right in march i\nread literally like two books and back\nthen\nyou're in the sixth grade right like a a\nbook is like a book is like a commitment\nyou know yeah now it's like now it's\nlike nightly reading\nso i'm doing this entire like do these\ntwo book reports and i ended up getting\nit done in like two\nthree weeks and it wasn't until the\nend of that entire year now my teacher\nwas like no you'll be fine you're\nyou're going to the seventh grade like i\nremember the day came\nwhere we all went into a room the entire\nsixth grade class\nso it's like we were split right they\nstarted to give us sort of this middle\nschool um\norientation where they split us up into\ndifferent classrooms they gave us like\nlockers so they made us feel like we're\nin middle school kind of going into high\nschool\nand the last day of school they brought\nus into the room it's like\ncongratulations\nyou all graduated that was the most\nrelaxing thing that i've ever heard in\nmy life because i knew\ni knew when i knew in my head she was\ntalking to me you know\ni knew in my head she had to she the\nonly reason she said that\nis so that you could finally say okay\ni'm getting through school i'm\ngraduating finally i'm not a total idiot\nlike\nyou know so so when they were like\nassigning lockers and stuff did you\nthink that like\nthat stuff may not apply to you like it\napplied to all of your clients\ni mean for the longest time i was like i\nwas like what's the point of me doing\nthis i'm gonna have to repeat sixth\ngrade again so until the last day came\nlike you all graduated\nand they gave us like our report cards\nand like those brown envelopes and [ __ ]\ni was like oh my god i succeeded i\ni honestly to this day i've never even\nasked anybody else if a teacher has said\nthat to him right like in the sixth\ngrade like it feels so foreign to me\nis it normal for a sixth grade teacher\nto tell the entire class you all\ngraduated\nit's elementary school but i mean for me\na kid who's on like that verge of\nfailure\ni guess from what i know congrats i\nsucceeded\nand then i go into the seventh and\neighth grade and i wouldn't say that i\nfeel\nthis this uh moment of like um\ni i guess i guess i'm not a feeling of\nlike making sure in the seventh or\neighth grade\nbut even when you go into the seventh\ngrade they're telling you all right\nyou're going to need this and this if\nyou want to go to high school because we\nhad like high schools we could apply to\nback then like those\nlike uh i remember kathra uh the greater\ntoronto area was like this artsy sort of\nlike\ncollege that people could apply to\ngordon grayson was like a business\nschool that you could apply to um we\nwere talking about high school\napplications back then bro\n[ __ ] insanity if i'm gonna be honest\nwith you but\nyeah that's what uh that's what we had\nto that's what i was doing\nback in the day it felt it dude i feel\nlike it was i grew up in like\nindia abroad you know because it's like\nyou know you hear all the stories of\nlike people back in india it's like\nyou need a 99 gpa to get into the best\nindian universities imagine well i'm\nlike [ __ ] man\nno one's getting that\nit's kind of crazy right because i what\ni'm really hearing is like\nwhen before your your march break you\nkind of have a sit down with your\nparents\nand and your parents what what are they\nwhat did they say like i\ndo you remember i remember like my mom\nwas the one that was trying to like you\nknow rationalize she's like you gotta go\nto\nwe're gonna talk to your teacher she's\ngoing to give us all the schoolwork and\nyou're going to get it done you know\nyou're going to have you're going to\nmake sure that it's it's done right like\nthat's what you can do\nmy dad didn't really say anything to me\nlike i don't remember anything my mom\nwas the only one that walked me through\nit because she's like\nshe is kind of like me she knows how to\nyou know break things down\nflowchart your way through so that's\npretty much what my mom got me through\nmy dad didn't\nsay anything i asked him later on you\nknow\nafter you know my teacher was like\neveryone graduated i'm like were you\nguys ever mad at me my dad was like\nno he understood everything\nbut uh it was it's also dude it's also\nweird from a social perspective too\nbecause when you're in the sixth grade\nand you know your entire\ngrade because i grew up with some of\nthese people they're going a year ahead\nof you\nand now you're getting like last year's\nkids coming up to you\nyeah and everyone knows you're there\nlike makes you feel even dumber than you\nusually are [ __ ]\nyeah no i think it's quite humiliating\ni'm wondering what is\nwhat are you imagining also yeah yeah go\nahead and go ahead no i was just saying\nlike it's also kind of weird like\ni've carried that mentality in in\ncollege too because uh there was a\nperiod where i did some continuing\neducation\nand like it only became normal for me\nwhen i ended up going\neducation i was like oh wow there's\npeople that are like 50 coming with me\nokay\nlike my classmates are you know varying\nages people my i was me and my buddy\nwere like\none of my closest friends now as we're\none of the youngest people in our\ncontinuing education courses because we\nwere doing like after effects\nuh continuing education and like all of\nour peers were like 40 45 so we're like\noh\nokay it's normal yeah cool\n[Music]\nsorry i get too chatty about it when you\nwant me to describe something i will\ndescribe it\nno i think it's wonderful i think it so\ni'm going to ask you kind of a weird\nquestion\nokay there's there's going to be a weird\nquestion maybe weird emotions will come\nup\nwhat do you imagine your dad was feeling\nduring that meeting\nthink he took it on himself because i\nthink he i think he came to the\nrealization that him moving around a lot\ncost us i think he even realized that\nwhen\num i i think to an extent the\nconversation he had where he told me\nlike\nhow do you know if you're going to be\nalive so many so years\ncame up you know i think he has to know\nlike my dad's my dad's a smart guy he\nknows\nthat he cost you know family that and i\nfeel terrible saying that because i feel\nlike i'm calling my dad a terrible\nperson for that [ __ ] but it's not\nso the truth like we ended up fine you\nknow but i think my dad realized that\nhis actions\nmay have caused difficulty for me\ngrowing up and even my brother like i\nhaven't\ni've never talked brother about his\nschool he turned out just fine now\nbut i've never had that discussion too\nso i feel like to an extent\nmy dad has to know he probably has that\nin his head\nso what dad doesn't realize yeah so what\nwhat do you\nwhat do you think about that how does\nthat how does it feel\nthat makes me feel worse though if i'm\nmaking my dad go through that yeah\nbecause like i feel like if my dad\nthinks that way i'm like then i feel\nlike wow i guess i caught\nit [ __ ] in a way and it's like it\ndoesn't even make any logical sense but\nthat's what my brain is doing too\nyeah right so and and so\nif you're strong for your dad\nwhat does that do for him\ni feel like that relaxes him in my head\nlike for me i look at my dad i'm like\nokay you're getting old now so\ni'm your oldest son so i gotta you know\nstep up and make sure that\nthe rest of your retirement days are\nsolid and relaxed you know like that's\nwhat i'm so\nto me my parents are the most important\nthing yep i\ni i do i go to bed like every once in a\nwhile and i think of a day when they\neventually have to pass and everything\nand i don't know how i like that's\nuncopable in my head because i'm like\nclosest people i've ever had and it's\nlike regardless of what has happened\ni don't know what i'll ever do you know\nyeah so\nyou know how okay we're gonna really go\ni'm gonna go\nhunting now okay so i'm gonna ask you a\nlot of specific and arguably leading\nquestions\nokay let me know if it starts to feel\nweird so\nyou said that you know you you said\nseveral times actually during this\nconversation\nthat you would have never let your dad\nknow that him moving around was hard on\nyou\nyeah i don't think i would want to no\nright so let's think a little bit about\nwhy not because i feel like he'd blame\nhimself\nokay yeah and slamming himself yeah no\nwouldn't be good\nfor me when you say wouldn't be good for\nyou how would you\nfeel if your dad blamed himself yeah\ni feel like i'm causing my dad some\nlevel of grief when i could have just\nkept it to myself and maybe\nin blissful ignorance life would have\nmoved on and\nall this would have been a memory\nokay so i know it sounds kind of weird\nand now i'm gonna\nlook for a particular answer so when you\ndon't tell your dad about what your\nexperience is when you don't open up to\nhim\nwhat are you doing\ni'm lying to you you're sure you're\nlying so the word i was looking for is\nprotect\nyeah what do you think about that\ni want to say protect but literally we\njust had a conversation\nnot five minutes ago where i know that\nin his you know what he's done\nmoving around and everything so it's\nlike what am i protecting him from the\nfact that\nexcellent am i protecting him from like\nhim i know\nthe reality of this okay i feel like in\nsome ways when i lie to him\ni'm feeling like an idiot because he\nknows what like he's not\nso yeah some days what am i even doing\nokay let's just go on with it yep so so\nthis is where it was adaptive at one\npoint it's not stupid it's just\nmaladapted because i think this is like\nliterally that this this is a pattern i\nsee a lot where like\nwhen sometimes our parents in a sense do\nthe best that they could right like your\ndad did the best he could\noh absolutely and and you love him and\nrespect him for all the sacrifices he\nmade and it\ncan't have been easy like for him to\nhave to move you know every six months\nto like\nmichigan canada was rough right yeah\nand and who bore the brunt of the\nsituation that\nhe was in\ni mean i i don't know what his work life\nwas ever like\nyou know i don't know what he was doing\nin the professional career\nyou know what i mean like i was too\nyoung and i never asked i i don't know\ndealing what but i knew at the time like\nmy mom was dealing with you know\nbecause at one point dude it felt like\nshe was a single mom for a while you\nknow what i mean like\nliterally when you see your dad like one\nweekend out of the month\nyou know you're way closer to your mom\nfelt like she was super alone\nme and my brother were just on my own\ntoo\nyou know like we were just doing our\nlife the way that we did it we never had\nlike\nsay family normality and\nhave like i guess everyone around me i\nmust\nbe with their mom and dad i was just\nalways with my mom and\neven then i was always doing schoolwork\nor\nyou know all that [ __ ]\neven the time when like i moved around\nand we lit my dad dr\nwork in that period\nit's like how do you how do you like how\ndo you just make everything\nyou're cutting out sorry sorry oh i'm\nsorry i don't i think it might be\nbut it's like how do you move in like\nhow do you move\ntogether as a family right and then make\nit normal in a day\nright like how do you act like of how do\nyou like\nparticipate in family activity after\nlike like\nwhen we moved in november together and\nwe started living\nit's like okay what's going on\nright like i guess we're together now\nlet's\nwe'll be yeah it's like it feels pretty\nartificial\nthe event honestly it still feels\nartificial to this day even like\neven going all the way up to now like\njust\ni would say in a matter of like a few\nyears ago i started becoming closer to\nmy family because there was a point\nwhere like\ni left like college you know like i left\nand went into the world and lived my\nlife and now i'm more\nparticipant in my family at least direct\nfamily um\nnow like years ago but it's like how do\nyou how do you how do you get back to\nnormal\nlike how do you make something that you\nknow isn't normal like\nwe're we're gonna help you with that\nyeah okay\nso why do things in a family feel\nartificial\nwhy because they are artificial\nokay right simple\nyeah and and so i know it sounds kind of\nweird but like muda what i get the sense\nof is that like there's a lot\nhanging between you and your dad\nand so like sometimes like like there's\na lot behind\nwhat he told you like you know he's like\nyou don't even know if you're gonna be\nalive when you're 40 right like\nthat i'm sure that it's important for\nhim to say it sounds like it's a really\nimportant conversation\nbut do you get how like that's the\noutput and there's a lot of like\nnumber crunching behind what he says\nlike does that make sense\nthere was a lot more to his answer to me\nthat he was thinking that i just never\npicked up on you yeah right so like\nlike your dad doesn't just show up to\nyou and he's like\nhey where'd you have for lunch today\ncool yeah\nare you gonna be alive when you're 40\nlike what that's not\nright so he's like thinking about\nsomething\nprocessing observing something within\nyou\nand then decides to like give you this\nparticular package\nyeah right so like he's been thinking\nabout this so like i think that what\ni think the reason that there's some\namount of like artificiality\nis because you guys are both\nignoring the same damn thing\nand so like like you know and you guys\nhave learned how to do this for a while\nbecause you all have been doing it now\nfor like what sounds like\nyou know a decade or two yeah where you\nall have learned\nyou all have learned like not like\nbecause like because it's interesting\nright so you're you're\nyou watch game of thrones or have you\nread the book i\nhave watched maybe episode one of game\nof thrones i've never been into that\nyeah anyway so so like you know if there\nwas a house of muda\nthe words would be so each house\nhas words right so your house words are\nbetter dead than weak those are the\nwords of house\nthe slogan on the slogan on the house\nyeah the slogan on the house exactly\nlike when you\nwalk in like that's what better dead\nthan weak and it's interesting right\nbecause like when i hear that sixth\ngrade story like i\ni totally get why your mind jumps there\nbecause\nyou know you had a choice like you can\nbe like oh [ __ ]\ncan i do six months worth of work in two\nweeks\ni would rather be dead\nyeah right so like well i mean i don't\nwanna i don't wanna fail yeah\nyeah right so like like i'm not gonna be\nleft behind like if i have to sacrifice\ntwo weeks of my life\ni'm doing book reports i'm i'm gluing\nstationary stuff together i'm gonna i'm\nworking in a i'm in a sweatshop of my\nown for two weeks yeah\nabsolutely and it's a sweatshop that\nyou've been in\nsince the sixth grade it's the boxing\nring\nthat we're round after round and never\naround\nthere's no there's no like it's not even\nlike the round over chills out you know\ni mean it's like you sound like you have\na\n10 second break to drink water no you\njust keep going with the blood\nit's it's the sweatshop of your own\nmaking and i think it's like i\nbecause i i think back in the sixth\ngrade i realize i'm bouncing around a\nlot right because i'm just gonna start\nspitballing here but like i think you\nkind of learned a really important\nlesson back then\nwhich is that you know it's it's really\ninteresting because it's that there's\ncircumstances outside of your control\nand that your life can be screwed by\nthings that are like\ncompletely like outside of there's\nalmost like a healthy amount of paranoia\nwhich i can imagine\ngets set in the mind at that point like\nyou just can't count on like you never\nknow\nwhen your teacher is gonna call a\nconference\nlike you never know and then\nif you work really really hard\nthen you can like there's a way forward\nand the only thing you have to sacrifice\nis yourself and so like\nthere's there's a lot there in that\nstory about like\nyou know sort of being put into bad\nsituations because of other people\nsort of not being able to rely on others\nlike\nyou know like your dad's sort of like\nnot really owning up to\nyou know like why you're in that\nsituation in the first place like not to\nsay that you shouldn't have done the\nwork or things like that and\nit's not even to say that like he really\nhad much of a choice because you know\nsometimes you just got to follow where\nthe work is\nyeah but i think that's where like a\nreally healthy conversation at that\npoint\nreally could have been hey son i'm sorry\nyou're in this situation\nwe have to do this because of work i\nlove you a lot\ni you know i know you can do the work\nlike i'm sorry to put you into this\nsituation\num but this is just the way that it has\nto be right now\nlike what are you feeling as i say those\nthings\ni've never heard that out of his mouth\nactually\ni wish i wish well i mean i've heard\nhalf of that\ni never really uh\nyeah that uh that\ngod that perfectly exemplifies what you\nknow the whole situation was like\ni know that he had to do his [ __ ] but\ngod some days i wish you wouldn't\nyeah some days i kind of wish he\ni kind of wish our family was god you\nknow i i t\ni take living in absolute abject shitty\nconditions\nif it meant my family was more together\nbut\nmaybe that maybe that's why i keep\nthinking you know in some ways if i ever\nget to be a dad\nif like if that day ever comes\ni don't want to have to be the one\nmoving around i don't want to have to\ni want to be able to you know have\neverything\nin the most perfect way that i can even\nif that means\nkilling part of myself to achieve it you\nknow what i mean\nsure what i'm hearing from you is you\nwant to make sure\nthat your children never have to go\nthrough what you went through\nabsolutely and muda is well worth\nsacrificing\nfor that yeah\n100 i\nuh you you 100\nhit my mindset right there and you know\nthe thing is\ni in a way i've i've even told myself\ni'm like there's got to be something\nwrong to\nnever i've never sat down and did the\noriginal you know like\nyou know how you know you do like the uh\nthe good and bad you know sort of tea\ntable\ni've never done that i've never come\nacross with bad i've always realized\nit's always good for the people around\nyou it's always good if you have kids\nfor their\nbenefit growing up it doesn't really\nmatter tough through it\nyou've already done it so far what's\nanother few decades\nright sure you know\nso now we get to a really important\nquestion right so\na little while ago i asked you do you\nwant this to change\nand you said you remember what you said\nabout the what's going on so so\nyou were like yeah i think we're\nprobably rapping we're probably hitting\nthe limit because i think you've done a\nlot of good work today\ni'd love to tie it up for you a little\nbit more but i think you should just\nprocess this so i'm going to try to\nsummarize okay\nand give us at least a stopping point\ni'll make a couple recommendations\nfirst is like when we talk about\nbetter dead than weak gotta make sure\nand you were like yeah this is the thing\nthat has been like running my life and i\nwant it to change\nbut now after we talk about it do you\nwant it to change\ni don't think so no good right so now we\nunderstand\nbecause what is the and don't worry\nwe'll flip-flop you back and forth a\ncouple times okay\nso like because what would be the cost\nof you changing\neveryone around me right\nso and and what we're thinking about is\nlike if you changed if you started to\nbecome more indulgent like\nyou could be subject to the whims of the\nworld\nright like this goes back to control\nlike you're not gonna give up the\n[ __ ] control\nthat your dad did not have like you are\ngonna move mountains to make sure\nthat like you're gonna make sure right\nbecause it's like you're not gonna be in\nthat situation\nwhere you have to do something that\ncould potentially hurt your kids\nyeah [ __ ] that never\nand so then the next question that i\nhave for you\nis what do you think your kids will do\nwhen they grow up if you do that\nif i do what i'm doing right now what\nare you gonna learn and what are you\ngonna teach them\ni mean if i if i had a kid i feel like i\ncould honestly\ni feel like i pass on the same [ __ ] yep\ni feel like i feel like i tell them like\nhonestly if i had a kid i would tell\nthem\nlife for people like for for you and me\nand\nour entire like everyone around us\nyou've only got yourself\nlike i'm here like if i have my kid i\ntell them listen i'm here\nin the ground after me you've got no one\nelse but yourself\nno one else that you can rely on you\nbetter learn to [ __ ]\ndig your heels in the ground and make\nsomething worthwhile or\ndie like the rest of okay\nlike yeah i\nthink that's what your dad taught you\nright\nbecause he's like you got to do like is\nyour dad\nweak no\nno i don't know no he's worked hard yeah\nyeah right\nlike so he taught you that lesson too he\nwas like if you have to commute to\nmichigan\nevery single weekend that's what you do\nto provide for your family i\ni look at my dad like this you know he\nwent to medical school twice\none in india one over here could get\nyour medical\nlicense in one part of the world you\ndon't get it carried over here so\nyeah when i look at my dad and i look at\nall he had to do like imagine\nacross the world at age 35\nyou're young but you know you're hitting\nthat middle age pretty [ __ ] quickly\nyou got a wife you got a kid you got\nanother kid on the way\n[ __ ] you know you can either my dad\nworked his\nass off when i was you know there were\ndays where\nwhen we moved into the gta we lived in\nan apartment in east toronto\nand i got to see my dad once out of the\nweek\nokay because back then to pay for\nmedical school again\nhe would have to pour it right so he\nwould drive from toronto all the way to\nmy\n[ __ ] insane drive back and forth day\nto day to day to day to day-to-day\nand i i mean at one point the man\n[ __ ] kills himself right like you\nhave no personality of nothing\nyou gotta do gotta do to money\nto pay off these mounting debts he\ntaught and eventually\nyeah yeah i'm gonna interrupt and\nhe taught you this lesson which you were\ngoing to pass on to your children right\nyeah and what is he trying to teach you\nnow\ni feel like he's trying to teach me that\ni have to i have to keep my [ __ ]\ntogether\ni have to stand on my own two feet\nbecause there's not going to be anybody\nelse out there that's going to do it for\nme\ni also feel like you can't rely on\nanyone so i i think if you pay attention\nto his last conversation right when he\ncomes to you and he says you don't know\nif you're going to be alive when you're\n40.\n[Music]\ni think he's trying in his own way to\ntell you that like\nyou know i'm not so sure\nright like that sounds yeah because he's\nlived it yeah because right\nhe's saying like he's actually saying\nlike don't be like me\ndude i just feel like man after all this\n[ __ ] i feel like the only\nnormal generation after\nlike as far as i feel like after like\nthis entire situation the only like\nnormal generation that i'll have a\nchance to make their\nown decisions and will have a chance of\nnormality in this part of the world\nis the next generation after me i feel\nlike i'm already going\nalready going blow-by-blow you know\nyeah to live that normal life that's\nwhat i'm only worried about right\nbecause i've already been past it my\nchildhood's gone you know i'm an adult\nso i got to make sure it doesn't repeat\nitself\nyeah so there's more there right\nthere's a lot to talk about there which\nis like i'm sorry if my mic keeps\ncutting out by the way\num i just like i keep looking at the uh\ndiscord light\nso i don't know let me just yeah is it\nbetter now\nit look yeah it seems better yeah but um\ni think sometimes it's when you move\naround but so here's here's what i'd say\nmurder like\ni know we've been at it for a little\nwhile i think we've covered some good\nstuff\num you know the next generation things\nlike that i i don't think your\ngeneration is lost yet i also don't\nthink you're lost and i think you can\nreclaim some of your childhood as well\nbut i want to leave you with a couple\nthings to think about okay\nright first is i think you got to talk\nto your dad\ni think you got to have a lot of\nconversations with him oh\nyeah we do right so that that is\nthat you say that but man in my head\nthat's like the hardest thing to ever\nachieve man to sit down with my dad and\nhave this discussion\nholy [ __ ] dude i would rather architect\nlike entire server farms for a company\nand get over this jesus christ that's\ntoo much you know\nyeah so the the good news is that you\nknow if you want to he can just watch\nthis\nalthough i imagine you'll be terrified\nof him watching\nbecause yeah because it's going to be\nhard to protect him if he listens to you\nright\nabsolutely if he actually hears what you\nhave to say like you see that you\nwant to protect him you don't ever want\nhim to watch this and the reason you\ndon't want him to watch this is because\nhe may feel bad\noh absolutely yeah right so so you got\nto be careful because i think i think in\norder for you and your dad to like\nreally connect in the way that like\nsounds important to me it's important to\nme i you have to [ __ ] decide if it's\nimportant to you but\nyou know i think it's about talking a\nlittle bit about you know like because\nthere's i think there's a really healthy\nway to have the conversation which is\nsort of\nyou know you love him you respect him\nyou completely understand the sacrifices\nhe made he did the best that he could it\nwas really hard\nand it also kind of sucked for you\nand if he's if his narcissistic defense\nmechanisms are\nare up he'll get mad at you and he'll\nsay\nyou are grateful little blah blah blah\nblah\nright but but i think that the reason\nthat those\nnarcissistic defense mechanisms arise is\nbecause\nthey arise to protect himself from his\nown guilt\nright and and so i think that like not\nyou don't have to blame him i i think\nyou can just\nbut but i think like it's it's i don't\nlike i don't blame my dad or anything of\nthat nature you know like at the end of\nthe day like i know\ni i'm completely understanding of what\nhe's done you know like yeah\nso it's not like my dad ruined my\nchildhood right of course\nyeah so so i and i think if you want an\neasy way\nokay so i'm gonna try to protect your\nbrain\nso like an easy way to enter into a\nconversation with your dad is is that\nyou just revisit this conversation about\nlike are you going to be alive when\nyou're 40.\nyou just ask your dad questions like hey\ndad like last week or a month ago or a\nyear ago or whenever he had it you\nremember you told me this thing\ni was hoping to understand that you\ndon't have to talk about feelings\nyou don't have to talk about the past\nyou don't have to demonstrate weakness\nhe doesn't have to demonstrate weakness\nand then i would ask him so that's the\nfirst question you feel okay asking that\nquestion\nyeah i can actually okay if it's like\npurely non you know like no\nconfrontation nothing edges no\nyep yep easy easy questions okay we're\ngonna go nice and smooth so then the\nnext question is like\ncan you tell me a little bit about like\nwhat you know when you\nwhen i was your age like what was going\nthrough your head about your life\nand ask him like you know what it what\ndo you see like how do you see me living\nmy life what do you think about the way\ni'm living my life what do you think i\nyou know because he's\nsaying that to you for a reason and how\ndid you live your life back then how did\nyou live your life in your 30s what was\nit like to have to go through\nlike residency again or medical school\nagain yeah\nyou know and just ask him questions\nabout like his his upbringing and stuff\nlike that\nand and then you know that's gonna be\nsafe\nand then you know if you ever\nare able to or he may go there\num you can also have a conversation\nabout you know what it was like growing\nup and like\njust try to understand his perspective\nand and i think the closer you you the\nthe more he starts talking about\nyou growing up the closer y'all are\ngonna get to emotions\nand you have to decide whether you're\ncomfortable\ntalking about that does that make sense\nyeah i know it\nshould lead the conversation into where\nhe was at my point in life and see what\nyou know similarities\nand and you guys may have the ability to\njust communicate with each other\nwithout ever saying anything but i think\nboth of y'all need to know\nthat like like there's something needs\nto happen between y'all\nyeah no i i think i think it's to me\ni feel like the way that i want this\nconversation to go is i want to like\nreally talk about the commonalities we\nhad because i know he's been\nhe's worked hard around my age too so i\nwant to see like\nyep why like i mean when you're talking\nabout this whole cycle repeating itself\nlike this\nmaybe it has repeated itself more\nliterally than i'm thinking right now\nmaybe maybe the parallels are just more\nthere than it ever was you know\nyep yep and then i would i would also\nshare with him this may be actually\nsafer because in the context of that\nconversation\nyou can even tell him sometimes\nwhen i sit down and i like try to take a\nbreak my mind tells me i should be doing\nmore work\nwhat do you think about that just ask\nhim about that\noh i feel i feel like we'll come across\nsome real commonality because i know my\ndad he's definitely one of those\nanxious people too yeah yeah he can't\ntake a break either\nyeah and so i'd say start there and i\nthink more\nlong term\nthis is going to be harder but it's\ndefinitely doable it's going to take\nsome work\ni think you have to learn how to like\nnot be so sure about stuff\nright like i think you've got to learn\nhow to like let go a little bit\nand and sort of know that you can do the\nmost that you can do\nand you can do the best that you can do\nbut that like\n[Music]\nyou know that trust trust not\nin your ability to make things perfect\ntrust in your ability for damage control\nso basically flowchart less is my life\nright\ninstead of thing instead of waking up\nevery day thinking of every possible\naction instead of making like\nyou know every like because because in\nmy head i think of every find it like if\ni do this\nit could you know lead to this or that\nor this or that maybe instead of you\nknow making six or seventy\ndifferent little boxes have it all one\nbox as a\nthis could happen and i'm going to have\nto learn to adapt to it regardless of\nhow it happens\nyeah sort of so i wouldn't quite say\nflowchart less but what i'd say is what\nyou need to learn how to do is tolerate\nuncertainty because i think it's the\nuncertainty that terrifies you and it's\nit's a lot of you trying because like\nmuda what you are is a control freak\nbecause\nuncertainty you've learned that that\nuncertainty is like\njust way too painful and and over time i\nthink what you\nneed to really do otherwise you really\nare going to pass this on to your kids\nwhich i'm sure that you'll\ni mean i'm not sure but i imagine you'll\nhave one day\num and i just think it's karmic it's\njust\ntwo too too much karma\nin your life to not have children um\nbut like like i i think it's it you got\nto be a little bit careful because you\nhave to understand that like some of\nsome of your aversion to uncertainty i\nthink has come out of experiences\nthat are like like because you learned\nearly on that [ __ ] is out of your\ncontrol\nso like if you double down i mean that\nsixth grade story is perfect because\nit's like\nrandom thing happens to you that could\nscrew over your life\nyeah and all you have to do is sacrifice\nyourself get into the ring\nand then you can alter the course of\nfate\nand so that lesson is what you've\nhas become a part of your fabric you can\ncost yourself\nand you you don't have to like bring\nother people in it just takes you to win\nyou know that's\nexactly yeah and and so i think as you\nkind of work on that it's going to\nbecome\nimportant for romantic relationships and\nstuff like that but i'd say start with\nyour dad and you know\nthere's more conversations i don't know\nif you've ever worked with a therapist\nbut i think this is definitely the kind\nof stuff you can work with a therapist\ni've never worked with a therapist\nactually i've always\nagain like it goes back to what you said\nbefore i like do i feel weak when i open\nmyself up i don't think i could\nit's hard for me to like go sit in front\nof anybody even if it's like so\npersonally detached from me like a\ntherapist who you know\ni pay this person we sit down we talk\nthey professionally you know\nrespond to me it's still so difficult to\nlet them into your head you know\nhow has this been difficult oh it's been\nincredible\nwell this whole thing hasn't been\ndifficult like i've been able to ease in\nwith you it's kind of like you know\nbuddy talking but\nit's just um i feel like i feel like if\nthis is\nthis is professional i don't want to say\nthat what we're doing isn't it's you\nknow it's not professional but\nif this was a real professional setting\nlike if i was sitting with you right now\nand like\nin like an office like laying down on\none of those you know like\nyou know therapist beds or whatever i\ndon't think i could do it man i think i\nprobably i would walk out i'd be like\nyou know what man\nnot for me i get up in 10 minutes i'll\nbe like bye\nso so what what about doing this\nin front of thousands of strangers on\nthe internet\nmakes it easier for you than doing it\nalone in the privacy of a therapist oh\nit's uh it's streaming i'll be real with\nyou when i first started streaming in\nfront of like a couple hundred people it\nused to be a little anxiety inducing\nuh you just get that that i will say you\njust get used to after a while it\nbecomes like a number you look at like\nwhatever okay it's just\nit's someone on like the other side of\nthe world cool it's not\nit's it's it's also just i don't know i\njust i've\ni've gotten used to seeing those number\ncounts like it's it is what it is\nokay how i know is me and you are\ntalking you know yeah so\ni know it sounds weird but that's the\nstrange thing that i've discovered is\nthat like actually a lot of people feel\nthe same way you do\nand that like almost doing it in the\nprivacy of a therapist's office\nwhich you know you're right that this\nisn't we're more you know we're both\nlike we're streaming here we're more\nlike content creator colleagues just\nhaving a conversation but\nthere is something strange about you\nknow this being more accessible\neven though in theory it should be like\nway harder to do i don't understand it\nmyself\nbut i totally get what i'm saying like i\nfeel like i'm just talking to\na dude we're just chilling yeah you know\nthere's it's like in a way it's i think\nit's like being there and you know why\nyou're there like you understood like\nwhen we started this conversation we\ndidn't exactly have like\na plan set or what we were going to\nattack or whatever right\nyou know we didn't like jump down into\nthis like this is what we're gonna cut\nlike it just sort of led into one\nanother and it is\nit is what it is you know has it been\ntougher at times during the conversation\nyeah\nhas it been easier yeah but you know\nit's a conversation i could go with it's\nagain i don't want to say it's not\nprofessional but it's like you said it's\njust two dudes talking like\nyeah yeah yeah no i i think it's it's i\nmean this is not\ntherapy or medical advice so you know\nthere's a legal disclaimer of that which\nyeah but but i mean i think there's also\nsomething different i think this is\nwhere a lot of people get\nconfused because they sort of say like\nbecause actually you know\nto just be just to be perfectly honest i\nwould be saying and doing different\nthings if the two of us were in our\noffice and i was your doctor\ni would actually be doing things quite\ndifferently but um\nuh but then the last thought is just you\nknow if you're interested\nthen i mean i would actually recommend a\ntherapist in your case but\num you know if that doesn't feel\ncomfortable to you\nwe do actually have a coaching program\nfor content creators\nwhich they seem to you know so far the\ncontent creators seem to be happy we can\nsend you some info if you're interested\nbut\ni'd be interested in that yeah yeah so\nit it's\nsome stuff around work-life balance and\nand things like that but\nany questions for me muta before we wrap\nup i know we've been at it for a while\nyou've been doing a fantastic job by the\nway\nit's hard i know i i i i\nhonestly i feel like you're giving me\nthe road map to have a discussion with\nmy dad\nat some point so when this lockdown is a\nlittle more eased up i think i'll take\nhim out to dinner just me and him\nsomewhere and we'll have this\nconversation\num that's that's the only thing i'm\nlooking like really\nforward to actually now like i'm not so\nmuch scared of doing that\nuh i want to you know it's just\nsomething that i feel like needs to\nhappen i feel like it needs to be\ndiscussed either do it now\nor yeah or you let it screw up another\nyou know section of your life\nyeah but yeah that's that's where i want\nto go to now that's like the next\nbig point yeah well muda thank you so\nmuch for coming on man\nand and i hope the conversation goes\nwell you know\nand we'll do i'll let you know yeah\nyeah um and you know if any other\nquestions or anything like that pop up\njust let us know we're happy to try to\nsupport you love the work that you do\ncan you just tell us before we kind of\ntap out um where we can
