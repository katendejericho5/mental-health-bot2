    "transcript": "[Music]\n[Music]\nforeign\nnext one okay so i have pedophilic\nthoughts i fight against them every day\nplease advise okay so once again\ndisclaimer andy\nall right so like a reminder that you\nknow what we're doing is commenting on\ngeneral\nmental health information as opposed to\num you know offering detailed advice\nso uh we're gonna just\nyou know this is also like is this tos\nconcerning okay let's just let we won't\nread the whole post\nbut i just want to acknowledge um you\nknow that that this is there and we're\ngoing to talk a little bit about this\nokay so\num so that this is where like the first\nthing that i want you all to understand\nis like\nwhen we think about who we are what is\nyour mind\nso the mind is a thought-generating\nmachine\nright and this is interesting because\nlike what i would describe this person\nas having maybe they have\npedophilic thoughts but let's call them\nintrusive thoughts\nright so i'm going to sort of generalize\nthis a little bit so sometimes our mind\ngenerates thoughts that like we don't\nlike\nand so if we stop and think about them\nthen what happens is we feel like\nmorally deficient for our mind\ngenerating\nparticular thoughts whereas it like in\nmy personal view and when i work with\npeople who have intrusive thoughts that\nare\nego dystonic and we'll get to that what\nthat means in a second which means that\nthe thoughts that they don't like\ni don't consider that person to be\nmorally deficient in fact\nwhat i i actually consider that person\nto be like like i respect them morally\nbecause\nthey recognize that there are particular\nthoughts that they have a moral issue\nwith and they try to\nnot give in to those thoughts which\nactually like earns me respect or my\nrespect\num and because when i think about you\nknow what is respectable it's actually\nlike not giving into your mind right\nit's being in control\nwhether it's sort of like and that's the\ngoal that you know most of what i would\ndo as an addiction psychiatrist is\nteaching people how to be in control of\ntheir mind\ninstead of their mind controlling them\nwhich then begs the question of like\nwhat are you if you aren't your mind and\nall that kind of stuff\nbut i just want you all to understand\nthat your mind just generates thoughts\nright like so if i like if you're\nwalking down the street and you see like\nyou know yesterday i was driving down\nthe street and i saw a turtle in the\nroad and then i started thinking about\nlike the turtle and oh i gotta find a\nplace like\ni gotta find a body of water and like\npick up the turtle and\ndropped it off in a stream somewhere so\nlike the thoughts in my mind are\ngenerated by\nall kinds of random stuff i'm not\nresponsible for thinking about a turtle\nbecause like i was just going down the\nstraight\nstreet and i saw a turtle right and the\nturtle was stranded so then my mind\nstarted thinking about the turtle\nif a friend of mine messages me and says\nhey you should check out this clip from\nlike\nyou know this tournament that was\nawesome and then if i like then i'm\nthinking about the tournament i'm\nthinking about the clip and i watch the\nclip and then my mind is thinking about\nthat\nso we're not really responsible\nfor what our mind generates\nwhat we're responsible for is how we act\nin\nin response to the thoughts that we\ngenerate\nand as a psychiatrist i work with a lot\nof people who have\nnegative intrusive thoughts so sometimes\nthey can be sexual in nature\nsometimes people will have thoughts of\nviolence sometimes they'll have thoughts\nof like you know just all kinds of\nrandom stuff\nthey don't want to think and what you\nall need to understand is that the mind\nis just like a thought-generating\nmachine so it's just going to like\ngenerate\nthoughts that doesn't make you a bad\nperson\nif you are having negative intrusive\nthoughts i think the right move\nabsolutely is to go see a licensed\nmental health professional\nthis is definitely something that i\nwould say that\ncan be so painful and the consequences\ncan actually be\nlike quite severe depending on what your\nthoughts are and if you lose control of\nthose\nthat i definitely think it behooves you\nto get some\nassistance in sort of achieving your\ngoals of like not\nyou know propagating these thoughts or\ngiving in to them\nso i think that like we have trained\nprofessionals and it's not about shame\nit doesn't make you a bad person it's\njust like\nyou know you know you you definitely\nwant to get as much help as you can so\nthat you don't have to feel that way\nand the other thing that comes with\nintrusive thoughts is intense feelings\nof shame and guilt\nright because we feel guilty for\nthinking these things\nwhereas once again our mind just\ngenerates thoughts\nso i think it really like people deserve\nto you know work through that guilt and\nbe free of that\nand your mind can generate all kinds of\nthoughts it doesn't necessarily make you\na bad person i think what makes you a\nbad person\nis how you act right we have we have a\njedi and we have a sith lord inside\nall of us it's just like which side do\nyou give in to like that's where the\nmoney is\nthat's what's important the last thing\nthat i will say when it comes to\nintrusive thoughts is that there\nare ways in my experience to cultivate a\nparticular kind of thinking\nso in this case you know and this is\nwhere things get complicated but a lot\nof times the thoughts that our mind\ngenerates\ncome from a particular experience or\nincident or something like that a lot of\ntimes thoughts relating to\nyou know pedophilia and things like that\nsometimes those can be related to\ntraumatic experiences in childhood i've\ncertainly seen that\nand the good news is that like as you\nwork through those kinds of things\nthat the thoughts can actually lessen\nand even completely go away\num i certainly do believe i mean so we\ndo this a lot in in the dimension of\nyoga\nis that we cultivate a particular kind\nof thinking\nso if you think about where do the\nthoughts in your mind come from\nsome of them come from inside your mind\nand some of them come from outside your\nmind\nso if i have a bunch of friends who are\nplaying a particular game so like\neveryone has been playing valorent\nrecently\nmy mind is going to be thinking about\nvalorant right so that thought comes\nfrom the outside\nso as you cultivate a particular kind of\nenvironment\nyou can start to sow particular seeds in\nyour mind\nthat will then bear fruit of a\nparticular kind of thoughts\nif i'm thinking about valorent and\nplaying valor and like hanging out with\npeople who are talking about valorent\nmy mind is going to be thinking about\nvalorent many hours of the day\nwhereas if i'm you know at a cooking\ncamp with a bunch of people who love to\ncook and we're all experimenting recipes\nthat's what i'm going to think about and\nthen a month from now\nwhen my mind sort of like remembers what\ni've been doing it'll either think about\ncooking or it'll think about valerian\ndepending on what i sort of do in the\ninterim\nso just to kind of like summarize the\nfirst thing is that\ngenerally speaking sometimes people have\nsomething called\nintrusive thoughts so intrusive thoughts\nor thoughts that you don't want to\nhappen and can't stop\nthese i don't think make you a bad\nperson so like\nsome people have intrusive thoughts\nsometimes intrusive thoughts are a sign\nof something like obsessive-compulsive\ndisorder or ocd\nright and sometimes especially in people\nlike i've had\npatients for example who will get\ndiagnosed with ocd and will have very\nnegative thoughts\nand then as we treat the ocd the\nnegative thoughts actually decrease\nand then like they can sort of be free\nof them so there's actually treatment\nfor this kind of stuff and a lot of\ntimes\nlike this person is thinking like i am a\npedophile like the problem here is that\nthey've diagnosed themselves\nwhereas you know sexual thoughts that\nare inappropriate are not a diagnosis\nthey're a symptom that could come from\nany manner of places\nit could come from traumatic experiences\nin childhood\nit could even be a normal variant of the\nhuman population we don't really know\nit could also be related to compulsive\ndisorder\nthere are a lot of different things that\nwe don't really understand\nabout the nature of these thoughts and\nso it's really important to see\na licensed professional that will help\nyou work through these things so that\nyou can get the appropriate\ntreatment um the the last thing to kind\nof consider is that you can\ncultivate your thoughts in a particular\ndirection\nso so this is where like i recognize\nthat this like maybe we get a temporary\nban like if we do that's\nyou know hopefully we don't get\npermanent banned but you know if we get\na temporary ban like i wouldn't be upset\nabout that like i think it's reasonable\nthat\nyou know there are limits and tos\nconcerns and things like that\nand this is the challenge that we face\nright is that like talk but like the\nproblem is that these people are out\nthere\nand they're actually like way more\ncommon than you think these experiences\nare really common\nso the challenge that i face is like\nwhat do we do about this\nright because people are like having\nthese thoughts out there\nand they're super ashamed of it they\nfeel like really bad about it like\nthere's like\nnowhere to talk about it and it's my\nexperience that like sometimes you have\nto face\ndifficult situations to like work\nthrough them so that you can like\nhealthily move past it and i don't know\nhow we do that without acknowledging\nthat these things exist and trying to\nsupport these people and understand\nthese phenomena\nand if we get banned for that you know\nhopefully not famous last words like\nyou know i'm not gonna argue against\nthat i think it would be appropriate\nlike i could understand the case that we\nget banned for having this discussion\nhere but at the same time like\nyou know these things happen and it's\nimportant for people to recognize that\nit's not that isolated of experience\nintrusive thoughts happen a lot and\nthere are\nall kinds of methods that you can get\nhelp for this it doesn't mean that\nyou're a morally deficient person\njust go see a licensed professional you\nwill be amazed\nby what people can do for you if you\nreach out for help\nokay so some people are asking isn't a\nlot of it rooted in being sexually\nassaulted as a child\nso this question is important because\ni want you all to understand that when\nyou have a case like this\nwe don't know where it's rooted i want\ny'all to understand as a clinician\nthere's something called a differential\ndiagnosis\nso if you have intrusive thoughts there\nare a number of different things which\ncould be causing them\nthat's why it's important to not jump to\nconclusions and that's why it's\nimportant to see a licensed mental\nhealth\nprofessional because we could talk i can\ntalk to you generally about intrusive\nthoughts\nbut i would be doing a huge disservice\nif i said that these intrusive thoughts\ncome from this place and only this place\nbecause my experience as a clinician is\nthat intrusive thoughts\ncan have their origin in many different\nareas\nand that's why it behooves you you\ndeserve to go work with an individual\nperson\nwho can help you find the actual origin\nof where these thoughts are coming from\nand sometimes those can be from things\nlike sexual assault and childhood\nokay\ncan we get a behoove emote"
