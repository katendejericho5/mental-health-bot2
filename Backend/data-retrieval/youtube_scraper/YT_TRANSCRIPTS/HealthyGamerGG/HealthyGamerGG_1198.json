    "transcript": "[Music]\n[Music]\nplease\nhow do you tell if it's depression with\na capital d or just an\noff day let me preface this by saying\nthat i regularly see a therapist and a\ngp for mental health issues already good\nfor you\nafter 10 plus years of struggling with\nrecurrent periods of moderate depression\ni have only recently realized that not\neverybody feels this way\nprops to my therapist for that one\npreviously i'd assumed that everyone\nelse felt as crappy as i do\nbut they were just better at dealing\nwith it than i am which is obviously\nwhich obviously didn't help the negative\nself talk beautiful so insightful right\nso like this is what the depressed mind\ntells you\noh everyone feels this way they're just\nbetter at it than i am i just suck more\nthan they do\nthat's so you see that how this person\npointed out the self-talk right away\nthey caught it\nreally good so recently i have accepted\nthat wow i probably have\nclinical depression i say probably\nbecause i've never\nasked about a diagnosis it's not needed\nfor insurance or any other reason where\ni live but i suspect my gp\nwould agree and slap the label on if i\nasked\ni've been working on being kinder to\nmyself when depressive episodes hit\neg focusing on self-care not berating\nmyself for being\nunproductive which is going okay when\ni'm in a really bad place is it's easy\nto recognize\ncapital d depression when i'm so tired\nand sad that i can't get off the couch\nfor hours at a time\nbut the block i've hit is what to do\nwhen it's a milder period i'm a little\nsad\nlow level tired all the time having a\nharder time focusing\nbut it's not bad enough to justify being\na useless sad couch cocoon\nall day my internal dialogue is confused\nwhen this happens\ni know that i should try to be kind to\nmyself but i don't think that writing\noff the entire day to self-care is the\nbest option\npartly because these mildly depressed\ndays are fairly common and partly\nbecause committing to not\nreally getting anything done on a given\nday easily\nsnowballs into two three four etc days\nfor me that can lead to a more intense\ndepressive episode\nokay so how do i tell if i'm just having\na bit\nof an off day and need to push myself a\nbit to get work done\nat what point do i call it and just stop\neven trying to work because i'm not\ngetting anything done anyway\nand continuing to try is just making me\nmore frustrated and angry with myself\nit's easy to make the call when i'm\nreally depressed but it's a lot harder\nto gauge\nwhen i have milder symptoms that for\nmost people could just be classified as\nan off day\nnote that i'm a grad student working\nfrom home right now\ni have quite a lot of flexibility in my\nworking hours as long as i continue to\nmake progress in my research my super\nadvisor is happy and i don't have set\nhours\nthis is something that i'm actively\ndiscussing with my therapist i was just\nwondering if anyone here could relate\nand has any suggestions or insights\nokay love this case brilliant okay\nso first of all the person's doing the\nright thing okay talking to your\ntherapist about it is the right move\nso you know how this person was saying\nthat\ni didn't realize that other people\ndidn't feel this way i thought this was\nnormal\ni had no idea so i'm going to toss out\nsomething and really\ninteresting analysis of this situation\nsometimes this is what getting better\nfrom depression\nactually looks like so let's actually\nlook at this for a second okay so the\nperson used to be\nvery depressed would snowball into five\ndays\nso the question i know it sounds really\nbizarre but\nas severe clinical depression starts to\nget\nbetter what does it look like\nright so instead of losing five days you\nhave one\noff day and you're not quite sure is\nthis the real depression with a capital\nd\nor is this not so this is sometimes what\nclinical improvement can look like\nokay so remember that depression is not\nbinary\nit's not like capital d and little d\ndepression\nis not is is like a you know it's a\nspectrum\nso there's severe depression there's\nmoderate depression there's mild\ndepression\nand as we start to actually get better\nright so as you've started to reduce the\nnegative self-talk\nas you've started to force yourself to\nwork when you don't feel like it\nas all of those things start to happen\nthe severity of your clinical depression\nis going to decrease\nand so this is a sign that you're doing\nthings right because now you're not as\nsick as you used to be\nand so now this gets kind of confusing\nbecause you're like well like am i\nactually depressed or am i not depressed\nyou're like\nyou probably have milder manifestations\nof depression\nthat are still like occurring so this is\nwhere i'd say you know there are a\ncouple of other important things to\nremember so remember that\nclinical depression is an episodic\nillness that lasts anywhere from a few\nweeks to\nup to a year and during the episode you\ncan have\nfluctuation of symptoms in between so\nwhat i'm hearing from this situation is\nthat you are\nactually in or like if some this person\nwalked into my office\nthe way that i would understand this\nlike with just this scenario there's a\nlot more that needs to go into making a\nclinical diagnosis\nis that there is an active episode that\nis being held\nat bay by your significant efforts\nbecause this person even says if i stop\ndoing it it can snowball very easily\nso this is the kind of thing where it's\nlike my boat was leaky very leaky had a\nbunch of holes and it was sinking\nactively and i patched up some of the\nholes there are still some small holes\nleft\nnow i don't have to panic anymore and\ni'm but i still have to empty water out\nof a bucket\nit's not like a gigantic terror\nsituation but i still have to do some\nwork\nif i stop bailing water my boat starts\nto sink again\nwhat's going on here is it good or is it\nbad is it real depression is it not real\ndepression\nthis really sounds to me like a\nsituation where there may be an active\ndepressive episode that is still\nongoing which due to the effort that\nyou're putting in\nis reducing the severity of your\nsymptoms so i would say\nabsolutely keep doing what you're doing\ntalk to your therapist about it\nand then kind of like be aware that\nevery day that you give into it\nyou know like it may snowball but and i\nknow it's frustrating i know it's hard\nto like\npull yourself out of it um or you know\ntry\nbecause you can't like pull yourself at\nit like i know it's like you're it\nsounds to me like you're getting\nexhausted\nbecause you're still like working but\nlike i know it sounds kind of weird but\ni think that the effort that you're\nputting in\nis the reason that you continue to have\nmild depressive days from here to here\nlike every now and then like you know\nmild depressive day here mild depressive\nday they're\nnot as bad and that's because of all the\nwork that you're putting in in each one\nof those days when you feel a little bit\nfrustrated because you're like i'm not\nsure if this is real i'm not sure if i'm\ndoing it right\nit's not exactly getting better what i\nwant you to realize is\nevery day that you don't give into it\nmakes\none day the next week better makes\nanother day two weeks from now better\nso this is really it's a really good\nillustration of what dealing with\ndepression actually looks like\nit's really severe and very noticeable\nand as it starts to get better\nas it starts to get milder you start\nscratching your head and you're like is\nthis\nclinical is it depression with a big d\nnot a big d\nand the more that you work at it\nhopefully over time those days will\nhappen less often so they'll reduce in\nfrequency severity and duration\nso good luck to you"
