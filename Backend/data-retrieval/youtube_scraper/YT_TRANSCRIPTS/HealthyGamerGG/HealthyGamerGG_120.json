    "transcript": "the evidence isn't there and I'm I've\ngotten to the point where even though I\ndon't have the evidence so M what\nfrustrates you so much about ivetic\nmedicine I'll tell you why it leads to a\nfundamental misunderstanding of\nhealthcare it opens room for health\ngurus and huers to take advantage of\npeople and it actually diverts our\nattention from ways that we can improve\nmedicine so now I'm understanding this\nconversation a lot better so so I\nnoticed that this was becoming very\nantagonistic which was really weird\nbecause I actually agree with the\nmajority of what you're saying I I see\nthat if you presented some data or\ninformation here that showed aortic\nmedicine is way more accurate than you\nthink it is I would have changed my mind\ntoday I think that you would benefit\nfrom studying ayurvedic medicine agreed\nwhich is what I'm hoping in this\nconversation I can learn more about it\nso so I I think just this individualized\napproach it's so axiomatically different\nI think there's value to it"
