    "transcript": "let's get started as a kid i was\nobsessed with perfectionism for a while\ni tried to eat perfectly spend all my\ntime studying avoid wasting any time on\nfun and games\ni initially did this because i felt\nlonely and unloved as a kid and i wanted\npeople to seem\nto like me for something this kind of\npaid off for a while when i got into\nmiddle school i was deemed gifted\npraised by all my classmates for being\nsmart\ni tried desperately to maintain this but\nof course burned out within a year\nas i've been setting higher and higher\nexpectations of intelligence for myself\ni've become more and more afraid of\nfalling short\ni feel like if i try my best at\nsomething and fail i'll hate myself\nand i'm afraid of that so i don't really\nput much\neffort into anything anymore my mind is\nnow hardwired to do things perfectly or\nnot at all\nif i'm not in the perfect mood to go to\nthe gym i don't go\nif i can't do an assignment perfectly\nand in the right mood i don't do it i\ncan't perform perfectly in a game\ni don't enjoy it i cope with these\nfeelings by telling myself that i could\naccomplish anything if i tried but i\nnever actually do\ni also spend a lot of time maladaptive\ndaydreaming\nto distract myself from feelings of\ninadequacy\ni just don't know what to do about any\nof this i'm in college now and i feel\nlike i'm mentally deficient because\nall of the time i've struggled with\nperfectionism\ni have almost no motivation for anything\nin life besides basic pleasures i didn't\neven solve\nmy initial issue of loneliness i feel\nlike i'm an incomplete version of normal\npeople who are actually competent have\nproper support systems\nand know what they want in life all\nright so\ni know this sounds kind of weird so this\npost was made 12 hours ago\num i already responded to it actually\nso i first of all i just want to thank\npeople in the community who respond on\nour subreddit because i think that\nyou know i can't get to everyone and i\nreally appreciate that some of y'all\nlike actually know our content\nbetter than i do um so i'm really\ngrateful when people go out of their way\nto like respond to these kinds of posts\ntry to support these people because\ny'all can do it too that's the whole\npoint\nso this is where the other thing that i\ni kind of want to do for a second\nis actually show you guys\nso the reason that we made dr k's guides\nis because this is a common problem\nright so like people face this thing\nand the challenge with with\nperfectionism is that\nit's not like a psychiatric diagnosis\nlike you you know you can sort of walk\ninto a therapist's office and you can\nsay\nyou know i'm perfectionistic but there\nisn't like a particular playbook\nto deal with perfectionism it's not\nsomething that we're sort of trained\nto deal with in an explicit way so there\nare a lot of elements here which i think\nwe see which um\nyou know if you guys haven't watched\nthis this is a good video i think this\nis\nyou know early on this is one of our\nfirst uploads and i think it's gotten\nyou know three quarters of a million\nviews and\nwe hear a lot of good feedback on this\nvideo because this\nhow intelligence leads to avoidance is\nlike a big part of this story\nbut there are other elements too and so\nwe actually have\num in dr k's guides in the guide on\ndepression\nthere's actually a particular video\ncalled falling behind that talks about\nthis sort of stuff and so what i'm\ntempted to do\nis actually just share a piece of this\nvideo with y'all right now\none source of feeling depressed is the\npersistent feeling of falling behind\nand i see this way too often that people\nare kind of feeling like\nthey've fallen behind and everyone else\nis kind of moving on with their life\nand here i am kind of stuck unable to\nkind of catch up\nand so in order to understand and\novercome the sense of\nfalling behind we're going to start by\nsort of exploring where it comes from\nthen we're going to look at how it\nmanifests in the mind\nthen we're going to take a look at what\nour mind normally tries to do to fix it\nand finally we'll show you guys a\ndifferent way to kind of overcome this\nsensation\nso to begin with the sense of falling\nbehind starts with something that i\nusually call the\nproblem of escalating impossibility so\nthis is best illustrated if you think\nabout procrastinating before a test\nso let's say that i have a test that's a\nmonth away and\ni kind of look at my syllabus and i say\nokay i need to study one hour a day for\nthe rest of the month and i'll be fine\none hour a day for one month and i'm\ngoing to get an a on the test no problem\nand so is that what we actually do\nabsolutely not\nright a couple days go by we're\ndefinitely not going to study because\nour mind is we're going to watch a clip\nplenty of time we just need to study one\nhour a day we have 27 days left\nno big deal we're good and then a week\ngoes by\nand now you start to have this little\nthought in the back of your mind hey\nmaybe i should start studying like\nactually a week has gone by and i\nhaven't even cracked the books like not\neven once\ni'm gonna have to study about maybe 1.5\nhours a day but that's still super\nmanageable i can do that every single\nday\nand then as that that thought kind of\ncrawls up in the back of your mind you\nactually try to push it away right\nso we start to distract ourselves by\nmaybe playing video games or watching tv\nor whatever\nin the back your mind your thought is\nthere as you watch each episode binge\nwatching oh maybe i should start\nstudying now\nmaybe i should start studying now but\ninstead you're like no no no let's just\nkeep watching just don't worry about it\nwe'll be fine we have plenty of time\nand then two weeks roll by and now we've\ngot a couple of weeks left and now the\npanic\njust starts to set in just a tiny amount\ni've wasted two weeks\nbut i've still got two weeks left and i\ncan still do it\ntwo hours a day and i'll be totally fine\nfor the test and then\neach day that goes by that we don't\nstudy\nthe panic grows a little bit and then we\nget into this vicious cycle because the\nmore the panic grows\nthe harder it becomes to study and then\ni find myself being like okay i have 10\ndays left\nit's the weekend oh my god am i going to\nbe able to do it and then what we end up\ndoing is like partying all weekend long\nbecause we don't want to think about the\ntest\nand the more negative emotion we feel\nthe more we have to distract ourselves\nthe more we have to try to forget and\nevery day that goes by it can feel like\nthat\nthat perfect score on the test is\ngetting further and further away\nand then you have to study five hours a\nday and then you have to study eight\nhours a day\nand at some point it starts to feel\nimpossible and at some point you kind of\nfeel this gigantic mishmash of\nregret for not starting earlier last\nminute\nlast minute panic to kind of push you\nforward and actually start studying\nfinally and also like kicking yourself\nbecause oh man this would have been so\neasy if i had started earlier\nand so in this jumble of emotions we\nkind of it's like all of these emotions\nthat we're feeling\nwe show up and we we take the test and\nwe try to forget about it immediately\nright we go and we distract ourselves we\ngo party oh my god it's\nthank god it's over so the question\nbecomes\nwhere did all of that emotional energy\nthat was building up over\nthe course of the month where did it go\nbecause you feel that instant relief\nit's over it's in the past\npush it out of my mind as hard as i can\nthe problem is that each time we do that\nthat sense kind of\nthat emotional energy sort of gets\nburied in our mind as a some scott\nand we sort of have this sense that i'm\nsomeone\nokay chat we're gonna just jump forward\nokay so that's the general premise\nthere's some stuff in the middle i'm the\nmore insignificant\nany step i need seen in a long time and\nso we were at this christmas party i was\n26 or 27\nand then she asked me i'll look what are\nyou up to and i was like yeah\nschool and look how far she's come and i\nhaven't even like i haven't even gotten\nin i don't even know if i'm going to get\ninto medical school and she's\nalready done with it and it can feel so\nshaming to be in that situation and when\ni think about\nlike what my mind tells me in that\nmoment it tells me man do you have a lot\nof catching up to do\nand this is the tricky thing is that the\nmore that i have to catch up\nthe bigger the mountain that i need to\nclimb the more\ninsignificant any step i need to take is\nand this is the real problem with\ncatching up which is that catching up\nis an action that's wrapped in an\nexpectation\nand what i mean by that is that the\nactions that i have to take\nirrespective of whether i'm behind or\nnot that's just all a mental\nconstruction\nthe actions that i have to take are\nactually exactly the same\nwhether i'm trying to lose a bunch of\nweight if i'm trying to lose 100 pounds\nor 50 pounds or 20 pounds\nthe action is still the same it's still\nto go to the gym the problem is that if\ni'm trying to lose 100 pounds and i go\nto the gym\nthen it feels like i haven't really\ntaken a step forward\nand so as i try to catch up the more my\nmind tells me you need to catch up you\nneed to catch up you need to catch up\nthe harder it is to actually take one\nstep forward\nso bizarrely what we need to do in order\nto move forward\nis to let go of catching up and\nif we want to move forward from falling\nbehind what we really need to do is let\ngo of catching up\nand this idea that you've fallen behind\nbecause it doesn't matter i mean\nbehind is a mental construction catching\nup is a mental construction\nif you want to get into shape you have\nto go to the gym that's the only way\nforward\nyour way forward is exactly the same in\nthis complex\nof falling behind and catching up is\njust layered on top of your mind\nand makes every action way more hard\nso then that begs the question why is it\nso damn hard to let go of catching up\nwhy is it so damn hard to let go of\nfalling behind\nand this is where the redemption arc\ncomes in because we've been raised on a\nculture\nof triumph that the hero at 45 minutes\ninto the movie\nis you know everything is stacked\nagainst him and that's when you dig deep\nand you really win and you become an\namazing person so i remember after that\nchristmas party\nyou know i went home and i was like\nlaying in bed and i was thinking the\nonly way that i can catch up\nis i have to go to harvard because she\ndidn't go to harvard and if i go to\nharvard i'm going to do better than her\ni'll be better than her\ni can actually catch up the more far\nbehind i fall\nthe more i have to become awesome and\nmagnificent\nif i've dropped out of a collet if i've\ndropped out of college i have to start\na billion dollar tech startup to make up\nfor it\nand in that moment what our mind is\ntrying to do is we have all of this\ndormant\nemotional energy all of these times that\nwe've told ourselves\nyou can do better you should have\nstarted studying earlier why are you so\ndumb why didn't you start why didn't you\nstart why didn't you start\nall that emotion emotional energy is\nsitting down there\nand so what our mind has to do is i need\na triumph i need a victory\ni need something that can make me feel\nso good about myself\nthat it's stronger than all of that\ntoxicity\nof me being a person who's fallen behind\nand that's the real problem is because\nif i tell you to stop catching up\nif i tell you to let go of catching up\nwhat are you letting go of\nis that fantasy of that triumph you\nbecome in your\nmind the hero who just quits at 45\nminutes\nright instead of triumphing over\neverything and being the victor\ni'm suddenly just a guy who is 26 years\nold and applying to medical school\nso the desire to catch up is actually\nwhat keeps us stuck\nand if you really want to move forward\nyou have to let that go\nyou have to let go of the entire\nconstruction right because what does it\nmean to have fallen behind it's a\nconstruct of the mind\nwhat does it mean to catch up it's a\nconstruct of the mind what does it mean\nto have triumph in redemption\nit's all thoughts in my head if i meet\nthat my friend you know next year at the\nchristmas party\nit's just a conversation i'm gonna have\nif i'm in medical school i'm in medical\nschool if i've caught up\ni've caught up if i haven't whatever\nit's just it's all the same if i'm a\nmedical student i'm a medical student\nreality is one thing and we just layer a\nconstruct on top of it\nso the way to move forward is to let go\nof catching up\nthe way to move forward is to recognize\nthat action can only be taken in the\npresent\nand moving forward may never let me\ncatch up but i don't need to catch up\nall i really need to do to become\nunstuck is to move\nforward and so the problem of falling\nbehind\nthis some scatter falling behind is\nsomething that people struggle with a\nlot\nand my hope is that by understanding how\nit's born\nhow it's how it manifests how our mind\ntries to deal with it\nwe can actually take a slightly\ndifferent approach\nwe can unplug that entire mental\nconstruction\nand start to actually do something that\nmoves our\nour life in the right direction so let's\ntalk about this for a second\nso like this is like literally why we\nmade dr k's guides like literally\nit's because like these problems that\npeople face right like these things that\npeople post 12 hours ago it\nreally wasn't a plan like and you guys\nknow like this is what we deal with\nand the the issue is that there are\nactually things that can be done about\nthis so let's kind of unpack this\nand the reason that i showed it is\nbecause frankly any explanation that i\ngive here is\nnot going to be as clean and as polished\nas like what's in the guide because\nyou know we wrote out a script and we\ndid takes and all that good stuff\nbut here's here are a couple of elements\nto it okay\nthese are the the guides that are being\nreleased in like\nsix weeks or something so here's the\nthing so someone says okay i'm\nperfectionistic like why are they\nperfectionistic\nso they have the element of you know\nbeing gifted at the beginning right\nwhich is the whole intelligence leads to\navoidance things so check out that\nyoutube video\nbut then here's the big problem with\nbeing perfectionistic\nas i fall behind i have in my mind a\nmental anchor of where i should be\nand then the challenge is that if i take\na step\ntowards where i should be so like let's\nsay like i'm 100 pounds overweight\nif i lose two pounds and i\nset a mental anchor that i need to lose\na hundred it feels like i haven't made\nany progress\nlike if if i feel kind of insecure about\nmyself if i feel like i've fallen behind\ni lose two pounds of weight and then\ninstead of being inspired by that my\nbody actually does the\nmy my mind does the opposite it says\nlike this is never gonna be enough\nas long as i strive for perfection as\nlong as i anchor myself to some\nartificial goal\nanything that i do is never going to be\nenough\nbut if i let go of that that\nperfectionism if i let go of that then\nlike\nlosing two pounds like in order to lose\n100 pounds i have to lose two pounds\nabsolutely if my goal is to lose a\nhundred pounds it has to start by losing\ntwo i can't lose\nall 100 all at once but the problem\nis that when we have this idea of\nperfectionism we set up this goal for\nourselves of what we want to be\nand as we like move towards that goal\ninstead of like actually be\ngetting positive reinforcement by taking\none step forward\nthe more we strive for perfectionism the\nharder it is to actually take like one\nstep forward because\nanything that you do on the journey is\ngoing to be insufficient\nwon't be perfectionistic so then you end\nup staying stuck\nright so like i'm not going to try\nanything until i can be perfect\nwhich in turn means that i'm paralyzed\nbecause i can never try anything\nbecause the first time i try something\ni'm never going to be perfect\nand so this this is a huge problem so\nhow do you let go of that right it's\nabout sort of like\nunderstanding where did this idea of\nperfectionism come from because it is a\nconstruct of the mind\nthere's no such thing as a perfect\nanything\nlike you look around there's no such\nthing as a perfect like walk outside\nlike i'm you know i'm in a place where\nthere are plants outside so if you look\noutside\nthere's no such thing as a perfect plant\nperfection is a construct of the human\nmind it cannot be found in nature in\nnature the only thing that is is just\nlike what is there's no such thing as a\nperfect rock\nthere's no such thing as a perfect orbit\nthere's no such thing as like a perfect\nanything right it's a human construct\neven geometric perfection is like that's\na that's a human that says that this is\ngeometric perfection\nright we're the ones who apply the\nstandard of perfection it's not a real\nthing\nand so like the more that we chase that\nidea of perfection\nthe more it actually paralyzes us\nbecause anything so this is what i would\nthe\nkey point that i want y'all to\nunderstand if you hold on to\nperfectionism\nit is actually does not reinforce\nprogress\nprogress and perfectionism are at two\nends of the spectrum\nand because if i like if i want to\niterate if i want to try if i want to\nget better if i want to progress\nprogress is not about the end it's about\nthe beginning or the next step\nand so the more i hold on to\nperfectionism the harder it is to\nprogress\ni won't let myself progress and so\nthat's that's the huge scam about this\nkind of thinking\nand y'all are right that like you know\nit's hard right because if you let go of\nyour perfectionism like what are you\nleft with\nbecause the reason that you need the\nperfectionism is because you have to\nmake up for like all the stuff that you\ndidn't do right\nwe look at this case you know like\nmy mind is now hardwired to do things\nperfectly or not at all\nif i'm not in the perfect mood to the\ngym i don't go\nright so like this is the problem so\nthen then like where did this come from\nand so this this this is a result of\nthis right here\nas i begin setting higher and higher\nexpectations of intelligence for myself\ni become more and more afraid of falling\nshort and you can't like\nthere's no such thing as falling short\nfalling short is all about\nnot living up to an expectation in your\nmind if i lose two pounds at the gym i\nlose two pounds of the gym if i do 10\npush-ups i do 10 push-ups if i do 20\npush-ups i do 20 push-ups\nthe action plus the x and the\nexpectation need to be separated\nso if you're stuck in perfectionism what\nyou need to do is separate the action\nfrom the expectation\nrecognize that like everything in your\nhead is just some\npsychological construct it's not like a\nreal thing\nand as you separate out the expectation\nfrom the action\nthen you'll be able to act practically\nwhat that looks like is like\nyou know really exploring you know what\nmakes it hard for you to go to the gym\nand not be perfect\nbecause with the thought of going to the\ngym and not being perfect like what does\nthat\nevoke in your mind what's like the\nemotion that comes up when you think\nabout doing that\nbecause chances are it'll be something\nlike shame it'll be something like\ndissatisfaction it'll be it feels like\nit's not enough it feels like it's not\nenough\nand then i encourage you to like look at\nthat for a second\nwhat you're experiencing there is not\ntruth\nit's an emotion right so like as you\nexperience the emotion recognize that\nthat's just an emotion\nand this kind of reminds me like this is\na lesson that i learned when i was\ntalking to someone who was responsible\nfor security\nat a college campus and so like\nwe i was dealing with someone in the\nemergency room who had been through a\ntraumatic experience and i talked to the\nsecurity officer\nat the university and then they the\nuniversity officer said that\nyou know so i mentioned them that this\nperson doesn't feel safe and then the\nuniversity person said\nit's my job to make campus safe\nnot to make people feel safe i can't\nlike control the pa\nthe way that people feel what i can\ncontrol is actually creating an\nenvironment that is like safe for them\nto be in\nand it was like a shocking thing to say\nbecause it sounded\nso like cold and callous on the one hand\nright like\nand the security guy's like yeah i don't\ncare if people feel safe\nyou know that's sort of what it sounded\nlike but i mean he didn't say that\nhe wasn't saying that he didn't care he\nsaid that his real responsibility is to\ncreate\na safe environment and sometimes even in\na safe environment people feel\nunsafe so what are we actually like what\nare we\nwhat are we going off of here like what\nis our compass\nare we gonna let our feelings of\ninadequacy\ndictate what we actually do\nbecause as you tunnel down into\nperfectionism\nwhat you'll discover is like what's\nactually holding you back like what's\nwhat's dictating your life is an emotion\nand so like the emotion is like i'm not\nsaying that we shouldn't be\ncompassionate towards the emotion\nthe emotion can be valid but at the end\nof the day it's an emotion\nand this is the really tricky thing\nabout emotions is that the more\nstrong your emotion is the more you\nthink it is reality\nwhen in actuality the less likely it is\nto be\nreal right so as i become angry\nmy just my perception of reality becomes\nmore distorted\nthe more angry i feel but if you talk to\nsomeone who's angry\nthey are going to think that their mind\nis a hundred percent accurate\nand so it's a really problematic like\nconundrum\nthat the more distorted our perceptions\nare the more convinced we are that our\nperceptions are correct\nand so when it comes to perfectionism\npay attention to\nwhat it is that holds you back from\ndoing something less than perfect\nbecause that's where the money is going\nto be and as you are able to\ntolerate that negative emotion you will\nactually become unstuck\nand yeah i mean that's like just to\nreiterate like that's\nthis is why we made the guides because\nlike you know this the goal is that like\nthat\nyou know instead of so let's just think\nabout this for a second like instead of\nlike\nrng right which is okay so\nsomeone someone um you know just posting\nsomething on reddit it just happens to\nbe the day that we do a community screen\nlike a lot of these answers are in the\nguides which is why we made them\nand so the goal is to like actually give\nyou guys you know 70\nof like what most people need and that's\nbecause the last 30\ntends to be like very individual but you\nknow 70 of it is like\ni share the same stuff with like 70 of\npeople that i work with\nso that's what's in there all right\nmoving on to the next one\ncommunity stream stream speaking of\ncommunity screen\nnext one okay"
