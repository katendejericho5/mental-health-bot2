    "transcript": "so it feels like therapists never\nactually do anything\nlooking to vent my frustrations and\nadvice on what direction to take\num for the past six to seven years i'm\n26 now my mental health has been in the\ngutter\nto put put it quite simply i don't want\nto be alive it feels like too much work\nand too much suffering every day\nthe reason i am still alive is because i\nfeel a responsibility towards people\nthat have helped me in the past\nto get better and keep fighting over\nthis period of six years i've seen many\ntherapists and none of them have\nactually helped me at all\nmost of it was just me talking about my\nproblems and them sitting there and not\noffering any advice\ni gave up on therapy for a while but\nduring the last half year i've been\ngetting into it again out of\ndesperation my theory for why it hadn't\ndone anything for me so far was because\ni hadn't given my therapist any\ndirection\nfor that reason i decided for my first\nappointment i would bring a list\nwith all things that i was suffering\nfrom ranging from physical responses\nintrusive thoughts external\ncircumstances and abstract\nconcepts like lack of meaning i asked\nhim which of these can you help me with\nunfortunately in typical therapist\nfashion\nthe answer was dodged and soon we were\nback to me talking to a brick wall\nuh after four sessions with this\ntherapist he recommended me to search\nfor another one\none with a more pragmatic attitude since\ni seem to be\nreally be looking for answers even\nthough i was disappointed i agreed and\nfound another therapy practice\nthis one was based in act acceptance and\ncommitment therapy\nthe therapists here were actually really\nnice but act never really clicked with\nme\ni did all the exercise they gave me but\nit didn't really seem to have any effect\nall of the points they made here seemed\nlike general no-brainer stuff\nit seemed like they were quoting\ndirectly from thanks i'm cured\nfollowing dr k's advice on how to be a\ngood patient i actually brought this up\nrecently\nthey were very responsive to what i said\nand yesterday i had to talk with them\nabout general direction\nunfortunately here i really struggled\nwith getting any answers out of them\ni asked them again what they could help\nme with and they gave never gave an\nanswer\nas to what the therapy was actually\nmeant to bring me\ni asked them if maybe my suffering\nwasn't necessarily caused by cognitive\nresponses to stuff\nand so maybe more so by instinctive\nphysical and emotional reactions\nlike a some scar i was willing to accept\nthat this was not the case and it\nthat it was caused by a cognitive blind\nspot\nso i asked them what they thought was\nmore likely\nhere again they would not give me a\nconclusive answer they again put the\nball back in my court and gave me a few\noptions i could switch to a\nmore physical form of therapy try emdr\ncontinue with talk focused act or look\nfor a different clinic\nthey also said that for instinctive body\nfocus stuff i would maybe\nmaybe better off in the alternative\nmedicine circuit\nthe problem right now is i simply do not\nknow i was hoping that therapists could\noffer some form of expertise on\non this all i know is that i don't want\nto be alive and that i want that to\nchange\ni've lost faith in therapy for the most\npart and i don't feel like they have\nmuch to offer me\nbut i don't want to give up i feel like\ni'm\nall i can do is pick one of these\noptions on feeling and hope for the best\nas i can't really make an informed\ndecision anyone here with a lot of\nexperience in the therapy world\nthat has suggestions on what direction\nto take i like how dr k is so focused on\nsolving problems and i don't feel\nany therapist has ever been like that\nso this is a really good question okay\nso here's what i'm sort of hearing just\nto kind of summarize\nso some people will go to therapy for\nyears and\nthey'll feel like the therapy really\nisn't helpful and a lot of times what'll\nhappen is a patient will come into a\ntherapist's office and they'll say like\nor a lot of times you show up right and\nlike you're not really sure what therapy\nis or they're the expert so you let them\nkind of lead\nbut they don't really seem to be leading\nanywhere in fact\nmost of what they're doing is like\nasking you to lead and it's really\nconfusing because\nyou know you don't know how to lead like\nif you knew how to lead like you\nwouldn't be in therapy right like you're\nthere for their expertise\nand then therapists also were trained in\nthis way to be like very reflective in\nterms of like if someone comes to us for\nan answer\nwe kind of like put it back on them it's\nthe classic therapy dodge it's like the\nmost\nyou know simple\nlike reflex that we're taught\nwhat can you help me with and then we\nanswer a question with a question\nwhat do you think we can help you with\nand i think this is kind of\nit's actually like sort of a problem\nbecause\nwhat this means is that like you know\nyou're kind of like you're not really\noffering any kind of guidance to\npatients because that's not what we're\ntrained to do\nbecause what what can we how can we\nreally guide them\nand i think it's a huge issue because a\nlot of times people are coming for us\nto us for like guidance like we want a\nplan\nabout how to move forward and this is\nwhere\nyou know i remember when i was trained\nto be a therap like training to be a\ntherapist like you know\ni was taught that if someone comes in\nand says like my goal is to get a\ngirlfriend can you help me with that\nwe were trained to say no we can't\nbecause like\nwe can't control anything about their\nlives outside of here\nand i think that this is why if we look\nat like life coaching it's interesting\nbecause if you look at like you know\nthe psychotherapy subreddit for example\nthere'll be like a post on there\nevery couple months about how like\ncoaching is a scam and like\nwhy are people getting help from coaches\nand like there's no license there's no\ntraining so like why are coaches popping\nup everywhere\nright like like what what i think\ntherapists need to understand\nis that like we've sort of failed\nour patients or clients or humans in a\nparticular way\nbased on our approach because we're not\nabout problem solving\nright like that's not really what\ntherapy is about like therapy is all\ni'm generally speaking if you look at\nthe roots of therapy it was sort of like\nbased on sigmund freud who sat there and\nwas like believed that the more\nneutral he was the more stuff would come\nout\nand if stuff comes out that the goal of\ntherapy is to like let stuff come out\nand if you let stuff come out\nthat will fix things so that's generally\nspeaking like the\nthe goal of therapy is that you've got\nstuff buried in there and if we can\nbring it out of you\nthen you'll move in the right direction\ni think part of the problem is that\ntherapists are afraid\nto take responsibility for their\npatients\nright like we're afraid to say like oh\nyeah like i\ni can't because then it like then it's\nour skin in the game\nright because like therapists have we\nhave this really interesting kind of\ntraining where it's like we\nyou know we don't really like accept\nresponsibility like if if your patient\ndrops out of treatment like whose fault\nis that\nand generally speaking what i find is\nthat when you when you are a therapist\nand you go to supervision\nvery few therapists will say like maybe\nyou could have done something better\nlike most of the time it's the sort of\nthing where like\nyou know the patient really couldn't\nwasn't ready yet\nso we have all these kinds of things\nthat we sort of tell ourselves as\ntherapists\nthat sort of make it like not our fault\nand so this is where part of the reason\nthat we kind of have a\num and i think that that that approach\nis useful okay so for the record like i\nthink that therapy is really good like i\ndo that a lot you know i bring things\nout of people\num it's useful but i think it doesn't\nwork for everyone and this is why i\nthink coaching has emerged\nas like a field and why people are so\ninterested in it\nbecause coaches are better at like\noffering people answers they're like\nbetter at being externally focused\nthey will actually sometimes like give\nyou direction give you advice\ngive you things that like therapists are\ntrained\nnot to do so like therapists are sort of\ntrained like don't ever tell your\npatient to quit your job or\nbreak up with someone or something like\nthat what we're trained to do as\ntherapists is\nsort of say like oh are you unhappy then\nwhat do you think you should do if\nyou're unhappy like what are the things\nthat you can change like we sort of like\nlet them come to the decision we don't\nsay like i think you should quit\nand this is this is kind of interesting\nbecause i remember when i was like\ntraining to become a therapist i was\nlike doing something like what i do\non on stream and stuff and then one of\nmy supervisors was like i don't think i\ncan supervise you anymore and i said\nwhy is that and she said well you're not\ndoing therapy and i was like well then\nwhat am i doing she's like i don't know\nyour patients seem to like it but it is\na therapy\nand so that i was like really surprised\nand i think in the history of\nyou know my residency program i'm the\nonly one that i can think of that has\never had like a\na supervisor kind of you know\nfire them essentially it was totally it\nworked out great uh because i went to\nyou know we went to our program director\nand\nand the the supervisor was really\nawesome she was just like i just don't\nknow what you're doing and i don't think\ni can help you\ngrow in this capacity because you seem\nto want to do what you want to do\nand so we found someone else that was\nlike much more amenable to my style and\nlike really helped me immensely it was\nreally awesome and i really appreciate\nthe supervisor for doing that because\nshe was just like you know really\ncognizant of like i don't know what this\nkid is doing but it seems to be pretty\ngood so\nrather than force him to learn what i do\ni think maybe you should find someone\nwho can like support you in what you do\num which is why mgh and\nharvard medical school are fantastic\nplaces because you sometimes have people\nlike that\num so you know i i think that\nso what we do like and so i understand\nwhat this person is frustrated with\nbecause a lot of times like\ntherapists are like trained to like not\ngive you an answer and the reason we're\ntrained to not give you an answer is\nbecause\nwhat if we're wrong oh my god and then\nthen the patient will blame us and if\nthey blame us like that'll rupture the\ntherapeutic alliance\nso what we're gonna do is like if i\norder for both of us at a restaurant you\ndon't like the food you're gonna blame\nme so what i'm gonna do is sit down\nat the restaurant and never order a damn\nthing and so therefore if i never order\na damn thing you never have\nany ability to complain you can't hold\nme accountable for anything\nif i don't take responsible for anything\nso this is where like i think it's crazy\nbecause i is a\nas a profession i think therapists like\nthis is just my opinion okay like maybe\npeople disagree but\ni'm sure people disagree but i think\nlike as a profession we're trained to\nnot take responsibility for our patients\nright and it sort of makes sense like if\nyou're working with someone who's\nsuicidal you can't really like\nultimately it's that it's gonna be their\nchoice like whether they kill themselves\nor not you can't make them do anything\nyou can't\ncontrol another human being so i\nunderstand where that lack of\nresponsibility comes from\nbut there's also like a lack of\nresponsibility right which is kind of\nweird\nand so this is where like you know i\nthink that\nthis needs to change and i think this is\nwhy coaching is is growing so much is\nbecause like\npeople want to make actual changes in\ntheir life like they want to fix\nthings and sometimes they're looking for\nanswers\nand part of what i'm a big fan of is\nlike giving people\nbad answers because when you give\nsomeone an answer you're like hey man\ntry this\nand then they're like yeah that didn't\nwork and then it's like okay you want me\nto give you another suggestion\nand then eventually they're like that's\nkind of funny they're like no no\nyour suggestions suck and i was like and\ni'm like fantastic\nso if my suggestions suck what do you\nthink we should do and there's a huge\ndifference between\ndoing that and sort of starting with\nwhat do you think we should do\nbecause if we establish that i'm\nincompetent like it's actually\nreally healthy for the therapeutic\nrelationship because then people are\nlike okay at least the dude's trying\nand i'm invested but i'm just\nincompetent and then help me\ni ask the patient to help me help them\nbecause i really want to help them i'm\nnot quite sure how can you help me do it\nand that's where like that's where the\nreal money is because then the two of us\nare working together\nright it's not like they're coming to me\nfor answers\nand it's not like i'm absolving myself\nof all responsibility it's sort of like\ni can't do this on my own i can't fix\nyou i've tried i've tried to fix you as\na therapist\nand then they're sort of like well you\nknow i know you can't fix me but i can't\ndo it on my own either\nand then we get to this conversation\nthat's like let's do it together\nand it's when we start doing it together\nthat real progress starts to happen\nand the problem that i'm seeing is that\nlike a lot of therapists and this is\nwhat keeps people unsatisfied is that a\nlot of therapists don't\ntry to do it with you right they just\ntell you to do it\nby yourself and they're just going to\nbounce things back at you\nand so it's tough but i think that like\nyou know\nif you're in this situation so first of\nall props to this person for\nlooking for therapists after therapist\nafter therapist and i'd say that like\nthis is where you know you just got to\nbe a little bit careful because i\ni don't know if like i think it you can\nget a lot from therapy especially if\nyou've got a clinical illness\nbut i'd say that like lean a little bit\ntowards um\nyou know lean a little bit towards\nspirituality uh\nmaybe work with an hg coach i mean\nthey're trained in a lot of the stuff\nthat\num you know a lot of the stuff is gonna\nsound somewhat similar to therapy but\nthey're not trained to be therapists\nthey'll try to help you sniff out of\nsome scar things like that\nand we're actually going to offer\nadditional training to our coaches about\nproblem solving so\nyou know trying to help people make\nexternal changes in their life which is\nsomething that's a weakness of our\nprogram right now\nbecause too often they try too hard to\nproblem-solve they're like oh just do\nthis\nand this is the problem is because like\njust do this is like\njust work out just eat healthy just go\npractice and talk to five people a day\ngo up to five strangers then just talk\nto them that's how you'll overcome your\nsocial anxiety\nso that's the problem with solutions\nright like it's like you can offer\npeople solutions but if they're not\nready to like meet them then that's\na challenge just don't be depressed\nexactly just win forehead\njust get better rng in your loot boxes\nnoob\num yeah so here's what i'd say you know\nif you're\nyou know if you're struggling with\ntherapy like i think that it's good\nto let people know that things don't\nseem to be working for you\nlet people know that you're trying hard\nthat you've seen a bunch of therapists\nbut that you're actually like looking\nfor answers and you'd like\nlike their help doing it\ni think on the one hand i'm really happy\nwith the way that this person has been\ntreated by his therapist because they\nkind of say like i don't think i can\nhelp you it's not what i do\nand at the same time like because you\ngot to be professional about it i'm also\ndisappointed\nbecause like what i'm not hearing from\nthese therapists is hey i don't know how\nto do this\nbut i'm gonna try to learn right like i\nunderstand you're suffering you've seen\na bunch of people\nit's not what i'm trained in but like\ni'm willing to try to figure things out\nwith you will you give me a chance even\nthough i don't know how to help you\nand it it's just not something you know\nwhat we see is like oh yeah try this\nother form of therapy like it's like a\npass the buck kind of thing right like\noh like\nsorry i can't help you like go see\nsomeone else like sorry i can't help you\ngo see someone else\nand then we end up with people like this\nand you know a lot of times these people\nwind up in my office\nand and like the people who wind up in\nmy office have been in therapy for like\n10 years\nthey're like yeah like it doesn't seem\nto work and then they show up here\nand i'm like well i'm probably not\nbetter than them\nbut let's see if we can figure something\nout you know like i\ni can't help you but i'm willing to try\nand it works out well yeah i mean i\nthink like\nyou know therapists i think need to\nstart taking a little bit more\nresponsibility for the outcomes of their\npatients\nit blows my mind you know like i know it\nsounds absolutely crazy but like\ntherapists don't measure outcomes for\ntheir patients\nlike you'll measure you know like you'll\nyou'll do things like that's patient\nspecific right so people will administer\nlike depression scales and anxiety\nscales and things like that\nso you'll do that like for an individual\ncase which is standard of care\nbut i've never seen a a you know a group\ntherapy practice\nthat takes all of their client data and\ncompares it\nlike oh like i tend to improve\ndepression by 25\nand my colleagues actually improve it by\n45\nwhat are they doing that i'm not doing\nright we don't do that there's no like\nform of feedback like i don't even know\nit's also like part of kind of bizarre\nbut like how do you give feedback to a\ntherapist\nyou know how does a therapist know if\nthey're doing something wrong\nit's it's weird it's like almost like\nthe education system like i think part\nof the reason that\ncoaching is cropping up and i think part\nof like what makes our coaching program\nlike pretty successful is that like we\nmeasure\noutcomes very diligently and we like\nnotice when someone is not doing a good\njob and then we like\nintervene with them so\nso the answer is try coaching instead of\ntherapy like it's worth a shot\nright so like if you've tried therapy\nfor six or seven years and\ntried a bunch of different things i'm\nnot saying stop doing it but i'm saying\nmaybe try something else\nmaybe try something that's a slightly\ndifferent approach\num and and for people that are you know\nlike\ntrained differently right if you're\nlooking for answers not to say that our\ncoaches can necessarily give you answers\num but i i do think that they i mean\nthe data suggests that they seem to be\nhelping people\nand they're certainly not trained as\ntherapists so like they're doing\nsomething that isn't therapy so"
