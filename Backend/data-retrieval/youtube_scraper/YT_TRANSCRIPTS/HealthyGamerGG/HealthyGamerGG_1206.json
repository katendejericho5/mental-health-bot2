    "transcript": "mind works you have a unique cognitive\nfingerprint which is that you juggle a\nlot of balls\ni guess that you get pretty excited\nabout stuff\num and what\nsorry 12 12 year old sense of humor\nsorry\nokay so um you know i'd say that\nthat\nokay i just got up\nwelcome thank you glad to be here\ni'm tired but i'm all right let me um\nlet me just\nbring up my camera and yours for a\nsecond\nwhat time you're a couple hours ahead of\nme right that would depend on where you\nare i'm in texas\noh okay i'm in l.a so you're one hour or\ntwo hours ahead of me two hours ahead of\nyou\ntwo hours okay in the future in the\nfuture\nlike the sunset all right\nwe're almost there so while i do this so\nthere's not awkward silence\ni was wondering uh i've always wondered\nwith your streams\nhow you how\ndo you interact with chat because you\nusually\ndeal with pretty heavy subject matter so\nis it sort of just\nthere or do you i usually ignore chat\ncompletely when i'm talking to someone\nokay interesting\nwhich is i'm i'm sad about on some level\nbut also like\ni try to just give the person my full\nattention\nright i find that there's a lot to pay\nattention to\nthen i interact with chat during slow\nmoments or sometimes\nyou know if something is going on like\nyou know someone is dodging a question\ni will look at chat and see if they can\ntell because now chat has learned like\nthey've learned what resistance looks\nlike they've learned what dodging is\nlooked like\nthey like begin to see patterns in the\nperson and so i'm kind of curious like\nit's\nactually quite remarkable how much\npeople have learned\nthat's cool um so do you like keep it cl\nyou keep it closed though or do you see\nno i have i have a second monitor\nover here okay and that i i usually\ndon't because sometimes like i need to\nkeep track because i won't you know i'll\nhave muted something by accident or\nwhatever so i need to have it somewhat\navailable but\nusually right you know eyes forward\nall right turn this down so welcome\nthank you thank you and what what do you\ngo by\nwhat should i call you sasha is good or\nor if you hang around long enough uncle\nuncle yes yes can you help me\nyeah my chat affectionately refers to me\nas uncle\nuncle sasha or just uncle it can be\nuncle sasha teo gray\nit could just be uncle oh i see there's\na few variations\nand how did you come to become an uncle\ninside jokes you know twitch loves to\nmeme everything\nso i don't know i i think it\njust something i said and did pro but\nprobably over a period of time\num somebody commented you're like a cool\nuncle\nand it stuck and it it hasn't gone away\nbut i like it\nawesome cool and and so you said you're\na little tired today\nis that just because it's early in the\nmorning or yeah\nthat sadly yes yes so i'm already on i\nbrought coffee\nyeah it'll be good um yeah so thank you\nso much for accommodating you know the\ncentral time zone appreciate oh don't\nworry\nof course and is there something in\nparticular you want to talk about today\nor something that um\nyou think we should spend our time on\nyes\nso a couple things that i would like to\ntalk about\nare procrastination okay and\nparasocial relationships i think those\nare two\nuh things that are very relevant to me\num and my community though like it's\nsomething that\nwe're all interested in and that we have\ndiscussed in the past\nand so what should we start with i will\ndo what should we start with\nand chat okay and then then one other\nthing\num that i did want to ask just so we can\nalso set it up for the people that like\nmaybe they're not part of my regular\ncommunity but they're just here lurking\nhi lurkers\num is that\nyou you are a doctor but what you do on\ntwitch\num you have to fully disclose that it's\nnot therapy\nright so i've heard some people say that\nthey're confused by this or that\nif it's not therapy then what's the\npoint of\nputting people on stream to provide\nentertainment\nso i think i'd i'd just like to hear\nyour thoughts on that yeah so we could\nsort of set the foundation and also be\nclear with everybody that's watching\nthat like\nyeah we're having discussions and we're\nbeing as open as\ni feel comfortable with but um at the\nsame time it's not therapy and we don't\nwant people to take\nthat away and you know possibly\nmisinterpret things as well\ncan i so i can give you an answer but\ncan i ask you a couple of questions\njust because i'm curious what you think\nso what do you think i do on stream\nso i've watched a few of your streams i\nhaven't watched them in a while\nwhen i watch your streams i've\ni've not done therapy so i can't say but\nit feels like therapy to me okay and i\nfeel like i am learning something\nand i feel a lot of people can relate to\nthat so\nthere is there can be a blurred line um\ni think for everybody watching but i'm\nalso\nemotionally intelligent enough to\nunderstand that like\nthere are reasons there are disclosures\nand people have to be safe\nand people also that are chatting with\nyou probably have their own boundaries\njust like i do as well\nsure so and then what what do you think\nso i understand you haven't\nbeen to therapy before but what do you\nthink therapy is\nthat's a great question i think therapy\nis a tool to help people\nbetter understand what sets them back in\nlife\nthat's like the best way i can view it\nor to work through problems that are\nmaybe maybe\naffecting their life personally that\nslows them down from growing in life\nokay that's a wonderful answer right so\nit's like\nhelping people move forward in life in\nsome way\nyes so let's say\ni'm teo gray and and is theo gray like\nyou know like if i have a problem like\nwho do i come to like we're like oh go\ntalk to theo gray like theo gray is like\nis wise right theogrey will help you\nlike and and people come to your chat\nand they're struggling with something\nand like theo gray like steps in and\nit's like hey\nyou know this is what you should do like\nand you can really help someone in that\nsituation right\ndoes that make you a therapist\ndefinitely not\ndefinitely not so then what\nyou know but like helping someone move\nforward in life i i think that that's a\nreally good answer for what therapy is\nbut i would say that you know we do that\na lot of people who aren't therapists to\ndo that what do you think about that\ni agree and i actually joke to some of\nmy close friends that sometimes i feel\nlike a therapist\nbecause not so much with chat\nnecessarily but in real life\ni can't tell you how many times people\ncome up to me\nand they just expel their problems\nand this has been something that has\nhappened to me since i was like 11 years\nold ish\ni don't know what it is what kind of\naura or thing i have around me but\npeople\nlove to tell me their problems like\npeople i've never met yep\nand that's so do you want it\nsorry go ahead do you want to talk about\nthat today\nuh i know it's not procrastination or\npotentially parasocial relationships but\ni'm down to talk about it yeah okay yeah\nall right so\nlet's just table that for a second but\nwe should definitely talk about it\nbecause that's very interesting\nuh so but so then then what you know if\npeople come to you\nright people come out of the woodwork\nyou were\nstanding there eating a sandwich you\nknow\nin in a park and someone comes to you\nand they're like\ndiogray like everything is wrong with\nand so\nso you feel like their therapist you're\nsupporting them emotionally so then like\nwhat\nwhat what is the difference between you\nand a therapist\nqualified i don't have the experience or\nor\nthe tools to really help somebody i\ndon't think\nin the same way that a therapist could\nand\nokay so let's talk about that what what\nway\ncould a therapist help them that you are\nnot trained in\nthe tools and education i think because\ni i have spoken to\npeople that work in mental health um\nthat are qualified\nso i know a little bit or i know enough\nto understand that\na trained professional has the tools to\nsort of like dig deep and i i hate this\nword because it's overused right now but\nunpack\nlike the reasons and motivations behind\nsomebody's um\nproblems i guess you could say so let's\nsay that for a moment that i am doing\ntherapy on twitch\nso there's like an ethical concern with\nthat right because like\nyou know i'm talking with people\npublicly and so if i'm a doctor\nand we say that there's an ethical issue\nthere then that means that i'm not\nallowed to stream on twitch right\ndoes that make sense so then like if\nsomeone wants to offer life advice\nor wants to help people on twitch what\nwe're essentially saying is that the\nmore qualified you are\nthe less we are going to allow you to do\nthat\nthat sucks right that's interesting yeah\nyeah so it's like like i can if i didn't\nhave an md degree like i could show up\nhere\nand be like a spiritual cult leader\nand and that would be totally fine like\nthat's like ethically completely\nacceptable\nbut the more qualified i become the less\ni am able to help people right i\nand i do i actually wanted to talk to\nyou about that as well because\ni've seen so many people on social media\nit doesn't matter what platform\nspeak like they are in when you said\na group like a cult leader that just\nmakes me laugh because sometimes you do\nget that feeling from people sometimes\nthey speak as if they are qualified but\nyou know maybe they took\nsome therapy they read a few self-help\nbooks and then they realized wow like\nthis has helped me and that's great\nthat's super positive but then they they\npresent themselves as somebody who's\nqualified\nbut they're really just sharing really\nnot always but\nquite often superficial armchair\nanalysis of situations\nand of life right and what do you think\nabout that\num it makes me laugh usually because i i\ntend to see through those kind of things\num other times it's impressive\nbecause you know we we do live in a\nsociety where\nwe applaud people who are self-made so\nsometimes it's actually pretty\nimpressive\nuh but what i often find is that\nthese type of people end up\nregurgitating a lot of\nsimilar um small tidbits\nof self-help advice and so\none of those things that i've been\nhearing a lot in the past year\nis about procrastination and i am\na master procrastinator good um\nand so something that is your ayurvedic\ndosha by the way do you know what\nayurveda does\nno i don't okay we'll explain a little\nbit\nokay um so\nso what i've heard a lot of these people\nsay is well you\nyou pro okay let's do it we're gonna\ntalk about procrastination\nyou procrastinate because and it always\nleads into you procrastinate\nbecause you are afraid of success\nokay okay before we jump into\nprocrastination can we do that\ncan i share my ethical thing about\ntherapy and streaming\nyes yeah yeah yeah it's totally\nmove from one into the other but let me\njust kind of close that up for a second\nyeah\nso like i think it's interesting right\nbecause what you're essentially saying\nis that the less qualified you are the\nmore you are allowed to speak the fewer\nethical concerns you have\ntotally fine we're going to get into\nthat in a second so here's here's what\ni'd say when you say that\nclinicians i mean you know licensed\nprofessionals are trained\nso what really trained in that the\naverage\nyou know internet guru is not is\nclinical illness\nso if you look at like literally the you\nknow american psychiatric association's\ndefinition of therapy it's like you know\nan intervention that is designed to help\nsomeone with a clinical illness\nto treat depression schizophrenia\nbipolar disorder addictions things like\nthat\nso i think i know that what i do looks\nand feels like therapy to some people\num probably overlaps at some but i don't\nthink that that's\ni i think the real thing that you know\nand that's because you guys just haven't\nseen me do therapy like\nif you saw me do therapy you'd\nunderstand the difference and people who\nhave come into my office before\nunderstand the difference there's a\nlongitudinal relationship there are\nusually diagnoses involved there are\ntreatments involved\ni don't treat anything i don't diagnose\nanything and some people may feel like\nthat's a technicality like i'm skirting\nthat\nbut really it's not i mean i think that\npart of what i've discovered and this\nthis also goes to a broader conversation\nabout mental health is that\nsomewhere along the way like if you\nthink about there are a lot of things we\ndo for our physical health that are not\nmedicine\nand like that's totally fine but like\nwhat do we do for our mental health that\nisn't therapy\nright right so like there's actually all\nkinds of emotional nutrition like\nemotional support like\ntheo gray case in point you know like\nyou fulfill\nsomething for these people that a\ntherapist fills for some patients\nbut i don't think that that makes you a\ntherapist i think what we've actually\ndone\nis broadened the umbrella of therapy to\ninclude all things mental health\nand just like physical health like\nthere's nutritionists there's personal\ntrainers\nthere's massage therapists there's\nphysical therapists there are medical\ndoctors there are surgeons\nand so if we think about the physical\nbody there's so there's a chef\nright like there's so many things that\nwe do to support our physical health\nand as a society i think like therapists\nhave sort of\nmonopolized the mental health space\nand i think now that we're you know\nmeditation is on the rise and stuff like\nthat so a lot of people get benefit\nthrough that you know like a lot of\npeople get benefit from theo gray like\nyou know there's a lot of different\nthings out there that can support mental\nhealth and so\nyou know i feel pretty good about what i\ndo because it's really not diagnosing or\ntreating illness like sometimes i'll get\nclose to that line but i'll purposely\nnot step over it\nbecause i think that does change the\nrelationship um\nyou know and and i think that part of\nthe problem is that like i think more\npeople should be\ndoing what i'm doing\nnot less like it's it's you know i don't\nyeah i think that like\nyou can support your mental health in\nways that are not therapy\num i agree um and and i'd also like to\nadd to that like\ni i also don't think it's possible to\nhave\na real mental health therapy session\non camera with\nfor me personally you know when i know\ni'm\ni'm aware that our there are people\nwatching i would\ni could never open up to you on camera\nthe same way i could open up to you as\nif we had a private relationship\nas patient and therapist right so like\ni and i i think some people it's hard\nfor them to understand that but like any\ntime you put a camera on somebody they\nwill change\nhow does the camera change wait hold on\ni was going to ask you\na question about how a camera changes\nyou but it occurred to me that that is\noutside of the two topics that we had\ndiscussed are you yeah okay if i ask you\nthat\nsure yeah how does the camera change you\nyou see it for me personally when a\ncamera goes on\nmore i'm more\na little more i'll say a little more\nenergetic because in professional\nsettings people\nsaid be more energetic but i definitely\num\nit's like being on a stage you feel that\nyou're\nputting on i don't want to say a show\nbecause that's a little bit too extreme\nbut\nyou are presenting yourself you know\nthat people are watching you know that\npeople are listening\nand so i'm not gonna sit here uh you\nknow\nlike hunched over lean back unless it's\na 12-hour stream\num i'm gonna present myself a certain\nway\nwhereas if in real life i'm like\n20 times more chilled than this\nand i am very monotone\nuh so there is a there is a big\ndifference and you see it too though\nlike\nyou see it with babies on social media\nyou just\nyou'll see parents recording their kids\nand the minute that the toddler realizes\nthat there's a camera on them they light\nup right they change\nand philosophically speaking we all wear\nmasks\nright so i i want to present\nthe version of myself that i want you\nguys to see\nand i and i think most people do that\nwhether or not they're aware of it\nokay so let me ask you something sasha\nso you try to present a version of\nyourself makes perfect sense right like\nthat's\nwhat we do as streamers and at the same\ntime i'm noticing that\npeople are drawn to you since the age of\n11.\nright so i'm kind of curious how do you\nunderstand what they're\nwhat are they seeing\nthat's that i ask myself all the time\nand i don't really have an answer for\nthat\num maybe more so now like as an adult as\nsomebody who's in\nthe public eye i i understand like what\nare they seeing they're seeing somebody\nwith experience\nuh that has come from\nthat is best known as coming from an\nindustry that\na lot of people consider extreme or\ntaboo\nbut that i've also been able to grow and\nhave success outside of that so i feel\nlike there is a\nlevel of trust that people feel\nwhen they ask me questions so they trust\nmy advice based on my experience\nso i'm gonna push back against that for\na second okay\nso people come to you and you're saying\nokay the reason they come to me is\nbecause\ni you know i've i've transitioned\nindustries i'm\nexperienced i'm whatever blah blah blah\nwhatever you just said right it's very\nvery well crafted very intelligent but\nwhy did they come to you when you were\n11.\nthat i can't figure out right so let's\nspeak and be careful because like if\nthey were coming to you then\nlike you can come up with all the\nanswers that you want now\nright but like what makes you think it\nwasn't the same thing that it was when\nyou were 11.\ni get well when i really think back on\nit like i'm\num there's a big age gap between my\nsiblings and i\num i'm the younger and i'm the youngest\nbut i felt like\ni was held to my own i was held to\nsimilar standards\nso even though i was much younger i had\nthe\ntheir wisdom to sort of look up to and i\nwas always\nprobably i don't wanna\ni don't wanna stay serious but maybe\na little bit more um\nwhat's the word i'm looking for a little\nbit more mature than\nsome of my peers maybe but at the same\ntime not because i was a total\ngoof and loved to be loud and and\nand stupid and funny you know like any\nkid are you special\ni don't\nsorry i feel sick uh i'm laughing\nbecause that feels like something so\nsweet that my mom would ask me\nokay am i special i think everyone's\nspecial\ni don't you know while i say these\nthings about like\nabout my current self as an adult i\ndon't want that to come off as\npompous um because at the end of the day\ni'm still a human right and i still have\nflaws and and i still have my own issues\nand problems like\nevery human being does so it's not to\ncome off and say that like i\nyou know this is me and i am great for\nthese things but\ndo i think about like\nlife am i special yeah yes i'm special\neverybody's special but you have to\nyou have to recognize that to motivate\nyourself\nto be positive but i don't\ni'm i'm a very humble person\nyeah so there's something interesting\nthat just happened right like there's an\nanswer to the question which is\nif we really dig through the [ __ ]\nthe answer is yes\nbut there's the mask on top which is\nlike i'm not allowed to say yes because\nthen i'd come across\nas pompous right yes\nagreed and and this is where like sasha\ni think that like what people and\nthis is the challenge i mean i i'm\nyou know i know you're successful in\neverything but i i think that like\nyou're actually not showing the best\npart of yourself\nbecause there's something that people\nhave been like drawn to\nsince you were a child which you\npurposely\npush to the back when you present\nyourself a particular way\nwhat do you think about that\ni think that's something i've never\nthought about so it's\nit's actually fascinating like what\ncould i be pushing back\nright because you so yeah and i think i\ndon't have an answer to that\nyeah yeah it's maybe we'll get there but\nmaybe we won't yeah\nbut i think it's just interesting\nbecause i think what i'm hearing is that\nalmost i mean so this is where you know\nif you wanted to run a cult you'd do a\nvery good job\nbecause there there are people\ni i've noticed this right so like like\nthere are people who\nyou know like that other humans are\ndrawn to\ni'm sorry i'm laughing so hard because\nuh\nthere's an inside joke in my in my\ncommunity we say\nuh we're not a cult yeah and\nit's just it's funny it's funny i'm not\nsurprised that people have joked about\nyou being a cult leader\nbecause i think you have the makings of\na cult leader\ni see that i see the um title now you\nmake it you make it seem as if\nthat's information that i need i already\nhad that information like i'm aware\nwe've figured this out already people\nhave been drawn to you since the age of\n11.\nthis is what happens right so sometimes\npeople like you\nwind up in positions of public\nprominence\nright so like that sometimes happens\nlike some people call this charisma\nbut i think the the real question is\nwhen people come to you are you able to\nhelp them\ni hope so i hope so for sure\nyou hope for sure i hope so for sure and\ni say that because again\nit's so hard\ni think there's a difference between\nstream life and irl\nso when somebody brings up a topic in\nchat\num you know i don't of course i can't\nanswer everything or respond to\neverything nobody can but um\nwhen i see something that i feel like i\nshould respond to or that i can respond\nto\nor i can relate to i do try to give my\nbest advice but\ni also know that it's hard to keep the\nattention of people\num and i hope that the things that they\nare getting\nwhy do you think people like okay so\nwhen people come to you and you try to\ndo your best to help them let's forget\nabout stream for a second let's talk\nabout\nyeah non-mask let's talk about tio gray\nright which is interesting because you\nactually have a persona right like a\npersona of like the friendly person that\npeople come to\num the person who's understanding and\nsupportive and and\nyou know and and so when you're that\nperson like do you think you help people\nlike forget about stream and\nchat and stuff irl for sure yeah\nso i know i mean i know i have like yeah\nhelped people get out of bad situations\nand how do you understand how you're\nable to do that\nwhy is it that you're able to do that\nwhereas potentially other people may not\nbe able to\ni'm very patient okay\nand i'm a good listener\nthose are like the two immediate things\nthat come to mind\ncan i think about that for a second yeah\nand i and i guess to add to that\nuh i've lost my train of thought sorry i\nthink\nif it comes back to me i'll bring it up\nagain\ni get the sense that you know sure\nyou're a patient you're a listener but\nthat you kind of know\nwhat they need to hear in that moment\nyeah but i i'm\nlike you said cut through the [ __ ] i\nalso\ni try not to sugarcoat things for people\nyep right which is what they need to\nhear yeah\nso i i think that there's a certain so\nit's interesting because what i'm\nhearing you kind of say is that you're\nlike transparent and authentic with them\nand that people respond very well to\nbecause i i think you probably do a good\njob of being compassionate but also not\nsugar coating things\nwhat would you say yeah i'm definitely\nempathetic i can definitely i feel other\npeople's pain\nintensely intensely it's insane\nso much so that sometimes like i feel i\nhave to work on shutting that off\nokay\nyeah you have the makings of a of a cult\nleader for sure\nlike these are the attributes so like\nthis is actually well described\nin in some of these old yogic texts\nright so you exhibit many of the things\nbecause like you know like these like\nthese you know religious figures like\nthey start when they're young\nlike they'll like you know leave home at\nthe age of 10 and we'll like\nclimb the himalayas and things like that\nand like some people express\nthis kind of um uh\nyou know they have like a certain\ntemperament where like people seem to be\ndrawn to them and\nfor whatever reason they have some\ndegree of like insight and you're kind\nof\nable to say the right things um you're\ncompassionate i don't know how you know\nwhere this is going to go but i\ndefinitely see that so one thing that\nsome of these old texts would say is\nthat you've done a lot of spiritual work\nin a past life\nhave no idea what your religious beliefs\nare you know we can go down that road if\nyou want to but\num you know that's how they would\ndescribe what this turned because like\nsome of that\ncarries over to this life and so when\nyou're you know born you kind of\ndescribe being a little bit more mature\nand you you attribute it to all kinds of\nthings like you had older siblings and\nstuff like that but i'd say it's like\ntemperamental i'd say it's personality\ntoo that generally speaking you seem to\nbe pretty chill and pretty monotone\nyou're actually like\nnot that um\nyeah so like those are all like\ncharacteristics that are consistent with\nspirituality and a past or a lot of\nspiritual practice\nin a past life and\nyeah so i i mean i think that you just\ngotta i would encourage you to think a\nlittle bit about\nyou know there are advantages to putting\nthe mask on and and being higher energy\nand there are advantages to offering\npeople what they expect\nbut i suspect that\nthe most that you have to offer actually\ngets pushed to the back when you put on\nthe mask\nand do you think do you think that's\nagain it's hard to distinct sometimes\nhard to distinguish like do you\nthink that applies to both\nirl and on stream\nno i think it's more on stream because i\nthink irl you don't wear the mask and so\nwhatever it is it's kind of like a moth\nto a flame right it's kind of weird it's\nlike\nyou're exuding some kind of signal that\nmakes like randos come to you and ask\nfor help\nand and i know this because i've been\nexuding the signal for many years too\nand so like people would you know my\nwife calls it collecting strays\nthat i collect strays like humans will\ncome to me and they'll be like\ncan you help me with this thing and and\nit's been happening for a long time and\nit took me a while to realize what that\nwas is that you know i can be a cult\nleader too\nthat's why you just have to be careful\nbecause you have to know what you're\ndealing with so you don't actually\nbecome a cult\num yeah i think um i think part of\na large part of that is\ntos and so\nthere's so many\nabstract rules of what we can and can't\ntalk about\nthat it makes it difficult sometimes to\ngo in depth with things\num other days i just want a game\nsure i just want to cook you know and i\nand i don't want to do that or be that\num but there are other things that\nthat i am within this realm of helping\npeople that\ni am passionate about but i feel like\nare difficult to discuss on stream\nbecause of those rules\nlike i always i feel like we're always\nhaving to watch what we say\nand i feel like it's only gotten worse\nover the past year um\nso that's yeah that's can you tell me\nmore that makes it hard\nwhat's gotten worse over the past year i\nfeel like the\nenforcement of these\nenforcement of rules has become in\nsomebody\ni just thought of the court of my eyes\nsomebody said arbitrary yes i meant\narbitrary not abstract thank you\num there feels like there's a lot of\narbitrary rules\nuh that we're not even aware of or that\nthe rules are arbitrarily enforced and\nevery day you see on twitter a streamer\nsaying like\ni got banned and i don't know why\nand i still don't know you know and it's\ntemporary but still i don't know why\nand so i do feel like i i have to be\nreally careful when it comes to the\nsubject that\nsubject matter that we speak about um we\nas content creators are at the mercy\nof of these platforms right\num while it's great we are able to be\nhere and and\ndo what we do and make a living doing it\non the other hand\num these are major corporations that\nyou know at the end of the day they\ndictate their own rules and it doesn't\nmatter if it's twitch or any other\nsocial media platform\nit's just the way it is and a lot of\nvoices are also suppressed like\ni am shadow band everywhere so to have\nwhat does that mean shadow band means\nthat on the internet your name is\nblocked\nuh from being from like smart search and\nauto search\nso you know when you type something in\non the internet and you write like\ncute k and then it autofills\nkittens and it drops down you click on\nit so\nthat's one thing that's a form of shadow\nbanning but it also means that they\nblock all of your social media profiles\nfrom being seen by other people like\nthey they literally cut your reach off\neven to the people that already follow\nyou so it makes it very difficult to\nhave\norganic growth and have people find you\num so knowing that\nand then also knowing what i have on\ntwitch\nit makes it very difficult to be able to\nlike have more open and\num sometimes adult let's say adult\nconversations right like conversations\nthat are meant\nfor grown-ups without and i say that and\ni know people are going to laugh but\nlike\nseriously it's not only 13 year olds on\ntwitch\nright so there's a lot of there's\na lot of a lot of frustrating things\nthat happen\nyou're quite analytical yeah\nsometimes too much i i'm getting the\nsense that you\ncalculate a lot like i'm hearing you\nkind of\nyou know really be aware of what the\ndifferent variables of the equation are\nit's impressive um\nthanks also seems like a little bit of\nan uphill battle\ndoes it feel that way sometimes\nevery day\nevery day every day yeah my uh\nmy catchphrase is a lot of continua\nwhich loosely translates to the struggle\ncontinues\nwhat's it like to struggle every day\ni try not to um\nwhile that means a lot to me i try it's\na fight right like\nthere are days where i feel like yeah\ntoday i'm gonna take over the world and\ni'm gonna\nyes brain uh you know like this is it i\ni have\nconfidence and i'm motivated and then\nthere's other days where you feel\nexhausted\nand you and you want to go move\nto a foreign country and like invest all\nyour time in helping other people\nand live on a farm right or like live in\nthe wilderness\nhelping build homes for people that's\nhow you start a cult\nget yourself a patch patch land in the\nwilderness\nstart growing your own food become\nself-sustaining\ndude okay sorry no we'll talk about that\nlater i don't want to get off topic what\nman go for you can't leave me hanging\nokay so\nuh a few years ago i became\num and this is gonna sound so culty but\ni\ni um i improved my quality of life and\nhealth\nwith uh herbs and essential oils\nlong story short i was having like\nnon-stop allergy attacks\nand they felt like flus right so they\nwould just completely knock me out\nand after trying all western medicines\num i started like\njust researching alternative methods of\nfeeling on my own\nand in that process\ni was looking for some oils some\nessential oil\nand i found a random website\nof a of a\nalleged let me speak carefully here\nof an alleged cult at the time when i\nordered\ni didn't think it was that i just\nthought it was you know a place where\nyou can buy some oils when the oils\narrived\nthen i said hmm this is weird let me\nlook it up\nso um yeah it's like the purple\nsomething\nit has it hasn't even a cult sounding\nname wait but\nwhat what about the arrival like did it\ncome with cultists where\nlike what about the i'm so confused i'm\nenvisioning an amazon\npackage with some bottles of essential\noils inside\noh no no no no it arrived in\ni just threw it away so i don't have one\nbut it arrived in um\nan empty recycled\nbattery package right and then they\nfilled the\nclearly like they filled the oils from a\nlarger source\nand put them in so very homemade looking\nand then they taped around the battery\npackage\nto reseal it and it was just the way it\nwas packaged and put together i was like\nthis is weird i didn't even use it\nbecause i don't want to use something\nthat's not sealed\nright when you say a battery package are\nwe talking like a\ncarton of duracell yes\nyes there's like energizer paper bottom\noh yes yeah\nyeah and now like recently i was\nthinking about it i was like man that\nwould make a great documentary and\nsomebody's doing it\nlike at the time nobody was talking\nabout this place and then\nsomebody else discovered it as well and\nwow they're trying to do a documentary\nyeah\ninteresting so your allergies got better\nwith with herbs and stuff\noh yeah yeah like night and day\nquality of life completely changed\ni find myself being curious about what\nworked for you but i don't know if\nthat's skirting tos\nif you say something no be because it's\npersonal\nokay so even like\ni say that to my chat because i've\ntalked about this with them before like\nthis is what worked for me i'm not a\ndoctor i'm not an herbalist\ni cannot tell you what to do for you you\ncan say that but i can't\nbecause i'm a doctor okay so\nthere you go chat i said it\nuh but i yeah i mean i'm you know you\ndon't have to tell me now but i'm always\nlooking for\nsolutions for allergies for like other\npatients and a lot of what i recommend\nto patients actually comes from\npatients so someone will tell me like oh\nlike this actually worked for me and\nthen i'll do some research and i'll kind\nof see like okay it's interesting\nyou know is there some data to support\nit is there some evidence behind it and\nif\nif i get a strong personal\nrecommendation from a person\nand then find some evidence that\nsupports it then sometimes i'll make a\nrecommendation to a future patient so\ni'm really curious because i think\nallergies are tend to be hard to kick\nyeah and i'm not actually allergic to uh\nlike any food necessarily um\nit's just like and they call\nenvironmental allergies and rhinitis\nlike it's it could be a cigarette\nsomebody smoking a cigarette\nand i start sneezing for 20 minutes\nanyway did you want to talk about like\nprocrastination and parasocial\nrelationships are we just going\nyou know off the range and into cult\nland i'm fine with either\nyeah let me let me ask you about so\ni just want to get your opinion on on\nprocrastination\nokay because as i was saying earlier for\npeople that might have missed it\nexcuse me i've seen a lot of people\non social media that are really\ninfluencers they're not\nqualified professionals in any way talk\nabout procrastination and a common theme\nthat i keep hearing\nis that you procrastinate because you're\nafraid of success\nwhat do you think about that i i think\nthat can apply to some people but it\nabsolutely does not apply to me why do\nyou think you procrastinate\nand that is something that i\ni probably have not asked myself enough\nof i i really truly\ni don't know it's just something and\nit's something in my brain\nthat happens and i've\ni set timers for myself i set alarms for\nmyself\nand then i'll still find ways to\nprocrastinate okay\num can you tell me can you just give me\nan example of something you're\nprocrastinating on\nyes like uh i need to and it can be\nreally small things but\ni need to create a list of\ncodes for instance um\nfor my stream and this is something that\none of my mods who also helps me with my\nyoutube\nhas been reminding me to do for means\ni see okay so okay the one answer i do\nhave\nis that i i think i'm overwhelmed a lot\nso sometimes i don't know where to start\nother times i i genuinely forget\ni feel like i do so many different\nthings and i don't have a nine-to-five\ndesk job\ni end up um\nprobably sort of burning myself out and\nnot\nreally taking a lot of down time so i'm\nsort of always all over the place like\nokay i gotta do this i gotta do this\nand i don't keep lists as organized\nas i probably should so i think that\nthose things contribute to me feeling\noverwhelmed and not knowing where to\nstart with things\nokay why are you overwhelmed\nwell hold on let me just think about\nthis before i ask you more questions\ni'm trying to decide whether i should\njust give you answers or ask you\nquestions\nboth\nwhat makes you feel overwhelmed\noh where would we could be here all day\nthat's why i was thinking about the\nquestion\nso so\n[Music]\nhere here's what i'd like to do sasha\nbut you let me know if you're okay with\nthis okay\none is um i think that there's stuff\nthat you're struggling with\num maybe not struggling is not the right\nword there's there are things that you\ndeal with that sound\nchallenging to me but that conversation\nis going to be more\npersonal in nature um it\ni we may be closer to getting you to\nopen up a little bit\ni just but you've said that you don't\npotentially want to do that so i we\ndon't have to go there\nuh i will for sure um give you like a\n15 to 30 minute spiel on procrastination\nthat i'm like 80\nconfident will help you a lot okay\num and we can just do that at the end\nbecause i think i've already i mean i\nhave a good sense of\nwhat you're you know what's going on\nhere um yeah\nand and you know it can also be helpful\nfor your like viewers and stuff because\nwe'll explain\nyou know like how procrastination for\nexample is an umbrella term\nso it's like an emergent phenomenon\nthat's based on all kinds of different\ndifferent processes and so you'll get\nlike a particular\ninstagram person who will say like oh\nit's caused by this no it's not caused\nby that that's like\ndeath is caused by cancer like yeah\nthat's true but it's also caused by all\nkinds of other things\nexactly right exactly so how do you\ndiagnose so like there are\nyou know three discrete kinds of\nprocrastination that i tend to like\ndiagnose and work with\ni mean it's not really like a medical\ndiagnosis but like i've sort of seen\nthree routes to procrastination\nthat tends to help like 70 of people\nand then there are additional buckets\nwhich result in procrastination like\nfeeling overwhelmed\nwhich just is just you just don't have\nand we can kind of talk about that\nprinciple i mean there's\na i think a discussion on\nprocrastination can be like a 12-hour\nlecture\nyeah where you go through neuroscience\nand different circuits of the brain and\nlike\nyou know it all applies um but i mean\ni'm kind of\nfinding a lot of uh curiosity about like\nyou know it being an uphill battle every\nday you feeling overwhelmed but i just\nwant to make sure that you're\ncomfortable talking about that\nand if you're not that's totally cool we\ncan just steer clear what do you think\nyeah we can dig into it a little bit um\nand then if i'm not comfortable you'll\nprobably realize that immediately\nyep so i may just like now i'm going to\nsignal to you whether we're going to\ntalk about it or like i'll ask you for\npermission okay\nyou know i'll probably check in with you\nand if i see that maybe things are\nbecoming uncomfortable\nthen i will signal to you again\nand then one thing that we need to be\nreally careful about\nokay because there is the presenter that\nmay not want to disappoint people\nso we have to be careful that that\nperson is not the one\nanswering the questions yes\nand feel free to say that's not an\nanswer\nokay so is that um is that perfect\nokay so that works okay so let's be\ncareful because you're allowed to\ndisappoint us\nyes okay and and another thing that\none of my mods just reminded me of as\nwell is that\num squirrel\ni get distracted a lot\na lot that'll be part of the 30-minute\nexplanation\nokay okay\nyeah so tell me what i mean so it sounds\nlike you're overwhelmed by a lot of\nstuff\nyeah i mean i do like i said i do\nso many different things\nthat it is really hard for me sometimes\nto figure out\nhow how to prioritize things\nokay what makes you do a lot of\ndifferent things\nwell it goes back to not having a\nnine-to-five job so\nconstantly either trying to\ncreate new content make sure i show up\nto stream because that is\nan obligation too you know as much as i\ndo enjoy it at the end of the day\num uh\npeople like to say that they stream just\nfor fun\nand it is a job too\nyou know um so knowing that like i have\ncertain expectations that i have to meet\nbut then there's also things creatively\nthat\ni would like to do and i would like to\nfulfill um for myself\num and i've always been independent\nlike i've always been\nself-sustained uh\ni don't have like a team of a thousand\npeople or\n20 people doing everything for me\nright and i just report to them and show\nup like i am hands-on\nand now thankfully because of my stream\ni do actually have a small team of\npeople that like help me with um\nlike social media and youtube stuff but\nstill like i feel like i'm\nalways\nif it's not one thing it's another and\nthat's work life\nthat's not even personal life\nokay so so\ni want to understand when you so i'm\nhearing that you have a lot of stuff on\nyour plate\nyes so how does something wind up on\nyour plate to begin with\ni put it there okay so let's understand\nthat\nokay so this is not a problem of\nprioritization\nit's like here i am like at the buffet\ni've got a plate full of food like i\ndon't know what to eat first\nyeah so this is why people have trouble\nwith procrastination because they look\nat the current situation and they ask\nthemselves\nhow do i fix this that's not where the\nmoney is the question is how did you\nwind up here in the first place\nthat's what you need to fix right right\nright don't try to dig yourself out of\nthis hole because like\nit's jumping in that's the problem it's\nlike you know okay so so you know\nlike let's just think about something\nlike what's something you know what how\ndo things end up on your plate\ni think part of it is survival\nso like some of it is just pure\neconomics i know that i\ni don't have i don't have a thousand\nthings to fall back on\nright okay meaning i don't have a\ni don't have this and i i keep saying\nnine to five job because it's easy\nfor me to sort of paint this like\npicture and delineation\nwhere i'm i don't have a salary to fall\nback on right\nso for me it's i always have to follow\nand chase new i don't want to say trends\nbecause that's so not me but\nyes like trends and technology trends\nand streaming and\ntrends and content because they change\nso vastly so\nlike always catching up with those\nthings\nbecause they are essential to what i do\nto make a living\nis overwhelming especially when you\ndon't have like i said\ni don't have a team of a thousand people\ndoing things these things for me and\nespecially when\nwhat happens if you don't stay on top of\ntrends i'm going to interrupt you from\ntime to time if that bothers you please\nlet me know\nit's fine yeah that's fine uh\nwhat happens when you don't say on\ntrends well i'm trying i guess this is\nlike speaking to me\npersonally\nyou've i mean it's it's sounds really\nsimple but like if you don't stay on top\nof trends\nthen how is your content being seen by\npeople\nand that's like again this is like a\nvery this is uh this is\na career thing this is the reason that\ni'm going to interrupt you is because i\nthink your mind is operating at a level\nthat is way higher up than where we need\nto be function\nwhere we need to look at so like on a\ngiven day\nwhen you wake up in the morning and your\nmind says\ni need to keep up with what's going on\nlike you have some thought like that i\nam assuming like what goes through your\nhead\nlike can we get like very microscopic\nwith like what's what's happening in\nyour head\ncan try um\nthe it's it's about how can i\nhow can i bring relevant\nvalue to what i'm doing today and\nright so if it's on stream for instance\nbecause that's\nmy main focus right now\nhow do i make my streams better and\nokay i or i do a lot of cooking on\nstream too so like\nwhat can i do uh\nthat people will will be interested in\num and then that's like okay well i know\nthat there's\nthese specific groups of people tend to\ncome in\nin numbers so i know that i have to\nfocus on very specific things not always\nthe\nexact thing that i want to do and it's\nthe same with games right like you're\nalways having to keep up with\nthere's a new game release and it\nbecomes sometimes like you want to\nfinish this other thing and that sounds\nso so trivial but it's not\nbecause things are relevant today and\nthen\nby next friday they're no longer\nrelevant\nokay so um but then there's also sorry\nsorry to cut you off but then there's\nalso like just the over\nlike everything else happening in the\nworld right can you tell me about that\ni with social media and with the amount\nof information\nthat we have whether it's covid or\nwhether it's\nand this is going to make me cry but\nlike damn\nthe injustices in our country that have\nbeen happening\num the fact that it's like 20 21 and\nwe're still here\nand sometimes feeling so helpless\nthat stuff becomes overwhelming and i'm\nnot even\nthe primary person affected by those\nthings\nand then i feel guilty because i say ah\nyou shouldn't be crying you need to be\nout there doing something\nto help people and use your privileges\nto help people\nand that becomes overwhelming\nokay so and so so sometimes yeah it's\nlike\nyou want to just the thing that you\ndepend on for a career is the same thing\nthat sometimes you want\nto just completely ignore because\nit's it's hard sometimes to keep those\nbalances\nit's hard a lot of times can you help me\nunderstand um\ni understand you got emotional there for\na second\num i'm gonna go ahead and say\ni didn't see that one coming so\n[Laughter]\ni was just confused by your your\nstatement about\nand then there's all the other i was\nlike what other stuff you know i was\nwith you\nsorry about that i'm not gonna ask you\nmore questions\nabout that right now if that's okay with\nyou that's great with me thank you\nokay i hate crying in front of people\nwhy\nbecause it's weak son\num just because you put a funny voice on\nit doesn't make it\ni know that is part of it\nand that's just like i i don't like to\nuh\nbe vulnerable in front of people i just\ndon't\nis does crying make you vulnerable\ni think so okay that's what's important\nwhat you think is\nimportant\n[Music]\nsasha i'm getting some degree of like\ndesperation\ndriving what ends up on your plate like\ni'm getting the sense that\nit's sort of like survival of the\nfittest and you sort of don't have a\nbackup plan\nis that how it feels sometimes for sure\nyeah and so do you think\nthat's that motivates you to put things\non your plate\nabsolutely okay\nso this once again i'm going to give you\nthe option to opt into or opt out of\num and\nyou know whatever happens today sasha i\nthink if you're okay with it i may just\nsummarize some thoughts and dm you in\nthe event that you want to see a\ntherapist i think there are a lot of\nthings that you could talk about in a\nprivate setting\nlike themes that maybe you could explore\nwith someone um yeah is it okay if i do\nthat\nsure okay um\nso yeah i mean\ncan we because i i think that a lot of\nyou know so if we\nlet me just share my thinking so you\nfeel overwhelmed by a lot of stuff\nand i think a lot of that depends on\nlike how much stuff you're juggling now\nthere's actually like a cognitive and\neven genetic\nreason why you your mind functions the\nway that it does\nthis is coming up for air by the way so\ni'm gonna work very intellectually for a\nsecond okay\nwe're gonna take the heat off of you and\nwe're gonna just talk about\nprocrastination okay\nso um and then\nso like basically like there's there's a\nway that your mind works you have a\nunique cognitive fingerprint which is\nthat you juggle a lot of balls\ni guess that you get pretty excited\nabout stuff\num and what\nsorry 12 12 year old sense of humor\nsorry\nokay so um you know i'd say that\nthat\nokay i just caught up\nnice\nso i was about to say you have a lot of\nballs in the air but you know\nbecause i use this and out like they're\nbaked in at this point so you know\nyou're you're juggling a lot of uh\nlike you've got a lot of different\nprojects going on right and so\nso there are people whose cognitive\nfingerprint is like you get excited\nabout things very easily and it's like\noh like let's do this like this sounds\nreally cool like let me do this like\nthis sounds really cool like let me do\nthis and then um\nso that's fine but i think that there's\nactually more to it than that like\nthat's your cognitive fingerprint your\nmind is always gonna excel\nactually because i guess that you get\nbored easily and you need like some\ndegree of variety\num but the the thing that i i really\nthink that we\ncan work on is like this idea that every\nday is an uphill battle\nbecause i suspect that some of that\nsentiment\ncomes from actually like a lack of\nsecurity\nabout what's gonna happen for you\nand and some of that lack of security\nmay actually\nin an unhealthy way because like there's\nlike this panic of like\nif i don't do this thing\nthen what could happen and so that\ndriving force is gonna get you to like\ntake as much as you can but then your\nplate gets overwhelmed\nabsolutely so oddly enough i think if\nyou want to get out of this you have to\naddress the feeling of like i have to do\nthis or\nyou know it'll all come crumbling down\nor\nyes i agree i don't disagree with that\nat all uh\nbut i will say actually\nsince i started streaming\nmy mods are going to laugh at me 100 but\nsince i started streaming i feel like\ni've been a lot better\nbecause although it's not a 9 to 5 job\nit it\nit's provided some structure a very\nloose structure\nbecause i can still you know\nshow up at any given time\nso it's not like i have to be at a\nspecific place at the same time every\nday but i do feel like it has given me\nsome structure but now\nit's it's learning how to balance um\nshowing up and then also giving myself a\nbreak\nwhich is actually something i wanted to\nask you about as well\nand somebody it's a question that um\nsomebody from our community had but i\nfelt like\ni could really relate to is like when do\nyou know to take a break\nwhat because i i'm taking a break and\nwhat keeps you from taking a break and\nlike\nand when is it okay to go back some\nthat's definitely something that i\nstruggle with\nwhen is it okay to go back to work yeah\nlike when is it okay to take a break and\nwhen is it okay to go back and\nespecially again i keep going back to\nlike this this world that is just so\ndifferent from a traditional job like\nwhat that can be difficult this job\nyou you make your own rules\nand that can sometimes work against you\nand it can make it very difficult to\nlive like to have\nyou make your own rules so\nsometimes we need outside perspective to\nhelp us to help guide us\nright this is something that i love\nabout collaborating is that when i\ncollaborate with people on things\nit gives me another perspective and then\nit can inspire me\nto think differently about things what\nrules do you make up for yourself sasha\ni don't know if i'm i'm like i'm really\nprepared to answer that because i feel\nlike i'm gonna\njump around that like i was about to say\nsomething and then it just sounded\nridiculous but my rules are that i have\nno rules\nso sasha i i\ni'm confused is your reluctance to\nanswer\nbecause you're not happy with how the\npresentation would go\nno i just don't i actually don't think i\nhave an answer for that at the moment\nlike i would have\ncame to your head that was it that i\nhave no rules\nlike yeah i think that that's what\nlike when you said it's so hard to\ncreate roles when you're\nit's hard to set rules for yourself when\nyou're doing it on your own\nyep it is\nit's like for instance today we had a\nmeeting 10 30 is our\nour co-stream no problem i'm there\nlike that's not a problem but if last\nnight i said to myself\ni'm gonna end my stream at a reasonable\nhour\nand i'm gonna wake up and go hiking in\nthe morning\nyou better believe that that snooze\nbutton is being hit\nten times and then i'm gonna go hiking\nat night\nyep so so who is the sasha\nwho is the sasha that that says to\nherself\nthat i'm going to end my stream at a\nreasonable hour and wake up at the\nmorning\ncan you tell me about her the one that\nhas to be responsible\nto other people than just herself\ni don't think no i think that's a\ndifferent one i know it sounds weird\nso i think you're good at being\nresponsible to other people\nyes i think you're bad at being\nresponsible towards yourself\nyes that's what i mean sorry if i yeah\ni may have misunderstood so but but tell\nme about the one that tries to get you\nto do stuff for yourself\nlike why does she say those things\nit's that's a question that i'm asking\nmyself i really don't know\nwith that i truly do what what what's in\nyour head why would you say to yourself\nthat you want to end stream at a\nreasonable hour\ni'm that was like partly a joke but\nbecause i can't just blame it on the\nstream\nbut um\ni'm saying that because i did say that\nlast night like bef when i ended my\nstream i said okay like i could keep\ngoing in theory\nand keep playing this game but i know\nthat i need\nto go to sleep so i can be on time\nand be arrested right um\nwhereas like on fridays and saturdays\nwhen i stream\ni don't have to do that and as long as\nlike my mods are cool\nand they're down to hang i can keep\ngoing for another hour or two\nand then i know that like okay tomorrow\ni can sleep in a little bit\nand then i'll just start my stream\nexcuse me a little bit later the next\nday\nand okay so\nall right hmm\ncan you tell me what i'm gonna switch\ngears on you for a second okay\ncan you tell me what feels like an\nuphill battle\nwhat feels like an uphill battle\ni go back to like content creation\nin general what i do\nuh or at least like what i'm doing now\nthat can feel like an uphill battle\nbecause\nagain it goes back to what we were\ntalking about earlier\nhow do you\nhow do you run a business because that's\nwhat it is\nbut also stay true to yourself\nknowing that there are a million\nalgorithms working against you\nso that feels like an uphill battle a\nlot like\nme and my a couple of the my mods and\npeople that work with me on\nmy youtube stuff like we are constantly\nanalyzing these things\nand talking about okay we'll have an\nidea but we can't do that idea because\nthat means that it can't be monetized\nand like i said you can hear a million\npeople say they\nthey stream for fun but at the end of\nthe day\nit is still a business\nso i think that constantly juggling like\nwhat\nwhat brings you\na spiritual fulfillment if you will that\nmakes you happy that\nalso what sucks is like\ni know that there as we were talking\nabout earlier there are people that\nthere's that have a sense of trust with\nme\nso like there are things that we would\nlike to talk about that then we can't\ntalk\nabout so those things definitely become\nfrustrating\ndo you feel like um that that you're\nfurther restricted by being shadow\nbanned\nlike does that does that like set you\nyeah help yeah yeah absolutely\ncan you explain that to me please well\nthat's like\nagain that's something that i the me to\nthe you know\ntalking to the public is that i want to\nbe really clear about is\nit's not um it's not an egotistical\nbruise whatsoever\nit's it's simply the fact that\ni cannot continue\ni can but not in the way that everybody\nelse can\ni can't continue to create things\nand have them be seen in the same way\nthat the average person can\nso i'm hearing that you're held to a\ndifferent standard\nabsolutely and\nand i brought that on myself for sure\nbut the internet is also what brought me\nhere\nso there's this real duplicity right\nlike\nthey're in there seems to be so much\nfake allyship\nof every\nevery minority group\nand i consider myself part of the lgbtq\ncommunity\ni was a sex worker so\nthere seems to be all of this outside\nvisible support\nfor groups during certain times of the\nyear\nbut then if you actually try to have\nthese conversations\nthose same people that put up that\nlittle flag on their website are\nsuppressing your voice\nhow does that feel\nmakes me angry\nwhat are you angry about it makes me\nangry that\npeople claim to stand for something and\nthen\nthe very things they claim to stand for\nthey suppress\nokay i'm noticing emotions again\num so sasha i think that i\nuh so i'm gonna if it's okay with you\ni'm gonna state an actual preference\nthat i want to continue talking about\nthis because\nthis feels incredibly important to me\num and at the same time since there are\nemotions we're gonna pause\nand we're gonna see if you're okay with\nit because like i think what you're\nsaying is like\nreally really important we're talking\nabout double standards we're talking\nabout\nhypocrisy we're talking about um\nyou know like do we really want to be\naccepting of people because that means i\nknow it sounds crazy\nbeing accepting of people means that we\nneed to accept people\nyeah funny right\nand you know accepting people is\nsomething that sounds\ngood but the truth is my experience as a\npsychiatrist\naccepting people is very hard it's not\npretty\nyeah it requires it's not like a good\nthing like accepting people is like\nhard it's painful it requires\nit's not like a you know black and white\nsort of like oh like let's be accepting\nlike it sucks to accept\nno no and i mean like\nfrom from an outside view what's so\ncrazy\nwhat's weird is like i can take\ncriticism from strangers i can take\ncriticism from\nanonymous people on the internet\nbut that side of it is so frustrating\nbecause i\nlike my whole motivation for getting in\nthe industry when i was in it was to\nempower people part of it was catharsis\npart of it was self-discovery but to\nalso empower people\nand to feel like i have to\nconstantly guard and watch everything i\nsay and do\nbecause then i can't keep sharing that\nmessage\nis is stressful\nbut then also like\nat the end of the day going back to the\nfact that it is a business\nright so like how how are you supposed\nto do the thing\nnot everybody gets to do the things they\nlove for work so i do try to ground\nmyself in that and remind myself like\nokay i'm i'm lucky for\nwhat i do have right and the things that\ni can do\num like how do you continue that message\nhow do i continue that message\nyeah dude this is like okay\ni'm about to get frustrated with you is\nthat okay\nokay i mean what can you say can you say\nno\nno because here's the thing sasha like\nokay like there's the business right but\nwhat i really hear\nis that like there's there's like a real\nyou which is being muzzled by a business\nyou\nand i'm not saying that that's unwise\nbecause i'm hearing\nthat very clearly like you can't let\nyourself out right because like you're\ngonna be punished in a way that other\npeople won't\nyou're kind of like you've already got\ntwo strikes against you and so you can't\nafford to take that third strike and i\ni completely get that um\nat the same time there's a part of me\nthat's like a little bit\ni don't think that that's who you were\nmeant to be\nright so i i think like look when i\nthink about what is your contribution to\nthis\nworld i think your contribution to this\nworld feels\nvery strongly to me to be like those\nconversations actually that you're not\nallowed to have\nnow i'm not saying that you should go\nand have them but i think that there's\nlike something to be said for the fact\nthat like you're considering these\nconversations i think you\nyou know you clearly are a thoughtful\nperson and like if we really\nthink about like what do people need\ni suspect what people need i mean hell\nwe started this whole\nthis conversation with like me having\nconversations that people thought were\nunacceptable\nright so that may be but i mean i've\nseen immense value to having\nconversations that people\nhaven't had before or people think that\nis a little bit like out of line\nand i'm not saying you should go by that\ni mean just out of line\nlike like so talking with people about\ntheir personal feelings\nin a very authentic way on the internet\nwith thousands of people watching is a\nbig no-no\nyou know i spoke with my colleagues and\ni was like what do you guys think about\nthis some of them said it was a bad idea\nsome of them said it was important you\nknow they gave me a lot of good advice\nand like\nhelped me like understand a lot of the\nethics of like how can we protect people\nlike\nfor example sometimes we'll have\nconversations with people before they\ncome on stream\nwhere they're allowed to say i don't\nwant to talk about this i don't want to\ntalk about this i don't want to talk\nabout this\nso that you know they're not put in a\nposition and we kind of steer away like\nthere are a lot of things that we do\nto make this a safer experience yeah and\nat the same time i think the\nconversation is important to have\nnow what i'm hearing is that you're\nparanoid about being canceled which i\nthink probably makes sense is that fair\nto say\nuh not canceled in the\nnot my version of cancelled i mean not\nin how i interpret cancel\nlike it's just a simple fact that for\ninstance\num i'll just tell you like straight up\nlike the other day i was talking\nto a couple of my online friends\nthat helped me with my youtube stuff\nabout wanting to start\na new um i don't know what yet right\nlike\neither something in a written form like\na blog or a video series\nor um somebody mentioned like a podcast\nright\nthat has to do with like sexual health\nand wellness\nand having conversations\num with like guests or just giving my\nown\nfeedback and telling my own stories um\nbut then the first thing is like well\nhow are people going to hear about it\nhow are people going to listen to it\nbecause\nanything that has to do with that even\nif it's in a\nwith sexual subject matter\nautomatically is\non every social media platform\ncompletely\nsuppressed to the bottom\nso how do how do i continue something\nnew if i c if i can't even approach it\nuh and have people be aware of its\nexistence\nhow does it feel to be in that situation\nagain frustrating makes me angry for\nsure\nbecause then you see\nhere we go here's something that i think\neverybody uh everybody can relate to\nbecause then you see\nother people that um\nthey magically come out of nowhere\nbecause they have a\nfoundation that started elsewhere\nand then they can start talking about\nthese things and they can take that risk\nbecause they already have this other\nfoundation to fall back on\nwhy don't you that's exactly okay so now\nthere's a theme right so\nlike what makes it so\nwhat makes i do feel like i have a\nfoundation it's not that i don't\nit's just that it's one that is not um\nthese days\ni like i have to compare it to like when\ni first\ni've been in the public eye since i was\n18 right so the internet and technology\nhas changed so much\nit used to be a lot easier to\ndiscover different people or discover\npeople like you or discover people that\nshared your same\ninterests and talk about those things\nso that a lot of those tools have sort\nof been stripped by the way\nthe internet and social media works now\ni'm sorry can you say that i'm just\nnoticing that i i think maybe there's\nsomething\ni should be understanding or knowing\nsorry\nlike but it goes back to just um like\nshadow banning right like there's just\ncertain subjects\nthat can't be discussed on the internet\nokay or if you do\nthey're not um they're not monetizable\nso like i can't sit here and say i have\nthis great idea in this passion project\nand and then stop streaming you know a\nfew days a week\nand put time into that\nhow does it feel because then it's like\nit's like a pe it then becomes a passion\nproject essentially\nso so can we talk about these other\npeople who are able to like\nbreak into the scene and sort of am i\nhearing you kind of say that they're\nable to have the conversations and kind\nof it's easier for them to make the\ncontent because they don't have\nthe handicap that you have for lack of a\nbetter term\nyeah but that was a little that was a\nlittle probably superficial but like\nyes i have seen people um\nthat are are\nregular let's say like regular\ninfluencers\nthat aren't so much from the streaming\nside of things um\nthat then go off and decide that they're\ngoing to have an authority on a subject\nlike this i have seen that it's not all\nthe time but i think that's everybody\nright like we all go on our phones\nbecause we're all bombarded by social\nmedia and we say oh why can't i have\nthat\nlike we're all guilty of that\nbut that specific area yes it's\nfrustrating to see\nthat sometimes people can do that yeah\nyou're doing something very sneaky here\nwhich is that when you have an authentic\nfeeling\nyou actually devalue it very quickly by\ngeneralizing it\nokay so like let's just follow along\nlike you said that like so you have a\nparticular background you have a\nparticular experience that arguably\nmakes you an authority\nyou also have something that you're kind\nof passionate about and\num sorry\njust i have to be careful about what\ncolloquialisms\ni use yes\ni'm sorry i think i understand a little\nbit about\num i i think oh wow i just had a\nrevelation\ni can't no wonder you it's so [ __ ]\nexhausting\num because what i was going to say is is\ni was going to use the phrase put your\nmoney where your mouth is um\nbut and then it occurred to me that like\nwell you just did yeah and and then like\ni noticed myself filtering\nand then i was just thinking about like\noh like i'm filtering this much now like\nwhat must it be like for you to filter\nbecause you've got a filter way more\nthan i do i imagine\nyeah with that kind of stuff though like\ni laugh at you know like we\nwe're very open to make jokes about that\nkind of stuff because you can right like\nthey're innuendos\nlike innuendos you can get away with so\nmuch more it's like cartoons\nyeah and at the same\nbut anyway kind of going back to like\nlike i think i'm hearing you sort of\nsay a couple of things sasha and i'm\nhearing you kind of just skirt the edge\nand then pull away\nso i don't know if that's sort of like a\nboundary issue but i'm going to just\nshare it like because i i think that\nwhat i'm hearing is that you're\npassionate about something there are\nsome issues that are important to you i\nthink you\nsort of have you've kind of grown into\nthis role of content creator and you\nthink that like you can kind of combine\nyour platform with like\nissues that are important to you and\nthat one of those topics could be\nsomething like\nsexual health um and that\nyou know when you when we kind of own\nthat a little bit like you also say oh\nbut it's social media and everyone sees\nthings that people like you know like oh\ni wish i could be doing this\nand so you got to be a little bit\ncareful there i wouldn't devalue\nyourself because\nif what i'm also hearing is is\nyou know are there a bunch of uneducated\npeople who are pretending to be experts\nin domains that you feel like you're\nqualified to give like\ngood guidance on\nyes yes\nsomething you said there was like\nbringing something up and\ni lost my train of thought again i got\ndistracted but\ni'm trying to bring it back i bet you if\ni went another remote remember it\num\nlet me try to say it again yeah maybe\nthat will help so so you were talking\nabout\nyou know how there are people like who\nwill\nso you have certain things that you're\npassionate about you have some some\nthings that you're interested in you're\na content creator maybe that you can\ncombine those two\nyou think about maybe like starting a\npodcast or something\nand you're not able to or it's\nchallenging for you to do so because of\nsome of the shadow banning etc and then\nother rand yeah go for it so it's\num i don't like to wallow in my own\nself-pity\nso yeah like i probably do downplay it\nyep\nbecause i don't want to be that person\nthat becomes fixated on things because\ni've seen people like that and i've met\npeople like that and they're\nimpossible to be around so now i'm very\ncareful because i never want to become\nthat person\nand i think social media is overwhelming\nfor all of us\nsasha when did you stop wallowing in\nyour self-pity\ni was 15\n13 14 15 something like that can you\ntell me about that\nuh for sure a lot of it this is one of\nthe places where you may want to say no\nno no it's totally fine um\nit's just how i was raised\nand i like that though i like that\nbecause it\ni don't feel like i was um\ni wasn't given like these concessions\nthat because you're a girl\nyou should be treated differently it was\nlike okay pick yourself up\nyou're done crying\ntake a deep breath life happens\nmove on suck it up and move [ __ ] it up\nand i and i think that's\nyou know\ni like that personally it doesn't work\non everybody\nfor sure you know but\num i think life has enough life throws\nenough curveballs at you\nthat like there are going to be times\nwhere you can't control it\nso as much as you can it's a good thing\nto be able to say okay\nlet's move on why do you have to be so\nstrong\nthat's a great question\ndamn you're good\ni knew i liked you but i was damn\nthe real like really truly\ni come from a neighborhood where you\nhave to be strong like there are there\nare no options\ni know that like that i can give you a\nvery black and white concrete answer on\ni'd love to hear about that if you feel\nokay talking about it but\num i mean\ni don't want to talk about it too in\ndepth but um\nyeah i come from a super disenfranchised\nneighborhood\ni think i'll leave it at the fact that\nlike\neveryone i grew up with it sounds like a\nmovie but like\nnot everyone but a lot of the people i\ngrew up with are either\nin prison\nor dead or\nspun out\nso that's why i'm strong not why i feel\nlike i have to be strong that's why i\nknow i'm strong\nand that i can like confidently say\nwithout\nbacktracking on it\nhow do you deal with other people being\nsympathetic towards you\nif i were to say something like you know\ni feel sad that you had to grow up in\nthose circumstances\nhow would you\ni don't like it i don't like it unless i\nknow that they come from\na similar situation what do you dislike\nabout it\nmy immediate answer my head was that i\ndon't like pity\ni don't need your [ __ ] pity i don't i\ndon't want your [ __ ] pity i don't\ni really don't because i\nuh like\ni've made it this far\ni don't need pity i really don't i have\na\nvery small but important\nnumber of people in my life that i will\nlean on\ni respect you a lot\nthanks how do you feel about respect\nfrom other people\nthat doesn't bother me so much you\nsee this is why they call me like the\nthe uncle thing is starting to\ncome out here too i think\ni like a lot of feelings i have when i\nlook at them i say like\ni feel like a lot of very valuable\nthings i learned\nfor the way that i was taught\num\nis usually something that happens with\nboys\nwhat does that mean\nlike i would it goes back to\nthe pity thing like never\ni don't know i just i feel like some of\nthe really important conversations that\ni had with my\nthe figures in my life\num so i'm crying because i'm thinking\nabout my dad\nwho passed away um\nyou know like i mean it was told to me\nlike you don't have to be treated\ndifferently because you're a girl\nbut also like some of these some of\nthese things that were instilled in me\ni mean i know i know that like other\nthese things weren't being told to other\nkids or to other girls\nspecifically how do you feel about being\ntreated differently\ni'm so fortunate\ni felt lucky how did you feel back then\nlucky because it was um\nmy womb you know it was my my rock\ni felt protected by it i felt special\nand i'm saying that funny because you in\na funny way because you\nasked that earlier but\ni'm just kind of thinking a little bit\nabout you know a 13 year old or 14 year\nold girl\nand who's treated a little bit more like\na boy and sees that\nshe's not treated like a girl and i can\nunderstand\nhow that's made you into the strong\nand capable person that you are today\nand i can also imagine that you know at\nthe age of 14\nthat can be annoying and that there can\nbe a wanting to be\nlike everyone else yeah\nfor sure\ni'm also kind of noticing a theme of\nlike you know there's\nyou and then there's everyone else like\nit doesn't sound\nbecause when we were talking about you\nknow content creators and what they can\nget away with and what you can get away\nwith and being shadow banned and\ni mean there's a very real reality\nsounds stupid to say but there's a\nthere's a you know there's a very real\nsituation in that you are\ndifferent right your circumstances\nyou're different the standards against\nwhich you're measured\nis different and i can see that you've\nsort of like risen to the challenge and\nyou've\nyou've faced it head-on and\nyou know and at the same time like\ni'm wondering like what happened to that\n14 year old who just wanted to be a\nlittle bit\nmore normal\ni don't really see it that way how do\nyou see it\ni i say those things but i like both of\ni don't know this is interesting because\nnow han i'm going to backtrack because\nsome of my closest friends always told\nme i was weird\nmaybe there is something there that like\nyou know\ni noticed recently probably because i\nhave been\nvery disciplined um throughout the\npandemic of like\nnot doing anything and not being social\nexcept\nlike two little bubbles um\nso i noticed when i'm just at the\ngrocery store checking out somewhere\nlike i am awkward sometimes\nyeah but that's maybe a whole different\nconversation\nbut i don't know i i feel like i was i\nfeel like that's\nminimal because i still feel like i was\npretty\nokay do you sometimes wish your life was\ndifferent\nno help me understand that a little bit\nbecause for as difficult as as difficult\nas\nthriving can be in a business context\ni wouldn't want it any other way because\ni did know from a young age that\ni didn't want a nine-to-five job\nso as difficult as it can be i\ni find that i do tend to thrive in chaos\nand i do tend to thrive with um you know\nworking in defense can it become\nexhausting\nyeah what does that mean worth it in\nyour defense\nthat there's something always pushing\nagainst you\nright\nso can it can definitely become\nexhausting\nsure and that's probably why i can tend\nto feel overwhelmed\nfor sure\nbut i wouldn't i wouldn't change it\ncan i think for a second yeah\ncan i can i go to the bathroom yeah sure\nyeah\ni'm gonna get some water too i'll be\nright back\ndo we be respectful or do we be helpful\ni think we're going to have to go with\nthe respectful\nblue i got cold all right um\nso i i think uh sasha i was debating\nabout you know whether to take this\nfurther i'm leaning against it\num so i i know you've been willing at\nevery step of the way to sort of like\ni've asked a couple times for permission\nyou seem to be like\ngoing for it and and i appreciate that\nbut\ni have a feeling that if i keep on\nasking you questions you're gonna end up\nin a place that may be helpful to you\nbut i'm\nnot sure you'll be entirely happy with\nit\nokay um\ni i i want to like so the direction of\nthat those questions have to do with\nlike\nso here's what i see okay\nyou are a force of nature\nright not a cult leader um\nmaybe one day and and i i\nwhat i'm hearing in in your story is a\nlot of triumph\num but also a healthy amount of\nadversity\nand even today i'm hearing like a lot of\nchallenges that you face and you kind of\nlike\nare your best self when you were you\nknow when\nwhen your chips are down like you know\nyou're good at playing on defense you're\na survivor you're not just a survivor\nyou like thrive\nin adverse circumstances like um you\nknow just think about what you said that\nlike most of the people that you grew up\nwith are in prison or\nare dead like and and here you are you\nbecome\nyou know a force to be reckoned with\nand so i i see a lot of strength and\nthere's a lot there to respect\nand i think the challenge is that you've\nbecome\nstrong it's part of who you are it's\npart of your identity\nbut i think something was lost somewhere\nalong the way\nlike in that you know like\nin you becoming a titan you had to kind\nof like grow up\nfor lack of a better term yeah yeah\nand and so there's a part of me that\ndoes feel some degree of like empathic\nsadness which i know like really\nrubs you the wrong way um\nand there's a part of me that says that\nlike ultimately i i think that\nwhat i see as a way forward for you is\nlike\nbeing able to accept people's compassion\na little bit\nmore\nyou know and i know you hate it\nand and this can kind of tie to things\nlike so i'm not going to give you more\ncompassion because i think it would be\nreally hard for you to handle\num\nbut you know you can look at your story\nas a story of triumph but i think it's\nalso like a little bit dishonest to just\nlook at it as a story of triumph\nthat there's a lot of hurt a lot of\nunfortunate stuff\na lot of things that\nyou know i would hope that one day\nyou're able to regret some of your\ndecisions\nyou know i know it sounds kind of weird\nbut like i don't think that anyone\nthere's things i regret oh okay\ndon't get me wrong okay don't get me\nwrong\nprobably not the not like the most\nobvious ones that people would assume\nbut there are things i definitely regret\njust not uh\nlet's say like not from um\nlike to be clear as day not from my\nchoice\nin getting into the adult industry like\ni want to be clear as days\nabout that because people assume all\nsorts of stuff so\nnot about that but about a lot of other\nthings yeah i wasn't necessarily\nreferring to anything in particular\ni didn't think you were either but i for\nfor the\nfor the lurkers to know so sometimes i\nthink that people who\nyou know live lives of strength\nthat a part of that strength requires\nyou to like\nhave no regrets yeah like\nlike and and i i think that ultimately\nlike being a\ntruly like authentic person like we're\nall human we all screw up we all make\nmistakes\num and i think regret is actually like\nthe avoidance of regret i think actually\nleads to some amount of toxicity\num well you can't grow i don't think\nyeah it's like you know we learn\nhopefully learn from our mistakes\ni i also think that you know if things\nare\nunfair for you are we allowed to\nfeel for you there or no\nyeah yeah of course like i wouldn't\nwhat would i what would i say to that\nyou know\ni'm sorry you're in the situation you're\nin oh\nthank you how does that feel for you\nbecause i have a certain level of trust\nwith you already\num that's\nthat doesn't bother me as much as it\nwould coming from\ni mean i know we don't know each other\nin real life but like we have\nbriefly talked in different situations\nbefore today so like\nit doesn't bother me as much as that\ncoming from\na total stranger or a friend of a friend\ni'm gonna try to qualify that statement\na little bit more you let me know how it\nfeels okay\nso sasha i think it sounds really tough\nto be like\nso you've made some choices and and i\nthink you\ni'm happy to hear that you kind of don't\nregret them let that you've lived this\nlife\nthat has had some challenges and you\nbecome the person that you are and the\nperson that you are\nis analytical capable entrepreneurial\ndedicated um that you're trying to make\nthe world a better place and i think it\nreally\nsucks that you're being held to\nsomewhat of an unfair standard that\npeople who talk real big about\nsupporting people and accepting people\nactually like\nsecretly punish you for particular\nthings\nand it sounds like really really hard\nand unfair to be\nyou know in the position you're in and\ni'm also a little bit afraid\nof\num i'm a little bit afraid that despite\nthe fact that you've come this far\nthat some of the things that you deal\nwith may actually be like insurmountable\nat some point\nthat you may not be able to walk this\ntight rope because it seems to me like\nyou're balancing very carefully\nand so there's a part of me that's\nafraid that since the tightrope that\nyou're walking is so damn thin and so\ndamn high\nthat like you know i have faith in you\nand at the same time i'm also terrified\nfor you\ni mean i guess i could say that i'm i'm\nlike fortunate that i don't feel alone\nin this\nthat's important you always have to talk\nabout\nwhat you have to be grateful for for\nsure\ncan you talk about the other stuff\nwhat what other what do you mean by that\nwhat are you feeling right now\ni just think about like\nwalking a tightrope is an interesting\nway to put it for sure\num but like\ni'm i i say i'm glad i'm not alone in\nthat because i couldn't do it on\nmy on my own while i might like do\nthe business side of things and i and i\nfeel like i put all these things on my\nplate\ni do have the support i need and i know\nthat i'm not alone\nin experiencing these things as well\ni know that there are other people i\nmight not know them but i know they\nexist\nso i have to keep that perspective\nto stay strong\nyeah i don't think you need to stay\nstrong\nsorry i'm laughing because somebody said\nshe i glanced over somebody said\nshe's not alone she's the coolest\nyeah not a cult not a cult\nnot yet\none day uh once you have a compound\nright compound you have to call it that\nwelcome to the compound castle gray\nschool um\nyeah no um\nand i and i think the this would\nactually be an interesting\nor a good moment rather to bring up um\nparasocial relationships\nif you have time for that sure let's\nbring it up because\nit's something that um like we've\ntouched on\non stream before\nand i think it's something that we're\nall\nas a society still learning about and\nhow to deal with it\nand\nit's you get her a guitar too it's um\nlike we talk i talk about all these\nthe uphill battles right the defense and\nthriving but then there is also this\ngreat community\nthat i have and that a lot of people\nhave on on their streams as well\num so it's interesting to me because i\nfeel like\neven though there's a few core people\nand i'm not talking so much about the\nchat necessarily but like\nmy mods and the people that helped me\nbehind the scenes\nlike we have truly built something\nspecial that\nuntil today throughout like all of\nsocial media\nall my experience on it has not existed\nso that's interesting to me um\nand i'd kind of like to get your\nperspectives on on that but also just\nlike this relationship that\ni have with my community and what you\nthink would be the best way\nlike if we see problems how to deal with\nthem because i feel like actually\nlike my mods and i we do sort of\nwalk this tight rope with how to treat\npeople\nbecause we do have to be sensitive and\nsometimes people overstep boundaries\nwhere it's very clear you know what to\ndo and you know what needs to be done\nin other times\nthis it's more difficult to deal with\ncan you give me an example um\n[Music]\npeople in the past\nhave overstepped\nboundaries that we've laid out as a\ncommunity\n[Music]\num\nin ways that can become really scary and\nfrightening because it tells me that\nmaybe i'm doing something wrong that i'm\nnot\ndelivering a clear enough message that\nlike\nwhile i do look forward to seeing people\nand a lot of\npeople that are in almost every single\none of my stream\na majority of those people respect the\nboundaries\nand sometimes\nit's almost like an unspoken like\nsometimes those boundaries feel like an\nunspoken\num they feel unspoken you know like we\nwe know what to expect the majority of\npeople know what to expect\nand every so often there are people that\nthat don't know but then of course like\nwe have the mods that they do make it\nclear like\nto not do certain things right whether\nit's on twitch or on\non discord after the fact but um\ni get i don't know if it's so much of a\npurse\nlike for me specifically but as a whole\nlike where do you see this going as a\nsociety like\nhow do we so how do we send a positive\nmessage but also like know when to cut\nit off\nso sasha can you define for me what a\nparasocial relationship\nis yes um\nin the case of i'll give myself as an\nexample here\ni'm here i represent something to the\npeople\nthat watch my streams\nbut the relationship is not reciprocated\nin a way that our irl relationship would\nbe\nright like i am not friends with these\npeople in real life\ni am friendly with them but i don't\nactually know them\num\nand so what what i'm hearing is that it\nhas some of the attributes\nof a real-life relationship but\nby virtue of it being an online\nrelationship there's something like you\nknow it doesn't translate a hundred\npercent\nso yeah exactly you know you can start\nto appreciate other people\ninteract with them they have their own\npersonalities some of them are trolls\nsome of them are funny some of them are\ncompassionate\nand so you can communicate with them you\ncan interact with them you can form some\nkind of relationship with them\nbut it's not it doesn't come with\neverything\nthat a real social relationship comes\nwith yeah i i shouldn't even say real\nsocial because i think it's just a\ndifferent kind of\nan in-person social relationship and\nthat there are some\nmost people tend to sort of understand\nthat there are some unspoken boundaries\nbut that some people really don't\nunderstand those boundaries\nso this is where we've talked with\nseveral streamers about parasocial\nrelationships and i have some thoughts\nbut i think what's really missing from\nthis conversation is what we really need\nto do is get\ni don't know if this is you know tos\nfriendly but like\ni think the the if we really want to\nunderstand parasocial relationships we\nhave to understand the other side of the\nstory too\nso this is where like you know i think\nthat like\nunderstanding what is in the mind of\nsomeone who does not respect a boundary\nis very important like that's the\nmissing part of the equation for me\nright so like like and this is where i\nthink we've had\nyou know some we've had some people on\nstream that have\ncertainly posted on our subreddit and\nstuff about like you know\nfeeling lonely and and giving lots of\nmoney to particular content creators\nin the hopes that um you know it'll\nit'll they're looking to fill some kind\nof void or connection\nand and so so we we have some experience\nwith this but i think that's just an\nimportant part of the equation\num but let me ask you i mean what do you\nthink is gonna happen\nlike what do you what do you think\ni don't know i mean\nlike i said i i tried\nremoving try i do my best to\nbe clear about these things on stream we\ncreate\ncommands uh that like guests can use and\nthat moderators can use but that's only\nin my i can only control what\nor you know try to control or observe\nand and\ncultivate the community that i have not\nother people's\num so i think\ni think twitch is cool because we have\nall these tools at our disposal so\num it makes it a lot cleaner\nand makes the rules um\nyou know the rules are there they're up\nfront\nwe're not hiding things from people um\nbut you go on other forms of social\nmedia and a lot of people don't do that\nand or it's impossible because those\ntools don't exist on other forms of\nsocial media\num\nyeah it's it's i i guess a question too\ni have is just like\nam i doing enough to make those things\nclear i i don't know i don't know what\nyou're should it\nshould we\njust look let me yeah let me take a stab\nat this okay so can i just share like\nsome thoughts about how i understand\nparasocial relationships\nand what we need to do about it so like\nthe first thing is that i think that\nfrom a neuroscience perspective there's\na reason why these things are happening\nso as human beings we tend to like\nassociate\nthings with other things i know it\nsounds like such a simple\nsentence but you know so for example\num you know a classic thing that we'll\nkind of get into is like\nbeing friend zoned or [ __ ] zoned right\nwhere like\nthere'll be and it's usually like a dude\nwho gets friend-zoned i'd say like most\nof the cases i hear about\ntend to be with men and i think there's\nactually like a a neuroscientific and\nlike\ndevelopmental reason for that i don't i\ndon't think it's it's not the y\nchromosome it's more that\nyou know men tend to be socialized to\nexpect emotional intimacy and only is\na very small number of cases so\nemotional\nintimacy is okay with mom usually\nnot even okay with sisters not okay with\nbrothers oftentimes not okay with dad\nmaybe like emotional intimacy is okay\nwith grandma\nand then like romantic partners so those\nare the people\nwith whom i'm allowed to feel social\nlike we're like coded that way we're\nprogrammed yeah\nand so oftentimes what happens is is if\nyou look at\nyou know i may i'm not trying to offend\nanyone it's just general anecdotal\nobservations and a little bit of data to\nback this up but frankly not very much\ni think the way that um you know girls\nare raised or were\nraised was different right so there's\nmore emotional intimacy within\nfriendships there\nand so then you get into this situation\nwhere like i you know\nworking with the people that i have what\ni've noticed is that\nemotional intimacy between a man and a\nwoman in their early 20s\nmeans different things yeah so for the\nwoman it's like completely acceptable to\nhave a friend that you emotionally\nconfide in\nand for a dude it can be really\nconfusing because they're they're kind\nof like\nit's they're under the impression\nwhether it's correct or incorrect or\nprogrammed or genetic i have no idea\nbut somewhere along the way they have\nthis programming in their mind that if\ni'm emotionally intimate with someone\nthat also comes with feelings of romance\nand sex\nand so there's kind of like a\ncommunication breakdown here\na breakdown of expectations and i think\nsomething similar happens in parasocial\nrelationships\nso what happens is our brains are wired\nto associate\ncertain things with other things like\nfor example\na hundred years ago if i had an inside\njoke with someone\nwhat other things would i have with them\nthe short answer is a lot right because\nan inside joke is\nonly possible when there are other like\ncheck marks of a relationship that have\ndeveloped like i have to see them for a\nwhile\ni have to be to a certain degree like\nvulnerable like we have to have like\nsome kind of common cause or like\nyou know like inside jokes come with a\ncertain\nif you think about when do you unlock\nthe inside joke in a relationship\nyou unlock it like after you're at a\nhigh level of friendship\nyeah you know and and it reminds me this\nlike funny quote from the office where\nwhere michael scott i don't know if\nyou've watched the office and he kind of\ntalks about the\ninside jokes and he's like i've always\nwanted to be a part of one\nyou know and and it's kind of like this\nthis idea that like an inside joke\ncomes with other stuff yeah we sort of\nprogrammed that way and so enter twitch\nchat\nwhere like now we have inside jokes but\nit doesn't seem to be coming with the\nother stuff\nyes and so i think people start to get\nlike kind of\ni don't know if confused is the right\nword but there's like kind of like a\nprogramming does not compute error\nbecause usually when i have an\ninside joke with them it also means that\nlike i'm allowed to text them at any\nhour of the day\nright right like there are certain\nassociations that come\nand so i think what happens with social\nmedia is that like we're finding ways to\nlike short-circuit some of our\nprogramming\nor like hijack actually hijack is a\nmaybe a better word\nhijack some of our programming and\ncertainly video games do do this\nneuroscientifically where like\nif we think about the drive for\nachievement so we have this thing called\num the intent to mastery\nwhich is a very very simple hard wired\ncore of your brain kind of thing which\nis like if i have a\nsix month or four month old and i hand\nthem a ball\nthey will try to hold it and if they\ndrop it\nwhat do they do\nany idea huh cry right\nsure the answer i was looking for well\nthat's a fair one\nthe answer that i was looking for is\nthey pick it up right so like\nlike if a kid stumbles like they're\ngonna like everyone learns how to walk\nright like no one\nno one like gives up on learning how to\nwalk if you think about it it's like\nreally really hard you fall\nover and over and over again so like we\nhave this\nhard-wired part of our mind that's like\ni want to get better at this\ni need to get better at this and i have\nto become a master\nand then if you look at video games what\nvideo games have done is like let's give\npeople like\nachievements that they can grind for a\ndecade\nand it kind of taps into that\nneuroscience circuit of like wanting to\nmaster something\nwhich if we didn't have this part of our\nbrain like we wouldn't learn how to walk\nyeah right and and so in the parasocial\nway i think we have a similar\nhijacking going on where like now you\nhave some degrees of intimacy like now\nsasha like there are people watching at\nhome\nthat despite you know all of our best\nefforts and i probably i mean honestly\nsometimes you caught me off guard i\nreally can't blame myself but sometimes\ni had a feeling\ni knew what was gonna happen if i asked\nyou a question\nand so they've seen a vulnerable part of\nyou and so what's that gonna trigger\nin their mind right like normally like\nwhen do i get to see\nsomeone bear their vulnerable self it\ncomes at a certain tier of relationship\nand so now like in some brands out there\nwe've unlocked that reward but the\nunderlying foundation of the\nrelationship is not there\nand that's what gets confusing for\npeople because at this point they feel\nlike they know you\nsasha yeah they know you so well\nand they're not exactly wrong right\nbecause they do know\nsome things about you and there's a lot\nof authenticity and i think part of what\nmakes you like a successful content\ncreator\na successful personality is sure you've\ngot a mask but i think you know how to\nlet enough of the authenticity bleed\nthrough\nright i don't think you have to pretend\nto have fun like i think you genuinely\nenjoy doing some right things that you\ndo and there's like\nthere's like a calculated authenticity\nthere and so when people\nsee that calculated authenticity it's\nstill an authentic there's an\nauthenticity there's an\nintimacy to it and then that triggers\nlike\ncertain neurological or like\nsociological like programming\nand then some people are able to\nnavigate that\nactivation of that programming pretty\nwell and they know how to respect a\nboundary\nand some people get a little bit more\nconfused yeah and i think that's why\nparasocial relationships happen\nand and it's interesting because you you\nknow there is a certain like connection\nto your community even that you feel\nright like oh\n100 right so so like if we think about\nyou know why is that happening it's\nbecause the same thing is happening in\nyour mind that when you're vulnerable\nand everyone sends hearts you know in\nthe chat\nand then it's like there's a certain\npart of you that feels like\naccepted appreciated loved you know\nand then like it's sort of like like and\nthen\nthere are some streamers who\nlet the confusion get the better of them\nand there are some streamers who\nmaintain boundaries\nright yeah and then like there are some\nstreamers and then we had um\ni think we had someone on\nlike over a year ago who was like a mod\nin someone's community and then the\nperson got really big\nand then they felt like they were owed\nmore\nand like felt like they got abandoned\nand left behind and all\nthey sacrificed a lot to like you know\nbring this person like\nhelp this person succeed and then they\nfelt like they were discarded afterward\nand things like that\num so i think there are some streamers\nthat you know will\nmuddy that boundary a little bit like\ni'm still confused about\nwhat happens when\nlike do you ever like what happens when\nyou see people from your\nchat at twitchcon you know i've actually\nnever been to twitchcon\neither have i so i don't know but i've\nbeen to other\nyou know i've i dj well pandemic i\nhaven't dj in a long time but i dj\nbut there's a different boundary there\ntoo because most of the time\ni'm on a stage you know i'm separa i'm\nphysically separated\nbut then sometimes it's like the club\nasks you to do um\nlike autographs afterwards you know or\ntake some pictures\num so even then that feels boundary to\nme right because it's sort of like\nyou're there as a dj but like i i don't\ni don't know like what would happen you\nknow if you run into someone on the\nstreet\nand uh i'm\nlike it depends how people approach me\nreally okay i have a\ni'm pretty sensitive to things so like\nif if they feel\nsafe to me and they're respectful\ni'm pretty open but like if i'm\ntalking to somebody and eating\na pasta or eating a taco and this has\nhappened and you put a camera in my face\nlike that's you know that\nthat's not okay yeah of course\nbut if you like if you're respectful in\nyour approach it's it changes my\nattitude for sure um\nso so just going back to the parasocial\nrelationship i think it like it comes\ndown to like the fact that this\nrelationship checks some of the boxes\nfrom a normal relationship and i even\nhesitate to\nto because you asked me the question\nwhat's going to happen i hesitate to use\nthe word normal because i think what\nwe're gonna\nwhat we're gonna discover is like you\nknow back in the day there was like\nmarriage\nand then there was like people getting\nengaged and then you have a girlfriend\nand so like\nlike you know in india the concept of a\ngirlfriend was\nis not it wasn't existent\nyeah like i remember telling my mom so i\nhid my girlfriend from my mom for years\nand then like telling her like oh yeah\nshe's my girlfriend and she was like\nshe's your friend and i'm like no she's\nmy girlfriend and she's like\ndoes that mean that you're getting\nmarried and i was like\nno and then she was like wait i'm\nconfused\nwhat's the point of having a girlfriend\nif you're not gonna get married\nyeah and it was just like it's like a\nnew construction that is not like did\nnot exist\nbefore right and she was just like so\nconfused because she's like\nthere are friendships and there are\nmarriages and there's nothing in between\nyeah and so now what's happening is\nthere's like a real life relationship\nand there's a parasocial relationship\nand i think both of those are going to\nbecome\nlike new versions of stuff right now\nthere are open relationships and friends\nwith benefits and there are\nso many different things that like like\nif you think about friends with benefits\nthat's an example of like\nit used to be that sexual activity came\nwith certain stuff\nand now people have evolved to say that\nokay we can have\nsexual activity without the other stuff\nyou can have friendship and sexual\nactivity\nand so i my sense is that the parasocial\nrelationship is\nhas already become a thing and it will\ncontinue to become a thing\nand and even as social media gets more\nsophisticated it will become more of a\nthing because i think what social media\nplatforms are discovering\nis that the the stronger the parasocial\nrelationship\nprobably the higher the user engagement\nwell it's yeah it's interesting these\nthings like you said these things have\nalways existed it's the same with like\ni mean going to see somebody at a\nconcert right\nyeah i mean there's this thing still\ndoes exist\nbut with social media and specifically\nwith a live\ninteraction it totally changes the game\nyeah so i think i think the\nthe sorry to cut cut you off there but i\njust wanted to like\ncompletely echo your point because i\nthink that if you think about the brain\nright like if i\nyou know if i'm a huge fan of like pearl\njam\nand and like i can listen to this dude's\nmusic and i can feel really connected to\nthem like\nthere is there's only so much stuff in\nmy brain\nthat gets checked yeah and then like if\ni see him at a concert then like more\nstuff gets checked and just like you\nsaid with live interaction like\nwhat someone can do sasha is they can\ntalk to you and you will respond to them\nyeah right and when someone when someone\ncomes and talks to you\non a regular basis and you respond to\nthem\nand you guys joke together and then like\nyou\ncome on our stream and you share some\nstuff and now they\nknow you more and they feel like they\nreally know you like they're like it's\nthey're not wrong right like they're\nthey're checking these boxes\nof a relationship consistency inside\njokes\nlaughing together having a good time\ntogether being there\nremember when dot dot dot remember that\ntime\nand then like if you think about what's\na real relationship like those are all\nof the check boxes\nso i think it's going to get in a sense\nquote unquote worse\nbut i think that parasocial because\npeople are going to figure out how to\nhave like more interaction\nright like we're going to figure out how\nto you know we're going to have like\nmore inside jokes and we're going to\nhave like\nlike emotes and we're going to have more\nstuff that can be like this is because\nlike i think a big part of the\nparasocial relationship is\nit's ours sasha it's not yours it's it's\nnot mine it's ours\ni like that too yep like i do get\nsomething out of that\nit does make me happy and like i find\nmyself\ntelling my irl friends and family\nthings that happen on stream all the\ntime like it does become\na sure very important part of my life so\nnow we begin to see that there is\nactually some degree of reciprocity\nright that it's not just one way that\nlike they're making you\nlaugh and you're making them laugh yeah\nthat when they're having a bad day\ndiogray shows up and when you're having\na bad day maybe the more observant\nmembers of your chat notice and they\nsend you some\nsupport and there's like absolutely a\nreciprocity\nyeah now as to what to do about it\ni think also because sorry to cut you\noff but i don't want to forget like\ni i see people or\nnot just on twitch but um on other\nplatforms as well like call people their\nbesties\nor call them um\nor or like say i love you\nyeah you mean the creators or the\nyeah yeah yeah the creators saying that\nto their community\ni mean they're like again there are a\nfew people that i've actually\nbecome internet friends with that i do\nlove like i have love for them even\nthough i've never met them\nbut then there's the actual chat side of\nthings that\nthat in my opinion becomes so dangerous\nwhat's dangerous about it i think it\nsets\nit it's\nit's raw it feels wrong on so many\nlevels\nwhat feels wrong about it\ni'm probably speaking i mean it makes me\nthink of just my own experiences like\ni've dealt with\nreal stalkers irl and cyber stalkers\nso i know what being online\nwhat the territory is you know what\ncomes with being online\nand that is one of the very negative\nside effects of it\nor hopefully not for everybody but it\ncan be a very negative side effect\nand i feel like that kind of\nsometimes there feels like this\noverabundance of um\nfake positivity and i see it a lot and\nalso in people that like\nwe're gonna manifest this and while\nthat's all great you also have to\nremember like that\nlife throws things at us and we have to\nbe prepared to deal with those things\nwhen we\nwhen we don't get what we manifested\nright and i feel like\nsetting up a community by telling them\nthat you love them\nand then that and that they are your\nbest\nfriends i think it's unfair to those\npeople\nbut it's well i i think the real\nchallenge there is that for some\nstreamers they\nreally do feel that way\nright so i think that a lot of streamers\nare lonely\nand that some of the best connections\nthat they do feel\nare like with their chat yeah\nand i think that there's a lot of\nbecause you know i'm not trying to\ni recognize i'm sort of disagreeing i\nagree that it's unhealthy but\nbut i think that like we have to\nunderstand that\nreal-life relationships are complicated\nand part of what's happening\nand and part of what's nice about like\nyou know these relationships that you\nhave with people online is it's like\nit it can be so much more simple\nyeah much cleaner so much more fun\n[Laughter]\nyeah none of the baggage you're right\nit's like i'm gonna we're just gonna\nhang out and chat we're gonna be vibing\nand then there's something\nin your brain that's like why would i\nwant to hang out with real people who\nare just so\nfilled with drama when i can just be\nvibing with twitch chat and that's just\nlike\ni feel it i absolutely feel it right\nyeah\nso yeah i think our brain gets confused\nyeah or that the signals mean different\nthings now\nright and and it's hard because like if\nyou really think about it i mean a lot\nof like you know a lot of\nonline support can be so\num i mean i i see this a lot\ni i suspect that a lot of that streaming\nactually\ncultivates almost a particular kind of\nlike mental illness called borderline\npersonality disorder\nwhere like like this is uh this is a\nkind of\nillness where i mean it's not it's an\nillness we call it that but\nit's something where like your sense of\nworth is determined by the way that\nyou're treated that's basically the way\nthat i kind of think about it\nand so i think that when our brains are\nexposed to\na lot of judgment that's how people sort\nof get borderline personality disorder\nthey sort of like get traumatized or\nabandoned early in life\nand then i think like essentially what\nthe internet does is like cultivates\nthat same kind of growth\nbecause we get exposed to so much\njudgment and the interesting thing is\nthat if you have that vulnerability\na lot of times people with bpd feel\nreally good about themselves when people\ntreat them well\nand so now you suddenly have this source\nof like you can\nyou know call to the\ninternet and the internet will answer\nyour call\nand shower you with love and support\nand and we'll say like no you are\nwonderful like we do love you you're\nfantastic\nand if you have that kind of emotional\nneed\nand you become like you know you can\nkind of tap into it and i don't really\nblame the people because it's like it's\ntheir brain right they're like\nthey're looking to feel a certain way\nand the internet can help them feel that\nway\nso i think it's going to get in a sense\nworse but i also think that there\nare certain things that we're gonna have\nto do like we're gonna have to evolve as\nhumans\nto deal with this um and this is where\nyou know personally i'd like to spend\nmore time with people who are\non the other side of the social\nrelationship\nyeah right like talk to people and be\nlike you know how does it feel and then\nlike hopefully through that\nas many people listen they'll be like oh\ncrap\nthat sounds like me like i do that too\nand then\nwe'll sort of start to understand and\nlike hopefully help those people because\ni i don't in a sense like\ni blame them kind of if they violate\nboundaries and don't respect things like\ni think that's you know you should be\nheld accountable for your actions\nbut also as someone who has you know\nworked in prisons and stuff like that i\ni've i've come to appreciate that\nyou know the psychological drives that\ncause us to do\nbad things probably can\nbe helped in some way so like i'm all\nfor like punishing a crime but at the\nsame time like rehabilitating the\ncriminal\nabsolutely absolutely um\nso you're calling twitch you're calling\nchat criminals\ni'm\ni'm sorry to ruin a good moment but i\njust i couldn't let that joke\ngo somebody else was gonna do it if i\ndidn't do it\ni think i think there are a lot of\nthings but i don't think criminal is one\nof them no no no i'm joking i'm joking\ni'm just joking\nyou have to have some humor in there but\nyeah it's fast it's really fascinating\nyeah i mean i i was about to ask you you\nknow if there's someone in your\ncommunity\nyeah but i don't think we should do that\nbut you know i think like\nlike in general we should think about\nhaving people who\nare on the other side of a parasocial\nrelationship like\nyou know we've done that a little bit on\nstream i think it's something we could\ndo more\nbut i think we have to understand like\nwhat's going on in these people's heads\nlike\nprobably explain to them i mean explain\nmakes it sound like you know we have all\nthe answers but\ni think kind of try to figure out like\nwe because we have to do something\nand so the la i guess so there's a\nsystems perspective right where you can\nsort of\nequip tools and things like that um\nbut there's also i think like a very\nhuman component to it that we have to\nexplore\nthat's just the lens that i look at\nyeah i mean i think it'd be cool in the\nfuture um\nto see if anybody from my community\nwould be open to talking about that\nas well i think that obvious not i think\nwe all have been able to observe that\nthe pandemic has only made things worse\nbecause it's forced us\ninside and for some of us that are\nalready maybe more introverted\nmyself included i mean i'm i'm i'm\ni'm somewhere in the middle like i have\nno problem being\nalone you know um\nbut for this period of time it's a\ndifferent story so\nwe've all been feeling that isolation\neven if we do have\nfamily you know even if we do have\na support system but\nit's it's really fascinating and i feel\nlike now though\num personally\nbetween myself and my mods we've\nwe've sort of been able to now identify\nlike red flags\num it took a while it took a while like\nlonger than you would probably think but\ni\ni also i know part of that is that we've\nbeen we've tried to be very\ngentle with people to understand that\nmaybe somebody is\nsuffering from mental health issues or\nthings like this so we want to tread\nlightly and be careful but\nnow we've sort of been able to identify\ncertain behaviors where\nwe understand that it's easier to cut it\noff\nright when you see it happening uh i\nmean i i think it could be very\neducational if you would share with us\nwhat those red flags might be but at the\nsame time\ni feel like that could be a mistake in\nsome way it i can tell you something\nbecause it's going to be very sort of\nvague anyways which is\num there's just certain\nit's very instinctual but there's\ncertain like\nways of writing or patterns that you\nstart to pick up on and you'll see\nthings and say well that kind of reminds\nme of this other problem we had and we\nlet that problem extend\nso let's not even\ngive it a chance to grow let's just cut\nit off so\nthat's very vague i know it's not like a\nclear example of\nof what we've dealt with but um there's\njust certain behaviors and patterns that\nwe\ntend to pick up on now yeah so i'm\nall saying i'll say it like if i see\nsomething like we have a\nyou know a way to communicate between us\nit's like uh let's just\nlike let's just flag this or\nor another mod we'll say like we're\nflagging this\ninternally and if anything else happens\nthen we're just gonna\nban yeah\nso i'm i'm hearing that you know\nsubconsciously your brain has done some\npattern recognition\nyeah right so you guys have seen enough\nof it where to where you know sort of\nlike\nwhat it looks like what it smells like\nkind of like you know you can sniff it\nout now\num yeah so i think that there's a lot of\nroom for research like i think it would\nbe really cool to actually do a study\nwhere we asked streamers\nlike we could probably like you know put\nassemble\nlike common red flags we could also do a\nstudy\non um actually i i think we should i\nthink it'd be very cool to do a study on\npeople who are on\nyou know the the chatting end of the\nparasocial relationship and like you\nknow do a qualitative research study\nwhere you take 30 people\nyou ask them what is this experience\nlike for you like how do you feel where\ndoes it come from\nyou know things like that um you can\nalso like we discovered all kinds of\ninteresting things\nuh we're hopefully publishing a paper on\nincel\nsoon um starting to do a paper\nhopefully on i think we've got a we've\ngot a project in the works on\npornography addiction and i think\nespecially in the pornography addiction\nvery\nsome very surprising results in terms of\nlike things that you would not expect\nlike really simple things like being\nexposed to pornography\nat a very young age\nfrom the consumer perspective yeah yeah\nso\nso like you know you'll have like\neight-year-olds who are shown\npornography and that's even before\nthey've started to like\nexperience like you know that they\nhaven't they're nowhere near puberty\nand yeah but it does something in the\nbrain\nand also that pornography addiction\ndoesn't seem to have really much to do\nwith being\nyou know sexually attracted to anything\nit really seems to be more of a\nshortcut to like a dopamine release in\nthe brain\nand like emotional suppression so\nthere's a lot of assumptions that\npornography and perversion in some way\nare like related but\nit appears that for pornography it's\nit's not the same\num so i can confirm huh\ncan confirm\ni don't quite know what you mean by that\nbut okay\nyeah i'm i'm also sort of a perv but\nlike\nin a healthy way okay yeah well so my\npoint is that\nyou know i think perversion is a whole\nseparate thing it's just that people\nyeah expected these things to be\nassociated exactly\nand they don't they aren't necessarily\num and with parasocial relationships i\nimagine if we spent the time like\nlooking we could start to figure out you\nknow what's going on here\nbut yeah that's sorry you got me\nspilling\nfor a second no it's really cool i mean\ni wanted to ask you these things and i\nknow a lot of people\num a lot of people wanted to hear about\nthis\ni think it was very insightful and\nhopefully helpful for some people as\nwell\nnow i know i offered you a 15 to 30\nminute spiel on why you procrastinate\nand how to fix it do you still want that\nif you're down yes um i would have to go\nto the bathroom really quickly though go\nfor it cool okay\nall right let's do it let me figure it\nout\nokay\ni was just in teaching mode\nand so you know once i get started\nit's hard to stop me and i'm sure that\nthat was a funny joke\nbut my mind was not able to once i get\ninto teaching mode\nthere's so little i understand about\ninnuendo\nso ready to get started yeah\nokay so the first thing uh sasha is i i\nwant to explain to you\na little bit about traditional indian\nmedicine or ayurveda\nso before i went to medical school you\nsound familiar are you familiar with\nthat or\nnow okay that's what you asked me\nearlier yeah\nokay okay yes i don't know a lot about\nit but\nokay um it was the way you pronounce it\ni\ni obviously butcher it and so\nyeah sometimes people people will\npronounce it ayurveda\nyes so um what i'm gonna try to do real\nquick\nis okay yeah i'm just getting prepped\nokay so the first thing is that\nnot everyone's mind is the same\ni know it sounds obvious but like you\nknow how like some people have\nwhat we call fast metabolisms and they\ncan eat whatever they want to and not\nput on a whole bunch of weight\nand then other people are big boned\nright\nand they're people who can eat salads\nall day and they'll still be like\nyou know above average in terms of\nweight and the other interesting thing\nis that like obviously there are these\nclasses of people that may have\nsomething of a oh one second\ni was on the wrong way up um so there\nare these different classes of people\nright so like and it may run in families\nbut there are people from like africa\nthat have fast metabolisms\nand people completely unrelated from\nlike croatia that have fast metabolisms\nso this is a variance within the\npopulation of the human species\nyeah turns out that fast metabolism\npeople and big bone people actually\nshare particular genes so they're\nactually like these different classes of\npeople so\na couple thousand years ago in ancient\nindia there were a group of\ndoctors ayurvedic doctors who sort of\nnoticed that human beings have like\nthese shared\nqualities and and so\nwhat they decided is like in order to\nunderstand them because they couldn't\nyou know do a genetic analysis back then\nthey started using elements\nto explain like these attributes of\npeople\nso what they said is that there are some\npeople who are like the wind and these\npeople are vata so they are they tend to\nbe prone to things like dry skin\nthey tend to be prone to things like\nallergies they tend to have fast\nmetabolisms\nthey also tend to have eyes that are\nbigger than their stomach\nwhich means that they feel very very\nhungry but then actually don't need to\neat a whole lot of food\nthey also notice cognitive correlations\nthat these people have so that they get\ninterested in things very easily but get\nbored and things very easily\nthat these people tend to be quick\nstudies but\nalso forget if they don't get like you\nknow\nrepeated like they learn easy to forget\nokay right and so then so they came up\nand they said like oh this person is\nlike the wind\nokay and then they also like notice that\nthere are other people so some people\nare more argumentative\nthey're more driven they're\nmedium-bodied they tend to have certain\nphysical problems with like\nindigestion the back teeth their back\nteeth tend to be quite yellow\nall kinds of interesting correlations\nthat they made\nand then the third type is like the\nearth type so these people tend to be\nbig boned\nthey tend to be like slow to learn but\nslow to forget\nthey tend to be quite resilient and can\ntolerate\npunishing situations for long periods of\ntime\nbut are also slow to like get out of bad\nsituations so they'll like\nstay in unhealthy relationships for\nprolonged periods of time\nwhereas the vata folks the wind folks\nwill be like yeah i'm into this person\nand yeah i'm not into that person\nanymore\nand so what they noticed were that these\nthese sort of elemental forces and if\nyou look at any human being you can kind\nof rank\ntheir their wind their fire and their\nearth\nand so some people may have a dominant\nfire some people may have like a\ndominant wind and fire\nsome people may have you know any\ncombination\nand that disease essentially manifests\nfrom your levels getting too high or too\nlow\nso like people who have a high amount of\nvata\nif their vata increases a little bit\nmore they will have things like\nallergies\nthey'll have things like adhd they'll\nhave things like anxiety\nthey'll have insomnia but not the kind\nwhere it's hard to fall asleep\nthe kind where it's hard to stay asleep\nor they have interrupted sleep\nthat vatas have dreams of flying for\nexample there are all kinds of weird\ncorrelations do you have dreams of\nflying oh yeah\nokay oh yeah so you are you\nare sasha my friend a textbook vata and\na lot of what you describe\nas procrastination is a manifestation of\nyour vata mind\nyou talked so many times about not being\na nine to fiver\nvatas hate the nine to five they can't\ndo the nine to five\nit's just not how their mind is you can\nwork\nfrom midnight till midnight\none day a week but you would rather do\nthat\nthan nine to five five days a week like\nthat's so that's just the vata mindset\nright so it's like it's like you so you\nhave to think about yourself like the\nwind and the wind blows really hard in\none direction\nand then stops and blows this way\nand then that way right so the first\nthing to understand\nis that you have avata mind so your\ntemperament\nis going to be a little bit more\nprocrastination oriented because\nvatas also thrive with crises and\ndeadlines\nthey they do their best work their mind\nis sort of like\neh i can't get excited about that oh\n[ __ ] it's happening tomorrow let's go\nright like yes so so the vata mind is\ngoing to be prone to what we\ncall quote-unquote procrastination but i\ndon't think that's really the right way\nto think about it i think the reason we\ncall it procrastination\nis because our society is structured\nfor bitters and kaphas for the most part\nso like if we think about like you know\nthe nine to five like where does that\ncome from it's because\nbit those which tend to be good managers\nby the way vatas are like very difficult\nas managers because they're all over the\nplace so fitness are really good the\nfire types are really good at imposing\norganization and structure\nso like the people who like being like\nthe manager tend to be like a little bit\nmore bitter or kapha oriented\nand so they created a system that worked\nfor them and then we pushed all the\nvatas into the system\nso school is another good example of\nlike it's eight to three and like that's\nthe way it should be whereas there's\nactually\noverwhelming evidence that starting\nschool at eight o'clock is actually bad\nfor learning and bad for kids\nyeah there's no need to study for that\nmany hours a day\nso anyway coming back to you so i think\nthe first thing to understand is that\nif you want to quote unquote\nprocrastinate less\nyou should balance your vata the more\nyour wind element\nraises the more procrastination prone\nyou will become\nand by procrastination prone i mean that\nthere will be times of your life where\nyour mind is prone to wander\nand like it can't sit still right so\nlike you can\neat certain things that will help your\nmind like be\ncalmer and more grounded like your\nprocrastination is going to be\ninversely proportional to the degree\nthat you're grounded\nokay that's the first thing so like you\ncan sort of\nyou know yeah so that's vata okay\nso a couple of solutions there one is\nyou can lower your vata you can be more\ngrounded but the other thing to\nrecognize\nis that your mind is going to optimally\nfunction when you're juggling a few\ndifferent things\nthat's just how it works okay so now\nlet's get to\num a little bit more on you\nso the first thing to understand about\nprocrastination is that it's the vata\nmindset okay we're gonna leave the\nayurveda stuff\nover here for now um and so we can talk\nabout balancing your your vata and stuff\nlike that but then\nwhen we think about procrastination you\nhad started sasha i believe with\nit's some kind of fear of success right\nthat's what i've heard a lot of people\nsay and that's something that\npersonally i cannot identify with so\nuh and this is i've read the alchemist\nokay um what do you why do you think you\nprocrastinate\nuh when he asked me that earlier it took\nme a minute but then i i went back to\num it came to me which is i feel like i\nam\ni get overwhelmed and so it's hard for\nme\nto be decisive um\nand figure out what is the most\nimportant task at hand\nokay so so here are a couple of things\nso like we talked about before i think a\nbig solution to your\nprocrastination if you're overwhelmed\nand having trouble\nprioritizing you've already lost the\nbattle\nbecause the problem is how stuff gets on\nyour plate\nright right right so this is where um\nyou know we're not gonna i'm just gonna\noffer a couple of hypotheses\nthese could be right these could be\nwrong but i think that\nthere's a certain desperation that you\nhave because i\ni'm gonna sort of like analyze you a\nlittle bit here okay so this is\nsomething you should definitely talk to\nwith talk through with a therapist if\nyou feel like this resonates with you\nbut what i'm getting the sense of is\nbecause of something about your\nbackground and because you're walking a\ntightrope\ni feel like that emotional feeling of\nwalking a tightrope\ndoesn't allow you to pass on\nopportunities\nright because you feel like i have to\ngrow i have to adapt i have to stay up\nwith the trends\num we don't really need to go into that\nmy point is that in terms of like\nnot fearing it's a fear of success like\nyou\nand this will become clear in a second i\ndon't think yours is a fear of success\nwhat i get from you is more of like\na desperation of like being on the\ntightrope and\nlike you don't have a choice does that\nsort of make sense\nit does the thing that i'll oh slightly\ndisagree with there\nis that like um not being able to say no\nbecause i've actually been very aware of\nthat over the past i would say like\nfour or five years and it's something\ni've really worked on and\nlearning to say no okay so\nbut that being said what you're saying\nis all the other things i am still\nputting on my plate\nright so i'm still putting this and one\nlast thing before i forget\nbut you i just want to say it and then\nwe can go back to time management\nand then we can circle back to that\nthough yeah so so this is where i'd say\nthat you know if you've learned how to\nsay\nno and you still wind up with too many\nthings on your plate\nhow does that happen right because i\nthink that it's not about saying\ni don't know it still feels to me like\nthere's an emotional driver which\nis determining how much stuff ends up on\nyour plate in the first place\nright so like i i maybe it's not\nemotional but i would explore that so\nlike let's just put emotional driver we\ndon't need to go there\nright now okay so now i'm going to talk\nmore generally so i tend to think about\nprocrastination like a couple different\nkinds of procrastination okay\nso the first is what i would call\nidealistic procrastination\nso what this means is that some people\ndon't act because they're not ready\nso like for example if i want to apply\nfor a job\nand i procrastinate on applying for a\njob the reason that i'm procrastinating\nbecause i want to wait until my resume\nis good like i need to revise my resume\nlike i can send\na crappy resume today or i can send the\nperfect resume tomorrow\nso i'm not going to apply for a job\nuntil everything is ideal\nyes right so like this is where like you\nhave this\nyou have this idea in your mind of\nhow this task should be executed yes\nright\nidea or even fantasy of execution\nyes i can relate to that and that's\nsomething that i've also\nbeen working on is\nis letting go of certain things and\nunderstanding that\nlike nothing can always be perfect\nyeah so like like it's the chase for\nperfection that keeps people paralyzed\nin the moment\nmm-hmm right like i know it sounds kind\nof weird but like sometimes you know\nsometimes i'll it almost feels to be\nlike you take a 100\nchance at an f as opposed to a 20 chance\nat an a\nand it's like people people are like\nyeah i'd rather like i want to do it\nperfectly or\nnot at all and that's where you know\nbecause you have this idea of like what\nyou want it to look like\nwhat it'll accomplish like i'm going to\ndo such a like it's going to be so\ngreat when i do it but i haven't\nset that circumstance up so i'm just not\ngoing to do it\nor haven't been good with time\nmanagement to allow yourself\nto be prepared we'll get to time\nmanagement later okay\nso idealistic procrastination is\nsomething that i i kind of think\nof is like it this is a little bit\npsychological it's cognitive\nright and it's actually like attachment\nbased\nand what i mean by that is we're\nattached to a particular\noutcome so like we're attached to it\nbeing a certain way like\nlike my favorite example is one that i i\nhave in my head all the time\ni will start going to the gym once i'm a\nlittle bit in shape\nbecause oh god yeah right yeah and so if\nyou kind of think about it it's\nthe attachment to like not wanting to\nlook\nout of shape when you go to the gym that\nkeeps you from going to the gym\nso oddly enough the solution here is a\nlittle bit more like\ngrief like you got to just let that go\nand like learn to take an l\nyeah right you gotta just be like you\nknow what it's gonna suck\nyep um or al i guess\nso so that's where where i i would say\nlike so this is different\nbecause it's not really emotional it's\nlike i want this thing to happen\nperfectly and you have to let go of like\nyou have to grieve that perfect outcome\nto be able to move forward\nyeah okay so another good example is i\nhave i'm working with someone who's\ngoing to enroll in college once they get\ntheir like sleep schedule\nfixed right and so their sleep schedule\nnever gets fixed so that\nthey never go to college it's a form of\nidealistic procrastination\nso second is avoidance procrastination\nso this is closer to what the instagram\nfolks or whatever social media folks are\nsaying\nso this tends to be based in emotions\nso this is sort of like like the\navoidance procrastination is actually a\nprotective mechanism\nand what it's protecting you from is\nlike a particular emotion so for example\nlet's say i want to ask someone out but\ni'm afraid of rejection so i don't ask\nthem out\nand i tell myself i really want to ask\nhim out i really want to ask him out i\nreally want to ask him out so in a sense\nyou could call that procrastination\nbecause i never get up\noff my ass and ask someone out but what\ni'm really trying to do is like\navoid the emotional possibility of\nrejection\nyeah so sometimes when i talk to people\nwho want to you know find a job\nlike they feel stupid going in\nand like asking for um\nthey feel stupid like going in and like\nasking for a job application they don't\nneed to feel stupid but they just do\nso a lot of times like how do you tell\nif you have avoidance procrastination\nif people use umbrella terms like if\nthey call themselves bad\nlazy stupid or incompetent and that's\nthe reason they're procrastinating\nthat is likely to be an avoidance\nprocrastination the things that\navoided procrastinators tell themselves\nis usually diagnosing them within\nthemselves with an unfixable problem\nlike\ni'm lazy that's why i procrastinate and\nlike laziness is like it's an attribute\nof who you\nare there's nothing to do about it\nthere's there's no\nyou know it's kind of just like so like\noh i you\ndrew the short straw you're lazy in life\nsucks to be you\nyou know it sort of doesn't you can't do\nanything about it\num does that make sense yes so\nthe other thing that that these people\ntend to do is rational\na lot of rational justifications\nso they'll give themselves lots of\nreasons why they're not doing something\nbut at the end of the day it's usually\nemotional oh\nyou know like and it may even look like\nidealistic procrastination it's sort of\nlike\nyeah i'll ask this person out once i get\nin shape and sure that's like there's an\nidealistic component to it but it's\nreally\nwhat's really driving that is like the\nfear of like being rejected\nand what they're trying to do is like\ncontrol circumstances so that they can\navoid emotions\nthis is another sign right yeah\nand this is where like like asking\nsomeone out i'm gonna wait till i'm sure\nthey're in love with me before i even\nask them out\nbecause i'm afraid of the rejection yeah\nand maybe there's fear of success in\nyour case there may be an emotional\ndriver which could be like avoidance\nprocrastination\ni don't really think that's the case\nwith you i'll we'll get back to you in a\nsecond\num and then the third\noh this may be you sasha operational\nprocrastination\nokay\nthis is more frontal but\nwhat i mean is frontal lobe sorry so i\nwas just gonna ask do you mean frontal\nlobe okay\nyeah okay so this is where like so vatas\ntend to be prone to this type\nbecause frontal lobe problems also\nmanifest as like anxiety and adhd\nso like this is kind of like an adhd\nprocrastination\ntends to be falls under this category\nbut what i would say is um\nso this is the kind where like so i have\na three-year-old and i have a\nfive-year-old\nand if i tell the five-year-old to clean\nclean up their room\nthey're able to do that but if i tell\nthe three-year-old to clean your room\nshe's not really able to do that does\nthat make sense\nyeah what's the difference between the\nthree-year-old and five-year-old why can\nthe five-year-old clean their room but\nthe three-year-old can't\nthat's i would say the age is the first\nthing i think of like a five-year-old is\na little bit more independent\nthey can safe you know they can focus\nfor longer periods of time\ncompared to a toddler who's just only\nbeen walking for a while and\nis still pretty dependent on parents\nyeah so if we look at like\nwhat the age means right what's the\ndifference between a three-year-old's\nbrain and a five-year-old's brain\nyou've sussed it out instinctively\nperfectly right so that\nthe five-year-old can kind of stay\nfocused but if you really think about it\nwhat stay focused\nmeans is actually breaking down the task\ninto its component parts so this is\nwhere like people feel\noverwhelmed if they're operational\nprocrastinators\nand what that means is like the\nfive-year-old understands that cleaning\nthe room is putting away the toys\nputting away the books and putting away\nmy stuffed animals i can tell the\nthree-year-old\nput away your stuffed animals and she\ncan understand that\nbut she's not able to take the abstract\nof cleaning the room\nand breaking it down into its component\npieces\nand so when she looks at the dirty room\nher mind is\noverwhelmed with like how do i break\ndown this task and execute on it\ndoes that make sense yes absolutely\nso like when we think about something\nlike um and this is also like a problem\nin gamers too so gamers are prone to\nthis\nbecause video games operationalize stuff\nfor us\nright okay here's the quest go collect\neight of these things\nthen go here then go here then go here\nthen go here\nso we're not really taught how to like\nabstract out things from start to finish\neven our sandbox games basically like\nteach us how to play in the sandbox\nright it's not truly free form\nso when you take gamers and you tell\nthem to go find a job there are actually\na thousand small tasks\nbut the our minds actually are not like\nnatural at breaking up those tasks so\nfinding a job\nfeels overwhelming because we don't know\nhow to break it down into its component\nparts\nso does that sound like that describes\nyou\nyeah definitely and i\nyeah go ahead and i feel like i i do\nbetter\nwhen um\ni waver a lot so like i'll have really\ndisciplined\nstints where i have lists and i have\nchecklists\nand sub checklists and i got like the\nstuff that is for\nme uh in my personal life just like\nrandom stuff that has to be done and\nthen the stuff that i want to do\nprofessionally creatively\nand then i'll fall off yeah so that's it\nokay that's where i mean i'd say that\nthat sounds very about that of me so\nhere's what i'd suggest for you\nokay the first is that like you know\nmaybe there's some weird emotional [ __ ]\nin there\nwho knows if it's not what floats your\nboat no big deal\nsorry i i'm i'm done with the ipad part\nuh i'm yeah i'm just a senior sorry\nyeah it's okay um so here's what i'd say\nsasha for you\nif you procrastinate like the first\nthing to understand is that you're gonna\nbe the most successful\nwhen you have external prompts so you're\ngonna respond well to crises and\ndeadlines\nthe next thing to understand is that\nprocrastination is not a problem\nprocrastination is actually a solution\nso if our brain so this is like\nliterally what happens our brain has\nthis circuit\nthat tries to figure out how to be\nefficient and so what\nyour brain tells you when you're in like\nlet's say you're in school and it's like\ni could start studying today and i can\nget an a and i can study one hour a day\nfor 30 days\nbut our brain is actually like you know\nwhat we can get a b if you just cram the\nnight before\nand so if you actually think about an\nenergy investment doing things perfectly\nis not efficient it's actually\nvery inefficient because why would i\nwant to study 30 hours for an a when i\ncan squeak by with a b with six\nlike why would i do that so\nin your case i'd say be careful about\nwhy things get on your plate is number\none\nsee if there's some kind of desperation\nthere's some kind of like\nbecause we see this a lot with streamers\nwhere like you feel like you you know\nyou can't\nafford to pass sounds like you've\nlearned how to say no\nsecond thing to think about in terms of\nyour procrastination is what i would do\nis pick like three or four things and\nrotate between them\nso what you'll find is that the way for\nyou to work 80 hours a week\nis to have four different projects that\nwork 20 hours that you need 20 hours a\nweek\nif you devote yourself to one project\nfor 40 hours a week\nyou will do a worse job than four\nprojects\nat 20 hours a week even though\ntechnically you're working half as much\nin one scenario it's just gonna not\nbring\nout the like the interest\nright like when you get excited about\nsomething well i also like\nmy mind immediately goes to\nwhen you know you should stop working on\nsomething because your brain and body\nare tired but you\npush through because you just want to\nfinish and get it over with and then you\nmake mistakes\nthat then add hours to having to finish\nthat\nthat's where that is so so i think your\nproblem with sasha you don't need to\nmotivate\nyourself to work so people who have a\nproblem with procrastination think that\ni need to motivate myself\nwhen i don't feel like working right\nit's actually the exact opposite you\nneed to demotivate yourself\nat the right times and then your\nprocrastination will get way better\nyou need to restrain your motive it's\ntwo sides of the same coin\nyou need to restrain your motivation\nwhen you get excited\nwhen it's time to stop you need to\nrestrain yourself\nand stop so procrastination in your\nin your case i don't think is like it's\nnot about a lack of motivation it's\nactually about a lack of restraint\nand i think that as you have fewer\nthings\nlike because like you said okay i want\nto finish it now i made a bunch of\nmistakes so the next day your to-do list\nhas been inflated\nwith stuff that should have never like\nit would have been easier to just stop\nand finish it today\nyeah right and and so like i would i\nreally reign in your vata and then\nalso try to cultivate kind of a system\naround it which is like\nyou know get other people to like be\nbeholden to other people and you'll do a\ngood job\nyeah because left to your own devices\nit's going to be a mess\nlet other people like you know\nmy team is really good about like\nforcing me into meetings they just throw\nsomething on my calendar because they've\nlearned\nunfortunately that if they like ask me\nto do something it's never gonna happen\nif they're just like\nhey i need you to show up at this time\nand it feels weird because\ni outrank them in some way but they have\nto give me orders and we figured out\nthat that's what works best\nyeah um i don't know if that was helpful\nfor not but that's my spiel\nyeah it is helpful it's interesting and\ni was just\nhelpful for people watching too um\ni wanted to figure out a way to pose\nthis but like i don't know\nit's coming out more as a statement so i\ndon't want to say it like\nsense but i kind of go i'm go my mind\nkeeps going back to that question that\nwas posed earlier\nwhich was like let me just bring it up\nbecause i don't i don't want to\nparaphrase\nit one second\nokay so the the actual question was how\nlong should breaks actually be\nand how long should you work before\ntaking them so i mean i\nthat's kind of that's a little bit broad\nbecause that can mean like\nin a work day or that could mean always\nyou know\num so yeah so that depends on your\nayurvedic dosha so this is the problem\nwith questions that people ask\nlike like western science is about on\naverage what works for the most number\nof people\nso when the fda comes up with a 2 000\ncalorie a day recommendation\nthat's not going to work as well for the\nfast metabolism people versus the big\nbone people\nso when should you take breaks so what\ni'll literally do when i do like\ncorporate consulting is we'll do\nayurvedic analyses of everyone's doshas\nand then what we'll do is i'll tell them\nlike if you're avata you should take\nfrequent short breaks you should plan on\nworking four\ntwo hour blocks in the day start early\nstart at six a.m try to finish like as\nearly as possible\nso like vata's also come online fast and\nrun out of stamina fast\nso how often should you take breaks you\nshould take them frequently because\nyou're prone to burnout like if you push\nyourself\nyou're going to pay for it the next day\nso you need like pre-emptive breaks\nif you're a bitter leaving tasks undone\nis going to be very infuriating\nso you've got to like push through like\nwork like pithas are decent nine to\nfivers\nand and if you're kapha if you're like\nthe earth element like you probably need\nyou can go a longer time without a break\nbut then you probably need a long break\nwhen it's time for a break so as avata\nwhen i go on a 10-day vacation\ni've i've i'm done relaxing on day five\nand i'm like i'm gonna do some work now\nyeah so like the vata is like but a boy\nlike i need three day weekends\nevery week because on day four i'm like\noh my god i've worked so\nlong on tuesday morning it's like oh\nwhen is the weekend\nyou know yeah and then by like by sunday\nmorning if i like don't work on friday\nby sunday morning i'm like let me get\nback to work\nlet's go you know so yeah frequent\nbreaks that are shorter for vatas\nyou know medium length breaks at decent\nintervals nine to five\nevenings off and then for kapha's like\nyou can work seven days\nten days go for it and then take like\nfour days off\nyou know it sort of depends that's what\ni'd say yeah\nand then a question that i have that\nkind of ties into all this is\num i kind of started to mention it but\ni feel like i'm really um\nlike i go through these moments like i\nsaid where when i'm really disciplined\nwith like\nlet's say it's a list for example and\nthese are the things that need to be\naccomplished\nthese are the things that i just want to\naccomplish\num when i'm really proactive at staying\non top of that\nand i can actually see like things being\ncrossed out\ndone done done it makes me feel good so\nit motivates me to continue\nand then something will happen like a\ndisrupter in life will happen\nit is so hard for me to pick\nback up where i left off so that\ndisruptor is a separate conversation so\nthis goes to\nokay so let's just analyze that in two\nways the first is\nyou gotta be careful about the\nmotivation of checking something off\nbecause when you check something off\nwhat do you feel like doing\nit depends but usually like it i want to\nkeep going\nso what's your problem you need to learn\nhow to restrain yourself\nbecause like you're like yeah let's keep\ngoing let's go let's go\nyeah and then you may run out of steam\nbefore you realize it so i'd say really\nbe careful\nwhen you check when you're done with\nyour work for the day sasha you have to\nlearn how to restrain yourself and be\ndone with the work for the day\ndon't keep on adding on work that's why\nyour plate is so terrible\nyes it's restrained your problem is like\nyou're so motivated that you take on new\nprojects and then you're overwhelmed\nand then i'm like or like then the next\nday i'm exhausted\nand then it's hard for me to get the day\nstarted so this is where you got to be\ncareful because you say something throws\nme off\nbut the question is what is the\nstat yeah hey we have a meeting oh [ __ ]\nsorry\nwe have a meeting i thought it was a\nfour ah okay\ni'll just finish this up and then then\num i gotta apparently i have a meeting\ncase in point see i didn't restrain\nmyself we were supposed to we were\nsupposed to stop an hour ago\nso i got excited and and so i have a\ncrisis\nand deadline that comes and like\nrestrains me\nperfect this is great yeah exactly so\ni'll i'll just\nillustrate this like so i'd be careful\nabout your motivation and what you tack\non because then you say when something\nthrows you off\nwhat you know how is your reserve energy\nwhen that disrupter comes\nbecause if you were overly motivated\nyesterday it's going to be\neasier to get thrown off and then what\nhappens is we look at the disrupter\nbut we don't like we look at the wave\nthat knocked us off but we don't look at\nthe health of our boat\nyeah so what you really need to focus on\nis like you know having a steady boat\nrestraining yourself and then you'll be\nmore resilient against disruptions that\nbeing said\nyou know disruptions are absolutely\nthing and sometimes you can have a great\nboat and you can still have\nyou know a tsunami and you'll you know\nit's over but\nanyway does that make sense yes\ndefinitely\nokay yeah so restrain yourself do less\nnot more\nand that goes yeah this i'll have to\ncontinue with chat\ntoo but like that i think goes back into\ntime management\nmy lack of it my lack of it i have to go\nnow\nbecause i've done a bad job at time\nmanagement\nand so the way that i stay successful is\nby having\ncrises okay she's yeah sorry sasha we\ngotta\nyou gotta feel it okay all right thank\nyou\noh man okay okay bye yeah\nbye boy that ended abruptly let's rate\nsomeone we're gonna is iping tai chi we\ngotta go\ngotta go chat gotta go let's go do some\ntai chi calm down\ni gotta run chat love you guys"
