    "transcript": "i i want to stop caring i just feel like\nif i start caring about someone\neventually i will make a little mistake\nand i won't be calm until i resolve it\nthe thoughts will haunt me constantly\nthrough the day\nand i try to let them pass during the\nday and feel them at night\ni'm becoming better at dealing with them\nit's just that\neventually the aggro will take all my hp\ni'm just tired of overthinking\neverything\nso this is a great\npost um let me\nshow you guys something real quick so i\nthink that this is i'm gonna give you\nguys kind of a quick summary\nof um\nso we have a we have a video about this\non the dr case guides\nin the anxiety module about thought\nloops so i think this is like we're\ngoing to kind of cover this real quick\nokay\nso there are a few issues here when you\nguys\nyou start caring about someone and then\ntheir opinion matters to you\nand then you'll make a little mistake\nand then your mind will enter a thought\nloop\nright like where you like you try to\npush it away and it doesn't work\num and then like oh let me see if i can\nfind so this is good hold on\nsee nope yeah it's not going to be clear\nhere but\nokay so if you guys have this problem\nwhere you like start caring about\nsomeone and then you make a little\nmistake and then you're like\nyou have to fix it and like your anxiety\ndrives you right like you're anxious and\nyou're like oh i have to fix it like\nwhat if they think this what if they\nthink this what if they think this\nand then this is good so i try to let\nthem pass during the day and feel them\nat night that's one step in the right\ndirection i'm becoming better at dealing\nwith them that's also fantastic\num it's just i'm just tired of\noverthinking everything\nabsolutely man so then the question\nbecomes\nwhat do we what do we do about this okay\nso the first thing to understand is that\nyour the obsession of your thoughts has\nto do with something called\nraag which is like attachment or\nattraction\nand so gaining distance from your\nthoughts is difficult but that's where\nvairagya comes in so vairagi is the\nprocess of developing detachment\nand then like this is the key thing i\nwon't be calm until i resolve it\nso i want you guys to think about this\nso when i\nstart caring for someone and then i make\na mistake and then i think to myself i\nwon't be calm until i resolve it\nwhat happens to my anxiety when i\nresolve it\nhmm\nand what happens the next time\ni make a mistake in the conversation\nokay so this is important okay so this\nis where\nnow we go to this so it's kind of hard\nto\ndeduce here but i'm going to kind of\ngive you guys a quick spoiler\nso sometimes we try to fight it that\ndoesn't work\nand sometimes we feed it we give in to\nthe anxiety right we say oh\nyou want to do this like like do i need\nto resolve it do i need to like make\nsure that this is okay so like you bring\nyour anxieties to people\nyou resolve it and then your mind calms\nand then all that you're doing is\nactually feeding the beast of your\nanxiety\nand so the next time you make a mistake\nor your mind perceives that you make a\nmistake\nthat anxiety is actually hungry or it's\ngrown because you fed it\nand then you get into these situations\nlike this person is where they like they\ncan't stop\nthinking about it like i can't help\nmyself\nand why is that it's because this thing\nthis anxiety used to be a puppy\nand then they fed it once and it grew a\nlittle bit\nand then they entered another\nrelationship and they started caring\nand then they were like oh my god i\nmessed up let me go apologize is\neverything okay\ni'm so sorry i did this are you thinking\nabout this did i hurt your feelings i'm\nso sorry\nand that's feeding it again right so\nlike it's decompressing your anxiety by\ngiving into it\nand then it grows and it grows and it\ngrows and eventually your anxiety\nbecomes crippling\nit's this like gigantic cerberus what\nused to be a chihuahua is now this like\nthree-headed dog\nthat is hungry and like sure you can\nlike keep it at bay for a day\nbut at night it comes roaring back and\neventually it aggros on you and tears\nyou apart\napart with its three heads so what do\nyou do about it\nyou have to learn how to not give in to\nyour anxiety\nand so recognize that you can become\naddicted\nto the coping mechanism of relieving\nyour anxiety\nand the more you give in to that the\nstronger the addiction becomes\nand the more you become this insecure\npuddle\nof whatever that's constantly seeking\nreassurance\nfrom the people around you\nand it's really staggering it's crazy\nright but the things that we do to fix\nour anxiety are actually the problems\nso this is where the first thing to\nunderstand is like recognize\nwhat happens to your anxiety use your\nmind\nso when i seek reassurance what happens\nto my anxiety does it actually get\nbetter or does it get worse\nwhat happens to it next time is it a\ntemporary solution or does it actually\nweaken it\nand so then the question is how do i how\ndo i get rid of my anxiety\nwhat can i do so how did we get here how\ndid we grow the beast by feeding it\nso how do you shrink your anxiety by\nstarving it\nso the next time you feel anxiety there\nare going to be some things that are\ngoing to be overwhelming that you can't\ndo\nbut you will feel little anxieties\nthroughout the day right small comments\nbig comments\nhuge social mistake small social mistake\ntolerate the social mistake notice how\nmuch you want it\nhow much you want to give in you're like\noh my god like what do they think oh my\ngod what do they think i have to make\nsure that they're not mad at me\ni have to make sure that they're not mad\nat me\nand so notice that thing and be like oh\nwow like there's a part of me that's\nreally desperate for reassurance\nwhat does it feel like when i don't give\nin to my desperation\nit feels really bad okay what like\nnotice\nall of the feelings that you can and the\nmore that you notice things\nthe more you create distance in the\nconversation\nin your mind the more you create\nvairagya so this is important to\nunderstand\nif you're trying to overcome an emotion\nyou have to go meta with it you have to\nmove\nin a la in an axis that's like\nperpendicular\nso if i'm like having difficulty in\nsomeone like in a conversation with\nsomeone\nso let's say that someone comes into my\noffice and says to me\noh you just say that you like me because\nyou're my therapist\nand or you're my psychiatrist and like\nit's your job to like me\nand then i could say no no no i really\ndo like you and they're like no no no\nyou really don't and then like how do i\nfix that as a psychiatrist does anyone\nknow\nhow do i fix this what if i say like how\ncan i\never express authentic appreciation how\ndo i convince that person\nslap them pills you say they're right\nnope yeah so this is what you say you\nguys ready for it\nyou guys ready to level up your speech\nskill\ni'm having trouble explaining to you how\ni authentically think that you're a good\nperson\ni cannot figure out the words to signal\nto you that i actually think you're a\ngood person\nbecause what you're saying to me is like\nan irrefutable argument\nyou tell like you look at the problem\nand you rise above it\nright you say like hey i don't know how\nto convey to you that i actually do care\nabout you as a person i don't know how\nto fix that problem\nthis is the problem that i see i do care\nabout you i don't know how to convince\nthat to you\ni don't know how to convince you\nright and then they're like hmm\nyeah okay that's interesting then they\nbegin to see\nthey're like oh yeah you're right like\nyou can never convince me\nand then like then we're in this\nsituation where like then how do i\nhow do i ever let you know because i can\nnever convince you and they're like okay\nweird\nand and it's weird but if you guys want\nto watch this\nwatch the watch the um the video\nthe the interview we did with h june\nlike a week ago\nor two weeks ago so when we were talking\nwith a june you guys will notice that in\nthe first half of the video\nwe were kind of stalling okay\nand then if you guys watch that video\nhalfway through the video i do this\nthing called going meta\nand i like tell him hey man we're\nstalling here\nit's basically what i said and that's\nhow you move forward\nso with your anxiety you can create\ndistance to it right\ngoing back to anxiety like what do you\ndo you say like oh my god i feel\nanxious and desperate and i feel like i\ncan't do anything\nlike i feel like i have to get this\nreassurance from this person\nnotice that within yourself you'll\ncreate distance from it the more you\ncreate distance from it the more power\nyou'll get over it\nokay questions chatars\nyeah so i never learned going meta and\nclinical psych it's a big problem\nso i think that this is a it's kind of a\ntricky issue but like\na lot of the things that we like you\nknow that i teach are not\nfounded in clinical psychology they're\nactually founded from yoga\nin the east so they like understood the\nnature\nof how the mind works\nand so part of the reason that i think\nthat like we we take these coaches right\nand we get like\noutcomes that are not quite as good as\ntherapy but like in the same ballpark\nand remains to be seen is because we\nteach them some of these techniques that\ni think are like really really valuable\nbut what most of clinical psychology\ntraining is if you think about it\nlike if you get a phd for five years\nhow is your time spent right if you get\nlike\nlike it's like mostly theoretical so\nlike you'll do supervision and stuff\nlike that which is great\nthat's where all the real learning\nhappens but this is why like in medical\nschool you have four years of medical\nschool where you don't\nlike you learn a lot of theory and then\nyou do residency where you learn how to\nbe a doctor\num yeah\nokay\nso if you want to stop caring i'm i'm\nwith you completely\nright so this is actually it's a little\nbit click-baity if you think about it\ni want to stop caring and i'd say great\nit's not like when you when you see this\ntitle you're like oh my god don't stop\ncaring\nlive there's so much to live for but\nyeah i think you should learn how to\ntake distance\nand if you won't be calm until you\nresolve it you have to learn how to\ntolerate that calmness because here's\nthe thing that i want you guys to\nunderstand okay\nthe mind is designed to return to\nequilibrium\nit's it's a waiting game between you or\nyour anxiety\nand the most important tool at your\ndisposal is patience\nbecause i know this sounds crazy but if\nyou have like you know\nif you have let's say\nlet's say you spilled some water on your\njeans\nwhen you were 13 years old when you were\nwashing your hands\nand then when you walk in out in the\nhallway and people start laughing\nthat anxiety will not last until you're\n70.\nthe feeling of shame will not persist in\nyour brain until you're 70 years old\nit's just not how the mind works so the\nmind is designed to return to\nequilibrium\nso it's just a waiting game where the\nmore patient you can be with it the\nanxiety will naturally subside because\nthat's\nliterally what our brain is designed to\ndo i want you guys to really like\nappreciate this is really cool if you\nthink about\nepilepsy so epilepsy is when your\nbrain you know you're having seizure\nright so there's like unreal\nregulated electrical activity so how\ndoes the unregulated electrical activity\nstop\nit's because there's a hard you know\ncircuit that will like\nput the brakes on your brain and you\nreset\nso it's almost like a circuit breaker in\nyour brain where your brain and your\nbody have all of these reset mechanisms\nand so you just have to wait for that\nthat anxiety to subside\nthe same is true of joy like you know\nwinning\nfirst prize in my school writing contest\nin the fifth grade does not make me\nhappy and satisfied for the rest of my\nlife\nyou know it's just you know losing that\ngame of dota\ndoesn't make you mauled for the rest of\nyour life it just doesn't you have to\nkeep on playing dota\nto keep on getting balder and walder and\nbalder\nso recognize that what you're doing is\njust riding it out\nyou're surfing that wave and the wave\nwon't last forever\nit's gonna crash it's the nature of the\nbrain it's the nature of the mind\nso play the waiting game and every time\nyou wait it out\nthe cerberus shrinks loses a head now\nit's a two-headed cerberus then it's a\none-headed cerberus\nthen it's a great dane then it's a\ngerman shepherd\nand then eventually all the way down to\nlike a\nyou know some kind of puppy\ninfant malting\nyou"
