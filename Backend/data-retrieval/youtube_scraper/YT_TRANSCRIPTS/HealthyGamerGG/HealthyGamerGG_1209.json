    "transcript": "so overcoming an addictive behavior\novercoming sort of a toxic behavior\nis not about trying to get rid of the\nbad it's actually about getting rid of\nthe good\nit's about giving up what this thing\ndoes for you\nand that starts with actually like you\nknow it starts with insight\nand if you guys are curious the you know\ni had to change tax for a second but the\nthe goal\nof today's interview was insight not\nchange\nin insight and awareness precedes change\nso pushing someone to change when\nthey're not ready to change is never\ngoing to work\nhello not a whole lot what's up with you\na whole lot how are you congratulations\non everything that you're doing you guys\nare doing insane\noh yeah thank you very much it's been um\nhold on a second there we go\num thank you so much uh\nhow are you i'm doing really good\ni'm staying busy um\ni um can you hold on drinking water\nyeah hold on just one second i want to\nmake sure that i'm not screwing\nsomething up\nhe can text me if he needs something\nbecause he just canceled the call so i\nassumed that i fixed it\num sometimes i do that on my own and i\ndon't need someone's help to fix things\nthat guy but oftentimes i do need\npeople's help\nme too so what have what uh have you\nbeen maya\ni've been really good um i yeah i'm just\ni'm very busy\nbut it's good busy so it's fine\nwhat's the difference between good busy\nand bad busy\ni'm busy with things that i want to do\nversus\nthings that i don't want to be doing um\ni was i was always bad busy in college\nand\nsince then i've been good busy\nso i guess that's good um and what have\nyou been up to recently\nuh well i've recently founded this\nnon-profit i talked to\nkruthie about it a little bit um but\nyeah we uh i bought this property and\nhave been developing it\nto bring animals onto there we have 12\nambassadors now\nso doing a lot of husbandry doing some\ncontent curation\neducation program curation and just\nthere's a lot of stuff that goes into\nthat that i'm learning about so\nwow that's amazing can you tell me more\nabout that\nyeah um so alves is a non-profit\nuh exotic animal sanctuary and virtual\neducation\ncenter in texas i wrote up wrote out the\nbusiness plan in like\nuh december chat something like that\nlike december and it was a three-year\nplan but it's more like a three-month\nplan\nwith how fast it's been going uh i\nbought a property it's about 15 acres in\naustin and\num went and picked up ambassadors from\ncalifornia\nin april and\nwe've been making moves since then\nso the idea is rescuing exotic animals\nthat are non-releasable\nand then using them for education\nprograms uh teaching people about\nconservation using those ambassadors\nanimal ambassadors and then also having\ncontent creators come to my facility to\nmeet those animals as well\num and to learn about them and learn\nabout conservation\ncomplex audiences all that jazz oh\nthat's awesome\nthank you yeah i'm really proud of it\nwhen you say ambassador are we referring\nto\nan animal or a person an animal i see\num so yeah an ambassador is just an\nanimal in captivity that\nis used in education and is meant to\nrepresent their wild counterpart\ni see an ambassador for their species\ngot it\nand and what kind of ambassadors do you\nguys have so far\nwe have four parrots two chinchillas a\nsnake a bullfrog an emu\nand two donkeys and a chicken\nthat's awesome yeah yeah\nand jenkins become a fan favorite she's\na lot of fun\nand and so how who i mean who takes care\nof the animals\nor the ambassadors sorry uh me and then\nella i have an\non-site animal care coordinator so she\nlives there and and she does five days a\nweek\noh wow care of them and then i'm out\nthere every day as well so\nthere's just two of us right now doing\nsomething making the world a better\nplace\nyeah that is absolutely amazing maya\nyeah it's been really fun um i\nunderstand that that\nambassadors whether they be you know\nanimals or humans\ntend to be quite expensive to take care\nof\nlike they have a lot of costs associated\nwith them for sure\nyeah we just did uh initial vet\nappointments for those four pairs\nnothing wrong with them but\njust to get like a baseline and to get a\nreally thorough blood panel done\nand all that is like two grand for for\nthe four of them\num so yeah wow yeah it's expensive\nthe the general upkeep though is not so\nbad like our reptiles\none of our snake eats once every other\nweek you know it's it's really not that\nexpensive but\nthe the initial setup and and the\ninitial vet stuff is expensive my emu is\nexpensive because she keeps eating metal\num she's gotten two endoscopies in the\npast\nuh few months\nwow she ate this ring wait this ring\nhad how did you get it back\nendoscopy oh so you guys went in from\nthe mouth and pulled it out\nyeah and then she ate a few screws and a\ncouple other things\na few months later which i don't even\nknow where she found them\num in dosby number two but got them all\nout\nso she's expensive\nhave you asked her considered asking her\nwhy she keeps eating metal\nyeah she just says she likes it okay\nyou know it's interesting because\nthere's actually i've i've worked with\nwith humans\nwho eat things that they're not supposed\nto yeah well so for\ni've never had a bird that's so bad\nabout that like i had the\ni had the my ring on the ground um\nbecause i just did not expect her to\nswallow it at the time she was like\nher body was like this big she's a chick\num so\nwatching her swallow the emu i didn't\neven think it hurt the ring i didn't\neven think it would fit in her mouth\num emu's and a lot of other birds\nthey'll eat pebbles and small rocks to\naid in digestion\nthe only thing i can think is that with\na combination of her being attracted to\nshiny things\nbecause she's a bird and then i don't\nbut i also\nlike i've worked with crows and other\ncorvids and stuff like that that love\nshiny things but they would never\nswallow it i really don't know it's it's\nbizarre to me she's the first emu that\ni've worked from\nbaby onwards um so i'm\ni've learned that tendency the hard way\nyeah wow i don't think you can find this\nstuff in a book somewhere it's like\nyou know guide to emu care be careful\nbecause they will eat\nnails and small pieces of jewelry there\nis\nthe only article i could find when i was\nfreaking out the first time she ate the\nring was\nan emu in the uk that ate a pair of\ndiamond earrings or something\num and they couldn't get them out uh so\ninsurance got her a new pair of earrings\nwhich is sweet and then\nthe emu passed them later so now she has\nboth i don't know if she wears the ones\nthat the emu passed but\ni imagine that they they have a certain\nyou know\nresale value to them yeah oh i'm sure\nthey do\nthat was big news yeah wow\ninteresting yeah yeah so\nwow so you've been busy yes anything\nsort of yeah so of you are you doing\nlike interviews throughout this month\nis that just okay sweet nice\ncool stuff why do you ask i'm just\nwondering\nbecause your team reached out to me said\nthat's the first time i've got i've\nheard from you guys in that capacity so\ni was like oh i bet they're doing\na bunch of people or talking to a bunch\nof people yeah so i think actually our\nusual stream\nstuff is uh interviews is the backbone\nof what we do you know because we try to\num\nhave so i've had so many individual\nconversations that\ncover the same thing the whole reason we\nstarted streaming to begin with is to\nsort of\nuh you know share one person's\nconversation with a bunch of people\nspecifically for the purpose because i\nseem to have the same conversations over\nand over and over again and the same\nthemes\nor principles tend to pop up over and\nover and over again\nthis has to be unique in terms of\nconversations i've had on stream because\ni haven't talked about ingesting things\nbut i have worked with patients who will\ndo things like ingest razor blades and\nthere you have\ngood stuff um you know and i try to ask\nthem why they do it and\nthat turns turns out to be an\ninteresting conversation\num that's a lot yeah i don't think she\ndoes it for those reasons i think she's\njust a little dank\nbut what does that mean a little dank a\nlittle like\nbit you know it's just not very bright\noh okay\nwell you know the emote feels dank man\nhave you seen that did you chat use that\nyeah so i think i'm sure i've seen it i\ndon't know exactly what da i didn't know\nthat dank was not very bright i thought\nit was like\na little bit you know not\ndirty but it's like it's dank you know\nit's like not clean it may be used like\nthat in other places or maybe i'm\nthinking rank i don't know\num there's dank when i was in college\npeople would say dank is like that sick\nlike that's\ndank or they would like sick isn't it\nthey would say yeah good sick\nand they would say that like weed is\ndank and that meant it was good\nbut since i've been on twitch it's like\nfeels dank man so it's like uh\ni don't know just like little kid like\neating crayons\nyeah it's kind of dank so the last time\ni was a student\nwhen someone is like that's sick like\nthat person is sick we would transfer\nthem to the icu\nyou know so different things yeah so but\ndank means so dank is no longer means\nsick it means\nwhat well on twitch it means\nkind of dumb kind of got it i think\nother people still use it as like\ncool well if if it means something on\ntwitch isn't that truly what it means\nno i i don't know because it's it's so\ninteresting to see that\nyou know the the like i have you know\nnieces and nephews that are normal\npeople\nand to to realize that i actually speak\ntheir lingo because they seem to be like\ncatching up to us\noh there you go yeah right so like i\nthink like like\nsalty is from gaming right i have no\nidea\ni'm not a gamer right and and then their\ntwitch\nmaybe i don't know i think it's a gaming\nthing and then like other\nyou know regular people started using it\nand i was like oh i actually understand\nthe lingo now there you go yeah i don't\nknow any\nwell i guess i do know some gamer lingo\nbecause i'm on twitch but yeah\nyeah um so my anything gamer\nanything in particular you want to talk\nabout today or anything that i can help\nyou with\num yeah i\nwell stress but again it's kind of like\ngood stress because it's stuff that i\nwant to be doing so it's not like i want\nto reduce\nmy workload um i have an inability to\nrelax\nwhich has become kind of a toxic thing\nfor me\nnot recently it's always been like that\num okay not always but\nsince high school um so\nyeah that's annoying that's the only\nthing i can think of right now\ni think can you tell me about your\ninability to relax\nyeah um i have a it is not an\nactual term i've coined it in my head\njust toxic\nproductivity i i always feel like i need\nto be doing something\nand if i'm not doing something i just\nfeel a lot of guilt i think that's\ni think a lot of people deal with that\nbut\nlike a recent thing is i'll try to sit\non the balcony to relax\nor just to like chill out um and the\nonly\nway that i can allow myself to do that\nis if i have like a really tall glass of\nwater and i tell myself that\nif i'm drinking the whole glass of water\nwhile i'm sitting here it's fine because\nthat's a productive thing to do but i\ncan't just sit there\ndoes that make sense yeah absolutely\nuh-huh so that\nand then i've only i've recently started\nusing not recently i've been using\ntick-tock for a while but\num like i'll scroll through tick-tocks\nand that's kind of relaxing but the only\nreason i allow myself to do that without\nfeeling bad is because\nthe videos that i like i show on stream\nso it's like\nyou can justify it because it can be\nused for work\nright right yes driving too i can't\nlisten to music in the car anymore\nbecause i don't feel like it's\nproductive use of my time i\nonly listen to audiobooks even if i\ndon't really want to listen to an\naudiobook\ni like i listen to audiobooks\nbecause i feel like i'm learning\nsomething yeah\nyou know toxic productivity is a huge\nissue um\nand and it's funny because we've uh we\nrecently started\nlike a an interesting pilot at healthy\ngamer because\nyou know a lot of times we'll have\npeople who\nso our community is actually quite\ndiverse\nand what we actually discovered recently\nnot recently but what we've sort of\nhaven't addressed is that there are a\nlot of people who are very productive in\nour community\nand so we actually sorry yeah diverse in\nterms of like age\nrange or demographics so many things\nokay so we started out when i started\nstreaming\nyou know and probably had like less than\n10 000 followers it was like 95\nmale 5 sure female\num and now we're like 70 30 or even 65\n35\ni think is what our audience is uh our\nage range has also recently expanded to\ninclude like parents so like\nyou know there will be we have a just\nwrapped up a parent pilot where we had\nlike\nyou know 50 year old 60 year olds who\nare like\nthat's cool trying to we're trying to\nexplain to them you know\nhow to communicate with their kids and\nstuff like that\nand i think the other thing that that\nwe've started working on is sort of like\nhigh performance so there are a lot of\npeople\nyou know on twitch or in our audience in\nour community who are\nsoftware developers you know executives\nthings like that\nand you know professional uh\nyou know professional athletes of\nvarious kinds\nand so we started like actually running\ngroups for them\nand seeing if we can help them and i\nthink this toxic productivity actually\ncomes up there a lot\nwhere people are you know i think toxic\nproductivity is a good phrase\num okay sweet i thought i made it up but\ni'm glad to hear that i know i mean i i\nthink it's a\nit's a yeah i you know so let me ask you\nsomething when you say you\nallow yourself to sit on the balcony\nso like let's just look at that\nconstruction for a second okay\nwho is the myself and who is doing the\nallowing\num\n[Music]\ni don't know how to answer that question\ndo you understand like\nyeah are we talking like a future\nme and like my present self or something\ni don't i don't know well yeah\nit's a weird question right because so\nyou use the phrase i allow myself to sit\non the balcony\nsure so like the reward is maya gets to\nsit on the balcony\nand it's almost like there's a child and\nthere's a parent in that\nsentence right who's doing the allowing\nand who's getting this it's like it's i\nmean it's almost like a parent-child\nkind of thing where it's like\nmom can i sit on the balcony it's like\nonly if you drink a glass of water\nbecause\nthat's being productive and you don't\nhave time to just sit on the balcony and\ndo nothing\nthat's actually that's interesting i\njust made me think of\ni uh i do kind of have that dichotomy\nlike\ninside of because i am 22. you know i\njust graduated college\num i still like want to go to bars and\ndrink and\nstay up until you know two three\nwhatever with friends just\ndrinking and whatever but i also uh am\nnow i also now run a non-profit\nso there's there's two very different\npeople\nthat like exist within myself so it's\nprobably an argument between the two\nthere's a part of me that wants to be\nnot productive and all of my peers the\npeople that i live with and and my\nfriends in texas as well are all\nstreamers\nso they pretty much do whatever they\nwant you know\nthey don't have many responsibilities\nbesides eating sleeping and streaming\num and sometimes i wish i lived like\nthat you know sometimes i wish i could\njust chill and\ndo whatever and um but that's just like\nnot the case\nfor me so yeah it's it's probably\nbetween the i don't know if that makes\nsense i think it makes a lot of sense\nokay so i i think you see that a lot of\nyour social circle\ncan do this thing that's kind of like\nyou know i i do think it's actually\ntends to be a little bit more\nchallenging for them because i think\nlike you\ni imagine that they they don't just get\nto have fun because fun\nstarts to become content and so they're\nin the business of having fun\nwhich sometimes changes how fun it is\num but i can definitely see that like\nyou're struggling with some kind of work\nlife\nbalance sort of things\nis that fair to say yeah so why is it\nimportant for you to listen to\naudiobooks instead of music\ni just have an endless need to learn\nthings which is great\num but it's too much you know like\nsometimes i like i would like to just\nchill and listen to music\nbut it's like why would i be listening\nto music if i could be listening to and\ni i don't listen to any fiction\naudiobooks either it's always\nnon-fiction or it's like a survival\naudiobook or it's like\nsomething honestly just boring like\nstuff that i don't really feel like i\nwant to know but i'll listen to\naudiobooks on like\ni listen to one on string theory i don't\n[ __ ] care about string theory\nyou know like i was an ag major um but i\njust feel like i\nshould know more i don't know i want to\nknow more about different uh\nabout different things and if i'm\ndriving and not learning i feel like\nit's not a productive use of my time\nyeah so we're gonna highlight one word\nand i want you to pay attention for this\nword should you should\nknow more where does\nhelp me understand that why should you\nknow more\nwe go all the way back to our\nconversation i you have so many\nconversations but the last time we\ntalked we talked about uh where i grew\nup so i grew up in the silicon valley\nwhich is a very productive very high\nachieving\nlocation for schools this has some of\nthe best schools in the nation\nand also some of the highest suicide\nrates in the nation and they're\nabsolutely related\nuh so i was not low achieving\nin school i mean i graduated with uh\nlike a\nwell i graduated with a 4.2 weighted but\ni\nwas not smart in uh school or i wasn't\nlike one of the smart ones\ni just did fine um so\nand like in elementary school you get\nplaced in advanced math classes or\nnormal math classes i was never in\nadvanced math classes\nso it probably comes from there um just\nlike should be doing more\nshould uh should know more should be\nhigher achieving should be going to the\nschool should be doing this but\nwhatever that thanks for reminding me\nthat had slipped my mind yeah\nno that's fine yeah of course um and\nthank you for\ndrawing that connection because i i you\nknow sounds like something sunk in\nyeah that makes sense and yeah so let's\nlet's\nso it sounds like last time we sort of\ngot into\nwhere the should comes from thank you so\nmuch for refreshing my memory\nand so if i'm hearing you correctly you\nkind of grew up in a particular\nenvironment where\ncomparison was important achievement was\nimportant standards were high\nbig shoes to fill for sure and\nyou were not one of the chosen ones yeah\nand so you have to work really hard to\nenter the chosen one category\nyeah i guess so um\nwhat do you think about that um\ni mean i'm doing fine i'm pretty proud\nof myself where i am today\num and i\nmy parents wanted me to go to cornell\nand i'm glad that i didn't because\ni loved it at kelp i went to cal poly\nsan luis obispo\nwhich is uh not nearly as hard to get\ninto as cornell and it's not an ivy\nbut i was so much happier there than i\nwould have been you know if i went\nthere and or if i went to cornell so i'm\nhappy with that choice\num so it's fine i don't know\ni mean it definitely has contributed to\nto the things that i'm talking about\ntoday but\ni'm not like upset about it what has\ncontributed to\nthe things you're talking about today\nthe need to compete\nand compare and all that\nyeah so when you say it's contributed\ncan you help me understand\nhow your need to be better\nhas shaped your life\num\nyeah okay well let's i might it might\nget a little muddy\nso growing up we also talked a lot about\nmy sister\num my sister's 18 months older um and\nshe was very very high achieving all\nthroughout elementary middle and high\nschool\nand she went to an ivy she went to upenn\nmechanical engineering\num whatever and so she did really really\nwell in school and did really well\nplaying soccer\nand so people knew her for those things\npeople knew me\nas like the animal girl in high school\nbecause we grew up on a farm\num and i would like bring animals to her\nsoccer games and i\num was really really into horsemanship\nso i spent a lot of time a lot of time\ntraining horses and all that\nand i think i felt that i had a niche\nthere and i needed to excel\nin animal things and what i was\ninterested in\nto have like my own identity that was on\nthe same level as the one that she had\num and i think that that stuck with me\nsince\nmiddle school or high school whenever\nthat started is just like being the best\nin my thing\num so so you had to get an a plus in\nsomething\nexactly and it wasn't going to be\nmathematics so you chose horsemanship\nright yeah [ __ ] mathematics i i never\nyeah i was terrible at math i still am\nyeah so you should go unschooled have\nyou thought about that do you know what\nthat is\nno what is that oh my gosh matt has miss\nkiff has this show\ncalled schooled do you know the show are\nyou smarter than a fifth grader\nno okay it's basically like\nyou go on and they ask you questions\nthat are kindergarten level questions\nfirst grade second grade third grade\nright and the point is maybe this isn't\nfair the point is kind of to make the\ncontestants look dumb because it's like\nyou can't answer a third grade question\nbut just because you don't remember\nthose things you know\num but he has it and then you can get\nsubs depending on how high you go and\nthen if you win there's a ten thousand\ndollar competition at the end but that\nwould be really interesting\nfor you to go on and and see if i'm\nsmarter than a fifth grader\nyeah essentially well it goes all the\nway up through high school\num but most people get out about eighth\ngrade ninth grade interesting\nyeah i'll definitely think about it but\ni i'm not so sure that i would be so\noptimistic because\ni have an almost four year old and an\nalmost six-year-old and i'm pretty sure\nthat\nyou know they would outperform me in\nmany ways yeah i would do it\nmy three-year-old my three-year-old\nyesterday told me that i need to eat\nwith my mouth closed\nso you know i can check yeah i\ni don't really know how to feel about\nthat because\non the one hand it's like wow we're like\nyou know she's learning manners\nand stuff and also she's\nyou know being i don't\nyeah it's it's i don't know\nmy older one is a little bit of a tyrant\noh yeah yeah she she recently discovered\nthat there's a job called a director\noh boy and that the job of the director\nis to tell other people what to do\nso she was like wait their whole job is\nto direct people\nand i was like yes that's correct and\nshe's like\nshe's she's power hungry she has the\ndesire to lord over others\ni like it um that's sweet but yeah i'll\ndefinitely i'm i'm a huge fan of of\nmiss kiff and and so that sounds like\nfun\nyeah um guy is amazing he really is\nhe's really good at what he does yes\ni remember trying to convince him of\nthat some some time ago\noh for sure um yeah he also seems to\nhave grown a lot in confidence i've\ncaught\na couple of clips and and stuff of him\nand he seems to be really doing amazing\nyeah he's doing well for himself he\nfeels he feels good about it\nyeah um but kind of going back to you\nand developing a niche in horsemanship\nright uh so i'm hearing that\nyou know early on you sort of decided\nthat you were going to be the best at\nsomething\nand then i can imagine the should in\nyour head\npushed you is that\nfair to say yeah how did you feel\nstudying when you said you were an ag\nmajor i assume you mean agriculture\nyes okay agricultural communication well\nagricultural education and\ncommunications\nis my major how did you feel about\nhaving that as your major\ni thought it was sick um it is\npretty good it was like cool okay\nit was a it's pretty small major um\nand all of my friends and my sister are\neither mechanical engineers software\nengineers electrical engineers or\nuh engineer\nmedicine wonderful yeah all of them\nif you really want to be try hard you\ncan do electrical engineering double\nmajor pre-med\nyeah or biomass biomed biomed\nengineering\nactually yeah biomed from biomed\nengineering pre-med\nthere you go you can win all of the\nprizes\nit's very good um\nyeah so all my friends were in there my\ndad i think\ndeep down my dad probably wanted me to\nbe an engineer but knew that i would\nnever go into engineering um\nso i just looked for a major that i\nactually wanted to do and i\nonly applied to two schools and it was\ncal poly and colorado state\nfort collins or ag communications or\nequine science\ncool course science and so i'm hearing\nthat you've grown into someone that you\ncan be proud of\nyeah yeah i think so and you've\naccomplished a lot\nyeah when you compare yourself to your\nfriends where are you\nyou doing good yeah most of them are\nstill in school\nbecause uh they're they're pre-med\num or they're getting masters or\nwhatever so\nyeah and you have started a non-profit\nand built something\nyeah you're not just a student right\nthank god sorry chad if you're in school\nstay in school school's great i hate it\ngod i'm so glad i'm not in college\nanymore\ni didn't hate college but i'm happy to\nnot be\nin academics so why do you have to\nlisten to audiobooks when you're in the\ncar\nthat's like an interesting question i\nguess i'm picking the books that i'm\nreading\nor listening to um\ni don't know so i don't know because i\nlike learning\ni don't like doing assignments that are\nor that i thought were pointless i had\nthe whole like\na very subtle like [ __ ] the system thing\nin my head but\ni'm sure you like learning i have no\ndoubt of that in my mind\nbut i don't think you listen to audio\nbooks because you like learning\nwhat do you think i think you listen to\naudio because\nbooks because you should be learning oh\nthat's true\nmaybe yeah so if i were to tell you have\nyou\nread harry potter no\nany interest no do you like fiction\ni don't know i've never i've never read\nfiction in my own time\noh for school i've read fiction okay\nwhat do you think about the idea of\nreading fiction um\nthis is like i wish i wanted to because\ni know that it it\nlike can be important honestly my\nmy first reaction is that i think it's\nlike watching movies and tv shows that\nare fiction and i feel like that's a\nwaste of time but it's even more of a\nwaste of time because it takes longer\nnice yeah so but i know that that's like\nif we're gonna waste time we're gonna be\nefficient about it right\nyes yeah if we're gonna why would i\nspend eight hours reading a book when i\ncould watch two hours reading a movie\nwe're going to optimize\nour departure to the book while you're\ngetting somewhere\nyeah right so always optimizing very\ncommon in people with toxic productivity\nalso not necessarily a bad thing so i\nthink this is where um\nyou know your tendency to optimize is\nprobably something that's a\npersonality trait that will serve you\nwell i think the main thing is for us to\nexplore how you can get\nin control of it instead of it being in\ncontrol of you\nso let me ask you a question what do you\nwhat would you say to a friend of yours\nif they said yeah the only time i'm\nallowed to sit outside\nis if i have a very tall glass of water\nso i can be productive\ni hate that test i use that i use that\ntest in my head all the time\num can you tell me about it um\nwell just like you use in your head all\nthe time\nuh like the the friend test\nlike if your friend was saying the\nthings that you're saying you know about\nyourself what would you say to your\nfriend that kind of thing\nwhat do you hate about that test because\nit always shows that i'm\ntoo hard on myself or that i'm not doing\nwhat i would tell a friend to do\nwhich is not like it's not a bad thing\nit's a good test that's that's\nwhy i use it but it is like a\ni don't know i don't know how to\ndescribe it\nno no no can can i just think for a\nsecond\nfor sure\n[Music]\nthere's something oddly recursive about\nwhat you just said\nokay so like it's almost like\nyou should be doing better at passing\nthat test\nyou see that's actually that's true it's\nthe same thing\nyeah it's like\nyeah you're right okay so but\nyeah so so then let's forget about that\ntest i don't but i\nyou know why do you think you would\nadvocate some things for your friends\nas opposed or what what makes you have a\ndifferent standard for yourself\nthan other people oh\num we'll go into the whole like imposter\n[ __ ]\ni i feel like i'm extremely lucky to be\nin the position that i'm in\num and i am i got i got lucky by there\nbeing a redditor in my chat\nwhen i was a small streamer that posted\nme on lsf and then i met ms and then\nlike it went from there right\nand i feel a ton of pressure because\num i have the platform that i do and\nthere aren't a lot of people doing\nconservation education on twitch\num i call it an untapped reservoir all\nthe time not just because of the\nfundraising potential but because of the\naudience that we're reaching\nthat is like from the people that i know\nin conservation education just\nnotoriously hard to reach\nand educate um so i feel like i have\nthis opportunity to teach so many people\nthings that they wouldn't be learning\notherwise and so i need to do a really\ngood job at it\nand i need to do it fast before the\nplatform dies or before\ni get canceled or before i get banned or\nbefore you know whatever before i lose\nthe opportunity\nso i feel like because the platform that\ni have i have to do good with it\nand not not waste it\nokay so we're gonna note a couple of\nthings okay\none is the sand and the hourglasses\nrunning out\nmm-hmm is that how it feels to you\num yeah i mean it's not super severe\nit's not like i'm like\nwhat if i only have a year left like i\nthink i have a good you know\n5 10 15 years with what i'm doing right\nnow\num but eventually i know that\nyou know it's a social platform like\nit'll change\nor die or whatever and um\nit doesn't sound to me like you are\nbehaving in a way in which you have 15\nyears left\nthat's true i don't know i don't know if\ni have 15 years on twitch\ni don't know how long i'm going to be\nstreaming for um\nelvis my non-profit i'm not dropping in\nthe next\n10 years i need to do it fast\ncan you help me understand that\num\ni guess it's just because i feel like i\nhave the opportunity now it's the same\nreason that i do so many sponsors\ni like feel like i have to bankroll\nright now while i have sponsorship\nopportunities um\n[Music]\ni don't know just because it's like\nthere i also need to make money\num because i put all of my money that\ni've made through streaming into the\nproperty that i\npurchased for the nonprofit um and my\nparents helped me with the down payment\nso now i owe my parents money\num and you know i gotta pay a mortgage\nand i have to pay for my horse and i\nhave to pay\nfor my backpack and for rent and food\nand\nall that um so\nso this may sound kind of weird maya but\nthere's what you need to do\nthere's so i don't doubt that the time\nto strike is now\nand strike while the iron is hot does\nthat make sense like you're like\nthis is an opportunity i have to do this\nnow i can get behind that 100\nand i'd say go for it at the same time\nthere's a difference between\nnow is the time to act and feeling like\nnow is the time to act\nokay does that make any sense to you can\nyou elaborate on that\nyeah so i think um you do a really good\njob of piecing things together so i'm\ngonna go\nlike a little bit more theoretical so\nthe feeling of desperation is a feeling\nright so if i have an opportunity that's\nonly available now i can take advantage\nof the opportunity but whether i feel\ndesperate the the feeling of desperation\nmay be completely appropriate\nbut it's still a feeling right yeah and\nand what i'm hearing the need for is\nsome separation between\ntaking advantage of the oper opportunity\nand sort of\nfeeling desperate that now is only going\nto be the only chance that you get\nright so do you feel\ndesperate um\nyeah i think so i think it's primarily\nfinancially driven right now though like\nif there was a sponsor that i didn't\nnecessarily want to do\ni would do it um if it was like a\nsignificant amount of money because\ni don't think that that same deal will\ncome in the next like six months\nyeah i can understand that so i think\nthat there's the financial reality and\nthen there's like\nthe way that you feel about it which i\nthink gets that's\na lot of what leads to toxic\nproductivity does that make sense\nyep can you explain it to us\nhow those two things could be related\nmaybe i'm the thing that's sticking in\nmy head right now is like\nthe that they're two separate things is\nthere's like a positive and and doing\nwhat's in front of you and taking the\nopportunity and then\num feeling desperate about it and doing\nit because of that feeling of\ndesperation\nright so one of those is the productive\npart one of those is the toxic\npart right right so so\nbeautifully explained by the way i well\nthank you i disagree but\nthank you you should have done a better\njob is that what you mean to say\nyeah um but yeah and i guess it makes\neverything that i go\nit's not everything that i do is toxic\nbut um\nbeing as productive as i am feels toxic\nbecause it's all\nlike i have to do it now because like i\nhave the opportunity now so it's not\nlike i'm doing it just because it's like\nsitting there and like now's the time\nit's like you have to do this now do\nthis this is\nthere and what happens if you don't do\nit now\num i don't make enough money or i lose\nviewership or alves\ndoesn't do as well as i want um and then\nwhat happens\nand then well lots of different things\nif it's the money thing i don't get to\npay my parents back which is\nnot gonna happen um if it's the\nwhat are the other things i said uh\nalvarez doesn't do as well i\nhave like a i have a couple tests that i\nrun in my head for that as well one of\nor for just like when i'm around the\nnon-profit and one of them is\ni have a conservation podcast also that\ni'm doing monthly now i was doing it\nweekly\nand there's a lot of people that come on\nthere that i really really admire and\nrespect for their research or their\nyou know their what they do in education\nor whatever and so i have that list of\npeople and i think\nif they were watching my content right\nnow or they were seeing what i was doing\nwith this non-profit would i be proud or\nwould i be embarrassed\num so i would be embarrassed if i didn't\ndo well without vas\nand for my reputation in in the industry\num\nand then and then i remember the other\nthing i said\nif i was embarrassed and i didn't do\nwell in the industry uh then i feel like\ni would have to stop climbing the ladder\nyou would have to stop climbing the\nladder\nwell no maybe i just get knocked down if\nyou i don't know i i would like\ni would just what you initially said\neven if it doesn't\nright so then yeah\nyou would have to stop climbing the\nladder like that's an interesting\nstatement\nyeah i don't know i guess i'd go back to\nbeing an intern or i would go do\nsomething else\ni think you'd get a b maybe\nin your thing god forbid i'm gonna be\nyeah so what i'm hearing from you maya\nis and let me know if this is i step out\nof line okay\nhow are you feeling right now feeling\nokay i'm fine okay yeah\nwhat i'm hearing is that if you didn't\ntake advantage of this opportunity it\nwould all come crumbling down\nall yeah i guess\ni'm trying to think of what wouldn't but\nyeah i don't really know\nright so it's interesting because you\ncan think about all the things that\nwould come crumbling down even though if\nwe're if we're logical about it like\nyou're not going to get flattened by any\nof this stuff like you can miss\nopportunities things will go\nnot your way and you're going to do fine\nyeah do you believe that about yourself\nyeah that would be fine yeah kill myself\nso that's not what well i'm not gonna\ndie\nhow else wouldn't i be fine i would i'd\nbe alive like\nbut i would i probably wouldn't be happy\nokay\nthat was not what i was expecting to\nhear\noh but by fine i meant that i think your\nnon-profit would continue to do well\nand you would continue to grow i thought\nyou meant\nlike sorry i'm interrupting you a lot\nnope no\ni i appreciate it please please\ninterrupt what were you gonna say i\nthought you meant if the non-profit\ndidn't work\nand like my opportunity being like me\nstreaming and doing the non-profit\nlike if i had to like stop streaming for\nwhatever reason yeah and obvious dad\nlike that's what i thought you're\ntalking about\nyeah so i know this sounds weird i think\nyou'd do fine if that happened\nbecause what i'm putting what i'm the\nreason i make that assessment is because\ni think your commitment to\nthis mission is so resilient\nthat you would find a way to make a\ndifference\nand if it wasn't this opportunity that\nyou're taking advantage of you'd\nkeep on floating around the space and\nbecause you are\nproductive and because you are brilliant\nand gifted and all of those other things\nthat you would find a way to move\nforward\nwhat do you think about that that's\nprobably true\ni'm not sure that it would be in the\nwell probably would be in the same\nindustry i can't imagine\ndoing a different one but yeah i'd\nprobably find something else\nto do but i can understand\nthat in your mind you may not\nremember that all the time\nyeah i mean i don't think about it but\nwhat do you think about\njust in general like when it comes to\nnot seizing opportunities\num\ni don't know just like slowing down\nlike things with elvis like if i don't\nseize an opportunity with alves like is\nthat going to slow down\nthe the development of the nonprofit and\nlike how fast i can get to doing\ncollaborations and how many ambassadors\nwe acquire\num and then for myself it's more like\nmoney\ndo you want to slow down no\ncan you afford to slow down\num yeah really probably\nyeah i think so um obviously it's\nsupposed to be a three-year plan i mean\nit would be completely reasonable if it\ntook me three years to\nto build out the facility that i'm\nbuilding um\nbut it doesn't sound like you can afford\nto slow down\nwell not to me but in reality yeah\ni could well we're talking to you okay\nso so so let's talk about you know\nforget about reality because who cares\nabout that okay for sure\nwhy can't you slow down\nbecause the more sponsors i do the\nfaster i make my money back\num and then the faster alves\ndevelops the faster i have a\nsuccessfully running\nnon-profit that i'm really proud of\nthat's making an actual difference\nright now it's just all temporary what's\nthe rush probably the like\namount of time that i feel like i have\nto\nmake the difference like how long i'm\ngoing to be streaming\nor so i think we come back to the sand\nand the hourglasses running out\nmm-hmm and so this is where\nhey how's this conversation going for\nyou by the way\ngood okay makes sense yeah yeah so\nlet me ask you something have you has\nthe sand and the hourglass run out for\nyou before\nhave you missed an opportunity that you\ncan never get back\ni don't think so i can't think of\nanything i mean maybe\nmaybe something small but no like big\nlife so nothing pops into your head when\ni ask that question\nno\nit feels to me my when i'm talking to\nyou\nthat you're like you know the image that\ni get in my mind is like a surfer who's\nriding a really high wave that's going\nto crash at some point\noh that's great to hear so\ndoes that image resonate with you at all\num\ni guess yeah it does kind of feel like a\npeak\nyeah yeah yeah yeah\nbut i don't i mean i don't anticipate a\ncrash anytime soon\nsure but eventually like for all\nstreamers\nnot all streamers can't speak for all\nstreamers but there's like a\nwe have this crazy opportunity while\nwe're this age you know we're streaming\nand\nyou peek in viewership at some point you\njust do you know like you get to a point\nwhere you're like as big as you're gonna\nbe\nyou may get followers but like you'll\nend up decreasing in viewership\neventually\num so there is like i don't know there's\nthere's a peak somewhere um and i do\nfeel like with the start of all this and\nonce elvis is running and i'm doing all\nthat content like\nyeah like how do you\ni don't know like how do you achieve\nhigher than that i don't know\nit's kind of like uh this is a bad\nexample and i'm sure\nhe's completely fine but there was some\nkid i don't even remember his name\nthat won that fortnight world cup or\nsomething at age like 14 or something\n15 was it yeah yeah\num when he did that my first thought was\nlike damn\nif he's gonna be doing competitive\nesports for the rest of his life and\nfortnite is his game like\nhow is he ever gonna feel like he's\nbeat himself again i don't mean beat\nhimself like you know\nlike how can he ever top that right\nyeah yeah so you said it feels like\nyou're at the peak\nyeah well not right now i'm like\nup there though i'm like a building\nbuilding up there\nyeah i mean where do we go once we hit\nthe top of the peak\ni don't know um i'll need to find other\nthings that i think are really\nfulfilling and\nand uh productive like i\nfor matt like he has otk ms giff\num has otk and he's gonna like continue\ndoing business\nafter he decides to not stream so much\nanymore um\nand so that'll be really fulfilling for\nhim and he'll take all of his experience\ninto there so he'll continue being\nreally successful\nfor me it's hard because my goal is\nconservation education you know like i\nwant to teach as many people as possible\nso the idea of going from streaming and\ndoing it on stream to like\ntens of thousands to going to like if i\nquit streaming and i go to\nclassrooms or something and teach kids\nit'll just feel like less of an\nimpact because of like what i want to do\nyou know but i guess i could consult or\nsomething and teach people about digital\nconservation education that that might\nbe fulfilling\nbut not as fulfilling is actually doing\nit maybe it would i don't know\nso maya i'm hearing a lot of different\nstuff\nokay okay so here's what i'm hearing\nall right now you do a really good job\nof\nsharing a statement or a feeling and\nthen putting a lot of context or\ncounterpoints around that\nif you notice that you do that so like\nfor example you were like it\nit feels like i met i asked you about\nthe surfer analogy and then you said\ni feel like i'm at the peak and then if\ni ask you do you feel like you're at the\npeak and then you say not yet and then\nyou kind of add some context to know i\ncould do this and i could do this\nso i think you have to be a little bit\ncareful in your mind because i think a\nlot of your toxic\nproductivity the toxicity is coming from\nthat instinctual\nresponse and then you do all of these\nthings to kind of like\nwrap around it and kind of like\nyou know what i mean yeah yeah right so\njust be careful about that because i\nthink if you don't\njustifying your toxic productivity or\nreassuring yourself\nis not the same as like fixing the root\nissue of like why you feel\na particular way so here's what i'm\nhearing the first is that you carved out\nyour niche\nright you were not the star student but\nyou found this thing in which you could\nbe a star it's a\nplus you're 22 you're doing great you're\ngrowing it's a lot of fun you're\ngenuinely dedicated\ni absolutely see that and then there's\nalso like this kind of\ntricky thing right because there's the\nsand and the hourglass is running out\nlike you need to be learning more you\nshould be doing better it's got to be\nbetter better better\nwe haven't really quite talked about\nthis\nbut i i get the sense that\nyou're both confident in yourself and\nyou have the echoes of not being\nconfident in yourself left over\nso it's sort of like this idea where\nlike until i make it to a certain level\nthen i can rest easy we haven't quite\ntalked about that yet\nbut i would venture if we continue to\ntalk we would\neventually uncover this sort of idea\nthat once i\nget to this point then i can relax do\nyou have that kind of thinking in your\nmind\nwhat does that point look like i have no\nidea\nyeah i haven't hit it yet i don't know\nwhat it looks like\nyeah so that's but you know what i mean\nwhen i say like\nthere's a part of your mind that says\nyou can relax once everything gets\nsettled\nyeah like once you're sure that it'll\nlast once the sand in the hourglass is\nno longer running out\nright once the house of cards gets you\nknow slathered and concrete and becomes\nstable\nso i think that's tricky because you\nknow i it\nvery insightful maya so i ask you what\ndoes that look like and you're like i\nhave no idea and you never will\nso this is the problem with toxic\nproductivity is like\neven if i get to this peak i want to be\nclimbing i want to be growing i need to\nbe doing better because i don't quite\nhave 100\nfaith in myself and\nthen you're going to find another peak\nto climb you can start doing consulting\nyou can do this you can do this it'll\nnever end\nyou can always find some way to grow\nyou can push yourself to be better and\nlearn more and stuff like that but as\nlong as like\nbut that's just the sand and the\nhourglass is going to continue\nlike you're always going to feel like oh\nnow i have this consulting opportunity\nand like someone else on tiktok is doing\nconservation so like\nmy time has passed and there is another\n22 year old and i'm haggard and old at\nthe age of 24.\nright you know yeah and then unless i\nstart consulting then that person's\ngonna do the consulting and then i\ni will have you know there's new forms\nof social media and the platform is\ndifferent\nthat kind of thinking can propagate\nforever\nso what do you think we do about this\ni don't know i've uh\nyet to figure it out i don't know i i\ncan't remember when i wasn't\ni kind of think of like when i wasn't\nlike this because it definitely wasn't\nin high school\num you definitely weren't like this in\nhigh school or you were like\ni was i was like this in high school and\ni i was like this in middle school as\nwell\num i think at least since sixth grade um\nso i don't know how to fix that\nwhat were you like before the sixth\ngrade\num\n[Music]\ni don't know how to describe myself i\nmean i\nspent a lot of time outside um with at\nthe barn with my horse and\nuh\nhad a lot of playdates and like showing\npeople the animals and whatever but\nthere was never like a\nuh i need to get good at something\ni just actually that's not true no it\ngoes further back because i did uh\nfigure skating um and felt really\ncompetitive in that\nso and i was like oh my gosh i was\nlittle\nbefore fourth grade\nso then even further back\nbefore that i don't know then i just\nexisted as like a child\ni think i had aspirations i think i was\njust like\ntrying things yeah so let me ask you\nsomething what would it feel like\nto relax\nmy first thought was stressful which is\nterrible\nit doesn't make sense you shouldn't feel\nthat way maya\nright um\nyeah no i don't know i think i just get\nstressed out i think\nuh\ni don't feel like a waste of time yeah\nso\nwhat is it like to waste time how does\nthat\nfeel to you the thought of wasting time\nstressful it like makes me itch okay so\nstress is an umbrella term okay right\nso like what what can you tell me more\nabout what would be stressful about you\ntaking a day off falling behind\nand then having more to do the next day\nor\nnot making money that day or not i don't\nknow\nnot talking to who i was supposed to\ntalk to that day or like letting people\ndown by not\ndoing everything talking to everybody um\nyeah are you behind now\nyeah a little bit not a lot\nreally yeah oh i mean in terms of like\ntasks yeah how about\nspiritually do you feel like you're\nbehind in life\nno i don't think so either\nhave you been behind in life before\nyeah um when i was\ni my previous relationship i dated a guy\nfor five years and we started dating\nwhen i was\n15 um and then up through college\nuh and i feel like we both kind of\npaused\nin that relationship you know which is\nlike kind of normal um so i do feel like\ni was behind\nthere and then after that i did like\na lot of therapy um and\nhad like a year and some change of being\nsingle and whatever and\num grown a lot since then but i was\nyeah i felt like i was stunted back then\nhow did it feel to be stunted i didn't\nknow i was stunted so\num so at the time\nit was just like how it was and then\nafter it was like damn\nthat's embarrassing\nso i'm hearing another part of your\ntoxic productivity which is you're never\ngonna fall behind again\nyeah maybe right so you've been there\nbefore\nand you may not have noted at the time\nbut i think you knew it at the time\nyou understood on some level\nthat this was not good for sure and you\njust didn't know any different back then\nright but now that you know different i\nthink part of where i hear your\ndesperation coming from\nis like never again\nand i'm sort of hearing it i'm going to\nconnect some dots\nhere you let me know if these are fair\nor unfair but like\ni get the sense like you know this\ndesperation this wave crashing this like\nthere's just a lot of like imagery that\nmaybe i'm inflating so you got to let me\nknow you got to set me straight okay\nif i'm being too dank but um\nyou know i i i get a lot of like weird\nthings smile like so i'm getting a\nfeeling of like fear i'm getting a fear\nof\nit's weird because i think these things\nare co-exist\nwith confidence so like i'm getting some\nsense of like it's going to come\ncrumbling down this is my a\nplus i have to make it work you know i'm\nactually i'm crushing those noobs who\nare in\nlike applying to med school right now\nbecause i'm out actually making the\nworld\na better place and and i can hold my\nhead up high\nbecause i have an a plus and this is my\nniche\nand and there's all that kind of stuff\nand like if that all comes like\ncrumbling down\nbecause what i hear is really like a\ndesperation that it's all going to come\ncrumbling down\nthen who am i going to be i'm going to\nbe back to being stuck i'm going to back\nto be\nbehind and this is where you assure me\nthat you're not going to kill yourself\nbut it's sort of it's interesting right\nbecause it's like it's that's the\nreassurance it sort of implies that\nthere's not\nthere's nothing in the middle yeah right\nthere's like where you are\nnow and there's no gray zone between\nlike don't worry i won't kill myself\nand i'm crushing it and started a\nnon-profit and i'm accomplishing\nso like this is a crazy thing right i\nask you are you behind and you're like\na little bit and then it's like you've\ngot a three-year plan which is you're\naccomplishing in three months\nso that's drastically ahead and\nlogically\nif you were your friend you would say\nmaya you can afford to slow down you've\ngot\nyou know you've got about 33 months that\nyou're ahead\nbut that logical part like i don't think\nyou can\ni think it's terrifying like stressful\nis a good word\nlike what would it be like\nto take a day off\ni i just feel like i would be falling\nbehind if i did\num we'll see because i'm supposed to so\nmy birthday is on the 24th and\ni want to it's kind of weird dumb\ni just like want to go to a hotel that's\nnot far away because i don't want to be\ntoo far away from the nonprofit and the\nanimals in case anything happens like i\ndon't want to actually travel\nbut i just want to sit in a hotel\nbecause then i feel like i have an\nexcuse to not be on my pc and to not be\nworking\num but even then i guarantee i'm still\ngoing to be\ndoing emails like on my phone and like\ntrying to be productive so\nyeah i don't know if i actually had to\nsit there and relax\nwithout my phone or without like the\nability to work\ni just don't think i would like it i\nthink i would panic yep\nand what would your mind produce for you\nin those moments\nwhat kind of thoughts would you have\num\n[Music]\nwell if it was my choice then it would\nbe guilt\nif i was like forced into the situation\nthen i'd just be like\nscared what would you feel guilty about\num not taking\nlike having a full day like that many\nhours to do\nthings and to catch up on things and to\nget ahead on things and not doing it\nwhat's wrong with not getting ahead on\nthings\ni leave more for myself the next day and\nthen the next day and the next day and\nthen it piles up and then i lose my mind\nokay why do you have to do so much\nbecause i have the opportunity now\nyeah why did you start laughing there\nit's like a circle\ncircuit yeah i have a full circle thing\nyeah so this is where i think\nmy i know it sounds you're gonna hold on\ncan i think for a second\nmaya do you wanna do you do you want to\nbe\nno longer toxically productive\ni don't know i to be honest like i\ncannot imagine myself\nnot moving as fast as i do okay i would\njust feel bad about myself i feel like i\ncould do better\nyep so the reason i because i i think\nthat this\nthis so the next the rest of this\nconversation is useless\nbecause because like i think it starts\nwith do you want to change\ni wish i do wish that i could relax i\nin college i was stre\nwe talked about this at the very\nbeginning it was like stress but it was\nbad stress\nbecause i didn't care about what i was\ndoing but in college i could go out i\nwould go out during golden hour and sit\nthere and just like watch\nyou know and really enjoyed that and\nlike\ncould soak it in whatever i would do art\nprojects just for fun like i would paint\nstuff and\nand whatever because all i had to do was\nan assignment you know and then turn it\nin and once i got done with if i did if\ni wasn't done with all that i was like\ni could not relax but once i was done\nand i felt caught up with it i didn't\nfeel the need to excel past that\num so i would just sit\nand chill and like soak in stuff i wish\nthat i could do that\nnow but now that i have\nall the autonomy and i have like i know\nwhat i have to do to get ahead\num i just feel like i constantly have to\nbe doing that does that make any sense\nmakes perfect sense okay yeah so i think\nthat\nbeing in charge you know it's\ninteresting so when i was in residency\nwe work like 80 hours a week right and\nthat's a lot that's\nso much and so then people would say\nlike oh like after you're done with\nresidency like you get to relax\nright like you only have to work 60\nhours a week and then i sort of did that\nfor a while and then i became my own\nboss\nand then it was like wow like if i don't\ndo this thing\nit doesn't get done the earlier it gets\ndone\nthe better it is for everyone and the\nonly bottleneck to making the world a\nbetter place\nis my laziness\nand so i better get up off my ass\nbecause i can do all of these things i'm\nthe only one that can do them\nand if they if i don't do them they\ndon't get done right\nyeah that that part resonates yeah\nso i i think i think it comes down to\nconsequences which is like what happens\nif that stuff doesn't get done\num i mean for me\nit's just like there are less people\nlearning about conservation and less\ngood is happening\nfor the planet um there's like\nthat group of people that's not going to\nhear about not using this rodenticide\nyou know and they're going to use it and\nthen animals are going to die\num yeah so you have you have a real\nop combo there because i think you have\nyour toxic productivity sand and the\nhourglass is running out a touch of\nimposter syndrome it'll all end and\nin shambles the wave will crash that\npart of your mind\nthen finds a very interesting poster\nchild\nwhich is make the world a better place\nand the two of those when combined\nare very very difficult to argue against\nbut be careful because which one really\nis it\nright which one comes first is it the\nfeeling of the sand and the hourglass or\nlike you like relentlessly like\nwhy do you sleep maya imagine how many\nanimals are dying\nevery hour you sleep i've actually\nyeah i've struggled sleeping before\nbecause of that\nbut that's because i'm also a wildlife\nrehabilitator so\nwe have babies that we have to feed\nthroughout the night and stuff like that\nand\nyeah there there are nights where i'm\njust like i cannot go to sleep that's\nselfish\num but\nwhich one is it more i mean i would\nobviously like to say that it's\nuh my drive to make the world better but\ni'm honestly not sure\num i don't know which one\nis more i would say i would say if i had\nyou know this is\nyou have to correct me but and i know\nyou don't know now but i i've seen this\na lot where i think toxic productivity\ncomes from like\na genuine mission that gets hijacked\nby like a psychological need so there is\nlike a fear\nyou know and it's not and this is the\ntricky thing is because i i can see that\nyou're confident in yourself like i can\nsee that you recognize objectively\nthat you have accomplished a lot and\nthat also makes things so much more\nterrifying because like now you've built\nup like it's this grand experiment where\nyou've borrowed money and it's happening\nand it's real and there's stuff on\nsocial media so you like can't\nno take backs now you have ambassadors\nthat are relying on you\nof people that are relying on you you\nhave you know all kinds of things that\nare depending on you\nso onward and upward and no looking back\nand no slowing down\nand if all we have to sacrifice is maya\nso be it yeah i guess\nso i want you to i think it starts with\nfirst of all you you know whether you\nwant to slow down\nright because i i don't think you do but\nwhat i will tell you is that\ni don't i know this sounds absolutely\ncrazy but i don't think you relaxing\nwill actually decrease your productivity\nat all\nwell that's good because i don't want it\nto\ni know so this is sort of giving in to\nit\nbut in my work of like so i do a lot of\nwork on optimizing performance\nso case in point i work with some like\nesports teams for example\nand i don't know if you know this but\nesports teams grind a lot\nright grind it it took me months\nto convince i do this with all the\nesports teams i work with some of them\nnever get it\nit took me months to explain to them\nthat playing 12 hours a day of pubs\ndoes not actually make you better at the\ngame at your skill level\nand there's this relentless sense that\nyou just have to grind grind\ngrind grime grind and the more you do\nthe better it is\nright but i i think that\ni know it sounds weird but i think that\nlike you can accomplish just as much\nbecause i just don't think human beings\nare you know optimally productive once\nthey cross a particular threshold\ni think that doing things like re\nrelaxing is actually going to like boost\nyour productivity you know there are\nstudies that are done on\nyou know working five days a week versus\nfour days a week and people get the same\namount of stuff done\nwhat do you think about that\ni think it makes sense to me\nbut it's also like when i think about my\nday-to-day and\nwhat i want to do to be more productive\nit's like if i meet this contractor\nat my property today the floors will get\ndone today that means that the site is\nmore developed like if i call this like\nyou know dumpster roll off we'll get a\ndumpster today so we can clean more\nstuff out which makes\nlike which pushes pushes us further\nalong but the more that i do in a day\nthe farther we get you know i'm with you\na hundred percent\nhow does your understanding string\ntheory help your emu\noh my god it doesn't at all i i don't\nknow why\nlike i also don't know why i thought\nthat i could under i mean obviously i\ndon't understand that you can't\nunderstand string theory without like\nmy physics knowledge is horrible um but\ni was just like\ni should know at least what this is\nwhere does that come from why should you\nknow what that is\ni don't know i guess i just don't feel\nlike i'm oh i just don't feel like i'm\ncompetent enough like i feel like i\nshould know\nlike if someone asks me i'd just be like\ni don't know and i don't want to feel\nstupid\nso i don't want to not know like i just\nwant to know everything\nwhich is completely unrealistic but\nsee there you there you go again sharing\na feeling and then what do you do\nuh it's not really qualifying is it um\nlike no it's good close enough\nqualifying right right like you you\nyou you play you play tennis with\nyourself you hit the ball across the net\nand then you run over to the other side\nand you hit it back\nyeah yeah so why i think if you want\nlike i know this sounds kind of weird\nbut if you want to like\nimprove in this aspect you got to stop\nrunning over to the other side of the\nnet\n[Music]\nso\ni know this sounds kind of weird but do\nyou feel\nstupid oh all the time yeah but that's\nnot new\ni just did it again sorry continue\ncan you tell me about that\num\nwhere when did i start feeling stupid\nprobably in\nabout sixth grade uh when no fourth\ngrade when we started\nbeing accepted into advanced math\ncourses that's probably where it started\nand oh and then in sixth grade i\ncouldn't pass my time stables for [ __ ] i\nwas like damn\ni'm dumb as hell i probably started\nthere\nand then uh i don't know same thing\nthrough high school\njust other people achieving more and\nthen\nnow uh just the people that i have on my\npodcast\ni have i mean i have the platform you\nknow and i'm\npretty good at like being a bridge\nbetween\nscience and like the public you know\nthat's why i do the podcast and i have a\nrole there but i also\nconstantly feel like i'm not qualified\nto be talking to the people that i talk\nto and they know so much more than me\num and i feel dumb a lot of times when\ni'm talking to them because they'll be\ntalking about something and i'm like i\ndon't know what that is or i don't know\nwhat that means\nand i know it's not my place to be the\nscientist i'm literally not the\nscientist on the podcast but\nyeah okay\ncan i think for a second\nso what do you do if you feel dumb\nwhat's the answer\nwhat do you mean like what do i so you\nfeel dumb all the time\nhow do you deal with that learn more\nhow's that working for you i still feel\ndumb\ni mean you can't learn everything\ninteresting right\nyeah listening to the string theory book\njust made me feel more stupid so\nbut nevermind\nokay so let me ask you something every\ntime you catch yourself doing the\nqualifier do you feel stupid there\ni don't feel stupid i feel annoyed\nokay that i didn't think about it before\ni started it yep so that's sort of\nthat's sort of that feels the same okay\nyeah dumb\nright i'm not trying to put words into\nyour mouth but you gotta you gotta tell\nme\nright so we gotta be careful about that\nbecause like inadvertently you're\nactually pulling me into a situation\nwhere i may make you feel stupid\noh you're fine i'll tell you\nokay so let's just pause for a second\nand think about this so if you feel dumb\nand you you try to fix that by learning\nright like when we feel a certain way\nabout ourselves we like\nmake efforts in the real world to change\nit\nand how effective is that\ni i mean it depends i don't know um i'm\nthinking like if it's like a very\nspecific topic\nand you think that you're dumb in the\ntopic and then you learn about it then i\nwould feel no longer dumb\nokay so how long have you felt dumb\nat least fourth grade okay maybe maybe\nbefore how\noften do you feel dumb\num maybe like\nevery other day okay i don't i don't\nthink it's\ndaily but it's it may be okay maybe\ndaily so\nand how much have you learned between\nfourth grade and now\na lot absolutely so how do you\nunderstand that\nhow do you understand the relationship\nbetween learning a lot and feeling dumb\nwhat can we conclude that learning more\ndoesn't make me feel not\ndumb because i can't learn everything\nyeah so then then the\ntricky issue becomes what do we do with\nthe feeling of dumbness\ni don't know do you want that to change\num wait i have to think about that\num do i want that to change\ni it's my primary motivator to learn\ni think um so\ni don't know good answer i wanna\nif i wanna not feel dumb i mean there's\ntimes where i don't like feeling dumb\nsure i hate feeling dumb on stream but\nso we get we get to an interesting issue\nhere okay maya so i'm gonna\nhighlight this again i think a lot of\nlike whether you want to change or not a\nlot of this is not\nabout how you change or failing to\nchange it's about wanting to change\nbecause if i could give you a pill that\nwould make you no longer feel dumb would\nyou take it\nno i think i'd be a dick if i took that\ni don't want to be like a knower i don't\nwant to be a person that just like\nthinks that they know everything\nokay if i could take away the feeling of\nbeing dumb\nuh then yeah now that'd probably be good\ni think i don't know\ni don't know i feel like i don't know if\ni need to feel dumb to\nhave the motivation to learn things\nthere we go right so now we get to\nanother really really important\nprinciple\nwhich is a lot of the suffering caused\nby our mind is adaptive and helps us we\nbecome dependent on it\nbecause look at how far you've come\nbecause you felt\ndumb seriously i'm not kidding that's\nnot a joke\nyeah i get it right because it's like\nlook at how inadequate you felt in the\nfourth grade\nright because it's kind of interesting\nbecause you say that i wasn't\nin any advanced classes like that\ndoesn't mean you're dumb it just means\nyou're normal\nright right and and\neven then it's like and so like this has\nbeen your driving force to like\nyou know carve out your niche get an a\nplus in horsemanship\nwhen my noob friends are like still in\nschool with their head between books\nlike i'm gonna be out there like\nsaving the world and doing endoscopies\non emu's\n[ __ ] i'm gonna be someone\nyeah right and you are someone and\nyou've become someone\nand yet you carry the feeling of dumb\nwith you and i think this is all like\nfeels related to me because it's sort of\nlike\ni get the sense that if you miss out on\non an opportunity you don't have faith\nin yourself to be able to recover\nthat like this is the chance right and\nif i miss this opportunity and miss this\nopportunity like everything is going to\ncome crumbling down like you'll\nonly feel that way if you don't have\nfaith in yourself to adapt to\ncircumstances and find a way forward\nwhich i\ni think you're gonna do fine like i\nthink that everything could come\ncrashing down around you i think you'd\nbe fine\nit'd be hard psychologically but i think\nthat your actual commitment to your\nmission\nwill find a way for you to make a\ndifference in the world\nbut i think what this is going to be\nterrifying\nbut i think you have to be okay with\nbeing dumb\nwhat do you think about that\nyeah i mean it's true i uh\ni have that in i don't know how to make\nthis not a tangent\nuh make it a tangent tangents are great\nokay uh so in\nwhen you work with animals there's one\nof the things that i say all the time i\nuse the word nowhere as i feel like\nthere's learners and there's knowers\nyou know and for some reason in the\nanimal industry it's\nsuper prominent like who's a knower and\nwho's a learner\nuh you just get people that have been in\nit for 20 years 30 years 40 years\nwhatever and then you have these new\npeople or\nyounger people that are just really\nbright-eyed and really passionate and\nare just learners and they want to learn\neverything\nand they end up getting shut down by the\nknowers and then those kids burn out\ni've seen it since i've started working\nin animals\ni've seen so many burnouts at every\nsingle facility that i've worked at i've\nseen a burnout\num and so when i'm leading people at the\nrehab center because i'm on the board of\ndirectors at the rehab center so i do\nvolunteers and stuff like that and i\nalways tell them like you're don't ever\nfeel dumb you know like it's\nasking as many questions as you want you\nknow like we're all dumb like we don't\nknow what we're doing we're\nlike i'm still learning all the time i\nstill have to call people all the time\nand ask questions about these birds\nbecause i don't know this and i don't\nknow this\nlike i preach that i'm really annoying\nabout it annoying it's not the right\nword but i like\nhammer it in you know it's the same\nthing at my facility\num i i tell people who are who are\nhelping at my facility like you\nlike none of us know what we're doing so\nlike ask as many questions you want\num that's why i didn't want to make it\nto tangent because i forgot what your\nactual question was\ni think it was perfect okay so trust in\nin the connections that your neurons\nmake\nso what i'm hearing from you is that\nso there's there's a certain maya who's\nactually\nconfident in herself and is therefore\nokay being dumb\nand then there's another maya who's not\nokay being dumb\nbecause she actually doesn't believe in\nherself so she has to be smart\ntrue\nyeah and then we kind of come back to\nlike which one do you want to be\num the first one okay ideally so\nthis is this is good because i think\nwe've we've this is\nuh i've asked you a couple of times if\nyou want certain things do you want to\nbe less toxically productive you said no\nyou know do you do you want to be\nstupid you said yes i want to feel dumb\nbecause it's what drives me forward\nand i think now we've hit a point where\nlike we can get on the same page about\nlike what you\nwant which is to recognize that actually\nlike\nfeeling dumb is completely independent\nfrom the acquisition of knowledge\nand that actually if we really pay\nattention\nmost of your growth has come out of\nplaces where you sort of\nadmit your ignorance as opposed to try\nto fix it\nright like there's a difference between\nlearning to not feel dumb\nand like learning for the sake of like\nwanting to understand something\ni think the real challenge maya for you\nis that you have so many different\nconflicting things that co-exist that\nyou can be proud of yourself you know\nyou have your niche\nyou know you're good at what you do you\nknow that you're making an impact you\nknow that\nevery time you sort of support a learner\nin the face of knowers\nyou're actually having a profound\ndownstream effect on conservation\nright so and this is where i think like\nfrankly you got to let go of all of this\nlike i need to do it now otherwise like\nyou know\ndogs won't be able to eat dinner tonight\nbecause i i think is someone who's just\na little bit older and i got to play the\ni'm older card on you now which is a\ncard that i generally hate playing but\ni'm gonna i'm gonna play at this once\nwe'll see how you receive it okay if\nit works but i i think my the amount of\nimpact that you're having\nit's arrogant for you to think that\nyou know what impact that you're having\nand that's\nlike cutting back a little bit is gonna\nhave such a profound impact on the world\nlike you just don't know\nright like you have you have no idea how\nmuch these little conversations that you\nhave when you're volunteering with\nsomeone who's like excited about\nconservation like\nthat can have such a huge impact on\nthousands or tens of thousands or\nhundreds of thousands of animals lives\nright so how is the i'm older so i know\nbetter card playing with you\nwhat do you think about that and i think\nat the end of the day i mean\ni i think it's okay to be dumb it's okay\nto be inexperienced and it's\neverything's not going to come falling\napart around you\nwhat do you think about that\nit makes no sense i think that it is\nfine for everybody except for me\nbecause i like because i'm running my\nown non-profit so i feel like i need to\nbe the person that knows you know nope\num but yes sir so so i think\ndo you think if i made that statement to\nyou before you launched your non-profit\nyou would have said something else\nbefore i was started streaming i would\nhave agreed with you i think\nbut since you've started streaming it's\nyou no longer agree\nso that's interesting right so i think\nyou have to pay attention because your\nmind will come up with any justification\nthe justification will change\nand and so that's okay so you know\nwhat's it like to be the person who\ncan't slow down\ni don't know i'm proud of it and it's\nit's a lot\ni do feel like there's a lot of things\nthat i'm missing i mean i still hang out\nwith my friends and whatever\nbut i\nam not i feel like i still could be\nliving like a college kid and just like\ndoing whatever i want and like enjoying\nmy life\nbut i am i am enjoying my life but i'm\nnot\nchilling you know and i never will be\never again i don't think well it sounds\nlike you can't really afford to live a\ncollege life\nright i mean it sounds like the work\nthat you're doing is more important\nyeah yeah so that's a\ni don't know it's a good and a bad thing\ni mean but net positive right\nyeah not positive so you\nwhat choice do you really have\nno i mean i'm not going to change it i\nguess this is like\nyeah i don't know\nyeah now i feel like i've just wasted\nyour time\nbecause we just came back to i'm not\nchanging anything\nso what's the point i don't know i\nyeah i don't know do you think this is a\nwaste of time\nno i got a lot of good things from it\nbut it's also not like i'm not leaving\nwith like a big like i'm gonna do this\nthis this\nand make this change and then be better\nlike\nit's much more abstract than that which\nis good\nbut i i think that's what you like go\nfor\nyou go for different things i think you\nprobably don't care or not not that you\ndon't care but you're like\ni don't think that you thought it was a\nwaste of time why don't\nwhy wouldn't i why do i why do you think\ni don't think this is a waste of time\nwell one because you're polite and two\num like you wouldn't be like yeah why\nyou just wasted my time\num but no we talked about some cool\nstuff i made some cool connections\num in here and\ni think i felt more i felt bad about the\ntoxic productivity thing\nmore than anything else until now i\ndon't\nlove it but i also realize that it's\nhelped me a lot instead of just being\nlike why am i like this\nso that's a good thing\ndo you think that i want you to change\nno\ni don't know do you\nlet me think about that for a second\nokay\ni was trying to help you change\num but it took me a little while to\nrealize that you\ndon't want to change\nand so that's okay\ni'm not disappointed in that and i think\nthat one of the most important steps\nthat we can take\nbecause you came in and you said this\nthing is bad\nand now we're saying this thing is good\nno i still think it's bad\nbut i also think it's good now and\nbefore i didn't think it was good at all\nokay so\nand that's a win\nyeah okay so so here's what i'll share\nwith you maya i think that\num i know it sounds weird but you came\nin thinking that toxic productivity is\nbad and now you think that toxic\nproductivity is good\nand i think that's a win too okay do you\nand there's a simple reason for that\nwhich is\nyou can come in and say i want to change\nand then i can try to help you change\nand what are you going to do\nwhen i try to help you change\nif we were actually like if we were if\nyou were like my therapist or something\nwe're doing this weekly and you're like\nyou got to do like you got to relax you\ngot to i'd just be frustrated\nyeah i'd be like why are you telling me\nto not do as many things as i want to do\nyep right so so this is where like you\ncame here and you said toxic\nproductivity is bad\nand then for a little while we played\nthe game of okay let's see if we can get\nyou to change and i think we came to a\nvery important revelation\nbecause that toxic productivity is bad\nbut it also is good it comes with a\nprice it's double-edged sword\nyou know it's like eating a spicy curry\nlike it's good going down but it ain't\ngonna be pleasant coming out\nyou know it's like you gotta you gotta\npay the price right\nyeah and um or in the case of the emu\nlike oh that ring looks so shiny it's\ngonna be so tasty\nit's gonna help me digest so i i i think\noddly enough maya so like the first step\nis being aware of like\nwhat something does for you right\nbecause i think if i tried to make you\nchange\nthen you would have just pushed back\nover and over and over again\nso i do think it's actually a success\nand this is for everyone out there who's\nlistening like a lot of times\nwe have a behavior that we think\nshould change and we play the friend\ngame with ourselves\nright and we're like oh what would i\ntell my friend and i'd tell them this\nbut if you have a behavior that you\nwould tell a friend something and you\ndon't listen to it at all\nyou don't you know that's the game that\nyou lose all the time\nthat's a sign that you really need to\nunderstand like what your motivations\nare\nbecause until you like understand that\nyou actually don't want it to change\nit's never going to change interestingly\nenough\nknowing that you don't want it to change\nis actually a step forward\nit's better than pretending you want it\nto change yeah and not actually want to\nget to change\n[Music]\nand i i know it sounds crazy but i think\nit's going to be easier for you to relax\nwhen you go to the hotel room\nyeah i think you're right\ni'm very confused on why but i i do\nagree with you\nright so i i think it's so i think just\nunderstand that you're not really ready\nto change your toxic productivity\nquite yet and that's okay that there's a\nlot writing on there that you still have\na lot to prove\nso be it you're not quite a hundred\npercent confident in yourself\neven though you clearly know that you\nhave a lot to be proud of\nthat while you are undereducated\ncompared to all of these experts these\nexperts are coming onto your podcast\nand you clearly have something to offer\nthe world and you're really good at\norganizing and putting all the stuff i\nthink you know all these things about\nyourself\nand coexisting with that is this sort of\nlike\ni'm dumb everything is going to come\nfalling apart i'm going to peak\neventually\nthe platform will be destroyed and then\ni don't know who i'm going to be don't\nworry dr k i won't kill myself but like\ni'm going to be in nothing\nthat is holding on to life for an\nunclear reason\nand that both of those things can\ncoexist like that's totally cool we'll\ntake both\nof them what do you think about that\nyeah i think that makes sense i don't\nhave very much to say about it but i do\nlike i i am understanding what you're\nsaying yeah\nbut if i elaborated i'd just be\nrepeating back what you said so\ni get the sense that we're wrapping up\nyeah i don't know i don't have other\nthings to to talk about\nreally um\nyeah i mean is there something that you\nwant to discuss no no i it's just i\ni think i think um i sort of signaled\ni got the sense that we had reached a\ngood stopping point when you said\nsomething like this has been a waste of\nyour time\nhonestly i'm also looking at the time\nbecause they told me that you have a\ncommitment at\nfor my time so i was also like\nah or yeah i mean that's that's my\ncommitment to manage you don't have to\nworry about it yeah\nbut um you know good luck with your\nstuff i mean do you want to tell us like\nis there somewhere that we can\ngo to learn more about your work or\nanything like that\nyeah um in my chat you can do command\nalveos if you want um it's\na-l-v-e-u-s sanctuary on all platforms\nso we do have a twitch channel we\nhaven't done anything on it um but\ntwitter instagram tick-tock\nhow did you come up with the name it's a\nnot a direct translation but it's\nreservoir in latin\nand my thing on my podcast is always\nsaying that switches on tapped reservoir\nfor doing good so that's cool\nyeah well thank you very much for coming\non do you have any questions for me i\ndon't mean to boot you or anything but\ni sort of feel like we're at a good\nstopping point and we've learned\nsomething today and that it may be a\nlittle bit easier for you to relax\nyeah um i don't think so i don't think i\nhave any questions\ni do i do feel bad i feel like i i feel\nlike i was like\ni just like walled you like i feel like\nyou're trying to help and i was just\nlike\ni got it like i'm good i'm just gonna\nkeep doing what i'm doing but i don't\nknow i need to think about it more\noffstream probably i i think it's okay\nto do that\nokay i'm not do you get the sense that\ni'm disappointed or frustrated with you\nno okay yeah i i i think you actually\ndid a good job of pointing out sometimes\npeople like oh my god dr k\ni'm gonna change everything about my\nlife and fix me right\nno that's not actually how change\nhappens and i think sometimes we\nactually do a disservice because that's\nwhat we\nmake it seem like change is like i think\nyou actually\nillustrated how change really is\nway more than some of our more like\nhistrionic streams right because there's\na lot of resistance it's a slow process\nthat like you come in pretending that\nyou want to change and you actually\ndon't\nand part of that i think the reason that\nyou're more willing to\ngive up toxic productivity now is like\nit's easy it's\nit's hard to give up that which you\ndon't know has value\nbecause what you really have to do maya\nis sacrifice\nyour productivity you have to give\nsomething up to relax\nand i don't think you're ready to make\nthat sacrifice yet\nno which is fine\nokay sweet good luck and make the world\na better place\nall right thank you so much i appreciate\nit you're welcome bye all right i'll\ntalk to you\nokay\nsneaky sneaky"
