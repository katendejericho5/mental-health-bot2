    "transcript": "how does one keep realistic expectations\nstandards for love\ni didn't grow up with any healthy\nexamples of love and have a hard time\nwith the post honeymoon\nperiod of a relationship great question\ni think it's a good question too\num i didn't i i have never like i didn't\ngrow up seeing\na couple like us i think our\nability to\ncreate the thing that we wanted to\ncreate in our life\nis kind of the only reason why we have\nour relationship\ni kind of zoned out it's hard for me to\nattend to things\nnot to lean on you you have to carry\nfrom here on out\noh from here\n[Laughter]\num what i was saying\nso did you have any great examples of\nrelationships when you were growing up\nnothing like ours exactly i don't think\nyou have to\nsee it to do it\nso it's not about realistic it's about\nyour own ability to create the thing\nthat you want\nyeah because that's what's realistic\nright it's like expectation is based on\neverything\noutside of you but here's the thing not\nreal you are a unique person\nlike your partner is a unique person and\nthe relationship that the two of you\nhave has never existed in the history of\nhuman\nhumanity so\nyou know don't let your expectations\nget in the way there's something weird\nabout this isn't there\nall right back to this so so this is the\nthing\ni i mean look so i think both my wife\nand i have had\nyou know to a certain degree like\nhealthy parents\num and at the same time i think you know\nyou have to remember that like\nlike i was saying you have never existed\nbefore your partner has never existed\nbefore y'all's relationship has never\nexisted before\nso i think creating a healthy\nrelationship is recognizing that like\nthis is an\nentirely new game that's being played\nand there's only so much you can\nunderstand and learn\nfrom prior games that have existed so\nthis is where you know\nwhat i would really advocate for is like\nyou know what are realistic expectations\nthat's a conversation you need to have\nwith your partner\nthis is what i want from the\nrelationship this is what you want from\nthe relationship\ncan i expect and rely on you to provide\nme with this thing that you don't want\nto give me but that i want\nand ultimately like communication is the\nmost important thing\nbecause it's like you guys are playing a\nmultiplayer game but if you're not\ncommunicating then it's like you're just\njust all in your head\nso like learn how to talk to each other\num and when you say i have a hard time\nwith post honeymoon periods of the\nrelationship yeah like you and everyone\nelse because\nthe honeymoon period is like when your\nhormones are going great and it's like\noh my god i love you so much\nand then it's like how are we going to\npay the internet bill\nyou know what are we going to about\nfinances what are we going to do about\nkids where are we going to live how are\nwe going to deal with rent\nthose are all the things that are boring\nand terrible\nand are also like you know part of the\npart of a relationship i mean depending\non what kind of relationship you have\nright and so i'd say that set your own\nexpectations\ndetermine your own standards of love\nlike don't rely on\nwhether it's realistic or not like f\nthat\ni mean there have been so many times\nwhere ruthie and i have been like oh my\ngod like this is\nunrealistic what we're doing and i was\nlike screw that\nand she was too i was like we're not\nrealistic like we don't do things like\nother people we're not\nyou know we're not the regular humans\nwe're us\nand it's it's our lifetime of fun so\nthis is what we're gonna do even if it's\na bad idea\nand so the cool thing about a\nrelationship is that ultimately you're\nthe one that gets to write the rules\nlike you and your partner get to write\nthe rules together and you guys write\nwhatever rules you want\nif like you know every friday is crazy\nfun friday we're like no one gets to\nwear clothes like that's fine\nright you know you have to watch out\nabout you know work and things like that\nbut you guys get to determine the rules\nyou get to determine what are realistic\nexpectations and whether they're\nrealistic or unrealistic i think the\nbest parts\nof our relationships are the things\nwhere we've had unrealistic expectations\nand we've managed to fulfill them anyway\nit's like i have a completely\nunrealistic expectation\nand it's like cool let's make that\nhappen\ni want spicy puffy cheetos and\nmargaritas\nand\nlike a new tv show and you do it because\nyou're the best\nand she's like oh my god is this hard\nfor you and i'm like of course it's hard\nfor me\nbut we shouldn't let that get in the way\nof your indulgent enjoyment"
