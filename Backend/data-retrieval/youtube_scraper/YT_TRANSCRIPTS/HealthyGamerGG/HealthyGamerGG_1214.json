    "transcript": "zach this may sound kind of weird but\nlike\ni'm kind of hearing that you're not\nreally afraid of\ni know it sounds weird yeah yeah go on\nyou're not really afraid of death\ni i think what what bothers you it\nsounds to me is actually your inability\nto deal with death\nawesome okay yeah things have been uh\nthey've been a little bit up and down\nbut uh it's been i guess all right i\nmean\nthe new games are getting released that\ni'm excited to play so that's at least\none positive right\nyeah what what are you looking forward\nto playing uh burning crusade uh\nunfortunately it's getting released a\nbit earlier than i would have\nhoped for and a few other games ashes of\ncreation\nnew world other mmos basically\nyeah new world is um amazon games as mmo\nyeah\nyeah it is coming out\nuh i actually don't know i think it's\naugust\nokay is there like a beta or yeah there\nwas we played it for a while\nand um the game was fun for like three\ndays and it sucked\nand so i'm hoping that when the game\nactually comes out it'll be fun for at\nleast five\npretty much yeah\nit's it's gaming in 2021 what can i say\nwhat is gaming in 2021 uh whenever they\ntry to milk you out of all the money\npossible while simultaneously putting in\nthe littlest amount of effort possible\nyeah i was pretty excited about magic\nlegends i don't know if you tried\ni i didn't play it but i played match\nwith the gathering a lot whenever i was\nyounger so uh\ni heard about it um what did you hear\nuh i i just heard it was an arpg and i\ndidn't hear any good or bad things about\nit i just heard\npeople said it came out and then i never\nheard about it again so you can kind of\nput two and two together there and uh\nyeah yeah i thought it was super cool\nlike the the yeah the conceptual\ndesign behind the game i was super\nexcited about like the idea is that\nyou've got like a deck right so it's\nsort of like a deck builder\nbut it's like an arpg format so you can\nhave like four skills\nat any given time but once you use a\ncard you like\nlose the spell and it goes back into\nyour and then you have to like reshuffle\nand stuff\nso there's like a lot of deck building\nand stuff\nseems like a super cool arpg um\ni was uh i was always hoping that like i\nmean i\npaid a lot of attention to magic like\nfor many years whenever i played it i\nwas in like high school and in the\ncollege\nso like any time that something cool\nlike that happens i'll kind of be\ninterested in it but i just kind of\nexpected to hear more about it later and\ni just never did\nso you know that's usually the way it\ngoes yeah i heard\nthat um you know i think what may have\nhappened is\nthere was like a there's like there were\nfour classes and there's a fifth class\nthat you can unlock\num but the the class is only unlockable\nthrough microtransactions\nand then on top of that the micro\ntransactions are rng so the class is a\ndrop from a loot box\nso people were people were spending like\n500\nand still like\nnot getting the class see that's\nuh like i remember apex legend said\nsomething like that\nand it was just like you you got a\nlittle dagger for\none of the characters but like this is a\nwhole class and it's 500\nthat's exactly the [ __ ] that i'm talking\nabout man like i i said that uh\ni said a game should make you want to\nwaste your time and not just waste your\ntime\nand i feel like all the games now they\ndon't just waste your time they waste\nyour time and your money\nit's just it's sad yeah man\nyeah i feel like the uh i don't know\nlike maybe maybe it's like i'm getting\nolder or something\nbut like the the allure to it and the\nsmoke and mirrors behind the ways that\nthey keep you playing the game\nare pretty much just mirrors now you can\njust see right it's just right there\nyeah yeah\num so you said you're you're excited\nabout burning crusade\nyeah yeah wow classic burn include\ncrusade right right\nyeah yeah that's right and then you\nyou've been playing a lot of shadow\nlands recently or\nyeah yeah how do you feel about\nshadowlands not good\nuh i feel like uh you know i've played a\ngame for 15 years\nand uh the people that are running the\ngame are ruining it\nand i feel like i'm wasting my time\nplaying it for the first time\nin like 15 years it's sad\nhow are they ruining it uh by just not\nknowing\ni i don't think they're doing what i\nwhat i would do i think they're just not\nreally putting\nin the effort that they need to i think\nthey're just trying to\nkind of compel people to play the game\nlonger rather than enjoy the game\nif that makes sense yeah i love your way\nwith language like\ncompel versus enjoy\nyes yes and then you said also that\na game should make you want to waste\nyour time not yet\nyeah it shouldn't just waste your yeah\nyeah you want to spend all day playing\nthe game not you have to\nyeah and that's the way it used to be\nand like i always wonder right it's like\nis this because i'm older\nis it because the game is worse and it's\nlike you can never really dissect the\ntwo\nbecause you can't you know experience\nthem in like some sort of controlled\nenvironment\nbut it does feel a lot different than it\ndoes that it did\nyou can't experience them in a\ncontrolled environment\ncan you say a little bit more about that\nwell yeah yeah so like for example\nif i go and i i play a game\nthat i used to play whenever i was a kid\ni i can't really go back and experience\nthat for the first time\nit's like the you can never step in the\nsame river twice right and\nit's kind of the same paradigm where if\ni go back\nand i play super mario world for the\n800th time\nit's not gonna be the same experience as\ni had whenever i was five years old\nplaying it and getting upset and mad\nbecause i couldn't beat the game\nso it's like is it because is the\nattachment to the games and the drive to\nplay them\ndiminishing because of the quality of\nthe games or is it diminishing because\nof a different point in my life you see\nwhat i mean\nyeah i'm wondering if you're turning\ninto a boomer\nme too right me too\nyeah right back in the day\nback in my day we didn't have any micro\ntransactions it was\njust the good times you bought the game\nfrom blockbuster and you took it home\nand you played it for three days\nthat's that's how it was for me too let\nme tell you what what happened is you'd\ngo to a game and you'd purchase it\nimagine that the game was yours you\ndidn't need none internet\nno to play it it was it was great\nit really was yeah i didn't need to be\na single-player game didn't need to be\nconnected to their multiplayer server i\ncould just play it by myself\nwhen my cow stepped on my ethernet cable\ni could just keep playing what the\nhell's a battle pass\ni never heard of that yeah i know i know\nall too damn well it's sad\ni don't know where it's gonna go yeah\nman but yeah\nmight be it might just be being a boomer\ni i don't know i think that's a that's a\nbig part of it at least\nyeah so i i i kind of feel that way too\nlike i wonder if it's the boomer within\nme but i i do feel like um\nwhat's happening kind of like what you i\nthink you captured it well that\na lot of game designers are trying to\nmake a game that's com like you know\nthat you're compelled to play as opposed\nto enjoyable\num can i just share like a bizarre\nexperience i had like about a year ago\nabsolutely so i was at um\nlike uh so i i used to be in boston and\nand sometimes i would go to like\nbusiness networking events\nooh and and so sometimes like at these\nbusiness networking events like\num you know you'd meet people who are\nlike you know in different industries\nand so like i met like this mba\nwho was interested in the gaming\nindustry he was like yeah like i'm\nyou know i'm i'm like i i work in the\ngaming industry and i was like awesome\nwhat games do you like and he was like\noh i don't like games i don't play them\ni was like what interests you and you\nthink he was like oh like you know i\nthink that the monetization\nopportunities are like really fantastic\ni was like no yeah yeah he works at\nactivision now i i\ni know who that is yeah i was like i was\nlike this is they actually exist\nlike people are and you know what it\nreminds me of actually is\nis can i tell you another random story i\nguess i'm the one telling stories today\nso when i was uh training to become a\npsychiatrist i i had this eye-opening\nlecture from this\nabsolutely um brilliant guy\nand his name is dr freuden reich and so\nwe were we were talking about you know\nmedicine and the practice of medicine\nwithin like\nmedicine and healthcare so you know i'm\na doctor i practice medicine\nbut in my job it's like healthcare\nthere's like a hospital there's\ninsurance there's billing there's\nadministration\nyou know all this kind of stuff and he's\nlike you know if you don't like\nyour job and you don't like healthcare\nthe problem\nis that you know 20 years ago a hospital\nsystem had something called the forms\ncommittee\ncan you imagine what the forms committee\ndoes\nuh they probably process forms\nyes absolutely that's literally it yeah\nso they\nprocess forms and and the committee\nactually makes the forms\nso there's a group of people who decides\nwhat are the forms that people need to\nfill out\nand when when the forms committee was\nlaunched they asked doctors to be a part\nof it\nand can you imagine what the doctors\nsaid no\nplease no absolutely we hate we hate\npaperwork we hate it i don't want to i\ndidn't go to medical school\nand train for seven years to become a\nneurosurgeon\nand devote over a decade of my life so i\ncould figure out\nwhat forms need to be filled out i did\nit to do neurosurgery on people with\nbrain cancer\nand so there were no doctors on the\nforms committee\nand then then what happened is all these\npeople decided\nwhich forms the neurosurgeon has to fill\nout\nand then we lost the battle and this is\nwhat's happening in the gaming industry\nnow is that like you know we're\nyou know we've got people who aren't\ngamers who are designing video games\nthat's just about right uh it's p\nand and they just necessitate a need for\nthemselves because like\nif they they'll always come out with new\nforms or new things that you have to do\nbecause they don't want to you know show\nhow useless they are\ni think that happens a lot too it's like\nthey're kind of creating\nis creating a problem and then\npresenting themselves as a solution for\nit and i think that happens with a lot\nof games too\ncan you share a little bit more about\nthat how do you how do you know that\nuh i mean like it's a lot of things i\nthink that\nreally like one example of this is like\nin the game i play a lot\nworld of warcraft like they will release\nlike some sort of\nyou know like let's say it's a way to\nget really good armor or to like make\nyour legendary weapons or something like\nthat\nand you will have to repeat a process\nover and over and over in a way that is\ntransparently\njust a method of extending your play\ntime\nrather than making you enjoy the content\nso\nyou do this over and over and over and\nthen later on like maybe a year later\nthey will make it easier in the way that\npeople initially wanted it to be\none year ago and it's just\nit's just crazy like it and and like it\nit\nas i said it kind of lifts the it it\npulls the curtain away and you can just\nsee all the machinery in the back\nit's like that the wizard of oz right\nyou just see him in the in the little\nroom broadcasting\nand it's no longer this like experience\nthat you have\nthe willing suspension of disbelief is\nremoved\nand you're just stuck there like a rat\nin a maze\nit sucks it sounds terrifying\ni mean you know i i feel like i gotta\nshare this i'm hopeful though\nso i i think like at the end of the day\nlike did you play hades\ni played it for maybe 20 minutes\ni had fun for those 20 minutes though so\ni i think hades is a great example like\ni absolutely love the game and i think\nit's like\nan example what i'm terrified of is um\nthe aaa clones of hades oh\nyeah because they're coming oh no doubt\ni mean absolutely and like the game it's\nnot like i stopped playing it because i\ndidn't want to i just\nstopped playing because i had to go back\nto streaming and that that's why\nand i haven't really had time to play it\nbut yeah it was a really fun game i\nenjoyed it it was\nit was very clean it was very well\ndesigned and\nthere's some things that are just kind\nof missing did you play valheim i kind\nof got the same experience with that\ni love valenheim yeah yeah and that's\nsomething made by five people right and\nyeah\nit just feels like uh you know these big\ngame companies\ni told people that they're uh instead of\ntoo big to fail it's too big to\nto succeed that's really the way i feel\nit's like they're\nit takes them forever to do anything\nit's like over produced and they have\nlike this fixation\non you know the lighting on a\ncharacter's nose\nrather than the gameplay that everybody\ngoes with\nyeah i remember hearing about dragon age\norigins\nthree yeah so i don't know if you played\nthe original dragon age but the\nuh uh original dragon age oh\nwe just got a thousand dollar donation\nholy [ __ ]\nand it seems like um as someone who\nstruggles with mental health what you're\ndoing is invaluable thank you\ni don't know so the funny thing now is\nlike i\ni don't know if that person is talking\nabout what we're talking about now\nyeah it's just like a general statement\nyeah it so now i'm genuinely confused\nwhether\nyou know talking about how depressing\nand predatory the video game landscape\nnow\nis is is like with the public good that\nwe're doing or is it when we talk about\nlike\ndepression and anxiety and and learning\nto love yourself\nit's probably just it's like somebody is\nsaying it besides them\nand it's like okay you know there's a\nguy that graduated from harvard who\nthinks the same damn thing that i did\ni'm not crazy you know i think that's\nreally what it is i\ni remember every time that i hear\nsomebody else saying what you're saying\nit always is a little bit validating for\nme too\nyeah okay well thank you very much for\nthe support folks\num so you know just a couple other\nthings like i i think that like\nyou know i hear what you're saying in\nterms of activision being predatory and\nwhatnot but like\npart of the thing though uh asman is i i\nstill think that like these\nthese triple a game companies like\nactually make really amazing games\nlike i loved warcraft 3 loved starcraft\nsc2 was like okay\nyeah and like you know wow was amazing i\nthink overwatch is like genuinely like a\nvery good game\num you know people may disagree but like\ni think a lot of the you know the big\nevil people actually do make really\namazing games\ni i agree but i think that it's a very\nsad state of affairs that most of the\nexamples that you gave were over 10\nyears ago\nbut we'll say that i'm sure we'll say\nthat about diablo immortal right\nwon't we add that to the list um\ni i think that diablo yeah that's a\nthat's a tough one isn't it that's a\nvery tough one\nand like that's one of the things i just\nwish they made a a pc port for it i'd\nplay it if it was on the pc just see\nwhat it's like but um\nthey don't even do that for some reason\ni have no idea why\nyeah yeah so are we just talking about\nare we like\nreminiscing well it's a metaphor right\nbecause\nthe games are like it's what i spend my\ntime doing\nand it's like i've played games all my\nlife\nand i enjoy them and i don't really\nenjoy them as much now and\nit's like why is that is it because i'm\nolder is it because the games are worse\nit's\nand that's what i'm in it's like hard to\ndecide it's like kind of\nlike i'm 30 now and i i tell my i say\nthat all the time\nbecause i still can't even come to terms\nwith it it's scary\nand i'm i've done this for\nlike basically i've streamed and sat in\nmy room all day every day and played\nvideo games for\npretty much my whole adult life and\ni've loved it the whole time it's it's\nbeen absolutely amazing\nbut it feels like it's coming to an end\nit feels like it's\nit's like ending in a way i don't know\nhow i can really describe it\nit's sad\ncan i just sit with that for a second\nyou know when you say that what comes to\nmind have you played dark souls\nmany times so you know like the story\nbehind dark souls which is that the\nflame is going out\nyeah that's sort of like the image that\ni get\nuh yeah i mean i hope i don't end up\nlike king gwen\nbut yeah i could see that uh absolutely\nyeah it's uh and i think it's just also\nlike i've kind of\ndone and i look like quinn\nlook if i get a lot if my hair is\ngetting longer and i've gotten a few\ngray hairs\nyeah man it's getting there\nyeah that's right i oh my god that's\nscary to think\nand i did actually choose that ending\ntoo oh no\nso yeah i mean it's it's definitely\nscary because like i feel like i've done\npretty much everything that i\nwanted to do and i've accomplished a lot\nof things i've wanted to do\nand it's like kind of i'm aimless in a\nway because\ni don't have the same motivation to\nreally do anything like i i do\nyou know i go through the same motions\nand i do the same stuff but it's not\nwith the same level\nof enthusiastic uh\ndeterministic it's like determinism that\ni used to have\nit's just kind of i'm doing it because\nit's what i like doing\nand it's what i do it's not even really\nwhat i like doing it's what i do\nand it's weird for me to think back\nand think that it's been 10 years that\ni've been doing this\nand i don't i i don't ever\nwant it to end but it is\nit's like i can't stop getting older i\ncan't stop\nuh that this happening and i feel like\nalso\nlike i'm i'll be honest i'm sure you\nprobably have had the same feeling like\nyou ever play a game that you were\nreally good at whenever you were a kid\nand now you suck at it\nyes yeah so i've also done the opposite\nwhere there were games that i used to\nthink were really hard and i go back and\nplay them now and i was like i don't\nunderstand\nhow i ever you know\nhad difficulty with this game i i\nunderstand that a lot yeah there's a\nlittle bit of those too especially some\nsuper nintendo games\nyeah i was a dumb ass kid i had ny deal\nand and uh yeah it's interesting i think\nthe game that comes to mind the most\nis um dota so i've been playing dota for\nover a decade\nand like i was bad at dota and then for\na while i was like pretty good at dota\nlike i was probably like\nyou know somewhere in the top 10 or 20\nof the player base\nyeah and then you know like respectable\nlike nowhere near pro\nbut like respectable and now i'm in like\nthe bottom\n50 percent and and that yeah\nand i've been one of these guys that\nlike no matter what game like you know\nhow they're like some people are just\ngood at games right and like you can\nplay\nyou pick up any game and within you know\nmonth of playing it you'll be like\nin the top twenty percent of the player\nbase yeah\nand yeah there were always the noobs\nthat you would prey on\nthe game after game after game\nabsolutely you play the player those\npeople for six months they're gonna just\nthey're never gonna get better yep and i\nfeel like\ni'm transitioning into that noob stage\nyeah that's that's what i see\nit's happening yeah it's uh\nyeah good no go go for it\num well that's kind of the way that i\nfeel right is that\nit's like i feel like i'm losing that\nthing that i was i was good at\nand i'm not good at it really that much\nanymore\nand it's just kind of like for a lot of\npeople\nit's not like it wouldn't really matter\nyou know what i mean because it's just\nit's just a video game\nbut i think what really hits me hard\nwith it is like thinking that\nit's like something as like a greater\nthing like if i'm just not good at the\ngame anymore it's whatever\nbut if i'm not good at the game anymore\nbecause i'm getting older that's scary\nwhat's scary about that because whenever\nyou get older you die\nis that what you feel like you're doing\nwell i mean everybody is you're doing it\nall the time\ni mean like of course to an extent yeah\nit just feels like uh\nuh it feels like i\nlike there aren't really as many good\nthings to look forward to anymore\nif that makes sense how long have you\nfelt that way\ni don't know maybe three years two years\nand so it sounds to me like you're kind\nof living your life on autopilot\ni mean in a way yeah or it's like kind\nof\nyou're waiting for the next thing to go\nwrong\nthat's\nthat caught me off guard that's not what\ni was expecting you to say\nwhat do you mean you're waiting has a\nlot gone wrong\nyeah i mean well it's not it's not\nsomething that just happens overnight\nuh it's just something that kind of it's\neither like a slow deterioration\nor it could be something that just kind\nof happens right of course\nand it's one of those things where it's\nkind of hard to pinpoint when it happens\nbut if you go back and you look two\nyears like before\nlike in in the past you'd see that\nthings are clearly better\nand there was no real day where things\nchanged but\nit was just like a slow decay\nyeah that sounds bleak how are things\nfor you\nhow how were things for you three years\nago\nuh probably uh a little bit better\nright i mean i had a classic wild look\nforward to uh that was cool\nand um then uh i mean\nit's like a lot of little things right\nbecause back then i was like really\nexcited about\nuh doing my stream and and being very\nsuccessful with my stream and i still\ncare about that a lot but like\nat that time i didn't i never had the\nsuccess that i have now\nso it wasn't like i still had that to\nwork towards\nif that makes sense mm-hmm so yeah\nyou had a goal yeah i had to go i have\nno goals\num like i have like i guess i mean to an\nextent i do\nbut the goals that i used to always have\nlike this might sound insane okay\nbut i used to honestly wake up in the\nmorning and feel\ncompletely like fulfilled and satisfied\nwith the idea that i'm going to play\nworld of warcraft today\nand i'm going to farm for some item that\ni want and i'm going to feel great about\nit and i'm going to go to bed that night\nand i'm going to feel like a winner\nand i used to really feel that way it\nwas great and\nnow it's just not the same\nhow do you feel now like i wasted my\ndamn time\nlike that's that's the way i feel it's\nalways my i feel like i don't know what\nto what to do\ni i don't know if i like what what it is\nand i've tried to find like other things\ni made an org\ncompany with people friends of mine and\nthat's going really well it's gone\nactually\nsurprisingly well and uh that's been\ngreat\nbut there needs to be something for me\npersonally\nthat i have to work towards can you tell\nme about the org\nyeah uh basically i i made an\norganization called uh\notk one true king with uh myself uh s\nfan you know s fend ms kiff\nuh tips out and my other friend wrench\nwe brought on nick pollam\nnmp as well and uh we have people that\nwe obviously hire\nand we put on different events and we\njust kind of make content together\noh interesting it stands for one tree\nking one\nking yeah i just i thought it was one\nturn kill\num so we actually uh the funny thing\nabout that\nis uh we actually found out it also\nstands for over the knee which is a\nsexual fetish\nwe didn't know that until after we\nannounced the org okay\nlittle fun uh fun little what is it rule\n42\ni think anything can be 32 32 anything\ncan be a sexual fetish right\num yeah we actually thought about as a\njoke selling paddles\n[Laughter]\nso we'll see but yeah it's uh i i think\nthat was like that's kind of like a next\nstep thing for me too right is to kind\nof have that thing that you can kind of\nwork on\nbeyond just playing video games and\nbeyond that something that's kind of\nbigger than yourself and\nuh that that has been it's been very\nstressful for me to have to do that\nand um especially as somebody who is uh\npretty much a hermit i like being alone\nall the time and now i have to\ntalk to people all the time for those\ndifferent things and it's it's good but\nit's also exhausting for a person who\nlikes to be alone\nyou want me to call you asman gold asman\nor or what\nwe just do zach it's fine okay zach can\ni have a second to think\nyeah sure\num do you mind if i ask you us i'm just\ndebating this because there's something\nthat my mind is curious about um\nbut i'm wondering if maybe like asking\nthis question is embarrassing uh i was\ndebating maybe asking it to you\nin private but it's something that you\nhad publicly spoken about\non stream before and i find myself kind\nof wondering\nyeah did you ever go see that dentist\nand get your teeth taken care of\nyeah uh i did i still need to get more\nof them taken care of absolutely uh it\ntakes me uh\nlike my teeth are [ __ ] up right and so\nthere's a lot of work that i need to\nhave done\nand uh with covet and everything i have\nbeen a little bit slower on doing it but\nyes i've had a number of my teeth uh\nfixed and taken care of\nnow i have to do i think probably two or\nthree more visits\ni don't like you about that uh well\nthere's a funny thing about that\nso whenever i was younger i used to\nalways eat my food really fast and then\nit would make me\nsick to my stomach because i ate my food\nso fast and then all my teeth fell out\nand i couldn't do it anymore and i\nstopped getting sick after eating my\nfood\nand now that i got my teeth back i'm\neating my food again and i'm getting\nsick again\nso uh yeah that's basically where we're\nat\nand uh i i there's i don't know there i\ndon't know if there's really\na moral to that story or anything like\nthat but it's basically uh\nit's basically what it is and it's not\nlike i it's not like an eating disorder\ni just eat food very fast right i just\nwant to eat the food like\neating food is like a it's like a daily\nquest in a video game where like i just\nwant to get it out of the way as fast as\ni can so i can move on to\nactually playing daily quests in video\ngames\nthat's basically yeah yeah get my get my\nrl daily quests out of the way so that\nyou can do my virtual dailies\nyeah a min max and uh you know sometimes\nit\nit doesn't turn out very well but yeah i\nmean i uh\ni i do i i do i'm glad that i've\ni've gotten them fixed more and uh it's\nkind of\nit was really bad like there were a few\ntimes where i stopped streaming because\none of my teeth\nbroke or fell out or something like that\nuh and\nyou could tell whenever i was streaming\nand it just kind of\nthere are a lot of things that i have no\nproblem with people\nlooking at me and seeing but that was\none of them that was just a little bit\ntoo much\nokay so i'm gonna just kind of think out\nloud for a second because i'm noticing\nyou know potentially a direction of this\nconversation that's a little bit\naligned with what we usually do so i\nknow we started talking about about like\nyou know gaming and\nand being you know boomers and back in\nthe day like\nyou know you had back in the day like\nyou didn't have a server that gave you\nmatchmaking you had to go out and find\nyour match yourself\nbut you had to make it you had to make\nfriends yeah and it was great\nit was you had to create a custom lobby\nand you never knew\nwho would show up and whether they would\nbe a hacker and there was no\nthere's no reporting system for hackers\nxbox live didn't give a [ __ ] yeah yeah\ni remember all too well so we kind of\nstarted out there and i'm noticing that\nyou're someone who's quite\ndriven and that you used to look forward\nto the day\nlike you'd wake up and you'd play wow\nand you'd really enjoy it and it was\nlike it was an exciting and fulfilling\nlife\nyou were also somewhat you know skilled\nor lucky and became like\nyou know successful through that um yeah\nand and then like and then just like in\nin the world of dark souls like you know\nthere's only a limited amount of fuel\nyeah\nand the flame starts to dim and then\nlike now what i'm kind of hearing from\nyou is like\nyou don't have goals like you don't have\nthat zest that used to drive you\nwell there's yeah i was gonna say\nthere's nothing really to look forward\nto\nin the same way that they used to be so\num great point i'll i'll kind of\nget to that in a second um so so\nand then like you even tried stuff right\nlike you've heard from the others\nthat oh if you're like tired of getting\ngaming like make an\norg like do something else like set like\ncome up with a new goal for yourself\nand you're like cool let's do this and\nthen the interesting thing is that\nwhat i'm hearing you say is that it\nactually checked a lot of the boxes\nyeah it gave you something to work\ntowards working towards success it\nsounds like it's actually fun\nbut there's still something like missing\nit's sort of like\nyou know it's it's kind of like a puff\npastry that's kind of good but like\nempty on the inside\nyeah it's like it's like an eclair and\nthere's no cream in the middle\nyeah right and and so and so this is\nwhere i\nthink like maybe what we need to uh oh\nwe're getting donations sorry\num i think what we want to talk about\ntoday is like\ngoals and the nature of fulfillment yeah\nand\nand i'm also curious are you afraid of\ndying\nyes yes very much so\nvery very much so it's uh it's the same\nas like the uh\nthe the gray hairs or you know i go get\ngray hairs it's like the memento mori of\nit and it\ni i have to i pull them out of my beard\ni cut them out of my beard because it\njust freaks me out\nit totally freaks me out and like i i'm\nso scared of it\nokay absolutely so i i think we can\nwe can this is something i can work with\nyeah uh so zack i'm i'm\ni'm actually like i feel pretty good\nthat that this is something that\nyou can overcome like\ni know i know the best way that i've\ni've\nbeen able to overcome it is by reminding\nmyself\nthat i'm just a very intelligent monkey\nand i have no idea how the world\nand the [ __ ] the inner workings of\nthe universe really exist\nright like i have no idea what i'm\ntalking about just sit back\nshut up and enjoy the ride like that's\nbeen the best way\nthat i've learned to cope with it\nyeah so what that sounds like a good\ncoping mechanism\nbut it sounds like a coping mechanism\nnot a fix\nokay so there's a part of me that says\nlike\nwhy not just learn how the universe\nworks\nbecause you i i don't think you can\npierce the veil i don't i don't think\npeople can\ni i don't think it's possible it's the\nsame as like i don't think a uh\nyou know how like an ant couldn't learn\nphysics i don't think people can do it\nand i think that's a completely\nreasonable\nexperience i mean a completely\nreasonable view\nand i think that you know you're not\ngoing to understand\nthat people can pierce the veil until\nyou pierce the veil\nyeah um i mean i guess that's a good way\nto say it i mean people didn't know\nthere was fire until they made fire they\ndidn't know there was electricity until\nthat happened\nyeah and so this is where i i think the\ninteresting thing is historically so i\nthink the problem is that where you are\nyeah many people have been historically\nand this is where my confidence comes\nfrom is because i think that like\nyou know you have a lot of the features\nthat i'm gonna out\noutline in a second that i think are you\nknow\nyou're really falling into a pattern\nhere can i just keep talking\nyes so the first is that a lot of times\nexcitement and motivation come from\ngoals\nespecially for young people right like\nso i i\nlike i i set a goal for myself i want to\nbe something i want to accomplish\nsomething\nand so you climb to the top of the\nmountain and it's it's the\nimage of the view at the top of the\nmountain\nwhich motivates you to climb yeah\nand so this is the most natural form of\nlike motivation and like goal setting\nand excitement like you were building\nsomething you were growing\nyou were playing games you were loving\nit yeah and then you reached to the\nthe top of the mountain and even then\nthe view at the top of the mountain is\nglorious\nbut now what right\nand so this is where yeah it's like\nyou're slowly sliding down the side of\nthe mountain\nand every once in a while you stop\nsliding\nand you sh you you trick yourself and\ntell yourself that it's a win\nbut the fact is is that you're just\nlosing slower\nyeah man so like i don't know how to say\nthis to you but as long as\nthat image and that experience is there\ni think it's going to be very hard to\nfind excitement\nyeah i i would say so right so here's\nwhat i'm hearing\ni think sliding down the mountain is a\ngood you seem like you wanted to say\nsomething go for it\nwell i i think that it's more that it's\nnot just a metaphor for gaming it's like\ni think whenever you're younger right\nyou look forward to\num you look forward to maybe getting\nyour first girlfriend\nuh you know getting a car learning how\nto drive\ngoing to college you know like moving\nout or\nyou know a bunch of these different\nfirsts and i feel like all the fun\nfirsts that i've\nthat i have are pretty much over with\nand\ni'm just kind of uh i i'm i'm waiting\nfor the bad first to happen\nand it's like i really only have bad\nthings to look forward to for the rest\nof my life in a way\ni it sounds really bleak but that's\nreally how i feel yeah\ni'm glad you're sharing that because i\nthink it's bleak and also it's\nreasonable\nand here's the reason it's reasonable\nbecause\nso far fulfillment from you has come\nfrom cresting the mountain\nright and so like here's what i'm\nhearing is like there's an\nuphill part and once we get to the top\nit doesn't matter whether you're facing\nnorth south east or west\nthere's only one way to go it sure is\nyeah right and and so what i'm hearing\nfrom you is this sort of like the fire\nis going out\na fear of of mortality if you actually\nstudy like psychoanalysis what you'll\nfind is that\ndreams around dental problems are\nassociated with the fear of death\ni don't blame them i don't blame them at\nall\ni think it's more about like it's not\nabout it's how to transcend the mountain\nentirely\nbecause like i don't yeah you can't the\nthing is i know that you can't live your\nlife\nit's like you have to you can't be uh i\nguess like goal\nlike outcome uh driven right you have to\njust be able to do something because you\nenjoy doing it\nyeah that's all yeah so so that's where\nwhen you say transcend them out the\nreason that i'm actually optimistic is i\nthink there are a couple of different\nthings going on one is that\ni see this a lot because i work with\nsome very successful people\nand success drives them to the top but\nthen they shrug their\nthey're like now what right and what\nthey usually end up doing is much like\nyourself\nthey're like oh it's climbing to the top\nof a mountain which\ngives me a sense of fulfillment so let\nme go find another mountain and then\nthey climb that one and they get like a\ndiminishing return from it\nit checks some of the boxes and they're\nlike oh i've accomplished stuff\ni can i feel pride but i still feel\nunfulfilled\nit's not the same and so they'll find\nmountain after mountain after mountain\nand they'll feel\nunfulfilled despite being successful\nsuccessful successful\nyep and so the reason that i'm\noptimistic though is because like the\nbest known case\nof someone solving this problem is\nbuddha\nso okay yeah\nlike if you and i talked about them no\nno i i know\na bit but not can you share with us what\nyou know about buddha\nuh basically i think that he was some\nsort\nof a like some sort of workman and then\nhe kind of just sat\nunder a tree and pretty much all of the\na lot of the revelation that he had i\ni believe was just kind of internal\nand i think that the i remember there\nwas i think some sort of a\na phrase where the true enlightenment\nis not you know understanding the\ncomplexities of the universe it's\nunderstanding the nothingness of the\nuniverse or something like that i think\nit's like a one of the\nthings about that now i could be getting\nthis completely wrong and this is like\n10 years ago or 15 years ago but it's\nthat's what i remember\nyeah that's actually it you hit all the\nimportant parts but a couple of details\ni think we're gonna have to reshift\nso like i think uh the key thing is that\nwhat buddha did was\nas you put it pierce the veil yeah okay\nso\nright so like i think that's what his\ndiscovery was is that like you can climb\nmountains\nuntil the end of time but that external\nfulfillment\nis gonna come with diminishing returns\nand you can keep on chasing new things\nyou can like okay i'm gonna start a\ncompany\ni'm gonna become a streamer i'm gonna\nhave kids you can you can find\nall these mountains to climb but that if\nwe kind of think about it fundamentally\nlike\nif you're unsatisfied at the top of a\nmountain like\nthat's a temporary satisfaction and\nclimbing mountains\nis will always lead to temporary\nsatisfactions and so what would the\ndiscovered\nis like through a lot of internal work\nwhich is exactly correct i mean i think\nyou hit a lot of the key points\nwhich is that you can climb mountains\nuntil you're out of breath but never\nwill that bring you peace\nthat peace is piercing the veil is not\nabout looking at a telescope\nit's about looking at a mirror yeah\nand so i think the journey that you have\nto walk is is\nthis one and we can kind of talk so i\nthink that's like the fundamental of\nwhere you are and then i think there's\nalso kind of a psychological component\nfear of death thing like that that needs\nto be processed\nbut there are a couple of um different\nuh\nkey points that i want to share the\nfirst is that buddha wasn't a workman\nhe was focused and so what happened is\nmaterialistically he climbed to the top\nof the highest mountain\nso people told him like hey like as a\nyou know as a prince like\nthese are the things that you should\naccomplish and he went and he did those\nand then like you know he got married he\nhad a healthy son he was revered\nhe was wealthy he was powerful he was\nrespected\nhe was loved he had a bright future and\none day he woke up\nand even though he was the envy of the\nworld he was unhappy\nand so then he was like actually screwed\nbecause there's a there's a subtle thing\nuh zach which makes things both\nbeautiful\nyou're you're blessed and cursed because\nwhen someone who is not\nsuccessful wakes up and feels unhappy\nwhat do they think will lead them to\nhappiness well they think the success\nwill\nuh yeah absolutely yeah they know what\nthe problem is and\nthey have a thing that they can displace\ntheir\nuh unhappiness onto but whenever you\nhave what you want\nand then you still don't feel the way\nyou want it's harder to\ndeal with that absolutely so at some\npoint\nyou reach the end of the road right the\nworse my life\nis the further i can go like repairing\nthings repairing things repairing things\nyou know like playing games fixing your\nteeth launching an\norganization you kind of tried your hand\nat a couple things you're taking care of\nbusiness\nyou're continuing to be successful and\nyet\nonce we get to kind of the top then we\nbegin to realize we're like faced with\nthis\nproblem which is like where does\nhappiness come from\nand this is the really really crazy\nthing if you look at the the hindu and\nbuddhist traditions\ni don't know if you're familiar with\nthis i'm going to go into a little bit\nof history lesson is that okay\noh yeah i mean actually there's a story\nthat i\ni remember i i heard and it was a a guy\nthat kind of ascended\nto some degree of uh you know pseudo\nheaven\nand he was assigned an architect and\nthis is i think part of hindu mythology\nand the architect uh you know he kept\nwanting to bake bigger and builder\nlike bigger and bigger castles and\nfinally like the architect was so tired\nof it\nthat he went and he asked i think it was\nbrahma or vishnu i forgot which one\nand he's like how can i get this guy to\nstop\nwanting bigger and bigger castles and\nthen the the god told him\nhe's like i'll this is no problem i'll\nsolve it\nand then the guy had the castle built\nand then\na bunch of ants marched in to the castle\nand each one of the different ants was\na former version of himself and it put\nin perspective\nhow actually meaningless and and how how\nlittle\nit really mattered and i forgot i forgot\nwhat his name was\nyeah yeah that's not a particular story\ni'm i'm\nthat familiar with so i i don't remember\nhis name but\num i think there's kind of an\ninteresting principle which is like if\nyou look at all the people\nso you're i don't know if you're\nfamiliar with this because it sounds\nlike you've studied\nyou know hindu mythology or something or\nyou're just well read maybe\nor a bit i it's just well it's a story\nthat i think it\nit made an impact on me and because it\njust\nit kind of puts into perspective that\nlike it's the whole idea of you know\nozymandias or anything like that where\nany accomplishment that you have is\nalways fleeting absolutely\nso so here's an interesting um\nthing so you know like in india there\nwere four\ncastes there was a caste system yes and\nthe highest caste were the brahmins the\npriests\nthese were the teachers of meditation\nthe closest to god et cetera et cetera\nyou know they were like they were like\nthey were the you know they taught\nmeditation\nbelow them were the chatrias or the\nnobility\nthese were kings lords etc below them\nwere the vaisnavas\nuh who were avaishas sorry who were\nthe merchant class and below them were\nthe shudras or the laborer cast\nand so let me ask you a question which\ncast\ndo you think produces the most\nenlightened people\num\n[Music]\nprobably it's kind of hard to say i mean\nit depends on like what you mean by\nenlightenment i mean\nobviously you would have the brahmins\nand they're the ones that spend all of\ntheir time\nuh working towards enlightenment so\nthat's what would would make\na lot of sense but is that really what's\nwhat's true\nbecause usually i mean isn't that just\nkind of hereditary what cast you end up\nin sure\nbut they're also trained formally in the\nin the skills of meditation right\nthey're the ones that are the teachers\nand the experts\ni don't know so it turns out that it's\nthe chatrias\nokay so consistently like if you think\nabout the incarnations of vishnu which\nif you want to think about it like not\nfrom a religious standpoint\nbut a historical or anthropological\nstandpoint\nyeah i think what you can safely assume\nis that sometimes there have been\nhistorical human beings\nthat have been like different to the\npoint where like they leave a legacy\nthat people assign divinity to\nlike rasputin like i mean that's a\nthat's a borderline one isn't it yeah\nyeah yeah so so i i think it's it's a\ngood it's a funny example but possibly\nyeah so what i'm thinking about is like\nif you look at all the enlightened\nbeings from the indian subcontinent\nthey're all kind\nof yeah things like that and and the\nquestion is like why is that if you have\nthe experts in meditation you have the\nteachers in meditation\nand they what the the brahman does is\ngoes to the king's palace every day\nteaches the king how to meditate and\nthen goes home\nwhy is it that the king gets enlightened\nbefore the brahman does\ninconsistently so and the really\ninteresting answer is because like\nyou know i think it comes back to\nclimbing to the top of the hill\nbecause at the end of the day what the\nbrahmin is taught is that like\ndon't climb to the top of the mountain\nbecause that's not your job\nthe top of the mountain will never give\nyou fulfillment so the brahmin never\nclimbs to the top\nbut at the end of the day they travel to\nthe king's palace every single day\nand they see a bigger house and\nyou know the king has a prettier wife\nand\nyou know like the you know there's all\nthese like like the king eats finer food\nand has finer clothing\nand the king is the one who actually\nwinds up at the top of the mountain the\nking is the one who wakes up one day\nand finds like this desperation of\nunhappiness\nbecause remember like we talked about\nwhen your life is not perfect you chase\nan external goal\nso for the brahmins there's the seed of\ndesire that is never fulfilled\nand as long as that seed of desire is\nnever fulfilled they can never\ntruly seek enlightenment because the\nsearch the road for enlightenment people\npeople make it sound like it's like a\npositive thing\nthat's like if you look at instagram\naccounts about like people who are\ndeeply spiritual it's all like\nyou know like being in touch with the\nuniverse and like oh my god i'm so like\nin love\nlike learn to love man i love myself in\na new way\nthose guys don't get it the road to\nenlightenment starts\nwith what you feel every single day\nis that like a no matter what you do\nlike things are decaying\nand no matter like what you accomplish\nlike it that excitement can never be\nreproduced\nyeah that that's kind of what's so\nit's very bittersweet in a way because\nlike you can appreciate it\nand you can also resent it or dislike it\nor be afraid of it\nand you kind of have the the duality\nthat happens all the time\nyeah so that's actually that\nunderstanding is one of the key things\nto transcend duality\nyou have to sit within duality\nconstantly to ultimately recognize that\nthings are neither bitter nor\nsweet right so when you kind of talked\nabout you said something about like\nnothingness\nwhen you were talking about your\nunderstanding of buddha's\nenlightenment and i think one of the key\ndiscoveries\nis that like there is no such thing as\ngrowth and there is no such thing as\ndecay\nand once you recognize that once you\nrealize that you'll be free from your\nsense of decay\ni feel like uh like yeah it's like the\nmost enlightened version of it is what\nit is\ni i i get it i understand it but i i\nhow is that real if people die like a\ntree a tree dies\nit burns up trees gone how's that not\ndecay\nyeah so so i could give you a logical\nanswer\nthat yeah it isn't decay um i i i i\ncould i could do that\nbut i think that will be a discussion of\nlogic and that's not actually going to\nlike let you transcend the mountain\nso i you know the the answer that i\nwould give you is is all kinds of things\none is like you know that matter energy\nand consciousness they're just\ntransformed right so like\nlike it is is a st is a chunk of\nlimestone\nbetter or worse than like a brick in a\nhouse\ni think it's like the uh the impact that\nit has on you right so like\nof course obviously it's all the same in\nthe grand scheme of things right in the\ngrand order of the\nof the universe but you know to a person\nand to like what your experiences are\nthere are of course things that\nhave more importance to you than other\nthings it's like a\nyou know family member is more important\nthan a rock even\nnow we get to the crux of it right so\nwell said\nthe impact on you\nso this is what the yogis discovered is\nthat like you said it's\ninternal so like the battle that you\nneed to fight has\nnothing to do with climbing mountains it\nhas everything to do with\nunderstanding how to essentially\ncontrol or be free of\nthings impacting you to be able to join\na micro transaction cesspit\nthe same amount is your first like\nenjoyment of wow\nto understand that like living in life\nis like it's all about\nimpact in the sunscript word for\nde-impaction essentially training\nyourself to be free from the impact of\nthings\nis vairagya to be free of like\nits detachment is the the best kind of\nuh definition of it um and so like this\nis a process that like you can undergo\nto where you know like you can like\nliterally\nlearn how to transcend the mountain that\nthe\ngoing up the mountain and going down the\nmountain is not actually like any\ndifferent\ni know yeah i don't know it it\nfeels a lot different i'll say that yep\nit feels a whole lot different\nso but but that's the key thing right is\nlike like\nthe difference arises of feeling\nit arises to your attachment or your\nvaluing\nof the climb over the descent\nyeah but how how could you possibly\nequate the two that's what i i don't\nunderstand is like\nit it's like i i try to rationalize it\nin my own mind a lot where it's like you\njust go on it's like first\nlike for streaming for example right you\ngo on you have a great stream\nyou go on you have another stream and\nit's not good\nlike how can you make both of those feel\nas good to you personally and\nlike i think the answer that i always\ntell myself is that well you have to\nenjoy them both and you have to just\nkind of get the same thing out of them\nbut it feels like that doesn't really\nhappen for me okay so i'm gonna give you\none last logical answer and then we're\ngonna get into it\nokay yeah all right so here's the thing\nso so\ni think you learn this in medicine so\nlike sometimes you work with a patient\nand they live and sometimes you work\nwith a patient\nand they die right\nso like clearly one is better than the\nother\nthere's like no objective argument that\ncan be made\nand yet do you imagine that it's\npossible\nfor a doctor to go to work every day and\nactually\nlike be just as\nsatisfied with their life whether the\npatient lives or dies\nuh i don't think so i think that there\nare a lot of doctors that probably if\nthey have a patient die they'll feel\nterrible about it i would expect so yeah\nyeah so so here's where what my\nexperience has been\nis that ultimately i can't control\nwhether a patient lives or dies and it's\nbeen really bizarre i'm thinking of one\nparticular patient in residency that had\nlike\nyounger guy um you know maybe in his\nlike or\nearly to mid 50s um had liver cancer but\nlike one of the\nsort of genetic or other variants like\nit's not like he was drinking alcohol\nand did something\nthat was responsible for the cancer uh\nyou know so so he was a he was a um a\nchinese gentleman and and so i was kind\nof assigned to him because i speak a\nlittle bit of mandarin and like we\ndidn't have mandarin translators\nand so like i was assigned to him\nbecause like i could at least ask him\nlike if he had pain that day\nand so you know working with his family\nwas really interesting he had like a 17\nyear old son\nand um you know it was really like\neye-opening because like it's clear that\nthe dude is gonna die\nand and yet like like it's so hard to\ndescribe i think this is where you have\nto really experience it but\nsort of like coming to terms with the\nfact that as a human being like i can't\ni can't cure him of his cancer like i\ncan't do that as a doctor you can't\nactually save someone's life\nall you can do is like try\nright yeah and there comes a point where\nlike you can\na patient can survive and you can have\ndone a shitty job as a doctor\nand a patient can have died and you\ncould have done an amazing job\nas a doctor and that ultimately like\nwhat where my piece comes from is like\nis devoting myself to like the action\nthat i take\nas opposed to like what happens to the\npatient because there's no question\nthat you know life is better than death\nat least in a medical setting right\nit's just it's sort of like you know\nwhat i where i find my peace and i know\nthis may sound strange to you zach and\nwe'll we'll get you there\nyou know because i think i have the\nbenefit of some of these experiences\nwhere you like grapple with like people\ndying of cancer and you figure out\nhow can i go on how can i you know can i\nbe proud of what i did and there are\ntimes where like when i think about\nthat that patient and my work with that\npatient that is i think like the height\nof what i've been capable of yeah being\nattached to an outcome\nand being detached being detached from\nyeah yeah that that's\nyou know that's yeah being attached is\nthe problem and being detached is the\ngoal\nyeah and and so like like can you see\nhow objectively like there's no question\nthat life is better than death but\neven like to this day the family is\nincredibly grateful\nthat i was this person's doctor i'm\nincredibly grateful for having the\nexperience\neven though the dude died and it was sad\nthat there's an axis of suffering and\ncontentment that is actually\nindependent of happiness and sadness\nokay okay i can see that yeah right\nand i think you may understand that part\npretty well because\ni think that there are a lot of reasons\nthat you there's a lot of\njoy enjoyment and potential happiness in\nyour day to day\nthere's accomplishment there's hopefully\nlaughter\nyou know there's working with your one\ntrue king folks and there's something\nthat's like\nmissing on the inside despite everything\ngoing so well\nyeah exactly so that axis\nis like the path that you have to walk\nthrough spirituality\nbecause you've figured out how to like\nbecome successful\nthat's the first axis and what happens\nthe reason we get stuck is because we\nthink that the axis of success\nand the axis of contentment are linked\nbecause\nearly on in life as we climb that\nmountain we think that these two things\nare linked because they grow together\nand then you you kind of like you're\ngoing up together and then what happens\nyou get to the top of the mountain\nand then some people realize that the\naxes are truly perpendicular\nand when you understand that a hundred\npercent is when you attain enlightenment\nyeah i've tried so hard and like i i've\njust\ni i in a way like it's something that\nyou can clearly know\nbut knowing it isn't the same as living\nit i with you 100\nyeah yeah it's like i you you want to do\nthat and you want to\ntranscend being outcome like like\noutcome driven or outcome determined or\nwhatever right\nbut you just can't get out of it\nlike i it's like i'll play a game and\ni'll be like oh even if i don't beat the\nboss you're gonna don't assume\nit's fine and then i play it and i don't\nbeat the boss i'm i'm maulding\nyep so so now so enough of theory\nyes i think there's something holding\nyou back\nokay yeah and so this is where i think\nthat like there's that general principle\nbut i think there's one big thing\ngetting in the way which is your fear of\ndeath\nso this i think think is actually like\npsychological in nature\nit's of the mind okay and and so as long\nas you\nwe have to get to and probably process\nor dissolve this sense of decay\nthat like plagues you\nright so that like what i'm sort of\ngetting the sense of is like you have\nthis\nshadow that goes like that accompanies\nyou through all of your things\nand the shadow is like this feeling that\nlike we're on the decline that there's a\nsense of decay\nthat joy like the only firsts that i\nhave left\nare bad ones yeah you know exactly\nand and so that comes from somewhere\nthat has nothing to do with the axis of\ncontentment or suffering\nwhat that has to do with is like a\npsychological like because\nand this is where we can lean on\nneuroscience a little bit just think\nabout this for a second zach like you\nliterally have\nneurons that have been wired\nto produce those thoughts\nyeah right so then the question becomes\nhow did those neurons get wired that way\nand how can we change your neuronal\nwiring\nso this is now taking a step we'll leave\nspirituality behind\nforget about spirituality forget about\nenlightenment forget about the top of\nthe mountain\nand what we really have to do for you is\ndo some psychological work and rewire\nsome of your neurons because once that\nhappens\nthen you can walk that other axis of\ncontentment and suffering\nso let me ask you this does that make\nsense\nyeah no it definitely makes sense it's\nbasically it's programmed in the wrong\nway like\nyou're programmed to think one thing and\nand it's a bad thing to think yeah i\ntotally understand\nsort of so the tricky thing is that it's\nprogrammed\nit was programmed in the right way and\nnow\nit's maladaptive yeah so it's not a\nmistake it's actually\nand so let me ask you this how long have\nyou been\nafraid of death since i found out about\nit\ncan you tell me about that how you found\nout about death oh\ni don't really remember honestly uh i\nwas\ni think the earliest memory i have is i\nwas like i'm like four or five or six\nright\ni got uh you know i was raised roman\ncatholic and so\ni had a lot of experience just kind of\ntalking about\nthe whole idea of afterlife and\neverything like that and even whenever i\nwas like five years old\ni i read some of the stories i heard\nsome of the stories in the bible i was\nlike man i never heard of anybody that\nlived in a fish i don't even know if\nthis is true\nand it made me wonder it's like what is\nthe\nuh what's really going on and what's\nreally gonna happen because like yeah i\nunderstand people die\nand i was scared of it i remember uh you\nknow it's like you can run from it hide\nfrom it\nuh destiny comes all the same and um\nit it's scary it is and i remember\nthinking that when i was a little kid\nand there have been times where i've\nbeen able to\nkind of forget about that and i think\nthat's really kind of always been my\ngoal is to just not think about it\nand i think that sometimes whenever i i\ndon't this sounds like really stupid\nbecause\ni i think it in a way i feel stupid for\nthinking\nthis way and um like i will i will do\nbadly in a game sometimes and it will\nremind me that i'm getting older\nand i'm gonna die because i'm not as\ngood as i feel like i used to be\nand it's like this weird like kind of\ndomino effect where like playing a game\nlike that will make him feel this way\nand it's just so like to me\ni i i find it embarrassing it's it's\nweird\nbecause i i think it's a um\nit's like a illogical conclusion in a\nway\nbut in another way it's not yeah\nso well said so so i think when you say\nit's an illogical conclusion here's what\ni'm\ni'm gonna rephrase that a little bit or\ntransform it okay\nwhat i'm what i'm gonna the way i'm\ngonna interpret that is that\nif you look at the variables that lead\nyou to playing a\ncrappy game of whatever there are tons\nof them right\nyeah if you're a moba player the number\none variable is that your team sucks\nabsolutely it's always their fault yep\nand and so\nlike if we think about it there are a\nthousand reasons why you know\nyou're you have poor performance in the\ngame yeah but what your mind\njumps to is ah see this is a sign of\nthe decay we knew it was there\nwe know it's coming as you said you\ncan't escape it it's destiny here it is\nand so this is this is the very nature\nof a cognitive bias is that like it's a\nfilter\nthrough which an independent experience\nbecome like transforms into something\nelse\nyeah it's like uh if the only tool you\nhave is a hammer every problem looks\nlike a nail\nabsolutely you find it yeah i get it so\nso so now we go back to i mean you say\nyou don't have\nmany memories about it but like like i\nthink that we have to figure out how to\ndeconstruct the filter\nand that that starts with like\nunderstanding how the filter was built\nand so when you were four years old and\nyou were like raised roman catholic and\nwhen you say\ncan you tell us more about that well i\nwent to church every sunday got\ncommunion\ni never liked going to church couldn't\nplay game boy in church\nand i didn't really ever believe in a\nlot of this stuff\ni thought it was kind of i i\nin a way there's like the parallel\nrealities of\nis it more like i think i even said this\nlast time i was on here is it more\nterrifying\nto know that you are created just for\nthis endless cycle\nof servitude towards some deity that you\ndon't really fully comprehend\nor is it more terrifying that you're\njust a\nhyper-intelligent ape with no purpose in\nlife who's going to die and\ncease to exist in a period of time\nthat's\nnothing in the grand scheme of things\nit's like which one of these realities\nis more terrifying and\nyou know i think they're both pretty bad\nyeah so that sounds like philosophy to\nme\nyeah yeah i mean a lot of the religion\nin a lot of ways\nis philosophy and so what yep so\ni'm gonna steer away from that go ahead\nso why did you have to go to church well\nmy mom wanted me to it was sunday\nand can you help me understand what\ndid you did you ever try to tell your\nmom that you didn't want to go to church\nyes i i made her aware of the way that i\nfelt about it yes many times\ncan you tell us about that i was like\nmom i don't want to go she's like it's\ntoo bad you're going to go\nand i was like well i don't want to go\nand then finally sometimes i would uh\ntry to make myself feel better and think\nlike maybe she'll take me to burger king\nafter church\nthat was that honestly sometimes that\nhelped but\num overall like yeah like she would\nalways make me want to go or make me go\nand i didn't really like nowadays the\nweird thing about it is nowadays i\ni you know i offer every time that it's\nlike a holiday like right now you know\nkovitz so like i'm not doing it\nbut like any other time besides and i\nalways tell her like listen mom if you\nwant if you want me to take you to\nchurch i will\nnot even stream like i will make sure\nthat you get to go to church right\nbecause\ni knew how much it meant to her back\nthen but whenever i was a kid i didn't\nhave that same\nperspective right and so back then i\njust uh\nyou know i didn't want to go i hated\ngoing and it was just\nit's like i could be at home playing\nwith my friends i could be playing video\ngames i could be doing something i want\nto do\nand instead i'm doing this thing that i\ndon't want to do that i don't even think\nis real\nokay and what would she say when you\ntold her that you didn't want to go\nuh i mean i think there's a lot of\ndifferent things she'd say but um\nlike i i don't the thing is it's it's\nodd because i don't even really remember\nlike the only thing i really remember is\nthat it didn't matter\nyep yeah i could rationalize it all i\nwanted but uh\ni was still still driving to church yep\nso inevitable\nit's inevitable nothing you can do to\nescape it\nwell i could like fake sick sometimes to\nfix it there's a few times i did that\nbut uh other than that yeah it's pretty\nmuch inevitable\nnow we talking about going to church or\ndying definitely church i feel like the\ni i definitely feel like it's two kind\nof different things\nbecause church like i was like i knew\nthat at some point i wouldn't have to\nalways do this\nand like i could get away from it to an\nextent because it's like okay well i'm\nclearly not going to be nine years old\nforever\nso eventually i won't have to deal with\nthis but\num with dying you can't really get away\nfrom it in the same way\nso it's not yet ask you a question okay\nso yeah\ni understand that you don't remember\nexactly what the conversations were\nbut you remember the feeling\nright of being dragged to church\nyeah so like like there's a certain\nsense of like\npowerlessness and inevitability to the\nstory that you're telling\nno i mean i think every kid has like\nmany stories like that where you just\nhave to do something it's like going to\nschool\nit's the center we're not okay if it's\nthe same thing for you but let's not\nworry about what\nwhat many kids have okay so here's my\nquestion i know it's gonna sound kind of\nweird\nyeah when you have those thoughts of\ndecay\nis the quality flavor or color of\nemotion\nthat you experience at all similar to\nhow you felt when you got dragged to\nchurch\nnot really i mean i think the church\nthing was just a more\nor less a you know a one and a half hour\ninconvenience\nwhereas dying is like a very much it's a\nmuch longer inconvenience\nand so can you tell me a little bit\nabout when you started to fear\ndeath yeah like i was a kid i mean as i\nsaid as soon as i figured out\nthat it was going to happen like how did\nyou figure out that it was going to\nhappen\nwell that's the thing is like i must\nhave been like four or five years old so\ni can't really remember\ni it's hard for me to like to really get\nit\nto really remember what it was or how it\nfelt\nbecause it was just so long ago and so\ni'm hearing you've carried this feeling\nwith you for a long time\nyeah can you do you remember like\ntimes that maybe you were a little bit\nolder that you were like\nworried about it like do you have any\nmemories of being slightly older where\nyeah i remember um uh well it's like not\njust for me right i worry obviously\nabout my parents dying that's scary\nand uh there's one time my mom she uh\ni don't know we don't know really what\nit was i took her to the doctor\na while afterwards but she like kind of\nhad some sort of like\na it wasn't really like a heart attack\nbut it was some sort of like a thing it\nwas like a couple of steps below that\nand i remember like i woke up and i\nthought that and i was like oh my god\nthat was a pretty bad point in my life\nbecause she didn't want me to call that\nthe ambulance right because we were\nreally poor we couldn't afford it\nand like having to deal with that and\nlike the helplessness not only\nof you know of the the greater\nexistential situation but also just like\nthe day-to-day\nlike you know we don't have money we\ncan't take care of ourselves\nand that was brutal\nwhat was brutal about it well i mean\nlike having to\nlike feeling like you're gonna lose one\nof your parents and then\nthinking to yourself like this is all\ni've ever known\nand i like to know that it's not gonna\nlast\nand like that that's what was scary and\nto to be helpless even inside of the\ncontext of society\nright because you don't have the money\nto take care of it and\nuh the funny thing about that is that i\nactually\num like yeah i had i remember because i\nwoke up and she was like\nlike it's just like screaming or like\ncrying and so like i had to wake up\nlike i used to have like ptsd and i\nguess it's ptsd i don't know i just kind\nof read about it later on\ni would wake up and i would hear it in\nmy head and i would have to get up and\ncheck on her\nand this would happen like once every\nlike two hours or something like that\nand uh this went on for maybe uh like\nsix months a year something like that\nand and then you know i kind of got i i\nthat stopped happening\ni wouldn't say i got over it but it\nstopped happening and um\nthen a funny thing about that is that's\nactually what\ndrove me to uh to make my youtube\nchannel and to start making videos\nthat's kind of the reason can you help\nme understand that how does that relate\nto a youtube channel\nwell because i didn't have the uh i\ncouldn't really\nhave a job at that point because i felt\nlike i had to be around to take care of\nher\nand i wanted to be able to work from\nhome and do something like that and so i\ndidn't want to spend all day at work in\ncase she had something happen that she\nneeded me there for\nand that's why i started doing youtube\nvideos because i thought that well maybe\ni can do this and\nyou know see where it goes\nthat's interesting yeah\nso are you saying that if your mom had\nnever had something like a heart attack\nyou wouldn't\nyou wouldn't have had a career in\nstreaming\nuh you know i uh i've always felt that\nyeah i mean that's why i say i never\nhave any regrets in my life in a way\nand um it's like uh you know\nuh you need a hot fire to forge a sword\nand\nthat's kind of the way that i i've\nlooked at it yeah it's true\nbut it sucks\nso zach this may sound kind of weird but\nlike\ni'm kind of hearing that you're not\nreally afraid of\ni know it sounds weird yeah yeah go on\nyou're not really afraid of death\ni think what what bothers you it sounds\nto me is actually your\ninability to deal with death\nwell control over it yeah yeah i mean\nit'd be nice if i could control it\nthat'd be great\ni i know it sounds weird and and yeah\nthis may seem like a\na useless distinction but to me it\nactually feels pretty significant\nbecause\nwhat i'm what i'm hearing themes of\nis is not actually death it's like it's\nlike you being\nlike and and i'm i'm stretching here\nokay so i'm trying to draw connections\nbut\num and so you know we feel free to bat\nthem down if they don't\nsit with you it's hypothesis testing\num you know what i'm really hearing is\nthat like\nyou've been on the receiving end of\nbeing powerless before\nand like what i'm hearing is that death\nis like\nthe guaranteed powerlessness it's the\none thing\nthat you know that no matter how hard\nyou try\nyou can fix everything else you can have\nmoney\nyou can have medical care you can have\nfriends you can have\nlove and you can gain power over every\ndimension\nin your life but the one thing that you\ncan never gain power over is death\nyeah the interesting thing though is\nthat\ni'm not because it's it's bizarre\nbecause most people who\nfear death are concerned about regret\nthey're concerned about lost\nopportunities\nthey're concerned about all the things\nthat they didn't get to do\ni'm not hearing really much of that at\nall from you if i could sit in my room\nand play video games eating cheetos and\ndrinking soda for another thousand years\ni would do it\nso so it's interesting because i know it\nsounds weird\nbut for a lot of people the fear of\ndeath is about missed things\ni'm not hearing that from you what i'm\nreally hearing from you is that death is\nabout\nthe inevitability of powerlessness\nyeah like that is like entropy is like a\nforce that no matter\nhow hard you fight against you can never\novercome\nyeah you can't do anything about it yeah\nit's it's the ozymandias analogy again\nyeah\nexactly and so this is where like i\nthink if you want to be free of that\nthe work that we need to do is about\nexperiences of powerlessness in your\nlife\nright because that's yeah i've thought\nabout doing that for myself\ntoo it's like i remember um\nuh there's like sometimes whenever i\nwill take\nrisks in a way and this sounds really\nbad\ni'll take risks in a way that could\nreally hurt me and i don't care about\nthem because it's like kind of an\nexercise in letting go of\nworrying about your your well-being no\nit's not\nit's an exercise in exerting power\nhow do you feel how do you feel like\nthat because like\nlike you're taking the risk right so\nlike you're you're manning up against it\nlike like what so this is exactly what\ni'm saying\nfor most people risk to their well-being\nis is enough of a deterrent\nbut for you you have like a you have a\nfar\nmore important flame within you\nwhich is like irrespective of the the\nlike\nthe impact to my well-being like i'm\ngoing to choose i'm going to be in\ncontrol\ni'm going to jump into the lake of fire\nbecause i'm the one that's doing it\nand while a thousand people will say to\nyou you're a dumb ass for jumping into a\nlake of fire\nthey don't understand that like what you\nneed from that what you're getting out\nof that is that you're the one who's\ndoing the jumping\nfor me like what i try to get out of it\nis that\ni can let go and just let it happen\nif it is wrong we're saying the same\nthing\nyeah right because what you're trying to\ndo is train yourself to be powerless\npowerless exactly yeah which in a weird\nway\nis actually taking control\nuh i i i guess yeah i mean if you well\nhow could\nwell yeah but it's like it's how do you\nhow can you it's like a paradox right\nbecause how do you take control of not\nhaving control\nhow do you not take control that's why\nit doesn't work\nokay because you've tried it right yeah\nand you still fear death and you still\nfear powerlessness\nand you've like like do you see like i\nthink we're saying the same thing like i\nthink\nnow i feel like we're on to something\nbecause it's like\nyou do this thing to train yourself\nto endure yourself to build build some\ndamage like you want some\nfear of death resistance so what you're\ngonna do is jump into a lake of fire and\na thousand other people are gonna say\nlike don't do that that's dumb\nand you're like you guys don't\nunderstand for me it's like\ni have to learn how to like\nlet go or whatever like i have to learn\nhow to face these things and like\ndo something that's high risk because\nit's like you trying to grapple with\nthis thing\nyeah well it's also just like small\nthings i remember i uh\ni i was walking up the street this was\nlike a years ago\nright or quite a while and a few years\nago it was quite a while ago\nand um i had like a weird i don't know\nif this was like a panic attack or\nsomething like that where\ni was walking down to the street and i\nor to the store i was walking down the\nstreet to the store\nand i had like a weird thing happen with\nlike my chest\nand i don't know if it was a panic\nattack if it was some sort of like\nyou know weird thing with my heart i\ndon't know what it was this happened\na few years ago and i it was the first\ntime that i ever really\nfelt i think that almost many people\nhave this experience right where they\nthey have the the first feeling of\nmortality and that was that for me\nright and i remember a year or so later\ni had\nnot that same feeling but something that\nreminded me of it like walking up the\nstreet and i thought to myself\nif that's the case and if i die right\nnow\nthere couldn't be a better time for it\nto go i'm walking down the street\ni'm happy i'm with my friends i'm in my\nneighborhood\nand everything is as good as it's ever\ngoing to be\nand that's been the closest that i've\nbeen\nto\ni don't know like like think about that\nfor a second like\nso so you're afraid of death right\nyeah in that second time when you were\nwalking don't read twitch at\nokay all right so when you're when\nyou're\nwalking up the street and you start to\nfeel that sensation\ndid you think you were dying uh\nthere's a two percent chance one percent\nchance yeah\nit made me aware it made me aware sure\nand so as like so can we just sort of\ni'm gonna put\nsome i'm gonna interpret okay so you're\nwelcome to push back against\ninterpretation\nso in that moment you were actually like\nsome of the\nthat's the closest to death that you've\nactually ever been\nclosest to death that i've been without\ni mean like there have been some other\ntimes where i've been pretty close to it\naware aware of your proximity to death\nlet's put it that way uh\ni remember there was one time\ni was driving that my friend was driving\ndown the street he was drunk and high\nand i was in the passenger seat and the\nseat belt didn't work\nand i thought to myself man i'm never\ngoing to have to worry about that test\nthat i have to do next week\nhow did you feel when you were close to\ndeath\nuh in the first case uh the the one in\nthe car\ni felt uh it's like it there's like the\nit's it's it's terrifying but at the\nsame time it's also grounding\nand when you're walking up the street\nand you think to yourself maybe there's\na two percent chance this is a heart\nattack how do you feel\noh that died just i felt good feel fine\nso\nlike this makes no sense\nbecause here you are afraid of death on\na daily basis\nand when it comes knocking on your door\nthe words that you describe\nare not abject terror sure there's\nterror but there's also grounding\nand there's also a sense of like peace\nand acceptance\nyeah yeah uh it's it's a weird\nit's like kind of you have moments of uh\nmoments of peace and moments of being\nable to deal with things\nand then also moments where you can't\nno it's like it's not an even i'm gonna\ndisagree\nokay because i think actually i know it\nsounds weird\nwhat you say is logically makes a ton of\nsense but here's\nhere's what i'd like to put out to you\nis that when\nactually faced with death you're okay\nwith it\nit's the feeling of decay the feeling of\ninevitability the feeling of\npowerlessness\nabout that future thing that you can\nnever prevent\nthat's where you're terrified\nyeah do you see the difference like\nbecause when you actually face death\nyou're like so be it and anticipation\nis the uh is the stressful thing and you\nknow going back to the the thing with\nthe dentist right i mean\nsitting in the waiting room is way more\nstressful than actually having the teeth\nuh\nyou know fixed or whatever so now we get\nto like i think the problem is that\nyou've misdiagnosed yourself and not\nthat we diagnose you here on stream i'm\nnot gonna diagnose\njust use that term loosely okay because\nyou you call it the fear of\ndeath but i don't think it's the fear of\ndeath i think it's the fear of\npowerlessness\nbecause when you actually face death\nyou're kind of like if i go\nso be it that's vairagya\nyeah i mean it's it's scary in a way\nyeah i think the the the more i have to\nthink about it\nit's like kind of it it's like i try not\nto think about it\nlet me just say that yeah so we'll get\nto your whole coping\nstructure in a second but like and i\nthink this is where\nyou know i i sort of barked up the tree\nof like roman catholicism fear of death\nand things like that\nand that tree didn't there's nothing in\nthe tree right\ni asked you that stuff and it kind of\nfelt like it wasn't\nyou're kind of like yeah that's not the\nsame feeling you basically told me\nso and i think that makes sense because\ni think what the feeling really is it\nreally has to do with like we've got to\ntalk about times in your life where you\nfelt powerless\nlike this whole thing with your mom i\nthink is like a far better\nlike i know it sounds kind of weird but\nlike you know when you think about your\ndecay when you do poorly in a video game\nokay yeah this is gonna sound like a\nbizarre question feel free to swat this\ndown too if it doesn't\nfeel right okay when you do poorly in a\nvideo game\nis the color flavor and texture of how\nyou feel in that moment forget about\nyour thoughts forget about your\nrationalizations\nsimilar to how you felt when your mom\ntold you\ndon't call the ambulance uh yeah i mean\nto an extent yeah\nuh sure and i i think that's basically\nit it's like feeling\nyeah feeling like you don't have the\ncontrol over it and\nlike you just can't you know what you\nknow what needs to happen and you can't\ndo it\nyeah so that's so the the interesting\nthing as\nzach is that i think if you want to be\nhappy okay yeah there's a two-step\nprocess and and we can dig into this a\nlittle bit more if you want to today but\nlike here's what i'm seeing\nthe first thing that you've got to do\nbecause you said this beautifully you\nsaid\ni didn't get over it but it stopped\nhappening\nwith your with your i think that's a lot\nof ptsd and things like that\nright i mean you have like the initial\nshock it's the same as like a wound\nright i mean you the wound eventually\nheals\nbut you still remember it being there in\na way yeah so here's what i'm gonna say\nis that it just changed the shape\nin which it manifests and that it's the\nsame thing this is the hypothesis\nthe the fear of decay that you have is\nwhat it turned into\nwhen did your mom have this event 2012.\nokay i think it's just somewhere around\nthem i'm meant 2013 i think it was\nnovember 2012 if i remember right and\nhow long\ndid it did you have the the ptsd waking\nup things like that\nuntil about uh i don't know like 2014\n2000 middle of 2014 somewhere around\nthere\nokay i mean like obviously these are\nvery rough like\nguesses but yeah and and how long have\nyou felt\nnot excited how long have you been\nworried about the decay of your career\nand that you're getting older\nuh probably last two years uh two or\nthree years\nthat probably saved you three three\nissues so it looks like there's like so\nlet's say like\nthere's a pretty significant gap between\n2014 and 2018\nand and i think that there's like to to\nme though i feel like i've got a pretty\ngood\nsense that if you want to be free of\nthis thing\nyou've actually go to gotta go back and\nexplore like times in your life where\nyou felt powerless\nlike the sense of inevitability and like\npowerlessness\nand we can kind of talk about that more\ni mean i know we've been at it for\nyou know a while now um\nand so i'll kind of leave it up to you\nwhether you want to talk a little bit\nabout like coping\nlike your your uh you know your tendency\nto like cope and\nwell what do you mean by exploring it\nlike that's i'm curious\nlike how do you explore a moment of\npowerlessness\nwhen it yeah great question so like i i\nthink i know it sounds weird but\nwhen when i asked you about your mom\nwhat did you feel in that moment as you\nwere\nretelling the story what sucked\ni mean like the thing is if i i've told\nthe story before on my stream\nso like kind of the visceral like\nemotional feeling is not really there as\nmuch because i'm used to telling it\nbut um it's it it sucks i mean i think\nyeah\nit just it feels bad i think that's what\ni what in\nwhat way does it feel bad\ni don't know i mean like it it feels bad\nthat it happened it feels bad that\ni i i guess yeah it just feels bad that\nit happened i i'm not really sure\nexactly how to describe it\nso let me ask you this do you experience\nan echo\nof what you experienced back then when\nyou tell the story\nno that's why i can tell it okay\nso that's what we have to change so\nhere's how it works\nokay so from like and this is a slightly\nmore yogic perspective but if we look at\nprinciples of psychotherapy i think\nwe're kind of let's all\nso i'll kind of explain to you what\nhappens so when we have negative\nexperiences\nthere's a certain emotional energy that\nwe experience in that moment\nand yeah that that energy can do one of\ntwo things it can either be digested\nor buried generally speaking as we get\nolder we get\nbetter at digesting negative experiences\nso if we think about like you know um\nso for example you know being\nemotionally abused by your boss at the\nage of 27\nfor six months is far less\ndamaging than being emotionally abused\nby a teacher for six months at the age\nof five\nyes right so like if we think about why\nis that it's because our pr\nour our brain's capacity to process and\ndigest at\nolder ages is improved\nyeah you have more context around it\nabsolutely more con\nyeah so it what you say is context is\nyour brain's ability to attach context\naround it\nyeah right so the five-year-old doesn't\nunderstand how to do that\nyou're precisely right but i'm just sort\nof reshaping it as like a faculty\nof the mind so if we look at like\npsychotherapy and like psychiatry like\nwhy do we dig into the past it's because\nlike most of the dormant emotional\nenergy\nforms in the past because we tend to do\npretty good like you can have a\ntraumatic breakup you can lose a parent\nthings like that\nbut like losing a parent at the age of\nseven has\nand i've seen this lifelong impacts\nlosing a parent at the age of 42 has\nalso affects you for the rest of your\nlife but it doesn't like\ndamage you for the rest of your life\nyeah it doesn't change the course yeah i\nsee\nso here's what happens i know it sounds\nkind of weird but that energy lies\ndormant and then resurfaces so the\nexample that i'm going to use is like\nthe the standard one i use on stream is\nlet's say i'm walking down the street\nwith my kid\nand my kid sees a dog kid goes to pet\nthe dog\nkid dog kind of nips at my kid the kid\ngets terrified\nstarts crying yells terrified pick me up\ndaddy feels a ton of fear and emotion\nten minutes later i get her an ice cream\nshe's licking the ice cream we don't\nhave to go to the emergency room or\nanything the\ndog was actually just sniffing her\ndidn't even bite her but for her it was\ntraumatic\nand ten minutes later she's like a kid\nshe's resilient so she's like licking\nher ice cream telling me about\nyou know what she's what she's doing in\nschool everything's fine\nuntil the next day when she sees another\ndog\nand she freaks out daddy picked me up oh\nmy god so like where did that\nyou know she's like across the street\nit's like what's happening\nso what's happened is her neurons have\nwired\nto recognize this dog as a dangerous\nstimulus\nyeah people like the human brain is good\nat uh\nrecognizing patterns and making patterns\nabsolutely right so that\ndormant emotional energy so that's the\nneuroscientific perspective\nlet's think about it from like an\nemotional energy perspective a ton of\nemotion\ndisappears in 10 minutes it doesn't\nactually disappear\nright it goes dormant yeah yeah and then\nreactivates\nso what i'm hearing from you is that\nlike\nthis emotional energy reactivates\nas signs of decay oh you see the decay\nthere you see the decay there\nit's inevitable i'm powerless there's\nnothing i can do\nand so then the question becomes like\nokay if that emotional energy is like\nmanifesting because this is where we\nkind of get to coping you i mean you say\nit beautifully\nzack you're kind of like i didn't really\nget over it but it sort of went away and\nwhat it's doing is it's like seeping in\nthrough the cracks now\nit shapes the way that your mind looks\nat things it shapes the way that you\nlook at life because\nthere's this like part of your brain\nthat is telling you zach that no matter\nwhat you do\nyou are powerless and so what is your\nbrain then what happens is your brain\ntakes that feeling\nand it actually tries to construct a\nlogic around it\nso this sounds kind of weird but this is\nhow like kind of psychosis works we're\nlike paranoia\nwhere the person has the paranoia it's\nactually an\nemotion that's at the root of it and\nthen their their\nmind constructs an explanation\nto corroborate the emotion why do people\nfeel like they're being followed by the\nfbi\nas opposed to someone else it's because\nthey have a\nfeeling of being followed feeling\nfeeling observed\nand then the mind constructs and asks\nitself in a logical way\nwhat organizations have the resources to\nconstantly follow me which is why you\nsee these recurrent themes of like fbi\nmob whatever\nyeah i can see that so they're just\nlooking for a outlet\nto rationalize their feelings absolutely\nbut at the root of it\nis a feeling and in your case i think\nwhat your mind has done is like\nlatched on to this fear of death because\ni don't think it's actually a fear of\ndeath i know it sounds weird\ni know you're afraid of death but i\nthink what you're really afraid of is\npowerlessness at the time of death\nbecause if we really look at it\nscientifically when you face death\nyou're not like freaking the [ __ ] out\nyou're actually like\nif i have to go now so be it which is\nnot what you would expect\nfrom someone who's facing death no it's\nnot\nand so i know it sounds kind of weird\nbut so now when we get to when you say\nlike\nexploring it what does that mean what\nthis means is that actually all of that\ndormant emotion\nas we talk about it and as we bring the\nemotion up\nyou will feel it in the moment\nand you will feel powerless in the\nmoment but the cool thing is that each\ntime you\nfeel powerless let's say like in a\ntherapy session\nit actually reduces the dormant\nemotional energy\nand as the dormant emotional energy\nstarts to wane\nyour fear of decay will go with it\nso i actually have an interesting way\nthat i actually i\ni agree with you and i think that's kind\nof one of the reasons why i talked about\nit on my stream too\nis because the exact same thing happened\nwith a lot of other problems that i had\nwhenever i was younger so\nif you ever go back and watch one of my\nhighlight videos of 2016 or something\nlike that\ni was very afraid to even show my arms\nbecause i'm i'm extremely skinny\ni'm very very very skinny and\ni was even more so then and on top of\nthat i\ni would always cover my mouth whenever i\nwould smile because i didn't want people\nto see that i had\nthings wrong with my teeth i would\nwear a beanie sometimes if i felt a\nlittle bit more bald than usual that day\nand uh i had a lot of insecurities and\num\nhaving to eventually deal with those\ninsecurities on camera\nand i remember recently i took a shower\non stream where i took my shirt off on\nstream\nand imagine doing that uh four years ago\nfor me is just completely\nlike i just could never imagine doing\nthat at all\nand i think that the reason that i was\nable to do that is kind of just\nconsistently dealing with those problems\nand being faced with that\nconstantly and then slowly just kind of\nlearning to accept that this is who i am\nrather than this is uh you know\nsomething i have to be\nafraid of or ashamed of that i i can't\nlet anybody know about me\nand i think that was that was helpful\nfor me because it helped me\nbecome more of more accepting of myself\nyeah so so perfect example\ni'm going to reinterpret it using a\ndifferent kind of language\nso i think the problem when we hear your\nstory is people\nif people are struggling with the same\nthing they're like i'm insecure about my\nappearance\nthere and you say i learned to accept it\neveryone listening at home is like\nhow do i learn to accept it right\nbecause acceptance comes\nat the end whereas like i'm gonna try to\nreinterpret this using\nthe model that i shared with you is i\ndon't think i think the learning to\naccept it\nis sort of like happens towards the end\nthe interesting thing is that if you\nthink about\neach of those moments okay so you have\nthe the dormant energy of insecurity\nand every time you put on the beanie\nthat energy is not being digested\nbut every time you take off the beanie i\nknow this sounds kind of weird but\nthat insecure emotion comes up and is\npresent\nalive and on in your mind yeah and if\nit's not i'll read read it and somebody\nwill make a comment about it again\nand so then it brings it up and it\nbrings it up\nand it brings it up so all of the\ndormant energy of the insecurity\nactivates in the present and if we think\nabout even something like exposure\ntherapy from a phobia or we think about\nmy kid\nhow do i get her to trust dogs again how\ndo i get her to like dogs\ni have to bring up that emotion right\nit's like oh we're gonna see oh that\ndog's across the street\nwe're not gonna touch it okay daddy's\ngonna go over and touch it\nand that raises her anxiety a little bit\nyeah and it's like\nyou know do you want to touch it now and\nshe's like no and then it's like okay\nand then we're gonna try again tomorrow\nwe're gonna try again tomorrow\nso it's the activation of that dormant\nenergy in the present\nthat when done with awareness and this\nis a key part\nwhich i think you are like grappling\nwith yourself in those moments right\nand so that's like the awareness\ncomponent\ni'm sure i mean in a way at the\nbeginning and i think also like to a\ncertain extent it's like i tried to\nbe somebody that i wasn't i tried to\npretend\nlike i was this different person and i\nthink that\nin a way it's kind of like a negative\nemotion\ntelling people that you're actually a\ndegenerate with their teeth falling out\nlike that's that's a negative emotion\nbut\nit's still you it's still better to be\nyou\nthan pretend to be somebody else but it\nis it's definitely not like i i don't\nhave like a better self-image\nbecause of it i if anything i have a\nworse self-image\nbut it it is what it is\nit's not a it's a facade that is\nprecisely so now now we're going to kind\nof things full circle\nbecause that statement that you just\nmade is moving\nin on that other axis that i'm talking\nabout\nbecause oddly enough like if we think\nabout okay my self-image is poor\nlet me fix my teeth that's the axis of\nlike\nclimbing mountains doing something\nexternal becoming something that you're\nnot\nand what you're what i'm hearing you say\nis that like i actually\naccept that i kind of look like a\ndegenerate\nand that actually brings me peace\nwell that's what's bad about it though\nis because i'm\nokay with with just living like an\nanimal\nlike i'm i've said before no mere mortal\ncan live with asthma gold\nlike i i live like an absolute animal\nand i don't care yeah so\nnow we get to subtle things yeah there's\nanother one\nso this idea that you were an animal\nthat's a whole other complex\nthat also has its origins which like\nwhen you were growing up poor\njust hypothesizing for a second right we\ncould do this all day\nbut when you were growing up poor like\ntell me about what it was like to\ngo to school oh it would suck right i\nmean like uh sometimes it would\nespecially if everybody else had x or y\nthing and i didn't have it\nuh luckily and you know my mom did you\nknow it's not like we were\nwe weren't like the we we didn't live in\nthe projects right but we were one of\nthe poorer families\nin a working-class neighborhood i would\nsay somewhere around there like lower\nworking class neighborhood\nand so um you know there would be many\ntimes whenever i wouldn't have something\nthat it felt like everybody else would\nhave or\ni wouldn't be able to do something that\neverybody else could do or i couldn't\nlook forward to something that everybody\nelse could look forward to\nand it did feel bad to be like that one\nperson that didn't have it\nor that one person that couldn't do it\nor whatever and\ni still think about that sometimes it\ndoes it's disappointing but\ni guess like to me now i just i always\nhave like the uh\nthe perspective that as i said i don't\nreally have any regrets\nand i like in a way i would there be\nlike small things i would go back and i\nwould want to change in my life\nbut i wouldn't really want to do a whole\nlot of that because every\nmoment in my life has brought me to the\npoint to where i'm at now and i think\nthat i'm at a\nrelatively good spot now it's just that\ninternally i'm not\ndoes that make sense yeah it makes a lot\nof sense yeah so this is where you know\ni could hypothesize further\ni'm getting what you're saying but but i\ni think this sentiment\nof no mere mortal can live with asthma\nand gold is i think a sentiment\nthat was born but i'm just taught you\nknow just in the interest of time i'm\ngoing to just toss stuff out\nit's like that sentiment was born when\nyou thought about inviting kids over to\nyour house after you went with their\nhouse\nactually was born after i had a\ngirlfriend live with me\nokay but uh yeah\num well the thing is like a lot of my\nfriends like and the thing\nis that back then uh we were\ncomplete animals like we all were but\nthe the thing is that they got older and\nthey stopped being animals\nbut i'm just the [ __ ] same\nand like i still feel like i'm 16. the\nonly time i don't feel like i'm 16 or 13\nanymore is if i talk to a 16 year old\nthen i realize oh [ __ ] okay\nactually never mind i'm 30. but outside\nof that i feel the same pretty much\nand i feel good it's just that every\nthe whole world around me changed i\ndidn't\ni think there's a lot there yeah like\nit's a really interesting combination of\nacceptance and coping\nyeah it's weird isn't it yeah i think\nit's tough because i think what you've\nmanaged to do\nis like survive and so a lot of what i'm\nhearing is like\nyou've accepted yourself for who you are\nbecause\nrejecting yourself is too painful but in\nin accepting yourself for who you are\nyou're also propagating things that i\nthink you\nknow aren't good for you which you're\nalso working on\nno yeah that that's what the problem is\nright is like i should not be okay\nwith a number of things like i know that\nlike\ninternally you know my my head's [ __ ]\nup in that way\nyeah so to explain how you overcome that\nyou actually it's kind of weird you have\nto go back to bringing up that negative\nemotion\nbecause as long as you say to yourself\nno mere mortal can live with asthma and\ngold\nyou're kind of laughing off the\nshamefulness of your situation\nbut i don't feel any shame exactly\nthat's the problem\nand until you feel that shame\nright so so so like since you don't feel\nthat shame\nyou're propagating the life because this\nis the way that you ignore the shame\nyeah but it's like i just never had it\nit never bothered me at all\nand yeah i i it's just it's so weird to\nme because like other people they will\nlatch on and care so much about having\nthis thing or having\nuh you know x or y uh like object or\nsomething like that\nand for me i just don't care about any\nof it it doesn't matter to me like it\ndoesn't matter if i have a nice car it\ndoesn't matter to me if i have a nice\nhouse\ni don't need nice clothes i wear the\nsame clothes i wore in high school\num and that none of these things matter\nto me at all\nyeah i just i don't care about the same\nthings other people care about i'm not\nsure\nhow much of this is it acceptance and\nattachment and how much of it is a\ncoping mechanism\nblown out of proportion\nif i want it i just don't care i i\nunderstand that\nso so so you know there are many reasons\nthat people cannot care about something\nyeah right they can learn to not care\nabout it\nor they can be detached from it\nwell so here it's kind of well i think\nthat there's a there's another\nexperience that kind of might shed some\ninsight onto this\nuh whenever i was young i uh i did care\nabout these things a lot\nthese they were very very meaningful to\nme like what i was saying before about\nhaving everything like\nyou know i wanted to have like nice\nclothes and they ran clothes things like\nthat\nand you know many times my mom and i\nwould go to a thrift store and you know\ni wouldn't be able to have like those\nsame kinds of brand new clothes that\nuh my other my other friends would have\nnow many times i did also have\nnice clothes as well but it just wasn't\nreally to the same degree especially\nwith other things that cost more money\nand i went to a school in high school\ninitially where\nit was much more of like an upscale\nschool many more people had you know\nthat kind of stuff and\ni i kind of i didn't really fit in there\nand i realized that the people that were\nin that\nin that society that cared about those\nthings were not like me\nand uh that kind of got me to\nnot care about those things as much as i\ndid then\nbecause i saw people that you know kind\nof attached themselves to those things\nand cared about those things a lot\nand i looked at myself and i'm like this\nis not who i am\nthat sounds to me like acceptance and\ngrowth\nuh i would say so i mean i would hope so\nat least yeah\nso so i'm not i'm not detecting that\nthis is some weird coping mechanism in\nterms of like being not materialistic\nironically if we look at your karmic\ntemperament\nit's interesting because i think being\nborn so so what you just described\nasthma gold so\nis actually would be interpreted by some\nof my teachers as a sign of\npast spiritual work so that there's a\ncertain so it's interesting because like\nin\nin the hindu gaming system or buddhist\nuh the lesser of the buddhists but more\nmore in the hindu um\nthat essentially like you don't carry\nover your gear\nyou don't carry over your stats but you\ncarry over your xp\nbetween incarnations and what you're\ndescribing to me\nis is a generally non-materialistic\nsentiment\nwhich would be interpreted by some of my\nteachers as a sign of past spiritual\nwork\nwhich oddly enough is oftentimes\ncoupled with a lot of material success\nand is sort of the formula this is why\nlike buddha was sort of the same way too\nand he was born as a prince so his karma\nwas like\nspawn like picking a spawn point where\nyou can continue to grow spiritually\nand you carry some of your xp with you\nso this is something that i've just seen\ntime and again i don't know if this is\nlike a bias on my part where i'm looking\nfor it so therefore i find it\nbut i oftentimes find that people who\nare not very materialistic\nand are quite materialistically\nsuccessful and unhappy\ndespite their materialistic success wind\nup\nin conversations with me\nyeah i mean i think so i mean i think\nthat's the reason why\nyeah i i of course that makes sense\nnow just to kind of i'm going to try to\nclose the loop and maybe wrap things up\nand give you a direction to go does that\nsound okay to you or\nwould you like to kind of okay um so i\nthink going forward\nzach if i had to make one recommendation\nfor you\nit would be to really explore this theme\nof powerlessness in your life\nand so like have there been times or\nmoments where you\nfelt that inevitability of decay\nand i i recognize that it manifests in\ngaming in your life but i i really think\nabout these moments like\nwhen you couldn't call an ambulance like\nthat's perfect that's exactly what we're\ntalking about right\nthere's a sense of like there is no\nmatter how hard you try\nand what you do\nthey're like you know there's nothing no\namount of your effort will succeed\nand as you track back and discover those\nmoments in your life i know you've tried\nto jump in for twice now\num as you track back and try to find\nthose moments in your life and as you\nactually\nif you can evoke that feeling of\npowerlessness in the present\nmy hypothesis is that your fear of decay\nwill go with it so\nhow do how do i evoke a moment of\npowerlessness without having\ncontrol over the powerlessness making\nthe paradox\nmaking me mean mean it's irrelevant\nbecause like if you yeah that that's\nwhat's confusing to me like\nhow do you memory yeah\nso so so the way you evoke the feeling\nis because the the dorm\nthe emotion is going to be dormant so\nthe problem is that like\nlike you bro have you ever worked with a\ntherapist by the way never\nso i think if you wanted to see a\ntherapist i think this is what you could\nwork on with someone so like you're\ngonna go in week after week after week\nand you're gonna talk about these\nexperiences and if you find a decent\ntherapist\nthey're going to find ways\nto ask you questions that are going to\nevoke emotion\nbecause i don't know if you can tell but\nover the course of this entire\nconversation\nwe keep on moving away from emotion by\ntalking intellectually and\nphilosophically\nwell how do you talk in terms of emotion\nbecause like for me i i just the\nemotions are there\nyeah i mean it made me feel bad i don't\nreally know exactly how much more i can\ndescribe\nabout it\ni'm not yeah you think about whether so\ni can't tell you the answer to that\nquestion i have to show you\nokay because telling you the answer to\nthe question is operating on an\nintellectual level and moving in the\nopposite direction that we need to\nyeah it's like even yeah talking about\nit\nmakes it irrelevant in a way yeah so i\nthink it's like\nit's like slow conversations where\nyou know sometimes when i interview\npeople like emotions come out\ni think you have a interesting natural\ndamage resistance from being on the road\nto enlightenment\nand then you have an additional coping\nmechanism which sort of like suppresses\nand buries some of those emotions\nthe third thing that could be going on\nis that these circuits of your brain\nare suppressed by playing video games\nyeah i mean there's there's part of that\ni mean i i think that it's also\nlike i i don't want to let go\nof things that i i had i think that's\ndefinitely what it is i'm very attached\nto things that i had and\nyou know i remember i saw a friend of\nmine i'd never\nseen this guy i haven't seen this guy\nsince like high school and\nit was the day before i came back to\nstreaming like last year i think\nand i remember i talked to him and this\nis going to sound\nabsolutely degenerate and that's because\nit is but i always tell the story of a\nfriend of mine\nwho drew a female dragon masturbating\non a chalkboard on the first day of\nschool and he was the guy that did that\nand i mentioned it to him and he\nremembered it and that meant so much to\nme because nobody else in the whole\nworld\nthought that [ __ ] was thought that\n[ __ ] was true nobody else thought that\nwas true and i remember seeing him\nand like i drove home and i cried in the\ncar\nbecause i got a chance to\nto remember that it was real\nyou know this sounds weird zach but like\ni don't know exactly where that story\ncomes from but what i'm hearing from you\nis the way to do what i'm telling you to\ndo\nand it wasn't just like that moment that\nmoment was just like one thing right but\nit was like everything about that you\nknow the life that we lived\nuh just everything it was great\ni i give anything to go back there i\nwould\nwhat are you feeling now\ni was half my life ago i feel like it\nwasn't\nlike it feels like it was the the i mean\nobviously\nthis feels a while ago now unfortunately\nbut um\nit felt uh it just sucks man\nyou can never go back\nso i i could see emotion coming up yeah\nand you got to watch out for for twitch\nchat because they're going to bury it\nright so oh yeah so so like like\nsomething came up there\nyou shared a story yeah and then you\nfelt emotion\nyeah i do buried it's gone now\nyou see that yeah i mean i've never\nreally been a particularly emotional\nperson\ni feel like any time that i show my\nemotions it's not good\nthey're mostly bad mostly bad emotions\nyeah so i think we've gotta teach you\nhow to let that stuff out\nand i i when i said i i wasn't\noptimistic but i think you just did it\nyeah right and it's weird but like as\nyou told that story like\nwe were just talking about something you\ntell the story about\nyou know a friend of yours who drew\na picture of i i want to really\nemphasize because it sounds [ __ ]\nweird\nthat it was not really about the moment\nitself it's what the moment represented\nand all the justifications in the world\nare going to move away from the emotion\nyeah you don't have to justify anything\nthis is just like i don't know why but\nyou just did it\nwhen you asked me how do i do it i don't\nknow you just did\nand this is what i it's weird it's just\nyou have to go back to the memory\nand like something about sharing that\nwith him in that moment\nfor things that you had started to doubt\nand push away\nand buried came up and it's painful but\nit's cathartic\nyeah yeah it is i never thought i'd see\nhim again\nyeah i never thought it would happen\nso there are all kinds of\ninterpretations we can make there like\nso for example the power of that moment\nis something that you thought\nwas inevitable became not inevitable\nexactly you would never get closure and\nso we can see how that's powerful for\nyou because like what's your problem\nit's that the inevitable is inevitable\nand here's a here's a chance here's a\nmoment\nwhere that doesn't have to be the case\nand it's it's like painful but it's also\nhopeful\nokay i can see that i i don't know i\nmean that's an interpretation but that\nalso is like\nme going intellectually i don't know if\nthat's actually [ __ ] true or not the\npoint though is i don't know what you\njust did but you need to do more of it\nyeah maybe i mean i don't know it just\nsucks like it it's sad because like\ni used to i used to be like really happy\nabout that kind of [ __ ]\nand now i don't really have that same\nexperience anymore\nand i don't know like and i feel like i\ncan never have that back because it was\nuh\nthe context of my life you know it's\nlike\nmy parents were healthy i didn't have to\nworry about a job\ni didn't have to worry about a bunch of\nother weird [ __ ] it was just me and\nthe boys hanging out all the time\ndrawing dragons on a chalkboard and you\nknow riding the bus home together\nsinging along to rap songs and that was\ngood\nit really was good\nhow are your parents zach\ncould be better could be worse\nthey're all right\nit doesn't sound like they're all right\nuh well\nthe thing is there's a degree of all\nright it's kind of like uh\nso you're getting away you're going down\nthe wrong side of the mountain\nwell let me let me explain what i'm\nsaying right it's like uh\ni was saying before about how like\nthings get worse so slowly that you\ndon't realize that they're happening and\nthen you slowly just accept how bad that\nthey are\nyeah there's a day that my mom started\nusing a cane to walk around\nthat was really painful for me to see\nand it really hurt me a lot\nbut because it's happened for like now\nfor a while\ni don't feel the same level of\nin like visceral reaction whenever i see\nher doing it now\nbecause i like to see your mom walk with\na cane for the first time\ni it is terrible it's horrible\nwhat was terrible about it uh\nit's like it's one step down\ndown that mountain you know\nare a number of steps\nand it wasn't like it wasn't like a\nreally emotional feeling i guess\nit was just like kind of uh [ __ ]\ni got it it was just i don't know i\ncan't really even describe it\nso i i think zach this is going to take\nsome work\nright so i think um but i i do\nstill feel optimistic that like\nthere are too many things here that seem\nquite familiar to me\nthat i've seen end in a good place\nwell that's good that that's that's a\nrelief\nright so so i think part of the issue\nhere is that as you\nas you say i can't describe it so like\nyeah\nlike yeah that's the problem is like\nit's it's not about thinking about it\nlike i don't know\nbecause it because thinking about it\nisn't the right thing i'm gonna go back\nto the you know the\nthe dragon on the chalkboard as an\nexample yeah there are certain ways\nthey're like shortcuts level skips\nand like something about that story was\nlike\nthe secret tunnel at the end of the\nmario brothers level that warps you to\nwork\nworld four and it's not a logical chain\nand you can logically chain it out as\nmuch as you want to and that's not going\nto be that effective the real thing is\ndigging around for those level skips and\nwhen you had that level skip the emotion\ncame right up like it was like\ni mean i think everyone saw it like\nyou're at the verge of tears\nand yeah because i got you you can just\nfor a moment\ngo back you can just for a moment go\nback and realize how good it used to be\nso i'm also hearing themes of not just\npower and\nuh powerlessness and inevitability but\nof loss\nright yeah yeah i would say so and and\nso that's also worth digging into i\nthink\nyou know zach of all the people that\nwe've talked to on stream i i would\nstrongly recommend that you\nreally think about finding someone to do\nthis kind of work\nyeah maybe i mean i i try to uh\ni try not to think about it as much as i\ncan\nand maybe maybe i should try to think\nabout it more\nyeah so maybe thinking about it isn't\nthe right move\nworking on it\nbut by all means think about it i think\nit's it's your\nyou know i don't know if you play d but\nyou've got an 18 on int\nthanks but this is where this is where\nlike i don't know what your wisdom is\nright like there's some other dimension\nof your being which i think you\nover rationalize intellectualize and\nphilosophize to get away from your\nkind of like emotional stuff but i you\nknow if you want to think about it by\nall means go for it\nwell yeah like it's like you spend time\nwith yourself\nprocessing it it's like you'll lay in\nbed like a lot of times i'll lay in bed\nwithout even\nno music not on my phone and i'll just\nkind of experience\nmyself you know it's like a form of\ni guess like uh uh uncultured medita\nmeditation\nyeah uncultured yeah i think it's\nit's um it's interesting to see\nyeah um\nhow unrefined do you think you are\nuh yeah i mean it's i mean there are a\nlot of techniques and things like that\nyou can deal with\nbut it's hard to it's\nsorry i was just thinking i was thinking\nof something um\ni uh there are a lot of techniques that\nyou can use\nand it's hard to really know what works\nand what doesn't\nof course yep\nand that's why i would encourage you to\nseek guidance from someone who's maybe a\nlittle bit more experienced\nand who can show you what the right\ntechnique is\nyeah maybe i mean i've thought about\nlike i i try to\nlike a lot of times i would try to\nlike watch videos about video games and\nstuff like that\nand this is kind of not really the same\nthing but it's kind of the same type of\nidea\nof like bettering yourself and nowadays\ni will always try to watch videos and\ndo things and and uh read about things\nthat kind of matter\ni guess to an extent like history and\nyou know\nmathematics and stuff like that and i've\ntried to\nlearn more and and be a better version\nof myself\njust so i can i can process things\nbetter and and think and\nhave the ability to have that that\nknowledge\nuh like for me i i i'm lucky in a way\nthat i have a very good memory\nbut i waste that memory on remembering\nvideo games\nyeah i'm getting all kinds of weird\nsignals from you i know\num i i don't mean that to be judgmental\nbut it's just it feels like we're\nopening up\nnew and new avenues of conversation\nbecause now i have questions like are\nyou proud of yourself\nor other people proud of you other\npeople are\nare you proud of yourself i've done some\ngood things\nit's all right could be better it always\ncan be better\nso that's a no\num i i think that\nit's like i'd say it's like it's let me\ntell you what that is\nthat's a no cloaked and coping and\npositivity\nwell it's like i mean no it it's a no\nit's inter it's an intellectualized note\nbecause like i've i've succeeded in a\nnumber of things on a very\nuh on a very real level right like i\ni've\ni've done this i've done that i've\nsucceeded at this i've succeeded at that\nlike all these things are things that\ni'm proud of but at the same time i feel\nlike i could do more\nor i i'm not living up to what potential\nthat i have in my own mind\nthe question isn't whether you've done\nthings that you\ncan be proud of the question is are you\nproud of yourself\num\ni don't know it's an interesting\nquestion i i don't know\nlike i i would obviously like the first\nthing that i would say is is no end yes\nbecause i've been very happy you know in\na lot of ways like hanging out with my\nfriends like doing what i want to do et\ncetera\nbut is that something to be proud of do\nyou do you have to be proud of yourself\nto be fulfilled\nyeah so because like a lot of the sense\nof pride\nit's like pride in general like oh in\nthis case\nto some degree is like a construct that\nexists\nin context of society so like\ndo i am i proud of you know these\naccomplishments that i've had in real\nlife\nwell yes to an extent but these\naccomplishments that i have\nin real life are these are constructs\nthat exist\nin society these are not things that are\ninternal these are not\nuh it doesn't really matter\nyeah so when i ask you a question about\nwhether you have pride in yourself\nyeah how do you answer\nwell that the answer is is very simple i\ndon't know\nand like i'm proud of some things i'm\nnot of others i think that's probably\nand it's a [ __ ] answer 100 it's a [ __ ]\nanswer but like there it is\nyeah so i i think we're\ni'm sort of feeling like i don't know\nthat we're gonna get to somewhere very\nproductive\nfrom this conversation i think that\nthese are all important conversations\ni'm sort of taxed at this point um i\nfeel like i'm oom\nyeah i'm probably go way down afterwards\nuh\nand so what i would say to you zach is\nthat like when i ask you a question\nabout your feelings your answer appears\nto be philosophical or intellectual in\nnature you start talking about\nconstructs in society where is what i'm\nat like\npride is an emotion\nuh i mean aren't they the same thing\nwhat\ni think so like i mean in a way right\nbecause you have like shame\nand like so if you're ashamed of um not\nhaving a nice car\nor something like that that's completely\na society construct that's some that's\nnot something that really\nmeans a whole lot in the grand scheme of\nthings doesn't really mean a lot as a\nperson doesn't make you\ngrow as a person this just exists as\na thing that you do to make society want\nto to care about you\nno okay so shame\nis a subjective experience can shame be\ncaused by certain societal things\nabsolutely\nbut shame is within\nright so like for example depending on\nthe societal construct\ni can be ashamed of my skin color or my\ngrades\nor the clothes that i wear completely\nagree but the experience of shame for\nthose\nfive people depending on the societal\nconstructs is still subjective\nit's an experience of emotion\nis it triggered by societal constructs\ndo societal constructs\nhave something to do with it absolutely\nbut at the end of the day like anger or\nemotion is not a societal construct\nemotion can be triggered by a societal\nconstruct sure\ndo are certain people's neurons wired to\nelicit particular emotions\nbased on certain societal constructs\nabsolutely\nyeah but fundamentally i think what i'm\nhearing from you\nis that when we go towards emotion\nyour mind interprets intellectualizes\nrationalizes and if we think about the\nstory of the chalkboard\nthere's no interpretation there it's\njust raw emotion\nyeah i mean i i think there's a lot of\ncontext behind it\nof course i mean like yeah yeah i mean\nthere's a lot of like actual\nthings that happened yeah but like like\nconcepts in the mind are of\nfundamentally different\nstuff than emotions in the mind\nit's like woodworking and like\nyou know alchemy like it's different\nstuff\ndifferent mats yeah\nand what i find is that you tend to\nalways go towards the\nintellectualization the philosophization\nwhich i think is absolutely one of your\nstrengths\none of your coping mechanisms and one of\nthe ways that your neurons is wired\nand that i think that you're going to\ngain a lot like i don't think you're\ngoing to be able to logic your way\nout of the fear of decay\nwhich is really what i'd call it it's\nnot death it's like the powerlessness\nand inevitability or maybe you can\nactually you can\nbut i think that you're going to get far\nbetter results\nby learning like picking up a different\nsecondary skill on your wow character\nbecause\nyou know you can try to you can chug\npotions to increase all your stats but\nat some point it's just more efficient\nto craft yourself some armor and put\nthat [ __ ] on\nand what i'm hearing is that you're a\ngrandmaster potion maker who's trying to\nmake potions instead of wearing armor\nyeah i mean i i could see that sure i\ni i i think for me like there have been\nemotions like shame and things like that\nthat i've had to overcome\nand like you know i said about going to\nthat school and then feeling ashamed of\nmyself and so\ni've gotten through some of those things\nfor sure\nbut uh some other ones not as much yeah\nso i think it's just a new skill that\nyou can learn\nyeah and um you know i think if you have\nquestions or more you know if you want\nmore detailed information about that\nlike i i feel kind of spent at the\nmoment so\ni don't know but but i'd say that you\nknow feel free to like sleep on it or i\nneed to sleep on it and if you're kind\nof\ncurious about that or want to learn more\njust you know\nping us i think generally speaking when\npeople come on stream i think we'll send\nyou like a packet of information about\npotentially like put options for\nfollow-up and how to find a therapist\nand things like that if you're curious\nabout that but\num overall i i think\nyou know i i really can\ni feel like i understand a lot of what\nyou're going through and i don't\nthink it is quite as inevitable\nand i think it's i i think it's solvable\ni think you're walking a difficult road\nbut it's a road that many people have\nwalked before and you seem to have\na lot of the karmic signs that other\npeople who have walked to this road have\nwalked\nokay our tendency for not being\nmaterialistic\na lot of worldly success early in life\nin a sense of dissatisfaction that's the\nspiritual road and laying on top of that\nthat i think you're going to have to\nprocess\nis more of like a neuronal psychological\nlike fear of decay and inevitability and\nand\nbeing powerless in the face of certain\nthings which if we really think about it\nsounds like the fear of death but the\nmore that we tunnel into it\nwe actually discover that when faced\nwith death you're a chad\nyou know and and and so like as\nterrifying as that is like you actually\nknow how to accept you know how to\naccept parts of yourself you know how to\nface\ndeath actually um with some degree of\nterror\nand grounding yeah there were a number\nof times when i was younger i would do\nthings that would\nget me pretty close to it or\npretty close to at least a lot of\nmaterial harm yeah\nthat yeah is another thing that i find\nmyself being curious about but don't\nthink i have the mana for the encounter\noh don't worry if you did i wouldn't\ncast a spell\num zach are you\nokay with our conversation today yeah\ni'm great i really appreciate you\nbringing me on and talking about it i i\nhope that you know i talk about these\nthings and the reason why i come on is i\nthink that the idea of this is that\ni i think it's important to have people\nput themselves out there and and show\nthat this kind of stuff like mental\nhealth and\njust to a greater extent being able to\ntalk about your problems and\ni think people will watch what i say and\nthen they will\nrelate to it and that will help them so\neven if it might make me look weird or\nlook bad\nthe greater good for it is worth it does\nthat make sense\nyeah of course yeah um do you think you\nlook bad\ni think so i think any time that a\nperson reveals their emotions at all\nuh there are a lot of people that um\nthat resent that\ndo you think you look bad no\nokay i don't think you look bad at all\nthank you i think you're quite handsome\nwell at least that's one of us right\n[Laughter]\nall right zach thank you very much um\nyou know i hope you\nhave fun playing burning crusade me too\ni i hope you get more enjoyment out of\nnew world in three days\ni'm certainly looking forward to it\nreally was anyway\nyeah and then yeah go ahead\nmaybe once you find inner peace you can\nstart developing games for the rest of\nus\nyeah i've never been i like the idea of\nmaking games sometimes but\ni took a coding class and it didn't go\ntoo well so\ni think i'd have to be the idea idea guy\nthere the vision person\nsure let's go we'll see all right thanks\na lot man\ni appreciate it thanks for having me on\nand uh i'll talk to you later see ya all\nright\nsee ya peace um\nlet's okay chat\nthat was that was fun that was great you\nknow i think zack is fantastic man\nsuch a good dude"
