    "transcript": "announcement yes yeah let's do it uh let\nme take this off\nso that you can are we announcing\nsomething we're announcing something\nhi um do you want to come out of\nthe chat box chat's literal shadow first\nof all\nchad is saying new baby no well maybe\nkind of actually a little bit\nso the new baby is\nour nonprofit uh we just established the\nhealthy gamer foundation\num\nyeah it's it's i'm actually really\nexcited about this\nwhat we kind of have realized is healthy\ngamer\nwhat we do here is we create products\nand services\nand content that help people\nmove forward so it's really like\nsomething that helps fill the gaps of\nwhat the system has kind of left to be\ndesired\num and the foundation is really more\nabout changing the system\nmore directly so we will be funding and\ndirectly conducting\nresearch we will be um\nkind of applying that research to policy\ninitiatives that help\nchange the game for mental health um\nacross the board\nthe more i kind of it's funny because\nthis is all prompted by\num an lsf fundraiser lsf reached out and\nsaid hey we want to do something for\nmental health awareness month\nlet's partner up and we said awesome\nthis is great and then we got some\nconstructive criticism for you know why\nwould this support a company and this\nand that\nand i think um you know i stand behind\nthe company and what we do and we do a\nlot of charitable work we do a lot of\ncommunity first work\nbut i think our goal\nyou know even outside of healthy gamer\nis just affordable\naccessible inclusive mental health and\nif we can do that in a more systematic\nway through a non-profit let's do that a\nyear ago you guys were\nso generous and bjerg was actually so\ngenerous\nin supporting our fundraiser to just get\nhealthy gamer\ncoaching off the ground and since then\nin just a quick trip down memory lane we\nraised 125 000\nlast may um rather unexpectedly\nwe had no idea that it would go this way\nand then we\nturned it into a coaching program\ncranked out\nmore content shot dr k's guide to mental\nhealth\num have have done\na ton and still i think we can do more\nand some of that is outside of the realm\nof what\nyou know a company would do and it's\nmore about\nwhat a movement or a non-profit can\nreally do\nso i'm really excited um i never thought\ni would\nkind of say like to the trolls of reddit\nthank you\nbut it really thank you like you guys\npushed us to kind of say like is this\nreally the best resource\num the best way forward so\nwe're doing it yeah so like\nin general you know if you guys have\nissues with what we're doing just let us\nknow like we're here to\nwe're people we respond we listen yeah i\ni think that like\nyou know it sort of makes sense right\nbecause we're incorporated right now as\nlike a limited liability company and\nlike\nshould charitable donations go to a\nfor-profit company i think it makes\nperfect sense so like we're trying to\nsort of separate some of these things\nout\num and and we're really here to help you\nguys and i think like healthy gamer has\nbeen like\nan evolving project we're definitely not\num you know it's been like one step at a\ntime\nand so if you guys have other\nsuggestions or thoughts or criticism you\nknow people in the past have raised like\nethical\nissues about you know people coming on\nstream and stuff like that like those\nall\ni think we take super seriously um\nyou know i i think we try to do the best\nthat we can and we are by no means\nperfect and so i think a lot of what\nhealthy gamer has become\nhas been because of what you guys asked\nfor and what you guys point out\nand and like that's ultimately our\ncompass is what does this community need\nand based on what you guys need we're\ngoing to do our best to provide it\nbecause it's the mission of like this\norganization and\ni mean it's crazy that it's actually an\norganization now\num two but uh\nit is to really try to help you guys and\nit's like what do y'all need\ni've been going down a rabbit hole for\nnon-profits and kind of what they do and\nwhat they don't do\nand i think um i wanted to kind of just\nshare a little bit about\ni think our place in all of this so\ni looked up non-profits that offer kind\nof emergency services\nand many many many of those that are\nkind of under five million dollars\nannually are local\nthey're place based there are very few\nservices that are kind of\ninternational or kind of cross literal\nborders\nthen looking up kind of mental health\nnon-profits\nvery few that focus on um\nanything other than women or children\nand\ni think there there is work to be done\nfor general young people like high\nfunctioning\ncontributing members of society um\nor like could be would be and\ni know i know we joke about like being d\ngens and stuff like that but i think\nthere needs to be like just baseline\nbetter mental health\nnot necessarily crisis not necessarily\nfor\nlike a certain pop like just women just\nchildren just this just that\ni think just affordable inclusive\naccessible mental health care for young\npeople in general\nmodern mental health is is so\nunderserved right you look at our mental\nhealth needs right now they're an\nall-time high and sixty percent of\num the psychological workforce is\nactually over the age of 50.\nso what we're proposing is fresh ideas\nfresh solutions\nfresh people to kind of tackle what\nmodern mental health kind of could and\nshould be\nso healthy gamer the company is all\nabout\ncreating products and services that fill\nthe gaps of today\nand the foundation is all about changing\nthe system of tomorrow\ni don't think they're paying attention\nanymore i don't think so either but\ni have to it has to be said sorry\ngood job good job\nso mental health awareness month all\nfunds are gonna go to the nonprofit this\nmonth everything that we raised from the\nstream\nfrom merch sales etc we'll be going to\nsee the non-profit so thanks for\neverybody's support\nand thanks to bert bjerg for coming on\nyeah burger's legit dude\nand donating um a year ago that was\nawesome"
