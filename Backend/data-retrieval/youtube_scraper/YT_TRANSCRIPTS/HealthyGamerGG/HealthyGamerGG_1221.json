    "transcript": "part of the reason that we're excited\nabout sort of talking about imposter\nsyndrome today it's something that\naffects a lot of content creators\nbut we recently launched uh like a beta\nprogram for like people\nlike high potential and high performance\nfolks from our community\nand it seems like imposter syndrome kind\nof crops up\na lot in that group so for those of you\nwho don't know we have a\nwe're running like a beta program for\ngroup coaching for people who are like\nwhat we call hypos or hypers\nso hypo stands for high potential if we\nlook at our community there's a\nthere's kind of like different themes\nthat different people need some people\nneed to learn self-compassion some\npeople need to learn\nhow to forgive some people need to learn\nhow to overcome procrastination\nand so we have this high potential group\nwhich there are about 13 spots left in\nour beta\nand the group is geared towards helping\npeople who are like sort of lacking\nlife purpose lacking discipline feeling\nisolated feeling like they have low\nself-esteem and confidence\nlike this is sort of geared towards the\nstudent population so a lot of times\nthese people are actually like quite\nfunctional and quite successful\nacademically and so we're trying to sort\nof serve that population a little bit\nbetter\nso if you guys are interested y'all can\nsign up we've got 13 spots left in our\nbeta\nyou know another thing that comes up we\nsee this a lot especially for like the\nivy league students and stuff that we\nhave in our community is that they've\ngot some imposter syndrome so hopefully\nwe'll dig into that try to understand it\na little bit better\nhow you doing man i'm doing good how are\nyou\ni'm doing well i had a little bit of a\nrough night my kid woke up randomly like\nsuper early in the morning and came and\nwoke me up\nso didn't get quite a full night's sleep\nbut part of being a parent you know\nyeah how old is your kid i have a\nfive-year-old and a three-year-old oh\nthose are those are definitely waking up\nearly ages\nyeah it's it's it can be fun\nbut yeah it's very very fun and and what\ndo you go by\nuh usually just by ethan ethan okay um\nyeah and yeah man so um\nyou want to talk about something in\nparticular today or\num i mean yes and no\nlike kind of down to just go with the\nflow but\num yeah the main thing uh i guess was\njust\nuh imposter syndrome was a big thing\nuh and uh yeah just sort of the\npressures of\nbeing a content creator and a person\nonline absolutely i just took a month\noff of youtube\nuh which was really huge and sort of\nlike very\neye-opening for me um yeah so\nyou want to just actually start off by\ntelling us a little bit about where\npeople can find you and\nand what kind of content you make yeah\nuh so i do\nmostly youtube and and streaming stuff\njust crank game plays\neverywhere i've been doing it for\nit'll be nine years in august\ni started when i was 15. um\nyeah and uh it's been a it's been a\ncrazy little\nlittle journey yeah sounds like a little\nbit longer than a little journey\nyeah yeah it's it's been a long time\nwhich is weird because it both\nseems like it hasn't i haven't been\ndoing this for a long time and i've been\ndoing it for\nan eternity wow incredible\nand so what what kind of um so crank\ngame plans i assume you play games\nyeah mostly gaming stuff i'm trying to\nnow branch out a little bit more\nuh just because again i've been doing it\nfor almost nine years\nand i want to do something uh i want to\nmake more content that's a little more\nlike creatively\nfulfilling um just because after doing\nit for so long it's not as much of a\nchallenge anymore and i do really like\nfiguring things out and\nyou know being a little bit more\ncreative um\nyeah and i just uh i just finished doing\na channel\nwith a friend of mine for a year we made\nwe made videos for a year\nand then deleted everything um\nand that was all we made a video every\nsingle day\ndoing just like random [ __ ]\nfor most of the time\nso it sort of adds i guess there's sort\nof this timeless quality to youtube\nvideos\nand um and and then you guys i guess\nmade it i guess\nwhat would did you guys want to delete\neverything like\nyeah yeah that was frustration no that\nwas that was the goal from the beginning\nthe channel was called unis honest which\nmeans one year in latin and so we were\nevery video started with a timer of how\nmuch time was left\nuh and so we did a year's worth of\nvideos and then we ended it with\na 12 hour live stream where at the end\nof the live stream we deleted the\nchannel\nwhile we were streaming from it and wow\neverything went away\nthat sounds like quite creatively\nfulfilling\nyeah it was it was really really awesome\num it was super stressful but\nuh it was like definitely\nan awakening i think for both of us\nbeing like oh wow like\ndoing this kind of stuff is really\nreally fun and also we don't just have\nto do\ngaming stuff like we can do other things\nthat sounds really great man i'm\nyou know it's interesting because you\nwere saying you want to creatively\nbranch out but that sounds like i've\nnever heard of anyone doing anything\nlike that before\nyeah i think that's why i want to branch\nout more just because that was so\nfulfilling\nin every single day was something\ndifferent um\nand so yeah it just it helped\nmy brain a lot actually\ncan i think for a second yeah\nso ethan i'm noticing sort of like an\ninteresting branch point already\nwhereas i i know so i know a lot of\ntimes like people come on here and\nand the idea is that we're going to talk\nabout something negative like imposter\nsyndrome and bad emotions\nand burnout but um honestly like half\nthe work that i do is\nis literally has nothing to do with the\nnegative it's sort of like bridging\npeople from\nlet's say like the journey from being\nlike depressed and then like one day\npeople will come into my office and then\nwe'll sort of have this conversation\nabout\nyou're not depressed anymore you're just\nunhappy\nand that there's a difference oh thanks\nson\num and there's a difference between\nbeing unhappy\nand being depressed and so when i think\na little bit about like you know you\nsaid you took a month off and that was\nyou know it sounds like it was\nrejuvenating and maybe there's some\namount of imposter syndrome\nthere's also this sort of like personal\ndevelopment arc\nor like personal growth arc finding\nfulfillment what is the nature of\nsuffering\nwhat is the nature of happiness what is\nthe nature of contentment\nwhen when we sort of have those kinds of\nconversations we can still draw a little\nbit\non science so we can talk about like\nmaslow or there's a psychologist named\neric erickson\nso you know in the west we have a lot of\nthis stuff but we also can draw a lot on\nkind of eastern principles of\nspirituality\nstoicism um almost take a slightly more\nphilosophical approach\nand and it's odd ethan but like when i'm\nsitting across from you\nthere's a part of me that just kind of\nlike feels like maybe that's the\ndirection we need to go at some point in\nthe conversation\nyeah yeah for anything\nthat's the other thing is like i don't\neven really know what i want to talk\nabout\nnecessarily um which is also like\nanother thing that i\nhave a hard time with like my adhd is\npretty bad uh and so like\nhaving having conversations and me\nhaving coherent thoughts\nis also something that i struggle with\num\nyeah so if i ever get lost in the\nconversation\num that's why yeah so\nokay so why don't can you just start\nwith telling us a little bit about like\nhow you started on\non youtube and what kind of inspired you\nto\ncreate content uh yeah it was basically\nboredom um me and my best friend from\nback home\none summer in august of 2012\nuh we were just bored one night and we\nhad been watching a bunch of different\nyoutubers it was\nmainly like pewdiepie and the game\ngrumps and we were like\nhuh like you have a computer and we like\nmessing around on camera like let's just\ndo this because\nthey do it and we like video games so\nwhy not\nuh and that's that's how it started and\nthen eventually i just went off on my\nown and\nand made videos and um yeah it mainly\nstemmed from\nboredom and then it grew into this\npassion um\nin this thing that i really really love\nto do and i had been making\nrandom videos uh since i was a kid like\njust like home videos\nmy brother and then once youtube came\nout just like random youtube videos here\nand there with some friends\num and that's what i wanted to do when i\nwas a kid\nnot specifically be a youtuber but i\nwanted to be an\nentertainer in some sense like i wanted\nto be an actor for a really long time\num and then i found youtube and it was\nlike oh it's sort of like this new\nwave of entertainment or whatever\nabsolutely and then it just kind of\nhappened\nand so what was it that appealed to you\nabout being an actor or entertainer\nuh probably at the time when i was a kid\nit was being the center\nof attention i was always just pining\nfor people's attention\nall the time um and that's something\nthat i'm even\nlike really insecure about because\nlooking back\nat like home videos and stuff like that\nor even my older videos from when i\nfirst started\ni feel super embarrassed by them and\nlike i'll show them to people because i\nknow that's\npart of it like that's part of like hey\nlook where i came from\nblah blah but it is kind of embarrassing\nuh\njust seeing that kid and being like oh\nyou're trying so hard\nwhat's embarrassing about that um\ni think it's i think it's that thing of\nlike oh you're trying\nso hard to like be the center of\nattention and\nyou're being like too much\num and like too bombastic and crazy and\nstuff like that\num and that's that's also kind of what i\nwas being told\nwhen i was a kid too sure not\nnecessarily by\nmy family sometimes by my family um\nbut like i didn't do well in school and\nmy teachers\nwere always like hey like you need to\nsettle down\num blah blah and it was also back in a\ntime where\num you know adhd was still not really\nunderstood that much sure um and it was\njust like oh you\ndon't have an actual mental thing going\non you just have too much energy and\nyour disruption to the class\num yeah you know ethan it's it's so\nit's sometimes so sad like how\nkids with adhd like we place value\njudgments on them\nright like you're being a bad kid yeah\nand\nand and it's it's actually quite\ndevastating like i i've seen this a lot\nwhere it's like\na lot of people with adhd just feel they\ncarry around\nso much like shame from early in their\nlife that they don't even understand\nbecause it's it's been so normal to them\nyeah you know that they're they're being\ntold to function in an environment that\ntheir brain just isn't suited for\num and and it can be really rough so i'm\nsorry you were in that\nsituation and it sounds like you know\npeople weren't happy with you\nyeah no and that's that's something that\ni've struggled with\nfor a really long time not only like\nthe thought of like oh i was a bad kid\nand i know that i wasn't\na bad kid or anything um but i've always\nfelt stupid\nlike my entire life um and that's\nsomething that i'd still struggle with\nnow\nand i think it really comes from that\nand come\ncomes from me being in school and not\nbeing able to learn\nthe way that everybody else learned um\nand so i just thought i was stupid\nbecause i just didn't\ni just didn't get it and you know\nobviously like i went to a public school\nso it was\nyou know 170 or 140 kids in my grade and\nso it's not like the teachers can\nindividually teach kids in the way that\nthey learn\nlike it's just not realistic but yeah my\nwhole life i've sort of dealt with that\nwith\nand i know that i'm not stupid but\nthat's always been a thing in the back\nof my mind like i feel dumb\nall the time okay\nwhich i think also contributes to my\nimposters intro\nsure so we can talk about\nhmm\nso i i'm finding so many different forks\nin the road ethan\nand i don't know what direction to take\nthings so i'm gonna need your help\nyeah and we can go we can go anywhere\nso i think it's actually incredibly\ninsightful for you to say\ni know i'm not stupid but i carry this\nfeeling around\nand there's a part of me that's like\nwants to just\nexplain to you or like ask you like how\ndoes that work\nand then even explain to you like this\nis where we go into a little bit more of\nlike teaching mode\nwhere you know i i can i can because a\nlot of people don't understand that it\ncan be really confusing that like i know\ni'm not stupid\nand it's kind of weird right because\neven when you show home videos to people\nyou're kind of owning that insecurity\nyou're kind of saying i'm not going to\nlet the insecurity like i'm i actually\nam confident in myself i'm confident\nwith how far i've come and so showing\npeople like\nhome videos of the blunder years if you\nreally think about it is actually a sign\nof like confidence\nand at the same time you feel insecure\ndoing it even though there's a part of\nyou that's like yeah this is where i\ncame from i should be proud of it like\ni've come a long way like\nwow like i really didn't you know know\nmuch back then\nand so it's almost like you have these\ntwo opposite poles that exist within you\nat the same time does that make sense\nyeah\num and and i think that there's some\nvalue to be gained a little bit about\nyou know understanding like how how does\nthat work because like no one teaches us\nlike\nwhy does my mind do these things yeah um\nand if you want to we can kind of go\ndown that route\nuh we can also talk a little bit about\nimposter syndrome which i think it has\nmaybe something to do with that but but\ni think there's more to it than that\nusually\num or what we can do is you know i can\nask you questions about how you felt\nstupid and then\nyou can end up becoming emotional on\nstream\nif that's the right because that\nsometimes that's what people are looking\nfor they're looking for like\nemotional catharsis as opposed to\nteaching and yeah and it really\nit's like what are you in the mood for\nbro i'm\ni'm down for anything um i'll cry on\nstream if you want me to\nit's not about what i want man it's\nabout what you want uh\nlet's let's explore that that first path\na little bit\nokay so how do you understand\nno like okay i'm gonna ask you a\nquestion okay are you stupid\nno i'm not stupid why do you feel that\nway\num oh now that's a good question\num i mean it's just something that i\nknow\ni know i'm not stupid um i\ni i'm aware that my brain just works in\nin different ways than other than other\npeople's do\nyeah and when i get into the i think i\nknow i'm not stupid because i've proved\nto myself that i'm not stupid\nbecause in the right environment i can\nthrive\num and that even happened in school\nwhere\nspecifically um in physics\ni did really well in that class because\nwe did a lot of hands-on stuff\nwhere like the teacher showed actual\nexamples of the way that things worked\nand it was like oh like this is this is\nsomething that\nthat's being shown right in front of me\nand also we're doing like hands-on stuff\nand so like i could figure out how it\nworked\nand i did really well in that class\nbecause i was in the correct environment\nand so there have been a lot of things\nlike that where it's like oh i know i'm\nnot stupid because i\ni'm actually doing well at this thing i\njust learn differently\nyeah so so now i'm gonna i'm gonna you\nknow\nthis is gonna be tough for you ethan so\ni'm gonna press you okay because i think\nyou're not stupid at all\ni think you're incredibly insightful i\nthink you're a smart guy\nso i'm gonna ask you hard questions is\nthat okay\nyeah are you feeling anxious if i say\nsomething like that\nno i i don't feel anxious about it at\nall i'm down for anything\nokay so so if you have proven to\nyourself\nthat you're not stupid why do you still\nsometimes feel stupid\num i think i feel that way because\nmost of the time i'm not in\nthat kind of environment where i do feel\nwhere i feel comfortable like a lot of\ntimes if\nif there's like a large discussion going\non in a room i'll just stay completely\nsilent\nbecause i\ni'm afraid of well there's a few things\nthat i'm afraid of\none like i don't want to like embarrass\nmyself and say something that like\ni don't know anything about um but two\nit's another thing of like with my adhd\nlike it's\nso hard for me to follow along\nespecially in group settings\nand so i just like hang back and i just\nam sort of like a fly on the wall\num i forget your original question yep\nno i think it was so that's also\nincredibly insightful right so i i don't\nthink that that was as anything with\nadhd\ni think i asked you a question and your\nmind went to a place where you were like\noh\nwhen i'm in group settings i asked you\nlike why do you sometimes feel stupid\nand then you started talking about group\nsettings\nand then you also talked about how\nyou've essentially adapted\nto survive in group settings yeah does\nthat make sense like that's how i\ninterpreted what you said\nbut then the question still remains in a\ngroup setting do you feel stupid\num a lot of times i do yeah because\ni i feel like i don't have anything to\ncontribute\nmost of the time uh because i'm afraid\nand like anxious of\nsaying something that i don't know uh\nabout or you know not following along\ncorrectly whatever so\nlet's be a little bit precise here okay\nso you're saying that you feel\nafraid or anxious because you don't have\nsomething to contribute\nyeah okay so i'm gonna toss a hypothesis\nto you that it's the other way around\nokay it is your fear and anxiety and\ninsecurity\nthat causes you to conclude that you\ndon't have anything to contribute\nwhat do you think about that that makes\na lot of sense\nit's interesting right because we say\nlike oh i have nothing worth saying\ntherefore i am afraid or anxious or i\nshouldn't speak up but it's actually the\nother way around it's really tricky\nsubtle yeah because our mind always\nmakes us think that it's logical\nbut i actually think the root of that is\nyour insecurity i guess that you have a\nlot to contribute\ni don't think that you randomly become\nstupid in groups of people\nnow there may be like a certain amount\nof adhd where you're not able to attend\nto what everyone is saying like that's\ntotally fine\num but i i think that you probably have\na lot to contribute but it's that your\ninsecurity becomes\nactive in that situation what do you\nthink about that\nyeah that that makes a lot of sense and\nthat\nthat's something that i've sort of\nrealized in the past like\nyear or so is that um and i think\nme being on youtube has actually made it\na lot worse\nbut i've realized that i'm way more of\nan insecure person than\ni thought i was um and there's like a\nlot that i\nthat i like hold back and there's a lot\nthat i\nlike i don't uh open up to\na ton of people uh i think like\nfor me to like truly open up and talk\nabout stuff\num that i am insecure about like that's\na really hard thing for me to do\nand like a lot of times i will just hold\nback\nbecause yeah because i'm insecure about\nit\nokay ethan i'm gonna need a minute can i\nhave a minute oh yeah i just love what\nlike oh man okay i think i think i'm\nfinally getting a sense of maybe how we\ncan take this conversation today okay\ni just need a second to make sure we can\nyou know i can try to tie this together\nokay\ncool so\nokay\ni'm excited to get into it oh buddy\nit's gonna be walking a tightrope\n[Laughter]\noh yeah\nokay here's my proposal\nnow the downside is going to be that i\nmay be talking more than you so you got\nto let me know if that rubs you the\nwrong way\nokay we're going to start with your\ninsecurity we're going to start by\nunderstanding what is like\nlike so you know when we say the\ninsecurity activates in a particular\nenvironment\nit's going to start very very simple\nwith principles of not quite psychology\nthis is really more of like yoga and\nmeditation\nabout the way that the mind works so\nwhat i want to\nhypothesize to you and we'll explain\nthis in more detail is that you're like\na confident secure person generally\nspeaking okay\nbut that in some circumstances your mind\nactivates insecurity.exe\nand then like you become like this\nperson that you used to be\nand like you know even though you're\nsuccessful and people like you have\nthese like\nyou know really risky broad creative\npursuits like i've\nyou are the first content creator i've\never ever heard of\nthat intentionally deletes a year of\ntheir life\nand what they put in it is so incredibly\nwild and courageous\nit's so authentic and it's so ballsy\nright that's like look at the\nscrotum on that guy so we know that\nthere's this huge like we know that\nthere's this you who's like grown a lot\nthe problem is that like you have this\nthing that you carry with you\nthis insecurity that like is always at\nthe back of your mind you're stupid and\nsometimes it becomes more active\nand when it becomes active it shapes\nyour thoughts it says oh like i\nshouldn't speak up here\nso we're going to start by sort of\nexplaining how that works in the mind\nthe second thing that we're going to do\nis segue that into youtube and imposter\nsyndrome\nso once we understand what that\ninsecurity thing is\nwe're gonna take a look at sort of like\nscience and social media and things like\nthat\nand see what youtube and social media\ndoes to this basic psychology you have\nand how that results in imposter\nsyndrome\nthen we're going to talk a little bit\nabout how opening up is difficult\nand the crux here and i'm you know i'm\nreally building a house of cards that\ncould come\ntumbling down okay so bear with me so\nthis is where like we're going to talk a\nlittle bit about like the more that\nthat essentially youtube inflates\nboth your success and your insecurity\nbecause they both rise together which i\nknow is weird\nbut that's really what we see that makes\nopening up difficult\nbecause like as you start to become a\nyoutuber\nand you start to see that there's two\nethans right there's the ethan who's\nlike a badass who's been\nyoutubing for nine years and is\nconfident and knows that they're they're\nworth their weight in gold and then\nthere's like this other ethan that's\nlike well what if everyone just thinks\ni'm an idiot and if i open my mouth\nthey're gonna think i'm stupid and it's\nall gonna come crumbling down\nyeah and and it's that it's that\ndichotomy which makes it hard for you to\nopen up because like what if they see\nthe other one\nwhat if it actually is that ethan like\nthen what\nand so then what happens is you start to\nlike be inauthentic you start to hide\nyourself\nyou start to you know like you're doing\nthe\nlike when you were a little kid and you\nwanted to be loud and you wanted people\nto like see who you are i don't think\nthat's like\nquite you know attention is one thing i\nthink you have another way to think\nabout is i think you genuinely have\nsomething that you want to share with\nthe world\nand so the more you it makes opening up\ndifficult\nthe more you're closing yourself off\nwith like what you show to the world\nand this is where we get to the personal\ngrowth part which is like we sort of end\nthe journey with sort of understanding\nthat like\nif you want to grow as a person and if\nyou want the courage to take those\ncreative pursuits\nyou have to show people the ugly side of\nyou you have to show\nbe willing to show everything that you\nhave to like the world\nand if you can do that then i think\nyou're going to find co like you're\ngoing to start creating more content\nthat's creatively fulfilling\nyeah how does that sound this sounds\nlike a\na great plan okay all right so let's\nstart with the insecurity okay\nso let's start by understanding this\nkind of thing so\nwe're going to start with the insecurity\nso\nwhen you feel so does it kind of make\nsense\nthat the insecurity is like a program\nthat activates in your mind and kind of\ntakes over your thought process\nyeah so can you give me an example of\nlike what\nsituation like can you give us like\nshare a specific\nexample of like when you felt like you\nknow stupid.exe was activating\nthere's so many examples\num yeah i mean\nlike\ni like any conversation honestly\num there's so many times where\nwhere it happens um you know if somebody\nis uh\ni don't know basically if somebody's\ntalking about anything other than\nlike youtube stuff or\num like cameras or gymnastics\ni used to be a gymnast anything other\nthan that\ni it's pretty much like out of my\nwheelhouse from being\nif i'm being honest and so there's a lot\nof times where i feel like\ni i can't weigh in on stuff and to give\nyou\nsome history like i was\nuh i was a gymnast from when i was eight\nuntil 17.\ni worked out five days a week three and\na half to four hours a day\num and then when i was 15 i started\nyoutube\num and so splitting my my time between\nyoutube\nschool and gymnastics and i\ndidn't really have any social life at\nall um and then\ni got really shitty grades and my mom\nwas like you have to stop gymnastics or\nschool\nor sorry gymnastics or youtube um and so\ni chose to continue youtube\nand so can you tell me about that\nconversation\nyeah um it was\nmy sophomore year\ni think um yeah end of sophomore year\nmy mom found out that i got\ntwo d's on my finals i got like\ni got like a b multiple c's and two d's\non my finals um and she like freaked out\nabout it\num because basically all i cared about\nwas youtube and\nand gymnastics i didn't care about\nschool which\nlooking back like why should i have\ncared about school because\nit wasn't it was an environment that\nmade me feel uncomfortable\nin so many different ways um and so she\nshe got really upset about it and she\nwas like okay\nyou have to take school more seriously\nyou can't be doing all this stuff you're\njuggling way too much\nyou have to pick two of these one of\nthem has to be school\num and how did you feel\nthat was the first time i ever had a\npanic attack um\ni like completely broke down\nlike i was like like\nit was really really bad like i was like\nscreaming like\nscreaming crying uh because i just\ndidn't know how to handle that because\nthat\nuh i think it was a couple things one\nbecause i loved both of these things\nso much but in the back of my mind i\nknew that i was\nabout to choose youtube and gymnastics\nwas\nlike this huge thing like it\nreally shaped who i am as a person\nand knowing that i was about to give\nthat up just like completely\nlike shattered me\nokay\nso what what was so devastating about\nbecause i'm going to use the word\nsentence yes it sounds like sentencing\nto me\nyeah like i'm envisioning you like\nalmost\nbeing like in a courtroom where there's\nlike your mom with a gavel and she's\nlike\nyeah that's kind of what it was like\nwhich child will you execute yeah\nwhat was that what was what\ncaused the panic attack for lack of a\nbetter term i know it's kind of a weird\nquestion because\ni i think that you just phrased it\nreally well it was like i'm\nkilling one of i'm killing myself off\nlike this version of myself\nand i have to choose which person to put\nthe\nto point the gun at and like that\nthat was something especially at that\nage too\nlike i just didn't know how to\nhow to handle that um\nand i like looking back i\ni solved that problem um\nreally well i think i was like okay well\nlet's look at my future like\nif you're going to be like a career\ngymnast like\nyour career kind of stops when you're\nlike 25\n26 because your body can't handle it\nanymore so really like\nwhere can you go from there after that\nlike maybe you get some sponsorships but\nthen you kind of like become a coach and\nthat's kind of it\nand then i was like but with this other\nthing like maybe i could go more into\nfilm\nand like blah blah so i was like okay\nthis one's better for my future\nokay beautifully set okay so this is\nwhat oh crap\nso i would love ethan boy man this is\none of those interviews where i really\nwish we had like\nfive hours because there's so much to\ndig into here\nbecause i think there's there's more to\nit so i'm gonna just like jump to the\npunch line here and the punch line is a\nhypothesis because we don't really know\nbut\ni think there's another element right\nit's not just which\nwhere do you point the gun it's also\nlike\nwhat you are like who is your mom\nso so what i i want you to think about\nfor a second\nis what is your mom\nso your mom is asking you to point the\ngun\nbut she's also asking you to not only\nkill off a part of yourself\nwhat is she asking you to become\nyeah so she wants me to become a good\nstudent\nis at the end of the day that's what she\nwants you to become\nso she's asking you to become a student\nwhat is she\nsentencing you to\ni mean\nshe's\nshe's basically asking me to like choose\nthe version of myself\nto pick the version of myself that i\nwant to be i guess\nand then nope she's not\nshe's not no she's asking you to make\nthe choice that you don't want to be\nshe sent it because are you going to be\na good student\nno i still was not a good student after\nthat right and i think you understood\nthat\nand so it's not just like getting rid of\ngymnastics or youtube it's like\nforcing you to like here's like so\nthere's two ethan's right there's the\nethan who can be proud of what they\naccomplish\nthere's like the youtube ethan and the\ngymnast ethan\nand i like those are those are good\nethans\nyeah tell me about ethan the student\ni mean i just didn't care\nat all so there was\nthere was a few reasons why i didn't\ncare so number one reason was because\nyoutube and gymnastics was just\neverything\num that's where my passion was i wasn't\npassionate about anything in school like\ni wasn't learning anything that i was\ninterested in\num and then the the environment that i\nwas in\nwas i went to like the best\npublic school in the area or whatever\nand so they\nthey were really proud of the people\nthat went to their school and it was\nalways\nlike oh like all 99.9\nof our students going to college and\nlike blah blah blah and like\nbeing in that environment and knowing\nthat so many people\naround me were these like grade a\nstudents\nand like we're going on to these big\nuniversities\nand then and again me being like\nwell [ __ ] like i feel stupid all the\ntime and i'm getting bad grades and i'm\nlike i i didn't feel like and i i think\nthat this is true for a lot of kids\nlike i didn't feel like i was a part of\nthe school in a lot of ways because\ni i didn't do anything at school like i\nwasn't a part of any clubs i didn't do\nany sports through the school\ni went to school when i had to\ni left immediately i didn't hang out\nwith anybody\nbecause i didn't have time because i was\ntoo busy doing\nyoutube and gymnastics um which\nalso looking back is like i was a really\nreally\npassionate and dedicated kid to what i\ncared about\num and i think that in the environment\nthat i was in like that was kind of hard\nto find\nactually um and i remember\none of the proudest moments i think\nwas a couple years after i\ni graduated and i was doing youtube and\ni was working full-time\nas a manager at a restaurant and i was\nmaking two videos every day\nand my dad told me that he's never met\nsomebody that works as hard as i do\nand like that that like\nthat made me just like explode\num what does that mean just like\nhearing that hearing that\none at all after i just kind of felt\nlike i was a [ __ ] up for a really long\ntime\nbecause i wasn't traditionally\ndoing well because i got shitty grades\nand i didn't participate in school\nand hearing somebody be like seeing\nsomebody\nrecognize how hard i worked um\nand especially that being my dad was\njust like really\nreally huge and my dad and i have a\nreally great relationship and\nhe's someone that i really really really\nlook up to and so hearing that come from\nhim\njust it was really really big for me\nbig in what way\njust really validating that like\nthe the time that i had spent working as\nhard as i did because i\nat the time i was working full time at\nthe restaurant so 40 plus hours a week\ni was waking up at like 4 30 or 5\na.m every day to record videos before\nwork\nand then i would get back it was very\nunhealthy at the time but i would get\nback from work\nuh and then be editing until like\nmidnight or one\nand i would do that like almost every\nday for a really long time\nand so just having somebody validate\nthat and say like hey i recognize how\nhard you're working but\nalso on top of that like you are one of\nthe hardest working people\nthat i know and it was also i don't\nremember if he actually did say it but i\nmean\nit kind of goes along with what he said\nanyway it was just like\nhaving somebody say i'm proud of you was\njust like really\nreally big for me and i don't know\num i think everybody loves that having\nsomebody validate\nyou know what they're doing and have\nhaving somebody say hey i'm proud of you\ndon't uh ethan don't do the mistake of\nyou know\ni didn't like it when you compared\nyourself to everyone there i think don't\ndon't cheapen your experience and how\nsignificant it was for you by just\nsaying\nyou know everyone likes to be told\nthey're proud like i don't think that's\nwhat happened there you didn't just get\ntold you were proud\nso here's here's how i i'd understand\nyour situation\nso like your mom like was tell like like\nso there's two ethans right there's the\nethan who's like passionate\nand like good at stuff and then there's\nthe ethernet ethan who's like sort of a\nfailure\nand you say that you didn't care about\nschool and that's why you did bad\nthat's another thing where i would\nencourage you to see if it's the other\nway around\nbecause it's really hard to be a kid who\nfeels like you're stupid\nwho's surrounded by and you're giving us\na lot here right so like let's just\nthink about\ni'm just gonna tell you what i heard\nlike you're a kid who knows like you\ndon't know you've got adhd but like\nyou just know that this is the best\npublic school and that people are going\nto go off to college and they get all\na's and then there's you\nand what's wrong with you ethan why\ncan't you get good grades\nbecause you're stupid you're a stupid\nkid\nand that's and so like it's hard to be\ninvested in something that you don't\nbelieve that you can do\nyeah i don't think that the care like i\ndon't think you did bad because you\ndidn't care i think you probably when\nyou were five and six and seven\nyou tried really really hard and your\nmind did not comply\nyeah and so to pre like it's it's one\nthing to\nlike so it's almost protective to stop\ncaring because if you did care about\nschool\nwhat would that mean for you\ni think that that if i did care like\nthat probably would have [ __ ] me up\nway more absolutely\nright so not caring is not the reason\nyou didn't do good at school\nnot caring is the adaptation for not\ndoing good at school\nand then here is your mom and she's\nsaying here's the gun you pick\nwhich one goes but it's more than that\nbecause it's not that you're just\ngetting rid of one it's that she's\nforcing you to be stupid ethan she's\nlike here's this kid\nthat is like bright and talented and is\na good gymnast and is doing well on\nyoutube\nand is passionate about this stuff and\nshe's like i'm gonna take one of those\naway\nand i'm gonna force you to be crappy\nethan 50 of the time\nand now we get to the story with your\ndad because it's not just like oh like\neveryone enjoys being validated oh yeah\nmy dad tells me i'm proud makes me feel\ngood\nlike i completely agree like you know\neveryone feels good but i think it's\nactually like it's so much like it\nbrings me to tears man like\nyou know like that kid is like you know\nthey're struggling hard right like it's\nit hasn't been easy for you\nand to have like your dad recognize that\nlike you're not dumb like it's just\nyou're like working so hard it's like\nimmense\nit becomes incredibly powerful it's not\njust being told sorry i'm getting myself\ni'm just thinking about it i was gonna\nbe the one crying\ni told you i was gonna talk a lot today\nso i'm gonna do the crying too\num but i i think i think it's like it\nfeels really significant to me because\nit's this moment where you were seen\nright it's this moment where you were\nlike appreciated and this is going to\nall tie back in the imposter syndrome\nand like what i was saying at the\nbeginning about not beginning but\nearlier where like\ni think what you need to do to create is\nto like let people see you\nyou know like you need to give people\nthe chance to like do what your dad like\nyou need to put yourself out there right\nand let people see you\num and then in terms of imposter\nsyndrome there's also something very\nclear about you know being in this\nstraight a school or whatever and being\nthe one kid with d's and whatnot so like\nmaybe you felt like an imposter's in\nthere\ni think there are a couple of themes\nwhich we can touch on and does that make\nsense\nyeah yeah that makes a lot of sense\num\nyeah okay i'm just thinking about it\nyeah why don't you just take a second\nand then let me know when we're ready to\nmove on or if you have questions or want\nto try to recap\ni it's it's very interesting\nthinking about it in the in the way that\nyou presented it\nof like my mom forcing me to\nto kill off a version of myself and like\ni also recognized that it was like\nmy mom having to make a really hard\ndecision too\nsure because like because i it was bad\nfor me like to be juggling all of\nall of that stuff and like i looking\nback\ni don't think like my mom was the bad\nguy or anything like that but\nbut it was it really was her being like\nall right\nlike i almost in a way wish\nshe would have just said okay no no more\ngymnastics or\nno more youtube because i feel like\nnot having a choice in that\ncircumstance like\nme having having the weight of the\ndecision not be on me\ni think would have been so much easier\nand like i\nand again i think that's why i freaked\nout was like\ni have to make this choice\nyeah absolutely right so when you talk\nabout a panic attack i think it like\nit's not\nsurprising because i think that like in\nthat moment your mind\nunderstood like what future\nlike there's a door the door to your\nbright future is being closed and you're\nbeing like\nput on this path of like academia\nand like failure and like it makes\nperfect sense that you had a panic\nattack\nand i also want to say like as a\ndisclaimer here so sometimes when we\ntalk about parents\nwe make it seem like they're evil i\ndon't think your mom was evil or bad by\nany means\ni think like parents do what they think\nis best for their kids\nand sometimes it's inevitable but like\nwe're gonna psychologically traumatize\nour children no matter how much we love\nthem and that's just the nature of life\nit's the nature of our mind seriously\ni'm not kidding yeah\nyeah you know and and so the parents did\nthe best that they could and they also\ni'm sure that your mom\ndid a lot of wonderful stuff for you too\nand yeah so you know i just want to be\nclear that i don't think she was a bad\nperson or anything it's just like\nyou know her kid is doing too much and\nthey're failing out of school and like\nno one know like you know you being a\nyoutuber wasn't a thing back then\nyeah so it's not like there's actually\nyou know so your mom was just doing what\nshe thought was best\nand sometimes it's the little things\nthat can actually be like\npsychologically very difficult\nso now i'm going to\nwe're going to go to can we move on\nphase two okay\nso we talked a little bit about feelings\nso here's ethan okay\nand then so here's like there's like\nthis whole\ncomplex of gymnast oh [ __ ]\nso you have to excuse me so i i don't\nknow if you know this but i'm a\nphysician\nwhich means that i have terrible\nhandwriting\num all right okay so there's this is the\nethan right so\nand then there's school so here here you\nare at the age of sophomore year and\nthen your mom has this conversation then\nyou have this panic attack\nyeah okay so\nand then what is like what are you\nfeeling in the panic attack do you\nremember\num yeah it was the first time that i'd\never felt like overwhelming emotions\nlike\nlike that yeah i remember i i grabbed on\nto\na lamp that we had that\nhad like three three sort of prongs that\nthat went out to hold the uh the\nlampshade and i just grabbed that and i\njust\nsqueezed it as hard as i could and it\nwas\nmetal um and like that's all i could do\nwas just like squeeze the lamp while i\nwas lying on the floor um\nokay and then that's kind of all i\nremember yep\nand then you you remember like do you\nremember when you kind of reconstituted\nlike you said like you made this\ncalculated decision and you kind of\ncalmed down\nquickly was that the same day or next\nday or what\nit was the same day it was over the\ncourse of like a couple hours i think\nof like actually calming down because i\njust kind of like laid on the floor and\nlike hyperventilated for a while and i\nremember my mom\nuh my dad was at work and she called my\ndad and she was in the other room but i\ncould hear her and she was like hey i\nneed you to come home\nlike i just had this conversation with\nethan and he's freaking out and like\nit's really\nreally bad and i need you to come home\nokay and i remember\nlike by the time that my dad got home\ni was like winding down i was still\nprobably like\nhyperventilating and like sobbing a\nlittle bit but like the main part of it\nwas\nwas sort of over yeah so as you start to\nrationalize\nwhere does that emotion go\n[Music]\num\ni mean it sort of went into\num it was more like analytical in me\nbeing like\nokay here here are my options and\njust sort of like in my brain sort of\nlining everything out of like\ni was kind of doing like like the doctor\nstrange\nlike infinite universe kind of thing\nwhere i was just like all right\nhow how many circumstances can i make in\nmy\nbrain with the options that i have and\nwhat is the best\noutcome okay i'm going to choose this\noutcome um i was sort of doing that kind\nof thing\nand so i i think rationalizing it\nactually probably helped me calm\ndown a lot as soon as i started to think\nabout it that way\nsure makes perfect sense okay so i'm\ngoing to give you a quick scenario\nnormally i run through this in a little\nbit more detail but we're just going to\nget to that\nso like this is the example that i like\nto use so let's say i'm walking down the\nstreet with my five-year-old\nand she sees a dog and she tries to pet\nit\nand the dog bites her what happens to\nher\nemotionally uh\nshe's gonna be traumatized and she's\nprobably gonna cry\nyep right so she's crying and then i\nkind of calm her down a little bit\nand then i ask her if she wants ice\ncream\nright so i distract her hey do you want\nice cream\nand she's like yes definitely five\nminutes later\nshe's eating ice cream and she's happily\ntalking to me about\nprincesses make sense yeah\ncrying emotion is gone right what\nhappens the next time she sees a dog\nshe's gonna probably get afraid that\nshe's gonna get bitten again\nokay so where is that emotion coming\nfrom\nit's coming from the trauma that she had\nwith the dog\nperfect right so now i want you to\nunderstand this\nso now why is that emotion so i want you\nto think about it this way so this\nthis emotion gets stored into our\nunconscious mind\ndoes that make sense and then\nwhat causes the emotion to like cross\nover\ninto the conscious mind uh\nby seeing the thing that made her feel\nthat feeling\nvery good so let's think about\num like a triggering environment\ndoes that make sense yep\nand so like i know this sounds kind of\nweird i i keep on insisting on using\nthis example but\nif you go to let's say a hotel let's say\nyou're traveling ethan\nand you walk into the public restroom\nof the hotel and how do you know\nhow to operate a toilet that you've\nnever seen before\nbecause most toilets are the same\nexactly so where does that knowledge\nabout the toilet come from\nmy past absolutely and what causes you\nlike so\nso i know this sounds kind of weird but\nlike are you thinking about flushing the\ntoilet before you see the toilet\nno right so so like there's this very\nsimple principle of the mind\nthat it scans and this is something that\nthe intellect does or the buddhi\nit scans your environment and it kind of\nsays like okay what is the appropriate\nexperience that we need to activate to\nhelp us deal with the situation\ndoes that make sense yeah works for\ntoilets\nworks for trauma\nit's the same thing it's a very\nfundamental idea of mind\nso then the question becomes you know so\nnow you say to yourself so now we're\ngoing to kind of like reconceptualize\nthis a little bit okay so you say to\nyourself i know i'm smart\nright damn it\ncan i do this or okay looks like i just\ncan't do this okay whatever\num so you know you're smart and yet\nthere are times where you feel stupid\nso how does that work so we have\nour manus which is our emotional mind\nour ahamkara which is our ego\nand our buddhi which is our intellect\nand there are certain\nenvironments so you essentially have a\nstored emotion of stupidness\nand like it like even though it's not\nactive most of the time\nlike you know you're smart like you know\nlike logically like your intellect has\nconcluded that you're a worthwhile dude\nbut essentially you have this thing\ncalled a some scar\nwhich is essentially that balled up\nundigested and emotional energy of\nfeeling stupid\nand there are certain times in your life\nwhere your brain is scanning the\nenvironment like when you're with a\ngroup of people and it's like oh [ __ ]\nyeah this is when we're stupid because\nif i had to guess\ni'm sure we could find lots of instances\nof you sitting in a classroom with lots\nof people talking about stuff that you\nmay not know what they're talking about\nand the teacher calls on you and you\nfeel really really dumb\nyeah and like when you feel really\nreally dumb\nlike where does that feeling go\nhow long do you feel dumb for when\nyou're in that classroom\nuh i mean that\ni think that that feeling was just kind\nof always there\nlike the the dread of being called on\nbecause i was like nine times out of ten\ni'm not gonna know what we're talking\nabout and\ni'm i'm not going to be able to\ncontribute so it just kind of was\nconstantly there let me ask you\nethan when you are in a group of people\nwho are talking about something does\nyour mind tell you\ni don't really know what we're talking\nabout i'm not going to be able to\ncontribute\num yeah it kind of does a lot of so like\nit's weird right it's like the same damn\nthoughts that you used to have\nin the classroom you now have in groups\nof people\nis that why i still have nightmares\nabout uh\nhigh school so yes yes\nyes absolutely so nightmares\nso so now we get to okay great great\npoint because we have\nthis is a deviation that we haven't\ntalked about so this is what i want you\nto understand okay\nso in our emotional mind you have this\nexperience of sadness\nfeeling stupid actually let's call it\nfeeling stupid not sadness okay\nand then what happens is that like your\nmind distracts yourself in some way\nor you use rationalization and then\nthis thing goes dormant okay let's say\nthis is the line of your\nconscious mind okay and it gets\nstored as this thing called a sumscar\nwhich is like this ball of\nundigested emotional energy which then\ngets recalled\nat particular times you with me so far\nyeah okay and so now the question is\nlike then how do we ever get rid of this\nright because like like it's kind of\ninteresting so this is where\nyou know now if you were to if you were\nto be in an experience where you felt\nstupid\nwhat would you do with like what would\nyou do\ni know it sounds kind of weird but we've\ntalked about when you were 15 and when\nyou were like\neight but like now if something bad\nhappens to you like what's something bad\nthat's happened to you recently\ncan you do you mind sharing anything it\ncan be anything\nuh anything\nbad it could be even a tiny thing like\nany negative emotion that you've had\nrecently\nuh i mean does being sick count\nnot really um\ni'm tr i'm trying to think of of any\nand yeah i know i'm kind of putting you\non the spot no it's totally fine\ni just fell apart but oh uh i was\ni was moving out of my my old apartment\nand uh because i just moved kind of\nrecently\nand i still had a bunch of [ __ ] there\nthat i had to deal with\nand it was just super super stressful\nfor me to have to like\ngo back there and deal with stuff that\nwas still there\nand and what did you do with those\nemotions i know it sounds like kind of a\nweird question because we don't even\nrealize what we do with the emotions but\nlike\num i\ni tend to just kind of like\non to them and not not like i'm going to\nbe upset\nall day but i just kind of like it's\nalmost\nlike i'm absorbing them and just like\nyeah okay that's okay so we're gonna\nhave to teach you a different\nway yeah okay so so here's here's what\ntends to happen as we get older so if we\nlook at like\nthe psychiatry and psychology right most\nof the time like the money's in\nchildhood\nand the reason for that is because as we\ngrow older our ability\nto process emotions improves like if i'm\nwalking down the street and i get bit by\na dog like what kind of thoughts do you\nlike what's my initial reaction\nuh i mean at least for me if i get bit\nby\ni'm probably just gonna get like upset\nand like angry\nyep and then what are you rather than\nrather than cry\nsure and then what happens is\nwalk away i guess sure right so like\nlike you kind of walk away and\nokay maybe this is what we need to work\non a little bit so like this is also\nwhere like you know most adults will do\nsome amount of processing right like so\nin the same way so we can talk about\nthis in terms of stupidity actually we\nhave a good example of this\nwhere you sort of rationally look at\nyour situation\nand you kind of say like oh actually i'm\nnot stupid i just feel stupid right now\nbut like i actually have a lot that i'm\nyou know i contribute to people et\ncetera et cetera does that sort of make\nsense\nso there's this process of like actually\ndigesting or metabolizing emotions so\nthis is what psychotherapy is\nso when you go and you talk to a\ncounselor and you like talk about your\nfeelings it's kind of weird like\nhow does that help people like what is\nthe mechanism through which\ntalking about the bad stuff in your life\nactually like\nhelps you in any way shape or form\nbecause a lot of times people will\nthink about the bad things in their life\nit doesn't help them at all it just\nmakes them feel worse\nso there's actually this process of\nmetabolizing and digesting your negative\nemotions\nand the more that you do that the more\num you're kind of free of those some\nscars\nso if i get bit by a dog and i kind of\nlike process it\nthen like i'm not i'm not going to get\ntriggered by the dog anymore\nand i'm sure if we like tunnel down\nenough i can ask you enough open-ended\nquestions that you know it's hard to\nlead you in the right direction but i'm\nsure if you look in your life\nyou'll see that there are times where\nyou felt emotionally bad and you like\ndid the work of talking it through with\na friend or you like went for a long\nhike\nor like you did something right you\ndidn't just shove it aside you didn't\nstick it under the rug\nbut you actually spent some time\ngrieving so grieving is another good\nexample of this emotional processing\nthing\nwhere like some people don't grieve and\nthen they stay stuck\ndoes that make sense because that ball\nof emotional energy that some scar is\njust living down there\nand grieving is how we like get over it\npsychotherapy is how we get over it\nokay so\nlet me just think about where i wanted\nto go with this any questions about this\ndoes this make sense\nyeah no it makes a lot of sense and it's\nmaking me think about like how\ni because specifically for anger\nwhen i get angry i've learned how to\ndeal with that and i don't i\nrarely ever get angry but like when i\nget really\nmad or frustrated now i'll go and work\nout or i'll go running\nbecause it's just like a way for me to\nget a lot of energy out really quick\nand that's sort of how i process that\nbut\ni don't have that for any other emotion\nyep that's very\nvery well said so the other thing\nbeautiful ethan so good okay\nso a couple of important principles your\nbody and your mind are connected\nright so there's like there's like a\npseudoscientific\npractice called tapping or the emotional\nfreeing technique\nwhich now actually has a little bit of\ndata behind it\nwhich is like a technique that people\nuse for trauma which actually now has\nclinical trials that show it's like\nit actually does something so the idea\nis that like it's kind of weird because\nit sounds pseudo\nsuper pseudo scientific and what people\ndo is like there are these people who\nare tappers\nand what they literally do is they just\nlike tap on parts of your body to like\nfree the pent-up emotions kind of like\nacupuncture or something\nsort of i think acupuncture uses a\ndifferent a whole different modality but\nyeah\nyeah so and the point here though is\nthat like\nphysical and we know that for example\nthe diagnostic criteria for\nfor anxiety includes muscle tension so\nthere's clearly a connection between\nyour body and your mind and you can\nactually process emotions physically if\nyou want to\nthat's a completely valid doesn't have\nto be psychotherapy you can actually go\nand like\nhike and climb mountains and that will\nhelp you like process your emotions\nthe other interesting way that the mind\nprocesses emotions which is i think what\nyour mind has learned how to do\nis dreams and nightmares so every time\nyou have a nightmare about that\ni know it's unfortunate but like my hope\nis that you're digesting a little bit\nand there are actually particular\ntechniques that we can do\ni i can walk you through those maybe\nthat's not gonna be our meditation for\nthe day at the end of the day\nabout how to like think about nightmares\nand how to like work with them a little\nbit so that like you sort of\nuse that nightmare to like do the\nemotional processing and let it go\nbecause your body and your mind are\ngonna do whatever they can to heal like\nif you get a cut\nit's just gonna try to heal and your\nmind does the same thing it does the\nbest that it can\nso it'll and and so if you have\nnightmares about how often you have\nnightmares by the way\num i mean i don't have nightmares all\nthat often\num the like school ones the like stress\nstream kind of things\ni'll have like\nmaybe once every few weeks or once a\nmonth maybe\nyeah so i think that's just like\nyour your brain is like you still have\nthat pent up emotion i know it\nsounds kind of weird but in the\nnightmare so our\nwhen you're in the nightmare is the\nnightmare real\nno uh or like is it\nis like what's happening something that\nactually happened\nis that where you're asking is your\nexperience of it real\nuh i mean yeah because i'll wake up and\nfeel stressed yep so like like and even\nthen like the emotions that you feel in\na nightmare are they real\nyeah it's bizarre right yeah but\nabsolutely\nso i think like this is your and if we\nthink about like this emotional\ncatharsis and when people like\nlike come into my office and they start\ncrying like what we're doing is bringing\nthose emotions\nback into the conscious mind so that we\ncan experience them process them and let\nthem go\nand so i think that your mind has just\nlearned how to do this through a\nnightmare because you don't know how to\ndo it\nother ways or maybe you have i don't\nknow if you see a therapist or not but\nlike\nyou know that's another way i would\nsuspect that if you start going to\ntherapy\ni'm assuming that you don't already know\nbut that if you start i just\ni just stopped going to therapy actually\ni just like took a break\nbecause doing stuff over\nzoom every week like i couldn't like get\ninto the right like\nmindset every week and so until i can go\nback in person we\nwe took a little bit of a break but i\njust stopped going like a few weeks ago\ngood good i i think taking a break from\ntherapy is like important too like it\nshould be part of your vacation\num but anyway so hopefully you can kind\nof work on some of those things\nthere but i think it sort of makes sense\nto me that you have nightmares about the\nsort\nthis kind of stuff yeah so the\njust to kind of summarize so ethan do\nyou mind just sharing with me like what\nyou've taken away from the conversation\nso far like key points\nthat yeah uh i mean the\nthe sort of realization of like having\nto like\nkill a version of me off i think\nhas like affected me a lot more than i\ninitially thought and like\nand i think i get this from my dad but\nlike i very much\ndon't process my emotions like something\nwill happen to me and i'll just kind of\nbrush it off\num and i also just like\nwill kind of roll over for people too\nwhat does that mean\nwell just like i don't know uh\ni don't i don't like stand up for myself\nall that much\num and also i don't know how to say no\nto anybody\num which is something that i've been\nsort of like working on\num and i think that's part of me my\ninsecurity\nis like i don't want this is something\ni've actually talked to my therapist a\nlot about\num is that i don't want people to think\nthat i'm an [ __ ]\nand so if somebody asked me to do\nsomething i'll just like kind of bend\nover backwards for them\nand be like oh yeah of course because i\ndon't want them to think i'm a dick\nokay i'm curious did you feel pressured\nto come on here today\nno okay would you tell me if you did\nyeah okay yes i'm very excited okay\nbecause i would hate to i would hate to\nyou know have you bend over backwards\nfor\nno you know um okay so\nso really i'm glad that so now i'm going\nto give you a choice so\nwhat i'm actually hearing ethan is that\nthe the biggest thing that was helpful\nfor you was sort of this realization\nabout your mom and sort of being you\nknow forced to\nlooking for the right word amputate a\npart of yourself\nyeah and and so now you know i i've\nsketched out this beautiful plan\nbut i'm wondering if we should actually\nabandon it and just maybe like dig for a\ncouple more of those gems like\nwhat do you think we can go down our\nstandard track of okay here's the way\nthat some scars work\nthis feeling of insecurity is\nessentially like pent-up emotions from\nthese\npast times that then activate we can now\nmove on to like youtube and think a\nlittle bit about how that entire process\nis exacerbated by social media then we\ncan talk about how\nopening up is difficult and then we can\nsort of talk about you know becoming\nyour best\nself or we can dig for gems\nwhat do you want to do uh we can do we\ncan do either of those\num your time bro i'm going to force you\nto choose\noh [ __ ] no i'm not no i can't\ni'm so sorry i'm so sorry\nokay oh god wait um\nyou don't have to choose you choose you\ndo you want to choose no not really\nokay i will choose for you okay okay\nlet's let's\nlet's stick with our original thing okay\ni'm so sorry ethan oh god it's very\nfunny\ni didn't mean to all right\nso let's talk about youtube so you say\nthat you suffer from\nimposter syndrome or maybe something\nlike that what do you mean by that\num so definitely over the past year\nbecause the\nthe channel that i was doing with a\nfriend of mine like really\nboosted my career a lot and boosted my\nown channel and everything\num and so i just sort of feel like\num just kind of standard imposter\nsyndrome of like\nthe things that i have i don't deserve\nor\num i i think a lot of um\ni think a lot about like why am i in\nthis scenario\nand like uh you know a lot of a lot of\npeople in my life\nespecially over the past year have had\nreally shitty things happen in them\nand here i am like you know on paper\nlike living the dream in los angeles\num and so it's a lot of like why am i\nthis person\nthat's experiencing this um and there's\nthere's a lot of guilt that i that i\nfeel with the\nsuccess that i have and i don't feel\nthat i deserve it basically\ndo you feel like you\ndon't deserve it from like a cosmic\nsense or do you feel like\npeople haven't figured out that you\ndon't make good content yet\n[Laughter]\noh i i think i think it's the latter\nit's in my mind like there's so many\nother people that make way better stuff\nthan i do\nlike i don't think that i'm particularly\ninteresting\nor that i\nand again this is something that i'm\nworking on with my therapist\nof like i don't feel like i'm worthy of\npeople's time\nmost of the time so i'm\nnoticing a couple of different things\nand i wouldn't call all of them imposter\nsyndrome okay\nso can i try to tease apart untangle\nthis ball of yarn so when i think about\nimposter syndrome so here's\nfor better or for worse i feel like i'm\nunderstand it quite well now\num you know we've worked with a lot of\nstreamers and and uh we have like a\nprogram with twitch where we\nsupport content creators and so\none of the things that that when i think\nabout imposter syndrome i'm going to use\nsort of this eastern kind of conception\nof it as well\nso we have an internal sense of self\nright and this is the way that you\nview yourself and we have the way that\nthe world treats us\nand so the way that i view myself is\ndifferent from the way that the world\ntreats me does that make sense\ngenerally speaking though\nactually so let's go back to your dad\nfor a second so there are times\nwhere like harmony is built when these\ntwo things\nare even so i think like the\nsignificance of like your dad talent\nlike appreciating you for who you are\nis like you knew deep down that you were\nworking really\nreally hard and you were trying and so\nyou had this view of yourself but what\ndid the world think of you\nthat i was a failure right so but like\nthe world kept on telling you were a\nfail you were a failure\ndoes waking up at 4 30 in the morning\nmaking youtube videos\ngoing to work and then coming back home\nand editing them\nif i describe that to someone like what\nadjectives would you use to describe\nthat person\nlike hard-working and dedicated and\nprobably successful passionate right\nyeah\nso there's a there's a there's a\ndisconnect between your internal\nsense and what the world is telling you\nthat can be very devastating for people\nand then here comes your dad and he's\nlike he's a signal from the outside\nworld that aligns with like\nyour passion and your dedication and so\nit can feel really good\nso in that situation your self-esteem is\nup here the world is treating you down\nhere\nand so that's kind of feels bad man\nright\nimpostor syndrome is this it's when\nyou have a sense of yourself like you're\njust like an ordinary guy like you're 24\nyear old ethan\nyou know there's some things you're good\nat some things you're not great at and\nthe world is like oh my god\nit's it's ethan he's so great like look\nat the school stuff he's doing all the\ntime man oh my god i love ethan and then\nyou're like wait a minute hold on a\nsecond\nyeah you know so what i see in imposter\nsyndrome and i see it a lot\nat places so i teach at harvard medical\nschool and like i see it a lot there\nbizarrely and you'd think that like you\nknow\nlike what's the correlation between\nsuccess and imposter syndrome\nand generally speaking the more\nsuccessful people are the more\nthat they feel imposter syndrome and and\nessentially what happens is like\ngenerally speaking our internal sense of\nself and external sense of self tend to\nlike\nstick with each other so if you think\nabout a standard person it's like oh you\nknow i'm a high school student\ni feel terrible and then you like become\na freshman in college\nthen once you're a freshman in college\nyou feel like a like you know a nobody\nlike you're a freshman you're a noob\nand then you go back home for christmas\nand then you hang out with people who\nare one or two years younger than you\nyeah and then like then you feel like a\nbig swinging dick\nyou know yeah it's like look at all\nthese high school plebs and like i'm in\ncollege now [ __ ]\nand so there's kind of this weird like\nthis slow\ngrowth right and then you finish high\nschool and then you go back and like you\nlike\nlike do a career panel for like high\nschools i mean\nsorry you finish college and then you\nget a job and then you're like 24 and\nyou go back and you like\ndo some career panel at the guidance\noffice or whatever\nand they're all these 21 year olds and\nlike you're a 24 year old and you're\nlike paying your own rent\nand then you like feel like someone\nright but you're the most junior person\nat the\nthe the company so you don't feel like\nmuch there\nso generally speaking there's like an\neven sense\nof like societal respect with like an\ninternal sense of value\nbecause that's the way that we're sort\nof designed we're not designed to like\ninherit vast amounts of success over\nbrief periods of time because things\nlike social media\nlike i don't know if this makes sense\nbut you know 10 000 years ago\nyou couldn't blow up in your tribe yeah\nthere's only like so big that you could\nget\nright and so like sure like you could\nmaybe like you single-handedly killed a\ntiger and then everyone's like yay and\nthen you're like yay look at how awesome\ni am\nand like 15 people think you're great\nyeah and so our brains are just not\ndesigned like the concept of blowing up\nwas not technologically possible\nyeah in the environment like you go look\nat a tribe of like a pack of deer\nright like how how much can their social\nstatus change\nyeah very little right and so like\nenter youtube where suddenly now we have\nthese things where like people get\nelevated a lot so if you heard of a\ncompany called goldman sachs\nyou know yeah okay so like i also work\nwith a fair number of people at goldman\nand like goldman is sort of like it's\nlike a platinum tier investment bank\nit's where everyone wants to go they're\nlike super famous super rich whatever\nand so we see a ton of imposter syndrome\nbefore like when i'm working with a 22\nyear old who's applying to be in goldman\nhe's like at the top of his class he's\nthe most competitive\nhe feels really good about himself and\nthen when he lands at goldman within six\nmonths he's got impostor syndrome\nbecause then when he introduces himself\nto people and he's like oh i work at\ngoldman\nand then i was like oh yeah and then\nhe's like but wait a minute because he's\nlike the most junior kid on the totem\npole so every day when he goes to work\nhe feels like clueless\nand here he is getting all this external\nrespect yeah\nso bizarrely what what i see in imposter\nsyndrome is like when there's\nwhen there's a quick elevation the\nimposter syndrome gets worse because\nthen you're kind of confused because\neveryone's treating you like you're the\nbest thing since sliced bread\nbut like i know this sounds kind of\nweird but like you still [ __ ] the same\nevery morning\nyeah right and you're like wait a minute\nyeah you know does that make sense\nyeah it makes a lot of sense and and so\nthat's i definitely see that and i think\nthat like basically is if you do like\nself-reflective work and stuff like that\nwe can talk about spirituality and stuff\nthat's one thing but i'm also detecting\nsomething else which i don't think is\nimposter syndrome which is sort of the\nsense of worthiness\nwhat's fair do i deserve this and i\ndon't really get the sense that\ni feel like that's a little bit more\nalmost like spiritual in nature what do\nyou think\nyeah i'm so i\ni why is that different from imposter\nsyndrome\nof like because you sort of described it\nas like\nuh other people saying like oh you're\nhot [ __ ] and really you're just\na normal dude um but how is that sort of\ndifferent from\nfeeling like oh like i have\nthis stuff and i don't feel worthy like\nwhy me\nyeah so so the reason i'd say that\nthat's different is one has to do with a\ncomparison\nit may not be different right so it may\nbe the same so i'm kind of proposing to\nyou but\nwhat i'm like especially when you talked\nabout like other like so if you ask why\nam i successful\nand other people are not that doesn't\nhave to come with imposter syndrome\nthat i think is a really really\nimportant question from like a spiritual\nand karmic perspective\nlike why do you have the life that you\nhave\nand imposter syndrome is about sort of\nlike being afraid that one day\neveryone's gonna wake up and like start\nto think that like\nyou make crappy content they know\nthey've figured it out\nright so so the being afraid of them\nfiguring it out is\ndifferent from like understanding like\nethan why were you given the gifts that\nyou were given\nyou know you say your adhd and you have\nstruggles and things like that\ntotally get it but like i think you've\ndiscovered that you\nare brilliant right i think\nthat is not a word that i would use to\ndescribe myself\nbut i'm also very very bad at uh\ngiving myself any credit at all or\nsaying anything nice about myself\nyeah so i think that that feeling of\nunworthiness\ncan grow into imposter syndrome but i\nthink that has deeper roots dude\nbecause i think you were taught you were\nunworthy\nfrom a very young age what do you think\nabout that\nyeah no i i definitely feel\nfeel that and it's it's so interesting\nbecause i\ni don't feel that at all from my family\nbecause my family has always been\nuh they've always supported like\neverything that i've\nthat i've ever done and like both my\nparents when\nwhen i moved out to la they were like\nyou have to go and do this like you need\nto go and make this leap\nyou can always come back blah blah blah\nbut like from kind of everybody else in\nthe outside\nworld i've always felt like\noh i'm doing bad and i'm stupid\nthere it is so there's the sump scar\nit's the persistent feeling you carry\nwith you\nright so i i think that impostor\nsyndrome can grow on this but this feels\ndeeper to me than\nbecause like there are a lot of people\nwho blow up and have impostor syndrome\nbut are like narcissistic pricks who\ndon't bend over backwards for anyone\nright so i think your particular\ncombination is like an insecurity that\npre-dates the youtube\nfollowed by an explosion of social media\nwhere like\nyou know now suddenly everyone's\ntreating you well and it's like doubly\nperplexing\nbecause there's the normal dose of\nimposter syndrome and that compounds\nwith like the sense of like\nam i really good at what i do am i\nreally worthy\nso now the question becomes where does\nthat\nyou know i'm curious what what do you\nthink about the content you make\ni think it's fine honestly\nlike i i i think that it's\nentertaining for people but it's nothing\nit's nothing great um i think that i\nhave made really cool stuff\nbut um yeah no i\ni do think that i just am another dude\non youtube\nlike making videos and\ni i think that i'm doing things that\nanybody can do and that i'm i'm nothing\nspecial\nand then i just got lucky and i was at\nthe right place at the right time\ni could get behind that\nso so i know this sounds kind of weird\nethan but i think that that's\nokay what do you think yeah yeah no and\nlike i\ni think that that's very real\nwhere it's just like i do genuinely\nthink that like\nanybody can do what i do it's not like i\ndo anything profound\nand like i like i i make\ndecent content and i got really lucky\nand like i worked really hard and that\nthat worked out somehow\ndo you feel\nunworthy\num yes and no it depends\nit kind of depends on the mood that i'm\nin um because there are parts of me that\nsort of like with the stupidity thing\nwhere i can recognize\nlike i i busted my ass for years and\nyears and years to like get where i am\num but then there's there's other parts\nof me that\nthat are like i know people that work so\nmuch harder than me and\nare are you know better people than i\nam and you know why don't\nwhy aren't they where i'm where i'm at\nwhy was i the person that\ngot got handed this i don't feel like i\ndeserve it\nokay\nso i don't know why ethan but i'm just\nkind of in a teaching mode today\nand maybe it's because you're working\nwith a therapist but you seem very\ninsightful to me so i want to give you\nsome stuff to kind of think about\nas opposed to like maybe like meet you\nwhere you're at which is normally what i\ndo\nso here's here's what i'd recommend to\nyou and this is part of the process of\nlike helping people overcome imposter\nsyndrome\nwhy do you compare\nso that's that's something that i have a\nreally hard time is\ni'm constantly comparing myself to\nothers um\nand i think it's because of like\nthe people that are in my\nfriend group and like specifically on\nyoutube like most of the people that\ni'm surrounded by are\nthese insanely successful talented\npeople\nand i constantly feel like hey\nthat i'm always overshadowed by them and\nthat i will never be able to escape that\nshadow ever\nand i'll always just be that dude that's\nfriends with x um\nand also uh\nwhere what was the other point that i\nwas gonna make\ni'll ask the question again why do you\nalways compare\num oh yeah that's the other thing is\nthat people always compare me to them\nall the time it's like okay ethan did\nthis this person did that\num or like i wish these people would do\nthese things together or whatever\nand it's always people comparing me to\nmy friends um and so i always feel like\ni\ni always compare myself to the people\nthat i'm around because other people\ndo that to me as well\nhow does it how does it feel to be\ncompared to these other people\num there's two sides of it which are\nvery\nopposite and conflicting one\npart of it is like i'm honored to be\neven\nremotely associated with these people\nbecause these are people that i look up\nto\nand um that make\nsome really amazing stuff and that i\ngenuinely like believe\nin the content that they make and\nthey're talented people and then the\nother side of that\nis the exact opposite where like it can\nbe really degrading\nwhere anything that i do is going to be\ncompared to what these other people are\ndoing\nand it really sucks sometimes where it's\nlike okay can you just\nlook at the thing that i made without\nbringing up these other people like not\neverything that i do\nhas to be connected to these other\npeople\ncan i think for a second\nnow i'm facing the challenge of how how\nto try to condense you know weeks of\nwork into like 15 minutes\nbecause there's definitely a road\nforward i just don't know how to\ncondense it so let me just see if i can\npull this off\nethan do you have a particular if you\ndon't mind sharing do you have a\nparticular like religious or spiritual\nbend\ni'm not religious or spiritual at all\nokay\nall right let's start with this who are\nyou\nwhat a loaded question uh\ni genuinely don't even know how to\nanswer that\nyep uh\ni don't even know where to s to start\nanswering that\ndon't worry about being right yeah\njust tell me who do you who are you um\nam i allowed to just use a bunch of\nadjectives absolutely\nyou're allowed to say whatever you want\nto nothing is wrong with what you were\ngoing to say\ncool um i think that like\nat my core i'm a very like passionate\num and i i do think that i'm a very\ninsightful person\num yeah i think\ni think at my core like i'm very\npassionate and\ni think that i'm a pretty thoughtful\ndude like i i do go out of my way for\nthe people that i care about a lot\nand um yeah\nso i'm hearing compassionate insightful\nand dedicated is that fair\nyeah i think i'm pretty easy going\nsometimes too\nto a fault yep uh yeah so that's\nokay so here's here's i know it sounds\nkind of weird but like when i work with\npeople with imposter syndrome like i\nthink it ultimately comes down to\nthe ahamkada or the ego which i don't\nknow if you remember when i drew but\nthere's like emotional mind there's the\nintellectual mind and there's this thing\ncalled the ego\nand if we think so the one of the\nfunctions of ego is to compare\nso like what the ego does when we're\nfeeling bad about ourselves\nis that it compares us to other people\nsometimes it does so to reinforce the\nfact that we feel bad about ourselves\nbut otherwise it also does it to kind of\npump ourselves up\nyeah but if you kind of think about it\nlike i know this sounds kind of weird\nbut like you know i want you to look at\ntwo rocks\nand like just think about this for a\nsecond\nand like you can compare them\nyou can say one is bigger or smaller\nbut like it doesn't mean anything\ndoes that make sense yeah and so i think\nthis is\nonce again where like social media\nreinforces or conditions our mind to\ncompare\nand especially when people are making\ncomparisons so it's almost like there's\nan assault on your mind which is\nin uh increasing your aham god now the\ninteresting thing is\na hamgar is technically translated as\nthe sense of i\nso sometimes people who have a hum card\nit's not necessarily like ego like it's\nnot\nnecessarily that they're egotistical you\ncan still have a sense of\ni that has a very low impression\nlike i can beat myself up a lot i'm so\nstupid i am this i am this i am this or\nyou can be like i'm the best thing since\nslice friend\nthe yogis would actually say that it's\nthe i am part that's the problem\nwhat's on the other end of the spectrum\nis always going to lead to suffering\nwhether you say you're the best thing\nsince sliced bread and you're super\nnarcissistic those people suffer\nimmensely\nor you beat yourself up those people\nsuffer immensely as well\nand so oddly enough i think that like\nyou know you your your mind can make\ncomparisons but i think your true\nfreedom and the reason that you're going\nto continue to have imposter syndrome\nuntil you recognize who you are\nbecause and now we get to the punch line\nas long as you don't know who you\nare where does your sense of identity\ncome from\nwhat other people tell me exactly\nright so so this is where like when when\nit comes to your sense of self\nego is when the sense of the self comes\nfrom the outside\noh dr k oh harvard\nharvard oh did you see it did you see it\noh so beautiful\nright and so like\nyou know it's like as long as that's\nwhat your identity is based on like\nyou're gonna suffer\nand and so like even the people at\nharvard like they suffer a lot because\nthere's always\nyou know someone higher than them or\neven if you rise to the head of a\ndepartment and you run\na division there are other divisions\nand so like as long as your sense of\nidentity is based upon comparison like\nthe imposter syndromes to a certain\ndegree gonna be there\nand so now the question becomes how do\nyou discover who you are\nno idea okay close your eyes\nwho are you ethan what is your\nexperience\nof yourself\nthe first thing that i want to do is\njust say the things that i already said\nokay when you asked me before of who am\ni\nokay so you can say those things so now\nlet's pick insightful\nshow me where insightful is like in this\nexperience if this is the only moment\nthat you existed\nhow would i know that how how would you\nknow how would you know that you're\ninsightful\nuh by\njust the fact that i can reflect i guess\nokay\nokay good experiences that i've had and\nme as a person\nokay so that's actually a far better\nanswer than i thought was possible\nit shows that you're insightful but yeah\nso but but i'm i'm gonna say like it\ngoes it's a little bit weird because i'm\ngonna still tunnel down so\nwhat the real answer is the capacity to\nreflect\nso i want you to notice that like so are\nyou a man\ni don't know what your gender identity\nis but do you identify as a man\nhow would you know if this is all that\nexisted if if you were alive for just a\nmoment in time and it was this moment\nhow would you know that you were a man\nbecause i think that i am a man\nokay but where is the madness in you\nuh\ni don't know right it's weird\nyeah so so once again you gave the right\nanswer which is a step forward which is\nthat because you think you're a man\nare you a youtuber yes\nhow would you know uh\nbecause i make content on youtube okay\nand were you a youtuber 15 years ago\nno were you you\n15 years ago yes\nwell then how does that work then how\ncan being a youtuber be a part of you\nbecause we're constantly growing and\nchanging we you're correct we are\nconstantly growing and changing\nbut who is the you that is constantly\ngrowing and changing\nyeah right so you can\nopen your eyes let's check in how you\nfeeling right now what what are you\njust how was that for you confusing do\nyou feel i don't wanna i don't want you\nto feel stupid but i encour\ni understand that we're walking on like\nvery unfamiliar territory that's\ndifficult for most people\nyeah no i don't i don't feel stupid\nactually\num genuinely um it's\nit's really really interesting being\nasked those questions\nbecause that's not something that people\nlike\nnobody goes up to somebody and it's like\nwho are you like\ndeep down who are you and so it's really\nreally weird thinking about that and\nasking\nand i think that that's most of what\ntherapy is\nis just having somebody ask you a\nquestion that you need to ask yourself\nand asking myself that question and\ngenuinely not really having any idea how\nto answer it\nit's also kind of terrifying being like\noh i don't really know who i am at\nat my core um and so it's it's kind of\nto answer your question it's kind of\nscary yeah a little bit\ngood so that's what we want because i\nthink that's going to be your road\nforward so here i'll leave you with a\ncouple of thoughts so here's the thing\nethan\nyou are what you are and maybe now we'll\nsort of segue into like\nyou know so let's just touch on opening\nup is difficult so like\nyou have this idea of all this [ __ ] that\nyou are but you're not any of that stuff\nall the stuff that you're afraid to show\nother people\nis not actually who you are because what\nyou are and this is sort of the yogic\nperspective\nis there's a eunice that transcends body\nso like when you were a child you were\nstill you and when you're an adult\nyou're still you but the body has\nchanged\nbefore you were a youtuber you were\nstill you\nright like and after like when you were\na tiny youtuber you were still you\nand now that you're a successful\nyoutuber you're still you\nlike you're still that kid who would\nwake up at 4 30 every day to make videos\nthat's like that's a part of you there's\nlike a piece of you\nthat wants to like share something with\nthe world\nand that part of you doesn't care really\nabout anyone else it doesn't care about\nwhether you're bigger or smaller or get\ncompared or don't compare it or whatever\nright because like i think when you\nreally stop and think about\nwhen you make your best content it is\nwhen you are the furthest away from what\npeople think you are\nand it is the closest to when you are\nyou\nbecause i know this sounds kind of weird\nbut when you were working as that\nmanager and you were making you two\nyoutube videos a day\nwere you being you\nyeah absolutely\nabsolutely right you were so close to\nyourself back then\nand the crazy thing is like when your\nmom told you like pick one\nthe reason that that was so painful is\nbecause she was asking you\nyou were so close to who you were back\nthen you had figured out who you were\nand she was like\nlop a piece off and you were like\nno that's not i'm not a student it's\njust not who i\nam yeah and so i know it sounds kind of\nweird but like there's a eunice that\ntranscends\nyour physical body there's a unis that\neven transcends your mind\nbecause their fluctuations with the mind\none day you're sad one day you're angry\nbut you're still you one day you're\negotistical one day you feel unworthy\nmaybe you feel those things more\nconstantly\nbut i guess that when you're taking a\ndump\nyou don't really feel unworthy you're\njust like\nyou're just exactly exactly\nright and maybe if you're on your phone\nand you're checking twitter then you\nwill feel unworthy\nand and so you know i mean but like like\nthere's there's a eunice ethan\nand this is the thing is i i would\nencourage you to walk that journey and\nnow it's going to be tricky because i\ndon't know\nyou know therapy is a good place to\nstart but i think it's a little bit more\nspiritual in nature\nof really like go through this process\nof like when you close your eyes and you\nlike sit down like i want you to go\nexperience\ndifferent things like go and like hike\nand then like ask yourself like who's\ndoing the hiking is this a youtuber like\nwhere are they because i'm not gonna i\ndon't think you're gonna find one i\ndon't think you are a youtuber yeah\ni think a youtuber is just a mantle that\nyou put on\nright and i think that the closer that\nyou get to that identity like\nthe less that this vacuum of identity\nwill be filled up by social media\nand as you become solidified and\ngrounded in yourself\nand i know you've been this you probably\nare to a certain degree it's just\nsocial media is going to pull you away\nfrom that because in terms of identity\nit's like\nand you were taking a month off right so\nlike\ni think you got closer to you yeah\nand does that make sense yeah\nno and there there were parts of of that\nmonth where i did feel really close to\nmyself like\nuh there was just like a\nthere was just a night where i just and\nit was very cathartic and\nvery good but i just like sat and cried\nfor\nlike and it came out of nowhere but i\njust\nsobbed on my kitchen floor uh for like\n15 or 20 minutes\nout of nowhere and like it was really\ngood\nbecause i think that i don't allow\nor like subconsciously i don't allow\nmyself to\nfeel my like deep emotions all that much\nand i think that's a thing that a lot of\nyoutubers struggle with because we sort\nof like wear this mask of like okay i\nneed to make a video now i need to go on\nstream now\ntime to be happy because we need to do\nan alexathymia workshop for y'all\nbut okay yeah um that's uh\nthat's something that my therapist uh\nbrought up like a\nmonth or two ago she's like i think that\nyou have alexa thymey and i was like i\ndon't know what that is and explained it\nand i was like oh\nyeah because i uh i can only this is\nsomething that we've been working on\nis that when she asked me how i'm doing\nor how something affects me\nmost of the time my go-to thing is weird\nor fine\nand i have such a hard time explaining\nhow\nsomething actually makes me feel can you\nexplain to people what alexa thymey is\nuh from my understanding of it it's sort\nof the inability\nto uh\nthe inability to express uh\nor articulate your emotions i guess well\nsaid so i kind of think about it as\nsomeone who's colorblind to emotion\nyeah that's a good way of putting it\nright so it's like it's like\nand so we see this a lot actually in in\nmen especially because\nmen are actually conditioned to suppress\nemotions and like not recognize them\nso men are allowed to feel basically one\nemotion any guess what it is\nthere's one emotion that's socially\nacceptable for us to express\nanger absolutely absolutely right so\nlike even when we get shamed and we get\ndumped we feel pissed off yeah\nit's the only real thing that we\nunderstand like it's like you could\ntell anger but everything else is weird\nyeah and even positive emotions are like\noh it's fine\nyou don't you don't walk in and say like\ni feel like validated because people\nlove me in the world and i feel like\nloved and appreciated like you still\nlike you're just not taught how to even\nrecognize that like i feel good today\nwhy do you feel good i i don't know i\ndon't know it's fine i'm just i'm just\nsurviving\ni'm vibing today you know it's\nyeah yeah so so alexa time\nis like not knowing what you feel and\nthen the challenge is that like it's\nhard to\nyou know process like what you don't\nwhich you can't\nfeel or can't articulate\nand and then you know in medicine we\nhave a saying that good diagnosis\nprecedes good treatment and i think the\nbig problem with lexithymia is that like\nwhen we're\nwhen we don't know what we feel like we\ncan't really fix it\nbecause are you feeling sad are you\nfeeling ashamed are you feeling afraid\nyou know are you feeling guilty\nall these things are important and even\nlike solidifying like the positive\nfeelings is actually really important\ntoo\nyeah um but yeah i'm gonna have to think\nabout that\nbut anyway i'm sorry you were saying\nsomething else i kind of jumped in\nwith alex i just made a side comment\nabout i don't remember\nokay um yeah and then i think the last\nthing that i just want to toss your way\nis like\ni think ethan for someone who is as\ncontemplative as you are\nso i'd tack one more thing i think\nyou're insightful but i think you're\nalso like a thinker\ni get the sense that you know you may\nnot really view yourself this way\nbecause of the adhd\nbut like like you think i get the sense\nyou think about stuff\num and so one thing that i would really\nencourage you to also kind of do going\nforward is like think about why you\nso like you know i personally do derive\na lot of value from like\nthinking about karma um and i don't know\nwhether it's real or not real\nbut there's good scientific evidence\nthat having\nan internally consistent way that you\nview the world\nis like a good way to find like peace\nand happiness and stability and builds\nresilience\nit doesn't say that a particular way is\nsuperior to other ways so it's not like\nthe christian model is like better or\nworse than the hindu model\nbut that just or even like being like a\nsecular humanist is totally fine too\nbut there is good data that spending\nsome time thinking about it and then\ncoming to your own conclusions about\nlike\nwhat is the way that i'm viewing my life\nin existence can be helpful\nwhat do you think about exploring things\nlike the theory of karma and stuff like\nthat\nuh yeah i mean i'm always open to like\nexploring and uh and just\ngaining knowledge about stuff because\nthat's not something that i've even\never really dived into ever okay\ni think it could help you answer these\nquestions like why you\nlike why are you lucky like why have you\nseen so much success over the last year\nwhen other people are struggling\nand then i think there's another piece\nof that which is that like\nif you are lucky like what do you what\ndo you do with it\nyeah you're saying yeah like that that\nsort of struck a chord what do you\ncan you share a little bit yeah i mean\ni i feel like i struggle with that a lot\nwhere\nwhere it's like okay like i am very\nlucky to be\nwhere i am like i have influence and\nyou know i'm successful and blah blah\nblah but there's a lot of times where\ni'm like\nwhat the [ __ ] am i doing like yeah i\ndon't know\nwhere i i feel sometimes\nthat i'm that i'm not\nusing what i have in the in the correct\nway\nyep yeah good i'm i'm very happy to hear\nthat\nbecause i i think that's what makes the\nworld a better place\nwhen people have resources and have\ntalents\nand they think to themselves am i using\nthis the best way that i can i think\nlike that's\nwhere the light in the world comes from\nit's like when people like you are like\nhey maybe i can do something and you\ndon't have to be big you know i think\nit's just everyone has resources at\ntheir disposal\num but yeah ethan i\ncan i pause for a second and maybe even\nstart with a little bit of an apology\nyeah sure so here's here's what i i sort\nof got from our conversation today\nand i just want to make sure that you\nknow i feel bad if this wasn't really\nwhat you were looking for it wasn't\nhelpful but\nwhen i talk to you and when i listen to\nyou like here's what i see\nthere's a psychological component\nthere's this some scar of feeling stupid\nand whatnot\nand and you know like that was born in a\nparticular place you carry it around\nwith you it activates when you you when\nyou see the toilet flush that's when you\nthink toilet\nso when you're in a group of people like\nyou're gonna be transported\nand maybe this is a better way to put it\ni think you become\neight-year-old ethan yeah in your mind\nright and it's weird because that can\nco-exist with successful ethan\nlike here's one ethan who's like oh like\nhow do i use my resources to better\nyou like make the world a better place\nand like what do i do about like making\noh i want to help the universe\nand then there's like oh my god stay\nquiet don't open your mouth because\nyou're an idiot and you'll never\nyou know yeah you can't this is weird\nright\nso the thing about a some scar is that\nthe emotional energy retains the age at\nwhich it was formed\nso in psychology we call this regression\nbut you get like\nyour mind like boots up an old version\nof your os\nyeah and so it's really weird and it can\nbe really confusing but the first thing\nto understand is that those can\ncoexist right i can like i can i forget\nwhat it what's even called when you\nhave like linux installed on a windows\nmachine or\nuh oh yeah you got like multiple os's\nand you run one os inside the other dual\nboot\nyeah i don't remember i used to know\nthis kind of stuff but\nanyway so it's like you've got these\nmultiple os so that's the psychological\ncomponent you know if you have\ni'm going to give you a chance to ask\npractical questions so that's where we\nkind of started with\nunderstanding the nature of mind\nunderstanding what a samskara is how\nthat emotional energy gets stored it\ngets called up\ndoesn't mean you're stupid it just means\nthat there's an eight-year-old\nkid who feels stupid who is then\nmaximizing on your desktop and covering\nall of your conscious space\nyeah second thing is that you know some\nof those insecurities like unworthiness\nand stuff\ncan get exacerbated by youtube and\nsocial media and that has to do with as\nlong as you aren't grounded with\nwho you are on the inside all of that\nexternal stuff\nis going to determine who you are\nbecause the mind needs some kind of\nidentity\nand if it can't figure out who we are if\ni ask you who you are and you can't\nanswer that question\nyour mind is going to fill it up with\nwhatever you see on social media\nthat impostor syndrome is going to be an\nescalation of external value that is out\nof proportion with your internal value\nand this once again gets to why it's\nimportant to figure out who you are\nbecause as you ask as you understand who\nyou are that's going to even things out\nand then the imposter syndrome will melt\naway\nliterally i've seen it melt away with\npeople once they understand who they are\nyeah then we didn't really quite get\ninto why opening up is difficult but i\nthink like\nultimately you know you should ask this\nquestion we kind of have this kind of\nspiritual component towards the end\nwhich is like\ndiscovering who you are because you\ndidn't well know you know you just can't\nput words to it\nbut you can say like i was close to\nmyself then i sat down on the kitchen\ncore\nfor i cried and so for you to actually\nlearn the systematic process of\ndiscovering who you are\nre-accessing who you are on a daily\nbasis\nso you can kind of check in and be with\nyourself every single day\nand that the more you move towards that\nperson and the more that that person\ngrows within you\nthere's a part of you like i know i mean\ni don't know but i'm gonna predict ethan\nthat there are times where you have this\nidea and then you're gonna be like i\nwanna do this thing like this thing that\nyou were talking about\ndeleting all your videos and there's\nprobably another part of you that like\nthinks to himself like what if everyone\nthinks it's stupid\nand then you're like you know what i'm\ngonna do it anyway because i think it's\nfun\nand so there are times where you shine\nforward and overcome\nall of the other voices telling you like\noh what if it doesn't work or what if it\nthinks it's stupid\nbut in that journey ultimately i don't\nthink has to do with the psychology of\nimposter syndrome i don't think has to\ndo with like your some scars i think\nthat journey is a spiritual one\nand so what i want to apologize for is i\nfeel like i've introduced a lot of\ndifferent concepts and i've left you\nhanging on each one\nno i think that this was really good\nlike\nit it just makes me think a lot more\nabout\nagain about like who i am as a person\nbecause that's not something that i\nreally ever think about um and it also\ni don't know makes me think about my\npast a lot and\nand why i have certain feelings about\nthings and like\nagain going back to being like oh man i\nreally had to like off a version of\nmyself\nlike that uh and i i think\nagain like that's something as a male\nthat\nwe have an issue with is like i suppress\na ton of stuff and it's like oh did i\never\nreally processed that of like having to\ngo through that\nand like you know going away from this\nother\nversion of myself that was a giant part\nof my life for such a long time like i\nnever\ni've never really processed that before\nor even really thought about it at all\nif i'm being honest\nyeah okay is there anything that um i\ncan\nhelp you with or anything that you want\nmore direction on\num yeah i guess sort of like\nfiguring out who who\ni am and that's that's obviously like a\nvery\nbroad thing but like i don't even know\nwhere to start of\ni don't even know where to start there\nand that that's something that i think\ncoincides with like\nself-love too because i i think that i\nhave a really hard time with that\nand i think that i i don't have a super\ngreat impression of\nmyself and i don't even know where to\nbegin\nwith that like how do you even begin\nwith like loving yourself\nand like because it's not like i hate\nmyself but it's\ni don't know where to start you know\nwhat i mean yeah i i know exactly what\nyou mean\num\nme just let me just think for a second\ni want to share with something with you\nbut for some reason i feel like it's\nit feels a little bit promotional to me\nand i don't want to do that and i'm just\ntrying can i just like think through why\nokay i'm just going to steer clear of\nthat um\ni made this guide to meditation and and\nlet me just think okay because i think\nit does illustrate the point well but i\ndon't wanna\nit feels to me like i'm i'm gonna\nadvertise for something but i just don't\nwant to\nbut i think it's actually it's this is\nwhy i made it\nthis is a common problem so people have\nbeen asking me like in our community for\na long time like\nwhat is like how do i figure out like\nwho i am\nand so this is where i draw a little bit\non eastern spirituality but like we\nbasically made this course on meditation\nhopefully it'll come out in a couple\nmonths\num but a big part of this is something\ncalled the the atman pada\nso atman means soul or self and pada\nmeans path\nand so there is some like stuff about\nfiguring out like what is the nature of\nself\ni don't know if that makes sense or not\nbut like yeah it's interesting because\nwe don't really\nthink about it we don't like really get\ntaught\nwhat it is so my hope is that you know\nthis\nwill help people on their journey and i\nwould encourage you to check it out\nbecause\ni'm going to answer your question now\nbut like there's more detail about it\nthat i i like to share so it's a whole\nset of things like practices and\nand understanding but let's start here\nokay did that feel\nlike i just felt like it was\ninappropriate to try to i mean i'm\ntrying to promote it it's just\ni just it felt like i mean you have\nresources that you've made to help\npeople with the exact same questions but\nit just it felt like\ndisingenuous for some reason it did not\ncome across\nthat way at all um so here's what i\nwould say like so the first thing is\nthat like discovering who you are is\nabsolutely a process and there are\na bunch of different steps okay so\nthere's an experiential route\nright which we touched on today and if\nyou liked that kind of thing\nthen i can guide you more there i'm\ngoing to give you like some kind of\npractice\nin the next five minutes there's also\nlike sort of a journaling\nor almost like intellectual or\ncontemplative route\nwhich is like using like logic\nphilosophy thinking maybe taking a long\nwalk it's not an experience\nso if i were to ask you to find\nmasculinity within yourself if you\nidentify as a man\nthat's an experiential thing yeah so\nthere's a little bit more of like a\nphilosophical or\nintellectual or contemplative approach\nwhich is separate from the experiential\napproach\nand then the third thing that i'm going\nto offer you is\num hold on let me think what was the\nthird thing\noh yeah the third thing is something\nrelating to dreams and nightmares\nbecause maybe we can hit two birds with\none stone there\nbut there's particularly a practice\nwhich i think will give you a clue as to\nwho you truly are\nthat that relates to dreams and\nnightmares\num so which one do you want do you want\nthe experiential one the dreams and\nnightmares one\nor the contemplative philosophical\nuh let's do\nthe experiential one\nokay\ndo you meditate i don't um\nand that's something that i've wanted to\ndo and i've tried before\num and i've had a really hard time doing\nit because i get too distracted\nand my mind just like goes everywhere um\nand i because that's something that i\nwould really like to do and i think that\ni would benefit from it but i don't\nreally know how\nto how to do it with my brain\nbeautiful okay this is gonna be this is\ngonna be easy easy peasy loving squeezy\nokay\nwe're gonna do two we're gonna do two or\nthree birds with one stone\nso what we're gonna do is use your adhd\nto help you figure out who you are\nso this is what we're gonna do we're\ngonna i'm gonna teach you a regular\nmeditation practice which you're gonna\nbe terrible at\ngreat and then what we're going to do is\nthe real meditation practice behind that\nwhich is going to trick you into\ndiscovering who you are\ngreat okay so i'm going to give you\nmeditation practice and this is what's\ngoing to happen\nyour mind is not going to want to do it\nand then there is going to be a part of\nyou that tries to force your mind into\ndoing it\ndoes that make sense and so then the\nquestion that i really want you to pay\nattention you can fail catastrophically\nat the meditation practice\nlet your adhd mind is wander as much as\nyou want to i mean\ndon't let it go but try to pull it back\nand what i really want you to pay\nattention to\nis what is the part of you that is\npulling your mind back\nwhat is that right because if if we're\nsaying that your mind is doing one thing\nwhat is the part of you that is\ncontrolling your mind\ndoes that make sense yeah so we're gonna\ngo like a two-layer deep\nmeditation technique where if you\nsucceed great then you learned how to\nmeditate and your mind paid attention\nno big deal wonderful okay we've\ntricked you into meditating and even if\nyou fail i want you to just notice\nwhat is the part of you that is\nintending\nand what is the part of you that is\nfailing does that make sense\nyeah and then try to figure out which\none is the real you\nokay so next question i'll give you so\nnow we have to come up with a generic\nmeditation\ntechnique i really like to start with\nsomething for some people who have adhd\ni do something called alternate nostril\nbreathing have you ever heard of that or\ntried that\ni'm not okay so i like this practice\nbecause\nit isn't easy to do so if you think\nabout the mind with adhd\nif it's very if i sat you if i told you\nto close your eyes and observe your\nbreath\nwhat would your mind do i'd start\nmanually breathing\nokay good and then what would your mind\ndo uh\nprobably trail off um\nyeah so so with the mind with adhd we\nneed to give you something\nharder to do and the more difficult it\nis to do\nlike the more balls your mind has to\njuggle the more\nlikely you are to successfully meditate\nokay okay\nso i'm going to teach you a weird\npattern of breathing that you kind of\nlike\nis hard to do and that's going to\nhopefully help us okay\nso it's going to be failures upon\nfailures upon failures so first of all\ntake your right hand okay can you\nfold can i see it can you move it in\nfront of the camera yeah\nit can you fold the the these two\nfingers down\nyep good okay so now what we're going to\ndo is i'm going to take my right\nthumb and block my right nostril very\ngood\nand i'm going to breathe in through my\nleft\nnow i'm going to block the left nostril\nyep pinky yep pinky good exhale\nbreathe in through the same nostril\nswitch breathe out exhale\nin\nswitch out\nin\nswitch out\nwe're going to pause for a second you\ngot the hang of it\nyeah so it's confusing because you're\ngoing to breathe in switch\nand breathe out and then you breathe in\nagain\nso you always switch on a full breath\nokay\nwhat some people want to do is they want\nto go in\nout switch incorrect\nyeah it's in and then what\nand then switch and then what and then\nout\nand then what and then in and then what\nand then switch and then out\nbeautiful okay so we're going to do this\nfor like\nhow long you want to do it however long\nit takes\nokay we're going to do like one to three\nminutes okay\nso i want you to do that and if your\nmind wanders\nwe're gonna stack stuff up so we're\ngonna go straight to hard mode okay so\nwe're not if\nyou just get if this is enough to occupy\nyour mind and it's all you can handle\nthat's great then we've tricked you into\nmeditating\nhere's a question what should i be\nthinking about\nfocus on maintaining the the the rhythm\nokay okay if your mind starts to wander\njust try to make sure you're doing the\npractice properly\nor what you can do is focus on the\nsensation of the breath\nentering and leaving okay\ncool i know it sounds weird what you\nshould be yeah and then remember if your\nmind starts to wander\nlet it come back to the breath and then\npay attention to who's bringing the mind\nback\nokay okay so we're gonna do this for\nlike three minutes\nso close your eyes sit up straight\nand fail go\nhey\nme\nyes\nso\nokay go ahead and finish the round that\nyou're on\nlet your eyes stay closed for a second\nokay so i'm gonna ask\nwhat is your mind doing now what was\nyour mind doing\nduring the practice um\nit feels a little lighter now i guess is\nhow i would describe it\nuh-huh during it i was going back and\nforth\nbetween focusing on breathing\nand noticing how congested i am okay\num we're also thinking about uh\nwhat twitch chat was saying while i was\ndoing that\nokay so what so i want you to\nso thinking was your mind\nwhat was the focusing on your breathing\nis that mind\ni would assume it's also mine just a\ndifferent part of mind\nokay more like focused like\ni want to do the thing okay and and\nwhat so when you started thinking about\nwhat twitch hat was thinking about\nyeah and you returned to focusing on the\nbreath or once twitch had entered the\npicture it's hard to get them out\nuh it was very ping-pongy so it was like\na thought would enter about chat and\nthen i'd be like no focus on the\nbreathing and then i'd go back to\nfocusing on the breathing and then i'd\nswitch to this nostril and i'd be like\nwow it's really hard to breathe out of\nthat\nokay nostril then i'd be like no back to\nbreathing okay so now open your eyes\nso there's a lot going on there first of\nall i think you did a fantastic job\ncool okay so here's why even though you\nwere thinking about a lot of stuff\nso many important things there that are\nso subtle so the first is that\ni want you to notice the interaction\nbetween\nnoticing and thought so before you\nthink about how congested you are what\nhas to happen first\nlike the spark of the idea in the back\nof my mind\nso the noticing happens first and you\nsay spark of idea in the back of your\nmind\nit's not in your mind it's actually\noutside of your mind yeah\nso this is where the mind is a thinking\nmachine\nit's where we experience thoughts and\nemotions and have identities\nabout ourselves our ego our emotions and\nour intellect all exist within our mind\nwhen you watch a sunset and it's\nbeautiful and you're just like vibing\nthat's not really thinking it's not\nreally emotion it's not\njoy or sadness there's not really ego\nyou're not like oh like if you take a\npicture like if you take a selfie of\nyourself then that becomes ego\nbut if you're just enjoying the\nexperience\nthat's not actually inside mind it's\nactually outside of mind\ndoes that make sense yeah so the yogis\nhypothesize that the noticing capacity\nactually exists outside of mind\nand what happens is you notice something\nlike my nostril is congested\nand then your mind starts to make\njudgments about it\ndoes that make sense it starts thinking\nhypothesizing\noh man this is crazy what are they gonna\nthink can they hear it\nthere goes the mind yep\nright do they think that i'm super\ncongested can they tell\nthere's the ego right\nand then what did you do did you let go\nof those thoughts and come back to the\nbreath\nyeah how\nby i guess by me\nnoticing that i wasn't on the breathing\nthat i wasn't focusing on the breathing\nand then so\ni almost like got distracted by\ngoing back to the breathing yes yeah\nvery good\nso noticing you're like oh\nmy mind has run over there now so now\nthe question\ni know it was your first time but i'm\ngonna ask you what the hell is it that\ndoes the noticing\nbecause if your mind is distracted how\nare you able to\nlike what is it that's pulling the mind\nbecause we've concluded the mind is\nrunning out of like ryan is like oh my\ngod what does switch chat think about\nthe sound of my congested ass nostril\nthat's what your mind is doing yeah so\nwhat is that\nhow are you if your mind is by\ndefinition distracted\nhow can you undistract it doesn't make\nsense you can't undistract yourself\nright there's the second faculty and\nlike does that\nsort of make sense something is outside\nof the mind and like\ntugging on it you're like get back\nyeah and then the mind\nand then you focus on the breathing and\nthen what happens in your mind\nand then i notice something again\nof like mostly my nostril\nbecause i can feel it yep so then you\nnotice\nand then the mind starts again because\nboy does the mind\nlove to like you know think like oh like\nif we think about social anxiety like\noh that person is looking at me he must\nthink i'm stupid\nthere's just a noticing there's an\nobservation that our mind attaches all\nthis crap to it\nyeah and then it goes off to the races\nyou can yawn or sneeze whichever you\nneed to do bro i'm not sure which one it\nwas going to be\njust like my face made a face all right\nso so maybe that's that's your body or\nbrain's way of signaling\nmaybe this is a good place to stop i\nthink it is a good place to stop\nbut i want you to just appreciate that\nthere is some capacity\noutside of your mind that can restrain\nyour mind\nand that's what i'm going to hypothesize\nto you is actually closest to the real\nyou\nbecause i'd say that all of your best\ninspiration doesn't come\nfrom the mind it comes from that thing\nand then your mind starts to shape it\nthink about how to execute it and all\nthat kind of stuff but that the\ninspiration actually comes from outside\nof mind what do you think about that\nyeah that that makes a lot of sense\nactually\nuh because there's a i don't know a lot\nof times where\ni'll just have like a random idea that\ncomes kind of\nout of nowhere and then i start thinking\nabout it\nexactly so the thinking is separate from\nthe birth of the random idea\nso spend time in that space and now i'm\ngonna ask you\nthat noticing capacity if that's outside\nof the mind\nwhat is it or what are the qualities of\nit\nuh\nthat is correct that is correct that is\nexactly correct\nso ultimately what the yogis concluded\nis that it doesn't have\nqualities yeah because like even when\nyou're like\ni don't know how to describe it that is\ncorrect it cannot be described\nit is formless and this so this is the\nthing and now we're going to\nkind of get to the punch line right so\nlike this is something normally that i\ndon't\nyou know i teach people over the course\nof weeks but now i'm going to give you a\nhypothesis\nfor you to test and tear apart is that\nthat observing capacity\nis what they call divine it is actually\nformless\nand like it doesn't have qualities it is\nneither good nor bad\nit is just it is what is it is that\nwhich notices\neverything else it's kind of like\nyou know there's if i watch tv like\nthere's water on the screen but is the\nwater on the screen wet\nso if i'm sitting in the theater\neverything that happens in the screen of\nthe mind\ncan happen on the screen of the mind but\nsitting in the theater i can never get\nwet no matter how\nhard of a storm there is on the tv\nscreen yeah\nand so all of the qualities that we\nthink of in life happen inside our mind\noh i'm better than this person i'm worse\nthan this person\ni'm successful i'm on sex all that\nshit's in the mind\nit's not really who you are and as we\ntunnel down and like\nadult child whatever like it's not who\nyou are what you are is that thing\nand the closer you get to that thing the\nbetter you'll feel\nand when you're cur when you're\nconstantly grounded in that thing\nyou will have attained enlightenment\nwhich is what would the talked about\nthis was really really great by the way\nokay good good it\nreally got me thinking a lot\n[Laughter]\nand also thinking about how to not think\nthere we go\nwell's done yeah\ngood job ethan so listen yeah i'm really\nhappy to hear that\nso you know i yeah spend more time in\nthat space\nand even if your mind wanders if your\nmind can get feels congested\nthat's totally fine because the other\nthing that you're doing i know this\nsounds weird\nbut every time your mind wanders and you\nbring it back\nwhat you're actually doing that's\nactually a mental push-up\nso if you think about adhd adhd is your\nmind\nwandering around without any kind of\ndirection because when you were eight\nyears old what did you want your mind to\ndo\ni wanted to focus absolutely\ncould not so when you meditate and you\nstart thinking about congestion\nand you bring the mind back what are you\ntraining your mind to do\nto come back yep and so the worse you\nare at meditating what does that mean\nabout the number of push-ups that you're\ndoing when you meditate\ni'm doing more push-ups and what does\nthat mean for your\nswolness i'm getting stronger\nabsolutely so the more your mind wanders\nliterally you are strengthening a\ncapacity in your brain\ncalled frontal lobe inhibition of other\nthings\nevery time your mind mind wanders every\ntime you bring it back\nyou are actually becoming more buff\nmentally\nyou are training your attention it's\nlike a dog that runs over there and\nyou're like\nheel boy and then the more you train it\nthe more it's going to start to listen\nyeah my mind is going to be\nso huge it's not\nyour mind that's gonna be huge it's you\nthat's gonna be huge\ni'm gonna be huge you're gonna be so\nsmall dude\ni don't know if you're in a relationship\nor what your you know sexual preferences\nbut i'm just gonna assume a\ncisgendered male who's heterosexual and\nthe ladies are gonna love it\n[Laughter]\ni can't wait\n[Laughter]\nwell thank you so much this was this was\namazing thank you so much for having me\non\nyeah man it was great having you and i\nyou know really fantastic i'm i'm\nreally rooting for you ethan and i think\nlike keep walking the journey that\nyou're walking because i think it's\ngoing to be great\nyeah i i'm excited to to\nhopefully dive more into meditation and\nand figure that out and figure out\nhow to do more mind push-ups not mind\npush-ups\nother yes yes yes\nso so it's interesting because in\nsanskrit they call it the other\nthat's like what they because it doesn't\nhave anyway\nbut good luck to you man thank you very\nmuch for coming on and\nand you know best wishes yeah thank you\nso much\nthank you thank you twitch chat for\nhearing my congested\nnostrils ah see there's there's the\ninsecurity\nthere it is finds any way to\npeek its head it does it does so take\ncare man bye\nall right have a good one all right\nchatars\noh man that was great hopefully that\nwasn't like too much of a span of\ndifferent things\ndid that make sense to people"
