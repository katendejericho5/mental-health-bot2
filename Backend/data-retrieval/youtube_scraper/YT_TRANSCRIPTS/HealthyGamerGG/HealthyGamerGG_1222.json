    "transcript": "today's conversation there's a there's a\nlot to learn from today's conversation\nthe first thing that i want to talk a\nlittle bit about\nis inappropriate affect and so sometimes\nlike over the course of today people may\nnotice that\nyou know there's like it feels kind of\nweird as they're watching the\ninteraction\nand that just tells you that there's\nlike some parts of your brain that are\nable to like\nclue in and like something's not adding\nup here\nand so we'll we'll really see like this\nconnection between\ninappropriate affect and like suppressed\nemotions and that the more you\nfamiliarize yourself with this the more\nthat you dig into this like that's where\nthere's stuff underneath\nalso really a great exploration of of\npsychological defense mechanisms\nbecause we see them all in action and at\nthe end of the day\nyou know someone was kind enough to come\non and share\ntheir experience of growing up in a cult\nwelcome buddy hey nice over here\num so and what's your name what do you\ngo by uh you can call me zorian\nmissourian okay welcome zorian\nand so i i didn't realize this until i\nyou know hit the go live button on\nstream but apparently we're gonna be\nyou're you were a\nmember of a cult before yes i was a\ncultist\nokay oh a cultist so that that sounds\nlike\nthat sounds like a class you know it\nmakes it sound fancier right\nyeah and and um people are curious are\nyou're a cultist of of our cult or a\ndifferent cult\ndifferent different cult okay so maybe\nwe can convert you by the end\num yeah so brainwashed i was brainwashed\noh\nokay so\num is that what you want to talk about\ntoday or you want to talk about\nsomething else or\nyes so we can talk about that and i was\nthinking maybe\nuh we can talk about the psychological\nthe harm it did to me i suppose like the\ninsecurities i have because i grew up in\nthat environment or\nwhat happened after leaving yeah\nzorin i would love to hear about that\nand if there's some way that\nthat you know we can support you with\nsome of that stuff i'd\nreally love to try um so why don't we\nstart with um\nyou know kind of like how you joined\nor actually let's start with like like\nwhere you grew up and stuff like\nyou know okay so here's how i joined\ni that's all was born\nokay so tell us a little bit about you\nknow what\ngrowing up was third third generation\nthird\nokay wow like my parents were already in\nthe cold when i\nwhen i joined okay when you were born\nsure you can call it that okay and do\nyou feel comfortable telling us like\nwhat the cult\nwas or is that something you want to you\nknow we don't want to do anything that\nwill\nget you in trouble or anything like that\nit's not a big deal okay yeah so what\ncan you tell us about the\nlike what growing up was like in the\ncult\nyes so you asked earlier what the cult\nwas about\ndid you okay sure so\nit's it was a sex cult okay the leader\nwas a pedophile\nokay oh god yes\nwhat does that mean it was a sex cult\nlike what is the\nokay so the cult had a tradition\nof free sex okay\nand uh the idea was there was a\ntradition called\nflirty fishing where women\nwould give like they would prostitute\nthemselves\nto gain converts to gain comforts\nconverts to converts okay okay\nconversions yeah\nyeah and and like so is this like an\norganization or what like how does\nthis it's called the family\ninternational\nthe fourth or the children of god have\nyou heard of it and\nno but what is that does that sound like\na call dude\nthe family internet it up oh wikipedia\nlook it up\nokay sometime so can you tell us zorian\na little bit about like you know\nwhat tell us maybe a little bit about\nyour parents and\nand what it was like living with them\ngrowing up\nsure so i had a\nkind of a unique situation uh even\ninside the cult because my parents\nwere missionaries for the cult okay\nuh they what they would do is they would\ngo around from city to city\nproselytizing okay yeah\nand as a result life growing up was\nwe would resettle every 18 to 24 months\nokay new house new home new neighborhood\na new city\ndifferent country etc and and how would\nthey\nproselytize\nso we would go out\nand let me see if i can remember exactly\nso\nwe would get people interested about the\ncold like maybe\ntry to shame them or guilt-trip and\nguilt-trip them\ninto their negative habits\nand then they would we would tell them\nabout jesus\nright and we would get them to\nsay a prayer and then we would like\nmy parents how they did it was\nfrom what i recall vaguely they did a\nsales pitch\non the the cult i think\nokay and just getting people to join\nthat was the idea um\nso zorian can we actually take a step\nback from the cult for a minute and like\njust what was it\nlike growing up for you like were you in\nschool\nand like siblings i was i was\ni was homeschooled a lot okay so\nand social interaction was limited\nfor example no no like i had no access\nto books\nno accident like unsaid there was heavy\nsensors censorship\nno books no internet no music except\nmusic designed by the cult\nno magazines nothing nothing that could\nharm the image\nin our heads of the cult and what was\nthe\nclue what was the image that you grew up\nwith of the cult\num so i felt like we were the chosen\nones\nokay can you tell me a little bit about\nthat yeah sure so\nso let's see so the cult was rife with\nconspiracy theories\nlike there was this this idea that the\nilluminati\nwas pulling the world strings and that\nthe system\nanything outside the cult was evil\nright kind of scare us from trying to um\naccess outside information right\nokay and they try to instill\na sense of superiority in us\nto try and push non-believers away so\nthat we wouldn't get contaminated\nright that's that's my analysis\nyeah and and so if you if your parents\nmove to a new city like i'm curious when\nyou're like eight years old\nand you don't go to school and you're\nnot given access to books or the\ninternet like literally how would you\nspend your day\nlike what so that's interesting when i\nwas um\nso let's be let's be\na little bit more into details so i went\nto a regular school\nsecond grade and third grade okay and\nthen from fourth grade up\nmy parents decided to homeschool me\ncompletely because uh\ni don't know what the reason was\nactually i think i begged\ni begged them to homeschool me\nmaybe that was my fault um\ndo you remember how you felt when you\nbegged them\nyes so i was constantly bullied okay\nand um so i had okay\nso i the reason why i backed them to\nhomeless homes homeschooled me was\nbecause before second grade they were\nalready homeschooling i see oh\nso so they were homeschooling you then\nyou went to second grade and\ndo you have a sense of why you got\nbullied\ni was\nso it's very very long time back but\na lot of times people don't remember no\ni think it was uh i had a sense of being\nholier than you\nokay so so it was sort of like a\nsuperiority kind of thing that was baked\ninto you\nokay and then yeah so once you started\ngetting homeschooled then what was that\nwhat were your days like i would\nreceive classes in the morning i guess\noh yeah so there's there was this thing\num this horrible horrible tradition\nso i hate it absolutely called\ndevotionals\nwhich is like um\nmandated brainwashing\nuh routine activities\nshall we call it like okay so my parents\nwould gather us children\nfor um a time of\nprayer you could say you could call them\nand we'll read the bible we will read\nmaterials like written or published by\nthe cult\nuh would listen to music we would pray\nwe would do stuff like that memorize\nbible verses that kind of stuff\nokay we're listening to music designed\nby the cult\nand how long would those devotionals\nlast like\nanywhere from one to two hours okay so\nyou would do that every day and so it\nsounds like you're\nyou were also learning like mathematics\nand how to read and things like that\nyes yes and so\ni it's kind of an unusual circumstance\nbecause i was\ntaught i guess\nthese things um from a very early age\nlike my parents\nbelieved in education which was abnormal\nfor the cult\nso i was taught to read and write in two\nlanguages from the age of two\ni was taught early math i was taught\nuh geography i was\ntaught from earlier age okay\nand then what were things like as you\ngrew a little bit older like let's say\n12 13\n15 17. so so\nactually before we go into the\nadolescent period yeah\ni would also my parents would take me\nproselytizing like\nyeah it's fine that's hard you have to\npronounce that but\ni i have this vivid memory of me\ngoing like up to people\nand converting them to the cult\nhow would you do that i was i was like\nsix or seven years old and they\nbasically\nused my cuteness my because\nchildren are cute right they you give\nyou're more likely to give a\nchild a chance yeah sure than an adult\nyep right so they would use me as a tool\nsometimes\nto convert people and i had\nlike i had a like a little speech\nmemorized\nthat i would do and people would fall\nfor it it was\ndo you remember what the speech was or\nlike pieces of it\noh let me see and you know sorry you\ndon't have to share anything that you\ndon't feel comfortable with\nit's just i'm i'm so curious about you\nknow what\nwhat do you teach a seven-year-old to\nsay\nto convert people to your\nso uh the facade\nseemed very harmless right uh\neven to outsiders i would basically pray\nwith them\nand they would i would recite a prayer\nand like i would convince people to\nsay a prayer with me\nand i don't remember the exact words but\nit was something like jesus coming to my\nheart forgive me for my sins that kind\nof [ __ ]\nokay and then and\nwow okay so\nand then maybe what my parents would\ntake over and explain\nstuff and a little and stuff i couldn't\ncomprehend yet\nokay what country were you in if you\ndon't mind me asking\ni think so at the time of this anecdote\ni think i was in peru\nokay all right and and so\nyou know what what happened is you kind\nof grew up and hit adolescence\nwhat was that period of your life like\nokay so let's see i was very very\nconvinced that i wanted to spend the\nrest of my life\nin the school okay um\nwe were taught that we were the chosen\nones and\nthere were all sorts of like wacky\nthings going on for example\na lot of the lore was based on\nokay are you familiar with the bible\nyeah\nthere's a book at the end called\nrevelations yeah very familiar with it\na lot of the stuff came from\nthat chapter or that book in the bible\num it was very we were our group was the\nchosen one\nand there was gonna be a lot a period of\nseven years\nbefore the end of the world as we know\nand\nthe anti-antichrist was gonna take over\nfrom like uh\nthe illuminati and whatever [ __ ]\nthey were experiencing\nand our group would have special powers\nto attack or defend against\nuh who like the antichrist or whoever\nwas on top right\nand there were like doomsday prophecies\nand that\nwe were living like one of the phrases\nthat was most commonly repeated was\nwe are living in the times of the end\nright yeah wow okay\nso things i've heard from god zorian so\ni i'm\nso sometimes you know i'll ask people a\nlittle bit about growing up in their\nadolescence and things like that\nand and i'm kind of noticing that i\ndon't know\nit's interesting i it seems like\nsometimes when i ask you questions about\ntime\nit's like hard for you to put together\nlike sort of a timeline\nand and i mean is that i'm not trying to\nyou know shame you or anything it's just\nan interesting observation that i'm i'm\nwondering if actually like\nyour experience of growing up was not\nlike\nmarked by like landmarks of change\nit seems to like oh it feels to me like\nit all kind of blurs together\nyes right and it's also the fact that\ni've been trying to forget most of these\nthings\nfor the last 10 years sure okay\nlike after i left at the age of 18. i\nfelt like i left\nand how did that happen my parents\ni love them deeply they\nmy dad had this policy that after you're\n18\nyou can do whatever whatever the [ __ ]\nyou want\nright okay\nso at close around the age of 17 i was\nalready getting fed up with the [ __ ]\nwhat is that what [ __ ] is that i was\nstarting to be aware uh\ngain awareness that i was being\nemotionally manipulated\nand how are you being emotionally\nmanipulated\nso son of stuff for example i was\nuh forced to do chores\nuh\nbased on the idea that\nthis is gonna sound completely stupid\nand completely out of field but\nit was it was a kind of god is watching\nyou\nand taking notes right so if you fail to\ndo your chores\nhe's gonna take that as a sign of\nrebellion or that maybe you\nyou can't go into heaven or that kind of\nstuff\nright that you're supposed to honor your\nparents or honor your\nyour mother and father that kind of\nstuff and it was\nbasically yeah it was coercion\nand why do you think that that sounds\nstupid\ngood question i have no idea okay so let\nme ask\nno no okay wait okay i remember now so\nit sounds a bit it smells a bit like uh\nentitlement you know like\ni could have i suppose\nno no it's like first world uh\ncold life you know like\nworse things could have happened to me\nthan being coerced\nto do my chores right\nokay like i could have been coerced into\nchild prostitution for example which\ndid not happen to me thank god\nyeah so i it's interesting i'm hearing\nsome\nyou know a couple of things here so one\nis like i wonder if you say it sounds\nstupid because i i don't think it\nit doesn't sound stupid to me at all it\nsounds like you know you are in a cult\nso of course you're going to be like\nforced to do things that are\nemotionally like you know based on\nemotional minifigures yeah but it sounds\nlike a kind of an odd thing to complain\nabout like it's not such a big deal\nright you're first forced to do tours so\nwhat\nyeah so i i think i feel like most\npeople would say gain some perspective\nkid\nyeah so i it gets me to my question is\ndo you feel stupid\nno okay\nand when you say most people would say\ngain some perspective kid like what\nyou know that that sounds why do you\nthink people would say that\noh because i look at myself from the\noutside and i try to\ni see things objectively i guess\nyeah so has when you've shared this\nstuff with people on the outside has\nanyone told you that\ni've never shared it with anyone well oh\nnot this specific detail i haven't\nshared it no\nokay and because i\nyou know i know it's this is going to\nsound kind of weird saurian but i think\nthat your attempts to be objective are\nactually the most subjective thing that\nyou do\ncompletely you're right you know and\nit's interesting because when you when\nyou talk when you\nthink about like i want to just like\nnotice and like\nokay so so it's not objectivity it's\nsubjectivity\nfrom a second point of view yep so i\nthink that's the view with which you\njudge yourself\nit's you judging yourself on the outside\nbecause i don't think that like at least\ni mean i could be wrong here and i'm not\nreally paying attention to twitch chat\nbut like\nat least i'm i'm sort of feeling very\nvery strongly that like i don't\nfault you for anything that happened but\nwhat i'm detecting from you is that like\nmaybe you beat yourself up a little bit\nfor like\nfalling for their emotional manipulation\nand like who are you to complain because\nyou know other other people in the cult\ngot child prostitution and you got out\nearly and your parents taught you two\nlanguages so like\nwho are you to complain\nyeah okay so it sounds like i i fault\nmyself\nor somehow blame myself for uh\nbeing part of the cult yeah wasting my\ntime basically\nyeah that's a good way to put it what do\nyou think no\nokay uh and here's here's why here's my\nmy explanation\ncorrect me if i'm wrong so\nafter the cold when i left i\nfelt a grave sense of loss\num i felt like my\nmost of my life or my entire life had\nbeen stolen from stolen from me\nyeah um and\nuh i felt very very bitter i suppose you\ncould say\nand when did you start to feel like it\nhad been stolen from you\nright after i left okay\nprobably okay probably not the exact\nsame day i left\nbut in the next two years and\nand so i mean it sounds like you left at\n18. so you are unhappy\nwith like something about needing to do\nchores and being guilted\nhow did you make the decision to leave\ni don't know i suppose i just didn't\nlike being coerced\nand i told when i was\non the on my 18th birthday i went\nto my pastor i told them\ni'm an atheist and i went to my\nparents and i told them i'm an atheist\nthey accepted it so really\nyes what did they say\nwell my dad was like you're 18. so do\nwhatever the [ __ ] you want\ndid he use the word [ __ ] there like was\nhe upset\nprobably not probably not no he wasn't\nupset\nbut here's the thing i later discovered\nthat my parents had actually left the\ncult when i was 15.\nthey were just continuing with the\nculture i guess\nuh of child rearing after they left\nlike they dumped all the books all the\ncultist material aside\nwhen i was 15 three years earlier but\nthey continued to use the same\nmanipulative\ntechniques they had learned from the\ncult interesting\nhow do you understand i suppose that\nplayed a role\nin their accepting my leaving the cult\nyeah because i mean it's it's strange\nright when i think about you know\nlife i mean like multi-generation cults\nlike in a kid comes out at 18 and says\ni'm leaving i i imagine based on you\nknow i don't really have any experience\nwith cults but\nyes but you've read the stories right\nyeah so i'd imagine that your parents\nwould like you know freak out i've\ncertainly\nyou know worked with people who have had\nlike very religious upbringings and they\nsort of tell their parents hey like\nyou know i'm not really into this and\nthen their parents will like\nflip out we'll ostracize them we'll like\nyou know like don't you understand what\nyou're doing to us\nand to everyone around you like it's\nsuch a bit like you know and i'm it's\nkind of weird that your parents were\nsort of okay with it\ni consider myself lucky in the extreme\nyes\nyeah so you consider yourself lucky but\nlike what do you think about them\ntossing out the books but still\ncontinuing to do the emotional\nmanipulation\nwow i mean my parents are a little bit\nfeel like they're simpletons\nwhat does that mean like the reason for\nleaving the cult\nwas dumb what was their reason for\nfeeling\nleaving the cult i was\nthey received the sign from god did you\nbelieve it\nand what was their sign from god the\nsign from god\nwas my younger sister got\nsick to the point where she was\nuh i'm not gonna share something oh sure\nof course yeah um and and\nwhy do you think she got my younger sis\ngot really really [ __ ] sick\nand the cult had this tradition like\npeople inside the cult were taught that\nif anything negative\nhappens to you it happens for a reason\nright that god is punishing you in some\nway\nright if you got a cold god would be\npunishing you\nyou had to pray and seek his guidance\nright um and i think\nthat is where my mom got the idea that\nshe should leave the cult because my\nsister was so [ __ ] sick\ninteresting and you think that that's a\nstupid reason\nyeah okay how do you feel about your\nparents\ni love them um\n[Music]\ni also think they're dumb sure are you\nangry with them\nso i was angry with them in the first\nfour years\nand then i forgave them what were you\nangry with them for\nfor having raised me in a cult that's a\ndamn good answer\nwell said and\nand then how did you how did you find\nhow did you find the ability to forgive\nthem\ni don't know i i do remember\nwhat what's the mental process the\nexperience that led me to forgive them\nso i think\ni had an experience where\ni started to see evidence that my hate\nwas ruining my life can you help us\nunderstand that\nokay so i was extremely bitter and\nextremely angry\nabout everything that had happened\ninside the cult\nand like i felt like 18 years of my life\nhad been wasted\ni lost most of the opportunities\nto learn things and\ni felt like most of it had been coerced\nlike ed it was not my fault\nand i remember going on a date with a\nchick\nand she noticed\nthat i was very hateful inside and uh i\nthink i think\nthe sign of it was i attacked\nuh an indigenous person\nthat was selling trying to sell candy to\nme on the street\nand i attacked them and i told them\nto go kill themselves\nright and my date was like no you can't\ndo that just\nstop we're we're done the date is over\nright\nand then i went back to my place\ni spent the entire night in reflection\nand then i came to realize my conclusion\nwas\nmy hate is ruining my life\nright so i did a 180\nand first things i did forgive my\nparents i told\nmy parents i forgive or gave them and\nthen i\ntried i started\ni started trying altruism\nor helping people with no strings\nattached provided they\ndidn't ask for my help\nokay and what was your experience of\nthat\n[Music]\nhe became a pretty strong hell belief\nuntil\nlike a few days ago\nwhat happened a few days ago okay\nsomeone\nso there's this ego this ego what\nconstrual what does that mean\nso a construal is a symbol right\nlike a phrase okay and\nit represents your ego okay\nand you talk about this all the time\nright ego uh\nwhen eel conflicts with emotions ego\nwins and when emotions conflict with\nlogic\nemotions went right okay sure\nand this altruism thing of helping\npeople with no strength attached was my\nego\nand it was it was ruining my life\nhow so i was giving until i had nothing\nto get\nand a few weeks ago i started to hit\nlike rock bottom\nrock bottom because i started sleeping\non the floor\nbecause i just i couldn't help myself\nbut\njust help people i guess\nso what does that have to do with\nsleeping on the floor\nwell sleeping on the floor is\nuncomfortable i guess right\ni have no i don't have enough money to\nbuy myself a mattress\nokay and then but\ni sort of settle into it i start to feel\ncomfortable or\nwhat's what's not comfortable content i\nhave\ni've learned contentment shall we say\ndo you find that you're more content\nlike the more you kind of deprive\nyourself of stuff like does it feel\nlike perversely good to like help people\nto the point where you don't have enough\nmoney to buy a mattress\nyes or not enough money to pay the bills\nand stuff like that\nand then\na friend recently uh\nargued me out of that value or that ego\nlike he made an art he presented a\nlogical argument\nthat my ego control was unethical\nthat by helping people\nuntil i have nothing to give i'm\nactually helping\nbad people gain power\nbecause i'm losing power by helping\nothers\ninteresting so so not the person that\nyou're helping but some other\nthe more the less power you have\nif i yes if i start to help to a point\nwhere i'm losing\npower then i'm not i'm\n[Music]\ni'm not making as much of as of an\nimpact as i possibly could\nsure sure right yeah\nand he argued it was unethical\nand so i mean you're sort of saying that\na logical argument kind of brought you\nout of this so what's going on with your\nego\nyeah so i have uh that that's\ninteresting that's interesting i\nhave an ego that says i must have a\nlogical explanation for everything i do\nokay so this is how\nlogic trump's emotion okay in my case\nbecause my it's my ego\nhow do you feel about being so\naltruistic\nthat feels good i guess but\nno it's that's irrelevant um\nhow do i feel about being so altruistic\nthat's a good question\ni'm not sure zorian do you feel stupid\nfor being so altruistic\nyes yes i beat myself up for it yep\nwe noticing a theme here\ni beat myself up for things yes\ndefinitely all the time yeah absolutely\nright\nand i know where it comes from i can\ntell you i know you i know you do so\ntell me\nso i am afraid\nof opportunity cost\nokay opportunity cost\ndrives terror to me\nyep i think that makes a lot yeah\nand can you see where that comes from\nsure what's your name\num you're sure you want me to answer\nfirst\nokay i was making i was like i'm happy\nto\nbut but i i think that we'll learn more\nfrom you than we will from me okay fair\nenough\nyou're absolutely right this is an\neducation session so\nhold on pause for a second zorian let's\nthink about what's happening right now\ni'm happy to give you an answer it makes\na lot of sense to me that you're\nterrified of opportunity\num and and\ni'm happy to share what i think about\nthat but\ni just want to make sure that it felt\nlike you've never you never asked me\nbefore like we've been talking about a\nlot of stuff\nthis is the first time that you're like\nasking me about something\nso i almost feel like it's a test of\nsorts\nand i'm happy to take the test and pass\nher no no it's not it's not a test it's\nnot a test i have a\nhabit of asking people to make an\neducated guess about things because i'm\na teacher\nokay do you want to teach me i can guess\nno okay okay\nmy fear of opportunity cost comes\nfrom my parents moving around\na lot when i was a kid how so\nwhen i was very very young let's say\nnine to ten years old\ni would go out into the neighborhood and\nmake friends with\nkids and i would go\ni would grow kind of attached to the\nneighborhood\nand then my parents would move and that\nwas\nunpleasant it was it meant losing my\nfriends\nforever right\nthat was like irreversible and bad\nso i because this happened so often\ni started to pay attention\nto any signs that we might be moving\nokay and my parents could be planning a\nmove\nokay and when that happened i felt\nafraid\nokay yeah so what i would say\num zorian can i share my answer\nsure so i think it's similar but i think\nthat when you say you're terrified\nof opportunity costs i i think it's more\nof like what i would\nsort of detect from that is like a sense\nof grief and loss really not\nreally grief but more loss that you've\nhad you've you've had so much taken away\nfrom you\nthat like everything that you do like\nit's almost like you've had\nso much taken away from you that like\nyou don't really\nlike you like every decision that you\nmake now like has to be weighed very\nvery heavily\nbecause it's sort of like you've already\nused up\nall of your freebies and so like you\nknow you're on the verge of getting\nknocked out of the tournament\nlike every single time like every\ndecision you make is like the last\ndecision that you get to make and if you\nscrew\nup i'm terrified of irreversible\nmistakes yep right\nand and so so so i want to just point\nsomething out zorin so i i think that\ndo do you have a sense of how you're\nfeeling right now\nno okay\nso uh um\nsomething like some people might call\nthis alexa plymouth when i was\nuh what i remember when i was like\naround 17 18 19\ni felt like i was a robot\ni felt like i had no feelings\nit was weird um\nbut then over time as i reflected a lot\ni came to realize that i do have\nemotions they're just\nkind of identifying them becomes\nit's a little bit [ __ ] it takes time\nokay so how how do you feel about that\ndon't ask me i\n[Laughter]\nokay so how do i feel\nabout so what hold on so we just got\nsomething there right you say don't ask\nme\nright so when i ask you how does that\nmake you feel\ni don't have information yep so when\nsomeone get your teacher right so when\nsomeone asks a question and and someone\ndoesn't have an answer how does that\nperson feel\nwait wait wait can you say that again\nsure so you're a teacher right\nyes so when someone asks a question and\nsomeone else\ndoesn't have an answer how does the\nperson without the answer feel\nso when a student asks me a question\nnope\nsure just in general when when i ask\nwhen there's a\nsomeone who asks a question and someone\ndoesn't have an answer how does the\nperson without the answer feel\nwho is the person without an answer the\nperson who asked or the person who\ndoesn't have an\nanswer have the answer to respond the\nhave doesn't have the answer to respond\ni don't know so i would say that when\npeople ask me questions especially when\ni'm like\nyou know in school and i didn't have an\nanswer i felt stupid\noh okay what do you think\ni don't have an answer no\ni don't feel stupid for being ignorant\nokay\nso i think this is what's kind of\nconfusing so here's here's what i'm sort\nof\ngetting from you can i share some\nthoughts what sure\nyou're laughing\nwhat what is that\ni don't know so if you look at necessary\nconditions for laughter\nunexpected comes to mind\nand it needs to be\ni don't know\nso it needs to be something unexpected\nthat is seen as\nnot not harmful yeah okay so sorry we're\ngoing to take a step back because i\nthink there's a lot of stuff going on in\nthis conversation\nthat i think can be hard to follow so\nwe're going to try to i'm going to try\nto share with you what i understand okay\ni could be completely wrong here um\nso there there's some weird there's some\nweirdness\nand i i get the sense that you're\nsmiling but you actually are feeling\ndeeply deeply uncomfortable\nwhat do you think i don't feel anxiety\ni'm not yeah so i i like when i look at\nyour eyes i don't think you're having a\ngood time\nlike when i look at your face i see you\nsmiling\nbut i see a lot of tension but i really\ndon't think that this is\nnormally when we see someone smiling\nlike this we think like oh is this\nperson having fun\ni don't think you're having fun are you\nhaving fun\nokay so it's a feeling of euphoria do\nyou feel euphoria right now\npeony kind of genie okay so when we have\na big smile and we feel a tiny bit of\neuphoria i think there are other\nemotions in there\nand part of what makes this really yeah\nso\nso i'm just going to toss a couple of\nthings out the first zorian is that\nbecause i think it's like really\nhow can i i was about to say strange but\ni think\nthere's a lot going on in this\nconversation that is not being talked\nabout\nso it's sort of like there's like a\nstage but then there's like this whole\naudience on the outside that we're not\nreally addressing\nand i think that's part of what is is a\nlittle bit unusual about this\nconversation\nbecause i think you have a lot of stuff\ngoing on on the inside which you've done\nsuch an amazing job\nof keeping at the borders of like your\nconsciousness\nso i know it sounds weird so the first\nthing that i want to do zorian is like\nreally commend you\num because i i think that you've really\nshown\nto me so like i know that you know there\nare all kinds of psychological impacts\nfrom cults and stuff like that but\ni think it's really hard to grow up in a\ncult and like have\nyou know the fortitude to leave when\nyou're 18\nto notice some of the impacts that it's\nhad on you to really because like like\nit's because if we really think about it\nlike you know you kind of\ngot screwed and you have to be a little\nbit careful about your self-judgment in\nterms of like you know if you look at\nlike the average person they were given\nso many opportunities like\nyou know people read them bedtime\nstories like their parents read the\nbedtime stories like their parents would\ngo on trips\nand you got to like there was just\nreally basic stuff right like\nmost people get the opportunity to make\nfriends and keep friends and really\nreally like\nbasic human stuff that was really taken\naway from you at a young age\nand and so i'm sure that there's a part\nof you so i think there's this like\nthread\nof like stupidity and judgmentalness\nwhich you have towards yourself which\nyou try to push away through logic\nbut the interesting thing is that when\nyou talk about the construction between\nlike logic overcoming emotion\nthat still means that the emotion is\nthere your logic may win\nbut like really i think moving forward\nis like sure\nlike logic needs to win like let's say\nit's 51 49\nbut then you're still like even if you\ncan overcome that feeling of stupidity\nwhat i think really like\nwhat i what i what i see is like the\nnext step of your growth\nis not letting logic win but not having\nlogic\nneed to win right it's really truly\nletting go of some of these things like\nego and emotions and stuff like that\nand you're even doing it now right so\nthere's been a change a little bit\nin in the way that you're kind of\nlooking there's a change in the way like\nyou seem more relaxed\ni don't know exactly what's going on but\ni just noticed you had like a big sigh\nwhich i think is good yes\nso i think you've managed to it's\ninteresting because i think you've like\nbeen forced to come up with your own\nmethods of survival in recovery\nof trying to build a life out of the\nshambles that you were given\nand i think everything i have i invented\non my own absolutely\nand i think it's it's truly amazing that\nyou've come as far as you have\nand at the same time i think that you\nknow a little help will go a long way\nand and that there are some things that\ni think it's worth sort of\nre-conceptualize or like rethinking and\ni think i feel really good about this\nbecause i think you\nyou've demonstrated so clearly that if\nyou're given building blocks you can\nreally build something\nso really what i want to do is not\nreally give you answers but give you\nkind of building blocks let you play\naround with them and let you see if\nthings are going better okay that's all\nnice\num so the first thing is that i think\nwe're seeing a lot of what calls in\nwhat what i would call inappropriate\naffect or discongruent affect\nso the display of emotion that you have\nis kind of like\nnot doesn't jive with like what we're\nactually talking about\nreally right so yeah right because\nyou're like smiling a whole lot\nbut like we're not talking about\nanything funnies organ\nnothing happens to me it's funny to me\nyeah so\nlet's think about that right so so and\nthis is what sometimes i think\nis going to make it hard for you to\nconnect\nwith other people maybe yes\nyeah right so like what's funny about\nwhat we're talking about\nlike that's unexpected what's unexpected\nbecause you seem like you're at the\nverge of tears to me\nokay so\n[Music]\ni feel like my unconscious brain comes\nup with predictions that are different\nfrom\nmost people's predictions\nyep and\nthat may be from having a distorted\nworld view\nfrom growing up in a cult or building my\nown\nworld view after leaving\nokay i guess\nso i mean there are unexpected things\nhappen all the time it doesn't make them\nfunny\ni don't know what what what makes\nsomething funny is when the unexpected\nis\nharmless\nokay so here's an alternate hypothesis\nfor you okay\nso sometimes we use humor as a defense\nmechanism\nokay okay this humor might be a defense\nmechanism\nyeah so i i think it is and i i think\nit's it actually is like\nit can make it\nstrange for people to like observe this\nconversation because like\nthere's a lot of inappropriate affect\nright\nand it's so easy to bring out like i\nmean\nif if i didn't know better i thought i'd\nthink that you were like\nlistening to a comedian on stage with\nlike how much you're laughing\nand then the more that we point it out\nthe funnier it becomes\nso as we call attention to things and we\nbring awareness to things it becomes\nfunnier and funnier and funnier\nand generally speaking we're bringing\nemotion out of you but it's weird\nbecause you've got such a\nfat defense mechanism that we just get\nlaughter\nright you can see it like it's just\nbubbling up like you can't even control\nit it's like what\ni'm just saying zory and you're laughing\nright now and you're like\nthat's so funny that's so it's not funny\nbro\nokay and uh so right now\num tears are welling up in my eyes\nyeah so you you does that have any\nmeaning\nwell i mean what kind of tears are they\nthey're not they're not tears of joy\nyeah i feel like\nyeah right so i i it might be suppressed\nemotion it might be\nuh some kind of defense like in\nin order to avoid falling into a crisis\nwhere i just\nyeah yeah so i it's okay bro do you feel\nlike\nwhat you're doing is okay or is there\nsome part of you that you're overcoming\nthat is telling you like this is dumb\nand you should know how to do this\nyou know so if you're saying i may have\nself-esteem issues\nthat's a no no that's not what i'm\ntalking about\nwhat i'm talking about is right now in\nthis moment is there a part of you that\nfeels stupid and another part of you\nthat's telling yourself that you don't\nneed to feel stupid it's completely\nunderstandable\nno there's no such dialogue inside my\nhead okay\nso the the first thing but but when you\nsaid\nit's okay bro i\nalmost felt like i could cry yup that's\nwhy i said it\nright so i think this is where like how\ndo you understand that\nwhy i kind of get emotional\nwhen you say\nthis is you you give a sign that this is\na safe place it's okay\ni don't understand really i don't\nunderstand the relationship between\nthose two things\nsure i'm just gonna cry a little bit on\nmy own if that's okay with you\nsure go ahead so\nwhat what does it mean to you when i say\nit's okay\nit's okay to show the repressed emotions\nthat\nare wrong\nno i don't know yeah i i don't watch you\ni don't know what\nit is it's stupid yeah no it's it's good\nright so i think you're very good at\neducated guesses because they're logical\nand i hate saying wrong because that\ncould make you feel stupid but but i i\ndon't know i i love being told i'm wrong\ni love it it's\nit's okay it's fine okay sorry\nso what i'm trying to do is i'm trying\nto accept you\nokay okay i got you how does it feel to\nbe accepted\ni don't need it there it is\nright why don't you need it\ni haven't thought about that because you\nhave an answer for me real quick there\nno laughter you don't need it\nyeah and that's the sad that's the\nsaddest damn thing\nreally yes absolutely\nbecause you you're someone who's grown\nup without acceptance\nand so you've learned to live and\nfunction\nmy parents loved me unconditionally is\nthat not acceptable\nso that's a logical answer right like\nyou're saying like if parents love you\nunconditionally isn't that acceptance\nso let me toss something else out at you\nand i'm sure you'll swat this aside\nbut like when your parents leave a cult\nat the age of 15\nand [ __ ] leave you in it they don't\ntell you\nand they continue emotionally\nmanipulating you like you\nworked up the courage to leave the cult\nat 18 and they had done it three years\nago\nand they left you behind so\nwhat do you think about that\ni hadn't thought about it that way i'm\ngonna be honest uh\nnot consciously yeah no no\nit feels a little bit depressing what\ndoes that mean\ni don't know so it's gonna take time\nokay so\nhere here's what i'm thinking zorian so\nthe first thing is i think you're doing\nphenomenally well\num i think that it's truly amazing how\nyou've learned to become\nindependent and survive on your own but\ni think it's like really challenging\nright because you don't need anyone's\nacceptance but boy do you want it\nbecause everyone wants it right you\nlearn to live without a basic human need\nand when i start to demonstrate\nsomething to you unconditionally when i\ndon't qualify anything that your\nyour intellect can get around when i\njust say\nit's okay bro yes what is okay i'm not\ntelling you\nwhy is it okay i'm not telling you what\nare we even talking about i'm not\ntelling you\nthere's nothing for your intellect to\nlatch onto with that statement\nwhich is why it sort of sinks deep yes\nyou're right\nright and even the you're right stuff\nlike you got to be careful because\nthat's your intellect being like oh that\nis correct\nnow we understand the equation you're\nlike stepping out of the emotion\nand then when i catch you in the act\nyour other defense mechanism steps in\nand it's like\n[Laughter]\nso do you think my intellect is also a\ndefense mechanism\nabs [ __ ] lutely amazing\nright and it's it's it is for everyone\nand because here's the thing like zorian\nyou've got so much stuff to protect\nagainst on the inside\nbecause let's remember i don't know if\nyou knew this but you were raised in the\ncult that was incredibly\nemotionally manipulative and probably\nquite traumatic\nso there's gonna be a lot down there and\nit's not like it it's a testament to\nyour intellect that your intellect has\ngrown\nso much your ego has grown so much but\nalso makes like let's face it bro\nreally stupid decisions like you're\nsleeping on your floor because you go\nout of your way to help people and i\ndon't doubt that there's a\ncertain kind of logic to that and and\nhopefully you don't feel bad i'm really\ncareful about the word stupid but i'm\ntrying to actually\nreally walk a title up here so if you\ncall me stupid\ni suspect i highly suspect i will not\nfeel bad i think so i think so as well\nin this situation because of the way in\nwhich in any situation\nokay sure if you say so\nyeah so just because you don't feel bad\ndoesn't mean it doesn't hurt\nright so if you're especially if you're\nlexa-thymic\nbut this is where i think you've like\nyou've like like it's it's fascinating\nbecause i\nwhat i see is like you you know i\nimagine someone who's shipwrecked on an\nisland\nand has to like build everything for\nthemselves\nyeah and that's what i see you as i see\nyou as like some guy who\nthrough like ingenuity grit and a lot of\nhard work has constructed\na water wheel in a rain catching thing\nand constructed like\nfish traps and like all these other\nthings to like help you survive\nand at the same time all over again\ni'm not familiar with the reference but\nanyway\nso so so this is where like i also think\nthat there's a lot\nof work that you still have ahead of you\nand some of it is going to be tough\nbecause\nwhat's happening is that you have like\nadaptations on adaptations on\nadaptations\nwhich are fine like they're good they've\nhelped you and things like that\nbut at the same time i think that for\nexample like you're still very angry at\nyour parents\nlike you've forgiven them but i think\nthat like\nlike you're still incredibly angry with\nthem which can be\nhard when they love you so much which\ncan be hard\nwhen you've forgiven them which can be\nhard but like i think it's\nit's tough man and i've noticed yeah\ni think it's understandable so then the\nother thing is that you may not be angry\nat your parents you may just be [ __ ]\npissed at the world\nand now we have to we get into really\ntricky territory because\ni think you've got to learn how to feel\nemotions that don't do anything for you\nbecause a lot of times when i see people\nwho are hyper intellectual\nwhat happens is they're like there's no\nuse to feeling that emotion i can't do\nanything about it\nand if they can't do anything about it\nthey sort of discard it\nthey're like there's no point they bury\nit the thing is the emotion doesn't\nreally like go away just sort of like\nyou know get saved on some remote corner\nof your hard drive where it just like\nkind of lingers\nand we're seeing a lot of things that\nyou know sometimes you have these like\ndrastic emotional\nreactions that you sort of recognize\nthat you have hate within you once again\nreally really awesome you know thing\nthat you figured out it's amazing\nreally i'm i'm really impressed sorry\nwith how far you've come on your own\nand at the same time i still think that\nthere's like a lot of stuff\nlike going you know\nunderneath like i mean you kind of say\nthat your parents are simpletons which\nsort of makes sense\nbut also like they came out of the cult\nwere raised in the cult and emphasized\neducation for you\ni think they had second thoughts about\nthe cult a long time\nyou know like they in the way that you\nwere raised\nthey were looking for an excuse to leave\ni mean i think they realized a long time\ni i think they realized that they didn't\nwant to like raise you\nin the way that they were raised but\nanyway it gets complicated yeah\ndefinitely definitely so they were both\norphans\nyeah so so i'm not quite sure you know\nwhat's going on there but\num you know you know\nthere's just there's just a lot of stuff\nlike going on here zorya like it's\nit's it's hard to describe but some of\nthe inappropriate affects some of the\nhyper intellectualization\nand and i think that you're not i hope\ni'm not making you feel\nkind of like naked or anything like that\nbut but i i think that you know you\nreally do have because it's it's kind of\nweird like i think whatever logical\nsystem you're using to that whines you\nsleeping up on the floor\nout of altruism may make sense but it\nfeels to me like\nthere's a blind spot somewhere in there\nand i think basically the blind spot\nis is is like some amount of these like\nemotions which\ni don't doubt that you've genuinely\nforgiven your parents but like i also\nthink there's just like a roiling\nmassive emotion like somewhere in there\nand and just yeah\nso don't you think if after four years\nof being\nextremely angry inventing at the world\nand\nuh like all the negative emotions\ncome out and eventually dissipate\nyes and no so this is where you know the\nwe haven't even gotten to what the\npsychological impact is and and\npotentially what you\nare dealing with now but so i think that\nlike i kind of think about them as like\nlittle spawning machines\nthat will generate thoughts so there's\nlike a portal that like you know\nthoughts are coming out of\nand you can vent the individual thought\nbut the portal can still be down there\nand and i think that you've done some of\nthe process of digesting that but just\nthe the degree of your inappropriate\naffect suggests to me that there's some\nkind of negative emotion\nthat is under there um\ni see what i see what you mean right\nyeah i said it you got it so\nand and it's just like because it you\nknow sure\nyou can logically say that things are\nunexpected and that's why they're funny\nbut like\nyou know all kinds of unexpected stuff\nhappens that isn't harmful\nbut we don't i mean maybe the other\noption other thing on the\ndifferential diagnosis here is that\nmaybe you're enlightened because\nsometimes enlightened people will laugh\nat all manner of things\num oh [ __ ] see that's a genuine laugh\nright like that's actually funny\ni can see it in your eyes this time um\nwhat what do you think about all this\n[Music]\noh i just realized so the other thing is\nthat have you forgiven yourself\ni'm very bad at forgiving myself yeah so\nthis is\nmaybe this is the piece that i was\nmissing is that like we talked about\nforgiving your parents and you may not\nhave anger towards themselves but if we\nlook at this sort of like\nyou know your inability to forgive\nyourself and like how frankly how stupid\nyou feel\nlike i know that you don't consciously\nown that you feel stupid but we can\ndefinitely detect a theme\nof self-blame yes so when i make a\nmistake\nuh i feel self-loathing\nright so but\nhow do you understand that so it's a\ncertain kind of mistake it's a\nirreversible mistake something that\ncosts me an opportunity\nand\n[Music]\nokay so i tend to go into\ni'm not sure if i'm answering your\nquestion but i tend to go into swearing\nfits\nto suppress blaming uh feeling bad about\nthings that like mistakes i've done\nso okay there's i don't know if it was\nthe\nanswer to my question but boy do i like\nit more than anything else that you\ncould have said\nokay so so i think there's a lot there\nright so you say you go into swearing\nfits what are you swearing at\nmyself okay so like\nlike this is where like uh and this is\nno this is gonna sound weird but like\nthe way that you feel about yourself\nwhen did you start to feel that way\nabout yourself\nthe way i feel about myself what's the\nway i feel about myself\nlet me just jump to it so you know i\nthink you left the cult but the cult\ndidn't leave you\nright what i'm hearing here is that like\nlike the way that when they talk to you\nabout\nyour doing your chores and things like\nthat and like god is watching and like\nyou know it's not okay and like you're\nnot worthy and or maybe you guys were\nchosen ones\nand it's it's sort of like i i could i\ncould connect those two dots\nthat once again is a hypothesis for you\nthat like you know the self-loathing\nbecause when i think about when you talk\nabout emotional manipulation and\nguilting and stuff like that like i\nthink you've\ncarried it with you yes so\nso i'm gonna just keep going\nsome of the cult stuff is so [ __ ]\npainful that i've avoided talking about\nit for 10 years\nokay i just i just tried to forget and i\npush it into the corner\nof my mind that i i like i put it on\ntheir locking key and i do not talk\nabout it\nhow do you feel about yourself for doing\nthat\ni i have no ability to answer that\nquestion do you feel weak\nasking that question to a person with\nalexa time is a little bit\nit's okay i i have no ability to\nidentify if i feel weak\ndo you feel stupid when you say does it\nfeel stupid\nyeah is it\nan okay answer to say it rings a bell\nsure\nzorian any answer is an okay answer\nso here's what i would say you set it\naside because it's so painful i\ncompletely understand i mean i don't\ncomplete i really don't understand at\nall to be honest\nbut here's what i would say it's okay\nbro\nwhatsoever you do with it it's okay\neverything that you've accomplished is\nfantastic\nand the fact that you haven't\naccomplished things is also fine\nyou've missed out on opportunities\nyou've made irreversible mistakes\nit's okay bro you're allowed to make\nmistakes\ni'm not\ni'm not allowed to make mistakes\nwhy not there's the smile again\neven if you don't allow yourself to make\nmistakes i'll allow you to make mistakes\nokay so mistakes\ncost time that's how i see it\nsure and i don't have enough time some\nof my time has been\nstolen i suppose so yes the remainder of\nthe time that's left\nis more valuable when you put it into\nthat perspective\nyou can put it into that perspective all\nyou want to it's not one that i'm going\nto adopt\nokay but irrespective of how logically\ncorrect it is\nright and this is where like like zorin\nwhat you really\nlearn gotta learn how to do and it's\ngonna be really hard because it goes\nagainst\neverything because you're trying to make\nup for lost time\nyou're trying to fix the past if you can\nmaximize the time that you have left at\nthe end of the day the scales will be\neven\nbut here's the crazy thing like you\ncan't ever make up for what's happened\nin the past\nyes i can only compensate no the same\n[ __ ] thing it's a synonym\nokay fine right so that's that's what\nyou need to let go of and it's hard to\nadmit that like you got screwed bro\nand that that maybe you blame yourself\nfor it maybe you blame your parents for\nit maybe you blame the universe maybe\nyou blame god whatever\nbecause god's off the table because\nyou're an atheist and you've learned to\nforgive your parents\nso who's left where does the\nresponsibility lie\nand now we see where the self-loathing\ncomes from\nright because it's kind of strange like\nthis is a really interesting\nlike issue that kids have is before kids\ndevelop theory of mind which is the sort\nof\nunderstanding that other human beings\nexist they feel like they are in a\nsingle\nplayer game yep and so like all of that\nfault is yours and what i'm seeing from\nyou time and time and time again\nis like harsh harsh\nlack of acceptance towards yourself\ni mean we we knew that before you told\nus that you swear\nto keep feelings at bay okay\nright and so like then you tell us like\nan hour into the conversation that i\nswear at myself\nand i beat myself up and it's like yeah\nokay i think we saw that coming\nand and so this is where it's it's going\nto be really challenging\nzorian because i think and and this is\nwhere\nyou know i'm going to toss something out\nlike i think you've got to let those\nfeelings out\nand and this is the really challenging\neven harder than that i think you can\nlet the feelings out\nproblem is that i don't think you can do\nit with someone\ni don't know if you can tolerate showing\nthe ugliest\nand worst parts of yourself to another\nhuman being\nand the hardest part about that because\ni just did it just a tiny bit\nis like them accepting you for being\nall that loathing that you feel towards\nyourself\nuncovering it is the first hardest thing\nuncovering it with someone else is the\nsecond hardest thing\nokay and then even then you've got an\neasy out go ahead\nyou're right i i do not feel accepted\nyeah i feel like i need to be accepted\nbut i'm too afraid\nto show the part of myself and\nbecause there's a fear of rejection nope\nit's not a fear of rejection what is it\nthen it's a fear of acceptance\nmy friend really i think so how\nbecause if they reject you is that new\nno it's not can you survive that\nrejection\nyes absolutely because you [ __ ] do it\nto yourself\nevery single day okay okay what you fear\nis acceptance what you're terrified of\nwhat gets you going\nis not me telling you that you're stupid\nas you've told us when you say you're\nstupid when i if i call you stupid\nyou're like\ndoesn't touch me it's when i say it's\nokay bro that you're like [ __ ]\nyou're right okay okay you're right\nabuse zorian you grew up in a cult\nyour abuse resistance is 100\noh i see\n[Music]\nit's unconditional love it's acceptance\nit's admitting that you don't need to\nchange\nthat it's okay to let go of your\nopportunities that you don't need to be\nperfect\nyes all of those things that you're\nsaying right now those make me feel like\ni want to cry\nhow do you feel about that\ni feel good about it i'm happy for you\nzorian because it's like it's a painful\njourney but it's a good one\nand it's worth the opportunity cost\ni don't i feel like it's not even a\nworthwhile question to ask how do i get\nuh how do i overcome this barrier\ngood great question why isn't that a\nworthwhile question\nsounds stupid there it is you see it\nalways lurking every step forward that\nyou try to take the question that you\nneed to ask the important question\nthere's your mind\nit's stupid don't do it zorian it's a\ndumb question\nso how do you move forward it's the most\nimportant question to ask\nso and and then then we get into a\nreally tricky thing because if i say\nit's the most important question to ask\nmaybe then you feel stupid for like\nhesitating to ask it so it's a dumb\nquestion because\nit should have a i suspect the answer is\npretty obvious right and there there it\nis again\nokay so now like hopefully like twitch\nchat is following at this point maybe\nyou're following\nbecause like do you see how no matter\nhow we cut this problem\nthe conclusion is like it's a dumb\nquestion to ask because it's obvious and\nif it's obvious then you are\nan idiot there it is like like it's it's\na thing like your your logic\nis falling underneath this\nlike emotional or like some scott or\nlike the like\nyou see like it doesn't matter how you\ncut this pie like the conclusion is\nalways gonna be like zorian's an idiot\nright and if i say that to you it\ndoesn't bother you at all because you\ntell yourself all the time like what\ndifference does it make if like another\nperson tells you you're an idiot because\nyou tell yourself all the time no big\ndeal yes\ni'm a big son i don't think you're a big\nidiot\nmatter if it's true huh does it matter\nwhat you think\nif it's true\nthat's it doesn't matter what you think\nif i know it's true maybe\nexactly right so so there it is again\nlike you're discounting what i say\nyou're like swatting it away like\nbecause where so what's the conclusion\nfrom that statement\nwhen i say i don't think you're an idiot\nyou're like\nthat's not true he doesn't know what\nhe's talking about\nand the conclusion is that you are an\nidiot there it is we can play this game\nas many rounds as you want to go we're\nalways going to end up in the same damn\nplace\nwhich in turn can make you feel even\nstupider so it's like\nit's just not productive like well\nthere's a certain amount of\nproductivity there so what what do you\ndo about it that's a good question\nokay okay so it's like even if i call\nyou smart you think you're stupid and\neven if i call you stupid you think\nyou're\nit's like you just can't win and that\ndoesn't make you stupid it's just that's\nthe that's the emotional thing that\nyou've worked so hard to bury\nthat it's like there and it's like\nclogging up your heart you're like this\nhidden folder\non your hard drive that's clogging it up\nbut like you it's hidden so you don't\nsee it\nbut it's action is always going to be\nthere so the first thing you've got to\ndo is\nawareness so i think zory this is\nsomething that you're gifted at the more\nthat you're able to notice this pattern\nin your mind\nthe more it starts to dissolve yes\nthat awareness will start the process of\nemotional digestion\nsecond thing is that you say you haven't\ntalked to anyone you haven't told anyone\nso like\nthat's a good place to start right so\nthis is where you know i'd highly\nrecommend\nso sometimes i talk about our coaching\nprogram but this is definitely a case\nwhere i would recommend you see a real\ntherapist\nright like like like go and and i it\nsounds like your financial situation\nisn't maybe the best right now so i\ndon't know exactly what resources are\navailable to you\nbut i i think that you know this is\ndefinitely something where i would go\nand\nand talk to someone right because i\nthink that\nyou were conditioned to loathe yourself\nthat's what cults do yes you're right\nand so it's interesting but to learn\nhow to love yourself is like\ndifficult like conditioning it doesn't\nmatter\nlike all conditioning is conditioning\nthat we can condition you to load\nyourself\nwe can condition you to love yourself\nand sometimes like what you need from\npeople\nlike because people are going to show\nyou right like i'm going to make these\nweird statements\nwhich aren't logical like it's okay\nbro like good job zorian and you're like\ngood job at what\nand i'm like everything anything i don't\nknow\nall of it like it's those things like\nlike\nsomeone's gonna have to show you and\nsometimes people are lucky enough to\nfind this in a romantic relationship\nalthough i wouldn't recommend it\nyou know it's like a roll of a dice kind\nof thing\nthat you know like you need to be sure\nlike taught how to accept yourself\nand it's going to be these little\nmoments where like you're learning your\nbrain your neurons are rewiring right\nnow as these emotions come up as you\nstart crying and things like that like\nthere's rewiring going on in your brain\nas we speak\nso you just need to continue doing that\nrewiring\nand then like one day you're gonna wake\nup and like you're gonna when you make a\nmistake\nlike there's gonna be like another\ndialogue that pops in\nup in your head which is like man that\nwas kind of stupid\nbut it's okay i'm never gonna argue with\nyou\nabout whether it's stupid or not stupid\nthat's an argument that i can never win\nso the current way i avoid\nor get over beating myself up\nis whenever i catch that feeling\nwhenever i start to insult myself\ni replace it with\ni what i like i write down what i\nlearned from that experience\nnope incorrect okay\nyou don't want to replace it that's the\nvery opposite of acceptance\nyou see that if we're replacing it\nyou're not accepting it it's\nsubtle really tricky so when it happens\nbut i never load myself again after i do\nthat\nso why does happen no no so so this is\nwhen you load yourself\nyou should accept yourself for loathing\nyourself\nokay right don't just get stuck at the\nloading layer notice that\nhey this is me like beating myself up\nagain and like\nit's something that i'm gonna work on\nbut it's okay it's okay for me to feel\nthis way\nokay oh because when you load yeah\nlet me just finish this point when you\nload yourself it's the opposite of\nacceptance\nyes right so like if even if we it's\nsubtle really subtle\nif we replace the loathing what we're\ndoing is still not accepting ourselves\nso just unconditionally like\naccept whatever you are right i'm not\nsaying that you aren't stupid what i'm\nsaying is that it's okay\nit's okay it's okay it's okay\nokay so what's the point of this\nwhy should i accept this\nwhat are the benefits let me think about\nthat question for a second\nlike is this the path to enlightenment\nthis question feels like a trap to me\nno it's not but oh i think it may be\nhold on\nokay i'm trying to decide if i'm reading\ntoo much into this\nwhen you say what's the point of this\nyes\nokay i'm gonna just answer so i think\nthe point is because like\ni don't think you have to live this way\nanymore i don't want you to live this\nway anymore i think it's it's incredibly\nsad and devastating\nthat you've been living this way this\nlong\nokay okay\nyou okay that's okay\ni could use a little bit of reassurance\nit's okay let me yeah\nwhat i'm thinking about that\nzorin i kind of feel like we are at\ni want you to really like sort of sit\nwith how far we've gotten\ni'm a little bit concerned because that\nthat other the next the last question\nyou asked i think is like opening up a\nnew thing do\nso i'm sort of feeling like this is a\ngood place to stop\nat least from my exploration now if you\nhave questions i'm more than happy to\nanswer them but like\ni think how far we've come is actually\nlike a like i want you to sort of\nnot go any farther than this because i\nthink this is the thing\nokay does that make sense no\nokay so like i think that there are\nfurther conversations that need to be\nhad\nbut this piece you need to work on first\ni think okay and i don't think any\namount of other\nintellectual understanding is going to\nlike really\nimprove anything okay\ndoes this would you say a good\nstep in the right would say it's step in\nthe right direction\nif i get rid of my\nintellectual ego sort of\nbecause i think once again getting rid\nof replacing\nis not what we want to do so your\nintellectual ego\nwill subside when it no longer needs to\nbe there\nso it's not about getting rid of the\nintellectual ego it's about no longer\nneeding it to protect you\nright so so right now your intellectual\nego is like the tool that you fashioned\nthat allows you to like start to put\nyour life back together so i'd say don't\nget rid of it\nit's there for a reason okay but\nthat ego comes at the cost of like\nburying all this stuff and this weird\nself-loathing that you have left over\nand you can work intellectually with\nyour ego as long as you want to i\nsuspect i mean maybe you can overcome it\ni guess\ntechnically you can but i'd say that\nthey're easier\nnot easier faster ways that may be\na little bit it's going to be\nuncomfortable for you because like you\nhave you fashioned such a brilliant and\ncapable intellectual ego that letting it\ngo and\nand like entering a territory where it\ncan't do its job it can be very scary\nbut i think ultimately that's what you\nneed is like\nemotional healing\nokay\nany other questions is getting rid of my\nfear\nof irreversibility\na path to accepting myself\nsame problem getting rid replacing\nright wait is replacing a better word\nnope they're all the same word they're\nall synonymous\nright so so like like the thing is like\ni don't think you need to get rid of\nyour fear\nthis is the whole problem is that like\nyou're always rejecting parts of\nyourself\nwell yeah because i need to improve no\nyou don't\nthat's what needs to change it's okay\nbro\nthat is deeply unsettling yep\nit feels wrong yep\nshould i should i navigate to a place\nwhere it feels right\nnope to accept\nwho i am right now and just not want to\nmove any\nmore yep\nis that the destination you're there's\nno destination you're already there\n[Music]\nwhat do you mean you're you're great\njust the way that you are you don't need\nto do a damn things orient\nokay so you're saying there is not a\ntool i can fashion\n[Music]\njust sit with your [ __ ] emotions\nclose your eyes you feel deeply\nunsettled don't go anywhere\njust sit with that feeling of being\nunsettled\nyou don't already okay\nso it's so like what all you need to do\nis just sit with it you don't need to do\nyou need to go anywhere you don't need\nto change it\nyou're great it's not a good idea to\nlike make it surface\nand then sit with it\nsure you can make it surface and sit\nwith it\nbut okay we sort of did that just now\nand i think there's a certain amount of\ntolerance you have which will build up\nover time\nso this is why like i think you should\nsee a therapist right because the\ntherapy is\ndifferent huh maybe my friends will help\nme\nyeah so i think this is where like they\ncan teach you how to learn how to sit\nwith yourself that's all you need to do\nyou can't fix that which isn't broken\ninteresting so i i think what's broken\nis that this is very meta\nwhat's broken is\ni don't recognize that i don't\nneed to be fixed\nsomething that's preventing me from\nrealizing that\nyeah that's that's also that's gonna go\nlike add infant item\nbecause that in and of itself is what's\nlike you're just i'm\ni'm starting with the presumption now\nwe're getting intellectual that you're\nnot broken\nand you're like what's broken is that i\ncan't recognize i'm broken and there we\nare again\nlike you can play this game like you can\nrun circles around me zorin\nit feels true yep yep absolutely right\nso like\nlook who isn't alexa thymic anymore it\nfeels true\nabsolutely because it's a feeling\nyou start with the the conclusion\nthe emotional conclusion that you are\nbusted in some fundamental way\nand so as long as that is there like no\nmatter how much logic you use you're\ngoing to wind up in the same damn place\nso it's like an emotional thing that\nneeds to happen so i'm gonna leave you\nwith a different kind of meditation\npractice\nif that's okay\nis it okay if i give you a meditation\npractice and we wrap up or do you have\nother questions\nno i'm fine with it let's let's do it\nlet's do the meditation\nokay i want to give you a colon\nbecause i think that'll a koan is like\none of these paradoxes\num but i have to try to think about i'm\njust trying to think about a good koan\nso it's like something that meditators\nuse to try to break themselves\nout of this intellectual cycle because\nyour intellect will like so it's\nsomething that fundamentally doesn't\nmake sense\num\nokay but it doesn't make sense no\nthere's no trick to it the point is that\nyou have to abandon all tricks\nso this is what i want you to do i want\nyou to watch\na rock grow\nokay i can do that okay just watch your\nrock grow\nsounds like fun okay good that's the\npoint\nokay well that's sort of what i've got\nfor you\nzorian i didn't mean to hopefully i\nwasn't too abrupt with how we ended\nthings but i really think it's going to\nget repetitive and you're actually\nmoving\nfurther away from like where you need to\nbe with the more questions that you ask\nand maybe that makes sense maybe it\ndoesn't but you're\nnow we re-engage your intellectual mind\nand all your questions are like i think\nwe like\nwe had a couple of wins in there when\nyou were like this feels deeply\nuncomfortable like good\nthat's what we want right like this\nfeels wrong\nthis feel like so like you're becoming\nless lexa-thymic over the course of the\nconversation which is really good\nso now you need to kind of like practice\nsome of those skills go see a therapist\nand watch\nwatch your rock grow i'm serious like\nsit down and just watch it grow\nand then pay attention to all the things\nthat your mind does at first it's like\noh look like\nit's this is going to be the trick that\nteaches me things and then that's going\nto be there for a little while\nthen you're going to be like actually\nthis is stupid i'm not the trick isn't\nworking\nand then your mind is going to tell you\nto stop and then\nyou're going to be like no no if i\ncontinue then i'll discover the trick\ni'll discover the trick of it\nand then you're gonna be frustrated\nagain you're like there's no stupid\ntrick\nthere's no it's dumb\nand then like if you continue with it\nthen hopefully you'll figure it out\nbut there's no trick and as long as you\nthink is that there's a trick you won't\nfind it\nright so you're telling me that if i sit\nlong enough with this eventually i'll\nget used to it\nnope i don't know what's gonna happen\ni'm telling you it's a waste of time and\nyou should do it anyway\ni like that okay right\nokay good luck to you zorian and thank\nyou very much for coming\ni hate the fact that it's ending so soon\nbut yeah\ni understand it can feel unsatisfying\nbut this this is it i hope you don't\nview this as an\nend i really think like this is an\nimportant beginning\nand we're not i'm i'm happy\nin a weird way that you feel a little\nbit hungry because like that means that\nthis was good for you and so like\ni encourage you to go eat again like\nfind a therapist seriously\nokay take care man see you emma i love\nyou\nlove you too\nall right chat"
