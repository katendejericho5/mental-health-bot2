    "transcript": "hello hello\num sorry i'm a little nervous\nyep so you're like what else\nyeah so how do you deal with on\nironically being dead inside\ndue to a long time of suppressing\nemotions\nuh so how how do you manage having\nsuppressed emotions for a very long time\nyeah and i feel kind of dead inside like\ni do i don't even feel alive\ni can't even feel any emotions\ndo you feel any emotions like\nlet's say i'm playing a game and and\nsometimes i can get\nfrustrated and things like that but not\nlike\ni don't know i don't know how to explain\nit i just\ni i don't know take your time\num i can feel like\num the\nedge of an emotion if that makes sense\nlike\ni can't feel like hate or love\nor like happy or maybe sometimes sadness\nbut it's like\nit's not like\nsorry yeah no i i think you're doing\ngreat and what what am i calling you\nfriend\nyou can call me rkm or my name is raven\nif you can't pronounce that sure yeah so\nravi i think um so what i'm hearing you\nsay is that you kind of\nfeel the edge of emotion but you don't\nreally feel emotions\nexactly yeah okay so i think you did a\nvery good job of explaining what do you\nthink\ni don't think so okay fair enough\nso i understood what you were trying to\nsay right yeah\nokay anyway so so rabbit how long have\nyou felt\ndead inside like\nuh i was depressed when i was like\n13 or 14 around that age\nand probably ever since that and\nhow old are you now i'm 19 20\n20. have you had treatment for\ndepression\nno\nokay would you say that between like 13\nand now\nyou've had you felt about the same level\nof debt inside\nare there periods of time where you feel\nlike better for a little while and then\nyou go back to feeling dead inside\num\n[Music]\nprobably that i feel better sometimes\nokay and um can you help me understand a\nlittle bit about\nuh why you haven't gotten treatment for\ndepression\nwell i went to a psychologist once and\nthey didn't really understand me\nso so they just said like\nyou don't have depression like go home\nor something i don't know\nso did they did they offer to see you\nagain\nor they said i'm not going to see you\nbecause you don't need to be here\nit was kind of like an appointment to\nassess\nif i have depression or not that person\ndidn't think i had it\ni see so who was gonna add to that and\nand how long ago did you see this person\num it was kind of it was when i was like\n15.\nokay so here's my first thought\nrobin okay so you may have depression\nand if you have depression there are\ntreatments for depression\nand i think it's worth seeing someone\nagain\nright because i have depression actually\nwhat do you think you have\ni don't know what i have i don't feel\nanything\nsure so so i think that's fair you may\nhave depression you may not have\ndepression you may think you don't have\ndepression\ni completely agree i don't know if you\nhave depression or you don't have\ndepression\nwhat i'm saying is that when we think\nabout fixing a problem like this\nthere's a chance you have depression and\nso the right thing to do\nis to at least we need to know whether\nyou do or you don't\nright does that make sense\nyeah so i'm not saying that this is the\nend of my recommendation\nbut i think a useful piece of this\npuzzle\nis going to be getting evaluated by a\nmental health professional\nand the story that when you were 15 and\nthe story when you're 19 are different\nstories\ndoes that make sense like if you're a 15\nyear old and you go see a psychologist\nonce and they ask you about your\nfeelings and stuff\nlike at 15 you don't even know what you\nfeel and you've been feeling this way\nmaybe for about a year right but you\ndon't even know how to articulate\nlike you don't know how to say what you\nfeel when you're 15 years old\nthat's a very different story from when\ni turned 13 or 14 i started feeling\ndepressed and i haven't really felt\nemotions for the last six years\nit's a completely different story\nyeah and so just because someone\nmet you once and didn't think you were\ndepressed when you were 15\ndoesn't mean that that person was\ncorrect or even that\neven if they were correct in that day\nthe story back then and the story now is\nlike very different does that make sense\nyeah i get time to get that right so\nthat's a really important like\nclinical piece to understand is that if\nyou guys have been evaluated for\nsomething\nat some random time in the past and you\nguys like\ngot even like it's not even it may have\nbeen possible that\nsomeone diagnosed you with depression\nand now you don't have depression like\nit\nthere are all kinds of mistakes that can\nbe made in the diagnostic process\nand ravid i think you should get an\nevaluation i'm not going to end there\ni'm going to talk to you about i think\nthe more the answer that you're looking\nfor\nbut i think this is the kind of thing\nwhere like i would feel stupid if i like\nwe just talked about feelings and\nmeditation and things like that\nand you actually like had clinical\ndepression and like you just didn't get\ntreatment for it because that would be\nlike that would be dumb\ndoes that make sense like we're going to\ndo the dr k like\nunderstand yourself and like learn how\nto feel your emotions\nwe're gonna do all that i'm gonna give\nyou all that but like at the end of the\nday\nit's important to be like very like\ncareful\nand treat yourself with the respect that\nyou deserve\nwhich is giving yourself every\nopportunity to like get better\nand overcome this problem and one of\nthose\none of those instruments or one of those\ntools you can use is a clinical\nevaluation\nfor some kind of depression does that\nmake sense\nyes okay on to the dr k stuff okay\nso so it sounds to me like you're alexa\nthymic\nhave you heard us talk okay\nso what's your understanding of how we\napproach alexa thymia\ni don't know how you approach it but i\nknow what it is\nyou you do know what it is yes\nand what what's your understanding of\nwhat alexa thyme is\nyou can't really explain how you feel\ni guess yep yeah so i i would describe\nalexa thymia\nis like being unable to\nfeel like understand or feel\nemotions so it's like you can't describe\nhow you feel it's sort of like you're\ncolorblind to emotions\nand so lexithymia like do you play a lot\nof video games robin\nyeah for sure how how many hours a day\nwould you say you play\nwell maybe five okay\nand how do you spend the rest of your\nday\nuh youtube twitch\ndr k wasting time you know\nyeah so i think this is the kind of\nthing where like you literally like if\nyou play games and are like consuming\nyoutube\nyou know for most of your day those\nthose things are going to suppress your\nemotional circuitry\nin your brain so there are these things\ncalled\nfmri studies so f stands for functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging which is a\nstudy that looks at blood flow\nto the brain and what we discover from\nfmri studies\nis that when you play video games and do\nthis kind of mindless stuff like watch\nyoutube and things like that\nwhat they do is they actually reduce the\nblood flow to the parts of your brain\nthat experience emotion\nand so you're kind of like you get you\nactivate this like dopamine circuitry\nand shut down your emotional circuitry\nwhich is why games feel so good and that\nwe use them as a coping mechanism\nanything that we use as a coping\nmechanism reduces\nour negative like our ability to\nexperience\nnegative emotions so like earlier today\ni had something stressful happen\nand like i pulled up valheim for like 15\nor 20 minutes\nand it made me feel better because like\nyou kind of forget and then like all\nthose negative emotions like\ngo away for a little bit and so i think\nthis is where we've got to really\napproach this\nkind of in a from a couple of different\nangles one is that\nas long as you're basically like playing\ngames at this\nrate it's going to be difficult for you\nto feel emotions because you're going to\nbe shutting off\nyou're going to be reducing blood flow\nto the part of your brain that like can\nexperience emotion\nand and so you know this is where we've\ngot to think a little bit about how you\ncan do\nother stuff so the next thing is that\nthat any questions about that i mean i\nthat's kind of complicated but i was\ngoing to lay out two or three other\nthings\ni wanted to add that like\ni think i also use like\norgasm to do the same thing yep yeah so\npeople do that right so\nif you look if you look at people like\nwe have we've had a couple of porn\naddiction streams\nwhich you should check out on on youtube\nbut like so\nso orgasm and like pornography and\nthings like that are also other ways to\nlike\nsuppress emotions yeah\nand so you know robin you've got a\ncouple of other options going forward\nthe first\nis that if you want to get in touch with\nyour emotions\nlike you have to cut back on some of\nthese things if you can't cut back on\nthose\nthat's okay there are other things you\ncan do so the next is that like\nyou can intentionally activate that\nemotional circuitry\nso this is what things like therapy or\nwe do this in coaching too\nwhere like our coaches work a lot with\npeople with a lexithymia because like\nyour coaches will and what they're gonna\ntell you is that like you can\naccess your emotions through your body\ntoo\nso especially for men who are lexa\nthymic\ni would say that even if you can't feel\nthe emotion\nyou may feel stuff like in your body\nlike does that make sense to you\nyes yes what do you feel in your body\nright now like\nthat could be an emotion um\ni have to think right\nlet me ask you this what do you feel in\nyour body when you go to bed at night\num warmth\nwhat warm warmth\nokay do you feel safe\nyes relaxed okay so you do feel relaxed\nlike\nhow do you feel when you wake up in the\nmorning\ntired\ni don't know i can't really put myself\nokay so so this is where like you know\nwhen you feel the edge of an emotion\nbecause you say you feel the edge of\nthem right when you feel that edge of\nemotion\ndo you notice that you feel particular\nthings in your body at the same time\ni don't really notice it okay so that's\nsomething that you've got to pay\nattention to so like the next time that\nyou feel at the edge of an emotion\ni want you to pay attention to your body\nand see if something is different in\nyour body\nyou may feel something like in your\nstomach\nyou may feel something in your throat\nyou may feel something in your chest\nyou may feel like tension in your back\nand that's gonna be\nyour like avenue into the emotion\nyeah um that's something you can kind of\ndo\non your own but this is also something\nthat like if you work\nyou know with a trained professional it\ncan help so i think\nthis second thing a couple of other\nthings about alexa thymia is that like\nyou know when you do like coaching and\ntherapy like what's gonna happen is that\nthey're gonna be asking questions that\nare gonna be bringing the emotion\nup and so like during those times like\nthe blood flow to your emotional centers\nof the brain is gonna be higher\nand as you wake those parts up as you\nlearn how to feel those emotions\nthen it's gonna be like you're gonna\nstart to get the whole\nrange of them and so like i sort of\nexperienced this when i had kids because\nmy emotional circuitry like got more\nactive\nand so then what happened is i started\nlike crying and stuff like all the time\nlike i didn't used to cry but now i like\ncry all the time on stream\nand so what i found is that i could feel\nlove more intensely\nand i could also feel like sadness more\nintensely and i'm not recommending that\nyou go out and have a child to fix this\nproblem but\nyou know like my point is that\nessentially like if we look at our alexa\nthymia\nwhat happens is if we turn up the volume\non\nour emotions we turn up the volume on\nall of our emotions\nand so then the next question is what\nare the emotions that you're trying to\navoid\nyeah what do you think\num loneliness but that's not emotion but\nsure it is it is\nsure\nwell that i guess right so like this is\nwhere so now with what's happening\nrobin is that you're feeling lonely\nand then you do certain things to push\nthe loneliness away\nyeah yeah i know right and so as long as\nthat\ncycle is going on you're not going to\nfeel much\nbecause you're actually trying to not\nfeel\nyeah but i'm kind of like addicted\nso i can't stop you're damn right you're\naddicted\nso how do you get unaddicted right so\nthat's where like you've got to start by\nfacing that loneliness because as long\nas long as you're afraid as long as the\nloneliness controls you\nand as long as you can't feel lonely\nyou're gonna be\naddicted to this stuff and the more that\nbecause because think about this why are\nyou addicted to it it's because you\ncan't\nsit with being lonely\nlike it hurts so much to be lonely\nyou're like i can't feel that\ni'm not gonna do it\nand as long as you can't sit with the\nloneliness then\nyou're gonna keep doing the thing\nbecause that's your that's the way that\nyou\nmake the loneliness go away so of course\nyou're addicted\nwhether it's orgasms masturbation video\ngames netflix youtube whatever\nit's all to run away from the loneliness\nand if you want all of that stuff to\ncome crashing down\nyou have to sit with the loneliness\nlearn to be with the loneliness\nif you can do that then you don't need\nto play video games five hours a day\ni also want to add like i will i'm\ntrying to become like a pro player\nso it's hard to stop\ngaming because of that also\nokay i mean i i think that if you want\nto be a successful\npro player you're going to have to deal\nwith the loneliness\nhow do i deal with the loneliness go see\na therapist\nor you could do coaching too but i'd\nreally recommend therapy and\na clinical evaluation i can't really i\ncan't really afford\ntherapy\nokay that's a tricky thing what country\nare you in\nsweden i thought it was free for you\nguys\nit is i think so i think until you're\n20 it is\ni would definitely check into that\nyou think it's not true or\nwhat do you mean trick interest i i\nwould i would investigate\nwhether you actually have to pay for it\nor if there's some way you can get it\nfor free\nall right i would and and there are\nusually like\neven people who will in any country oh i\ndon't know about any country\nbut generally speaking in north america\nand in europe\nthere are organizations that will offer\ntherapy for free\nso you just have to find one of those\norganizations i'm not\ntoo sure but i think that there are\nlike organizations you can check out\nrise above the disorder\nwhich is a good organization i think\nit's based in the united states i don't\nknow if they do things in europe but\ni thought i thought sweden had\nsocialized medicine\ni mean maybe they do i'm not i'm not\nsaying i'm just saying what i think\nyeah so i would investigate that\nbecause i i think the problem that\nyou're gonna face in the swedish\nhealthcare system\nis that you're gonna have to wait a long\ntime to find a therapist\nbut it i think it should be free for you\nalso i think you have mentioned like\nwhen you meditate and you get like a no\nmind state that's when the emotional\nemotions are like come up because you're\nnot suppressing them anymore\nbut i haven't really been successful\nin getting there okay\nso that's that's perfectly fine so i\nwould continue\npracticing meditation and this is where\nyou may be able to find like a local\ngroup\nthat you can join to like you know help\nyou meditate on a regular basis\nand and you know if you haven't entered\nif you haven't entered a no mind state\nthat's totally fine"
