    "transcript": "oh oh man\ni'm a little bit nervous no um\nit's a really normal feeling yeah\nso so yeah i wanted to ask a question\nrelated to um\nto a recent social situation i lived\nuh and i think i think it's kind of\nuh correlated with my dharma but\nwe're gonna get to that i guess so\nso so yeah every time i screw up\nit takes me a long time to wake up even\nthough\ni can live in the moment at times\ni tend to remember what i did to to the\nperson i'm looking at if they're close\num because i want forgiveness and i have\nto change myself so it doesn't happen\num i have to find myself in\nin a situation where i want to talk to\nthe person in person\nabout that but but i have i have a hard\ntime doing so\nbecause i see it inappropriate when when\nthe other person\nhas already moved on after the issue was\ntaken care of\non the phone to the chat or voice\nmessages\num while being\nstressful situations i tend to analyze\nevery detail\nwhat i think was done right and wrong i\ndid it all the time\nand and when i think i find problems\nproblems i want to solve solve them as\nsoon as possible so\nso my mind is not filled with them when\ni'm alone\nuh then dancing\nuh producing music doing things with\nfriends\nmeditate sometimes and and in this case\nworking\nwith a friend of mine in a project we\nhave hopes of\nfor it succeeding sometimes it helps but\nit's even cathartic but it's not enough\nbecause\nthen because i returned to the\nto the to the process of of analysis\nokay so let me let me ask you a question\nso it sounds to me like\nyou spend a lot of time going over\nmistakes that you think you made in your\nhead\nwhen it relates to interacting with\nother people\nyes okay yes so\nlet me ask can you just tell us like an\nexample of like a mistake that you made\nwith someone and what kind of thoughts\nyou were having\nyeah yesterday um a friend of mine i\nmean\num her father went to the hospital and\nand i started to\nto ask to ask to ask if uh\nhow how was she feeling like uh\nhow to how how she was dealing with it\nlike\nin a moment that it was inappropriate\nfor her and and i didn't know it until\nuh until last night when\nwhen another friend of flowers told me\nhey man\nyou went too far like um she she didn't\nlike\nat all the\nthat you tried that you tried to um\nto to search for\nhow she was filmed and\nand can you walk me through the\nconversation that you had with her\n[Music]\nwith a friend who told me that i screwed\nup\nthe the the the the conversation you had\nwith the original person about the\nhospital and how they were handling it\noh yeah um when she was at a hospital i\nasked her\num\ni mean how many times like what what\nlike how many questions did you ask her\nthat i can remember just one like uh how\nhow are you feeling uh\nand you thought that that was asking too\nmuch\nno not at all i wanted to to support her\nand so and so it sounds like your friend\nthought that what you said was\ninappropriate\num yep and\ndo you agree with your friend uh\nit depends on how you look at it like uh\nat the moment\nshe didn't feel good at all because she\nher mind\nshe was thinking of her father basically\nyou know the person who\nyeah who was harmed and um\nin that sense yeah it was thank i think\nit was technically inappropriate but uh\nbut uh so and what do you go by what\nwhat do you how should i address you\nadam\nmy name is adam adam with an m or an n\nyeah it is with an n okay can you\nso adam here here is my initial thought\nokay and i'm sorry that\nmaybe this won't be very helpful but\nso first is that you know i would\nhow can i say this so i would be really\npaying attention to\nwhat are the drivers inside you\nat each step of the way so\nyou know like let me just give you an\nexample so we sometimes have people in\nour community\nwant to help other people but they don't\nwant to help other people\nthey want to help other people for their\nown sake\nlike i need to feel good about myself\nin order to feel good about myself i\nneed to help someone else\nso they're helping other people almost\nbecome selfish\nand and like sometimes like those people\nreally don't like respect\nboundaries well because they're like oh\ni can really help you i can really help\nyou like i need you\nto let me help you\nand and so sometimes like people will\nnot feel confidence or won't feel good\nabout themselves\nunless they are able to help other\npeople\nyeah so i think it's worthwhile\nexploring\nwhether you fall into that so when\nyou're trying to think\nyeah i think i've fallen into that\nsometimes yeah\nright so that's something that you need\nto be really careful about and just kind\nof notice that\nand and sometimes you know for people\nbecause i i mean what you're describing\ndoesn't sound inappropriate to me it\nsounds like\nyou know you had a friend that was going\nthrough a tough time and you just asked\nthem one question\nabout how they're feeling and then like\nyeah you know having an issue\nlike uh i can remember uh how much into\ndetail i went\nright now yet you can or cannot\ni cannot yeah that's okay so so that's\nwhy we're gonna just\nyou know so what the situation you're\ndescribing doesn't sound inappropriate\nto me\nso even if it's not inappropriate we can\nstill lay out\nlike how to approach the problem okay so\none is that you know\nif your desire to help other people\ncomes from\na need that you have to help other\npeople\nthen that's not really good it's not\nhealthy\nbecause people may not need your help\nbut you\nare like trying to force your help on\nthem that's one option\nsecond thing to think a little bit about\nis that you know when your friend\nlike maybe your friend like maybe the\nproblem is with your friend it may not\nbe\nyou at all it could be that your friend\nis behaving you know that really what\nyou asked was completely okay and you\nyou know your friend just thinks it was\ninappropriate but it's not really\ninappropriate\nso then the question becomes if your\nfriend says something\nwhy do you trust their word instead of\nyour own judgment\nyeah that's tough right now\nright so like it's a little bit\nunclear but i think at the end of the\nday the most important thing adam is\nis to just to to think a little bit\nabout what's driving you on the inside\nyou know like so even when and i think\nyour original question was about\nhow you overthink things when you have\ninteractions with people\nand so so like if we think about\noverthinking\nwhat is the root of that overthinking\nlike what are you concerned about\nwhen you're overthinking like when\nyou're thinking about this like what\ni i don't know how to say this but like\nyou know when you have anxiety over\nsomething\nyou're usually afraid of a particular\nthing happening\nand so all of your overthinking is going\nto revolve\naround something that could happen does\nthat make sense\nyeah what is the thing that you're\nafraid of\nthat will happen\num\n[Music]\nthe the person uh\nends up not being able to to deal with\nmany many stressful stressful situations\nor bad situations\nso you're concerned about how the person\nis going to end up\nnot what they're going to think about\nyou know\nyeah how the person is going to end up\nand so you think that something that you\nyou told them\nis going to like actually cause them\nharm\nno i don't think\ni don't think that at those moments you\nknow and\nthen what i'm saying is disgusting or\nit's gonna cause harm like uh\nat the moment i um i recognize it\nbecause\ni an amount of harm but\nin the long term i'm not sure either\ni i i'm starting to lose you a little\nbit adam\nwhat are you when you overthink a\nsituation\nwhat what like help me understand can\nyou tell me what your actual thoughts\nare\ncan you repeat when uh when i when you\noverthink something so here's what i\nunderstand\nyeah so what's an example of the kind of\nthoughts that you have\nlike uh for example from\n[Music]\nlike if the person if if i detect the\nperson has uh\nproblems with with codependence for\nexample\nuh i think on how\nhow how can i help them\ndeal with uh with a certain situation\nso so they don't depend on others and\nand they\nand they and they for example accept uh\nhow things are\nand uh and\nso you try to help people with their\ncodependence\nyeah that's one example okay yeah\nbecause in this case with this friend of\nmine i detect\ncodependence uh from her\nyou know from and how does she respond\nto that\num when we talk about it and she's not\ndealing with uh with a hard situation\nlike yesterday's\nit's fine like she she told me like it's\nokay that\nwe talk about those things when uh\nwhat she said when it's about the past\nthat when i when i'm dealing with\nsomething\nhard for me um\nit bothers me what bothers you about\nthat\nno no it bothers her i mean i i was\ni was talking from her from her angle\nlike\nso adam and i i'd start by like this\nissue which is like why you have to\nbring up the codependents in the first\nplace\nright now right so so like this is where\ni\ni think like you said you fall into this\ncategory of people who like need to\nlike there are people who are fixers\nright so people\nwho like need to fix other people\num yeah as well as myself\nyeah so i think this is where a lot of\ntimes like being a fixer\ncomes from the inability to fix yourself\num yeah it could be yeah\nso this is where like what's gonna\nhappen is like you're gonna you're gonna\nyou know go around trying to fix all the\nproblems in the world\ninstead of like like to make up for the\nfact that you can't like fix yourself\nwell i i spent a lot of time\nuh trying to well\nfix myself and how's that working\nin many in many areas\nit's working on some in some areas but\nnot not\nnot on others like\ni used to or i tend to um\nto to be like\ni can fix things on my own\nand uh and i think i have a hard time to\nnot just for help but to to um\nmove on with the process of getting help\nhow do you feel about getting help\nyeah how do you feel about getting help\num\nright now i mean right now you mean\nlike so when it comes to your problems\nhow do you feel about you getting help\nfrom other people to fix your problems\noh uh sometimes it feels good\ni mean at the moment it's stressful but\nwhat's stressful about it\num\n[Music]\ni i think that they burned my lives away\nthat's how i see it they what they burn\nmy lies away\nburn your what away my lies i'm sorry\num oh they burn your lies away when you\nget help from other people\nyeah and how do you feel about having\nyour lies burned away\num stressful\nyeah so adam i think that this is like\ngonna be a little bit complicated but\nhere's what i think okay so i think\nyou've got to be like really careful\nhere because i think that you're falling\ninto this trap of like\nyou know you're so eager to help other\npeople\nand you're you really want to like like\nit's a good thing right because you want\nto make the world a better place\nyou want to protect people from\nsuffering you want to point out to other\npeople the problems that you have\nbut i'm reminded of what they say on\nairplanes which is put your own oxygen\nmask on before you\nyou help someone else with theirs yeah\nyeah i agree and so i think a lot of\nthis stuff is like weird like projection\nis is kind of like what we think about\nin psychology which is like\nyou're trying to go out and fix all\nthese other people's problems\nbut it seems like you're hesitant to\nhave other people look at yours\nand as long as you're fixing the rest of\nthe world like you don't have to worry\nabout fixing yourself\nwhereas i think what you need to do is\ndo it the other way like focus on\nyourself first\nand i i know this sounds weird adam but\nlike i don't try to help anyone\ni know and and what i've found is that\nlike when people\nneed your help it's part it's like\nlike their job to come to you and ask\nfor it\nlike you don't go around trying to force\npeople\ninto improving their lives\nand and oftentimes when i see people who\ndo that that has to do more with like\nthemselves and it has to do with the\nother people now i think buried\nlike it throughout all this stuff you\nsound to me like a very\ngenuinely caring person and that you\nwant to wake make the world the better a\nbetter place\nand the world needs more people like you\nand so i think it's wonderful that you\nhave all those qualities\nbut i think that you have to really put\nyour own mind in order\nfor you to be able to like see someone\nobjectively\nbecause as long as you have all these\nissues like going on in your head\nyour mind is gonna warp what you see\nfrom the rest of the world\nand it's hard to describe but like i've\njust seen that you know people who are\nreally capable of helping someone else\nhave their own houses in order first\nyeah yeah yeah i i'm aware of that and i\ntry to apply it\nbut i see i see i see i fail when\nthis kind of situations happen like when\ni screw up it's like uh\nwhat if i was to focus on on them when\nthey didn't mean\nme right so then the question becomes\nhow does it feel\nto not be needed by them um\nwhen i'm aware it's like uh oh crap they\ndon't mean me but\ni have my own things like i'm gonna\nleave them alone it takes me time but\nat that at that time at that moment in\ntime i wasn't aware at all\nyeah i thought i was doing actually\nactually good\nof course and i think that's what i mean\ni think you're a caring person but i i\nthink that something about the way that\nyour mind is working\nyour ego is getting involved with your\ncaring\nright so like what i'm detecting from\nwhat you're saying and i could be wrong\nhere because i don't really have a\ncomplete picture\ni understand but but what i'm kind of\nhearing is that like helping other\npeople\nis like a part of your identity\nand at that point it's no longer about\nthem it's actually about you\nand usually when that happens\nlike you can end up hurting people\nright which is what you're afraid of\nwhen when in when it becomes about me\nhelping people instead of about them yup\nmm-hmm yeah yeah sometimes it happens\ni i'm i do my best to acknowledge the\nfear\nand to and to think logically like um\nso i'm gonna i can do it might happen\nthat i harm this person at this moment\nbut if this doesn't happen or if i don't\ndo it yeah that that's the so i don't\nthat's how this stuff can could happen\nyeah so but that's not your problem\nwell yeah right that's their life and so\nlike the main question that i have for\nyou and i think you've got to be careful\nthere\nwhich is oh it looks like we got it\nright so i'll i'll be with you guys in\njust a second we're just wrapping up\nokay\nso adam here's what i'd say like i think\nit goes back to when when it comes to\nhelping\nother people helping you you said\nsomething about lies\nthat your lies are like seen through\num yeah i mean sometimes i don't agree\nwith what they say\nand and that is stressful too yeah so\nso i think that's time yeah that's where\ni think you need to do the work\nokay so it's not about whether they're\nright or wrong but what i really want\nyou to do is\nstop focusing on other people and focus\non yourself\nfirst and even if they're right or wrong\ndon't turn away from other people\nhelping you\nand even when it comes to helping other\npeople\nnotice that that driver is like kind of\nlike a hunger inside you like it almost\nfeels like\na hunger to me that you need to help\nother people\nyeah and and so just be a little bit\ncareful about that\nmm-hmm okay because like you\nyou know if you're satisfying your own\nhunger you're not really helping other\npeople\nlike sure other people can benefit from\nit it's true\nand and so just be and and this is where\nlike i think part of the problem is like\ni don't know if you're okay being\nselfish but i think like\nyou need to learn how to be selfish yeah\ni'm okay with being selfish\nokay good so so i i mean\nsomething about everything that you're\nsaying adam is is the takeaway that i'm\nhearing from you and i'm i apologize if\ni'm not\nyou know able to understand your\nsituation quite as well\nit's okay i i think that you should stop\nlike look at yourself more and try to\nhelp yourself more\nand then as you grow as a person other\npeople will\ncome to you yeah for help\nyou shouldn't seek it out like when you\nhave your own life in order\nother people believe me will show up\nyeah something happens good yeah so\nthose are the people you should focus on\nhelping but it's not the kind of thing\nwhere you go around and like hunt people\ndown and try to help them like it's nice\nto be a caring friend\nit's nice to help people when they come\nto you\nbut you know i'd really focus on helping\nyourself first and like put that oxygen\nmask on before you start\ndealing with someone else yes\nokay yeah yeah i'm yeah i'm in the\nprocess\ngood that's that's the point yeah yeah\nand i think i think being a part of this\nconversation is a part of that process\nso i really commend you for coming on\ntoday\noh what does command mean\ncommand means i think you did an awesome\njob and i'm very happy that i think you\ndid a good job\nthank you yeah thank you for uh for\nletting me in right\nyeah i think it's great i think a lot of\npeople can resonate and\nand hearing hearing your situation like\na lot of people can relate to that\nyeah um i also have another issue\nit's part of helping myself okay indeed\num some many times uh\ni feel that vote in my heart in regards\nto physical affection right\nit affects me when when people i i have\nan emotional\nemotional connection with uh go to their\nhomes and i can\nand i cannot even hug them and and many\ntimes when i wake up\nin the morning some\nlike um sometimes uh\nyou know thinking about the things that\ni can work on\nlike music or or dancing it helps\nbut uh it's taking me a while to wake up\nlately i'm sorry i don't unders i don't\nquite understand it sounds like you have\ntrouble\nnot being able to hug people when you\nleave\num yeah to\nto hack people to receive uh\nthat kind of affection it's hard for you\nto receive the affection or it's hard\nfor you to not receive the affection\nit's hard for me to receive the\naffection what makes it\nwhat makes it hard when people hug you\nno no not at that moment like uh when\nwhen people hug me and people that i'm\ni feel a deep connection with hug me i\nhave no problem\nuh the problem i have is that i feel\nthat i feel um that i'm lacking in\ngeneral\nof affection that i mean more do you\nsometimes\ni want more affection so what's wrong\nwith that\nnothing there's nothing wrong so what's\nthat's part of\nuh that\nuh that i think i'm not getting\nenough that is a problem\nwhat are we going to do about it good\nquestion\nadam are you are you in a romantic\nrelationship right now\nno when was the last time you were in\none or have you been in one\num that has been established uh\nactually never uh i had a friend of mine\num from whom i will receive a lot of\naffection\nuh but she was i felt a lot of\ntoxicity like uh she had serious issues\nlike\nsuicide and this kind of stuff\nand how did it feel to receive affection\nfrom someone who had a lot of issues\num at those moments felt\ngood it felt good\nyeah and what i mean what do you think\nabout it now\num that part was okay like uh\nthere is nothing about happening why\ndon't you think you've had a girlfriend\nbecause i i haven't exposed myself\nenough\nokay yeah i haven't\nshown my guts enough like you say\nand what keeps you from showing your\ncuts\num right now nothing\nin general um many many kinds of fears\nlike uh\ni want to be able to to dance in public\nmore and to sing\nin public more and i'm very scared about\nthose things\nand i want to do it because i do them\nbecause i love them\nand what keeps you from dancing and\nsinging in public\ni don't know how to organize an event\nhere where i live\nfor example so it sounds like you're\nyou're not afraid of dancing and singing\nin public you just haven't had the\nopportunity\num yeah it feels that way\nyeah what is not dancing and singing in\npublic have to do with finding a\ngirlfriend\n[Music]\ni related those topics as being of\nauthentic\nand uh and that's using those things\nas as means to to attract people\nso do you feel like you need to do those\nthings to attract\ngirls\nnot exclusively like those are options\nbut those are the options that you think\nabout so i asked you about a girlfriend\nand you started talking about dancing\nand singing in public\nyeah the answer to the girlfriend is no\nlike uh\ni've never had a formal girlfriend\nis that because is that because you\nhaven't danced and sung in public\nno no no no it's not because of that so\nso\nokay this is the thing adam i want you\nto notice a little bit about\nhow you're answering my questions yeah\nokay so like i ask\nso first of all yeah so i think that you\ni think that\nyou know part of so the helping thing it\nsounds to me like maybe you\nyou know you derive a lot of your\nself-esteem\nand a lot of your worth out of helping\nother people\nwhich can be wonderful but i think that\nyou've got to be a little bit careful\nbecause that's still\nit's really about your ego it's not\nabout the other person\nthe second thing is that it sounds to me\nlike you're hungry for affection and in\nthe past you've\nreceived affection from people that like\nhave\nsome challenges or facing some problems\nand maybe they're not really in a\nrelationship\ni mean they're not in in the right mind\nor right\nplace to be in a relationship but those\nare the people that you've had affection\nfrom in the past\num yeah right yes\nso i like i i think this sounds kind of\nweird but like i i\ni think you need someone to love and i\nthink someone\nyou need to be loved by someone i agree\nand that's where like all this savior\n[ __ ] like all that savior complex and\nstuff like let that stuff go it sounds\nto me like\nwhat you really need is like you need\nsomeone to love\nand take care of and in turn you need\nsomeone to love and take care of you\nyes and this is where i think for\nwhatever reason\ni i don't think that you're\nyou're afraid that whatever you are\nis not good enough\nno and and so that's where you like\nthat's where you need to do the work\nright because if i ask you like why you\nhave a girlfriend and you're like there\naren't events where i can sing and dance\nin public like what\nyou know it's kind of a weird answer\nyeah it is\nand so what i'm hearing from that like i\ni don't mean to make fun of you i'm not\ni'm\nreally not trying to make fun of you\nthere but i know i know\nand so it's kind of like it almost says\nto me that\nyou know you'll be worthy of attracting\nsomeone\nwhen you can display your best qualities\nand that's when like you'll find a\ngirlfriend is when you can do these\nthings but i want you to be really\ncareful there\nbecause like you know life is full of\nall kinds of stuff that we don't do\nbecause it's not the perfect timing i'll\ni'll\napply to college when i know i can get a\n4.0 gpa\ni'll find a girlfriend once i'm in shape\ni'll go to the gym once i exercise\nenough at home so that i don't embarrass\nmyself when i go to the gym\noh yeah you know like all these kinds of\nthings we're like we don't want to do\nstuff\nuntil we're ready and if we really look\nat this like what does ready mean\nwhat ready means is that it alleviates\nour anxiety because we're afraid of\nfailure\nand so in order to deal with that fear\nof failure and that fear of rejection\ni'm going to become adam is going to be\nsuch a [ __ ] sexy mess\nhe's going to be so hot singing and\ndancing in public that the girls\nwon't be able to restrain themselves and\nif you really think about it like what\ndoes that mean it means that you wanna\nlike you're not\nready to put yourself out there until\nyou know\nthat they're gonna love you and that day\nwill never come\ni know and so what you really need to\nwork on is\nlike your anxiety and fear\nabout like how you're not lovable yet\nbecause you're absolutely lovable bro\nyeah i know and so just give people the\nopportunity\nto love you yeah yeah yeah\ni uh i tried\ni tried to to to to do that\nsome days ago when uh when a friend of\nmine was like um\nwe talked about the meeting and and she\njust randomly\nshe she went to to her boyfriend adam\nyou know she didn't think about anyone\nelse listen\nyou gotta stop having these like\nfriend-zoned relationships with women if\nyou're interested in a woman and she's\ngot a boyfriend\ngo bark like go to a different woman and\nif you like a girl\n[ __ ] ask her out yeah\nyeah and if she turns you down like\nunderstand that it's gonna hurt and\nyou're gonna feel unlovable again\nwhich is what you're afraid of in the\nfirst place which is why you need to\nsing and dance in front of them\nbecause you're afraid they won't accept\nyou the way that you are\nand when you get hurt log on to our\ndiscord and tell people that you just\ngot rejected to\nby a woman and that you feel that like\nyou're unlovable\nand let us help you and then go and ask\nout another girl\nand stop trying to help people to get\nthem to fall in love with you\njust let them fall in love with you\nbecause of who you are not because you\nhelped them\novercome their codependency yeah\nyeah i never thought i never thought\nabout\nabout all of this that way like i'm\num i'm very fine if uh if i actually had\na fear of\nuh being unlovable\nyeah i think you do\nbut you are lovable which is why it's so\n[ __ ] sad\nbecause you're a great i know i i know i\nam yeah\nbut there's a part of you that believes\nthat you're not yeah\nthat's right\nso that's what you got to work through\nyeah yeah yeah i'm already trying to sit\nwithout part of me\ngood good just dude\ngive people give give women the chance\nto love you man\nyeah give them the chance because it's\ngonna be to their benefit it'll be\namazing\nyeah yeah and of mine too\nyeah both ways and i love that part of\nlife\nyeah good but like look at that like you\nlove that part of life like who the [ __ ]\nwouldn't want to date you\nthat's true yeah right so let them let\nthem\nlet them partake of a little bit of adam\nyeah yeah\ngive them the gift of yourself yes\nyes instead of trying to emotionally\nsupport\nchicks who have boyfriends like what\nyeah\nwhat the [ __ ]\nyeah that guy\n[Music]\nthey

to people i know\nwell good for you i'd say find a\ngirlfriend first and then go be a\ngenuine friend to the rest of the world\noh interesting interesting yep\nyeah because maybe i focus too much on\nbeing a genuine friend\nyes yes finding a girlfriend yes yeah\nyou're damn right\nyeah i do yep so your emotional energy\nlike she's not\nlike put it into someone who will love\nyou back\nyes in the way that you love them\nyeah okay\nyeah yeah now now i'm re-prioritizing my\nmy\nmy my myself or what i'm gonna do\nin general good good\ngood luck adam can you repeat i said\ngood luck\noh thank you thank you man\nuh i love talking to you i love talking\nto you too\ni think you're a delight to talk to\nthank you"
