    "transcript": "hello hey man hi\nhi nice to meet you nice to meet you too\nwhat do you go by uh ollie is fine\nollie okay how can i help you today\nollie\nuh i guess i had a question about\nrelationships\nand mostly just about um a lot of times\nlike\ni'm not happy in a lot of relationships\nbut i don't know\nlike how to leave or how to like\nprioritize myself\nmore you know sure and\nyeah i just don't know why i do that\nlike i know\nlike the steps to take like i'm like\nokay i'll just tell them hey\ni'm not really happy i should probably\nfocus on myself blah blah blah but i\njust\ncan't do it okay or i use\nlike even when the relationship's like\ncoming to an end\ni just like start panicking and i try to\nlike fix it\ni'm like oh no let's try to work it out\neven though i really don't\nwant to be in it and um yeah\nokay can you help yeah so that's that's\nuh i'm really glad you\num you know came in today and are\nsharing this question\nor concern because i think it's a really\nimportant thing that a lot of people\nstruggle with\nso i think the way to approach\nsituations like this like\nis to first understand what is going on\ninside you\nso when a relationship comes is starting\nto come to an\nend let's actually start a little bit\nbefore that so when you say you're\nunhappy in a relationship\nwhat does that mean um it's like\neither i'm bored or i just don't really\nlike the person that i'm with is like\nhurtful\nin a certain way or like are doing\nsomething that's just like upsetting me\nor it's just um can you give me an\nexample of what's hurtful in a\nrelationship\num well i guess the like the last\nperson that i was with um i mean they\nwere nice\nand all and like it was like an okay\nrelationship overall but um i think a\nlot of times\nshe would make comments about me being\nlike awkward or like shy\nand stuff and i it just\nmade me like feel worse about myself and\ni never really like spoke up about it\nlike whenever she'd say\noh like you know i really don't like it\nwhen you don't like try to talk to\npeople more\nokay you walk really awkwardly and\ni don't know like it kind of just like\nit makes me act more awkward around her\nand all that stuff sure and um\nyeah i just you know like but like you\nknow at the time i was like oh yeah it's\nit's my fault i'm the dumbass who's\nawkward you know it's not\nat all you yeah okay yeah\nsomeone\ni was just gonna say like whenever you\nhad like conversations about like\nbreaking things off it would\nit would kind of just go into um like me\nsaying oh no\ni'll try to work on myself you know\nthese are things they'll\nfix eventually in the future blah blah\nblah\nand yeah so in those\nokay so there are a couple of things\nthat we have to kind of like unpack here\nokay ollie yeah so let's start with like\nwhat's in your mind when you're in this\nsituation\nso when the way you asked the question\nyou were like\nwhen relationships are unhealthy for me\ni don't\nit was almost like you were saying i\ndon't have the courage\nto break up with them does that make\nsense\nyeah that kind of makes sense yeah but i\ni think that that's sort of uh that\ncould be a little bit misleading because\nif in the moment you actually\nbelieve what they say then it's not\nabout courage because\nyou actually genuinely think that you're\nat fault\nyeah right there are two issues here one\nis that you may believe that you're at\nfault\nand so like if you're the problem like\nhow does breaking up\nhelp anything you need to fix yourself\nand then the relationship will be\nhealthy\ndoes that make sense uh yeah it makes\nsense\nand then the other option is that you're\nnot at fault but you have\ntrouble like being confrontational\nor stating your views for some\nreason yeah so which\nand it can be a blend of both but which\none are we talking about here\nlike which one you fall into i think\nit's a mix of both i would say the\nlatter\nis more like just not being able to like\nconfident be confrontational and stuff\nokay so how would you how do you feel\nlike so it sounds like it at times when\nshe said\noh you know you're awkward or you walk\nfunny you are like yeah i'm the dumbass\nthat dot dot dot\nbut then when you do know that you kind\nof want to break up with them\nwhat gets in the way of you telling them\num i guess kind of just like like when i\nthink about it i'm just like oh well\nlike\nyou know if i go through with this it's\njust\nuh sorry i just need to like think about\nthis for a second um i think it's just\ntake a second to think about it\ni mean it's like a mix of like emotions\nit's not just like\noh like i don't like one's just\ni don't i feel like me saying oh i just\ndon't want to like make this work\nanymore sometimes feels like oh it's\njust\nme being like weak you know like\nlike with that person like the issue was\njust like me being like a little\nlike anxious and stuff or just awkward\nif you like me saying like oh\nlike i don't want to do this anymore i\nfelt like oh like\nyou know i have these problems and\nthey're never going to go away\nso why would i try to like\nfix them or something like that or just\nlike oh like\nyou know once i'm done like no one else\nwould like ever like want to be with me\nblah blah blah\nlike something dramatic like that so\nyeah so i i understood that last part i\nwas a little bit confused about\nsome you said something about this is\nnever going to get better\nso what helped me understand that oh\nit's just like you know like\nyou know like me like break like ending\nthe things\nbreaking up with them or whatever would\nmean that like oh i couldn't fix my\nproblem\nyou know like i wasn't able to like find\nmy solutions i just gave up\nyeah are you concerned about\nhow they would feel if you broke up with\nthem\nyeah and how do you feel\nwhat are your concerns about their\nfeelings i mean i just\ndon't want to like hurt your feelings or\njust make them feel bad\nyou know do you feel responsible for\ntheir feelings\nuh a bit yeah like not like you know\nlike\nwell if i like do something that like\nhurts them i like feel really bad\nand i'm just like oh i sh why did i do\nthat you know\nyeah so ali there's something really\nreally dangerous you're doing here\nright so let me just kind of try to lay\nthis out\nso one is there's a fatalistic view\nabout yourself\nlike if i break up with them i have to\nfix this problem\ni can't fix this problem now so i won't\nbe able to fix it later\ni might as well stay in the relationship\nand so in a weird way what you're doing\nis you're sort of saying like i don't\nhave\nthe control or strength because you call\nyourself weak\nto fix myself and so so\nthere's it's kind of interesting because\nit's sort of like you don't have the\npower to control\nyour own life and then your mind does\nsomething really really\ndangerous which is a lethal combination\nwith that one it's like a combo\nwhich is that you do have the power to\ncontrol their lives\nbecause if you don't break up with them\nat least they'll be happy\nor if you do break up with them they'll\nbe sad and that's something you can fix\nso i think the reason that you have\ntrouble in these sorts of situations is\nbecause there's like a one-two punch of\ni can't fix my i can't make myself happy\nbut i can make them happy and so if you\nreally think about it it's like a\nlogical no-brainer that like why would\nyou\nbecause you're if you break up with them\nit's not like you're going to be able to\nfix the problem anyway\nso why would you hurt them if you're\njust going to be screwed on your own and\nyou're going to screw them over too\nwhy not just stay in the relationship\nand at least make them happy because\nit's not like you're salvageable\ndoes that resonate at all or not so much\num\nyeah i mean that that's kind of on the\nspot really you know\nso so that's that's tricky right because\nit's like\nlike this is where i want you to\nunderstand ali you're not stupid and\nyou're not\nweak you're actually like a caring\nintelligent\nperson and you're just making that\njudgment call\nbased on the data that you've got which\nis like\ni can make them happy and stay in the\nrelationship\nand sacrifice my own happiness but even\nif i break up with them it's not like\ni'm gonna be happy anyway so there's\nlike it's like a no-brainer of a choice\ndoes that make sense\nyeah that makes sense like it's not i\ndon't know i'm kind of just like the way\ni work it in my head\nexactly it's the way you work it in your\nhead is like it's just a terrible idea\non all fronts to break up because\nbreaking up is gonna hurt them and it's\nnot gonna help you so why do it\nyou might as well work on yourself fix\nyourself in the relationship\nand then everything will change so if\nyou want to tackle that\nthat one-two punch of i can make their\nlife better and i can't make mine better\nright so those that's the tricky thing\nif you want to tackle that you have to\ntackle those assumptions so\nwhy do you believe that you can't\nyou know work on yourself more\nwhy do you believe like where does the\nbelief that you're a weak person\ncome from um\ni i guess like a mix of things um i\ndon't i mean i don't think i'm like\nentirely a weak person but um\ni i mean a lot of times when i try to\nlike work on myself\nlike i sell start building routines like\nexercising\nand all that stuff like things go well\nfor a while and then\nlike like the littlest thing happens and\nit kind of just sets off like a\ndomino effect where everything just kind\nof fumbles down so it's just\ni just feel like oh like if i'm reacting\nso negatively to like the smallest thing\nyeah it must be weak\nali that's like when the power there's a\npart when you start to put your life\ntogether\nyou have a small setback and then\nthere's a part of your mind that says\ni told you so i told you you couldn't do\nit what were you\nwhat were you thinking early that you\ncould put your life together\nhow stupid can you be i told you so you\nbetter not try and so that's the thing\nthat you really really have to tackle\nright so like where does\nthat voice come from because i don't\nthink you're a failure\nat all it's just you have a some scar\nwhich is\ns-a-m-s-k-a-r-a you have this like\nthis programming in your mind that tells\nyou it's like the voice that was\nimplanted in your mind\nthat tells you that you're incapable of\nchange\nand so like you know you really have to\ndig into where\nthat voice comes from do you know\num i i think i do\nkinda ish i mean i feel like there's a\nlot of incidents\nlike that i've like because like i think\nlike i've never been like the um\nsmart kid ever you know in school at\nleast\nand um i remember in middle school um i\ntook like it we\ntook like why i like well i grew up in\num iran\nfor like background and stuff and we had\nlike\nstandardized tests that would kind of\nevaluate your like math and like\nlanguage scores and all that stuff\nand it was like ranked and i actually\nscored like\nreally high on that and um i felt\npretty good about myself that day\nbecause i was like oh maybe i'm not\nstupid you know and i felt like okay\nmaybe i can start\nplaying better in school i can start\nfocusing on myself and like\nall that stuff and then the same day um\nwe had like you know like binders in our\nlocker rooms and stuff\nand like the dean would just check them\non daily to make sure we're like\norganized and stuff\nand he checked mine i'm not a very\norganized person\nso i got very upset at that and he came\nto class and he threw a binder at me\nand started yelling at me saying i'm\nlike a failure or whatever\nand i was like oh okay i guess i guess\nhe has a point\nyou know well so i think that's a that's\na very\ninsightful story to share ali because\nthat's it right\nit's not just that he threw the binder\nat you it's that he threw the binder on\nat you on the same day that you did well\nin the class in the standardized test so\nit's like when you succeed\nyou know like elise when you're about to\nsucceed\nali steps in and snatches defeat from\nthe jaws of victory\nlike you're about to win and then like\nsomething shows up and then like teaches\nyou\nputs you in your place how dare you\nthink you're smart ali\nyeah and and so just notice that pattern\nbecause like it's really challenging\nbecause as long as that pattern is there\nyou know it's it's going to be really\nhard because any time you try to take a\nstep forward\nthe pattern is triggered by your actual\nsuccess\nlike does that make sense no that makes\nperfect sense you don't say i told you\nso\nuntil you start succeeding and that's\nwhat's like it's like\nthis is op it's like it's completely\nbroken and needs to be patched\nbecause any step forward you take it\ntriggers the pattern so that it's almost\nlike\ni know this is going to sound kind of\nweird but when i think about patterns\nlike this i actually think\nabout hiv and the problem with hiv\nis that it attacks the very part of your\nimmune system that fights viruses and so\nin that way like you have this pattern\nin your mind\nthat attacks the part of your mind that\nhelps you\nget out of like negative emotional and\nmental spaces\nyeah and so this is a sort of situation\nwhere i think it's really important to\nrecognize that\nyou're not actually failing it's just\nany time something anytime you start to\nsucceed and you're\nactually succeeding this pattern is\ngoing to wake up and\ntell you that you're failing\nand be aware of that and recognize that\nlike the stronger that pattern is\noddly enough the better you're doing\nbecause it doesn't turn on unless you're\ndoing well\nwhat do you think about that um\nyeah i mean that makes sense like it's\nkind of i mean it's also like\num i don't know if this is like related\nor not but it's also when i\nlike when i do that right like i kind of\nlike it also like activates\nlike in a way where it's like oh you\nknow you're hey you know you're just\nfalling behind again like what's the\npoint of trying\nbecause like you know you're already so\nbehind and it's stupid\nbut you know it's so no it no so so it's\nnot stupid\nthat's the thing that you've got to\nunderstand is you have to understand\nthat these these thoughts in your mind\nare coming from experience and and so as\nlong as you treat them as stupid\nyou're not going to be able to overcome\nthem and so\nactually what you want to do is like\nrecognize that\nin some weird way your mind is twisting\nto make that not stupid\nand then you have to learn how to\nuntwist which is sort of like\nthere's sort of this i told you so\nyou're not worth a whole lot kind of\nlike like attitude and i think as long\nas that attitude is there you're going\nto continue getting into these\nsituations in your relationships\nand to really unpack that attitude\nyou've got two or three options one is\nto recognize the attitude as it arises\nand try to be really objective in those\nmoments about okay\nmy mind is telling me i told you so\nyeah my mind is telling me that i'm not\ngonna do anything\nbut if i really stop and think about it\ni've been exercising for a week\nand like this is one day that i've\nmessed up so recognize it\nand sort of just see you don't have to\ntell it it's stupid you just have to\nlike\ntry to see the other side of the coin\nthe second thing that you could really\ndo i mean this this sounds like prime\nfor\nyou know depending on what you've been\nthrough i would strongly get\nyou know considered getting evaluated by\na mental health professional\num because because maybe there could be\nelements of like trauma or depression or\nor things like that that that may be\nlike clinical in nature that you could\nbenefit from\nand if you want to work on the some scar\nitself you don't have to see a therapist\nfor that if you don't have a clinical\nsort of issue and then like coaching is\nsort of designed to help people work\nthrough\nthose kinds of issues and help you\nunderstand your patterns\nthat's really what coaching is about um\nbut i definitely think that this is not\na journey that\num you need to walk alone although i\nthink if you\nwork at it like i think you'll you can\nfigure it out on your own through\nmeditation through reflection things\nlike that because you sound to me to be\nactually a pretty capable guy and very\ninsightful\nwhich i think is really what you need\num yeah i mean that sounds right i mean\ni've been trying therapy for a while\nit's just um\ni don't have i've yet to like meet\nsomeone that's like\nable i'm able to like talk to in like a\nway where like\ni feel like if there's an understanding\nor whatever\nyep but yeah yeah and if there isn't an\nunderstanding whose fault is that\nit's their fault good\nokay so so i i'm gonna toss one last\nthing to you okay\nyeah it's their fault but it's also your\nresponsibility\nyeah that makes sense okay\nyeah all right man thanks for calling in\nhopefully that was helpful\nno that was really helpful yeah thank\nyou so much for all the\nkind words and stuff thank you for\ncalling in i i really\ni think your question and concern is\nsomething that a lot of people can\nrelate to\nyeah no i really enjoyed it yeah glad i\nhope someone else\ncould relate to that too yeah thank you\nyou're welcome\nyeah adios"
