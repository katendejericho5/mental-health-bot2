    "transcript": "you gotta save them for oh dude okay so\nthis is actually i'm glad because i\nalmost\ni almost posted in response to this\nokay so this person is actually\nbrilliant because it is actually there's\ngood scientific evidence that this is\npart of the problem so every mental\nhealth professional i've ever talked to\nhas been like\nyou have a lot of self-awareness men and\ni'm like yes i actually think that is\npart of the problem\nabsolutely true so this is can i can i\njust\nharvard andy for here for a second yeah\nthat's the point\nyeah okay so we have this part of our\nbrain called the default mode network\nokay and the default mode network is the\npart of our brain that gives us the\ncapacity\nfor self-awareness so if we look at like\nanimals and humans the biggest\ndifference between\nanimals and humans most and animals and\nhumans anyway is the\nis the default mode network so like\nanimals you know like let's say like you\ntake a deer or something like a deer\nwill go about its day and then it won't\nthink about itself going about its day\nbut human beings have this capacity of\nself-reflection\nand so um that capacity for\nself-reflection\nis this thing called the default mode\nnetwork so what i can do\nis you know look at my like look at the\nactions that i take\nand kind of reflect on\nmy sense of self within these actions um\nlet me just think about how to explain\nthat better so\nyou know if i ask like if a deer looks\naround for food in 10 places\nand doesn't find food the deer doesn't\nstart to feel\nlike an idiot because it hasn't been\nable to find food and it's like over 10.\nbut if we think about human beings if i\nyou know ask ten girls out\nand then they say no like as a human\nbeing i start to think\nabout myself in that way and then i say\noh my god i'm such an idiot\nso human beings have this this and if\nyou really think about it it's actually\nlike quite\nprofound and it's an amazing capability\nthat our brain has\nwhere we can do like meta-level thinking\nabout ourselves as we move about in the\nworld\nthat is done by the default mode network\nso it's essentially our capacity for\nself-awareness\nnow the interesting thing is that once\nwe have the default mode network\nwe also evolutionarily speaking by\nourselves\nthe possibility of depression and what\nwe\nfind is that people who are depressed\nhave overly active default mode networks\nokay so let's think about this for a\nsecond okay so like\ni asked 10 girls well as two girls out\ndefault mode network is not active\nit's just they said no okay both of them\nsaid they had boyfriends no big deal i'm\nnot\nthinking about myself in that way i\nasked 10 girls out they all say no\nnow this default mode network activates\nand it's like hey man like maybe\nyou're ugly or something like that right\nit starts like thinking negative\nthoughts about you\nand it's sort of this meta-level\nproblem-solving thing where it's like\nlooking at you as a person and saying\ncan we change something about ourselves\nto increase our overall chances of\nsuccess\nokay so that's what the\ndefault mode network does now when\nsomeone gets depressed\ntheir default mode network is highly\nactive\nokay and then what happens is when i ask\ntwo girls out but my\ndefault note mode network is highly\nactive from depression\nthen i start thinking those meta\nthoughts about how i'm the problem\nin this big situation except now the\nsituation is tiny\nand when the default mode network is\nhyperactive even tiny little things that\nreally shouldn't be my fault\nbecome like my fault because this\ncircuit in my brain\nthat's like being self-reflective is\nalways on so then you get to these weird\nthoughts that depressed people have\nlike oh my family would be better off\nwithout me and it's just like such a\nweird thought but what you really see is\nthat\nthis is a situation where you know their\nmind\nis viewing like a meta problem with\nthemselves in things that are completely\nunrelated\noh like these people are gonna fire me\nbecause i'm a waste of space and like\nall the time you're thinking about\nyourself thinking about yourself\nthinking about yourself\nwhich is literally your capacity for\nself-reflection exactly like this guy is\nsaying\nokay so it's like what he's saying he's\nlike yes your self-awareness is part of\nthe problem\nyour mind's being stuck at always\nlooking at yourself\ninstead of taking a step back is\nactually correlated neuroscientifically\nwith depression\nthis person is a hundred percent correct\nso\nother evidence kind of weird right so\nnow we have these things like\nnovel treatments for depression like\nketamine so ketamine is an example\nof don't recommend you use ketamine is a\nsubstance of abuse\nthat can also be used in a licensed and\nprescribed way to treat depression\nand what ketamine is is it deep it's\nlike a dissociative agent right so what\nit does is it causes you to like\nseparate from yourself\nand so what ketamine does so ketamine is\none of the quickest acting\ntreatments for depression so if someone\nis in a depressive episode and they get\nadministered ketamine\nthey can improve within like hours\nwhereas most things like ssris or\nantidepressant medication\nwill take weeks right so i really do not\nrecommend that people use ketamine\nrecreationally because when you use it\nas a treatment there's a purity\nguarantee there's also an administration\nissue because it is a drug of abuse\nit's administered with like a nurse\nnearby because there can be dangerous\nside effects so don't recreationally use\nketamine\nor don't even like you know get it\nprescribed like use it under the\nguidance of a physician\nbut the key thing here is the\nneuroscience of it okay so what does\nketamine do in the brain\nso what it does is shut off the default\nmode network\nso in that dissociation where i stop\ngetting stuck in myself it actually\nshuts off the default mode network\nand so some of these other substances\nwhich are you know they're trials now\nfor things like psilocybin and\nmdma and stuff all of those like\nhallucinogen substances that cause\npeople to have this like cosmic\nsense of connection it separates you\nfrom this kind of thinking\nwhich is like instead of your high\nself-awareness being focused on you\nall the time now suddenly like with\nthese substances your mind is able to\nlike\npull back from that and you actually\nshut off the default mode network\nokay so this is actually brilliant it's\na wonderful observation\nyes okay so the brain's default mode\nnetwork people sometimes want references\nright so here's a good\ni guess this is written by marcus e\nrachley\nokay two hours later\ndoes that make sense chad i don't know\nif i\nyou're failing this class for sure\ni'm lost okay so\nbasically this is what the paper says we\nnormally have an intact sense of self\nokay this intact sense of self and our\nhigh awareness of ourselves we're always\nlooking at ourselves like\nlike an active default mode network\nmeans that when i'm at a party\ninstead of paying attention to other\npeople my mind is constantly occupied by\nthinking about myself oh i look stupid\ni sound stupid people aren't talking to\nme\npeople are talking to other the focus\nof your mind is on i you are the object\nof your attention\nokay like anxiety yes\nthen what happens so so when this person\nsays\nlike this person on on loretta's says\nyou know i actually think that\nself-awareness is the problem they're\nabsolutely right because their\nself-awareness is a high\nlevel i mean is is their default mode\nnetwork being highly active\nthen we can look at neuroscience papers\nand what we discover\nis that substances like psilocybin\nfracture our sense of self and that can\nbe traumatic and dangerous by the way\nand leave people with ptsd which is why\ni don't recommend you do it\nfracture the sense of self but when when\nyou stop when that sense of self gets\nfractured you're no longer\nstuck thinking about yourself and when\nyou're no longer stuck\nthinking about yourself this problem of\nover self-awareness goes away and people\nget better\nin terms of depression does that make\nsense"
