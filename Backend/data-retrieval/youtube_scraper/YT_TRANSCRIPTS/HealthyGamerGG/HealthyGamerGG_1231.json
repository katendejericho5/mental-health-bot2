    "transcript": "yo hey how's it going\ngood man how are you\npretty well how are you good i'm sorry\nbut\ni'm really enjoying connecting with the\ncommunity today so i'm i'm feeling the\nhype\ni guess i'll hop right in uh you can\ncall me\nand pick or hippo for this um\nhippo it is so my world view\nis um you know kind of around\nbeing empathetic kind and kind of\nrespecting everybody's humanity\num and i've been really\nstruggling lately with kind of existing\nin a world that seems to\nreward people for being the antithesis\nof that\num and then that kind of leads into a\nsecond part\nof when i see\nyou know rush limbaugh die or\num you know the capitol riders rioters\nget\nthrown in prison or um you know even an\nanti-massacre get covered\nmy knee-jerk reaction is kind of like\nhaha good\num but i don't want to be that person\nespecially if i'm trying to you know be\napathetic and kind um i don't\nnecessarily want to\nextend my empathy to them but i also\ndon't want to revel in their pain\nokay so a hippo\nyeah go ahead my question is really just\nlike how to resist\nthat feeling of you know kind of\nthose like fuzzy feelings you get when\nyou see somebody get like they're just\ndesserts\nlet me think about this for a second\nit's a good question\ntell me a little bit about the you said\nsomething about like\nexisting in a world where evil people\nare rewarded\nyeah i would say um so\ni've kind of been struggling with i\nguess what i\nthink to be um dysmea or\npersistent or dysmia and persistent\ndepressive disorder for\nmany many years um and\nyou know i think that's a lot to do with\nit of\njust you know the root the world seems\nto reward\nselfish people um and that's very\ndisappointing to me do you feel like\nthe world has do you feel like you're a\ngood person\nuh i like to think i am a good person\num do you feel like the world has\nscrewed you because of it oh certainly\nyeah how so\nuh just i've you know my kindness has\nbeen\ntaken advantage of plenty of times or\nnot\nbeing um\ni feel like i often get run over for\ni guess not being outspoken about you\nknow my beliefs\nor you know even\npeople bullying me would get popular\nbecause of it or\npeople would be popular because of\nbullying not maybe not necessarily me\nspecifically\nuh can you give us an example of like\nhow you were taken advantage of because\nof your kindness\nuh i guess it might not even be\nkindness but not confrontationalness\nlike i\nam an amazing musician and in my band\num you know a lot of times i guess i\ndon't\ni'll put my feelings aside about like a\ndecision\num just to avoid the confrontation\nuh i guess a lot of times i'm\nyou know in my head it's like you know\nwhat they'll i'll let them think\nwhatever they want to think and then\neventually they'll just come around to\nmy way of thinking when i'm\nproven to be right so\njustice will happen in the end\nyeah essentially what i'm hearing is\nthat you've got a pretty big justice\nboner\nuh sure yeah i would say that's pretty\naccurate\noh yeah so hippo here's here's my take\nokay so the first thing is that i think\nthat like\nyou're when you look at the world\nand you feel like you know you want to\nrevel in\nin rush limbaugh's passing\ni think that that comes from like your\nown\npersonal experience of injustice\nright it's like it's like the the way in\nwhich you look at the world and how like\nevil people\nare rewarded and like evil people were\nrewarded by taking advantage of you\nand that's sort of like why you care\nabout it in the world\nand the reason that you revel in it is\nbecause like you what you really wanted\nis those bullies to get\nyou know justice served to them and so\nwhen when there are people that you\nperceive as evil who get like justice\nserved to them it sort of like\nfeels really good to you because that's\nsort of like what you always wanted\nright does that make sense like do you\nsee how your personal experiences\nand the things that you choose to care\nabout in the world could be related\nyeah um it's i guess what\ni struggle with is like yeah i'll have\nthat warm fuzzy feeling for a second but\nthen i'll feel really bad about\nharboring that feeling\num i want to yeah yeah go ahead\noh that's please please go ahead yeah so\nso i i i didn't mean to talk over you\njust then\nbut um so i i get that and and so i\nthink that like you're a good person but\nwhat\nwhat i'm what i'm hearing is that like\nso this is my\nimpression of people who get like caught\nup with like issues\nso i think a lot of people who get\ncaught up with issues\nhave a personal like driving force\nthat causes them to care about that\nthing now that isn't necessarily good or\nbad but\ni think sometimes people will try to\nsave the world\nat the neglect to like growing as a\nhuman being\nand the worst case scenario which\nunfortunately i've seen\nis people who are crappy human beings\nwho\ncall the who allow for themselves to be\ncrappy\nbecause they support a good cause\nright and like that's like that's sort\nof like the end goal\nof like where we don't want to go which\nis that i'm going to be like a complete\ntoxic person but because i support\nsomething\nthat is morally correct in the macro\nsense it excuses my personal behavior\nand i don't need to grow as a good\nperson because i support black lives\nmatter and if i\nsupport black lives matter then i'm a\ngood person and i can be mean to people\non the internet and i can\nbe you know i can\nslash people's tires who are racist and\nfrom texas\nbecause black lives matter and that's\nwhat makes me a good person\nso i think you've got to be a little bit\ncareful here because i think\nyour mind is doing something very\ninteresting which is that\nyou have personal experiences\nwhich my sense is that you're projecting\nthose personal experiences\nand putting the focus of your mind on\nthe outside world\nand then what happens is like your mind\nis looking at all these terrible things\nin the world and you can't fix\nthose and so then you begin to feel like\noh my god the world is like a terrible\nplace and like i can't do anything about\nit\nand how like look at all these like evil\npeople that are triumphing\nand that's like depressing because\nthere's so much evil in the world and\nlike you can't do anything about it\nand so but it's kind of weird because\nit's like your mind is choosing to look\nat problems that you have no\ncontrol over and i think the reason that\nyou care about those problems is because\nthey relate to you personally\nit's like like there were evil people\nwho did things to you\nand the world did not serve them justice\nand so you become very very sensitive to\nthat i don't mean sensitive in like a\nyou know like a weak emotional way i\nmean like sensitive in the sense that\nyour mind is like picks up those things\nin the outside world\nhyper aware of it hyper aware very good\nand\nand then what happens is like when those\npeople do get justice like\nthe part of you that yearn for justice\nfrom the bullies\nthe part of you that yearns for justice\nfrom your bandmates when they come\naround to see that way\nlike that part of you gets satisfied\nbecause that's what it's hungry for\nand then you feel guilty because you\nrecognize there's something like\nfundamentally like wrong about that\nrevelry\nbut and so this is where everything i\nthink comes back\nto home which is like you've got to work\nthrough like your\npersonal issues of being wronged\nand being non-confrontational and like\nbeing on the short end of the stick\nbecause until like and as you start to\ndo that i think it's going to be weird\nbut like as you develop like\ntranquility and security in yourself the\nproblems of the world don't change\nit's just you feel capable of like doing\nsomething about them\nbut if you want to fix the world it's\nlike you have to be like confident in\nyourself\nfirst and then you can go out and start\nto do things in the world that will like\nstart to make a dent of a difference\nbut the problem is if you feel like you\nknow if you don't feel confident in\nyourself\nyou can have a minor impact on\ngoodness in the world either way the\ndifference is that the way that you\nview yourself determines how satisfied\nyou can be with that contribution\nyeah yeah i definitely make sense i've\nstruggled with um kind of like a deep\nfeeling of being a burden for a really\nlong time\num and i do go to therapy almost weekly\nand work on it um\nyeah good so i think this is where like\nlike i've seen this with people who have\ndysthymia\nusually right so like kind of like what\nyou mentioned whereas they have these\nbig like existential\nconcerns and i know it sounds weird but\nlike in my experience with these people\nyou don't worry about the existential\nconcerns because the existential\nconcerns are sort of like an\nexternalization of internal conflicts\nand what you really focus on is internal\nconflict and then suddenly like if you\nreally make progress\nthere and you make progress and sort of\nlike yourself in your sense of\nconfidence\neven though the world hasn't changed you\nstart to look at it as something that\nyou can like\nchip away at as opposed to something\nthat is impossible\nyeah that makes a lot of sense i've\ndefinitely\nlike i have a wonderful support group\nof friends and i often catch myself\nwaiting like waiting for them to let me\ndown\num yeah so that's what you need to work\non hippo like root and stem\nright so it's like it's like when you\ncatch yourself wait it's beautiful that\nyou're able to do that\nbecause like that's the way that your\nmind looks at the external world too\nyou become hyper aware of things that\nwill confirm\nyour negative view of the world and as\nlong as that hyper awareness is there\nyour mind will filter out all of the\nreasons\nwhy the world is a terrible filter in\nall of the reasons why the world is a\nterrible place and why you should feel\nhopeless\nand as long as that filter exists you're\ngoing to view the world as hopeless\nyeah that makes a little sense right so\ni think you've it's good i think you've\ntaken a really important step in\nbecoming aware of that filter\nand like so like you know if you've got\nthe filter like that's what you've got\nto remove and then the world will become\na different place\nso i guess like is removing the\nfilter just you know a matter of like\ntalk therapy and\nindividualized treatment at that point\nhow long have you been in therapy\nuh therapy only about uh\nthree four months or so okay good so i\nwas afraid that because some people with\nthis time you will have been therapy for\nlike decades\nand and so if you've only been in\ntherapy for three or four months i'd say\ndefinitely stick with it i'd give it a\nminimum of a year to 18 months\nif you're feeling like it's not helping\nplease tell your therapist hey i feel\nlike this isn't helping\nbecause that could be your dysthymie\nitself\ndoes that make sense nothing is getting\nbetter\nexactly so so let your therapist work\nwith you on that and the reason that\nyou've got to tell but you also don't\nwant to ignore those feelings\nbecause that could be your dysthymia or\nyou could have a crappy therapy\nrelationship\nright and you're not going to be able to\ntell the difference does that make sense\nso you got to bring it up to your\ntherapist\nand work through it and see if that's\nhelping because you may need to switch\ntherapists\nbut i'd give yourself at least like a\nyear to 18 months\nin therapy and also like continue to do\num you know meditate if you can and\nbecome aware of as much as you can\nhippo you don't have to change anything\nyet first you want to do like\nreconnaissance\nand and like map everything out in your\nmind and the more you map things out the\neasier it's going to be to start\nchanging stuff\nokay yeah i can definitely um\nyeah understand that for sure yeah good\nluck to you bro\nthank you appreciate the where is it i\nthink the fact that you're coming here\nand you're asking this question\nas long as you do as long as you listen\nto the voice that brought you here\ni think your life will change\nokay i i think that's probably the big\nissue is\ntrusting that voice yep exactly well\nsaid\nand that's what i'm saying like you just\ngot to learn how to trust it\nbecause that's your that's the part of\nyou that wants to move forward and make\na change in your life\nso your biggest challenge is in not\ntrusting that voice\nbecause until you start trusting it or\nyou don't even have to trust it\njust listen to it anyway got it\nwell dude thanks for all that take care\nhippo good luck dude\ndo as well"
