    "transcript": "hey guys dr k here today's video is an\nawesome exploration of finding the\norigin of your psychological scars\nor what your trigger points are\noftentimes people will have you know one\nday and then the next day and on some\ndays your mental is completely busted on\nother days\nthings don't seem to bother you as much\nhow does that work\ntoday's video is an exploration of sort\nof figuring out what are the trigger\npoints\nthat cause you to have a good day or a\nbad day and the challenge here is that\nthis exploration usually isn't linear\nso you all are going to see in the first\nhalf of the video it feels like we're\nkind of meandering and not really\ngetting anywhere\nbut that crystallizing moment comes from\nmapping out all that territory and then\nreally putting the the puzzle together\nin the second half so i hope you guys\nenjoy the video and i hope it's helpful\nokay you hear me yep i hear you great\nbuddy\nokay what's going on what's going on man\noh nothing\num yeah so thanks for coming on i really\nappreciate it\ni i mean i appreciate you uh you guys\nreaching out\num because i i've watched a bunch of uh\na bunch of your streams before and so\nthis is pretty cool\nto actually get to talk to you yeah man\nwell i i hope it\nyou know i hope we can help you in some\nway today uh if you need help that is or\nat least\nentertain you no i yeah\nof course i think everyone needs help\nyeah man you know\num so tell me to start off with what\nwould you\nlike me to call you today uh you could\njust call me lois\ndown here yeah okay and lois can you\ntell me um\na little bit about you know is there\nanything that we you wanted to talk\nabout or focus on or maybe learn a\nlittle bit more about\ntoday explore together\nyeah i mean so\ni i i you guys reached out after like i\nhad like i tweeted uh\noh back to depression okay um\nand i just want to put it out there that\nlike to anyone in the chat who\nwho you know has like diagnosed\ndepression or anything like i'm not\ndiagnosed i was just really like upset\nthat day you know what i mean\num so i just want to say like i don't\njoke about that\num but i just was really feeling down\nand\nuh i think i guess what i want to talk\nwith you about was like\num why\nso why can sometimes\ncomments and like the way people are\naffect me and then sometimes literally\nanyone can say whatever they want it\ndoesn't affect me at all\nlike that's like the thing that's like i\nhave i'm always like\ntrying to figure out um in my own head\nso\nyou know maybe we could start with their\nstart there\nlois dude that is such a brilliant\nquestion man\nreally yeah man like it like think about\nit right because it's like\nit's so confusing because we think that\nthe world operates based on certain laws\nlike gravity always makes things fall\ndown right\nand yeah and so what i'm hearing from\nyou is there are some days of the week\nor some\nstates of mind that maybe you're in\nwhere people's words like really\nsweep past your armor and like hit\nand then there are other times where\nlike you're able to kind of like shrug\nthings off\nyeah like that's the perfect way to\ndescribe it um\nand then the other day when i did tweet\nthat that was one of the days where it\nwas just like\nanything people were saying was just\ncompletely disaffecting me um\nand so it makes me think like is that\neven what's affecting me\nbecause if those words if things people\nsay don't affect me other days\nyou know what i mean so that's that's my\nlike question pretty much\nyeah dude i'm serious i i it's it's one\nof the most\nimportant questions to ask because i\nthink the first thing to kind of\nunderstand\nis that it's not what they say\nright there's there's like there's a\nsignal that gets broadcast\nand then there's a receiver and what i'm\nhearing from you is that the signal can\nbe the same\nevery single day but something changes\non the receiver\nthat allows that signal to come in and\nthat\nreceiver is you and so this is like the\nreason i think that's such an important\nquestion is because i\ni want like people to understand that if\nwe really think about this\nloss what we what we can discover is if\nwe can figure that out\nif we can figure out how the receiver\nworks what we could also do is make\nourselves impervious to criticism\nokay right okay yeah\nif we can figure out the difference\nbetween a day where their words\nhurt and a day where you can shrug them\noff\nand we can figure out how that formula\nworks we can have\nevery day where you're immune to\ncriticism\ni i would love that i'm sorry\nsomething yeah i mean like that's why i\nthink the question is like really really\nwell formulated right because it's like\nit's a very good\num i would love that i would love that\nso let's start with this so let's\nexplore that i think it's great\num i'm just going to make a list of kind\nof talk\ntalking points that we may have to\ncircle back to but\num so can you give me an example of of\nyou know like can you just tell us a\nlittle bit about what kind of day you\nwere having or maybe\nlike you know let's get gather some data\nabout an example of each of those days\nokay so um\ni think the day that i was having that\nday\nwas there was a lot of frustration\nabout things that had nothing to do with\nany comments or anything\nlike that it was just one thing after\nanother after another\nand then when i do finally like after\nthis stuff's already happening i go on\ntwitter\nand um somebody\nsomebody had do you watch basketball or\ndo you watch star wars\nyeah i mean i don't watch basketball\nokay you know lebron yeah so i've been a\nhuge lebron fan since um\nman since i was a little probably like\ni'm 26 now so maybe\nmaybe i was like 13 years old or\nsomething 13 years i don't know\nbut i've been a big fan for a while and\nso\nbut what people love to do is you know a\npart of trolling me\nis whatever i enjoy or ever\nwhatever i show interest in whatever i\nlike hype up or anything\nthey try to just shoot it down you know\nwhat i mean\nand uh it's it's yeah i know it's it's\ni've been getting trolled like this for\na while\num so you know lebron has a bad game or\nsomething or\nthe the lakers lose or something i my\ntwitter mentions are all just like oh\nuh like lebron's ass and you know you\nknow basically just talking [ __ ] and\njust\nand then so i kind of like responded to\none guy and i was like\nyou know i basically just disagreed with\nhim\nand then i just got hit with like 300\nreplies of just\never just like saying the craziest stuff\nto me\num and it it it just\nit became like it wasn't even saying\nthings about lebron it was just\njust saying stuff to just get to me and\non other days where\nwould you say what were they saying oh\nmy god\ni i mean can i say anything i don't want\nto say you know\nis sh can i curse on here uh yeah i\nthink so\njust nothing against tos i mean okay\nyeah we'll go to\nokay well basically no it was just a lot\nof just you know\ninsulting me insulting my intelligence\nuh\ninsulting just me as a person uh\ninsulting lebron whatever\nand like i said other days people\npeople uh talk [ __ ] about lebron all the\ntime like that doesn't\naffect me like i see it all the time but\nit would like i said it was just one of\nthose days where\num this was just like another\nthing added on to it um and it was like\nyeah i was basically going back and\nforth with people and\ni just felt like more people were\nsupporting like the dudes coming at me\nthan like me\nso that just that just made me just more\nmad\num but look in retrospect\non a different day where i'm in a really\ngood mood\ni just i look at it like okay it's\ntwitter trolls just\nyou know yeah messing with me so that's\nthat's the the difference yeah so i\nhere's\nhere's i'm gonna tunnel down okay a\nlittle bit so one is\nyou said you felt like there were more\npeople\nyou know attacking you than defending\nyou\nyeah yeah right yeah so so the first\nthing that i i think you used a really\ngood word there which is\nfelt so we'll we'll dig into like what\nis that feeling\nthe second thing that that i want to\nhighlight is that\nyou know we're kind of focusing on a lot\nof the details of this twitter stuff\nbut you actually started off this this\nstory with sort of saying there were\nseveral things that were unrelated i was\nfrustrated about\nyou want me to tell you like the main\none or something\nsure well i mean i think like let's\nacknowledge that like when you enter the\ntwitter arena\nyour inventory was already full like\nyou're very close to being encumbered\nyeah yeah yeah right so so i think\nthat's going to be a big part of it so\ncan can you tell and and by the way i\nknow sometimes we have like a call ahead\nof time about like\nboundary setting and stuff so if there's\nanything that i ask you that you feel is\nlike not appropriate or out of line or\nyou don't want to share\nyou just let me know okay you can ask me\nanything i um\nokay i'm an open book um i\nwhat's happened is um this happened a\nfew weeks ago and this is when i started\ngetting like upset\nmore and more um someone had\nbotted my twitch account like with a\nbunch of followers like they bought it\nat like 2 million followers or something\num and since then\nthere's been this weird thing happening\nwith with twitch with um\nsending out like notifications people\nnot even getting notifications for my\nstream anymore\nand so you know it was just happening\nevery single day\nand it would be like you know like i\nfollow your stream you went live i got a\nnotification\ni was going live people wouldn't know\nabout it for like 15 minutes\nand then other people would join really\nlate and be like oh i didn't even know\nyou were alive what's going on\nso it was just it's like a thing where\nit's like i feel like i have no control\nover it\nit was just really frustrating um and\nthen\nyeah it was just making everything else\nbad yeah sure\ni it sounds like it sucks man like yeah\nso let's just be a little bit clear\nwhat was it that you had no control over\ni mean like the technology of twitch\ni don't know sure sure so that that in a\npractical sense\nuh obviously you have no control over\nyou know twitter and the guy who decided\nto\nbought me what was the random guy you\nknow i\nlet me think about how to ask this loss\nand this is this is going to be like a\ncrappy\nquestion so i you know apologize if it\ndoesn't make sense but\nwhen we think about those things\nobviously you don't have control over\nthose\nbut in those moments what i'm\nenvisioning\nis those two events took something away\nfrom you\nyeah yeah what did they take away from\nyou\nwell it just felt like man i've been\nstreaming for almost six years on this\nplatform\nand um you know we're trying to handle\nit now i've been talking to some people\nat twitch but\num yeah it just felt like damn like i\nworked all all these years like hard\nwork\nto just wow it could be like taken away\nin some way not fully but like yeah in\nsome capacity\num you know and it just made me start to\nthink like\nwow what if i got banned or something or\nwhat if you know\neveryone lost their notifications but\nlike it just i don't know it just gives\nyou bad thoughts\nyou know because i really care about you\na lot\nso that's that's why i was making me\nfeel like that\nwhat do you what do you care about a lot\num i care about my stream and\nmy you know community and and uh\nyou know growing and you know\nin general you know yeah so tell what do\nyou what do you like about your stream\nwhy do you care about your stream uh\nthey're they you know they they uh\nit's kind of they like they have my back\neven though i just said that whole story\nabout them not my back but that was like\ntwitter trolls about\nbasketball um in them for the most part\nno they just they they have my back and\nthey they\nshow so much you know love and support\nso\njust the idea of like potentially losing\neven like one percent of that just\nreally upset me\nsure yeah\ncan i think for a second lois yeah go go\nahead\n[Music]\nwho were you six years ago\nuh i don't know how to let me let me let\nme think um\noh no six years ago\nsix years ago i didn't really use the\ninternet like that i would watch like\noccasional youtube\nprank prank videos or something like i\ndidn't really use the internet\num people weren't really streaming i was\ngoing to school\nand i was working at a hospital um\nand then yeah i just i i i found twitch\none day\nand uh you know i've loved it ever since\nyou know what\nwhat do you love about twitch i just\nlove the\nthe the\ni have a lot of like youtube friends and\ni compared to like\nyoutube is cool but like the the thing\nwith streaming is like the instant\nreaction and instant like\nyou know feedback from people um\nit's just it feels more like together so\num yeah i i like i like the\nthe live aspect of streaming\nsure and what kind of stuff do you\nstream lois\num i stream all kinds of stuff i've done\na bunch of stuff over the years like i\ndo a lot of just chatting now\num i do different games\ni'm pretty much all over the place i\ndon't have like a set thing it's more\nvariety\nsure yeah um\nyeah so let me just and when you said\nlike you were kind of feeling like back\nto the depression again i\ni recognize and appreciate kind of your\num desire to be sort of compassionate\nand and sort of not claim that you have\nkind of you know you go through maybe\nthe same struggles that other people\nclinical depression go through\nand at the same time i mean i i think\nthat um\nyou know you're allowed to be depressed\njust because no one diagnosed you right\nyou're allowed to have a bad day and\nfeel down and in the dumps\nyeah and i just wouldn't want to call me\nhaving a bad day like\nwhat people go through just on a daily\nbasis without even anything frustrating\nthough\num you know so that's why i wanted to\nsay that can you\ncan you help me understand when you said\nback to the depression\nwhat you what that felt like to you or\nwhat you call\nbecause you said back to the depression\nso what i'm hearing there is that like\nyou know it's a place where you have\nyou've been before\nit's a place it's a place i've gone\nbefore\ntell me about that place it's just not a\ngood place like it's just the worst\nfeelings you know i mean\num and it's it literally just\naffects my mood it affects like how i\ntalk to people or like interact with\npeople or how so\ni i get really like a short like\nlike um i get like a temper almost or\nlike a\nlike i lose patience easily um\nso like someone could say the most\ninnocent question to me or\nand i could like get offended by it or\nso like you know what i mean so\nit's just like an overall bad mood and\ni'm just like not feeling good\nand yeah and and what what is it like in\nwhat is it that your mind tells you in\nthose moments where someone's like\nbehaving innocently towards you and\nand your mind like turns it into\nsomething else\ni i think it's i'm i'm so annoyed\nthat like just anything even if it is\nthe most innocent thing\nis just i can't handle any more in that\nmoment like i'm too too much stuff is\njust going on in my head\nwhere i'm like i can't even talk i can't\neven talk to you i can't i can't\ni'm with you so so you're encumbered\ngot too much in your inventory yeah i\ndon't know that word but yeah\nokay yeah sorry it's it's like an rpg\ngaming term where\num so like in you know an rpg is like\nyou've got your inventory\nit's got like 30 slots and then what\nhappens is if you have like too much\nweight in your inventory then you like\nwalk slow\nyou know so it's kind of like it means\nthat you're like you're carrying too\nmuch\nand you don't have space for anything\nelse that's really what i'm hearing from\nyou\nyeah and they have no bad intention it's\njust me\nyou know you just can't handle whatever\neven if it's not\nyou know if my inventory is full even if\nsomeone wants to give me like a piece of\npie like i can't hold anymore like i\ndon't have room for your pie\ni understand you're trying to be nice\nbut i don't want your pie\nyou know it's perfect perfect analogy\nand and so what is in your mind that you\ndon't have room for anything else do you\nremember\nwell if i'm thinking on those moments it\nis like a level of like\nworry i think okay because like i said\nyou know the the it's just gonna go back\nto normal like\nthe way my twitch is operated for five\nplus years\njust like the doubt and the just\nworrying\nand hope of that particular situation\nyeah and and what what\nwhere are you afraid of going to\nlike so when i'm here when i hear worry\nyou're like is it going to go back to\nnormal if it doesn't go back to normal\ni imagine that your mind kind of like\nprojects something sort of nebulous or\nmaybe it's even a feeling\nof where would you return to if things\ndid not go well\nit might be like a and i and i\ni think this is an irrational fear but\njust like\noh i have to like restart or like all\nthese years i put into it like what if\nthat was for nothing\njust that kind of that kind of feeling\num what makes you think that's\nirrational\ni think it's irrational because if i\ntake a step back and i think about it\nlike i have all these people who\nwho love and support me so like if\nsomething\nhappened on my notification like that\nwouldn't be the end of the of the world\nsure um i just the fear was like\nmore casual people or people who maybe\nthey don't have twitters and they don't\nknow when i go live or you know what i\nmean like\num just kind of the casual viewer\nbecause i've i've been\npersonally i've been like subscribed to\na youtuber and then gotten like unsub\nfrom them or i don't see their videos\nanymore\nand you kind of just like forget you\nlike forget almost you know\nif you're not like a huge fan of them\nand go seek them out\num so that was like that's like the fear\nof like\nyou you oh wow no one's getting\nnotifications like what are people going\nto just forget\nlike um so that was that's\nyeah that was forgotten before\ni'm sure i'm sure from some people i\nmean\ni can't really i don't know the answer\nthat um okay\ni've never felt forgotten before during\ndoing this twitch\nstuff what about before twitch\ni don't know i don't know maybe some\nfriendships maybe\nokay maybe that's that's the only thing\ni could really think of\nso los i'm gonna go ahead and just pause\nfor a second and kind of like\nrepeat back to you what i'm hearing and\nhow i'm thinking about this conversation\nand then i'd love to hear from you\nwhether you think like we're kind of\nwhether it's accurate whether it feels\nlike it's moving in the right direction\nokay so the first thing is that\num you know you were relatively new to\nthe internet\nsix years ago you discovered twitch\nyou'd been following youtubers and other\ncontent creators it sounds like you\nstarted streaming\nyou really really appreciate kind of\nlike the live interaction the kind of\nfeedback you know it's not like you're\njust\nwatching this thing that like is sitting\non a shelf in the youtube\nyou know data center that will always\nexist there until the end of time it's\nlike there's real people there\nand what i'm hearing from you is that\nlike you've really come to appreciate\nyou're not like\nreally streaming for you what i'm really\nfeeling is that it's not really about\na particular game or a particular kind\nof thing you know some streamers like\nhave their\nthing like i have like a thing that i\nstream for right\nlike i'm like a one-trick pony and and\nwhat i hear from you is that for you\nit's really about like the community and\nthat like you've built a group of people\nthat you really enjoy interacting with\ni would imagine you support them quite a\nbit it sounds like they certainly\nsupport you quite a bit\nyeah um and and then sometimes what\nhappens is like\nlike things will start to happen and\nyou'll kind of get frustrated\nand what i'm hearing is that frustration\nis sort of built on\nkind of a loss of control and this is\ngoing to be kind of an important nuance\nbecause i don't think it's a lack of\ncontrol i think it's a loss of control\num and that you've sort of worked really\nhard to get to where you\nare uh you know you've\nand the thought of like losing something\nbeing forgotten\num the thought of like building\nsomething up\nand having that taken away from you and\ni think that's kind of like a subtle\ntheme that i'm hearing here is that it's\nnot about the lack of something\nit's like i'm gonna put all my energy\nand effort into building the stream\nbuilding this community and then it's\ngonna get like\ni'm gonna lose it and yeah\nand and those kinds of thoughts are kind\nof floating around in your head\nand i'm also hearing that you actually\nhandle those thoughts pretty well\ni know it sounds weird but like that you\ncan manage that you recognize that\nyou're feeling down you're feeling\nfrustrated you have a short temper\nthose thoughts kind of occupy your space\nbut you can hold them right like you can\nhandle that\nand then it's really like this\nadditional stuff piled on top\nthat really feels too much\nwhether it's other conversations\nwhether it's twitter trolls i'm really\nkind of getting this\nthis sense of like straw that broke the\ncamel's back where like you can handle a\nlot of frustration\nbut then you kind of reach your breaking\npoint and then then\ni think this kind of goes back to your\noriginal question which is why is it\nthat some days the\ntwitter trolls bother me and some days\nthey don't what i'm sort of hearing from\nyou\nis it kind of depends on how much you're\ncarrying at the start of that day\nyeah i yeah that's\nand one thing i before i lose before i i\ndon't want to get off the\ntrain of thought but i might lose this\num\nwhen i said back to depression the the\nthought of like losing or whatever\nuh recently well not recently but before\nthat like months ago\ni had like the you know when the dmca\nstuff was happening\num i got two dmc strikes i had to delete\neverything i couldn't play music anymore\nso that was like the that was like the\nfirst time i started feeling like that\nthe thought of like oh wow like it could\nactually like i could be banned\nor i could actually lose that for real\nso when this thing happened\nit just brought me back to that same\nkind of feeling um\nso that's i think that's where like i\njust wrote back to depression that's\ni think the back too ah\nyeah that's really important yeah\nso so what i'm almost hearing um lost\nthere is that you sort of had a\ntraumatic experience\nand you're almost like\nit's almost like i know this word gets\ntossed around a lot\nbut it almost feels to me like a trigger\ncould be yeah so so let me explain to\nyou what i mean by trigger which i i\nmean i think the word gets tossed around\nso you know when i work with like\nveterans so i worked with veterans like\nthat were in the iraq and afghanistan\nwar\nand so like they have particular\nexperiences that make them feel a\ncertain way like you know they\nlike someone detonates a bomb for\nexample\nand then what happens is they'll be like\nwalking down the parking lot of a home\ndepot\nand then they'll hear like a truck\nmuffler kind of go bang\nand what happens is like that\nexperience opens up this door in their\nmind where a flood of emotions\nfeelings memories worries like then\nsuddenly\ncomes out and it occupies their mind and\nit's kind of they're\nlike they're transported back there this\nis the idea of a flashback in ptsd\nyeah yeah and then like when they're in\nthat state of mind they also feel\nlike their mood is heavily affected they\nhave a short temper\nyou know all kinds of other things but\nand the other interesting thing that\nyou know it's really interesting to hear\nyou say that because\nthe other interesting thing if you\nreally look at ptsd i'm not saying you\nhave ptsd i'm just talking about\nsort of that as an extreme i don't want\nto compare my twitch problems to like\nyeah so so i'll explain what i mean by\nthat uh by the comparison and why\nwhy it's important to make but what i'm\nhearing is a is\na similar pattern but a very different\nintensity\nright but like the fundamental\nneuroscience of our brain\nsort of recalling up relevant emotions\nhappens to all of us\nright so you don't you can experience\ntrauma and not have ptsd ptsd is a\nclinical condition\nbut all of us can be traumatized and\nwhether it turns into a full-blown\nclinical\nillness is like a separate thing but you\nknow the mechanism of trauma in your\nmind is the same as the mechanism of\ntrauma\nin someone with ptsd it's the size of\nthe trauma that results in ptsd\nversus not ptsd okay does that make\nsense\nbut what i'm still hearing you say is\nthat like it actually sounds to me like\nyou had sort of a traumatic experience\naround the dmca stuff and then it's like\nthese moments are kind of transporting\nyou back to like\ni could lose it all yeah yeah\nthat's like worst case scenario you know\nmindset\nwould you say that um this issue of sort\nof being really frustrated and things\nbothering you does that predate the dmca\nstuff or has that been since the dmca\nstuff\num if we're just going strictly off of\noff of how i feel with twitch i think\num i've been like suspended before\nbut i've never really had that like it\nwas always like 24 hours or something\nlike that\ni never really had the feelings that i\ndo about this and the dmca so i think\ni think the dmc it was the first time\nwhere i was like wow cause i i\nhad to delete all my like clips from my\ntwitch\nand that's like memories i want to you\nknow\nshow my kids one day or something you\nknow what i mean um\nor just always have to look back at yeah\nso it was just like what did you do it\nwas\nduring the dmca thing well\ni was getting i was getting strikes from\nlike\nold clips from like 2017\nstuff like that so the the the solution\nthat was being given to\nall the streamers was yeah delete all\nyour twitch and all your clips and bonds\num so i did i did it because i was like\nall right well\nthese are memories but i'd rather not\nlose my entire\nchannel um so i had to make that\ndecision\nbut you know and then even after that\ndecision it's like okay well now\nyou got to worry about you can't play\nanything copyright in your stream\nbecause then\nthree strikes are out like you'll get\npermabed so that was just like a\nconstant\nyou know stressful thing too um\nso yeah that's those are just two things\ni've dealt with with on the twitch\nside so from a dmca standpoint i mean i\nunderstand you had to delete\nthose those vods and clips and whatnot\nbut\ni'm going to kind of ask you a question\nagain in sort of a slightly different\nmanner like what did you what did you\nlose right so you said memories\nlike you talked about showing these\npotentially to your kids\none day yeah i mean you know\nit's it's just them all\nit was like i could always look back\nfrom where it started\ni can go to like you know what was i\ndoing in 2018 2019 like i can go through\nthese\nand now it's really just um you know i\njust gotta hope that there's like clips\nor videos on youtube somewhere and\nyou know that's that's that's what\nthat's\nthat was um what i lost was that it's\nall in one place on my channel\ni could look back people could look back\npeople can go to the beginning\nyou know what's the value of going to\nthe beginning being able to look back\noh man i mean\nthe same reason people have peop you\nknow people\nhad uh um what's it uh what's it called\nwhat's it when when i it's like an old\nthing people take pictures and they have\nlike a\nwell i don't know what it's called i'm\nlike a screen blanking out like a\nscrapbook maybe i don't know\nbut my mom would yeah like a fallout\nyeah i'm dumb\num yeah like you know people make photo\nalbums same reason people take pictures\nand videos\nwhen they're on vacations or you know\nwhatever like it's the same thing it's\nlike\nthis is my version of that um\nyou know my looking back at friends and\nyou know even family too i've had my\nfamily on here\nyeah so it's you know the memories just\nkind of just hadn't had to get rid of\nthem to you know save the channel\nyeah yeah so los i'm going to ask you a\ncouple of really hard questions because\nthey're really really simple and really\nreally fundamental\nand i think you're giving good answers\nso\ni think it's interesting because what\ni'm hearing from you is that you had to\nsacrifice your history\nfor your survival\nright like you had to give up like\nyou know we all care about like albums\nand where we came from\nin our journey and that's like an\nimportant part of who we are\nand what i'm hearing you say is that you\nreally had to like\naxe it you know yeah\nyeah what was it what did it feel like\nto do that\num it was really just a\nsad feeling it was just sad i like\nyou know i didn't cry or anything like\ncrazy\ni just was just really upset about it\nand uh\nit kind of happened really quick so i\ngot one strike and i didn't really\nthink anything i was like all right\neveryone gets like a strike but then\nlike i got a second one i was like oh my\ngod like i gotta act now\nyou know so it was kind of just like i\njust it was like\ndo or die type thing um\nso yeah i just had to do it yeah it just\ndidn't feel good and\ni don't know and then just looking at my\nchannel after that\nit just like felt weird because you know\nlike you can click your top\nclips and it shows like it's it'll be\nlike a clip from last year two years\nwhatever\ni just had none of that so i just i\ndon't know i just felt it just felt\ndifferent\num for the first time in like years of\nstreaming\nyeah so um\ni'm noticing you're using words like sad\nweird and different\nso what we're gonna try to do is is you\nknow especially as men\nand especially on platforms like twitch\nlike we don't have a very\nlike we're not really taught good\nemotional vocabulary\nso if it's okay with you lose i'm going\nto try to toss out a couple of words and\nmaybe maybe we can explore\nwhat is weird and different is that okay\nso the first thing is you know i had a i\nhad a patient once who was kind of\ntelling me about like\nfurniture that got repossessed from\ntheir house\nand like that sounds kind of weird but\nwhat i'm hearing from you kind of\nreminds me of that conversation where it\nwas like\ni remember talking to that person it's\nlike the creditors came in\nand like this was their home right this\nis what they had like built up and\naccrued\nand like one day people showed up and\nthey started like\nunplugging televisions and like taking\nthem out of the house\nand they started taking like furniture\nand it's awful and and i know that\nyou're very sensitive about making\ncomparisons about\nyou know how bad you have it versus how\nbad other people have it i respect that\nwe'll get to that maybe\nbut what i'm sort of what i'm sort of\nenvisioning is like when you look at\nyour top clips and it's like\nit's all empty it actually reminds me\nthat conversation\nthat i had with that person years ago\nabout like you sort of you know walk\ninto your\nthis space that you spent six\nyears of your life like creating these\nmoments and like someone has come in and\nlike\nlike they're like movers are coming in\nand like you're like deleting these\nclips and it feels empty\nlike what i'm hearing is really a\nfeeling of emptiness\nand loss yeah\nis that how you feel yeah that's how i\nfeel\nand um you know a lot of people were\nlike oh you could like save\nclips and stuff and like i saved a few\nclips but\ni mean we're talking about like\nterabytes worth of\nyou know data or whatever clips whatever\nso i just i didn't have that luxury i\njust had to just delete\num so it's but even if i could save all\nof them\ni would still in a way feel the same way\nbecause it's just it's not out there for\nanyone to look at or like right where it\nwas\num i'd have to like go into like files\non the computer and like look at like\ni don't know like just like random dates\nor something it's just\nit's different it's just different um\nso yeah that's yeah i'm hearing that\nthose\nthose clips don't just exist for you\nyeah yeah they're not just for me it's\nnot just for me no those are moments\nthat you had with your community that\nare that are sort of important for them\nand like important to be shared and\nthings like that\nthat's six years of classic funny\nmoments\njust you know just things that\nyeah it's in the moment and uh yeah\nthey're just they're gone\nhow does it feel talking about this\ndude like it like it kind of sucks like\nnow i'm thinking about it\nlike damn yeah like uh\ni've been kind of like just trying to\nlike pretend that that didn't happen\nbut i mean you know in reality it did\nand\nand i think this might sound kind of\nmessed up but like i feel like if\nevery single streamer if this happened\nto everyone it'd be like oh damn okay\nlike we're all in this together type\nthing like everyone had to delete\neverything\nbut like i see all these people who you\nknow this didn't happen to them and\nyou know people have always been playing\nmusic and stuff like that so\ni i i know that sounds kind of messed up\nbecause i'm like i don't\nwish this on anyone but i'm just like i\nfeel like\ni would you know me and then other\npeople were like\nthe ones that you know had to pay for\nthis and\nyou know other people it didn't affect\nthem and it's like\ni don't know i don't know if that's like\na way to look at it but i'm just like\ndamn like\nyou know why couldn't i get lucky you\nknow what i mean\nsure and not have it in me um\nso yes so here's here's what i'm hearing\nand i i i'm glad\nlos i'm really glad you shared that\nbecause i i see where you're coming from\nin terms of like\ni'm i'm definitely not hearing from you\nthat you wish that other people had\ngotten screwed too\nwhat i'm really hearing from you is is\nthat you actually kind of feel like\nalone and isolated\nyou know and and that you sort of don't\nhave someone to go\nthrough this with\nwhat do you think yeah yeah i mean i've\nseen\nother streamers that they had to to do\nthis but it's it's kind of\nit's it's people i don't even know it's\nlike\na few people that i've even seen like on\ntwitter or something\num but people that i'm close with and\nother streamers i really know like that\nreally\ndidn't this didn't even affect them yeah\nso what's it like to have you know\npeople that you're close with not be\nable to understand what you're going\nthrough\nnot being able to talk about it with\nthem oh man well\nyeah that's that's something i've dealt\nwith for a while because\nyou know up until recently kind of\nstreaming and youtube internet\ntype stuff was kind of tab not taboo but\nlike kind of like\npeople didn't really understand it or\neven want to understand it so\na lot of problems i would have or like\nissues or\nuh things i'd i'd feel because of the\nstream or\ni wouldn't even be able to like talk to\npeople about this to be honest\na select few of my friends knew about it\num\nnow it's get it's getting different more\npeople are getting into it but um\nyeah it's it's kind of that same feeling\nof when i first was streaming\nand not really having anyone to like\ntalk to about like these like\nkind of intricate weird things that\nyeah it's not you know it's not like a\nwell-known\nthing yet yeah\ni can see why the community and and like\nthe love and support of the community\nand the connection with the community\ncan\nfeel so valuable to you because it\nsounds like you know you've\nbeen actually kind of isolated or\nisolation isn't anything new to you\nlet me put it that way yeah yeah i've\ndealt with isolation\nyeah um i'm i'm kind of curious about\nthat but i just want to toss one thing\nout there so i\nyou know i asked you like how does it\nfeel talking about this and you were\nlike\nkind of sucks\nand so let me just explain for a second\nso i think that that\nunfortunately is how it is and i think\nactually that's what healing\nlooks like so in my experience\nwhen we have something really difficult\nhappen to us what our mind tries to do\nis push\nit away and then what happens is like we\nfind\nin and that actually is sort of the\nanswer to your first question which is\nyou know why do i have some days where\nthings bother me and other days where\nthings\ndon't it's because you're carrying\naround all of this stuff in your\nsubconscious\nand so you're kind of at capacity your\narms are full\nand then like you're not really\nconsciously aware of it because you've\nactually\npurposely blocked it away right you try\nto ignore it you try to pretend it's not\nthere\nyou try not to think about it because\nanytime you think about it you just get\nsad\nand so as we push those emotions into\nour subconscious\nwhat they do is shorten our fuse that\nshorten our conscious views\nbecause a lot of that fuse is being\ntaken up by our subconscious does that\nkind of make sense\ninteresting right so like we're shoving\nit all to the side but we're still\ncarrying it mm-hmm and\nand so the process of healing is\nactually bringing it into our conscious\nmind\nsitting with those feelings feeling with\nthose feelings\nand then like letting them go and then\nthe cool thing\nis that like as you suffer that pain\nhere and now\nwe're gonna metabolize it we're gonna\ndigest it\nand then like if you do this for a\nlittle while\nyou'll start snapping at people less\nyeah it's just that's good um and but i\nthink the downside is that like\nyou know you it sounds kind of weird but\nyou you've signed yourself\nup for a certain amount of hurt and so\nwhat we can do is try to process that\nhurt in sort of as healthy\nand minimal of a man manner as possible\nbut you have to work through that energy\nit's like kind of like this weird karmic\nsort of thing\nokay right when when you like when\nyou've built something for six years\nand you have to like go through and\n[ __ ] delete it so that no one can\never see it again\nlike you can't just you know there's\nlike there's a price there's an\nemotional price that you've got to pay\nand we can try to make it yeah and i and\ni felt like\nthis might sound really traumatic and\ni'm not trying to\nagain the comparisons but i feel like\nthere was no\nmorning period if that makes sense i'm\nnot trying to compare again anyone who's\nlost\nsomeone or any you know any pad or\nanything\nuh you guys say that word where is it\nit's grief can you see it i don't know i\ndon't know\nyeah yeah yeah right so i think that's\nwhat we're talking about\nyeah cause i feel like it happened and\nthen it was like\nyou know the when the people come to my\nstream they wanna you know they just\nwanna be entertained and\nyou know they don't wanna talk about you\nknow like sad things like oh i'll never\nbe able to see the clip from three years\nago that i love there's you know what i\nmean\nso like i would i just had to like after\nthat just snap into like okay now i\ngotta just stream and act like\neverything's fine\nmeanwhile uh all the clips are gone i\ncan't play any music\nwhich i've been playing for years on the\nstream it's a big you know music is a\nhuge part of\nmy life and a lot of people's life um so\nit's just and then and then i had to\nlike be you know in stream mode\nentertainment mode um\nand i and i think uh i think i had some\nstreams where i was kind of\nout of it um because of that\ni think and uh\nyeah because there was no really\nmourning or anything like that people\njust like oh that sucks but like all\nright entertain\nentertain now you know dance monkey\ndance yeah\nyeah which they don't mean that listen\nyou guys in the chat like i know like\nthey don't mean it they just that's what\nthey they you know they want to be\nentertained\nyeah well when they come in so i know it\nsounds kind of weird but i i think that\nthe biggest person who's telling you to\ndo that is not\nyour chat it's you\nhmm you think\nyeah right because when you say you\ndidn't have time to mourn who wouldn't\nlet you mourn\nthat that is true that is true but then\nso why is that then\nyou know like why i don't know\nwhy did i not want to mourn or i don't\nknow well i think a couple of things\nright so\nhere's what i would say one is that\nyou tried to push it away because it\nhurt to sit with it\nwhich is a completely normal thing so no\none wants to mourn\nit's just we have to second thing is\nthat i can imagine that you know\nwhen your channel takes a hit\nyou have a voice inside you which is\nresponsible for your success which is\nbasically telling you to dance monkey\ndance\nand on some days you know\nit it's i mean we all carry it like i\nhave it too\ntoday is actually one of those days oh\nno and and so but like that's that's\nit's what we sign up for\nright it's like there's like it's the\ncommitment that we make it's like\nit's not just streamers like we all like\na lot of times our harshest\nharshest critics or the people who don't\ncut a slack\nis ourselves true like it's really\nfascinating and really sad that like you\nknow you'll cut slack to your friends\nlike if your friends have a bad day if\nthey get fired\nif they get dumped you know there's\nother fish in the sea\nlike you know you'll be okay like you're\na good guy but like when you get dumped\nlike what does your mind tell you\nexactly yeah right yeah\nand so because i i i i hear you it\nsounds like your community is awesome\nand super supportive and they like care\nabout you a lot but like you hold\nyourself to a standard\nwhen your channel gets a hit and your\nmind starts telling you\nyou know this could be the beginning of\nthe end that's when you're like\ni don't get to mourn i don't take a\nbreak i just lost all my clips i can't\nlose\nbeing high energy on stream too\nyeah uh\nyeah i i was gonna say something i\ncompletely forgot\ntotally fine let me actually i'm gonna i\nhave a notepad so i can\nif i remember something\nokay all right um\nyeah so i think what's it gonna\ni'll i'll i'll come back to it i'll i'll\ntry to remember it but yeah we can\nwe can keep going um you know i think\nthose are great points i think those are\ngreat points\nand it's like i don't even what you're\nsaying i don't even think about that\nyou know like it's just like okay i turn\non the stream i gotta stream\nit's like it's just like instinctual\nnow when i turn on stream i gotta be you\nknow\na certain way yeah um\nyeah so that's yeah so so you kind of\nsay\ninstinctual i would toss out a slightly\ndifferent word i would say habitual\nissue okay yeah right and i think\nbecause that's what you've\ntrained yourself to do and\nand i think so this is where like i\nthink part of the reason that you know\nwe we have talks like this loss is\nbecause i think that like\nit's my belief that actually the most\nsuccessful loss\nand and the the lows that your chat kind\nof i mean they love you in all\nin all of your dimensions but i think\nthat like what we come here to do\norganically on twitch happens the best\nwhen you're the healthiest and happiest\nand part of that involves learning how\nto break some of these habits and\nlearning how to take time for yourself\nlearning how to sit with some of that\nnegativity processing some of that\nnegativity\nyeah and as you work through that stuff\ni think that like basically\nstuff will slip under the armor less\nyeah you know what i feel that a lot\nwith\nis when when i am\nlike when i'm like working out all the\ntime eating good and stuff and i'm\nfeeling good\ni feel amazing on stream but i recently\ngot like a\nlike a back injury so i haven't been\nable to really work out i've just been\nlike kind of like\ni've been like lazy on all the you know\nthe eating good all this stuff\nso like there'll just be days when you\nknow like if you eat bad and like you\njust feel\nbad some days um i i know people in the\nchat can relate to that\nlike that'll that'll be another thing\nthat kind of like um\nwill just it'll just make me mad i'm not\neven mad about like comments\nit's like me being like mad at myself\nabout\nlike oh well you could have easily\njust eaten good today and you know or\nworked out today and you would feel\ngreat but you decided to\neat a burger you know what i mean um\nso that's like this similar thing to\nlike\nhaving frustration build up that's like\nsomething else in that day i was also\nfeeling that too\ni remember um so it was literally like\neverything possible happened in one day\nyeah so yeah\nso it sounds like you beat yourself up\ni was completely beating myself up my\ngirlfriend was like why are you doing\nlike why are you\nyou know being like so hard on yourself\nyou know and i was just like oh you\ndon't understand like whatever\ntell us tell us what what your mind was\ntelling\nyou that she didn't understand\ni just i just think it was it's kind of\nlike um\neven if i try to explain in great detail\ni just feel like there's no way to\nexplain\nhow much like the stream and this stuff\nlike means to me\nyou know what i mean like i i feel like\ni could go on for 30 minutes trying to\nexplain it but there it would really it\nwouldn't really do it justice\nyeah so here here's what i'm hearing no\nmatter how hard you try\nno one will be able to understand\nwhy i have to get that deep though like\ni i don't is it that deep i don't know\nis that what the feeling is\ni mean i think for this particular thing\ni think it's fine yeah so\nso let's learn how to be non-judgmental\nwith our feelings okay like i i asked\nthat question you're like [ __ ]\nlike why does it have to be like if\nthat's what you feel like let's call it\nwhat it is bro like then we can work on\nit\nokay yeah i'm down i'm down and so so\nhere's\nhow so like i know this is gonna sound\nkind of weird maybe we can ask chat\nbecause this is sort of a read my mind\nquestion and i i'm just gonna throw you\nsome real\nyou know curveballs here fastballs\nso like what is the word that we use to\ndescribe someone\nwho no matter how hard they explain no\none will be able to understand\nmisunderstood that's a good one not the\none that i was thinking of but that's\nactually probably a more accurate term\nokay right right so i'm not hearing that\nyou're misunderstood\nsubtly uh like it's not that you're\nmisunderstood\nit's not that she understands one thing\nand that's the wrong thing it's that she\ncan't understand\nright she's never gonna be able to\nunderstand\nyeah and so what i'm really hearing\nthere is like you're alone\ni i i i think alone\nwith i think it goes back to what we\nwere saying about like those feelings\nabout having people to relate to them so\nit's like she doesn't do any of this\nshe's not a streamer she\nshe's not in that world you know so\nif i'm talking to her about this or she\nor she's like oh what's wrong it's like\ni just feel like there's no real\nlike point to like explain\nthe whole i don't know i don't know that\nsounds kind of messed up saying it out\nloud but\ndon't judge just say it we'll work\nthrough it no yeah i just feel like\nyou know it's\nit's something that i can't i just can't\nexplain it's\ni don't know i don't know i don't know\nwhat it is i don't know i don't know how\nto\ndescribe it that's what you're that\nyou're i don't know i don't understand\nright that's what i'm here for so so i\nthink you're doing a great job lose\ni think you're describing it way better\nthan you think you are\nokay so i think this is a confusing\nthing\noh [ __ ] this is gonna be weird but\nyou're actually describing it very well\nbut remember that there's a voice in\nyour head\ntelling you that no one can understand\nokay so you think that you're not\ndescribing it well\nyeah but the very voice in your head\ntells you\nno one can understand so like you can't\ndescribe it properly\ndo you see that yeah\neven now it's acting in this\nconversation where\nyou feel like your words are\ninsufficient to convey\nwhat you're going through why is that\nbrilliant questions from right so this\nis where like now we get\nto like answers okay so tell me what it\nwas like\nwhen you started streaming and people\ndidn't understand what you did\noh man i had a lot of i had one i had my\nbest friend\nat one point um\nand my cousin i remember i'll never\nforget this it was\ni think i had been streaming for like\nmaybe a year um\nand they and we were in a pizzeria and\nthey were like what are you doing with\nthis like\nbecause because i wouldn't i would stay\nin most nights and stream\na lot of people be going out doing stuff\nand i'd i'd stay in i\ni you know what are you doing with this\nlike this is gonna die in like a year or\ntwo like you need to like you know\nyou know focus on uh you know what's\nimportant and stuff like that\nso a lot of people who weren't\nin the streaming or youtube internet\nworld whatever\nthey just didn't understand it um\nso and then and then it would be like\nyou know i have a girlfriend now but\nbefore her\nany girl who i would talk to\nit was almost impossible like trying to\nget them to understand like what exactly\nyou know i i did to the point where i\nwould even\ni i i would just lie at that point and\njust be like yeah no i do stocks online\num i'm like a i'm a day trader\nuh i would just say i'm into like\ntechnology i do like\nstuff on the computers because it was\njust it was just too like\ni don't feel like explaining this whole\nthing every time i meet so you know what\ni mean\nnow i do feel like it's it's getting\nmore well-known but i just think\nyeah there was there was a long period\nof time where it was just like\nyou know not a lot of people really\nunderstood\nso lois it's not that a lot of people\ndidn't understand\nwhat i'm hearing this is what i want you\nto think about what does it do to\nsomeone\nwhen the closest people to them\ndon't understand can't understand won't\nunderstand\nwon't try to understand i i think it's\nsomething where it's\nit's like you wanna\nyou wanna relate with the people you're\nclosest with about like\nyou know everything i think you know\nyeah so if you can't relate about a\nmajor thing\nin your life it kind of makes like a\nseparation\nyep or like yeah puts up like a little\nlittle wall or something\nyep yeah is that how you feel\nis that how you felt when you got dmcad\nand your close streamer felt\nfriends didn't um\nyeah yeah i felt like it was\nit was the same like just alone just\ndamn\nyou know damn and uh\ntell me more that's the feeling just\ndamn like this\nyou know this sucks this sucks i wish\nthis didn't happen to me\nyou know that kind of feeling what did\nyou wish\ni mean just\nthat it didn't happen you know yeah and\ni think this is where we get to some of\nthe things where\nyou know this is going to sound kind of\nmessed up i'm going to repeat back some\nof your words but like in a weird way\nlike\nyou wish that it happened to them too\nlike not because you wanted them to hurt\nthem but you wish that there was someone\nout there\nthat could understand that could get\nover that wall\nyou know like it was on your side of the\nwall\nif this happened to one of my close\nstreamer friends or someone even someone\ni remotely knew\ni'm sure we would have had like you know\nconversation about this and\nthat would have probably helped you know\nyeah something like that i'm sure we\nwould have many conversations\num and but that just didn't happen\nand i just felt like damn like i just\nsee everyone like having so much fun\nlike like business as usual nothing\nhappened and then i'm just over here\nlike damn\nyou know yeah you know my whole stream's\nchanged in a\nin a heartbeat you know\nso i i want to kind of go back to you\nknow people are curious about\nwhere a lot of our psychological\npatterns come from\num you kind of said i'll never forget\ndot dot like you said there it was like\ny'all were in a pizzeria\nwith your best friend and one of your\nother friends like you'll never forget\nthat moment i'll never forget it because\nthey\nactually now to this day they brought\nthat back up like wow remember when we\nsaid\nwe said that and you know now look at\nyou um and then\nhow does that conversation go\nthat conversation was just like you know\ni'll kind of sometimes be like i told\nyou like i\ni i wouldn't be wasting my time doing\nsomething i didn't believe in or you\nknow\njust stuff like that how do you feel\nthis hard question loss\nhow do you feel when they say remember\nthat conversation in the pizzeria\ni feel proud that i did that it didn't\ngo that way\nyep that they what else do you feel\nuh i feel a sense of accomplishment\nnow this is where i get to be an\narrogant prick\nokay because i'm going to assume for\nmost of the time i listen\nand i'm like oh lois how do you feel bro\ntell me your feelings this is where i'm\ngoing to tell you\nhow i think you feel and if you say you\ndon't feel this way i'd say you're in\ndenial\nokay i think you i think you feel pissed\nelaborate well because like\nit's not just about pride and\naccomplishment right it's like you\n[ __ ] like i was trying to explain\nthis to you back then\nand i needed y'all to understand and\nlike now you guys are joking about it\nbut like that conversation wasn't funny\nyeah yeah yeah\nyeah i i yeah i agree\nbecause i do remember in that moment\nbeing like damn like\nyou know i i would hope i would i i\nwould wish\nwhen i'm one of my best friends my\ncousin would believe\nin me you know what i mean um but i\ni in that moment i didn't have that\nsupport\nyep yeah and so then sure like i get\nthat there's this\ni'm not trying to say damn this much\nit's just i honestly my reaction is damn\nthat's just my reaction to a lot of\nthings i ignore\nso like this this is where like i think\nwe've got to be like this is part of\nthat processing right because like\nhere's what i'm hearing like it sort of\nmakes sense you're kind of like\nmacho these are your bros and you're\nlike i showed you [ __ ]\nyou know i was right all along like i\nget that\nbut there's like a subtle underside to\nthat coin which is like\nwhen i needed y'all to believe in me\nlike sure i showed you that you were\nwrong but like\nit's not a competition where you show\nthem who's wrong like\nthey're joking about it and they're like\nyou see how stupid we were like i get\nthat there's value there but there's\nlike\na subtle other thing which is like i\ndon't need you to believe in me now\nlike i have three million followers on\ntwitch\nwhat i needed you to do was believe in\nme back then\num yeah\nwhat do you think about that um\ni i think that i wasn't even\ni don't think that i even thought um\ni had that feeling until you kind of\njust said that and it's kind of\nit it's kind of like in my head's like\nyeah it would it would have felt a lot\nbetter\nback then when i was trying to do this\nto have more people\nyou know support and understand it yeah\num so i even i had another friend who\num really kind of just like roasted this\nwhole thing\nand now you know they've\nrecently visited my new house and\nthey're like\nthis this is from the streaming i'm like\nyeah\nand and now now they now they're so\ninterested i'm getting a hundred\nquestions about it now\nbut you know back then it was it was a\ndifferent thing it was like yo why\naren't you coming out like why aren't\nyou coming out tonight like\nand uh yeah so\nbut you know i don't i don't think i'm\npissed i don't think i'm pissed\ni i think it would\nit would have been nice to have\nmore support but i'm i'm glad the way\nfor the most part things worked out you\nknow yeah so lois i think that's an\nincredibly mature way of looking at it\nyou know i commend you for\nbeing a better human than i um\nand and and so and at the same time i\nthink that like\nyou know if you really want to let some\nof this stuff go if you ask you ask me\nthe question like why does my mind do\nthat like this is the way that you undo\nit because i think there is a part of\nyour mind\npissed maybe not but i think that\nthere's certainly a part of your mind\nthat felt\nhurt by their lack of faith\nright and oftentimes anger\nactually has its root in being hurt\nand so i think it's easier to detect for\nmost people\nit's easier to detect the anger than it\nis for them to detect the hurt but if\nyou're able to follow that anger down to\nthe hurt\nit makes sense to me that you're not\nactively pissed because usually\nanger masquerades like right it's like\nif if i get you know\nif if my significant other my girlfriend\nsays something like that is very hurtful\nto me like i'm gonna get mad at her\nright it's just like it's how we respond\nto being hurt like when when you hit me\nlike i'm gonna hit back\nand so i i think i know this sounds\nreally really bizarre but like\num you know at some point it may be\nworthwhile like having\nsort of a conversation where you like\nlet some of this go\nand this can sound hard but like\nsometimes it's like actually sitting\ndown with those people and saying like\nyou remember that conversation in the\npizzeria like\ni was really trying something new and i\nwasn't sure of myself but i thought i\nwas onto something\nand like i really felt like y'all\nyou know you guys were trying to do the\nbest that you could\nbut at the same time i felt like really\nhurt and isolated and like i was trying\nto share this part of my life with you\nand i needed some\nhelp and support and i sort of like\ndidn't get it\nand but do you think too that they maybe\ncould have been\nactually they thought they were looking\nout for me sure\nabsolutely i think they they did think\nthey were looking out for you\nand that's why you guys need to have a\nconversation you can acknowledge that\nlike i think i\neven now if you go back and watch the\nbot i think i said y'all did the best\nthat you thought you could\nand it still hurt right and i think that\nlike\nacknowledging that is really healthy\nyou're not necessarily blaming them\nwhat you're doing is like remember the\ngoal here\nis not to like blame or fix things i\nknow it sounds weird lois but the goal\nis to take down\ndown that wall that's between you and\nother people\nand put taking down that wall i'll just\nkind of give you a quick example so\ni was uh working with a a family\nactually so the\nparents have one special needs child and\none\nneurotypical child and like what what is\nneurotypical\nlike non-special needs like regular kid\nokay okay\nokay so they've got like one kid with uh\nyou know something like autism\nand one regular kid and so um\nuh you know like when the kids were\ngrowing up like the parents had to spend\na lot more time\nwith like the special needs kid\nunderstandably so\nand like the family couldn't go on\nvacations and stuff because like the kid\ncouldn't handle a flight\nand so you know for the other kid it's\nlike you know their fam like you know\nall their friends are going on vacation\nlike they're going to summer camp and\nthings like that and like he like missed\nout on a lot of opportunities because\nhis parents had to take care of the\nspecial needs kid\nand it's not like the parents could have\ndone much different like maybe they\ncould have done a little bit different\nand and even the you know the the normal\nkid\nunderstands that the parents were trying\nto do their best\nand it's still hurt yeah\nright so there doesn't have to be blame\nfor there to be an acknowledgement of\nhurt\nand having that conversation where he\nsays like\nyou know i wish we could have done these\nthings growing up\nand i really felt like hurt and like i\nfeel like i didn't have a regular\nchildhood\nand it's really hard but having his\nparents sit with that and say like\nyeah we're sorry that we couldn't do\nmore for you we probably could have done\nmore and we\nprobably could have done a better job\nbut both parties sort of acknowledged\nthat like everyone was sort of doing the\nbest that they could\nand it wasn't enough but when it comes\nto feeling connected\nyou know hearing his parents say\nlike acknowledge that we sh we're sorry\nwe couldn't do more for you and that you\ndeserved more\neven though we did our best yeah\nand that really like helps people like\ncome together\nthat's true i i yeah i never really\nthought to sit down like actually talk\nabout it with them but um because i'm\nwith me like i'm more of like when it\nwhen it comes to like really like\nlike serious or like deep things i kind\nof try to approach things in like a\ncasual way cause i'm like i don't i\ni don't like being like all right let's\nsit down let's we gotta talk like i\ndon't like being like that\ni i don't know why i just i don't want\nto be so serious\num but yeah i i next time\nyou know yeah i mean because like and\nthis is where like we can keep going as\nfar back as you want to we don't we\ndon't know anything about you before you\nturn 20.\nbut this is where like you know wide are\nyou like that probably because there\nhave been experiences in your life\nthat taught you that that's like really\nhard\nbecause if we think about it being\nreally authentic and vulnerable with\nsomeone is taking that wall down mm-hmm\nright and so we know why you have the\nwall now like that wall was really built\nin that pizzeria\nyou know six years ago yeah\nuh you know yeah right yeah and then you\nadded more\nbricks on top during the dmca thing\nfor sure and then if we really think\nabout it like\nwe come back to the internet trolls and\nlike in those moments like what is it\nthat really bothers you\nit's that like you felt like there were\nfewer people defending you than\nattacking you which once again\ni think is like feeling alone it's like\nthere's so many people coming at me\nand like where is everyone that was\nsupposed to support me\nyeah yeah it's like\nand i know it sounds dumb like just you\nknow i brought this up on stream\nin in like a rage and people were just\nlike wow you're really hurt that like we\ndon't agree with your basketball take\nand it's just like it's so much like\ndeeper than that\nit's if you want to look at it like that\nand be like an [ __ ] about it\nthen that's cool but yeah yeah\nwell sorry for for interrupting i really\nshouldn't do that when you're on a roll\nbut\nlike that's exactly it right it's like\nthey don't connect with\nyou mm-hmm\nit's like they they it's like holy crap\nman like just what you said is like\nthat's it's the pizzeria all over again\nit's i'm not trying to laugh at that\nit's just\nyeah no no but seriously it's like\nyou're trying to tell people what your\ntake is\nand they're like hey bro you really\nshouldn't be doing it that way and like\nall these trolls on the\nthe internet are like they're they're\nnot listening to you\nthey're like listening to like they\nthink it's about lebron it's not about\nlebron it's about like it's about you\nyeah and and you know this\ndid i i want to go on here and not get\nso\ncrazy deep but like there's one thing\nthat is pretty deep that i'll share\nbecause and i don't\ni think i've said this on stream before\nbut um\nthere was there was a time when\ni literally put on my wall in my bedroom\ni put like believe in me\ni know that sounds really corny but it\nwas at a time in high school where\ni was i was playing basketball and i\nlike did bad in\na couple classes and like i was like\nmight not be able to play\nand i was really upset like my parents\nwere like mad and upset\nand i was just like no no i'll you know\ni'll fix this or something and and i\njust was so i was just like really\nemotional\nand i just like put like believe in me\non my wall because i was just like\nbecause i could sense they kind of like\ndoubted\nthat like i could like turn it around or\nsomething and uh\nit was um that i think i was like a\nsophomore in high school\nand um yeah they basically said like\nyeah you have to get\nyou know do good on like this this this\nall these tests to like get your grade\nback to passing and i did it and i\naccomplished it but\ni just in that moment i felt like damn\nlike no one like believed in me\nyou know so i i i think when\nmaybe subconsciously when people don't\nbelieve in me like the pizzeria or you\nknow like when i'm giving my opinion\ni i i'm just like it's like a\nfrustrating thing i think i think it's a\nfrustrating thing\nwhen um i'm so when i get like so\ndoubted\nor so like disagreed with because um\ni don't know i don't know why but that's\njust\nyeah that's just like a thing that's in\nmy head um\nyep i'm with you bro because you didn't\nwrite\nbelieve in yourself on your wall\nno you wrote believe in me\nyou're talking to someone else that\nmessage was not for you\nit was for other people yeah yeah\nlike i said i think this starts before\nyou turn 20.\nso thanks for sharing that well yeah\nthat was definitely but yeah i was like\ni think i was like 15.\nwhen that happened um\nyeah thinking more into it i think i'm\nnot trying to cut you off\num i think it's like a\nfeeling of not wanting to\nlike let people down\ni think can i try to massage that a\nlittle bit\nyeah go ahead i think the weird thing\nthe weird thing about you was so i think\na lot of people don't want to let other\npeople down\ni think the cool thing about you is that\nit's not just about letting\npeople down it's actually knowing that\nyou're not gonna let them down\nbut them not being able to see it\nwell interesting\ninteresting\nis it kind of like a thing like i'll\nlike i'll show you type of thing\nor that because that's so wrong well i\nmean that's what you've had to do\nover and over and over again\nnowhere throughout all of this deep\nexploration\nam i actually hearing you doubt yourself\nyeah that's yeah that's true that's\ncrazy right\nit's really interesting it's really\ninteresting\ni don't know you're letting me like just\nsit in the moment or just yell it over\nbut\nthat's that's an interesting\nway to look at it\nyeah because yeah i mean there's there's\nthere have there's just been times of\npeople doubting me but\ni tr i truly have not doubted\nlike myself i don't know maybe i'm just\nhave blind delusion or\nhave like this like um just don't\ndevalue it\ni'll do whatever it takes type thing i\ndon't know i don't i don't i i don't\nknow\nwhat what causes that or would but\nyeah i think i've had to do it a lot in\nlife\ninteresting\nman i didn't want to see i didn't want\nto check this deep\ni'm you're good dude you're good\ni don't\ni don't know as i don't know how i don't\nknow what you mean by that like you\nyou're saying\nlike i you're good at what you do i know\nokay okay i i i i because sometimes\npeople say like you're good like it's\nokay keep going\nright oh no it's like oh no no yeah i i\ncouldn't tell if\nand then also like i didn't want to get\nthis deep and then i'm confused because\ni\ni don't know if i should say i'm sorry\nor you're welcome\nno both are appropriate\nright you know and yeah\nand lois like like so just to be clear\nyou know it takes two to tango\nright so i can only do\nyou know what you let me do and like\nyou're the one\nlike you're the one who's like you're\nthe one who's going back right like\nthere are many\nmany times during this conversation\nwhere you could have chosen not to go\ndeep but you you did\nyou know that's true that's true and and\nso the thing is it's like\nthe way what we're talking about is just\nunlocking things\nyou know that i don't really think about\ndaily yeah\nso i think that's where i where i'm at\nlike you're you're good at that\nyeah i am something of a lebron myself\nin what way in doing this yeah\nno yeah no for sure there's more\ntrolling\nyeah just too good of a meme\nto pass up but yeah so i i think you\nknow\nlike i i think there's a certain pacing\nto this i mean if you want to keep going\nand unlocking things i think that's okay\ni think we've\nbasically kind of come up for air i\nthink you've connected a lot of dots um\ni am letting you sit with things a\nlittle bit more now\nyeah and i i think kind of if you want\nto we can talk kind of\ncom come back to the present a little\nbit and think a little bit about how to\nyou know take these revelations and make\nthem a little bit more practical\nokay or we can go deeper you know it\njust sort of depends i feel like we've\nsort of broken the tension at this point\nbut\num whatever you want to do just take the\nlead and i'll\nand i'll try to do my best so so then\ni i think\ni'm getting the sense that while you'd\nbe totally open to go deeper like maybe\nwe can just kind of pause there from\nlike the deep exploration standpoint\nand just come back to your original\nquestion\nwhich is why do i have some days where i\nkind of get frustrated and stuff like\nthis\nso here here's the thing i i think that\nlike now that we've uncovered like\nthis theme right and the theme is sort\nof\na sense of isolation that people don't\ntrust you\ndon't have faith in you and that like\nyou've tried to at times in your life\nlike communicate things to people\nand what you needed in that moment was\nlike their faith and their trust\nand and instead what you got was like\nlike not i mean they weren't like\nabusive or anything right like they\nweren't like mean to you or anything in\nfact they were trying to do their best\nyeah um and they were trying to do what\nwas right for you but they really\nweren't like\nemotionally kind of giving you what you\nneed and then even now you guys kind of\nlike joke about it like your friends\nacknowledge that they were dumb\nback in the pizzeria but like what you\ndidn't need them to be you didn't need\nthem to be\nlike smart you what you needed them to\nbe was like there for you\nand like believe it like as you put on\nyour wall believe in me like that's what\nyou wanted from them\nyeah um and and so now when we kind of\nthink about you know what's gonna\nfrustrate you\ni think it's gonna be like when your\nmind the thing that bothers you the most\nand that's really gonna like transform\nthe way that your mind looks at the\noutside world like whether you can just\nlaugh with the twitter trolls because\neveryone knows like we're all just\nplaying games here\nright i mean maybe some people are\nreally trying to be toxic but\ni think for but but what happens is when\nyour mind starts to feel\nlike oh like i want this person to\nbelieve in me and they're like not\nbelieving in me\nthat's what i want you to look for\nand then that that core feeling is going\nto\nmanifest in all kinds of different ways\nyou're going to have a short temper\nyou're going to crack jokes you're going\nto start putting up walls\nyeah and then those that's what i think\nis\nis another question or if this is the\noriginal but\nwhy like that specifically\nwhy is that bothering me\nso much more than other things like why\nis just\njust not like believing in me or or\ntrusting what i say like why like why is\nthat\ni don't i wish i wish it didn't yeah\nyeah\nlike that yeah yeah so so i my answer is\ngonna sound kind of weird but it's sort\nof like\nyou know why does the iraq veteran\nrespond to the muffler going off instead\nof a dog barking\nit's because that's the experience that\nhurt them\nright so if you think about trauma and\nptsd like for example some you know\nlike female clients that i've had that\nhave been like sexually assaulted\ntheir triggers are going to be different\nfrom the triggers for a war veteran\nokay so inside what personally has has\naffected you\nis what's always going to yeah either\nyeah so like i have a scar like a tiny\nlittle scar i don't know if you guys can\nsee it but i have a\ntiny little scar right here it's barely\nvisible i've tiny little scar\nwhy do i have the scar there\nbecause that's where i got the b bite\nwhen i was like six years old\nright a b yeah it's a beasting\nit left a scar yeah left scar oh well\nyeah so i got a bee sting and it left a\nscar but like why is the scar\nthere and so why does this particular\nthing bother you because that's the\npartic\nthat's it's like a psychological scar is\nthe way that you can think about it\nright and where what determines where\nthis you know what the scar is and where\nit is\ndepends on the injury\nand so we can even go back like even\nfurther than like sophomore year\nbecause now what i'm hearing is like\nthis is some this is a part of you that\nhas been traumatized in this place\nnot just once but twice thrice\nfour times five times six times and so\nwith each particular injury\nlike that scar gets thicker and thicker\nand thicker and bigger and bigger and\nbigger\nand it dominates more of your\npsychological process\nyeah um\ni i think where it's happened\na lot where i could just think of is\num\nmaybe not before i stream well\ndefinitely while i've been streaming\nit's been you know it's been a lot of\ntrolls and a lot of just\nwhatever um you know whatever i say just\nlike complete doubt\nlike when i say when i saw you know i\ndon't want to bring up basketball again\nbut\nit's a easy one but just me saying\nuh just like oh i'll beat this guy\none-on-one or something just everyone\njust completely just\njust doubting it and just being like no\nlike you're bad you're\nexactly just like and like\nthat kind of thing of just like just\ncompletely doubting me and\nand stuff i don't know that is that yeah\nthat just bothers me a lot yeah\num but but then again it's like\nlike i said there's days where a million\npeople could doubt\nwhat i'm saying and it won't even affect\nme so like that's where i'm trying to\nlike\nfigure out like what's well so so so i i\nand and that's where i would we could\ntunnel down further but i\ni don't think that a million people uh\noh actually\nhere maybe here's here's the thing\nbecause i think your\nyour trigger isn't just doubt of people\nit's specifically the closest people\nyeah yeah and so if it's my viewers and\nlike you know\nthe people who support me the most doing\nit yeah it almost\nhurts like a friend in a way it's the\nsame\nkind of hurt it's a hurt loss that\nyou're very familiar with at this point\nyeah right and and so i i think\nas you start to pay attention like what\ni want you to do is like on those days\nwhere you feel\nsad worried your mood is down where\nyou're back to that depression that you\ntweeted about\nwhat i would start with is is there a\npart of me\nthat feels like someone should be\nbelieving in me\nand they're not\nand this is where like i think anger is\nmaybe an easy thing to find because like\nthere's another question that i just\nhave burning in my mind\nwhich is going to be completely out of\ncontext but how many\nfreaking times do you have to prove\nyourself before people start believing\nin you\ni think i man i i think\nthat that's a never-ending\njourney i don't think that there's an\nanswer to that exactly\nbecause that that's because the feeling\nis that they don't have faith in you\nright like do\nyou see that it's not even true it's\njust like as long as that complex that\nlittle nugget\nthat nomad because here's the other like\nflip side of that\nis like no matter what you do\nif it's a never-ending journey it's a\nbattle you can never\nnever win and like just imagine what\nthat's like for you\nlike take a step out of your shoes for a\nmoment what's it like to live a life\nwhere like\nthe people that are closest to you will\nlike never have faith in you\nyeah and i don't i i really don't want\nto think that no one in here\nlike none of my family or friends\nbelieve that all\ni'm just i was giving you the examples\nof the ones that didn't like my parents\nwere supportive\nno no i i i you know so so once again i\nthat's why i'm saying like let's be\nnon-judgmental because i\ni know that you clearly have a fan base\nfamily girlfriend that friends\nstreamer friends that in reality are\nsupportive\nbut what i'm pointing out to you is that\nthere's this like nugget of hardness in\nyour mind\nthat like i asked you this question how\nmany times do you have to do it before\nthey start believing you\nand like you should go and watch the vod\nyou grinned\nand you're like it feels like it's never\ngonna be enough\nbecause and and i man i don't want to do\nthis comparison let me think if i could\ndo a different comparison\ni'll just put it like this i'll put it\nlike this i\nlet me preface this by saying i'm not\ncalling myself like\nanything like i'm not comparing myself\nto these people\ni'm just i i think\na reason why i like lebron is he\nis so hated on and like\nso doubted that i root for him all the\ntime\nto just prove people wrong like yeah\nbecause i've been a fan of him while\neveryone was hating him\nand everyone was you know just\ncompletely [ __ ] on him doubting him\nso that's something i relate to so and\nso some people are like oh wow you're\ngetting mad because people insult lebron\nit's like\nokay but like you dude no bro\nbro you just you just blew the top off\nof this lois\nwhat do you think bro you just brew it\nbecause like\nwhat you're doing is you're like going\nto lebron's rescue\nwhen people are doing to him what they\ndo to you\nbecause in those moments where everyone\nis doubting him\nand he's alone lois is like\nf that i'm not going to let him be alone\nand i'm going to believe in him\ny'all don't understand like you guys\nwant to doubt lebron you all want to be\nhaters\ni've got us back\nthat's that's really crazy\num yeah\nthat's a really therapeutic way to look\nat this it's that's how i can put it\nbecause i've never\nthought about it like that why am i\ndefending him like this\num and i and i think it's just\nyeah i think oh well\nuh i don't know if this is embarrassing\nor if this is like a good\ni don't know what this is to be honest\nuh\ni don't know bro\ni don't know i don't know i don't know\ndo you feel embarrassed\nno i don't feel embarrassed i really\nfeel like wow like that makes a lot of\nsense\nand i also feel like\nthat a lot of i i think of\nwhen i s when i see how i put this\nit only makes me think more like wow\nlike when i when i see\npeople you know who are also on here\ndefending their favorite\nwhoever it is whether it's a musician or\na streamer\nathlete whatever they must have some\nkind of feeling of like\nthat same thing that you said like i\ndon't want like i'll be here to support\nyou you know because they felt\nthan not having support yep before\nand i think that's why you know that's\nwhy there's a lot of\ni don't know like fans of\nwhatever um and you see a lot of people\ndefending and\nyou see like die hard you know accounts\nlike people defending people to the to\nthe end\nyou know because i think you might be\nright i think that's like i think a lot\nof people feel that same thing that i'm\nfeeling\nyeah yeah i think i think your community\nfeels it too\nthat's why i think i think certain\npeople yeah they do come to your rescue\nright\nthey're not going to let lois fight it\nalone\nyou want to throw down with the twitter\ntrolls we'll throw down with you\nand i you know there's something else i\ncould bring up too where\nyou know when it's when a typical stream\nof mine it's it's jokes\npeople trolling but if there's a serious\nthing going on like if there's like\nan actual someone trying to come at me\nor you know like a real thing it's like\na\na switch gets flipped and every single\none of those people\na hundred percent has my back and will\nit literally at\nlike at times it felt like they would\nlike you know take a bullet for me\nyou know what i mean and um\nso that's why i don't get so like upset\nto the poor like oh i quit dude i'm done\nwith this\nbecause i know that when it's for real\nlike that's what keeps me going is like\nyeah you like i could be getting trolled\ntoday but that's because it's about like\nwhat like it's about like\nbasketball stats or you know i mean like\nit's this isn't like an important thing\nbut if it's someone coming at me or\ntrying to threaten me or\nyou know them or like my livelihood or\nsomething like that\ni have all the support um\ni think that's what's going to have\npeople believe in you\noh man i mean and i'm sure you could you\nknow this too like this\nis like it's a it's an amazing feeling\nit's an amazing feeling\num and it's it's a feeling i would love\nto have all the time but i just\nyou know the way\nmy streams are and it's a lot it's a lot\nabout joking around and\nand stuff there's going to be a lot of\ntrolling\nand when there's trolling stuff can go\ntoo far\nand uh you know\nit can get it can get taken too far and\nyeah so lois i'm gonna\nask you how do you feel right now\ni feel ugh man i don't know i don't know\ni feel\ni feel good i feel weirdly good yeah\ni feel yeah i feel oddly good for like\ngetting to the bottom of this\nyou know this is what emotional you\nremember i was telling you\nlike about like sort of dealing with\nthat subconscious emotion that you've\npacked away\nyeah this is what it feels like\nso there's a period of time where you\nsit with that emotion and it feels\nreally\nlike negative and crappy and it's like\nactually i've been trying to avoid these\nfeelings\nand as you work through it you feel the\nway that you do now\nwhich is like not just good but like\nweirdly good\nyou know you kind of feel like lighter\nlike things are clear like nothing has\nreally changed but you like this is\nliterally what emotional\nmetabolism it's like you're taking like\nthis sandwich and your body is like\ntransforming it into your hair in your\nblood\nand your bones and so this is what\nemotional metabolism looks like\nyeah it it gives me like a second\nstrength almost or like a second\nit gives me like\nit uh i don't know just it boosts me\nyeah\nit boosts me yeah good that's what we're\nhere for man\nwhat's okay so then i know you're\nletting me linger\noh no i i was just sorry i\ni mean what now\ni don't know if it's a what now it's\njust kind of like i don't want to\nbefore we get off this if there's\nanything else like you wanted\nyou know i don't want to like leave the\nmoment without\nchecking all the boxes yeah sure so\nlet's talk about let's talk about\npracticalities for a second okay\nso i think the first thing is like some\nof the emotional work has already been\ndone\nso good job i'm glad you're feeling\nbetter right so we've talked through\nsome of this stuff\nyou've understood a lot about the\nconnections now how to move forward i'd\nsay the main thing is that like as you\nkind of just by all means like process\nlike go for a walk or something i highly\nrecommend\nit's what i do after i stream like if i\ncan i'll just like\nwalk for a little while um and just kind\nof like digest and\nand things like that but i think\npractically\nyou know for you i think the key things\nto look out for\nare going to be like this vulnerability\nor this scar like popping up\nand the thing is it's not gonna you know\nthe whole point of doing these like\nrealizing stuff is that\nin your day-to-day experience you didn't\nrecognize that this is what it was\nbut now that you recognize it each time\nit happens you can work through it a\nlittle bit more\nand it'll actually start to free you\nfrom that\nmood in the same way that like we we\nactually\npurposefully brought you to the dark\nplace\nand then you were sitting in the dark\nplace and now we've taught\nyou how to move from the dark place to\nthis other place\nnot by walling it off but by working\nthrough it\nand each time you do that the dark place\ngets a little bit smaller and you get\nbetter at leaving\nit so like for me or for maybe other\npeople in the chat\nif they don't have you to talk to like\nsomeone who's\nclearly professional how do you do that\nwith yourself is there like is it just\nyou know well i mean so because we're\nkind of bouncing ideas off each other\nsure well i mean so so there are ways to\ndo it by yourself i don't think they're\nas effective as working with another\nhuman being yeah which is like\nliterally why i don't know if people\nknow this but we have a coaching program\nat healthy gamer\nwhere we have about 60 coaches that i\nstarted training in november of 2019\nand our coaches are awesome and they do\nthis kind of work with people\nand and i'm also like sort of an\nacademic and and have done a lot of\nresearch and stuff\nso we have like a pretty robust robust\nresearch part of our coaching program\nwhich um so we test outcomes so we\nactually do is like we measure\nthe efficacy of our coaches against me\nactually\nand what we find is that our coaches are\nactually pretty good and our outcomes\nare comparable\num okay and you know i'm not going to\nsay that they're me but like\nit is my belief that if you want to do\nthis work\nhaving someone to bounce ideas off of\nis actually like really really effective\nnow if you want to do it on your own i\nthink this is where like developing a\ngood meditation practice\nor doing some amount of like reflection\nand journaling and like just going for\nwalks\num you know there are other things that\nyou can do but i in my experience\nyou know meditation and journaling isn't\nsomeone\nlike they just they aren't responsive\nright it's sort of like exactly what you\nsaid about youtube versus twitch like\nwhat's the difference like both of them\nhave people talking\nbut one platform is like responsive\nso you move faster than you would on\nyour own\nyeah so practically like you could go\nyou know meditate like go to a\nmeditation retreat or something like\nthat but like the whole reason that we\ndeveloped the coaching program is\nbecause\ni you know i know i'm good and all but\nlike frankly like\nwhat i do can be taught right and that's\nwhat we set out to do is to train 60\nother people\nwe've helped about 2 000 people from the\ntwitch community at this point\nand you know you know and so i think\nthat like you don't have to do it alone\nand the answer isn't to do it alone and\nfor you by the way i don't know if you\nknow this but\nyou know twitch actually like if you\nwant to work with a coach\num twitch is sponsoring that so you can\nassuming you're partnered um yeah\nbut so we have a coaching program where\nwe support our creators\naround creator specific issues so like\nthese things about like you know\nhaving people around you not understand\nwhat you're going through and things\nlike that\nwhat we've heard from a lot of our\ncreator coaches and and even people in\nour\nregular coaching program is that they'll\nactually go see a therapist\nbut the therapist doesn't understand\nthat's yeah um but\nyou know i yeah lois i think that like\nyou can do it on your own i just i mean\nthe reason that we do this is\nbecause i think it's more that's why\nthis is so good and it's just so\ninteresting\nwhat you do because it's so unique\nbecause you understand twitch like you\nyou're a streamer like\nyeah so it's a really like you have the\nperspective\num so when when i do bring up things\nabout dmc\nthis isn't like foreign language to you\nso yeah no i i i appreciate what you're\ndoing i i like i said i\nwatched the show many times and i think\nuh all you guys in the chat should\nfollow if you're not already followed\nbut\nyeah i uh yeah no that's that sounds\nlike a great idea\nsounds great with the coaching are you\ninterested in learning a little bit\nabout meditation i mean you may be\nexperienced or meditate already\ni've nev i don't think i've ever\nmeditated in my life\num i i don't i i\nmight have a slight adhd i'm not\ndiagnosed i don't know\nbut like i'll start reading a book and\ni'll\nbe like reading the book i'll get to the\nsecond page and not know what i just\nread for an entire\nlike that's kind of level so like when i\ntry to sit there in silence\nit kind of just you know just ends in\nlike 30 seconds or something\nare you telling me that you're not good\nat meditation\ni i don't i i i don't know i i think\ni've tried\nbut i it's i believe in you most you\nbelieve\nhey i mean i'll if you have any tips\ni'll i'll i'll try man\nyou know what i'm hearing this is the\nfirst time i'm hearing something\nfrom you which is that maybe you don't\nbelieve in yourself so i'm going to\nchoose to believe in you\nand i'm gonna say that no matter how\nadhd you are i think you can learn how\nto meditate\nokay have you been taught how to\nmeditate\num no okay\nprobably not properly no so this is\nwhere like i'm i'm\nasking you lois do you know how to ride\na bike and you're like well i'm not so\nsure\nmy balance isn't so good i'm like you've\never been did anyone teach you how to\nride a bike you're like not really and\nthen i'm like well\nthat makes it makes sense so so i think\nit's fine if you're a little bit adhd\nso i'm going to give you a choice okay\nand what we can also do is try two\ntechniques\nif you want to today i'm going to give\nyou a choice one\nis going to be sort of like an\nintroductory technique that'll get you a\nlittle bit used to meditating\nmaybe address a little bit of your\nadhdness\nand will help in the moment\nit kind of calming your mind down and\num also like letting go of a little bit\nof that anger and frustration\nso you know like when you're in those\nmoods where things are bothering you\nmy hope is that this technique will sort\nof like\nalmost like a tiny little xanax just\nlike\nchange your mood okay that's one\ntechnique\nthe second technique that i would offer\nyou is a little bit more long-term\nso it's not really about calming you\ndown in the moment\nit's a technique that you can do on a\nregular basis when you are relatively\ncalm\nthat will help the process of this\nemotional digestion\nof this scar that you have which one do\nyou want\nlet's let's do the let's start with uh\nwhen when i need to meditate like when i\nwhen i'm feeling like\ni need to calm down yeah good okay so um\nso what i want you to do is sit up\nstraight\nokay now i'm going to teach you\na a technique that we do a fair amount\non stream which is alternate nostril\nbreathing which is going to sound kind\nof weird but basically\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna block\none nostril\nand breathe in through the other nostril\nokay and and then i'll show you so i'm\ngonna breathe in through this nostril\nand then we're gonna block the other\nnostril and we're gonna breathe out\nthrough the other one\nokay so i know it sounds kind of weird\nand then what we're gonna do is breathe\nin through this one\nswitch back and then breathe out so it's\ngonna be in\nout in switch\nout in switch out\nin switch out so it's like half of the\nbreath\ngets done through each nostril\nokay okay so let me just show you okay\nso i'm gonna\nblock my right nostril breathe in\nnow switch and breathe out\nin through the same nostril\nswitch and out\nin through the same nostril\nswitch out\nin\ngood out\nin\nswitch out\nin\nswitch out beautiful now continue\nyour own pace for about 60 seconds\ni'll tell you when to stop\nshe's\nmy\ndo\nis am i hypnotized right now i don't\nknow what's happening\nwhat do you mean i just like i could\nhave just fell asleep i'm not gonna lie\ncould have just fallen asleep\nwhat were you thinking about i was just\ncompletely calm i was very calming\nsounds like you meditated wow\nwow\nit's that it's that wow\nso i don't have to sit there like with\nmy hand like\nin a pretzel okay\nno i believe in you loss\nwow i appreciate it that was\nis it is it so like the science behind\nis it like the focusing on what you're\ndoing\nwhere like you can't even focus anything\nelse you're just focusing on how you're\nbreathing like hot\nis that that's pretty okay yeah exactly\nlook at how quickly you figured it out\nso\na little bit explanation okay\ni was just surprised because no one no\none's ever\nstopped and been had that profound of an\neffect like that quickly it was like wow\nokay\nso cool um so it seems like it really\nworked for you which means we found a\ngood technique for you good job\nso a couple of things about the science\nof meditation the first is that\nmeditating successfully is not\ncontorting yourself\ninto a particular meditation technique\nit's finding the right kind of\nmeditation technique\nfor your mind okay so you told me that\nyou were a little bit like\ndistractible just to touch adhd\nso the meditation that technique that's\ngonna work for you\nis one that demands some of your\nattention\nokay so it's like it's like a little bit\ntricky to keep track\nright it's not like so hard but you\ngotta like\nfocus on it yeah right it doesn't happen\non autopilot\nand when you demand the attention of\nyour mind on one particular thing\nit sort of there's no room for other\nthoughts\nso remember your problem is that you're\ncarrying around all of this stuff\nand you don't have room for anything\nelse so when you do this technique\nwhat your mind automatically has to do\nis put everything else down\nyeah and when you put everything else\ndown\nyou're like whoa i feel calm\nbecause subconsciously you're carrying\nall this stuff around\nand then like you basically do this\ntechnique and your mind\nsets like just imagine like hiking with\nthis like 50 pound backpack\nand for 60 seconds you set the backpack\ndown you're like whoa i could have\nfallen asleep\nso why is it that and maybe some people\ncan but\ni haven't figured out how to do this why\nis it that i can't just\ndo that like why can't i just sit down\ntake a\ntake a deep breath and just not have a\ncare like why\nbecause you haven't been taught how\nokay okay short answer\nsimple answer you know i just put you on\na bike\ni held it a little bit and you started\npedaling and you're like\nwhy can't everyone just ride bikes it's\nbecause you need to\nbe taught okay right this is naturally\nis just\ncan wipe their mind like that's\narguably there may be people out there\nwho\nare more you know better at that like\nthere are some\ndepending on which tradition you you\nkind of like listen to like\nsome people think that the dalai lama\nfor example is essentially born like\npseudo-enlightened\nand so there may be like three-year-olds\nthat can do this i don't really know\nbut you know i think that this is like\nlike\nlos this is a skill that you can acquire\nright and this is why when people like\nmeditate on a regular basis\nthey become more productive they become\nhappier\nyou know i think i just need a medic i\nthink yeah i think i just need to\nlearn how to meditate yeah well now you\nknow\nso the next challenge for you is going\nto be anchoring your practice so that\nyou do it on a regular basis\nright so i'd say three to five minutes\nthree days a week\nis your first goal eventually if you can\nwork your way up to 20 minutes\nthat's where the research shows that\nyour brain will literally start to\nrewire itself\nand you'll learn how to do things like\nlet go like your brain will be more\nautomatic\nit's going to be bizarre i'm telling you\nyou're going to be\nin one of these episodes where you're\npissed off and then some part of your\nbrain is like\nwhoa take a deep breath it's not that\nbig of a deal\nthese are the things that you already\ntell yourself they're just gonna start\nworking\nand that's because your neurons are\ngonna change\nand they're gonna be capable of letting\nthings go\nokay you're gonna practice putting down\nthe backpack\nover and over and over again for three\nto five minutes a day\nthree days a week and then you're gonna\nlearn how to put down the backpack\nyeah before i wrote this down i don't\nthis is\nreally i don't know this yeah it's kind\nof on topic\num but no i guess it has to do with some\nsort of meditation\nit do you um do\ncan people get hypnotized is that is\nhypnosis a thing\nit does have anything to do with any\nkind of practice or is that just\nlike a myth no no so hypnotism is real\nso so so hypnotism is like it's the\nanswer is yes people can get hypnotized\nso here's what the science says about\nhypnosis\nso the first is that there's a wide\nvariety of susceptibility to hypnosis\nokay so some people are more likely to\nbecome hypnotized than others\nwillingness to become hypnotized is a\nbig\npart of whether hypnosis is successful\nor not\nso i don't think you can like i've never\nseen any convincing scientific evidence\nthat you can like mind control someone\nthrough hypnosis\nbut essentially yeah that's why i didn't\neven want to ask because i'm like\nalright this probably sounds really dumb\nso\nokay yeah hey like dude i think it's\nlike one of my favorite questions i've\never gotten on stream\nexactly okay so so and if we think about\nit you know how does hypnosis work\nyeah this is where uh it's kind of i\nmean i can explain this in a second but\nin a couple of seconds but if we think\nabout studying okay so like let's say\ni'm trying to study\ndepending on how much activity there is\nin my conscious mind\nokay let me just let's take a step back\nso when i talk about studying let's\nthink about what that means i read\nsomething\ni think about it actively for a second\nand then what i want to do is take that\ninformation and implant it into my\nunconscious mind\nso after i'm done at the library i close\nthe book i go hang out with my friends i\nplay some games\nthe next day i have my test i'm not\nthinking about whatever i studied right\ni'm just living my life\ni see a question on the test and then\npoof out of my unconscious mind\ncomes the answer does that make sense\nlike when i read the question that's\nwhen the answer comes into my conscious\nmind\nthis might be a whole different problem\nbut i'm sure that makes sense to a lot\nof people\nme i always had some sort of problem\nstudying but that's\nthat's probably completely yeah so so\nit's on topic because we'll talk about\nwhy you had a problem studying in a\nsecond\ni'm saying theoretically if we think\nabout it like when i study something\ni'm actively thinking about it and then\nmy hope is that the active thinking will\nlike get stored\non my hard drive and then like later on\nthat information can be recalled and\npulled up that's the goal of studying\nright\nyeah so if we think about it we have our\nconscious mind where we're thinking\nand we have our unconscious mind where\nlike our thought like\nall our knowledge is stored so then the\nnext thing\nis that what are the ways in which we\ncan implant things into our unconscious\nmind if i try to study and my mind is\ndistracted\nhow much do you learn\nnot at all right exactly and so if your\nmind is super calm how easy is it to\nstudy\nif your mind is clear yeah it's so much\neasier to put things in there\nexactly so let's think about what\nhypnosis is\nhypnosis is a technique to intentionally\nand quickly\ncompletely calm that conscious layer of\nmind\nso that you can stick something into the\nunconscious\nand then once it's stuck in the\nunconscious it starts to like\nwork automatically right so when people\nget hypnotized\nyou like tell them something like oh\nyou're now\na woman who's late for a work\nappointment\nand then like when they wake up their\nunconscious mind is like\npushing thoughts into their conscious\nmind oh my god i'm late for my\nappointment and i'm a woman\nand then they start freaking out and\neveryone on stage like laughs and it's\nreally funny and they got hypnotized and\nthinking that they were a woman\nand then the hypnotist is like when i\nsnap my fingers you'll be back to who\nyou are and they snap their fingers and\nthey kind of back to who they are\nso like in your opinion that's a real\nthing that happens people do that's not\na magic trick\nno it's not a magic trick it's just\nthere's a wide variety there's a wide\nrange of hip\nlike hypnotic suggestibility and people\nuse hypnosis\nin therapy a fair amount right so like\nif you look at like where is hypnosis\nactually used in a way that is not a\nstage performance\nthere are hypnotherapists and the goal\nof hypnotherapy\nis to calm down that that surface level\nmind so that you can access things\nlike repressed memories and like things\nlike that\ni mean i do that in sort of a slightly\ndifferent way whereas like i ask you\nleading questions\nand i know like i sniff something out\nand i'll ask you a question and then\nlike\njust think about this conversation go\nback and watch it some random story pops\ninto your head\nand then another random story pops into\nyour head right like where do those\nstories come from\nlike they've always been buried in your\nsubconscious we're just bringing them\nout in sort of an intentional way\nand so it's still like hypnotism just\nsort of like\nyou know if i had hypnotized you and\nthen asked you particular questions\nmaybe you would have like other\nlike less defended things like even on\nstream you're probably like a little bit\nyou know you talked about going deep so\nthe purpose of hypnotism\nis to help people go deep faster okay\nyeah and there's a lot of like\nsimilarities but a couple of key\nimportant differences from the\nmeditative state of mind and the\nhypnotic state of mind i frankly think\nthat meditation is just essentially\nsuperior like i think it's more\nconsistent\nmore people can do it there's less\nvariability and it leads to there's more\ndata that suggests that it's like\nmore helpful than hypnotism yeah\nyeah i've heard of so many people\ntalking about\nuh meditating i i mean i have a\ngrandmother who\nalways like tells me i should be\nmeditating and i just i'm like okay\nyeah grandma like you know i mean like\nbut it's kind of like\ni you know this actually helps people\ni just have been i don't know i've been\ni've been lazy\nor i don't know no no maybe i just\ndidn't want to look into it i don't know\nno no no no listen listen lois you just\nhave never had the opportunity to learn\nokay yeah that's it's as simple as that\nyou're not you didn't you're not lazy or\nanything it's just like\nlike it's kind of weird because everyone\njust talks about meditation but like no\none\nteaches it to you it's like man like\ni've seen people riding bikes all the\ntime people\nwake up when they're 26 and they're like\nyou know what i'm gonna learn how to\nride a bike\nyeah like that person isn't lazy it's\njust like you gotta give someone a bike\nand you gotta be like hey man you want\nto like hop on this bike and learn how\nto ride\nand then you're like it was like kind of\nignorance on my partner just not\nknowing that oh you had to learn like i\ni just thought it's just like\nyeah okay so yeah yeah\nyeah cool so you want to just tell us a\nlittle bit about yourself and and where\npeople can find you\njust before you wrap up for the day yeah\nno so i'm\ni los polos tv that's what i go by on\non everything and uh i try to i try to\nstream\ndaily but you know when i when i when i\nget back in the depression\ni'm gonna stop saying that actually i'm\ngonna stop saying get back impression\nbut yeah sometimes i'm just not in the\nmood but\nmostly i stream mostly i stream uh daily\non lowest post tv so yeah cool\ni i appreciate you having me on this was\nreally\ninteresting and uh it's i'm already\nstarting to think about some things\ndifferently to be honest good well\nthat's what we're here for and i really\nappreciate you coming on\nyou know i i know we sometimes reach out\nto people um when they're having a bad\ntime and\nand um you know i'm glad you you decided\nto to join us today because i think like\nnot only did you\nhopefully benefit from this but i think\na lot of the things that you talked\nabout\nyou know hopefully a lot of our\ncommunity can resonate with\nin terms of building walls you know like\nbelieving in yourself and not having\nother people believe in you i think\nthose are really common themes that\npeople struggle with\nso thank you so much for sharing and\ngoing deep man\nthank you for unlocking unlocking some\nmemories and\nand uh and doing what you do i\nappreciate your most you're most welcome\nbro\ngood luck to you all right man thank you\nshout out to you guys\nin the chat all right adios\n[Music]\nyou already both of these nuts or gargle\non these nuts"
