that voice all\nright awesome we're so\nwe're doing it let's go let's go how you\nuh and what do you go by\nuh jason or dailydose or uh pretty much\nanything really okay the minecraft\npeople call me big d\nso that's great\ni'll take anything um yeah so uh\nthanks for coming on first of all um i\nthink so far you know we haven't doxed\nyou\nyou revealed your identity we're going\nto try to see how long we can keep that\ngoing well\nit's it's one of those things like um\ni mean it's not impossible to find a\nquick google search we'll\nget you exactly what you want to see um\ni mean it's not like\nwe can see the big d on google no\nyou can go to google images we'll help\nyou out with that\num but you know it's just one of those\nthings where a lot of people just don't\nwant to have the magic\nruined for whatever reason and they have\ntheir own idea of what i look like and i\ndon't want to ruin that\nthat that magic for them so it's totally\nup to them\nokay cool and jason is there something\nin\nuh thank you very much for you know\ncoming on um it's\nit's cool to hear the you know you go\ninto the voice\nyeah i mean it's kind of cool so i\nbasically add a little bit of stress on\nit i mean my\ni use my like you know my regular voice\nbut if i want to like i\nadd a little bit of stress and the\nreason why i do that is because\ni want to make it sound as clear as\npossible because\ni it's an international audience so i\nget people from\nall around the world and they're like\nwow you know um\nyou know i'm just learning english and i\nlike watching your videos because it\nhelps me\npractice and learn my english because\nyou speak so so so clearly\num so i'm like yes that's exactly what i\nwas kind of shooting for i want to sound\nas clear as possible for\nas many people to understand the point\ni'm trying to get across and\nyeah there you go that's cool but you\nhave very\nvery clear like a crisp diction i guess\nyeah\ni mean yeah that's i i didn't really\ni never connected those dots until you\nkind of set it that that\nit is yeah i mean i obviously i add\nstress on it for\non purpose yeah um yeah it's cool\num is there something in particular that\nyou want to talk about today or\nanything that we can help you with well\ni don't i don't know i mean i'm\ni don't know exactly what you've already\ncovered but\nlike i i think it's interesting um from\nmy perspective\non on what you know your what\nmost youtubers go through what they have\nto go through and from a mental health\naspect in what they have to overcome\nwhat they have to conquer and what they\ndeal with on a\non a daily basis is really interesting\num\ni don't know like for me personally it's\nit's interesting how my whole life\nchanged\num because of youtube um you know i\ndidn't really use social media much\num is just kind of um\ni i really didn't and now that it's\ni use it every day it's my job i'm it's\nmy\ni have to be on you know instagram and\ntic tac and youtube and\nall this stuff for many hours a day and\ni just wonder\num you know if there will be any\nnegative\nimpact on that in the future um\nbecause i have seen in my own life how\num\nit's almost like my perspective on what\nis\nconsidered normal and what is considered\num what's the correct term is\nwhat is considered normal is what's\nconsidered normal on instagram is not\nconsidered normal\non everyday life sure so so basically\nit it only shows the good and it kind of\ndistorts my view on reality\nand um i'm not saying like oh social\nmedia\ni'm saying like i i truly believe in\nsome aspects of my life it has distorted\nmy view\nof reality and yeah so i just\ni just wonder years from now how what's\ngoing to happen\nyou know when we because social media is\nstill relatively new\nyears years from now when all these\nstudies come out what's going to be the\nnegative impact of social media and\nwhat's\nand how is it distorting other people's\nviews because\ni mean you know when you spend multiple\nhours\nevery day on social media no days off\nwhat's what what does that do to you are\nyou afraid of what it's doing to you\nthat's what i'm afraid of i am afraid\nbecause i don't know\nit's this is this is unknown territory\nin the scientific world because we\nreally don't know it's\nlike i said sign yeah social media is\nvery very new\num and we don't you know we don't have a\nton of studies on this we don't have\ndecades of you know studies on the\nimpact of social social media on\nsomeone um so i'm just i just don't know\nwhat's going to happen so i\nhopefully nothing bad but you know i\ndon't know yeah so so i i think um we\ndon't\nso it's interesting so i'm going to\nstart just a touch like\nabstract academic or philosophical i\nthink unfortunately\ni don't know if we're ever really going\nto have studies on it\nand there's a really simple reason for\nthat and that is that\nthe pace at which science studies\nsomething\nis far slower than the pace at which\nsocial media is evolving\nright so this is like kind of different\ni mean this is\nrelatively new in the history of science\nso if you look at medicine\nright like people have been breaking\ntheir legs for like millions of years\npeople have been getting infections for\nmillions of years people have had\nhearts and lungs and hypertension for\nmillions and millions of years\npeople have had cancer for millions and\nmillions of years\nnow there are new kinds of cancer right\nso when people like started smoking\ntobacco\nthere's like lung cancer and then we can\nstudy that but like people have been\nsmoking tobacco for hundreds of years\ni think there's something really\ninteresting going on when it comes to\nthings like video game addiction mental\nhealth impacts of social media where\nlike\nyou know there are studies like sort of\ncoming out\nnow about like facebook\nright and like that doesn't even account\nlike it's not even the current iteration\nof facebook\nit's like a study published today\nmeasured people's like facebook usage\nthree years ago and like facebook is\ndifferent now\noh that's true it's constantly changing\nisn't it it's not the same\nwhereas cancer will just remain you know\nyeah so cancer will change a little bit\nright like we've got covid\ncovid is like relatively new but also\nwe've had coronaviruses i mean the\ncommon cold is a coronavirus\nso we like have known a bunch about\ncoronaviruses we know about you\nso there's like there's evolution in\nmedicine but generally speaking science\ncan keep up\nwith the change of like physical\nmedicines pacing\nright whereas social media is evolving\nso rapidly and technology is evolving so\nrapidly like\nwe still don't really have a clear sense\nof whether you know what the risk of\nkeeping your cell phone in your pocket\nis\nfor testicular cancer like those are the\nkinds of studies that we're\nkind of like i i i've always worried\nabout that so i like i always keep my\nback pocket i'm like i'd rather get butt\ncancer than yeah\nbut cancer ain't pretty though no it\nisn't but um\nso so yeah i mean\nthere's just a lot of weird responses to\nthat statement like you can actually\njust remove a testicle and like\nyou'll be if you get you know can't\ncan't remove your butt\num i guess not i mean you can if you use\ninstagram filters i suppose but\num anyway so i think like that's one of\nthe really interesting things where as a\nmental health professional like i don't\ni've i've come to an interesting\nrealization and\ni'm sure that history will prove me\nwrong because history produce proves\nmost physicians wrong\num so i actually i i know it's gonna\nprove me wrong because\nwe're actually working on that but uh\ni think that the old system of studying\nthings\nis too slow and so\nyou know we're going to have to adapt\nand so one way that we adapt as an\norganization is like i\ni don't think we need to worry so much\nabout what effects it's going to have on\nyou\nbecause i think you already know like\nthis is the cool thing about clinical\nmedicine is that you don't need studies\nright like you work with a patient\nyou work with an individual and based on\nworking with an individual you can learn\na lot\nso like my question for you jason is\nlike how has social media already\naffected you\nuh well i just i just feel like\num i don't want to get too personal\nabout that um but i do\nfeel that we need a need i think there's\na need for\ndisclosing when photoshop is used\non in pictures and stuff i just feel\nlike\nthere has to be some sort of law of some\nsort because\nit's it's so easy to um to\nyou know edit a photo on ins on\ninstagram or even on tic tac or whatever\nand to show something that's just not\ntrue and\nyou you're constantly flooded with this\nidea that oh my gosh\nshe looks like this oh my gosh this guy\nhas yeah uh so many cars and stuff like\nthat idea of a false reality gets\nembedded as truth\nand it can really distort your view on\non reality\nand i just think it's really dangerous\nand we really have\nthere's nothing we can really do about\nthat um in terms of preventing people\nfrom doing that i mean anyone can\ndo whatever they want that's i mean\nthat's the beauty of it you can do\nwhatever you want\nbut also it's like you kind of have to\ntake it with a grain of salt like hey\nwatch out not everything that you see on\nsocial media\nis factual try not to um\ntry not to dive too deep into that yeah\nso\nyou know it would be interesting i think\nyou're you're kind of talking about a\nmacro solution to a macro problem\nso as people you know if if people had\nto state when a filter was used like i\nthink that's\none step in the right direction\ni still think though that i mean you\nknow i don't\nhow can i say this when you look at a\npic\nyou know when you look at 10 pretty\npeople in a row on instagram and there's\na little disclaimer in the bottom right\ncorner that a filter was used\ni don't know that your brain is really\ngoing to feel any less\nyeah inadequate right\nright i don't know i guess i don't know\ni just don't know if there's\nan answer for this sort of situation um\nbecause i think\ni think it well not a not a\ni guess i would just yeah delete\ninstagram delete you know social media\nnot the one that i was thinking of but\nthat's an answer too\nwhy what were you thinking well because\ni i think that there are two things that\nyou can\nthere are two dimensions that you can\nact right one is on the outer world\nand one is on you\nso so you know you were asking at the\nvery beginning you were kind of talking\nabout what youtubers face what content\ncreators kind of face in terms of mental\nhealth challenges and\nthis is where like we've actually\nlearned a lot and there are things that\nyou can do right so like like so\nlet me just give you kind of a quick\nexample and if i'm getting too far\noff track for you just let me know no\nyou're good so so i think the really\ncool thing is if you look at like\nancient like\nindia and china there was a lot of\nresearch that was done on like how the\nmind functions like in its\nfundamental parts so we have this thing\ncalled\nego or ahamgara is what they call it\nso ahamkada is sort of translated as ego\nbut technically the translation is like\nthe i feeling\nthe feeling of i so it also gets\ntranslated as like your sense of\nidentity\nand what the yogi's kind of figured out\nis that there are some things that will\ncause the ahamkara to like\nget worse so comparison is a good\nexample\nso like a comparison makes our ego or\nour sense of self feel worse\nwhat's that quote uh comparison as a\nthief of joy\nyeah i've heard that a lot recently\nright yeah absolutely it's it's a\nfantastic quote\nand so the yogis also said that the\ngreater you're a hum god and the more\nyou're suffering\nwhich is yeah well i mean since you're\non that topic i kind of did dive into\ninto buddhism because i was really\ninterested in that because\nbasically it's all it's like everything\nin life\nis like life is pain life is life is\nmiserable\nand um it's it's like\nunderstanding that life oh my gosh i i\nforgot i had a really good quote for\nthis\num but i did dive into buddhism it was\njust really interesting because i i\nreally felt connected to it because it's\nlike\ner life is pain life is miserable but\nlike we it's just the way we go about it\ngosh i'm sorry i haven't i haven't dived\ninto in a while but\ni i was really obsessed with buddhism\nfor about six months ago\nand can you help me understand why you\ngot interested in it\ni mean it's because\ngosh this is this is embarrassing\nbecause i\ni was like obsessed with it for the\nlongest time and now i can't remember\neither hold on hold on jason jason this\nis a good opportunity close your eyes\nokay what are you feeling right now\num well i i'm frustrated because i wanna\ni wanna figure out i had a really good\nquote yep it was so awesome\nyeah i couldn't find it yeah so so so\nhow does it feel\nstop looking for the quote okay eyes\nclosed\nhow does it so notice like the\nintolerability\nyou gotta find it you see what your mind\nis doing well i think that's just my\nadhd as well\nsure so that's still your mind but you\nyou got to find it right\nand what happens if you didn't find it\ni get frustrated because i want to share\nthis this amazing\nknowledge with so many people and i\ncan't share it yeah right\nso like can you let that go\nno i like educating i like educating\npeople\ni love i love teaching people i i'm i'm\nvery\npassionate about teaching which is why i\nlove my job\nokay find a quote bro\nif you want to hold up three it's gonna\ntake three seconds here i got this okay\nokay i finally found it um oh\noh so that's it everyone is suffering\neveryone is suffering with something\nlife is suffering and um\ni three so all life is suffering the\nsecond point is\nthe cause of all suffering is desire\nand to remove\nto remove the suffering you have to\nremove the desire that's the three\npoints\nso from the top all life is suffering\nthe cause of suffering is desire and to\nremove the suffering\nyou have to remove the desire and i\nreally connected with that on buddhism i\nthought it was really interesting\nokay how do you feel having shared that\nbecause i feel like i i just feel like i\ni shared knowledge with people how does\nthat feel yeah\nright so now this is really tricky\nbecause\nyou had a desire to share it yes\nand as a result i was suffering i was\nsuffering\nbecause of my desire ah but to share you\nshared and once you shared you were\nhappy\nright and so then how do we approach\nthose noble truths that you have there\nright so what how do we say because it\ndidn't i mean wouldn't you say that\nif you you know the fulfillment of\ndesire leads to happiness\num i don't know because that's what\nhappened with you just now right yeah\nyeah\nyeah yeah good about yourself right\nright that's correct\nso why isn't that on there why isn't one\non there\nthat i feel like your desires leads to\nhappiness\num i i\ni mean i guess i maybe maybe just a\nlittle bit of happiness but\ni i do i do feel connected in the in in\nthose\nthose noble truths there because it's\nalmost like i just i just feel\nso kind because there's just pain\nthere's suffering everywhere\nand it's all because we have a desire\nand if with with desire comes suffering\nand it's just\nyou know if you want something you got\nto work for it and that's the most basic\nform of desire uh you know you're gonna\nsuffer and you will be rewarded\nbut you're gonna suffer to get it yeah\nso so this is kind of interesting right\nbecause i i don't think that\nthe noble truth say anything about a\nreward through suffering\nno but i'm just kind of like\npiggybacking off what you just said\nbecause there is a\ni guess there is a reward but even if\nit's just for a short amount of time\nyeah so that's that's the key thing\nright so if we if so i think what\nbuddhism discovers so like let's talk\nabout a cookie for example\nlike so if i want to eat a cookie and i\neat the cookie\nam i happy\nwhat what was your objective did you\nwant to eat\nyeah you wanted you wanted to i wanted\nthe cookie man it's a warm\nfreshly baked chocolate chip cookie bro\nand after you eat it do you feel any\nsort of regret\nsure okay then\ni don't know what to say right so so so\ni'll ask you when you eat\ndo you like chocolate chip cookies i\nlove chocolate chip cookies everyone\ndoes\nyeah and when you eat a chocolate chip\ncookie do you feel regret\num well maybe a little bit\nbut i'm also kind of a health freak\nlet's see\nso this is this is what this is what the\nwhat this discovered\nyou [ __ ] asked me a question i asked\nyou the same damn question and your\nanswer is at least a little bit\nso right\nso like this is the crazy thing about\neven satisfying your desire which we\nthink makes us happy\nbut then the more that you look at it\nokay one cookie oh no now it's gone\nthere's suffering there i want another\none\nexactly it's so goofy because i almost\nfeel like it applies to everything in\nlife\nyes are you are you\nare you buddhist sure\ni don't i don't know because you seem\nvery knowledgeable because i feel like a\nlot of people don't\naren't unaware of this yeah so i'm\npretty knowledgeable about buddhism but\ni i think\nso the first thing is like buddhism is\nlike not really religion\nno it's just a way of life yeah so so\nlike in buddhism is essentially like\ni mean i'm sure a lot of buddhists will\ntake offense to this but\nyou know it's an outgrowth of like what\nwe call the hindu tradition\nright so there's particular like their\nhinduism is a\nis also not really a religion because\nit's so many different things it's\nsimultaneously\natheistic monotheistic and polytheistic\nso i sort of know that\nyeah so i sort of follow the the branch\nof hinduism\nwhich is like sort of atheistic\nwhich is sort of basically buddhism\ncool but whether it's hinduism or\nbuddhism i mean buddha grew up in india\nall of his teachings\nyou know come from his own experiences\nbut are rooted in\nquote-unquote hindu traditions but all\nof those like\nall of those labels and ownership of\nwhat\nis who is like all western those are all\nlike based on monotheistic\njudeo-christian conceptions of religion\nwhich is you are\nsomething or you aren't something which\nlike that concept doesn't really apply\nto what i call\nthe karmic religions right yeah\ni don't know i've always been fascinated\nwith um i've always been fascinated with\njust learning about different religions\nlearning about different ways of life\nhow to live\ni've always been a very uh i'm not\nsaying like oh i'm a\ni'm a scholar or anything but i've\nalways been very fascinated with\nlike um you know psychology and\num philosophers and what's wrong with\nsaying you're a scholar\nwhat is the definition of a scholar\ni think it's what you do\nwhat i do on daily dose internet\ni think you're a scholar that's\nthat's a wonderful compliment thank you\nso much\nall right i don't feel that way either\nbut\nwhy not well i don't know\ni thought a scholar was someone who who\num\nwho really dived into something and they\nuh\nthey they're extremely knowledgeable\nmuch more\nbecause i i just scratched the surface\nand everything i go oh that's\ninteresting and they kind of move on\nokay yeah so so you know how would you\nknow when you've gone far enough\num what's the there's i don't know who\nsaid the quote this um\nancient quote they said i know that\ni know that i know nothing so that's the\nanswer to that question\nyeah okay you never know you never know\nokay so do you feel like you don't\nunderstand buddhism well enough\ni don't i mean i forgot the three noble\ntruths\ndoesn't that by definition make you a\nscholar\ni guess i guess so is i guess is if\nanyone has a\nounce of curiosity they are a scholar\nso you just you just inflated the egos\nof so many\nso many people who might be unknown\ninterestingly enough i think it's your\nego that gets in the way of you like\ncalling yourself a scholar\nwhat do you mean that means i don't have\nan ego then no no i think it's you're\nactually your ego so your ego says i'm\nnot good enough to be a scholar\nthis is the way that real scholars are\nand look at me\ni'm just an amateur well i\nthis is so goofy i've never thought\nabout this yeah i mean\ni guess i guess you're right right\nyou're saying it's there's a voice in\nyour head that says\ni am not this that's [ __ ] ego\nyeah i'm the best person in the world\n[ __ ] ego i'm the worst person in the\nworld [ __ ] ego\nyou know i was thinking about this the\nother day i was like when i was growing\nup when i was a teenager i really\ni truly believe i knew everything like i\nthought i was so smart i\nyou know i don't need my parents help\nall this stuff and then i got older i\nwent oh my gosh i don't know anything\ni know nothing and it's so goofy how\nthat works out\nyeah so i think that that's how do you\nthink that happened\nuh i gosh hormones or something i'm not\nsure\nif only hormones could make people\nhumble the world would be a very\ndifferent place\n[Laughter]\ni have no idea here's an injection of\nthe humble hormone\nyeah so i think you know jason you\nmentioned\ni asked you one semi-personal question\nand you kind of steered away from it so\nif you really want to know how that hap\nhappened i i would\nhave to we could explore that together\nbecause i suspect like i don't think it\nwas just\nhormones i think that i think what makes\nyou\nscholarly i don't know what a skull i\nmean is that a job i don't know\nbut what makes you scholarly is i think\nyou're curious and i think you know you\ndevote\nwhat attention your mind is capable of\non on a particular thing\num and i think that our society tends to\nundervalue\nbreadth of knowledge to depth of\nknowledge yeah\nyeah i don't i don't think that depth of\nknowledge is\nnecessarily superior to breath of\nknowledge\nyou know i wasn't always really curious\nlike i'm i'm i'm more curious than i've\never been in my life i i just want to\nknow the answers to everything and then\nthe more answers i find the more\nthe more questions i get and i if that\ndoes\nthat sort of [ __ ] scholar i mean\ni don't know i don't know but like\nbecause i\ni was never this curious i mean um i\nsaid this\ni said this to some of my friends i said\ni i felt like i lived\nuh i think i even made a tweet about\nthis i felt like i lived\non my life on autopilot up until i was\nabout\nmaybe maybe i was about 23\nand that's when the first time i i truly\nfelt like i was awake\nas i i truly felt awake for the very\nfirst time in my life and\noh my gosh and i i just got extremely\ncurious about everything around me\nand i think it's because you know i\ngraduated from college and\nit's my first time living on my own and\ni go wait\nno one's telling me what to do where to\ngo and it's like the first time in my\nentire life that i've had to make my own\ndecisions\nand that kind of just opened up my\nentire uh\npersonality to trying to figure out life\nhow did that happen well it's because\ni mean um i had a i had\na wonderful wonderful upbringing with\nloving parents and loving family\nhowever for some reason well a couple\nproblems here\ni since i had adhd growing up\nmy that caused a lot of problems and it\ncaused a lot of self-doubt in me\nand it caused me to be extremely reliant\non my parents for their opinions\nfor on my career goals anything\nuh what i should do they helped me with\neverything which is great but it left me\nvery helpless so i had no self\nself identity like if you just if you\nasked me what my personality was when i\nwas in high school i'd\nbe like i have no idea i don't i truly\ndidn't feel like i had a sense\nof of self whatsoever um\nand then that that sense of self grew in\ncollege but it really\ntook off after college because it was\nthe first time i was really on my own i\nwasn't reliant on my parents or anything\nat all\nand um i was able to to\nbecome my own person and it's beautiful\nlike a little\nblooming flower can you tell us about\nthat person now\num well i don't know it's just a\nlike i said i was very timid i had no\nself-confidence and the biggest thing is\nthat\nthe best way for someone to grow\nconfidence\nis to be good at something this this\nyoutube thing is the first time i've\never had confidence in my life\nand i've said this many times i i thank\npeople on twitter\nall the time i go you know thank you for\nchanging my life\nyoutube changed my life it gave me a\nsense of\nof confidence that i've never had my\nlife i was never good at anything i was\nnever good i mean\nnever good enough at anything to be\nconsidered you know\nuh whatever um so this is the first time\nin my life where i was actually\nbetter at other people at this um for\nfor whatever reason\nand it grew my confidence and it didn't\nmake me cocky or anything but it made me\ngo like oh my gosh like i feel proud\nof of what i've accomplished which is\nsomething i've never really felt before\nin my life\nand yeah yeah sorry go keep going\ni don't think i had anything else uh and\nwhat did you accomplish\njason um like i said um\nwhen i i quit my i quit my job at the\nbank uh\nso february 2nd was my last\nmy last day uh so three years ago\nokay so fibroid cycle was three days ago\nthat was the three year anniversary of\nme quitting my job at the bank\nand i was working at the bank and i\nworked there for two years after college\nand i didn't know what to do i only went\nthere because my\nmy uncle helped me get a job he you know\nhe knew a guy who knew a guy so help me\nget a job\num but that was not my decision that was\nnot my my life goal that was not my\nso obviously how am i supposed to have\nconfidence in something that i know\nnothing true um also that job i did not\nneed a college degree for\ni literally felt i felt like a monkey\npushing buttons\num so it's just it's just unfortunate\nbecause my parents\nand me spent so much money on my college\ndegree just to\nbe a monkey pushy button pushing button\nso\ni'm happy that i got out of there but i\nreally grew\ninto my sense of self once i did\nsomething on my own like my\nwhen i told my my family like i think i\nwant to quit the bank and do youtube\nfull-time\nand like i got a lot of backlash oh no\nno no you got to save the bank you got\nto say because you get you know it's\nthat makes sense our parents grew up in\na time when it's you know\nthe internet's the unknown the scary\nplace you don't know what's going to\nhappen\nand i'm like i'm going to try this i\nknow it goes against everything that my\nfamily\nreally wants me to do and i i relied on\non their advice for such the long\nsuch a long time and it was the first\ntime i went i\ndon't want to take your advice and i\nfelt very empowering because i felt\nconfident enough i was like i\nreally as a fir seriously the first time\ni really didn't take my\nmy family's advice i was like i want to\ndo this i want to give it a shot\ni don't i don't want to pressure you um\nwith what i'm going to say i just want\nto share something i just really wish\npeople could see her face right now\nyeah yeah um i i we don't know\nyou think i'm pretty no i think your\nface says a lot i mean i think people\ncan tell\nwhat your words mean but i think like\nyou can see like the hope there's you\nknow\nyeah there's a good i'm not i'm not i'm\nnot saying we should change anything i'm\njust\ncommenting we'll we'll see we'll see\nwhat people people do next time huh we\ncould do another one\nyeah whatever well it's worth it i just\nmaybe it was inappropriate for me to say\nbut i just wanted to\nlet let me put it this way i really i\nreally enjoyed being able to see your\nface in that moment so i'm glad you're\non video\nat least for me\nand we're not going anywhere close your\neyes all right what happened\nwe're going to do it again we're going\nto measure what's the desire what's\nhappening we're going to play this game\nround two how do you feel about\ngoing on camera in front of the internet\ni think it'll be funny\nbut i mean i've done i've done this\nbefore i did the um\ni'm not i'm not afraid or anything i\nmean i've i've shown my face\nlike a few times on the internet so it's\nwhatever but like i'm not\nit's not like a big face review or\nanything you can just but at the same\ntime i've never really um\ndone like a uh like a podcast\ni think like a live i like a live video\nof me so\nlet's do it so is that coming from\na tranquil mind yeah yeah i mean i'm not\na crazy person\nso okay\ni i swear in my life you're okay okay\nall right\nokay do you feel nervous no not at all\nokay if you don't feel nervous then\nbecause because you know sometimes\npeople will say they don't feel nervous\ni'm just like i think that like you know\ndon't get me wrong jason your voice is\nawesome\nbut your face is too bro thank you\nokay hold on a second figure out how to\ndo this\noh besides then i can show off my cool\nstanding desk then when you get the\ncamera going\num let me just figure out sorry i just i\njust got a standing desk and i love it\num okay all right\nanyway so we can just keep talking cool\nwe're good\nwe're live yep so cool\nso but so you said that developing\nconfidence is about being good at\nsomething right\nright okay so\ndid you feel like you were good at\nsomething when you told your parents\nthat you wanted to do this\nyeah i felt like i was i knew something\nthat they didn't know\nand i felt like um i was more\nknowledgeable\nabout about youtube and what goes about\nit than they do\nso i just felt like i\ni felt extremely confident about what i\nwanted to do and\nso yeah it's it's been now it's a three\nyear anniversary of me quitting\nthe bank and it was a big decision it's\nkind of funny um\ni didn't i didn't know\nyou got to put in the two-week thing and\ni guess you don't technically have to\nbut um i guess you don't technically\nhave to but i was kind enough to do that\nand it just so happened to end up on\ngroundhog day which is so funny\nbecause it's like it's so like symbolic\ngroundhog day you wake up do the same\nthing over and over again\nhating your life um hopefully a lot of\nyou people saw that movie\num but um\nyeah so it's just kind of symbolic in\nmany ways that's an easy day to remember\nlike oh my gosh groundhog day\nthe day that i don't have to go to the\nbank yeah that's actually\nyou know quite the karmic coincidence\nwhat it's funny like i didn't know what\ni was doing at the bank\nwhatsoever like at all and um\nso you know how like most jobs they have\nperformance reviews and they're like\num they'll be like how what did you\noh sorry phone's ringing you\nyou'll do like performance reviews where\num\nlike whether it's like a six month\nreview out of the year review\nmost people would talk about all the\nthings that they accomplished\nand all the amazing things they did\nduring that year like almost\nmost people do when they do a job like\nhere's what i did i helped on this\nreport i did\nthis task and and they'd be like you\nknow a page long\nevery time i had a performance review i\nwrote\none sentence and all i said was\ni just want to get better and i left at\nthat\nmy boss called me and called me in the\noffice the first time i did that\ni did it like five times i just want to\nget better\nand the first time she went what's going\non here like most people give like all\nthe things that i did i'm like\ni don't even know like i i really don't\nknow much\nabout banking i'm i'm just trying to get\nbetter every day\ni really don't know what i'm doing like\ni'll be honest like i really don't know\nwhat i'm doing\ni just know what i need to do\nso yeah and then what did she say\ni just she was like okay whatever\nwhatever yeah so\nyeah i get the feeling jason that you\nweren't really living your life back\nthen\nno i wasn't and it feels to me like\nyou're living your life now\ni've wanted to be a youtuber since i was\n16. so\nthis is this is my dream job well\nactually my yes i guess in my dream job\nmy other job was i want that i wanted to\nbe\nis i wanted to be a high school guidance\ncounselor um because i had a\nsuch an awesome high school guidance\ncounselor super cool\nand um and i was like this is such a\ncool job all you do is call in students\nevery day and go like talk and he would\ninvite me like\nwhat do you want to talk about like\nwhat's going on like i think that's such\na cool job just like\njust get inside the heads of uh of how\nthe kids are doing\nin in high school so that was my other\ndream job that i want to do because i\nthink just\nit's just interesting just to you know\ngive that support to\nto people who might be not feeling too\ngreat\nsounds like that it's kind of\ninteresting because i'm\nnoticing some\nirregularities in your story what do you\nmean\nso the first is that like you kind of\nsaid that you didn't really like you\nweren't like a real person until 23.\nyou know that's sort of the impression\nthat i got is that like you were just\nlistening to your parents and like kind\nof going to autopilot and stuff like\nthat\nbut and then you kind of go back and you\nsay actually like\nyou wanted to be a youtuber since you\nwere 16. oh i did but i didn't i didn't\nseriously like i was like oh it's not\ngoing to happen like no one's going to\nwatch me or anything so yeah but\nso it's it's a really important\ndistinction right so i i think actually\nlike\njason you've been a person all along you\njust didn't have the confidence to know\nit\nmaybe yeah that was probably it maybe\nthat was the situation there right\nbecause it's like you knew what you\nwanted you just didn't have faith in\nyourself that like\nyou your opinions were good ones because\nyou were\nyeah yeah well i mean i didn't really\nget in i didn't get in\nthat's why everyone was kind of my\nfriend in high school\ni i didn't have any i didn't get in any\narguments whatsoever because i was not\nknowledgeable enough to\nuh think of any counterpoints like oh\nthat's like that's a good point i don't\nknow i just kind of agreed with everyone\nif you agree with that\nwith everyone it's pretty easy to get\nalong yeah\nyou're kind of a chameleon yeah i just\nkind of blended in\nit's kind of it's kind of goofy because\ni kind of just um blended in with\neveryone else i'd be like no matter what\nfriend group i was with i was like oh i\nguess i have to act this way now i gotta\nact this way now\nso i just kind of changed my personality\nbased on who i was with which is\nobviously\nnot the best thing to do but um who are\nyou\num i i don't i don't know who i am i\ndon't know who i am\nuh i'm just uh i'm just some guy trying\nto get through life like everyone else\ndoes that question make you\nuncomfortable no\nno what if i said what if i said i\ndidn't\nbelieve you that you don't know who you\nare\ni'd be like you're okay\nlike i don't care so so so it's it's\ninteresting because\njason here's what i would say i think\nyou know who you are i just don't think\nyou know how to explain it\ni i don't know how to explain either i\ndon't know i really don't know\nyou really don't know who you are oh my\ngosh should i just turn off my monitor\nyou may have turned off your monitor but\nwe can see you fine\nokay i think i'm back i don't know what\njust happened there i'm back\nuh yeah so i always say something about\ni don't know who i am yeah do you do you\nreally not feel like you know who you\nare\nuh no i know i like i i don't even know\nhow to\nwhat's the definition of that i don't\neven know how to explain that\nlike what if i if i say who are you\nlike what would you say i'm me\nokay well i'm me too so what's the\nproblem there's no problem\nright so so here's here's what my\nproblem is that when you say you don't\nknow who you are i call [ __ ]\nokay that makes sense okay well i mean\nbut i just get\ni i mean i i don't and now it's gets\ntricky because we know you're a\nchameleon\nso are you just playing along because\nthat's what i want to hear like do you\nlike because i i get the sense that\nyou're\ni mean we talked about how you're\nconfident in yourself like you know who\nyou are\nwell i mean what i don't know what the\ncorrect answer here is like do i just\nsay i'm a youtuber i make youtube videos\ni mean\ni'm a i'm a i'm a guy that just wants\ni'm the curious person that just wants\nto learn about the world\nlike i don't know there's just so many\ndifferent answers for that kind of\nquestion\nyeah good so now we get back to buddhism\nyes\nso because you're saying all of those\nthings are not\ndon't capture the essence of who i am\nthat's actually what i'm hearing\nyeah i think so it's sort of like if i\nlook at a house\nfrom one side that's not the whole house\nand then if i walk around to the side of\nthe house that's not the whole house\neither\nand then if i walk around to the back\nthat's not the whole house\nand so could you be described as a\nyoutuber sure\ncould you be described as i think a\nlittle bit closer to the truth\nof who you are is that you're just a\ncurious guy who likes to teach people\nthings\nyeah that's what i love the most because\nlike i really wanted to be a teacher i\nreally wanted\nto teach people things now i really can\nso whenever i get something educational\ni get so excited because i don't want to\nlike bore people with educational stuff\nbut like if i find something that's\ngenuinely\ninteresting i'm like ass let's go i got\nsomething good\nlike because there's a lot of stuff that\npeople um you know\na lot of schools won't teach for\nwhatever reason or it's not like\ncontroversial stuff just like they can't\ncover\neverything so they're not gonna talk\nabout here's a cool video\num here's a cool video of\na whale getting uh tracked by\nthe government or something i don't know\n[Music]\nyeah yeah so yeah i\nso i i i don't know exactly where this\nconversation is going but i'm going to\nteach you a little bit we're going to\ndig into buddhism a little bit is that\nokay\nsure check out my city i'm going from a\nstanding desk to a sitting desk watch\ngg so smooth\nwelcome um\nso the interesting thing is that what i\nand and now i'm gonna sort of make some\nassumptions about buddhism but i'm not\nas well versed in it i think at the end\nof the day buddhism and\nhinduism share a lot there are some\narguments that they have\num which i think are personally i feel\nlike are not really important\nbut um the\nso one interesting thing if we kind of\ngo back to ego and the self\nis that the way to know who you really\nare\nis through this phrase which means not\nthis\nnot this okay so if you can\nuse anything to describe who you are\nthat is not who you are\nokay so i'm not a youtuber i'm not\na curious person the true essence of\nwhat you are is not a youtuber because\nyou were you before you were a youtuber\nright\nright right yeah i mean i was i had a\nsense of self before\ni became a youtuber but i think it\nreally grew my sense of self grew with\nyoutube because i got more confident\nand once i got more confident in myself\nthen yeah it's beautiful like\ni just had it's just so frustrating\nbecause if i if i if i was a person i am\ntoday\nand um it's just i compare myself to my\nsister my sister was always very\nconfident\nfrom a very young age and\nthat i was thinking about this too i\nthought about this too i was like oh my\ngosh she set the bar so\nhigh like you know she got straight a's\nand everything got double majored in\nspanish and engineering super smart\num so it's just like the bar was set\nso high it's like how do i compete with\nthat and\ni don't know i just i just i just i\nforgot where i was going with this\nwhat was it like growing up with adhd\nwith a sister who was\neffortlessly successful it's um\ni guess it was well we didn't really\nhave that close\nof a relationship because i just for\nsome reason i was i just didn't really\ntalk to her that much because i guess\nwhen we we were we were on friendly\nterms and everything but\ni just didn't really have a very strong\nrelationship with my sister and now\nit's very strong now that i've i've\ndeveloped a sense of self my sister has\naddressed this too she's like i'm very\nproud of you jason like you've\nlike you've grown into a much a very\nbeautiful person because\nuh she knows who i used to be i used to\nhave i used to be extremely reliant\non the opinions of others i could never\nmake my own decisions\nand um now i can how did that happen\nuh well i like i said i think it's just\nfrom\nfrom youtube and everything like i said\nyoutube has saved my life thank you so\nmuch let's get somewhat interesting\nright because we started this\nconversation with oh my god what is\nsocial media doing to me\nand here we hear about the life-changing\npositive aspects of youtube\nnot a story we hear every day no no\nit's it's just so goofy um\nit's because i mean yeah it does have\nits positives in its negatives for sure\nand\nyou you said your sister is proud of you\nnow\nand you guys yeah i mean she was always\nproud of me she was always\na loving sister but like she could tell\nthat i changed\nand that's a good thing and my mom\nmentioned that too she's like you've\nchanged jason that's a good thing\nso how does it feel to hear your family\nsay that\nit's really nice because it's like i get\nto form my own opinions now i get to be\npart of the conversation because i used\nto\nyou know i like family dinners and stuff\ni just sit there and eat\ni had to sit there and eat um i wouldn't\ni wouldn't plug anything into the\nconversation i wouldn't feel a need to\num especially like you know big like\nfamily dinners like you know christmas\nand thanksgiving and stuff i would never\ninput anything because i wouldn't feel\nconfident enough to\ngive my own opinion and now i can it's\nwonderful\ncan i think for a second yeah go for it\ni get a lot of authenticity from you\njason\nwhat do you mean a lot of authenticity\nyou're just you're authentic\nuh yeah i guess i i have nothing i have\nnothing to fake\nthis is this is me this is who i am i've\nbesides this seems really exhausting to\num fake a personality\noh yes like i'd just be so mentally\nexhausted\nbut i mean you did that for years and\nyears and years no\nno i i guess i don't even feel like i\neven had a personality i don't even feel\nlike i had a sense of self so i\nhad nothing to fake i just kind of like\nokay here where am i supposed to be i\nguess i'm here\nwhere am i supposed to be now mom oh i\nguess i'm over here like gosh i probably\nhad my mom call the doctor for me up\nuntil i was like 20.\nyou know make appointments for me and\nstuff sure so\ni i just didn't i didn't even think\nabout these things and now i do\neverything\nby myself and it's nice but it's like\ni'm learning for like the first time\never like so many things\nyeah so i i find myself being a little\nbit um\nsort of at a crossroads of sorts or one\nof these\nweird boston intersections that has like\nfive roads\nin one intersection um so i could ask\ni'm not sure exactly where to take this\nconversation is there a particular\ni can lay out a couple of options that i\nthink would be interesting\num well i was i was i was talking to\nsomeone else about this\nyesterday uh-huh like kind of random but\nbut since you're a doctor i was\nwondering what your input input would be\ndo you think you'll see uh lower rates\nof alzheimer's\nbecause of so many people are gaming now\nlike as we get older of alzheimer's\nalzheimer's yes because as we get older\num\nyou will we're still gonna be playing\nvideo games and stuff\nlike we're you know our generation\nas they get older when we're gonna be\nlike 70 we're still going to be gaming\nwe're not going to stop gaming and i\nthink we'll\ndo you think we'll see a lower rate of\nalzheimer's as a result\nit's a damn good question and i think we\nwill\nokay i think i think we will because\nthink about the\nthere's so much brain power being used\nwhen you're simply playing a video game\na first person shooter or anything and\num\none of the things you want to do to\nprevent alzheimer's is\nalzheimer's is to exercise your brain\nand that's why\nlike my dad he's uh today's his birthday\num\ni'm gonna see him today don't worry um\nand today's his birthday what he likes\nto do to prevent\nuh getting alzheimer's dementia whatever\nhe plays\nuh he he doesn't play video games he he\nmakes videos he makes his own youtube\nvideos\nand to you know just to exercise his\nmind but he also\npractices spanish a lot every day he\npractices spanish every day\nhe he gives free legal advice to poor\npeople um\nso he he does exercise his mind because\nhe's so\nhe takes precautions to avoid getting\nalzheimer's and i was thinking about\nthem like\nwell when our generation gets older are\nwe are going to see\nlower rates of alzheimer's as a result\nand i think the answer is yes\nso i think that that's a\nvery hopeful perspective\ni think it it also could be true\nso here's i there are a bunch of\nvariables i'm thinking about so the\nfirst thing is that what's protective\nagainst dementia\nso the first thing is that not all\ndementia is alzheimer's\nand you know so alzheimer's is a\nparticular pathophysiologic\nprocess in the brain that actually has\nto do with the inability to clear\nwaste products from our neurons\num if pathophysiology serves me\ncorrectly because i you know it's been\nyears now since i've\ni've really dug into the pathophysiology\nof alzheimer's\nbut so so some fortunate or unfortunate\nthere are some processes that happen in\nour brain which have\narguably less to do with our mind and\nkeeping our mind engaged\nsome things there are some brain\nprocesses that our mind has a greater\ninfluence over\nothers that it has less of an influence\nover so if we think about something like\nanxiety or depression i believe that our\nmind\nhas a strong potential impact\non the brain in anxiety\nso we can do things with our mind that\nwill change the function of our brain\nin someone who's anxious when it comes\nto something like a glioblastoma\nmultiformi which is like a particular\nkind of brain cancer i think that our\nmind has\nless of an impact on altering our brain\nso anxiety so i say you don't think you\ndon't eat\ndo you feel like um there's not much\nyou almost feel like it's like it's a\ngiven it's a given like you will get\ndementia\nor do you think there's really not much\nwe can do\nlike i don't think either of those\nstatements are true\nokay so there's a lot we can do\nand it isn't a given but i don't know\nthat video games for the answer so let\nme just\nso the first time i'm not saying that's\nthe answer they could they could be a\npart of the answer we'll get to that in\na second\nso well the first thing to kind of lay\nout is to understand that our mind has\ndifferent like the impact of our mind on\nour brain\nit changes depending on what process\nyou're talking about so one end of the\nspectrum is like cancer where like i\ndon't know if you can think your way out\nof cancer\nyou can certainly as bizarre it sounds\nyou can train your mind to think your\nway out of anxiety\num and then in the middle is something\nlike alzheimer's so we know that and\nthis is the interesting thing about\nalzheimer's if\nand i'm rusty here so you got to take\nthis with a grain of salt if i remember\ncorrectly\nwhat's protective against alzheimer's is\nactually novel experiences\nso what does that mean so that means\nlike if i've been playing mario kart\nsince the age of five and i continue to\nplay\nmario kart into until the age of 80 i\ndon't think that's going to be very\nprotective against alzheimer's\nso new experiences new games\nthat's different story so like this is\nwhere we're like you know people\nthink that something like a crossword\nlike doing a crossword every day is\nprotective against dementia\nit's it and and really the data seems to\nsuggest that like doing\nnew stuff so like your dad you know\nengaging new clients that can't pay him\nand stuff like that\nhe's like learning to make youtube\nvideos that [ __ ] is protective against\nalzheimer's\nbut that's because when he was like five\nhe wasn't playing it so i i think the\nissue is that you know if you spend your\nyour well like i think if you play the\nleague of legends for 10 hours a day now\nand you continue doing that for 60 years\ni think you're more likely to get\nalzheimer's that makes sense because\nit's when you're making new experiences\nyou're you're making new\nnew connections absolutely so that's\nexcellent\nso so the neuroplasticity component has\nto do with\nwith uh novel experiences\nyeah as i say when you um when you learn\nhow to\ni think i read something if you whenever\nyou learn how to uh\nplay an instrument you gain like three\npercent brain matter mass or something\nlike something ridiculous\ni don't know i i saw some sort of quote\nor something so so this is also where\nthings get a little bit\nconfusing because actually trimming down\nconnections in your brain is how a lot\nof\nlearning happens so the highest density\nof connections\nand neurons actually happens at birth or\neven before birth\nand then like within the first couple of\nmonths or years\nlike we get down to 10 of what we\nstarted with\nand the way that i kind of think about\nit is like imagine that i made a block\nout of a city out of like a block of\nwood like i made like a diagram\nlike you know really like the city\nemerges\nthe order emerges out of the reduction\nof mass\nnot the increase of mass and that's also\nsort of how our brain works\nso like like a a lot of axonal trimming\nand things like that is actually\nassociated with learning\nso so\nyeah you're like because if you think\nabout like you know if i if i take a\nblank piece of paper\nand i cut it into like an image\nthe the resolution in the world happens\nfrom losing stuff not gaining stuff\nwhich is something that a lot of people\ndon't like they think that the brain\nlike oh i'm like increasing my number of\nneurons\nwhereas like your brain rewires and it\nstrengthens connections it tunes\nlike pruning is actually a big part of\nthe learning process\ninteresting i don't know that the last\nthing about\nalzheimer's though this we do have very\ngood data about is that\nheart health is brain health so a lot of\nthe dementing processes that happen\nhappen because the blood vessels in our\nbrain get like clogged\nand so as the blood vessels in your\nbrain get clogged like you just can't\nsupport the health of your neurons\nyou can't clear waste products and as\nyou can't clear waste products that\n[ __ ] builds up in your brain and your\nneurons start to die\nso you're basically pooping in your own\nhead\nno you're not pooping in your own head\num you're unable to poop\nout of your own head it's actually\nsubtle but important to my head\nyour head is constipated yes\nfar better yeah right because it's the\nevacuation of the waste materials which\nwe get bad at\nin when you impact vascular health so\nthe problem with playing games is that\nif it comes with a\na negative impact to your cardiovascular\nhealth like ie your weight or your diet\nor things like that\nthat's going to be more alzheimer's\nprone would be my judgment\nso the simple matter is that i i think\njason your theoretical instinct is\ncorrect\nthat if you continue to play games that\nare like new and interesting and like\nyou know you give some like boomer game\nor vr\nyeah go ahead yeah i would say i hope\nthere's not someone out there who's\nstill playing the same game for 50 years\ni mean so\nso i'm one of these [ __ ] noobs that\nloves that though\nlike you know because i've been playing\ndota since like\ngod i don't even know how long yeah and\nand\ni mean that's what i think is amazing\nyou know it's like these games like\nchess like you can play chess your\nentire life\num and and i think that yeah go ahead i\nwould say i love chess i love\ni love playing chess i'm not very good\nat it but i love it i like that i like\nthe\nit's almost like um it's like a just a\nvery simple\nwar game that's all it is battle game\nyeah chess is great chess is great i\nlove chess\num yeah so i was gonna say i'm not\nreally sure i mean if you've got\nquestions i'm happy to answer them\ni find myself being immensely curious\nabout one detail of your personal life\nthat you may not want to talk about\num we can talk about buddhism or um\nso i'm kind of curious what's your\nwhat's your relationship status\ni'm single how do you feel about that\num i'm at a time in my life where\nwhy i was just in a two-year\nrelationship and that ended in\noctober and um it's because i i don't\nknow i just\nwell i don't want to get into details\nwhy it didn't work out but um\ni don't feel like i'm a complete person\nyet so\ni don't feel like ready for a\nrelationship i don't feel like i'm\ni'm genuinely not ready for a\nrelationship i think i have a lot of\nself-discovery i have to go through\ni'm not um the best person i want to be\nand i feel like i have a long way to go\nto be\nthe best person that i can be so that's\nwhy\ni'm single and i don't know when that's\ngonna change\num i don't know we'll see\nso i'd like to challenge that for just a\nsecond\nokay so this is going to be a far\nshorter conversation than i thought it\nwas going to be\nbut um first of all i appreciate you\noffering the answer\nbecause it is a personal question but\nthe one thing i'd encourage you to keep\nin mind jason\nis that you've been a youtuber for far\nlonger\nthan you give yourself credit for\nso yeah you've been a person so even\namidst the chameleon-ness i think you\nwere always in there\nand the reason i asked you about the\nrelationship i have no [ __ ] idea\nhow or why i thought this but like\ni encourage you to to try to remember\nthat and to acknowledge that in the same\nway\nthat you were always you before you had\nthe confidence to be you\nyou may be more ready for a relationship\nthan you give yourself credit for\nmaybe but my biggest fear is that i\ndon't want to hurt someone\ni'm very afraid of that and i know\nthat's that's just part of that's part\nof the game\npeople get hurt and people i'm very\nafraid of hurting someone\nand be like you know um all of a sudden\nlike\ni i don't feel it anymore i'm not i'm\nnot i'm not in\ni'm not invested in this anymore and\nthat's my fear i don't i hate i don't\nwant to hurt anyone\nand that's my biggest fear i really\ndon't want to hurt anyone\ni don't like hurting anyone period uh i\ndon't like\nkilling things i don't like hurting\nthings spiders i\ni hate it i don't like hurting anyone\nperiod\nanyone or anything and i guess that's\npart of the game\nbut that's the reason why i'm single\nbecause i'm afraid to hurt i'm going to\nhurt someone\nbut at the same time i maybe just got to\ntoughen up i'm like okay\nit's part of the game people are gonna\nget hurt uh\nit's it's it's just part of you don't do\nthat well\ni'm not trying to hurt someone but i'm\nsaying like no i think that's\nthat's you becoming callous and that's\nyou becoming something that you're not\nyeah i don't know\nso so jason this is where like there's a\nmiddle road right like you can\num you want to get into this\nno no go for it i want to hear it no no\nno\nokay yeah okay i i am\ni'm i'm open to everything like i said\ni'm i'm i'm not\ngonna be offended by anything yeah\ni know you're not going to be offended i\njust may not be pleasant\ngo for it be brutal i'm not sure i'm not\ni'm not gonna i'm i'm\nnot gonna hurt you i just you know i'm\nnot gonna be brutal it's just\nit can be hard to face these things so\nso like\nlet's think a little bit about that okay\nso like it's great that we have this\nbackdrop of buddhism so like i want you\nto recognize\nthat your desire to not hurt someone\ncan sort of be a good thing like so in\nin sanskrit there's this phrase a word\nahimsa which means non-violence\nand that non-violence is like the\nhighest ideal\nthat like all other like moral values\nshould like\nbe subject to non-violence yeah so i i\nthink that you're very\nnaturally like you a himsa is very\nimportant to you\nso that's wonderful and at the same time\nyou have to be careful because there's a\ndifference between fear of hurting\nsomeone\nand ahimsa there's a difference between\nideal and an emotion\nlike like so so like let me just give\nyou an example so i'm a doctor right so\nlike sometimes\nas a doctor like i think to myself so we\nwe\ntake this oath when we graduate and it\nsays\nyou know like one of our one of our\nethical principles is non-malfeasance\nwhich is to do no harm now the problem\nis like i could prescribe a medication\nand they could have an allergic reaction\nand they could die which is like the\nvery opposite reason why i'm there\nyeah and so then the question becomes\nokay so like i'm really here to help\npeople like\ni want to save lives not end them but\nevery time\nyou know if i'm a surgeon every time i\ngo into the operating room there's a\nchance that the patient\ncould die and so that fear of\nnot wanting a patient to die like cannot\nbe my guiding principle you're the worst\nsurgeon in the world\nget out of here because i wouldn't be a\nsurgeon\nyeah yeah it makes sense i know where\nyou're getting it\nand and so i think you've got to be\nreally really careful and\nand so i'm going to be kind of like if\nanything i'm going to be judgmental\nbecause i'm making a lot of assumptions\nabout your experience\nthose aren't really based in reality\nbecause i haven't asked you any [ __ ]\nquestions\nbut but i i think that you've got to be\nreally careful about letting that fear\ncontrol\nyour actions right because i think\ncaring is a wonderful thing for a\nrelationship\nbut fear of hurting someone and like\ndepriving yourself of the opportunity of\ngiving them\nin yourself everything else\nis like you're like the surgeon that'll\nnever enter the operating room\nright no i mean i i thought about this\nbecause at the same time i've only\ni've been in like maybe like i've only\nbeen in two relationships in my life and\nonly one of them was\nwas serious so um at the same time it's\nlike maybe it's just one of those\nsituations where i have to\njust try with someone else like you\nnever know\nyeah so i i would encourage you to like\nnotice that fear right so like i've\nasked you to notice a couple things\nwithin yourself like\nand probably that that fear comes from\nsort of like a traumatic experience\nyeah i mean you know breakups are scary\nno one wants to do that\nyeah and well i mean it may even come\nfrom before the breakup\nno definitely not\nwell because it's like as is the first\ntime i truly fell in love with someone\nso\nthat's why what was that like\nit was wonderful that was really nice\nand i know you don't want to talk about\nit but i can see you're getting\nemotional\nyeah what are you feeling right now\num it's just sad\nyou know the whole thing but yeah\ni'm just not gonna say anything for a\nsecond you don't have to speak\nwe're just gonna sit with it\nlet me know if you need a dick joke yeah\ni'm good\ni'm good do you feel well supported\noh yeah for sure yeah definitely\ni mean yeah my family's got my back\neveryone's got my back so\ntrying to figure out what to say no\nyou're good you're good\nlife is beautiful so these are these are\ngood things to go through these are good\nthings to talk about\ni like talking about everything and\neverything i'm not i'm not scared to\ntalk about things so\ncan we acknowledge that not everything\nis beautiful\nwell i think um yeah you're right not\neverything is beautiful\nyou see um yeah\nso here's the next step so buddhism\nwould say\nit's important to acknowledge that not\neverything is beautiful right because\nwhat are the life is suffering\nyeah life is suffering um yeah i can\nbring it up again\nuh i can give you the three because i i\njust think it's so interesting because\nit just\nit really resonates with me it really\nstuck with me and i just\num i just felt it was so interesting\nbecause it's like if you want something\nin life\nit's gonna be painful and it whatever it\nis whatever\nbecause i mean you're a doctor you\nprobably probably want to school for\nlike 10 years right\nso um yeah it's gonna be it's gonna be\na painful long process so um\nall life is suffering the cause of all\nsuffering is desire\nto remove the to remove the suffering\nyou have to remove the desire\nyeah so here's what i'd say to you\nyour desire to not hurt someone\ncan't be suffering it's it's\nit's not it's going to keep you from\nliving yeah\nand and it's it's good that you don't\nwant to you know like ahimsa i think is\ngood but like\nbe careful about the emotions um\ni had a couple of other thoughts in\nthere but\noh yeah so so it's it not everything in\nlife is beautiful\nand then here's the other thing that\npeople don't really get is that\nit's okay for things to not be beautiful\nthere's no problem with things not being\nbeautiful\nright and if i if i were to kind of like\nbecause i think this is the the\nmentality that a lot of people have\nright\ni'm just going to pick one thing from\nyour background which is like when you\nwere growing up i can imagine that it\nwas\nhard being a kid with adhd and sometimes\nit's even hard to acknowledge how hard\nit is because your parents are so\nsupportive\num and then you know growing up with\nyour sister the way that she is\nbut i think that's a prime example of\nlike she's\nstudious and intelligent and i have adhd\nand look at where y'all i mean it's not\ni hope she's doing well but like\ni think adhd it's interesting i didn't\nknow you had adhd but\nnow that i think about your content\nmakes perfect [ __ ] sense\nyou know i was i was talking to um to\nsomeone about this i\ntruly think my adhd gave me an advantage\nso basically\num so here's the problem this is the\nentire reason why i started\nmy youtube channel in the first place um\ni looked on youtube\nand it went there is no videos catered\nto adhd people\nand i want i want to change that and i\nbecause i realized i couldn't pay\nattention more than like\n30 seconds on a video i was like i want\nto click off i want to do something else\ni want to so basically that's why all\nthe clips on my videos\nare about 30 seconds or less and so i\nhave this\nbasically when i'm editing my videos\ni'll just be i'll like watch it\nand then as soon as i lose interest i'll\nstop it i'm like i'm done\nlike that's where i'm gonna cut the clip\nand then we're gonna put in the video i\nthink that's why a lot of people find it\nso so it's brilliant so i know because\nit's so it's so addicting because like\nlike as soon as like\ni start to peek at one video another one\ncomes up it's like that's that's the\nwhole purpose and it's it's literally\nbuilt for adhd people like me because\ni can see it firsthand i go as soon as i\nlose interest as soon as i find it\nnot interesting the video will end there\nand a lot of people get frustrated with\nthat they go hey the video is only\nyou know you didn't show the full video\nlike like it kept going i'm like yeah i\nknow but i lost interest\n[Laughter]\nso no it's like a superpower\nit really is and i think this is where\nwe we talk a lot about\num so in eastern medicine\none of the key things is that like in\nthe west we sort of think of like minds\nas all one way\nright like we don't like so in we know\nthat for example a different color like\nhair color right we know there's like\nnormal variants of hair color within the\nhuman population\nbut when we think about mental\ncharacteristics we don't think about\nnormal variants we sort of say that the\nmind\nis one way and what happens is we\ndiagnose some people as being\nill because their mind their\nmind's attention span is like short so\nit's not\nadapted to sitting in a classroom for\neight hours a day\nbut it is very very adapted to sifting\nthrough tons of [ __ ] on the internet\nand finding the choicest pieces and then\nlinking them together\nyeah exactly i mean i tried to hire\npeople to do my job\nand to help me out and stuff not to do\nmy job but you know help me out and\nhelp find videos it didn't work people\njust couldn't find what i wanted\nand so i was like okay this is this is\nfrustrating because like i can't put my\nbrain in someone else's head so yep um\nand i'm sure other people exactly so and\nlike i tried like\nexplaining like hey like this is cool\nbut like it's not good\nfor daily dose of internet um so i i\ntake great pride in making sure\ni i show the best clips because i\ni want to put a really good product out\nthere for everyone to enjoy\nyeah that's cool and so it's like if\nit's just like a regular like standard\ncat video like\nbeing cute like i'm not going to show\nthat i'm not going to show that it has\nto be\nsomething funny or unique about that cat\nvideo like\ni just don't show me a regular cat video\nthat's not going to fly\nthat's cool um\nyeah any questions for me no\nno i mean how long do your um\n[Music]\nuh your podcast usually go yeah\nwe usually like i'll ask people around\nthe now mark\nit's about 1 30. um sometimes they go\nlong like they tend to run anywhere\nbetween like one and two and a half\nhours\nyeah um usually around two\nand it really just sort of depends on\nlike the lifespan of the conversation\nyeah well like i said i mean um i love i\nlove talking\ni love i've talked i if you guys want to\nknow about more about me but like um\ni don't know i i'm i'm more of a um i'm\nnot really\ni know we came into this conversation\nwanting to talk about\nyou know what youtubers go through and\nstuff and\ni'll tell you what like one of the\nthings that my my stress levels\nare always high almost\nbecause of this because my job and\nuh because i want best part of the\nproblem is that there's no job security\nhere\nthere's no job security if you don't do\ngood if you don't do\ndo well enough someone else will take\nyour time someone else will take your\nslot\nuh just like regular tv you know if a\nif a show is not performing well they\nwill someone else will\nwatch a different show instead um so i\nwant to make sure that\ni'm always going to put out the best\nproduct i possibly can\nand um yeah so it's very stressful it's\nvery stressful it's\num but it's it's a good stress it keeps\nme busy and the problem is that\ni'm so busy that time flies by so fast\nit flies by so fast like i can't believe\nit's already february\njason i think you're you're touched too\npositive bro\num so so like i mean i i recognize that\nit\nokay hold on all right so there's a lot\nto talk about here\num you know i can kind of start to get\ninto it and we can sort of discuss\nbut so i recognize that the stress\ndrives you to perform\nright right but it also drives you to\nsuffer\nyeah i haven't had a day off in along uh\nsince i started uh so last my last day\noff was probably 2015.\nyeah so when you say stress is a good\nthing\nyou know like it it has advantages\nso i i think about stress is like do you\nplay do you play games\nyeah i love playing playing games you\nknow blood pages\nno i've heard of it though so like like\nthere are blood pages and\nrandom ass video games and the idea\nbehind a blood mage is like instead of\neight\nit's like zeno so mages have mp mana\nright magic points\nyeah and so like you spend your mp to\ncast spells\nand then like every now and then you'll\nhave a game that has a blood mage and a\nblood mage doesn't have mana he uses hp\nto cast spells\nusually a dude right so it's like you\nget the spell effect but you\nyou pay for it right you pay for it out\nof your own lifeblood\nand and when i think about like content\ncreators and like the stress of\nperforming\ni kind of see them as blood mages yeah\nthey're basically sacrificing their life\nand their free time to entertain other\npeople and that's fine and that's great\nbecause that's what they want to do\nand it's part you know especially like\nthose 24-hour live streams sort of\nthings like you're sacrificing your\nfreedom\nyour life to other people and that's\nfine\nand it's normal i guess but i'm just\nsaying like that's\nthat's part of the job you know you're\nsacrificing your freedom\nand your livelihood and your in your\nlife to other people\nyeah but that's not fine so is it\nnormal sure okay oh so just because it's\nyeah just because it's normal doesn't\nmean it's okay\nright right so so and and this is the\nwild thing right so like we see this a\nlot like y'all aren't the only ones that\nare blood mages like\nother examples of blood mages are\ninvestment bankers\nright they're like i'm gonna just give\nmy youth\nin my sweat and my stomach ulcers\nfor the sake of this contract and you\nhave it you haven't had a day off since\n2015.\nwell i i [ __ ] way that that's healthy\nwell it is though because the way i pace\nout my day is very\nuh so what i've done what i decided to\ndo for 2021\nis to force myself to travel more um\nokay and to to go do things i can still\nwork because what i do is i can get all\nmy work done on the plane\nso i'm gonna i'm gonna add i'm gonna\ndisagree\nso i'm not saying that you haven't found\na sustainable way\nto not take a day off in five years\ni still wouldn't call that healthy just\nthere's a there's a sure you have it\nturned into a dumpster fire of a human\nbeing\nand it sounds like you're actually doing\nreally well for yourself but like\nthe standard of health is not be like\nit's not the absence of being a dumpster\nfire\nyeah right it sounds like you had a\nreally fulfilling relationship for a\ncouple years you have good relationships\nwith your\nyour your family you connect with people\nyou educate people\nyou enjoy things about your day maybe\nyou've got a dog that you play with on a\nregular basis\nlike who knows sure i'm not saying that\nyou haven't learned to adapt and this is\nwhat we see with content creators\nis that they like they come up with a\nsystem that functions\nyeah but that doesn't mean that it's\nhealthy\ni don't feel unhealthy that's the weird\nthing i don't um\ni feel like if i took a day off i'd be\nbored\nyeah so so uh so so this is where maybe\ni'm the one\nwho needs to disagree with myself so if\nall of the people that i think that\ncan build a healthy lifestyle without\ntaking a day off in five years you may\nbe at the top of the list\nit may really be that the work is just\nso uh but here's the question\nanyway so but you still use the word\nstress to describe it\nright i mean it's a good stress because\nyou want to make sure\nbecause i'm technically a performer even\nthough i'm not doing anything\num so you want to make sure you're at\nthe top of the top of your game\nyeah so this is where i think that\nthere's like a lot to be learned and\nthankfully there are systems at place\nto um you know\nhelp people stay at the top of their\ngame and build a\nwork life balance right so so this is\nwhere i think\nyou really may be an outlier but like a\nlot of like you know content creators\nfeel burnt out i don't get the sense\nthat you feel burnt out\nno i i i like i said i i am\nhere so here's the reason why the reason\nwhy is because i think i'm a little\ncrazy and in the aspect\nthank you in the aspect that i know i'm\nnot good at anything\nother than this so i don't want to go\nback to my bank job i know i can never\ndo another\nregular job ever again because because\nof this\nand since i'm so insane about not going\nback there\ni should work so hard to make sure that\ndoesn't happen\nbecause i i worked for a fortune 500\ncompany\ni hated every second of it that was\nthe worst most depressing days of my\nlife\nlike i would wake up and i'd be like\ni would be upset that i was still alive\ni would be like why is this my life\ni cannot believe this is my life i'd\nwake up every day miserable\nyes that is not my situation right now\njason what i think makes you an outlier\nis you have\nyou have somehow managed to describe\ngratitude and desperation with one\nrolled up emotion\nwhat you described there is both abject\ndesperation\nand endless gratitude yeah\nyeah exactly because i i don't think i\nwould be the person\nthat i am on youtube if i didn't have\nthat bank job first\nbecause if you have everything handed to\nyou on a silver platter\nyou're never gonna know if you're always\nwhat right if you're\nif you're always um winning you're not\ngoing to\ni think failing is very important and\nthe formation of someone's personality\nand the formation of someone's morals\nand how they go about their\ntheir life yeah i think that that's also\ni've i sort of found the same thing so\nwhen i went when i started medical\nschool i had failed a lot\nyeah and i found that it really made med\nschool like really easy\nbut it's like well because so so i was\nwith a group of kids who were\npresumably sort of like your sister\nright so they were like valedictorian of\ntheir high school\ntop of their class in college like the\naverage gp college gpa for like pre-meds\nis like 3.8\nor 3.7 or something right so like\nmaybe a b here or there but like all a's\nhighly motivated smart kids top of their\nclass disciplined\nstudy super hard and then there was me i\nkind of scraped in\nand you look working you had a question\nno so you're probably so it doesn't\nreally matter because you're you're on\nthe same level now as everyone else\nlike same level yeah you you might have\nstarted off in a different place\nsure sure that's one way to think about\nit but but i actually think my level was\nway better than their level\nbecause because i had known what it was\nlike to fail to like really fail\nso one of my friends um was at harvard\nlaw school and i asked him like\nyou know how's your i was excited for\nhim so his first semester ended and and\nwe were kind of catching up and i was\nlike\nyou know how is it and he's like it's\nawful i was like\nwhat do you mean it's awful like it you\nknow is it everyone's super depressed\nand i was like what do you mean\neveryone's super depressed i thought\nlike everyone wanted to go there\nand then he said something he's super\nwise guy\nlike not like not a wise guy but he's\nlike actually like wisdom\nhe has a wisdom and he was like one of\nthe worst things you can do\nto a child or a person is like to take a\ngroup of people who have always been the\nbest\nand suddenly make them average oh yeah\nthat's true and and\nthat's what med school is sort of like\nand then like suddenly kit like these\nkids because they felt like kids to me i\nmean i was four years older than them so\nyou know not really it's like 27 28 and\nthey were like 22 23.\num and they would get like a b\nand it would be like devastating\ndevastating yeah or\nor you know they'd get some feedback and\na doctor would be like hey like you\nreally\nneed to do a better job with you know\nyour auscultation and listening to heart\nsounds because this is like\nbecause it's not just book knowledge\nit's like you know\nyeah yeah and i'm not really sorry i was\nsorry i'm kind of getting random here\nbut like\nfor people for doctors that that you\nknow graduated\n30 years ago um do they have to take\nmandatory courses to catch up on\nall the new like medical nausea comes\nout yes\nthey do okay so it's like mandatory like\nyes it's mandatory\nso there's a certain amount of\ncontinuing medical education that you\nhave to do\nto maintain your license i believe so\ntechnically you're always in medical\nschool if you're a doctor\nyes you're damn right there's there was\none interesting statistic that 50\nof what you know 50\nof what you learned during medical\nschool will be replaced by the end of\nmedical school\nwell i don't think the statistic is\nquite that high\nbecause you know like you learn things\nlike where the heart is in the body and\nthat [ __ ] ain't gonna change\nyou know um there is some weird\ncardiac inversus or something where\npeople have a heart on the right side of\ntheir body but generally speaking like\nyou know the location of the heart isn't\ngonna change\nyeah um but but you know there's there\nare lots of advances and things like\nthat\nanyway kind of going back to um\ni don't know why i was telling the story\nbut i'll finish it now but i i think\nyou know oh you were talking about how\nyou wouldn't be who you are today unless\nyou worked at the bank and so i kind of\nfelt the same way\nthat in in med school it was sort of\neasy because like people would kind of\nget yelled at by\nor not even get yelled at they would\njust be told publicly that they made a\nmistake\nand like they they don't even know what\nfailure looks like so it feels like\nfailure to them like\nthis is nothing yeah i don't think\npeople really truly understand\nhow important it is to fail like if you\nif\nyou know if you're just given everything\nyou're not going to learn anything you\nhave to learn in order to appreciate in\norder to\nappreciate what you have and that's why\na lot of people\num that's why that's why i love you know\nrag to riches stories you know\na poor guy it went up and became a\nmillionaire in the nba like or something\nlike that i just love stories like that\nbecause\nthey are and they always give back to\nthe community in some sort because like\ni know where i came from my community\nwas very rough it was whatever and then\nthey give back and it's beautiful\nbecause they understand the pain\nyou know there's not it's beautiful yeah\ni mean giving back is why we're here on\ntwitch today\nso i was like man there were a bunch of\nnoobs look at all these [ __ ] noobs\nthat are just like me\nyeah and they sailing i still remember\nyou know going to a christmas party in\nmy hometown where i met people that i\nhad gone to call like i mean so we were\nin high school together and we all went\nto college\nwe were all pre-med and so the funny\nthing was they were like\ndone with medical school and they were\ngoing off to be like surgeons and\nophthalmologists and stuff like that\nand um i went to this christmas party\nand then\nyou know we were all catching up because\nwe hadn't seen each other in years and i\nwas like oh what are you doing they're\nlike yeah i'm gonna go be like a\nent surgeon i was like cool and they're\nlike what are you up to and like i was\nlike i'm applying to medical school\nyeah we're like the same age right yeah\nand and so it's it can feel bad but it's\nlike it makes you who you are\nright right um and and i i think that\nlike this kind of goes back to\nthis idea of beautiful not beautiful\ncomparing ego\nyou know the only time you're going to\nfeel insufficient\nis when you hold up a standard that\nisn't yourself\nwell it's funny how my standards have\nchanged like back when\nback when i was a very small youtube\nchannel i was like oh my gosh\na million views a video yes awesome it's\nlike i'm not saying it's like it's cocky\nbut it's like your\nyour idea of success\nis like any business or\nyou always want to see improvement in\nany sort of business or whatever and if\nyou don't you're going oh my gosh\nwhat's going on what's happening like\nstudy for businesses is good\nbut ultimately what they want to do is\nthey want to grow and i think the same\nas things with youtubers like want to\nconstantly be growing they want to\nconstantly be better\nbecause if they're not they go what am i\ndoing wrong\nyeah so that's where jason to be honest\ni mean so like as an organization we\nsupport content creators through this\nkind of stuff\nso it's a lot of work that i i mean in\nmy in my private practice i work with a\nlot of\num you know my clinic i work with a lot\nof like people who are like obsessed\nwith being the best\nyeah and we sort of teach them you know\nhow to recalibrate a little bit\nhow to like let go some of that stress\nso i think a good example is like the\nnuance between ahimsa\nin the fear of not wanting to hurt\nsomeone right and how\nboth of those things may sound the same\nbut one is actually going to like\nkeep you from living life and one is\ngoing to like let you\nlive life with like a strong guiding\ncompass that actually gives you strength\nright you know and so like to enter\nevery relationship so one is gonna keep\nyou from a relationship\nand the other is gonna allow you to\nenter into a relationship with this idea\nthat like\ni'm gonna do my best not to hurt this\nperson\nwell i mean not like not hurt them and\nphysically hurt them\nbut like you know hurt their feelings\nyou know i know yeah\ni just want to clarify youtube drama\ni would be really surprised on maybe\nthis is just my naivete but i'm pretty\nsure\neveryone knows we're not talking about\nphysical abuse or even\nbeing toxic just like you know sometimes\nthings don't work out and people are sad\nyeah i'm pretty sure that's what we're\nall talking about i just want to make\nsure\nwe're good okay sorry if i feel like a\nlittle uncomfortable because i\nam but that's just because i'm i'm like\nthat with most new people\nwhat's like i mean yeah that's i think\nyou should feel uncomfortable\nwell i don't know like because i'm like\ni know how i'm acting right now\ni feel like i'm not um completely\nrelaxed\nwhat's wrong with that um\ni don't know is i because i because i\nwant to i want to show\nkind of show the real me but it's i\nalmost feel like it's not the real me\nbecause it's like it's like nervous it's\nlike nervous me sure so that's\nwe love nervous you all right thank you\nwe love relaxing you too\nyou've never really seen it though we've\nnever seen relaxed you\nnot really okay i don't think what we\nlove like\nwell i know when i was in that zoom call\nwith like a bunch of other youtubers i\nwas i was kind of relaxed there but\nbut i don't know why it was maybe\nbecause there's so many people i i\ndidn't feel like i need to um\nlike i kind of just like could just like\nsay my thing and then back up in the\ncrowd so jason we've we kind of touched\non this a couple times remember so\nbuddhism says\nnot all things are beautiful but that\nbeauty is not worth\nmore than ugly yeah\nthat's the other piece of the equation\nso this is where like\ni'll take you however you are if you're\nnervous\nthat's fine if you don't want to be on\ncamera that's fine\nno no that's not no it's not the camera\nit's just no i i know i'm just using it\nas an example of like you're allowed to\nbe\nwhatever you are you're allowed to be\nfearful you're allowed to be anxious\nyou're allowed to be happy you're\nallowed to be positive you're allowed to\nlie we had this dude come on stream\ncouple weeks ago\n[ __ ] just lied about everything oh\nyeah i don't know\nand and that's fine too right like like\nit's like it's okay to like be exactly\nwhere you are\nyou know i used to be a crazy liar when\ni was growing up i\nused to lie all the time i lied all the\ntime\nand then i think around college is when\ni stopped\nbecause i went lying is getting me in\nmore trouble and causing more stress in\nmy life than i need\ni'm like if i just tell the truth i\nusually get in less trouble\nalso it's just a burden off my chest i\njust the the stress of constantly\nholding on to that\nthat lie for the rest of my life was\njust like just get this off my chest so\ni missed crazy\nhow that changed because i used to be\nsuch a liar i used to lie about\neverything\nyou know i'm like if i lie i'll be like\ni'll feel horrible about it and then\ni'll be like okay\ni'm sorry that wasn't true i'll like\ni'll bring it up yeah so\npeople like so yogis and i don't know if\nreally buddhism says this but they say\nthat a lot of your success\nprobably comes from the fact that you\ndon't lie\nso that means so this is also where this\nis kind of interesting so there's\nanother ahimsan there's another\nphrase satya which means truthfulness\nthe interesting thing is that a lot of\npeople are like oh i'm into radical\nhonesty which means i'm going to be an\n[ __ ] and tell people what i think\nabout\nhow ugly they are and so the interesting\nthing is that that\nin in sort of this eastern system of\nmorality\nsatya is actually like secondary to\nahimsa\nso if truth hurts people like\nthat's you shouldn't say it yeah exactly\num but yeah you know jason i think\nthere's a lot to your journey that\ni think is really maps on to like\nspiritual growth and success\nsort of this model of like you know\nadopting these principles like\nnon-violence truthfulness\nunderstanding who you are letting\nyourself become who you are\num yeah you know and you kind of make\nthese claims like you didn't really have\na personality in high school and i know\nyou\nfelt that way but i think you were there\njust under the surface\nyou were always there right yeah that's\ntrue\nand even now when it comes to stress and\nthe impacts of social media and stuff\nlike that i think\ngoing back to kind of science and kind\nof tying things up where we started\nso you know it's been my experience that\nthere aren't a whole bunch of studies\nbut we do have a ton\nof useful clinical data so we know like\nhow to help people develop\nhealthy social media hygiene we know how\nto help people deal with stress\nand burnout and things like that um so\nwe have\nlike the reason that we exist as an\norganization is because like we're\ntrying to help people with these issues\nthat\nyou know if you go to a therapist and\nyou ask them like i don't know what to\ndo about my tic toc usage like\nhopefully they'll do a good job but a\nlot of them don't right\nbecause it's so brand new also exactly\nright\nso so this is where things like imposter\nsyndrome\nburnout dealing with stress being on\nthis like\neverlasting treadmill of success right\nlike you guys\nyou guys win battles after battles after\nbattles but\nyou never win the war like that's what\nit's like to be a content creator\nis to have victory after victory after\nvictory and like never be able to stop\nfighting\nyeah i guess i feel like i'm just kind\nof competing against myself though\ni got because i i like look back at\nvideos that i made\nfive months ago and i cringe at things i\ngo come on did i really do that\nthat's part of the reason that i think\nyou're healthier jason than a lot of\ncontent creators or at least in this\naspect\nis that you know the more so it's it's\neasier to compare your\nit's less damn it's less suffering for\nyour ego\nwhen you compare to your former self as\nopposed to when you compare to other\ncontent creators\nand this is where if you don't stream on\ntwitch right no\nno okay so this is where we actually\nrecently\num have been working with twitch to\nactually support their content creators\nthrough stuff like this and the program\nseems to be going really well\num but it you know so i i don't think\nthat that's available to you but that's\nsomething we're going to have to think\nabout\nobviously i mean\nanyway let me let me just think about\nthat i feel kind of bad now\nabout what about not being able to\nsupport you in a more substantial way\noh i'm fine no i'm good i'm good you're\ngood\ni know you're good but i'm still allowed\nto feel bad even if you're okay right\nokay i don't know what what's the feel\nabout feel bad about\ni mean yeah it's uh like i said it's\njust it's just the grind baby\nit's the grind yeah what you gotta do\nand i think\nit all stems from the ptsd of literally\nnot being good at anything in my life\nso it's it's just it's like um\nit's kind of like you have someone who\nis raised in extreme poverty\ntheir entire life and all of a sudden\nyou give them all the food in the world\nthey're going to finish the plate and\nthey're going to constantly save food\nconstantly safe food because they don't\nknow they're so inbred with the idea\nthat they don't know when their next\nmeal is going to arrive\ni'm kind of like the same way yes but\njason jason it comes down to suffering\nman\nyeah right because here here is someone\nwho has all the food in the world\nand they still suffer right\nso i understand that you know whipping\nyourself\ntowards success because of the\ndesperation like i said some weird\nyou know real cocktail of like coffee\nand alcohol of like desperation and\ngratitude all rolled and\ni've never heard any i mean it's\nbrilliant because it's like 50\ndesperation 50 gratitude\nand i know you're a resilient guy so you\nmanage it well but there's a part of me\nthat says that like you know that kid is\ngoing to be a little bit\nmore peaceful if they didn't hoard food\nright and i think there's a way for you\nto like\ncontinue being successful\nwithout being driven by\nlike the fear of going back to where you\nwere like i also have a past\nthat drives me forward but i don't think\ni'm\never gonna be back to you know like\nno one can take it away from me like\neven if i lose my job\nlose my license or whatever like i'm\ngoing to be a doctor\nbecause that's what i am i'm going to be\nme\nand and so i think that there is a there\nis actually like a\ni think there's a road forward for you\ni'm not saying you're in a bad place by\nany means but i think if you really want\nto understand buddhism like\nthere's always one step closer to\nfreedom from suffering\nand i think the problem with with your\nstep is that it\ninvolves actually giving up something\nthat has become very adaptive for you\nright yeah what would it mean adaptive\nwell because it's what makes you\nsuccessful i guess yeah\nthat never wanting to be at the bank\nagain in that fear\nthat pushes you to not take a day off in\nfive years\npushes you to you know what like 10\nmillion\nsubscribers on youtube i'm almost at 11\nyeah\nright and and so like who can say that\nyou're playing the game\nwrong like you're playing the game\nfantastically\nand i'm i'm going to venture that\nthere's a better way to play it because\nthere's still some suffering there\nyeah you know it's kind of goofy because\nlike i was so lazy about everything in\nmy life\nand i was so lazy i didn't want to i did\nthe bare minimum for everything\neven when i worked at the bank i did the\nbare minimum and then all of a sudden\nyou give me something that i'm actually\ngenuinely good at something i know about\ni'm more driven than i've ever been my\nlife dude i\ni love that you said that because that's\nlike that's what i've been trying to\nexplain to like our community\nis that they describe themselves as like\nlazy and undisciplined right they're\nlike oh i'm\nsuch a fuck-up yeah and and like this is\nwe see this actually\nin our coaches so\num it was interesting we had a we had a\nreally good session\nyesterday with these parents and then\nlike the parents were talking about how\ntheir kids were like\nthe kids thought that they were\nworthless they were like yeah i'm so\nworthless\ni'm such a screw-up um you know i can't\nsucceed at anything and like like our\ncoach was like yeah that used to be me\nlike i used to feel that way\nand then i started coaching and now it's\nlike\ni love it like you know i'm i'm\nindependent like i\nyou know i do like i wake up every day\nand i like make the world a better place\nand it's awesome and i'm not lazy i'm\nnot undisciplined\nyeah you got you got to find something\nthat that inspires you\nyou have to have something to look\nforward to the next day every day\nyou have to look forward to something\nsomething that inspires you\num like even if it's like that's why a\nlot of people um\nyou know like with children when they if\nthey have children they'll be inspired\nto work hard\nfor their child like that their child\nliterally inspires them\nlike where's that where's that uh from\nfrom the simpsons you know he's got that\npicture of a\nuh why can't i think is his child's name\nbut you know when he's working he's\nthinking about\nhis little baby yeah\nabsolutely listen jason do you um are\nyou interested in meditation at all\ni tried it it was the most difficult\nthing i've ever attempted my life\nit was so hard i couldn't so what you\ncan go on sorry\nyou're so hard yep what was hard about\nit\num so like just not thinking about\nanything\nis the most difficult thing in the world\nthat's maybe\nwhat meditation is but okay well well\nthat's that's the goal that the goal is\nto just sit there focus on your breath\nand all that stuff\num but to really just\nfocu to block out everything else all\nthe outside world is focus on\nyou know uh simple breathing tactics is\nhard\nit's very hard yeah so i think this is\nwhere you know especially for people who\nhave adhd\ni recommend particular meditations\nyeah um because slowing down your mind\nis not going to work for you\nso entering a no mind state involves\nspeeding it up\nso if you have adhd the kinds of\nmeditation techniques that i recommend\nso if we say like you're saying that the\ngoal of meditation is a no mind state\nright\nyeah i guess okay so sure that's a good\nway to put it so like if we think about\na no mind state\nit's a mind that's still right\nokay and so what you're saying is i have\na lot of trouble staying still\nwell it's not about this thing so like i\ncan sit there i just get bored oh my\ngoodness\nwe're talking about your mind your mind\nstaying still yeah right\nso you're it's hard for your mind to\nstay still so there are two ways\nto get a mind to stay still one is like\ntelling it to stay still and you're like\ndon't move\nstay right there no moving and then your\nmind is like [ __ ] that\ni'm gonna go do all this cool stuff the\nother way to get your mind to stay still\nis to have it run instead of telling it\nto be still\nactually pushing it to move as fast as\nit can you run buddy you run run run go\nmine go go go\ngo go go go go go go go go go and at the\nend of that running\nit'll naturally be still yeah\ndoes that make sense yeah i mean i love\nworking out i work out every day\num it's one of my favorite things to do\nif i don't work out i feel horrible i\nfeel\nangry i feel like i don't know i just\nfeel i don't feel good so i always feel\nbetter when i after i work out i just\nfeel\nlike a better happier person it's it's\nlike meditation in its own way\nyes so i think that that's a good form\nof meditation like physical exercise\nuh since i can't if you are willing if\nyou're open to trying something i'm\ngonna try to give you\nlet me just think about what we can do\nbecause my favorite adhd meditations you\ncan't do over the internet\num but i can try to come up with\nsomething that we can try\nsure just hit or miss\nsure let me just think about this\noh yeah i've got a good one\nokay can you um can you stand\nsure let me put my standing desk up okay\ngoing up\ni'm gonna have to stand too\nall right so we might hear you without\nmy headphones because i don't have\nspeakers\nokay so why don't you just hang hang\ntight there for a second\nuh i'm gonna have to mute the desktop\naudio for a second okay so don't uh\nwe can't hear you either okay i'm gonna\ndemonstrate\noh [ __ ] how am i gonna do this because i\ndo wanna\nyou're standing right but you can\nyou can stand there comfortably okay\ncool i can still walk you through this\nokay this is what we're gonna do\nright\nso\nhow far let's do this\nyou can stand next to your computer it's\ntotally fine all right what we're gonna\ndo\nis oh i gotta move this one too\nso i'm gonna stand\nlike this okay\nokay so i've got to get here i've got my\nknee i don't know\nyep\nokay okay and\ni want you to close your eyes\njust stay stable and now i want you to\ntell me what\neyes closed tell me what you had for\nbreakfast this morning\ni didn't eat breakfast i don't eat\nbreakfast what'd you\nhave the day before stay still all right\nit's hard to be on someone but it's\nuh well i signed for dinner i had some\nsort of pasta that was really\nyummy okay so now i want you to stop\ntalking and just focus on staying still\nwhat do you notice hard to balance\ngood i can do this though yeah you can\nswitch legs\ncan i open my eyes yes open your eyes\nall right that's much easier i have my\neyes\na lot easier yep okay so\nnow tell me about what you ate two days\nago\nfor dinner what do i have i have no idea\nthere's probably some sort of pasta or\nsomething\ni have something called um i got i\nrecently got this like food service\nthings\nreally nice called tavala oven so it's\nlike basically like oven cooked meals\nbut it's like\ndelivered it's really cool okay so i\nwant you to\nnow close your eyes for a moment and\nlet's stop talking and i want you to\nnotice the difficulty yeah it's hard to\nbalance just like yep\nopen your eyes open your eyes easily\nokay good\nclose\nwhen you need to you can open\nclose again\nopen okay you can relax for a moment\nso let's talk about this okay so okay\nit gets hot oh i guess people can't hear\nyou because i'm muted\num so\nwhen your eyes were closed when your\neyes were open what were you able to\nthink about\nuh i i don't know i wasn't really\nthinking of anything\n[Music]\nso you were answering my questions yeah\ni was answering your questions but i\nreally wasn't thinking of anything\nokay and when your eyes were closed what\nwere you thinking about um\nwell with the questions you asked me i\nwas struggling with and then\num i was focused focused on\ntrying to balance so it was really hard\nyeah what was your mind doing um\nlike what was it thinking about yeah\ni don't i don't think i was really\nthinking much about anything because\nit was oh so the physical activity that\nwas a distraction got it\nso let's understand okay let's be\nprecise with our language okay so first\nthing\nwhat is the mind the mind is the\npresence of thoughts\nyeah right so when you're adhd like when\npeople say i'm adhd what does that mean\npractically it means\nthat their mind thinks all kinds of\nrandom things\nand so you're like meditation is the\nhardest thing in the world because i\ncan't get my mind to focus on one thing\nthat's why it's hard yeah\nand yet in 60 seconds\nyou've managed to get your mind to not\nthink about anything when was the last\ntime you didn't think about anything\nit's been a while but um yeah it's been\na while\nyeah right so\nmeditation for you so meditation starts\nwith one pointedness of the mind\nfocusing all of your attention on one\nthing\nnow your problem is that you [ __ ]\nprobably went to some mindfulness person\nwho told you to observe your breath\nand you're like your mind is like [ __ ]\nthat so what we're gonna do\nis try to give your mind as many things\nto juggle as possible\nokay and there's nothing wrong with you\nthat that you have trouble balancing\nwith your\neyes closed that's just our our body has\nthree\nbalancing mechanisms eyesight\nour dorsal columns which is like\nproprioception and then like\npart of our um our ear canal\nyeah we have a vestibular apparatus and\nso when you take one of those away\nbalancing becomes a lot harder\nso what i did is like try to create a\nscenario where like your mind has\nno choice\nthat's cool to focus on one thing\nbecause it's like i can't [ __ ]\ntalk about what i ate because i'm busy\nright now\nyeah right and so for you what you need\nto do is like you just\nand that's what i mean by making your\nmind run\nwhere like your mind is like no i don't\nthis is easy for me i'm like okay fine\nlet's\nbump up the difficulty baby let's go as\nhard as you can go like\nmax difficulty so in your case i think\nthis is a balancing exercise now the\ntricky thing is\nas you get better at balancing as your\nbody learns your mind is gonna get bored\nagain\nright okay so you can do this for a\nlittle while\nand then you gotta find something\ndifferent yes and this is why\nadvanced yoga postures exist people\ndon't understand this\nyoga has nothing to do with your body i\nmean that's something to do about it but\nit's not really about body\nthe reason that people do yoga postures\nis because\nthe posture should bring your attention\nto the present\nit should demand your attention that's\nwhy you start with easy ones\nand as those get easy you get more bendy\nbecause the bendier you get\nthe more of your mental attention it\ndemands\nit's so exhausting during i didn't edit\nyoga like twice in my life it's so\nexhausting you're just like mentally\nexhausted afterwards\nyes that's the point it's a mental\nactivity not a physical one\nso in your case you can do this business\nyou know this arms above your head and\nbalancing on one foot\num and then like like what you want to\ndo is like basically\nlike make it hard on yourself so in your\ncase so for some people\nasking them questions becomes easier or\nharder in your case it seems like eyes\nis sufficient\nso eyes open if your eyes are open it\nbecomes easy and then your mind is going\nto start to wander\nyeah and then eyes closed oh [ __ ] panic\nmode\npanic mode we got to focus everybody on\nboard\nall the attention in one place and it's\nautomatic\nif meditation is hard for you that means\nthat you're not learning it the right\nway meditation isn't supposed to be hard\nit's supposed to be that was easy that\nwas easy thank you\nyeah so give that a shot and then you\nknow\nyou can try practicing that and other\nkinds of physical postures and\nyou know maybe you know we ever meet\nagain or whatever like are you\nif you have other questions we'll have\nto figure out some way to like\nteach you lesson number two sure cool\num any questions about the meditation\npractice or\nanything any kind of last thoughts or\ncomments no i'm good\nthis was very fun thank you for inviting\nme thank you for coming on man\ni i really really appreciate it it's\nbeen absolutely a pleasure to talk to\nyou\nyeah yeah um yeah a bunch of streamers\nrecommended\nand that i i i i join in everything so\nyeah\nit's wonderful yeah

around the world and i put them all\ninto\none video twice a week that's only about\nthree minutes long\nso i only need six minutes of your\nattention once a week\ni think about you as the npr of memes\nyeah yeah it's because i want to be uh i\nwant to be\nas soon as you do something so the\nreason why everything is\nvery uh family-friendly\nis because as soon as you do something\nyou're basically alienating an audience\nas soon as you swear\nas soon as you do energy\nso i try to i try to form it in a way\nthat's family-friendly but doesn't feel\nfamily-friendly i could take some\npointers from you on that\num so people are asking\nfor to say the line what does that mean\num\nthat's the end of the stream i really\nhope you enjoyed and\ni'll see you guys again very very
