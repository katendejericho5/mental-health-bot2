    "transcript": "i know what i'm capable of and i know\nwhat i want to achieve\ni don't want to live within your\nboundaries anymore\nand so that's where the name of death\nthe best came from\nwow i'm going to need a second to\nprocess all that\num\nwelcome thank you how are you\ngood how are you i'm doing well today i\nactually got some\nwork done this morning so i feel pretty\ngood about it\nwell good job i'm proud of you thank you\nhow are you doing today uh good i just\nwoke up\nso came over got my hair makeup done a\nlittle bit and now i'm ready\num cool and and so what do you go by\nlike a dip a dab dab okay yeah and and\nis there something in particular\nuh we were on scuffed podcasts together\na couple months ago\nso yeah for a bit yeah yeah um yeah i\nremember you\nsaid some really insightful stuff about\nmental health oh thank you\noh yeah i remember actually we did touch\non the topic\na little bit yeah um so i'm excited to\nget a chance to kind of talk to you more\nis there something in particular you\nwanted to talk about today\nyeah um i was\nin the gifted and talented education\nprogram\nvery early on i think they um the\nofficial test began in the third grade\nand i noticed actually pretty quickly\nthat my interest in school\ndeclined a lot in about\nfifth grade so it wasn't long after\nand the only actual passion that i had\nwas\nthe gifted and talented program after\nschool\nbut all meanwhile during school it was\nlike\nit was just a real struggle for me to\nstay\ninterested okay and then um it only got\nworse about sixth to eighth grade\ni actually didn't technically graduate\nmiddle school\nbut i did progress on to the ninth grade\num\ni wasn't held back and then i dropped\nout of school\nofficially in the 11th grade like i\nthink we were two weeks into the\nsemester\nand i just told my parents like look\nit's not looking good and they're like\nokay um and just to give you some more\ninformation um my brother also dropped\nout of high school\nand he's older than me and so my parents\nwere like okay like we're not going to\nlet the same path happened twice you\nknow like\nwe need to find new options and and they\nknew how gifted and bright that i really\nwas\nso they really you know struggled with\nthe idea of me dropping out they were\nlike we just don't get it you're\nyou're just lazy like what's going on\nsomething's wrong\nso um i ended up going to continuation\nschool from there\nwhich is more of like in if there's a\nteacher there\nand you go for about four hours a day\nand\nthey kind of guide you like okay here\nare your packets for the week when you\ncome back\nyou'll get half a credit blah blah blah\nand then that ended up not working for\nme either\nso i dropped out of that and i actually\nwent to adult school at the age of 17\nand there they had a program for\nnon-adults\nto achieve a ged when they turned 18. um\nand in that class i finally met um\nyou know a teacher that recognized\nwhat my struggle really was and and he\nwas like\nman you really don't need this class\nhe's like you're just not old enough to\ntake the test\nso what he had me do was tutor kids\none-on-one in the back of the class that\nwere about to take their tests soon\nand i would prepare them and get them\nready for their tests and\nanswer any questions that they had while\nhe was teaching everyone else\nand i loved it and i think if it wasn't\nfor that class i wouldn't have gone to\ncollege which my only option at the time\nwas community college\nand i went over there and i excelled and\ni loved it and\ni embraced college a lot and um\ni ended up dropping out though to come\nback to streaming\nbecause at the time i was like this is\nwhat i really want it's here\ni'm not gonna miss it but that was also\na struggle for me because\nit really made me feel like man am i\nreally dropping out\nbecause i'm afraid of school or am i\ndropping out\nbecause of streaming you know like it\nwas it was a real battle because i had\ndropped out of school so many times\num but i ended up just going for it and\nnot letting that hold me back and i'm\nreally happy that i did\nand i actually still plan on possibly\ngoing back\nat least for a few classes even if it's\njust\nyou know learning new hobbies new\ntechniques um\ni'm really into education and and i do\nlike um\nyou know teaching myself new things and\nand being taught\nby a teacher i love being taught i think\nit's great\ni've got a sneeze coming perfect wow\nthat was such a\ngreat um narrative adapt i i thought it\nwas\num and so how are you feeling nowadays\num i i mean\nlike that's a hard question for me\nbecause i haven't been in school for so\nlong\nso i don't know if you mean like\nschool-wise i'm like uh\nnothing you know like i'm happy with the\nchoice that i made is\nwhat i guess i could say there um i feel\nvery\ngrateful every day to just be alive and\num i feel grateful that i have this\njob that i have and and that i have\na home to do my job in and and that's\nyou know\nmy family's good i'm good health for now\nso it's a lot to be grateful for\nyeah okay that's uh\nso it sounds like you're pretty grateful\nand and you really appreciate the\nopportunities you've been given\nyou're grateful for some of the choices\nyou made you know choosing to be a\nlittle bit of a misfit to society when\nit was the right time to do so\nyeah i think that's really common for us\non twitch\nbecause sort of society doesn't really\nwork for us in some ways\num yeah is there is there anything that\nyou kind of want to focus on or sort of\ntry to learn\na little bit more about or understand a\nlittle bit better about yourself\num honestly i wanted to just have a full\nopen discussion with you about\nkind of that whole narrative that i\ntalked to you about because\nyou know along the way there were there\nwere a lot of points\nwhere i was just very lost and confused\nbecause i was so smart it's like so\nbright and i i could pick up topics so\nquickly so easily\num and i always try and use\nmy my stream my twitter everything\nto kind of give insight for kids that\nwere just as lost as i am\nbecause i i couldn't at the time\ncomprehend why i couldn't just\ndo the work like i i okay so\nthere was actually i mean i'm just gonna\nrecall even a day\nin high school where there was this girl\nin my class she\nshe just knew that i had these abilities\nand i think most of the kids knew\nbut they just kind of assumed i was a\n[ __ ] up like they didn't understand\nwhy i wouldn't do the work either um\nbecause i always had the answers\nbut i couldn't do the work i couldn't\nsit there for hours and hours on\non end and just do the work\nand um there was a girl in my class one\ntime and she goes\ncan you just teach me how to do all this\nand i was like sure yeah i'll walk you\nthrough the whole worksheet that's fine\nand i sat there and i taught her\neverything and and one thing i love to\ndo\nespecially when it comes to school and\nclasses\nis always find a way to teach people in\na language that they understand\nbecause a lot of the times i felt like\num you know when my when my peers\nweren't getting it\nit's because the teacher had only\nexplained it in one way and they\ncouldn't fully grasp it\nand they didn't know how to make it\ntheir own so that they could understand\nit\nso i would like sit there and walk them\nthrough that as long as i had to until\nthey understood it\nand then um she just looked at me and\nshe's like man i wish i had your brain\nand that's like something that really\nengraved in my head because\ni i didn't want to take this brain for\ngranted ever\nand it's it's always kind of been like a\nlike a motivating factor for me\nto not completely what feels like\nwasting my brain\nbecause a part of me is kind of sad\nthat i didn't achieve great like\nscholarly tasks with\nwith the brain that i had because i was\nalways\nahead of track until i was\nway behind track and so that was like a\nreally tough battle for me internally\nhow did it feel when she asked you for\nhelp do you remember\nthat's a beautiful story by the way\nthank you um\nit just felt i don't know\nit was just like hey can you help me and\ni was like oh yeah sure\ni i really didn't get feelings about it\nuntil she was like\ni wish i had your brain because i was\nlike man that's true not everyone\nyou know can you comprehend that when\nshe said that\num it was just like an eye opener\num it made me feel it\nlike almost just questioning everything\nlike am i wasting it\nam i doing what i should be doing what\nlike why\nam i it it made me feel good and bad it\nwas very bittersweet\ngood and bad at the same time i can\nimagine\num so i'm noticing that there's a lot of\nbittersweetness through sort of your\nstory right\nlike yeah um being gifted i mean you\nsound to me like\nyou know when you're one of these\ncharacters that like during character\ncreation\npicks up like a negative talent for\nextra points\nand then picks up a positive talent so\nyou're kind of mid-maxed\ni don't know if that sort of makes sense\nbut you're kind of blessed and cursed\nyeah at the same time yeah it's always\nfelt that way a bit\num and and so help i'm curious adapt\nhave you ever been evaluated by a\npsychologist or a psychiatrist\nfor like learning issues or adhd or\nanything like that\nno um\nnever but i do have my first appointment\ncoming\nso i'm really excited about that because\ni do think that i i\nhave one of the few that you just listed\noff yeah that's good so i i was just\ngoing to say i think a lot of times when\ni hear these sorts of stories\num you know there's a lot of stuff\naround\nspecifically adhd and kids i'm curious\nhow big was your\nuh do you do you remember how big your\nclass sizes were\nlike in the third grade fifth grade yeah\ni think we had about 35 i would say as\nour average\n35 kids per class so that's actually a\nlittle bit high\nyou know there's an interesting\ncorrelation the larger\nthe class sizes the more likely children\nare to be diagnosed with adhd\nand it's pretty linear so like um\nyou know if you have like\nyou know 20 kids in the class and one of\nthem has adhd\nif you have 40 kids in the class you're\nactually gonna have\nfour kids get diagnosed with adhd so\nfive percent of the class will be\ndiagnosed\nwhen you have 20 kids and and you know\n10 will be diagnosed when you've got 40\nkids\nand it's kind of interesting because\nwhat we've really found is that\num when you have a super smart kid and\nyou can kind of give them attention at\ntheir own pace\nthey won't get diagnosed with adhd but\nthe more that you\nask kids to conform to like a particular\nworksheet done in a particular time\nthe more likely people are to get\ndiagnosed with adhd\nright you're not that yeah because that\nmakes me\nthink of um okay so to dive a little\ndeeper\nand explain a little more um when i was\nvery young before i ever started going\nto school\nmy dad sat with me and did hooked on\nphonics with me\ni think every single day and by the time\ni went to preschool\ni mean i was like the teacher's helper\nbecause\nthey couldn't teach me anything they\nwere just there to kind of like babysit\nus at that point but they were teaching\nthe other kids and\nand i was progressed and i was very far\nkindergarten same thing\num just very very progress very ahead of\npace\nbut then in first grade and i lived in a\ndifferent town\nthan where i lived most of my life\nthey didn't the kindergarten teacher\nmade notes and she\nshe met with other teachers the\nprincipal whoever whatever she did\nshe was very caring in that sense um\nto look out for me because she\nrecognized that i was just way ahead of\npace\nand so they would have me go and do math\nand literature\nin the second and third grade classes\nwhen i was in first and second grade\nthey'd always have they'd always make\nsure that i was up in the like core\nclasses\nand that helped me a lot because i was\nlike\ni i felt like in school i always needed\nto be learning something new\nor i was just like out of it i i didn't\nwant to pay attention um or i would try\nto and i just couldn't i would zone out\nit'd be gone\num but then in the third grade\nis when we moved to a new city and\nhere they're like oh our schools are\nbetter than the schools that they have\nin that town\nso we're just going to keep her all in\nthese classes\nand blah blah blah so the third grade\nfelt like i had repeated it for the\nsecond to third time\nthen fourth grade felt even worse and\num it just kind of almost at that point\nfelt like torture\nlike you know when they show those\nmovies in the montages and the kids like\nthe kid starts from here then they\nslowly sink down and sink down and\nthat's that's what elementary school and\nmiddle school felt like to me\nlike it was just a montage passing by of\nsymbols on the board\nthat were the same symbols that i saw\nevery year\nif that makes sense for you so it sounds\nlike you were really stagnating\nyeah i i tell people this\nnow i say it a little less because i'm\nolder and i i\ni don't like people's reaction to it\nbecause they almost don't believe me\nbut i feel like i haven't learned that\nmany new things\nsince the second grade that teacher\nthat school taught me so many things\nand even though you add on to those as\nyears go by don't get me wrong\nyou do add on to them you do it does\nbecome a little more complex\nbut all of those core things that they\ntaught me\ni didn't learn anything completely new\nlike\njust to back that up i\nfailed every single english class\nafter the third grade every single\nenglish class was a complete zero in the\nbook\nbut every single high school exam\nexit exam college entrance college exit\nwas always placed in the highest bracket\nalways\nbut i never did an essay past the third\ngrade\ntechnically unless it was a test like\nthat the\nbig state test yeah how do you\nunderstand that\nadept what do you mean\nhow do you understand why you weren't\nable to do essays\nlike you like it's such a discrepancy\nright having a bunch of apps on the\nbooks\nand doing really well on on all the\nstandardized measurements\nthe way that i understand it was\njust i mean when i look back on it\na big thing for me was they wanted me to\nsit there in class\nfollow along do the worksheets which i\nwould i mean\ni'd follow along as much as i could but\nthen they'd also want me to go home and\nspend hours at home and then do the\nessays at home which is where most of\nyour essays had to be done\num unless they were on an exam so\ni just think that i lack the discipline\nif the teacher was not there making me\ndo the repetitive stuff\ni couldn't make myself do the repetitive\nstuff unless it was\nlike an exit exam where i wanted to do\nwell\nbecause i don't want to be stuck there i\nwant to exit\num so that's what that was like my\ndriving factor like okay i need to do\nthis\nso that i can prove that i am ready to\nprogress\nyeah so i'm noticing a couple of themes\nso let me just toss those out and then\ni've got some questions for you so the\nfirst is that\nyou know there's a whole lot of ahead\nand behind ahead in some ways behind in\nother ways\num and and i think that sort of goes to\nthe bitter sweetness of it right like\nthat there's an out like\nyou're clearly gifted in some angles but\nyou also seem to be like\num really struggling or even handicapped\nwhen it comes to others\num where where it's sort of like and i\ndon't mean that in in terms of\ndisabilities but i mean like like you're\nhamstrung right like\nlike there's some things like some\nsituations in which it seems like you\ncan't\nleverage what your gifts are\nto produce something\nanother thing that i'm noticing is that\nyou know it's interesting because it\nseems like you really excel\nat being individually taught\nand also excel at teaching others\nso as as long as you know you're\nteaching\nor it's kind of weird because like even\nthough you're failing the class it seems\nlike you can also tutor other kids\nin the material it was always that way\nyeah\nand and so that you know i i just i'm\nnot quite sure\num where those are going to go but i\njust kind of want to lay those out\ni think a couple another interesting\nthing is that um\nyou know i heard you kind of mention\nthis that\nyou know you assumed that maybe you were\na [ __ ] up maybe\num you'd wasted a lot of time you're not\nsure if you wasted time you're not sure\nif it was the right thing\nyou're kind of grateful for where things\nare now at times it seems like you\nreally\nhad a lot of self-judgment or or maybe\npeople judged you for your performance\ni'm hearing that a lot in your story and\nso i was hoping to kind of ask you some\nquestions about\nthat sort of stuff but are there any\nthemes that\num you know you think are particularly\nimportant\nor that you want to spend more time on\nor anything that i missed\nno that that all is pretty aligned with\nhow i felt and and you do point out\ncertain things like\nespecially the judgment on myself and\nthe judgment from others\none of the things i've tried to overcome\nin my adulthood\nis\novercoming those bad negative doubts\nand and judgments that\ni i received a [ __ ] ton of it\nin middle school and high school from\nteachers\nthe way that these teachers would put me\nthey would be so mad at me\nfor being in that they actually like one\nof the teachers\nwent out of her way to make sure i was\ntaken out of the program at a certain\npoint\nbecause she was mad that i was failing\nher class and i remember that that like\nreally\nbothered me as a kid because i'm like\nit's the one thing at school\nthat i enjoy that i get to do and you're\ntaking it\nbecause you're mad that you know about\nthe class stuff whatever\nbut at that point i had given up on on\nschool\nand i was just like you know whatever do\nwhat you got to do i don't really give a\n[ __ ] that's fine\num but deep down it was it was this big\nstruggle of like\nman she really went out of her way to be\nthat small and petty\nand this same exact teacher one day i\nwas in her class\nand we were working it was like a free\nday working in groups\nand she's over at the front of the class\non her desk me and my group were in the\nback\ndoing our work and we're all doing our\nwork\nbut we start laughing and i'm laughing\nwith the other four kids laughing and\nshe goes\nsamantha dude\nhere you are laughing you're never gonna\nbe anything\nin life this is why you're never gonna\namount to anything\nand i was like and i just looked at my\nfriends\nand i just looked back at her and i just\nstarted laughing\nbecause i was like holy [ __ ] does she\neven know why we're live does she know\nwhat we're talking about does she know\nanything\ni mean some of these these teachers and\ni\ni have encountered a lot of bad ones but\nnot to say that i didn't encounter some\namazing ones\nbut these bad teachers i mean did not\nhelp my path in any way shape or form\nand as an adult now i look back on them\nand and i\nit's like shame on them like that's\ndisgusting the type of things\nto say that to a kid and there was\nanother teacher in high school\num i didn't turn in an assignment one\nday\nand he goes well the world's always\ngoing to need garbage men aren't we and\nhe said that very loud so that the class\ncould hear it and i was like\ni mean yeah who's gonna pick up your\ngarbage you know but\nand i always had to overcome these\nthings that just because\nthese authoritative figures are telling\nme it does not mean that it's true\nand now in my adulthood i i constantly\num learn those behaviors i try to learn\nwhy someone said that to me and i'm glad\nthat i know now that most of\ntime most of the time those things come\nfrom within those teachers had their own\nissues and maybe shouldn't be in the\npositions that they're in\nif they're gonna treat kids that way and\nthose had nothing to reflect on\nme and who i am and what i'm capable of\nbecause when i was a kid i did start to\nbelieve them at some point\nyeah i'm noticing\nthey said a lot of devastating things\nyeah and actually the the teacher that\ntold me i was going to be a garbage man\nwas one of my ap\nclasses that the school kind of had to\nput me in\nbecause i tested into it and i don't\nthink\nhe ever liked me for that because he he\nfelt like i didn't\nwork my way into it or whatever i tested\ninto it\nsure so i'm also kind of noticing that\nyou're the\nyou're the nail that sticks out of the\nwall that sometimes people want to\nhammer back into place\nyeah um\nyeah so adap that's kind of and i i\nassume\nyour name is samantha yeah okay\ni just clarifying yeah i mean hmm\nlet me think for a second is that okay\nyeah of course\ndo you feel like people still try to\ntake things away from you\nyeah can you tell us about that\num i think that\nit's kind of common in people sometimes\ni do try to surround myself with people\nthat are not this way\nbut i do recognize when somebody feels\nsome type of\nthreat even if i'm not doing that\nand um i just pull back from them and\nthen i'm like\nokay so first of all i'm just gonna cut\nyou out\nyou know like you're not gonna be near\nme but\ni i do recognize that people do\ntry and and take things away like my\nconfidence so\na reason behind my name adept the best\ni my original gamer tag is only a debt\nthat's what it's been since the\nbeginning of time i'm like 10 years old\nokay\nbut on twitch i i used to go by a.d\nunderscore pt because the depth was\nalready taken\nand i would notice a lot of people\ncoming into my chat\nand just trying to [ __ ] on me constantly\nbut i noticed that what made them even\nangrier\nand what what really made them confront\nthemselves\nto a sense is when i wouldn't\nbelieve it when i wouldn't accept the\nthings that they were telling\nme and so one day i was like you know\nwhat i need to rebrand because when you\ngoogle\nad underscore pt nothing comes up but\nlike some weird stuff\nso i said what am i gonna do and one day\ni was watching tv\nand there was a guy and his name was\nlike phillip\nduh best and he was on the hgtv show\nflipper flop\nand i was like man there's no way his\nreal name is\ndub best like i refuse to this man went\ndown to the courthouse\nand said yes sir i would like to be\ncalled the best\nand i go if that's not some\nself-confidence type of level that i\nwant to be on i don't know what is\nso i was like you know what that's my\nrebranding name right there\ni'm going to be a depth the best and i'm\njust going to\nact like i'm literally the best at\nbecause i got tired of doubting myself\nbecause of these things you know these\nthese statements and these these\ndevastating\ni think you called it um like\ninteractions with people\nlike no i'm not gonna embrace that\nanymore i'm not gonna embrace\nyour doubts and and your limitations\nbecause they're not my doubts and\nlimitations\ni know what i'm capable of and i know\nwhat i want to achieve\ni don't want to live within your\nboundaries anymore\nand so that's where the name of deaf the\nbest came from\nwow\ni'm going to need a second to process\nall that\n[Music]\ncan you give me an example of so aside\nfrom sort of nebulous twitch chat is\nthere\na particular time more recently where\nyou feel like people have sort of taken\nthings away from you\nuh from twitch yeah like aside from like\ntwitch chat\nspecifically because i mean twitch hat\nshits on everybody right that's just how\nthey show their love\n[Music]\nnot in a super recent time so it's okay\nokay so it sounds like you've you've\nreally gotten adept\nat cutting out toxicity from your life\num yeah i think at this point i don't\neven give people the chance\nto become someone that takes something\nfrom me i mean\ni know that that might sound a little\ncrazy because we're all people and\nsome of that stuff's just bound to\nhappen but um i'm not a person that has\nmany friends\ni i think um i have a very odd\nperception on\nfriendships as a whole can you help me\nunderstand that\nyeah so i don't feel like i'm somebody\nthat needs\nfriends i come from a very large family\num i i have a mom and dad that love me a\nlot that are\nmy best friends so i talk to them a lot\ni have um you know brothers sisters\ncousins\ni just have so many people that have\nshown me what\nreal love is that when i find friends\nthat are not about\nreal love and support i don't want\nanything\nbecause why do we need to be friends\nthen like my brain can't comprehend\nwhy do i need to be friends with you if\nyou can't show me real love like because\ni\ni do nothing but real love to people if\ni if there's somebody that i feel like\ni don't necessarily like or love i just\ntry to avoid them\ni i don't go out of my way to befriend\nthem i have no attraction to doing that\nbecause\ni want i think it's i think there are so\nmany people in this world\nthat we can all be surrounded by people\nthat we love\nthat that also love us i think that\nso i don't need the the borderline\nbaseline\nfriendship sure like the casual\nfriendship yeah\nyeah like the exactly hey you we should\nhang out sometime\nsure and it never happens and then you\nrun into them again and they're like\nhey we should hang out when never great\nfantastic\nexactly around yeah\num do you feel lonely\nadept uh\nuh when i'm extremely sad sometimes but\nusually no\nokay do you find yourself yeah i would\nlike to just add that that has a lot to\ndo with living in texas\nbecause i have no family here none\nso that's hard for me okay\num do you find yourself\nsometimes envying people who\nare able to maintain like more loose\nfriendships or have more friends\nabsolutely not okay\nso i'm i'm at a little bit of a\ncrossroads adept\none is that you know i want to really\nlearn more about kind of what your\nexperience of growing up was\nand then i also feel like you know when\npeople come on stream sometimes\ni'll i'll try to kind of give them a\ndifferent perspective\nand there are some things that uh you\nknow about the person that you've become\nthat i i'd like to um kind of challenge\nsome of the things that you've said and\nthe short answer is that\nlike so for example\ni i i wonder if there's value in\nre-examining some of your\nhard-earned conclusions\num so i'll just kind of give you an\nexample so i think that you know you've\nhad like\nactually like a pretty [ __ ] traumatic\ninterpersonal\nscholastic kind of experience right and\nand what tends to happen\nwith the body and the mind is any time\nlike we get a wound like we form scar\ntissue\nand scar tissue is sort of like in firm\nit doesn't bend\nit's a little bit weaker but it's\nprotective and so there are a lot of\nthings that that you're talking about\nwhich i think sort of like make perfect\nsense\ni think they're very logical conclusions\ni think that they're a way that you've\nlearned how to be happy\nand at the same time i think it may be\nworthwhile to like kind of question them\nand i'm a little bit curious if i say\nsomething like that\ndoes it evoke a feeling in you that i'm\ntrying to take something away from you\nokay when you hear that what's your\nwhat's your like emotional or\ninstinctive reaction\nwhen i hear what specifically just that\ni may want to challenge some of the\nconclusions you've come to\noh i love it um i think an important\nthing to do is just\nalways look at your behaviors is is it\nthe right thing to do is it healthy are\nyou helping yourself so\ni i love it and i'm not a i'm not\nopposed to that at all can i um\ncan you do me a favor yeah can you let\nme know\nif you feel like i am trying to take\nsomething away from you\nor if i am sort of slipping into the\nrole of like\n[ __ ] teacher okay okay\nyeah can please do that for me if i yeah\nif i step into that role like you got to\nlet me know you got to call me out on it\nokay is that cool okay yeah um\nso okay so you so you're okay with me\nchallenging you a little bit\nyeah okay so i'm still gonna go back and\nask you more questions but i'm glad i\nhave your permission for that and if\nsomething comes up i'll let you know\nokay okay but let me just give you kind\nof one quick example of what i mean\nso it sounds like um you know you're\nquick to cut people\nout of your life and you're really close\nto your family you're really close to\nyou know having people that like\nit you're kind of all in in your\nrelationships right so like\nif people are like gonna respect you and\nlove you then\nthat's awesome and you're gonna respect\nand love them and that's awesome\n[Music]\nyeah not really i mean i can cut people\noff quickly\nbut i'm also a believer in like um\nfinding a solution i think\nso if somebody's willing to chill and\nwork towards a solution that's fine\nbut if they're showing me repetitive\nsigns of just\nlike i i think it's important for\nsomeone to care about themselves\nfirst and foremost and i feel like they\ndon't even care about themselves\nthen that takes time to recognize that\ntype of thing\nand so no offense but if they're not a\nclose friend of mine yes i do cut them\nout\nbecause i i don't want to\nget sucked into those things because\nthis takes a p\nthis is a whole process like if i try to\ngive them perspective that i don't think\nthey care about themselves that they\ndon't think they're doing things that\nare healthy for them\nand they just ignore it and blow over it\nand act like it's fine and they're\nthey're okay i i feel like okay um\nwell i don't know like i don't want to\nget sucked into doing the same thing\nthat sounds\nhealthy yeah yeah i mean it sounds like\nyou know people\nyou're not going to kind of i think\nactually a lot of people make this\nmistake where they like\ntry to convince other people that they\nhave a problem\nyou know and and that you know toxicity\ntowards you isn't really about you\nit it's really kind of coming from them\nyeah\ni guess the one question that i have is\nlike\nhow how do you know that\nright so like if you say you know this\nis toxicity coming from the other person\nit's really like hatred on their part it\nreally has nothing to do\nwith me how do you know when it has\nsomething to do with you and when it\ndoesn't\num i think it depends like what are the\nthings that they're actually\nsaying to me like i've had a friend\nbefore come to me and say\nhey um this and this has happened\nthis is how it makes me feel this is how\nif the situation has evolved\nyou know like that type of discussion\nis a i'm being toxic what can i\nevaluate and change versus something\nthat's more like projection like i mean\nprojection is\na literal word i feel like it literally\nprojects at you they're not discussing\nwith you they're not talking to you\nabout it\nit is projected at you so yeah so\nthat's how i know yeah so i i see what\nyou're saying so you're able to sort of\ndetect projection\nfrom another person and that's kind of\nhow you know and and that if people sort\nof\napproach you in a mature manner they're\nwilling to kind of discuss\nand then you're willing to like you know\nif you guys have a discussion about it\nyou'll own the parts that you're doing\nwrong\nthey'll own the parts that they're doing\nwrong that's a healthy relationship\nabsolutely yeah so um can we go back to\nthat teacher that worked really hard to\nget you out of\nout of their class yeah um\ncan you tell tell me what what help me\nunderstand\nwhat they did that was so like how do\nyou know that they kind of worked really\nhard to get you out of their class like\nwent out she told me\nshe talked to me about it and she told\nme she told me\nshe said i mean first she threatened me\nshe said\njust so you know i have a meeting with\nthis person and this person and this\nperson and and\nyou know she had her buddy buddy teacher\nthat was also\num because at that school you had a home\nroom and then you had to swap with the\nteacher next door\nand then and then you'd go to your other\nclasses um and so she had her buddy\nbuddy\nand she goes you know me and her we feel\nthe same way about you\nand blah blah blah and in your notes\nthroughout uh because\nin fifth grade my teacher ended up\nbecoming the principal\nlater on so what he did was he put it in\nmy\nfile um some things that he felt\npersonally towards me and he sent it on\nto the next school\nand then that carried on and over so\nthat this was sixth seventh grade where\nthat teacher\nwas doing this stuff and so she was like\nin your file\nmr so and so said all this blah blah\nblah we're gonna\nsit down and i was like okay that's fine\nyou know like i i don't i never gave in\nto these teachers\num my mom always raised me\nwhere if if adults have a child like a\nproblem with you they need to speak to\nme\nit shouldn't be a thing where they're\ntalking to you so every time that these\nauthoritative figures tried like it\nalways felt like\nlike an embarrassment attempt and they\nwere never gonna do that\nto me because like my mom taught me\nbetter than that\nso all it made me do was like\nthey would teach me uh they would treat\nme\nas though i was a kid that was there to\nharass their class\nand [ __ ] everything up i wasn't that\ntype of student i just didn't do my\nown stuff sure but i wasn't the type you\nweren't like\nthrowing stuff at her when she was\nturned around yeah it wasn't disruptive\ndo you know what it said in your file no\nthat i wasn't allowed to see\nbut that's what they did tell me and i\nwas told this by multiple people\nso it's kind of hard to imagine it to be\nfake\nso i i think it it totally makes sense\nthat i mean i think it's a terrible\npower dynamic to you know\ntell a fifth grader that you're coming\nfor them\nyeah i'm i'm gonna let you down like it\nsounds very\nlike like predatory yeah\ni agree and i think it's a really\nvaluable lesson that your\nyour mom taught you and something that\nit's i'm happy you ingrained\ni i find myself being a little bit\ncurious about you know what\nwhat did they say to you though so they\njust said that their meetings and like\nwhat\nwhat were they trying i mean\num well their whole thing was you're not\ngonna come to my class\nand not do my work that i give you and\nthen go off and do your\nyour gait program and then do everything\nthere\nso they were mad that i would do my\nstuff there and not in their classes\nand i tried to tell them well the\ndifference between your class and that\nis i've been learning exactly what\nyou're teaching for four years\nbut i've never learned this before and\nthis is fun and that's exciting\nso yeah i do it but they thought it was\nlike i don't know they thought because\nwe did arts and crafts sometime like\nlike we learned about real actual\nartists and painters and stuff they\nthought it was like\nsome fun escape you know because she\nwasn't involved in the gate program\nshe's the [ __ ] teacher they were not\ngonna let her near there like no offense\nbut\nthey're never gonna let her near there\nso she had no idea what we actually did\nthere i guess\ni mean that's the only conclusion i\ncould draw from it because she\nshe treated me like it was like some\nescape to have fun and i'm like it's not\nit's fun but we learn we're learning\nimportant things\nyeah so i'm just a little bit curious\nlike if i play devil's advocate for a\nsecond i'm just thinking about you know\nif i have a student who's failing\nmy class and then there's like the\ncurriculum and there's the extra\ncurriculum\ni could see an argument for saying like\noh like you know\nthey shouldn't be doing extracurricular\nstuff i don't think it's a good argument\num but i could definitely see like a\nperspective where it's like sort of like\nif there's extracurricular stuff in\ncurricular stuff\nyou know if you're go after school if\nyou're failing your classes and you're\ngoing in\nand doing stuff like it would actually\nbe in your best interest to focus on\npassing the class right what do you\nthink so you wanted me to tell you\nwhen you were being like the [ __ ]\nteacher yep that's what they did to me\nconstantly that's exactly what the\nprincipal and the other teachers would\ntell me about her\nand it's like that's fine then i don't\nlike you guys have your pact\nthat's cool that's fine but the\ndifference is\nand that they all should have understood\nis that it's\nit's extracurricular that is more\nadvanced\nthat is more challenging that teaches\nthem something new\nthat that shows a problem in our current\ncurriculum then\nbecause if she was learning new\ndifferent things all day she would be\n[ __ ] doing it\nthat was the issue that i had with them\nis that\ni don't want to continue to learn the\nsame it's not even\nsometimes i would want to learn\nsometimes i would sit there and i'd get\nso mad at myself\nwhy am i not paying attention why am i\nnot able to do this why can't i sit down\nand do it for hours on end sometimes i\nwould get as frustrated as them\nat myself but the thing is when it came\nto challenging things and\nalways keeping the ball moving i had no\nproblems i didn't suffer those same\ncurses it wasn't the same sure\nso can i ask you so so did you feel like\ni was being\nan [ __ ] teacher in that moment or was\ni just saying the things that they said\nyou're just literally mirroring the\nthings that they would say\nand and how did you so it sounds like\nlet me just think for a second try to\nprocess what you just said\nand so what you're saying is that like\nit wasn't about\nit being extracurricular or not\nextracurricular it was just\nsince school was so old for you\nthe extra stuff was actually like new\nthings that you could actually learn\nso if people presented you with like the\nopportunity to learn\nyou'd do it but if they just presented\nyou with the opportunity to like repeat\nold [ __ ]\nlike you wouldn't do it i would get very\nfrustrated\nlike it's not that i would look at it\nand go ugh i've done this before\nthat's not the problem the problem is\nthey would sit there\non the board for an hour two hour but\nhowever long they would sit there\nthen i would know that i have to go home\nand do that work that she just made me\nre-watch for the millionth time\nand i wouldn't even open it because i'd\nbe so frustrated like\ni it was hard for me because i'd be like\nwhy am i doing this what's happening i\ncouldn't grasp it\nyou couldn't grasp why you couldn't do\nthe work\nwhy i had to keep doing it again\nlike it was it was like a dread it was\nlike a dreadful feeling\ndeep down like i have to open that book\nand do it\nall again you know like that's what i\nhave to spend my time on\nand the thing is that it would be a lot\nit would be a lot of it it's not like it\nwas just three four questions it would\nbe a ton of it\nand that for me as a kid that was very\nhard it was like\ni dread the fact that i have to go back\nthere do it again\ndo it tomorrow like i was so i would\nthink that way sounds like you were\ntomorrow i have to do it all week\nthat's what it felt like trapped sort of\nin this like prison of like\nrote boring school work that's what it\nfelt like\nlike it felt like punishment so it was\nhard for me to want to do it\nbecause i just felt like i was being\npunished all the time yeah help me\nunderstand that when did you start to\nfeel like school was punishment\nuh like sixth grade for sure because\nfourth and fifth grade\nit was still kind of like okay this\nsucks\nbut you know it'll get better especially\nonce i go\nto a new school sixth grade's supposed\nto be harder\nit's supposed to be new new ideas new\nthings\nbut then the stuff that wasn't new it\nwas just like\nlike it felt as though\nmath and and i love math i love math\nwith like my whole heart\nit just felt like english and math\nand mostly those were our core subjects\nthat we had to spend most of our time on\nand then we were allowed to go learn new\nand explore new things and\nand be taught new because even in sixth\nseventh grade\nlike here's what my day looked like i\nhad to start with\nenglish and i think maybe history\nwhich i'm not a big history person but i\nstill did it i was okay\num then i'd have to go to math and\nscience\nbut it was in that order so i would do\nthe english stuff that i've been\nlearning the whole time\nreading and the thing is a lot of kids\nwere behind\nlike my reading level so it'd be kind of\nfrustrating to know that\ni was the one being picked on by\nteachers but i'm the one that knows how\nto read\nso why the [ __ ] do i have all the\nattention on me if i'm the one that\nknows how to read\nlike why aren't they helping them why so\nthat we can all move on and progress and\nnot have to do these same things over\nand over again\num and sounds like you were really kind\nof persecuted\nwhich is strange because you knew how to\nread\ni mean it felt like it yeah and you know\nyou know when the teacher they\nthey raised then they go can anybody\nanswer this we're not moving on till\nanybody answers it\ncan anyone answer i would always be the\none to speak up and answer it so that we\ncould all move on and do something else\nlike\ni i would always help the teacher and\nwhen i saw them frustrated\ni always tried to help them but when\nthey saw me frustrated\nit was like oh you're a bad kid and i\nhated that\nbut so it would be repetitive repetitive\nrepetitive\nand then pe and then um\ni had an electronics class so i learned\nhow to make circuit boards and things\nlike that and\nand then we had some other type of you\nknow elective\nrandom class so it was like prison\nprison prison prison\nokay now we get to learn okay now we get\nto be kids\nnow we get to do something\nadept i'm i'm sensing a lot of strength\nbut also like strength that's built on a\nmountain of hurt\nyeah i feel like that's where all my\nstrength comes from is just being like\n[ __ ] on and stifled all the time\nthat's where i feel like it comes from\nthat's so sad\ngotta do what you gotta do\nthat's also a very sad sentiment right\nit's sad and i've cried about it\nand i've been sad over it but at the\nsame time\nit's just what happened i can't change\nwhat happened i can't change those\npeople and how they stifled me\ni could only change how that affects me\nand what i do with that\nand that's it that's all that i'll focus\non does it need to change\nno but i'm just saying i i\nthe the change where it needs to happen\nis how we teach children how we\nencourage children\nand i believe in that so much that i\nactually taught basketball for seven\nyears\nand i only taught youth basketball and\ni would make sure that if they were\nstruggling in school if they're\nstruggling at home whatever in\nbasketball\ni was there i taught them i helped them\ni gave them every piece of guidance and\nadvice\nand you know self-confidence\nself-assurance everything that i could\nand i mean my teams did very well\nand they loved each other they loved me\ni loved them and\nit was great that sounds awesome\nyou know it's interesting because we\nalways think that you know the best way\nto like learn\nsomething good like the best way to be a\ngood teacher is to study under good\nteachers\nbut i think sometimes the best way to\nlearn how to be a\ngood teacher is to have bad teachers i\ncertainly know that i learned\num a lot about how\ni teach and learn medicine i i i learned\na lot about how i teach medicine from\nbad teachers because like you have a\nteacher you're like i am never going to\ndo that\nthat is terrible and\nand not only that but i i loved my\ncommunity where i grew up it's a little\ntown in southern california\nand i was like i don't want these kids\nto feel the way that i felt and so i'm\ngonna make sure that my community is\nlike\nevolving from the ground up like it's my\nturn now i'm the adult\ni'm going to be the one that goes in\nthere and and teaches them the way that\ni wish\nthat i was taught the way that these\nteachers taught me not the way that\nthese ones taught me\nyeah so adap let me ask you a question\nso so it sounds like you know a lot of\nyour strength kind of\ncomes from the idea that these teachers\nwere wrong\nright that they were projecting so what\nwould happen\nif it turned out that those teachers\nwere right\num\ni mean i guess that would mean that i\nhad given up\nit means that i would have finally\nsuccumbed to their doubts\nlike just be a subject just be a pawn of\ntheir doubts i don't know how to\nput that into word yeah so what i'm\nsaying is that that it's not that you\nwould have been a pawn of their doubts\nbut that\nthat their doubts were accurate right\nthat\nwhat do you think would happen to you in\nthe way that you view yourself\ni don't know\nso i have a weird kind of thing for you\nto think about so what if i were to tell\nyou that nothing would happen if they\nwere right\nbecause here's the here's the one thing\nthat kind of\nrubs me the wrong way about your story\nof strength so i think you're a very\nstrong person i think you're clearly a\ngood teacher i think you're clearly\ngifted\ni think that um you've had to deal with\na lot of pain and hardship\nand yet there's a part of me that just\nfeels like\nthat that's you and that whether people\ndoubted you or didn't doubt you your\nstrength is your own\nand that your strength exists in spite\nlike so your strength kind of grew out\nof the fertilizer of like\nfrustration and doubt right and\nand there's a part of me that says that\nlike that's actually sort of\ni mean that's true but that actually\nlike\nlet's say let's take your basketball\nkids for example\nso that your teachers don't have to be\nwrong about you\nfor you to give what you did to your\nbasketball teams\nright they could even be right and like\nthey can even have a point\nand just because they're right doesn't\nactually change\nanything about you well i mean\nexactly which is why when you ask me\nwhat if they were right i mean i\ni don't think anything of that because i\nthink regardless i still would have been\nthe person that i\nam one way shape or form maybe i just\nhave different trauma\nthat's it i i don't\nlike i i my brain i can't even\nreally process what you mean with that\ntype of question like\noh what if they were right well i mean i\ndon't i'm here\nthis is the life that i'm in so it's\nlike my brain can't even wrap my head\naround your question\nthat i think is makes me really happy so\ni think that's sort of like so so here\nso i'll just can i just share a couple\nof random thoughts adapt\nyeah so the first thing is that i think\nyou have um\nsomething that we see a lot which is\nsort of like a reactive ego\nso like your ego and your sense of self\nis built out of kind of like defiance of\nprojections of the others\nand at the same time so there's like\nthere's a sense of identity that's like\n[ __ ] you guys i'm not gonna\nlike i'm not gonna let you determine who\ni am which is\ngood but i would even i would argue that\nthat's still ego and at the end of the\nday that's i know sounds weird is\nunhealthy\nand then there's your genuine strength\nwhich is not\nbuilt out of defiance of anything but\nit's built out of like\nlove and care and like wanting to create\nit like a good life for other people\nand the funny thing is that i see both\nin you i see a very genuine strength\ni see a very genuine capability i think\nwe've seen it actually all along\nin the stories of like you teaching\nother kids where you\nknew what your worth was right and then\nparallel to that\nwe have this really common i mean this\nis just how things work so like when\nyou know when teachers are threatening\nyou in the fifth grade that they're\nthey're gonna come hunt you down and\nthey've written things in your file and\nit'll be there forever\nso our psychology has a very natural way\nof responding to that because you don't\nknow\nyour real strength that time right and\nso until you like grow up and you\nunderstand what your real value is\nyou form this sort of protective ego\nwhich is like oh like that's them\nprojecting which is like kind of\ninteresting because like\nyou know the tricky thing about blaming\nsomeone else for projecting\nis that it gives you a perfect pass\nagainst all criticism\nnow it sounds that your it sounds like\nyou actually\ngenuinely get around that because if\nsomeone approaches you in a respectful\nmanner and has something critical to say\nyou're very open-minded about it and\nthat i think comes from your genuine\nstrength\nbut there's this sort of like it's weird\nbecause you actually have a lot of\ngenuine strength where you're\nopen-minded you're really confident in\nwho you are\nyou're willing to accept criticism you\ntry to be better\num you know you try to live up to like\nthe responsibilities that you have in\nyour authentic relationships\nall is good and this is really strange\nbecause bizarrely i also notice\nnotes of this other thing which is\nyeah i don't have the same perception on\nego\ni know that um people tell me a lot like\noh\nego this you go that i don't have the\nsame perception\nand i and i don't you know i i don't\num i would\nhelp anyone do anything that i have done\ni i want to help anyone get over\nall the hurt that i have come over to\nget over all of the\nself-doubt the um insecurities\nthe whatever it is i i\nuse my twitch all the time to share\nhow i got over all of those things\nso you can tell me i have an ego all\nthat you want and not just you but like\nanyone in this world can say that i have\nego that i have this side of me that is\num like it is more of like a facade\nbecause i'm on twitch because of\neverything yes there is that ego part\nthat will not let you get through\nto the genuine strength the real person\nbecause you don't have to do that like i\nget very disappointed in people that\nproject\nthat tried to tear something down or\nwhatever it's like why are you doing\nthat\nyou don't have to do that here you know\nyou don't have to do it anywhere but\nespecially not here when you talk to me\nand you don't need that\nwait can that was really i have so many\nquestions\ncan you help me understand what so when\nyou say talk a lot i'm sorry\nno i love it i think it's great i'm so\ncurious about\num because i i think adapt you've\nreally wrangled with this stuff for so\nlong i'm i really want to understand\nyou know what you've learned through\nthese struggles so when you say that\nthat you know you understand that\nthere's an ego what what are you hearing\nme say\nand what's your perspective on ego\nwhy don't we start there just tell me\nhow do you understand there you go\nso i mean\ni i think that there's there is\nego and i know i know when someone's\nbeing egotistical\nand i understand that and i know that i\nhave behaviors that are egotistical\ni understand that what's an example of a\nbehavior that's egotistical real quick\njust so we're on the same page\num\n[Music]\nthe only thing i can think of is like\ngaming or something\nso get back shitties when you're no like\nlike uh like even\nuh harder than that you know like i get\nreg shitty i'm just messing with you\nbut if i tell you that i would 1v1 wipe\nyour ass like\n[ __ ] on any floor in any game ever in\nthe history of games you wouldn't be\nable to touch me\ni genuinely mean it and i am being\negotistical i don't care even if i'm\nwrong i don't care you're\nit's gonna happen like we'll figure it\nout you know um\nso that's ego i guess sure\num because i do get angry and i will\ntell that to people\num good for you yeah so\nthat is ego and but the thing is my my\nsense\non ego is i don't bring that egotistical\nside that those things out until i see\nsomebody\ntrying to threaten to get in\nyeah so let me clarify a little bit okay\nso you're using the word ego and you're\nalso using the word egotistical and i\nshould have explained a little bit\nbetter\nsure so i'm kind of operating using the\nyogic term\nego which is like an identity or a sense\nof identity that is actually\nbuilt up around the core of who you are\nand is by definition false\nso we all have ego it's a function of\nthe mind it's like one of the parts of\nmind it's like\nemotion like we all have an identity the\ntechnical term is the sanskrit term\nahamkar\nwhich means the sense of i or the i\nfeeling\nso when i for example wake up and i say\ni'm a doctor or i am a twitch streamer\nor when you say you are a woman\nthat is like an attribute of your being\nwhich is technically not true\nso like i'm not i mean i could say i'm a\ndoctor and society could think i'm a\ndoctor but like\nif you dissect me you're not gonna find\na doctor anywhere\nright it's like a construction does that\nmake sense\na little okay so like like for example\nanyway so so so i'll let me explain let\nme just think about how to explain this\nso we all have attributes of our\nidentity\nand and like in ancient india like the\nyogis believed that like none of the\nattributes of our identity\nactually define who we are so if i were\nto ask you\nare you a failure what would your answer\nbe\nno okay did you fail out of high school\nyes then how are you not a failure\ni don't know exactly because you're not\na failure right so that's an\nattribute which you're in your truest\nsense of self\nyou actually aren't a failure like just\nbecause you're [ __ ] teachers like\njust because you dropped out like that's\nit's all a [ __ ] mental construction\nthat you can't\nlike sure you can find an f on a\ntranscript somewhere on a piece of paper\nbut that's not who you are right\nand and so the yogis sort of figured out\nthat like we can have all of these\nattributes that we can apply to our\nlives and our identity\nbut none of those are our true self\nand what i and this is the thing that i\nthink is so bizarre is that you\nsometimes think and i think the ego is a\nprotective mechanism so the yogis also\nsay this\nthat the ego is basically there to tank\nfor us\nfrom like damage and so the ego starts\nto develop whenever we take damage i.e\nwhen you're a fifth grader\nand you know teachers are like hunting\nyou\nand you're feeling trapped and you're\nfeeling dread like ego is\nwhat protects you right like ego is like\nwhat steps forward and says\nyou don't understand me everything that\nyou're saying is wrong\ni'm not what you think i am i am\nsomething else\nand when you say to yourself i am\nsomething else\nthat is the ahamkar that is the ego\nif you say to yourself i am a success or\ni am a failure\nthose are both the yogic ego because\nwhen someone says i am a failure like\nthat's not\negotistical but it's part of like the\nyogic concept of ego\ndoes that make sense yeah okay and so\nthis is the wild thing\nis that when people attack you\nyour ego steps forward but i think what\nwould actually be like really amazing\nis that if it didn't because actually\nwhen they attack you\nwhat's on the inside is really where\nyour strength comes from\nand that actually can't be touched by\nthem and you don't even need your ego to\nprotect\nright so\nthe thing is though i mean as a kid\nthose things penetrated\nyep those things were believed yep\num now that i look back on them like\ni don't i don't really have an ego when\ni talk back on these teachers\ni think that i genuinely understand\nwhy they were the way that they were and\ni've come to\naccept it do i think that it's wrong yes\ndo i think that\nthat there are teachers that are better\nthan that that know better than that yes\nthat these ones were just wrong and not\nwrong about me but wrong with their\nbehaviors and how they handled their\nauthority\nand so yes i ha\nand the thing is i um\nspend most of my time on twitch\nso yes i would like for them to only hit\nthe ego\nbecause they're never gonna get to the\ninside like it's just not gonna i know\nthat you think that it's like a\ngreat beautiful thing or whatever but on\ntwitch it's just not gonna happen\nunless there's someone that i actually\ncare about what's not gonna happen\nthey're not gonna i'm not gonna step the\nego aside for people on twitch\nyeah when you say it like that that\nsounds like a good idea to me\nyeah i just wanted to make that clear\nlike\ni'm gonna i agree with you but like it\nhas to be someone i care about\nfor the ego to step aside not let me\njust like about that because i i may\nneed to\nrethink my approach it's a good point\nbecause i think i think egos are the\nbest part of twitch\nme too i love when someone has an ego\nyeah i think it's hilarious\ni something tells me that that\nyou know the best parts of your stream\nare when you're like i will 1v1 you in\nany game anytime anywhere and i will\n[ __ ] all over your face\nuh i mean some of us think it's funny\nbut i get a lot of hate for it so\nwhatever\ni try not to do it because i know that\nultimately\nit's like those things come from someone\ngetting me angry about the dumb [ __ ]\nthat they spew out of their mouths\nand it just makes me look bad at risk\nlike oh my god i can't believe she\ntreats her child like that oh my [ __ ]\nlike no that's not my chat that's some\nidiot that came in and shouted something\ndumb like that\ntwo different things but that's fine\nso hmm\nall right well let me take maybe just\nmaybe we can explore this just a little\nbit further and if it doesn't get\nanywhere because\nyou've really given me pause and and i\nreally have to rethink a lot of what i\nwas thinking earlier but\nlet's take kind of one more stab at it\nif that's okay with you sure\nso you were saying that the reason that\nyou had to develop that ego is because\nit did sink in\nand it did hurt back then yeah yes\nright so there were dreams that i didn't\naccomplish because i\ni believed that i was a failure there\nwere things that i didn't even attempt\nbecause i believed\nthat i was a failure\nso why do you need the ego now\num it's just kind of for play\nit's not real it's just for play it's\nlike\nyou know when i see somebody struggle so\nhard to to attack\nme or anything that i'm worth i'm just\nlike oh well here's my time to play\nokay so i i can get behind that i'm\ngoing to offer a hypothesis to you\nand i'm curious what you think about it\nso the hypothesis is that any time the\nego arises\nit's because something does hurt that\nthe two\nare interconnected so just like it arose\nwhen you were a child to protect you\nfrom the things that they said and the\nhurt that they said\nif it arises today it's because it's\nstill protecting something that's hurt\nthat's hurt\nright but the thing is like i can get\nover that hurt\ni i at the end of the day i'll always\nremind myself\nwho i am and what i'm capable of i've\nworked very hard at that\nso yes it'll hurt in the moment and it\nwill hurt a little\nbut i will find a way past that hurt\npast those\num weaknesses i will evolve and and make\nthem better\nright but the thing is so yes the ego\nwill come\nout but that's because i i\nrecognize that attack it's like a laser\nfocus and like\nthis person is trying to attack like\nand you know so that's yeah the ego\ncomes from a place because it's like why\nare you trying to hurt me right now\nwhat is your problem why are you trying\nto hurt me what did i do\nwhy is this happening\nthat makes a lot of sense\nthe ego is the one that asks why are you\ntrying to hurt me\nno the real me but the ego goes the ego\nis out there like\noh like well let's get into it like\nlet's play like i said earlier let's\nplay\nlet's play the game love it okay because\ni was about to say because that that\nother question doesn't sound like ego\nlike why are you trying to hurt me right\nnow that doesn't sound like ego at all\nno that's the real me\nthat's a real me being upset like why\nwhy are you trying to hurt me\nlike one thing that i i hate\nis that hurt people hurt people\ni wish it was not that way desperately\nso i try not to hurt people with my\nhurts\never if i know that there is something\nthat hurts me or would hurt me\ni don't like to say it to people that's\nwhy i come up with something like i'd\n[ __ ] your dad\nbecause you know what my mom and my dad\nhave sex it makes me very happy so you\nknow what if someone's mad that their\ndad's having sex that's weird you know\nwhat i mean like just something like\nit's just play it's just all\ngames like hey you oh do you think i'm\nugly well guess what i'll [ __ ] your dad\nokay just shut your mouth\nthat's what i tell people like i don't\nwant to tell them like oh\nyou think i'm ugly like um i know what\nyou look like that big old forehead or\nyours ain't doing no help\nyou know like something like that i i\ndon't enjoy that\nyou just lost me there i\ni'm i'm very uh confusing it's okay\ni acknowledge no i think you're actually\nincredibly lucid i\ni mean you just i i think that has more\nto do with me than that stupid you\nso the real me wants to know why\nwould you ever want to hurt someone the\nway that you are hurt\nthe way that you've been hurt but the\nego will step\nin because i'm on twitch or i don't have\n[ __ ] time for this right now\nyou need to go deal with your own issues\nso the ego will come out\nand [ __ ] with you the way that you think\nyou're [ __ ] with me because you're\nnot [ __ ] with me\nthe only person who's gonna hurt later\non later is you\nbecause i'll get over mine and if you\ndon't get over yours that's your own\nproblem\ngotcha that makes a lot of sense man\ndo you feel like you're ahead or behind\nstill\num all the time i mean i live on twitch\nso how could you not feel that you're\nbehind\ni think every streamer feels like\nthey're behind they're behind on hours\nthey're behind on\nminutes they're behind on this that like\nalways\nwhat if i were to tell you that a header\nbehind is also\nthings that concept grows out of the ego\num well just to offer more information\ni don't want to live in a head or behind\ni i am tired of those concepts i\nrecognize that those have been an issue\nfor me\nis to feel like oh i'm ahead i'm behind\nthem because because you're not always\nahead\nlike you're just not it's something that\nhappens like there's\nalways someone right i live in america\nso there's always somebody\ngoing ahead and a head and a head so i\nhate living in the head and behind\nand i've learned from um my beginning on\ntwitch just like five years ago\nnot to compare myself to others but to\nnot compare myself i need to stop living\nin ahead and behind\nso this is something very new for me but\nit is something that i'm working at\njust to let go of like okay that and\nthat\nand just keep evolving and doing\nwhat the best things for me are to do\nand just focus on that\nso adapt you seem very evolved to me\nyeah and i think so too and um i\ni think this is maybe the one thing\nwhere the reason i keep on heart because\ni don't think you're egotistical\ni i hope you're not hearing that what\nbut i i do think that so ahead and\nbehind are concepts so\nhere are the functions of ego so ego\ncompares so anytime you compare yourself\nto another person that is\na function of the ego this is not like\negotistical or being an [ __ ] or\nanything like that it's like literally\nthe function of comparison happens in\nthe\npart of your mind that is a hum god or\nego\nokay so i think if you really want to be\na for\nfree from ahead or behind you need to be\nfree of your ego and i think you're\nhalfway there\nit's just it's hard because i think you\nsometimes i don't think you're quite in\nin control of it as much as you're\nsuggesting so i\nactually that's not true so i think i\nwould really bet money that there are\ntimes where it gets away from you\nwhich is true of all human beings so\nit's like my ego yeah\nokay so i i i think that i think that\nthere's still so you call yourself adapt\nto the best and so i think that there's\nstill like\na part of you that you know if you\nreally think about it like that's a name\nthat belies confidence but if you're\nreally confident you don't need to call\nyourself the best\nright right so i i think that that this\nis where\nwhere it's bizarre because i think i see\nthese things happening in parallel i\ndon't think you're insecure i think\nyou're actually\nremarkably secure and this ego still\npersists and all of this ahead and\nbehind thinking\nmoves you away from your true self and\nactually feeds the ego\nand the more that the ego is there the\nmore the ahead and behind is there\nit looks like you've got something to\nsay go for it because i\nlive my life on twitch i don't live\nanywhere else as crazy as that sounds\njust in this moment in time\ni lived my whole life on twitch the name\nwas never supposed to be confidence\nthe name was always ego so the name will\nalways be ego\nand the persona will always be ego but\nit's not who i really\nreally am to my core i can believe those\nthings\nin a secure way in a confident way and i\ndo\nbut the ego is what will come out\nand get out get out of control\nyou know when i'm into it in bad\ncircumstances or whatever this or that\nbut because i live on twit i don't\ninteract with many people\nin real life i don't i just how do you\nreally interact with people\ni don't care i love it i i\ni interact with my parents i interact\nwith my family but my family does not\ntry\nto attack me or or you know down\nlike belittle me they don't try those\nthings so\ni mean i don't know i have felix felix\nlives here he talks to me every day he\ndoesn't try to put me down\nor attack me or or belittle me and\nhe understands the twitch world he\nunderstands my lifestyle\nso and i have a couple friends uh\nxqc oh okay we lived together um\nfor about three three years\nand um so\ni have friends in real life like melina\nhas become one of my real life friends\nand i have friends from high school i\nhave two but one of them i just don't\ntalk to anymore\nand the other one i'm starting not to\ntalk to anymore and that has a lot to do\nwith because our schedules don't add up\nour lifestyles don't add up um just\nthey're into some bad behaviors that i\ndon't feel comfortable talking about on\nstream\nand i'm okay with distancing myself from\nthose people even though they meant a\nlot to me in my past\nand they are my best friends um\nand like i i see them and i talk to them\nand i hang out\nbut they're not trying they're like i\ndon't interact with humans i don't go to\nwork and deal with people that i don't\nlike\neven at the grocery store i don't\ninteract with people i\nhere's your card here's your bags\ngoodbye like that's it\nlike i don't know i'm i don't mind it i\ndon't\nsee anything i think it's a fun\nenjoyable thing\num i wish that there were things i could\ndo\nthat would put me in interaction with\nmore people like i wish i could go\nplay like local softball or local\num community college but with\ncoronavirus right now i just can't\nbut um i do kind of wish that i could do\nthat but i know that i'll do it in time\nso it's fine\nyeah i i think uh adapt is there\nanything i can help you with\nuh yes but nothing that i\nfeel comfortable talking on stream\nthat's for sure\nokay because because it's interesting\nbecause i i mean i appreciate the story\nthat you're telling but i find myself\nsort of\ndigging like like the reason i started\ntalking about the ego and stuff is\nbecause i feel like there's something\nlike i don't\nunderstand you know what the problem is\ni know i know so because that's that's\nthe best i could come up with\nyeah um i mean\nyour people reached out and they were\nlike hey do you want to come on dr k\nand i was like oh putting all my mental\nissues out into the world and i was like\nno like i don't want to you know do that\nthat's what they're like\nso i was like the only thing that i'd\nreally care to talk about on stream\nwould be\num you know like sharing my\nit was just kind of sharing an\nexperience and openly discussing it with\nyou but it wasn't necessarily seeking\nhelp\nfor anything regarding those things i\nget that and that's totally fine\num it's just i i figured like you know\nat this point in the conversation\nhaving talked to you for a while i sort\nof went down the ego road just to\nbecause like i said i don't think you've\ngot a problem with it it was just\nbecause i think it's like you're a\nreally good example of someone\nwho has confidence and ego and the way\nthat you talk about it makes perfect\nsense like i think very few people\nunderstand when you say\nadept the best is ego that's not me like\nthat makes perfect sense\nright so so you're someone who's really\nunderstood that like\nthere's a difference between the self\nand the ego and the ego is like a\nprogram that like you turn on your\ncomputer and then it does particular\nthings\nand then you can like turn it off um it\nalso makes perfect sense to me that like\nyou know the ego you make a really\nstrong argument for the ego being like\na necessary part of twitch which frankly\nit's a necessary part of life\nso like if you really have no ego like\nyou suck at the game of life\nbecause you won't advocate for a\npromotion you won't advocate for\nyou know all kinds of things to like\nadvance your worldly life\num you know i i do think that a lot of\nthe real place to grow i think for you\nis just that\nto recognize like if i could give you\none bit of information we don't have to\nget more into it\nbut just this ahead and behind thing\njust so you understand it's part of\nego so so that if you really want to be\nfree\nfrom sort of like the shackles\nof ahead and behind ego dissolution\ntechniques or further protect uh\nrestraining the ego is going to be like\nhow you free yourself from that\nbut you figured out most of it on your\nown like that\nyou go is comparison and things like\nthat for me\nmy worry would be how do i live without\na head and behind like\nhow do i stay focused\nyou know what i mean yep yeah that that\nwould be my worry\nwhen it comes to losing this thing so so\nthis is where\nyour worry is good um because\nin a sense like there's actually like\nsome evidence to suggest that\nif you lost a head and behind you would\nfail\nyou just wouldn't care because yeah like\ni could easily just sit\nin the couch lay in bed all day and just\neat garbage and not do anything not go\nto work not stream\nnot do it like [ __ ] all the i could\neasily do that\nbut but that's it's not quite the same\nso like can i tell you a quick story\nyes so this is one of my favorite\nstories about buddha\nso buddha so you know buddha was a\nprince\nand um like what happened so buddha's\nstory kind of starts out so\nhe's like a prince and he's like loved\nand respected and all this good stuff\nand when he was born um there was an\nastrologer that came and told his dad\nthe king he said okay your son is either\ngonna be\none of the best kings that the world has\never seen or he's going to be one of the\nbest\nlike monks or priests or you know holy\nmen\nthat the world has ever seen and so as\nking is like well his dad is like well\n[ __ ] that i don't want him to be like\nsome holy man like i want him to be like\na king you know because he's my son and\nthat's his job\nso what he does is he tries to protect\nhis son from like all the things like\nall the negativity in the world\num so he sort of uh you know doesn't\nexpose\nbuddha to any anyone who's sick anyone\nwho's old or anyone who's dead\nand one day buddha sneaks out of the\npalace and he kind of\nsees he's like walking around and then\nhe sees like someone who's like\nold and then he's kind of like he's he's\nwith his bodyguard\nand so he's like what the f what's up\nwith that guy that guy's like his face\nis all funny looking and his hair is a\ndifferent color\nand then his bodyguard is like oh that\ndude's old and buddha's like\nwhat does that mean old what does that\nword mean they're like oh like this is\nwhat happens to people as they like you\nknow and so explain\nthe words like what what the [ __ ] this\nis crazy\nyou know yeah sounds like a bug not a\nfeature\nand and then he kind of goes on he sees\nsomeone who's sick and he's like what\nthe hell is wrong with that guy he's\nlike making this weird no\nlike there's stuff coming out of his\nnose and like he's making this weird\nnoise and\nand then they're like oh he's sick and\nhe's like well there's like what's that\nright and then he sees someone who's\ndead he's like what the [ __ ] is wrong\nwith that guy that guy's not even moving\nand he smells bad and then his body\nguards like oh that dude's dead and\nbuddha's like what is what is that\nand so then buddha goes back and he's\nlike oh [ __ ] i didn't realize and then\nhe's like really has this crisis\nand he's like i don't know what is going\non here\nand he's unhappy so he decides that he's\ngonna leave and then his dad is like\n[ __ ]\nand the very thing that he tried to\nprevent he ended up sort of creating\nand then buddha travels around for a\nlong time and he kind of abandons this\nlike worldly life because he's like this\ndoesn't make any sense\nand he goes and he's seeks for light and\nhe becomes enlightened\nthen many years then what he does is he\ntravels around india like a poor person\nso he's like you know sitting on his\ncouch all day he just kind of wanders\naround he has no possessions or anything\nlike that\nhe like teaches people ask him for help\nhe like helps when he can\nbut he's kind of just chilling right\nhe's just vibing\nand then one day he goes back to his old\ncapital city because he's just make\ntouring around india and he's walking\ndown the street and who he sees\nis his ex-wife and his son\nand and then you know they they lock\neyes and the ex-wife is like\n[ __ ] you you know how dare you\nyou abandoned me and you abandoned your\nson and she's like i can\ni can handle that you abandoned me i've\ngotten over it i'm a strong woman\nmuch like yourself adept and she says i\ncan i can handle it for myself but like\nyou really let your son down and it's a\nfather's responsibility\nto take care of their son because he had\nsort of failed his duties as a\nconsequence of his enlightenment so\nyou're totally right\nthat like that's what happens and so\nthen buddha says you know what you're\nright that\nit's like even as an enlightened person\nlike i still have\nduties and that that you're correct that\ni've abandoned you even though i don't\nhave ambition\ni still have duties and so he says to\nhis wife he's like you know i'm gonna\nfix that right now so you say that it's\na father's\nresponsibility to give their son the\nbest of what they have and like pass\nalong their inheritance\nand so let me fix that right now like\nhis son's like 13 14 at the time so he's\nlike why don't you let him come with me\nand then he holds up his bagging bowl\nand he's like i'll give him my\ninheritance\nthis is what he has and i'll teach him\nhow to be a broke\nmonk and we'll travel together and then\nhis wife is like [ __ ] you never\nyeah you can take your begging bowl and\ngo so you're you're actually kind of\nright\nthat like you know in a sense it can be\nhard\nto lose your ego any thoughts about the\nstory by the way or\nshould i just keep going i would love if\nyou kept going\nokay i mean i mean the story i\ni understand i get it my only thought\nis like well yeah but then you know he\ndidn't pay his bills either he didn't do\nit absolutely\nyou're damn right and that's what the\nstory i mean your concern is spot on\nbecause that's what\nlike but literally he didn't pay his\nbills he's just like up and left right\nno alimony no child support you know it\nturned out okay because his\nyou know his wife happened to be a queen\nyou know and and that doesn't stress me\nout less is what\nit stresses me out more yeah because\nthis is what i'm trying to tell you is\nthat your instincts are not wrong\nyour instincts are right and that's your\n[ __ ] problem you figured all this\n[ __ ] out on your own\nyeah right that ego is comparison and\nahead and behind is comparison and\nabsolutely\nand so you should be worried it turns\nout that there is a way\nand that's to think a little bit so let\nme tell you let me ask you this\nso your performance with these these\nkids in their basketball league\nright yeah was ego involved there at all\nuh yeah with the other coaches because\nthey like one of the coaches\nhe would do some very weird stuff like\nhe ended up getting\nthis is just like a local girl city\nleague and he was getting like four\ngirls from his travel ball team\nand i was like listen dude and i told\nhim i was like i don't know why you're\ndoing that we're still gonna beat you\nand we did we did feed him and so i was\nlike okay\nlike good luck i guess but um so yeah\nego came\nout there with the other coaches but not\nwith my girls yeah\nand so let me ask you something like did\nyou\nsucceed or fail with your girls we we\nsucceeded we won the championship\nlike more than not and when we didn't we\nwere in second place so\nyeah so so but how did you attain that\nsuccess without ego\nwell it's their success it may have been\nmy it was\nme teaching them and helping them and\nguiding them but it was their success\nit's not my success yeah so that's\nbeautifully put\nand that's the answer right so like like\nthis is where\nwhen you do something out of service you\ncan\nstill have success it's good that you\nnote that it's not your success so\npeople look at healthy game and they're\nlike dr k is successful\ni don't really think so it's not my\nsuccess this is a big thing that no one\nunderstands right it's it's like so so\nthis is where\nif ambition is of the ego and if you're\nworried about not being able to pay your\nbills\nif you lose your ambition and you lose\nyour ego the answer is like that's a\nvalid concern\nand you can still sort of be successful\nin a sense which is just\nthrough something called like it's\nthrough service\nright so like like when when you when\nyou set the goal is not being\nsuccessful but you're saying hey there\nare these girls and i want to teach them\nconfidence\ni want to teach them that they have\nvalue i want to show them that they can\ndo anything that they put their mind to\nwhen that is your compass you will be\nable to pay your bills\nyeah that's good i'm happy i feel like\nuh\ni feel like i'm on the right path it's\njust like a reassurance like\nyeah and that's true so you can let go\nthis is where it's scary\nbecause i thinking about ahead and\nbehind is\nhow is the playbook you've been using to\nbecome successful on twitch\nand it can be scary to let go of a\nhidden behind\nbut what i'm telling you is that ahead\nand behind causes psychological torture\nand may lead to success\nand it is my belief that you can try to\nmake the world a better place\nand let go of success and you'll be\nsuccessful anyway\ni feel like to to an extent\nmy biggest successes and the moments i'm\nmost proud of come from a place that\nknows that\nyeah because i like i said i i do\ntalk to people a lot i share a lot of\ninsight i share\nmy struggles and how i overcame them and\nthose were my great successes and\nthat's what i try to focus more on like\nmy\nahead and behind comes from myself not\nlike yes other streamers sometimes\nbut i try to stifle that when i notice\nit happening but mostly myself\nyeah yeah i think that's that's so i\nthink like i said i think you've figured\nmost of the stuff out on your it's quite\namazing\nthank you you know for what it's worth\nif you ever wanted to learn formal\nspiritual practice i think\nactually let me think about this\nyeah i was going to say i think you'd be\ngood at it but i'm not so sure\ni i i i i know this sounds weird but\nbut actually i think that you i don't\nknow if you should learn from someone\nis what i mean i i think right you're\ndoing a good job of learning from\nyourself\nif anything it could be hard to learn\nfrom someone i've\nlearned from everyone i've\nlearned from many many sources that i\ncould think of like at any given time i\nknow who taught me what and when\num but with what you mentioned i\nactually got\num a meditative meditation singing bowl\ni think they call it\ni got it yesterday and i used it and it\nwas really nice\nit's one of my new favorite things up on\nthe top right\ni think i just figured out what we're\ngoing to do do you want to learn some\nmeditation today\nsure okay yeah any any like closing\nthoughts or questions i mean\ni i feel like you know i loved hearing\nyour story i don't really have much else\nto say\nno that i'm i'm happy to share it and\ni feel i just you know i i think it's\nimportant to share all of our stories\nand i think it's meaningful and\nand i hope that i didn't come on here\nwith the guys of you thinking you're\ngoing to help me\num yes i'm always open to help but i i\ndidn't mean to like\nmislead you i told them what i wanted to\ntalk about so\ni don't feel misled it's hard to be\nmisled when you have no expectations\ncool um you know for what it's worth\nadapt uh\nyou're partnered with twitch so\num you know if you do have things that\nyou want to talk about more privately\nfirst of all good good for you for\nsetting up an evaluation or like meeting\na psychologist or therapist\nyou know that's a really good place to\ntalk about things with you don't have to\ntalk about stuff on stream for sure\nwe just actually so twitch is actually\nsponsoring our creator coaching\nuh program so i think three years ago\ni think twitch twitch creators\ntwitch asked like their content creators\nwhat can we do for you\nand the two things that that the\ncreators\nthey said three things one is that we\nneed to figure out how to pay taxes\nand such which was like okay and then\nthe second thing was i think some people\nwanted some training in like stage\npresence or like more formal you're\nsmiling is this\nno i love it taxes it's a big meme in\nour household\ntaxes we never escape them and then and\nthen the third thing that they asked for\nwas mental health support but\nit seems like it was hard for people to\nyou know twitch sort of set up this\nthing where you guys can get\nyou have discounts with like talk space\nor better help or something and then\nthey give you guys like access to\ncertain apps and whatnot but thankfully\num\nthey've decided to actually try to\nsupport their content creators so you\ncan sign up for that program it's\nit's private um yeah and and stuff like\nthat so you can give that a shot\nif you want to sure i would love that um\nand then uh yeah so you can you know\ncheck that out and\nyou know it seems to be going pretty\nwell they sort of help a lot so we deal\nwith things like imposter syndrome and\nburnout\nand and those kinds of things um but you\ncan always try that but i think\nit's good that you're seeing a\npsychologist i'd be really curious\nwhether\nyou know they end up diagnosing you with\nsomething or not i'll let you know\nif they do you don't have to but i'm\njust saying it's\nno i would love to share that with you\ni'm so curious about you know these\nstories like yours where you're like\ngifted but failing like\ni don't know what that is\ni don't i don't know if that's just it\nthat can really be explained by a\ndiagnosis or if there's like more to it\num and and so\nbecause i think there are a lot of\npeople out there i'm glad you shared\nthat story because\nuh you know my story is actually\nsomewhat similar i sort of lucked out in\nthe sense that they actually had me skip\na grade\nso so i actually like you know didn't\nhave to sit around and repeat stuff\nright um but then i had my own\nfair share of problems i think\nto put it simply and and it's been said\ntime and time again\npublic school is just not for every\nstudent\nand and no offense but especially gifted\nstudents\nit's just not um as much as we would\nlove it to be\nas much as it's a great thing because\nit's free and\naccessible for like literally everyone\nin america i don't want to get into\npolitics but\num you know it it is a great thing i'm\nnot going to say that it's not but it's\ndefinitely not for every student\nand yeah my my meaning\nfor sharing this story with you guys\ntoday is just any students out there\nlike\nyou're not a failure you're gonna be\nokay like find your path\nbuild yourself up and just find a way\nthere are options you can test out of\nhigh school\nyou can go to continuation school you\ncan go to ged you can do all the above\nlike i almost did\nso that's my point with sharing my story\ntoday\nyou know what i really love about that\nlast sentence adapt is you can do all\nthese things like i almost did\ni think that is a sign of confidence\nyeah right to say that yeah\nyou know i i don't know if you still\nhave i'm detecting some emotional maybe\ni struck a nerve there but\nyou know i i think it's like it's it's\nreally awesome to see you\nown what you can be proud of and also\nown what you don't have to be proud of\nand that you can actually be okay with\nthat\nmm-hmm\nyeah cool okay\nso meditation since you got a singing\nbowl\ni have to turn my camera off though if\nyou want me to go get it\nokay okay we are back\nwell did you not want me to get it i\nthought you wanted me to go don't mind\ngo\ngo get it okay\ni just find myself being curious why you\nhave to turn are you like not wearing\npants or something no because i have a\nlot of coomers that will zoom in on my\nbutt crack and\nit's like i have i have basketball\nshorts on but they'll still find a way\nto sexually exploit me and it's very\nso i just should i should i be worried\nabout that\nprobably no one's safe\ni'm gonna risk it\nno okay no i won't\nwhat what exactly is a coomer again\num well these are like these are beyond\ncoomers like these people have no\nthey're just dude how the [ __ ] do we get\na beyond\ncover to come on stream can we do that\noh my god just literally google my name\ni swear to god\nit's crazy out here you'll find them\nno no but i'm i'm serious i want to talk\nbecause like i want to talk to these\npeople and\ni think that's a great no i'm serious i\nam serious too i think that's a great\nidea because\ni would love to understand why they do\nwhat they do because there are\nmillions and millions of places where\nthey can you know look at women that are\nsexually\nuh you know exploiting i don't know i'm\nnot trying to be insensitive\ni this just how you know like sexually\ndisplaying themselves all the time it's\na great thing\ni love it i look at it so why do they\nneed to put me on sexual display when\ni'm not sexually displaying myself\nthat's something that whole other door\nyou're opening here\ni love opening doors at the end of the\ninterview\num but like though literally can you\nexplain to me what a coomer is\num okay so coomer is literally\nnot gonna explain it in words other than\nlingo\nsee this is why i'm confused because\nlike i you know they're all these terms\nand i can sort of piece things together\nbut the best that i could come up with\nis that\nthere's something involving sexuality\nand it's a boomer that's replaced\nwith a b with a c yes\nbut don't use the term boomer litter\ncause it\nit's just a coomer like [ __ ]\ncoomer cooming it's just like someone\nthat's\nvery horny and does horny [ __ ] or is\nhorny on main\ni guess on main what does that mean yeah\nlike like on their main accounts like\nthey're out here on the twitter and\nthey're\nlike just just putting their horniness\nout there for the world to see how horny\nthey are\ninstead of going and jerking off and\nusing the internet when they're of clear\nmind like a normal person like\ni think ludwig explains it well in one\nof his clips that they could link you\nokay i gotta i gotta watch this and get\neducated\nbut i really i mean if you know\ni would like to i would like to speak to\none of these mythical figures\ni would love if you did that it would\noffer me\nso much i love to understand why people\ndo what they do\nand i would love to understand why they\nmake\nfake naked pictures of me and share them\namongst each other\nwhen in reality like i i think i'm\ni post sexy pictures like why do you\nhave to take it to the next level i\ndon't get it do you know what\ndoes that make sense a little which one\nall of it all of it dr k\nstop trying to have me narrow things\ndown i mean this way\ni i i think the disturbing thing is that\nyou know i think a lot of it makes sense\ni just want to know why they do that i\njust don't get it\nwell i mean just i'm wondering if i'm a\ncoomer now but\num you know because if you say if you\nsay you post sexy pictures of yourself\nand why are people photoshopping things\nprobably because the pictures that you\npost aren't enough\nokay for their humor minds is what\nyou're\nsaying exactly okay okay that makes\nsense i mean so generally\nwhen people you know change things about\nthe world like why do they change things\nabout the world it's because the world\ndoesn't give them what they want\nright but the thing is the more that\nthey do these weird fake things\nthe more that it makes me not want to do\nit for real\nbecause it's like okay well they're just\nbeing weird with it so i'm definitely\nnever gonna do that\ni think you just opened a whole can of\nworms because i don't know what they\nknow you did\nno you open the doors stop projecting\nyou opened the can of worms no you\nyou're the coomer you're the cooper\nyou it's you\nyeah i don't know but i think you know\nwe'll we'll learn so we're here to learn\nabout the internet\nand learn about the minds of the people\non the internet\nso maybe that'll happen let's get to\nmeditation and pure things\nlet's do that okay so um\nyou have your singing bowl so i'm gonna\nteach you\num kind of an introductory practice\nand then like sort of a second practice\nokay okay so i don't know\nuh what's gonna get transmitted over\ndiscord but if you ring your singing\nbowl\nyou're going to hear that there's an\noscillation or a fluctuation in the\nsound it's not going to be one note\nokay okay okay and so\nokay yeah what i want you to kind of do\ni'm going to go ahead and ring it i\ndon't know what you're going to be able\nto hear\nbut you can try ringing it on your end\nand then what i want you to listen to is\nthe fluctuations of the sound and try to\nhear\nas long as you can because the\nfluctuations are going to get lower and\nlower and lower\nokay all right yeah so on three\none two three\ngot it i did mine very lightly i was\nscared\nokay have no fear okay\nbe brave adapt all right okay once again\nlouder\nhuh am i supposed to close my eyes i saw\nyou close your eyes\nyeah okay sorry do it again no it's okay\ni i didn't tell you okay so no you\ndidn't\nyep okay so that's because you're the\none who's a good teacher i'm a shitty\nteacher\nokay ready one more time eyes closed\n[Music]\nokay\nokay so now what i want you to do\nis ring it three times in a row with\nyour eyes closed\nwait until the silence really settles\nthen ring it a second time\nwait till the silence settles then ring\nit a third time\nand then keep your eyes closed for about\n60 seconds after and then i'll teach you\nthe second phase of the practice okay\nokay okay ready\ngo yeah\n[Music]\n[Music]\nyou\n[Music]\n[Music]\none\n[Music]\n[Music]\nokay\ni couldn't i couldn't hold it i'm sorry\nhold what\nmy laughter i let it out a tiny bit so\ni enjoyed it but it's very hard for me\nto turn my brain off of knowing that\nstream is on like it's hard\nto do it because i know it's on my brain\nnever forgets\nokay so then unless you've been on\nthat's no big deal\nokay so um next thing\nto to think about is so the next time\nyou're feeling\nahead or behind okay if you're really\nfeeling a header behind\ni want you to do this practice and\nlisten to the sound\nand then ask yourself\nlike in this moment as you listen to the\noscillations of sound\nhow can you possibly be a header behind\nwhat is it that where what is this idea\nof a header behind\nwhere does it come from and then let\nyourself return to the sound and notice\nthat the sound is what's real\nyou are what's real there's no\nthere's no aheadness or behindness\nhere right like this is just it's just\nreality\nwhere your teacher is good or bad they\njust were what they were\nthey made you into the person that you\nare if your teachers weren't the way\nthat they were\nyou wouldn't have been able to teach\nyour basketball students\nthe lessons that you taught them and so\nall things are just\nas they are supposed to be\nunderstood\nwell thank you for coming on adept thank\nyou for having
