    "transcript": "and all you have to do is avoid going\ninto youtube by tolerating boredom\nand if you can avoid opening up\nsomething on your computer loading up a\ngame like loading up whatever reddit\nlike whatever\nright i use those because that's what i\nget distracted with if you can just\nlearn to sit\nwith that boredom your mind will\nnaturally coalesce back into study\nso there's a particular skill which if\nyou can\nlearn then you will be far far more\nproductive\nand that skill is the ability to\ntolerate boredom i know it sounds kind\nof weird\nbut i want you guys to think a little\nbit about the process of how you get\ndistracted\nand where your days go okay so\nthis is where um so i want you guys to\nthink about\nwhat's going on when you try to work\nokay so like here's you\nand then like here's the book oh god i\ncan't write a book\ni can't draw a book this is a book okay\nyou're so you're trying to read a book\nso you're looking at the book all right\nand so generally speaking what happens\nis your mind tends to be like\none pointed right so this is going to be\nlike a one pointed mind\nand you're looking at the book for a few\nseconds like let's say a minute or two\nyou're like reading the book\nand then something interesting happens\nyour mind goes from this to like a\nscatter\nokay so this is one point in mind\nand this is a scattered mind all right\nso like you guys know what i mean like\nyou're\nbecause you're like i'm reading the book\nand then your mind is like oh\nlike let's think about random crap and\nso then when your mind becomes scattered\nthen then what it\nstarts to do is it starts to go in like\nall these different directions right\nso it's going over here it's going over\nhere it's going over here and and then\nwhat used to happen\nis that over time you'd like your mind\nwould wander like five minutes would\npass you'd be sitting at a library\nand then the mind eventually like\ncoalesces back into a one-pointed mind\nand then you're focused on the book\nagain\nand if we think about the process of\nstudying what it is is like it's like\nfocus mind and then it scatters again\nand then it goes back to focused and\nthen it scatters again\nand on good days you know your focused\nmind is\nis longer and then the scattering is\nshorter\nright so like generally speaking as you\nstudy this is the pattern of mind\ndoes that make sense so your mind kind\nof coalesces and then it's like one\npointed again\nand then you know there are some things\nthat can help this like you know\ncaffeine helps this process\nusually unless you have too much you\nknow so like stimulant medication from\nadhd helps this process\num and so there\nare all kinds of things that can kind of\ncause you to coalesce your mind\nso we also taught um so another uh\nimportant\npart of this process is something called\ndharana\nand pratyahara so we've talked a little\nbit about these\nbut that's not going to be our focus\ntoday these we can sort of explore a\nlittle bit later okay so dharuna's focus\nso these are like meditation techniques\nthat train your mind to become one\npointed\npratyahara is sensory withdrawal so\nthese are practices\nthat um essentially cause you to\nrestrain the senses\nso let's like think about this for a\nsecond what are the things that shatter\num a one-pointed mind so like let's say\ni'm studying the library\nand then someone brings in like a plate\nof barbecue\nright so then like i smell the barbecue\nand then my mind shatters\nokay let's say that\ni'm uh studying and um\nyou know like i hear a ping on my phone\nsomeone just texted me\nso bbq you know sound from phone\nnotification right so\nand then what this does is shatters my\nfocus so the reason is because\nmy focus gets shattered by the indriyas\nor the sense organs\nso pratyahara is the practice of\nrestraining your sense organs so like\nkeeping your eyes focused on\nwhat they should be focused on getting\nyour nose under control getting your\nears under control like basically\nrestraining your attention where you\nwant it\nokay that's not the focus today so all\nof these\nare about moving from here\nto here okay but what i'm gonna what\nwe're gonna focus on today is not moving\nfrom here to here we're gonna focus on\nthis\nphase right here because this is where a\nlot of people kind of mess up\nso let's think about what happens when\nyour mind is scattered\nokay so the mind enjoys being focused\nand the mind enjoys being entertained\nso mind enjoys focus\nright and if we think about mind\nenjoying entertainment what is\nentertainment\nentertainment is simply a sensory\nexperience that\nsort of makes it very easy for your mind\nto be focused\nso if i play a video game like like the\nwhole point of like playing dota is that\ndota cos\ncauses my mind to coalesce into this\nright video games do this so if we\nreally think about it what we see is\nthat our mind actually really enjoys\nbeing focused like the common element\nis that the mind appreciates focus and\nthen even when we\nwhen we think about studying like i\ndon't know if you guys have had this\nexperience but like sometimes studying\ncan be fun like you're kind of in a\ngroove and you're like learning stuff\nyou know in your mind is kind of focused\nit really enjoys that\nso where does the problem rise like why\nis studying so hard\nstudying is so hard because our mind\ngets distracted right\nand so it shatters into this again\nand in this moment we're bored\nbecause you like like i don't want to\nstudy like your mind is like oh let's\nlook at the book let's look at the book\nand then you're\nlike there's another part of your mind\nthat's like no i don't want to do that\nand this is where i think that studying\nhas gotten so much harder for people\nlike we hear this so much more now\nthat you know video games are addictive\ni'm addicted to youtube like i spend\nhours watching youtube i have no\nmotivation etc\nbecause now actually something existed\nthat didn't exist 30 years ago which is\nalgorithmic entertainment\nso what used to be so like let's think\nabout like you know\nlike in the 1950s if i'm at the library\nand i get distracted\nwhat would my mind do i pull out my\ncomic book\nand i read my comic book for like 10\nminutes okay\nand then eventually my mind kind of\nscatters again and then i focus back on\nstudying\nbut now we have something that's like\nway more devastating which is that when\nwe enter these board states\nwe log on to youtube we get on reddit\nyou know like we get on these things we\nget on like let's say\nyou know instagram whatever twitter\nand the problem is that these things are\nnot gonna\nlike occupy your attention so the comic\nbook occupies your attention let's say\nfor\n20 minutes the problem is that the\nsecond you open these up you're gone for\nthree hours\nright because with algorithmic\nentertainment what happens is like\nyoutube is going to suggest things to\nyou that will keep your mind like\nfocused in that direction\nreddit is like this is the crazy thing i\nknow this sounds weird but\ni want you guys to really think about\nthis for a second you are tailoring\nthese websites to pull your attention\ntowards them right\nyou're giving them like a cheat code to\nkeep your attention occupied\nso when you log on to reddit and like i\nhave all of my favorite subreddits that\ni'm subscribed to\nover time i'm making the website more\naddictive to me\nyoutube this isn't just youtube's fault\nit is like\nalso like your fault because as you\nsubscribe to more content\nit's going to be like more entertaining\nright as you watch youtube videos like\nyoutube's job is to make you\nlike enjoy like have a good experience\non youtube like you're not going to\nlike if you open up youtube and like\nit's a bunch of nanny vlogs\nand you're not interested in that it's\nlike that's a failure of a website right\nso that's they're doing what they're\nsupposed to do\nand it just has this really bizarre\nconsequence which is that you're\ntraining youtube\nto be more predatory towards your\nattention\nyou're making it more addictive by\nsubscribing to [ __ ]\nand if you subscribe to a bunch of\nsubreddits that you don't like or watch\na bunch of youtube videos and they get\nall this crap that you don't care about\nposted on your youtube then you're not\ngoing to use the website right\nso this is like the really tricky thing\nis that when we become bored for a\nsecond this is the real loss\nand we get distracted and there's\nalgorithmic entertainment\nboredom plus algorithmic entertainment\nmeans three hours of your life gone and\nno productivity\ngg go next right\nget rekt so the question then becomes\nwithout oh wrong one oh\num\nthe question then becomes like what do\nwe do about this right so like once we\nslip down this road\nwe're gone the three hours is the price\nthat you pay\nbecause reddit is designed youtube is\ndesigned to restrain your attention so\nwhat they're gonna do is\nthey're gonna take your attention away\nfrom studying\nokay because that's what they're gonna\ndo so then the question becomes\nlike and then people ask like you know\noh how do i stop watching youtube\nlike you can't it's going to be really\nhard like once your attention is over\nhere\nto like pull your attention back towards\nstudying\nthis is going to require a lot of effort\nand so then what happens is we look at\npeople and we say oh my god this person\nis so disciplined\nbecause some people can watch youtube\nfor like 10 minutes and then they go\nback to\nstudying okay so this is study\nand so then we say this person is\ndisciplined\ngood night what's and then we say i'm\nnot disciplined\ni'm lazy so this is where the lazy\nperson goes\nso question is okay what do you do so\nlast week we talked about\nbuilding conscientiousness okay so how\nto become\nhow to move from lazy to being\ndisciplined but there's a real\nreal important secret here which is\nright here\nbecause if you can avoid this step\nright here then you don't need to be\ndisciplined\nyou guys get this and so then the\nquestion\nif you can avoid opening up youtube\nbecause once you go\nonce youtube is open it's designed they\npay like people millions of dollars\nlike reddit whatever all of these\ncompanies right\num they pay these like they pay millions\nof dollars to different engineers to\nlike make the website more usable by the\nusers\nlike creating a good user experience i\ndon't think that they're like being\nyou know evil about it that's just like\nthey're like hey we want to make a\nwebsite better\nand so the key thing is that once you go\nover here you're\nyou're screwed finished so how do you\navoid this step\nand then the answer is to learn to\ntolerate boredom\nokay so what you guys need is patience\nif you're lazy if you're good at sitting\naround and not doing anything\nthat's totally fine we're just gonna\ndouble down on that and let's see what\nhappens when you do that okay\nso i'm studying\nthen my mind fractures\nokay so what happens if i just sit with\nit\nright you're gonna have all these\nthoughts and impulses you're gonna be\nthinking about\nbarbecue then you're gonna be thinking\nabout gaming\nyou're going to be thinking about\nlaundry you're going to be thinking\nabout how this guy\nis such a noob and your mind is kind of\nwandering\nand then eventually your mind will sort\nof start to coalesce\nokay it's going to go into this and then\neventually\nit's going to go into this and then\neventually\nit'll go right back here to study\nso this is what you guys need to do you\nhave to understand that your mind\nis like a burden flight right so it like\njumps up starts flying all over the\nplace\nand all you have to do is avoid going\ninto youtube by tolerating boredom\nand if you can avoid opening up\nsomething on your computer loading up a\ngame like loading up whatever reddit\nlike whatever\nright i i use those because that's what\ni get distracted with if you can just\nlearn to sit\nwith that boredom your mind will\nnaturally coalesce back into study\nit'll happen like sort of effortlessly\nall you have to do is learn how to\ntolerate that boredom in the middle\nand if you think about what's happened\nin our society okay so this is kind of\ninteresting\nif you think about what's happened to\nour brains how has technology affected\nour brains\nwhat technology has done is make us\nlike weak at tolerating boredom\nokay so what it's almost like we're\nrunning around with like electric\nwheelchairs for our\nmind and then like if you run if you\nstop walking and you start using an\nelectric wheelchair you're going to\ndecondition\nyour body to with for physical activity\nand walking right\nso what have we done our our technology\nhas deconditioned our mind\nto tolerate boredom and just think about\nthis for a second right like so when\nyou're in the car it's like podcast time\nbaby\nwhen i'm cooking it's podcast time i'm\ngonna be i'm gonna be productive\nthis is the danger right so you'll see\nthese websites where people will talk\nabout yeah i read a bunch of books\nand i like listen to a bunch of audio\nbooks and podcasts and stuff like that\ni have entertainment time and then like\nyou know we're always doing something\nour attention is\nalways on something and we get bored\nvery very easily and so like you know\nhaving everything at your fingertips on\nyour phone is like terrible\nfor your ability to tolerate boredom\nand so what's happened is we've become\nunable to handle boredom\nand as our mind gets weak at handling\nboredom we like lose productivity\nbecause then we get lost in these like\napps and stuff\nand so everyone who's talking about\nproductivity you guys got to understand\nthat\nproductivity starts with the ability to\ntolerate boredom\njust that just learn how to be bored\nif you can learn how to be bored then\nyour productivity will go through the\nroof\nbecause then in those key moments where\nyou are\nbored and you reach for that thing that\nit used to be a five-minute distraction\nit used to be a 15-minute distraction it\nused to be a 20-minute distraction\nnow it's a three-hour time commitment\nand once you like step into the ring\nwith like you know\nthis this algorithm that's designed to\nrestrain your attention for three or\nfour\nhours you are like way outmatched it's\njust your little brain\nagainst hundreds of millions of dollars\nworth of like\nengineering that is designed to prey on\nyour neuroscience\nyou guys are outmatched you can't win\nthen so the key\nis to not step into the ring the way\nthat you not you don't step into the\nring\nis to tolerate border right so like\nwhat does that mean how do i learn\nto tolerate boredom so we had a great\nexercise that one of our coaching\nclients came up and came up with\nfantastic and very difficult is to sit\nand stare at a wall\nfor an hour with no distractions\nand it is devastatingly difficult but\nreally cool stuff will happen\nvery very cool stuff will happen if you\nguys just sit at a wall\nfor an hour i know everyone's like\noh my god one hour of\nnot doing anything oh my god an entire\nhour of doing nothing how am i gonna\ntolerate that\nright so don't even meditate uh-uh\nmeditation is doing something\nnot allowed to meditate just sit in an\nhour and sit with yourself\nand then your mind is going to do all\nkinds of stuff it's going to be like\nabsolutely crazy for about 20 or 25\nminutes\nand then it's going to be like really\nawesome like the second half if you guys\ncan make it\nlike is gonna be amazing because your\nmind is gonna like come up with stuff\nand it's gonna be like weird and\nentertaining\nsometimes what'll happen is like\na lot of negativity will come up you'll\nstart to like realize how bad of a\nperson you are and like how much of a\nfailure you are and stuff like that and\neveryone's like how do i learn\nacceptance like how do i learn to sit\nwith it that's the way that you learn\nhow to sit with it\nright just sit and look at a wall\nfor an hour just do nothing and then if\nyou guys want to you guys can do easy\nmode\nin easy mode of sitting at the wall is\ngoing for a walk\nfor also one hour\nright so get up and go outside it'll\nit'll like feel great like you'll still\nbe bored\nyou're going to want to put your\nheadphones in i want to listen to an\naudiobook i want to listen to a podcast\ni want to listen to this\ni want to do this and like just think\nabout how much you know there was a time\nwhere like okay so i wake up in the\nmorning i'd do yoga i'd study\ni'd turn on the audio book while i was\nshowering i'd list be listening while i\nwas eating\ni would you know as soon as i turn it\noff like on the computer i pop in my\nheadphones walking to the subway\non the subway pull out the kindle put\naway the kindle back to the audiobook to\nthe lecture hall listening to the\nlecture\ntrying to listen to the lecture because\nit's boring which is really hard because\ni've\ni've really not trained my attention\nwell\nand then it's like back to the audiobook\na little bit of stuff on the computer\nscreen phone you know it's like\nour our minds are constantly\nexternalized towards something we rely\non external technological crush\ncrutches to keep our minds focused on\none thing\nand in doing so we have lost the\ncapacity\nto focus our mind where we want it to we\nbecome\nvictims to the screen right because like\nif my the only way i can keep my\nattention on something is if it is\nentertaining enough\nand then what we do is we call ourselves\nlazy because we can't get anything done\nso where does like where's the lynch pin\nto all of this stuff\nit is learning to tolerate por\nso if you can tolerate boredom\nthen your mind will listen to you\nbecause what boredom\nis is the biggest rebellion of mind\nyou guys realize like how much you\ndetest how hard it is to like\nbe bored it's like imagine so i have a\ngreat idea for you guys okay so just\nthink about this for a second\nso i know people aren't flying right now\nbecause of covet but think about going\non an\ninternational flight with nothing to do\nno books\nno electronic devices torture\nabsolute door george eight hours on a\nplane with nothing to do\ngg think about how much you'd\ntest that and what is it that you face\nwhen you're on a flight with yourself\nwith nothing to do what\nlike what's so bad about that\nliterally what is so bad about that it\nis that your mind has no attention\nno nothing to focus its attention\nit's just you you're just with yourself\nand you're bored with your mind\nso if you want to go the marathon route\nlike take an international flight i mean\ndon't do it now because of covet\nobviously but like\nyou know think about that for a second\nlike think about how\nhow much of a victim you are and how\npoorly you\nare at tolerating your own company with\njust you hanging out by yourself\nit's so terrifying terrifying\nabsolutely terrifying so this is the\ncool thing\nis that all this stuff can be fixed\nright all you have to do is learn to\ntolerate boredom\nso just kind of going back to that\nokay so like oh can't scroll so it all\ncomes\nback to this right here\nand if you can learn how to sit still\nwith this then your mind will naturally\nreturn to focus\nright because eventually what will\nhappen is and if you guys are wondering\nabout how is that so natural\nbecause your mind hates form right so at\nsome point your mind is eventually gonna\nsay\nanything i've been sitting on this\nflight for six hours with nothing to do\ngive me a chemistry textbook please\nanything to stop having nothing\nchemistry physics whatever i'll take\nanything anything master please\ndon't don't make me do this anymore\ni give up i'll do whatever you want i'll\neven study for my test\nplease right\nbecause normally you are the slave\nand the mind is the master and the goal\nof what we do here\nis training you to be in charge of the\nmind\nso i'll leave you guys with one analogy\nso in the bhagavad-gita which is sort of\na text on hinduism but\nor i mean it's people kind of in hindu\nreligion\nsort of say it's a religious text\nwhatever there's a lot of good stuff\nin in religious texts and especially in\ngita\nand there's this guy arjun and his\ncharioteer is this guy named krishna and\nkrishna says that\narjuna your mind is like a chariot with\nlike\nfive horses being like pulling it\nyour life is going to be successful if\nyou are in control of the horses\nand if the horses are like doing\nwhatever they want to your life is going\nto be a mess\nand the horses are essentially your mind\nreally they're your injuries or your\nsense organs\nbut it's like who's controlling like are\nthe horses is your mind controlling you\nare you controlling your mind\nand what you guys really need to do like\nif you want to like be productive and\nyou want to be successful in all that\ngood stuff\nis to have your mind do what you tell it\nto do like if you wake up in the morning\nand you're like\n[ __ ] we're gonna study today and your\nmind is like okay\nwhatever you say but otherwise it's the\nother way around it's like your mind is\nlike one of these\nkids who's like a complete spoiled brat\nand the kid is like ah\nwe were gonna do this today yeah i don't\nwant to study [ __ ] you\ni'm gonna play lol all day what are you\ngonna do about it mom [ __ ] you\ngg\nright so learn to be bored and then you\nwill be successful"
