    "transcript": "and it's sort of like you know they'll\nnever\ntell you they're proud of you to your\nface but they'll let the rest of the\nworld know\nyeah yeah and it's kind of weird because\nlike they not only do they not tell you\nto your face they actually tell you the\nopposite\nthank you for coming on stream today yes\nthanks for having me\neveryone has cats what's up with that\num i don't know it's just\nuh i don't know it's just you know uh\nyou had jody on last right yeah we just\nhave cats\nwe just do yeah and what is that\ncircular thing in in that\nit's the cat portal to the cat world i'm\njust kidding it's a cat wheel\nso it is a cat portal to a captain yeah\nyeah pretty much wait\nwhat does that mean it's a cat wheel oh\nit's like\nlike like a hamster wheel for cats is\nthat that's the best but do they\nactually run on it\nyes yes you just train yeah you train\nthem to kind of like\nget used to getting on it and one of my\ncats who's a siamese cat he loves like\ngoing on it randomly throughout the day\nyeah it just goes out on his own just\ngoes on a run\ninteresting cool and um and and so what\ndo you go by\ndo you want to uh you could just call me\nwendy it's okay\nyeah welcome wendy i'm all over\nyou know sometimes people call me dr k\nwhatever you feel comfortable with\num and so is there something um that\nthat you wanted to talk about today or\nor any way that maybe we can be of help\nto you\nuh so i've been wanting to kind of like\ntackle the feeling of i guess i don't\nknow if i really i guess it is anxiety\nand i guess i'm not entirely sure what\nit might be but it's it's more like um\ni guess i stream a lot uh and\ni've gone weeks where like i stream\nmaybe like 12 hours every single day\nand with like with little breaks\nand i find that when i do like i know i\nneed breaks and\nuh when i take them i end up feeling\nlike crap the whole day that i take a\nday off\nokay yeah so it's just i guess uh\ni just want to talk about like why i\nmight feel like crap\nevery time i try to rest okay\num okay\nso first of all i applaud your\ninstinct to not just call it anxiety\nyeah i'm not entirely sure it might be\nbut like yeah\nso i i think that that's um i'm really i\nthink that's a great way to start off\nbecause a lot of times like you know\npeople will say oh i have anxiety\nand it's unclear like what that means\nright like what is what does that mean\nand so i find that the more that we can\nlike use\na specific like the more that we use\nlike raw data to describe our\nexperiences the better off we're going\nto be\nlike actually getting to the source of\nit so let's dive right in i think that's\na fantastic thing to talk about\nso tell me um help me understand\nhold on let me think for a second do we\nwant to jump right in or do i want to\nask you about your background\nokay let's jump right in and then i'll\nask you about your background a little\nbit later okay\nso tell me so first tell me help me\nunderstand like what goes through your\nhead when you stream like 12 hours a day\nfor like six or seven days a week\ni guess well generally it's because\nwhatever i'm doing my\nis just really fun like whether it's\nlike the new game that i've really like\ndove into\nor like just spending time with\nuh friends who are also playing the same\ngame i think we kind of just like\nwe give each other that momentum to kind\nof keep like creating content and like\nyou know it's in general it's really fun\nokay sometimes i just forget the time um\nokay\nand then sometimes i just i just feel\nlike\ni don't stream long enough there's like\nthis\nthere's this part of me where my norm is\nlike to stream\nsix to eight hours and i consider that\non the shorter side of things\nbut i know like when i compare to my\npeers a lot of them stream maybe like\nfour to six which is their normal but\nthen for me it's like\nmuch higher in hours um and i feel like\nif i don't\nhit that number for myself i feel like\ni'm slacking yeah okay\nokay so tell me about that so like\nyou're streaming six\neight hours and then you kind of feel\nlike it's not enough\nand that you're slacking can you um\nhelp me understand a little bit about\nlike what's going on in your mind like\nwhat does his thoughts look like or what\ndo those feelings look like\num i guess like\ni don't i don't i i feel i guess\npersonally i feel\nbetter or like i feel more fulfilled\nwhen i've streamed longer\nthan if i stream like for like two three\nhours i'll be like oh it's like i didn't\nwork at all\nyou know okay just yeah i just it just\nfeels like i didn't do anything\nsure so like the length of it kind of\nmatters to me and um how do you know\nwhen you've streamed enough\nwhen i get tired i guess that's like\none of one of the biggest indicators i\njust feel\nphysically tired okay yeah\nso it looks like unless you're\nphysically tired\nyou haven't streamed enough\ni guess yeah right it's kind of weird\nso let me just let me lay something out\nand see if this kind of\nsits well with you or not so like six to\neight hours roll by\nyou've been streaming and you're like oh\nlike i know most streamers stream four\nto six\ni've streamed six to eight on paper that\nseems like it should be decent but it\ndoesn't feel enough\nand i haven't done a good job unless i'm\nphysically exhausted\ni guess yeah it sounds bad but yeah\ni guess that is what it is right yeah\nokay so so let's just pause for a second\ni know sometimes i'm going to use words\nwendy that are um\npurposely inflated right so like you use\nthe word\ntired and i said physically exhausted\nwhich is like i'm amplifying the word\nthat you're using\nright but i'm sort of really noticing\nthat like you know it's i'm guessing\nit's actually not\ntired like i'm guessing that you have to\nreally\nfeel the physical tiredness and if you\nthink about like you know you could work\na full day like let's say an eight-hour\nday and\nyou're still you don't feel like tired\ntired even though you kind of are\ntired right that's a sufficient day like\nif you want to really feel that\nache in your bones kind of tired which\nis like how your\nhow your body is sending signals to your\nmind and saying like hey\nwe can't do any more and then your mind\nis like\ngood job wendy yeah right\nit's like that's satisfying i mean you\nuse the word fulfilling\nand and and so that's you know it's\ninteresting so we'll get into that\num so the first thing that i kind of\nwant to point out to you is that it\nseems that like\nyou set a bar for yourself and the way\nto meet that bar is physical exhaustion\nyes okay and so\num okay hold on let me let me just think\nokay\nokay\nand now tell me about what happens when\nyou take a day off\num i guess like i'm just as much as a\nconsumer like any other\ntwitch viewer so i watch a lot of like\nmy friends um watch\nwatch a lot of just other streams i end\nup feeling like\ni think at the end of the day i just end\nup feeling like i should have streamed\ntoday\nokay tell me about that um\ni don't know i guess i just i just see\nthem and i'm just like\noh i i could have also been you know\nstreaming i could have also been like\ndoing this\nbut instead i'm just feeling like i'm\nsitting here not doing a whole lot\nwhich is just relaxing mostly or like\nsleeping in or watching dramas or\nsomething\nyeah okay it doesn't feel entirely\nproductive\nand i am aware that i do need to rest\nand stuff\nbut i just i just feel like crap when\ni'm not working\nokay okay so i'm gonna\ndo this thing where you know once again\ni'm gonna kind of send words back at you\nand it's gonna sound a little bit\nextreme okay okay\nso so it feels like you know when you're\nrelaxing you're not doing anything\nlike you should have done this you could\nhave done this on paper like there's\nsome part of your mind that's like\nyou know i should rest from time to time\nlike i should do things for recreation\nand then there's another part of you\nthat like it's a waste of time wendy\nno recreation for you yeah recreation\nand it's also like like if you think\nabout it you\nfeel like uncomfortable relaxing\nyes um i mean i would even go as far as\nto say it's stressful to relax\nkind of i think like sometimes there are\ntimes where i'm like\nthis is nice you know what i mean but\nthen at the end i just\ni just remember like at the end of every\nnight i just feel like\ni end up always debating on the day that\ni rest\nthat i should just turn on my stream i\nwas just like\nif i'm gonna be gaming i'll just i\nshould just turn on my stream you know\nwhat i mean like\nwhy am i not like why am i gaming yeah i\nmight as well\nmight as well be productive yeah yeah i\nguess that's the thought that goes\nthrough my mind\nokay a lot\n[Music]\nquestions anything that you want to\nmention or anything that's popped into\nyour head\nbecause i'm about to shift gears unless\nthat's why i ask sorry oh\nno not at the moment so let me ask you\nsomething\ni'm getting the sense so i'm gonna toss\nout two words that i think may be like\na way to describe what you go through\nlike the negative\nstuff in your mind is not enough so six\nto eight hours is not enough like\non a on day that you didn't stream\nthat's not enough right like it's it's\nsort of like it feels unsatisfying to\nyou so you use the word fulfilling when\nyou're like kind of like\nbone tired and and that's like that's\nenough that's how you know it's enough\nso so what i'm hearing you kind of say\nis that you like kind of are in a\nstruggle with yourself\nabout like getting to enough and unless\nyou get to enough\nyou're kind of like it's not enough\nyeah okay so let me ask you something\nhow long have you\nfelt that way um\na long time i don't know it's it's been\na long time like\nyep yeah like years i would say yep\nbefore you started streaming\ni guess it was it started\nmaybe like a year or two after i started\nstreaming i've been streaming for almost\neight years\nokay so it's been a long time so can you\ntell me a little bit about\num kind of like what your what growing\nup was like for you\nuh growing up i mean\nit was it was good i i did a lot of\nmusic growing up\nokay um it was like one of those\nstereotypical situations where like\nmy chinese parents kind of like made me\ngo do piano lessons\nand uh i ended up\nbeing pretty okay at it so i ended up\npursuing it for my entire life\nand uh yeah i went to like music\nconservatory during the weekends after\nlike\nschool regular school so i had like two\nschools basically\num and then and yeah i don't know i\ndon't know what else to say about it it\nwas just like a lot of\nuh i mean it was nice\njust cause i can't i'm not so you're\nyou're telling\nme wendy that you went to\nmusic conservatory after school and you\nwere\npretty okay at it\npretty pretty okay at it okay\nwho would you say is good at piano\nwould you say you're good at piano i\nthink i'm okay\nyeah is okay different from good um\nuh i mean i don't i would just consider\npeople who are good you know people who\nare doing it professionally you know who\npeople who are like concert pianists\npeople who are performing\nyou know who do it as an occupation okay\nyeah interesting okay so do you remember\nlike what so it sounds like you're\nchinese yes and um what part of the\nworld did you grow up in if you don't\nmind me asking\ni'm born and raised in canada okay yeah\nand um and so what was it like like\nsiblings i have one older sibling he's\nmy brother\nyeah okay and can you tell me a little\nbit about your parents\num they\nmoved here uh when i was born\nbecause there was like the one child law\nin china so\nthey had my brother they moved here um\nand they worked a lot of just like odd\njobs because they weren't like super\neducated um\nthey just graduated high school so they\nworked a lot of like different odd jobs\nand uh they used to\nhave like a convenience store and stuff\nand then afterwards like you know just a\nlot of different odd jobs like security\njobs and like\nyou know things and things like that um\nyeah like they\nand what was it like kind of what can\nyou tell me a little bit about like\nwhat life at home was like\nit was honestly like it was just\nvery normal feeling to me um i remember\nactually my parents cared a lot more\nabout how i did in piano than i did in\nregular school\nwhich was really funny because i\nremember\nlike i used to get like 80s which is not\nthat great you know compared to like\nwhat other people might expect you know\nyou want like 90s and stuff but\nthey didn't really care whether i got\n80s or 90s\nthey cared whether i practiced piano or\nnot\nand what was it like how did it feel\nwhen would they be satisfied with how\nmuch you practiced\nlike do you remember any days where like\nthey were upset with you\nor or maybe you didn't want to practice\nand they were like they really wanted\nyou to practice\num sorry i don't know why i'm feeling\nemotional anyways um pause\ndon't answer my question what are you\nfeeling\njust add\ni think like thinking about this topic\nmakes me feel like\njust bad in general but i also feel like\ni need to talk about it so\nyeah so let's set a couple of boundaries\nright so the first thing is that\nshould you talk about it at some point\nprobably\nit doesn't have to be here it doesn't\nhave to be now it doesn't have to be\npublic\nright so if at some point you get to a\npoint where you don't really feel\ncomfortable talking about it like we can\njust pause\nand watch cat videos together\nand and at the same time i think it is\nimportant and i think there's a reason\nwhy we're talking about\nit so when you when we start to talk\nabout it what about this makes you feel\nbad\ni think it's just\ni never feel like it's enough\nat least for myself\nyeah yeah\nand so you know just to kind of lay this\nout when i ask you about practicing\npiano and your your parents being\nsatisfied\ni'm guessing that they sort of made you\nfeel like it wasn't enough\nyeah i think i think it was always like\nlike you know you need to practice more\nyou need to practice more\nand it was it was the same throughout\nlike\never like my whole entire life i guess\nit wasn't only my parents but like my\nteachers my professors because i ended\nup doing it in university too\nbecause i have a degree in piano so it\nwas it was always like\nare you not practicing like four to six\nhours a day of piano you know it was\nlike it was always like that\ndid you feel like you had to practice\nmore than\nother people who were more talented than\nyou were\num sometimes i think there's just like\nthere was like a bot like a average\namount that everybody should have been\npracticing regardless\nand then obviously you know there are\nsome peers who are better than me\nand so you know you have to make up for\nit with hard work\nyep that's just natural right especially\nwith something like\npiano where it's very it's very just\nyou know a lot of practice a lot of like\nmotor memory and like physical\nlike you know technique stuff like that\ndo you um so i'm gonna ask like\nfor specific memories now okay so like\ndo you remember particular times growing\nup where\ncan you just tell us a story about like\nyou know\nwhether your parents were okay with you\ngetting 80s or wanting you to practice\nlike does stuff come to mind do you have\nany like strong memories around\nthings there it doesn't have to be good\nbecause it was like a really short\nmemory i guess yeah but it was pretty\nit's uh\nsomething that i can recall very clearly\num\nthere's uh the one day i came back home\nfrom school during high school\nand you know i take out that brown\nenvelope that has you know my grades in\nit i take it out\nand then i was like hey mom and dad like\noh i got a 90 in this or like i got an\n85 and this\nand they're like okay go practice piano\nyou know it was like they really didn't\ncare about my grades\nbecause i guess they knew that i they\nkind of knew like\nwhat my grades generally were all the\ntime and they just didn't really care\nabout that\nthey just wanted me to practice piano\nand did you care about your grades\ni i did for the most part but i i\nremember that\nlike i was just one of those students\nwhere i felt like i didn't need to do\ntoo much but just enough in school\nto get like my 80s and then i would just\ngo practice piano but i also remember\nthere was like a point in my life where\ni was just like\ni don't want to practice anything\nanymore so i just started gaming\nthat's that's when i started gaming\nactually\nyeah and do you remember how you felt\nlike tell me more about the feeling of i\ndon't want to practice anymore\nit was just i don't i think i was just\ngoing through like you know\nthe rebellious phase where the my\nparents were like do this\nno kind of thing um\ni just got really sick and tired of\nlistening to them\nso that i just i was just like i'm not\nand i i remember distinctively telling\nthem like the more you tell me the\npractice the more i'm not gonna practice\ni said those exact words to them\nand how did they respond they just got\nmad i mean\nthey used to like you know they they\nnever did any like\nlike physical beating or whatever it was\nall just a lot of yelling\nyou know just a lot of like why don't\nyou do this or like do this\nyou know go do this yeah\nwhat was what was it like to be to hear\nthem yelling at you\ni think after some point i just kind of\nlet it go in one ear and out the other\nuh yeah i\ni don't know when it's when it mattered\nor when it stopped mattering i just\nremembered\ni learned to like just cope with it\nbecause i was just like there's no point\nin\ntalking back i just i'll just\nlet them you know yell and then\nafterwards it's whatever\ni'll just do what i want\ncan i think for a second yeah\nthere's a lot here wendy okay\nmuch of it is very sad\num\nwere your parents proud of you\ni think a lot of the times\nthere were like there they were but i\ndon't think i've ever heard them say it\nuntil like recent years\nyeah that's good took the next question\nout of my mouth which was sort of\nyou know if they were proud how would\nyou have known\ni guess it was just a okay this\ni guess it's really arbitrary but i\nguess it's just a feeling\nit's just maybe sometimes like\noh i know the way they talk about me to\nrelatives\n[Laughter]\nyeah that's that's that's a really you\nknow obvious one\nwhen they you know brag about you or\nwhatever you know that's something that\nthey\nthey could do or would do or to friends\nor whatever yeah\nso i'm about to make a couple of\nstereotypical statements about east\nasian and south asian culture\ni know it applies also to like nigerian\nculture\nyeah can apply to all kinds of cultures\nbut you know i tend to hear this a lot\nfrom people who are\nasian um and it's sort of like\nyou know they'll never tell you they're\nproud of you to your face but they'll\nlet the rest of the world know\nyeah yeah and it's kind of weird because\nlike they not only do they not tell you\nto your face they actually tell you the\nopposite\nyes right they're like you need to do\nmore\nit's not enough you need to practice\nmore\nand then as soon as they're done yelling\nat you to practice more they're on the\nphone with their brother\nback in the home country talking about\nhow awesome you are\nand then as soon as they get off the\nphone they hear you're not practicing\nand they come into your room they're\nlike [ __ ] you\npractice it's kind of weird right\nit's it's interesting because like when\ni look back\non it now i know that they didn't\nmean harm yeah and like\nthey very much love me and support\neverything that i do right now\nand i think my dad especially\nhas always understood\nbecause um another i guess another\ndistinctive moment\nin my life was uh after graduating\nmy bachelor's i i was expected\nby like my professor and my parents to\ngo into my master's degree\nfor piano as well and i just remembered\ntelling them like\ni can't i just can't do this\nit's like i my love for piano\nwas there but i felt like the\ncompetition and like just the amount of\nwork\nthat i had to put in every single day\nwas just too overbearing for me\nso i told him i couldn't do my master's\ndegree anymore and\ni remember my dad telling me that\nhe's like you don't have to i just want\nyou to be happy\nyeah and that broke me because i guess\nmy entire life like i felt like there\nwas a lot of expectation\nbut like he told me it was okay if i\ndidn't do it\nas long as i was happy so that was like\nreally\nrelieving to hear yeah why did you use\nthe word break\num i guess well half of it is like i\nbroke into tears telling them that but\num or\nhearing that uh\ni don't know it's just\nit was against my expectation of what i\nthought they would\nlike say i thought they would say\nsomething completely different\nand so but my dad end up saying\nsomething like\ncompletely out of my imagination yeah\nso what do you think it broke\nmy expectations which were what\nthat they would say like no you should\ndo it\nor like no you should continue to pursue\nthat degree\nor like no you should still like listen\nto us\nyeah so i'm gonna\ndive in there okay so we're gonna put\nsome words to it that may be painful to\nsay but like\nso that was what you were expecting them\nto say\nyeah but what would what were what did\nyou expect them to\nthink about you like what would be their\nidea of you\nbehind those words\num\ni mean i was mostly afraid of what\nof you know being a failure\nand of sorts you know or like um\nwasting or seemingly wasting like\ntime and money because they spent a lot\nof that\non me and and like owning my skills\nyep so for me to not go into it\nlater is\ni feel like it's kind of like\noh just it just feels like i wasted it\nin a way\nyeah what i'm kind of hearing is\num you know that they\ninvested a lot in you and you kind of\nwashed out\nand that you weren't good enough to cut\nit\ni can't say i wasn't good enough it was\njust\ni couldn't bring myself to put that\neffort in there anymore\num yeah i think i think\ni've always been able to rise up to many\noccasions and like\nyou know like jump over a lot of hurdles\nif i really wanted to\nbut i just i was so tired of it\nyeah it was just like really really\nreally really stressful for me\ni'm gonna just sit for a second okay\ni'm gonna just like feel some emotions\nbecause i felt a little bit broken too\num let me ask you something how often do\nyou talk to your parents\na lot actually um i would say like every\ntwo three days\nyeah do you talk to them on your day off\nyes i what do you guys talk about\num it's not like we don't talk too much\nit's mostly just like oh how are you\nguys doing you know like\num you know how well my mom's\num health is not super great like she\nhas a lot of arthritis and it's like\nalways plaguing her so i ask about that\num ask about what my dad's up to\nwhat they do like recreationally because\nthey're both retired\num and then i just yeah just mostly\nabout how they're doing\nand sometimes like small little things\nlike if i need to help with\ntranslations or like doctor visits and\nstuff like that\nyeah okay\nso i have a suggestion for you uh-huh\nthe next time you take a day off and you\nfeel like you're not doing enough\ni think you should talk to your dad\nand tell him i'm taking a day off and i\nfeel like\ni'm not doing enough\nand tell him what your week has been\nlike\nit's funny because my dad tells me to\nrest\na lot like he's literally the person who\ngoes like\nbecause he actually i i showed him my\nstream link this year\nand uh so he started watching my stream\na lot\nhe says like he watches my stream like\nwhenever he has a chance to\neven even if it's like during dinner or\nsomething he just turns it on the laptop\nand there's uh i think it was a couple\nweeks ago i did like a 24 hour stream\nand i didn't tell him i was doing a\n24-hour stream but then\nhe calls me later like a few days later\nhe's just like\nyou know you can't really catch up on\nthe amount of hours you're going to lose\nin sleep you know and but he didn't you\ndidn't i didn't tell him anything about\na 24-hour stream he just knew from like\nlooking at a vaude or something\num so yeah it's funny because he tells\nme to rest a lot he goes like no matter\nhow much money you're making like\nmake sure you sleep make sure you rest\nmake sure you exercise\nyou know and he doesn't tell me to work\nhard\nbecause he knows i do\nhow does it feel to not hear him say\nthat\nfor him to tell you to rest and take\ncare of yourself\ni mean it's it's nice like i\ni really appreciate my dad telling me to\nrest\nand like i i guess it does\ncome up in the back of my mind i i guess\nhe's like\na big factor in why i feel like i should\nrest\ngood so i think um what we've got to do\nwhat does it feel like to have him watch\nyour stream\nwhile he's eating it's it's funny i just\ni think it's i think i just think it's\nlike endearing it's nice\nsounds like he's proud of you\nyeah it's weird because i i told you in\nthe past few years\nit's the first time like he's told me\nthat\nhe's proud of me or that he loves me and\nstuff\nyeah it was weird like hearing him in a\nvoice message say like\ni love you and i was like what the heck\ni was like where did this come from\nyou know but he started saying it in the\nin recent years so you know i set it\nback and like i realized\ni don't say it to my dad either but i\nguess that's just like an asian thing\nyou know like\nyou don't say these things to your\nparents or your kids you know\nyeah you say it to your cats yeah you\nsay it to your cats and your dogs\nhow did he learn how to do that i don't\nknow it's crazy just like one day\num he sent me a voice clip and he was\njust like\nhe was saying some stuff and then at the\nend of it he was like i love you in\nenglish and i was like\nwhat you know i was like oh i love you\ntoo\ndad you know it's like kind of awkward\nbut like nice but\nit was just one of those moments where i\nwas like whoa where did you learn to do\nthat\nyou know yeah\nsounds like you leveled up yeah\nit's crazy my dad is super into like\nlearning tech stuff i feel like it\nhasn't even been that long since i like\nyou know helped him with the computer\nand laptop and now he's like watching\nstreams and stuff and i was like how\nyou're torrenting or like you're like\nstreaming\nstuff and i was like what i was like\nwhat are you doing dad\nhow do you learn this stuff yeah turns\nout that you can't\nteach an old boomer new tricks i know\nso wendy you know i i'm happy to\nyou know if you want to continue\nexploring and stuff like that i think we\ncan certainly do that i\ni feel like um we've kind of\nhit a pretty important point and if it's\nokay with you i'll kind of\nlay that out lay a couple things out and\nwe can talk further if you want to\nso the first thing is i'll double down\non what i said earlier i'm not surprised\nat all that your dad does tell you to\nrest\num it's not i mean there's a reason why\ni told you you know call him\non the days when you're beating yourself\nup for not doing enough\nand tell him how you feel\num and tell him that you know you feel\nlike\nyou're not doing enough or that you\nshould be working harder\nand let him\nlet him so here's the thing so you come\nonto the stream\nand then you say to me i have trouble\ntaking a day off\ni have trouble um you know\nif i don't if i'm not bone tired i feel\nlike it's not enough\nso you come to me and you make it sound\nor\nthere's an assumption that that is\nsomething that you need to fix\nright you're coming to me and you're\nlike hey i want to change this about\nmyself like\nhere's the thing you're you can you fix\nit absolutely\nbut you're not the one who needs to fix\nit\nit's your dad who can fix it so much\nfaster\nwhat you can do in a hundred days he can\ndo in one\nbecause i think you just because if he\ntells you if he gives you permission\nof sorts and he tells you like take it\nyou know take a day off i think it's\ngonna like\nbe worth so much more\nwhat do you think about that\nyeah i can see that yeah\nand so i think it's going to be like\nchallenging for you to\nshow him that side of you because\nthat's the side that you've tried to\nkeep from them right for like so long\nand there are times that out of like\ndesperation or at the end of your rope\nyou're like i can't do my master's\ndegree\nand it's so dangerous because like\nthat's when\nall of the assumptions about your\nparents will come\nto a head and like all of the things\nthat you sort of piece\ntogether like you know what they're\ngonna say because\nthey've said it a thousand times before\nbut then they actually don't say it\nand they kind of confound your\nexpectations and you recognize that your\nparents really do\nlove you so now we get\nuh does that make sense yeah yeah your\ndad is going to teach you how to rest\nbecause he taught you how to not rest\nright your parents taught you that so\nlike this is where they have to teach\nyou the other thing\nso i'm gonna say some things and this is\ngonna paint your parents in sort of a\nbad light i don't think it's\nbut i think it so i think we have to\nunderstand that even the best parents\nare gonna like\nnot be perfect and are going to do\nthings to their kids\nthat their kids then have to like\nstruggle with and grow like that's just\nlife you know my parents are both\nwonderful\nand they also did a number on me in\ndifferent ways that's just how it is\nso here's what i how i understand kind\nof what happened with you i mean i think\nyou know it's interesting because when\nyou grew up like it sounds like your\nparents really emphasized piano\nand as you joked i went to two schools\nbut i think there's a lot there about\nyou know like them really pushing you\nand wanting you to be something\nand sort of creating in your mind a\nstandard that you have to live up to\nand then there was always this sort of\nmessage of it's not enough are you\npracticing you need to practice more\nand you tried every which way to deal\nwith that\nright you tried to practice more and i'm\nnot really hearing that they ever said\ngood job today\nyou practiced enough so even though\nyou kind of practice as much as you can\nit's not enough and then like it hurts\nto give\neverything you've got and not get a\nthumbs up from the people\nthat you're trying to make happy right\nand then it hurts too when you\ndo do a good job and where there may\nhave been things that you're proud of\nand like even if you can't win at piano\nlike at least you got a 90\nand then you come and you show your\nparents and like you're like hey\ni did something and they're like\nwe don't care\nright and so you're kind of like growing\nup you're sort of like\nthere's no way for you to win this\nbattle there's no way for you to get\napproval and so like this thing starts\nto grow within you that like you're not\nenough\nand it's not enough and no matter what\nyou do it's not enough so you try to\nmake them happy it doesn't work you try\nto show them things that you're proud of\nit doesn't work\nand so somewhere along the way you lose\nyour voice\nright like you can't speak to them they\ndon't listen there's no point in\nspeaking there's just kind of putting\nyour head down\nand like you know pounding away like\nthere's doesn't matter what you think or\nwhat you feel or what you say\nthat's a really painful and difficult\nplace to be\nand when kids lose their voice they stop\nlistening\nbecause why do we stop listening to\npeople it's because\nwhat we say doesn't matter you know it's\nkind of weird so then you learned how to\nin one ear and out the other because\nwhat used to happen\nin one ear changes something in here and\nthen you try something new\nthey tell you wendy you need to practice\nmore and then you'd get home from school\nand you'd practice for six hours a day\nand it wouldn't make a difference\nand so like if you started being you\nknow\nthere's a coping mechanism ignoring what\nthey're saying it's because you can't\nwin that game so you're like\nnot gonna play it anymore and then you\nget teenage rebellion and they don't\nreally understand what's going on and\nthey think you're being defiant and\nstuff like that and all that kind of\ngood stuff\num you know there's not really you lose\na voice you don't they don't really show\npride in your work\nyou don't really show pride in your work\nlike it's mind-boggling you call\nyourself pretty okay at piano you had to\npiano conservatory i can guarantee you\nyou're in\nyou know in the general population\nyou're in like one in the\n10 000 people in terms of piano skill\nright like i'm almost 100 sure of that\nstatistic\nare you a professional no but there are\nthousands and tens of thousands of\namateurs out there\nbut like you don't know how to have\npride i i think this has changed\nbut in some ways especially when it\ncomes to piano you have difficulty\nhaving pride in your work\nright because you weren't taught like\nyour parents didn't show you how to have\npride in your work all they showed you\nwas\nhow your work isn't enough and so you\ncarry that with you\nand so now what i'm hearing is that like\nthat's what\nthat was the formula for success that\nyour parents taught you\nthere's a lot of other stuff here like\nthe odd jobs that\nthat they worked the sacrifices they had\nto make the investment that they made in\nyou\nthere's like a whole like thing there\nyeah you know of expectation and not\nbeing good enough and like\nbecause they're it's a lot right like\nthey make they did a lot\nand see living up to that expectation\nevery sacrifice they made every odd job\nthey worked every time that they ran\ninto trouble\nand still paid for you to go to\nconservatory\nraises the bar of expectation and like\nincreases the weight on your shoulders\nand that's weight that you carry with\nyou despite your successful streaming\neven though your\ndad kind of clearly loves you your\nparents clearly love you\nyou know they clearly support you they\nclearly are interested in you\nand it's so strange because it's like\nwell doesn't that fix things and the\nanswer is no\nbecause he loves you today but what you\nreally need to do is like\ngo into the past and recognize that at\neach of those painful moments\nhe loved you then too\neven though you didn't know it and then\nwe get to like the next big swath of\nstuff that's challenging\nand this is tough is that your parents\nmay have made mistakes\nand i don't think that you were willing\nto let them make mistakes i don't think\nthat\nit's possible for you to criticize them\ni don't think it's possible for you\nto say to yourself i needed them to be\nlike proud of me when i was seven\nand they weren't and like i needed to\nhear\nlike it broke you when your dad told you\ni loved you and like he needed to tell\nyou that\na long time ago right and we can\nthere this is where things get really\nreally like tricky\nbecause we can\nnot in a this is tricky but like that's\njust a truth\nright it doesn't have to come with blame\nbut like it has to come with\naccountability\nlike we can forgive him because he\ndidn't know how to do that back then and\nlike he didn't\nthey didn't know better and they learned\nand we can appreciate them\nbut the damage back then was still done\nand like you can't heal that hurt until\nyou\nrecognize that like that damage was done\nso this is where things get really\nreally tricky because like you you're\ngonna feel guilty for sort of blaming\nhim\nbecause he did so much for you because\nthey sacrificed so much for you\nbut like you still have to do that\nbecause then you can really forget like\nyou put everything in context but\nyou can't ignore your experience because\nthat's where the real healing happens\ndoes that make sense yes\nso i think kind of just to sort of wrap\nthings up\num i mean we can still talk more if you\nwant to in questions but like just to\nkind of like\nkind of finish up where we are right now\nyou know i think you carry this not\nbeing good enough with you and you\nlike you slung that on your back like a\nlong time ago\nand and if you kind of think about it\nlike you're clear i think you're\nconfident and you're probably proud of\nwhat you do now like on a relatively\ndaily basis i wouldn't be surprised\nso then that gets confusing because like\nhow can you be proud today\nand still feel like you're not good\nenough today\nand the reason is because that not good\nenough is not from today it's from a\ndecade ago\nright so like when your dad started\ntelling you i love you like that damage\nstops\nand he's like proud of you and you like\nknow that that's why it's so [ __ ]\nconfusing about like\nwhy like i'm confident myself my dad\nloves me my parents are proud of me why\ndo i feel like i'm not good enough\nshouldn't that balance itself out and\nunfortunately that's just not how the\nmind works\nyou have to go kind of back in time and\nlike like even\ntalk this is challenging but like even\ntalk to your parents about\nyou know like when i was growing up like\nlike\nasking hard questions like were you\nproud of me it's gonna be a question\nthat breaks him because like\nhe's gonna feel your pain it's gonna be\na lot of tears and stuff like that\nbut it's like it's like a question that\nyou need to ask and it's an answer that\nyou need to hear\nyeah right it's just hard to\ni gotta get\nokay yeah\num anyway\nyeah yeah i went into this day\ni mean i went into this today and i was\nlike i don't want to cry i don't want to\ncry but i know talking about this is\ngoing to make me\nlike really emotional but yeah\nyeah yeah\nright and that's the thing wendy is like\nyou don't\nthe thing that makes me the most sad\nabout this is that you don't really have\nto\nhang on to that anymore right because\nyour dad does love you guys just need to\nlike\ntalk up you know talk about it and like\nyou need to hear those words\nbecause like there's you know a 12 year\nold little asian kid who's like going to\npiano conservatory like she needs to\nhear those words\nright and like she deserves to hear\nthose words\nbecause like you know like adult wendy\nhigh level wendy endgame wendy like\nshe's a beast\nbut you know that other little girl like\nneeds to hear that\nyeah i never i never thought about\nthe fact that it might be that\nactually or the thought that it might be\nfrom my piano days i guess i g because\nit's so\nit's like when i think about it it's\nlike it's\nkind of like behind me in a sense\nbecause i really haven't engaged in a\nlot of that in a long time\ni play it for fun now which is actually\nnice because you know i just play\nwhatever i want whatever i want\nhowever much i want and that's nice and\nit's like so almost so far put behind me\nthat i never\nthink that that is what's affecting me\nstill\ntoday\nyeah and i think the real question there\nis like on those days when you're\nrelaxing\nhow when was how old were you when you\nfelt that i'm not doing enough and i\nshould be doing\nmore does it smell look\nand tastes like what you felt when you\nwere 7 or 10 or 15 or 16\ni guess it's similar yeah\num i have\ni don't know i think when i was younger\ntoo there's just\nit's different now because there's\nnobody pushing me but myself\nyep but when i was young\nuh or younger there was you know my\nprofessors and\nand my parents but now it's like i know\nthat if i don't push myself nobody's\nreally gonna push me but i realized i\npushed myself a lot\nyeah and and how deep so\nhow do you know when oh god i'm bleeding\noh god\nhow do you know when you've pushed\nyourself enough\ni don't i don't know\nwhen i push myself enough or too much\ni just i just remember waking up for the\npast like\nat least half a year or more where i'm\njust like every day it's like\ni wake up all right eat get ready stream\ngo\nlike that's literally like i i don't\nthink i really have a lot of like\njust spare time to do whatever\ni just i just know that i wake up and i\nshould work like that's me\nyeah so there's also are you familiar\nwith um\nchinese medicine or ayurveda\nchinese medicine in like what sense like\nare you familiar with like any of the\nprinciples of chinese medicine tcm\noh no okay so i think the other\ninteresting thing is that you know\nuh so ayurveda and chinese medicine i\nremember this traditional indian\nmedicine\nand there's a lot of cross-pollination\nin terms of concepts like they kind of\nend up coming up with different terms\nbut the ideas are\npretty similar another just kind of side\nthing you can check out like some of our\nyoutube stuff on this but\num some of that work ethic that you talk\nabout you're very kapha\nso like this is like an element like so\nin in eastern systems of medicine what\nthey do is\nthey use elements to describe people's\nlike personality temperament\nand things like that so gaffas are\npeople who have a lot of like earth\nelement and water elements so they tend\nto be very very resilient\nvery very hard working have large\nstamina pools\nthe tricky thing that they get into is\nthat because they have\nsuch because they're so resilient\nthey tend to tolerate negative\nsituations far\nlonger than they otherwise would\nright so like people who have like\nsmaller hp pools will like sit in\nburning lava for a very small amount of\ntime\nwhereas like people with large hp pools\nare like oh i'm taking a bunch of damage\nevery round but i've got like a thousand\nhit points so it's like not that big of\na deal i'm just gonna hang out here\num and and so you know it's something\nthat people on our stream sometimes we\ntalk about but i think it's like kind of\ninteresting because\nyou know i would imagine that\nfollow-through and perseverance are not\nproblems for you\nyes that's i think that's like\nyou know those you know those tests that\ngo like oh describe your personality in\nlike five words\ni think like i think i've used\nperseverance like a lot\nyup yeah so that's classic kapha right\nso a couple things wendy for you to\nso sometimes it takes longer for me to\nfeel like i understand like where stuff\nis coming from\nfrom someone i think you were just so\nauthentic and open\nthat it like really came together quick\nso i'm talking about a couple other\nrandom things now if that's okay\nokay yeah so the first thing is that\nyou've got to be careful\nabout a couple of things one is that\nthat feeling of not good enough so\nin terms of when how how hard do you\npush yourself\ni would say that you probably push\nyourself to the point of like\na decent amount of feeling not good\nenough\nyeah and i know it's kind of weird like\nlike you know you think the more you\npush yourself\nthe more good about yourself you feel\nbut for you it's the other way around\nand you know because like you know that\nin in order to do a good job\nyou have to feel not good enough\nwhat do you think about that\nyeah i i guess so it's kind of weird\nokay\nyeah but like this is where like when\nyou decide to stop pushing yourself is\nbased on these weird internal feelings\nlike\nlike when is streaming enough it has\nnothing to do with numbers and metrics\nand this is how much i need to\nit has to do with an internal feeling of\nokay i'm [ __ ] exhausted\nwhich means i probably did a decent job\ntoday\nlike i need to keep pushing myself until\nlike i really get into a place where\nlike okay\ni don't feel like i'm good enough i'm\nreally like pushing myself you're like\ncracking the whip\nand then you're like okay oh whoo\nyou know i'm finally like cracking the\nwhip really really hard\nand flagellating myself so like as long\nas i'm beating myself up this much like\ni'm probably going to work good enough\nand it'll end up okay\nso i encourage you to just sort of play\naround with that see if that's true or\nnot\na couple things to think about is\nsometimes these dynamics can pop\nup in like romantic relationships\nso you know if you start to feel like\nyou're not good enough\nin romantic relationships or things like\nthat like you have to be careful because\nlike you said you know you didn't\nrealize it you know went back to your\npiano days because your piano ideas are\nbehind you you just carry them with you\nabsolutely um\nand for kapha's too you have to be\ncareful because a lot of times\nthe relationship problems that kaphas\nfall into is that they\nend up in unhealthy relationships for\nfar too long\nand and especially like there's a\nparticular vulnerability here where like\nyou could feel like you're not good\nenough when actually\nyou're doing fine and the person you're\ndating is probably should be better\nbut you're so used to like not being\ngood enough that\nmaybe some of that stuff can start to\nlike pop up again\ni think that was very like apparent to\nme in the past\nyeah like in past relationships that i\nhad definitely\nand i guess it doesn't help that like\nevery guy that i've dated cheated on me\nso it doesn't help that not good enough\nthing\nbut yeah it was very apparent like i\ni was in a lot of relationships that i\nstayed for too long\nyep yeah so i mean\ni'm happy to hear you say was and i\nthink this is kind of weird but like\nevery time your dad tells you he's proud\nof you\nthat is gonna shrink and as you become\nmore confident in yourself like there\nmay be an echo of this but but you know\nlike every time that happens like\nliterally like talk to your dad on your\nday off\nand tell him you don't feel good enough\nand he's going to tell you that you're\nhe's proud of you\nyou're wonderful he loves you you\ndeserve to rest he's going to say all\nthat stuff to you\nand then like your next relationship is\ngoing to be healthier\num yeah\nquestions thoughts um\nnot at the moment i just i'm just\nthinking about how to have a\nconversation with my dad\nit's just uh it's gonna be it's gonna be\nweird yeah but yeah i think it'll be\ngood\npenny for your thoughts there like what\nwhat are you thinking about how to have\na conversation with your dad\num like just like\ni guess how to tell him\nyeah because because i think like i like\npart of me also like i don't want to\nworry him but i realized like\ni do have to tell him these things\nso i'm gonna try to help you out there a\nlittle bit\nyou don't want to worry him\nhe's already worried\nyeah i guess yeah so this is what i want\nyou to reframe\nyou need to give him the opportunity of\ncomforting his worried daughter\nyou need to give him the oh sorry like\nhis you know the daughter he's worrying\nabout\nyou need to give him the opportunity to\nlike make it better\nthat's what you really owe him\nyeah when he sees you\nstreaming for 24 hours and he's like you\nshould rest like he's worried about you\nit's already happening\nyeah it's true do you need help i mean\ndo you are you\nconfident that you can come up with like\nlanguage for like talking to him\ni don't know it's gonna be a little\nweird because i\ni grew up speaking like cantonese to my\nparents but then with my dad he's like\nmore fluent in english so i end up\nspeaking like this weird\nlike mixture of stuff with him but he\nkind of understands like my moon runes\nwhen i like mix both languages together\nat random parts of the sentence\nso i'm just wondering like in my mind\nlike how i'm gonna piece together\nuh like if i'm gonna say it in like\ncantonese or am i gonna say it in a\nlittle bit of english or like\nhow it's gonna work out but yeah i think\nit'll be okay yeah\nyeah it sounds like he listens to you\nnow\nyeah i mean i think like both my parents\nyou know listen to me but it's just i\nthink i've always\num bonded with my dad a little bit more\ni mean i love both of them a lot and i\nthink in recent years i've\ncome to talk to my mom a lot more um\nit's because my mom did a lot more of\nthe yelling and my dad did less of\nit uh yeah he was he was always more\nlike chill and quiet\nso i i guess i always like i also played\na lot more games with my dad growing up\ntoo i didn't ever play any games with my\nmom\nwhat kind of games oh we played like i\ndon't know like\ntetris and like chess and you know board\ngames and stuff together\nand we would watch tv shows together\nlike kids tv shows like arthur and\nmagic school bus and stuff together you\nknow like my dad loved pingu\nyou know it's just like it's just one of\nthose he oh\npiku is like this this uh penguin it's a\nstop-motion\npenguin animation that was like really\npopular\nin mild in my childhood yeah it's\ninteresting you know\ni think dads have special relationships\nwith their daughters i'm sure they have\nspecial relationships with their sons\ntoo but\ni have two daughters and and so i you\nknow it's different i'm different with\nthem\nthan my wife is right um\nyeah i'm kind of at a loss as to what to\ntalk about now\num yeah\nfor me it was just mostly trying to find\nout like\ni guess why i felt so bad when i took my\ndays off\nyeah yeah um\ni i guess the other thing is i guess it\nmight be related it's just constantly\nchasing for more or that\nbut that might just relate to you know\nnot feeling like it's not enough\nso they kind of come hand in hand i\nthink\nyeah and that yeah and that might be in\nterms of like numbers too you know like\nfor streaming or like anything\nyeah so i i think that that is actually\na little bit more complicated so i think\ncertainly they're related\nbut i think a lot of that has to do with\njust being a streamer in general\nyeah um and just you know there's like\nthis\nthere's a effect of platforms\non our psychology um and\nand some of that of like always needing\nto grow in sort of the sentiment of like\nif i'm not growing i'm dying you know\nand you can't take a break because like\nyou know it's like steady content and\nand like this is like it's not so i do\nwonder about\ngod i should really think about this now\ni wonder if we should do a study about\nthis but like there's so many\nstreamers that we've talked to that were\nlike you know had\nparents that were like fundamentally\nunsatisfied\nor like weren't able to display pride or\nsatisfaction\nwith their kids yeah and\nand just i i it never crossed my mind\nuntil now that like\ni wonder if that's actually part of what\nmakes you guys successful\nbecause you guys do you know like\nlike that feeling of not being good\nenough like pushes you to you\nit'd be an interesting sort of like\npersonality analysis like study but\num i think some of that stuff is just\nyou know it's just how what social media\nand stuff like that does to us\nso it's like i mean if you want to\nyou know hear me be professor andy i can\nlike talk more about\nyou know like go into a quick\nexplanation of how that works but my\nexperience is basically that\nwe have like personal psychological\nstuff that then\nmeets the influence of the internet\nand that the influence like we've always\nhad the psychological stuff but now we\nhave the internet\nwhich sort of like amplifies or even\nlike preys\non some of our vulnerabilities that like\neveryone has always had\nand then we end up with something that\nwe haven't ended up with before\nwhich is like the psychological stuff\nlike you know everyone's had i mean\nasian parents have existed since the\ndawn of time\nand then you take asian parents and then\nyou throw in twitch and then\nyou're actually rare wendy because i you\nknow i don't i don't know how many\nusually it's like through therapy and a\nlot of effort on the kids parts to like\nget their parents to tell them\ni love you like they have to be taught\nlike i don't know like your dad\nyeah i don't know my i don't know but my\nparents\nevolved yeah like pokemon\nbut like they literally but i i don't\nknow i guess my parents are\nlike or my yeah my dad is like\nespecially woke\nit's really weird because like he tells\nme all these things that he thinks about\nand then he he kind of like realized and\nthen he'll tell me these things\nsometimes and i'll be like\nit's weird hearing it from him because\nyeah because it's just like this is very\nagainst like\ntraditional asian culture you know and\nso i always call my parents like\nhippies because like they're so much\nmore like relaxed or more like\nunderstanding than a lot of parents that\ni've seen\nor like have heard about and so\nevery time i just think about my dad\nit's like what the heck is going on you\nknow\nyeah it's really good to see too and\nit's really nice\nso yeah yeah i i think um\nyou know there is a there is a asian dad\npokemon\nwho starts out as security guard form\nand then goes into convenience store\nowner form\nand then winds up his woke asian dad in\ntouch with his face\nasian dad which is which is the which is\nthe charizard\nvocation dad uses i love you oh god\nwendy begins to cry\nvery effective yeah it's very effective\noh god\nyeah oh that's really funny\n[Music]\nyeah i it's it's weird because i feel\nlike there's i guess there's two types\nof people right like there's the people\nwho\nthey tell themselves like oh they're not\ngood enough and then they don't do\nanything\nbecause it's like crippling and then\nthere's just i guess there's\npeople like me who if i say like i'm not\ngood enough well\ni should do more like i need to do\ninstead of like just not do anything\nthat's a really cool observation\nwhat do you think separates those two\npeople why why do you think one is\ni\ni don't know like why someone becomes\none or the other\num and i and i found like i talk to some\nof my friends\nyou know some of them are very much like\ni feel like crap\nnow i'm not gonna do anything and then\nfor me it's like i really wish i could\ngive them some of my energy and be like\ni think you'll feel better if you do\nsomething\nrather than not doing anything at all\nand\nyeah i don't know what makes us do one\nor the other\ni don't know if you have any insight on\nthat i've never thought about it like\nthat but i i love\nwhere you're going with this i wonder if\nit's the presence\nof someone that you want to do it for\nlike a motivation yeah like like you\nwant to make your parents proud\nwhich no matter how hard you try never\nhappens\nwhich i know sounds bleak yeah and and\nthen because i i have talked to some\npeople who\nyou know don't feel good enough but i i\ndon't think they ever\ni mean their parents were really more\num tend to be more toxic so it's like\nlike you know their parents would tell\nthem you're not good enough like\nto their face and it's sort of like like\nat least in your case\nit's almost like some people have a\nparent like a parent that sort of like\nyou know holds up a standard that they\npush their kid to meet\nand it's so impossible that you never\nmeet it but they still\nhold you to that standard and push you\ntowards it\nwhereas some parents just tell their\nkids that they're not good enough and\nthey don't expect\nmaybe it's the expectation of a parent\nthat's different\nlike like expectations yeah like they\nexpect you to do it\nand you can be disappointing to them\nabsolutely but at least they expect it\nof you\nand some parents just you know think\ntheir kid isn't good enough and don't\nexpect anything out of them\nand and then that's actually why they\ndon't do anything because\nonce you don't believe you're capable of\nanything then\nthere's no point trying whereas like\nthere's still this idea that you have\nthat like\nif you work hard enough you'll get there\none day\nbut some people believe that they're\njust not capable so you know when they\ntalk about motivation like so i see this\na lot where a lot of motivation\nor problems with motivation they say i\nlack motivation is really hopelessness\nunderneath because if you're never gonna\nsucceed\nthere's no point in trying and so you\nhave to tackle that\nyou know lack of expectation of\ncapability of yourself\nmaybe that's it i don't know it's a\ngreat observation on your part though\nsounds yeah sounds like that might be it\ntoo\n[Music]\nit's yeah\nvery eye-opening yeah i don't really\ni don't really talk about this stuff\nmuch\num no one does yeah\nit's a lot of like diving into why\nwhy and why yep oh yeah and you don't\nalways know why\nyeah yeah so i think that's where\num you know a big part of like\nmy journey was just asking myself why\nwhy and why\nand and this is where i spent some time\nsort of training to become a monk\nand and they that's what we do\nlike when you train like you know you\nmeditate and then like like you\nask yourself like why do i have a desire\nfor this thing\nwhy do i have a desire for this thing at\nthis moment why am i feeling bad today\nlike so\nit's sort of like an internal\nexploration\nyou know you're mapping out the inner\nworld instead of like mapping\nout the outer world\nwhich it sounds like your dad is pretty\ngood at\na few months ago he told me he's like\nhe's like ah when you get older you stop\ncaring about a lot of stuff\nand i was like oh he's just like yo\nyou'll understand when you get here\nand i mean he's just i don't like he's\nold like he's older\nhe's not like a grandpa yet i guess but\ni mean he's like 65\nso you know like 66 retirement age um\nbut he's like you really stop caring\nabout a lot of stuff\nwhen you get to my age she's like all\nthose things that you're feeling right\nnow\nlike you probably won't feel a lot of it\nin 40 years or 30 years and\nand my woke asian dad yeah yeah\n[Laughter]\nyeah i i'm really loving location\nyeah it sounds like your dad is is\ndeveloping detachment or vairagya\nin sanskrit which is like distance\nbetween\nfeelings and things in the world and\nlike how\nyou know how much it pisses you off\nso one of the one of the other qualities\nof\nthe final form of the asian bat the\nfinal four\nyeah i think i'm still very angry at\nrandom things\ndefinitely not detached at all yeah yeah\nso you\nso as your dad said dad uses skill\nwise words and and you know he says\nhe'll get there one day\nyeah oh it's so funny\nyeah wendy like i said i you know\nusually this takes longer but\ni think you've really opened up and\nseemed simple today or clear to me yeah\ni\ni don't i'm not uh\nlike i'm super okay with talking about\nfeelings\nit's just i don't like always talk about\nthem but i mean like i i'm\nreally open about talking about feelings\nso it's like if anybody asks me anything\nyou know it's like i'll\njust say it as it is yeah\ni think it's it's great i think it's you\nknow that's a lot of people\ntend to you know be open\nto answering but we all feel\nuncomfortable about\nvolunteering yeah\nright because it's like it's kind of\nweird because like people are open books\nbut like you've gotta crack the cover\nyou know they're willing to be open and\ntransparent but someone has to express\ninterest\nand and i think part of the tricky thing\nis that nowadays like it's\nyou know it's polite to not inquire\nand then when we don't ask like if we\nsee someone crying we don't like\ngo over to them and ask like what's\nwrong\nyou know because we like want to respect\ntheir privacy but then they feel\nisolated it's kind of like a we get\nstuck between like a rock\nand a hard place i guess i\ni really want or i i i'm actually\nusually the person that inquires\nlike if i see any\nsigns of someone being sad i'll like\ni'll\nmessage them be like are you okay that's\nreally wonderful\nif they need an ear or like yeah stuff\nlike that\ni think that makes the world a better\nplace\nyeah i definitely you know wish\neverybody can be kind\nto one another\nyeah how's your brother doing\noh ah i guess he's good\ni mean we don't really talk much and i\nwish we talked more\nbut he's he's good he's in china\nand uh he does like teaching and stuff\nuh english teaching\num but i haven't seen him in years\nso what's that like\num\ni mean it sucks\nuh the thing is like my brother and i\nhave a huge age gap\nand it's only my brother and i like my\nparents only have two kids\num like he's 10 years older than me\nexactly 10 years\nso growing up it was like of a pretty\ncrazy dynamic because it was like\ni was four he was 14 you know um\ni was 10 he was 20. you know he was\nalready like practically gone by the\ntime i was in my teenage years\nbecause he had to go to college and then\ngo to like he did some like\ntraining like student teacher training\nin like china and stuff and\nhe always really liked teaching there um\nso he did a lot of traveling i didn't\nsee him for a long time i remember like\nhim coming back after a trip and he was\nlike whoa you grew a lot\nyou know and i was like yep i did so\ndoes he have uh you said your\nyour parents your parents don't have\ngrandparents so i'm assuming he doesn't\nhave\nchildren and neither do i yes\nneither of us have children yeah and and\nso he's been in\nchina what sounds like years so he's\nlike settled there\nyes yeah he's definitely settled there\num\nhe wanted to visit in recent years but\nthen covet and\nwhatnot so yeah he didn't end up coming\nback\nand then i never really go there either\nso we just haven't seen each other in a\nwhile\nbesides like happy birthday\nmerry christmas and happy new years you\nknow like through text messages we don't\nreally talk too much yeah\nmaybe someone else to reach out to on\nyour off days\nyeah yeah\nthe time zone difference is a little\nweird but\nmaybe you can trick yourself into\nthinking you're being productive by\nreaching out to your brother yeah\nsomebody i could definitely reach out to\nso wendy um sometimes on stream we teach\nmeditation\nare you interested in learning that yeah\ni'm down let me think\nhave you had any experience with\nmeditation\nuh i've followed your stream a little\nbit here and there\nbut that's that's that's about it\nyeah i think i've done a breathing one\nbefore a long time ago in like\nchoir i don't know my choir instructor\nwas like\nbreathe in for this many counts and\nbreathe out for this many counts\nokay close your eyes and stuff yeah\ni'm trying to think about whether we\nshould do\na meditation around sound or a\nmeditation around\nbreath\nor we can do both because you are\nmusically oriented\num\nokay i've got one for you okay\nso i'm going to give you um\ni'm going to give you kind of an uh task\nof sorts\noh hold on let me think about this\nhow we can do this\ngive me just a second okay\nokay this is going to sound kind of\nweird okay so what i want you to do\nis um i'm going to put forth a\nhypothesis\nand i want you to test it okay okay\nso the hypothesis is that the letter\nu is at the end of any sound that you\ncan make\nokay okay so if we think about like like\nwhat what sound does the letter b make\nb or b sorry yeah right\nso so ba right so there's something\nyeah i was like what does b uh b okay so\nso but then what i want you to also do\nis is listen to the sound\nb and see if you can find an\nuh at the end of that so close your eyes\nand you can try saying it b\nb and and just really pay attention to\nthe end of it\nb okay\npay attention to the e sound so after\nthe e\nthere's another sound even when you say\nb\nb\ni don't get it it's because it like\nthat's okay\nit's just it's it's a poorly explained\ntechnique um okay let me let me let's\ntry something else\nlet me think let me think let me think\nokay i've got another technique for us\nto try okay\nokay so um this is gonna be sort of like\na rotating\nuh it's gonna be like a rotating\nawareness technique so what i want you\nto do\nis we're going to take deep breaths and\nwhat i want you to do is\nkind of imagine that the breath is going\nin through your nose\nup to the top of your head and as you\ninhale goes all the way down\nthe back of your spine and as you exhale\nso as you hit the\nyou know the tailbone as you exhale\nthe breath kind of comes via the pubis\nand then\nover the navel through the chest and\nthen out the nose\nokay so as we inhale we're going to\nrotate our attention\ni'm giving you hard techniques i don't\nknow why i should probably be getting\nintroductory stuff but\nyou know you're such a hard worker and\ntalented and all that good stuff\nso breathe in and then kind of follow it\nup and then around the back of your\nspine\nand as you finish your breath you should\nbe at your tailbone and as you exhale\nover the pubis through the navel\nthrough the heart through the base of\nthe throat\nand then oh actually i guess this is a\nlittle bit complicated\nalso back up here and then out the nose\nokay okay and so along the back what you\nwant to do is\nyou know start here go to the top of\nyour head\nsort of the the you know the base of\nyour throat so like the part of your\nspine that is opposite your throat\nthe part of your spine that is behind\nyour heart the part of your spine that\nis\nopposite your navel your tailbone\nand then up the front does that make\nsense yes okay so\nsit up straight close your eyes\nand i'll i'll run you through the\nbreaths\nat the beginning so i'm gonna do three\nrounds while i'll walk you through them\nand then you can you're gonna do five\nmore on your own okay\nokay so go ahead and exhale to begin\nwith\nand then through your nose breathe in\nslowly slowly slowly it goes up to the\ntop of\nyour head along the back of your throat\ndown past your heart down past your\nnavel\nand into your tailbone and as you exhale\nacross the pubis over the navel\nthrough the heart base of your throat\nup to your eyebrows and then out your\nnose\nand now we're gonna go again okay eyes\nclosed\nbreathe in up to the crown of your head\nback of your throat behind your heart\nbehind your navel bottom of the tailbone\nand then exhale\npubis navel front of your heart\nbase of your throat up to your eyebrows\nand out and now continue at your own\npace\nand just as you breathe in let your\nattention rotate\nin that circuit we're going to do we're\ngoing to practice for about 60 seconds\nokay\nc\nfor\nwhat\nno i just i don't have a good time of 60\nseconds i was like did i\nbreathe too long or did i breathe too\nshort\nyou did fine i i should have been a\nlittle bit more clear i think\nsomething about maybe my teaching styles\noff today no\nno no no it's fine what was what was\nthat practice like\nrelaxing it was like\nyeah it was very relaxing and it was\nfunny because i was trying to\nfollow my air through my body and it\nand then when i went back up to like\nhere and then down through my nose it\nlike kind of tickled\na little bit because i was it's just\nyeah\ngood so kind of feeling the air\nfantastic right so the goal of\nmeditation is to bring your attention to\nthe present\num and then sort of just as if you're\nsitting with an experience that's\nperfectly fine\nlet me ask you i know this could be hard\nto understand having done it so little\nbut did you feel like sometimes your\nbreath or attention would stall at a\nparticular place in your body\nyes because i i don't know for some\nreason i was like having a mental\nor i was like trying to follow and i was\nlike wait did i go to that part\ngo back so i was like trying to like\nyeah when you were telling me where to\nlike\nuh where my air travels it was like\nreally smooth but when i did it on my\nown it was not as smooth yeah and do you\nknow if there was a particular place\nthat you would stumble around\num yeah i guess just like the\nend of my breathing so around like the\nspine area\nlike of the back the the bottom of your\nspine yeah the bottom\nokay and then was there uh was the\nexhalation pretty smooth or would that\nalso\nkind of like where you like you know\nimagine you're driving a manual and it\nkind of like\ndoesn't start quite right so did you\nlike stall at the bottom\non your way out or was it pretty smooth\non the way out\nuh i think it stalled because i was\nlike like again i was thinking about\nwhich part it was traveling through\num but generally it's like pretty smooth\nyeah\nokay generally but it seems like you get\nkind of stuck around the bottom\nyeah yeah okay\nokay yeah keep doing it um\nnot now but just in general okay so so i\ni think\nyou know you can try this technique out\ni would say do it for three to five\nminutes a day\nideally every day but i think you can\nstart with like\nthree days a week\nyou know i think eventually what you\nwant to do so the science on meditation\nsuggests that if you can practice\n20 minutes a day for three days a week\nthat's the minimum required to really\nlike literally rewire your brain\nso like stress indicators and things\nlike that will improve\num but if you know if you can do 20\nminutes a day five days a week that's\ntotally fine\nyou don't have to do this practice for\n20 minutes\nso you you can do this for three to five\nyou know check out our other youtube\nvideos or\nyou know reach out to me at some point\nif you have more questions about\nmeditation or things like that\num yeah and then oh\nsorry do you have a recommendation on\nwhen you should do them or\nlike is it like when you wake up like\nbefore you sleep so meditation is the\nis the most fruitful at dawn and dusk\noh okay so i don't know if you're up at\ndawn\nbut if you're in canada i'm definitely\nup\nyeah because you're up late or up early\nyeah off late\nokay i haven't slept yet uh-huh so i i\nwould say you know when dawn rolls\naround\nthen um you know you'll\nthat's when it's the most fruitful the\nother thing that's a little bit tricky i\ndon't know if you noticed but\none of your nostrils is going to be more\nclosed than the other\ncan you tell which one\nah this one's more open this one's my\nright\nthe moment of dawn or dusk both of them\nwill open up\nand it's [ __ ] weird i know so\nif you can do that practice during the\nperiod of time\nwhere they're both open then it'll be\nthe most fruitful\nsorcery yes\nokay okay i'll try it i'll try it yeah\njust try it\nyeah you'll be it's one of the weirdest\n[ __ ] things in the universe okay\ni don't even quite understand it but\nthere's something about being in rhythm\nwith the universe\ni don't know how any of that [ __ ] works\nit's just weird it used to be my alarm\nclock\nit's like oh okay but anyway\num any other questions cool um\nno i think i'm good so one last thing\nwendy you know it may be worthwhile for\nyou to see a therapist i don't know if\nyou ever have\nbut if you wanna like if you find that\nthis is really a problem like not a bad\nidea to work with someone\nyou can also work with i'm not really\nseeing a huge need for\num you know therapy i'm not hearing\nanything that i think is clinically\nconcerning\nyou know i don't diagnose people over\nthe internet so you know that being said\nbut\num you know you can certainly work on\nthe stuff if you feel like you do want\nsomeone to talk to you can also\nuh sign up for our creator coaching\nprogram which\nthankfully twitch is sponsoring so\ntwitch has decided i'm\nare you a partner on yes okay so if your\npartner\nit's available to you and and coaches\ncan kind of help you work through some\nof the stuff\na little bit more two other things to\nkind of think about\nokay yeah thank you\nthank you for coming on and you know\nbeing so\nauthentic and open it was like\nand and also insightful because\nsomething about i don't know it was just\neasy today like like something oh that's\ni'm glad\ni didn't want to be a difficult\nguest i i mean i don't know that anyone\nwell actually that's not true some\npeople actually\nbut you know that's not their problem\nthat's my problem\nand but you certainly worked\nyou're pleasant and delightful and good\nluck to you you know\ni hope you do well and seriously like\ntell your dad how you feel\nand and let him do let him\ngive him the opportunity to like make\nyou feel better because that's\nyou know you owe that to him and you can\nmake him so happy\nspeaking as a father there's nothing\nthat makes me happier than making my\ndaughter feel better when she's hurting\nlike that's like what i exist for\nat this point right so give him that\nopportunity\nand don't worry about burdening him\nbecause he knows\ni can see you're going to cry for my dad\nspeaking from a dad's point of view\nyeah we know all right\nyeah and now you can have a go have a\ngood cry in private\nall right take care and thanks a lot so\nmuch you too\nbye\nah yes let us let us raid
