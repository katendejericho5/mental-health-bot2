oak\nbut a lot of people prefer to call me dr\nk you can call me whatever you would\nlike\nokay um and so tell me thank you for\nvery much for coming on\nthank you for having me i see you are\nvery vibrant still\nand colorful okay i used to not be i\nliterally got my hair dyed not even two\ndays ago\num yeah it looks great thank you what\nwhat prompted getting the hair dyed\num my i always hear my mom say like oh\nmy god like i wish i\ncould have pink hair of blue hair but\ni'm too old and a lot of my friends have\ncolored hair and i was like\ni'm just i'm just gonna do it i i'm i\nused to be really attached to my hair\nso it's kind of empowering to just be\nlike yeah i'm gonna bleach the entirety\nof my head and make it pink\nwhat's empowering about that help me\nunderstand that\ni think um\na lot of my life has been caring about\nthe perception\nof myself to others and while i do care\nuh i don't want that to hold me back\nfrom expressing myself and so\nthis was like very different than i\nthink even my last yourself would expect\nfrom me\nwhat was your last year of self it had\nwould have expected from you\ni think my last yourself and all the\nyears prior\nespecially with streaming uh has cared a\nlot about\nhow my first impression is\nlike when people make that first\njudgment of you\nor even see you on a thumbnail while\nthey're scrolling twitch\nlike i wanted to be perceived in a\ncertain way\ni see um in order to yeah how did that\nchange\noh i got so sick and tired of it i was\njust like oh like i'm not\nmyself i don't fee like i feel like i'm\nconstantly trying to appeal to something\nthat is not what i want\num yeah so it was kind of more just like\nlike rebellion kind of thing oh wow okay\nso it sounds like you've discovered\nyourself\nwell maybe maybe we're like halfway\nthere okay\nuh so cool that's um sorry for diving\nright in i i don't know if this is yeah\ni don't mind at all is there i was just\ncurious about you know the appearance\nbecause it happened two days ago and it\nseems like\nyeah it's like significant for you\nthat you did this thing um\ndefinitely is i feel i feel really happy\nthough like i'm giddy about it\nso yeah so you're you're like expressing\nyourself\nand it's is there something in\nparticular that you want to talk about\ntoday or\nanything that maybe i could help you\nwith when\ni was asked that question we had listed\noff\nthe feeling just of being a girl as a\nstreamer and how\nyou're kind of pushing against the grain\nand then\nuh how intrusive thoughts make me feel\nkind of like inherently terrible\num they have a way of doing that\nand i think i struggle with\ntrust friendships\nokay and that would be all that i can\nthink of right now\nthat's plenty he thinks jody\nwhat do you want to start with so we've\ngot intrusive thoughts\nuh being a female on twitch um\nand uh trusts and friendships\nwhat feels um any of them\nfeel equally as okay so yeah so let me\njust\nmaybe i can just ask you a little bit\nabout yourself and kind of lay like a\nfoundation for like maybe 10 or 15\nminutes and then we can kind of see\nwhere that takes us\ni suddenly find myself feeling like\nreally excited to like dig into this\nstuff with you and i hope we can really\nlearn something together\num and i'm optimistic that we can it's\nweird i'm feeling\nunusual maybe it's just because you're\nso energetic i'm like oh\ni'm like nervous am so nervous i feel\nlike i'm jittering\nso i thought you know it's kind of\nexciting i mean i'm excited i am but i'm\nalso extremely nervous and try i think\ni'm trying to cope with that nervousness\nby\nbeing extra wobbly\noh no i wonder if now i will feel\nanxious\nand bubbly okay no no no i'm not feeling\ni'm excited\ni'm i'm just as equally excited okay\nlet's let's ask you so can you tell me a\nlittle bit about\nwhat growing up was like for you oh\num\ngrowing up\ni think i was a really happy kid like i\ni looked\nback on my childhood with fondness i've\nthere was also some traumatic\nexperiences and such but everything\nwho doesn't go through that and then um\ni mean my family is really supportive my\nparents are super supportive of what i\ndo i mean my hair is pink and they still\nlove me and it's great and they're like\noh my god i love it\nand uh i've gamed my whole life\nmy my parents gamed actually like i\nremember\njust like waking up in the middle of\nnight and hearing them play halo\non like legendary campaign until 2am um\nso they're like very uh\nunderstanding and with the times i would\nsay\nwow interesting so yeah you know\nballpark answers are fine how old are\nyour parents i'm\noh yeah yeah my dad is\n57\nand i want to say my mom is 46.\nso how did they learn how to use a\ncontroller\ni have no idea um it's very unusual\nmy i'm sure that my brother\ninfluenced my parents gaming so my\nbrother was super into gaming as well\ngrowing up\nmore even than me and then i'm sure that\nthrough my brother's interest in gaming\nthat my parents were like oh well now we\nhave this console let's give it a try\num so that would have been around the\ntime it would be like\nyeah around 7 20 20 something years ago\nbecause i'm 23.\nso okay took the next question out of my\nmouth and how old is your brother it\nsounds like he's older\nyeah he's 20 25\n6. okay i should know that i should\ndefinitely know that\nno no we're ballparking you do know that\nright we're just ballparking for privacy\nyeah and you have one brother\nyeah any other siblings no just one\nbrother can you tell me a little bit\nabout him\num he is\nopposite of me okay in many ways\ni think that i don't know what that\nmeans though because i don't know you\nright he is\na lot of the things that i saw growing\nup that i didn't like was actually in my\nbrother\nand so i tried to go the opposite way\num he i don't consider him a very\nconsiderate individual i think he's very\nin his head about himself\nand uh has a hard time maybe seeing\noutside of his situation\nand so that has definitely affected my\nlife\nuh because obviously i grew up with him\nand he he didn't move out to i moved out\nreally\nso yeah spent a lot of time with him\nshared a bathroom with\nhim and such he's\nbut he's very like\ni don't really have anything good to say\num\nwell it sounds like he's one of us\nyeah and i say that with love well yeah\nso i mean i think a lot of times you\nknow siblings can\ndislike things about their other\nsiblings and it takes some time to\nreally get to know your sibling\nyou know in a way that is like it's like\na process\nit's like a relationship that develops\nover time and i wouldn't be surprised if\nyou guys felt quite differently\nyou know five years from now 10 years\nfrom now um\nbut i'm i'm almost hearing that maybe\nthere were times when you were growing\nup that like\nmaybe you could have really used his\nsupport a little bit but\nmaybe he was a little bit caught up in\nhimself and maybe wasn't quite as\navailable\nto you i think that of course they have\nthe same parents so i think that a lot\nof the things that we\nfelt or were going through as a result\nof having the same parents\nuh we could have talked about and i feel\nlike could have definitely relied on\neach other but\nyeah i not sure\nwe just have never connected and have\nalways had issues\nor not okay i like just not gotten along\ni would say\nhmm what does that look like\num well when i used to live with him and\nmy parents\nit was a lot of like fighting\nin a sense where i'm like hi can you do\nthis and he'll be like\nuh no like that why would i do that and\ni'd be like\nwell because like this bothers me he's\nlike eh\nyeah and i'm like okay\nso that's like really um\nfrustrating so that was a lot of like\njust\nfighting and then it came to a point\nwhere i stopped caring i was like okay\nyeah we're just never gonna have that\nrelationship and you're just so\ndrastically different from me\nand then yeah and then i moved out and\nwe\ndon't talk like he'll text me sometimes\ni'll like say happy birthday\nwe don't really talk past that\nhow do you feel about that i have a lot\nof resentment towards him\nuh not because of me like i don't really\ncare how he's affected me\nbecause he i don't feel like he's a\nreally like thing on my life but\num i'm like upset with how he affects my\nparents\nbecause yeah he's just\num i think like a kind of a withdrawal\nsometimes\nbut um yeah\nso um jody i'm just noticing like\ni don't want this to turn into a you\nknow\nbrother bashing session and it crosses\nmy mind that this is public so i\nwouldn't want\nus to talk about anything that um would\nreflect poorly on him\nor make him feel embarrassed or called\nout or anything like that\nwe may have already crossed that bridge\nbut um\nthe reason i'm asking i just wanna\nbecause i think we've got kind of an\ninteresting\nfork in the road here where this feels\nimportant to me\num it feels like it's actually like a\nsignificant part of your life like i\nknow you've learned how to live with it\nand sort of like wall it off and it's\nlike\nyou know we text each other on birthdays\nyou know\num it's like that steam friend that you\nyou know you've got on your steam\nfriends list that like you used to play\ngames with a few years ago and then they\nchanged their names a couple times and\nthey changed their icon a couple times\nyou don't even know who they are anymore\nyou don't know what games you guys used\nto play\nit's just the perfect it's just it's\njust like it's just on your friends list\nright you're like i don't even know who\nthat person is but like\ni don't know well continuing i will say\nlike i love my brother\nand i do see the good things in him it's\njust that my i can\nunderstand how great my brother is if i\nwasn't his sibling\ni think because i am his sibling i get\nto see a different side of him and i\nand understand just a little bit more so\nlike\ni if for anyone listening i do love my\nbrother my brother is a great guy like\nit's just that i get to see totally\njust a different side of him that i\nthink everybody has it's just that\nyeah my brother yeah so i think that's\nwhere like you know if you want to talk\nabout it i think it's still useful to do\nso i think we should just understand\nthat\nthe point of exploring these things is\nto\nreally try to improve on them and i'm\nsure that you know when it comes to\nbrothers and\nand sisters that you know text each\nother occasionally i'm sure you had your\nfair share\nin contributing to that relationship you\nknow\ni mean it's not like a one-way well\nsometimes sometimes it is but\nyou know usually it's like it goes both\nways um\nso you know i am i i do find myself\ncurious but i also want to kind of\nacknowledge that\nit could make him look bad and and make\nsure that you're kind of comfortable\nwith me continuing to ask questions\nlike i'm really curious when you said i\nkind of you have some resentment built\nup for some of the\nhis relationship with your parents so\ni'm curious about that\nyeah um i like\nmy parents are i think fine with my\nbrother\ni just see what my brother does and i'm\nlike you\ncould definitely sorry my cat is eating\nmy mouth\num you could definitely yeah\nuh just be a little bit more considerate\nand\nit would make their lives a little bit\neasier sure it's just\nthat he what is that\nwhat is the what do you what do you ask\nhim to do or what do you wish he did\ndifferently\nso i haven't been home so i don't know\nexactly what his like behavior is like\nright now\nbut a lot of uh what\ni have seen in him and know that he does\nis just like\ndoesn't really pick up after himself\ndoesn't really\nhelp out around the house um\nand is like i said very like\none track minded and maybe he tunnels\non like his own life um\nplays a lot of video games but he works\nreally long hours\nso i can understand that he like went\nthrough a really bad breakup and moved\nback into my\nparents house and like adopted a dog\nbut i guess didn't really take care of\nthe dog too well like my parents did a\nlot of it\num so yeah\nsounds like he works really hard maybe\nhad some stuff going on that wasn't too\ngreat\nbut also sounds like one of us in the\nsense that he doesn't\nplay pick up after himself is kind of\nlost in game sometimes and\nis maybe a little bit infantilized by\nyour mom and dad\nyes um so there's a really interesting\ndiagnostic question about whether he's\none of us or whether he's not one of us\ndoes he do his own laundry\ni want to say yes there may be hope for\nhim\n[Laughter]\nyou know doing your own laundry is a big\nbig part of it\num my cat is just absolutely destroying\nmy room right now\ni see that yes sir go ahead um\nmaybe your cat is jealous that we're\ntalking about your brother\nuh so can you tell me a little bit about\nyour parents\nyeah um my mom is my rock i love her to\ndeath\nshe is absolutely the woman that i've\naspired to be\num she's just always had like given me\nthat space to be vulnerable and talk\nabout things\nand really given me the space to express\nmyself in any way that i want\nlike truly wishes for my happiness and i\nfeel that from her my dad\nmy dad is an interesting man um\nhe's rather angry uh we actually\nyou know when you finally like get to\ntalk to your parents about all the\nthings that you've like been meaning to\nlike you you know you make your own\npaycheck so you don't like hold anything\nback my dad and i just actually had that\nconversation\num maybe like two weeks ago which was\npretty\nbig for me because i think that was\nweighing\non me for a while um\nbut he's a little angry and\ni definitely see some of him in me and i\nhate that because i didn't really like\nhim growing up\nand what um\nwhat part of what part of him do you see\nin yourself that you dislike\nso i call them my sneezes like behind\nclosed doors\num a lot of the times i'll like get\nangry at stuff\nand i can't hold it in because it's like\nwhat i grew up with\nlike holding and angry emotions were not\na thing that\nhappened in my family with my dad uh and\nso i see that\nin me and it's mine's definitely not as\nbad as my dad's but\nbecause it's so similar in the sense i\nlike get really angry you can't\nwhatever and then i like sneeze and then\nit's gone\nso i don't really like those grudges\nit's just that because i can get so\nangry and because i can't really control\nmy\nemotions it makes me feel really\nguilty i guess is the word for it\nokay um can you give me an example\ni something just happened oh andy\nmilonakis just gifted a shitload of subs\nto our channel so thanks andy\num and he does that from time to time i\ndon't know\nwe love that he shows up and\nyou know bitcoin billionaires asses\num but let me just so let me ask you\ncan you tell us like paint us a little\nbit of a picture or do any memories\nstand out\num and once again you know we want to\nacknowledge for a moment that this is\njust\nan isolated memory it sounds like you're\nfor the most part like you said\nfirst and foremost that you were a happy\nkid and so it sounds like your parents\ndid a wonderful job and they're like\nactually awesome parents but no one's\nperfect\num the reason i'm gonna ask you a little\nbit about your dad is more because you\nsee that part inside of you so maybe we\ncan understand a little bit about\nhow to deal with that anger is it okay\nif i ask you to tell us a little bit\nabout like memories\nfrom interactions that you had with your\ndad okay\nright as you said memories like i so\nvividly have this in my mind that's what\nwe want\nyeah it was around christmas i remember\nbecause we were sitting next to the\nchristmas tree\nand i don't exactly remember what\nhappened or what led to this i actually\nthink it was\na pretty big turning point in my life um\nbut my dad\ni ended up talking back and my dad ended\nup calling me a [ __ ] and i remember\nbeing like\nmy dad just called me a [ __ ] like\nyou can't do that like you should just\nnot do that and i remember\nlike screaming at him and i was like\nyou have no idea how your words affect\npeople and i'm like\n16 and you're calling me a [ __ ] and i'm\nlike how do you think this is gonna make\nme feel\nlike do you think i'm gonna forget this\nand um i remember\nspecifically like what okay sorry\ncan you hear that my cat is rumbling at\ntimes i'm so sorry\nhi honey um\njust i remember because it was the time\nthat i had talked back\nlike i had finally stood up for myself\nand he called to be a [ __ ] because of\nit\nand so it was really scarring but also\nlike\nan awakening where i was like no matter\nwhat i say\nhe's just not gonna like that i am\ntalking back\ni think\nit's interesting because i i think i'm\ngetting a little bit more context of why\nchanging your hair is so empowering\nright because you kind of say that for a\nlong time you used to like be\nwhat people wanted you to be and now\nyou're being a little bit more of\nyourself\nand what i'm hearing is that you know\nyou were taught that being yourself is\nnot okay\ni definitely was taught to\nbehave\nand yeah like i would definitely\ni i it's like i would just my it was\nlike walking on\naround eggshells or whatever that saying\nis that i'm not familiar with but\nwalking on that trail\nit was very much that like one thing\ncould blow up an entire situation so it\nwas a lot of\num just kind of minding my own business\ntrying to lay low\nnot bring attention to myself kind of\nthing\nand what kind of things would set your\ndad off\num not washing a dish um\nsaying something it\nchanging his ipad wallpaper\nit could be anything and\nwhat would he say if you changed his\nipad wallpaper oh this happened to my\nwell my brother changed his ipad\nwallpaper but it was the end of the\nworld\num don't touch my [ __ ] and it's\ndisrespectful\nhow would you like it if i touched your\n[ __ ] uh\ntook all the clothes out of my brother's\ncloset threw him over the banister\njust kind of ridiculous yeah but\ni think he knows it's ridiculous uh i\nlike had the conversation with him i'm\nlike you're\nyou're ridiculous you're a ridiculous\nman and\nuh he was so i pretty much had the\nconversation with him that i was like\nwhy do you\nneed to like lash out at people when\nyou're angry\nand we it actually we had a conversation\nabout my brother because\ni think a lot of why my brother is the\nway that he is is because of my dad\nof course and um\nit was like you hurt people when you're\nangry\nand i'm like do you mean to do that and\nhe's like yeah how are any how is\nanybody gonna know that i'm angry if i\ndon't like\nsay these words like hurtful meaningful\nwords and i was like\nhow i'm so sorry like for the\nenvironment that you must have grown up\nin where you feel like you\nhad to lash out of people for them to\neven hear you because that's just not\nnormal and i was telling my dad i'm like\nand any friendship that i have right now\nif i was to be like hey you stupid [ __ ]\ni hate when you do that they're gonna be\nlike\nokay i'm not gonna be friends with you\nbecause why do i need that in my life\num and he didn't he didn't really i mean\nwe kind of\ngot to a consensus and he was like okay\nlike\ni get it but uh i don't know if it\nreally like\nresonated with him i think it was the\nonly time in his life that anyone has\never talked to him about that\nor said anything along that those lines\nwow that takes\nso i you know i'm a little bit of a\nboomer so sometimes i say things that\ncould be interpreted as misogynistic so\ni apologize because i\nyou know um so let me know if i offend\nyou\nokay but you know that takes that's\nquite a pair of balls you have there\nwhy thank you they're rather large\nyou know like i've tried to say ovaries\nyou know to be like\nyou know but it just doesn't it doesn't\nmean it do\nyou know and then like\nthen you can always use the gender\nneutral term which is that's quite a\npair of gonads\nyeah i like that that's what definitely\nreminds me of middle school\nyeah like it's it's a middle school\ninsult right\ni'm still trying to navigate this like\nyou know woke\nculture of it's tough for me so\nif i say something that's out of line i\napologize uh but that's quite a pair of\nballs you have there\nyeah i mean seriously like it's it's\nit's hard to stand up to your parents\num especially when they get so angry and\nthrow all your clothes over the banister\nwell i will i shut my mouth for 23 years\nthere's i was definitely not saying\nanything but i'm financially\nable to support myself and uh\ni don't think that he can emotionally\ndamaged me anymore\nso i felt kind of just like well we\nended up on the call and\nwhy not i've been meaning to have this\ntalk with you for literally ever\nso it was actually like really nice\nso it sounds like he was actually pretty\nreceptive to the conversation and kind\nof engaged with you\nyes he had definitely a moment\nof anger\nuh and not really yeah he definitely\njust doesn't listen\nit's funny he he's always waiting to\ntalk like if\nyou always hear yeah he's always waiting\nto talk and i can\ntell because i'm like you're just\nyelling back at me\nand it yeah um\nhe's also just a man of logic so a lot\nof\nmy arguments\nand how i now carry forth of my\narguments is through logic and i kind of\nhate that\nbecause emotions are always in play\nit's just that i know how to talk to my\ndad for him to listen to me\nso i have to like do everything\nlogically i'm like yeah well this is\nwhat you said three years ago and if you\ndon't really follow through with that\nthen that just doesn't logically make\nsense and he's like\num i'm like\n[Laughter]\nwow that's interesting usually my\nexperience with\nwith people who are super into logic is\nthat if their logic is incorrect they\nget really really angry\nand then they just can't see that their\nlogic is wrong\nthat usually okay he at least if you can\nout logic him\nthen then it he'll finally make okay\ni'll think about it\nbut yeah so i'm also hearing that\nyou know he sort of it sounds like\nyou've sort of figured this out that\nlike\nthat was just the only way he knew how\nto make himself\nheard so i didn't know that until\nlike two weeks ago i genuinely thought\nthat he like knew what he was doing\nbecause i'm like how can you be\nnot how do you not have the awareness to\nknow that you are totally messing up\npeople being mean and like um\nbut no he like genuinely didn't\nunderstand\nand i actually think that makes maybe\nmore sense to me yep\nyeah yeah it sort of makes sense because\nhe didn't really know\nwhat he was doing but also it also\nsounds like that's the way that he\nlearned\nthat feelings are taken seriously when\nyou are mean to someone\nand that's how you express to someone\nthat you were not\nokay with what they did yeah um\nthe way that you demonstrate that you\nhave been hurt is by hurting someone\nelse\num so that's that's i'm\ni'm happy for you guys and i think it\ntakes a lot of strength to have that\nconversation and it sounds like your dad\nis\nkind of willing to play ball which is\nwe'll see but yeah cool\nand um how did you get into streaming\noh uh i went to an event called pax with\nmy\nthen ex-boyfriend and there was like\nthis huge purple booth\nand i was like what's that and he's like\noh it's just like this live streaming\nplatform like oh that's weird and then i\nforgot about it\nand then um\npax west and then he actually built a\ncomputer and started streaming\nand at the same time i was like well i\nwant to build a computer because i had\nalways been a console gamer and like a\nlaptop gamer\num and then i ended up uh having some\nfriends who helped me and i built like\nthis\nreally jank like really\njust bad computer but um\nwelcome to pc master race my friend yes\nso i would watch his streams and i was\nlike this is really\ncool like this is all i've ever wanted\nin the sense that\ni've always had moments in gaming where\ni'm like oh my god i wish someone saw\nthat and\nthat is exactly what this is and so um i\nstarted streaming\nand i was also extremely lonely at the\ntime\ni was in college and was studying as\npre-med and so i literally didn't make\nany friends all i did was study\ni like didn't have the luxury or the\nintelligence to\nstudy work and have friends i could\nreally only have\nwork and school and do those two things\nwell\nand then so you worked when you were in\ncollege i worked part-time\nand then yeah and then i just like loved\nstreaming because i was so lonely\nhow did you decide to become pre-med uh\ninteresting actually i was autofilled to\nbusiness in college\nmy my parents were like you don't have\nto go to college but\nif you like you just have to do\nsomething productive in the meantime\nlike you can't just sit at home and like\nplay games and do nothing and i was like\nokay fine like i do see myself pursuing\nsomething i just don't know what it is\nquite yet and went to college autofilled\nbusiness\nand halfway through business i was like\num questioning\ni don't really enjoy this like it\ndoesn't\nlike interest me in\nany way but i was like but what is\nstopping me\nlike what do i want to do and if nothing\nwas in my way what would i do\num and i was like i would love to be\nsome sort of\ndoctor like i would love to be a\ndermatologist like in a perfect world i\nwould be a dermatologist\num like i just grew up with skin issues\nlike completely understand them and\nhated how everybody treated me and how\nmost dermatologists\ntreated me and i was like yeah i would\ntotally love to do that and then i\nrealized that\num my whole life i kind of told myself\nthat i wasn't intelligent and i couldn't\ndo that and then i was like\noh like let's just let's just do that\nlet's just at least try\num so i switched to biology\ndo you still tell yourself that you're\nnot intelligent enough to do that\nnot often not often\ni i think that like uh through\nmy degree and like going through that\nprocess i know that um i totally can\nit's just that if i'm willing to drop\neverything else\ni can like i said i didn't make any\nfriends from college so\nat what expense did i was able to like\nget good grades and maybe be pre-med\nat the expense of not having friends\nsounds about right yeah\ngetting good grades as a pre-med is\nimpressive that's not easy to do\nit it took a lot like literally\neverything that i had in me\nto to work towards that\nyou know just my experience was that i\ngot terrible grades and didn't have any\nfriends anyway\nso at least you got something out of it\nyeah of course i was both a loser and a\nfailure\nsounds like you were just a loser so\num yeah so then it says sounds like you\nstarted\nso were you like lonely in college oh my\ngod i was so lonely\num i thankfully had a really great boss\ni worked part-time\nand my boss i like developed such a\ngreat relationship with her name is\ncheryl and i love her\nlike she is the seven-year-old woman she\nis just feisty she's\num i just love her and so i had her\nthankfully and i would consider her a\nfriend it's just that our age difference\nwas really\ndrastic so we couldn't like go and\nout and do anything really other than\ngrab dinner\nand and so what was it can you tell me\nwhat what it was like to be lonely\ni heavily relied on my boyfriend at the\ntime\nwe had we dated for way too long i think\nbecause of that\num so because i had met him like my\nlike summer going into college but yeah\nwe were with each other for the entirety\nof college\nwhich makes sense uh you know like we\nwere good for each other\ni think when we while we needed each\nother kind of thing\nbut yeah i was like didn't have friends\nto rely on\nlike talk to my mom a lot and would vent\nto my\nboss but didn't really have anybody my\nage to like like anybody any girlfriends\nthat i think are\nobviously really important um do you\nhave girlfriends\ni have girlfriends now yeah how did that\nhappen\nthrough streaming all my friends are\nthrough streaming um and like\nweird coincidences i think like my best\nfriend is actually from\nwhere i'm from she was acquaintances\nwith my ex\nso we met through my ex but then she\nended up streaming and we ended up\nreally bonding over that and now we're\nroommates\noh cool yeah um and so what how did your\nuh what ended up happening with your ex\nboyfriend\nyou guys said so it sounds like it was\nlike a what you guys needed at the time\nand then\nyou kind of grew out of it or what\nhappened\nwe so he started streaming before me\nwhich created an interesting dynamic in\nour relationship\nbecause his stream didn't do so well and\nmine did well enough to be full-time and\nuh that was really the decline of our\nrelationship\ni actually found a lot of self-worth\nthrough streaming\nand uh every day\nand also just some empowerment um i've\nnever really had anything that i've\nfelt good at and i actually think that i\nfeel pretty good at streaming i'm not\nsure what\nabout it or like i couldn't pinpoint it\nto you and tell you like what i'm doing\nright i just\nfeel confident doing so i can tell you\nwhat you're doing right\noh i think you've ever\nyeah go ahead go ahead i've never\nwatched the same way yeah\nyou've never seen my stream i haven't\nseen your stream i don't need to see\nyour stream\noh that's interesting yeah\ni think you're very alive\noh i would yeah yes yeah\ni think it's it's quite compelling\nwell thank you i will i cherish those\nwords\ncherish away my friend um no seriously i\nthink it's\nit i can see i i think you have some\nlike a certain\nlike charisma right there's like\nyeah well a lot of life in there yeah\nmy pink hair shows um but through\nstreaming i\ni genuinely felt like i was good at\nsomething and so that\nchanged the dynamic in our relationship\nbecause he used to be the one that was\nlike good at everything\nmore than me or um\ni don't know we were not like\ngood with each other but we just\nhappened to be with each other i felt\nlike\nyeah so it sounds like maybe it was hard\nfor him to watch you become more\nsuccessful\nyeah and you know when your testicles\nstarted to outweigh\nhis he noticed hard yeah\nyeah it's challenging\num my wife wears the pants in the\nrelationship too so that can sometimes\nbe hard for me\num okay so and and then\nso it sounds like so i'm a little bit\ncurious you had mentioned trust and\nfriendships\nas important um can you help me\nunderstand so it sounds like you\nactually have\na fair number of friends now it sounds\nlike\num you know things maybe just ran their\ncourse with your ex-boyfriend are you\nseeing someone now if you don't mind me\nasking you don't have to i am seeing\nsomeone now\nyeah um so then so help me understand\nwhy trust or\nor friendships is kind of like something\nthat you wanted to talk about\nor so i would say that until recently\ni have good friends and i would consider\nlike my roommate's really good friends\nand then some of the people that i've\nmet through streaming\num it's just that my whole life\nfriend it's like i have horse stories\nwith friends\nor just people\nand it makes me uh\ntry to reflect and be like well why did\nall these things happen to me and like\nwhat am i doing so\nwrong and it really scares me when\napproaching new friendships because\nespecially with people that i cherish\nbecause i'm like oh when is it that\nthey're going to realize like i'm\nthis that and this and then decide to\nleave me or like\nlike yeah does that have something to do\nwith the intrusive thoughts\nyes\num absolutely yes\n[Laughter]\nyes this sort of looks like a nutrition\nplan\npeople are wondering that's what an\nintrusive thought looks like out of all\nthe thoughts that you've had\nthat you've shared over the last 45\nminutes that is the intrusive one okay\nall right so tell me what happened with\num we can we can we can get to the\nbottom of this\ni think okay um so tell\ngo ahead oh so do you want to say\nsomething else no\nokay so tell me what what happened with\nyour uh friends like before this most\nrecent\nbatch\ndrama literally i can look back on\nthe time of my life and i'm like okay\nyeah yep\noh we're finally good and the good is\nnow oh yeah\nan um middle school my uh\nelementary bully came to and switched my\nschool\ngood stuff wow they just follow you\neverywhere it's great\nyeah that's not funny\nso just like uh my parents were part of\nthis\nbusiness and i want to say that it was\nkind of like a\nkind of like a cult business probably\ni'm not sure they didn't really tell me\nmuch about it um but pretty much when\nthey switch businesses when they're like\noh yeah this is kind of\nscummy um the other\nindividuals that like oh nice place\ni went to a school it was a private\nschool and the parents that all went to\nthat all worked at the same place\nobviously like flock together and they\nall had kids and so all the kids hung\nout so like the me\nand like i think five other girls four\nother girls we would all hang out\num and then as soon as my parents were\nlike oh yeah we're not gonna be part of\nthis business anymore the parents are\nlike oh you can't hang out with jody\nanymore because we're not hanging out\nwith their parents anymore\nbut as a kid i don't think i really\nunderstood that i think i was\nlike i don't know people don't want to\nhang out with me like\nand then yeah but they were also like\nthe kids were really\nmean about it specifically one girl but\nshe was just\nreally yeah not nice to me i would cry\nevery day on the races i would literally\nbury a hole in the wood chips and dig\nmyself out of the stairs and cry and i\nremember like calling my mom\num third grade\nyou're smiling because it's comedic to\nme i imagine\nmy small self like\nburying myself with wood chips because i\ndon't emotionally know how to understand\nthis\nand i'm over it now in the\nsense that i understand like\ni'm aware enough to know that it wasn't\na me thing it was definitely like a\nparent thing but it still affects me\nemotionally\ni just understand it a bit more like\nfrom bird's eye view\nwhat do you understand that it wasn't\na me thing like i didn't do anything to\nmake these girls hate me\nbut they did\nafter my parents or after their parents\ntold me i think we can't hang out with\nyou\nokay can i think for a second\nwhat games do you play jody\num right now a lot of valerie okay\ni love minecraft okay\nrust among us but among us is okay\num i love just fps games in general and\npuzzle games so like zelda\nfavorite zelda game twilight princess\ntry you know it's sleeper sleeper head\ndid you ever play majora's mask\nuh i didn't like finish majora's masks i\nthink in its entirety i ended up not\nliking it that much but i was also young\nand have not given it another try\nso it kind of scared me it's kind of\nit's kind of demonic yeah i mean toilet\nprincess also do be kind of\na little bit less dark yeah way more\nhappy valley than\nor sorry what's uh uncanny valley you\nfamiliar with yes\nyeah so it's way creepier but um\nokay uh thank you for sharing that i\nknow it's kind of a random question but\ni'm trying to just figure out what kind\nof analogies do i need to come up with\nin my head\nto help us understand uh\nso we're going to have to go towards\nzelda because i suck at fpss\nyeah and i've never really played\nminecraft\ni still don't really understand it to be\nhonest it's okay it's\nit's you won't understand until you dig\nlike 10 hours into it\nokay so maybe i should do that at some\npoint um\nokay so let me ask you something\nhave you ever so you've it sounds like\nyou understand\nthat you know those kids were being mean\nand it wasn't really your fault\num and when you think about that girl\nwho buries herself in\nwood chips have you done anything\nbesides laugh like have you cried about\nthat\nyes i definitely went through my\nemotional\nacceptance of it\nhelp me understand what that means\nlike when i allow myself to feel really\nsad or like bad for myself it will\ngo back to that time but it is not often\ni oftentimes will just\nlaugh at it okay but you do let yourself\nis it when you're feeling bad now that\nyour mind kind of returns to that time\nor do you let your mind go to that time\nand you feel\nbad in the present this is so\ninteresting i was just talking on\nstream about how sometimes time to me\nfeels very like\nsandwiched because my memories feel\nlike i had lived in them yesterday yep\nso a lot of the times like let's say\nthat something happens i will\nremember that feeling like if something\nsimilar happens in my life let's say\nrelated to friends\nor like i'm being wrong by a friend so\nit sounds like the\npresent triggers the past you don't go\nand sit in the past\nand yeah okay cool yeah we're going to\ntalk\nit's going to be good i think you're\ngoing to we're going to figure this out\nall right it sounds like you're halfway\nthere already jody\nyour understanding of time i think is\nquite sophisticated and a very important\nrevelation\nokay now let me ask you another question\nso when you\nare living in the present and you\ntravel back to the past\ndo intrusive or intrusive thoughts part\nof that picture\nnot in this so when i'm thinking of\nmyself in the past\ndoes my past self have those interested\nthoughts no\nno so uh just ask me about the intrusion\nlet me ask you about the intrusive\nthoughts can you tell me just a little\nbit about what you mean by intrusive\nthoughts\num when i say intrusive thoughts it's\nmostly like\nmy interactions with others how i affect\nothers how others perceive\nme and how that will\nit relates to you because of how you're\nperceived\nyes and it and how\ni feel like i've been either betrayed\nor wronged or just like um not just not\nliked\nthroughout my life and so i\nfeel like there's something wrong with\nme which creates these intrusive\nthoughts\nbut that i can't really pinpoint if i'm\nlike lying to myself\nor if others are lying to me and it just\nintrusive in the sense that i'm like i\nmust be inherently bad there must be\nsomething wrong with me that somebody\njust won't\ntell me and yeah\nokay so tell me what kind of in can you\ngive me an example\nof intrusive thoughts\nuh like let's say i'm streaming with\nsomeone or like i'm collaborating with\nanother streamer and i\nsay something that's like me being\nmyself\nuh i'll i'll like have a sudden moment\nof like should i have\nsaid that or because i'm showing a\nglimpse of myself\nthis is like the last time that we'll be\ncollaborating together because i'm just\nbad i'm terrible nobody likes me kind of\nthing\num there's that laughter again\nso funny i deal with everything through\nhumor also especially\nwith streaming uh i like don't mind\ntalking about my feelings and laughing\nabout them because i\nwant people to laugh with me like i\ndon't want people to be sad for me\nso i laugh so that people mirror me\nbecause\num i because i don't\nno uh i think especially with streaming\ni want people to\nfeel happy on my stream like i want you\nto click on a quarter jade stream and be\nlike yeah this is like a positive\nuplifting happy place where we\noccasionally talk about sadness but i\ndon't leave feeling sad\nso if i talk about things that happen to\nme or don't laugh at the things that\nhappen to me then\nyou'll also feel bad you'll be like oh\nokay\ndoes that does that also apply outside\nof streaming like i can understand\ntrying to create a particular kind of\ncommunity or vibe on stream but do you\nfeel like people\nare you okay with people being sad\npitying you otherwise\nsee i in\nyes but i will not often\nput myself in those situations to be\npitied\ni guess you won't put those self\ndoes it feel uncomfortable to you when\npeople feel sad for you or pity you\ni've never thought about that let me\nthink about that\num\ni don't think it makes me feel\nuncomfortable\ni just don't want people to feel that\nway in our experience\nlike when conversating i guess\nit is not my main goal sure or like\nyeah let me ask you do you do you\nprotect other people from feeling that\nway\nyeah why\nwhere does that come from\nfrom lack of protection i think\nthat didn't take long no\n[Laughter]\nand what weren't you protected against\nuh yeah\njust mean\nand toxic experiences\nor people can you tell us about those\nthe experiences in particular or\num i remember like\noh there's a lot one that stands out in\nparticular\nis oh my god i was just talking about\nthis on stream which is funny\num the said girl who we are going to\ncontinue to go back to\nuh she we actually ended up becoming\nfriends\ni i remember having this thought and i\nwas like oh god we were so young i'm\nsure i could be friends with her now\nand we ended up like kind of getting\nalong we would hang out and i would like\ngo to her house and she\nis very she lives a very fortunate life\nshe had this beautiful pool and this\nbeautiful house i would go to her house\noften\nand i went swimming one day and then she\nended up\nkind of merging with the popular crowd\nand so i was no longer her friend\nafter that and uh i left my bathing suit\non her house and i was like hey like i\nlove bathing sure your house like can i\ncome get it and she's like oh like i\ndon't have it\nand then i was like oh shoot okay um\nthen this is when instagram was rather\nnew\ninto society but uh\nher sister posted an instagram photo of\nher wearing the bathing suit i'm like\nyeah that's definitely my bathing suit\num\nokay and then i in a message here i'm\nlike hey like can i come grab this she's\nlike\nno that's my sister's and i'm not even\nhome and then okay this is\nmy dad was probably wrong in allowing\nthis too but my dad was like yeah let's\njust like go drive her\nto her house and go get it i'm like yeah\nokay hindsight i don't think that's a\ngood\ni definitely should not have done that\nbut um the winter house\nknocked on the door the dad answered and\nhe's like oh hey jody i'm like hey i'm\nhere to pick up my baby soon\nand he's like oh yeah go on upstairs and\num she had another sister so\nuh the other sister was like oh like\nwhat are you doing here i was like hey\ni'm here to grab a bathing suit she's\nlike oh cool it's like so\nit's in her room i grabbed it i left uh\nher sister obviously told\nher that i was there and then it ended\nup being this huge thing she's like i\ncannot believe that you would trespass\ninto my house and\nsteal my bathing suit i'm like okay but\nit was definitely\nmine but it has a\nlike that is like one of those moments\nwhere it's really toxic and i know that\nshe\nwent and told a bunch of other people\nabout it and said\nmaybe things that weren't very true or\nfrom her point of view might have been\nand that like had altered the way that\npeople saw me\nand the friendships from there on out\nthat's [ __ ] up retweet\nwow\nman you just really get [ __ ] every\ntime you stand up for yourself don't you\nwhat do you think about that okay the\nfirst thought to me was like well\nwhy and yep\nyeah but i also think that's why i'm\nreally protective of others\nlike i'm i'm like straight up mama bear\nfor anybody that i\ncare about and a lot of people that you\ndon't care about\nthat too i think it's\nyeah you're very protective i think it's\nquite an admirable quality and people\neven though you sometimes get the short\nend of the stick i think people benefit\nfrom having you in their lives\nfor better or for worse um\nbut why do you think how do you\nunderstand that why do you get smacked\ndown every time you\nyou know pop poke your head above ground\num i just\ni don't really know if i have a direct\nlike i don't feel like that's happening\nto me i guess\nlike you say that i'm like oh yeah that\nlike makes sense\nbut when i do stand up for something\nit's more because i couldn't no i like\ncan't go to bed at night if i didn't\nit will eat away at me\ncan i think for a second\nso i'm going to just think out loud i\nmay need to pause in the middle\nhere but you know it's kind of\ninteresting because when we think about\nthese sorts of stories right where like\nyou leave your bathing suit at a\nfriend's house and she's like nope that\nwas mine\nand then you know kind of it sounds like\nsometimes you tried to express yourself\nmaybe with your dad\nand then that really didn't go well it\nsounds like there are a lot of times\nwhere you've tried to\nyou know show people who you are be\nyourself and you've been punished for it\nand generally speaking you know when we\nthink about that we think that the\npsychological\nconsequences that you're like meek right\nis that like when someone gets knocked\ndown like a thousand times like they're\ngonna learn how to stay down and they'll\nbe like feel really bad about themselves\nand like have low self-esteem and things\nlike that\ni don't think you have low self-esteem\nwhat do you think\num until streaming i would say that i\nfor sure had low self-esteem yep and\nhave\nsince grown\ni am i\ni have occasional low self-esteem\nsure of course everyone does but but you\nknow you're not like a downtrodden like\nyou seem to be\nconfident you seem to be vibrant\num i would not describe myself as\nconfident\nbut i am definitely how would you\ndescribe yourself\nuh definitely like fake it till you make\nyour confidence\ni want to be perceived as confident and\ntherefore\ni kind of like just\nact accordingly but deep down i don't\nfeel confident\nand i don't feel confident in the words\nthat i say i've just like conditioned\nmyself to be like okay well now speak\nhow do you feel about the words you say\num sometimes really good\ni'm like happy that i am open\nand then sometimes i'm like the whole\nreason\nwhy people don't like you is because you\ntalk so just stop talking\nbut then i'm like at a turmoil and i'm\nlike i have to be confident\nbecause i don't and i have to stay up\nfor this but at the same time\nyeah so i'm going to be a little bit\njudgmental here\ni think you're confident and i think\nconfidence is so foreign to you that you\ndon't know what it looks like\nso let me try to parse this out a little\nbit okay\nso if there's a part of you that says\ndeep down inside you\njust hypothesize okay i could be wrong\nbut\nlet's let's take a look at it and then\nyou let me know whether i'm right or i'm\nwrong because i don't know what's going\non inside\num so you know there's a part of you\nthat's like i want to speak\nand then there's another part of you\nthat's like no no don't speak that's\nstupid when you speak\nbad things happen is that fair\nis that the conflict so that's really\ninteresting because i don't detect any\ncon\nlack of confidence there so i'll give\nyou an example of what lack of\nconfidence is\ndon't speak because you're dumb\nbut i'm not hearing that from you\ni'm hearing that you've learned that\nthere are consequences to your actions\nbut not\nwhen i think about someone who's not\nconfident intrinsically they don't think\nthat their words have merit\ni'm not hearing that you don't think\nintrinsically that you\nlack merit i think you just you know\nyou've been traumatized\nyeah actually right because if you think\nabout it like i'm sure you've had\nfriends or you've felt in the past like\nyou intrinsically don't have merit right\nlike you're like\nthere's something wrong with me but that\ninner conflict that i hear now is not\nlike\ni should i feel like speaking and then\nthe other part of your voice is like no\nyou shouldn't because that's dumb\nyou're dumb sit down and shut up\nit's like people are gonna get\nfrustrated if you do that\nand that by the way may be legitimate\nright so i think that um\nyou know you have a lot of bitter and if\nyou don't know what that is i'll explain\nit in a second\nbut in ayurveda the iv is traditional\nindian\nmedicine and pitta is um\nso like they sort of diagnose\npersonalities based on like elements\nso you are like sort of like a fire type\nand there's a really\ninteresting um sign of your bit though\nwhich is the insides of the palms of\nyour hands\nand the color of them right so i know\nthat you have a lot of\num i know that i'm assuming you're\nwearing makeup\ni can't really tell um but and then i'm\nassuming that you know your hair is not\nnormally this color so like people with\nbitters a high amount of bit that that's\ncorrelated with\nredness in their body and so the palms\nof your hands\num you know are quite red right so it's\nkind of interesting so if you look at\nthe palms of my hands they're like\nwhitish right\nyeah so you've got a lot of color there\num so\nand bit this also are kind of like angry\nthey're fiery they're logical they don't\ntake things lying down they stand up for\nthemselves\num so that's maybe just a conversation\nfor a different day but i think that\nlike\nyeah i don't think that you lack\nconfidence i think i think you've just\nyou're trying to figure out like why\nwhen you express yourself\nlike people like you've learned that\nwhen you express yourself like sometimes\nit doesn't go well and people like\nmistreat you\nwhich i think sort of makes sense i can\nsort of understand what you mean also if\nyou say you're not confident because\num it does sound like you have thoughts\nfloating around in your head that\nthere's something inherently\nwrong with you that's a lack of\nconfidence\nright but i think that those thoughts\nand i guess i'm gonna\nso here's what i think by the way\nbecause i've started to do that and so\nlet me know\nyou know if it i could be completely\nwrong let me know what resonates with\nyou and what doesn't\nbut the way that i understand it um is\nthat\nyou know jody you were like so these so\nlet's think about intrusive thoughts for\na second so intrusive thoughts are\nthoughts that are unwanted\nright that's why we call them intrusive\nand what they kind of do is they sort of\nlike spawn\nin your mind like you're like going\naround about your day like duh duh duh\nduh\nlike i'm gonna eat a taco and then like\nthis thought spawns in your mind and\nit's like\nthere's something inherently wrong with\nyou you're like [ __ ]\nlike where is that coming from like i\nwas just trying to eat a taco\nand there you go again mind telling me\nthat there's something inherently wrong\nwith me it's like oh like\nhey like do you want to hang out\nsometime and you're like yeah i want to\nhang out you go hang out with your\nfriend\nhey do you want to move in together and\nyour roommate's like hey we should live\ntogether that'd be totally awesome\nyou're like yeah that'd be totally\nawesome\nyou're like that dude and it's like hey\nthere's something inherently wrong with\nyou may [ __ ] it up be careful\nit's like what the [ __ ] like why does\nthat happen like no\nno like she likes me she wants me to\nmove in with her this is great we're\nhaving fun we've hung out a lot\nlike why are you doing this to be mined\nwhere is this coming from\nand so it's intrusive because\nmuch like yourself it shows up at your\nhouse invites itself in\nand takes your bathing suit right\nit just comes in and it's like but\nhere's the really scary thing because it\nactually has a right to be there just\nlike you had a right to be there\nright because here's the thing about\nintrusive thoughts so\nintrusive thoughts like get spawned\nright they're like spawning like there's\nlike a portal\nsomewhere in your subconscious that\nevery now and then\ngets triggered and then like spawns a\nmob and then you have to like fight\nagainst the intrusive thought\nand sometimes you kill it and sometimes\nyou don't it sounds like you've gotten\npretty good at dealing with them but\nthey keep coming back\nand you're like confused because despite\nyour confidence\ndespite your success despite the fact\nthat you have friendships\ni'm assuming just based on what we\nhaven't talked about or that it hasn't\ncome up that your relationship with your\nboyfriend is pretty good\nseems like a cool dude um you know\nbecause like\nwe've talked about anyway so you want to\nhave a lot of fun we can talk about him\nbut um you know so it seems like you\nactually do trust people\nit sounds like you are standing up for\nyourself like if you have a dad who\ngets angry all the time and throws\nthings like over the banister and you\nlack confidence\nit's really hard at the age of 23\nespecially being a woman to like stand\nup to a father figure and say like hey\nthis is not okay\nthat doesn't compute for me that this\nperson has low confidence\nright because like you know inside\nyourself\nthat like this is the right thing to do\nand like it needs to be said\ni think the reason that you call\nyourself not confident is because you\nhave the intrusive thoughts but like\nwhat i want you to understand is that\nthere's you and then there's like this\nmachine over here that's like spawning\nthis portal that's just spawning the\nintrusive thoughts but that's not really\nyou\nbecause you're confident it's just\nthere's this like\nbit of malware running in the background\nthat is like\npop-up ad pop-up ad hey\npeople don't like you hey be careful\nbecause they're gonna\nsteal your bathing suit hey and you're\nlike how the [ __ ] do i get this to stop\nokay does that make sense that resonate\nwith you or okay all right so let's\ntry to understand like where do these\nportals come from like like\nand so this is where in in my experience\num\ni like the system of like eastern\nphilosophy or like eastern system of\nmind so this is where\num you know you could go to see a\ntherapist for something like this\nabsolutely but i i really like the\neastern conception of like what they say\nabout this kind of stuff\nwhich is basically that like there's\nthat little girl so like i want you to\nthink about\nwhat was going through your head when\nyou would bury yourself in wood chips\nlike do you remember what kind of\nthoughts you had\num it was specifically after\nthe girls had said some not very nice\nthings to me and they're like\nyeah we think go away and i remember\ni wanted to not be there but\nit was recess i had nowhere else to go\nyeah and do you remember what you\nthought about yourself\ni don't remember specifically anything\nabout like\nmyself i just felt\nsad and\nconfused\ni guess unwanted it's like the first\nthing that comes to mind\nyeah so that's\nthat's important right because if i\nthink about the\ni've hypothesized what some of your\nintrusive thoughts are and i think\nunwanted\nis a great way to encapsulate\nlike what is the label on that portal\nright it's like i'm like be careful\njody because they may not want you\nthey want you to move in with them but\nbe careful because if they really know\nwho you are\nthey won't want you anymore right\nand so i can tell by your face that\nthat's hurts a little bit when i say it\nright so what are you feeling right now\nhow that makes me really sad\nand\nlike how it's also unfair to others for\nme to have that\njudgment of them or like to think\nthat they are go like uh the other\nstruggle that i have is like people are\ntelling me no jody we love you\nlike i'm here for you i'm not gonna\nrandomly leave you\nand then i'm like well i know but\nand then like not only am i sad i'm not\nlike\ndisrespecting their words and how does\nthat make you feel about yourself\nnot good yeah right so you blame\nyourself\nfor fearing and so now like there's been\na big change like you've been really\nvibrant you've been really open now\nyou're sitting back your arms are\ncrossed right so like\nwe're getting there so now what we're\ndoing is like so\nthese feelings are there and um\nyou know so like this is i i think how\nwe're going to have to work through this\nbecause i think the the issue here is\nthat you do have that\nlittle kernel of like doubt and then\nlike there's a lot of self-blame there\ntoo because like if you think about it\neven now the way that when you get mad\nat yourself\nright like you think that you're the one\nwho's at fault\nso like like you're mature and you can\nunderstand that you didn't really do\nanything wrong back then but even now\nthere's actually a second portal which\nis like\nit's your fault\ndo you see how that's like but that's\njust as wrong as the first one\num i don't like see you say that and i\ncan logically agree\nand then i think back on myself in these\nmoments and i'm like\nthere's just no way that every single\nperson that has wronged me is\nlike one way straight okay this girl saw\nme bathing bathing suit well\nthen i'm like it was so long ago that\ni'm and i\nfeel this way and she was so vehemently\nlike affected by it as\nwell and like you know that i'm like\nwell what if it wasn't\nher bathing or like what if it was her\nbathing suit and that\ncan relate to any other situation too\ni'm like well what if it\nwasn't my parents switching work like\nwhat if they just didn't like me this\nwhole\ntime and they finally got the chance to\nnot be friends with me anymore\nand that was why they were so mean on\ntop of\njust like having to distance himself\nfrom me\nokay give me a give me a moment\ni was very helpful that you said that\njody\nyeah that's all the same thing okay so\nlet me so so what we've got to do is\nwe've got to understand what are the\ndifferent processes that\nare running in your mind and where do\nthey come from so i'm going to lay out\nlike\na little bit of a like system okay\nso your mind has a conscious layer and\nit has an unconscious layer\nright and so what happens is anytime we\nfeel a lot of emotional pain\nthat that that hurt\ngoes dormant and sort of becomes malware\nand then sends pop-ups\nso like you know if we think about like\na phobia for example like if i\nyou know get attacked by a dog and then\nlike\nthe next day i'm like gaming and playing\nhalo it's like no big deal my conscious\nmind is completely fine\nand then i hear a dog bark inside my\nhouse and i'm like oh [ __ ]\nand then that dormant fear of the dog\nthat came from the trauma\nsurfaces in my mind and starts\ngenerating all these thoughts\neven though there may be like maybe like\nthe tv or something like that i may not\nactually be in any logical danger but my\nmind doesn't give a [ __ ]\nbecause that emotion is there and it\nlike spawns thoughts\nso just now you said i think a really\ntelling\nuse a telling sentence\nthat makes me think that this is\nactually an echo from the past\nwhich is when you say oh they finally\nhad the excuse\nto get rid of me right so\nthat is a thought from a non-confident\nperson\nthat's why you're kind of saying so like\nif you think about the\nthinker who generates that thought that\nthinker believes that they are\nnot intrinsically valuable\nand so if we think about it like that's\nkind of confusing because you're\nconfident in yourself but then you have\nthis like\nportal that's like spawning that has\nthese lingering\nbeliefs and just like me hearing a dog\nwhat actually happens is your mind has\nthis function\nwhere i know it sounds so simple but\nwhat your mind does is look at the\nenvironment and then figure out\nwhich unconscious programs to turn on\nright so if i hear my child crying my\nsubconscious mind\nis going to activate like go into dad\nmode\nand then if i'm like you know if q pops\nwhen i'm playing a game of dota\nmy mind is like forget about that mode\ngo into wrecking shitties mode right so\nlike your mind is like constantly\nopening up programs that are appropriate\nand so what i think is happening with\nyou is that you've you as you encounter\nsituations with new friendships that\nseem to be going in the right direction\nyour mind is like hold on a second we've\nbeen here before\nand be careful because when this person\nbullied you and this is so\nthis is why it's so [ __ ] traumatized\nit's so interesting because like she\nbullied you once\nbut what really hurts is that y'all\nbecame friends and then she did it again\nright like that's so much worse like she\nwas\nshe had grown up and y'all were supposed\nto be friends\nand y'all sort of were friends and so\nthen your mind learns\nthat friends are gonna steal my bathing\nsuits\nand so then you're going along and then\nyour your roommate and best friend is\nlike hey let's be roommates and then\nthere's this part of your mind that's\nlike hold on a second\nwe've been here before she's gonna take\nyour bathing suit\nand then she's gonna talk [ __ ] about you\nto everyone that you know\nand then they're gonna realize\neveryone's gonna realize that i'm a bad\nperson\nright but the the i know it's weird\nso what are you penny for your thoughts\nbecause i don't know where you are right\nnow\nright as you said that i it's not\nactually\nthat i uh so\nit's more of so i specifically think of\nmy roommate right now who i think really\nhighly of i actually like\nis when i think about what would happen\ni'm like\nshe's just this great well-rounded woman\nthat i view herself highly that she's\ngonna look at me and be like\nand then it's not so much talk [ __ ] it's\njust that she's gonna realize that\nshe can have just better friends than me\nyeah okay so so the talk [ __ ] was off\nbut that\nyou will be revealed right to be worth\nless than what you're faking it\nlike everyone is is you know oh she like\ndid her hair like oh that's so great but\nshe doesn't realize that i'm not really\nworth a whole lot\nand so i can understand why you feel\nsort of like like obviously that's not\nconfidence but\nwhat i think this is is a some scar\nwhich is the sort of buried emotion\nand somewhere along the way your mind\nkind of learned\nthat you are not worth very much and so\nwhat happens is as long as that core\nbelief is sitting in your subconscious\nit's going to continue spawning these\nthoughts because that's kind of what it\ndoes it's sort of like you know it's\nlike a generator\nit's like a thought generator and there\nare some situations that are going to\ntrigger them\nthe interesting thing is that you can\nget rid of that so i think if you\nhaven't seen a therapist like a\ntherapist sounds like it would be like a\ngood move for you and like work through\nsome of these things\nit's not the only way to get rid of it\nbut it's something that i'd highly\nrecommend that you try\num what do you think about that by the\nway\ni've always wanted a therapist um it was\njust like\nthe means of finding one and\nalso just delegating the time for one\nokay so um you know just as an aside so\nso therapy is really designed to treat\ndiagnose and treat\nmental illnesses right so it can be used\nfor a lot more than that\nbut what i really think about is like\ntherapy is about bringing people\nup to baseline like if they're below\nbaseline\nthe other thing you could always try\nbecause it's quite accessible and and\neasy is you could try our coaching\nprogram i think there's now\na specific deal that we have with twitch\nwhere they're\nsupporting that kind of thing um and a\nlot of creators seem to be like getting\nhelp from it\nso um you know i can send you more\ninformation about either\nwe will send you information about how\nto find a therapist if you're interested\nor how to sign up for the coaching\nprogram and i'd be curious um you know\nwhether you would find that helpful or\nnot but our coaches are sort of trained\nin this methodology of like trying to\nunderstand\nlike you know where does this stuff come\nfrom um\nwhere was i going yeah so i think that\nuh jody the other thing to kind of just\nthink about is that like\nwhen i say some of these words and you\nfeel hurt now this is going to get weird\nokay because\nthat is bringing the past into the\npresent\nso you were saying that you usually go\nfrom the present into the past\nright so the way that you digest the way\nthat you close control all delete\nand and task that thing because i want\nyou to think about it like an emotional\necho\nit's like you had all that hurt like\nthere's just so much hurt back then\nand you've learned how to wall it off\nwith humor\nso like you've learned how to minimize\nthe pop-up so it's like just sitting\nthere at the bottom of your taskbar but\nit's still taking up ram\nyou don't see it anymore and you kind of\nlaugh like any every time you like\ninstead of hitting the x\nyou learn how to minimize and that's\nwhat humor is\nand you have a lot of humor and so like\nthe more\nyou laugh like the more there's\nsomething there\nyou know and so the way that you close\nit is by bringing that past\ninto the present and see like already\nnow you're like a little bit more\nrelaxed your arms are uncrossed like i'd\nimagine you're feeling less emotion\nbecause we're processing it\nright you were like then like now it's\nlike\nokay so like it kind of gets lighter and\nover time like that emotional energy\nwill like start to dwindle as you like\nsit with it now\nand um uh what i would kind of say is\nthat like\ni understand that 23 year old jody has\nunderstood all these things and you're\nlike a grown and strong\nand capable woman who's moved out and is\nfinancially independent and like you're\nconfident right\nit's so confusing because there's like\nalso the like seven-year-old jody\nis floating around in your unconscious\nand you carry her with you because she\nnever like\nprocessed because kids don't\nquestions\ni'm absorbing okay\ni'm just trying to think about whether i\nhave other things to say\nyeah so let's just sit with that for a\nsecond and then like let me know\nprocess and then let me know if you have\nthoughts or questions\nit's an interesting thought to me to\nconsider\nmy 23 year old self as this and my seven\nyear old self is this rather than this\nyep yeah\nthat's what's really confusing for\npeople right as we think of\nour our mind as monolithic\nbut like you're clearly a confident\nperson jody\nand you're also clearly not confident at\ntimes\nso how can those two contrary things\nexist\nand what the yogis figured out is that\nthe mind is not a thing\nit is a fluctuation so fluctuations at a\nparticular wavelength\nproduce a particular sound and\nfluctuations at a different wavelength\nproduce a different sound\nso in the right circumstance hopefully\nwhen you're with your boyfriend or\nhanging out with your mom\nyou produce a particular wavelength\nwhere you feel confident and good in\nyourself\nand there's certain circumstances that\nwill\nhit a certain twang on your guitar\nstring it'll hit a different guitar\nstring it'll create a different\nfluctuation in your mind and then you'll\nfeel less confident\nand so people are confused but like\nthat's how it works and so is it\nessentially what we can do by like\nbringing the past into the present i\nif you want to i can we can do more of\nthat i'll basically say things that are\ngoing to make you feel\nmore of the hurt come up right because i\nknow how to tune your guitar strings and\nso i can you know say things to you that\nare going to be like empathic\nand i will pity you and then it's going\nto like bring up this emotion\nright if i start to feel sad for you\nit's gonna like it's gonna be weird\nyou're gonna try to laugh it off for a\nlittle while\nand then like you know but if i persist\nand i don't let you squirrel away\nand like make me smile and if i persist\nin being sad for you\nthen like something weird is gonna\nhappen\ni just don't know that we want to go\nthere today does that make sense\nit is so interesting to me\nthat i have subconsciously been doing\nthat\nlike i really really ha i don't want\npeople to feel bad for me\nyeah i'm like really intrigued by that\ni didn't really notice that i\nas much as i want to talk and tell\npeople my story at the same time i don't\nwant that exact story\nto make people sad or like\nfeel bad for me\nyou want to go there or enough for today\nseriously what's wrong with making\npeople feel sad\n[Music]\num\ni don't i guess i don't think to myself\nit's wrong to make people feel sad yeah\ni know i just think that i approach\nconversations or just whatever in\ngeneral\nas i want to make people laugh\nwhy is that important to you\nit brings me joy like it makes me feel\nfulfilled\nyeah okay\nso it's definitely like also a selfish\nthing like i'm\napproaching this conversation to make\nyou laugh which in turn makes me feel\nfulfilled which is like\nstreaming like i want to farm little w's\nnot like decolons\ni i don't know what that means they're\njust emotes\nokay pretty much i just don't\ncall in a penis\nno okay\ncuz you know what penis is a part of the\nd the d is the\nso is so many other things part of the d\num\nit's one of the three it's a bunch of\ncolons followed by a d\nis that not the same\nyeah anyways it's like the sadness\nshock e-boat okay okay oh yeah these are\nlike the cheat codes where if you type\nin something it shows an emote yeah\ni recently discovered that i was\nfiguring out how to make a fish\ni figured out the fish is four o's\nokay do you feel fulfilled now\nyeah interesting right so we can make\nyou laugh and then\nfeel fulfilled so what's it like if we\ndon't laugh how do you feel\num\ni may have just screwed it up by the way\nif we were gonna try to go there i may\nhave just destroyed the emotional\nwavelength but whatever\ni maybe for another day\ni can't just i don't maybe like it's not\nuncomfortable\nunsettled maybe or like\nit can't end there like if we end the\nconversation\nsad i like cannot\nokay right so so what i'm hearing is\nthat you can't sit with the sadness\nyeah right so like that's so\nuntil you can sit with the sadness the\nintrusive thoughts will continue\nright so what we've got to do is like\nlet seven-year-old jody like come and\nsit in our lap and we've got to let her\ncry and we just have to like kind of be\nthere with her and let her cry\nand like pat her on the back you know we\ndon't need to distract her with jokes\nand tell her everything's okay like we\nhave to sit with her and tell her like\nhey\nwhat happened to you is not okay and\nit's not\nfair that you feel like you're a bad\nperson because you're not a bad person\nand it's really really sad that they\nhave done something to you to\nmake you feel and believe that you are\nnot a good person\nand that you are not worth being friends\nwith\nand you don't deserve that and you\ndidn't do anything wrong\nforeign\nforeign\nwhat was that like for you well the\nwhole time i'm like\nsee no jokes no no cracking up\nbut i also like\ni it's like so a part of me\nwants to hear those words and allow that\nand allow me to feel those raw emotions\nand then the other part of me is like\nhe cannot\nyeah what would happen if i did\ni just feel like\na motion that i show that is not\ncalculated is wrong\nokay so i can take that i think we're at\na good stopping point for today\nif you have more thoughts and questions\ni think that's totally fine but\nwhat i mean to say is that i think we've\nreached a good spot and we shouldn't\npush any further i think we've reached\nthe limit of\nhow far i understand that you're willing\nand enthusiastic consciously i think\nsubconsciously this is like\nthis was hard for you and so i i think\nyou did a great job but i don't think we\nshould push anymore\nso a couple of things one is you got to\ngive this time right because for\nyears if not decades um\nyou haven't like you know that he\ncannot is like that's a strong like you\nthat\nthere's a lot of strength behind that\ndoes that make sense\nit's like a minotaur it's like not\nno is what it's saying and so that we\nhave to\nwe don't want to force it it's going to\nhave the opposite\nresult right so like what we're doing is\nlike when you're under the bridge\nor under the stairs and in a pile of\nwood chips\nwhat we don't want to do is like i'm not\ngoing to reach my hand and like yank you\nout and i'm like you don't have to be\ndown there\ni'm going to no no no what we're going\nto do is we're going to sit outside\nwe're going to sit right by the stairs\nand we're going to be like jody whenever\nyou're ready\ni'm here if you want to come out\nand we can talk about it and then jody's\nlike\nno i'm not no go away and so we're just\ngoing to sit\nand we're going to be patient so you\nneed to give yourself some time\nanother thing to think about because you\nare a streamer\nis that um you know when we talk about\nboundaries so we should really think\nabout whether this is the kind of thing\nthat\nare we making it hard for you harder\nthan it needs to be or that it deserves\nto be because you're talking about it on\nstream\nso we want to create an environment\nwhere maybe privacy would help you come\nout more\ndefinitely something to think about\nright because you do say i don't want\npeople to feel this way so like that's\nfine\nleave your streamer persona how it is\nbut you get to have a space maybe\nprivately like you can kind of think\nthrough that\num but i really encourage you to like\nlearn how to sit with it\nbecause i i think like she's been down\nthere for a while and like she doesn't\nyou know\nand she's like under the stairs and then\nlike you're going about your business\nand then occasionally she'll sob and\nsend a thought your way\nright so thoughts about that questions\ndoes that sound okay to you\nyes okay\ni am really welcoming the\nidea of\nseeing myself underneath the stairs\ncovered in wood chips and seeing that as\nmyself\nbut also seeing that as like just a\nlittle girl that i would\ncomfort and treat a little differently\nyeah you gotta treat her like your cat\nyeah\nthat's that's what the girl under the\nstairs needs right like she just\nyou know and and i think that like by\nthe way this is what we call like i know\nthere are a bunch of instagram posts\nabout\nself-compassion that's what that is by\nthe way\nright so i think you're really good at\nprotecting other people you're really\ngood at making them laugh but i don't\nknow that you're actually compassionate\ntowards yourself\ni can tell that you're kind of a treat\nyo self kind of person like i get that i\nget that you're like about\nliving which is it but that's 23 year\nold you\nmm-hmm and i get that i get that vibe\num but i you know that's self-compassion\nand it's\nsomething that's hard to learn cool\ncool um\nso i also often times will teach people\nhow to meditate\ni'm sort of drawing a blank there but\ni'm curious are you interested in\nmeditation\nyes okay [ __ ] i have to come up with\nsomething\nokay i'm gonna need a minute is that\nokay that's fine\nwhat are we gonna what kind of\nmeditation helps for being buried in\nwood chips\ni want to teach you something fun but\nwhat do i know that's fun\nwhat's gonna help you\nhave you tried meditation before\nokay so i also try to teach a little bit\nof variety but it's occurring to me that\nmaybe what we need to do is just because\nwe've never had done meditation we still\ngot to start with the basics we can't\njump straight to advanced techniques\nso i'm gonna tell you you've got two\noptions you've got one that's\nenergetic and one that's common\nwhich one do you want\nokay so i'm gonna teach you how to chant\nokay we're gonna do ohm chanting\nthis is gonna sound weird all right so i\ngotta i can't i've learned how to not\nleak things so i gotta move to push to\ntalk and this gets really confusing for\neveryone because\ni forget to push push to talk so you\nprobably can't hear me anymore\nyeah yeah so i'm gonna forget to push\npush to talk a lot so\nit's gonna be rough on you okay\nso um this this we have to do just\nbecause of the way that discord voice\nactivity picks up\nthe chant oh so i'm gonna chant om\num so om is composed of three syllables\nah\nand the reason that we sort of do that\nis because\nom starts with a fully open mouth so\nopen your mouth as loud as you can or\nwow wide as you can and then make a\nsound\nright now yeah yeah try as wide as i can\nyeah and then make sound ah\nthere you go see there's ah right okay\nand then close your mouth entirely and\nthen make a sound\nthere we go right so that's the ah and\nthe um and in the middle of those is\ngoing to be the ooh\nso um\ngot got me so that's actually where so\nlike this looks\npretty confusing because people is like\noh om is like the fundamental sound of\nthe universe man\nit's not it's really not i mean sure\nit's the fundamental sound of the\nuniverse you know if you're a yoga\ncalendar\nbut what it really is it's just like uh\nokay so that's ohm so we're gonna do is\nchant it\nfive times i want you to really use your\ntesticles to their maximum\nwhen you're chanting okay and so i'm\ngoing to demonstrate once\nand then we'll do it once together\nwe'll check in for a second just make\nsure that you feel comfortable doing it\nand then we'll do like five rounds\nokay so i'm gonna sit up straight so\nit's important when you meditate that\nyour back be straight\nso since you're pre-med i'm gonna ask\nyou\nquestions that will test your ability to\nyou know be a surgeon so what are the\ndifferent positions that your back can\nbe straight\nlying down yes yep\nand standing up right so those are the\nthree beautiful\nright so like it perfect so that's why\nthose are the three positions that we\ncan do when we meditate\nanother little tip um how tall are you\nfive\nthree and do your feet touch the floor\nwhen you're in your chair\nno are your feet down right now i have a\nyoga block\nyou have a yoga block where oh beneath\nyour feet my feet\nokay so so this is what i want you to do\ncan you sit cross-legged\nuh yes okay so but this is gonna be\ntricky you're gonna have to put\nthe cat down because what i want you to\ndo is sit on the yoga block\nput your butt on the yoga block and then\nsit cross-legged so that\nhow big is yoga block is small right yes\nmy yoga block is small\nyeah so i want you to sit on it like\nunder your bum\noh on my chair yeah on your chair\nand so that you're but i want you to\nnotice so let's just put let's let's\nstart with this put the cat down\nsay honey okay\nwhat's the cat oh he said he's like\nwhere am i\nokay no yoga block yet no yoga block yet\nokay okay\nokay cross-legged first just sit\ncross-legged\nindian style if you want to culturally\nappropriate something\nokay so notice what your back is doing\nwhat's your back doing\nuh yeah perky uh nobody can see jody\noh no one can see jody thanks\nwife okay so um\nso it you're gonna be slumping a little\nbit maybe you feel that\nno no okay so now i want you to sit on\nthe yoga block but like not don't have\nyour feet on the yoga block like sit\njust elevate your butt okay\ngrabbing my yoga block okay\noh my gosh\nnow try to sit cross-legged i can't hear\nyou\nand now try to sit cross-legged oh\noh tell us what happened\nit's comfy it's like this is much\ncomfier your back is naturally straight\nright yeah it's weird physics\ntaller now yeah yeah i think you're five\nfive\ndefinitely okay so now i'm gonna\ndemonstrate so we're gonna sit up\nstraight\nokay okay and then i'll demonstrate one\nround\n[Music]\ngot it yes okay\nlike i said use your testicles yeah i'm\nimpressed by how long you were able to\nhold that\nyeah it doesn't need to be that long\nokay okay\num so deep breath in and let's begin\ngreat job couple things to do one is\neyes need to be closed\nsecondly is if you bob your head around\nyour back is not straight\nspine needs to stay straight okay nope\nnone of this\nbobbing of the heads that's too much\ncultural appropriation you only get to\ndo that if you're indian\nokay so back straight we're gonna do it\nagain okay and then so eyes closed it's\na big deep breath\nah ooh and um\n[Music]\n[Laughter]\n[Music]\ngood i definitely cannot hold it as long\nas you\nthat's okay so just just just do it\nwe'll shorten it okay so i want you to\ndo whatever you're comfortable with in\nterms of the length\nand i want you did great you may feel a\nlittle bit silly or self-conscious\ni want you to just chant through it so\nwe're going to do five rounds in a row\num let me just think about whether do\nyou feel comfortable leading and all\nkind of follow your lead or do you want\nme to lead\nokay you lead okay so\ni'll follow you so you go forward eyes\nclosed five rounds\nand then after we're done i want you to\njust stay silent\nwith your eyes closed i know this is\ngonna sound weird\nsit in the post post-meditation space\nyou can continue to breathe and stuff i\nknow it sounds weird you'll understand\nwhen we get there\njust hang out after we're done with the\npractice and when you're ready to\nopen your eyes do you want to sit on a\npillow instead of the block would that\nbe easier\ni'm struggling on the block\nall right but thankfully i have a\nplethora of pillows here\nall right there we go okay back straight\ntake it away jody okay\n[Music]\nbeautiful\n[Music]\ngreat again\n[Music]\nthree more\n[Music]\n[Music]\noh\nlast one big deep breath\noh\n[Music]\nyou\nif you're ready you can go ahead and\ncome on back okay it came back a little\nbit earlier to be honest but you you're\nnice and then i\ncan tell i could tell i could tell you\njust have a lot of trouble just sitting\n[ __ ] still\nso we'll teach you that yeah so this is\nwhy i like to combine\nmeditation so if you want to see a\ntherapist i think we're going to send\nyou some information everyone who comes\non stream will send you like a guide of\nhow to find a therapist and stuff like\nthat\num you know if you want to sign up for\nthe coaching program whatever but here's\nthe cool thing\nso i think meditation works very\nsynergistically with therapy if you\ndecide to go that route\nbecause what we're going to literally\nteach you how to do is\nsit and just sit with what you feel\nwithout reacting to it\nright because right now jody what you\nreally the biggest thing that i'd say\nyou need to grow\nis like you need to be able to sit with\nthings without reacting to them\nvery reactive i mean don't get me wrong\nit's a beautiful reaction but it's still\nlike\nreactive you can't tolerate so many\nthings\nand so just sit\nyou're fine you're perfect just the way\nyou are you don't need people to think\ndifferently\nyou don't need to be different you don't\nneed to have a different color hair you\ndon't need to do this you don't need to\ndo that\nyou're great just the way you are your\ncat\nunderstands this cat doesn't want you to\nbe different\nyou're just be you\nfeel me yeah okay\nsee that was good you sat with it that's\ngood\nquestions thoughts before we wrap up for\nthe day\ni do not have any okay well thank you\nvery much for coming\non good thank you for having me yes\nit was awesome yeah i i feel really good\nabout this\nyeah and good luck to you and you know\nkeep us posted\nand and you know if you ever need us to\nattack\nanyone who is wrong to you just let us\nknow because we're good at that\nokay let me know if anyone wrongs you\ni'm good at that too\ncool okay so take care and good luck\nand uh you know keep us posted all right\nyou too\nbye bye\nso who are we rating um who we rating\ni can't tell is is foosley a real person\ni i feel like you guys are trolling me"
