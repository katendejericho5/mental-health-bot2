    "transcript": "the third thing this is probably the\nmost important one which\ni had said is that like you're gonna\nnotice when people are quiet\num so what do we what uh what do you go\nby by the way do am i calling you hafu\nor should i\ngo oh my god is great okay\nand um what do you want to talk about\ntoday\nwhatever i'm down to talk about whatever\nokay that's pretty vague\nhow are you feeling\ni am feeling okay today i'm feeling good\ntoday is a good day some days i don't\nfeel as good\nand it probably has to do with viewer\nnumbers\nif i'm being candid okay and um\nit feels like maybe i should be able to\ndo more\nor maybe i should have been able to put\nup better content or something\num and if i don't win any games i'm in a\nreally bad mood\nso you and the rest of the internet\nyeah so today you're feeling good and\nyou said in the past sometimes you feel\nless\ngood um\nso let me just ask you because i'm kind\nof feeling a little bit different today\nso um do you want to talk about like how\nstuff works\nor do you want to talk a little bit more\nabout like your emotions and your\nexperience of things\ni think either i feel like i have a\npretty i mean i think everyone\ncan use therapy i'm not saying that i'm\ntoo smart for therapy or anything like\nthat\nbut i feel like when i was younger i was\nvery unhappy i was definitely depressed\nand it was kind of cool because\ni was so like depressed and insecure\ni put all my time and energy into wow as\nan escape\nand i actually become a pro wow player\nand that gave me a lot of confidence\nbecause it was\ni got it yeah that's my fiance\nhe's also the streamer um but it gave me\na lot of confidence\nand um i kind of used like game theory\nto psychoanalyze myself and basically in\ngames\ni would be like why am i losing i don't\nknow\nuh that's not a good thing why don't i\nknow why i'm losing because i don't have\nenough information about the game\ni would like try to pinpoint the you\nknow exactly what i had to do against\nevery class\nand um kind of learn from there\nand so i kind of saw myself like what\nwhat do i not like about myself\ni didn't like anything about myself when\ni was 17. let me tell you\nand i was like very passive-aggressive\ni'd kind of like lie all the time\num to just try to like make myself feel\nbetter\ni would talk poorly about others all the\ntime i didn't like how i looked\nlike everything and then i kind of went\ndown the line of\nyou know what can i fix and what do i\nhave to just kind of live with\nand yeah now i'm i feel like now i'm 29\nand um i kind of fix a lot of those\nthings\ni think i over fix the passive\naggressive thing i'm too blunt\nnow i'm a little too blunt so that's\nsomething i'm working on\num is to not be brutally honest and i\ncan phrase things in a better way\nbut other than that i feel like i'm\nhappy with who i am\nokay so that was not what i was\nexpecting\noh um no i mean i\ni find myself being incredibly curious\nabout\neverything that you just summarized oh\nlike how so here's what i'm hearing this\nis a 17 year old hafu\nwho lies a lot is passive aggressive\nhates everything about herself\ngoes on this like journey of\nintrospection and then\nis now largely happy with who she is as\na person\nyeah which sounds like maybe we should\nlearn about that journey because maybe\nthere's something really really\nimportant there\nsure um and then also if there are\nparticular things that you still want to\nkind of talk about or try to understand\nuh you know we can talk about\n29 year old hafu yeah then\ncongratulations on being engaged\nthank you i still definitely have a chip\non my shoulder\num one thing that uh\nmy entire gaming career i've always had\npeople tell me i don't deserve it\nand i'm trying to like kind of like tear\ndown my successes\num for example in world of warcraft they\nsaid i played with the two best players\nand i was just kind of like\ncarried to winning a bunch of\ntournaments um\nand then i won i went pro in a second\ngame called bloodline champions where i\nwon dreamhack\nthey told me that i played with the two\nbest players i know deserve it\num pretty much like in every single\nachievement that i've done in gaming\npeople try to take it away from me but\nnow at this point it's a bit ridiculous\nlike\ni don't think anyone tried to take away\nmy pogchamps 2 victory\num i don't know it's gotten better over\nthe years\na game oh it was a chess tournament you\nknow um\nthat streamers get invited too okay uh\nso they invited all these streamers\nand um i won\nyeah it was uh like they it's like\nhikaru and like\nthe bow test sisters they they coach all\nlike\nthey coach streamers and then the\nstreamers face off\num but yeah lately lately as i've had\nmore and more achievements\npeople have kind of just backed off a\nbit but they're still\nyou know on the thread there's always\nthat one [ __ ] who just still tries to\nsay that i don't deserve it and stuff\nit's annoying it's\ndeep down it does annoy me and i always\nfeel like i have something to prove\num and that's something i'm working on\nbecause whenever i see someone else like\nbotes try to defend herself\num to haters telling her like oh you're\nonly successful because you're a pretty\ngirl and some\nlike i'm like oh don't defend yourself\nyou don't need to explain yourself\nbecause i feel the same way like you're\nvery energetic\noh i've had a lot of coffee\nbut um yeah i feel like i still\nthat's something i want to work on is i\ndon't feel like i\nshould feel the need to prove myself\nover and over because some people are\njust going to\ntear down my achievements no matter what\ni do or what i accomplish or how many\nthings i've done you know\nand um but i can't help it\ni always feel like i need to prove\nmyself\nyeah where does that come from um like i\nsaid just\nwhen i was younger it's just all i heard\ni\ni've always felt like each one of my\nachievements is like an echo chamber of\nlike\npeople being like you don't actually\ndeserve it and you just got lucky or\nlike\nyou only have viewers because you're\nfemale or you know\nthere's always some excuse and um\nyou're not actually that good blah blah\nhere are some stats um\nand i oh god i got into it with my\nfiance because he's\nhe's really really good at games and he\ndoesn't understand\nmy struggle okay so one of our biggest\nfights was like\nhe doesn't understand the kind of\ncomments that i get\nas an asian female versus him being a\nwhite male\nand like i don't know like no one really\ntries to tear his achievements down\nand i would try to explain that to him\nand he didn't understand it at first but\nnow he\nlike kind of can see more from my point\nof view\nthat just um yes i don't know\nmaybe it's not stupid but it feels like\ngirls have a lot more to prove\nin the gaming space sure what does he\nunderstand now that he didn't understand\nbefore\nthat there's inherent biases in that\nlike no one\nquestions his achievements the way that\nthey try to pick apart mine\nfor the validity of mine whenever he\nwins something he doesn't have people be\nlike okay but he's not that good like he\ndoesn't get those kinds of comments\nsure and he did yeah it's just like\nbecause he doesn't get it\nhe thinks that it's fine when i get mine\ni don't know he can't relate to it at\nall because it doesn't happen to him\nand for the um sorry\noh i mean the example i always use that\nhelped him realize\nwas i was on his stream and someone\ncalled me a corona [ __ ]\nand i was like they're tagging in one\nlittle phrase\nthey're attacking my gender and my race\nright things that i'm are out of my\ncontrol\nand for him he was complaining that\npeople said his voice was boring\nand i was like you don't see how these\nare different\nthese are like they come from a\ndifferent place\ni don't know so what i'm hearing is that\nsort of early on\nhe wasn't appreciating the significance\nyeah of course we have struggles right\nyeah but i mean he it sounds like maybe\nhe was equating some of his struggles to\nsome of your struggles and you felt like\nthat was an unfair comparison\nyes yeah that every he says like\neveryone gets bad comments\nyeah and i was like yeah excited but\nit's not the same\nit's not the same thing yeah it would\nalways annoy me\nwhat's different about it well\none is completely out of my control\nthey're attacking things that i'm born\nwith\nand have nothing to do with even the\ngame\nright they're just like basically um\njust attacking me as a human being\ninstead of like an aspect about me i\nguess\nso they're not calling you a shitty\nplayer which oh they did that too\nbut you know they do that with the other\nstuff\nand um i don't know i just always felt\nlike i had to\ndefend myself for why i got viewers or\num\ni don't know dumb stuff\ncan i think for a second yeah\nmy child wants to tell me to say no when\nyou can say no can i think for a second\neveryone's like say no\nsay no yeah\ni just think it's funny that is it a\nmeme from your stream\nyep sorry okay it has trickled over\nso i do something pretty unusual which i\ni guess you know has become\nspecific to me which is that sometimes\nin conversation i actually pause to\nthink\nand i don't just keep talking yeah\nthat's fair\num i think it's good too but\nyou know by all means say no to satisfy\nyour chat and let's see what happens\nbecause no one's ever said no\nno no no someone's gonna do it one day\nyeah so okay hafu let's\nlet's talk about so um\nall right so you feel like you've got\nsomething to prove\nyes yeah and i know that i shouldn't\nfeel that way\nbut i can't help but feel that way why\nshouldn't you feel that way\nbecause you can't ever please everyone\nand there's some people who are just\ni don't know they just live to tear\nother people down so i'm gonna\nthank god i'm gonna just point something\nout so i shouldn't feel that way\ni think that that doesn't help you solve\nthe problem\nwell feeling up getting upset about it\ndoesn't fix the problem\nyes agreed so getting getting upset\nabout a problem doesn't fix a problem\nbut when you get upset about your a\nproblem and then you beat yourself\nup for it anyway by telling yourself i\nshouldn't feel this way\nyou're actually like joining the enemy\nright because what you're doing is yes\nso this is weird so i i want you to just\nthink about this\nlet's say that like you know i feel\ninsecure about\nmy face okay okay and then then if i\nfeel insecure about my face like what's\nyou know that like telling myself that i\nshouldn't feel insecure\nis actually like invalidating the way\nthat i feel right so imagine for a\nsecond that you you told your boyfriend\nyou know when i get called a corona [ __ ]\non stream it's different from people\ncommenting on your voice\nand then he says you shouldn't feel that\nway\nhow would you respond to him i slapped\nthe [ __ ] out of him\nabsolutely right\nbut when you feel insecure about\nyourself and then you tell yourself\nthe same thing what do you do to\nyourself\ni don't think i'm a corona [ __ ]\nyeah but my point is that like you tell\nyourself you shouldn't feel that way and\nthat's totally cool\nbut if he tells you you shouldn't feel\nthat way it's the same message\nbut if it's coming from your mind or his\nmouth the response is completely\ndifferent do you see that\nyeah it's a bad message but we tell\nourselves that for like\ni don't we'll get into that but i just\nwant to point that out to you that like\nactually if you stop and think about it\nit's absurd and all we have to do is\ntransmit your thoughts to his mouth and\nthen you quickly see that like it's like\nnot\nactually okay to not feel that way\nbut don't you think that i should\nif i pay too much attention to all the\nnegative things don't you think\nstreamers would just collapse\ni think let me let me rephrase i think\nor\nreframe the question if they pay\nattention to too many negative things\nwould they collapse\nprobably but i feel like yeah yeah go\nahead\noh just you know i i mean you're a\nstreamer so i'm sure you can relate to\nthis but like\nstream i mean for streamers and anyone\nin the public eye you get like\nthousands and thousands of affirmations\nright and then\nfor the one for the few people who are\nloud and\nrude you still those stick out more\nthan the thousands of affirmations right\nis that not\nthat's pretty normal no that's pretty\nnormal for streamers\nyes that's what i'm saying so like i\ni know that if i like focus on\nonly the negatives it will overrule me\nso what i try to do is just to ignore\nthem\nyep yeah i understand so so cool so this\nis why i was thinking because this is\ngoing to be tricky to navigate but it's\ngoing to be awesome\nso you have developed an adaptive system\nright so like let's just\nthink off i'm going to pull out an ipad\nin a second okay\nso should i do it now let me think about\nthat\nno i'm not allowed to think okay okay so\nwe're gonna do this if you can't fault\nif it's easier or it's hard to follow me\nbecause i'm about to get\nabstract okay i'm gonna pay attention to\nmy chat\nyou pay attention to your chat and then\nyou let me know if i should bust it out\nokay\nso here's the thing you have this idea\nwhich is\nokay i can't afford to focus on the\nnegative\ntherefore when i feel negative i'm gonna\nfight against that negativity so telling\nyourself i should\ni shouldn't feel that way is a fighting\nagainst the negativity\nand essentially an antidote to focusing\non the negative from other people\nno i didn't follow okay i've had time\nokay so this is this is what i'm saying\nokay so like you've got\nthere's positive stuff on the internet\nand there's negative stuff right yes and\nso the negative stuff\nfrom this is from the internet\nenters your mind so here's your mind\nokay so then you've got negativity in\nyour mind\nokay okay so they say for example\nyou don't deserve it\nokay you uh\nyou don't deserve it\nso then what happened so like let's just\nthink about this when when you encounter\nsomething with your sense organs\nit enters your mind and then this\nthought is present in your mind\nokay so then what happens is in order to\nblock this thought\nyou have another thought you\nshouldn't care\nfeel that way sure care is better\nshorter\nokay now we can't see the ipad that's\nnot my fault hold on hold on\ngood point thanks okay yeah i don't know\nwhat you're saying i mean i don't know\nwhat you're writing\nyep thanks a lot\nmissed okay so we gotta i forgot one\nstep\noh oh there we go okay ah\noh okay i was like okay you're just\nwriting stuff okay okay i'm gonna\nokay zoom in on that one so so let me\nwalk you through this again okay\nno no it's not okay i'm a boomer because\ni'm\nokay so this is the positive and\nnegative stuff\nis over here okay this is from the\noutside this is your mind and so it\nenters your mind and then this\nthought gets transmitted from the\noutside into your mind\nokay you with me and then what you do so\nthis is the\nyou know in terms of like biochemistry\nand neuroscience and stuff we use this\nsymbol to imply\ninhibition okay okay\nso and then so this is the thought that\nyou tell yourself to\n[Music]\nfight against this idea that you don't\ndeserve it you with me\nyes okay but now now as we pointed out\nthis thought is actually invalidating\nright you remember like why so so so\nbecause like like we said with your\nboyfriend like if you feel\nbad in a particular way and your\nboyfriend says\nyou sure sorry fiance says you shouldn't\ncare you'd slap him across the face\nyeah right and and so what that means is\nthat like oddly enough\nwhen we feel bad about something instead\nof invalid like like telling ourselves\num\nbecause when you say you shouldn't care\nit's sort of like saying like you're\nstupid for caring\nuh yeah it's more like\nyeah go ahead you shouldn't care because\nif you care every time then\nlike you can't do anything about people\nlike that\nif you waste energy being upset then you\nwill be upset most of the time\ni agree so remember this is an\nadaptive response yeah it's like the\nbest\nit's not a perfect thing but it's more\nlike the best\nway to handle it because your brain\ncan't ignore\nall of the negativity yep but if you\nfocus on the negativity and you allow\nyourself to get upset over every time\nand try to defend yourself\nfrom it every time then it becomes more\nand more toxic\ncompletely agree completely i think\nyou shouldn't care is the best response\nthat i have\ni completely agree which is why so so\nhere's the thing\nwhen you tell yourself you don't care\nwhat happens to this thought\nthat it doesn't matter so what's the\nchip on your shoulder\nthat there's still people saying that\n[ __ ] is annoying\nright so what this means okay so so what\nthis means is like this is still an\nopen wound\nright like the reason that this is the\nchip on your shoulder\nis because this is the feeling that you\ninvalidate for yourself\nso essentially what your adaptive\nresponse does\nis takes that emotional hurt and makes\nit\ndormant right so you suppress it by\ntelling yourself you shouldn't care\nbut the problem is that it continues to\nlive there and you never really get free\nof it\nbut there's no solution other than like\nthere's no\nbetter way to deal with it like i\nunderstand what you're saying what i'm\ndoing is sweeping it under the rug\nright yep very good yes i understand\nbut there's nothing i can do i can't do\nanything about it i can't\ni can't yeah i feel like that's the best\nway to handle it\ndo you suggest another way to handle it\nabsolutely i'm going to teach you\nanother way\noh okay right so so it\ntotally okay so let's talk for a second\nall right so hold on\nno [ __ ]\noh this will be interesting yeah because\nwhenever i've thought about this it was\nlike\nthere's nothing i can do to control\nother people so the best way\ni can oh [ __ ] hung up on her\nsorry hello yeah sorry i just was i\ntried to stop screen sharing with you\nand hung up on you instead because\noh you're all good you're all good okay\nyeah i mean from my perspective it's the\nbest way because\nthere is no other solution i i\nunderstand where you're coming from and\ni think that's what gets us into these\nproblems is that\nwe've lost the understanding of like how\nthis stuff works\nso i i think that that it's very good\nthat you have developed this adaptive\nresponse\nbut i think that in general if we want\nto grow as people what happens is that\nour minds and our brains\ncome up with the best answer that they\nknow how and when did you start\ntelling yourself that you shouldn't feel\nthat way\num i'm gonna cry\nbut i used to just get a lot of\nharassment\non twitch and\noh i'm gonna cry i knew it's gonna cut\nat some point but just\nit used to be really bad for me and\ntwitch didn't have any systems to\nprotect streamers\nand i had to make the choice between\nlike streaming\nor quitting right like i either had to\njust live\nwith it in order to quit and i almost\ndid quit\ni almost did quit um\nit's gotten so much better over the\nyears and\ni don't face any of that now so it's in\nthe past\nbut is it a lot of it is it's like\ni can't even express how bad it was\ni can't even express how bad it was it\nwas so [ __ ] bad back then\nbut you know it was my career and i\nalways felt like\nyou know streaming is my job i dropped\nout of college where it's something i\nlove doing\nand just felt like i had to uh\ni had to suck it up or i had to quit\nand so i really tried to suck it up for\na long long long time and i got to a\nbreaking point and i almost did quit\nand i don't even remember why i didn't\nbut um\nyeah i mean i i have no complaints\nanymore\ni have a really nice community and\neveryone's nice and everyone else's\ncommunities too whenever i collab with\npeople\nand it's been so much better um\nbut i felt like if i didn't have the\nattitude that i would just break\nyou know like i couldn't do anything\nelse about it\nit was so bad that i would bottle it up\nand then just like break down once every\nmonth\nit'd be like when i'm pmsing or\nsomething and i i like couldn't handle\nit\ni'd take a day off and i would just cry\nevery month\ni haven't cried in so long to be honest\nbut i remember it was so so\nso hard but i mean what else could i do\nlike i don't know it felt like it was\nthe only thing i knew how to do was\nstream\nso i just felt like i should just suck\nit up\nit sounds like you felt really trapped\nyeah\nreally really trapped\nbut yeah like i said it's gotten so much\nbetter now and\ntimes are changing and like i don't know\nharassment used to be like cool\nlike 10 years ago it really was\nand i feel like that has changed and i\ncan't emphasize how grateful i am for\nlike twitch\nyou know like there's auto mod there's\nlike i don't know\na lot of there's just a lot more tools\nto help streamers\nand uh yeah i haven't i haven't even\nthought about it in so long\ni've just been so grateful the last few\nyears i've been very happy and\ni yeah i don't have that to complain\nabout anymore\nfor sure sorry i'm crying a lot\nbut yeah it was definitely something i\nhad to teach myself was just to care\nless\nbecause i i remember talking to destiny\nabout this\nuh you know destiny the stream right\nhe's a good friend of mine\nand he's like the only thing you can do\nis let it not affect you because\nthere's nothing you can do to control\nother people\nbecause it's not gonna stop and i was\nlike yeah that's right\ni have to change how i think about it\nbecause it's like the only thing i can\ndo\nand um so yeah that's how i handled it\nfor years and years\nso halfway i'm gonna do something a\nlittle bit unorthodox\nso a lot of times when people come on\nstream and they share\npowerful feelings i try to explore those\nfeelings with them\nto sort of help them work through it not\ngonna do that right now\nwe can do it in a little bit okay how do\nyou\nunderstand you used to cry a lot\nright and what i said is that when you\ntell yourself\nlet me just walk you through\nwhat my opinion is okay just so we can\nkind of get to this point\nso you get hate from the internet it\nhurts\nyou this whole emotion that you're\nfeeling started with the question\nwhen did you start or when did you learn\nto tell yourself\nnot to care and when i was explaining i\nsaid that\nwhen you when you invalidate your own\nfeelings what you cause them to do\nis to go dormant so it's a symptomatic\nrelief\nokay it's sort of like saying um\nyou know i can let me just think of a\ngood example so if i've got like\nyou know if i'm sick and i take like\nibuprofen or tylenol or acetaminophen\nit'll make the fever go away but as soon\nas i\nas soon as the tylenol wears off the\nfever comes back\nyeah right and so what we see is you're\nconstantly telling yourself you\nshouldn't feel this way you shouldn't\nfeel this way you shouldn't feel this\nway you're also saying that this is the\nonly thing i knew how to do which is\ncompletely\nunderstandable because it tends to be\nhow our mind reacts to things\nso good for you for finding that inner\nstrength to\ninvalidate yourself for years and years\nand years\nand then you say that it's in the past\nand this is my whole point is that like\nit hasn't solved anything because we can\nask you one question\nand all of those feelings that you've\nburied and swept under the rug\nare like right underneath the surface\nyeah they are they are\ndefinitely there but it doesn't i don't\nhave to deal with it anymore\nso it feels like it's done you know yep\nyeah it certainly feels that way\nbecause you're taking tylenol every day\nbecause you're telling yourself you\nshouldn't care\nbut the reason that you're not at peace\nis because it's still there and it's\nlike\ntrickling up these thoughts of doubt\nright because in your mind\nsomewhere along the way\nso if you tell yourself i shouldn't\nthink this way\nwhat that also means is that there is a\npart of you that does think that way\nyeah does that make sense so there's\nactually a part of you that does\nbelieve that you don't deserve it\nwhich in turn means that since you have\nthat insecurity\nthat's why the things that they say hurt\nso much\nbecause if we look at the nature of\ninsecurity\nyou know people can say a thousand bad\nthings about people\nbut what my mind is going to do is to\nlatch on the one thing\nthat hits where it hurts that's the\n[ __ ] in my armor\nyeah that makes sense right and so like\nyou're continuing they're continually\nlike\ngetting through the [ __ ] in your armor\nand you're continually like healing\nyourself up by telling yourself you\nshouldn't have to\nyou know feel this way and so the other\nsolution\nwhich is you can't figure this [ __ ] out\non your on your own so i think your\nsolution was a good one\nit's the one that most streamers come up\nwith but the more permanent solution is\nto\nfix the [ __ ] in the armor to get to the\nroot of that insecurity\nbecause if you get to the root of the\ninsecurity if like someone says\nif someone starts hating on you for your\nlove of mayonnaise like you're not going\nto give a [ __ ] about that because\nyou're not insecure about your love of\nmayonnaise right like it just bounces\ntheir their hate will just bounce right\noff of you\nand i'm sure you've faced a lot of hate\nin your life but like\na lot of it bounces right off right even\nat the beginning you said that there's a\nsmall portion that like cracks through\npeople can say 99 good things and they\ncan even say 10 bad things and then like\nthe one that really like you're worried\nabout is the one that's gonna get\nthrough\nyeah thoughts about this questions\num i'm trying to think\ni don't fully agree because\ni'm being very honest good i know that\ni'm [ __ ] good at games\nand i know that i deserve all of my\nachievements\nbut it's annoying to have to read on\nevery thread that i do well on\npeople trying to literally\nyou know like leaf through all of my\naccomplishments to try to belittle them\nbut i genuinely think that i deserve my\nachievements\ni would i completely agree so so i don't\nso this is where what's really confusing\nfor a lot of people is that\nour mind doesn't think one way\nright there's a part of your mind i'd\nsay 95\nof your mind if i just had to give you\nodds 95\nof your mind is confident in your\nachievements and you know that their\nhaters are going to hate\nyeah the problem is that five percent of\nyou\nactually believes it which is why you\nhave to tell yourself\nthat you shouldn't feel that way\nso you can believe that you are\nconfident and you deserve\nyour success and at the same time you\ncan believe that you don't deserve it\nwhich is mind-boggling you think you\nthink i really so you think\ni take offense to it because i really at\nthe root of it\ndon't believe i deserve it not at the\nroot\nthat simultaneously you've got two roots\nyou've got a very big tree\nwhich says i do deserve it and right\nnext to it\nyou have a smaller tree which says i\ndon't deserve it\nbut i really do think i deserve it i\nknow you do\ni think i i think if if if the if that i\ndeserve it tree wasn't\nas big and strong as it was you wouldn't\nbe able to make it as a streamer\nwhat i'm saying is that i can ask you a\nrelatively benign question\nwhich is where did you learn how to tell\nyourself i shouldn't\nyou shouldn't like when i asked a\nrelatively benign question\nwe weren't i didn't like walk you to an\nemotional\npoint right like yeah i didn't like i\nwas just like i'm drawing a [ __ ]\npicture on an ipad\nand then i turn it off and i ask you one\nquestion and boom all these emotions\ncome off yeah yeah yeah\nthat tells me that there's something\ndormant there there's emotional energy\nthat's dormant\nand we like kind of like struck gold\nright like just from a mental standpoint\nno i mean i think being a streamer is\nreally taxing i think everyone\nwhose dreams can relate because you\nyou know you hear so many good things\nbut you also hear a lot of bad things\nand like you said some of them do\nget through they do hit some things that\nmake you know\nhit points of insecurity for sure but um\nyeah i mean people handle it in\ndifferent ways i i understand what\nyou're saying but i feel like\ni can't solve can everyone solve all\ntheir insecurities\nwell so the answer to that i believe is\nyes\nreally yep and you're gonna care about\nnothing\nyes what\nsure zero things so zero things that\npeople say to you\naffects you yes\nare you superman dude no so so they they\nhave\nthey have they have a they have a st i\nmean that's been well described right\nso like there's this religion called\nbuddhism\nin this religion called hinduism but the\nbuddhism\nbuddhism okay yeah right and so in\nbuddhism\nthey have a system of training to attain\na state of moksha\nor enlightenment which is a state of\neternal bliss\nwhich is what you're talking about\nand the cool thing is that like if we\nthink about it in your case you're\nsaying\ncan you solve all insecurities you don't\nneed to solve all insecurities hafu\nyou need to solve one insecurity\n[ __ ] the rest of them i mean whatever\nokay okay right so like later in life\nyou may be if you\nyou know choose or lucky or unlucky\nenough\nto have kids however whatever your value\nsystem is\nthen i'm sure you're going to get a\nwhole new crop of insecurities about\nbeing a sufficient mother\nso you'll continue to have them but what\ni'm saying is it seems like there's one\ninsecurity\nthat affects you\neffect isn't the right word that demands\na lot of your cognitive energy\non a relatively regular basis that keeps\nyou from being at peace\nyou have to work at it which i don't\nwant for you\ni want you to just be chill right like i\nwant you to be like\nfree of that and be like have a mind\nthat's like tranquil that doesn't have\nto fight against that\ni understand but it's like fighting\nagainst systematic like\ni i hate talking about but like there's\nsexism right there's like\ndefinitely misogyny on twitch just in\ngaming in general because it's so male\ndominated\nsure and so i feel like i'm fighting\nagainst that which is so ridiculous like\ninstead of fighting against it just to\nbe at peace with it\ndoes that make sense i know i'm not\nfully at peace but that's what it feels\nlike i'm trying to fight\nit's like that's not a war i wanna wage\ni don't wanna like\nbut you fight the battle already yeah\nbut it's just some people you just i\ndon't know\nbecause it affects me that then yeah\nyeah i'm not talking about dealing with\ntoxicity or masculinity or\nmale dominated whatever you say twitch\nhas gotten a lot better what i'm talking\nabout\nwhat i'm talking about is that despite\nthe fact that twitch has gotten a lot\nbetter you carry this thing with you\nit's a chip on your shoulder\nand what i am hypothesizing to you is\nthat there is a\nmethod to get the chip off your shoulder\nand it has nothing to do with fixing the\ninternet\ngo ahead question i think it's a chip\nthat every girl has to\nkind of wear on that's sad\nand if i had my way it is sad but it's\nthe truth and i mean the world isn't\nperfect but it's getting better\nand that's fine and like i mean\nit's a world that i it's a world that i\nchoose to live in right like i'm\nchoosing to be a streamer and i\ni mean my demographic on twitch was 97\nmale until this year and then i have\nlike a 20\nfemale fan base now like it's it's\nbecause of the numbers right like\nyou can't help it when i don't i don't\nagree\nso here's here's what it is yeah sure\nyeah so so so let me let me let me share\nmy\nperspective the world is gonna be what\nit is\nwe can't control the world i completely\nagree if you're a female streamer\nare you gonna have to deal with toxicity\nand hatred due to your\nrace the various fetishes of your\naudience\nand your gender absolutely i completely\nagree with you that you\ncannot fix that i also agree with you\nthat if you are a female streamer\non twitch you are going to have to deal\nwith that yes\ni completely agree can you change that\nactually i'm not going to say you can't\nchange that because\nwith concerted effort as a community we\ncan change that\nbut what i'm saying is that all of that\nis outside of you okay and the outside\nworld\nsends things it's like i want you to\nthink about the barrier of your house\nright and there's a lot of stuff going\non outside and some things from outside\nof your house\nenter into your house yes they cross the\nplain\nof the outside world and into your mind\nand what i'm saying is that a chip you\ncan have so\ni'm trying to help the\ninternet with their mental health it is\na huge problem\nbut it is not a chip on my shoulder it\nis not something that causes me pain\nit is not something that i struggle with\nevery day in fact it does the exact\nopposite it's a buff the weight of the\nproblem that i'm trying to solve\nallows me because of the way i mean now\ni'm gonna sound kind of\nyou know like i'm awesome which okay\nbut because of the way that i've been\ntaught\nto train my mind the weight of the\nchallenges against me\ngives me fuel yeah yeah yeah\nright and i know everyone understands\nthat like i know you've been in that\nsituation where\nyou have dealt with really painful\nchallenging\nin unsolvable circumstances and that's\nwhen you go super saiyan\nand what i'm telling you is that it is\nmy belief and has been my experience\nthat despite the world being the way\nthat it is when it crosses into your\nmind\nbased on the way that you your mind has\nevolved to deal with that\nhas left has allowed you to survive but\nhas cost you peace\nand what i'm saying is that there's a\npossibility that there's a different way\nand that you resist that is wonderful\ni'll i'm gonna try to convince you but\nis great\nwell it's like\nokay i i yeah i think i'm understanding\nwhat you're saying\nbut i don't agree that\nyou're saying that you can control what\ncomes into your barrier right\nis that what you're saying yes what you\nbring in\nand i'm saying that i don't think that's\npossible of course\nof course you i feel like if you try to\ncontrol that too much\ni just that's that's a big battle dude\nyou're damn right it is\ni'm not willing to fight that war\nokay okay so so so that's fair so i\nthink you're right\nactually so you say it may be impossible\nbut what i'm really hearing you saying\nis that sounds\n[ __ ] exhausting and it is very it's\nexhausting\nit's very difficult and it's not\nsay it yeah finish your thoughts not\nworth it\nbecause like\nokay the base example is like let's say\na girl and a guy are playing a\ncompetitive game\nthey both have 20 000 viewers\nwhich streamer do which one of them do\nyou think is better at the game\ni think people always think the guy is\nbetter i i have no idea\nokay i'm just saying this is like the\nit's like it's like an instant\nassumption\nthat the guy is [ __ ] good at the game\nand that's\nwhat that's like an instant bias and\nit's not like a\nvery harmful bias but it also is at the\nsame time\nand that's the kind of thing that i feel\nlike it's not worth fighting against\nbecause\nit's you know biases happen for a reason\nit's not rights but it's just how it is\ni assume that the guy is better and\nthat's [ __ ] up\ni'm just saying there's like a lot of\nthings that are just ingrained\nthat it's just uh you can't change the\nworld\ninst you know like you can't change the\ntwitch world instantly it's because what\nam i talking about changing\nwhat's your understanding of what i'm\ntalking about changing where is the\neffort that we're putting in\nwhat direction is it pointed is it\npointed outside of the house or inside\nthe house\nyeah but i would my stream be inside my\nhouse\nwould my chat be inside my house very\ngood question\nwhat do you think because if it is\nbecause i would say you would consider\nit is because that's the stuff you're\nallowing\nto enter your mind right okay so\nso so yeah so this is exactly so\nyeah okay cool so let me start with this\nyou said this sounds really hard and it\nsounds like it's not worth it and i\ncompletely agree with you so there's a\nreason why very few people\nattain enlightenment and the whole\nreason the\nlittle tidbit from my bio the whole\nreason i became a doctor is because my\nspiritual teachers told me that\nunless you be can become incredibly\nsuccessful in the material world\nthat's like the prologue for like\nplaying the spiritual game\nbecause enlightenment is way harder than\nanything you can achieve and at that\npoint\ni almost failed out of college was had a\n2.2 less than a 2.0 gpa\nand they were like if you can't make it\nin the real world you're not going to\nmake it over here\nand then they told me at the age of 21\ngo back to school\nbecome as accomplished as you can\npossibly be become as successful as you\ncan possibly be in the real world\nand come back when you're 30. and if you\nhaven't made it in the material world\nwe're not interested\nso you're right sorry this is for\nreligion yep i tried to become they can\ndo that\nthey can do this that\ni thought religion was all accepting\nno oh right so so you're right\nyou're okay sorry i know nothing about\nreligion no yeah i don't think it's\nreally religion\ni think hafu you're right that you say\nthis sounds really really hard and it\nsounds like it's not worth it and i'm\ntelling you that your instinct is\ncorrect\nit is cognitively very very exhausting\nit's a lot of work and it's very\ndifficult\nto attain to train your mind to the\npoint where the outside world no longer\naffects you\nbut it's possible\nnow this is where like when we get down\nto it what i'm talking about halfway has\nnothing to do with changing the outside\nworld\nit has to do with putting the chip\ntaking the chip off of your shoulder\nand what i'm saying and this is tricky\nbecause i'm not saying that you don't\ncare\nwhat i'm saying is that it's it's hard\nbecause you just have to feel it to know\nwhat it is\nyou can fight for a cause without that\ncause hurting you\nyou can believe in doing something that\nis good and right and righteous and just\nwithout it hurting you now oftentimes\nthe root to that fight comes from your\nown personal suffering\nwhich is exactly what happened in my\ncase because i was 21 playing too many\nvideo games and\nlike lost and directionless and so\ni have a question sorry i'm thinking\nback about what you're saying\nbecause you were saying how let's say\nsomeone makes fun of my love for\nmayonnaise which i hate mayonnaise by\nthe way but yeah but but something\nthat's so insignificant because you\ndon't give a [ __ ] about it that it\nwouldn't hurt you right\nyep that's what you're saying yep but\nlet's just say like\nsomeone comes in and calls you what's a\nvery tame insult\na dumb ass yeah a noob\ni have no i don't it's just not very\nnice\nlike it's it's just annoying you know\nwhat i mean to read that\nit's not like uh i'm not insecure about\nanything but i wouldn't like that\ndoes that make sense i feel like it\ndoesn't have to be that way just a\nnegative comment is a negative comment\nperiod\neven if it doesn't affect you it's still\nlike what the [ __ ] is wrong with you why\nyou come in here and like be an [ __ ]\nto me\nthat is affecting you no but but\nyou're reacting to it right if it annoys\nyou\nthen it's affecting you\ni'm trying to think i'm trying to think\nokay i'm kind of thinking someone says\nyou're a poo-poo head okay someone says\neveryone comes in and calls you a\npoo-poo head\nam i insecure about being a poopoo hood\nif i just that guy is just trying to be\nmean to me\nis that me being insecure one guy's\nyou know like he's just trying to i\ndon't know i kind of think i'm like the\nmost neutral\ninsult that i feel like i wouldn't\nactually care about but it's still like\nnegative it's\nit's uh obviously negative and meant to\nbe taken in a negative way\nit is someone clearly trying to insult\nyou trying to make you feel bad\neven if it doesn't make you feel bad\nit's just not nice to see\ndoes that make sense sure so i i'm not\nat so i i'm with you\ni think so i think that so it's\ninteresting we're stumbling upon\nsomething that's very very kind of\nuh important but i think we're still\nit's hard for me to jump there so i'm\ngoing to try jumping there and i can\nfill in the gap\nso sometimes i'll try to teach people\nthat detachment\nis different from apathy so what i try\nto do is i'll work with like clients who\nare like\nworking in let's say investment banking\nthis is my favorite most common example\nbecause you see this all the time and\nthey're very ambitious and i tell them\nyou keep suffering because you are\nambitious\nand then they say but if i'm not\nambitious how can i do a good job\nand i tell them you can absolutely do an\neven better job if you give up your\nambition\nand that gets really really confusing\nfor people oh\nright so and and this is where this is\nlike this is the this good i'm\nglad you're pushing back and hopefully i\nwant you to push back as hard as you\npossibly can\nokay don't worry i will fantastic right\nso so let's just think about that for a\nsecond here i am\ntrying to educate you and you're pushing\nback\nwhy am i not getting upset\nbecause you want me to challenge your\nideas so that i understand things better\nyeah but like but why why do i think\nthat way\nright i i'm not a different person could\nsay\noh she doesn't know what she's talking\nabout\ni'm the harvard trained psychiatrist i\ndon't know what i'm talking about\ni mean yeah but why doesn't that piss me\noff\num because it's your prerogative to\nget me to understand so it's great yeah\nso\nquestion no so my point is that like\nthere is an\ninternal way that i receive what you do\nthat changes my perception of like\nsuffering or joy given the same stimulus\nbut i'm not trying to be like offensive\nsure but if i was a narcissistic [ __ ]\ni would take offense anyway\nso my my point is that if you questioned\nme because i mean i've\nworked with people like this i had an\ninteraction with someone like this a\ncouple days ago\nwho like how dare you question me yeah\nyou don't know what the [ __ ] you're\ntalking about i'm a medical doctor and\nyou're not\nright so like like the stimulus from the\noutside is the same\nit's the way that you build your house\nthat allows you to appreciate something\nthat could be like a challenge or\nconfusion or whatever\nor you could interpret as an insult does\nthat make sense\nyes yes\nand so what i'm saying is that like i i\njust wanted to kind of point that out\nand i'll kind of get back to like\ndetachment so essentially the reason\nthat i\nam this way is because i'm not trying to\nconvince you of anything if i was\nattached to convince you of\nof convincing you were teaching you\nsomething i would be frustrated\nbut instead i'm unattached from that and\ni say let's have a conversation with\nhafu\nand let's see where it goes like this\ncould be fun okay she's pushing back\nshe's resistant to this idea\ncool let's play with it and see how we\ncan approach it it's all about the\nattitude\nyes yeah your attitude yes i mean\nthat's kind of what i think what destiny\nwas trying to tell me was like i have to\nchange my attitude towards it\nbut instead of but you're saying it's\nhow to\nchange your attitude instead of just\ntelling yourself that you shouldn't care\nright yeah because i i think extremely\nhard\nyeah so so here's here's i'll i'll just\nbe\nexplicit for a second so i think that\nwhat you have is this ball of undigested\nemotion\nwhich is called a samskar and this is\nwhat happens essentially with trauma is\nlike a good example\nwhere like i use this example with my\nkid where like my kid is scared of dogs\nand so you know if she's walking down\nthe street and she gets bit by a dog one\nday\nthe next day when she sees a dog across\nthe street\nshe freaks out she gets this upwelling\nof emotion\nthat is inappropriate to the actual\nsituation\nyes okay because that emotion is a\nleftover\nfrom like hurt past okay and that some\nscar\nis also what we call an insecurity right\nso if i'm insecure about my appearance\nit's because i got bullied a lot when i\nwas in grade school\nand people called me ugly and so then i\ncarry that emotional hurt with me\nso that when you know when i message\nsomeone on tinder and i'm like hey do\nyou want to hang out sometime\nand they say no my mind fills in the\nreason that they're saying no\nis not because i'm a narcissistic\n[ __ ] it's because i'm\nnot a chad thundercock right yeah\nlike we fill it in based on our past\nemotional hurts and what i'm telling you\nis that it's in my experience\nand i feel pretty confident about this\nyou can digest\nthat emotional energy and once that\nemotional energy has been digested the\ninsecurity is gone\nthis is essentially what happens in\ntherapy\noh yeah i i am skeptical i feel like i\ncannot\nlike um\ni don't know yeah i i understand what\nyou're saying but i'm trying to imagine\nbe getting to the state and just like\nhaving a hundred like a thousand people\ncome in my chat saying you're [ __ ]\nugly and then\nnot caring i'm trying to really imagine\nthat situation\nand i don't see it happening i don't see\nthat happening\nyeah so so of course not right so so now\nnow hafu i think your skepticism is very\nwell founded\nand the simple reason is that sometimes\nit's hard\nwhen we have a wealth of experience that\npoints us one way\nand then some [ __ ] [ __ ] comes\nalong on twitch and tells you that it\ndoesn't have to be that way\nand you've been streaming on twitch for\nhow many years oh\nokay well i'll challenge that one more\ntime okay\nso the reason let's say like something\ni'm not insecure about\nokay i'm blunt right i'm really blunt so\nlet's say\na thousand people come to my chat and\nsay you're so [ __ ] passive aggressive\nwhat is wrong with you\nit would get to me because i'm like oh\nwhat did i do that was passive\naggressive and\nthen i would like really question it and\nyou know but why do you use the term\npassive aggressive\nwhy are you using passive aggressive in\nthis example why do you pick that\nbecause i'm not passive aggressive at\nall i'm just aggressive\ni'm just blunt so like that would be\nsomething i'm not insecure about because\ni'm no\ni'm the very opposite you know so i'm\ntrying to\nthink of like something that they could\nsay that's negative about me that i\ndon't feel insecure about at all but\nstill i would address it because i'd be\nlike\nwait why wouldn't you get that you can\ncontinue to address things so this is\nthe where the detachment and apathy are\ndifferent it doesn't mean that you don't\nact in the world\nit just means that you don't suffer\nbecause of it okay\nyeah okay okay yeah i think i wouldn't\nsuffer for that but\ni think i would suffer a thousand people\ncame and told me i was ugly\nyup because you're probably a little bit\ninsecure about your appearance\nlike most human beings yeah i guess you\ndon't\nfully i don't know right so so now we\ncan even see\nwe can yeah hafu i'm glad you're pushing\nback because i think you're digging\nyourself into a hole\nno no no it's good so i know i think\nit's i think it's very good so so now we\ncan even see\nanother principle of some scars which is\nthat depending on the size\nof the some scar it's like the weakness\nin your armor gets\nweaker and weaker and weaker because in\nterms of like\nyour you deserving it your some scar\nthere is larger\nokay and it's not really that you don't\ndeserve to win the sumscar is actually\nsomething else which we'll get to in\nlater if we ever get there but it has to\ndo i think more with your loneliness and\nyour isolation and you being put back\ninto a place\nwhen you are really hurting because\nthat's the emotion that's the volcanic\neruption that we got for you\nso there's the and the other thing about\nsome scars the tinier the some scar\nthe more comments it's going to take for\nyou to be\nhurt there crack but for you to yeah\nright so there was one comment that like\nand i mean there's a reason why i picked\nthat right so i know which questions to\nask because i've sniffed out your some\nscar\nand then i have to just like lance it\nwith a you know with a pin\nit doesn't take a whole lot and the\nemotion comes rushing out and there are\nother insecurities that you have\nthat it's gonna take like a drill\nto get them okay and it just has to do\nwith the size of the emotional energy\nand let me put it to you this way since\nwe know that they're big sum scars and\nsmall sump scars\nwhat if i told you that you could take a\nbig sumscar and turn it into a small\nsumscar\nif you could feel if you could respond\nwhen people say oh you don't deserve it\nyou would respond to it the way that you\ndo if people tell you you're ugly\nwhich is that it hurts a little bit but\nit doesn't really hurt that much\nwould that be worth it\nthe deserving thing it's not really\ndeserving so\nthat's the thing i'm gonna be honest i\nreally think i deserve things\ni know that's why deserving is a bad is\nit is a bad it's not really deserving\nit's not it's not deserving that's not\nreally what the some scar is if you want\nto get to the sump scar\nmore so thinking back what well the the\npoint at which i cried\nwas thinking about how i used to be so\nscared to collab with people and kind of\nlike have to\ndeal with chat every day because yeah\nyou know so if you want to get really\nprecise it's not deserving\nokay yeah yeah it's not that i like that\ni i know that so\nhere's the reason why deserving brings\nit out because our brain\nscans the external environment and tells\nus when to bring\nsome scar to the surface and what's\nhappening is when people\nso like my daughter who's been\ntraumatized by a dog if she walks\nif she sees a cat across the street the\nsome scar doesn't trigger\nso the only thing it's not the i know\nyou deserve it i've\nsort of gleaned that but i think what\nhappens is those\ndiscussions yeah remind your mind\nof a time when you felt a particular way\nso that's like the trigger\nit looks like a dog and then those\nemotions which really have nothing to do\nwith deserving because you've built up\nother some stars over the last decade\nbut that emotional energy\nis is still there definitely no i don't\nknow i think yeah i think you've hit the\ni yeah you're right\ni have internalized a lot of it because\nthat was the best way i knew how\nto add time yeah and\num it definitely still is there\nbut it has gotten better to the point\nwhere i don't\nit used to be stuff i would think about\non the daily like\nit would eat eat at me every day\nconstantly\nnow i don't think about it almost ever\nand uh yeah like i said i used to have\nmonthly cries like\nit was like clockwork because you know\nyou have to bottle up somewhere and then\nat one point it's just overwhelming\nand then boom cry it out and then just\nlike start sucking up again or sucking\nyeah yeah just like um\nignoring it ignoring it up again yeah\nsucking it up again\nand important two letters there yeah\nand now i know i don't have that like in\nthe last year two years\ni haven't had that at all i haven't\ncried\nbecause of something like that in over\ntwo years\nso it feels better now but when i think\nabout that time\nyeah it was just so bad and\num i don't know it feels like because it\ndoesn't happen anymore i don't have to\ndeal with it sure it's been swept under\nthe rug\nyeah but it's like uh you know it's like\nneatly packed\nnow yeah and dormant yep\nit's a nice little volcano that has yeah\nit's dormant it's just\nyeah so so this is where you know hafu\nyou've got to make a choice\nokay and so if you want to let it lie\ndormant you can let it lie dormant the\nrest of your life\nand then depending on whether you\nbelieve the the hindus\nwould this disagree about this it'll\ncarry with you to the next life\num and you know\nit's a kind of material but in my\nexperience\nand take this for what you will\ni'm not pushing you i don't think you\nneed to fix this because i think you're\nan incredibly strong resilient woman who\nhas learned how to\nyou know adapt to your circumstances\nlearned how to be successful\nlearned how to find happiness you're not\nthat girl who bottles everything up and\ncries once a month anymore you've like\ngrown into something truly awesome with\nyou\nand at some point you have to decide\nwhether you want to just let this stuff\ngo\ncompletely whether you want to open up\nthe rug\nbecause you're right you packaged it\nvery neatly\nand then get rid of it and i suspect\nit's going to be far\neasier than you think it is because when\nyou open it\nyou think i think i know a little bag of\ntrauma that i just\ndon't want to look at yeah it's a very\ntraumatic time in my life yep so let me\nexplain to you\nlet me explain to you why i think it'll\nbe easier than you think\nit is because you're when you\nrate its difficulty right so you're pro\nwow streamers so like\nyou wiped on that mob when you were 17\nyou're not you're not level 17 anymore\nyou're level 29\nyou're not the same person who faced\nthose problems you're a completely\ndifferent person\nyou're stronger you're more resilient\nyou're more confident you have the\nsupport of a loving fiance you have the\nsupport of a loving community\nso you're like partying up and zoning\ninto like\nwhat's that [ __ ] low-level instance\ni quit wow 10 years ago dude i don't\nanyway\ni won my tournaments when i was 17. i'm\n29.\nyeah so so so what i'm saying is that\nhafu i think the reason that it'll be\neasier to deal with than you think about\nis because\nyour your assessment of the challenge\nrating of this problem\nwas made when you are way lower level\nthan you are now\nyeah i don't think so\ni feel like this is not something i can\ntackle\ni'll be honest i'm thinking about it i\ndon't think it's something i can get\nover\nyeah so i think that's reasonable\nbecause i'm thinking something i have to\nget over yeah\ni agree with i understand what you're\nsaying\ni'm not gonna push you but um i think\nthat\nit's reasonable to think that you're not\ngonna be able to go over it because you\nhaven't done it yet\nright if you go into a raid boss and you\nwipe 10 times\nand then i ask you can you down the boss\nyou're gonna be like ah\nyeah not really so i think that a lot of\nyour resistance is completely\nunderstandable because i do think you're\nsomeone who relies a lot on your own\nexperience\ni'd say that you you tend to not have\nfaith in other people's opinions\nno it's not that i don't have faith in\nyour opinion\ni don't i don't consider it a bad thing\ni think it's part of probably part of\nwhat's made you successful\nas successful as you are because you\nrely so heavily\non your own judgment yes right you've\ncome to trust yourself\nand because the world told you something\njust think about this for a second\nthe world has been telling you something\nand you had to learn\nhow to not trust what they're saying\nand so of course you wouldn't trust me\nbecause you've learned how to not\ntrust what other people say you're like\ni need to do it until i\nsee it taste it and eat it for myself i\ndon't think so\nyeah now whether that\nis a part of your interpersonal conflict\nwe can you know\n[Laughter]\nno i agree but even when you were\npassive aggressive you were still quite\nrigid in your thinking you just didn't\nlet people know\nthis is it's part of your temperament\na lot of things\nyeah i was just able to cycle analyze\nmyself and kind of\npick apart it's like well\nfor example like with my ex i would\nalways try to like test him to see if he\nreally loved me\nand like kind of like pick a fight and\nstuff and then i noticed i was doing\nthat and i\nstopped and i would catch myself doing\nit it's really hard to like look at\nyou know bad parts of yourself\nbut i was actually because of games i\nwas able to do that\nand um\nyeah i don't know i'm much happier with\nwho i am now than i was\nlike a decade ago and it wasn't like an\novernight thing is like addressing one\nproblem at a time\nkind of being like why the [ __ ] am i\ndoing this thing like when i think about\nit from a logical standpoint\nlike it makes no sense and then i can\naddress it from there\nbut yeah it's not like an overnight it\nwasn't like an overnight realization\nyeah so how i'm just confused now\nbecause you seem to be making a really\nreally great argument for what i'm\nsaying\nbecause that's what i'm encouraging you\nto do so awareness\nof a some scar is what leads to its\nemotional digestion\nand the change does take time it is\neffortful and you end up way happier at\nthe end of it\nand if you do that enough times and you\nget really good at that process of\npsychoanalyzing yourself\nnoticing what you do and altering it\nif you do that over and over and over\nand over and over again at some point\nyou\nlevel up in your skill at doing that\nokay but let's okay let's break down one\nof them\nokay example i don't think i'm ugly\nbut i don't think i'm like the most\nattractive person ever right\nso i'm not insecure about my looks but i\ndon't love my looks you know i don't\nthink i'm like\nyou know you know like i think at one\npoint you have to just accept who you\nare\nit's like do i want to get plastic\nsurgery or\nam i okay with who i am right like those\nare your options you can like\ntry to change how you look so you really\nlike how you look or you can accept it\nright those are your options\ndegree yeah so i've gone with the\nacceptance route where i'm okay with how\ni look\nbut it doesn't mean that i that i feels\ngreat about how i look right\nsure so how am i supposed to not how am\ni supposed to get over if\npeople come in and tell me i'm ugly this\nis a dumb one but like how am i supposed\nto just\ndisregard those comments forever if i\nhave to just settle with\ni'm okay with it but i don't you know\nwell because because so\nany sense yeah it makes a lot of sense\nbut like so but\ni feel like yeah so that makes perfect\nsense because the whole point\nis that you know you have a small sum\nscar there\nand so then you're saying how do i learn\nto be okay with the some scar because\nyou haven't fully accepted the way that\nyou look\nbecause you're unhappy fully no i'm not\nsuper unhappy this is like\ni'm not so it's a tiny yeah but you're\nnot super unhappy with it which also\nmeans that you're a little bit unhappy\nwith it\nyes yes i'm definitely a little unhappy\nwith how it looked but i feel like it's\nnot a real insecurity\nyeah because it's not a real insecurity\nit's a baby insecurity\nbut then but then that sun scar how do i\nget that sunscreen to go away\nyou continue working on it right so so\nthis is where i can show you how to work\non a sump scar\nokay so for that one how would how could\nwe tackle what are you unhappy about\nwith your appearance\nhate this so much\nsee there it is there's the subscriber\nyou see that right beneath the surface\nright beneath the surface it's not as\nsmall as you think it is hapu\ni mean\nno no i know what i don't like about\nmyself but i don't want to like\ngo through all these little things but\nthere are okay there it is no no no no\nyou don't get to get away with that\nyou said i know what i don't like about\nmyself but i don't want to not like that\nthere it is there's the [ __ ] you\nremember the diagram where you're\ninvalidating the way that you feel\nthe invalidation i wish my pores were\nsmaller\ni wish my boobs were a little bigger i\nwish my nose was a little smaller\ni wish my eyes were a little bigger i\nwish i had more fuller eyebrows\nnaturally i wish i wish\nmy skin was less oily i wish\nmy butt was bigger i'm working on that\ni'm going to the gym\nhow does it feel to say that it's fine\ni'm okay saying all this stuff\nand that's the thing it's like i'm okay\nsaying it's just weird\nto say this stuff because i actually am\nokay\nstop talking for a second how do you\nfeel what do you notice in yourself\nwhat are you feeling right now slightly\nembarrassed that i have to\ngo through all the flaws yeah right so\nthat's the some scar\nbecause if you were truly like if i said\ni'm fine with my hair\ni have big pores too i kind of wish my\ndick was bigger\ni'm skinny fat i have dad bod like\nyou know i could list the things that i\nknow that are not\ngood about my appearance and i don't\nreally give a [ __ ]\nlike i truly i mean i have a little\ninsecurity there too because i can feel\nthat embarrassment\nabout some of those things and not other\nthings\nso you do have some insecurities sure\ni'm not [ __ ] you\nyeah but i never said i was enlightened\nyes you did you just told me what are\nyou talking about i said you have no\ninsecurities here like yeah i have no\ninsecurities no no i didn't say\ni have no clip it and ship it he [ __ ]\nsaid it\nbefore before i didn't say i have no\nidea\nis it possible no i'm not enlightened\nhafu\ni'm a [ __ ] twitch noob oh\ni thought i swear you said you have no\none i think you're not insecure about\nanything you're like yeah\nnothing that chad could say could it\naffect me that's what oh i thought oh\nno no oh yeah yeah so so you didn't say\nthat\nno i mean i i i say that i really don't\nget affected by chat that's true\nbut if any but you just admitted to\nhaving some\ninsecurities about how you look so if\nsomeone in chat said\none of those things it wouldn't affect\nyou hasn't yet\nor much really yeah\nthat doesn't make sense it i know it's\nconfusing because until you experience\nit\nuntil you experience it hafu you're not\ngoing to understand i mean like it's\njust\nmy experience right so part of what i do\nso this is kind of weird\nbut you can fix an insecurity or what\nyou can do is accept that you're\ninsecure\nwhich then keep makes it gives you\ndetachment from it\nyes i have i feel like i've accepted\nmy insecurities on the way i look\nbecause i feel like\nno no no i'm talking about something\nelse so you can accept your in\nwell no maybe not hold on\nbecause um i mean so i just settled\ni'm just done with that stuff oh yeah\nsee there you go\nthat's kind of that's kind of where it\nis it feels better yeah\nyeah yeah yeah yeah so i i mean i don't\nthink i don't think and i certainly hope\ni've never made this claim or people\nhaven't gotten this impression that i'm\nenlightened i'm not\nperfect i've just trained a lot and i do\ntend to think that i experience\nless suffering than the average person i\nbelieve that\nright so like generally speaking like\neven when things don't go well for me\nlike sometimes i'll get upset\nof course like i noticed that i was\nactually way more\nsort of spiritually adept until i had\nkids and then i noticed all kinds of\nlike attachments arising for a while\ni tried to fight them for a while and\nthen actually what i realized is that\nyou know what i'm just gonna be attached\nto my kids\nand that's okay and i sort of let go or\naccepted the fact that i was going to be\nattached and i would never become\nenlightened so i sort of was like\nokay\nnot going to be able to do that anymore\nbut anyway i apologize if i gave you the\nimpression that i was\nperfect in in because i'm really i\nreally\ni just remember when i asked you i was\nlike wait you have no insecurities and\nyou're like no\ni'm sorry you said that i'm pretty sure\ni didn't say i had no insecurities\nbut maybe i misspoke\ni mean this is being streamed on twitch\nso people can go back and yeah i know\npeople are saying you did say it people\nsaid he did say it\nhe's gaslighting you okay so he did i\nremember that you're not crazy\nso uh okay i misspoke that's what no no\nno you're all good\nno that's consider me checkmated no no\nit's all good um because i was like\nbasically\ni think things like that like you're\nright i'm not perfectly happy with how i\nlook but is that is that necessarily a\nbad thing i feel like that's not\nthat's like a human thing yeah sure but\nthat's why you know enlightenment is not\nhuman\nokay so so is it do a lot of people\nsuffer with it is it\nacceptable absolutely but i think that\nyou know i personally believe that you\nshould strive for as much happiness as\nyou can in this life\nyes and that's true i have a lot of\nhappiness\nyeah so and i'm trying to get\nso let me let me just say so when you\nowned your insecurities and you felt\nthat embarrassment that some scar\ngot a little bit smaller\nyeah definitely i mean i was so insecure\nwith how i looked when i was younger\nto the point where i remember vividly\nlike\nmy my high school boyfriend came over\nunannounced\ni didn't have makeup on and had glasses\ni got lasik\num i glasses i had no makeup on and he\nrung the doorbell and i opened it and i\nslammed it in his face because i thought\nhe was gonna break up with me as soon as\nhe saw me\nbecause no one could ever love me how i\nwas like that's i remember having that\nexact thought\nand then he actually helped a lot\nbecause after he was like what you\nlooked fine\nand i was like huh so that helped a lot\nit's like a very vivid memory\num yeah it sounds like you've grown\nimmensely halfway\nyeah i think i have i think i'm a really\nlogical person and i\ntreat my self and my own problems the\nway i treat games\nand like i said i [ __ ] deserve my\ngaming success because i'm [ __ ] good\nat them\nbut um um\nokay i mean going back to like\nwhen i when i was saying like the\nsystematic thing like\ni don't know i always bring this example\nup because it's a very\njarring one that i think people can\nunderstand uh so when i was 17 i was a\npro owl player and there was a team that\nqualified on the tournament realm\ncalled gonna rape hafu at regionals\nand they qualified and nothing was done\nabout their team name\nand you know that was kind of the\nattitude of the gaming culture at the\ntime\nand so like when you look at that\nhow are you supposed to just\nbe okay with that\nso let me ask you something as you share\nthis story\ndo you s so like as we've talked about\nparticular subjects there have been\nlittle volcanoes or big volcanoes that\nhave erupted\nright do you notice any eruption\nas you share this story a tiny one\nquiver here yeah yep so so when you say\nokay so like let me ask you this if we\nlook at the size of the story\nand the size of what you're talking\nabout in the outside world that is\ngigantic right\nit's huge that's [ __ ] insane\nit's unjust it's terrible why is there\nnot\na volcanic eruption in you because\nthings have gotten better and people are\nmore aware of\nthis kind of attitude and it used to be\nkind of like\nthe attitude back then was it's expected\nof you to just suck it up\nlike why are you even complaining that\nkind of thing it was like a very\nnormalized\nand so that's what i did okay so so\nno one ever spoke up against it and like\nincluding myself or my teammates or\nanyone at blizzard you know so what i'm\nhearing what i'm hearing is that the\nworld has changed and that's why\nthis story doesn't hurt more to tell\nit's\ngetting better it gives me hope i didn't\nhave hope back then\nand i have hope that things will\ncontinuously get better\nokay so is hope inside the house or\noutside the house\nit's inside i think okay so your\nquestion was how are you supposed to be\nokay with it right\nyeah yeah i think like how are you so if\nsomeone goes through that like\nhow are you supposed to be like that\nshouldn't affect you right no no\nhold on yeah but i think we you have the\nanswer i don't actually have the answer\nyou have the answer so let's just map\nthis out so you're saying\nhow are you supposed to be okay with it\nand my my answer to your question\nis how are you so okay with it\nbecause remember that's a gigantic thing\noutside of your house\nbut you having lived through that do not\nhave a volcanic eruption\nyou are relatively speaking at peace\nwith it you're relatively speaking you\nhave\nhope the inside of your house is good\ndespite something so god-awful\nhappening on the outside of the world so\nhow can you have such a gigantic\nterrible thing as going to a pro\ntournament and having\na team name that is denigr like\ndenigrating offensive\nand threatening to you and you're just\nsitting here on stream talking about it\num\nbecause when it's ancient too like like\ni said i think\num i think the gaming\ncommunity as a whole has grown a lot\nsince then\nand just the industry has grown a lot\nsince then and i yeah so i think the\nreason you're okay with it has\nnothing to do with that really yes\nyou're leaving one important person out\nin terms of growth and change\ngaming industry that's not going to do\nanything to your suffering\nwhat are you doing i'm part of the\ngaming industry and it makes\nit gives me hope that you know like i\nthink in another 10 20 years like it's\njust gradually getting better this is\nfrom a decade more than a day so i think\nhope is reasonable but i still think you\nasked me the question\nhow are you supposed to be okay with it\nand i think the same\nhow are you okay with it i think it's\nbecause you've grown as a person\nbecause you've developed hope hope is\ninside the house\nthat's how you got to be okay with it so\nmy whole point here hafu is that\nthere's a line between the outside world\nand the inside world and you're saying\nhow are you supposed to be okay on the\ninside of your house when\nthe capitol building is on fire in\nwashington dc\nand that has to do with you how the [ __ ]\nare you not so traumatized\nthat you quit twitch entirely or quit\npro gaming\nforever when there was a team that\nshowed up in the regional qualifiers\nthat's name was we're gonna rape you how\nare you able to do that i don't think\ntwitch gets credit for that\ni don't think the gaming community gets\ncredit for that i think you get credit\nfor it\ni mean like i said there's no other\noption\nthe option is to like\ni still choose to be here i still choose\nto be in this world\nthat's how you do it yeah that's the\nonly way\nit's like you can't do anything because\nthese things exist\nthey happen and it's like\nthe only way is to accept like to you\nknow to to be okay with it\nthat's the only way or else i would have\nhad to quit\nright like that what else could i do\nthat's what i'm saying so you're saying\nthat you\nlike like you're asking how are you\nlearning to be okay with it i think you\ngot\nhalfway there right like you grew as a\nperson like my i feel like\ni don't know if it sounds to me like\nyou're arguing with me but i feel like\nwe're both saying the same damn thing\nmaybe like i because i everything you're\nsaying\ndoesn't feel to me like it's a point\nagainst what i'm saying i feel like it's\na point\nto support what i'm saying because if\nyou really look at it analytically\na huge stressor from the outside should\ncorrelate\nwith a large emotional response on the\ninside but if we look at you\nscientifically what we see\nis there are gigantic stressors on the\noutside that lead to tiny little\neruptions\nlike a slight quiver in your throat and\nthey're relatively benign questions like\nwhen did you\nlearn how to say you shouldn't do that\nto yourself that lead to huge emotional\neruptions\nergo minor stressors lead to large\nthings on the inside\nand big stressors lead to small things\non the inside therefore we\nthis is one instance right this is one\ninstance and i don't have to think about\nit every day whereas the other thing is\nsomething to do with like chat which i\nhad to deal with on a daily basis\num so that some scar like\nsnowballed like crazy so that's i think\nthat's why it's like a similar vein but\nit's not like\ni had that happen to me every day this\nis one instance\nthat happened and the other one is like\non a daily every single day\ni'm experiencing this well whether a mob\non stream or off stream\nso what i take away what i take away\nfrom that is the size of the stressors\ni'm misnaming\nright so like there's getting there's\ngetting bitten by a lion\nonce in your life and then there's get\ngetting bit by a dog every [ __ ] day\none yeah the dog is going to be far more\ntraumatized absolutely yes\nso i think that's why yeah well no so so\ni still think though that\ni see what you're saying and so i\nconcede that point if we're arguing\nsomething\nbut i still think that that doesn't have\nto be an argument\nwhat i still think is fundamental here\nis that\nthere is some amount of something you\ncan do when something crosses the\nthreshold between the outside world and\nyour house\nyes and when you ask how are you okay\nwith it you have to study\nthat thing right so like i don't get to\nchoose what life throws my way\nbut i get to choose how i react to it\nyes\nthat's how you learn to be okay with it\nright it's these issues of acceptance\nbecause\nlike think about 17 year old you and how\naccepting you were of your appearance\nand think about 29 year old you and how\naccepting you are of your appearance\ni don't think the outside world and in\nthis case the outside world\nyour body has changed drastically\nbetween 17 and 29\nokay right but you your attitude\ntowards it you have become more okay\njust imagine talking to 17 year old you\nand how confused 17 year old if you told\n17 year old you if you went back in time\nand you told 17 17 year old you was like\ni'm ugly like no one can ever see me\nlike this and you said\nactually you're gonna be like relatively\nokay with your appearance you're never\ngonna look perfect\nbut you're gonna feel confident in the\nway you look and then 17 year old you\nwould ask you the same\n[ __ ] question you're asking me yeah\nthat makes sense\nso you're saying i have to tackle it in\nthe same way so think about why is it\naffecting me so much\nand like um your thing is these things\ni'm not\ni'm not except i don't think i can get\nmy mind to accept those things\nsure well but i think it's like a fair\nthing to accept\nyeah okay so so it's not only to do what\nyou've done so far because i think what\nyou've done so far is\nquite amazing but there are other\nmethods that you just haven't learned\nyet\nright so you've managed to increase your\nacceptance from 17 to 29 about your\nappearance\nso you've learned to be okay with\nsomething that you one day thought\nyou would never be okay with without\nsomething outside of your house changing\nmy point is that the change happens on\nthe inside doesn't happen on the outside\nas far as i know you didn't get plastic\nsurgery i mean maybe you did not\nhave to answer it you don't like the\nmatter so so just just for clear\nclarity like nothing has objectively\nchanged but you have changed\nand all i'm saying to you is that even\nwhen it comes to your insecurity about\nwhatever the [ __ ]\nit is i i mean we can dig into it if you\nwant to\nthat too can change you can come to\naccept it and you can feel\nmore peace like you do now about your\nappearance compared to where you were 17\nyears ago\nthat's the process of growth yes\nhmm\ni'm trying to think and i'm still kind\nof fighting just\npush i know i know you're just push\njust push okay\nso you think that because i have\nnot like a vlog eruption but just\nbecause\ni get annoyed by certain comments that\nthose comments actually affects me\ninto okay so\na comment like\nwhat annoys me i don't want to say it\nbecause then they're gonna say it\nsee there's the some scar right you see\nthat well\nyes have you seen twitch chat you tell\nthem not to do something what are they\ngonna do they're gonna do it\nchad no one spam kappa no one spam it\nand now let's spam it what bothers you\nhafu\nif i turn out to be right what bothers\nyou about that why do you have trouble\nit doesn't bother me i think more so\nlike no it doesn't bother me\nit's more so like i'm trying to\nokay i'm trying to think of something\num\ni can't think of something but let's say\nsomeone is just\nsomeone is just hate watching and just\nvery negative actually it's really cool\non twitch you can look at someone's chat\nmessages right and sometimes you see\nsomeone i\nlike i see something in chat and\nsometimes i'm annoyed i've lost a game\nright\ni've lost the game i'm in a bad state of\nmind because i'm salty\nand i see something criticizing the way\ni play\nand i click his messages and i scroll\nthrough\nand every single out of the 200 messages\nthey've wrote\nis negative in one way or another every\nsingle message is meant to tear me down\nam i justified i'm being annoyed\njustified absolutely or but it's\nbut you're suggesting the best way to\ndeal with it is to be\nat home you're saying it's two different\nthings right\nbro hold on a second this is where the\nmoney is okay\nwhy do you click on their name well i\nwant to see if i'm\nbeing why unreasonable because if\nthey're just a normal person\nyou want to see if you're being\nunreasonable what's going on in your\nmind at that moment\nmaybe i'm being a salty [ __ ] i have to\nsee if it's you know me being salty or\nnot\nno it's not you being salty the reason\nyou look\nis because maybe they're right\nyeah cause you're sad i'm sorry that's\nthe [ __ ]\n[Laughter]\nso this is really important okay this is\nreally really important\nwhy do we go fishing for things that\nhurt us right i'll give you an example\nso like let's say i get dumped by my\ngirlfriend i'm feeling bad about myself\nyou said you're feeling salty and then\nwhat do i go\ndo when i'm feeling bad about myself at\ntwo in the morning after being\ndumped i got dumped a month ago i log on\nto instagram or facebook or whatever\nand i go look at pictures i see one\npicture of my\nex with another dude and then i click on\nit and i look at all the pictures\nand i just torture myself i go looking\nfor that hurt\nwhy the [ __ ] do we do that as human\nbeings\ni don't know that's a good question\nthat's relatable absolutely because\nthat's what you're doing on twitch chat\nwell i need to feel justified when i ban\ntheir ass you know what i'm saying\nyeah you need to feel all kinds of you\nneed to feel\nvalidated when you click on that you\nfeel\nvalidated right and i'll tell you so for\nthe the dude who looks at picture of his\npictures of his girlfriend he tells\nhimself i'm a good person\nbut inside he feels unlovable and every\nsingle picture that he looks at of\nanother human like\nanother dude with his girlfriend he's\nlike [ __ ]\ni knew i was unlovable i knew i was\nunlovable i knew i was unlovable\nit's validating that's why we torture\nourselves\nbecause it's not telling yourself\nbecause here's the option right like so\nin that moment when i see my\nex-girlfriend with another dude\ni tell myself oh there are other fish in\nthe sea\nyou should let her go man it's no big\ndeal you're a good looking guy and\nyou're like [ __ ] you\nthat's invalidating i'm gonna go and\ntorture myself because it's how i feel\nand i want the world to see how i feel i\ndon't want to be alone with those\nfeelings anymore\nokay even if it hurts sure\nso you're saying every time i get\nannoyed at a comment it's my\ninsecurities\nthat they have said something that i\nthink\nis true is that true though let's say\nsomeone calls me\nokay let's just say someone comes in and\nsays something racist to me\nokay and i get annoyed and i\nban them is that an insecurity thing\ni don't think so could be\nso so there's a there's an extreme so\nthere's an extreme way to take this hafu\nand there's a practical way to take this\nyeah yeah i'm just trying to understand\nbecause i'm trying to think i've been a\nlot of people\nlet me let me let me let me try to share\nwith you a couple of things because i i\nthink the more philosophical and\ntheoretical this gets i think the less\nuseful it is\nokay so you can play that game if you\nwant to but here's what i would tell you\nokay i think that you are an awesome\nperson it's clear to me you've grown a\nlot i don't really know who you were\nback then but you clearly\ncome across as someone who is confident\nin yourself and has grown immensely and\nhas suffered\nyou have the mark of past suffering on\nyou yes\ni see that very clearly you've gotten to\nwhere you are\nyou seem happy you're engaged things are\nfantastic you sort of talk about being\nblunt and maybe some\nother people think you should change\nthat and you tell yourself maybe you\nshould change that but you're actually\ncompletely fine with being blunt i am\ntrying to think i know i can tell\nso like but there's that part of you\nthat's but like you see that too is like\nwhere you say oh maybe i shouldn't be\nthat way but you're actually really\nvalidating and accepting of yourself\nthere even though\nthat's contrary to the should but that's\nanother separate point i'm with you\nso right so now here's what i'm\nproposing to you it's something for you\nto pick up and play with if you want to\nokay\ndespite all of your growth despite all\nof this stuff\nyou're not perfectly happy no right no\none is ever perfectly happy\nunless you're enlightened yep there you\ngo okay\nso so here's what i perceive in you\nis that there is still a some scar that\nis actually quite big\nwhich doesn't get triggered very much\nbecause you don't see many dogs on the\nstreet anymore\nokay but you're still carrying it around\nyes and in my experience just like you\nwere carrying a lot\naround a lot of insecurity when you were\n17 you're not carrying that [ __ ] around\nanymore\nand it feels good it lets you be happy\nand you say but this isn't that big of a\ndeal because it doesn't affect me every\nday i get that\nbut i'm telling you hafu generally\nspeaking the closer you get to the top\nthe harder it is to rise\nit's just like climbing mount everest\nit's just like the wow ladder\nyou can take whatever it's a universal\nprinciple of life\ni agree and so what i'm offering you\nby offering i mean i'm proposing a\nhypothesis that i think you would be\nhappier\nand maybe this is what you're running up\nagainst i think you would be happier if\nyou let this go too\nthat you shouldn't walk around shouldn't\n[ __ ]\nthat that there is a possibility to walk\naround without the chip on your shoulder\nyes and how would you start trying to\nclear that slump scar\nso i think we you feel the emotions in\nthe present is the short answer\nright so i didn't do this with you today\nbecause i had a feeling this would be\nway more fun and i'm glad that we've had\nthis discussion\nbut like basically when you had started\ncrying if i'd asked you more questions\nabout it\nwhat we would have done is lift up the\nrug and start sweeping stuff out\nright we would like we would validate\nyou we would get you to listen and you\nwould feel like\nyou'd start processing those emotions\nyou'd start digesting it\nbecause when we sit with an emotion is\nwhen we digest it\nand this is the difference because like\nwhen you were 17 and someone said\nsomething hurtful about your appearance\none comment would be so overwhelming\nyou'd distract yourself from it you'd\nsweep it under the rug whatever\nand it would hurt you whereas now what\nhappens is someone says something dude\nthey're continual insults people are\nattacking you all the time\nbut as you grow up and as your buddhi\nwhich is a part of your mind that helps\nyou digest emotions\ngrows more robust you can process things\nfor yourself so that they never become\nsome scars\nso when my five-year-old gets bit by a\ndog she's like terrified of dogs and she\nhas a phobia of dogs when i get bit by a\ndog\ni'm like [ __ ] that was still really\nscary the first second of the emotion is\nexactly the same\nbut then i walk myself through it i hold\nmy hand and i say wow i'll look like\nthat was dumb\nlike are you okay like oh [ __ ] that was\nscary maybe you should be more careful\nnext time but i'm like or and then that\nit doesn't form a some scar but if what\ni tell myself afterwards how are you so\n[ __ ] stupid like what's wrong with\nyou you dumbass\nthat'll form a sum scar you see that\nemotional digestion evoking the feelings\nand sitting with them\nwhen you use the term psychoanalyze i\nthink what you did is work\nthrough stuff you didn't analyze it you\nworked through it there's a big\ndifference\nthat's true you felt those feelings you\nsat with those feelings and you were\nyour own therapist\nso all you have to do is just evoke them\nand this is where\ni know we've been at this for a while\nand you say i don't want to\nlike what i'm really getting from you is\nnot an illogical resistance and i\ngenuinely think you're open-minded and\ntrying to understand\nwhat i'm getting from you is i don't\nwanna\nyeah that's true part of it is i really\ndon't want to because\nyep and that's not logical right because\nso you can ask me as many questions\nabout scenarios as you want to that\nresistance is going to be there\nyeah can ask whatever you want to you\ncan checkmate as much\nme as much as you want i can checkmate\nyou as much as i want to\nit's not going to get anywhere because\nhafu you don't want to\nthat's cool every time\nwe ban emotionally because they've\ntriggered a sumscar\ni don't you say ban emotionally\nyeah yeah i'm just saying it like let's\nsay someone comes in and says something\nthat triggers your sunscreen we ban them\ni don't think so so i think we ban\npeople\nfor reasons that are not emotional right\nokay so like action and some scars are\ndifferent like you can act without a\nsome scar\nbeing active in your mind you can ban\nsomeone because\nyou can like it doesn't hurt you but\nyou're like this fucker's gotta get\nbanned\ntrue there's a certain like chillness to\nit right that is detachment that is\nvairagya yeah you're right you're right\nyou're right if someone says something\nracist\ni don't personally get effect affected\nby it like it doesn't\nexactly feel like that's an attack feel\nanything i don't feel like and yet\nyou're like they have your motivation to\nact is still very strong\nand that this is where people get\nconfused because they think that's true\nhow can you be motivated to act and\nstill be detached because\nmost of us get motivated by our [ __ ]\nsub scars\nand what i'm telling you is that's what\nleads to a train wreck of a life\nokay yeah that makes sense\nso whenever i find myself getting\ntriggered the right word yep absolutely\nokay\nwhenever i find myself getting triggered\ni need to break down why i feel\ntriggered\nsure everything yeah or or you can you\nknow get someone to help you with that\nbecause like for example like there's a\nlike so let me ask you something hafu\ni mean i don't think we have time to get\ninto this because i can't keep doing\nthis i'm running out mp at this point\nokay\nbut why don't you want to\nscary there it is\nyeah i mean i know i know i don't want\nto so we can you can ask me as many\nquestions you want to it's not going to\nget anywhere\nso it should be more like every time i\nhave an emotional response\nthen i should figure out why i'm getting\nthat emotional response\ni so you said every time i have\nemotional response i should figure out\nwhy i'm getting that response i disagree\ni'd say do it once a week\nlet yourself live the other six days of\nthe week\nokay yeah\nthat makes sense i will keep that in\nmind\nthat it's the thing yeah yeah so\njust to give you an example if i wanted\nto get you\nto want to the next question i would ask\nwould be what are you scared of\nright because there's a some scar\nthere's something you're afraid of\nthat's a fear that's\na that's something that's coming up and\nthen we would work through why you don't\nwant to\nand as we emotionally digest that then\nyou'll be okay doing the next one\nwell part of it is we're doing this live\non stream\nyeah a lot of the trauma is from stream\nyep it's from chat so you want me to\ntalk through something\nyou want to give the ammo to the thing\nthat traumatized me in the first place\nso that is why i'm scared of it\nyou know okay like sure uh i've like for\nthe longest time\ni would stay in my own bubble on twitch\ni won\na global evo many years ago i chose not\nto ever cash it in\nbecause i would be scared that if i did\ndo\na picture of myself then it would be\nused in a negative way\nlike that kind of thing right i would\nvery much stick to my own\nbubble it was only in the last two years\nthat i have felt comfortable collabing\nwith other people\nand felt comfortable\nare you hearing me say that i want to\nget\ninto that with you yeah oh no\nyes or no well you're saying that no i'm\nsaying i don't want\nokay okay right because i'm explaining\nwhy because i feel like i know why i\ndon't want to\ndo it i understand i've there's a reason\nwhy i didn't push when the sum scar came\nup right so like for whatever reason\ni felt really really a lot of resistance\nfrom you\nto explore emotionally so we've just let\nthat [ __ ] slide like that's okay\nokay i'm just sharing with you\nintellectually\nhow that would look yes okay\nright a lot of what you have said mate\nhas made a lot of sense and\nuh it is pretty enlightening like the um\nlike certain comments affects me in\nin a different way even if it's negative\nso that's what i didn't understand but\nnow i do\nlike someone calling me a poopoo head i\nmight not like it but it's not gonna\nlike\nmake me i don't know good\nso so now this is very cool because\nyou've stumbled upon another\nhalfway you're brilliant okay so you've\nstumbled upon another really important\nprinciple\nwhich is pain and pleasure is outside of\nthe axis\nof suffering and contentment\nwhat sorry that went over my head so\nyou can still continue to feel pain and\npleasure if you are detached\noh okay so pain and pleasure are not on\nthe same axis\nas attachment and detachment so you can\nstill\nfeel angry you can still get upset about\nstuff but\nyou don't suffer it's kind of hard to\ndescribe but like you said\nthere are two things that can annoy you\nbut the quality of the annoyance is\ndifferent yes\nyes right one is deeper and one shot\nlike a surface level yep so so what\nwhat the yogis realize is that there's\nactually two things they're not the same\none is on the axis of pain and pleasure\nwhich you can never get\nfree of that's always going to happen\nand then the second\nis the axis of attachment and detachment\nor suffering in contentment\nyou know so like i'd say that if i have\nto go get a covid test and someone\nsticks a swab\nlike all the way up into my cranium\npainful yes it's painful\nbut i'm not going to suffer it's like\nyes\nso i think you've stumbled upon that i\nthink you're very it's impressive\nhow nuanced you are with understanding\nyour own experiences\nand so i think you're more i mean you're\nnot wrong about really anything you've\nsaid today\ni just think that there's like another\nstep yeah\ndefinitely cool\nquestions um\n[Music]\nno i think i i understand your point i\nthink i\nthe thing i was resistant about that i\nwas challenging about\ni think i understand a lot better um\njust that you can you're allowed to be\nannoyed and you're allowed to act on\nthings but it's\ndifferent than suffering and suffering\nis like when you internalize it\nright it's like this um\ncan i ask you when you became less\nresistant\nmean during this conversation yeah oh i\njust didn't understand the concept\nbecause before i was like\nbut there are people who are just out\nthere to be rude to you\nwho exist to be rude and i thought that\nyour argument was that it doesn't matter\nlike you should uh\nlike i now i understand that you're\nsaying ban their ass they're being dumb\nand it's okay to ban them without\nactually suffering from it\nwhen in the course of the conversation\ndid you become more accepting of what i\nwas saying\nit wasn't that i'm being accepting it's\nmore of like understanding what you're\nsaying\nwhen did you understand what i was\nsaying\nvery recently i think was it before or\nafter\nwe talked about your resistance after\nokay so i was resisting because i\ngenuinely didn't understand and now that\ni've understood it it's\ndifferent and now i can so there's a\nthere's there's a differential diagnosis\nthere\nwhich is that genuine understanding\nbecame more possible\nonce your resistance lowered\nyeah that's fine so so what i would\neven i'm not sure but\ni would say that there's a decent\npossibility that\nprocessing your resistance even for a\nfew minutes because i was bouncing off\nright\ni was saying the same [ __ ] for an hour\nand a half and it kept bouncing off\nyeah and now suddenly you're like oh\nlike now i understand what you're like\nwhat the\nwhat the eighth time was a charm\ni didn't understand it i'm not gonna\njust accept what you say i never i i\nknow i\nknow i know i know you're not but but\nwhat i'm saying is that i like i think\nit's a really good illustration\nof how understanding and resistance are\ntied\nand when we address the resistance\nexplicitly and sort of talk about that\nand notice that\nthen the understanding comes more easily\nyes\ni agree okay i'm not sure but you know\nmaybe\ni i do agree i do agree i think it's i\nwas very skeptical\nskeptical about what you're saying so\ni'd keep challenging it instead of\ntrying to just\nunderstand it and then when i started\njust trying to understand it i could\nunderstand it\nokay so you're right you're right that's\nnot what i'm saying but i think it's no\nno no i\nknow i know i know but i'm just saying\nthat you're right that like as soon as\ni stopped just trying to yeah\nrefute your points yep so so that too is\nthat inside the house or outside the\nhouse\ninside the house yep\na lot of stuff is inside the house hafu\nyeah\nokay do you meditate\nno want to learn how to meditate\nisn't it about thinking about nothing\nit's more like\nwhat is it what's that what's the app\nthere's an app with the british guy\ni don't know meditation app anyway\nheadspace there we go see they knew\nheadspace\nand it's like you think you think about\nyour breathing and you think about like\noh it's like in yoga they do this but\nyou think about like\nwhere your body is like where your foot\nwhat your foot is experiencing and\nyou like focus on that stuff i can't\nmeditate i've tried it\ni know that it's very good but the way\nthat i fall asleep now is i put on\naudible\nand then i focus on that and then that\nputs me to sleep in 10 minutes\nbecause then instead of like thinking\nabout my problems or\nanxieties in the day i think about\nsomething that has nothing to do with me\nand then i fall asleep so it's kind of\nlike meditation i think\nin a way okay so you shared a lot thank\nyou very much you didn't answer my\nquestion\noh i didn't no i don't think i know how\nto actually meditate\nthat's not what i asked i asked do you\nwant to meditate\noh sorry i said do you know how to\nmeditate\nunless maybe maybe i said do you know\nhow to meditate\nmaybe we can go back i was maybe i\nmisspoke there too\noh but here's my question do you\nwant to meditate today now\nokay i'm down\ni'll ask again i think you answered at\nthat time but i want an honest answer do\nyou want to meditate\nuh not particularly but i don't i know\ni'm not against it\nso instead of saying sure because yeah\nyep okay so let's think about that okay\nokay so if you don't want to\nwhat are we gonna do we don't have to\noh i don't care i'm down for whatever\ni'm trying to be as open as possible\nam i open or am i hard to work with be\nhonest\noh\ni would say you're easy to work with and\nyou're closed\noh okay interesting i don't think you're\nvery open\nreally no no\nhuh that's the first time i've heard\nthat\ni've always seen myself as super open\nbut i'm rigid that's interesting\ni like that that's something that i\ndidn't know about myself\nright i thought it was super open\ni think you come across as open but like\nso you're open\nyou're open with your manner you're open\nwith your dialogue\nbut you're closed in your mind like\nyou're like a [ __ ]\nso they're like like people aren't gonna\npeople aren't gonna tell you you're\nwrong why not\nright like you [ __ ] know what you're\ntalking about\ni encourage people to tell me when they\nthink i'm wrong\nyeah i know and i'm open to admitting\nwhen i'm wrong when i think i'm actually\nwrong\nyep when but so this is the thing but i\ndo have to think i'm wrong yes\nyeah there see so let's let's just look\nat like relationship dynamics for a\nmoment right so like this is going to\ncause problems because like\nsometimes your partner potentially could\nthink that you're wrong and if you don't\nagree with them\nit's going to cause problems but they\nhave their own perspective\ndavid and i he's the same way if he\ndoesn't think he's wrong he also won't\nback down\nso we've had that once so what i what i\nreally think about closeness is like\nwhat real openness is is acknowledging\nthat even if you don't think you're\nwrong\nthat you could be wrong\nright because you're not gonna be right\nall the time anyway that's neither here\nnor there i think i'm still deciding\nabout so you know sniffing a fair amount\nof resistance off of you about\nmeditation\nwhether it's a good idea to try to teach\nyou or not\noh right because i will be open to it\nokay okay so then let's teach you\nsomething\nnow the question is what to teach you\ni'm bridgette trying to think\ni don't think that necessarily because i\ndon't agree with something that i think\ni'm\nright it's just i also don't think i'm\nwrong\nlike i i know so logically i know that\ncycle\nlike so i think open and closed\nis like too unsophisticated of language\nhere's what i'd say about you i'd say\nfrom a five factor personality\nassessment\ni would imagine you to be a high\nopenness low agreeableness\nokay that's fine right so i think you're\nopen to new experiences you're\nexploratory and you're willing to hear\npeople out\nbut you're not really flexible with your\nopinions\ntakes a lot to change your mind yeah\nthere's like other people that are like\noh cool like\ni'll go whichever way the wind is\nblowing and hoffw's like uh-uh\nyeah i yes that is\nthat's that's good right so that's open\nand closed is like unsophisticated high\nopenness low agreeableness\nyeah i'm the same way for what it's\nworth yeah it's very accurate\npeople think i'm really really open but\ni'm really [ __ ] judgmental in here\noh that's one thing that i really liked\nabout myself\nthat i changed well i really didn't like\nhow judgmental i was\nand my inside the voice in my head\nwas so judgmental and so like mean\nand then i would filter those mean\nthoughts like why am i thinking this way\nwhy am i judging this way\nand i would always challenge myself and\nnow my thoughts are very pleasant\nuntil i'm pmsing and then i turn to the\ndevil\nsounds about right that's the only time\nwhere my thoughts are rude\nmy thoughts are very nice they're very\npleasant because i i cut out all the\nmean thoughts\nbut then hormones are a [ __ ] like what\nare you gonna do and that's not my fault\nyeah that's not my fault so it's\nyeah so let's think about meditation so\nnow i'm curious about what am i going to\nteach you\nah i've got a good one okay okay so we\nhaven't done this in a little while but\nso\nso there are two kinds a lot of\ndifferent ways to slice up meditation\nso what i'm going to do hafu is give you\na meditation technique\nit may work for you may not work for you\nno big deal but\nwhen people say you know i'm not good at\nmeditating it generally means that\nthey just haven't been given the right\nkind of technique for their mind\nokay so you're someone who's like sort\nof skeptical\ndoesn't want to be told anything you\nneed to figure things out for yourself\nand you're also very like introspective\nso i'm going to give you like\nokay we're going to give you\n[Music]\nwhat i would call an investigative\ntechnique so what we're going to do and\nby the way i think listening to audible\nis like a good example of meditation i\nthink you're actually\na born meditator you just have to be\ndoing it\nyou have to be given the right kind of\ntechnique for your cognitive\nstyle when you close your eyes and sit\nup straight\ntwitch chat can do it too okay back\nshould be straight neck should be\nstraight\nand i want you to take a breath through\nyour nose\nbreathe in and out\nand tell me where do you feel the breath\nmean like\nmy own breath or yep like where is it\ncoming from inside or outside\neither i mean i can feel my breath on my\nhands\nokay and i can feel it going in and out\nof my chest\nokay so what does it feel like in your\nchest\nnothing okay can you feel something\nthere\nnot really other than my lungs expanding\nokay so that's something\nright so you can feel your lungs\nexpanding so you feel a sensation there\nnow let me ask you something do you feel\nthe breath do you feel\nonly your lungs expanding or do you also\nfeel the breath\ni feel my bra tightening once i inhale\nbecause right\nokay so i want you to pay attention to\nyour nose\nokay is there breath there\nyeah i can feel it like through my\nnostrils okay\ncoming out and now i want you to follow\nit see where it goes as you breathe in\nto my sinuses okay keep following see\nwhere it goes\nfollow it investigate\nand then it goes in through my nostrils\nto my sinus and then it goes\nthrough my nostrils to my hands\nthat's that's that right help me\nunderstand when you say it goes through\nyour sinuses\ninto your hands well\ni can feel it because my nose is here\nand my hands are\nin my life okay so so what i'm talking\nabout is feeling the sensation on the\ninside\nso what i'm hearing you say is the\nexhalation you can feel on your hands\nokay is that correct yes\nbut follow the inhalation\npay attention to your throat okay\ncan you feel the breath in your throat\nmy throat expands\ndo you feel the expansion or do you feel\nthe same quality that you feel in your\nnose and your sinuses\nwhat do you mean quality so so you're\ndescribing musculature\nwhen you say my chest is expanding my\nthroat is expanding\nbut i would imagine that the feeling\nin your throat of expansion in your\nphysical body\nis different from what you feel in your\nsinuses\nis it\nokay so\nfollow head up straight okay\nnow follow the breath into your throat\nand see if you can differentiate between\nthe musculature of the throat\nand the sensation that you feel in your\nsinuses going back into your throat\ni don't understand okay\nso so i think you\nyou're doing it fine by the way so okay\nso you notice a sensation of breath you\nmay notice the temperature of the breath\nwhat is the temperature of the breath\nwhere do you feel the coldness in your\nbody when you breathe in\nhow far does it go it goes to my sinuses\nit's like almost uncomfortable\nokay so you don't feel coldness in your\nthroat\nokay that's fine so\nwhen you are doing this so i want you to\nfocus on your sinuses for a second you\nsay it feels uncomfortable right so\nfocus on that sensation of discomfort\nit's like i ate too much wasabi okay\nokay so now i'm going to give you\na separate practice i want you to catch\nthe moment\nwhen inhalation becomes exhalation\nwhat about that moment have you found it\ntell me about it\nit's like at the top of okay\njust everything stops for a sec okay\nso are you holding your breath\nyes for like a split\ngood so normally when you breathe in and\nyou breathe out you don't hold your\nbreath right\nso i want you to stop holding your\nbreath and find the moment in between\ninhalation and exhalation\nwhat am i looking for just find the\nmoment between\nin inhalation and exhalation\nwithout holding your breath\ni know i found it so what am i looking\nokay so if you can find it without\nholding your breath i want you to sit\nin that space\nwhat\nwhat do you mean sit in this okay\nthis is helpful let me think for a\nsecond\nyou can open your eyes\nwhat oh just uh\ni don't know close my eyes for a while\ndoes the world look different yeah but\nthat's normal\nright i don't know does that usually\nhappen when you close your eyes\nno it feels like everything's a lot more\nclear\nmaybe you just meditated\nso it's meditation is\nthinking about\nless right kind of like decluttering\nyour mind\nno no so it's not thinking at all\nso focus and thought are two different\nthings\nmeditation is focused to the exclusion\nof thought\nwhich is something you figured out with\naudible because you focus the attention\nof your mind on an audio book\nand then your mind shuts down and you\nfall asleep\nyes so what i i actually don't think\nthese are the right techniques for you i\nthink there are other techniques that\nare going to be better\nbut i think you did a good job and you\ncan continue to use these techniques\nso my thought was that if i tell you to\ndo\ni have to give your mind something\nbecause like i don't know how to\nput this but when i tell you to find the\nin between space\nall of your attention is zoomed in\non one thing and you're not thinking\nabout anything\nyou're like listening right so like all\nof your attention is like\nconcentrated into a point yes it's like\nfocusing on the experience yep\nand so there's no thought there yeah\nthe thought was actually interrupting\nyou because you were like am i doing it\nright\nthat's yeah yeah yeah right so the more\nthat you got away from that\nso i i would just so sometimes for\npeople\nlike you what i recommend is meditation\nthat is a question\ninstead of a practice so\ni'm going to tell you for example that\nyour breath\ntravels further than your sinuses in\nyour nose\nright and if you focus on it you can\nfeel it in your throat\nthat cool sensation that feels almost\npainful\nwhich what the [ __ ] got there different\nday\nbut you know who knew that breathing\nclearly was painful\num and and so if you follow that\ncoldness it'll go into your throat and\nif you follow it\nsee where it goes because i think for\nsomeone who's inquisitive and doesn't\ntake like if i tell you to\nyou know do something you're gonna be\nlike what the [ __ ] am i doing this for\nyeah right so so i have to give you\nsomething that's going to engage your\nmind and keep you curious\noddly enough i think that your mind is\nactually very concrete so when i ask you\nabstract questions like sit in between\nthe space between\ninhalation and exhalation i know this\nsounds weird some people understand what\nthe [ __ ] i'm talking about but you're\nlike what is that\ni don't know you know which is totally\nfine so so\nyou know if i give a chance if i get a\nchance to teach you a different\ntechnique of meditation i'm going to\nhave to\nadapt for that and and do something very\ngood but i didn't need to say\naudible it's kind of like meditation yep\nit is because what you're doing is\nyou're focusing your mind it's a dharma\nyeah\nyeah it's it's nice yep but i i\ni don't know if you i don't know if\naudible will give you the clarity of\nvision\nand the crystal clearness of the world\nafterward\nyeah who cares i'm asleep that's great\nit's going to put you to sleep\ni should be right to sleep so if you do\nthese kinds of techniques i would say\nyou know try to explore and see what the\n[ __ ] i mean\nwhen i say sit in the space between\ninhalation and exhalation\nwithout holding your breath and if you\nspend a few minutes\ndoing that a couple times a day you can\nalternate between the two because i\nimagine you're going to get bored of one\nquickly\nwhy is meditation good\nuh because it gives us time outside of\nour mind\nwhy do we need that because our mind is\nthe source of our suffering\noh okay that's fair\nsee sometimes ask super challenging like\noh like\nwhat is the purpose of that it's\nactually pretty simple for rigid\nconcrete people like us it's like that\nsimple\nyeah if you tell them because tell me\nwhy don't you go like watch some\nyoutube lecture on youtube video and the\nlike\nand they'll you ask why should we\nmeditate some guy's gonna give you some\n[ __ ] profound answer about\nyeah inner peace and it's like that's\nhow they make money you need the video\nto be at least 10 minutes\nno yeah it's just very simple spend time\noutside of your mind because the mind is\nthe origin of all of your suffering\ncool cool\num questions or thoughts before you wrap\nup\nno this is good this is good i called\nthat i was gonna cry\ni did cry but i feel good and um\nthank you for challenging me thank you\nfor challenging me\ni found that i'm rigid\nthat's not new to you though it is\nreally well frigid isn't the term i\nwould use for myself\nbut now you're right not agreeable yep\nyep but i don't think it's more it's not\ni don't think it's necessarily a bad\nthing it's not\ni don't think it's a bad thing at all\nyeah\nokay well thanks a lot hafu thank you\nthank you so much for having me i'm glad\nwe finally got to do this\nyeah likewise and good luck with\neverything hopefully this has helped in\nsome way but\num you know if you have questions and\nstuff down the road feel free to hit me\nup okay\nokay all right take care bye-bye thank\nyou\n[Music]\nwhat are we who are we rating\noh we want to write both of these nuts\nray joe mama"
