    "transcript": "i feel like i've been abducted by aliens\nand they're about to aimly probe me\nyou know what i'm talking about yeah\nthat sweater feels like i've come to\nyour house and you're ready like you've\nopened your mind up to me\nit seems like we're we're on a more\nhuman you know\nlevel rather than like an objective\nspecimen level does that make sense\nyeah i'm glad you feel that way\ntrain and i had to arrange for our\nwhat what are you what are you drinking\nman that sounded satisfying holy [ __ ]\nyou know\nuh you know so you know i'm persian\nyeah and a lot of iranians a lot of\npersians they say\nearl grey tea is the closest thing to\npersian tea but i actually disagree\ni think english breakfast is so this is\nenglish breakfast\nyeah i don't think earl grey reminds me\nof you know persian tea i don't know if\ni've really had persian tea but i've had\nyou know tea from the mena region\nand i i mean earl grey is like there's\nnot there isn't hint of\ni i'd agree i'd say english breakfast\nbut earl grey is like\nthe bergamot is like or bergamot or\nhowever you pronounce it\nit doesn't seem to be there yeah there\nis like a\nthey taste similar but there's like a\ndistinct difference in earl green for\nsome reason earl grey gives me a\nstomachache\nit's really weird yeah maybe maybe the\nthe citrus oils or whatever\nyeah yeah it's probably something like\nthat i just don't like that little\naftertaste either so\nyeah english breakfast is the way to go\nhow have you been\ngood man um staying busy\nbut good cool good good good um\na lot of my patients are really\nstruggling right now so i've been\na little bit busier i'm sorry yeah\ncovet's hard on people's mental health\nit is we didn't we didn't quite realize\nyeah kovit's been uh yeah\ndefinitely uh causing me some anxiety\njust like uh like\ni feel like visiting my parents i'm\nstuck in this uh\ni'm stuck in this like i'm just like\nfilled with anxiety\nand stress because i want to go see my\nparents really bad i miss them you know\ni love them\nand you know they want me to come real\nbadly too and\ni understand there's like you know\ninstant tests this and that but even\njust\neven a 0.01 chance of me somehow\ncatching it\nand giving it to them i just would never\nforgive myself but on the other hand\nif i keep pushing it back and this never\nends\nyou know who knows what happens you know\nlife comes at you fast so\ni just i don't know a decision to make\ndoes that make sense\nyeah of course man um and are your are\nyour parents like\nare they in the u.s is it okay i mean\nyeah it docks you or anything but just\nno you're good\nno no they're in arizona okay so you'd\nhave to fly to see them\nyeah i would i mean i could drive but\nthat always freaks my mom out and it\ngives her a lot of she just hates\nyou know she doesn't want me driving\nlong distances so it's a long way man\nyeah 14 hours that is a long time so i'd\nhave to i'd have to stop some more which\ndefeats the entire purpose of driving\nyeah yeah that sounds sounds really\ntricky i think a lot of people are\nstruggling to figure out what the right\nthing to do is\nyeah um you know fingers crossed\nhopefully a vaccine is around the corner\nand\nand we'll have uh you know we'll finally\nget some control over coved yeah\ndefinitely\nknock on wood yeah nothing\nover um yeah so train is there something\nin particular that you wanted to talk\nabout today or\num\nhmm\ni mean you know to be frank\ni just you know i miss your company\ncool man i enjoy talking to you you know\nit's not often i get to talk to uh\nyou know somebody like you and you know\nwe get to bounce back\nyou know bounce our ideas back and forth\nyou know and uh\ni don't get much of that depth uh you\nknow around these parts of twitch people\nare usually more\nyou know you kind of get what you see\nand and what do you end up getting from\nother people\njust surface level that's it i'm not\nsure if that's\nuh you know the end i doubt that is but\ni don't think very many people like to\nopen up on twitch um with each other at\nleast right maybe with you yes\nbut with each other i think it's more\nsurface level stuff i think everyone's\nalways playing uh\nyou know there's always a politics to\nplay you know people don't want to give\ntheir vulnerability vulnerabilities\nright because they could be used as a\nweapon against them which i don't blame\nthem that's kind of just the world we\nlive in\nyeah so it's unfortunate isn't it it is\nand and what do you um\ni'm happy to answer these questions that\ni'm about to ask you\nas well but what do you appreciate about\nour conversations\num for the most part\ni appreciate the\num unbiasedness i appreciate the like\nobjectivity to it i appreciate\num you know\nuh you know don't get me wrong i live a\nvery fortunate life\nyou know i'm in a very fortunate place\nespecially during covet you know i have\nan amazing job make a lot of money\num but definitely\ni think it's always an uphill battle\nwhen it comes to\npeople's first impressions of me right\nwith you\neven if you may have felt anything\nnegative\nabout me i feel like you had the wisdom\nto put it aside and you know actually\ntalk to me and give me a chance that way\nso that's what i enjoy\ni mean uh train just thinking a little\nbit i think you've faced a lot of\njudgment bro\na lot of judgment\nyeah some of it\njustified some of it not but\ndon't we all though i think we all do to\na certain degree\ni mean so you're saying a couple of\nthings that um\nmaybe can be kind of a threat of this\ndiscussion you sort of say you're\nfortunate\nalmost like a disclaimer yeah i wanted\nto\nyeah i wanted to make that clear because\nfor some reason uh so like\non usually i'd leave that out but\non like obviously you know\ni don't want to say as a public figure\nit just sounds very weird but like as a\npublic figure i guess\nfor some reason if you're successful\nand have money then you don't have a\nright to\nyou know cry about how you feel because\nyou're better than 99\nyou know you better often the 99 percent\nthat don't have money that think money\nsolves everything\nwould trade all of their troubles to\njust have money right but they don't\nrealize once they get it they'll realize\nthat\nyou know that there's no amount of money\nthat would ever solve or fix\nthe troubles within does that make sense\nyeah so i i i that is a disclaimer\nbecause it seems like that's what people\nlatch on to right oh the big old you\nknow streamer that's living in the one\npercent he's sad\noh big deal right so i just kind of i\nsaid as a disclaimer just to avoid like\n20 minutes of talk yeah i i hear that\nand what i'm kind of curious about is\nlike what is it like to not\nallowed to be sad\ni don't know hey\ni don't i mean i don't mean to uh\nfor this it's not that deep for me like\ni think people i think the people that\nyou know care for me\nthey don't do that and the people that\nkind are just there there's kind of\ntrash talking i just trash talking back\nit's like that simple i i don't really\nscurry away into my corner and say oh\nthis is [ __ ] up i just say yo\nyou know suck my dick\ndoes that make sense yeah yeah so it's\nnot like that deep yeah yeah\nlet let me let me just make sure i got\nyou so so\non the one hand you kind of acknowledge\nthat you are lucky and fortunate in a\nlot of ways\num some of the people that i've worked\nwith i i i've had\nthe opportunity to work with really all\nwalks of\nlife um anywhere from working in a\nprison to working with\num you know successful startup\nceos and and one of the things is\nsometimes like sometimes they do get\njudged very harshly and it can be really\nhard\nto not be allowed to suffer but what i'm\nhearing from you is that you actually do\nhave a pretty\nlike you do feel like you are allowed to\nbe sad like you don't necessarily have\nto do it in public\nand there's sort of the public persona\nwhere you don't have to like cry me a\nriver\nkind of thing but that you know if you\nhave authentic feelings you have people\nto share them with and it's not too big\nat all\nfor sure yeah yeah 100 for sure\nthere's definitely a lot there's a lot\nof the good you know\nthe good viewers it's taking me a long\ntime to realize that don't get me wrong\nyou know\nthree four years to realize that you\nknow i used to focus on the negative i\nthink this was just like six seven\nmonths ago\ni was just focused on all the negative\nand i kind of was ignoring the\npositive and i realized that i was kind\nof reinforcing and perpetuating\nyou know the negative because that was\nthe only way they got attention and now\ni see all the positive and there's a lot\nof positive there really is some days\ni think the negative you know goes\noverboard but i think\nmost days it's a lot of positive\ncomments and a lot of supporters so\ni do think i what's up can you tell me a\nlittle bit about the positive\nyeah i think they started focusing on\nthe positive like what kind of\num i think i think\nmy favorite thing that i've discovered\nover the last two three months\nis there are people watching that\nthey have the social intelligence to\nrecognize when i might not\nfeel you know worthy or i may not feel\nlike\ni'm worth something to myself and they\nreach out on twitter or instagram or\nyou know in a whisper and they say hey\nyou saved my life or you changed my life\nor without you i'd be going through this\nand that\nand you know they send those messages\npretty much you know\non on on point when i'm feeling down so\ni think i think there's a lot of\nsupporters that are watching and they\nhave a pretty good idea they kind of\nread me\nbecause of how long they've watched me\nso that's kind of what i mean does that\nmake sense\nyeah it makes a lot of sense yeah so so\nit's interesting because\nyou know what i'm if you really listen\nto those words what um\nwhat it almost sounds like is they're\nthanking you but\nwhat i'm hearing from you is that\nthey're actually helping you it's not\njust an expression of gratitude that\nthey recognize that maybe you're feeling\na particular way and that like\nyou know they recognize that you may\nneed a little bit of tlc\nand so they're giving a little bit back\ni think they're actually\nwhat i think they're doing is which is\nactually kind of beautiful in a way is\nthey're letting me know that\nthat i have a purpose\nright like in their own way they're\ntrying to let let me know that\ni play a role in their happiness or in\ntheir life\nright so like i think it's actually way\ndeeper and more beautiful than that to\nbe honest\num but yeah i think yeah just that\ni i've noticed that recently for a long\ntime i just kind of focused on the hate\nand\nyou know don't get me wrong i still go\nin and you know do my thing but\nfor the most part i've recognized a lot\nof the lurkers you know coming out and\nyou know talking to me let me know what\npeople hate you fortune\num\nwell that that that little laugh right\nthere you hear that\nyeah there's a lot like i can recognize\na little bit of\ncockiness to that laugh kind of like a\nhere we go right\ni think that's what it is does that make\nsense\nsure they hate you because\nyou have a cocky response to their\ncomplaints\nor is it the cockiness itself no\ni'm not it's not that no no no so i\nthink\ni think it's okay so most people that\nso here's what i've noticed from a lot\nof like new viewers a lot of the new\nviewers that i get\nthey all uh you know as soon as any kind\nof bullying talk comes up they go yo\nyou're the bully\nright and then we always show my high\nschool photo when they always start\nlaughing and saying holy [ __ ]\nright so i think people uh you know\nthey look at this and they think that\nlike i've always been here\nconfidence wise not realizing that\nright i'm here because i recognized my\ninsecurities you know i went through my\nperiods of insecurity i\nstill have my insecurities right so i\nthink it's more so the thing where\nthere's like a general stereotype for\nmale gamers or male personalities or\nmale larger\ncreators to have some sort of flaw\nwhich don't be wrong i have many of\nthose you know i mean look at me\nyou know i look like a gorilla which i\nlike to be honest i like it right but\nanyways\nget back to the point i think\nthere needs to be i feel like okay now\ni could be totally wrong here but i\nreally feel like\nnot everybody but the vote the most\nvocal viewers\ni think they need\na a streamer\nor someone they watch to have something\nthat makes them feel better\nbut i feel like my personality and the\nway i go about things no matter\nwhat insults are thrown at me i\nhold the certain composure\nthat they need\nto disappear like they need me to like\nfall in order\ni can't explain like sure maybe i can\nhelp you out in a second but just keep\ngoing\nwhat i'm trying to say is right so if\nyou notice a lot of the successful\nstreamers they either make fun of\nthemselves whether it's\npurposefully or accidentally right like\nit's either just the\nindirect or like passive thing they have\nor they're quirky and they're not\nrealizing it or\nit's like a purposeful like you know\ndegrading themselves in order\nyou know for people to be able to laugh\nand appreciate them right\nbut if you don't have that or do that i\nthink there is\nsome sort of i don't know i've noticed\nthis throughout\nuh twitch like does that make sense i\ndon't know if that makes any sense\nactually\nyeah i don't know i think it makes a lot\nof sense so train\nyou know a couple of things that i'm\nremembering one is that\nyou'll frequently mention that you feel\nlike you're you don't make sense\nwell i know i make sense\nto me the problem is\nsometimes i give these like\nanecdotal examples that\nmay not fully you know\nuh\nclear experience it might not exactly\nwell yeah\nyeah does that make sense so yeah i\nthink there it is again\n[Laughter]\nyeah so so let's let me see if i um\nunderstood you so you then you tell me\nif this is you know\nand then we'll see if it made sense or\nnot i thought it makes sense yeah so\nlike\nyou know i think a lot of times so if we\nlet's talk about ego for a second okay\nsure so our ego i i generally think of\nour ego as a defensive mechanism that\nprotects us from feeling bad\nso you know if you call me stupid then\n[ __ ] you you're stupid\nthat's what my ego does right it sort of\nlike rises up\nand then it puts other people down so\nusually the way that the ego helps us\nfeel better about ourselves is it kind\nof pumps us up\nor it puts other people down and then\nthe interesting thing is that like if\nyou think about putting\nother people down\nthere's uh you gain more value\nthe bigger the person is so if i'm\nfeeling bad about myself\nand then i go if i take a\ntree and i i\nplay against a tree in overwatch\nand i win against a plant i don't feel\nany sense of satisfaction\nright because like if i like if i play\nchess against my three-year-old\nand i crush her it's like my ego is not\ngonna get anything from that\nand so the the bigger someone is the\nmore we gain\nfrom like putting them down right\nand i think we see a colossal amount of\nhate towards public figures\nand i think sometimes they do things\nthat you know genuinely\nspeaking or kind of out of line and\nstuff like that but i i think generally\nspeaking i don't think that the\namount of toxicity that public figures\nget\nget is proportional to like how bad they\nare\nbecause generally speaking i think that\nlike most people are about\nin the ballpark of the same amount of\ngood and bad and it's not true\nyou know so it's just one person just\nhappens to be public\nbut i i have noticed this thing where a\nlot of people and you'll see this a lot\nlike i was trying to understand why\npeople make hate videos\nyeah you know like when a lot of people\nmake hate videos and like\nlike i sort of understand that there's a\npopulation that likes\neasy to monetize and a lot of people\nwatch them and stuff and the question is\nlike why do people\nwhy do people like watching hate videos\nwhy do\npeople like watching attack videos for\npublic figures\nand i think probably because it makes\nthem feel better about themselves i'd\nreally love to talk to someone who like\nmakes these\nhate videos one day like you know one of\nthese hate farmers and\nkind of ask them what motivates you to\nmake the video that the videos that you\nmake\nis it just no no i think\ni think it's a little deeper than that i\nthink\nthey truly believe they're doing a\npublic service\nright you can't see\nso from your perspective when you see\nyou know someone make a mistake\nright or someone do something from your\nperspective you can kind of be like okay\nyou know\nit's it's [ __ ] up but you know we've\nall realized that we've all done that\nright\nsome people i think they're they\ngenuinely believe\nthey're like doing like some like god's\nright hand work like they truly believe\nthis person is this way\nthey need to come out with the truth and\nlet people know let them you know beware\nright so i think it's more of like an\nignorance or like not an ignorance it's\nlike a delusion or it's like some sort\nof\nit's like some sort of like i don't know\nwhat you'd call it but that's what i\nthink it is\ni don't think it's this thing where\nthey're thinking like how can i i mean\nmaybe half of it is how can i get big\noff of this i don't think it's this\nthing about monetization necessarily i\nactually think there that there's\ncertain people like\nyou know you know not large creators\nlike just the small\nyou know maybe viewers that are creating\nor clipping things to try and\nuh you know i think i think there's like\na\ni don't know it's a god complex or some\nsort of complex where they believe\nthey're doing like\nsociety the good they're the good person\nthey're outing the bad does that make\nsense\nyeah yeah why would you call that\ndelusional\nbecause not always but\ni think from most of what i see\ni mean i shouldn't say most but from\nsome of what i see\ni think\nanyone that had the wisdom or any anyone\nthat was wise\ncould kind of step back and like okay\nthere's a lot missing here\nso i think for these individuals the\nreason i say delusional for some of them\ni think they fill in their own gaps\nto portray so like i don't think they're\nneces so i think a lot of the time at\nleast in my experience\ni don't think they're telling the full\nstory they're telling the story that\nthey\nneed to be true in order for their ego\nto be saved\nright this person needs to be this way\nthey need to be this way right\nthis isn't just a one-time thing oh\nwe've done this they've done this no\nthis is\ntruly evil and terrible and let me let\nme let you let me tell you how right\ni think that's what it is does that make\nany sense yeah i i mean i think\nrighteousness is a good word i think you\nused it earlier yeah\nnow this is some right some others\nobviously it's fine but\nyeah yeah i mean what i'm hearing you\nsay is that they're\nyou know their internal compass is that\nlike the reason that they make such hate\nvideos is to actually make the world a\nbetter place\nit's almost like they protect people\nyeah i feel like it's closer to that\nyeah yeah i mean they're sort of they're\nkind of\nprotectors of the innocent yeah the\nthe internet masses yeah protecting them\nfrom\nyou know these sociopathic influencers\nstreamers\nyoutubers whatever yeah\nyeah yeah so you know i'm curious\nyou know i i i think i think what you're\nsaying has a lot of merit and at the end\nof the day\num you know it's been my overwhelming\nexperience that\nyou can come up with a theory that's as\nbrilliant as as you want it to be but\nuntil you actually talk to the person\nand really listen to what they have to\nsay you'll\nyou won't really know you know yeah\num and one of the things i was kind of\nthinking about train so i think\nlast time when we wrapped up um\nmy recollection was that like you know\nwe were talking a little bit about this\nicon that people\nturn you into and to a certain degree\nyou like\nbear that mantle like you're okay\nbearing it but that actually\nyou know because sometimes people need\nsomeone to hate and and you're like yeah\nokay fine i can handle that\num but that actually it does on some\nlevel like make you angry that the way\nthat people treat you\ni don't know if we're back there if it's\nbeen too long or whatever but that was\nsort of my recollection of our last\nconversation\nyes that's right that's on point that's\ndefinitely what we\nleft off at i know the cure for it\ni know that like i know what i need to\ndo\ni think sometimes i just uh don't even\ntell you\nwhat the problem is first how would you\ndescribe the problem before we get to\nthe\ncure well i think the problem is so for\nexample\num it's very weird because\num and this only happens with like\nfirst-time viewers right\nmy core community they'll [ __ ] around\nthey'll mess around they'll meme\nbut a lot of first time viewers that\ncome in and i realize this from\nyou know whether it's new accounts or\njust followed accounts that are old\num the first you know comments\nare usually something along the lines of\nlike some sort of physical activity or\nsome sort of\nsize up right like something like\nuh you know you probably have a small\ndick or do you know how to fight oh i\nyou know drop you like it's always like\nthat's always a starter which tells me\nthat when people look at me\nthat they see some sort of\nsomething they need to size up like they\ncan't just come like hey what's up right\nso like i don't know if that's\nyou know an insecurity on their end i\ndon't know if it's just you know a vibe\ni give off which\ni i actually i'm not cause i don't know\ni know for a fact that's something\nthat's just given off even though it's\nnot\nyou know i don't mean to and i i've\nrealized this because recently i i was\ntesting this thing out with i was\nplaying among us\nand i decided to test out this thing\nwhere\ni actually hire the pitch of my voice\nand i talk more like i'm asking\nquestions than i am\nmaking a statement right so so\nlike i'll give an example so i'm like oh\nno yeah no it's okay don't worry about\nit no i'll go ahead\nright like i'll talk like that and like\nsuddenly like i'm very well\nyeah suddenly i'm like everything's okay\ni'm the nicest person in the world\nlike no one's having any issues like i'm\ninvited back\nright but then as soon as i'm like all\nright where were you\ntell me what task you're doing suddenly\nlike you know i'm getting messages like\nuh from the person you're scaring them\nlike you're being a little aggressive\nthey don't want to play with you\nright but it's like i'm not doing\nanything right it's only the pitch of my\nvoice that's changing\nand it's like it's some crazy [ __ ] i've\nnoticed it's crazy [ __ ]\nright so\nyeah not son you know it's it's weird\ntrain and i i hope i'm not falling into\na trap which i think maybe we can talk\nabout but\nsure i feel like interviewing you like\nhave you seen the movie beauty and the\nbeast\nyeah of course i feel like this is the\nclosest i'll ever get to interviewing\nthe beast\noh my man appreciate that hey you keep\ntalking like that i'll be buying you a\nchristmas gift you know what i mean\nhonestly i mean it's kinda\ni'm just kidding sorry um is that a\nreference to dick in a box\nit is okay at least i'm on i'm on point\nthere\ni was like yeah go ahead it's it's it's\ngreat i appreciate it\num so so but but really train because\nwhat i'm what i'm hearing from you is\nsort of like\nyou know you keep on saying like you\nlook like a gorilla\nand what i what i'm what i'm hearing is\nthat like people\nlook at you and they're frightened of\nyou\nand what's it like to be someone that\npeople are fright like people come in\nand they just can't say what's up like\npeople\nyou know you have to raise the pitch of\nyour voice and boy do you sound like a\ncompletely different person\ni do don't i it's crazy like i was i was\nlistening to some uh\ni was listening to the vod afterwards\nand i was like damn like\nthis is what people need me to be just\nlike a total like\ni i you know just a total [ __ ] like\nthey need me to like you know succumb to\ntheir\nyou know they need me to like do\nsomething that lets them know that like\nthey're in charge\notherwise like i'm a wild card right\nlike anything can happen they can\nthey can't be themselves i might step up\nand call them out i might beat them up\nlike some crazy [ __ ] like that it\ndoesn't make any [ __ ] sense\nhow long have people been scared of you\ntree people\naren't scared of me i think there was\njust uh\ni don't want to say they're scared of me\nright like that's going to invite in\nsome [ __ ]\nlisten i know some badass [ __ ]\nis probably watching hey listen i don't\nwant any trouble\nbut anyways um let me rephrase how\nyeah people been initially reacting to\nyou with fear\noh since the beginning i still remember\nmy\nbeginning middle school\nmiddle school for 100 high school middle\nschool i'm kind of just\nassuming based on my high school\nexperience so high school i'll explain\nto you\nhigh school uh i moved high schools and\ni went to this in\nthis new city new school a whole\ndifferent beat different vibe different\nculture\ndifferent you know um it was an\nall-white school it was really weird\nright like it wasn't like an all-white\nschool but like everyone was just\nwhite like i remember like junior year\nwe had one black kid it was just a very\nweird experience because my other\nthe place i came from the middle school\ni went to it was just all mixed it was a\nmelting pot just everybody was there\nand that's kind of what i was used to\nright all my boys like um\nbut anyways go to the school and you\nknow it was just\nman it was non-stop uh\nyou know it was just psychological uh\nbullying right and in those days\nthere was no there was no attention to\npsychological bullying\nright back then it was sticks and stones\nmight break your bones but words cannot\nhurt you so that no one paid any\nattention to that\nand anyways to fast forward we can go\ndeeper into that stuff\nlater if you ask any questions relating\nto it but fast forward to senior year\ni ended up approaching like the main\ni don't know what i'd call him the main\nkid\nthat kind of uh like facilitated\nyou know the the bullying or the hate\nand\nyou know he kind of came to me i went to\nhim and i'm like yo\nlike why and he actually apologized he\nwas super like nice and sweet and\nhe's like it all came down to freshman\nyear when you walked through our holes\nyou were the new kid no one knew you and\nwhen we looked at you you walked around\nwith your head up high it just seemed\nlike you thought you owned the place\nand we needed to bring you down and let\nyou know that we own it\nright and i'm thinking here like damn so\nme walking around with my head high\nit tells them that it like they feel\nthreatened\nby me walking around my head high i need\nto walk my head down i need to\nshow some visible insecurity or some\nvisible sadness or some visible misery\nin order for them to be okay and my\nentire four years of high school\nof bullying was because\nof that single walk of the hole right so\nso how does it feel to be in that\nposition\nwhere who you are pisses people off\nbecause that hasn't changed right like\nwhat this that what you just told me\napplies to among us\ntoo\nbecause you can't well no no oh\noh i'm so sorry oh oh\noh well among us a little different you\nknow among\nyou know among us there's a little bit\nmore you know i wouldn't say amongst\ndirectly connected\nthere's a lot more politics going on\namong us you know people want to be the\nbest in the lobby so they can farm the\nbest youtube clips and continue to be\nrelevant right\nthere's a different dynamic going on\nthere right that's just that's like\ncontent creator\nlife people it's like survival of most\nrelevant right if i'm in the lobby\nthey're not going to get off their plays\nor it's going to be harder and they're\ngoing to get one clip instead of 20.\nso like that's different like i think\nthat's just you know\nthe competitiveness of whatever right so\ni don't think\nyeah but yeah does that make sense you\njust told me that people think that\nyou're scary what does that have to do\nwith\nhey train you're scaring people a little\nbit\ncan you talk a little bit more like a\n[ __ ]\ni've never said that but yeah\ni mean so so i i understand that like\nlook i'm not\ndisputing that the among us\nstreaming community in high school are\nreally different situations\nwell to be further kind of similar there\nare so many what shocks me is that\nis that like i mean i i think it's like\nnot unreasonable to draw a parallel\nbetween\nwalking in with your head held high and\nspeaking like you normally do\nboth of those are just being just you\nand something tells me that if you had\nspoken when you\nwhen they walked when you walked in with\nyour head held high if you had opened\nyour mouth and you'd use your among us\nvoice\nthey wouldn't have bullied you\noh i'm so sorry what um huh\n[Music]\nyeah probably not i mean then again like\nif you saw the way i looked in high\nschool i don't know why the hell they\nwere so [ __ ] intimidated\ni mean i guess i did have my you know\nyou know i slapped my same big\nface and big head but damn i was\ni was a creature out of sheesh i gotta\nshow you a picture one of these days\ngod damn i gotta show you a picture\ndoctor okay i'm telling you\ni'm gonna show you a picture right now\nactually screw it why not take a look at\nthis hold on hold on hold on hold on i'm\nhappy to see the picture but just\nbefore you show me the picture i'm\ncurious what do you think my reaction is\ngoing to be\nthat's a good pho that's a good point i\nguess you'll have no reaction but i\nguess deep down\nwhatever's healthy like damn my man\nbut yeah what do you what do you want\nwhat do you want me what are you looking\nfor by showing me this picture\ni guess i'm holy [ __ ] that's actually\nyou know what\nthat is what you just asked me there\njust unlocked something that\nnow that i've like now that i understand\nwhy i keep showing this picture\nit's the most logical common sense thing\never\nbut i never thought of it before i'm\nshowing it so you don't\nsee me this way and you see me that way\nso instead\nyou cannot be threatened just talk me\nnormal i'm showing you a picture of me\nat a point\nwhere i'm just ugly\nterrible weak and i'm shown that you're\nhoping that when you look at me now\nyou see that instead of this so you can\njust chill holy [ __ ]\nbecause i keep showing this as a\nreference point to everyone that i talk\nto\nwith whatever argument i get into and\nnow like that holy [ __ ]\ngood [ __ ] good [ __ ] i like that that was\ngood\nholy [ __ ] that was good good stuff yeah\nyeah here it is though check that out\nhold on i'll check it out in a second\nwe're not we're not done we're just\ngetting started okay\nsure so like something struck me as\nstrange and you're like every time we\ntalk about high school\nand then you said we we end up looking\nat a picture of me from high school and\ni was like\nhow on earth does that happen do people\ngo and google what you look like\nin high school and i think there's more\nto it if you really want me want to show\nme the picture that's fine\nbut what i want i like that i want you\nto pay attention\n[Music]\nto\ni want you to pay attention to yourself\nso do me a favor actually\ncan you screen share the picture so that\nwe see the picture instead of you\nyes sir and i want you to pay attention\nto what you feel as i look at it\nright as you click the button\nuh give me a second to make sure okay\nuh share your screen make sure this\ndoesn't mess anything up oh\ndid i mess anything up no i didn't nope\nis this it\nthere should be it can you see that\nokay i'm sorry i couldn't help but laugh\nhow did you\nhow did you feel when i looked at that\npicture and laughed i felt relieved\ni felt good that's what i want i want\ni want that's that's all i want i want\nyou to look at it laugh and now we're\njust good\nright because like now you have\nsomething of me that made you do that so\nnow from now on when we talk i mean\nobviously this is the case between us\nanyways\nbut what would happen normally is from\nnow when we talk\nif your ego ever tells you this guy is\nthreatening something\nyou just go back to this picture plop it\nin your image you go okay we're good\nnever mind look at this dude like\nno shot right does that make any sense\ncan i unsure\nyeah you can unsure yeah so i\ni think it's a great revelation on your\npart and i want to keep digging\nis that okay sure whatever you want\nso the interesting thing is that that\nuh what what i what i felt was that i\njudged the picture negatively\nno i didn't get that bad no that's\nthat's what i felt i was like like\nthat belongs on have you seen this part\nof this reddit called blunder years\nyeah it reminds me a little bit of\nblunder years like\ni don't mean to be condescending towards\nyou but like that was my initial like\nit reminded me of like how we all look\nsuper awkward in high school and\nand i saw a little bit of myself in that\npicture and i was like oh [ __ ]\nyou know if you see a picture of me in\nhigh school it reminds me yeah\nit reminds me of have you seen those uh\nthose\nlike movies that have the actors then\nlike at the end it shows like their high\nschool photo of like\ntheir entire like metal gear like you\nknow some some\nsome [ __ ] uh solar system of braces\non\nright like that that's what reminds me\nof it reminds me of that like you know\nwhat we see now\nyou know there's a story behind it right\nnot all of we didn't look to swear into\nour lives we didn't you know we've all\nhad our\nyou know whatever yeah so that yeah i\ndon't know\nso like just to kind of draw a couple of\nrandom ass parallels okay\nand i'm just gonna start tossing stuff\nout train you let me know it sounds like\nyou've\ndiscovered something important so cool\num\ni'm gonna just offer a couple of other\nhypotheses one is that\nwhat i'm sort of seeing is that like\nyou're showing people\nhey do you see how i wasn't always the\nbeast i used to be human\nright it's like like you like in beauty\nand the beast it's sort of like\nyou're the beast at that point and\nthat's what everyone sees and like you\nwant to show people that\ni wasn't always like this and please\nremember\nthat i'm not as scary as i appear yeah\ni mean i know what i have to do like i\nknow what i realistically have to do i\njust don't know the patience for it\nwhat are you i just everyone that comes\nto me and thinks i'm some sort of\nyou know [ __ ] beast right you know to\npick something with i just gotta kill\nhim with kindness that's it i gotta come\nwith kindness until one day they you\nknow just say\n[ __ ] it right [ __ ] [ __ ] i'm the [ __ ]\nright but i just you know i'll keep it a\nbuck fifty i just say [ __ ] that\nand i just you know give him a little\nroast back cause i'll tell you what it's\nalways the weebs\nand it's always the overwatch uh uh\nviewers\nthat are always the most judgmental and\nit's crazy it's crazy it's bad [ __ ]\nbecause those those two sections have no\nplace to be judgmental\nsorry i went off on a tangent\nyeah so train i i wonder if there's a\nlittle bit more to it so like\ni have a wild wild wild thought\nwhich is what if when people look at you\nthey don't see what you think they see\nwhat if they don't see you as scary\nwell here's the thing\ni'm gonna ask you a question okay now\nnot this dr k\nbut the the you 20 years ago okay\nif you saw someone that was actually\nhideous\nthat was actually overweight would you\nsit there\nand non-stop call them those names call\nthem those things let them know that\nthey're the those things\nno you wouldn't right it's only the ones\nthat you know or not but you need to\nkeep\nsaying it to make them smile believe it\nright because like if they actually were\nyou're not right like people who are\nactually these things\nif they actually were you'd feel bad\nsaying them right\nso like i've come to this conclusion\nthat\nif i was truly this hideous ugly\ndisgusting beast that scared everyone\nright\nmaybe people wouldn't you know right\nlike it seems like there's something\nelse to it doesn't make any sense\ni completely agree so then let me ask\nyou something so your conclusion is that\nif people keep on calling you out is\nscary you must not be that scary because\nif you were really really scary then\nlike\nif people are truly hideous we don't\ncall them hideous to their face well\nno one says scary because like like that\nwould contradict the entire purpose of\neven coming to say anything\nif you say someone's scary you're\nautomatically you're already giving up\nthe peace that your ego is supposed to\nbe fighting for right sure good point\nyeah it doesn't it doesn't manifest in\nyour scary yeah it's more so\nit it comes through as in like ugly or\nsomething negative just it's it's\nsomething that\ni know if it was true they wouldn't say\nit instead they'd look and feel bad like\ndamn\nwhy do you keep calling yourself a girl\nwhy do you keep saying that you look\nlike a gorilla\ni mean i'm going to be honest i i kind\nof like it i i think you know i mean i\ndon't think i look i mean\ntechnically we evolved from them is that\ntoo bad\nyou feel me yeah i don't\nyou kind of like it what do you like\nabout it\nit's just\ni don't know it's perfect right think\nabout this\ngorillas they're these powerful\ncreatures right but they just sit there\nand\nthey eat grass it's perfect\nright people see me as this guy that's\ngonna bend the bars and\nbeat everyone up and do the worst things\nin the world but really i'm just eating\nmy grass\nhanging out doing what i can right does\nthat make sense so what i'm hearing is\nthat a gorilla is a good\nrepresentation for the way that\nyou are treated in the way that you are\nin the sense that a grill is like\ngigantic and can look kind of scary but\nthey're just sort of chilling\nand so you're judged for being sort of\ngigantic and kind of scary but you're\njust\nkind of chilling well to be fair i'm\nkind of small right now but yeah\nfor the most part i would say so i mean\ndoes that mean you're kind of small\nright now\nwell kobit you know i haven't really\ndone any of my regiments\nso uh oh i see you mean like musculature\nyeah which is another thing which is\ncrazy right when i'm big\nthe problem is even worse i lose my size\nand then we're in a new avenue right\noh you look like a skinny [ __ ] bro yeah\ni hit the gym again then i hit the gym\n[ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] trying to get\nmuscles just make you dick bigger like\nright like nothing's going to fix your\ndick size right like there's always\nsomething right that's life\ni think just life there's haters and\nthere's none right\ni just think there's more show in my\nhead it sounds to me like you can win\noh i don't think i don't i don't think\nanyone can win the point is\nthis is gonna exist no matter what right\nyou have to accept it and you have to\njust\nyou know put yourself around like for\nyou to\nalways have people be unhappy\nwith who you are\nwell thank thankfully i've realized\nrecently that it's only\na vocal minority right like the people i\npay attention to are the positive\ncommenters and the people that are there\nfor me the things that i have done that\nwe have done as a community\nright i just pay attention to them now\nfor a lot that took me a long time\nright and even once in a while i'll be\nhonest you know i'm a little content\nstarved some you know i'll point a\ncouple out roast them but i think for\nthe most part they're gonna exist no\nmatter what\nyou just to focus on the more positive\nones and not give them\nbut here's the craziest part that i've\nnoticed the ones that are doing this\ni don't even know if it's right to call\nthem\nlike haters or whatever you want to call\nthem because i've noticed they're\nactually\nit's this weird thing they're actually\nmore loyal than the positive ones\nmy most loyal like the ones that like it\nfeels like they die for me in some weird\nsadistic criminal minds aaron hochner\nway\nor ones that should talk me right now\ndon't get me wrong i love the ones that\nare positive they're loyal as hell too\nbut it seems like\nthe most diehard it isn't even like a\npure hatred they want to bring me down\nit seems like in order to continue to\nwatch me\nthey need to do it to justify it for\nthemselves i don't know it's some weird\n[ __ ] [ __ ] well so\nlet's not worry about the minority for a\nsecond because you're sort of talking\nabout the minority but what i'm hearing\nis that this has been like\nthis doesn't sound like a minority issue\nto me this sounds like you've been\njudged for your appearance\nand your voice like every person that\nyou\ntalk to you have these thoughts about\nnot wanting to scare them you have these\nthoughts of like\neventually showing them the picture so\nthat they are not scared of you\nthat doesn't sound to me like you're\nresponding to the minority that sounds\nto me like you're\nresponding to a fact of life yeah you're\nright i'm kind of just downplaying right\nnow because i feel like\ni feel like the the problem with being\nin that situation is\nthe very situation itself\nit's almost like what is it what is it\nit's a paradoxical situation\nbecause the people that that the peop\nlet me explain why what that means okay\nhere's why it's this weird thing that\ncan never be solved and never be fixed\nbecause the people\nthat do it passively they don't\nrecognize it because they don't actually\nwhen they look at me they don't see it\nas this unfair treatment\nthey in their minds have come to a\nconclusion based on certain things that\ni do\nor whatever the case might be right and\nit is\nthis objective rational thing that\nthey've come to you know\nto a conclusion of right like this isn't\nsomething that like so when you point it\nout\nit sounds like i'm not taken responsibly\nfor something i'm doing\nand if it's not right and if it's not\nthat\nthen what i'm saying doesn't exist i'm\ndelusional right like there's no solving\nit because the people\nyeah i get that so here's my question\nwhat's it like to be on the receiving\nend of\nall of that like it sounds like you\ncan't win\nlike they look at you they judge you\nlike\nif you point it out to them it feels\ndelusional\nif you try to be yourself they're scared\nof you in an among us lobby\nyou know and and so then you have to go\nthrough all these hoops and gymnastics\nof showing them high school pictures so\nthat they're like\nwhat is it like to like walk around and\nand like\nhave to convince people that you're not\nscary like holy [ __ ] man\nwell that's not even the saddest part\nokay the saddest part\nis i don't even have like for 90\nof the people i meet it's not even the\ncase where i have an\nopportunity to show them i'm not this\nperson\nright it's i'm just disconnected\ninstantly and i don't know why\nright i'll send a message like yo i'm\nsorry if i you know did this or did that\nand like it's just like\nright because that's the best way i've\nnoticed people like to\ndeal with their stuff right they just\ntotally remove it from their lives\ninstead of facing and seeing what made\nthem feel this way and what actually i\nmight have done\nright which might have been something\nwho knows right i think a lot of people\ni've had a lot of friends reach out to\nme saying yo you know when you said [ __ ]\nyou to me that sounded like a\nterror right like right like it sucks\nokay\ni can't like for example okay on the\npodcast if i like\nget excited and argue everyone thinks\ni'm this in this [ __ ] crazy\naggressive mood\ni'm just excited like i wonder if i had\na higher pitched voice\ndo i have the right to be excited in my\narguments but since i have a deeper\npitched voice and i get excited\ni'm going to war with them and all of a\nsudden they think i'm coming at them\nright it so it sucks yeah but i guess\nthat's\nhow it is i don't know\ndoes that make any sense yeah entirely\ntoo much\ni mean listen my mom has told me this\nsince i was a kid though dr k\nmom told me listen you have a deep voice\nwhen you get excited\nyou know you kind of you know get a\nlittle aggressive\nright one day someone's going to punch\nyou in the face she told me that she\ndrove my [ __ ] head drew down my head\ndrill down my head for so long\nright and that eventually that's kind of\nwhat started happening not\nphysically punching the face but you\nknow over the internet people would be\nlike [ __ ]\nyou know the [ __ ] back the [ __ ] up right\nand then we get into an argument we're\ngonna talk for three weeks\nbut i was just excited in an argument\ndoes that make any sense makes a lot of\nsense so i have i have a\nwild thought okay and this is probably\nthe most\nwrong thought that i will have\nin a conversation with you but i'm going\nto share it anyway\nso when i think about\nso sometimes i work with people who\ndon't aren't confident let's say\nin the way that they approach i'll just\nassume a heteronormative stance for a\nsecond\nso like we'll we'll talk about you know\ngamers who have trouble talking to women\nso we're assuming the gamer's a dude\nwe're assuming they're heterosexual and\nwe're assuming that they\nlike women okay and so then there's\nsomething really wild which is that like\nthey say that yeah the reason that i\nhave trouble\ntalking to women is because i am\nterrible\nand i'm ugly and i have a small jaw\nand all these other things they'll sort\nof use this bio-deterministic\napproach to explain\nwhy people respond to them the way that\nthey do\nright it's not my fault it's just women\njudge me this way\nand so the wild thing that when i work\nwith these people is that\nwhat we actually find is that it's the\ninsecurity itself\nthat is based on this belief that\nwomen don't like them that is what makes\nthem unattractive to women\nyeah and so here's the wild thing that i\nhave for you\ntrain is that is does the same apply to\nyou is it your belief that you're scary\nis it is it your mom drilling into you\nlike just imagine what that does to a\nkid when your mom tells you\nhey by the way you're a scary looking\nkid and if you get excited\npeople are gonna dislike it like that\nplants a seed in your mind and i'm\nalmost wondering whether\nthe reason people think you're scary is\nbecause you\nthink you're scary i don't think i'm\nscary\nthe point that that's what i'm trying to\nsay i don't think i'm scary\ni know myself i'm a [ __ ] teddy bear\ni mean right like you think you think\npeople think you're scary\ni wouldn't say scary i would say i think\nthere's an intimidation factor\nsomewhere there where they feel like\nthey i need to be you know they need to\nsize me up just to let me know\ni don't think it's a scary thing i think\nscary is a little bit of an extreme i\nthink yeah there's\ndefinitely there's an intimidation thing\nbut i don't know\ni'm not right like it's not like i'm\nstill i i don't know\nyeah so so here's what should i do in\nyour opinion then to not\ngive off i i know this this sounds this\nsounds like\nso like i said this is probably the\nthing that i may be the most wrong about\nright but i think that if if this\nhappens to be right even if it's\nyou know the low light likelihood that i\nthink it could actually change a lot of\nyour interaction so like let's just go\nthrough two scenarios right one is that\nyeah you know you're a smart guy and\nand you've made lots of observations\nabout your life and you've noticed the\nway that you're treated and it's like\nthe height of arrogance for me to tell\nyou that your experiences\nhave been incorrectly interpreted by you\nright\ni mean you've grown up with your face\nand your voice\nwell i've been told these things right\nsure of course of course\nright just like the incels say about\nlike\ni've been i have all this data they give\nme tons and tons of data about why\nthey're unattractive\nthey point to all sorts of things so\nyou know you know so so it's like it\nlike so it's\nit's very it's the height of like\npsychiatric arrogance to dismiss\nyour experiences based on some beautiful\ntheory\nthat is mind-blowing that i've\nconstructed right it's like the worst\nmistake that my profession makes is when\ni say\nyou are wrong train here is really\nwhat's going on with you it's all in\nyour [ __ ] head\nso i could be making the biggest mistake\nof my profession right now\nand at the same time there's a part of\nme that wonders\nyou know like how much of this is like\nyour\nperception that people think you're\nscary\nand almost like an over compensation\nfor insecurity that signals insecurity\nright because you know you're a teddy\nbear and you have to start raising your\nvoice\nwhich then sort of like maybe that's\nlike it's the overcompensation that's\nactually kind of like people are like\nnot quite sure\ni don't really know here i think it's\njust it's like it's just a thought that\ni had\nwell i'll tell you the exact process\nthat it goes through okay\nso it's not the case that i talk to\nsomeone and\nsomeone is standoffish and i'm like oh\ndamn i must have scared them that's not\nthe case right like what happens is\ni something happens and then i'm not you\nknow invited back or they stop talking\nto me or they get\nvery weird and i i sense that i don't go\nokay well\nmust have been hey you know they must\nhave just got scared of my voice just\nreal quick i actually sit there and i\nthink okay\nwhat could i have done i must have said\nsomething i must have did something\nthat i sit through this process and then\ni reach out i send\na nice like well-written apology saying\nyo i'm sorry if i offended you in any\nway\ni'm looking through this i don't see\nwhat i've said but i had no intention\nright\nand then that's when i'll get the\nresponse back right like and there's\nmany people uh big figures that i've\nsome some you've talked to some you\nhaven't\nthat have just directly said hey and i\ncan name names if you'd like they've\nsaid\nlisten you have this aggressive\nvibe to you your your voice\nmixed in with your emotion scares people\nthese are the exact words written to me\nby very credible\nand like brand friendly like people like\ndirect messages\nthis exactly and i was very shocked that\nthey'd admit this because\nno no one will they'd rather just put it\non me than admit it because it's a\ndirect\nyou know a conflict with their ego if\nthey admit it right so the fact that\nthis person\nthese people have admitted this only\nafter we've become\nsuch you know does that make sense yeah\nit makes sense i i just don't want to\naccept that\ni i don't like i'm having trouble i\nrealized why i'm offering this crazy\ntheory\ni don't want to accept that you have to\nlive a life where people are scared of\nyou for you just being you\ni don't think they're scared of me\nwhatever call it whatever you want i\njust don't\ni that hurts too much for me to think\nabout\nso i i'm just for a way to disprove that\nbecause i don't want that to be true and\nthere's\ni think a lot i think a lot of people\ndon't want to be true either\ni mean like over the last like four\nyears i i think i've been saying this\nfor a long time\nand a lot you know it all started with\nyour delusional right ego andy\ndelusional like\nnot can't take responsibility then you\nknow a year goes by some people are like\nholy [ __ ] you're right what the [ __ ] two\nyears goes by\nnow i'm at a point where there's content\ncreators that i don't even know that i'm\nseeing post\nthings of me saying if train did this\npeople would freak the [ __ ] out\nright when this guy does it they're cool\nwith it like\ni see this everywhere now people that\ni'm not even connected to because people\nare slowly\nthe more i talk about it the more people\nare stepping back and they're realizing\nholy [ __ ]\nsix people just did this yesterday train\ndid one tenth of this\nand there's 15 head threads and six news\narticles and trying to get them banned\nright\nlike it's there unfortunately you know\nyou know really what i want to do\ni don't know if this is this is probably\na bad idea so i'm just going to share\nthis thought kind of randomly like i\nwonder if we ever meet in person\nyou're you're in texas right yes so we\nwere thinking about as healthy gamer\ndoing sort of like an austin meetup\nat some point and and what i'm just\nreally curious about this is probably a\nterrible idea so we you know shouldn't\ndo it for all kinds of reasons\ni'm really curious what i want to do is\ni i want to introduce you to my kids\nand i just want to see how they react\nand if my kids are scared of you\nboy is that going to hurt but i think\nbut if if they're not scared of you then\nlike i think we've got to go back to the\ndrawing board\ni don't think they'll be scared of me\nmost kids that i meet like\nthey love me right like and\ni don't know what like why do you think\nthat is why do you think it is that\nadults are\ni know scared as a strong word but you\nknow\nbecause they have nothing to be\nthreatened by that's not it's not even a\nthought in their head like\nthey don't like upon entrance of the\nroom they don't think oh damn\nthe [ __ ] like this guy walks in like\nmy girlfriend [ __ ] this guy like they're\nnot thinking they're not there all\nthey're thinking about is like\ntrade you're so deep into these people's\nheads man that's wild\nlike just think about how much you're\ninferring about someone else's thought\nprocess\ni i think i think it's just a\ni don't think it's like something that's\nlike i think it's just basic human [ __ ]\nto be honest right it's like a flight or\nflight thing right like if i\nright like if i see someone that's you\nknow right there's people i look at\nlisten i do it too and i have to step\nback like holy [ __ ] this is what happens\nto me i don't like it i gotta not do\nthis guy i i'm respond\ni am guilty of doing what people do to\nme to others\nthere's people i look at i'm like damn\nthis [ __ ] like can i act myself\ncan i be wild they're going to chill out\naround this guy i might slap the [ __ ]\nout of me right\ni do the same thing right that's how i\ncan recognize it so well because i'm\nguilty of it just just as everyone else\nhas their person that they're guilty of\nit with too i think\nthe part of it is once you go through\nyourself you really right there's a\nwisdom to it\nuntil you get to a certain point of\nmaturity maybe i don't know but\ni've done it myself and i've i've\nactually had to hold back my damn\nthis isn't right this isn't fair i don't\nlike this why the [ __ ] would he and i\nend up meeting the guy and\nyou know sometimes he's actually a great\nguy and sometimes he is actually a dick\nwell so that actually makes me a little\nbit hopeful because\nbecause what we tend to do as human\nbeings is apply\nour own internal calculus to other\npeople\nright so like just to give you an\nexample like a projection right yeah\nlike projecting\nyeah so like like so for example um\nyou know i don't care about birthdays\nand events and christmas and stuff like\nthat like i\nenjoy christmas as a holiday with family\nbut gift giving has never really been\nsomething that's important to me so\nyou know if my wife like gets bent out\nof shape because she doesn't get me a\ngift for her she was like bent out of\nshape because like\nmy birthday rolled around and like there\nwasn't a gift and i was like\nyou know but what she was doing in that\nmoment is\nis assuming that i was going to react to\nthe\nsame situation the way that she would\nand on the flip side\nyou know like sometimes i won't get her\na gift or or you know i've learned now\nbecause i'm still married and you can't\nstay married unless you learn\num but like you know i've kind of\nlearned but for a while like i didn't\nprioritize gift giving for her because i\nwas like what\nyou know no big deal like i'll just get\nyou something at a random date because i\nthink it's\nsomething that you'll like i don't have\nto get it for an occasion\nyeah and so i used to assume that she\nhad my thinking\nand she used to assume that i had her\nthinking when it comes to giving gifts\nand that's just something that human\nbeings do and and that's what i'm kind\nof saying is like\nso first of all i admit that like like i\nsaid i could be wrong\nsecondly i also admit that i have a i\ncare about you\nand i don't want to accept\nthat you live in the world that you live\nin\nand so i'm going to go as far as\ndisputing that your reality is real\nwith the hopes that maybe it doesn't\nhave to be that way\nnow you make the most convincing\nargument if you give me an\ninsult if you give me a narcissist\nif you give me someone who has a history\nof trauma\ni feel pretty [ __ ] confident that\ntheir perception of reality is wrong\nand i am right i think the tricky thing\nhere is that you i think make the\nstrongest case\nfor your perception of reality being\nright\nwhich gives me a sliver of a hope that\nlike\nsomething about the way that you\ninteract with people\nactually creates the very thing that you\nhave learned to accept and that's the\nother thing is like like\nsince you've learned to accept that\npeople treat you this way you know it\nhurts and it sucks but you're just sort\nof like that's life right like what am i\ngonna do sit around and [ __ ] about it\nlike i still have a lot to be grateful\nfor\nyou know i've learned how to deal with\nit and that also makes me sad because\nit's like\ni just don't want you to live a life\nwhere like people are judging you this\nway and i wonder a little bit\nit's like this picture thing i think\nthere's more than meets the eye to this\nwhole situation\nyou just you just mentioned way too much\nthat you look like a gorilla\nwell there's one common thing i've been\ntold my entire life by everybody\nlove hate great you know friends enemies\nthere's one thing that's used to\ndescribe me that's been common among\namong everybody everyone says when they\nmeet me\nand they say this about my eyes they say\ni'm very\nintense the way my eyes like stare like\nit's very intense\ni've been talking about everybody so\nlike maybe when we meet\nyou can do a little you know diagnosis\non that or whatever the hell you call it\nright\nand and that could be the start of\neverything right like\ni mean people listen on a more joking\nside\npeople go as far as saying you know i\nlook like\ni've been through six wars some crazy\n[ __ ]\nright i remember my first girlfriend my\nfirst girlfriend told me she looks in my\neyes and all she sees is darkness\nright this is about my entire life okay\ni'm telling this isn't some things i'm\njust coming in my head\ni'm being told these things like some\ncrazy [ __ ] and then right like and then\nyou know\nthere is the actor from the punisher he\nworks like six different movies\nbut it's always the punisher right\nalways the punisher it's never\nyou know the guy from walking dead right\ni think i was one time with austin right\nit's always the punisher it's always\nsomething to do\nwith war or f i'm i'm telling you it's\ncrazy [ __ ] it's crazy [ __ ] but hey\ni'd rather be this way than you know one\nof those you know\none of those weebs you know i'd rather\nbe this way then you know what i'm\nsaying\nthat was a joke that was that was me\njust making it yeah\nyeah yeah all right sorry no i'm just\ni'm just looking at sorry\nyeah my bad i'm just gonna look at you\nfor a second is that okay okay i'll look\nat you too\nmaybe i need to do my eyebrows you know\ni've been telling you to do my eyebrows\nmore\ncan you can you shut up for a second\ntrain\nyou're not a scary guy man i know you\nknow what's crazy\nwhen i tell jokes i have to and\nhey you can ask my chat about this look\nmy vods i have developed this thing this\nhabit\nover the last 10 years of my life where\ni\nhave to every time i make a joke i need\nto add a\nfake laugh at the end of the joke it's\nlike a little chuckle to let people know\nthis is a joke right i'm telling you i'm\njust i have this like very\ni don't know what it is right yeah i\nmean it's probably my fault but\nyou know that's it right there that was\nit i can\ni i can get behind it i i think i'm\nconvinced\ni'm convinced that people look at you\nand are intimidated\ni'm convinced makes me sad\nbut i i don't think it's all in your\nhead i do still think that there are\nelements of projection or almost like\nthis sort of projective insecurity like\nyou know like you know you're kind of\nthinking like oh my god i'm so scary\nand so like because the the truth the\ntruth i'm not thinking that though\nbecause that's not the truth right like\nif you and i talked deeper into it\ni don't think i'm that because i know\nwhat i actually am\nthat's the problem that's why that's why\ni have to show the high school photo if\ni truly thought i was scary\ni wouldn't show the high school photo\ni'd be like yeah what's up right\ni need to show the high school photo\nyeah no you\nyou would that's why you show the high\nschool photo right because you're\nshowing the high school photo to dispel\nthe myth that you are scary it's not\nthat you're scary on the inside\nit's that you're the beast you're scary\non the outside\nyou've got this kind of like you know\nape-like countenance and intense\ngaze a physical imposing kind of thing\nand and and i'm just really torn because\ni don't know if this is just like\nyou know just play to it right because\nthis is just what's what god has given\nyou\nand you've got a deep voice and and you\nknow you are\nand then there's a part of me that's\nsort of like it's it's got to be tough\nto be\nyou know to walk around and not be able\nto talk i've heard this from women\nactually\nthat like women have to learn like\nespecially in like high-powered\nprofessions they have to learn\nhow to be how like use a different voice\ni've heard of that actually\nthere are it's called something i've\nheard of that we talked about that last\npodcast actually\nthat in certain situations they have to\nchange their voice and thank you vocal\nsomething\nyeah vocal friend vocal fry sorry vocal\nfry yeah yeah yeah so they'll like\nthey'll like add vocal fry to their\nlanguage so that\npeople don't think that they're a cold\n[ __ ] and so they'll be sort of like\nditzy or valley girl or call it whatever\ni i've\nactually talked to women who sort of had\nthese experiences and i'm wondering\nwhether\nyeah it's hard train i don't know i just\nwant you know because\nsomething tells me like because my my\nkids know the disney tropes and if\nyou're a scary looking dude i'm pretty\nsure you know\none of my kids is kind of a scaredy cat\nand i think if she's not scared of you\ni i i'd sort of trust her\nand i i think i i've i've never met a\nkid that's scared of me\nkids so so that's the other thing train\nis i i think you've got to really think\nabout that right like because kids are\npretty\nlike they're pretty surface love i mean\nin a sense they're surface level and in\nthe sense they're deep\nand and and something makes me wonder\nlike why is it that\nyou've like what is it that the kids see\nthat the adults don't and what's the\ndifference there\nit's it's not about what the kids see in\nthe adults don't it's what the kids\ndon't and what the adults see\nright as you grow older there's\ndifferent stereotypes and social like\nconstructs or social standards that are\nset such as what you said earlier right\nthe in cells say i don't have a jawline\nshe's not going to like me right\nso when you point that out right thank\nyou\nso thank you so much so\nactually ludwig said the same thing like\ntwo days ago but anyways so\njust kidding but seriously but anyways\nright when you point out that an incel\nsays\nyou know i have a small jawline she's\nnot gonna like me you're\nyou're literally right there it's being\nadmitted that\nthere is this weird social\nuh uh uh standard set that if you have a\nstress\nstrong jawline if you have a deep voice\nif you look like a man then you're a\ntrue man and without that you're not a\nman right\nso it's these things i think it's that\nright i think it's insecurity\nso right here's here's my experience\npeople who have\nwho i've met that have treated me normal\nand they've been the coolest people in\nthe world\nthey could be the ugliest the most\nbeautiful they share one thing\nconfidence when they have\nself-confidence there is\nnothing there's none of this none of\nthis ever right\nlike a good example is will neff right i\nthink will neff\nhas a a a a\nstrong uh uh grasp of who he is at least\nfor now with where he is in life i don't\nknow and\ni think he has a confidence when he sees\nme he doesn't see me as this\nhe talks me like we're talk like like\nwe're souls floating in the sky\nright so there's different people that\ni've met that have just a true\nconfidence\nand i never have that issue with it's\nusually\nyou know and when i say true confidence\nit's understanding and being one with\nyour insecurities i don't think it's\npossible to be\nfully rid of your insecurities or at\nleast like i think everyone has them and\nyou kind of become aware of them you\nmanage them you know\nmaybe one day you can live without them\nsure but like i think insecurities make\nwho you are right\nso when i say confidence that's what i'm\nreferring to right i think\ngo ahead can i ask you kind of just a\nrandom question that i i don't think\nwe've talked about and i find myself\nbeing really curious about this\nso what is what is what have your\nromantic relationships been like\ngood i've had three girlfriends\nthat's it and they've been good you know\nuh\nyou know i think they you know\nwhen i talk honestly with them i think\nthey you know they open up\nyou know you know i actually just had\nthis conversation recently with\nuh my current girlfriend and we were\ntalking about when she first met me\nversus\nyou know what she knows of me now you\nknow what she knows of me now you know\nshe knows i'm like a nice guy and you\nknow\ni'm softer than inside but when she\nfirst met me when she first looked at me\nyou know she thought i was just\nthis douchebag she even\nwent as far as me you know me even when\nas far as saying you know\nshe could see me snapping becoming you\nknow serial killer or some [ __ ] right\nlike\nlike these are the things right that are\nadmitted like once you like get close\nenough with someone where they're where\nthey they lose nothing admitting these\nthings to you right i've been told that\nby a lot of people the serial killer\nremark i've been told that by\nso many people and it's the eyes it's\nthe eyes i don't know what it is listen\nwith my eyes what what i looked at you\nalready we did this we played this game\nso i i don't know what that does to like\ni'm just so professionally like i don't\nknow what what it does to a human being\nto be told by multiple people that\ni thought you look like a serial killer\nlike what the [ __ ] man\nwhat does that do to someone\nwell to be fair she was just using it as\nan example to like she thinks i would\nlike you know\nyou know beat someone's ass if they\npissed me off right she was like but\nother people\nwhen they say that i think they're being\nserious i don't think she was being i\ndon't think she'd date me if she was\nshe thought that right i don't because\nlike she's she's like a good girl right\nso i don't think she'd date me if she\nthought that but when other people tell\nme that\nyou know i don't know i don't know i\nguess the people that tell me that i\ndon't really [ __ ] with\nso i'm kind of happy they think that\nbecause i don't want them coming near me\nso i think it works it's a win-win\ndoes that make any sense yeah i mean so\ni don't know man trained you've\ni i don't know that i'm i'm just so\nconflicted between\nmy heart going out to you and also like\nthinking that\nif if you did have a gigantic amount of\ncognitive bias or projection\nor view of the world how would that\nhappen it would be\nlike you know a 15 year old kid being\ntold that they look like a serial killer\ni mean it's\ni don't know that you were 15 at the\ntime 18 years old 19 year old i do want\nto make clear\nthe reference i made it was more of like\na metaphoric thing of like how mad i'd\nget\nright with my girlfriend's i don't know\nthe other the other people i don't know\ni just want to make that clear because\nthat's not fair i i've been on this\nearth for 38 years and no one has ever\ncalled me\na serial killer in any way shape or form\neven jokingly metaphorically\nif there is something that i'm doing\nright i can't even think like even if i\ntold\neven if i roasted somebody told him to\nsuck my dick and [ __ ] off i don't even\nthink that would\nwould justify their silicone thing so i\ndon't know what i'm doing right\nthey're watching me behind the screen so\nwhat could i be doing\nso that's that's a damn good question\nright so like you you have a lot of good\nhypotheses you have it's it's my voice\nit's my face it's my gaze i think all\nthose make sense but then i think i i\ngotta think\nthere are some things you're doing right\nbecause you're doing this weird [ __ ]\nlike showing a bunch of people your high\nschool photo\ncould it be my demeanor\nuh that's the thing i i don't know if it\ncould be demeanor or attitude\nor mindset or like whether there's some\nweird ass because i think you certainly\nsound like you're projecting like when\nwhen i hear people\ngo into a lot of detail about what other\npeople are thinking that usually is\ncoming from you\nit's not coming from that right if you\nthink about someone who's got social\nanxiety for example they're like you\nwalk into\nlike a room and they're like yeah these\npeople all think i look like stupid\nand like the the more they double down\non knowing what is in someone else's\nhead the more likely they are\nto be incorrect the real problem\nbut but these things weren't here until\nthey were said it's like\nyou know that's that makes sense it does\nso that's that's where i'm really\nconflicted because i don't know if\nyou're just you're pulling the same\nbiodeterminism [ __ ] that an incel is\nor if this is actually like you know\nbecause it's not like\nyou know incel is it's such a common\nphenomenon that you can't\nit's not just one person's psychology\nright like well the thing is with an\nend cell and cells projecting all that\nonto you know and they\nthey they hate women or whatever right i\nit's not the case where i'm sitting here\nlike hating everybody i\ni'm i just go about my life i i just\nhave to have to work a little harder\ni put it on myself i don't think they\nput it on themselves they put it on the\npeople\nright i think insult puts it on the\nwomen i'm putting this on myself right\nthat's why i have to constantly give\ndisclaimers that's why i'm constantly\nadding laughs to the end of my jokes\ni'm taking responsibility realizing that\nif this is how it is i need to maybe\nwork a little harder\nto get to the base minimum i'm not\nputting it on them right if that was the\ncase [ __ ]\nright so yeah that makes sense i'm with\nyou i think that's very\ndifferent it's a huge difference i think\nit makes you adaptive and\nmakes it healthy the thing that i still\ndon't want to accept\nbecause i care about you and i like you\nis that it has to be that way at all\ni just don't want to accept that\nso i i don't know i mean i think you\ncould be right but well\nif i'm not right then hey let me know\nbecause i'd love to you know i'd love to\nchange it\nbut let me ask you this when i change my\nwhen i change my uh tone of voice and\ni'm you know accepted in and well\nreceived and everyone's cool\nhow can that be like refuted really like\nhow can you explain that phenomenon i\nguess\nlike right very very simply and this is\nhard but the the real question is\nwhether that actually happens\nright so your perception is that when\nyou change your voice\npeople treat you in a different way oh\nfor sure\ni'll make you vods right so so that's\nthat's what the in cell says for sure\ni'll show you all this data about how i\nwas rejected by women because of my\njawline\nno because that's that's made up that's\nin their heads like they're being\nrejected because\ntheir insecurity their jaw line is\nseeping through them physically and the\ngirls recognizing that right\nbut there's a difference there no but\nthe whole point is that you have an\nopinion that you are saying this is\nreality you have a particular way of\ninterpreting events\nthat you say is reality\nyeah but what i'm being told by these\ngroup of people by\nthe leaders of themselves in cells get\ntold too right like the only thing is\nthat they have a\nthey have a cognitive bias that causes\nthem to filter\ncertain kinds of information and then\nthey believe that\nreality is a particular way let me let\nme\nread this you know this is a very\nawkward situation because there's this\nwhole\nmeme based on some of the things that i\npreach and say\nof this in-cell stuff so people are\ngoing to eat this the hell up but they\ncan suck my dick but realistically i'll\nread you\nthe message so you can see that i'm not\nprojecting or adding some things in\nthere you can\ni will read this out loud to you you can\ntell me what you take from it okay\nokay let me find it i mean you can tell\nme\ngive me a sec i'm not going to tell you\nfrom who i'll tell you privately but\nyou know what i mean i've already said\non my stream 100 times\nyeah so just while we're waiting i want\nto echo once again that i\nyou know this is i really could be wrong\nhere i just i just don't know\ni don't think that this it just fits the\npattern train but it doesn't\nfeel accurate to me if that makes sense\n[Music]\nsorry i zoned either okay here we go\nhere it is here to service\nokay here we go\nokay okay so\nthis individual says\nlol to be honest you have an\nintimidating presence\ni thoroughly enjoy playing with you and\ni'm always down to play more\nbut the lobby gets upset when people\nraise their voices even a little\ni hope you didn't take offense i didn't\nmean your intimidating presence thing in\na bad way at all\nbut that's just that so that's exactly\nwhat i was told to me right so this is\nwhat's being told to me right\nso either i am mistaken what she just or\nwhat this individual just said\nand i'm delusional like an incel or\nthis person just explained exactly what\ni'm trying to explain to you happens\nso here's the question how what happens\nwhen other people raise their voices\nuh you know i i gotta think i don't know\ni i gotta i gotta sit in on these people\nlike because i i've\nheard so much [ __ ] about among us\ni have to just listen to you guys\nplaying this [ __ ] game\nbecause i haven't done that yet i'm just\ncurious like\nwhat like i like i just yeah dude i i\ndon't know i don't know that we're gonna\nlike i i want data i want my own data\nwell here's the thing i don't have an\nissue with it with it right like i\nhaven't like\nchanged the way i treat people i still\ndo the things that i do i still do what\ni believe i still\nyou know do my good stuff it's not that\nlike i haven't like become\nwhat's the word i'm looking for i\nhaven't become uh\njaded because of this i haven't become\nsome douchebag and just dismissing\neveryone [ __ ] everybody like not the\ncase\ni just i just recognize it and\ni try to just hang around people that\nknow me and the ones that don't it is\nwhat it is right\nlike we'll have a conversation or two so\nlike that's the that's the main\ndifference i think right i think you\njust wanted to know a little deeper of\nhow it felt\nand yeah it doesn't feel good but that's\njust that's kind of just the way it's\nbeen since middle school high school\nright so this isn't something new i've\njust realized in the streaming world\nit's been like this\nnow i guess you could go as far as\nsaying well what's the common\ndenominator and all these you\nso the problem could be you right that's\na completely logical\nthing to come to right and i could\ndefinitely\nunderstand you know that but you know\nover the internet\nso when i'm in person now that i'm over\nthe internet when i'm being told like\nyou have an intimidating presence\ni'm not doing anything right like i'm\nliterally not doing anything\nyeah yeah does that make any sense i\nmean i guess i guess i guess you could\nargue that maybe\nsubconsciously some sort of projection\nor insecurity seeking through and\ni guess you could argue that but how\ncould i control that if it's\nsubconscious\nthat just sounds like psychological\n[ __ ] to me so so here's\nhere's kind of where where i am right\nnow is like i i think i think train\nyeah i mean i i think you\ni like the word intense\nmore so than intimidating i like intense\ntoo\nwell i i i just always think that as a\nnegative thing\nbut now i just realize it means i think\nit's it's sort of like\ni i think you have a certain charisma\ntoo and it's not\nit i kind of think about do you play d d\ni don't but i've heard it's very fun\nokay so like\ni sort of think about charisma not\nnecessarily as making you likeable but\nthat you have like a force of\npersonality that can influence other\npeople right so it's it's not just that\nyou can be\nit's like you can be intimidating you\ncan be inspiring\nand like people have different sort of\nflavors of charisma i like that i like\nthat a lot actually\nbut but i i think it's just something\nabout who you are i mean i have it too\nit's just mine is a different color from\nyours\nright and and so so\nit's been interesting to see what it\nimpact you can have on other people\njust by virtue of your presence which is\nprobably an amalgamation\nof things like the way that you speak\nsubconscious tendencies\nyour voice i will admit i will admit one\nthing dr k\nthere is one thing that i think adds to\nit that i am in control of that i'm 100\nresponsible for\nlike when i think about it there's one\nthing that i know i can stop\nor at least be more attentive to it or\nlike be more aware of it\nand it's a flaw that makes if you want\nto call it a passive worse\nand it's my it's my\ncombativeness it's my extreme\ndefensiveness\nso like if you come at me with something\nright like i'll take it and then i'm\ncoming back\nright it's that so i think that is\nactually something that\ni would have a control over and i do\nhave a controller and i need to work on\nbecause i think that actually would add\na negative thing to it all right\ndoes that make sense yeah why do you do\nthat\ni don't know i was just i guess it was\njust the friend i don't know the way the\nway me and my friend\nlisten i had a [ __ ] up friend group my\nfriend group\nthere was no you know\nmature classy arguments there was no you\nknow disagreeing and moving on there was\nno shaking hands\nevery single disagreement\nwas a punch of the mouth it was all fist\nfights\nprobably three four five hundred plus\nfist fights just in the period of like\nhigh school\nwithin my group of friends and that was\nmy friends and then obviously the high\nschool experience was [ __ ] terrible\nthat was just psychological bullying\nso like that's just kind of where i am\nright everything was just kind of uh\nyou know you come at me i come at you\nyou get coming right it was just back\nand forth\ndoes that make sense yeah i think that\ncould explain a lot of what we're\ntalking about because like i wonder if\nthat attitude\nseeps through even if you don't\nwait for people to come at you\nright you may be signaling to people\ntrain that\nif you come at me i'm gonna come at you\nyeah 100 i think that's definitely\nsomething that's there 100\nyes i think for sure i give up [ __ ]\nis that not like relevant to you being\nintimidated because everyone has that\nright now if i if i if i call out let's\nsay uh bigdick6974 and say hey\nwhat's up [ __ ] you have a big ass\nnose what do you think he's gonna say\nhe's gonna say\nlook who's talking [ __ ] dome head big\nass head [ __ ]\ngigantic ass bobble head right that's\nwhat i'm talking about we'll just go\nback and forth\nbut but i don't know that big ass dick\nass\n997 is\nis gonna is gonna be\nexuding that pheromone\nlike pheromone isn't like we're talking\nlike some like crazy [ __ ] we're talking\nlike the [ __ ] that like the wild in the\nkingdom\nyou know the female gorillas are\nattracted to i mean i mean i'm i'm not\ni i don't mean literal pheromone i i\nmean like like if\nif you have a presence where you're sort\nof like ready to throw down which sounds\nlike it could have been conditioned in\nyou because that's sort of like\nwhere you grew up right like you grew up\naround\nwell no i grew up in a very good place\nlet's not get that to a stop i don't\nwant to sound like i'm\nfrom the hood i'm not okay with my\nfriend group like you said you guys got\ninto my friend group yeah\nyeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so yeah like so\nyou were conditioned to be\nlike on your guard and sort of like let\npeople know\nthat you know if you [ __ ] with me like\ni'm gonna [ __ ] with you\nand i don't think most people like i\ndon't think i'm i don't think\nyou know i think i don't think i was\nconditioned the same way\nlike if anything well i'm not gonna hurt\nyou like i i i'm not the type to punch\nin the face i don't like that i just\nalways do headlocks\ni i i get what you're saying but what\nlike you're the one who said hey i think\nthat this could be something that i do\nthat contributes and it\nsounds like to me that it could\ncontribute a lot like i'm agreeing with\nyou\nyeah i agree but but let's not forget\nthat like i'm never really on the attack\ni'm i'm the defensive so like we have to\nwe have to ask why\nthe attack is happening in the first\nplace right sure\nbut this definitely isn't a good\nreaction my reaction is terrible so\nhere's here's what i'm hearing\nis that like you you walk softly and you\ncarry a big stick that's only six and a\nhalf inches but yeah\nright pretty thick though\nand i'm cut okay\nbut you know it's something to think\nabout train like whether whether that\nsort of\nreadiness is maybe a good way to put it\nis part of what contributes to the way\nthat people respond to you like\nthere's a certain like readiness and\nwillingness to throw down\nwhy i had to i had to\nit was it was it was what i needed to be\nright so yeah what i'm saying is like\nabsolutely so so\nit's what you needed to be and now the\nreal question is\nhow much of an influence does that\npart that you've carried with you exert\non your interactions\nand i'm almost wondering whether like\nthe the picture the high school picture\nis a way to disarm that\ni use the high school picture to disarm\neverything yep\nyeah i mean i don't listen i don't think\nlisten when i go to conversation\nokay what do you think this\nif you look at the entire way i talk\ndoes that make sense or you know you\nknow well you know\nthis is all to try and add a quirkiness\na a level of like goofiness a level of\nunsureness uncertainty because if i just\nsay\ndr k this is what it is how do you think\nthat's gonna be perceived that's getting\nperceived as\ncocky thinks he knows everything he's 29\nand thinks he's figured out life\nright so you i don't know you know you\nknow i mean does that make any sense i\ni can't explain right you have to add\nthese in there otherwise\nbelieve me whatever's happening now it's\ngonna be 50 times [ __ ] worse does\nthat make any sense\nyou feel me i i want to see i want to\nsee the 50 times worse i want to see\nthat\nokay ask me a question\ntell me about your girlfriend\nthat's not [ __ ] fair that's that's a\nsoft spot right i'm saying\ni'm saying ask ask like a question you\nknow what i'm saying you can't like\nright\ni'm not gonna say oh well you know she's\na\nbad [ __ ] no like she's a good girl\nshe's you know\na very nice and classy woman you know\ngood morals good ethics\num you know uh\nshe's just a good person you know she\nhas a lot of qualities that\ni don't have that i wish i had and\nyou know i see a you know\nversion of me in her that i wish one day\ni could be i guess\ndoes that make any sense beautiful\nbeautiful bro because i i think it had\nyour intensity\nit had your presence it had a depth of\nvoice\nit was profound it was intense and it\nwasn't scary\nit was devoted oh yeah\nyou asked about my girlfriend if you ask\none of my friends i'm going to tell you\nlike nice\nyou know well so but hold on like i mean\nif if\nif you asked me to step in the ring and\nthen i'd throw a punch and then you said\nnothing below the belt like\nyou asked me to throw a punch and i\nthrew a punch\nbecause my whole point is that you can\nbe intense\nyou can be passionate and it's not scary\nit's [ __ ] amazing dude\nit's beautiful\nthank you you're beautiful\ni love that sweater by the way i don't\nmean to break off to different topic\nthat sweater since day one since i first\nsaw your channel\ni don't know if it's just if it's a\ntactic psychologists or psychiatrists\nhave\nthat sweater i swear in itself is a cure\nto so much like it's almost as if like\nthis sweater is just it's it's\ntrustworthy it's cozy i feel like i'm\ntalking to sanjay gupta on cnn like\nlike he always has that like blue\nsweater on on cnn i'm talking about i\nsaid\nsame blue sweater he has and then i'm\ntalking to dr k\nhere i just i just realized holy [ __ ]\nthat that may have just sounded racist\nbecause i feel like i'm talking to\nsanjay gupta i didn't mean that at all\nhope you don't take any offense to that\nno good good what i mean is like every\nlike\ngood vibe doctor wears a sweater like\nthat\nand that the sweater in itself has to be\nlike some hairy\nhave you seen in harry potter they give\nyou a little like quilt that makes you\ninvisible\ni feel like this is the psychiatry\npsychology md\nquilt that goes over you and it\nit it's like a magnet of\nit draws\ni don't know i lost my train of thought\ncompletely the point is it's a really\nnice sweater i\ni mean you know then again my dad has\none of those too\nmy dad's not a doctor but he has one of\nthose and i really like it\ni used to wear soccer practice anyway\nsorry i i went on a whole different road\nthere\nyeah well i you know i'm glad it\nturns you on you know it just it's so\ncozy i can't explain it entirely it's\njust it's very cozy\ni feel safe i i'm i'm with you i\nappreciate that so i i also so the\nreason i love the sweater so this this\n[ __ ] it's a high quality thing i wore it\nliterally like\nyou know five days a week for four years\nor i have\ntwo or three actually is that something\ni give to you in med school\nno or whatever you go to presidency and\nand the reason is because like you know\nwe work in hospitals and hospitals are\ncold and i'm\nlike a little bit cold-blooded so i\nwould wear it\nall the time um and i i really like it\nbecause it it's just\nvery very comfortable and keeps me kind\nof snug and there\nthere are some studies that suggest that\num white coats which is what a lot of\ndoctors wear\nuh actually can make people nervous so\nit's sort of like white coat is sort of\na symbol of authority\num so i steer clear of the white coat\num and a lot of people do nowadays\nactually yeah funny thing\ngo ahead yeah so a lot of doctors wear\nfewer white coats and a lot of nurse\npractitioners and physician assistants\nare wearing more white coats\nyeah white coats are like i feel like\ni've been abducted by aliens and they're\nabout to aimly probe me\nyou know what i'm talking about yeah\nthat sweater feels like i've come to\nyour house and you're ready like you've\nopened your mind up to me it seems like\nwe're\nwe're on a more human you know level\nrather than like an objective specimen\nlevel does that make sense\nyeah i'm glad you feel that way i you\nknow i just wear it because it's comfy\nand you know hmm\nwow sorry sorry we went off on that\ntangent i just kind of\nthat sweater since since since day one\nthat you've come on\nuh twitch i've been telling myself about\nthat sweater i just had to say something\nokay that's it\nokay thanks for sharing thanks for\nthanks for listening um\nyeah are we at a good stopping point for\ntoday\ni guess we are you know what's crazy the\nlast three sessions we've\nstopped so the next session we can get\ninto the drug use days\nand we always talk about some some some\nsmall little avenue\nthat ends up being this huge topic that\nwe never intended for\nand then we never get to the uh crazy\ndays of craving chaos right in between\nhigh school and college\nyou know finding the you know the\nidentity finding yourself\nwhat helped me come back and cold turkey\nand you know not go to any\nrehabs or you know rely on suboxone or\nanything and just do it full cold turkey\nlike what\nyou know gave me that strength you know\ni want to go into these things because\ni understand that you're a uh uh like\naddiction\nuh uh psychiatrist right i may have\nmissed this but i didn't realize you had\na period of extended drug use\noh yeah heroin uh i've used meth before\nuh you know percocets oxycontin that was\nlike probably two years two three years\nof my life\ncrazy that's rough man yeah yeah\nyou know if you wanted to know it's\ncrazy too i wanna know what's insane it\nwas while i was in school\ngetting both of my degrees and i still\nmaintain my grades maintain my uh office\nhours\nwhile doing this in between it was some\ncrazy [ __ ] and the two people i did it\nwith that got me into it\nare both doctors today and they were\nthey were literally pre-med\nand i remember like they had to study\nfor their ocam and their pee\ncam and they were just non-stop in the\noffice hours just doing all the extra\nwork with the professor because you know\nif you\ngo to office hours they increase your\ngrade like 23 at the end even if you\ndon't deserve it\nso like it was just an insane [ __ ]\nsome should have a movie\nbut you should never lose drugs don't\never do those drugs terrible [ __ ]\ndrugs not even once i'll explain next\ntime why not even once\ni have this theory on what not even once\nmeans it's not even about\nit's not about the effect of it to you\nit's about once you make that your new\nbase\nonce you normalize the usage of it the\nnext time you're\nextremely sad the next time you're\nextremely broken and vulnerable the next\ntime you want an escape\nit's no longer going to have a drink now\nthe normal\nbase is that that's what you're opened\nup to because it's so normalized too and\nthat's what i think that not even once\nis\nit's some crazy [ __ ] does that make any\nsense\ni could i could totally bat [ __ ] i guess\nthis is your avenue no no i mean i i\nthink\nit does it makes sense sort of because i\nthink it's\nit's like the first half of a thought to\nme you know i'm really curious about\nwhat else you have to say and to add\ncontext and depth and and flavor to what\nyou just shared\nyou know it's sort of like sharing like\nyou're sharing with me e equals m c\nsquared and you're saying does it make\nsense and it's like i can tell that\nthat's\na monumental equation but i don't quite\nunderstand it\npretty much uh i don't think people\nexplain what don't\nnot even once means i don't think people\nreally explain that accurately they just\ntry to\nscare the hell out of you um and\nyeah next time we can talk about it yeah\ni mean next time i think is good let's\njust open yeah\nopen a can of worms with with small\nthings so yeah but real quick i want to\nmake sure i reiterate this don't do\ndrugs don't do any of those drugs don't\ndo any drugs okay\ni'd even go as far hey people are going\nto hate me for this i even go as far as\nsaying marijuana's gateway drug\ni didn't go as far as that i'm telling\nyou shit's [ __ ] crazy but you know i\nthink it has its good uses don't get me\nwrong\nmedicinally i think you know if you're\ngoing through like some treatment like\ncancer stuff like that i think it's it's\na good avenue right\nyou know but i think i even you know i\nwould i don't know that's i\nhave my opinions people are getting\nupset about yeah yeah i don't know\nyeah i mean i i'd echo as well though i\nthink drugs are\nbad kids yeah um\nbut okay so train do you feel like\nmeditating today\nof course let's do it sorry i'm\nliterally like i slept two days\nstraight my body needed it because like\ni was like putting so much work into\nstreaming\nand i ended up waking up like yesterday\nat like 7 00 p.m\nso right now so like i streamed and i\ntried going to bed but i realized i\nslept for two days i\ni couldn't so i slept like two hours so\ni'm kind of like wired off of the tee\nand no sleep i feel like no sleep is\nmore\nenergizing temporarily than caffeine\nit's crazy does that make any sense yeah\ni mean that's\nactually especially scary if you have\nany history\nof bipolar bipolar yeah\nand yeah i know so you got to be careful\ni i don't really know we don't need to\nget into that but one thing that i say\nto all of my patients who have bipolar\ndisorder is that\nsleep is medicine and is the most\nimportant medicine\nso you know i'd say if you feel a little\nbit energized sometimes people can kind\nof get a second win\nthings like that but you want to be\nreally really careful it's the second\none it's not a manic thing\nyeah it's definitely a second wind\nbecause yeah\nyeah i mean if you slept for two days\nand then you woke up and you know it\nsounds like you've been up for about\n16 hours with a nap in the middle of the\nnight i took a two i took a two-hour\nlittle nap then i'll probably do another\nnap before today's stream i found this\nreally i found this really good show\ncalled repair shop have you heard of it\nvery cozy anyways continue let's do this\nmeditation\nokay so let me just think about what\nkind of meditation have i taught you ohm\nchanting\nno you haven't actually i'm actually\ninterested\nso speaking of you know things that will\nbe\ndeep and resonant so i i think train i\nlike to teach you chanting\ncause i'm kind of curious what what\nwould happen if you did it for a little\nwhile\nso om chanting we're going to start with\nom chanting\nand om is composed of three syllables\nokay so what we're gonna do is it's\ngonna be so\ni'll demonstrate one round so i'm gonna\nstart with making an ah\nsound and then we're gonna go into oh\nshould i crisscross applesauce uh\nif you can yeah so the main most\nimportant thing is that your back is\nstraight\nso more important than crisscross\napplesauce is i take your elbows off of\nyour armrests\nthere we go and so sit up straight and\nthen if\nif your knees um are lower than your\nhips that's\nideal if if you're doing crisscross\napplesauce oftentimes your knees will be\nabove your hips\nand then you'll slouch forward so yeah i\nput them down i realized that was way\ntoo bold of a move i'm not too flexible\ni need to do some yoga\nso what we're gonna do actually let me\nthink for a second\nyeah okay we'll do i'm chanting okay\nso big deep breath\noh\num oh you're demonstrating i'm so stupid\ni'm so sorry\nit's all good man i didn't realize that\nyou're demonstrating for me i thought it\nwas just the follow you that's fine\nit's it's okay oh it's fine it's okay\nsorry i just realized i was it really\nit's not a problem\nso a couple of things to note one is\nit's over the course of one breath\ngood job train over the course of one\nbreath\nsecond thing is that what i want you to\nfocus on is\nvibration not sound\nthird thing is keep your mouth nice and\nopen\nokay so okay ah\nokay okay now sit up straight sit up\nstraight sorry\nyeah oh sorry here we go and then\nso we're gonna do one together okay so\ndeep breath\n[Music]\nin\n[Music]\nyeah the push talks messing with me yeah\nit's okay\nso sit up straight don't slouch between\nrounds\nright so stay anchored and now we're\ngoing to do three rounds okay so\nit's going to be deep breath uh um\nbrief period of silence afterward before\nwe take the next deep breath\nwe'll do three rounds and then we'll sit\nin silence for a little bit\nand just feel the\num sort of the aftermath of the\nvibration after we're done with our\nthree rounds\nokay okay and then we'll sit silently\nwith our eyes closed for maybe about 60\nseconds\nand then i'll prompt you when we kind of\ncome back okay is it possible to push\nthe talk off and try it once because\nwhen it freezes i feel like you've gone\ni'm gonna just i i we're gonna do push\nto i'm gonna keep push to talk on but\ni'm gonna just\nleave it i'm gonna leave my hand on the\nfinger\nokay okay so let's begin so deep breath\nin\noh\n[Music]\nbreathe in\noh\n[Music]\nagain\noh\n[Music]\nbeautiful we're going to do two more a\nlot of power train give me everything\nyou got\ndeep breath in\n[Laughter]\n[Music]\n[Music]\nbeautiful one more time\nyou\nwow\nthat is so calming\ni was so wired a second ago and like i'm\njust like i'm like balanced now\ni have a meeting in like 30 minutes\nthat's crazy\ngood what does that do like like\nam i just exerting a certain energy\nthat's just kind of\nthat i'm like like is that is that\nexcess energy that i'm like exhausting\ninto the planet is that like what's\nmaking me feel calm\npart of it so ohm chanting does\nthousands see that was a good breath\nright there at the end just letting it\nout right\nyeah so it does several things so one is\nit does should be\nshould he is cleansing so i think that's\nwhere you were\nso you were a lot of excess energy\nexcess\nthoughts focusing your mind on one thing\nletting those things go\nkind of grounding other thing that it\ndoes\nis so it does should be which is\ncleansing it does like the generation of\nshakti\nwhich is energy so it's kind of like\nstoking the fire within you\num and if you think about fire like fire\nburns away impurities\nand also like you know gets hot\nand then um the last thing\nis that the post chanting phase so om\nchanting actually has\nfour parts and the fourth part is\nactually the post\nchanting silence when you stop breathing\nso i don't know if you notice this but\nafter the long breath\nyou'll kind of have a deep breath in and\nthen you'll be like\nnot breathe for like 15 20 maybe even 30\nseconds\nand it's that period of stillness where\nthe real money is\num but yeah it certainly is cleansing\nputting off excess energy it also\ncreates vibration\nand i don't i don't know if this makes\nsense but vibration\num gets things flowing no it does make\nsense\nso it's sort of you know chanting is a\nreally good practice there's a reason\nwhy home chanting is\ncentral it's like a spiritual massage\nyeah it's a great way to put it yeah\nit's like a chakra massage\nyeah cool well good luck well thank you\nagain\nyeah thank you thank you so much for\ncoming on and being so authentic train\nthank you for you know um\nlistening and thank you for being great\nand amazing and if you ever need\nanything you let me know\nwhat i'm saying i got you\nthanks a lot so one thing i'm speaking i\nknow you've been a big supporter of the\nstream i just wanted to let you know\nthat\num you know our coaching program which i\nknow you made a sizable donation to\nsupport is actually going really well\nwe're planning on sending like you know\nall the people who made big donations\nactually like a\nlike a quick one-pager about our\noutcomes\num but the short answer is that uh\nyou know because of your support train\nwe've been able to help\ni'm just trying to remember exactly how\nmuch you donated but probably and that's\nongoing right so i can like keep\ndonating like i can just keep doing it\nall\nyeah is it like an ongoing thing i'm not\nfishing for a donation but\noh i know i know you're not i just yeah\nno you're good the quite the opposite\nwhat i'm trying to do is\nis is express appreciation and actually\nlike it's\nreally helping a lot of people um and\nuh are you know i have to be hesitant\nabout\nsaying things like this because it's not\nreally a medical treatment but\nwe're seeing substantial reductions in\ndepression and anxiety like\npeople who come in with moderate to\nsevere depression\nafter about 12 to 16 weeks we'll be like\nmore in the mild to moderate range\nand this you guys have to take this with\na grain of salt but the effect size is\nactually\nquite similar maybe a little bit weaker\nthan uh 10 to 20 percent weaker than\nprozac\nin terms of reducing depressive symptoms\nso\ni i'm really grateful for your support\nbecause it really is like\nhelping people so we're going to send\nyou guys a quick one-pager\nthat sort of shows our outcomes and\nstuff this isn't this right here is\nenough for me and i\ni'm going to keep doing you know keep\nhelping i just love these these\nconversations are absolutely\namazing and it's food for my brain you\nknow i haven't\nyou know you know they say if you don't\nuse it you lose it right and i haven't\nused this thing\nprobably since college so when i talk to\nyou it's kind of\nyou know it's reopening doors of course\nyou know\nthe logical thinking styles right i mean\nnot so much what we talk about just\nkind of the way we go on whatever thank\nyou when i talk to you you seem well\npracticed at this stuff\nyou don't seem rusty to me at all\nso this is rusty man you must be a force\nto be reckoned with when you're kind of\ntuned up\nso that's awesome man yeah\ngood luck with your meetings okay thank\nyou let's talk again soon happy holidays\nand happy new year\nlikewise so next time let's talk about\ndrug use i'm just going to ask you about\ndrug use next time\nokay let's do it okay all right take\ncare man bye all right love you bye\nyou"
