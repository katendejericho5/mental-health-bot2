    "transcript": "hey guys i'm dr olo kanoje psychiatrist\nand co-founder of healthy gamer\nwe're on a quest to help the internet\nwith mental health\ntoday i want to talk to you guys a\nlittle bit about\nwhy we become doormats and how to stop\nbeing a doormat\nso the first thing to understand is like\nokay why are we doormat so a lot of\npeople think that they're doormats\nbecause\ni'm weak because i can't stand up for\nmyself because i'm insecure\nand so the tricky thing the reason why\nit's so hard to stop being a doormat is\nbecause\nwe sort of misdiagnosed the problem and\nso if we think the reason we're a\ndoormat is because we're weak and then\nwe try to build our strength up\nthen we think okay if i become stronger\nas a human being then i'll no longer be\na doormat\nwhereas literally what tends to happen\nis that people will will try to focus on\nthose solutions and they find themselves\nbeing doormats over and over and over\nagain\nand then people start to feel a little\nbit powerless and stuck and they're like\nyeah i don't know how to stop being a\ndoormat so let's try to start\nby understanding okay what is being a\ndoormat about\nso this sounds absolutely crazy but\nbeing a doormat\nis about control and it's actually the\ncontrol that you exert\non other people by being a doormat and\nwhat does that mean like that's wild\nright like if we think about a\ndoormat we think oh my god like this\nperson is so powerless other people walk\nall over them\nbut let's try to understand how that\nworks and why people\nwhy doormats let other people walk all\nover them\nso really what it comes down to is\ncontrol when you're a doormat\nyou have a choice right you can either\nstand up to someone\nand then that person is going to react a\nparticular way\nthey may dislike you they may challenge\nyou they may\nsay mean things to you and so if you\nstand up to someone you're sort of\nsurrendering control over their reaction\nand if you behave like a doormat if you\ndon't challenge them at all\nif you let them walk all over you you\nknow exactly what they're gonna do\nthey're gonna continue liking you they\nmay continue you know\nengaging in a relationship with you a\nlot of a lot of this information about\ndoormats comes from abusive\nrelationships\nwhere it's kind of bizarre because\nactually what being a doormat is about\nis it's about controlling the other\nperson right it's about\nbehaving in a particular way so that the\nother person that you're interacting\nwith\nis guaranteed to behave in another way\nright so if i'm nice to them if i let\nthem walk all over me\nthey won't say mean things to me they'll\ncontinue inviting me over\num you know they they'll treat me not\nwell but i know the kind of reaction\nthat i'm gonna get from them\nthey won't cut me out of their life if i\nlet them walk all over me\nand so i know it sounds really really\nbizarre but\nbeing a doormat is actually about\ncontrolling another person right it's\nabout\nbehaving in a particular manner to\nelicit a particular\nresponse or avoid a particular response\nfrom another person\nso this is the wild thing is that\ndoormats actually have a lot of control\nit's not that they lack control it's\nthat they behave in such a manner\nwhere they actually like\ncontrol some of the reactions of people\naround them\nand so the key to to not being a doormat\nanymore is\nactually i know this sounds bizarre but\nit's not to gain more control\nit's to let go of control it's to\nsurrender\nand so the key to becoming uh you know\nno longer a doormat and standing up for\nyourself\nis in letting other people do what\nthey're gonna do\nright i'm gonna do what i'm gonna do i'm\ngonna stand up for myself\nand if you dislike it that's okay\ni have to be okay with surrendering\ncontrol of another human being's\ninteractions\nor another human being's reactions in\norder to stop being a doormat\ni have to be willing to accept that\nother people\nare gonna do things that i may not be\nable to control\nin the moment that you surrender that\ncontrol the moment that you actually\nlet another person react however they\nwant to\nis the moment that you stop being a\ndoormat and when you stand up to someone\nwhat are you doing you're giving that\nperson a choice right you're giving that\nperson a choice you're saying\nhey if you don't like me because i said\nsomething that you did that was\ninappropriate\nand you no longer want to hang out with\nme that's your choice\nstanding up for yourself is not about\ntaking control from other people\nit's about giving control to other\npeople it's about surrendering\nit's about saying hey this is what i'm\ngonna do and you have the choice right\nyou're giving them the choice about how\nto react and sometimes their reactions\ncan be painful sometimes their reactions\ncan be hurtful and the bizarre thing is\nthat the more\nof a doormat that we are the more we're\ntaking away their choice right we're\nmaking the choice for them\nwe're saying yeah i don't we can eat\nwhatever you want to because\nyou know i want to keep you happy being\na doormat is about keeping other people\nhappy\nhow do you keep other people happy if\nyou just even think about it\nkeeping someone happy implies that\nyou're the one who's in control\nthat you have the power to say yeah\nyou know i'm gonna do this thing or i'm\ngonna let you pick\nand therefore you'll be happy and so\nbizarrely who's in control of that\nsituation it's you\nright because you're the one who\nsacrifices yourself for the sake of\nanother person\nthat's not a situation where you lack\ncontrol you're the one who's making the\nsacrifice\nyou're the one who has the choice to\nsacrifice or let them\nrespond right you're actually\ncontrolling their reaction by being a\ndoormat\nit's completely wild so the crazy thing\nabout being a doormat and this is why\nso many people get sick in it is because\nthey think to themselves oh my god\ni'm so weak whereas the bizarre thing\nis that actually you're really strong\nand once you realize that you're really\nstrong that you actually have\nagency over the situation that you're\nthe one who's in control\nand when you let that control go when\nyou let other people\nchoose how to react to you instead of\nmanipulating their reaction\nby playing it really safe and being a\ndoormat and not\nrocking the boat that's when you start\nto make change\nand that's what i see in abusive\nrelationships right i know this sounds\nreally bizarre but one of the most\nimportant things\nto explain to someone in an abusive\nrelationship is that in a sense they're\na victim\nbut they also have agency that\nthe person in an abusive relationship i\nknow this sounds bizarre but it takes\ntwo\nto make an abusive relationship it takes\ntwo people right it's not just one\nyou look at an abusive relationship and\nyou think oh like i'm the victim and\nthis person has all the power\nand there's certainly a power dynamic\nthere but why does that power dynamic\nexist\nit's because one person gives their\npower to the other person and one of the\nbest ways to overcome abusive\nrelationships is to\nrecognize that you're actually the one\nin control\nthat you're the one who sees that\ncontrol to them\nyou're the one who controls that person\nby not rocking the boat\nyou control their reactions you\nmanipulate their reactions\nyou're walking on eggshells all the time\nyou don't want to upset them\nright so who's in control of whether\nthey get upset\nyou are and so the crazy thing about\nthis is that\nyou know it gets really tricky because a\nlot of times people will feel like\noh my god if there's an abusive\nrelationship and you say that\nyou know it takes two to to make an\nabusive relationship you're blaming the\nvictim\nit's not their fault they're in an\nabusive relationship and in a bizarre\nway that's not always true\nright if you really think about how do\nyou get someone out of\nan abusive relationship and i'm talking\nabout you know patients that i've worked\nwith\nas a psychiatrist it's not in\nplaying the victim card it's not saying\noh my god you're a victim\nsure certainly bad things have happened\nto you traumatic experiences\nhave happened to you and we deserve\ncompassion\nyou know we should be compassionate\ntowards those people absolutely\nbut it's actually in empowering that\nperson right it's in helping that person\nunderstand\nhey actually you're the one in control\nhere you\nhave power in this relationship and the\nreason you give up that power\nis to control the other person that you\nhad\nactually exert that power by controlling\nthe other person's reaction\nand the way to get out of that\nrelationship the way to stop being a\ndoormat\nis bizarrely not gaining more control\nbut giving it up\nsaying to the other person you know what\nthis isn't okay and if you dislike me\nfor it\nso be it if you want to break up with me\nbecause\ni'm not willing to accept your\ndisrespect anymore\nthat choice is entirely yours so the key\nthing about\novercoming being a doormat if you want\nto stand up for yourself if you want to\nstop being a doormat\nit's not about gaining more power\nit's not about gaining more control it's\nthe exact opposite it's surrender\nit's let the other person choose put the\nchoice up to them\nyou do what you you're gonna do and let\nthe other person decide\nwhether that that works for them and it\ndoes or it doesn't and that's exactly\nwhat happens in abusive relationships\nwhen people stand up to them\nit doesn't work anymore right and then\nyou exercise your choice\nyou say okay if you're not willing to\nchange then i'm\ngone i'm done with this\nso i know it sounds super bizarre but if\nyou want to stop being a doormat\nstop trying to control other people\ndon't try to empower yourself\nlet yourself surrender to the other\nperson's choice\nlet them choose what they're going to\nchoose but you make your choice and you\nlet them make theirs\nstop making their choice for them stop\nmanipulating their choice\nby sacrificing yourself and then\nyou'll stop being a doormat so listen\nguys\ni don't know if you guys like this kind\nof stuff or not but you know here at\nhealthy gamer we're trying to decide\nbest to serve you best to
