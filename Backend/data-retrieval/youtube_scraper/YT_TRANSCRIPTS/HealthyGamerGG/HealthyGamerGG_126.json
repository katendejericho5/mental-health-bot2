    "transcript": "so first thing you've got to understand\nis that an addiction is not you can't\nbeat an addiction so if you even like\nuse that terminology so this implies\nthat there is an opponent and once the\nopponent is vanquished it is dead\nforever I won the game is over that's\nnot how addictions work so addictions\nare things that are with you all the\ntime you never win you just win the\nbattle today you can't ever really win\nthe war I mean you can we'll get to that\nlater but biggest mistake that so many\npeople make with pornography addiction\nis that they try to beat it how do I\nVanquish it and why is that it's because\npeople are tired of dealing with it so\nthe desire to beat it comes out of a\nfantasy of no longer wanting to fight it\nevery day working as an addiction\npsychiatrist the worst thing that I want\nis a patient who thinks they have beaten\ntheir addiction because that's when the\naddiction really trips you up your guard\nis down now that you've won it is people\nwho have constant vigilance until\ncertain neuroscientific changes are made\nthat's really when you can conquer it\nbut for now don't try to beat it try to\nresist"
