    "transcript": "just generally speaking like if someone\nwants to look for a therapist like how\nshould they go about that\nit's a great question so i'm gonna\nreserve my answers for\nprimarily the u.s um because systems are\na little bit different\nin in in other parts of the world\nso the first question in the united\nstates is do you have insurance or do\nyou not have insurance\nso if you do have insurance\nall right so that's a big dividing line\nbut the first thing that you can do is\nif you have any kind of doctor like if\nyou have a general practitioner or\nprimary care physician\nyou can ask them for like\nmental health support or evaluation or\nreferral\nso you can say hey i'm concerned i may\nbe depressed and i was wondering like\nif you had any recommendations for like\nhow i could get evaluated or if i could\nsee someone\nso start with your doctor because it's\ntheir job to like connect you to\nappropriate\ncare second thing is\num so\nif you have insurance you can actually\ncontact your insurance company and say\nhey i'm interested in finding a mental\nhealth provider\ncan i have a list of people in my area\nwho\nprovide therapy and then your insurance\ncompany will give you like literally a\nlist\nnowadays like insurance companies have\nlargely moved online so you may just be\nable to search like in\nyou log into your like online insurance\naccount and then you\ncan search and so you can find find\nproviders who take your insurance\nif you find a provider who takes your\ninsurance the insurance will cover most\nof it\nand then you may have to pay anywhere\nbetween like a 15\nand 50 copay depending on you know the\nthe particular\nprovider um and then your insurance\ncompany will pay\nthem anywhere between 100 and 300\nper visit and then you'll pay like 15 to\n50.\nso those are the two simplest ways a\ncouple of things that are really good\nnow is that you can search um their\nwebsites like psychology today is a good\nexample\nuh zen care is another one that's like\nin a few united uh\nu.s cities um that you can search for\ntherapists\nlike in your area and then you can see\ntheir profiles you can see what they\nspecialize in\nyou can oftentimes also search based on\nlike whether they take insurance or they\ndon't take insurance\num so you can kind of find a provider\nthat way\nif you don't have insurance a couple of\nthings that you can do is you can\nlike just put in your location like in\ngoogle\nand type in community mental health\ncenter so community mental health\ncenters\nprovide services for people who\notherwise can't afford them they get\nlike federal or state funding\nto provide a necessary service and they\ncan actually get compensated\nfor seeing you despite you not having\ninsurance\num so they can oftentimes provide a lot\nof free care\nthe other thing that community mental\nhealth centers can do is help you get\ninsurance\nso they can even walk you through the\nprocess of getting like\nsome kind of insurance that may not cost\nyou anything\num so you can get like state medicaid or\nthings like that so\nand the last thing that you can do is\neven if you don't have insurance you can\njust\nask providers uh if they have any like\nfree care slots available\nso i about 50 to 70 of the people that i\nsee in my practice i don't charge money\nfor\nhistorically um and so you know i think\na lot of providers\nthankfully are you know that we're in it\nto help people so\nwe um are you know okay sometimes taking\npeople who can't pay if we feel like we\ncan really help them and\nthings like that so i i don't think you\nknow most providers don't have that\npercentage but most providers will have\nyou know a few slots open for people at\nreduced fees or no fees\num so that's that's what i would say the\nthe next thing is that i would i would\nrecommend that people don't just see one\nperson\nso if you do have the resources or\navailability\nyou actually schedule like three\nappointments with three different people\nlike\ntwo weeks apart and then what you do is\nlike you try\nlike if the first person you don't like\nyou like see the second person\nand if you don't like the second person\nthen you see the third person\nthen you kind of pick your favorite but\nif you like the first person that felt\nlike a good fit and you feel like you\ncan talk to them you can cancel the\nother appointments\nbut i think a lot of times people will\njudge therapy as a whole\nbased on an individual provider and case\nin point you know you can't really judge\nhaircuts based on a particular haircut\nlike it takes a while to find like a\ngood place\nwhere you like getting your hair cut um\nyou know it can take a while to find\nyour favorite restaurant\nand so you can't judge all sushi based\non one sushi restaurant there are\ndifferent kinds of sushi restaurants\nso therapy is the same way does that\nanswer your question\nyeah kind of building off on that how do\nyou know if a therapist is like good for\nyou\nlike is there stuff you can look out for\nyeah so i think the biggest thing is\nlike does the person\ndo you feel like the person understands\nyou and do you guys have like a good\ntalking relationship do you feel like\nyou could come back and talk to this\nperson for like\nthe next couple of months like once a\nweek\nor do you feel like they you know if if\nit felt yeah that's that's really the\nbiggest thing\nit's not about their background it's not\nabout their degree it's not about where\nthey trained it's like can i actually\nsit with this person in a room\nfor one hour a week for like somewhere\nbetween three to six months\nand if the answer is yes then go for it\nlike why three to six months\num well that's kind of the minimum but\nlike the the idea is that you\nyou should have a sense that you can\ncome back and see this person\nover and over again does that make sense\noh okay yeah i was just wondering if\nthere was like any\nlike statistics you're pulling from or\nif it's more just\na long-term relationship that you can\nbuild sort of yeah\nit's more about that okay cool um\nis there like certain kinds of therapy\nthat you should look out for or\nlike it does it depend on the problem\nuh so\ni think you should should try a couple\nof things\nso some kinds of therapy are very very\ndifferent\num so a good like kind of like\ndivision is there's a branch of therapy\nthat's called\nlike based on something called cognitive\nbehavioral therapy\nwhich is a therapy that's sort of like\nvery kind of like rigorous and\nand kind of like it's almost more like\nengineering or scientific\nso they try to help you understand the\nrelationship between your thoughts\nyour emotions and your behaviors so\ncognitive behavioral therapists will\ngive you\nlike exercises and like lots of kind of\nstuff to think about\nand do cognitive behavioral therapy is\nlike\nit's more active um\nand it's not just like sort of talking\nabout your feelings\nthe other big branch of psychotherapy is\nlike psychodynamic psychotherapy which\nis like talking about your feelings\nso it's a little bit more free form\nit can sometimes take a little bit\nlonger to like get to the good stuff\nbut like i think the question is like do\nyou want something that's more\nstructured\nare you someone that like approaches\ntherapy and says in 16 weeks i want my\nsocial anxiety to be like\nbetter to the point where i can go out\nand i can actually engage with people\nwithout\nbeing like anxious all the time or\nare you someone that wants to understand\nlike the roots\nof your problem and like are willing to\ninvest more time\nso it's kind of like are you like root\nfocused or result focused\nand those are the two big divisions at\nleast you know how i'm\nsetting them aside right now in therapy\nis like cbt's\nis like very results-focused very sort\nof like western in its approach it's\nlike let's go for\noutcomes let's go for like improvement\nin particular things\npsychodynamic therapy is like let's help\nyou understand yourself\nand let's help you understand like your\npatterns and things like that\nthose are the big divisions i mean there\nare lots of other kinds but\nall right awesome uh so when\npeople generally go to a therapist if\nthey feel like something is wrong\nso i i guess let me even back up before\nthat so it's like\na sign that you have cancer is like a\nlump or if you have the flu you have a\ncough is there stuff that you can look\nout for that would kind of\nsay you should go to a therapist\nyeah so that's a great question so let's\nstart by remembering that going to a\ntherapist is not\nabout treating something it's about\ngetting something checked out\nright so if you have a lump it doesn't\nmean you have cancer it just means that\nyou should get someone who knows\nto take a look at it so that they can\ntell you whether it's cancer or not\ncancer\nso i would say therapy is the same way\nso if you don't\nknow like if you're feeling sad or down\nevery day or you're having trouble\ngetting stuck\nlike feeling stuck in life and you don't\nknow is it just because i'm lazy or\ncould i have\nlike clinical depression\nthat's when you should go see someone\nbecause it's not your job to know it's\ntheir job\nto tell you and figure it out and help\nyou out\nso the first thing to understand is that\ni think generally speaking people should\nhave a very low\nthreshold to go and see a therapist for\nan evaluation or psychiatrist\nin fact i think it's like i honestly\nthink that everyone in our community\ncould benefit from a mental health\nevaluation\nit's almost like an annual physical just\ngo check get checked out\nnow so that i think sort of answers your\nquestion\nthe second part is like when do you know\nif you really need to talk to someone\nand i'd say that like if you're\nsuffering or struggling\nor you feel like you're not able to do\nwhat you should be doing\nthen i think that's another reason to\nget an evaluation\nso in psychiatry what we look at is\nimpairment of function\nso how do i decide if someone is\ndepressed or sad\nlike as a psychiatrist what i look at is\nis there sadness\ninterfering with their ability to\nfunction are they not able to work are\nthey not able to\ndo school or like is school\nsignificantly impacted\nis work significantly impacted are they\nnot able to maintain relationships\nand so function is impacted then you\nshould definitely go see someone\nokay cool um so like if someone\nthis gets kind of confusing just because\nit's like you can feel depressed without\nbeing\nlike having the clinical depression\nright but if you\nthink or if you have an inkling that you\nhave like depression you should probably\ngo get checked out right\nright you should just go get a value\nrating it's just like a lump that needs\nto be looked at by a doctor\ngoing along with that if someone is\nresistant to\ngoing to therapy do you think that's a\nsign or how\nwould how would you interpret that\ni think that's a question about why\nthey're resistant to\ngoing for therapy right so like what\nmakes you hesitant\nto go that's worth exploring\nso there can be all kinds of answers is\nit because you don't think there's\nanything wrong with you\nis it because you don't think it's gonna\nhelp like you're hopeless\nis it because\nyou don't think it's gonna work is it\nbecause of the label\nis it because you don't want to get\nprescribed medication or you don't want\nto be like\nyou know dependent on something for the\nrest of your life\nit can also be because you want to do it\non your own\nright so some people are like yeah i\nwant to conquer this problem on my own\ni don't want anyone's help i want to do\nit my way and i want to do it by myself\nso there can be all kinds of reasons so\ni think you should look at those\nis there anything do you think a person\ncould do in terms of like\nlabels or judgments because if someone's\nif someone feels there's a stigma to\ngoing to therapy like\nbut they they i don't know how else to\nexplain but they may benefit from it\nlike how could they overcome that\nso if you're talking about overcoming\nstigma i think like the biggest\nsource of overcoming that is experience\nright so like you should be a critical\nthinker\nabout your own beliefs and ask yourself\nwhy do i have these perceptions of\ntherapy or psychiatry\nand then you should try it it's kind of\nlike yeah like i so\nyou know it's kind of like people i mean\ni know most people eat sushi now but\nlike\nyou know when i was growing up like not\nnot many people eastern east texas like\nate sushi\nthey thought the thought of eating raw\nfish was disgusting\nbecause it's like you know you go to the\ngrocery store and you see like the fish\ncounter\nand like you like i'm not gonna eat that\nraw like you gotta cook that\nand and so like you know how do you get\nsomeone to try sushi like you have to\nget them to try it once\nand then like if they try sushi then\nlike most people eat sushi after they\ntry it\nand they're like oh this is actually\npretty good and so i think the biggest\nthing to overcome stigma is to\nunderstand like why do you feel that way\nand what's the harm in like actually\ntrying it\nbefore you make a judgment\nand that's really what overcome stigma\nis actual experience\nanother thing people are saying about\nhesitant to therapy is money i was\nwondering if you\nlike had any resources or ways around\nthat\nyeah so so this is why i think like\norganizations like rise above the\ndisorder are fantastic\nso rad is actually committed to\ndelivering\nmental health services to our community\nin spite of people's like inability to\npay so they get they're a non-profit\nthey get funded actually by the industry\ni think riot games gave them like a\ngigantic pile of money\num and so you know there are\norganizations out there that are\ncommitted to helping you\nso you can check out rad the other thing\nis that if you're a student\noftentimes you have a student mental\nhealth clinic or like you have you know\nuniversity health services\num if you're like a high school student\nif you have like a school counselor like\nso your school will actually provide\nstuff for you\num and and like i said earlier like\ncommunity mental health centers will\nusually provide free services to people\nand then the last thing you can do is as\nyou know send\nemails to people and basically kind of\nbag it can be a little bit humiliating\nbut you can say hey i'd really like to\nwork with you if you find a profile that\nyou like\ni'd really like to work with you i don't\nthink i can afford your rates\nis there any option and sometimes people\nwill say yeah\neven on the therapy websites you'll see\nthat like\nthey have an option for sliding scale so\nsome therapists will even like check a\nbox that says yeah i do a sliding scale\ni mean sliding scale means that they'll\ncharge you like something along the\nlines of what you can afford\nand another interesting thing was you\nsaid that like kind of the diy\num i kind of want to get more thoughts\nmore of your thoughts\nabout that like people who want to kind\nof diy mental health\nyeah so i think that that's reasonable\nbut you should still probably get\nevaluated\nso i don't think that mental health is\nall\nmental illness that requires treatment\nso there you know there are lots of\nstories and people\nyou know myself included that\nchanged a lot of their mental health\nthrough practices that were not\ntreatment and so i think that that's\nokay\nbut like i think that if you're the real\nquestion there about diy\nis like can you afford to take the time\nto figure things out and what are the\nconsequences if you fail\nso when i really think about mental\nhealth services and when not to do it\ndiy it really depends on time\nso if i have like a sophomore in like\nlet's say college\nand like they're struggling with\ndepression i would try to get them in\ntreatment\nfast because if they [ __ ] around for a\nyear and their depression causes them to\nlike fail a few classes\nthat can alter their trajectory for the\nrest of their life\num it can affect chances to get into\ngrad school it can get affect\nyou know job prospects and things like\nthat so depending on the consequences\ni i do think that sort of like so i\nthink it's worthwhile to get evaluated\nand see if you actually have like a\nclinical thing and then let the\npsychiatrist or therapist weigh in about\nlike you know\nwhether treatment is necessary or not so\ni have\na lot of people who come to me and they\nsay like i don't want medications and\ni'll say okay i think they'll help you\nbut if you don't want it what i'll do is\ncome up with a plan for them and i'll be\nlike okay like let's set some targets\nso i'm going to teach you how to\nmeditate we're going to talk once a week\nwe're going to track these particular\nthings and if by a certain time\nyou don't see a certain kind of\nimprovement\nthen i'd like to talk to you about\nmedications again\nand so the diy route i'd sort of think\nabout it like that like think about it\nlike\nyou know what's your target and when are\nyou expecting results by\nand if you don't see those then you\nshould really think about getting help\nand then the other thing about diy is\ni'd go ahead and get evaluated and make\nsure that it's safe for you to like not\nyou know to avoid treatment for some\namount of time or delay treatment\nanother thing people are saying in terms\nof\nuh resistance to going to therapy is\nthey just feel like hopeless um it's not\nlike they're suicidal but they just\ndon't\nthey just feel like everything is a\nwaste of time there's like no point\nliving\nhow like how would you even begin to if\nyou're that person\nhelp themselves or if you know them like\nhelp them\num so that's kind of hard\nright because what i actually do with\nthose people\nis not something that i can advise on\nstream\nso what i actually do with those people\nis like\nyou talk to them about why things are\nhopeless and like you don't try to\nconvince them otherwise\nyou actually like try to see their\nhopelessness for what it is\nand meet them where they're at and then\ntogether\nyou try to work with them to see if\nthere's like any road\nforward\nwhich i know is like so so that's that's\nlike so people think that what we do on\nstream is therapy and like what i\nactually do in therapy is like quite\ndifferent\nand and so so you know it's it's\nactually meeting people where they're at\nwhich is like okay if you feel like your\nlife is hopeless like tell me about that\nlet's talk about why your life is\nhopeless and then\nyou you don't disagree with anything\nthat they say and then you see like\nafter they've laid out why things are\nhopeless\nis there anything left that's worth\nexploring\nand that's usually what works but i\nthink that that's a very difficult\nprocess to do on your own\nbecause generally speaking if you had\nlike most people who were hopeless\nweren't born that way their hopelessness\ncomes\nfrom having hope trying something and\ngetting shot down\nand then trying something else and\ngetting shut down again\ntrying the third thing the fourth thing\nthe fifth thing the sixth thing the\nseventh thing and getting shot down\nseven eight nine ten times 11 times 12\ntimes\nand so it's really hard to ask someone\non their own who's been shot down\nso many times to try to find hope\nand and so like all you know is failure\nthen like\nit's hard for you to by yourself kind of\ncome out of that\nso i guess what i would tell those\npeople is understand that like that's\nyour experience\nbut other people may be able to help you\nwith that\nbecause at the end of the day like the\nproblem for people who are hopeless is\nthat\nthey've been living their lives on their\nown\nand like it can really help to have you\nknow you like you're playing a\nmultiplayer game single\nplayer like it's kind of like you can\nget an npc henchman\nthat can supplement your weaknesses and\nyou would be amazed at what you can\naccomplish\nright it's like if you're playing like a\nfighter or rogue and you have like a\ndedicated healer just like\nsitting there like casting buffs on you\nlike you can do a lot better at life\nand so it's not wrong for the rogue to\nthink that they like\nthey're gonna fail because they just\nkeep on wiping like you can go into a\nraid boss\nas a single person and wipe over and\nover and over and over and over again\nand then you can logically conclude\nthere's no way like this boss is ob the\ngame is broke\nbut like get a healer and then try\nwhat's interesting about that analogy is\nsomeone just said use people but it's\nlike it's a mutually beneficial thing\nright sure\ni mean generally speaking they get\ncompensated right so you're not using\nthere's an exchange but sometimes they\ndon't get compensated and that's okay\ntoo\nright as long as like both both as long\nas both parties are aware of what's\ngoing on so like when i do see like a\nfree care patient like\ni know they're not paying me they know\nthey're not paying me that's cool\ngo for it bro no problem with that as\nlong as both sides are aware\ni think using people sounds like\nmanipulative\nbecause i think there's like there's a\nlack of transparency\nbut i think if you know if someone how\ncan i say this like if you're if you've\ngot a flat tire on the side of the road\nand someone like pulls over and they try\nto help you with your flat tire\nthere's no confusion that this is a\none-way relationship that's not gonna be\ncompensated which is fine\nyou could say that you're using them to\nhelp you with your flat tire\nbut as long as you're transparent from\nthe beginning i think that's fine people\nit's okay to like\nhave a one-way relationship that's not\neven\nusing people implies that it's\nmanipulative or you're like\nhave an ulterior motive so that's\nhappened to me too\nwhere people will tell me yeah no like i\ncan i can pay you\nand then they won't pay me that's\ndifferent i'd be like just\ntell me you can't pay me and i would\nhave been fine with it but it sucks to\ntell me that you can pay me and then\nlike you don't pay me\ni don't know if that was too far no that\ni think that explains it\num switching gears a little bit i was\nwondering if there's any limitations to\ntherapy\nor like i'll start there yeah\nyeah so i'd say the biggest limitation\nto therapy is therapy is not going to\nfix you\nso like therapy is like you know like\nthe healer and rogue analogy\nlike the healer's there to heal you but\nlike you still have to do the dps\nthe healer's not going to down the raid\nboss for you he was just going to heal\nyou\nhe's still got to do the work so a lot\nof people\ncome to therapy thinking that if i show\nup here\nfor one hour a week for the next six\nmonths my problems will be solved\nnot how it works the patients that have\nbenefited the most\nfrom my therapy are the ones that do the\nwork\nbetween our sessions and for for that\nit's like i'm telling you guys\nit's night and day so\nyou know the biggest limitation of\ntherapy is it's not like another medical\ntreatment where like you go\nto let's say you know if you like have\nappendicitis you go into the hospital\nthey like literally remove your appendix\nand then you leave the next day and the\nproblem is fixed you're done\nthat's how western medicine works it's\nlike my arteries are clogged\nyou don't have to worry about exercise\njust come into the hospital\nwe'll take a vein from your leg we'll\ngraft it onto your heart\nand you'll be good so western medicine\nis very much\nand this is the relationship that we\nhave with our providers is like all\nabout\ni'm going to show up my doctor is going\nto fix things for me and then i'm going\nto leave\nit's kind of like a mechanic for the\nbody but therapy is not like that\nso if you're showing up expecting to be\nfixed by your therapist\nyou're not going to get much help\nyou got to do your part that's the\nbiggest limitation of therapy\nand then so i guess you can't already\nanswer the question but more\nspecifically are there any other common\nproblems with therapy\nlike that people face and it's a little\nbit of a caveat but\nlike your thoughts first are there\nyeah i mean so\ni mean i think there are a lot of\nproblems with therapy as a field\nbut i don't know if that's like about\npeople like people\ncommon problems that they're that people\nlet me think about that\nyeah so one thought that i would have is\nthat if you're doing therapy for a while\nand it doesn't feel like it's working or\nhelping\nthen consider finding a different\ntherapist\nand the other problem i guess\nwith therapy is kind of contrary to that\nis that sometimes it can be hard to see\nchange\nso they're like change over therapy\nhappens slowly and you don't really\nnotice it\nso it's kind of like you wake up and you\nlook at yourself in the mirror every\nmorning and you look the same as you did\nthe day before\nbut then you look at a picture of\nyourself five years ago and you look\nlike a completely different person\nso therapy is the same way where\nyou know you can like it can feel like a\nproblem it can feel like you're not\nmaking any progress\neven though you are\nwhich can be part of the problem but\nyeah so i'd say that's another just\na caution about therapy more so than a\nlimitation that you may not be able to\nsee the progress but it could be\nhappening\nactually okay so like\nare there signs when you should end\ntherapy then\nyeah when you're feeling better or\nyou're ready to move on\neasy yeah i know it sounds weird but\nlike\ntrust yourselves guys like how do you\nknow when it's like\nwhen you when you're done playing a\nvideo game\nlike how do you know right like so i\nknow a lot of people feel like they're\nnever done we can make lots of jokes but\nlike how do you know when you're like\ndone for\nlike how do you know when you're ready\nto play a new game like how do you know\nthat you just know\nlike ah this shit's boring now let me\ntry something else so with therapy like\nyou'll know\nand your therapists will know too right\nbecause they're going to be tracking\nthings for you and it's kind of like\nso i have this conversation with people\nwhere sometimes they come in with\ndepression we work on the depression for\na while\nthen one day they come in and then we're\nlike okay so like\nyou know things are pretty good and then\nit's like okay so now we're sort of done\nwith depression\nis there something else you want to work\non so like that phase of therapy is over\nand then like there could be like\nanother phase\nwhich is actually for me more like\ncoaching so i usually have like i'm a\npsychiatrist first and then i like move\ninto coaching\nwhich is what i really like doing it's\njust not treating something that's\nbroken it's like helping people\nlike find meaning and purpose in life\nbut anyway sorry for going off\noff topic there oh um should you change\ntherapists based off of tackling\ndifferent issues that's probably\nsomething you should talk about with\nyour therapist\nso some therapists specialize in\ndifferent kinds of things\nand i think it's reasonable to find a\ndifferent therapist for a different kind\nof issue\nand at the same time i would just talk\nto them about it\nand see what they say be like hey i'd\nlike to work on this is this something\nthat you think we can work on together\nor would you you know should i try to\nfind a different kind of therapist\nso like a lot of it comes down to just\nlike being\nhonest and talk about things you want to\ntalk about with the therapist right\nbecause it's kind of weird because i\nwould\nsee how people would want to hold back\non saying stuff like that\nyeah so that's a great point absolutely\nso i think the thing that you all need\nto remember about your therapist\nis that you can tell them pretty much\nanything and it's actually like the cool\nthing about it is it's like the one\nspace where you get to say things that\nyou normally don't say\nand and i don't mean like racial slurs\nbut like what i mean is you can go\ninto your therapist's office for the\nfirst time\nsit down and say hey i really don't want\nto be here\nyou could that's gonna be the first\nwords out of your mouth i don't think\nthis is gonna work\ni think this is a waste of my time i\nwant to be able to do it myself\ni think what you guys do is a crock of\n[ __ ] and i don't want to be here\nand that would be the best thing you can\nsay to your therapist your therapist\nwill be\noverjoyed\nyou can say hey i don't think this is\nworking i'm bored\ni've been doing this for a few months\nand i don't feel like i'm making any\nprogress\nall good stuff completely fine to say\noh what should you do on your first\nsession\nwhat should you do in your first session\nyeah you should walk into your\ntherapist's office and ask them that\nthat's right a lot a lot of these\nquestions seem like\nquestions you should ask your therapist\nlike\nshould religion be used in therapy\ni mean it can't it can be\nso i tend to have a pretty spiritual\napproach to the kind of therapy that i\ndo\nso much so that one of my supervisors\nbasically once so one of my therapy\nsupervisors once fired me\nsort of and she was like i don't know\nwhat this guy is doing\nbut it's not therapy he's talking about\na lot of [ __ ] that i don't understand\nand it's not therapy\nso i mean i think you can have religion\nand spirituality can\ndefinitely have a place in therapy um\nbut that's sort of dependent on the\nperson and dependent on the therapist\ni tend to bake a lot of it in because\nbut then i also ask people for\npermission\nso i'll be like you know i sort of have\na spiritual background like is it okay\nif i like\ninclude that in the way that i talk to\nyou\ngenerally speaking though most people\ncome to me because they're looking for\nthat\nand this is why we have websites and\nprofiles so that people can pick what\nthey're looking for\num i i don't know how to like put this\nin a question but can you\naddress the i need dr k kind of type\nrequests\nthat people are like you are the only\none who will\nlike help yeah so\ni'm gonna ask permission for to play a\nclip for you\nguys from someone\nso there was so so you know so i do\ncoaching\nand we also have coaching groups right\nso you guys can sign up and\ndepending on the role of the dice you\ncan get paired with different people\nso i run a group and the group ended\nrecently\nand so we were just kind of offering\nfeedback about the end of the group\nand i couldn't have said it better\nmyself but one person was like i came to\nthis group because i thought dr k\nwas the only one that could help me like\ni was convinced that he was the only one\nand he understood me so well\nand he's he's the only one that could\nhelp me\nafter 16 weeks of working with dr k i\nrealized that\ni never needed him and that like really\nwhat i needed\nlike the only person i needed was myself\nand that's the truth and that's like the\nbest feedback that i could get\nis everyone has this perception that\nwhat you guys need is me but like that's\nyou all don't\nneed me you know it's kind of like just\nbecause you watch a cooking show and\nthere's like an amazing\nyou know like like those amazing\nfive-star chef or whatever who's like\nmaking this food like sure that food\nthat dude makes delicious food but\nthere's like delicious food all over the\nplace\ni know that a lot of people feel like\ni'm the only one for them and believe me\nit's flattering but i think you guys\ndon't know me as well as i do\nand i think you'd be surprised at what\nyou're capable of is if you put your\nmind to it and work with\njust anything like really any therapist\nit's about what you guys put in not\nabout what we put in\nthe last thing that i want to say i'm\ngoing to read something to you guys\nokay so there's a post on our subreddit\nright now\nthat says today's chat with zach and his\nfather dave is probably the most\nincredible thing healthy gamer has ever\ndone\nso i want you guys to think about this\nfor a second\nwhat makes that incredible\nbecause it's not me right so like i'm\nthe constant and healthy gamer but what\nmakes that so impactful is like zack and\nday\nlike sure i'm the common element but if\nyou really think about it like why are\nlike the reason that some things are\nimpactful and other things are not\nimpactful if it was me then everything\nwe\nwould do would be like equally impactful\nbut it's not\nit's the person who comes on that makes\nthings\nimpactful or not that's where the money\nis\nthat's where the value is the real value\ncomes from you\nyou just think it comes from me because\nyou always see my face\nbut if you really think about it the\nbulk of healing\ndoesn't come from me\nit comes from the people who come on\nstream it comes from you\nand so for those of you who think that\nyou you need dr k like i don't doubt\nthat i could help you\nbut i i really am like not that special\nthe thing is what i i mean i fail too\nand what what causes me to fail or\nsucceed\ndepends on the person sitting across\nfrom me because i can't fix\nthem they have to fix themselves i'm\njust going to help\nand so the real thing that you need for\nyour success is not me\nis you if you show up and you give it\nyour best effort with a therapist i\nthink you're gonna do a good job\nand that's what we hear from people\nright like\neven zach on on wednesday's stream was\nlike yeah i started seeing a therapist\nand i've i've gotten a little bit better\nturns out he's probably gotten a lot\nbetter\nbut like he didn't need me like i don't\nthink any of y'all\nneed me specifically\ni know it sounds weird but the real\nmoney is on\non you it's like there's no i mean that\ndoesn't it's just how it is\nso like kind of going along with that it\nfeels like people think there's almost a\nskill gap within therapy\nbut it's more about the person\nundergoing therapy\nright there's a skill gap i mean there\ncan be a skill gap in therapy though\nright so it's\nlet's be fair so just like any\nprofession\nthey're good therapists and they're\nshitty therapists\ni think the money though is that like\neven if you guys get a\nlike let's think about healers right\nlike there's an amazing healer in\nan mmo and then there are shitty healers\nin mmos\nbut most healers do a like a pretty good\njob\nthey do like good enough and that's what\ni think therapy is\nlike most therapists are good enough and\nthat's really all you guys need because\nthis is where like you have to think\nabout how [ __ ] up are you\nwe have a disagreement about how much\nyou all suck at life\ni actually have a lot of faith that most\nof y'all are pretty decent awesome human\nbeings\nwho are smart and capable and all you\nneed is a little bit of help\nso i think you guys could have an\naverage or above average therapist and\nyou'd get a lot out of it because i have\nfaith in our community\nand if you sucked then maybe you would\nneed a great therapist maybe\nbut i think you guys are actually like\npretty good and so you just need like\nyou need like a basic healer\nyou don't need like a platinum healer\nyou just need like a silver healer\nand you all do good just give them a\nshot\nlike a healer off of craigslist\nabsolutely\nright because you might be not that\nactually no don't do that don't\ndon't call craigslist to look for a\ntherapist yeah but like like seriously\ny'all can carry that [ __ ]\nyou don't need a therapist to carry\nanything\nseriously"
