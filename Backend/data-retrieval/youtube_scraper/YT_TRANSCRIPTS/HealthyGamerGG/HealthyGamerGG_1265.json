    "transcript": "so a couple of other things uh to just\nremember so our coaching program we just\nuh\nopened up a bunch of slots on monday so\nthere should be\nplenty of slots open for you guys we're\ngoing to open up more slots next week\na lot of people are kind of concerned\nabout coaching because of issues of fit\nor they worry like they're going to\nburden people or that they're going to\nmonopolize time or they're not going to\nbe able to connect with other people\nand so one of the things that i want to\nremind you guys is that there's a huge\nselection\nbias um that\nuh comes with our coaching program what\ni mean by that is like\nyou know there aren't like randos in our\ncoaching program our coaching program is\ny'all\nit's the same group of people who you\nknow it's the same group of people who\nwatch stream\nso the goal of coaching and especially\ngroup coaching is to like connect you\nguys with each other\nand and help you guys work through stuff\ntogether so here's a\nuh just a quick testimonial from our\ncoaching program i really enjoy being\nable to talk to someone i don't really\nallow myself to talk to people about my\nissues\nand just lifting the burden is great\nright and i think that's kind of like a\ngood testimonial because i think part of\nthe problem is that you guys\ndon't allow yourselves to like\nbe supported by other people that you\nwant support but then you pull away\nso let's hop in with albert\nyou're gonna have to forgive me i'm a\nlittle bit flustered today and it's been\nchaotic apparently i doxed myself\nearlier\nand then there's the van that tends to\nhappen sometimes yeah\num and and you know then i saw my wife\nenter the van with a stranger\nand then i was a little bit cons\nconfused so then i just literally got up\nand and\nran out to my front yard and left stream\nhanging\nso i'm gonna need a minute to compose\nmyself\nand maybe we can talk about my feelings\ntoday\ndoes that happen often do you ever get\nreverse therapize on your own streams um\nno but that's the first time for\neverything man\nand given what appears to be your vast\ntechnical expertise and\nand manual dexterity maybe you can maybe\nyou know you can help me out for once\nyeah you want to see something while you\ncompose yourself\nabsolutely man i think that'd be awesome\num\nhave you seen a lot of magic or anything\nof that sort in your lifetime\num sort of but i don't know about a lot\ni don't think i've seen a lot i've seen\nsome\nokay um\nso this i guess this is more of an\nexperiment this is not really like a\ntrick\num so like i've recently been getting\ninto chess\nand it's something that like i\npersonally enjoy a lot it's just\na lot of people find it anxiety-inducing\ni find it kind of relaxing\nknowing that like you know everything\nthat happens is kind of just\nbetween you and someone else and it's\nall like within like your own\ncapabilities and your own control\n[Music]\nand so there's like different like time\nformats you know like there's like\nclassical which is super\nlong um and then you have like ultra\nbullet which is just like you have a\nminute\nto just like make all your moves um and\nif you run out of time you lose\nand so the thing that i'm fascinated\nabout that is like with\nlike what the more time you have the\nmore i guess opportunities you have to\nkind of like\nthink out like the best move but when\nyou have no time\nyou're kind of resorting to your your\ninstincts and like\npatterns that you already know and so in\na way if you know someone really\nwell you can like predict what they're\ngoing to do like when you like shorten\nthat time or you add a time pressure to\nit\nand so i've been like really fascinated\nwith that idea as of late and\num i've been working on something that i\nthink speaks to that\nso if you would indulge me for a second\ni'm gonna bring out a giant timer\num yeah\nokay and so basically we're going to\ncreate a card um\nunder some time time constraints and\num i'm just going to ask you two like\nbinary questions like\nuh yes or no type of things or red or\nblue that kind of\ndeal but just to practice i don't want\nyou to think about your answers you just\nsay the first thing that comes to mind\nso we're going to do some unrelated\nthings all right\num pirates are ninjas\nparts um\nlet's see so ninjas\nhow about apples or oranges\napples okay interesting\nand then do one more max pc\npc pc all right we're on twitch that\nmakes sense\nokay so\nhere i'm gonna have a timer and i'm just\ngonna ask you a bunch of card related\nquestions\nokay and we're going to need you to use\nyour imagination for this\nokay okay and\nready set go in every deck of cards\nthere's two types of cards numbers and\npictures what would you like numbers or\npictures\nnumbers numbers all right so we're going\nto\ntake the numbers and we're going to move\ndown the deck leaving just the pictures\nand um there's the jack the queen and\nthe king um which one of those would you\nlike just name one\ncake king and then name a suit\nspades spades the king of spades\nand it took us 24 seconds to generate\nthat card okay and so\ni find it curious that you would end up\non the king of spades so you notice that\nthis deck\nhas been sitting here the entire time\nright yep and i haven't\ntouched it at all i haven't gotten near\nit\nyeah that's correct yep all right so i'm\ngonna pick it up for the first time\nobviously like normally i would just\nhand this to you\num if we were to do this in person\nso right now we have two pieces of\ninformation we have the king of spades\nand we also have\nthe time it took to generate that card\nthe number 24. and so if i count down\n24 cards from the top\nhopefully if i kind of attuned to your\nyour wavelength the king of space should\nbe at the 24th position\nokay all right\none two\nthree four five\n6 7 8 9 10\n11 12 13 14 15\n16 17 18 19\n20 21 22\nthis is the 23rd card so hopefully\nthat's right the 24th card\nawesome man\nthat was really cool thank you\nall right do you feel more at ease now\nwe're ready to\nyeah so what was why the pirates apples\nand ninjas\nor is that i just wanted to like\nsometimes it's like hard to\nlike because there's a timing aspect\nsometimes people are not ready to like\nanswer immediately they'll like think a\nlittle bit so there's just to prime\npeople\nto just say the first thing as soon as\nthey hear it\nso that's really interesting\ni'm just trying to think about you know\nwhether we should do a spoilerina\nno no okay no spoilery no\nokay but that's really cool i i really\nenjoyed your trick albert\nthank you honestly i'm impressed because\ni can almost duplicate it\nthe one thing that i can't do is show\nthe cards face up\nthat's what i can't figure out so if the\ndeck is face down i think i could\nduplicate your trick\nbut i don't think i could do it i don't\nknow how you did it face up\nthat has me thinking\nyeah anyway that that's fantastic dude i\nreally like it\nthank you so is is\nit sounds like you spend your time with\ncreative pursuits\num mostly yeah well i would say\nnow i'm mostly just someone who\ni basically go on youtube i go on reddit\nand i find like a video of something\nthat i'm like wow this is really cool\nand i will think to myself i wonder how\none goes about learning this\nand then i'll start doing research i'll\nwatch go down the\nyoutube rabbit hole watch every video on\nsomething\nand then find like the really nice\nsubcultures and the communities that\nsurround it and then\ntry to like immerse myself in it and so\nin a way i'm more of like a collector of\nhobbies rather than like\nan expert at anything trick i just like\nknowing how things are done and\nkind of like how how far you can push a\nskill or\na sk or a knowledge set and\nand you say you use the word now so does\nthat imply that that's\nit's changed for you recently i would\nsay it's something that\ni've always held at the back of my mind\nlike\neven like as a kid like i was like\nreally into a lot of different things\nbut i was sort of raised in a way where\nlike it's good to have hobbies it's good\nto be well-rounded for college\napplications but\nlike no you can't make a career doing\nthis you know because that's all it is\nit's just a hobby\nand so um i guess for the longest time\nlike i just\ndidn't think it was like worth putting\nin more effort into getting better this\nstuff because there wasn't any kind of\nfinancial gain\nit's just something that i would do for\nmyself and\nessentially like when things didn't work\nout in college and like i didn't end up\ngoing down a traditional path i still\nlike\nlike well music um was the thing that i\nwas studying or ended up switching to in\ncollege\nand i'm like well this is kind of\ndifficult and i don't know if i\nknow how if i'm ever going to be good\nenough to like be\nin an orchestra cause i play the violin\nand so then i switched over to like\nfilmmaking and then\neventually it landed in streaming but i\ndidn't really like know what my niche\nwasn't streaming\nlike i played games but like above\naverage but not good enough to be\nviewed as like a gaming streamer and\nlike my music\nwas good but not good enough to be a\nmusic streamer um\ni think magic was the one thing that i\nkind of stood out\nbut even i think when you do like any\nperformance\nart related thing on twitch you're\nalways going to hit a wall where\nwhen you've over saturated your audience\nwith everything that you can do\nthen people lose interest because\nthey've\nthey've seen every trick you've done you\ncan only do\nso many variations of it before you will\ntap yourself dry\nthere's only finite amount of things\nthat exist in\nthe magic resource you know universe\nand i guess as of late now i'm like well\nif i just\nmake my passion for learning and like\ngetting into all these weird things my\nhobby like maybe\nor like my my job like maybe this is\nsomething that i could see myself doing\nyou know five ten\ntwenty years down the line versus like\nlike only for like a couple years\ni see so it's almost like you're you're\ntaking the\nacquisition of new skills and exploring\na new hobby\nas your constant mm-hmm yeah\nand i think it's something that i've\nalways done but i never\nthought that it could be something that\ni could i guess do for a living\nthat makes sense yeah i mean i think\nthat sounds really cool because i think\nit actually mirrors a lot about\nyou know what people's experience on the\ninternet is which is that we get\nrelatively excited about something and\nthen we kind of\ndig into it for a while and then we sort\nof move on to the next thing\num and and that sounds really cool\nand uh so albert yeah man that that\nsounds cool is there something in\nparticular you wanted to talk about\ntoday or something that maybe i can help\nyou with\num\nsay i like wrote down a bunch of stuff\ngive me a second i just have like a list\nnothing like in particular i feel like a\nlot of it\nis like i have a fairly\num grounded stance and kind of\nwhere i am position like the whole\nuh grand scheme of things but some of it\nis just like okay like these things make\nme feel bad\nand i know why it makes me feel bad but\nthe solutions don't seem to be like\nit's like it's like i'm trying to do the\nthings that i know i'm supposed to do\nbut it's like difficult regardless um\nso maybe you can help me out with that\nyeah i didn't understand\nwhat this sentence meant you said i have\na grounded stance\nin the way that i like where i am\nlike where i exist it's like i know kind\nof\nlike in in i guess like the streaming\nworld and like the content creation\nworld like i know where\nmy position is and all of that um and\nit's like i don't have any\nso here i'm trying to figure out like\nthe best way for me to\njust try to clarify my sentiment tell me\nwhat your position is\nin the streaming world\nso as like someone who used to be part\nof an online streaming community\nand is no longer part of that and is not\nlikely to be\nkind of welcome in that like\num close-knit group of people\num it's like now i'm just trying to kind\nof figure out like what i can do\nas like a solo entity and then\nbut what i've been struggling with both\nkind of like\nbusiness-wise but also like from like a\npersonal\nhuman fulfillment level is\nit's hard to stream when you like\nyou are the only person like in\nlike you are the only person responsible\nfor your content\ni think unlike youtube videos where you\nhave a lot of time to ideate and you\nhave like\nediting and a lot of external things\nthat you can do to spice up your content\nbut streaming you're doing long hours\nand if you're not\ngaming like you're essentially trying to\nmarket your life and like your\ninterpersonal relationships and that's\nlike what people\ntune into what and that someone who like\ndoesn't\nreally have that anymore and also\nknowing that there there's a lot of like\npeople that i would normally want to\nreach out to or be friends with that\nfeel like are cut off to me um\nit's been like a struggle trying to\nfigure out how i can sustain myself\nand also kind of dealing with the\nloneliness of\nbeing kind of like on my own and doing\nmy thing\nyeah and i think yeah i mean\nalbert it sounds to me uh\nso i just want to comment for a second\nabout drama\nso like we're not really here and i just\nwant to make it clear to everyone that\nwe're not here to talk about drama right\nthat's not\nreally what i care about and if that's\nwhat people are looking for they can go\nlook elsewhere\num but what i'm hearing from you is\nactually a story of\nuh rejection what i'm hearing is a story\nof being alone or being part of\nsomething and now no longer being a part\nof it\nit's almost like i mean when i hear you\ntalk what i'm envisioning is like a wolf\nthat's like no longer part of the pack\nand and what i'm almost hearing is like\na a sense of like\nyou know how does the lone wolf survive\num and and it sounds really challenging\nfor you and you're trying to figure that\nout i mean that's that's what i'm kind\nof feeling\nbetween the lines and i'm not saying\nthat from a drama perspective it's just\nlike that i think that's yeah yeah\nyou know and yeah i think\nthat that that's a fair assessment um\nand i think it's like particularly\ndifficult for me because i've always\nbeen a very\nextroverted person um even though like\nmy demeanor is not like the typical\nlike loud outgoing archetype that you\nnormally\num think of when you think of like\nextrovert but i've always been someone\nwho\nlike values friendships and\nrelationships and having like\nbeing surrounded by people and i think\na lot of my struggles comes with the the\nclash of that\nsentiment but also feeling like i want\nto be somebody as well\nat the same time like i want to be\nrecognized for what i have to offer\nand but i'm also you know\nbut i struggle with wanting to use the\npeople that i'm\naround and making them happy um often at\nthe cost of my own personal ambitions\nand so just to\nbasically i guess these two ideas always\nclash with\none another what do you what do you mean\nwhat do you mean by that that\npeople you want to make the people\naround you happy but at the cost of your\nown personal ambition\ni'm like the most conflict diverse\nperson like ever\nlike if someone wants me to do something\ni will do it um even if i don't\nnecessarily\nlike if even if it's not good for me or\ni don't have the time for it\nor i don't have the resources for it\nbecause like i'd rather\nsee them like succeed and do well and be\nhappy\nthen um like do what's best for me in\nthe moment\nand i think i've always thought that\nlike oh i can do all this\nand because like that's just the kind of\nperson i am and like took pride in being\nsomeone who could like shoulder a lot\num and like as of late you know in the\npast year or so i realized like that's\ndefinitely just\nnot true something that i've told myself\nlike\nit's like a false identity i've given to\nmyself you know\ni think i've i'm just really good at\nlike repressing and internalizing\nfeelings like over like long long\nperiods of time\nokay and some of this just stems from\njust the way that i've\nalways dealt with conflict as a child\nyou know it's just like people won't be\nmad i won't be upset if i disagree with\nit or do whatever they tell me\nand so that's and it's gotten me to like\nwhere i\nam to degree right so i'm like if it\ndidn't if it\nif it works you know why stop doing it\ni know that's obviously not not a\nhealthy mindset or\nnot the way you should approach\neverything um but\nalbert can i think for a second yeah go\nfor it\nso my first thought is boy you've been\ndoing a lot of thinking haven't you\nthat's all i've had time to do so\nthat's all i've had time to do do i\ndetect a little bit of\nfrustration in that sentence\num maybe not frustration but just kind\nof\nacceptance um you know i've had a lot of\ntime\ni took a year cynicism maybe that's the\nbetter\nyeah cynical like yep this is this is\njust how things are\nthis is it'd be like this sometimes and\ni'm just trying to make the most out of\nit\nyeah and there's a lot right you've\nthought\nwhat are you feeling right now\num at this very moment\num\nit's not catharsis i feel like i'm\nsaying things that i've said\nor that i've like thought about and\ntalked about a lot\num you know privately to a lot of like\nclose friends and family\nso it's not something that i feel like\nthis is a revelation for me\num i do a lot of journaling so\n[Music]\nwhat what am i feeling is neither\nit's like very neutral like i don't feel\nlike it doesn't make me feel\nparticularly good but i also don't feel\nbad for like okay saying this so okay\nyeah so sometimes we can perceive\nneutral\nsometimes it's neutral and sometimes\nwhat we perceive as neutral\nis actually something that's more like\nbittersweet\nright so bittersweet isn't really\nneutral but are you feeling neutral or\nare you feeling bittersweet\nobviously more like bittersweet so\nthat's what's like feeling from yeah\nright there's there's hurt there\nbut there's also positivity\nyeah and and it's interesting but i i i\ncan't tell if your face is really\nneutral or i'm reading into it or\nare um it's the lighting\nbut i actually see a fair amount of\nbitterness\njust right behind your eyes for lack of\na better term\ni take off my glasses will help no leave\nthem on no i don't think we need to see\nit\nit's okay all right um\nso let me ask you so so albert here's\nso first of all i i think you know for\nlack of a better term i'm gonna say i'm\ni'm impressed or\nor maybe excited or um\noptimistic some some combination of like\nwhen i see how much you've thought about\nthings and how you've already started to\npiece things together i feel\ngood about it because i feel like you've\ndone a lot of the work that i\ndo like i start doing with people and so\nyou've already actually done chapter one\nand for example you've recognized that\nyou're conflicted first you've\nrecognized that you\nstarted to become conflict averse in\nchildhood you've recognized that that\nhas worked for you in some ways that\nit's\nit's an adaptation but that at times\nit's become a maladaptation\num and and i actually\nhave i i think\ni know this is going to sound weird but\ni i think i have more hope for your\nfuture than you do\nwhich is weird because we haven't really\ntalked about how much hope for your\nfuture you have\nand i think the reason that i have more\nhope for your future than you do is that\ni think there are some options that feel\nclose to you which i don't think are\nclose to you\num and then maybe we'll we'll work our\nway there maybe i'm right maybe i'm\nwrong i mean\ni don't really know but and\nand so you know if you want to steer the\nconversation you're more than welcome to\nif there's a particular thing that you\nwant to learn how to\nyou know talk like get over or whatever\nthat's fine otherwise i i've got\na gigantic pile of questions to ask oh\nfire away i'm you know i don't like\ntalking about myself that much\nlike first yeah i want to know more\nabout myself\nwhy don't you like talking about\nyourself\num i\ni just don't like making things about me\nit just feels\ni don't think it's my place i don't feel\nlike people don't care so i don't want\nto\nlike bother them with like inanity of my\nlife\nhow long have you felt that way\n[Music]\nmaybe since like middle school\ni think yeah can you tell me about\nmiddle school\nkind of i'm trying to remember i think\nthere's like\ntwo things going on here\ni think one thing is i think i was\nalways a very good child\nyou know like straight a student wasn't\nall the extra curriculars i was in\nband orchestra tennis team like\nyour parents must have been very proud\nthey're very proud but i think\nbecause i did everything well um\nthere was like my there was like nothing\nto criticize me on so like my dad would\nend up\ncriticizing me on like the most like\ntiny things like\nwhy don't you capture toothpaste after\nyou finish brushing your teeth\nlike can you like i'm very flat-footed\nso he's like you know you should think\nmore about picking up your feet and i'm\ngetting these huge arguments with my\nfather like why it doesn't matter am i\ndoing everything else right\nand then um and i think that was the\nmoment\nat least personally aware she's like i i\nhated just like getting into yelling\njust my dad and i would cry like every\nday for i think two years\num and then suddenly just like turned\noff where it's just like\ni just stopped crying all together for\nthe next like\n15 years um\nand then in school i was like\nmildly bullied like i don't know like\nthis could just be my\nversion of the vents like now that i'm\nolder i'm like maybe this is not what\nactually happened but i just thought\nthis was and it became like\nsuch a huge part of the narrative of\nlike who i was as a person but there was\nthis girl\nwho's like on the cheerleading team and\nyou know i was like very\nvery scrawny not athletic i was like the\nlike last np\nall the time you know and my school was\nvery athletic i think\nhad i gone to a more normal school it\nwouldn't be this case but i was running\nsix minute models and i was the slowest\nguy in my class as an\nas an eighth grader um\nand so i had a lot of like\nself-conscious umness about\nmy appearance and my physical ability\nand\nso there's this girl who would always\njust like\nwho claimed that she like was in love\nwith me um but was\nvery iced my perception was she was very\nout of my league\nand so every day when i would go to\nhomeroom she would like\nhide behind like a door and like jump\nout and like hug me\nand then it just made me feel very\nlike that i was i was being made fun of\nin a way that i couldn't like\nlike show or resist because like oh it's\nlike why are you complaining about this\nyou know it's like a attractive girl is\nlike hugging you\nand saying she's in love with you but\nthen she would like call like she would\nlike\nfind my phone number and like call my my\nphone or\nmy home phone this is back before i had\na cell phone\nand then you know like i had to hear\nlike laughing in the background so like\ni'm pretty sure it was just\nto like make me feel uncomfortable and\nso\ni think at that point like i just never\nfelt like i was like\num someone that people like want to be\naround or it's like i was always\nsomeone that will kind of had in their\ngroups so that\nthey could like make fun of\nyeah i'm not someone who other people\nwant to be around\nand i think that's partially why like\ni felt like the desire to like get into\nso many things because i wanted to\nprovide value whether it's like music\nor magic or like any number of things\nso what i'm hearing from you is that\nyou know if you could bring something to\nthe table then people\nthen you would be worth caring about\nyeah i think that's the case because i\njust didn't have any confidence in like\nmy personality or\nyou know my\nare you okay are you okay just sitting\nfor a second and just\nfeeling what you're feeling or do you\nwant me to distract you\num i'm good i okay i like this pulling\nwhat's this feeling\ni think um\ni think just being able to share\nsomething that has been bothering me for\na while\nso that feels good and what bothers me i\nthink it's something that i'm\njust like being aware of like how much i\nlike don't like myself\nso albert what's it like to be someone\nwho other people don't want to be around\nand to be cut off from the pack\nsorry it's heavy yep\ni'm gonna start crying in a second\ndon't a lot of people start crying on\nthis show do you do do you cry\nsympathetically\ni mean i cry i don't i don't know\nabout other people\nyeah um it's lonely\nfor sure\nand a lot of it has to do with like\nguilt\nnot feeling like\nlike i can feel bad about my situation\nthat makes sense because it's like\nself-induced\nso\nokay albert i need you to i need you to\nlet me know if you need so\ni'm gonna tell you something that we\ncall coming up for air okay\nso you know sometimes we're gonna get\ninto heavy places\nand then um you know if you need to come\nup for air you let me know and i'll like\nbreak the tension\nso we'll you know is there like a like a\nsafe word\nit's like i need it um i mean so my\nstandard with usually\nuh men is as we uh make a dick joke\nokay because usually penises are funny\num okay and and so i guess our our safe\nword is going to be dick joke\nokay um\nbut you just you know you let me know i\nmean i i can see that you're able to\ntolerate some of this and i think we're\nmaking progress but\nyou know at the same time i um\nit doesn't it doesn't have to be\nhow can i say this i imagine that you\nthink that you are someone who has to be\nable to tolerate\neverything right and you can't\nyou can't come up for air you won't let\nyourself come up for air\nbecause not coming up for air is the\nright thing to do\nyeah right so just notice that like even\nthat\nand and so learn how to forgive yourself\nfor\nnot being able to do all this\nand so i think maybe i'm gonna have to\nuse the safe word because i i don't know\nif you're gonna\nfeel\nworthy enough to say hey actually this\nis too much for me\ni think the thing that i struggle with\nis\nor like regarding this particular\nideas a lot of like the kind of things\ni'm\ngoing through right now it's like i feel\nlike i don't have\nlike i'm not privy to those\ntoo\nit's like i'm not allowed to feel\nsadness or\npain towards my own situation why not\nbecause\nlike i mean because like i'm the one\nthat\ncreated it right and so it's like you\nknow\nit's like well if you didn't [ __ ] up\nthen you wouldn't like be in this\nsituation so like stop complaining\nkind of deal yeah\nand so like i just and i don't that's\nwhy i don't like talking about it\nbecause i'm like\nno one wants to hear someone talk about\nlike how\nyou know shitty they feel because of\nsomething that they did to like other\npeople\nyeah what i'm what i'm hearing you say\nis that you're not allowed to suffer\nbecause it's your fault\nwell that's how i feel at least like i\nknow it's\nit's not necessarily like like it\nshouldn't be the case you know i think\neveryone's how do you know\nthat where do you say i came from\njust things i read my own therapy\nsessions it's just like\ni think the lived human experience is\nimperfect\nand we're all going to make mistakes so\nif no one's allowed to feel\nbad for like anything then that's just a\nvery sad\nexperience of being alive yeah so that\nsounds philosophically wonderful to me\ntell me why doesn't any of that [ __ ]\napply to you\ni think a lot of it ties into just like\nbeing like a internet figure\nand like having so much of\nlike what i say or what i feel being\njudged through like the lenses of like\nthousands of people\nyou know it's like there's no winning\nright it's like if i\nif you know if i don't if i'm emotional\nthen it's like i'm\ntrying to get sympathy i'm trying to\ngarner sympathy\nand then that's manipulative and if i\nlike don't emote\nand i'm just very like stoic and very\nyou know like business then you're like\ncold then you're cold\nand so my solution is i just don't use\nit i just\nlike i i feel like i can't post anything\nthat isn't like\ninherently valuable or good because\npeople are just gonna like just like me\nmommy or [ __ ] on me like\nlike twist whatever i say into like the\ncontext that they think\nyou know is like the most hurtful\nand so like i know like that stuff hurts\nme so i\nso i just don't use it i will only just\npost\nmy content and i i will just like not\nread any of the comments\nand then let's go about my day until i\nhave something\nelse to do albert i i totally get that i\nthink social media i would say amplifies\nthis\nand at the same time i think that you\nhave been\ntaking away your capacity to suffer long\nbefore any of these people on the\ninternet ever showed up\nand if we're talking about you know\nreally moving forward it's about finding\nthe origin of these things\nright what we're talking about is like\nhow does it feel to be the kid\nthat all the other and forgive me for\nbeing a little bit racist here let me\nknow if this is offensive you know that\nall the other asian kids hate because\nyou're the kid that when they\nbefore they go to bed their parents tell\nthem why can't you be more like albert\nyeah and yeah i grew up in fresno so i\nwas like one of the only asian kids\nactually at the time so\nso my experience being an indian kid was\nthat you know\npeople my parents always compared me to\nthe other indie and still do\nand then and then the thing that's\nreally bizarre about that is like i'm\nlike mom what\nwhat more do you want i'm i'm the kid\nthat all the other parents are comparing\nto now like and you're still like\nyou know i i used to joke that i'm\nevery indian parent's\ndream and every indian kid's nightmare\nhmm yeah and i think i was like that\nmore\ngenerally speaking just like\nlike on paper i was like i was like the\ntextbook child\nyou know um\nyeah and so albert\nwhat does it feel like to be the\ntextbook child and have your dad be\nunhappy with you\nwhat is it like not knowing yeah you go\nahead sorry\nit's like not knowing what you can do to\nbe better\num and so it's just like at a loss\nand and like i think at the time i felt\nlike no matter what i did to like\nimprove like there would just be\nsomething else that was missing\nlike there's this never-ending\nlist of things that like why aren't you\nlike better at this or why aren't you\ndoing this better and a lot of it wasn't\neven like\nlike at this point it was never about\nacademics you know because the academics\nlike\nsure before i went to college and where\nlike i\ni realized like that didn't matter as\nmuch as i used to think you know like i\nhad never\ngotten anything below like 100 on\nanything\nbecause our school offered a lot of\nextra credit for you know\nkids who like needed it so like if i got\nif i ever got below 100\ni would like beat myself up like\nnot not like in a self-harm kind of way\nbut more like\nyeah emotionally i would like punish\nmyself\nwhat would you do to yourself\num i don't know like i would sometimes i\nwould not speak for\nlike a week because i was so upset\nand what what made you upset\num that i like made a mistake\nand whose fault is it\nand so how did you treat yourself when\nyou [ __ ] it up\nalbert you got a 99\nyeah just not happy\nyeah and it became like a thing where\nlike then my friends would make fun of\nme\nfor not getting 100 as well you know\nlike i had\nso and well they thought it was good but\nit reinforced\nlike they were doing it jokingly but\nthen i think for me it reinforced that\nidea and so when people on the internet\nsay things about you what does it do to\nyou\num i guess it's more like what i know\nit'll do to me\nbecause i i really have not read\nanything good\ngo what do you know\num\ni think at least from like\nso what happens is my my close friends\nwill like spoon feed me stuff\nright they'll they'll be like all right\nthis is like maybe the worst kind of\nthing people are saying this is like\ngenerally people are like saying these\nnice things right and then\nbecause i want to know like even if i\ndon't want to know the specifics i want\nto know the general sentiment\nbut usually the stuff that like hurts\nthe most are the are not the\nlike single and like [ __ ] you or go die\nlike those ones\ni know it takes a certain kind of person\nto like be in a place in their lives\nwhere\nlike they can type that to like a random\nnobody that they don't know\nright it's like that stuff doesn't\nbother me at all it's like the\npeople who are writing like long essays\ntrying to like\ncycle analyze me from like the comfort\nof their own homes\nand i think sometimes like there's a\nglimpse of truth and like that stuff\nhurts\nor the other ones where it's like i know\nit's like just\nstraight up false but it sounds\nconvincing enough that i feel like i'm\nbeing misinterpreted\nand i think i have this deep fear not of\nlike owning up to my mistakes\nbut being misunderstood or like\nlike not not feeling like people have\nthe wrong impression of me\num but believing that to be the case and\nbut i know there's nothing i can do or\nsay to like convince them otherwise\nit's just like a futile battle where did\nyou learn that convincing people\nwho had the wrong impression of you was\nfutile\num i'm trying to think about it in my\nactual day-to-day life but the internet\ni just feel like\nthat's just the general sentiment where\nlike if people are determined to hate\nyou\nlike no matter what you put out what you\nsay they're going to feel that way until\nsomething in their own life shifts\ni mean it sounds to me like you're\ntalking about your dad again\nyou know not to overly psychoanalyze you\nbecause i hate doing that [ __ ] right\nbecause i'm i'm just envisioning like\nyou know like who did you feel you are\nwho did you try to be and what did your\ndad see\nright he just refuses to see\nlike not just straight a's hundreds\nacross the board baby\nand then he chooses to pick a fight i\nmean it's just\nit's so misunderstood it's so\ndisconnected\nit's so judged and then i'd i'd say that\nsome\nsomewhere in there your dad would also\nsay things if i had to hypothesize i\nmean i don't mean to say this is all\nabout your dad but like\ni mean come on you know like yeah\nwhatever yeah i mean i'd say a lot of\nthings\nlike probably like you knew 90 of what\nhe was saying was like wrong and like\nyou knew you're like dad what\nit's just a [ __ ] toothpaste gap\nright yeah and you would tell yourself\nthat 90 of the time\nbut then 10 of the time he'd say\nsomething that would stick\nright and and over time what i'm i'm\njust i'm just thinking like what is\nwhat happens to a 13 year old kid who\nlike\ncan never do right\nright can never do enough what does that\nkid start to think about himself\nwhat does he start to believe about\nhimself\nand yeah go ahead\ni don't know i thought you were about to\nsay one more thing\nyeah so i mean i i think he says what\nyou say\nthat in order for people to like in\norder for me to bring\nvalue to the table it needs to be some\nsomething super concrete\nthat like it has to be something that no\none can refute because like\nlike who i am is like not enough\nright and i i'd say i'm just envisioning\nyou know if we really want to try to tie\nthings together\nyeah in in a overly simplistic\nand probably unfair way it's going to be\nlike i mean\ni don't know man like you know when we\ntalk about these phrases like\nself-esteem\nand confidence in who you are and\nand accepting yourself for who you are\nand and i'm also i'm just going to keep\ngoing and you can cut me off at any\npoint\nand then i also think a little bit about\nyou know the things that you tell\nyourself and what you've learned to tell\nyourself\nwhich is that if you do everything right\nand it's your fault\nit sure as hell is going to be if you\ndon't get any forgiveness when you do\nanything right\nwhy on earth would you get any\nforgiveness if you do even an iota of\nsomething wrong\nif you get a 99 you're not happy with\nthe 100 or maybe you are happy or maybe\nyour dad's not happy but if there's a 99\nlike\n[ __ ] that you don't deserve a break\nand so with whatever happened like it's\nyour fault so like you don't deserve a\nbreak you don't deserve forgiveness\nand then we also get to this this\nfeeling of being trapped right where\nlike you're\nyou're like i you know i can't win this\ngame\ni can't win if i show emotion\nthey say i'm being manipulative\nand if i don't show emotion they say i'm\nbeing cold\nyou strike me as a guy or kid who just\ncan't win no matter what you do\nit's really hard to\nbelieve that you can't win\nto try to convince yourself that you can\nfind some kind of\nniche that you can\nkind of like come back\nthat if you try hard enough to show\nother people that like\nyou know if you work really really hard\nand you can\nyou can sort of overcome like that core\nsense of like\nrot and decay about like who you are\nand that's hard man it's a hard way to\nlive life\nso despite being so [ __ ] pessimistic\nwith my imagery\nthe reason i'm hopeful for you albert is\nbecause i think you actually\nare wrong i think you're not rotten okay\nso\nand i think you have value and i think\nthat for a long time you\nlike there haven't and it sounds like\nyou've had people around you try to\nteach you that but\ni i fundamentally don't think that\nyou know i just don't think you're a\npiece of [ __ ]\ni think the reason that you heard\ngiggling in the background when that\ngirl called you\nis because her friends put her up to it\nand she's like if you like him call him\nand then she calls you and then her\nfriends are giggling in the background\nbecause\nshe's calling you i don't think it's an\nelaborate\nyou know joke that they're making fun of\nyou\ni think that's what teenage girls do\nwhen they put their friends up to\ncalling their crushes\nyou know i i wouldn't know though i\nnever got one of those phone calls\nanyway i came up for air there yeah at\nthe end\ni can tell you yeah appreciate it\ni'm also doing some of the lifting you\ncan pick it up\nall right um i'm at the pen or the\nconversation either one\nbut yeah what's interview meant which\none you're talking about\ni have oh you've got a backup okay one\nthis is a knife\nyeah but it's not a real knife so\nyeah i i just feel like i just i just\nneed to fidget with stuff because i have\nso much anxiety\nyou're super impossible and there's a\ncertain level of satisfaction of being\nproficient with\nlike seeing progress like when you work\nat something and then like sure\neither see the progress or you can feel\nit\nyeah and so i i'm very like like\nthat's something that's always i've been\ndrawn to that\nyeah so if you want to get super\nanalytical there right there's two kinds\nof\nprogress there there's one is that like\nthere's a certain satisfaction over\nmastery and then there's also the sense\nthat like\nif i can see myself getting better i\ndon't\nhave to look at my intrinsic lack of\nvalue\nbecause you see here's my external value\nlike i can do this and now i can do this\nand now i can do this and it's just an\nemphasis\non positive feeling from the external\nworld\nand a sense of mastery that other people\ncan't deny that you yourself can't deny\ni think it's a bit of both i think so\ntoo\ndo you wanna i know you were about to\nsay something and then\nyou let me continue so i don't know if\nyou wanna share anything or\ni'm trying to see if there's any like\nengine points\nor like further things because like\nbecause you mentioned in the beginning\nthat it sounds like a story about\nrejection\num and like i think a lot of or the way\nthat i've perceived a lot of my life is\njust like a series of rejections\nand a lot of both like personally\nbut also like objectively not getting to\nthe college that i wanted or\nyou know like having like a lot of um\nlike putting myself out there and like\nlike for crutches whatever and like\nbeing rejected\nor job opportunities\nso i think i focus a lot on those as\nlike kind of\nas kind of like defining moments in my\nlife rather than kind of\nmaybe the things i have accomplished and\nlike i know this to be the case but\nit's like my brain just goes there\nso am i hearing the question of what do\ni do about that\nno it's just more like\nwell\nyou know i don't i don't know\ntell us yeah\nsorry go ahead i just feel like a lot of\nthe things i think about her is like i\nknow this is how i feel\nso now like how do i like kind of\nreprogram\nwhat i'm like how am i trying to\napproach all these things so that i\ndon't\ndo well on it so much great that's a\nthat's a fantastic question\num so i think\nso once you have one of these like core\nbeliefs about yourself\nright i think i think your rejection\nsensitivity comes because\nso albert what i see is within you\nthere's a war\nbetween\nwhat you know\nshouldn't be true and what you believe\nabout yourself\nright like you can look at your life and\nwhen you're tranquil and you're\nlevel-headed you can say i've\naccomplished a lot\ni'm a good person you know i support a\nlot of people\ni'm a good friend i'm allowed to make\nmistakes\nand then inside there's also like this\nkind of fear this belief that you carry\naround that you're none of those things\nthat you're a cause for suffering for\npeople around you\nthat you don't have value that all you\nbring is unhappiness\nand there's this kind of war and then\nsometimes what happens is like something\nhappens in your life\nand i think what's been going on is like\nthe positive part of you has been\nwinning\nand then the negative part of you when\nsomething happens the negative part of\nyou is like see\nsee i told you i told you all along\nthat's not who i am\nand so how what do you do with that\nright what do you do when you start to\nwhen you have that voice inside you that\ntells you that\num you know that you're not worth it and\nthat you're not a good person\nand that unless you bring something\nconcrete to the table unless you\ncan make people smile or laugh with\nmagic tricks\nthat you're not worth being around\nhow do you deal with that it's a good\nquestion\nso i'm going to give you kind of like a\ntwo or three part answer and it's going\nto be a little bit academic\nokay the first is that yeah\nsay safe territory uses our mind not our\nheart\nso the first thing is that each of these\nemotional insults is an\nunprocessed trauma or something that i\nwould call a some scar\nso some scar is like something that is\nlike an\nundigested emotion that then goes\ndormant into your unconscious mind\nand over time builds up like basically\nwhat happened is that\nyou know for two years you said every\nday you used to cry and\nto a certain degree you were starting to\nprocess those emotions\nbut i don't think that there was anyone\nthere who could sustain\nthe positive albert during those times\nand so each one of those moments each\none of those conversations\nyou kind of built up this like\nportal that would spawn like negative\nthoughts and feelings\nand so the problem right now is that\nyou've got that portal in your\nunconscious and it spawns these thoughts\nright like literally if you look at the\nway the nature that the mind works\nit's like you're going about your day\nand it's like literally something just\nspawns in your mind\nright it's weird it's like a it's like a\nbubble machine that's just like\ngenerating\nthese like thoughts about you and and so\nyou can kind of acknowledge that you\nshouldn't have those thoughts but\ni mean that that machine is in there\nthat belief is in there and as long as\nthat belief is there it's going to start\ngenerating these thoughts\nso the question is okay what do you do\nabout it one way is through emotional\nprocessing\nso that's like doing something like\ntherapy where you go and you talk about\nthese things and you cry and then like\nwhen you cry you feel a little bit\nbetter\nthe main thing is that the some scar\ngets digested a little bit gets digested\ndigested digestive digest\nand if you do that work for a while one\nday you'll kind of be free from it\nso that's kind of like a psychological\napproach a therapy approach\nthe other thing that i'd say which i\nthink is going to terrify the [ __ ] out\nof you is that i think that there's like\na spiritual or karmic approach\nand i think what that means is like\nactually going and and\nyou know like having conversations with\npeople that you've wronged\nrecognizing that like although you're a\nwolf who's been cut from the pack\nthere is a certain peace that comes from\nresolving that and what i mean by\nresolving that is like going and like\nhaving conversations with people and if\nyou want to be a part\nof that group again if you miss that\ngroup\nyou know if if you've if you've made a\nif there's a rupture\nbetween you and someone that you care\nabout you try to\nyou try to fix that now fixing it\ndoesn't mean\npractically like rejoining something or\ndoesn't i'm not talking about business\nwhat i'm talking about is like a karmic\ndebt right\nof like going back and and trying to\nlike make things right with people and i\nthink there's an\nimmense amount of strength and then also\nacknowledging that like and this is the\nthing is\nuntil you try that you're carrying it\nand if someone says [ __ ] you i never\nwant to see you again\nyou can at least be a little bit calm\nwith yourself that like you tried right\nand if they if they don't want to\nforgive you and and that's\nlike totally fine but like you [ __ ] up\nand i tried to make it up to you\nand if you don't want me to make it up\nto you that's entirely your choice and i\ncan respect that\nbut i can also respect myself a little\nbit because i tried to fix it\nyou know and i think this is where\nfrankly i mean i think this is like\nwhere\nhonestly sometimes i kind of differ from\nmy colleagues because\nthe thing about therapy is they tell you\ni mean i'm i'm\nabout to dis therapy but i think it's\nsort of true\nyou know what we're taught is therapists\nwhat we're trained to do as therapists\nis to work in the room right we're going\nto come and we're going to talk about\nyour feelings but you never have to\nreally do anything\noutside of the room that's the whole\nscope of therapy\nand there's a part of me that says that\nlike ultimately\nyou have to do things outside of that\nroom you have to do more than\nemotionally process you have to take\naction\ni think we leave something really\nimportant\nbehind when we don't try to take action\nand i'd say\nalbert if you've made a mistake in your\nlife it's not about whether you get to\nfeel or whatever it's about like trying\nto [ __ ] fix it man\nright and you have to give it your all\nto try to fix it i don't know if you\nhave\ni don't know you know\nyou're laughing so i'm i'm guessing\nyou've got an answer for me there\num i think i've done as much as i could\nlike like in a reasonable way so\nit's like i think i've already done that\num\nand so so now it's like now that i know\nlike the position\nabout how things are it's like now i'm\ntrying to just deal with like\nmoving forward as like myself that makes\nsense\nsure yeah it wasn't like i\ni like stopped talking to everyone and\njust like all right\nlike i tried having those like\nconversations\num and then you know it's just like kind\nof like\nthis is just how it's going to be and\nthen\nand then to like live our separate lives\nkind of deal\nyeah so so do you feel at peace with\nthat\num\ni think it's more like it's like the\nbittersweet thing right\nwhere it's um and also it's like this is\ngiven time right like i i don't know if\nlike you're supposed to revisit these\nthings like you know like\nthere's like a protocol for like okay\nafter this amount of time we should\nmaybe revisit this topic again\nthese people um but it's the kind of\nthing where it's like i've just been\ntrying to\nlike like knowing kind of the general\nstate of things\nkind of being okay like making new\nconnections and trying to\nnot be so tied up with i guess past\nrelationships\nand try to like make new ones that i\nknow like\nat least there is more of a risk\nreciprocity\nin terms of like kind of the um\ni guess emotional labor and kind of time\nspent\nand like i know it's not like obviously\ndidn't feel great for me but i\nalso knew like this is their choice this\nis their decision\nand like i'm not going to be one to try\nand pose my own\nwill on other people because like i know\nbecause i want it\nso yeah so you made a comment early in\nthe interview\nalbert that actually made me think that\nlike you said something like there are\nthings that you want to say or people\nthat you would want to reach out to\nbut that you don't something along those\nlines\nand and does that do you remember that\nor does that ring a bell or do you and\nso what keeps you from reaching out\num well one is fear\nothers rejection or both\nrejection um\nand also like also the fear of being\nmisunderstood\nyou know it's like i'm reaching out what\nfor what\nmeans or what purpose am i doing this is\nit because\ni'm trying to like build my business\nam i trying to you know like work my way\nback into certain parts of like\ncertain communities it's just like i i\njust feel like unless someone reaches\nout to me\nthen like any action that i have like\nreaching out to someone else is going to\nbe\nviewed like in like the most negative\nlight and i don't know\nthat true but that's just like my fear\nand like i'd rather not risk it\num for something like that and what does\nreaching out\nlook like it's like\nit's like hey wanna hang out or it's\nbeen a while\nlove to catch up or if it's someone that\ni i don't know it's just\nkind of kind of there's there's some\npeople that i would want to like\nother content creators and that's kind\nof how i've always operated in the past\nas well\nit's like if i think what someone's\ndoing is really cool or\nwhat they do is really like i feel like\nconnected to like their work\nor whatever they do as their jobs like i\nwant to reach out like i want to\nsee we can be friends um\nand so a lot of like i have a lot of\nfear\nthat like people don't want to talk to\nme because\nbecause i myself don't offer enough as\nlike an individual\nas aura as like a content creator as an\ninfluencer that the risk\nof potentially like being on the bad\nside of other people\nis going to supercede the immediate\nvalue that i give\nso it's like if someone finds out like\nthey've been talking to me or they're\nworking with me\nand then it's like okay maybe these\npeople like it's not like i don't think\nanyone would be like no you can't work\nwith this guy\nbut it might kind of i guess in a\nbusiness\nor in a scene that is so\nlargely based off of your relationships\nand like\ngood vibes towards people and like\nvouching for people you think are cool\nit's like any and like how hard it is to\neven like break in\num in the first place\ni think a lot of people just wouldn't\nwant to take that risk\nespecially since i'm like much smaller\nso\nand there's like so i have a lot of fear\nregarding that\nit's like i don't want to hurt other\npeople's chances by like either reaching\nout to them or\nlike having them work with me so i just\ndon't unless they reach out first\nand there's there's been some people who\nreached out and i'm\nvery grateful for it but even then it's\nlike it can never be in any meaningful\npublic way\nbecause of you know just like how it'll\nlook or like it might be disrespectful\nfor\ncertain like two certain people and like\ni understand that and i acknowledge that\nand you know it's like i would love to\nlike talk to them more\nor like spend time with them but i know\nit's just like not a\nit's not a possibility given the current\ncircumstances\nand so there's a lot of kind of\nbittersweet feelings towards that as\nwell\nwhere it's like i feel like i can't i\ncan't be i can't ask for more\nyou know like having some people talk to\nme is better than no one\nso it seems to me like talking about\nthis is actually more comfortable\nfor you\ni think i thought about this more so\nmaybe that's why\nso i i think there are a couple of\nreasons for that one is it\nsounds like you've thought about it more\nthe second is that i think this is more\nfrom the present\nwhereas a lot of the heavy emotion i\nthink is like some scars from the past\nright these are like\nthoughts and beliefs like i'm not\nsomeone who other people want to be\naround\nlike i think you've felt that way for a\nlong time\nand so what happens is like when the\nthings that are heavy from the present\nday\nare the ones that reinforce that belief\nfrom the past does that make sense\nwhereas this you know sounds like there\nreally is a business side to this\nthat that you really you know and i\nthink the really tricky thing about this\nis that i think that that business side\nis like you know seems really legitimate\nlegitimate to me but i also see you\nyour kind of emotional\nshackles holding you back from making\nprogress here\nand what i mean by that is that you know\ni think it's\nlike like it sounds like you kind of\nsaid earlier that you put other people\nfirst\nyou know and you always felt like other\npeople are more important than you are\nand so what you're doing is you're even\nthe risk that you could potentially\ntaint someone's career\nkeeps you from taking a shot at doing\nsomething that you find like\nfulfilling and and happy\nand and if we really think about it\nthat's that's really\nkind of very caring and also kind of\nshooting yourself in the foot\nright which is what you were saying and\ni think some of this stuff has to do\nlike you said with your fear of\nrejection\nand and i'm curious what would that\nrejection look like i mean what do you\nimagine\nwould happen um\nwell it's also happened like actually i\ni did try it like a couple of times\nand then do you feel comfortable sharing\nthat i\nfind myself being really curious what\nthat actually looks like\ni mean it's not like a um basically like\ni asked someone like\nhey can i hang out and then they're like\nlet me check\num and then there but there's bases like\noh they're not comfortable with this\nthen\ni'm like okay that's and then that was\nthat\nand then i kind of there was like\nsimilar like\nthings on like a similar vein um and so\nit was never like it was never like very\ndramatic it was just like\nyou know it's like feeling is there\nand so people just want to respect okay\nand how do you feel about how do you\nunderstand\ntheir choice\nit's like\ni think when you're like because i'm\ntrying to think about it from like their\nperspective right\nit's like i'm no longer like the friend\nthat they're closer to\nso it doesn't make sense to kind of\ndo something that you know that your\nyour closer friend is gonna\num or like people that you're close to\nare going to be more hurt by\nthan to like kind of\nextend that like kind of hand of\nlike empathy or compassion in that\nmoment\nand especially if like people have\ndoubts about like my character or like\nwho i am as a person\nright and it's like i don't know like\nmaybe this guy is just trying to weasel\nhis way back into like being successful\nor\npart of something\nthat sounds tough man\nso i'm just trying to stay in my lane\njust do my thing it's kind of like\nwhere i've been at or i've been telling\nmyself but obviously it's hard\nand it's like i've been alone for so\nlong that i kind of like forgotten\nlike what it's like to be lonely\n[Music]\ni remember in the beginning it was like\nthe feelings of like\nisolation were like way more intense and\nthen covet happened and then\nkind of everyone else was feeling what i\nwas feeling but at that point i was so\nacclimated to it that i'm like\nmy life is no different well\npostpandemic and\nlike during the pandemic why do you\nwhy do you try to stay in your lane\nbecause i feel like\nlike i just don't want to stir up\ntrouble for people you know it's like i\nknow\nlike i don't like i've only been\nstreaming or i've been like making\ncontent for like a month now\na month and a half it's like i haven't\nproven myself to like kind of\nbe better or\nso until like i feel like i've\nseems to me like you want to feel worthy\nagain\nwhat's it like to feel unworthy\nso\nforeign\nnot great for that's for sure\njust like i have like earned it\nyou know yep\nand until i do that like i don't have\nthe right\nto kind of like ask for anything\nso i'm just gonna think for a second\nabout what do we what do we do about\nthat\nwhat is that shrug when i asked that\nquestion\nand i don't know\ni think albert the real the real\nchallenge here is that\nthe real challenge real real challenge\nis that that i honestly think that your\nroad forward\nis not alone\nand i i think here's you know we do this\nto ourselves sometimes where we think\nlike\nyou know i'm gonna face the rest of the\nworld once i know i'm worth it\nright once i know i'm ready it's kind of\nlike\nyou know i'm gonna take the sat or like\nyou know i'm once i know i'm gonna like\nget a good score i'm gonna practice\nreally hard i'm gonna stay in my lane\ni'm gonna fix myself and then i will\nunleash myself upon the world\ni'll re-enter once i know that i'm gonna\nbe\nlike okay right once people once i have\nsomething to bring to the table\nthere's a lot of there's a lot of what i\nwould call paralytic security there\nthere's a lot of like idea that like you\nknow once i do this\nthen i can feel safe to go out and and\nthen i can approach people because\ni i bring something to the table people\ncan care about me and people can want me\nand and i really do have some value\nand i gotta stay in my lane until i get\nto that point\nthe reason i call it paralytic security\nis because i i think it's paralyzing\nbecause i i think that unfortunately\nlike your road forward\nthat's certainly one way to do it right\nand i'm i'm not saying that's\nthe only way to do it but i mean there's\na part of me that says that\nyou know you got to fix what's broken\nand\nand what i'm hearing over and over and\nover again is like is not that\nyou're going to teach yourself that you\nhave value\nlike what you've missed and what's\nmissing in your life\nis not your own perception of your value\nit's\nother people giving you value and that's\nthe damnedest thing that's the really\nreally hard thing is that sometimes in\nlife you know we always think that like\nwe always think that healing is\nsomething that i can do\nright i can heal myself i can go to\ntherapy i can talk about my emotions and\nstuff like that but\ni mean i hate to say it man but\nsometimes in life the fastest way to get\nbetter is actually like\ndepends on other people and it can be\nincredibly terrifying\nto roll that those dice\nright and i think that the something\ntells me that if if you can\ni think you have to a certain degree but\nif you can keep on\nactually showing them\nbecause here's you have to show them\nyour imperfect self\nand you have to give them a chance to\naccept that because here's the problem\nis that if you stay in your lane and you\nassure yourself that you bring value to\nthe table\nand then you show it to them and they\naccept you what are they accepting\nthey're accepting the magic tricks\nthey're not accepting you\nright and this is what's really got you\nstuck is that you figured out this\nsolution\nyou figured out this thing that if i do\nsomething that other people can't refuse\nthen they'll accept me but that's where\nyou shoot yourself in the foot because\nthen\nthe only thing you're truly doing is\nreinforcing that\nthey're not accepting you\nthey're accepting the rubik's cube or\nthe magic trick\nor the whatever right and so bizarrely\nwhat it does is it reinforces the idea\nthat you're not worth it\nand the real antidote to that is to to\nshow people\nthe half-formed thing right to show\npeople the incomplete thing\nto show people the vulnerable thing to\nshow people yourself\nwhich you're terrified that they're not\ngoing to accept\nthe magic is that when you show people\nthose things\nand they do accept you\nthen it's gonna be really really\nconfusing and really really difficult\nbecause you're just gonna be like what\nthe [ __ ] like i don't understand why\nthis person is showing me value i mean\nwe saw it with your you know that girl\nwho was in love with you you're like i\ndon't understand\nwhat this person can possibly see in me\nand that's exactly what you need to\nencounter over and over and over again\nright you need to be just really [ __ ]\nconfused that people think that you're\nyou have value as a person\nthat you have value out outside of\nmaking them\nfeel better and putting them first\nyou need a lot of confusion in in terms\nof like\nlike why are these people hanging out\nwith me i don't do anything from them\ni'm small\nwhy do they care about me i don't\ndeserve to be cared for\nand there's a part of me that honestly\nsays that's your road forward i mean\nlike\nit's hard it's gonna require courage on\na level that i don't know if you've ever\nfound in yourself or realize that you\nhave but i think it's in there\ni think i think it's it's buried but i\ndon't think you realize that you have it\ni don't think you realize that\nthat you are a strong person and you\ndon't need to prove that to anyone\ni think you your strength built up\neach day of those two years that you\ncried on a daily basis\nand it's in there right because you kind\nof survived and to\neven extent you thrived and then you\nmade mistakes\nand not to say that you shouldn't accept\nresponsibility but i think it's probably\nworthwhile\nalso thinking about and learning to\nforgive yourself\nfor why you made those mistakes and we\nhaven't really talked about that and i\ndon't know if we're going to because\nthat skirts a little bit\nclose to drama but if i had to venture\nwe don't even need to talk about i can\ntoss out a couple hypotheses\nthat's certain that sometimes we do\nthings to not disappoint other people\nand did you make mistakes that were sort\nof egotistical sure\nbut i you know i'd bet money that that\nsprinkled in there\nand and i think that ultimately like i\ndon't know if you've forgiven yourself\nbut like that too\nis an important path that you have to\nwalk which is going to be hard and\nunfamiliar because i don't know\nyou know so we learn from what people\nshow us\nand i don't know if other people have\nshown you forgiveness so i don't know\nhow you're going to learn how to do it\nyourself\nand ultimately i mean i hate to say this\nbut like\nyou know someone who works with people\nwho are suicidal and things like that on\na daily basis what i can tell you is\nthat\nyou know expecting someone who's\nsuicidal and hopeless\nto find that on their own is [ __ ]\nridiculous\nand so where do you get the idea that\nyou can walk this journey on your own\nand i think that's what's so [ __ ]\nhard is like\nstaying in your lane like you can\ncertainly get there don't get me wrong\nlike you can do a lot of introspection a\nlot\nof therapy i think you're well on that\nroad but there's a part of me that says\nthat\nyou know the fast track here is going to\nbe actually like with other people\nthat even if you feel you know if you\nfear that rejection\nthat reaching out to other people and\nsaying hey i've thought about this a lot\ni'd love it if we could reconnect\nyou know and being authentic and honest\nwith them and and also i think you do a\ngood job of this it sounds like you're\npretty respectful of their boundaries if\nthey say\ni'm not comfortable with that so that's\ngood right\nbut to still share with people that like\nyou know i don't know if you've told\nsomeone\nthat you miss them\nright and and you want to be clear about\nnot trying to guilt-trip people into\nlike seeing you and things like that but\nlike\nbut there are ways to have these\nconversations but i think if you miss\nsomeone\nyou should tell them\nyou know i grow up in a tradition that\nsays that unless you fix this in this\nlife it's going to carry with you like\nyou carry it\nyou know all actions have an equal and\nopposite reaction\nall actions have consequences and what i\nsee in your life albert more than\nanything else\nis work that's left half done\nsay that's fair\nthat's questions\ni guess maybe more fears\ngood very good\ni mean there's also like a question\nright it's like\ni think i maybe made a sound sound like\nlike i have like no friends but i mean i\nhave i have\num like a decent support system you know\neven now\num it's just like i think maybe what i\nmiss most is having like a centralized\nfriend group which i realize now is\nless of them is less normal than i\nused to think i guess i think a lot of\npeople\nwork nine to five jobs and then you have\nlike friends that you like\nconnect with but you don't like see them\nevery day and like that's like normal\nexistence and i think that's why\ncommunities on twitch of like streamers\nare very like attracted to\nviewers because\nbecause it's kind of like what you wish\nyou had in your own life\nthere's like this kind of parasocial\nrelationship\nand this kind of living vicarially\nthrough other people\nand i think having like tasted that it's\nlike\nyou know feels good to be part of\nsomething\num but they're it's not necessarily like\nthe right\nlike i don't know if it's necessarily\nnecessary either to like\nwant to go back like to living that kind\nof life\nbecause i think there's definitely to a\ndegree feeling like\nmy like like my relationships with\npeople\nwere like the product that i was selling\nand i think there's a lot of confusion\nthere\nlike involving like like am i friends\nwith this person or is it because\nour friendship like gets us a lot of\nsocial validation\nand like i definitely feel\nlike at some points that that was hard\nto like differentiate\nwhereas like you know i know like the\nkind of\nfriendships i have now with people are\nlike because of like everything that's\nhappened like i know this person's here\nlike showing up for me because you know\nthat\nyou know they're not here for like like\nthe video like the filmmaker\nthe musician the magician whatever um\nso like that's something that i think\nabout a lot as well\nwhere it's like how am i happy to hear\nthat\nand a lot of like the feelings i have\ntoo are\nlike do i miss like\nis it the idea of loss and the feeling\nthat i need to fix something\nthe reason why it feels bad or is it\nbecause i genuinely like\nneed this to be a part of my life\nso yeah i haven't figured i figured that\nout yet\nthose are all wonderful questions albert\nit makes me hopeful for you actually\ni mean the one one thing that i would\nsay and maybe we can kind of segue to\nmeditation in a few minutes but\num you know i'd say that i think these\nare conversations that you should at\nleast try to have\nand it sounds like you actually do have\npeople around you that\nhelp you feel valued outside of your\nperformances which is wonderful\nand so so if that's the case then then i\nthink it's it's really about settling\nyour karmic debts it's about\nyou know i i i mean there are a couple\nof things here the first is that\ni think a lot of what holds us back is\nlike not\nfixing the past and fixing the past\ndoesn't mean returning to it it means\nlike not addressing it\nright like owning up to what you did and\nlike like acknowledging things and\nand sort of letting things kind of like\nlike letting your own mind kind of\nprocess it\ngiving other people a chance to process\nit even if that means\nsending anger and frustration and hurt\nyour way which you should absolutely\nreceive from them and\nand you know take it from them and then\nand then let it go because like then\nthey're gonna be done they're not\nholding on to it\nyou've done your job you can let it go\nit's gonna be hard\nthe second thing is that ultimately i\nthink albert what you need to learn is\nlike\nyou know your road to value can come\nfrom\nyour new friends and things like that\ncan come from therapy and reflection but\nit can also come from\nfacing your own fears and surviving them\nright what you need now more than\nanything else i think is courage\nand and and you're not going to\nrecognize entirely who you are\nuntil you face that fear and even if\nthey reject you\ni i think my hope is that there would be\npeace around that\nthat you can kind of say like hey like\nyou know telling people\nhow you feel and like telling people\nlike hey you know i really valued this\nit was really awesome to have\nthis opportunity and and i'm grateful\nfor it and\nyou know i miss this and then kind of\nacknowledging like\nyou know i don't want you guys to feel\nguilty i really don't\num and if anything i i i would hope that\nwe could\nreally just like have one last\nconversation and put it behind us\nnot trying to get back in um\nand and also whatever i've had\nconversations already\nand how did they go pretty much\nlike it was it was all amicable it was\njust kind of like\nyeah so in a way it's like i'm more\ndealing with\nnow that i know and it's like living\nwith it\nkind of deal living with water\njust like like you know like i try my\nbest but just like because of like\nthe trauma and the damage i've done it's\njust like it's never going to be\nlike truly healed and so like living\nwith that guilt\nand interesting\nso when you say it's never truly going\nto be healed what is healed look like to\nyou\nknow\nlike for me like i like when i even just\ngo on\nthe platform like twitch it's like\nlike i i could never stream like i can\nnever go onto the twitch page because\nthere's too much stuff that like\ni guess like reminds me of thing and\nlike\nso i just and i'm sure\nlike it goes both ways right i'm sure\npeople\nlike not a lot of people feel good about\nlike seeing stuff about me or\nwhatever and\nyeah albert i i think it sounds like\nyou've done a lot of it but i don't\ni don't think you're done man okay i\nmean\njust just something about the way that\nyou're describing things like so\nso i'm i'm very happy i mean happy's a\nweird\ni'm i feel reassured that you've had\nsome of these conversations i think it's\nabsolutely the right step to take\nand what i'm also hearing is that like\nthe wound is still open\nand i don't know what that conversation\nlooks like but i\nyou know maybe it isn't a conversation\nmaybe it's more on your end but like it\nsounds to me like you've done a lot of\nwork\non your own in the last year and i don't\nknow\nwhen you had those conversations\nbut you know sometimes it's worth\nrevisiting\na conversation especially if it's open\nlike sometimes one conversation and i\ndon't know i'm not assuming you just had\none\nbut you know sometimes it takes a lot of\nconversations\nto put things behind you\nand i\ni don't know i mean do you feel like\nyou've been forgiven by the people that\nyou've hurt\ni think what i\ni think these are two separate things\nlike what i've been told\nlike directly and like what i perceive\nto be the sentiment are two different\nthings\nokay so let's acknowledge for a moment\nthat like you don't\ndeserve forgiveness okay so what i mean\nby that is like i think this is a really\ncommon misconception but\nforgiveness is something that the\naggrieved party gets to give\nor not give you're not entitled to it\nand even moving past that i know it\nsounds kind of weird but even if you\nnever get forgiven i think that's okay\nas long as you know that it's never\ngonna happen and that this person is\nlike then you can still move past it you\ncan say\nyou know i [ __ ] up in a way that's\ngoing to be irreparable for the rest of\nmy life so be it let me accept it and\nlet me move on\ni think never being forgiven is okay\nbeing forgiven\nis better but the hard thing is being in\nthat middle space where you don't really\nknow\nright and and there's a part of me i\nmean like really\nalbert it's i mean it sounds like you're\nholding on to a lot of this stuff\nand some of it you know maybe i'm just\nfocusing on this i don't know why\nbut um\nyou know there's a part of me that you\nknow i think it kind of comes back from\nthis like image from the beginning of\nlike you're a wolf that's been\ncut from the pack and it's\nit's hard to be in that position\nand doing everything that you can to get\nback in even if it hurts and i don't\nmean like get back in from a business\nstandpoint i mean like\nyou know reach a place of emotional\npeace\nand then sort of recognizing that like\nyou know i can't be a part of this pack\nbut at least i sort of know that and\nwe're like\nokay with that and the pack is gonna\ncontinue and i'm gonna go find a new one\nlike there's peace there\nyou know you don't have to get back\ntogether with\nyour ex or anything like that like all\nthe rom-coms right like you guys can\nagree that like\ndivorces can be amicable and things like\nthat where it's like\nhey we tried it for a while you know it\nwas challenging but like i'm gonna live\nmy life and you're gonna live yours\nand we can appreciate what we had\ntogether and and we can kind of like\nacknowledge that it wasn't great\nand that like we're better off on our\nown i don't get the sense that you have\nclosure\ni guess that's the the word that i'm\nsniffing around for hunting around for\nwhat do you think\ni guess people usually you know get that\nclosure being like a one-time thing\nwhere it's like you talk about\neverything and then\nit gets sort of feathered\nbut i think it's just with the\nnature of time it's like it's like\nlike i don't know have things changed um\nfrom the last conversation because i\nthink from that perspective\nlike there was closure with people i had\ntalked to\num you know given like the circumstances\nof that time\nand so maybe it's like the uncertainty\nor like\nlike not knowing like you know like\ni have feelings changed has the general\nsentiment atmosphere\nso i'd steer that in a slightly\ndifferent direction what i'd say is okay\nlike\nnow i'll kind of just wrap up this point\nwe can talk about you know whatever you\nwant to after this or you can ask\nquestions but\nhere's what i'm feeling i'm feeling that\nlike so you're right that closure is not\na one-time thing\nright so if you think about let's say\ngrief right so\nabout nine years ago my dad passed away\nand then like i felt grief\nand then you know but like i revisit\nthat grief\nperiodically and i sort of get closure\naround my relationship with him\nat like periodic intervals and it\nhappens like a little bit more intensely\nafter someone passes away but i i just\nhad\na feeling that i hadn't had in a couple\nyears which is that i really missed him\nthe reason that i really missed him is\nthat i was listening to a podcast that i\nthink he would have really enjoyed\nand so i think part of what i'm what i'm\nkind of pushing you towards albert and\nyou know be careful when i push you\nbecause i usually am wrong\nis that that like there's there's a\nthere's a different kind of conversation\nthat you can have now\nafter your year of reflection you know\nyou're in a different place there in a\ndifferent place\nand i think that there's a second\nopportunity for closure\nand there's also like if they're not\ninterested in that that's okay that's\neven\nthat's a closure in and of itself like\nfor other people to be like hey you know\ni'm not\ni'm just not interested in revisiting\nthat part of my life at least you know\nthat and then like you can be like okay\nlike that's\nit's over now but there's something just\nthat feels\nkarmically open to me about this\num i don't know if that\nresonates with you or not that makes\nsense\nyou have any thoughts or questions\ni feel like i've been pushing the\nconversation in a particular direction\nfor the last half hour\nthat's fine i'm i'm always interested in\nlike seeing what someone else thinks\nabout yeah\nall right i i don't have any questions\nabout it that's okay that's totally fine\nlike\nlike i know this is a very real\npossibility and like a very\nreal course of action so like\ni feel like if\nyou know maybe a time and place for it\nand i just don't know when that\nyeah i think albert from what i'm\nhearing it sounds like you're actually\nmaking a lot of good progress\ni think it's great that you found people\nwho can appreciate that you don't have\nto perform for\nand what happened emotionally just now\nwhat\nsomething happened no no i don't think\nso\nokay maybe i just can't read your face\num\nand yeah i mean i think\nyou know keep at it i think it's it's\nworthwhile to think a little bit about\nsome of these things that you said\num you know about sort of these\nadaptations that you have which actually\ncan hold you back in some ways i think\nyou've done a lot of good\nself-reflection sounds like you're\nworking with a therapist or you did work\nwith a therapist so\nyou know that's really good i'd\nencourage you to continue\nlast thing that i'll leave you with is\nwhether you want to learn how to\nmeditate\nor whether you i don't know you hot\ni've been doing it i used to look like\nguided asian abs\nnothing fancy it's like 10 minutes a day\nkind of deal\nand how do you feel about that\nwell like part of me like i'm not even\nsure if i'm doing it right\nlike some of it is just like you\nlike i just feel good after doing it you\nknow more kind of\nfor me it helps put a lot of things in\nperspective just like\nyou know this life\nand i just want to make the most of it\nand\nthat like your feelings and thoughts\nit's like never the situation that\ncauses you unhappiness it's like how\nyou like your feelings and thoughts\ntowards it right and meditation kind of\nhelps me\ntake a step back and view like you know\nthe situation more you know from an\noutsider's perspective\nbeing like you know like this is\nbothering me so much because\nof like how i'm like feeling or thinking\nabout it\num not that the situation itself is like\nharming\nanyone like at the moment\nyeah that's a pretty important insight\nand when you say you're not sure if\nyou're doing it right\nwhat do you think doing it right like i\ni've seen like a lot of sentiments where\nthere's like this\nlike wave of people just doing\nmeditation because it's like\nlike like the pop like the cool thing to\ndo and then like you just do it just to\ndo it and say you're doing it\nand but like it's more of a performative\ntheater thing rather than\nlike actually digging in and trying to\nlearn more about yourself while you're\nmeditating\nand so like i'm not sure if i'm like\nwhich camp i've fallen yet\nbecause there's like no good metrics of\nlike you know\ni'm really in my stride when i'm\nmeditating\nuh versus just being consistent do you\nhave thoughts when you meditate\num try not to\ntry to exist\nbut it's hard like i just in the\nbeginning was very hard\nto just like not think about anything\nyeah i feel like it actually opposite\nwhere it's just like now i'm like racing\nmy mind's just racing\num okay it's slowing down recently\nif meditation could change one thing\nabout your life what would you want to\nchange\ni just want to be\nyou\nthere my headphones died\nhmm\nall right\nso\nhey this one\ni just want to wake up and be happy that\ni'm\nand not feel like i have to\nfight to prove that\nyou know that i'm here\nwell whatever that takes to be at peace\nwith that\nokay\nhmm\nso i'm gonna\nask you to do something okay i want you\nto sit up straight\nthis is gonna be a two-parter two-parter\nin the sense that once you do this for a\nwhile\num i'm gonna teach you so this\nmeditation technique has to be taught\nin at least two parts okay so i'm going\nto teach you part one\nand then down the road dm me or whatever\nif you do it if you do this if you do\nthis like consistently for like three or\nfour months\njust let me know and i'll i'll dm you i\ncan teach you the second part in five\nminutes\nbut i want you to i'm gonna\nsay something so it's gonna be a piece\nof a mantra\nbut i want you to focus on i'm going to\nteach you one piece of it today\ni want you to focus on the generation of\nsound and feeling in your body you play\nmusic\nviolin you said do you sing\nnot really okay great um\nso i want you to focus on the sound that\nit creates okay and and focus on it\nin your in your body\nso that what i want you to do is chant\n[Music]\nokay so close your eyes and focus on the\nsound generation\nand you can be loud about it okay\nnext string\n[Music]\num\n[Music]\nokay less emphasis on the m and more\nemphasis on the first half\n[Music]\n[Music]\num\n[Music]\nnow tell me what you feel when you chant\nthat\nfeel kind of a reverberation\nkind of here okay and then kind of sound\ngeneration\nof the sound like here and it kind of\ngoes\nfrom here um\nokay so i'm going to give you a little\nbit of direction that's great\nso focus on the vibration and what i\nreally want you to do is\nnotice where the vibration starts from\nand where it ends\nokay so practice again do like nine\nrounds\n[Music]\nfrom\n[Music]\nwhat do you notice about where it starts\nand where it ends\n[Music]\nit feels pretty similar okay maybe not\nhere but like yeah it's like it's like\nfrom here down to here\nokay how does it feel to do it\n[Music]\nkind of relaxing but also requires like\na degree of focus\nor at least okay i'm doing it\nokay sure so i'm going to teach you one\nmore practice\nokay i'm going to teach you how to do\nohm chanting\nso om is composed of three syllables\nah and\nokay it's a little bit\nso you're basically going from a\ncompletely open mouth to a completely\nclosed mouth\nso i'll demonstrate\ngot it so we'll do one round together\ndeep breath\nin\n[Music]\nokay\nall right did you feel that\nyeah we're gonna do five rounds together\nokay or five let's do seven breaths\ntogether okay so we're gonna do\nlet's do five rounds together and what i\nwant you to do after the fifth i can't\nhear you anymore did something happen oh\nyeah i'm sorry\ni was on i switched to push to talk so\nwhat i want you to do is on\non um we're gonna do five rounds\ntogether\nand when we finish i want you to sit in\nthe silence\nafter the fifth round and just keep your\neyes closed for about 60 seconds i'll\nprompt you when it's time to\ncome back okay\nokay okay so deep breath in\nagain\n[Music]\nah\ndeep breath in\n[Music]\noh\n[Music]\n[Laughter]\n[Music]\nlast one maximal power\n[Laughter]\noh\nso\nwhen you're ready go ahead and come on\nback\nhow do you feel feel good\num what were you thinking about\nwhen we were doing the practice\nduring the whole thing or just like in\nthe silence either one just what was\nyour experience of it\num generally speaking like\nhaving something to do like focuses a\nlot of my thoughts on\nlike that action i'm like not really\nthinking\nabout stuff it's like\nyeah focusing on your breathing cases on\ntone projection\nso yeah so so that's the goal\nokay so like so the first thing to\nunderstand about meditation is that\nthe practice is about focusing so if you\nreally\nthink about it technically as your focus\nbecomes one pointed you don't have\nthoughts\nif you are observing where a vibration\nexists within your body\nthat is not actually thinking it's\nobservation\nso thoughts are like discrete entities\nthat come and go\nright let me think like oh i'm a smart\nperson i'm a stupid person whatever\nthat's like a thought so it starts with\nfocus\nand then as you practice over time\nas you focus on one thing then your mind\nwill sort of melt away\nand then that period of mindlessness\nwhich is bizarre because everyone talks\nabout mindfulness it's not about\nmindfulness it's about mindlessness\nit's about being free of mind will\nlinger into the period of silence\nthe other interesting thing is that for\nyou especially i think feeling the\nreverberations\nof the second half of the i mean like\nthere's chanting and then there's\nsilence which is like\nkind of an echo of the sound i don't\nknow if any of that makes sense\nbut i think really sitting in that place\nis going to teach you\n[Music]\nthat what you are\nis fine and what i hear is that every\nday when you wake up\nwhat you are is not fine and if we think\nabout what that feeling of not fine is\nit comes with a lot of thoughts\nit comes with a lot of like not\naccepting like this core\nsense of who you are the ways in which\nyou are not fine have to do with your\nactions and your worth\nand other people and all of these things\noutside of you\nthey're all about the ripples you judge\nyourself based on the ripples that you\ncause in life\nwhereas like those ripples are created\nby all kinds of things but at the core\nis you and you actually don't make any\nripples\nit's all of your like psychological\ncomplexes and some scars and your\nemotions and your attachments\nthat's what creates ripples you don't\ncreate anything\nand so the more that you begin to sit\nwith like just the quiet version of\nyourself you'll begin to realize that\nlike\nall this other crap is not really who\nyou are\nbut you literally need to spend time\nwith yourself in silence\none last thing i want oh yeah the last\nthing that i want to say albert is that\nthe other thing that you need is\nshould be so should be means cleansing\nwhat i get from you is that you're\npolluted by a lot of your thoughts a lot\nof your actions\nyou hold on to things that make you not\nbe able to see who you are\nand we need to cleanse you of that so\nthe last thing that i'm going to do and\ni've tried to avoid doing this on stream\nbecause it has a religious connotation\nto it\nare you religious i am not\nokay i'm gonna send you something called\na kirtan\nso kirtan is a religious hindu song\nso it's like it's like pakti oriented so\nit's like about as hindu as\nyou can get and at the same time i've\nbeen struggling with this for a long\ntime\nin terms of how can you take the value\nof kirtan which is\nessentially purification and like\nremove the religion from it and i\nhaven't been able to figure it out so\nthe last thing that i'm going to do is\ni'm going to send you a link to a song\nit's about 12 minutes long and what i\nwant you to do is listen to it\nevery day for seven days and if you\nif it doesn't feel good to do that at\nthe end of day seven\nthen just stop doing it but if you feel\nsome degree of peace or\nlike cleaner after you listen to it\nthen by all means continue and then like\nlet me know and then we'll send you some\nadditional stuff i really try to avoid\nthis because it's like\nyou know it has a it has a religious\nrecommendation it's not you're not going\nto understand the words\nyou're not going to understand any of\nthis [ __ ] it's in a language you're not\ngoing to know\nyou know it's not like worshiping\nanything really\nthere's just a very purifying aspect to\ngirtham like in the\nhindu tradition they sort of say that\ndoing this sort of stuff will clean you\nout\num and it's not you don't have to\nbelieve in anything\nyou know you're not signing up to be\nanything it's just like purifying vibes\nand i'm just curious it may help you and\nif it doesn't no big deal\nall right i'm i'm always down to try new\nthings so okay\nso i'll send it to you okay\nanyway any last thoughts or questions\nbefore we wrap up\ni mean no not really i mean i'm just\nhappy to be here talk to another person\nso yeah man i'm i'm really glad you came\non and\nand albert man i feel for you bro you\nknow i i don't think you deserve\nwhat you live with on a day-to-day basis\nand and i really hope that\nthis conversation and maybe some of the\nthings that i recommended help you\nnot have to carry around what you carry\naround every day\nyou deserve some of it but not all of it\nsound good i'm good\ntake care take care of yourself okay\nwell dude adios thank you"
