launching a bunch of spots\nor opening up a bunch of spots\nin our coaching program so if you guys\nhaven't been able to get into the\nprogram we hope that you all will be\nable to get in on\nnovember 9th coaching for those of y'all\nwho don't know is not a medical\ntreatment so it doesn't\nit's not designed to treat depression or\nanxiety or anything like that\nit's really for people who feel kind of\nstuck unmotivated\ndon't know how to kind of move forward\nin life um\nmaybe feel like they don't know what to\ndo with themselves or things like that\nit's basically like designed for the\nproblems of our community\nwe're you know if you really think about\nmedical treatment it's like\nanti-depression right like so\nlike antidepressants we're not really\nlike anti-depression we're more like pro\nhappy\nso it's about building a life that's fun\nfinding a community that you enjoy\ndoing like helping yourself helping you\nlearn about your behaviors and what\ncontrols your behaviors and your\nemotions so that you can start acting\nin a way that's aligned with your values\nand so that's that's a big part of what\nwe do in coaching\nand today we actually have a stream to\nkind of hopefully reflect on some of\nthose\nissues so we're going to be talking with\nsomeone from our community about\nself-esteem and confidence\nso we'll see where that goes\nokay and welcome um thanks for coming on\nand and what's your and what do you go\nby\nminnie minnie and what are we talking\nabout today minnie\num i was like\nyeah of course oh my god she's using my\nown techniques against me\ni'm just really nervous i can't think\nstraight\nokay um you can think crooked no big\ndeal\nyeah just in a second okay\nokay do you want to sorry nope for what\nfor using my techniques against me yeah\ni said this day would come they said\nwhat is dr k gonna do when someone's\n[Laughter]\nyeah so what are you nervous about it's\nokay to be nervous\noh um i don't know i've been nervous\nthis whole week to\nto talk to you and like be on stream\nokay but um let's start with what does\nthat mean\nyou've been nervous all week can you\ntell us about that um\nlike uh my heart wouldn't\nlike stop beating if i thought about it\nand like\ni just my stomach hurt all the time and\nlike oh my god\nsorry that sounds really oh\nwhat are you sorry for\ni don't uh like\ni don't know okay do you feel like you\ndid something wrong\ndo you feel like you did something wrong\njust now\na little bit yeah it's weird right yeah\nyeah sometimes we feel like we do things\nwrong\nand so if i were to tell you i don't\nthink you've done anything wrong\nhow would you what happens\nin you if i say that\num i think i'd have like\nsplit uh reactions like\none would be like oh okay he doesn't\nthink i did something wrong\nbut then the other would be like well i\ni feel like i did something\nvery good yeah yeah it's weird how that\nworks right\nso there's a part of you that is\nreassured and then there's a part of you\nthat's\nnot reassured yeah yeah\ncool were you were you nervous about\ndoing a bad job\nyes well you're doing an awesome job\nreally because even when you share with\nus that like hey there's a part of me\nthat would be reassured and there's a\npart of me that would be like\ni'm still doing a bad job he's just\nbeing nice\nyeah i'm actually messing up right\nand and sometimes i didn't even do\nanything yet\nright so so here's the thing so if we\nreally look at that\num minnie it's like the feeling of doing\na bad\njob doesn't actually come from our\ninteraction it doesn't come from\nanything that you do\nit just comes from you\nyeah right and you're doing a great job\nbecause this is exactly what people\nwith is what we're here to do you're\ndoing it even if you do a bad job that's\nstill a good job because people\ncome here to do a bad job and then we\nlearn about it\nand so you can't you literally can't do\na bad job\nbut you can try i like your room\nsorry uh no it looks great thank you\nwhat do you like about it i like the\nchair\nin the back yeah it's a cool chair\nsorry what did we mess up again\nno no i um i'm just getting flustered\ni'm okay\nokay okay it's okay to get flustered\nit's gonna be a painful hour and a half\nminnie\n[Laughter]\ngood luck with that\ncan i drink some water please absolutely\ndrink water stay hydrated\nwe're gonna need it um\nso i understand that you wanted to talk\nsome about self-esteem and\nand confidence yeah can you tell me what\nyou mean by that\num so\nhmm where'd i start so i\ni've kind of when i was little i didn't\nreally\nstruggle with like confidence issues\nlike i thought i was really cool and\ni didn't worry too much about like\nmessing up or anything\num i mean i did but it wasn't\nto the point of like you know shaking my\nleg and\nuh having a panic attack but\nuh but like\nin i think near the\nend of middle school and then all the\nway up till now\num i i've\ni i've been noticing that i don't\nreally feel good about myself\nat all okay i kind of just hate myself\nokay um yeah so i guess\nthat's what we're here to talk about\ncool\ni mean you know not cool that you do\nthat but cool that you're here to talk\nabout it\num and i i noticed that when you say i\nkind of hate myself you laugh\nright and and what's your understanding\nof of\nwhat you feel when you say that and why\nyou laugh\num well i kind of laugh\nwhen i talk about my prob like problems\nbecause i feel like if i\nsay it in a serious tone um people are\ngonna think that like\nit's too much and\nyeah yeah okay\nso i guess i just like laugh when i\nwhen i'm saying something\nuh regarding like my mental health\nsure so when you say people are gonna\nthink it's too much\nwhat would be too much about it\nwhat's more than people can handle what\nmakes it more than people can handle\nwell i think\nwhen\nwhen someone talks about like\nif they're feeling sad or upset or\nanxious or something\num i usually think that\npeople won't like to hear about it so\nyeah because yeah because that kind of\nstuff\nlike spreads what do you mean that kind\nof stuff spreads what does that mean\nlike i think\ntalking to someone with\num anxiety and depression can like\nat first you can it can be helpful to\ntalk to them but like you can also get\ntrained in the process of like\ntalking to them so i don't want to do\nthat to other people\nokay so what i'm hearing you say is that\nsometimes\nyou can it can feel good to talk to\nother people but then\nyou can almost become addicted to\nburdening them yeah\nyeah definitely okay so i noticed that\nyou said that's a\ngood word yeah yeah yeah\ni choose my words carefully um\nso let's think about a couple things i i\nwant us to pay attention to okay minnie\none is people are gonna think\nright so so like let's see how much of\nwhat causes you suffering\nis people are gonna think so that's\ngonna be like a key phrase\nthat we're going to look out for okay\nokay\num second thing is you know i think that\nbeing a burden\nis something that we can also kind of\nkeep an eye out for\num and so let's see if we can pay\nattention and even if people are\nwatching\num if they can sort of like pay\nattention like let's see if we can learn\nand maybe\nokay but you can see it too okay\nso you said that um around seventh or\neighth grade you started to\nuse a strong word you said hate yourself\nor you said that you hate yourself\nwhat do you hate about yourself\nwell like i kind of hate\nmyself well i was thinking about this\nthe other day\nand good for you\num like exterior wise\ni just hate how i look but\ninterior wise like on the\ninside i just feel like i'm a shitty\nperson\nit when it's extreme and like i just\nfeel like\ni cause people around me like\nsadness and i don't like that about\nmyself\nyou close people around you sadness\nburden\nyeah burden there it is okay so good so\nwe caught it okay so and you say on the\nexterior\nso that's a strange\nit sounds to me like you're trying to\navoid saying something\nwhen you say on the exterior we i assume\nwe're talking about your physical\nappearance\nyes yes okay sorry my words sometimes\nlike yeah i i like\ntry to think of a word to say but then\nlike i can't really think about it\nyeah um\nso i'm not gonna try to be harsh here\nbut case\ncase in point we just had a i don't know\nif you were watching the stream but we\njust had someone say that they\nyou know they're ugly and me and\nno no no no not you oh they're like they\nwere talking about themselves\nthat's true no don't say that but if\nthey said that about wait hold on so you\nsay don't say that about themselves but\nif they had said that about you\nthen then what would be your reaction i\nmean i'd agree\nlet's say\nright no no so they were talking about\nthemselves\nright so and and so i'm just curious\nwhether that\nword feels loaded to you and you avoid\nusing it for a particular reason\nwhich which word ugly\num yeah it's a\nit's a loaded word yeah definitely\nand what's it loaded with\nit's like a lot of\ni mean when i think of the word ugly it\ncan't ever be like\ngood if that makes sense\nyep so there's that and then\nit can make other people really sad if\nyou say to them\n[Music]\nthen ah yeah\nokay so i'm gonna ask you a couple of\nquestions\nokay okay so number one is ugly is like\ncomes with permanence and hopelessness\nthere's like no chance for change\nyeah wait\nwell to\ni don't know i think\nbut at the same time i think ugly is\nkind of subjective\nlike okay i would agree\nbut okay so see like what just\nhappened there like\nso it's interesting right because we you\nkind of talked just earlier you said\nlike ugly is like\ncan't do anything about that but then\nso i want you to notice as we just start\nto like look at your\nyour feelings and not we don't say\nyou're wrong\nright so i i didn't say minnie don't\nthink that about yourself\nyou know you're beautiful we're all\nbeautiful\nthat's what my friends like to say yeah\nright and\nso let's think about that so so i i\nthink if people\ni mean the impression that i got was\nthat you had a little bit of a light\nbulb go off in your head\nas we started to look at ugliness it\nsounded like you felt pretty hopeless\nabout it but then you were like but\nactually\nit's actually kind of subjective so i\ndon't know if we got to the point of\nmaybe i'm not\nbut i got the sense you were looking at\nit in a way that was a little bit\ncalmer\nand the interesting thing is what\nhappens when when you feel ugly and you\ntell your friends when you burden them\nright and what do you say to them\nabout what i about being feeling ugly or\nfeeling\nlike you don't like your exterior as you\nput i don't know like\ni was just talking about this with my\nother friend yesterday\num i was telling her i felt like not\nconfident about\nhow i look and then she was telling me\nthat like\num that i was kind of like self-sabot\nsabotage\nsabotaging myself then i told earth that\ni'm\nsorry and i i sound really frustrating\nand i felt that too like that's what i\ntold her\nand so let's think about that exchange\nright so\nyou express a vulnerability to her\nshe tries to help you with it\ntries to maybe reassure you maybe tries\nto give you a way forward\nand then how do you respond\ni'm sorry yeah right\nso let's think about that so so um so\nthat's just that's one possibility so\nthat's gonna be the possibility\nof reassurance or problem solving like\nif we were to tell you minnie i think\nthat you are not ugly at all\ni think you're a wonderful person\nactually that's not even about your\nphysical\nappearance i've trained myself so hard\nto not comment on people's physical\nappearance that i find it\nactually hard to comment yeah\nlike so if because i think it just it\njust messes things up but if i were to\ncall you pretty if i said minnie you're\nvery pretty\nright what would you say how how would\nyou react\ni'd probably say thank you like\nyeah but then on the inside i probably\nthink\nno okay so there's an important lesson\nto be learned here right so the first\nthing is that like\nwhen people try to tell you that you're\nwrong you just\ndig your heels in he heals and deeper\nright like you're just like no\nincorrect yeah okay like my immediate\nresponse\nyep and so then then okay so we've got\nburden we've got sort of the the idea of\nlike reassurance\ndoesn't really work um\nso let's try to figure out if there's\nsome way that we can help you with those\nfeelings\nwithout telling you that you're wrong so\nyou said\nkind of switching gears for a second i'm\ngoing to ask you a little bit more about\nyour past is that okay\nokay sure so you said around seventh or\neighth grade is when you started to be\nstarted to feel what exactly\njust like self-hatred but also\na lot of depression like depressive\nphase episodes and like anxiety\nokay did you see and you're allowed to\nnot answer\nany question you don't feel comfortable\nwith right but um\ni think it would just be helpful did you\nsee a mental health provider who\nduring that time okay so it sounds um so\nlike\nnot then but starting high school\nuh and then up until today like i saw\ntherapists and stuff okay and do you\nfind that helpful\nyes and no good answer\nso what's helpful and what isn't\nso i've seen about six therapists\nnow because uh\nhalf of them was because we just didn't\nclick\nand then the other half was because i\nhad to either move or like\njust technical things um\nbut all of them they were really helpful\nin like helping me find resources like\nlike who to call when you're not okay or\nlike\num or just like yeah\nstuff like that but and also they were\nhelpful with\nhelping me like identify a problem\nthat makes sense but then\ni felt like and i've definitely made\nprogress\nin like the sense that i can get up out\nof bed now and do\nwork and that kind of stuff but\num i think everything after\nrealizing a problem and giving it\ntechnical solutions hasn't really\nworked out yet what do you mean by\ntechnical solutions\nlike stuff that\num stuff like\nlike i still feel like [ __ ] but i can at\nleast like\nsorry my brother passed by i still feel\nlike [ __ ] but\num i can at least like go about my day\nnow\nokay so let me see if i\nunderstood you correctly so it sounds\nlike um you know there have been times\nwhere they provided you with resources\nthat have been helpful\num i commend you for you know not\nsticking with people that you didn't\nfeel like were a good fit\ni think that's really important so a lot\nof people think that you know if they\nsee a therapist\nand they don't like it they don't like\ntherapy but you may just\nnot like that therapist right it's kind\nof like going to a restaurant and saying\noh i hate all restaurants and it's like\nyou just\nmay not like that kind of food right\num so that that's really awesome on your\npart i think you\nyou know i i commend you for doing that\nand what i'm also hearing from you is\nhuh yes sorry oh no you could you can\num so then the next thing that i kind of\nheard which is\nyou know tricky but i'm glad you're\nbeing honest about it is that like\nyou're kind of living your life like you\ncan get out of bed and stuff\nbut internally you still feel like [ __ ]\ni think i can live my life to the extent\nwhere\nit doesn't pain other people to see me\nupset like family and friends\nbut um yeah that's why i was\ni wanted to talk about self-esteem\nbecause i just feel like i'm not good\nenough to try like\nnew things and and stuff\nokay so there's that\nlook at you steering the conversation oh\nno not me shocking\nright now how do you feel when i point\nthat out to you\num\ni feel like i've been called down called\nout\nyeah i called you up that's because\nthat's what i did yeah i feel to be\ncalled out\nbit embarrassed what are you embarrassed\nby\num\nuh i'm not i'm not sure\nokay so the first thing is when i called\nyou out is that a good calling out or a\nbad calling out\ni'm not sure okay cool actually yeah\nyeah so who are we here for today minnie\nme yes\nthat is the correct answer how does that\nfeel\n[Music]\nuh\nbit weird yes\nyeah that is the right answer too what\nfeels weird about that\nthat i'm uh\nhaving a therapy session with the dude i\nsaw\non youtube uh for the past month\nin front of thousands of audience\nagain not the answer that i was\nexpecting but a fair one\nwhat i was what i was expecting was\nthat you know like you don't we don't\ni don't imagine that you do many things\nin your life where you come first\nwhere it's about you and it's about what\nyou want\nright i'm not\ni'm not sure if that's true tell me\nabout that i just\ni don't know like um when i was getting\ntherapy\nlike for the first time um\ni felt really selfish because\nmy mom didn't want me to\nuh and my dad either i don't think they\nrealized i was depressed but i was\nthinking\nwhat's going on i guess just like\nteenage angst or something and like i\nwas\nhaving problems with like toxic\nfriends and stuff so i guess they\nthought like we had a fight and i was\nfeeling sad about that\nbut i was kind of realizing that\num something was wrong so\ni wanted to get therapy but\nmy mom was\nwell she didn't really like she\npreferred she told me that she preferred\ni didn't\nget therapy but also i like told her i\nwanted it so\nshe did look for a therapist but it was\ntaking like two months\nand i needed help like then so i went to\nlike\nmy school counselor and then told her\nabout it and then i was kind of like\nyou know uh\ntaken to therapist okay\nand then that didn't really\nmake my mom happy or am i done yeah so\nwhy were they upset\ni guess they just didn't want the school\nto know\nand they didn't want things to escalate\nuh which i understand\nbecause explain it to us\num\nlike i know\ni feel like i should have waited two\nmonths for my\nfirst appointment that my mom\nassigned me up for instead of\ngoing to the therapist i mean going to\nthe school counselor the day after\nand then telling her that i was feeling\nreally upset\nand slightly suicidal\nand stuff oh it's like it's just\nlike wait\nsorry guys i shouldn't talk about\nsuicide so casually but like i mean hey\nyou do you this is your time minnie\nthere you go are you would you be\nburdening people if you talked about\nsuicide what will people think how will\nyou affect others\ni know some people can get very\nuh triggered when suicide is talked\nabout casually\nlike i was kind of like that\nwhen i was feeling suicidal so let's\nunderstand that\num well\nit was more so that when i was feeling\nwhen i was very depressed and suicidal i\ni would joke about it a lot\nbut then what\nbut then when other people did it it\nmade me a bit upset\nso hypocritical of me but like yeah\nso it looks like you just took a quick\nchance to beat yourself up there\ni did yeah did you not\ndoes that what did i do you called\nyourself a hypocrite\noh wait but like that was hypocritical\nkind of\nsure i i don't doubt that you have a\ngood reason for\nfeeling that way or believing that but i\njust still want to point out that you\ndid it\nright because when we beat ourselves up\nlike we don't have bad reasons\nit's like when i look at myself in the\nmirror i'm not like oh my god\nwhy don't you have gills and flippers\nlook at how human like\nwe pick things that make sense all right\nokay yeah yeah sorry it was no sorry\nyeah um\nokay so um can we actually go back to\nseventh and eighth grade for a second\nsure so uh\nwhen did this stuff so you started to\nfeel what\naround that time like end of middle\nschool\nso like uh i was in a lot of\nmiddle school drama\n[Music]\nwith like friends during that time\nso not like theater no no\nno like uh like you know\nfighting with friends and uh getting\nbackstabbed and\nyou know stuff like that\nwhat do you mean getting backstabbed and\nstuff like that\ncan you oh i don't want to get into the\nmiddle school drama\num why not you don't have to but i'm\njust curious why not oh um i just\ni feel like i've i should be over it\nkind of yeah okay should be over it\nokay i just get another set\nyes you can hydrate as often as you want\nto\nhydrate yourself um\nso if someone says i should be over it\nare they over it\nno no right\nand so you got to be careful minnie\nbecause like i hear that also that self\njudgment there that like\nyou're not over it and then we're not\ngoing to talk about it because you\nshould be over it\nyeah right so it's like if i'm bleeding\nand it's like\noh my god i shouldn't be bleeding and\nthen i'm like do you want a bandage and\nyou're like no no no\nno no i shouldn't leave you bleeding\nso i i don't want the basic\nand then like\nhow do you feel about telling us you\ndon't have to\nbut you know i think it's like i think\nit's important\nthat i do though and i i want to\nbut like yeah but what but\nthe but the self-judgment part of me is\nlike\nno okay good so now we're gonna pause\nfor a second before we get into it so\nminnie i want you to pay attention to\nwhat you're about to do because it's\nabout to be awesome\nokay so you are judging yourself\nand that voice inside of you is saying\nyou shouldn't say this\nright it's like how dare you you should\nbe over it it's beating you up\nand then you are about to not listen to\nthat voice\nso remember that there are two ways to\ndeal with self-esteem\nfor lack of a better term or for just\none conception\nright or one kind of structure to think\nabout one is that we make the\nself-esteem the self-hateful thoughts\ndecrease so that we don't have them as\noften\nthe second thing that we can do is not\nlisten to them\ndon't let them dictate our life\nright so there's a difference between\nthat beast existing\nand that beast controlling you\nand so what i think is actually really\ncool is that if you you know do tell us\nthe story now i feel like you can't\nnot tell us because then oh no\nyou really you don't you don't have to\nbut i just want to illustrate a point\nbut like you know because you don't want\nto you're like i shouldn't i should be\nover it like it's dumb but then you say\nlike i want to so like\nthere it's that same part that you talk\ntalk to us about where there's like\nyou know you know the the part of you\nthat says oh thank you very much and\nthen\nbut i'm still a terror you know they're\nlike\nit's that war between the two parts of\nyou so you know if you share that story\nwith us what you're doing is actually\nlike learning how to like\nnot listen to that part it's gonna keep\nspeaking for a while\nand we'll get to that but does that make\nsense\nyeah you are acting in spite of your low\nself-esteem and your self-judgment which\ni think is a really important skill\nto have so what happened in middle\nschool i i could use a dose yes\nyou know decent 12 year old drama yes\nit's friday afternoon you know\num yeah so\n[Music]\nsorry i'm just gonna think for okay\nuh\nokay i'll think i'll talk about the one\nthat affected me the most\num so i had\ni had two friends um\nwe'll call one a and then we'll call one\nb\num so and i\nstarted and i were really good friends\nin middle school\num but\nshe was\num starting like seventh eighth grade\nshe started getting very depressed for\nher own reasons\num and i really\nwanted to like help her not be depressed\nbecause\nyou know it made me sad that she was sad\ni think honestly in retrospect i did it\nmore out of like\nme not wanting to feel sad around her\nrather than me wanting to help her\nbut but so i tried to help her\nyou know be there for her hear her when\nshe\nlike ranted about stuff uh but then like\nyou know i didn't understand that she\nneeded a therapist\nback then so\nso the summer before high school started\num she tried to like attempt suicide\num and it was kind of traumatic for me\nbecause\nfor like three days i couldn't reach her\nlike through phone or anything\nand uh the last thing she said was like\ni love you\nso i was like the [ __ ] going on and\nthen i even went to her house\nand then only after three days\nlike she finally texted me saying that\nshe was at the hospital\nand i couldn't really go see her\nbecause like both our parents were like\nboth her parents and mine were like\nlet's not like you know\nso uh\nso she did that but she was she did not\nyou know she only attempted but she was\nstill alive and stuff\nuh so\nthere was that you know\ndealing with her this doesn't sound like\nmiddle school drama to me\noh um this is the last middle school\ndrama this is like\nactual like scary events\nyeah i was like\ni was like i'm not i'm a little bit\nterrified how this is\ninto like middle school drama because we\nhaven't heard anything about b\nit's like is b gonna start you came for\nthe\nlike you came for the beast but you left\nwith like\nback okay yeah you came for the what\noh no nothing yeah\nso um there's there was that and then\nuh entirety of freshman year was just\nlike\nus being depressed together and then\nuh at the end of freshman year she moved\nschools\nuh without like telling me uh\nand then like i also moved schools\nuh because i didn't really want to be in\nthat school\nuh so that's the first a friend\nthen be friend um\nbe friend i was friends with her in\nmiddle school as well\nand then this was like seventh to eighth\ngrade\nuh she started liking me but then\num so a little background i grew up like\nvery christian um\nall the way up until like eighth grade\num\nand i didn't really learn about like uh\nsexual identity all the way until like\nseventh grade in middle school because\nno one taught me about it\num so she started liking me\nand then and then like\nwe used to exchange letters like\neven though we saw each other every day\nuh\nand i thought it was like a friend thing\nbut like\nclearly it was not um\nand then made it clear that it wasn't\nwell i mean like i don't think\nfriends really exchange like\ntwo to three pages of letter every day\nokay but i guess i thought that true um\nso one day it's like actually a pretty\ncool friendship\nyeah if there was a friendship like that\nbut anyway i don't mean to derail you\nsorry\nyeah i kind of miss her but like\nso there's that and then just a little\nbit\njust um and then she\nshe liked me so one day she gave me like\na love letter and then\ni i checked it when i got home\nand uh i\ni was smiling a lot when i read it for\nsome reason\nbut then like i told my mom about it\nand uh because my mom and i are pretty\nclose\nuh or like back then we were still\ni mean yeah we were close uh\nbut then she was like i don't know she\nshe had this weird reaction\nwhere she was like oh you know like it's\nprobably just as a friend or something\nuh and she told me that like she like\nshe liked girls when she was young too\nbut it was just like\nconfusion and she like she basically\ntold me\nlike you're probably a bit confused and\nso she and i was like\nand then she told me that i shouldn't\nlike stay friends with people like that\nbecause they'll\nconfuse me more so i was like\nreally confused um\nit's a common state for middle schoolers\nyes\nconfused and scared um\nbut and then so i got the letter and\nthen\nuh i had the exchange with my mom and\nthen\ni had this weird\nlike and i started like\nrealizing i'm seeing this girl the same\nway as i see a dude\nuh so then i got really scared for some\nreason\ni still don't know why uh\nso i got really scared and then and i\ndid\nthe worst thing possible and i just\nstarted avoiding her\nuh in true middle school fashion\nso we avoided each i avoided her\nand then she tried to confront me once\nbut then i like ran away like quite\nliterally\nso we stopped being friends but then\nlike\na few other people started thinking i\nwas homophobic\nso i was like oh no and i tried to tell\nthem i wasn't\nbut like you know they\nthey kind of didn't want to hear me so\nso that happened\nand then this was in eighth grade\nand then i got really depressed after\nsunny\nafter i tried to commit like\nsuicide and then\nuh i got really depressed and\ni really missed be like\ni really missed befriend so i wanted to\nlike\ntalk to her again right so i started\nlike\nmessaging her and then talking to her\nagain before high school\nstarted without having\nuh ever apologized to her\nuh and like\nand like that was like my first mistake\nand then and\nthis is where things get like kind of\nshitty\nand like yeah okay\nbut how's your nervousness by the way\nright now like up the roof and gone\nup through like\nthrough the roof and god okay\nkeep going so you said okay and things\nget really bad\nokay so then if i really bad i just mean\nlike\nnow i make a lot of actual shitty\nmistakes\nuh and then i realized in\nmy freshman year of high school that i\nliked her a lot\nuh like in a non-straight way\nso i was really confused about that uh\nand then she but\nat the time when i realized i liked her\nshe had a girlfriend\nso so i\ni knew about them and i like supported\nthem too\ni like you know\nuh like this one time b told me to like\nhe asked me if like i could get\nchocolates for her girlfriend and then\nshe would pay me back\nso i agreed to that um\nlike stuff like that uh\nso then i started liking her and then\nuh i really wanted to tell\nher because like things were\ngetting a bit like too hard for me to\nhandle\nwhat was getting hard for you to handle\nlike i felt like\ni had to tell her because\num it was\ngetting in the way of like me\nfunctioning normally around her\nso\nmaybe i was\num yeah but then like she had a\ngirlfriend so\nyou're not really supposed to do that\nbut like\ni did uh you're not supposed to do what\nlike fall in love with people who are in\nrelationships\nyeah okay\nokay so then i told her about it\nbut i told her that i i wasn't trying to\ndo anything i just wanted to like\nher to acknowledge it and then tell me\nlike it can't happen\nand tell me to move on which is which is\nwhat she told me so like\nso then i was like okay um oh sorry guys\nso you did share with her and she said\ni'm sorry i'm with someone i want you to\nmove on\nyeah okay and then i was like okay now\nwe can be\nfriends again um but like\nuh i found this out way later but\nshe told me i mean no she\nuh when i told her about it she told her\ngirlfriend\nand then they had a fight and broke up\nuh so\nso then b started ignoring me\nuh and then that got me really anxious\nuh because like yeah and then\nso after her ignoring me for two weeks\nlike\ni confronted her about it i was like hey\nlike could you just like please talk to\nme\ni'm sorry if i did something wrong\nbecause i didn't know she told her\ngirlfriend that they\nyeah so\nuh so i confronted her and this was in\nthe middle school lunch cafeteria we\nwere\nin the middle school yeah uh\nwell we were there for a class um\nbut like we were there right and people\nare relatively\nquiet so it's just me and her talking\nuh because we had a sub\nthat day and like i remember i was\nasking her hey what did i do wrong like\ncould you please tell me\nand stuff like that and then she told me\nthat\nuh she told me that\nshe never really like liked me from the\nbeginning and that uh\nand that uh she was tired of hearing me\nlike talk about being depressed all the\ntime\nand that i was making people around me\nlike\ntired and stuff so\nthat was like our last conversation\nbefore freshman year ended and then and\nthen i moved\nuh\nyeah and then okay\nwe actually did talk though on like\nthe phone and stuff\nafter after that like two years later\nbut it was just like\ni don't really remember how it went but\nwe did talk but\nwe don't really talk we haven't talked\nat all\nfor three years four years\nfive years yeah okay so\nif i'm doing mental math then you're in\nyour early twenties\nballpark\nmom i'm in a class\nclass\ni'm 18.\nyeah i'm in college i might i'm in my\nfreshman year of college\nokay hence why i'm talking about middle\nschool drop\nbut uh yeah so\nokay yeah that's it what are you\nstudying\nuh i'm in this program where i choose my\nmajor\ntwo years later so i'm just studying\nlike\nphilosophy and stuff right now in the\nmeantime\nyour basics yeah basic stuff yeah okay\ni'm thinking is that cool yeah no go\nyeah can we just check in like how\nyou seem even though you say your\nanxieties through the roof i get the\nsense that you're actually like\nmore relaxed i am\nyeah my heart is like not beating a lot\nanymore so that's really good\nokay um\nhow does it feel so you remember there\nwas that part of you that didn't want\nyou to speak\nand how does that part feel right now\nit's not saying anything right now but i\nfeel like\nyeah but i feel like later on i'll\nprobably think why'd i do that\nor something yep yeah so so i i think\nthat's also an important point that i\nwant to make is that\nthe parts of us so if we think about\nanxiety\nright anxiety like is a fear of the\nfuture\nit's afraid of what's going to happen\nand then often times if we can actually\nlike overcome that hump\nthe actual reality is not what we\npictured\nand our our brain is designed to imagine\nbad things to keep us from doing\ncatastrophic make catastrophic mistakes\nso it makes the things that we imagine\nin the future actually be amplified\nwhich is like evolutionary it's not\nyou know if i run across a snake in the\nwilderness\nand my brain is like well chances are if\ni get bit it'll hurt a lot\nand i'll be like out like we think about\ndeath like our brain teaches us to fear\ndeath and we take\ndangers and then we actually amplify\nthem which is what it's supposed to do\nbut i want you to just notice that\nbecause many i think a lot of times\ngoing forward if you want to move\npast your that voice in your head\nall you've got to do is like get over\nthe hump but i know it's going to come\nback it's definitely going to come back\nbut i just kind of wanted to point that\nout so\nyeah so i mean did other stuff continue\nto happen in high school are there other\nthings that sort of\naffected your self-esteem um\nhigh school was like mentally i was\nworse than i was in middle school but\nlike\nnothing was actually like going on if\nthat makes sense\nyeah what do you mean by mentally you\nwere worse like i wasn't\nlike sometimes i just couldn't go to\nschool even after i moved\nout of the old one uh\nuh like i was crying a lot\nthen i wanted to isolate myself a lot\nand like you know uh\nmy grades went down a lot in freshman\nyear so\nsophomore junior and senior was just me\ntrying to get them up\nbecause my parents wanted them up so\noh yeah but like besides that like it\nwas just\nme in my head rethinking uh\nthat things from middle school and\nfreshman year of high school over and\nover again\nso so you were you were replaying that\nstuff\nyeah okay a lot\nokay can i share some thoughts with you\nsure\nso first of all good job today\num just a reminder that this is not\ntherapy right we're just talking about\nyour past\nyeah um i'm glad you you do have\nuh treat like a treatment team right um\nso let so a lot of times\nwhat we explore with people is where the\norigins\nof their beliefs about themselves come\nfrom so the first thing\nto understand this sounds kind of weird\nbut like you know when we were talking\nearlier about reassurance and like you\nfeel basically like you're not a good\nperson\nand that you burden people and that like\nyour hurt like\ntrickles out like almost like secondhand\nsmoke and then like\npollutes like yeah people's lives around\nyou right like your presence is like\nyou know it's like you're peeing in the\nswimming pool and everyone else is in\nthe swimming pool and then like\noh no oh no\nyeah um\nso so that that's what i'm getting from\nyou is that you really feel like a\nburden you feel like\nyou're not a good person you feel like\nyou mess up other people's lives by your\npresence\nand so what most people do is they would\nreassure you right and they'd say like\nno minnie like you're an amazing person\nlike you're beautiful\nyou're a force for positivity why'd you\nsay that in the british accent\nlike the british\nbecause i'm i'm trying to poke fun at it\nbut but you know people will say oh\nyou know you're an amazing person i i do\nthink you are an amazing person\num i i actually i'm really optimistic\nfor you\num yeah and and i'll get to why but\ni think the first thing that we've got\nto do is that you're not dumb\nunfortunately you are quite smart and so\nthe smarter you are if you have a belief\nlike this is the problem is that when we\ntry to when we see someone who's\nstruggling with a belief\nwe tell them they're wrong because\nthat's not what we see\nright and so like but that's it's kind\nof silly because you're not dumb like\nthat belief comes from somewhere\ni think actually you're justified in\nbelieving that you are a burden to other\npeople\ni don't have i just don't think that\nthat's the whole story so let's just\ntake a step back and think about being a\nburden\nso the first thing is that we do burden\non other people\nlike that's true right so like if i'm\nhaving a bad day and like i'm moody\nlike that's gonna affect my kids\nright it's gonna affect my wife if my\nwife is having a bad day my kids are\nlike you do affect the people around you\nand sometimes you can affect the people\naround you in a negative way like that's\nnot\nfalse um i also think that i know this\nis gonna sound crazy\nbut i i do think that you know if you\nare sad and depressed\nthat it negatively affects the people\naround you\ni don't i i know it's weird so be\ncareful here because\ni mean i i don't know how else to say it\nbut like when one person is depressed\nlike as a psychiatrist i work with\npeople who are depressed it's really\nhard on their families\nthat's a fact now\neven though that's true we have to ask\nanother question which is equally\nimportant i think this is the question\nyou need to ask yourself\nis it okay to do that\ni don't i don't feel like\nno okay like i i feel like\neven though i know objectively that\nthey're my family because they are there\nto support me\nthrough hard times like like\non the inside like i really feel like\ni shouldn't yep\nso i get that right and\nand see we said you're smart because you\nknow what the right answer is\nand you're like i disagree with the\nright answer which is entirely\nacceptable\nthat is where i think you frankly we\nyou know we need to work on your beliefs\nabout what the world is and what human\nbeings deserve from one another\nbecause i do think that's okay because i\nthink that's how life\nworks like i think it's i just don't see\nhow else\nyou know when i'm having a bad day i'm\ngonna burden the people around me\nand when other people are having a bad\nday they're gonna burden me that\nyou know life is a multiplayer game it's\nnot a single player game and that\non any given day one of us is screwing\nup\nright now this is where you say like\nokay fine even that's true the problem\nis that i screw up more than everyone\nelse\nright wait i'm like scared because you\njust thought of what i was thinking\nyeah yeah yeah yeah yeah\nthat's what we do here right\nso like you say like in theory\nfine you know i get to burden my parents\nsometimes my parents get to burden me\nbut it's me burdening them all the\n[ __ ] time\nso it's not fair and that makes it not\nokay because if it was even\nfine okay\nso this is why i think it's great that\nyou're 18. because you're just getting\nstarted\nthere are gonna be a lot of people that\nget to burden you down the road and my\nhope is that actually as you\nas you continue to grow like and is\njust put more years under your belt\nyou'll begin to see and i hope that\nyou're able to see now we have to be\ntricky because this is where cognitive\nbias comes in\nbecause you may not be able to\nappreciate because you're so stuck in\nyour own head\nthat other people lean on you too\nso i'd give it a couple of years but\nwe'll we'll get to that\neventually yep yeah\nso i i think that you're gonna be\ni honestly many and this may hurt you\nhere and hopefully i can repair this\ndamage a little bit\ni think you're going to be a burden on\npeople for a couple more years because i\nthink that's what children\nare like i don't know how to say this\nhuh but i'm 18. yeah i still think of\ny'all as kids\nand that's not it's it i don't try to be\ncondescending\nyeah but like i know i mean i [ __ ]\nwasn't anywhere near an adult when i was\n18.\ni i earned my first real paycheck at the\nage of 32.\nlike i you know i i just i was a late\nbloomer like literally 14 years is like\n14 years later is when i started\nbecoming a self\nlike sufficient adult where i could pay\nmy own bills and stuff like that\nand it's just it just takes time\nright so like we don't we don't actually\nconsider 18 i mean we consider 18 year\nolds adults but if you're in near us\nyou're not allowed to drink\nright you're still actually in education\nyou're just starting your\nfinal base of education potentially\nand so so i think it's just you know\nyou're not going to be like\nas productive like you'll be a far more\nproductive member of society at 30 than\nyou are at 18.\nthat's just a fact it doesn't mean that\n18 year olds can't be productive adults\ni'm not saying that but i'm just like\ngive yourself a little bit of time\num the next thing is that we've got to\nthink a little bit about like\nwhere your belief that you're a burden\ncomes from and this is what i love about\nyour story is because we actually\nalready have the answer you usually have\nto dig around for with people but\nwhere when did you start believing that\nyou were a burden to the people around\nyou\nlike when i started getting depressed\nwhich was eighth grade yeah i i don't\neven think that's it\nso i think it really comes from when the\nwoman that you were in love with told\nyou that you're a burden to other people\nand that you ruined their lives\ni don't know if it was love okay sure\nsure as hell sounds like it from my\nperspective\nand maybe it wasn't i mean i'm in a\nrelationship right now\nokay okay sorry\ni mean no it's okay i i mean it sounds\nlike a [ __ ] rom-com\nmini it's a story out of a rom-com\ni don't i'm not trying to you know mess\nup your life but\nyeah yeah you know i mean like it sounds\nlike you guys had a real connection\nwhether it's like\nyou know whether it's like friendship\nlove or romantic love or something in\nbetween\nit sounds like you guys genuinely cared\nfor each other in a very deep way\nyeah you know i mean even if if there\nwasn't romantic love or it really wasn't\nromantic love like whatever there's\nthere's clearly like some i mean you\nlike you said\nit's not common for seventh or eighth\ngraders to write each other two to three\npage letters on a daily basis\nyeah i don't know what you call that\ni would just call it a deep connection\nof which i think the word\nlove approximates the best\nand and if we think about it like you\nknow what does it do to someone when\nthey care about someone so much when\nsomeone is so important to them\nand to hear those kinds of words from\nher\nlike what did it feel like when she said\nthat\nlike the exaggeration but also not\nreally\nbut my like my physical\nchest area hurt when i heard that\nlike i started crying and then like\nfelt like my\nheart was like breaking and stuff\nliterally yeah yeah\nright so and i hate to say this many\nyou've been a little bit broken ever\nsince\nand and because that's the thing is like\nlike when you say you should have gotten\nover it like you haven't gotten over it\nand like no wonder you feel like a\nburden because\nyou know it sounds like in some ways and\nso you're\nyou're down playing things so i'm gonna\namplify things and the truth is probably\nsomewhere in the middle\nso like probably one of the most\nimportant people in the world to you\nor maybe the most important person in\nthe world to you tells you that you're a\nburden\nand you ruin the lives of people around\nyou\nand then you said that your heart was\nbreaking literally okay\nso like like if we think about it you\nknow where a lot of these thoughts\ncoming from\nit's like because she told you that\nright like you learned that lesson about\nyourself\nand it dug it like sunk in really deep\nand then you sort of had this belief and\nit sounds like it may have started\nbefore that even like when you started\nto get depressed\nand stuff but if i were to say you know\nit's kind of like\nmaybe there were some cracks but like\nthat was the shattering\nyeah yeah right so\nand so and so if we think about it you\nknow if you really want to heal\nlike it has to be through that\nexperience\nand there are even signs like more from\nlike a psychological or even\nneuroscientific perspective\nthat that was this the seminal event and\nthe reason that i say that is because\nyou remember that there was a substitute\nteacher that day\nso if we look at memory\nmemory is tied to importance\nright people like what do you remember\nlike do you remember what you had for\nlunch\non october 28 2014\nno of course not right it's completely\nunimportant\nbut people remember where they were\nduring 9 11.\nyou remember you were in the cafeteria\nfor a class\nwith a substitute teacher and so like\nwhat that tells me is that\nmoment in time sunk\ndeep into your mind like it's frozen\nit's like a perfect picture\nand even like when you think about it\nlike the picture in your mind is so\nvivid that even\nthinking about it brings up emotions\nbrings up thoughts it's like this whole\nwhirlwind of stuff\nand so now what that is is like it's\nsitting in your unconscious or\nsubconscious mind\nand it's generating the energy of that\nmoment is generating these thoughts\nit's like a projector that's like\nputting stuff up into your mind and like\nthe projector is over here\nbut what you see is over here and this\nis what where you are right now but you\ndon't realize\nthat it's all coming from like this\nexperience\nright because that's like like it's\ninteresting because even the language\nthat we\ntalked about before hearing her words\nare like almost identical to her words\nright the way that you think about\nyourself is a burden is polluting the\npeople around you\neverything you touch turns to ash\nyou're like a plague right\nyeah and so\nnow the question with me questions\nthoughts yeah\ncomments uh\nhow dare you oh my god how dare i go to\nthe bathroom i know\ni'll be back she's learning chat\nshe's learning how to troll us back\nwelcome back minnie\nhi how you feeling\nyou know like less nervous\ndefinitely okay\nyeah so um\nlet me just offer you a couple of\ndirections okay\nso one is uh you know we can talk a\nlittle bit more about\nthe some scar or like this ball of\nundigested emotion\nthat i think generates these negative\nthoughts\nwe can also just talk a little bit about\nuh you know some of the other thoughts\nthat you have\nwe can talk some about your parents or\nkind of how you feel day to day what\nwhat would you like to do\num i guess i could\ntalk about my day-to-day\nyeah can you tell us about that um\nso when i\nwhen i started therapy in like ninth\ngrade\ni was a mess like grades were down\nuh couldn't get out of bed not going to\nschool isolating all that stuff uh\nand\num so like day to day back then was like\nterrible right but then\ni did therapy and i moved schools and\neverything and then\ni realized i was definitely getting\nbetter like going to school again um\ngrades are better or like\nyou know but then\nbut then like oh and then the panic\nattacks got\nless now i only have it like maybe once\nevery two months but\nuh i realized recently that\nwhen something bad happens\ni like go straight back to when i was in\nninth grade and freshman year\nlike i'm back to not getting out of bed\nand like\nfeeling like i'll never get better and\nstuff like that\nyeah what thoughts\noh yeah oh god god\nso it's just like a constant cycle of\nlike\nbetter and then not then better or not\nyeah how does it how does it feel to be\ngetting better and worse all the time\nyo-yoing exhausting\ni can imagine exhausting and\nuh kind of\nof like the burden thing again\nwhere i feel like i wish i could be this\nperfect friend or\ndaughter to like and be stable\nbut i'm not so yeah\ni can imagine that you're okay accepting\nother people's help\nif you actually got better yeah\nbut it feels like a waste to you because\nyou lose all that ground\nare you a good daughter\nno no i don't think so okay\nhelp us understand that\nuh so when i was little\nlike like\nall the way until before middle school\ni was really\ni was really happy all the time like\nmost of the time\nuh like i really enjoyed doing things\nlike\nreading books or whatever uh\nand stuff like that\nand i was really happy most of the time\nand i think my parents were glad that\ni was like that because i have a brother\nand he was really hard to deal with\nfor a while all the way until he got\ninto college um\nlike me and my brother are kind of\nopposites\nso he's like i\ni perceive myself as pretty social\nand i like feed off of um socializing\nwith people\nbecause it makes me happy um\nbut like for my brother\nuh he has a hard time socializing with\npeople\nhe's a bit like he's more the odd one\nout of the\nour family so my\nparents kind of my parents kind of hate\nhim\nand like i\ni learned that like if i don't want to\nbe hated by my parents i kind of have to\nbe the opposite of him\neven though i already was\nuh so\nsorry i lost my train of thought\nthat's great pick it up go ahead\nwhy do your parents hate your brother\nit's really like when we were\nlittle like we're four years apart so\nlike when i was in\nwhen i was six and he was like 10\nuh they would fight a lot they fought\nall the way until he was at the end of\nhis high school\nyears they always fought about like\ngrades or like they even thought about\nhim being bullied\nuh being i don't know why yeah when he\nwas in\nlike when he was in\nelementary school like he used to get\nbullied\nby his classmates it's a part of why we\nmoved from korea to here\nbut so yeah\nthey used to fight a lot and then\nwhenever they fought i would like\ni like hide under the dining room table\nand i just like\nclose my ears uh\nand then and then i learned to hate him\nmy brother for a long time\nbecause sometimes\nlike fights would get violent and then\nsometimes\ni would try to stop them but i was like\nsix you know so\nuh yeah\nuh or like 12 or i don't know\nall the ages um\nso like i learned to hate him because i\nsaw that my parents\nwere hating him and i kind of just hated\nhim because he was\nreally we didn't talk a lot\neither but whenever we did i always felt\nlike i always felt like he was the one\ncausing troubles for\nfamily uh but then like\nbut then i became depressed in eighth\ngrade\nand then i started becoming the\ntroublemaker of the family\nuh so then my parents were like\nwhat the [ __ ] you're supposed to be the\ngood one\num what did they say to you\nlike my parents mhm\ni mean they said a lot of things but\nsometimes they're like really\nsupportive and stuff but\nsometimes when we would fight when i was\ndepressed like they would say stuff like\nlike why are you getting any better or\nlike\nor like i don't know\nuh like you're\nweighing our family business down\nbecause my parents do business\nand they were telling me that because i\nwas depressed like they were depressed\nso they couldn't do\nwork or something uh\noh yeah yeah yeah they did oh\noh how wonderful um\noh that's all\nclass um\nyeah but\nat the same time like\nlike they did say some really mean\nthings\nbut i feel like it was out of like\nlike they had reasons for it yep yeah\nthey are bad people i really love them\ni don't think they're bad people\nthey were just tired too and they didn't\nunderstand why i wasn't getting along\nwith\nmy brother either uh\nbecause whenever we talked we would\nfight so\nand what's your understanding what's\nyour understanding of why y'all would\nfight so much\num he's done a lot of\nmean things to me also\nbut like to my parents\nas well and then whenever we would\ngo like whenever we would go somewhere\nas a family\nhe would be troublesome socially so i\nkind of had to cover for him what does\nthat mean troublesome socially\nlike so let's say my family was having a\ndinner with like\na family friend right\nso we'd be eating and talking\nthen my brother would like not really\nget the social cues and talk about\nwhatever\nhe wanted to do or like or just do\njust little things that would be like ha\nto the guest but for\nus we were like stop that um\nso i would try to like sound cover\nafraid of him embarrassing you yeah\nwe were we were and i was making the\nfamily look bad\nyeah we were and then i was also\nscared that\ni don't know yeah i was also scared that\nlike\nthey would look down on my brother\nbecause like there were incidents where\nhe actually escalated into a fight with\nlike other people\noutside of her family and that's when i\nwas like\nno he can't do that uh\nso it's just like you know\nbut he like mellowed down in high school\nhe's still a prick but like uh\nwe don't fight a lot anymore\ni actually had like a semi heart\nto heart with him in like like\na few months ago and i was just trying\nto understand that like\nhe was really like he told me he was\nreally\ndepressed in middle school and like when\nhe was younger\nand he was dealing with a lot too uh\nso i like i remember asking\nmy parents to get hymn therapy\nwhen we were in high school\nyeah uh sorry that was tangent\nit's a beautiful one\ni'm gonna just try to take this in yes\ngo ahead\nwhat do you talk about in therapy\nthe same thing i talked about here\nokay and then a little bit more about\nlike\nother stuff but you know yeah basically\nbut you your therapists know that for\nexample like you had this\nwhen you grew up like you would hide\nunder a table and cover your ears when\nyour parents were\nin a fight with your brother yeah\nand what are your their how does that\nconversation go in therapy\nit depended on who it was but like\nall six therapists like let's say\nthere's an hour in a session right\nit's usually like 40 minutes of me\ntalking and then\n20 minutes sometime talking or less\nso it was just me talking a lot\nand then giving advice like breathe or\nsomething\nwhich is good but\nwhat do you want to hear\nwhat's wrong with me because i always\nhear\npeople reassure me that there's nothing\nwrong with me but like\nclearly\nwhat makes it clear that something's\nwrong with you can you hear me\num hi so you want to hear what's wrong\nwith you\nand they won't tell you\nwhy sorry and they won't tell you what's\nwrong with you\nyeah okay well except for my friend\nand what did she say he tells me that\ni'm self-sabotaging a lot what does that\nmean which\nlike telling myself that i'm not good\nenough for\nlike i'm burning people and stuff like\nthat\nand i hear her but i don't know what to\ndo with it\nokay sorry i had a message from\nsomeone okay and then\ndo you if you could change something\nif i could wave a magic wand and change\nsomething about your life what would you\nchange\num\ni want my\nthis is going to sound real bad but i\nwould\nwant my brother\nokay how does it feel to say that\ni feel really\nand why do you want him gone\nflake\ni don't know i often think about what it\nwould have been like if\ni was like\nholy child and what do you envision if\nyou were an only child\nlike less pain from what he does\ndo you sometimes wonder if you would be\nnormal if he wasn't around\nyeah and i know\ni know that's not true because how do\nyou know that's not true\nbecause like he's not like that anymore\nor a lot less like that and my life's\nstill\nkind of you know so\nhmm\nminnie this is going to be tricky they\ndo something wrong\nnope not at all\nall right it's just\ntesting\nyou're the raid boss\npeople joke about you know you've heard\nthis meme before in our channel\npeople like oh my god this person's\ngoing to be the right boss\nand no no one expected it to be you\nbut let's see i know how does it feel to\nbe the raid boss\ni'm sorry guys what are you sorry for\nfor being a raid whose fault is that\ni'm not sure sure you are\nmy\ndo you see the cycle it keeps going\nwhat's the cycle pointed out to me\nuh so like it's like\noh there's a problem i blame myself\nuh but then like someone tells me i'm\nnot\nand i kind of believe it but then\nthere's a problem again\ni play myself yeah very good\nright and so i know this is going to\nsound weird\nbut where can we break that cycle\nthere's a problem i blame myself\npeople tell me it's not my fault i sort\nof believe it there's a problem where do\nwe break that cycle\nthe blaming part nope that's what you\nwould think\nthat's what you would think what do you\nwant\nwhen i asked you what you wanted what's\nyour answer minnie\num do you remember what you said\nwhat do you want from therapy\nto to be more\nless self-doubting no no no no see these\nare all the [ __ ] answers\nthe real answer was you wanted you want\nyour therapist to tell you what's wrong\nwith you\noh yeah yeah yeah sorry i forgot so the\nreal problem with the cycle\nis not there's a problem and i blame\nmyself because that shit's gonna happen\nyou're gonna blame yourself\nright you can't stop that what we need\nto change is the reassurance\nwhat we need to do is tell you what's\nwrong with you that's what you want\nand that's what we need to do\nbecause that's what they don't do right\nand then the problem is that like when\nthey reassure you\nit covers up the problem\nbut it doesn't actually solve anything\nand so the cycle continues\nright and so actually what we needed and\nthe reason you're the raid boss is\nbecause\ni'm gonna have to tell you why you're\nthe problem okay\nbecause that's what you want so it's\nwhat you gotta hear but before we do\nthat\nbefore we do that how do you feel do you\nfeel anxious when i say things like that\nyeah yeah oh my god and what are you\nafraid i'm gonna say\nah you suck or something yeah i don't\nthink you suck i think you're awesome\nokay um but i i do think it's\nit's really challenging right because if\nwe don't\nif we don't accept responsibility for\nour situation we also have no power to\nchange it\nit's like a really tricky double-edged\nsword and i think in a bizarre way the\nreason that you aren't changing is\nbecause\npeople sort of take that away from you\nand it's actually what you want you want\nyou want to hear like why\nyou're the problem and i think you're\nwe'll get there in a second\nbut i don't think it's going to be what\nyou think it is but it is actually going\nto be a problem\nso it's just gonna be hard that's what's\ntricky so let me start with this\nwhen your friend told you what she said\nthat day in the cafeteria\nwhere were those words coming from\nlike when she says you're a burden and\nyou make everyone else's life around you\nworse where are those words coming from\nwithin her\nfrom the things i did\nnot really sort of right so like if we\nthink about like\nlet me ask you this was she like of calm\nand tranquil mind when she was\nexplaining this to you\nno where what was she feeling in that\nmoment\nanger yep and so like\nthe words were coming from a place of\nhurt\ndoes that make sense yeah\nand so this is important to understand\nbecause like even though\nhurtful words can be true they're\nincomplete\nright and this is the problem with like\nhearing what's wrong with you\na mini is that i'll tell you what's\nwrong with you but what i need you to\nunderstand\nis that it's incomplete because that's\ntrue right like i mean i mean come on\nlike\nlet's just think about what you've said\nokay and then let's think about how\nreasonable some of your conclusions are\nif you find yourself thinking i wish my\nbrother had never existed\nand then you're like i'm kind of an evil\nperson\nand then what are we supposed to say no\nyou're not\nright so the problem here minnie is is\nnot that you're\nwrong the problem is that you're right\nthe bigger problem is that it's\nincomplete\nbecause what i want you to understand is\nthat in the same way\nlike do you believe like what do you\nthink that friend what do you think b\nthinks about you as a complete person\nshe used to tell me that i was really\nlike\ni made her happy yep yeah and that i was\nreally\nfun to be around yeah yeah\nright so that makes sense to me it makes\nsense to me that you caused her a lot of\npain\nand you brought her a lot of happiness\nthe problem is that in the in the\nmoments in the screenshots that your\nmind\ntook it like\nyou know took way more or way bigger\nscreenshots of the negative moments in\nyour life as opposed to the positive\nmoments\nand that's not your fault that's\nliterally the way that our brain is\nwired\nso our brain if you go to a restaurant\nand you eat there 10 times and it's\nreally really yummy\nyou remember those 10 times pretty well\nif you go there the 11th time and you\nget food poisoning\nwhat does your brain remember about the\nrestaurant\ni had food poisoning okay at that\nrestaurant\nyeah exactly right so that's what's\nhappened in your life and if we really\nlook at it\nit's not that it's false that you had a\nbad experience at the restaurant it's\nnot\nwrong to believe that it's just\nincomplete\nand so in the same way that your friends\ncan you sort of\nunderstand and let me know like if you\nrebel against this internally because i\ncan kind of read your mind but i can't\nread this next part\nokay so i need so if i were to tell you\nthat your friend\nwhat she said about you wasn't untrue\nbut at that that it came from a place of\nlike hurt\nand was incomplete\nwhat do you think about that\ni i agree okay\nso then what you have to do this is the\nhard part\nis that like i can imagine if you're a\nsix-year-old\nand it sounds like there's an argument\nand maybe even like a physical\naltercation between your parents and\nyour brother\nand you're six years old and you just\nwant to play with what did you play with\nwhen you were six years old um\nlike a nintendo 3. okay so you're just\nplaying nintendo\nand then that's what i played when i was\n62.\num and uh you know you're just sitting\nthere playing your nintendo and this\nlike altercation breaks out\nand then like they're yelling and then\nyou have to like like that child is like\nafraid\nand then the child runs under a table\nand covers their ears and what do they\nwhen a child covers their ears what do\nthey want\nwhat are they thinking in their head\nthey wanted to stop absolutely\ni just want to stop and if you're a\nsix-year-old\nand you want to stop what do you see is\nthe problem\nwell in my case like my brother\nabsolutely right it's a six-year-old's\nthought\nlike the six-year-old does it just like\ni just wanted to stop i want him to go\naway\nbecause you're not dumb and when he\ncomes like when you're\nif you stay at home from school and he's\nnot around you get to play on your\nnintendo\nand when he shows up\nyour parents and him get into it and\nthen your parents\ntheir parents and you sort of get that\nlike even as a six-year-old you're like\nmy parents know what's up\nright like that's how we think like we\nthink that our parents like know what's\ngoing on\nand so then your parents hate him\nand they say certain things to him and\nthen you just know that when he's around\nlike\nit's a mess and so you just want him to\ngo away you want him to never exist\nit's the thought of a six-year-old\ncompletely appropriate does it make you\nan evil person\ni don't think so is it an evil thought\nabsolutely\nand this is where i i think the the real\nproblem many that you run into is that i\nthink that the\nthe bad thoughts that you have about\nyourself are actually true\nit's just just because you have an evil\nthought\neven if you really want it and evil even\nif you really believe it on some level\ndoesn't make you an evil person that's\nthe jump that you need to stop making\nbecause i have an evil thought i am an\nevil person\nbecause i burden people around me i am a\nburden\ndo you see the difference in those two\nstatements\none is like an identity and then the\nproblem is once you\nmake that identity you carry it with you\nwherever you go\nand then you get into cognitive bias but\nif you have like bad thoughts is it an\n[ __ ] thought to like wish that your\nbrother didn't exist\nsure and here's the crazy thing\ni think it's okay for you to have that\nthought\nbecause i think that that thought comes\nfrom a place of just wanting it to end\nand when you're six years old the world\nis not a complicated place\nit's just like uh because six-year-olds\nhave like magical thinking and they're\nlike\nif i waved a magic wand and made my\nbrother go away imagine how\nsimpler my life would be and then each\ntime you have that thought each time you\nguys go to some\nfriend's house and i'm assuming they're\nkorean\nand you guys go to some like you know\nbecause it's like social [ __ ]\nright yeah and then like in the korean\ncommunity you guys are viewed as like\nrejects because you've got this brother\nwho gets into fights with people when\nyou guys go to dinner\nand there's a lot of family shame\nbecause that's what we do in east asia\nand south asia\nand all over the rest of the world too\nbut i think it seems to be more powerful\nnowadays it lingers better in these\ncultures\nwhere it's about community and family\nover individuality there's a whole\ndifferent system\nof worth your worth as a human being is\nnot based on who you are\nit's based on your family\nthoughts responses questions\nokay so what's wrong with you i think\nthat\nuh a lot of the things that you think\nabout yourself happen to be true\nso i some of them i don't think are true\nbut i think that you do burden people\naround you\ni do think that it's an evil thought to\nwish that your brother never existed\ni think actually what's wrong with you\nis that you define\nyour identity based on those thoughts\nbut they're just thoughts like i had a\nthought about a unicorn\ndoesn't make the unicorn real\nright it's just a thought our mind just\nthinks all kinds of weird stuff\nand i think it's okay for you to like\nacknowledge that you're a burden but i\nalso think you need to like really think\nabout\nyou know when people say that you're a\nburden\nto understand that like that's coming\nfrom like a dark place inside them and\nlike we can't\nlet the dark places and each of us\ndefine what the world is\nbecause if your friend thinks you're a\nburden and you think you're a burden\nthen like that's a bleak pace but you're\nmore than a burden right\nyou're someone who brought her happiness\nand you're someone who brought her joy\nand you're someone who like\nyou know taught her what love is if we\nwant to get corny\nand and you know i know you're in a\nrelationship now so sorry about that\nyou know i can't help myself for the\nmemes\ni do it for the music\nbut but i mean seriously like i i think\nthat the problem in here is that\nwhat's wrong with you is that you don't\nsee that you're more than your\nworst parts that's the real problem i\ndon't dispute that you have\nbad parts i just don't think that that's\nall of you right and and the other thing\nis that i\nforgive you for having\nthe bad parts of you that you do because\ni think it's understandable like what do\nyou expect\nwhat do you expect a six-year-old to\nwant to do when they have a brother who\ncomes home and fights with their parents\nall the time\nright and if your parents start hating\nhim you're just gonna learn so it's like\nis it wrong to hate him yes do you hate\nhim\nyes is that bad yes\ndoes it make you a bad person no\nright like in fact many what i think is\nactually really amazing is that\nyou recognize like there's a part of you\nthat fights against all these thoughts\nand feelings\nright there's a part of you that makes\nyou the reason that having the thought\nis fine what would really make you evil\nis if you didn't think you were evil for\nhaving the thought\nright that's what makes you good is like\nthe fact that you feel guilty\nis like what makes you a good person\nyeah and then in terms of you know being\na burden like i think that's gonna get\nbetter and i think that\nfrankly your parents sort of made some\npotential mistakes here now i'm not\ntrying to bash your parents i know that\nyou haven't painted a\nreally you know rosy picture of them but\ni think let's all be\nclear and fair that i think your parents\nare seem like actually really good\npeople\nit seems like they did the best that\nthey could you know they grew up in a\nparticular culture where like\nthere's a lot of shame around mental\nhealth and like that's just what they\ngrew up with so like let's not blame\nthem for it that's the whole thing\nit's like are we going to blame people\nfor like what they grew up with\nand if you're going to forgive your\nparents for what they grew up with and\nyou're going to be understanding for\nthem you should be understanding for\nyourself\nnow be careful because i'm not saying\nyou're wrong i'm just saying you need to\nbe more understanding to yourself\nright you get a pass is what i'm saying\nyou have an excuse i don't it doesn't\ncount\nhow do you feel about that\ni'm unsure i'll take it\nlike like i hear what you're saying\nand i agree give me the butt like\nbut the little the little\nmini me inside me is like but is that\npass okay\nor something yep so so that's the\nquestion that i think you should answer\nright\nis is d so who determines whether the\npass is okay\nyeah so that's your choice to make\nand i hope that you conclude that it is\nokay\ni hope that you can learn how to forgive\nyourself\nfor the person that you are\nand i hope that you can forgive be for\nhurting you\nand i hope that you can forgive your\nbrother\nfor all the disharmony he has caused\nright because that's his real problem is\nhe's like disharmonious\nyeah and and give yourself time minnie\nand there may be like forgiveness for\nyour parents too somewhere in there but\nlike\nyou have to i if you're unsure like i'll\ntake it i think that's as far as we're\ngonna get today like i don't okay you\nknow\nyou know i i think that i'm i'm actually\nreally happy with that\nbecause i was gonna say sorry but then i\nrealized\nno i'm not sorry\nokay good walk us through that\noh cause like when you said i think\nwe're gonna end\nwith unsure i was like oh but\ni want to give a better definite answer\nso i'm\nsorry but then i realized like\nno that's what i'm here for absolutely\nright that's great\nyou did it you gave the good answer even\nin the end\nso either either you're a really good\nscam artist and you figure that out but\nif that's actually what happened in your\nmind minnie that's\nthat's actually what we want right is we\nwant you to observe like\noh it's your fault no it's like like\nit's actually perfect because what\nyou're saying is that\nyeah i didn't do what i was supposed to\ndo i'm not transformed\nand i don't need to apologize for that\n[ __ ]\nthat's exactly what i'm telling you like\nthat's like living exactly what i'm\ntelling you\nis that own that you didn't get there\nall the way\nown that you are a burden to people\nown that you do have evil thoughts\nand also own that it sounds like you\ncare and love about\nyou care and love your brother\nthat you really do care about him a lot\nthat you guys are rebuilding a\nrelationship\nright and like that's exactly what i'm\ntalking about if you can stop yourself\nfrom saying i'm sorry that's perfect\nbecause it's where you are and like\nthat's totally cool oh no you didn't\ncome all the way oh my god\nhow dare you yeah\nbut that's absolutely right how dare you\ngood keep daring my friend\nyou know keep daring to like not be\nwhat you think you should be and not\nbe what the world wants you to be and\ninstead\nkeep daring to be who you are\ngood and bad [ __ ] up pieces and good\npieces\nbecause i don't think you're perfect\nand that's what makes you perfect so\ncorny\nyeah yeah it's [ __ ] cool yeah\nyeah and you called me out on it's\nbeautiful this is who you are\nwhat you can't just let me inspire the\ninternet you have to call me out on it\ncome on it's great\nright this so many the more\nyou ready for more corny okay the more\nwe see of you right like when you shine\nthrough a little bit and you're like\nthat's so corny like that's actually\nbeautiful\nlike the more you shine through with\nlike you know calling me out on my\n[ __ ] and like\nthe more you put yourself out there the\nmore that you let us see who you are\ni think what we see is really beautiful\nlike really it's amazing\nyou're awesome\nthank you i'm just gonna let you sit\nwith that discomfort\nwe're gonna watch you squirm\nwe're going to bring the anxiety right\nback to where we started the beginning\noh lord\nno not the anxiety how does it\nfeel to be appreciated\nfeels weird yeah\nwhat's weird about it\nthat i can like be imperfect\nand people are still like that's so cool\nor something\ni mean that's weird if you think about\nit yeah\nso that's what i want you to do and i\nthink it's great that you're willing to\ntolerate that discomfort because you've\nbeen\nyou've become comfortable with your low\nself-esteem\nyeah right you've been you've become\ncomfortable with beating yourself\nup and blaming yourself and it can\nactually be\nlike uncomfortable to start to love\nyourself\nand to start to accept other people's\nappreciation for who you are\nbecause it's like\nit's like icky why can't you just treat\nme like a piece of [ __ ] at least i know\nwhat that feels like\noh they'll call me out like that\noh no yeah\nbut no i'm i'm not going to because i\ndon't think you are and if it makes you\nuncomfortable\ntough luck\nthis is about helping you not making you\nfeel comfortable\nit's about helping you grow thoughts\nquestions um\nno wow you're really cool\nsee she's [ __ ] i want it this is the\nrape boss\ni'm telling you guys she's using my own\ntechniques against me\nthis is like in the animation so\ninspiring\noh my god oh yeah see she's doing it she\nknows she's doing it to me\nchat no one's done this before i'm\ntelling you i told you all she was the\nrain boss\nthis is like if you play those video\ngames where there's a dark mirror\nand then you get an evil duplicate of\nyourself that you have to fight\noh no that's you\ni just never thought that my evil\ndoppelganger would be an 18 year old\nkorean girl with bunny ears on\nthat's when i visited when i envisioned\nthe raid boss\nthis is not what i felt\nuh but well played minnie well played\nno but i mean it though like like you\ninspire a lot of people\nand that's how i came here so yeah am i\nmaking you uncomfortable\nwhat's wrong with dr k is this\nuncomfortable for you\nwhat the [ __ ]\nokay yeah i'll concede i'll concede the\nuh you can take this round\nall right but i'll just yeah i'll i'll\nhave to come up with some new tricks\nso you can't use them against me can't\ndo\nuh can i think for a moment anymore\nbecause i didn't\n[Laughter]\nit was like i i thought i thought we\nwere you know i thought this was pve\nbut you're turning into pvp next time\ni'll i'll be good but\nlisten i i do appreciate you know your\ni i was joking a little bit but i\nyou know i get what you're saying about\nme being inspiring and all that\nand i appreciate that and i think the\nother thing so now i'm gonna\ni'm gonna swing back so get ready get\nready for it you're inspiring too\nright because like i can't do this on my\nown\nand actually what's really inspiring\nabout this is like the people who come\non\nand that's what makes this what it is\nand it's your\nhonesty and your authenticity and you're\nlike willing to share the darkest parts\nof yourself that actually makes it\ninspiring\nthank you [ __ ] she said thank you she\njust took it\nthank you yeah she's you guys see that\nshe learned\nshe's like adapting and growing and\nmorphing she can just accept it\nnow and she can just maybe accept the\ncompliment\nand maybe feel better about herself\ndespite her discomfort\nshe's learning she's evolving\nshe is but listen minnie this has been\nfantastic do you want to learn about\nmeditation or we\nif we mean ourselves out of that space\nwould i be taking too much time\nor oh there it is you tell me no i won't\ni want to do it okay okay but if you\nwant to\nyou're allowed to say no but you're not\nallowed to say no because it takes too\nmuch time\nno i i do want to learn okay okay\nso now i gotta now i'm okay i gotta\nthink about this\ni have some water what are we gonna\nteach minnie okay\nso i want you to sit up straight\nokay and then i want you to\nput your hands together in front of your\nchest like this\nand i want your uh elbows to be at like\nright angles to the ground so i want\nyour arms to be straight yeah\nso you should feel like tension\num like at the base of your wrists\nright so you just feel that tension for\na second and now what i want you to do\nyou can relax your elbows a little bit\nand then pull your hands apart just a\ntiny amount\nand um i don't know if you're gonna need\nto take off\nuh pull your sleeves down i actually\ndon't know if it'll interfere\nso close your eyes and i want you to\nfeel the space between your hands\nand you may feel like almost like a\ndesire to kind of pull them together a\nlittle bit\nyou may feel like something like you\nknow warmth between them\nand now pull them apart a little bit\nmore\nand feel that warmth expand\nit's almost like a fluffy cushion i\ndon't know if that makes any sense\nif it doesn't make any sense just shake\nyour head no you sort of get whatev\nokay [ __ ] all right so do you feel\nwarmth between your palms\nokay now bring them together a little\nbit\nand just focus on how the warmth changes\nnow pull them apart a little bit\nfocus on that warmth between your hands\nand then a little bit further\nand as you move your hands a little\nfurther apart try to track the warmth\nso do you feel it when they're this far\napart\nyeah pull them a little bit further\nyou feel it now\nbit further\nhow about now no\nokay good so this is the limit so bring\nthem in a little bit\nnow you feel it okay\nso now what i want you to do is open\nyour eyes for a second\ni want you to take your left palm\nand put your right palm inside it like\nthis\nyep very good and then i want you to put\nyour arms in your lap\nso that's kind of him sit up straight\nand close your eyes\nand what i want you to do is feel that\nwarmth coming out of your palm\ni want you to breathe\nand sort of imagine\nalmost like a circuit like there's\nenergy coming into you\neither from the top of your head or your\nbreath\nit travels through your arms\nin a circuit and kind of out of your\npalm\nokay\nand as you sit just focus on\nany of those sensations that grab your\nattention\nso whether it's the feeling of energy\nentering\nor it passing through your body\nor it coming out of your palms\nand as you breathe notice the vitality\nwithin yourself\nit's kind of hard to describe but just\nnotice that you're\nalive and there's like\nlife in there\nthere's a heartbeat there's breath\nthere's energy there's sensation\nthere's heat\nand now see if there's darkness\nare there ugly parts in there\nif you can find something nod your head\nyes\nand what does that feel like where is it\ntell us\nlike my head okay\nwhat about your head\nfeels like i'm sweating so\nokay\nso the darkness is sort of localized in\nyour head\nokay so just notice it that's where it\nis\nand now as you breathe in breathe in\nthrough your nose\nand breathe into that darkness\nand it's kind of like almost like a\nsticky smoke\nkind of thing and then breathe into it\nand you're probably kind of pumping\nfresh air in and as you breathe out let\nthat out\nand now i want you to\nset that aside for a moment and focus on\nthe rest of your being once again on the\nsensation of energy entering your body\ntraveling through the circuits of your\narms and coming out of your\npalms\nand notice that even though there is a\ndark patch\nwithin you that there's a lot of you\nthat isn't dark\nand that this is who you are not all bad\nnot all good\nthat if you give yourself the time if\nyou give yourself the space\nand if you're patient with yourself\nwhat you really are will start to shine\nthrough\nand think about the difference between\nthe way that you feel now\nand the way that you feel when that\ndarkness dominates your body\nand when you can't get out of bed\nthat it's okay to be disappointed that\nyou always go back to square one\nbut then even if you do go back to\nsquare one\nthat you still have this buoyancy of\nlife and vitality that pulls you out of\nit\nand just let yourself be with that\nvitality for now\nand now one last breath\nreally deep and then really slow as you\nexhale\nwhen you're ready open your eyes\nwhat's behind the smile this time\ni'm really sweaty\nlike sweaty where\nwhere like my forehead\nis that new no i think i'm just like\nlike temperature temperature-wise hot\nright now\ni mean i've i've heard a lot of things\nin meditation and people having\nreactions i've never heard people\nget sweaty so i was like threw me for a\nloop\ni also kept like hearing my heartbeat\nand whenever i hear my heartbeat i get\nreally\nanxious but this time like it wasn't\nanxious so i don't know what that\nis but i'll take it\ni'll take i'll take whatever you're\nwilling to give raid boss\nwow no but seriously so so so i i think\nthat's important\nokay so minnie i think that you know as\nyou learn how to be comfortable\nwith your heartbeat right that you you\ncan listen to your heartbeat it used to\nbe anxiety provoking but that you can\nalso like tap into it and find like\na regularity and a calmness to it\nand just zone in on your heartbeat if\nthe circuits of energy and [ __ ] like\nthat doesn't mean anything to you you\ncan just focus on your heartbeat\nand and just sit with yourself because\nhere's the thing\nlike for the most part i don't know if\nthis makes sense or not but like what\nyou sat with is not like a bad person\nthey're not a stain on the earth\nlike it's just not what you are does\nthat make sense\nyeah and and so you just need to spend\nmore time with that person\nbecause right now the biggest problem is\nthat you spend\na lot of time with the most negative\nparts of yourself\nwe're not saying that they're not real\nit's just\nyou know the the tv is just stuck on\nthat channel\nand there's so many other channels and\nso give yourself the benefit
