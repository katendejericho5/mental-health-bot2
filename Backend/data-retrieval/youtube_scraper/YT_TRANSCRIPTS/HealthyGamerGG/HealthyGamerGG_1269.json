    "transcript": "so a couple of things so um in light of\nthe election and all of the stress\nwe're actually launching uh uh a lot of\ncoaching spots on november 9th we've\nbeen full for a couple of weeks\num and so we're gonna have a bunch more\nspots opening up next week to help you\nguys cope with the results of the\nelection\nso i just wanted to share with you we\nasked a client recently you know what\nbrought you into coaching like why'd you\nsign up and this is what they said\ni was struggling struggling with being\nstuck in life not knowing what to do not\nknowing how to proceed in life and\nfinding motivation\ni felt like my gaming habits were\nunhealthy i also didn't like my job\nand i asked myself what else i could do\nand didn't have an answer i didn't know\nwhat i was looking for i felt like i was\nin an mmo and doing all the side quests\ni was done with the starter zone and i\ndidn't know what other places existed\nso interestingly enough you know this is\nthe this is\nwhy people sign up for coaching i think\nthat's prime example of what coaching is\nabout\nit's not a medical treatment so it's not\nthere to fix your depression or anxiety\nit's\nit's there to help you get out of the\nstarter zone that's really what it's\nabout\nand uh you know if you feel stuck or\nunmotivated or don't really\nknow where to go like that's what we're\nhere for thanks for coming on\nno thank you so much for having me on i\nam uh i'm very excited about this\nyeah so um oh oh so now i understand\nyour name so obese to beast\nyeah if if you just read it as like\nobesity beast it's just like what is\nthat i don't understand but yeah it's\nlike\nobese to be beast and and so i'm\npresuming that you used to be obese\nyeah so when i was 20 years old i was\nlike close to 400 pounds so i\noh my god well probably like three i\nalways say 360\nbecause when i first started losing\nweight i was\nuh didn't want to step on a scale so i\nfinally stepped on a scale after had\nlost like a quite a bit and i saw like\nand i was like oh i probably lost like\n20 pounds um but then i've like talked\nto other people like my mom and stuff\nand she was just like i think you were\nbigger than 360 but\ni've said 360 since i started everything\nso i'm not i'm not gonna like change my\nhigh weight because you can't really do\nthat so\num yeah i always say right now 360. i\ndon't know i feel like it would be weird\nif i've always said i was 360 pounds\nthen all of a sudden like someone comes\nback after a year and i'm saying\nyeah it was 400 pounds they'd be like\nwait what how did you get heavier at one\npoint like you know\nyeah it's it's interesting yeah i mean i\ni think\nyou know if you if you understand things\nto be different it's cool to change your\nmind you know\nand yeah i mean yeah you're right you're\nnot wrong\nyou're not wrong at all yeah it's it\nsounds like maybe you're concerned about\nwhat other people think and how you're\nviewed\noh yeah yeah just checking the discord\nserver and and so what do you what\nwould you like to be called uh just call\nme john\njohn okay and and john um so i don't\nknow how familiar you are so john can\nyou just tell us a little bit about uh i\nunderstand you have a pretty prominent\nyoutube channel\nyeah so uh i so i do have a youtube\nchannel i have like a youtube channel\ninstagram all that stuff so uh i started\nthe youtube channel like after i had\nlost most of my weight\nand it was just a place for me to kind\nof so i had the instagram first\nand i was getting a lot of questions\nthat i couldn't really answer on\ninstagram\nthis was like before instagram even had\nstories or videos or anything right it\nwas only photos\nand then so i was like i had a lot of\npeople that would ask me questions\nand that i couldn't really answer just\nthrough you know kind of\ntaking a picture and writing a caption\nbecause i hate writing\nuh and so i was like you know i want to\nstart a youtube channel and\ni ended up kind of just starting that\njust kind of to give people the\nthe like give answers that people had\nquestions too give\nyeah give advance that doesn't make any\nsense but um and then\nso i started off like i wanted to do\nfull day of eating videos to kind of\nshow people what i was eating\nand then uh like a transformation video\nand then so\nthe way that it kind of took off and the\nway that um i was able to become a\nyoutuber\nwas i actually had a video that went\nreally viral it was about my loose skin\nso when you have a lot of weight to lose\nand you lose a lot of weight you're left\nwith blue skin\nand so i shared a video it's called my\nbiggest insecurity where i kind of you\nknow took my shirt off and showed people\nwhat my loose skin looked\nlike and that video just ended up like\ngoing viral\nand i mean it completely changed like\nthat video and then\nwhat i was able to do from that video\nlike completely changed like the\ntrajectory of my life um and so since\nthen i've just been\num pretty much like making making videos\nand\nstreaming and you know just being a\ncontent creator i guess\nyeah can you help me understand a little\nbit about um so\nactually let me just take a step back so\njohn are you kind of familiar with what\nwe do or\ndo you want a quick intro oh no no i'm\nvery familiar i was i\ni reached out to you guys because i was\njust like wow i've watched a lot of the\nvideos on youtube because that's where i\num and like that's where i consume a lot\nof content and so i was just like\nselfishly i was like this would be great\nto talk to dr k and then yeah i didn't\nthink anything would happen and it\nworked out so\nawesome and so so let's just talk about\nthat so you know what would you like to\ntalk about and\nand how can i help or be of service to\nyou today\nso the the first reason that i reached\nout\nwas or the so this is what was kind of\ngoing through my mind i felt like it was\na little selfish for me to this is just\nhow i am i felt like it was a little\nand i was like hey i want i would love\nto talk about the things that i struggle\nwith right and so\nin my head i was like okay how can i\nmake this sound better\nso i was like i think it would be\ninteresting um talk about\nlike the connection of like mental\nhealth and physical health because i\npersonally have\num you know dealt with like improving my\nphysical health quite a bit\nand i know like because i speak to a lot\nof people that are trying to\nyou know lose weight improve their\nphysical health and they are also\nstruggling\nwith like mental health and i think a\nlot of people\nthey think that if they improve their\ntheir weight or their physical health\nthey think that it's going to be\nlike it's going to fix their their\nmental health\num and i i thought that would be\ninteresting to kind of talk to you about\nand then for myself personally like i\nstruggle with um a lot of the stuff that\ni've\ni've watched i mean the reason i knew\nthat you i even knew about you is\nbecause i struggled with these things\nand there therefore i was watching\nvideos right\nso like anxiety and um like\ndepression i i guess you could call it\nthat at some time at some points\num and then i think another thing that i\nstruggle with which i know you've talked\nabout\nbefore is like imposter syndrome um and\nso like\nthose are probably like the main things\ni would say that i that i struggle with\nfor sure\nokay cool so let me just can i just uh\nrepeat back what i heard\njohn so um\nyou were hoping to come on to sort of\nsee if if maybe i could help you but\nthen i also get the sense that you felt\nlike maybe that was a little bit selfish\nand that you you wanted to kind of cover\nthings that can be more applicable to\nother people\nand so talking a little bit more about\nthe mind-body connection and stuff like\nthat\num which i think is i think all that\nstuff is fantastic so just a couple of\nthoughts\nuh just like a response john first of\nall i think it's totally cool for you to\nbe selfish man\nso i i think that that this channel is\nwhat it is\nbecause we talk about one person's\nproblems it's not an abstract discussion\nand and i think that's actually what's\nreally cool is that the problems that\nyou think\nmay be selfish for you to talk about are\nthe very ones that i think will help\nother people\num and at the same time if you want to\ntalk about mind-body stuff that's\nactually it's interesting because people\nsort of talk\nyou know they think i'm an expert on\nlike video games and social media and\ntechnology and stuff which arguably i am\nbut really my background is in mind-body\nmedicine i mean that's what i've studied\nfor about\n15 years um so i'd love to talk about\nthat just because you know i like to\nhear myself talk about things that i\nunderstand\nbut but i mean i you know i i would say\nthat what i\ni really try to do john is like i'm here\nto help you man and\nand if it helps other people fantastic\nbut it's\nit's um you know i think it's totally\ncool for us to just talk about\nyou and then i'll throw in mind body\nstuff because you seem to be interested\nin that so we'll roll that in cool\nso tell me excuse me so you said anxiety\ndepression and imposter syndrome\num can you tell me what you mean by\nthose terms\nyeah i can do try to do my best to\nexplain it so\ni the way that i explain when i like\nhave maybe an\nanxiety attack or a panic attack or it\nfeels like\nanother person is taking over my body\nand it's like i have no control over\nthe thoughts that they have um like and\nit's frustrating because\ni the people that are closest to me are\nthe people that i end up being like the\nmeanest two or the coldest two beautiful\num\nand the like ever since i can remember\num i've i've never been a\nlike a loud person or like i never when\ni got angry i don't\ni don't lash out i just shut down like\nand it's been like this since i was\nuh i was a kid the one of the\ni've i've shared this experience with\nlike my\nmy channel and stuff before but there\nwas one time where i was it was when i\nwas younger\ni i got into an argument with my sister\nand she said something kind of like\nabout my weight\nand then instead of like me and my\nsister's great but you know\nsiblings but um we got into an argument\nand then she said that and\ninstead of me like yelling back at her i\njust went to my room shut my door and i\nstayed in my room\nall day long like the rest of the day\nlike this was middle of the day\ni stayed in my room until like midnight\nthat night and then there's\nthere's a taco shop that was by my house\nwhen i was growing up that was open 24\n7.\nso i walked to that taco shop i bought a\nuh\nthey're actually very good they're\ncalled super nachos so they're basically\nlike nachos with carne asada beans\nrice guacamole like anything i live in\nsan diego right so mexican food is like\na really big thing here\num and so i went and i got that and i\nate the whole thing\nright like and it's like meant for four\npeople like at least\nright and and i've been like that with\nmy mom whenever we would get into\narguments when i was younger\ni would shut down like it's just how\ni've always been and then\nnow as i'm older like i can't really do\nthat as much as i\nused to because i have other\nresponsibilities so while\ni'm shutting down mentally physically\ni'm like i have to try and\ndo things still but it's i don't it's\njust so strange because it's like\nwhen i'm out of that mode of anxiety or\nthat\num like that feeling i look back and i'm\nlike what was i doing like why was i\ndoing why was i\nacting that way i i just like like\nthat's why i say i feel like someone\nelse takes over my body\nyeah because i get out of it and then\ni'm just like\nwhy was i what was i so worried about\nlike or why was i acting\nlike i'm like disappointed in the way\nthat i was acting\nsure and then it it ends up getting\nworse\nbecause of how disappointed i am in\nmyself i'll end up not saying sorry i'll\nend up not talking to the person\ni'll end up like pushing myself further\nback\nbecause i feel bad about how i was\nacting and\nand then it's like oh it's been a day\nit's been two days now it's too it's\nit's been too late for me to even act\nout um\nand then like with like the depression\nkind of is linked in with that like it's\na very\num like when i start feeling that way\nespecially if it's it over an elongated\nperiod of time\nit's like it just adds and adds and adds\num yeah and then like with the with the\nimposter stuff i feel like that's\nit's probably i'm sure it's all\nconnected but it's a little bit less\nrelated because for me\nlike i have hundreds of thousands of\npeople that follow me on all my\nplatforms right\nand i am just a dude that lost weight\nand so it's\na lot of people will message me and\nthink that i can like solve all their\nproblems\nand they they think that i am like i\njust struggle with being like i've said\nit so many times when it comes to like\nlike the weight that i've lost and like\nwhat i've been able to do\nlike i'm not special in any way like i\ndidn't i don't have something special\nabout me that made it so\nhey i can like um i was able to do this\nand no one else can and you should\ndefinitely reach out to me because i\nhave all the answers it's like dude i\nwas just a normal guy\ni was just a normal guy that was working\nminimum wage jobs\nthat was like like i said that's why i\nsay like i'm so thankful for what i do\nnow\nbecause my future then was not very\nuh bright like when i look back at it\nand so um that kind of plays into it and\ni think like\nanother thing that i kind of struggle\nwith and i think it's related to that is\ni can talk forever so\num but keep going bro i uh i struggle\nwith\nnot feeling like i'm very smart so\ngrowing up um\ni was in special ed my whole life um and\nso like i remember i went to college and\ni\ni went for like one year and i was so\nbad\nlike i i was a music major and one of\nthe classes i took they were like you\nhave to know how to read music to be in\nthis class i don't know how to read\nmusic\nand so i was just like uh okay well i\nguess i'll drop this one and\num and so like that's another thing that\nhas like followed me my whole life is\nfeeling like\ni'm like i'm dumb and so i think that\ngoes into why\nlike i have the imposter syndrome\nbecause i'm like why are people\nfollowing me i'm not smart enough to\nhelp anyone kind of thing\nlike that's again those are the thoughts\ni have when i'm that person that's like\nanxious and stuff but when i step back\ni'm like\nwell regardless of what what um\nwhat how many how many like how many\ndiplomas i might have or whatever\nlike i've still been able to help this\nmany people regardless of that\nlike i know that but again like when i'm\nin that mode it doesn't matter\nokay so okay so you know sometimes i'm\ngonna say\nbeautiful to some things but those\nthings aren't beautiful i i think it's\njust i i'm i'm\nfirst of all john i'm really excited for\nthis conversation\num i i think you're uh\nyou know your ability to\nmap out what your internal experiences i\nthink is like\namazing and i think this is\nunfortunately one of the consequences\nof you know being in your head a lot and\nsuffering\na lot right and you can see that you're\nnot actually in control\num and you just gave me so much that can\ni just\ntry to collect my thoughts and think\nabout a plan of attack\nfor for how to approach this stuff yeah\nokay so i've got a couple of thoughts\nokay so the first thing i'm gonna just\ntoss out maybe a map\nand then we can decide you know which\ndirection you wanna go\nokay so there are some things in your\nmind and we can explore the origins of\nthose things\nand then the second thing that we can do\nis we can explore\nhow those things manifest and function\nin the present\nand what i mean by that is that like you\nbecome another person right so we can\nthink about\nhow does that work in the mind where you\nbecome another person\nand so then that sort of begs this like\ninteresting philosophical question of\nlike who are you\nif you become another person and then\nlike what is the relationship\nbetween not just your body and your mind\nbut you\nand your body and your mind so we can\nthink about where that other person\ncomes from\nwe can think about how that other person\ntakes control\nand then we can also think about what\nyou do\nin response to that other person taking\ncontrol\nwhich isn't of itself a third person\nright there's the one who panics and\nloses confidence\nand then there's the you who beats\nyourself up for not doing good enough\nand the crazy thing is that's still not\nyou that's just another person who crops\nup\nand then we can also think through a lot\nof the consequences of all of that stuff\nso principles like you know why is it\nthat we're meanest to the people\nclosest to us and that actually like the\npeople that we love and care about the\nmost\nare the ones that we you know sort of\nshow our ugliest side to\nand then the last thing that we can kind\nof touch on is something about the\nimposter syndrome which is just that\nyou know all these people approach you\nand you say i'm just a dude who lost\nweight i'm not special in any way\nand we can talk a little bit about that\num and john i think oddly enough\nthat's the reason that they approach you\nin in summary\ni think because you do you're so\nauthentic that people reach out to you\nfor help\nbecause you're an ordinary guy and so if\nan\nordinary guy can do it they can do it\ntoo but if you were superhuman\nthen it doesn't apply right like it just\ndoesn't apply\nand so oddly enough i think that's\nactually where your value\nreally is you kind of say i'm nothing\nspecial and i think absolutely you're\nnothing special\nand that's what makes you priceless\nright because you've done it and you\nwere working minimum wage jobs and you\ndid do one year of college and you\nweren't something like amazing and\nspecial and\nthat in and of itself is what's so\n[ __ ] amazing about you\nand that's why people reach out to you\nso in a weird way i'd say that there's\nthere's some kind of embracing which i\nthink you know how to do\num there's some embracing of who you are\nwhich is absolutely amazing and at the\nsame time nothing special that those\ncontrary ideas in your mind can be held\ntogether\num and then the last thing that i just\nreally appreciated is that you you know\nyou do actually share some stories about\nlike your sister and stuff like that\nand i think that kind of stuff really\nhelps because it\nit it kind of gives us like not just\nabstract thinking but like this is\nactually the sequence of events\nand then we can really understand what's\ngoing on inside you\num so any thoughts or responses to that\nany direction no i mean i i think that\neverything that you just said i i\ni'm excited to talk about and i i think\nlike just\nas someone that's watched a lot of of\nyour content and stuff like i i do\ni do fully acknowledge and i'm sure that\nsome of this\na lot of the stuff that happened in my\npast which i've had a\ninteresting you know childhood um\ndefinitely affects me\nnow like sure i i know that for a fact i\njust don't know\nhow and to what extent right right like\ni'm just not totally\nsure of how right so let's dig in man so\ntell me about your as you put an\ninteresting past yeah so\nso growing up um my mom was\nmy mom and dad were both drug addicts\nand so we actually were taken away\nwhen i say we i have i have a lot of\nsiblings like seven or eight\nbut most of them are half and some of\nthem i never met because like\none of them his name's nick um he was\ngiven up\nright as he was born and i've never met\nhim right and so like a lot of my\nsiblings are like half-siblings but\num growing up like who i was with most\nin my full siblings are my brother jean\nand my sister evelyn okay so it was us\nthree that grew up with\nmy mom and kind of my dad a little bit\num but when i was really young and i\nsaid when i say young i was like three\nor four i think we were we were taken\naway from them\num from cps child protective services\nand uh because they were drug addicts\nand\nwe were put into this place is called\npolinsky here in san diego it's just\nlike a foster care place and then\nluckily seriously luckily our uncle took\nus in which is very strange because\nwe're not very close with him\nbecause if if he didn't take us in we\nwould have either one been like\nshipped off to other foster homes and\nmaybe not kept together\nor we would have been um shipped off to\nmy grand\ngrandmother who lives in um pennsylvania\nso on the east coast\nand we would have from what i understand\nwhat my mom has told us like if that\nhappened\nwe would have been there until my sister\nturned 18. like it would have been\nthere was no chance we could have went\nback with my mom so\num it's kind of a happy ending though\nbecause after about a year we actually\nwere put back with my mom which does not\nhappen very often\nwith cps because my mom actually she\nwent to a drug rehabilitation center\nit was a church um and they have like a\ndrug rehabilitation like\nthing that they do it's called it was\ncalled calvary ranch and she was able to\nget clean and she's been clean ever\nsince then\nso like you know and so it was it is\nreally cool\nbut um yeah and uh and so do you do you\nknow what your mom\nif you don't mind me asking you don't\nhave to answer this out of you know\num uh respect for her privacy but do you\nhappen to know what substances she was\nusing\nyeah it was like meth for the most part\nokay do you\ndo you know if she was using while she\nwas pregnant with you\num i honestly i i wouldn't be\nsurprised that i i don't think i've ever\neven asked i think it's like one of\nthose things i was like i don't really\nwant to know if i want to know this\nokay sure um and if i if i ask something\nthat's out of line just let me know okay\njohn\ni will but i highly doubt there will be\nanything okay i'm very open about all\nthis stuff\num but yes i'll let you know um so we\nended up getting put back with her\num but growing up like then we were\npretty much just with\nher um and my dad was like kind of\naround but then after about a few years\nwe ended up moving away from him\nit's an interesting family dynamic that\nwe can go into but like we don't not\nlike my dad we're actually i'm actually\nvery close\noh i'm close with him and his now\nbasically wife\nand their whole family like we're a big\nmixed family now\nbut at the time uh growing up uh we were\njust very\npoor i guess you could call it like we\njust didn't have much money like my mom\nwas working\num you know it's like many many many\nhours\num and so therefore we just didn't have\nlike we were\nwe're on government housing um so it's\ncalled section 8 here in california\nand so we were on that and just like\nmoney was not something we had\nvery much of and so uh kind of growing\nup\nyeah yeah it was yeah it was\nwe had some some tough times we were\nreally lucky that some of the\nlocal churches around us would kind of\nlike take care of us around like certain\nholidays\nlike we had um we had this place called\nsunshine haven that every like christmas\nthey would come like um a day before\nchristmas christmas eve for like two\ndays and they would just drop off\npresents\nbecause like they would have people like\ndonate them and then they'd go to like\nfamilies in need\ni remember this is random but like one\nyear they\nthey gave my mom a present it was\nunderwear but they were like\ncomically large and i just remember we\nall it was so funny like there were no\njoke like\nthis big you know but um\nso yeah like growing up and then and\nthen you know like\ni that's when i i started gaining weight\num because like that was a huge part of\nlike of my like childhood was\nwhen i was about seven years old and i\nremember like\nbeing frustrated because my family would\neat the same foods as me\nbut none of them were getting as big as\ni was like because i was\ni was like from seven years old up until\ni was 20 i just consistently gained and\nit was like\nit started like every year it was\nbecoming more and more of an issue for\nme\num and and then in second grade was when\ni actually ended up being\nput in special ed or rsp um resource\nspecialist\nprogram um and then from from there on\nout like i just\ni just remember like my mom tells the\nstory but like\nthere would be times where i would come\nhome from school and i would just be\ncrying\nlike because i'd be trying to do the\nhomework and like we're doing\nmultiplication\nand like everyone just understands it\nand i'm like what is this\nlike i had no idea what was going on and\ni just i don't know why i remember that\nlike from that moment i've always\nfelt like i'm not good enough um\nand like i there's something wrong with\nme kind of thing\num but i will say like all in all with\nall of that stuff that has happened\nlike that's why i'm so thankful of where\ni am now\nbecause like if we if we were to talk\nabout\nwhere you should be like i should not be\nwhere i am now\nat least in my mind um with like the\nbackground that i have\nand so that's why i'm so like thankful\nand i i try my best to\num foster i guess my community or foster\nwhat i have as best as i can\num because i know that i just i feel\nlike i know where i would be if i didn't\nhave it\nokay\njohn your story is incredibly rich man\nseriously there's so many well it's more\npoor than it is rich but\ni'm sorry uh yes\nfair point um no i bet i mean a good one\nto be honest it's not stupid it's\nactually brilliant\num but you know there's just there's so\nmuch here\nand this is going to be tough my dude i\ni think i think um\ni already sort of see a road forward for\nyou but i think it's going to be a\nlittle bit challenging and i just want\nto sketch this out a little bit\nokay\nso when you say i shouldn't be where i\nam today\nthat implies so much gratitude\nright and you kind of say i'm lucky like\nyou talk about your uncle\nand and stuff like that um\nand so the the tricky thing there is\nthat like being grateful for\nfor where you are and and feeling lucky\nis like that's a good thing right we\nwe like we respect people for that we\nwe prioritize people for that\num but there's there's actually like a\na tricky underbelly which maybe exists\nhere and i i suspect maybe it does and i\nthink this manifests in\nin some other ways which is that\nyou know if you if you don't deserve to\nbe i mean if you shouldn't be where you\nare today then in a sense you don't\ndeserve it\nright and if we if we really tunnel down\nthis is where things get really subtle\nbecause\nif you don't deserve it that sort of\nimplies\na certain value about you as a human\nbeing\nwhereas there's a part of me that tells\nyou actually like that wants to say to\nyou john you absolutely deserve\neverything that you have man in fact you\ndeserve so much more than you have\nthat sure you can be lucky and grateful\nbut actually at the end of the day\nif you look at what you deserve and what\nyou're worth it's way more\nthan what you have does that make sense\nyeah right and it's hard because\nsomewhere along the way like you started\nto\nconsider yourself lucky that you got to\nlive with your mom and like it's\nwonderful that you have that gratitude\nbut at the end of the day\nthat's not lucky bro your life\nis filled with bad beats\nright and really what you deserve is\nlike way more\nlike you do you don't deserve like it's\nwonderful that you're grateful but like\nyou've got to be really careful because\nthere's something really subtle here\nwhich is that underneath the positivity\nis this underlying belief that if you're\nlucky\nthen you didn't deserve it\nand if we kind of go back to the heart\nof the imposter syndrome\ni think that has to do with like this\nfundamental idea that like you\ndon't deserve this\nright and if we really it gets tricky so\nwe'll dig into that a little bit more\ndoes that make sense\nno yeah i mean i think that\nyeah 100 i think i think that there's\nit's kind of like i mean in layman's\nterms is what my mind is thinking is\nlike too much of a good thing\nlike there's such thing as that right\nbeing grateful sometimes can be like\nafter you turn it into being like i\ndon't deserve which i\ni don't think that that in the end is\ngoing to\nbe a net positive if that's because\nthat's that is kind of where my mind\nends up going when i go down that road\nyeah right so and that's that's and i\nthink it manifests in kind of weird ways\nlike i think that\num what i'm not hearing a whole lot of\nyou so it's funny because people who\ncome on stream\neither i hear too much anger from them\nor i hear not enough\nand and i i think there's something\nabout retreating and\nand i'm getting the vibe of anger that\nis manifesting\nin different ways like it's like anger\nyou know\nthere's a there's a lot of injustice in\nyour story actually\nand i think sometimes we kind of look at\nourselves and we say like what's the\npoint\nof like bitching about unjustice and how\nunlucky we are\nand and that sort of makes sense because\ni think a lot of times that too can be\ntoo much of a bad thing and then it kind\nof\nyou know we're just complaining all the\ntime and so i think you've learned how\nto be incredibly positive\nhow to pick yourself up by your\nbootstraps how to you know i i think\nit's clear that you've gone from\nobese to beast and the interesting thing\nis that that journey\nactually i i get the sense that you've\npushed a part of yourself off to the\nside\nand then you have this like little boy\nin the basement like this seven-year-old\nfat kid who doesn't know how to do\nmultiplication\nand then every once in a while like\nsomething happens and the fat kid comes\nout of the basement and that's how you\nfeel right like even i i would venture\nwhen you when that other person takes\nyou over you're not even an adult\ni mean yeah i feel like i'm being a\nchild is like because you are being a\nchild\nyeah yeah because you are and that's not\nan un\nand this is the really tricky thing john\nboy dude this is going to be tough bro\nbecause because what i what i would love\nto help you do\nis to not discount the fact that you are\nbehaving like child because you are\nbecause that's\nwhat happens and we'll talk about the\nmechanism of what's happening in your\nmind\nbut for you to acknowledge that you are\nbehaving like a child\nand that you deserve to do so\nright because when you when you beat up\nthat seven-year-old kid what does he do\nhe goes he\neats a plate of super nachos\nand then you know goes into the basement\nand you push him in\nand then like he comes out again and\nhe's gained five pounds\nand then over time despite all of your\nsuccesses you've taken all of your\nnegativity\nand you've kind of like condensed it\ninto this one thing\nthat pops out of the surface every now\nand then\nand so it's kind of like i i don't doubt\nthat you've grown and it's clear that\nyou know\ni mean you've grown immensely john and i\nthink this is the real challenge\nis that you know i think you've picked a\nlot of the low-hanging fruit so your\ngrowth\nnow the the more pure you become\nthe more subtle the growth that you have\nto do and actually the harder it becomes\nright if i have like a really dirty\ntable i can just take\none swipe of a cloth and do a lot of\ncleaning but if i only have one speck of\ndust left i really have to look really\nreally hard\nand and i'm laying the foundation for a\ncouple of principles that\ni'll explain later about mind body stuff\num but any thoughts about that\nno i mean i i think it all it all makes\nsense\num it's i it's interesting um like the\nthing that kind of stuck out to me\nuh like the one thing that when you said\nit i was like oh interesting i would\nhave never\nthought that was like you were acting\nlike and you deserve to do\nthat in my mind it just it's this\nfeeling of\nno like don't act like that you need to\nlike i beat myself up right like when\ni'm acting that way\nand then that's what it's it turns into\nthis cycle that i was explaining then i\ndon't reach out to the person and then\nit's like\nyou know so i thought that that was\ninteresting yeah so let's talk about\nthat for a second right because i said\nthat's actually a third person\nthere's john there's the seven-year-old\nfat kid\nand then there's the kid who beats up\nthe seven-year-old fat kid\nyour first step forward and this is the\nproblem that a lot of people run into is\nthey think\nmy problem is the seven years does it\nhurt your feelings when i say\nseven-year-old fat kid\nnot at all is that insensitive okay no\nthat's fine\nso so i and i think the problem is that\neveryone looks and they say oh the\nproblem is that the seven-year-old fat\nkid keeps on coming out of the basement\nand they say that's the part of me that\ni want to change\nand the reason that they stay stuck is\nbecause that's not actually what you\nneed to change\nyou need to change before that you need\nto change\nthe bully that lives within you\nand once you change the bully then\nyou'll be able to deal with the fat kid\nbut the real problem is like\nyou know the the fat kid's a little bit\nof a distraction\nand so that now the next question is is\nyou know where did you learn\nhow to judge yourself that way like like\nit's this judgment i think that we\nactually need to start\nand so can you tell me you know did\nother people judge you growing up like\nlike let's talk talk to me about\njudgment because you're so good at\ntelling me stories like tell me stories\nbro\num that's a good question like where did\ni learn about judgment i think like\njust growing up and feeling like\ni was you know feeling like i was poor\nand so like always trying to\nprove to people that i was maybe worth\nlike being like a friend of theirs you\nknow like\nuh i remember in in junior high i\nremember like there was this group of\nfriends\nlike because like growing up i was\nreally big into church\num and there was this group of friends\nthat i had in junior high\nthat i was like i knew\ni should not be hanging out with these\nkids like i i knew as far as far as what\nmy morals were like they were they were\nlike\npeople that were like already already\nsmoking a lot of pot they're already\nlike\ntalking about drugs all the time like\nall this stuff that i personally like\nwas not into\nand i didn't want to get into it but\nthey were cool\nlike they were the cool kids in school\nand so the fact that they wanted me to\nbe a friend\num i was like okay well that that makes\nme cool then\nand i just i remember like there'd be a\nlot of times where i would just\nlike one thing that i really really did\na lot\nin junior high and in high school and\ni'm not sure if this is answering your\nquestion but this is just what\ncame to my mind is i was very good at\nmaking fun of myself\nand so i hated hated hated\nif someone made fun of me like i did not\nlike that so\ni was very lucky okay it was a\ndouble-edged sword i was very lucky\nbecause i didn't have a lot of people\nmake fun of me but the reason\nwas because i made fun of myself so much\nand i've talked about this kind of\nbefore it's like\nso i would i would put on this mask of\ni'm the funny fat guy that's what i\nwould call i'm the funny fat guy\ni i have a i have a tattoo on my calf of\na cupcake\nbecause my name in high school was\ncupcake like everyone called me that\nand like the reason i got that nickname\nwas because there's a group of people\nthat were trying to be mean to me\nand make fun of me and call me cupcake\nbecause i was fat and so i was like\ni like that name and i i internalized it\nand i like when i graduated they said\njohn david cupcake glad\nlike it was like everyone knew me as\ncupcake in my high school right\nand so i had this like mask on of i'm\nthe funny fat guy like\nno one would make fun of me because i\nwas always doing it all the time\nand so it was like the reason i say it\nwas a double-edged sword was because yes\nno one made fun of me\nbut i also felt like i was garbage like\ni felt\nlike because of how much i would make\nfun of myself and how much i was a joke\ni started to just believe you are a joke\nlike you're not worth anything like\nyou're worthless right\nthat's something that i like when i'm in\nthat mode that i was telling about like\nthat's the\nfirst thing that comes into my mind is\nyou're worthless like it just pops up\nand like i'll be like like i say when i\nwhen i say that i\num the people that are closest to me get\nthe most of it like i'll be texting my\ngirlfriend and all of a sudden it's just\ni'm worthless i'm a piece of crap\ni'm garbage and it's like\nand i'm like what it doesn't make any\nsense looking back\nbut in the moment it's like why does it\nmake any sense\nlooking back because like\nthe john that we see now i guess you\nsaid there's like three different\npeople right the john looking back is\nlike\nyou are like you've done so much like\nyou've you've been through so many\nthings and you've been able to get\nthrough them\nand you you've been able to help so many\npeople out like that's obviously not\ntrue\nbut it's like when i'm in that mode\nnothing\nanyone says like any no matter how much\ni care about you\nknow it doesn't matter like it just like\ni've i've\nseen other people explain it this way\nlike i feel numb is like\nthere's just it doesn't matter what\nanyone says i am\nthis is what i am and it's the truth and\nthen it might be i wake up the next\nmorning and i look back and i'm like\nokay\nthat's definitely not true or sometimes\nit'll happen during the day and i all of\na sudden kind of\nlike i don't know what starts happening\nbut it's like i can start to see i get\nso hyper focused on these thoughts\nand then i start to be able to not be so\nfocused on them and think about other\nthings and\nand then i'm like okay like that's not\nthat's not true um yeah i don't know if\nthat answered your question\nanswers so much but i have so many more\nso so i i'm gonna say something a little\nbit provocative but i think it's\nimportant\nto tease apart what you're saying okay\nso when you say looking back it's just\nnot true i actually disagree with that\nokay i think looking at the now it's not\ntrue\nbut when you look into your past\nyou know 14 year old cupcake it was\nabsolutely true\nright so so this is the first thing\nyou've got to understand john some of\nthe things in our mind and maybe i need\nto just take a step back and explain\nsome concepts like teach\nbut some of the things in our mind so if\nwe think about like ptsd for example\nokay so people have flashbacks so like\nwhat happens in a flashback\nso let's say that i'm you know i'm in a\nwar\nand then like i experienced like a\ncombat situation where like one of my\nfriends gets\nyou know blown up by like a missile\nlike you know i use a drastic example\nbecause i'm thinking about a particular\nperson who exemplified this\nand then what happens is like when i'm\nwalking down the street if there's a\nloud\nbang what happens in my mind\nso my mind transports me\nto that point in the past\nright and then like i have this thing\ncalled a flashback\nwhere like i i lose sight of where i am\ni lose sight of who i am\ni can be 70 years old and that have been\nin the vietnam war\nwhen i was 25 and when i hear a bang\ni get transported i become that 25 year\nold self\ni don't become a grandfather who you\nknow has lived so much\ni'm like a scared kid in like the\njungles of vietnam\nwhere my friend just died in front of my\neyes that's what i've become\nand so if we if we stop and think about\nthat like\nhold on a second like that's weird right\nso the first thing that we've got to\nacknowledge\nis that our mind and our brain has the\ncapacity\nto transport us into the past\nand this is the problem is that i think\npart of the reason you're stuck is\nbecause\nyou try to tell yourself that you're not\nworthless\nbut you feel like you are worthless and\nso so there's like this conflict where\nyou're like fighting against yourself\nwhen you\nfight against yourself you're not gonna\nwin\nright it's kind of weird so so i think\nin a bizarre way\nlike what you need to do is like\nactually accept that\nyou were worthless and this is this is\nthat your road forward is like not to\nsay you weren't worthless because\nthat's how you felt it it's that you are\nworthless and that's okay\nright like if i think about it i was\njust talking to\nto someone about this recently but you\nknow if we think about\nwhat you need to do for yourself john\nit's like like when you call yourself\nworthless like that's you judging\nyourself\nand then there's even like a fourth\nreaction of and let me know if i lose\nyou here which is that you beat yourself\nup for calling yourself worthless\nso it doesn't matter how far you go down\nthe road\nit's always you beating yourself up even\nthough it is cloaked in positivity\ndoes that make sense yeah\nand so so like you know there's a part\nof me that says like\nyou know if i had to transport back in\ntime to cupcake\nmy message to cupcake is not you know\nyou're a beautiful person and and\nlike there's nothing wrong with you or\nanything like that that's actually not\nmy message to him because i don't think\nthat that's a fair message\nmy message to him is hey man you got\nlike i know you're struggling right now\ni know you're overweight i know a lot of\npeople\nmake fun of you and you make fun of\nyourself\nbut i don't think i don't agree with\nthem i know you feel that way\nbut you won't be this way forever\nand that if you work at it you can grow\nand you can change\nbut right now i have no doubt that you\nfeel\nabsolutely worthless because you don't\nget good grades kids make fun of you you\nmake fun of yourself and you're\noverweight\nso i see why you feel worthless because\nyou look around and you don't see any\nvalue\ni know it's in there you've just got to\nwork\nto go from obese to beast right\nand even then like i think that your\nanswer is actually in your name because\nyou don't say\nbeast always you are not always\nright and and so so it's actually\nbeautiful because i think what resonates\njohn with like other people and what\nmakes you not an imposter\nis that in your name you own\nthe obeseness you own it but when you\nstart beating yourself up and you start\nfeeling that way\nit's like beast back to obese in your\nmind but like that's okay you've got to\nown like\nyou're you're the spectrum right you've\ngot to balance like\nthe confidence that you have it's not\nabout like one winning over the other\nit's like balancing both of those things\ntogether\nthat make sense yeah what what are you\nhearing\nlike i can't like if i\nif i i have to i guess what i'm hearing\nis like you have to live in that moment\nsometimes like you can't like i'm\nbeating myself up for\nlike i'm telling myself i'm worthless so\nthat's in turn obviously that's beating\nmyself up\nbut then i am also beating myself up\nafter the fact\nbecause i am saying why would you say\nthat that's not true\nso now i'm like being myself well that's\nstupid and you're being stupid and\nyou're being childish\nthere it is right so it's the same thing\nit's just\nlayers and layers and layers and layers\nof the same\ncomplex which is that john you're not\ngood enough\neven when you are trying to be positive\ntowards yourself that's\nactually negative does that make sense\nyou're like\nyou've accomplished so much why are you\nso\ndumb that you can't see it yeah\nyou're still calling yourself it's the\nsame [ __ ] thing it's like\nyou know and so so so\nthat's what needs to change and the way\nthat we start changing that is to is to\nthink a little bit about like\nyou know to say that okay i i sometimes\ni feel worthless like that's cool\nright just because i feel that way and\nbecause even i know this sounds crazy\neven if i am that way right now it\ndoesn't have to be that way forever\nbecause that's a statement you can get\nbehind\n[Music]\nright if you if you find yourself\nretreating from your friends and your\nfamily and girlfriend and whatnot\nyou can say okay sometimes i've got a\nretreat because that's who i am\nyou know i i i've grown in a lot of ways\ni haven't quite grown in this\nand just because you haven't learned it\nyet john ballpark how old you are\ni'm about to be 28 in a few days okay\ncool so like you just think about that\nright like think about where you were\nwhen you were 18.\nwhere you were five years ago you've\naccomplished\nso much in the last five to ten years\nand you've got at least 40 good years\nahead of you\nand so you may feel worthless now and\nyou may beat yourself up but\nyou can learn how to not beat yourself\nup over the next decade it's really cool\nto beat yourself up\ngive yourself some time give yourself\nsome space\nyou know and and like you've you've made\none transformation in your body and for\nthe next decade of your life you're\ngoing to focus on a transformation of\nmind\nand you have to accept that you're\noverweight like\nright but you have to start with the\nacceptance that you are overweight and\nso i think you can also start with the\nacceptance that\nmentally like you do things to yourself\nwhich are not ideal\nbut that's actually okay yeah\nright because you've got you've got the\nbeast working with you\nyeah i think like just\nfor me to help me kind of process this\nthe way i\nlike what i'm hearing and like what what\ni'm hearing is so i get a lot of people\nthat will ask me\ni want to lose weight and i want it like\ni want to lose 50 pounds in a month or\nwhatever\nand i always have to say it it takes\ntime like it's not gonna happen\novernight\nand so i haven't turned like i believe\nthat right but i think with\nthe stuff that we're talking about i get\nfrustrated that i i'm like that person\nthat's asking me the question to you is\nlike fix me right now i would like to\nhave everything\nfigured out and and i'm like when\nthey're asking me i'm like yo that's not\ngonna\nit just doesn't work like that it's\ngonna take a long time and i\nam it's funny because i'm like being\nthat person to you almost\nsure is like how can i fix this right\nnow and then you're just like it's gonna\ntake a while man\nso that's interesting to hear yeah so so\ni i think it's interesting that that's\nwhat you took away\nand i think that actually demonstrates\nto me that you understand it already\nright so i i think that that what you\nneed to do is like just like you\nencourage those other people to give\nthemselves time and be patient with\nthemselves\ngive yourself time and be patient with\nthis\num yeah that's that's\nthat's very well said john let me just\nthink any questions\nnot really i mean i'm sure i'll have\nsome stuff when we're towards the end\nbut right now i'm kind of\nenjoying kind of working through it okay\nyeah\nso um let me just\nthink for a second about where to go\nfrom here\nokay so we can we can do a couple of\nthings either we can dig\nfurther let me just teach you a couple\nthings actually okay\nokay and then you tell me what you're\ninterested in\nso let's talk about the mind body\nconnection for a minute so the first\nthing\nis that um you know i think there's a\npart of you that\nfeels stupid right so like the part that\ncouldn't do multiplication the part that\ncouldn't\num read music and and maybe this makes\nyou feel like an imposter so let me just\nstart by saying john\ni think that\nwe have this idea that some people are\nsmart and some people are stupid but\nwhat i really like from eastern medicine\nis that they say that they're different\nkinds of minds\nright just like they're different colors\nof hair they're like different kinds of\nminds\nand some minds aren't great at like book\nsmarts\nand some minds are not designed to sit\nin a classroom for like eight hours a\nday and like look at a textbook\nit doesn't mean that they're stupid it\njust means that your mind is different\nand i think that like so one of my\nteachers explained this to me like there\nare some people who are hunters and some\npeople who are farmers\nand the farmer mind like likes to wake\nup at the same time every day\nlikes to sit in their chair read their\nbook like like routine like everything's\nthe same like\ni don't like disruptions i can just i\nlove multiplication i love reading music\ni love anything\non a page that i can read and no one\nbothers me\nand then there are hunters and hunters\nare like i'm not going to sit around and\nlike sow seeds every day i want to be\nout in the wilderness i want to be\nlooking around\ni want to absorb a lot of stimuli i want\nto integrate a lot of stimuli\ni want to make a lot of decisions with a\nlot of uncertainty like which way do i\ngo is this\ndangerous is this not dangerous it's\njust different kinds of minds\nand and i don't know i mean do either of\nthose mindsets resonate with you\ni mean the hunter one definitely is is\nwhere\nit's it's interesting because there's\nlike parts of each i guess\num so for me like routine is like it's\nvery important to me like i\nwhen i when i am thrown off of my\nroutine that is definitely like i've\nnoticed that's a trigger of my anxiety\nlike it definitely can make me\nanxious but at the same time like i\nwhen i was a kid i was like diagnosed\nwith add and like i took woodland for a\nlittle bit\num and so i'm definitely very like i\nlike to\nto do things though like i like to um\nlike\ni can't just do one thing forever like\ni'm sure you've noticed like\ni'm always fidgeting i'm always messing\nwith something it's just how i am\nyeah um and so it's interesting but i\nwould say\ni i probably would lean more towards\nlike the hunter\nin that explanation i guess yeah so so\nit's it's not\nthey're not mutually exclusive first of\nall and there actually are three\nnot two so it's like a three-dimensional\nthing um but\ni i think you know just one thing to\nthat i would encourage you to just kind\nof\npotentially re-conceptualize your\nupbringing is that like\num and i wouldn't quite go as far as to\nsay that you weren't book smart i think\nyou just you probably needed a more\ndynamic learning environment\nor frankly just more like one-on-one\nattention\nso there's a there's an interesting kind\nof statistic it's a little bit\ni'm extrapolating a little bit but\nbasically what we find is that\nkids who are the less attention\nan individual child has the more likely\nthey are to be diagnosed with adhd\nso growing up it sounds like you were in\na single parent household with\nwith two siblings and and so what i what\ni find\nfrankly as a clinician is that there are\nsome kids who are highly highly dynamic\nand actually incredibly smart and\nwhether they go down the path of special\nneeds and adhd\nor not has nothing to do with like their\nintellect it has\neverything to do with the amount of\nindividual attention that they can get\nand if you can have because actually\nwhat happens with with really smart kids\nis they get\nbored easily in class right and then\nthey start to fidget\nwhereas if you have someone who can\nengage them in kind of a dynamic way\nthe kid is going to be like awesome like\nthey're going to be fantastic\nyou'll let their brilliance like kind of\nflourish they just need a different kind\nof soil\nand what i'm hearing from you is that\nprobably the most likely thing is that\nyou weren't given the right kind of soil\nthat you needed to grow\nand now i think part of the reason that\nyou're so successful is because you've\nfigured out oh like minimum wage job is\nnot going to be\ni'm not the guy who gets like minimum\nwage job and then becomes a manager\nand then becomes a vp and that like\nyou'd [ __ ]\nf that [ __ ] right it's like a little bit\nof youtube video\na little bit of physical activity i'm\ngonna cook this today\ni'm gonna take these pictures for\ninstagram i'm gonna answer some\nquestions\nyou're like a hunter you're like out\nthere and you're like oh there's a track\nover here what is this i smell something\nover here\noh there's some like you know poop over\nthere like\nyou're you're kind of integrating a\nbunch of information i think that's just\nthe fertile soil that you need\num and i i think for a lot of people out\nthere like this is important to remember\nis that like if you got diagnosed and\nyou felt dumb\nit's not so much that you were dumb or\nthat you're mentally ill\nit's just that like there's a different\nkind of environment that that child\nneeds to thrive\num any thoughts about that\nno i mean i i agree and i think that\ni mean there were things that um my like\nthe teachers would try and do when i was\nin\nin school like there was uh i also have\nlike dysgraphia so like\nmy handwriting is absolutely so bad um\nso they would like try\nit sucks because my handwriting's really\nbad but i'm also unbelievably slow at\ntyping like i type like 20 to 30 words a\nminute like it's really bad\nbut they ended up giving me this like\nlittle it was before like computers and\nlaptops were like that people had them\nso there's this little like machine that\nthey had that they would give me so i\ncould type instead of trying right\nand i remember like i knew that they\nwere trying to give me this thing to\nhelp\nbut i remember it felt like it made\nthings harder for me and then i was like\neven this help that they're trying to\ngive me is making me\nfeel worse right yep um and i just i\nremember feeling like\nlike i mean this is when i was like\nyoung i was i was\ni was in like elementary school at this\ntime and uh\nand then they were like i remember there\nwere things where they would have like a\nperson come in and grab me\num i'm not sure if this was to do with\nmy learning disability if it was like\nhome\nstuff because of the drugs but they\nwould like bring me into a room where it\nwas just me and this person\nit was like during math class like math\nclass when i was really young\nand they would bring me in there and\nthen we would do different types of math\nso we would like work with blocks or\nwork with like\nyou know what i mean like and it would\nbe one-on-one instead of just like the\nthe class um i remember that but i do\nremember\nat that whole little typing thing\nand feeling like this is supposed to\nhelp and it's not helping made me feel\nlike well you're just kind of a lost\ncause\nwhen i was like you know in like super\nsuper young\nand i remember that being like tough for\nme yeah so let's think about that for a\nsecond john once again\nwonderful dude the way your mind forms\nconnections is really amazing and you're\njust a fantastic storyteller\nso so let me ask you something john\nthink about the way that you felt\nwhen they get gave you that typing\nmachine and it like still didn't help\nand how you feel when you have a panic\nattack\noh it's it's exactly the same man like\nit's\nit's it's so much the same that i\nremember\ni recently was like telling people i was\nin my discord and i was like hey you\nknow i'm trying to work on my typing\nand i like i shared out like where i'm\nat and it was like 30 minutes\nit made me like it it made me cry and\ni'm like tearing up thinking about it\nbecause people started like sharing\nit's so silly uh people started sharing\ntheir how fast they were and they were\nlike how are you so slow that's\nridiculous\nand i just remember i just felt like the\nkid again and i just\nshrunk back and i was just like i don't\nit made me\nbecause i like to share a lot but then\nat the same time like sometimes when i\nshare stuff\npeople will say that stuff and i know\nthat they weren't trying to mean of\ncourse they're not\nbut it made me feel so small and it was\nlike\ni am that i am the same like nothing has\nchanged like it makes me\nfeel like nothing has changed and i'm\nstill that person and i just remember\nlike\nhonestly like you were saying there was\nanger i was mad like i was mad at those\npeople and i wanted to like ban\nthem or i wanted to like reply and i was\nkind of saucy a little bit\nbut like i wanted to be like you don't\nknow what i'm dealing with you don't\nunderstand how hard this is for me\nbut i was just like i'm not gonna do\nthat like it's it's not like\ni tried to take a step back and be like\nokay let's think rationally here\nthey're not trying to be mean to you\nlike you are\nthis is your perception of the situation\nbut i just remember like that little\nthing man\nlike it really messed with me it really\nit\nmessed with it just made it made me feel\nstupid is the\nis like the most that's the easiest way\nto kind of explain it\nyeah it's it's uh once again a beautiful\ninsight into\nyou know a painful thing john because i\ni think that the takeaway there is like\nonce again what you're feeling john\nis not you it's an echo\nright that hurt you carry with you\nbecause it's never been processed\nand if you want to be free of it you\nhave to like process it so let me ask\nyou this\nhow did you feel towards the people who\nbrought you the typing machine\ni think initially i felt special\nbecause it was like wow this is like\nagain it was before\nthere was a lot of stuff like that out\nthere so i was like oh i have this cool\nthing\nbut then it started to feel almost like\na scarlet letter\num because everyone else is writing and\ni have this machine\nbut then i felt like okay my teachers\nnow are probably gonna think okay he's\ngonna do better but i was so\nunbelievably slow at it that it was like\nthis\nmachine that they gave me to help is\nmaking me i feel like it's making me\nfeel worse\nso at the start it felt nice because i\nfelt special but then it felt\ni just started to feel worse and worse\nand worse because\nand then it was like i wanted to prove\nto these people that i like\ni should have this but i just and so it\njust became like this kind of thing of\nshame that i had\neventually i just stopped using it\nbecause i was like well this isn't\nhelping me at all\nokay how many other people when they\ngraduated had a nickname\nread out no one there's your scarlet\nletter\nso so like i was saying uh you know just\nto recap you had sort of said that you\nfelt like\ni'd asked you about the um\ni had asked you about you know what it\nfelt like to have the\nthe typewriter or whatever and then you\nkind of felt like they labeled you with\nsomething different\nyeah and you had a scarlet letter and\nthen i had asked the question for people\nwho missed it\num you know how many people had a\nnickname when they graduated\nand then you'd said none um and i think\nthat's just an example of you\nsolidifying your isolation from\nthe rest of the world right and you kind\nof owning that part but at the end of\nthe day\nyou're still isolating yourself and i\nthink that\npart of you know i i'd imagine that when\nyou feel worthless when you have that\nkind of panic attack you also feel\nincredibly incredibly isolated oh yeah\nyeah yeah and that no one understands\nyou\num can you tell me a little bit about\nthose feelings or explain those or just\nshare with us what it feels like when\nyou have these panic attacks\nyeah i can try um\nit feels like i said it\nlike there's this numbness where it's\nlike no matter what anyone says to me\nno matter any it just doesn't matter\nlike i can\nlike i said i struggle with being still\nand like not\nyou know like my 80d but like when i'm\nin this mode i\ncan be dead still staring at a wall for\nan\nhour not even thinking about it like i\ndon't\nit's this crazy feeling of like i just\nfeel like\nnothing matters like nothing matters no\nnothing anyone says matters and um\ni just start i'll end up i guess the\ni've heard the word catastrophizing so\nlike i feel like i'll\nend up trying to find the worst\nthings things that can make me feel the\nworst and then i focus on those things\nand so like i'm intentionally being i'll\nintentionally be really mean to myself\nand this is where i say like i'm mean to\nother people because again obviously if\ni'm close to someone and they know this\nis going on they're trying to reach out\nand help\nmy girlfriend is the person that comes\nto mind and i'm just like\nsuper dismissive and i'm just like i'm\nthis i'm worthless i'm\na piece of garbage like i'll say these\nthings that are just so\nmean like that you know if someone were\nto say it to me i'd be like screw you\nman like what are you talking about\nbut like i have no problem saying it to\nmyself\nand but i would say like the thing that\nit's like the world kind of like i don't\nknow if you had the\num the new airpods but like the new\nairpods are noise cancelling\nyou put them in they make like this\nthat's what it feels like\nthat's how i feel like the world that's\nwhat i feel like happens to the world\nwhen i'm having those feelings i can\nalmost like hear that\nsound and then the noise cancellation is\nthere and but instead of noise\ncancellation it's like world\ncancellation\nwhere anything else that's going on\ndoesn't matter\nuh like there could be bombs going off\nnext door and i'm like i don't freaking\ncare\nyou know yeah john honestly it's bizarre\nbut this sounds to me like a\nlike when i've worked with people with\nptsd and they have flashbacks\nit sounds like a flashback right so so i\nwork with someone who's a teacher\nand then something happened in school\nand they like jumped under their desk\nright and like they weren't in school\nanymore like the rest of the world\ndisappears and they're like trapped in\ntheir own mind\nand and that's honestly what it sounds\nlike to me like you become sort of\ntrapped\nwithin your own mind and it seems like a\nreally dark\nplace yeah i mean it can be in those\ni mean it certainly can be in those\nmoments like that's why i said i feel\nlike i'm a different person because it's\nlike\nmy mind changes as well yep um\nthere's only been like those happen i\ndon't want to say they happen like super\nfrequently it'll be maybe\nonce a month or something like that i've\nonly had one time where i genuinely felt\nlike i was having a panic attack\num where i remember it was towards like\nthe beginning of\nthe beginning of quarantine um and i\nremember\ni had injured my back doing a workout\nand so i was\ni was very like immobile at the time and\ni know for me working out is a huge\nform of stress release for me like it\ni've noticed that\nfor sure um and so i was dealing with a\nback injury and i remember i\ni was in the shower and then i remember\nthinking\nwow i'm like it's like really hard to\nbreathe right now like i'm like\nsomething's kind of going on like my\nhead feels kind of weird\nand i remember i uh i ended up getting\nout of the shower and i got into my bed\ni didn't i didn't even dry myself off\nbecause i was like i feel like really\nweird and then i got into my bed and\nthen i remember\ni was like oh i think i might i think\ni'm gonna throw up so then i went back\ni went back into the bathroom and laid\nby the toilet\nand i i remember just like i felt like i\nwas going to die\nlike it really felt like i felt like i\ncould i could\nthe reason i brought up it was the\nbeginning of quarantine was because i\nwas like i was like super stressed out\nabout coronavirus i was like what\ni could do am i like every day i felt\nlike i think i have it i think i have it\nand i would be like stressed out about\nit\nso then i was like i was like checking i\nwas like doing the whole thing where i'd\nlike hold my breath\nand like oh can i still breathe and then\ni was like i was super\nsuper worried about that and then\ni started like feeling like i could feel\nlike my heartbeat in my ever\neverything like i just felt like my\nwhole heart was being and i genuinely\nwas like i think i'm i think i'm gonna\ndie right now\nlike i was i seriously thought i was\ngoing to die\num and i remember i ended up like i was\njust lit i just laid in my bathroom\nfor a while and then i finally started\nto like like i said like the the noise\ncancellation kind of started to lift\nand i could like stand up but it was\nlike that's only happened to me one time\nbut it was like\nthe scariest thing i think i've ever\ni've ever been through\num but those like other moments that\ni've talked about frequently they happen\nyou know like pretty frequently i guess\nlike once a month once every few weeks\nyeah so\njohn thank you for sharing that just a\ncouple of thoughts so the first is that\nit sounds like it was quite profound and\npowerful of an experience\nyeah and yet my preference would be to\nfocus on the other ones because those\nhappen more frequently yeah\nyeah yeah i think that it just came to\nmy mind no no i'm glad you shared it the\nother thing that i would tell you is\nthat really does sound like a panic\nattack\nso yeah that's nothing nothing you have\nsaid so far has made me think\nyou need to uh potentially an evaluation\nor treatment\nfor an actual like illness um\nbut i i would say to you at this point\nthat you know if that kind of thing\ncontinues to happen you should\nabsolutely go see a doctor about it\nyeah okay so for people who don't know\njust a real quick\nreason to go see a doctor is that so one\nof the hallmarks of panic attacks is a\nsense of what they call\nimpending doom so people like actually\nthink\nthat they're gonna die and so it's it's\na strange thing to ask someone but\nsometimes i'll ask people\ndo you have a sense of impending doom\nand if people have panic attacks they're\nlike [ __ ] yeah that's it that's what it\nis\nlike it's like it's a sense of impending\nlike this\nis real and i'm gonna die now and\nand that's what happens and it's\nessentially a physiologic response right\nso like your\nyour your adrenaline is through the roof\nand things like that and then\nall your danger circuitry lights up in\nyour brain\nand then like this is the part of your\nbrain that like warns you about death\nand and the problem is that normally\nthat part of your brain\nonly activates when there is impending\ndeath\nyeah but what's happened is that our\nbrain now lives in a society\nthat we have not evolved to live in and\nso sometimes that circuit of our like oh\n[ __ ] we're gonna die circuit\nthat's the technical neuroscientific\nterm that circuit sometimes\nactivates inappropriately because it\ndoesn't have like tigers and stuff to\nworry about\nso it activates in relation to like\npaying rent at the end of the month\nand other things like that but if that\ncontinues\nthe reason that i'd really recommend\nthat you get evaluated for is because\nthere are like treatments\nfor that so that you don't have to\ncontinue feeling that way\num what brings on the other episodes\nlike the episodes that you say happen\nonce a month where you feel really\nisolated can you tell us about that\nyeah i mean it's it's so many things\nlike it can be so many things i think\nit's\nuh like you it was that that one moment\ni talked about with the keyboard\nright with the typewriting um it's it's\nlike moments where\nuh i might be like talking to\nmy my girlfriend and she might\ni i feel so bad that it's she has to\ndeal with it so often but like\nshe might say something like something\nlittle\nand then i just start to\ni so okay i mean i feel bad that i'm\nsharing this but\num she'll say something about like an x\nor a guy was like\nbeing weird to her at the gym and that\nstuff like makes me\nfeel like i guess i guess it is um\njealousy which we've talked about and\nshe's like you know i'm jealous too so\nit makes me feel a little bit better\nabout it but it's like\ni can understand why she would be\njealous\nyeah yeah so like it and and so i\nstart to feel like okay like someone's\ngoing to\nlike be better and then she's going to\nlike them more and then i start to feel\nthis way\nand then i start treating her um\npoorly you know what i mean not like i'm\nnot being mean to her but i'm just\nsuper shut off and then i'm saying all\nof these thoughts that i was that i was\nexplaining i'm like i'm worthless all\nthis stuff\nand then it like it's frustrating oh man\nwe've dealt with\nwe've dealt with this a few times that's\nwhy i'm getting so heated like it's\nfrustrating because then\nof course she's like well i don't want\nto share a lot of stuff with you if it's\ngoing to make you feel this way\nand then that makes me feel bad because\nshe's right\nand i'm like well if you don't feel like\nyou can share things with me\nwhat good am i as a boyfriend and then\nlike that's happened a few times\num and i mean there's there honestly\nlike it could be\nalmost anything if i'm in this if i'm in\nthe mood i guess or if i'm in a place\nwhere it might happen\nanything really can trigger it like it\ncan it could genuinely be anything i\nremember\ni was streaming one night and uh a bunch\nof people came in and they spammed\nvery not okay words um and\ni remember i was freaked out and then i\nstarted being like you\nidiot you should have made it so they\ncouldn't have done that like you should\nhave made it so they couldn't join the\ndiscord and say all that stuff like this\nis your fault and like like i said it it\ncan literally be anything that might\nmake me feel kind of stupid i guess is\nthe best way to explain it\nokay so that that's useful so let's talk\nabout\na couple of things right so one thing\nthat sometimes happens when we feel bad\nabout ourselves\nis we try to push people away and it\nsounds like\nyou know you try to push your girlfriend\naway and you're like if you feel that\nway i don't even know why you're with me\ni'm worthless piece of [ __ ] anyway\njust break up with me and be done with\nit\n[Music]\nand it's like hearing him just like\nit's it sucks to hear it but it's true\nlike that's pretty much\nwhat i'll say like for lack of a better\njob it's pretty much almost exactly\nverbatim how i how i act yeah and it's\nlike it's very embarrassing sharing this\nbecause this is definitely one of those\nthings that i feel the most shame about\ni can share other stuff like i can show\nmy loose skin\nand like all this stuff that people are\nlike oh that like i've had people call\nit like people will say oh your skin's\ndisgusting\nthat's so nasty and i'm like whatever i\ndon't care like this thing i'm just like\noh it's just like it's like definitely\nsomething i feel them like\ni don't want to say the most shame of\nbecause i don't know but like i feel a\nlot of shame\nyeah so john how do you feel sharing\nthis now like what are you feeling in\nthis moment this is\nwe can work through this okay i'm\nfeeling well\nthe immediate reaction is i'm feeling\nrelief um\nbecause i it makes\nme feel like i i have to act less like i\nam\nlike perfect you know because like i\nthink something i struggle with is\ni think and this is like the whole\nimposter thing is like there are so many\npeople that follow me and i\nwant to be good for them i want to be\nperfect and like i've explained\num this before and like i feel like\nthere's a lot of times where i wear a\nmask\nand then a lot of times people don't\neven like the mask that i'm wearing\nso the the thing that i put on to make\npeople like me people don't even like\nanyways\nso now i feel like i'm kind of like\nfloating\nin this like just like i'm just like\nwhat\nam i you know yeah i can't win um but i\ndefinitely i\ni just like full transparency i feel\nrelieved\nbut also i feel worried that people are\ngonna move\nthat people are gonna what the heck are\ngonna feel just like\nare you kidding me man like jeez you\nreally have some stuff to work on and\nthat\nthat scares me because i think that um\ni i i that mask is still on to a certain\nextent like i want to be the\ni know what i'm doing and i can help\neveryone you know\nyeah so it sounds like you're afraid of\njudgment yeah oh yeah yeah\nyeah so i i think interestingly enough i\nthink that that fear of judgment comes\nfrom you\nright because you judge it yeah\nand and it's because if we really pay\nattention john we can see that other\npeople can judge you and even judge you\nharshly\nbut it doesn't stick unless you judge\nyourself in the same way\nyeah right you feeling okay your voice\nhas changed\noh no no i i fully agree sorry okay\nno no i i'm just it's not anything\nyou're doing wrong\nyeah no i'm not i'm not choked up yet\nokay that's cool\ni mean we don't it's our goal is not to\nchoke you up i think this is often time\nit's a common misconception um yeah\nso let's just talk about pushing people\naway for a second because i want to i\nwant to try to help you understand that\nor at least my understanding of it\nso it's interesting right because when\nyou push your girlfriend away and she\ndoesn't\nbreak up with you how do you feel\nlike what's wrong with you um\nbut it definitely like joking that's\nkind of sometimes how i feel\num because i'm always thinking like what\nare you trying to get\nout of this like why why are you\nsticking around i think i struggle with\nthat just in general like with other\npeople\num reaching out and being like oh you\nshould like watch this video or do this\nlike i made this you should you should\ncheck it out\ni deal with that a lot and so i'm always\nkind of constantly on guard of people\nfeeling like people only want to be\naround me because they can get something\nout of that\num but then on top of that i do feel\nthis sense of um security and feeling\nlike okay well\nshe obviously definitely does care right\nbecause\nholy crap if she didn't why would she\nstick around this\num yeah so so so that's\ni'm glad you can detect that because\nthat's really an\nimportant thing and i'm glad you see it\nand know that already so john you're\nvery insightful it's i think it's\nit's cool because i think we can cover a\nlot of ground\nso i think so if we i want people to\nunderstand this too who are watching so\npart of the reason that we push people\naway\nis so that we can feel secure when\nthey don't leave right so if i if i'm\nafraid of my value\nand i say john get the [ __ ] out of here\nand then despite all of my efforts to\npush you away\nif you choose to stay then i do feel\nsecure\nyeah so it's really tricky because like\nthe harder you push her and the worse\nyou feel about herself\nconversely the more secure you're gonna\nfeel\neven in sort of like a weird convoluted\ntoxic\nway because like it's like\nit's like you're challenging her to\ndemonstrate her commitment to you\nyeah yeah and it can be very damaging\nfor relationships don't get me wrong but\ni i think part of what we have to\nunderstand is that i think like john\nmost people in our mind just works like\nthis like it does what it needs to\nto get what it needs and it sort of does\nthe best that it can\nit's on this in a bizarre way like part\nof you pushing her away\nis like a way of you actually reassuring\nyourself\nthat the things that you believe about\nyourself\nmay not be true that makes\nthat completely makes sense right and so\nso the the next question is okay so like\nwhat do we do about it and i i think the\nfirst step is just that to like notice\nthat you're doing this\nright to watch because now you're saying\nthat you don't feel like you're in\ncontrol\nand now we kind of get to an interesting\nkind of like yogic part which is that\nyou have\ntwo parts you have three parts of being\nyou have a physical body\nyou have a mental body or a mind\nand then you have something like\nawareness\nor a soul like those terms are sort of\ninterchangeably\nwhat i mean by soul is you can talk\nabout soul is something that persists\nbeyond body and mind be\nafter death and all that stuff but the\npoint here is that\neven if you don't believe in any of that\nyou don't need to what you can still\nacknowledge is that there is some part\nof awareness\nor self that exists outside of body and\nmind\nlike if i can observe my hand then i can\nthen\ni'm not my hand right like this is not\nwho i am\ni am something outside of this and then\nwhat we hear you say is that sometimes\nyou are not your mind and that something\ntakes control\nof your mind but then that still means\nthat you are not your mind\nand and so the the key thing in terms of\nlike\nmaking progress here is to focus on that\nthing\nand to even watch your mind get taken\nover\nby this thing and it's almost like you\nstart a movie and like the movie's gotta\nplay through to the end\nyou know you're like boarding a train\nand you don't get to go off halfway\nthe train only goes from point a to\npoint b and so once you start to feel\nthat vulnerability the first thing you\nshould do is just like\nwatch it run its course that you're\ngonna try to push her away and she's\ngonna reassure you\nand when she reassures you there are\ngoing to be two things in your mind one\nis like what on earth are you thinking i\ndon't understand why you're trying to\nreassure me because i'm not worth it\nand just watch that and then the second\nthing is like deep down you're actually\ngoing to start to feel\nsecure and comforted because\nyou don't feel like you're worth\nsomething and when she treats you\nwith affection in spite of you not\ndeserving it\nthat can be really reassuring\nso then that begs the question and let\nme know if you have further questions\nokay because i'm kind of in teaching\nmode now\nso then that begs the question why on\nearth does this continue to happen\nif we feel secure like you'd think that\nif she feels if she makes you feel\nsecure\nshouldn't it go away and the problem\nhere is that even though it makes you\nfeel\nsecure it still reinforces\nthe idea that you don't deserve her\naffection\nand that's at the root of all of it does\nthat make sense\nyeah and so each time it happens\neven though you feel better because she\nmakes you feel loved in spite of it\nin spite of the fact that you don't\ndeserve her love because that can\nactually feel really amazing right that\nsomeone loves you and you don't even\ndeserve it\nand so that's why you do it but the\nother really\ncareful thing is that you're building up\nthat machine that believes that you\ndon't deserve love\nand this circles all the way back to\nthis idea that you're lucky and you're\ngrateful and whatever\nand if you just go back and you listen\nto everything that you're saying john\nask yourself how many of these\nstatements thoughts or feelings\ncome from the idea that you don't\ndeserve it\nthat you're not good enough right\nyou you post something about your typing\nor whatever and then people are like\nyeah why are you so bad bro okay like\nwhy does that hurt because you don't\nfeel\nlike you're you have value on the inside\nand and all this stuff around your\ngirlfriend and like all the stuff about\nyou know it all comes back to value\n[Music]\nthoughts questions about that no i mean\nat all\nit all makes sense like i think that\na lot of it definitely comes down to\nfeeling\nlike i said like feeling like worthless\nor feeling like you don't you don't\ndeserve\nlike that's a big part of it is like i\ndon't feel like i deserve\nanything really you know and like i i\nthink it like started from a good spot\nof like\ntrying to not be selfish and like trying\nto not be like i you like\ni deserve the world like i don't want to\nbe that person you know\ni want to be grateful and thankful but i\nmean it goes back to almost like the\nvery beginning of the talk\nwe were talking about that can be\ndangerous because then it's like well if\nyou don't deserve anything then what are\nyou\nare you like and that's where my mind\ngoes yep\nand so i think it's it's a tricky\nbalance right so how do you\nha so so i think it comes down to kind\nof acceptance of of where you are\nand like how can you be grateful for the\nthings that you\ndeserve right because we think about\nlike gratitude\nand deserving is like entitlement at\nopposite ends of the spectrum but\nit's actually really simple right like\nif i um if i go to a restaurant and i\norder food\ni deserve that food and yet i can still\nbe really grateful that it tastes\namazing\nyeah right and and so and i can also be\nupset because you know i paid for like\ngood food and you guys are giving me\nlike microwave [ __ ] from yesterday\nyeah i'm allowed to be upset at that and\nalso like not be an [ __ ]\ni can acknowledge that i actually\ndeserve more than what i got\nand then the cool thing is that and now\nwe get to a really tricky thing john\nis that i don't know if you can forgive\nanyone\nif they didn't do anything wrong\nand if you didn't deserve anything then\nno one\ndid anything wrong to you right\nand so the really tricky thing here is\nthat i i don't think you're living a\nlife\nwhere you can actually like like i don't\nknow if you've forgiven your mom\nyeah you know it's in it and we haven't\nreally talked about it and you said that\nlike\nyou know she got her life together and\nlike sure there's a whole story of\nsuccess and acceptance and\ntransformation and growth which is\nreally really positive\nand there's also a story of like having\na child and like\ngoing through foster care and and a lot\nof uncertainty a lot of terror\nright frankly i can only imagine what it\nwould be like for a three-year-old to\nlike\nyou know move to some uncle's house and\nthen like\nyou talk about being grateful because\nyou didn't go into the system you can\nexpress gratitude\nfor your uncle and you can also\nbe mad at your mom for like bringing you\ninto a world where\nshe really didn't take care of you for\nthe first couple of years\nand i'm not saying that you should call\nher a bad person but like\nyou know i think it's important if\nsomeone kind of doesn't do their job\nand doesn't do right by their children\nfor the child to be able to forgive\nbecause i think that there's there's a\nlot of negative emotion there and i find\nit hard to believe that on some level\nlike you don't hold some of that\num\nyeah i think like hearing that i just i\nstruggle with it because i know my mom\nhas also beat herself up a lot because\nof\num because of it and i know like we\nwe've had conversations where\nshe like a lot of she she blames herself\na lot for\nlike how large i was as well as a child\nbecause\nuh we couldn't really afford any like\nlike presents and stuff like that but\nlike whenever we did have extra money it\nwent to like buying fast food or buying\nlike a\nas a treat right because we could\nactually that was like something we\ncould afford\nand i know that she holds a lot of a lot\nof guilt for\nthe size that i was and like she's she's\ntold me a story like she used to walk\ninto my room when i was at my heaviest\nand\nlike when i was sleeping and she'd look\nat the bed and she would like she\ndescribes like it was just a big blob on\nthe bed because of how large i was\nand she would leave the room crying you\nknow and so i like i\ni feel a lot of um i feel a lot of\npride in the fact that i've been able to\ntake that away from her\num take that guilt away because now i'm\ngood you know like you don't\nworry about it let me explain something\nto you okay dude this is important but\nstay with me\nyou haven't taken it away from her she\nstill carries that [ __ ] man\n[Music]\nlet me ask you something if i do\nsomething wrong to you\nand i feel guilty\nhow do you make me feel better\ni mean i guess like by maybe saying\nsorry and like not doing it again\nno no so so if i wrong you and i feel\nguilty\nhow do you make me feel better sorry\ni [ __ ] by saying it's all good like i'm\ni'm\nit's okay like i'll be fine ah\nso that's what you say so i think that's\nthe interesting thing right\nso the way i say that a lot i'll be fine\nyep\nso so i don't think that's what it is\nit's it's for you to say i forgive you\nit's a to acknowledge that you [ __ ] up\nwe're gonna own that together\nand i forgive you anyway but i think the\nproblem here is that when you say\nit's all good like it's subtle it's very\nvery subtle\nthe person who can get rid of her guilt\nis actually you but in order to get rid\nof her guilt you have to acknowledge\nwhat she did wrong\nand then forgive her for it yeah i\ni definitely try and i try and make\npeople not feel bad\nand so instead of being like you know\nthat was really messed up i'm like it's\nall good i'm fine\nyou know don't worry about it that's i\nsay that all the time like to my\ngirlfriend as well\nlike don't worry about it yep which\ndoesn't i guess\nleaves no one with any sort of recourse\ni guess because there you go\nright it's weird it's one of these\nadaptations that we have to maintain\nharmony but doesn't fix the problem\nand i just think about this for a second\nif you go to your mom and like it's\ngonna hurt\nright and you say like when you saw me\nas a blob\nlike there are times in my life where i\nwish\nthat you hadn't given us fast food\nbut the more that i've come to\nunderstand you and\nand things like that i understand that\nyou didn't know any better and i forgive\nyou for that\nand i also think that it's amazing that\nyou got clean like\ndo i wish the first couple of my years\nof my life were different\nyes could you have done a better job\nabsolutely and i forgive you anyway\nbecause at the end of the day you did\nget your [ __ ] together\nand you supported me in ways a b and c\nand i'm not overweight now i'm doing\nawesome in life and part of that is\nbecause of what you've given me\nand so i forgive you for what happened\nbecause at the end of the day my life is\npretty good\nnow and you did get sober right so it's\nit's like\njohn for you i mean you're so insightful\nand you're so introspective\nfor you this next phase is about balance\nof the good and the bad\nit's not good versus bad it's not\nprotecting your mom from the hurt\nbecause you don't want to hurt her\nyou have to let her be hurt and then you\nhave to let her heal\nbut because you're taking that away from\nher you're never holding her responsible\nyou can't ever forgive her and she can't\never move past it\ninstead you guys just kind of pretend\nyou know no harm no foul\nyeah which there's a part of me that\nsays that like\nfor her to truly be at peace you've got\nto let her own her mistakes\nbut make sure she doesn't fall into the\ntrap of devaluing her successes too\nyou've got to give her both the good and\nthe bad\nand then if you say mom i forgive you i\nthink then her guilt will really go away\nbecause right now it's just buried yeah\nthoughts i mean i i\ni think that you are you are definitely\nright i\num i think like this is something that a\nlot of my family has done\num i would say more most specifically\nprobably my\nmy brother and me my brother he's older\nthan i am\nand uh he is also you know doing his own\nthing he just got married they're about\nto have a baby soon and like he's gotten\nout of that kind of world\num and so we both kind of try and just\nbe like every hey we're good\nmy mom everything's fine but a lot of my\nuh\nsome parts of my family haven't really\ngotten out of it and\nthey struggle with the same things my\nmom did um\nand so i think part of why i it's so\nhard for me to do that to my mom is\nbecause i know that she's still\nstruggling with so much guilt with like\nmy oldest brother travis\nis still a he's still a drug addict and\nlike he's\ngetting arrested all the time still and\nhe's almost he's 40 years old\nand my mom i know my mom carries a lot\nof guilt\nwith with him still about him still\num and then with my younger sister she\nis\nhe's getting on the right foot but she's\nhad a lot of struggles as well\nand um my mom basically takes care of\nher child\num my niece faith who i love a lot um\nbut i know that\nshe carries a lot of guilt because of\nthat so i just feel bad like stacking\nyou know like i just like hey i'm doing\ngood mom like you\nyou i know that you have to worry about\nthem don't worry about me\ni'm cool like everything's you know i'm\ndoing i'm doing well which obviously\nisn't\ntrue but it's like that's i guess what i\ntell myself yeah so so i think it's it's\nmakes sense right because you're\nprotecting her yeah\nlike you said you don't want to stack\nguilt and so i'm not saying that the\nconversation needs to happen now\nyeah but i do think for real healing\nand and you know this reminds me of of\nyou know sometimes i hear\nsome people say that you know your mom\ndid the best that she could i hear this\na lot\nfrom from children who are protective of\ntheir parents\nyeah and they said you know she did the\nbest that she could\nyou don't say she did a great job she\nsaid\nshe did the best that she could there's\na big difference there\nand i i i'm telling you i've i've seen\nthis play out a couple of times where\nlike in the right time in the right\nplace\num you know you can have a conversation\nwith her\nand then the other thing is that\nsometimes you don't even need a\nconversation with her\nyou just need to like process that for\nyourself\nand then she'll feel because right now\nwhat she gets from you\nis like she [ __ ] knows man she's your\nmom\nshe knows that there's a wall that\nyou're putting up and you're trying to\nprotect her\nand she loves you for it but she's your\nmom and she knows that on the other side\nof that wall is hurt\nand even if you can forgive her yourself\nyou don't have to say anything to her\nbut if you can forgive her and you can\nstop protecting her and you can let\nthose walls down she's gonna know that\ntoo and i've seen that\nwhen you know we'll work through things\nin therapy with patients where like\npeople will let go of resentment towards\ntheir parents and like their parents\nlike\nit's weird like they'll meet for\nchristmas and their parents will like\nstart crying and [ __ ] and like no one\nknows what's going on\nbut like they can tell yeah i mean\nyeah i think like if even if you don't\nwant to just say it's like through\nwavelengths but like\nit definitely could be through how i\nwould act because i definitely don't i\ndon't reach out to her very much i don't\nshare much with her because again it's\nlike i'm just trying to like\ni guess like i don't want to say wash my\nhands of it but just i just like hey\nyou're doing your thing i'm doing my\nthing there's no re like i love you\nthere's no reason for us to\ntalk too much you know i don't we don't\nreally don't talk very much at all\nhow do you feel about that\nit's it's definitely something that i\ni didn't think that it would happen\nbecause i lived with her up until i was\nlike 23 or 24\num and so i lived with her so we talked\nall the time but then once i left it was\nlike almost\nbecause that that house that i was\nliving in was very crazy\nlike my sister lived there with my niece\nand it was her and then we at one point\nwe had 10 people living there with one\nbathroom like it was just crazy\nand i remember like leaving there i felt\nlike i was leaving everything behind\nand i kind of treated it that way um\nlike i just kind of stopped reaching out\nand uh and i kind of just like\ni i just wait for her to reach out to me\ni think like not because i don't care\nabout her but because like\none thing i also like really struggle\nwith is feeling like i'm a burden\nand i don't want to feel like i'm being\na burden by like hey i have this or like\ni want i need this help or i just wanted\nto reach out and say hi like even though\nthat's silly like why would i be a\nburden by just saying hi\nlike that's how i feel and so i just\ndon't you know\nokay so now we're getting into different\nterritory\nso so you know where does that feeling\ncome from because that's an echo too\noh the the burden thing is oh man\ni i think it comes from similar places\nof like the feeling stupid um because of\nthe extra help i would get i felt like i\nwas becoming a burden to other people\nand then like this is like it's it's a\nlot of\nlike when i say like i'm worthless and\nall this stuff then i'm also tacking on\nlike you're you're being a burden like\nyou're making things harder for other\npeople\nso this is why i think like i've even\nhad conversations with people that help\nme like with some of my\nmy mods and my discord and like all this\nstuff is like i don't i almost never ask\nthem for help\nand they're like dude you're weird we\nwant to help you and i'm just like\nno i'll do it myself like i just do it\nmyself it's fine like i i\nam used to doing everything on my own\nand\ni think it's because i don't like to i\njust don't want people to feel like they\nneed to help me like i want to be able\nto\ni can do on my own i don't need anyone\nto help me\nbecause i feel like if i'm being a\nburden that's like a negative thing\nand then like i'm a burden because i am\nstupid and because\ni am i i can't do things on my own\nand i just i i really really don't like\nfeeling that way because like i want to\nhelp others\ni don't want others to have to help me i\nguess\num right so i don't want others\nso so that's interesting because there's\na i\nyou tossed in one very interesting word\nthere\ni want to help others i don't want\nothers to have to help me\nyeah right yeah that i don't want like\nit's a necessity when they're helping\nyou because you can't do it without them\nand and i think there's something\nsignificant i don't know exactly\nwhat that is it's going to take me some\ntime to process that but\nthe other thing so john i would say you\nknow i'm going to give you some advice\nor ask you to do something which is\nsomething i very rarely do\ni think you should talk to your mom more\nyeah\nyeah i agree okay and and here's why\nso it sounds like your sister is still\nkind of struggling your brother is\nstill kind of struggling and you don't\nwant to help her\ni think you should give your mom a\nwonderful opportunity that your brother\nand sister can't help\ncan't give her which is the opportunity\nto help one of her children\nand it actually end up well\nright yeah you should give her the\nchance to help you\nand this is the thing she doesn't need\nto help you you don't have to have it\nhappen\nso we're gonna dispel all of that give\nher the opportunity\nif you need some support let her support\nyou\nand you know in the back your mind if\nshe can't do it no big deal you're gonna\nbe fine anyway\nbut give her the chance if you're\nworried about something or you have like\na fight with your girlfriend or whatever\nlike\nyou know if you really want to push your\ngirlfriend away talk to your mom about\nit\num right but i would say just talk to\nher man\nyeah and even even feeling like i i\ncan't tell you\ndo you have kids john no okay\nso i can tell you as a dad like kids\nburdening you is like only annoying some\nof the time\nbut generally speaking you know as a\nparent like i love to know what's going\non in my kid's life i love to be able to\nhelp that's what i'm [ __ ] here for\nand for your mom you've got to give her\nthe chance to make up for lost time\nbecause right now in her mind i can\nguarantee you that she feels that\nthere's a pile of [ __ ] that she should\nhave done for you that she didn't do\nyeah and you feel like you're a burden\nbut what you're you're really doing is\npreventing her\nfrom like paying off that debt you know\nso give her the opportunity to help you\ngive her the opportunity to be a part of\nyour life and let her see that you're\nokay\nand let her see that you're not okay\nand if you need her help like that's\ntotally cool man like\ntake her help because that's what moms\nare here for\n[Music]\nwhat do you think about that\ni mean i think that i mean it's\nit's definitely something that i\ni think will be helpful i know i would\nthe first thing i wanted to say is that\ni need to do but\ni just i didn't feel like i wanted to\nuse that those words but i do believe\nthat it is\num something that will not just be\nhelpful to me but i i know will be\nhelpful to her\nand even if it's like like yeah like you\nsaid like just being like hey mom i\nthis happened today i'm just stressed\nabout it what do you think you know and\nlike just like even like\neven though it might seem insignificant\nto me the thought that she could like\nhelp me\ntalk me through it or just kind of share\nher thoughts um\ni know that she would she would\nappreciate that opportunity\nso i agree yeah right and and you know\nlet her because i i think if we really\nthink about like\nif we really think about where this echo\ncomes from right so i i\nwhat it is in sanskrit it's called the\nsum scott so some scott is like a ball\nof undigested\nemotion or like a trauma what we're\nreally talking about is like when we\nthink about and\nand this may sound you know\nbe careful about i've been hesitating to\nsay this but i'm just gonna go and say\nit\nso if we think about really where\ninsecurity comes from there's this\nbranch of psychology called attachment\ntheory\nan attachment theory has to do with the\nsecurity of the child\nand how a child feels valued\nand there are children who grow up with\nsomething that we call insecure\nattachment or children who grow up with\nsecure attachment\nand the studies that are done on this\nhow you tell whether a child is secure\nor has insecure or secure attachment\nthey do this really cool experiment\nparent and child are in a room with some\nblocks\nand then stranger walks into the room\nlike they do this with like\none-year-olds okay\nand then mom gets up and leaves the room\nhow long does it take for the child to\nstart crying\nwhen the mom just like gets up and walks\naway like how long before the child like\nnotices\nbecomes uncomfortable with with the the\nother stranger in the room\nand then the cool thing is for kids who\nare securely attached when mom walks\nback into the room\nhow long does it take for children to\nstop crying\nhow long does it it take when they start\nto feel insecure\nwhen you start to feel worthless\nhow long does it take for other people\nto be able to reassure you\nand so for children who are securely\nattached it takes like\nless than 15 seconds they cry really\nloud and like mom walks into the room\nwithin a few seconds like the crying is\ngone what i'm hearing from you and this\nhas to do with maybe like mind body kind\nof stuff is like\ni think if you grew up in a household in\nthe first three years of your life\nwith parents who were using you probably\nyour brain learned that the world is\nlike kind of a dangerous place\nand it's hard to reassure children who\nhave insecure attachment\n[Music]\nand and so i what i'm hearing from you\nis that it's hard to reassure you\nright like when other people tell you\nit's gonna be\nokay i just don't believe him i just yep\ni'm like yeah you're lying and the\nreally tricky thing\nthere is that like why is that it's\nbecause like when you were one and\nbefore you even had memories\nwhen you were scared like it's sad to\nsay but like it probably wasn't okay\nlike it may have been something as\nsimple as like you know you needed a\ndiaper change or you were hungry or\nsomething like that and like actually\nyour basic needs weren't met it's really\nsad\ni remember one time i was um when i was\ndoing my pediatrics rotation\nwe had this one kid on the floor who\nlooked really interesting so it's\ninteresting you talk about you know\nextra skin\nso it was like a really wrinkly baby\nlike super super wrinkly like flabs of\nskin like hanging off they look like an\nold person but like a baby turns out the\nkid was very malnourished\nand so they just had no baby fat and the\nkid was just the sweetest kid in the\nworld because the kid never cried\nall the other kids cry this kid doesn't\ncry and i was like that's kind of\ninteresting like kids seem super chill\nand one of the nurses\nbecause nurses really understand [ __ ]\nokay let me explain something to y'all\nnurse was like the kid has learned that\ncrying is useless\noh that if it cries no one's gonna come\nso when it feels bad it just sits with\nitself\nit doesn't reach out to other people\nright and so if we really think about\nlike\nwhat happened to you it's like my guess\nis that it runs really deep my dude\nand the good news i know that's dark but\nthe good news is that you don't have to\nfeel that way\nright is that that can change and i\nthink that basically like give your mom\na chance to like\nlove you and take care of you\nand the next time you feel like a child\ngo running to mama\nand like just i'm curious like what\nwould happen i i'm really curious from a\ndiagnostic perspective\nyou can push your girlfriend away but i\nwonder what would happen if you went\ncrying to mama like if she would\nactually like like that's what you need\nright and that's what she needs and then\nshe gets the chance to like fix what she\ndidn't do right in the first three years\nof your life\nanyway i've been talking a lot for like\nthe last half an hour to 45 minutes\nno i i think like it's interesting that\nyou bring that up because i definitely\nhave this weird\nlike like my mom and my dad\nthey're both so appreciative when we\ntalk on the phone\nbecause we don't really see each other\nvery much my dad lives kind of far away\nlike an hour\num and so whenever if we talk on the\nphone like they're always like super\nhappy and it's weird because like i feel\ngood about that then i also almost feel\nbad\nthat they like the simple act of just\ntalking on the phone like\nbrings them so much joy and like i am i\nalmost feel like i am withholding that\njoy from them\nin some way because i'm not interested\nin really\ntalking that much like i think it might\nbe like you said like this\nsense of i'm still blaming them for\nthings so i just kind of like\ni'm just like good you guys do your\nthing we'll do our thing\nit's all good you know i'm fine uh\nand so i definitely like i what you're\nsaying now i mean it definitely\nresonates with me is i guess\nwhat i'm trying to say yeah i mean so\njohn i'm gonna put different words to it\nokay you let me know because these are\nlike kind of nasty words\ni'm fine without you i don't need you\nanymore\noh yeah yeah you weren't there when i\nneeded you and\ni don't [ __ ] need you now yeah\nright so that you've got to let go of\nman that anger like\ngotta let it go\nand and you're not going to be able to\ndo that without forgiving him\nyeah and so like to say that like i\nneeded you before you weren't there for\nme\nand i grew up anyway\nand i hate you for that\nbut i also love you\nbecause i recognize that like you had a\nhard life too\nand that like at some point you know you\ndid show up\nand that without you i probably wouldn't\nbe where i am today\nbut boy did i wish you did a better job\nbecause it caused me a lot of hurt\nand you don't have to have that\nconversation now\nyeah like you can have it when you're\nready\nbut i'm not surprised that you know it's\nhard for you to talk to them and you\nkind of say it's all good now\nbecause there's an undercurrent of like\nanger and blame underneath that\nyeah and then what we do is we we just\npile on all this positivity right like i\ndon't want to make him feel bad\nbecause all those things are true it's\nnot that those things aren't true it's\njust that\nyou know john you got rid of it yep\nright it's not just\nbeast it's obese two beasts\nyeah right it's like\ntriumph over adversity which means that\nthere was adversity\ni started crying i\ni took that one for the team thanks i\nappreciate it yeah\nis it is it cool if i go to the bathroom\nreal quick yeah absolutely i mean go for\nit okay\nall right i'll be right back i'm sorry\nyeah so\nyou know john it actually feels to me\nlike we've kind of covered a fair amount\nof ground and\nand um you know if you have questions\nand stuff i'd love\nto answer them if you have thoughts that\nyou want to share i'd love to listen\num we can talk a little bit about\nmeditation if you'd like but\nyou know i kind of feel like we're at a\ndecent pause or stopping point how do\nyou feel\nno yeah i think that that that sounds\ngood to me i just yeah i wanted to wait\nto go to the bathroom until there was\nlike a\nnatural break in the conversation i\ndon't want to be like all right i gotta\ngo\num so i guess like one thing that i am\njust interested this is a very\nmy own kind of personal thing so um\nrecently i've cut out\num caffeine for the most part like\nbecause i felt like it was like really\ntriggering\nuh my anxiety but i was just kind of\ncurious what you think about that is\nthat like kind of bs does that actually\nhelp people\num is that actually a useful thing\nbecause i definitely do miss caffeine\nbut\ni feel like it i do feel like it's\nhelped me but i'm just like is that\nplacebo\num you know healthy like with\nmy anxiety because like i was i was i\nfelt like i was noticing\nwhen i would um drink coffee in the\nmorning\nwas i would like feel those feelings of\nanxiety a lot and like i would have like\num those little episodes that i was\ntelling you about maybe to a lesser\ndegree\num but i was just kind of curious like\nwhat you think about that is\nactually helpful yeah so i i think that\num it certainly is helpful\nso the first thing to understand is that\nyou know human beings are different\nand so you got to experiment and kind of\nwork to figure out what works for you\nbut there are some general principles so\nif we think about caffeine caffeine is a\nstimulant right and\nanxiety is an issue of excess energy or\nlike the mind running really really fast\nwe think about if we talk to people who\nhave anxiety it's not like their mind\nruns slow it's like their mind\nis like super super fast right and so we\nthink about medications for anxiety like\nsome people find that you know marijuana\nor alcohol\nlike they self-medicate and what do\nthose substances do they slow us down\nright so they're downers um and then if\nwe think about the class of\ndrugs or chemicals that stimulate us\ncaffeine meth cocaine\nother kinds of stimulants are going to\nmake anxiety worse\nso worsening anxiety for example is a\npotential side effect\nof ritalin or adderall so any kind of\nstimulant is\ncan make caffeine worse so i don't think\nthat's just placebo or anything like\nthat um\ngenerally speaking you know those uh\ncaffeine is gonna like\nincrease the activity of our neurons and\nmake them kind of jittery and make\nyou know thoughts increase in rapidity\nand if we just think about it i think a\nlot of stuff in our body and our mind\nare two-way streets\nso if we speed up our mind we're more\nlikely to be anxious\nand the more anxious we are the quicker\nour mind goes\nand if you think about you know what do\npeople want to do with anxiety they just\nwant their mind to slow down they want\nlike everything to slow down\ni would bet money that when you had the\npanic attack\num your mind was like firing thoughts at\nyou like\na thousand thoughts a second you know\nand it's just like oh my god this and\nthen this and then this and then this\nand then this\nand so caffeine puts your mind\ninto a state where it is more vulnerable\nto that kind of thing\nyou're kind of priming it for rapid\nthoughts\nand so anxiety kind of really grows in\nthat sort of soil\num so i think it's it's good that you\ncut caffeine out\nyeah it can definitely help yeah my\nmy like whole plan i was thinking about\neventually if i do\nintroduce it again it would be like\nbefore i like only before workouts\nbecause i i've always felt like if i\nhave like a like\nthe caffeine is going to something right\nlike i'm going to do a workout so like\nmy brain is focused on that\nthen it would maybe help i'm still not\nexactly sure how i'm going to implement\nthat but like those are\ni don't know i just i just wanted to ask\nyou about that because i figured you\nprobably had some insight\nabsolutely so i mean some people do take\ncaffeine as a like a pre-workout\nsupplement right so people will even\ntake like caffeine pills and stuff to\nimprove their workouts um you know i\nthink it sort of makes sense but i think\ngenerally speaking you know the more\nthe fewer mind-altering substances you\nhave floating around in your system the\nmore tranquil your mind is going to be\nand caffeine is i mean yeah\nyeah other questions um well the last\nthing i just kind of wanted to talk\nabout i know this is a big subject but i\njust i don't want to take up too much\ntime\num but like with the the thought of\nlike okay because i mean i deal with\nthis so much of people asking me this\nquestion\num or like thinking this way is like\nokay i am overweight\nand i'm unhappy about being overweight\nso i feel like if i lose the weight\nthen i will be happy right like i guess\ni'm just asking have you\ndealt with that and like what would you\n[Music]\nmaybe like say to someone that might\nhave that like mindset that would be\ncoming to you and asking you about that\nit's a great question so that is a very\ncomplex\ntopic yeah that ultimately has to do\nwith the nature of happiness\nokay um so we can go into that just very\nquickly but\nso the a couple of things the first\nthing is that it makes sense sometimes\nfor people to feel\nhappier once they lose weight right it's\nnot\nif you take a thousand people who are\noverweight and then they all\nlose weight on the whole the\nthe people that lose weight are more\nlikely to be more happy\nright so so they're the first thing to\nacknowledge is that in a lot of cases\nlosing weight does lead people to feel\nhappier and there are physiologic\nreasons for that and stuff like that you\nknow you just have more energy\nit's not so much about the weight loss\nit's about the exercise and the positive\neffects of exercise\nyour basic metabolic rate can go up\nthings like that you feel\nless thompson which is another kind of\nthing\nwhich i won't go into but for those of\nyou who are familiar with that\nso the first thing is that sometimes\nthey feel happy\nthe second thing is that sometimes\nhappiness isn't necessarily due to\nweight right happiness\nis like a self-esteem issue or\nyou know feeling like you don't deserve\nlove or attention or things like that\nwhich gets tangled up with the weight\nand and we know that because you even\nsaid that like you know when i'm feeling\ndown and my sister is mean to me\ni go and i find comfort in nachos yeah\nand that also is like not stupid or\nanything that's because we actually\nhave you know chemicals in our brain\nthat are released from fatty foods and\nsugary foods\nthat will actually improve our mood in\nthe short term\nand so people can start to feel happier\nthrough food\nbut what they're doing is they're using\nfood as like kind of an antidote to a\ndeeper set problem\nand then they start to gain weight their\nweight gain preys on their pre-existing\ninsecurities\nand for those people who feel like if i\nchange my weight my\ni'll be happy and everything will be\ngreat that's not gonna work right\nbecause it's like the pre-existing\ninsecurity and you're actually\na wonderful example of that john because\nin a lot of ways you have an\nawesome life that you really enjoy\nliving and that you're grateful for\nand you have stuff that lingers that is\nindependent of your weight\nthat's the second thing i would tell\nthem so where is the root\nof your unhappiness and i think a lot of\ntimes what happens\nand the third thing which is really the\nlonger discussion which i'm working on\nactually a set of videos about this\nis like where does happiness come from\nright because a lot of times what\nhappens is people\nlook at being unhappy and what they do\nis they look at some external thing or\neven and i even consider to a certain\ndegree\nyour body to be an external thing if i\nchange this\nabout my life then i will be happy\nand so it's like if i had a girlfriend\ni'd be happy if i lost weight i'd be\nhappy\nif i graduated from college i'd be happy\nif i was in college i'd be happy i\nwouldn't have to feel ashamed about\nmyself\nif this thing in the outside world was\ndifferent\nand i've worked with some very very\nsuccessful people who are very very\nunhappy\nand what they find is that they chase\none thing and then they chase the next\nthing\nthey chase the next thing and they chase\nthe next thing we did an interview a\ncouple weeks back with gross gore where\nwe sort of talk about that because\nhe was someone who was really like yeah\ni want the next thing and that's how i'm\ngoing to be happy\nso then let me ask you something\nif i eat a cookie and i feel happy where\ndoes the happiness come from does it\ncome from the cookie or does it come\nfrom me\nyeah i would say it comes from you but\nthe cookie is what made me happy\nright why do you say it comes from you\nuh well because like i guess it's like\nyou you chose to eat the cookie and you\nlike it's your choice to to do that and\nthen\nso you fulfilled something that you were\nlike trying to to do i guess\nsure so the fulfillment of my desire is\nwhat makes me happy\nyeah yeah yeah right i guess that's the\nsame thing as the cookie\nno no so i think you're right the\nhappiness does come from me i'm just\nchallenging it a little bit so if we\nlike think about it like\nit's this idea that like you know if\nsomething\nelse like if i get this thing then i'm\ngonna be happy that that\nfulfilling my desires is what makes me\nhappy that's what you're saying\nand that sort of makes sense because we\nthink about it like if i ate one cookie\nand then i eat a second cookie and a\nthird cookie and a fourth cookie and a\nfifth cookie\nwhat happens to my happiness with\nsubsequent cookies\ni i personally would say it probably\nwould go down yeah right\nbecause too many cookies right exactly\nso so therefore we can say that like\nif the happiness really came from the\noutside thing then the more of the\noutside thing we get the more happy we'd\nbe\nand this is what happens with people who\nchase money right they're like i want a\nthousand dollars i want ten thousand\ndollars\n100 000 i want a million dollars i want\ntwo million three million four million\nfive million they just want more\nmore and more because they think that\nthat money is going to bring them\nhappiness\nbut it doesn't the happiness actually\ncomes from in here\nif you really tunnel down and you look\nat it and then you also say that the\nfulfillment of\ndesires is what brings you happiness but\nyou know i think the tricky part with\nthat is if i eat a cookie and i feel\nsated\nwhat happens the next day you want to\nhave another cookie\nabsolutely yeah right so fulfilling your\ndesires actually just\nbuys you more unfulfilled desires in the\nfuture\nwhich is what we see right so then they\nlose weight and then they're like i'm\nstill not happy\nyeah now i want this now i want this now\ni want this\nand so chasing after your desires even\nthough it brings us a temporary\nsatisfaction\nactually signs us up to become more\ndependent\non fulfilling our desires to make\nourselves feel better\nand it's a beast that never grows full\nit'll always be hungry again\nthe next day and so what would i say to\nthese people probably some combination\nof all of that\nthat on the one hand if we really look\nat it scientifically improving your\nweight is probably going to lead to an\nincrease in mood\nbut that if you have some psychological\nlike unfulfilled need\nor slow self-esteem that you equate to\nweight\nfixing your weight won't be enough it'll\nhelp but it won't be enough\nyeah and that ultimately if you really\nwant to be happy in life you have to\nreally understand that changing anything\nabout your external circumstances is not\ngoing to be the real answer\nand that it really has to do with like\naccepting yourself as who you are\nletting go of desire and things like\nthat\num yeah does that make sense for sure\ncomplete and i usually like yeah go\nahead yeah usually what i try and tell\ntell\npeople is like you can't think of it as\nlike a magic bullet or like a silver\nbullet\nor something that's gonna fix everything\nlike there are certain things that yes\nlike if you're\nreally upset that you can't bend down\nand put your shoes on then yeah losing\nweight will obviously fix that thing\nwhich might make you a little bit happy\nabout that but if it's like you're start\nlike with me like struggle with anxiety\nor whatever\nit's like it's not going it's just not\ngoing to fix that that thing\nyeah so okay all right yeah\nyeah cool any other questions or great\nquestions man\nno i think that's about it i mean i\nagain like i said i appreciate you\ntaking the time to to talk this was\num very insightful um i wanted to say\nfun but i feel like that's not that but\ni genuinely did enjoy the conversation\nyeah but\nit was uh it was very insightful and\ninteresting\nyeah uh john i just want to echo again i\ni think um\nyou know you are a really insightful\nperson i think we\ni i got to teach a little bit more\nbecause i think you had gone\nhalfway there on your own so a lot of\ntimes i have to like get\npeople to kind of where you started off\num\nand and so i really enjoyed that i hope\ni didn't monopolize the conversation too\nmuch\nbut no no i i mean what i wanted to say\nis i think a lot of like\nnot to like try and like sing your\npraises too much but like i think a lot\nof it was has been from watching your\nvideos and like\nbecause like a lot of times i'll watch\nthem or watch them but i'll listen to\nthem as i'm like on a walk or something\nand i try and put myself in the position\nas much as i can\num and so i would i would say that's\nprobably why maybe i was able to\nlike you said be halfway there because i\ni really try to like\nokay how does this make me feel like you\nknow so um\nyou probably you weren't even you\nweren't even doing you you you weren't\neven talking to me but you were helping\nme at the same time which i know is like\nexactly why you do this stuff so yeah\nthat's really cool i think i'm really\nactually happy to hear that john because\ni hope more people do what you do\nbecause\ni think part of what i'm excited about\nis teaching people like step two\nright and i i don't give people much\nadvice because most people are still in\nthe diagnosis phase where they need to\nfigure out what's going on\ni think you've done such a good job of\nsort of starting that process that it's\nlike really like\ncall your mom and see what happens right\ntalk to her there are a lot of subtle\nthings because you really have grown\nit's like\nthe higher you climb you know the\nthinner the air gets and the harder it\nis to keep climbing\nand and that's what's really tricky um\nand john uh\nuh the last thing that i want to say is\ndamn sound like you are really an\noutlier when it comes to the hand that\nyou were dealt\nand yeah and how far you've come yeah\nthank you i\nit's something that i've um it's weird\nbecause like i said the thing i struggle\nwith is feeling like i'm not special and\nstuff but it's something that i've\nreally been like\num i've started to notice more and more\num and so i try not to uh make it seem\nlike what i've done is like the easy\nthing that anyone can do it like i try\nwhen i say that like i try and put\nmyself in the position of someone that\nmight not be able to do that\nand like how do i help that person right\num but yeah thank you i\nappreciate that um do you meditate\nuh i can't say that i do okay that's\ntotally cool man i mean don't do do you\nfeel judged when you have to say no to\nthat question\num no i just uh i i've watched a lot of\nyour videos and i know that you a lot of\ntimes will do guided meditations\num and so i guess i feel like man maybe\ni should be\nso so be careful right so don't judge\nyourself so now this is going to be\nreally really hard\nokay so be really really really careful\nokay john this is the final exam\nso i'm gonna ask you if you want me to\nteach you some meditation\nand i want you to answer with not what\nyou should say\nbut what you actually feel yeah\ni think i would i would like to learn\nsome stuff for sure okay cool\nso i'm going to teach you some super\nbasic stuff okay i try to teach this\nperiodically have you have you done\nalternate nostril breathing with us\nbefore\nyes i did uh i think it was\nit was one of the videos i remember i i\ndid as much as i could because again i\nwas on a walk so i was like that's\ntotally cool\nso let's let's do it now okay so i try\nto teach this periodically but i think\nit's just a great place to\num so alternate nostril breathing is\ngonna be\ngood when you're in those dark moments\nwhere you're losing control of yourself\nif you do even nine breaths of alternate\nnostril breathing not to say that it's\ngoing to be the magic bullet\nand wipe it all away but i think you're\ngoing to be able to take a little bit\nmore control\nokay so alternate nostril breathing is a\nshould be\ntechnique should be means cleansing and\ni think john what you need to do more\nthan anything\nelse is like clean this crap out because\nyou're killing it\nin so many different ways that you just\nyour you've got your trash can is filled\nup\nin your subconscious you just clean it\nout so\nwhat i'm going to ask you to do is take\nyour right hand and\nand fold down two fingers yeah that's\nfine too\nyeah good yeah um so and then we're\ngonna put our right thumb\non our right nostril and breathe in\nand when your breath is full we're going\nto block the other nostril\ngood with your pinky good and breathe\nout\nand breathe in through the same nostril\nswitch and breathe out\nin through the same nostril\nswitch and out\nif you're watching at home go ahead and\njoin in breathe in\nswitch breathe out\nin\nswitch out\ngo ahead and continue at your own pace\nremember to breathe out then in\nthen switch and people may find that one\nnostril is more closed than the other\nthat's completely normal\nit's just part of your swara\nwe'll practice for about 60 more seconds\ngo ahead and finish the breath that\nyou're on let your eyes remain closed\nand just relax\nforeign\ni want you to just take a snapshot of\nwho you are in this moment\njust feel the perfection\nof your being\nit's not big it's not small it's not\nbrilliant it's not stupid it's just you\nand remember that no matter how you feel\nor what echoes may arise from your\nsubconscious\nthis is who you are\nand when you're ready come on back\nmy camera seems to have uh meditated as\nwell\nyes this is actually kind of creepy bro\nit's very weird\none second\nlike chat this is creepy right\nthere we go i was very strange i've\nnever i've never had that happen before\nyeah i swear sometimes weird stuff\nhappens on this like i\nlike don't know\nyou know i don't know anyway you seem to\nbe back now\nyou feel like you're back yeah i don't\nknow that was\nit's that's literally never happened\nthis so i'll have it on for hours\ni i really don't know what to say man\ni've never i've i've never heard of yeah\nit's just it's just like too [ __ ]\nweird of a coincidence\nright right it really is yeah but like\nhow on earth there's no scientific\nplausibility for\nanything that has to do with anything\nabout what just happened there's just\nnothing it's just all just completely\n[ __ ]\ni was i was very confused i like opened\nmy eyes\nlike how did he did he turn off my\ncamera to make it more i was very i was\nlike wait how is it off i don't know\nit's so weird anyway so i think we found\na good technique for your camera\nso stick with it\nand listen john i mean i i hope the\ntechnique helped you calm yourself a\nlittle bit or you know you felt some\ndegree of\ntranquility or peace no for sure i think\nlike\ni've heard you explain it like the fact\nthat you have to kind of focus on the\nwhat you're doing it definitely helps me\nbecause i mean\nmy mind is always going so the fact that\ni have to okay breathe in and breathe\nout okay\nyou know what i mean it helps me kind of\nnot worry about like the noises i'm\nhearing in the background or whatever so\ngreat and um john before we wrap up i\nknow\nlike people will kind of trickle in do\nyou just want to tell us a little bit\nabout who you are and where we can find\nmore information about you\nyeah so my name is john or obesity beast\num i talk about you
