    "transcript": "if you don't accept yourself as a trans\nwoman\nyou are placing a value on cis women\nover trans women\noh 100 yeah right and so that's i think\nthe basic problem is that like you are\nvaluing something above yourself that\nyou will never be\nyeah so welcome and you go by natalie is\nthat right\nnatalie yeah okay so i'm all oak or dr k\nthank you very much for coming today um\nnice to meet you\ni really love your so let's start sorry\ni'm just\nfixing my camera which is why\nso uh do you want to just start because\ni i know you're predominantly on youtube\nor exclusively on youtube\ndo you want to just tell us a little bit\nabout who you are natalie and and what\nkind of work you do\nuh sure yeah my name is natalie wynn\ni am the creator of the youtube channel\ncontra points\nand that is a channel i've been doing\nfor about four years\nit's changed a lot over the time i've\nbeen doing it\nand it is i would say\nit's about politics but it's also\ni guess more generally about internet\nculture\nit's more about the internet culture\nside of politics\nso when i started on youtube i was kind\nof\nwell there's a lot of creators who are\ndoing what was called like\nanti-sjw content uh\nanti-social justice warrior content\nranting about these crazy blue haired\nstudent activists who are destroying\nwestern civilization\nand a lot of my early content was aimed\nat trying to like\nintroduce a more measured discourse\naround like\nsocial justice issues progressive issues\nbecause i felt that youtube was a\nvery very right wing\nthings that the world has changed a lot\nin four years the internet's changed a\nlot youtube's changed a lot and i have\nchanged a lot\num i am in a different way\nit's a whole different website a whole\ndifferent world now um\nyou know i'm now just one among a sea\nof people who's doing sort of what they\ncall a left\nto the content now and i also\nhave uh you know changed\ngenders in that time because i started\nuh you know when i started in 2016 i was\nhaving\nlike a kind of gender crisis um\nbut i shortly realized that i was a\ntrans woman and i've\nbeen transitioning medically and\nsocially since 2017\nand all of that's kind of factored into\nthe content that i make on youtube\ninteresting um thank you so much for\nsharing that so\nlike i think your videos are fantastic\nand i don't know if you have um\nexperience teaching\nbut like they're very well done i think\nfrom a\ninformation dissemination standpoint i\nthink you're a phenomenal teacher\nthank you i am before i did this i was a\ni was i was getting a phd in philosophy\nand dropped out but\num yeah i did teach a couple classes or\nat least take tas and classes\nthat actually makes a lot of sense now\nthat i think about it because i think\nwhat i really appreciate about your\nvideos is um you know whether you\nagree or disagree with the content\nwhatever but i think from a\ncraftsmanship standpoint they're very\nthoughtful very logical\ni think you form a really good like\nsequence of explaining context and\nbackground before\nyou know arriving at your thesis it\ndoesn't surprise me at all that you\nformally studied philosophy because i\nthink that's a\nyou know they trained you how to think\nand construct an argument more than\nanything else\num thank you yeah it turned out to be\nwell and on you like no one expects to\nget a philosophy drop outside of\nacademia but\ni found the one thing where it actually\ni'm sure it's useful for a lot of things\nbut it's pretty surprising\nactually specifically useful for this\nyeah um in\nin some fields like strategic consulting\nthey actually highly prioritize or\nhighly value philosophy degrees\nbecause training and philosophy is\nsometimes training and thinking\nyeah it teaches you a certain approach\nto to things like\nthe ability to sort of understand a\nperspective that you disagree with\nor to like build up arguments for an\nargument that you disagree with\nand then like sort of counter it it's a\nkind of like i guess i call it like\nintellectual empathy where you\nunderstand like why you try to\nunderstand\nwhat exactly someone else thinks and why\nthey think it\nthat's maybe the more psychological side\nis why i was going to say that sounds\nlike my job\nyeah yes that's definitely\ndefinitely more in psychology so natalie\ni don't know how familiar you are with\nhealthy gamer but if i can just orient\nyou to how we do interviews\num so you know we usually don't we'll\nhave guests who\nmay be like you know prominent in a\nparticular field but\nwe don't really talk about\nthe work that they do so it's not like\nyou know we're really here to learn\nabout\npeople yeah sure and and i think so\noften times i'll i'll ask questions that\nare like personal so like i want to know\nabout you as a person in your journey\nas opposed to any particular political\nviews that you may believe in or\nwhatever\nyeah yeah and you know if if a political\nview that you\nhave relates to something personal in\nyour life i think that's actually like\ntotally cool um but generally speaking\nyou know we we talk about people and i\nthink a lot of\nwhat uh our viewers really appreciate is\num seeing themselves in the person that\nthey're talking to so the the\ndiscussions tend to be a little bit more\npersonal\nsure that being said you know if there\nis anything that\num you're welcome to draw whatever\nboundaries you want around the\ndiscussion\ni'm not here to try to expose anything\nor anything like that\num you know like if there's something\nthat you feel uncomfortable with\nyou're welcome to say hey i just don't\nwant to answer that um\nand then if i notice you're getting\nuncomfortable i may actually point it\nout to you\nand then ask for permission to proceed\nokay sounds good\ni mean i'm a habitual divulger of\ninformation about myself\nso that's probably going to work out\nfine what does that mean a habitual\ndivulger of information about you well i\ni it means i enjoy the confession\nthe confessional format i i mean\nevery once every every couple you know\ntwice a year maybe i make a video that's\nreally more about me than about anything\nelse\nwhat do you enjoy about divulging\ninformation about yourself\nwell i i suppose i'm interested in\nmyself\nbecause i around to this person all the\ntime and sometimes i\nform opinions i i guess i i don't know\nit's\nit feels there's also maybe a kind of\nthere's probably some kind of\ntherapeutic thing for me it feels good\nto sort of\nspeak your truth as it were i don't know\ni i cannot it can also be sort of i\nthink it can be unhealthy just\nsometimes when you're kind i don't know\nif\nfor instance i find it easier sometimes\nto talk to a million people than to talk\nto one person\nin that i think especially online\nthere's a kind of when you're producing\nyou know i'm sure people can relate to\nthis when you're posting anything on\nsocial media\nthere's a kind of illusion of of\nsolitude\nthat comes from being alone at your\ncomputer\num i often are you know alone in front\nof the camera\nwhich is often how i'm filming right and\nhow i'm writing\nand so i've i'm sort of gotten over this\ni'm\nbecoming more a professional but there\nused to be a time when i would um\nyou know the first time that i would see\nthe video i had just spent 100 hours\nmaking in the youtube player itself\ni would have this moment of panic like\noh god like other people can actually\nsee this\nlike this is not just my private video\ndiary that i've been working\non um but i don't know i guess it feels\ngood to sort of like share what you're\ngoing through and oftentimes\nyou know a bunch of other people will\nfind\nsomething relevant to themselves about\nwhat you've shared\nand so that to me is very um\n[Music]\nwell it often it makes you feel less\nalone you know when you hear that other\npeople have been through\nsomething similar and that's actually\nexactly what we're about we're about\nyou know i think a lot of the it's the\nreason i started streaming was because\nwhat i noticed is i was having the same\nconversations like over and over and\nover again\nand everyone thought that they were\nalone with their struggles\nyeah and what it turns out is that\neveryone is struggling with the same\nstuff it's just\nthat's not what we advertise right we we\nput on a mask and we show people\nsomething else\nand so everyone else gets the impression\nthat the world is like a lot of people\nwho are doing fantastic\nwhereas all of us are struggling yeah\nand so well i think there's a using a\nleap of faith almost that happens\nwhen you put out something very personal\nbecause\nyou're you know maybe everyone thinks\nyou're crazy\num or maybe and this is a leap of faith\nthe fact that you're going through\nsomething in private that's not often\ndiscussed\nit's going to turn it's going to turn\nout that you know 10 000 other people\nare going through that same thing\nand they all connect with you so so\nyou're sort of hoping\nor even if they're not going through\nexactly what you're going through\nit relates in some way to their own\nexperience and so you're hoping they\nconnect on on some level\nyeah so can you share with us is there\nhas there been a particular leap of\nfaith that you've taken that's\nsurprised you in terms of how people\nresponded to it\nlet's see uh yeah there's been a few\num trying to think of a\nlike the best example well i\ndid a video a long time ago on\nin cells the insult movement and\ni kind of in the last part of that video\nrelated because that you know i spent a\nlot of time on insult forms like\nwhen i part of what i do when i cover a\num\nlike an intern you know some facet of\ninternet culture\nbecause i would go into the forums and\ni'll like sort of spend time\nlearning the vocabulary and learning\nlike what are the concerns how\nyou know what are the what are the usual\nobjections that people give\nto you know to insults that they've\nheard a hundred times and are just\nalready don't want to hear um you know\nand so i guess what i found is that like\nthere's something kind of profoundly\ni guess relatable to me about\nthat like obsessive like self abuse\nthat a lot of like in cells have right\nthis kind of putting themselves down all\nthe time and\nto the point of like physiologically\nlike anatomically analyzing their\ndefects in great detail\nand that it reminded me i guess of um\na lot of like the uglier trans faces\nonline\nwhich in a different you know this kind\nof different context\ninvolve exactly the same thing which is\nlike a kind of\nan obsessively negative self-harming\nlike analysis of your own anatomy\nright uh the black pill\nright the the that's what cells call it\nthe idea that\nyou know because of their you know\ninferior bone structure\nthat they are doomed by nature to have\na lonely life but yeah\nyeah and and so you said that that you\nsaid it sort of resonated with you on\non some level or it was it did yeah yeah\ni found something familiar about it um\nyou know write down it's through some\nweird weirdly specific parallels are you\nconcerned about the shapes of facial\nbones\nand can you do you mind if i ask you a\nlittle bit more like personally about\nwhat it was that resonated with you or\nwhat kinds of thoughts that you've had\nabout yourself i'm assuming you're\nthinking about yourself\nabsolutely i mean at the time i was\nactually considering\ngoing through like a major facial\nsurgery\num to change my appearance which i ended\nup doing\num but it's it's funnily enough it's\nactually\na frequent topic on insult forms too\nwhere they'll talk about\nbasically doing all the opposite things\nof what i did you know\naugmenting the jaw and to get a stronger\nmore masculine look\nand uh you know strengthening the brow\nbone and\ndoing all these things that give them\nthat like chiseled\nchadley appearance and and so what is it\nthat\nhow does changing your physical\nappearance\nhow does that relate to the way that you\nperceive or feel or talk\ntalk to yourself like how do you like\nyou know what\nwhat help what motivates you to do that\nand what does it mean to you to do that\nwell i think it's something that most\npeople do to some extent\nlike i think everyone has everyone with\na mirror\nhas some kind of thing about themselves\nthey don't like\ni think that when you're trans like i am\nlike there's an additional layer of it\nwhereas i mean you like\ni went through a period where like i\nmean i was presenting\nappearing to the world as a as a man and\nthat's how like there's a very that's a\nvery\ndrastic sense of what i'm saying in the\nmirror\nis wrong um and i think that\nyou know i think that's not as you know\nit's a complicated question isn't it\nlike how much\nof that dysphoria gender dysphoria\nhow much of that is just what it means\nto be trans as part of who we are has to\nbe respected\nand how much of it is a kind of\nnegative like internalized hatred\nbecause society views trans people with\na very cruel gaze\nand sometimes it's not clear like what\nis gender dysphoria\nand what is just me internalizing this\nkind of\nugly way that people have looking at\ntrans people\nso natalie do you mind if i ask you some\nquestions about like\nwhat your sense of like kind of where\nyou grew\nup i mean not so much in terms of\ndetails about where but like what\nyour upbringing was like and and how you\nlearned that you were trans\nyeah i can talk about that a little bit\ni mean\ni had um i guess it was such as an early\nin my early childhood i had a pretty\na pretty normal boyhood in a way like\nit's actually i don't think\nlike pre-12 years old i actually look\nback on that time\nmostly with with positivity i think that\nyou know\ni i was sort of neither the most\ni was certainly not the most masculine\nboy but i was not like\ni wasn't feminine to the point where it\nwas a major problem\num but when i was a teenager i guess\ni sort of began there was this like\ndiscontent\nbeginning to stir the senses something\nwas wrong\num in my 20s it just got worse\nand worse can you explain that feeling\num like how would it make\ni'm just imagining that there's like\nsomeone who's 19 who's watching right\nnow\nand how would they know you know\nyeah how would you know you're trans\nthat's the question i get a lot\num well it gets a lot of trans people\nwill tell you that it's it's easy like\noh if you're even questioning at all\nthat means you're trans i don't agree\nwith that\ni think that a lot of people question\ntheir gender for a lot of\nreasons um and i think\nthat you know whether you're raised as a\nboy or as a girl like there's a lot of\nlike gendered expectations\nput on to you there's a lot of um you\nknow\nthere's a kind of image of you know what\nwhat you're supposed to be doing a\nscript\nthat you're supposed to be following and\nit's it's everyone to some extent i\nthink\nquestions that a little bit about\nthemselves like i think this\nthat may be especially true of of women\npeople who are raised girls like\nthat's a very constrict well well it's\ni think it's true with men in a\ndifferent way but it's um\nyou know that there's often times like\ngoing to be\nsituations where you know even if you\nare\njust a you know a regular cis woman like\nyou're going to think like\nthis sucks i don't like being treated\nlike a woman because it sucks\nright right and there's times when you\nknow when it sucks to be a man\nlike it's absolutely it does um but so\nto me it's a question of\nfiguring out like not just whether\nyou're responding to those things but\nin my case it's more a question of you\nknow\ni just don't i feel like socially\ni sort of fit a script for women better\nand physically i'm so i have this kind\nof\nthis sense of alienation from my body\nthat is making it hard for me\nto like it's it's\nyou i feel i felt sort of feel like i\nhad to be detached from my body or go\noutside of my body\ni didn't feel sort of physically\nconnected to the world\nand i you know people who are\ntrans women who are sort of not aware\nthat they're trans yet tend to do a lot\nof\nthings that they can't quite explain to\nthemselves like like\nan atypical forum for man amount of body\nshaping\nand uh or that kind of thing just kind\nof trying to have a more androgynous\nlook i guess was something that i'd been\ndoing for a long time\nand then you know i i would kind of like\nas a joke you know it's halloween\nwell what if i would have fighted it was\na girl\nwasn't that funny\nyou know and that kind of thing and at\nsome point you know\nyou you realize that like it took me a\nlong time honestly\nthere was a lot of denial and excuse\nmaking\nbut i think you know youtube in some\nways helped me\nhelp me figure it out as i was kind of\npresenting\num you know at the time i was it was\nplayed off as like\na bit where i was like going to be the\na degenerate cross-dresser that was just\nthe idea\nthe stick but so it looks like you used\na lot of humor\nand yeah which is um\nit's kind of what you because you i was\nsort of aware that like\nyou know like i knew that i didn't look\nlike a woman like i i looked like a man\nin a dress and people think\nthat's the thing that people find funny\nso i guess\nmy way of coping with that was to be\nlike well i guess it is kind of funny\nlet's make it funny and so i did that\nbut at some point i kind of realized\nlike this is actually is not funny to me\nit's like like this is what i want to be\nand\ni don't want you know i actually\ni i feel like i'd rather live as a woman\num and that you know when i when i\nrealized that there was a kind of period\nwhere i was going back and forth in the\nmeaning now that's because insanity\ndon't do that\nand then times when i was being like\nokay but it's what i want\nand you know through through\nthe warriors through stages like for a\nwhile i just identified as a\ngender queer meaning that i sort of\nidentify with neither gender\ni thought of myself as just like an\nandrogynous person\nand so i would wear you know i was i was\nlike freaking biggie was looking like\ni'd be wearing\nnail polish and lipstick but like still\nbeing\nlike socially like being a man i guess\nuh\nusing a male name and things but just\nbeing a sort of\nuh i don't know flamboyant or um\nhow what is the word i'm looking for\nlike uh adorned man\nbut i guess um you know i just\nat a certain point i realized that i\nwanted to there was like a medical\ncomponent to this\nyou know i thought that i was uh well i\nfelt that like\nthere was a problem not just it's a\ncertain point it's not just about oh\ni painted my nails so lots of men paint\ntheir nails that's fine\nright i wore a dress well men wear\ndresses all the time\nlike but at a certain point i was like\nbut like this is like\nthis is not what i want to be i don't\nwant to be a man on a dress i'm like\ni think i'm supposed to be a woman and\nuh that then you know i i it was always\nit was\nall very gradual i kind of stumbled into\nit like something i don't know the\ndifferent trans people have different\nstories\nsome trans people that they know from\nthe age of three they just have this\nstrong inner conviction their different\ngender\nthat's not really my story to me it was\nit was more just like a series of the\ngender problems and gender confusion\nthat just kind of settled on this\nnatalie how\nhow has your internal experience or\nhow have your feelings changed or your\nthoughts changed\nas you've walked along that journey so\ni'm imagining\ni'm trying to envision like when you\nwere 16 years old and you looked in the\nmirror like\nhow did you feel about yourself and what\ndid you think about yourself\num well i think when i was very young\nlike that\ni kind of like found a way of expressing\nthese feelings through like\njust being a pretty boy you know and\nlike i was like well that's fine like\nthat's kind of me\nyou know um but i guess that's really\nhard i think one thing that happened is\nwhen i got a bit older like\nthat occupying like that kind of role\nyou know\nat some point like can you be a 40 year\nold pretty boy like\ni don't know maybe maybe you can like\ni'm sure i'm sure that there's there's\nthere's\nhollywood actors and stuff out there who\ni would describe that way\nbut i i guess i kind of realized like\nyou know being a boy was okay\nbut being a man wasn't if that makes\nsense\nsure yeah i mean i think you know\nboys and girls and men and women i think\nthere's more\num you know androgyny between boys and\ngirls\nexactly exactly and so i that's kind of\nhow i see myself like\nas i can perceive myself kind of\nbecoming a man\nthat really like triggered the sense of\ndread\nand feeling of wrongness like no like\ni'm not supposed to be that\num and so i think that\ni also around this time like you know i\nwas not raised with\na knowledge of trans people not in any\ndetail\num certainly not in a very positive um\nyou know what have you dread about being\na man i guess i sort of\nfelt like\ni felt that it wasn't an expression of\nmyself\nand that's if you're i know that's\nthat's kind of fake that i feel like i'm\nnot\nmaking it clear it's the kind of feeling\nthat's hard to put into words\nit's like i just i would just\nlook at women and see like nothing like\nthat's what i should be doing\nyou know like i i sort of it's a matter\nof um\nat a certain point kind of like\nidentification like i think that\nmost people get their idea of what it\nmeans to be a man or what it means to be\na woman\nfrom other men and women like you sort\nof form\nrole models i guess you have like sort\nof\na verb i mean trans people and and cis\npeople are\nare similar in a lot of ways like like\nwe all\nyou know have some way a version of our\ngender that's like\nwe feel like that's us you know and\nobviously there's a lot of different\nways of being a man there's a lot of\ndifferent ways of being a woman\nbut um i guess\nyou know and i think when you're an\nadolescent especially you're kind of\nexperimenting with different options\nlike you might sort of try to be six\ndifferent people\nbetween ages 13 and 18. that's pretty\ncommon\nbut um like what happens when you start\nadmiring\nthe you start seeing yourself in women\nand not in men that's a great way to put\nit yeah\num so i i guess what you identify with\nor what you\nstrive to be or the kinds of role models\nyou have\nhappen to be not from your gender\nyeah yeah it reminds me of you know\npeople say\num when i was in med school and trying\nto figure out what i wanted to do\nwhat people told me was like you know\ndon't worry about the field\nlike think about the kinds of doctors\nthat feel like role models to you\nyeah yeah you know and and so i'm kind\nof curious\nyou know going through surgery um\ni'm trying to find the right word for it\ni i feel like drastic\nis a little bit judgmental so i'm trying\nto steer clear of that word but\num you know\nlet's put it this way it's it's a big\nstep right so basically\nyeah like drastic is not entirely wrong\ni i know i have like a little bit of a\nnegative connotation you take things too\nfar\nbut i it is um it's a significant\ndecision to make um especially like you\nknow the\nthe main surgery i've had is facial\nfeminization\nwhich is a terrifying surgery like\nyou're changing your face\nwhich is a very personal um thing you\nknow\num i think and there was a lot of fear\nabout that going into it i thought like\nam i am i gonna lose myself like am i\ngonna not\nlook like me anymore um and what\nhappened\nwell as it turns out i i basically just\nlove it\nlike i look more like myself now than i\ndid before interesting\nin my case it was it was the right\ndecision\num i i but it's uh\nit's certainly not something to do\nlightly i think it's\nuh you should it's good to spend a few\nyears honestly thinking about it before\nyou're doing it\nbecause it's uh yeah it's an ordeal it's\nan ordeal to go through it's a lot of\npain and difficulty and expense\nto put yourself through um but i think\nlike to me i mean especially as someone\nwho's on camera all the time\nlike it really was a preoccupation that\ni had this like\nyou know especially once i knew that\nknew that was possible i was like i want\nthis is something i need for myself\nyeah so let me ask you something so i\nyou know i probably am a little bit\ndisrespectful towards in cells more so\nthan i\ni should be um and but i i sometimes\nkind of struggle a little bit with like\nthat balance of changing yourself\nbecause\nthere's a part of me and i think this\nlike sort of doesn't internally make\nsense to me there's a part of me that\nsays that\nyou know it's completely fine if you\nwant to change your body but\nsomething within me recoils from the\nidea if i was talking to an incel\nand they said you know i want a more\nmasculine jawline\nor i want this kind of facial surgery to\nmake me look more chad-like\nand i'm really not trying to make fun of\nthem now sometimes i do that i probably\nshouldn't\nit's hard not to because they do say\nsome ridiculous things but\nthere are very misogynistic things and\nand so\ni'm just trying to understand like you\nknow\nis that the same or is that different\ni think it's a complicated question like\nuh\nyou know there's there's in cells who\nare talking about plastic surgery who\nare fixated on plastic surgery\nwithin feminism there's discourse about\nlike\nis this just women trying to meet like\noftentimes like racist and patriarchal\nexpectations about\nfemale beauty i'm instead of just\nlearning to love themselves as they are\num\nso i would say like would you know i\nthink that even an in-seller\nor you know cis woman like has a\nright has a right to get plastic surgery\nas well of course i think that these\ndesire comes up from a different place\nthough\nin a different um there's a different\nkind of justification for it\nlike i think what like i think what's\nkind of like aching us out\nabout in cell plastic surgery is that\noftentimes the\nexplanations they give for why they're\ndoing it are based on things that are\nkind of false and deranged\nlike the notion that you need this\ncertain jawline for women to be\nattracted to you and that's going to fix\neverything like\nthat that doesn't make sense and it's\nprobably not true\nand it's um it just comes from a\nfundamentally misguided like\nidea of like i mean it didn't and again\ni don't want to say it's always the\nwrong thing to do\nlike maybe you have an incredibly weak\nchin and you just genuinely do look a\nlot better with a\nstronger jawline and that's going to\nmake you happy like maybe so\nmaybe so but maybe not and i've seen a\nlot of people posting on insult forms\nwhere it's like\nthere's patently nothing wrong with your\nface and\nthey and they've but they've kind of\nscapegoated\nthis they say this my physical\nappearance like that's why i'm lonely\nlike that's the problem i have with\nwomen like if i change this like\neverything's gonna be fixed and that\nis delusional thinking because i don't\nthink having a stronger jawline is going\nto suddenly make you\nyou know women magnetized i mean\nhonestly that's so my experience with\nthe insults and part of the reason that\ni make fun of in cells\nis that i find that when i talk to a\nperson\ni have trouble i've been looking for\nwhat i call a true insult\nfor a long time and and what my\nexperience has been is that any time you\ntalk to a person who identifies as an\nincel\nif you i the more i talk to them the\nmore that i get to know them\ni can't find an incel in there you know\nwhat what i see is just relatively\nregular\nlevel of insecurity or you know concern\nabout their appearance or things like\nthat\num but it's you know it's interesting i\ni just wonder a little bit about\nsome of these because you're sort of\nmentioning like feminist\ncommunities that sort of talk about a\nparticular body type that\nis essentially the result of the\npatriarchy and i'm wondering actually if\nthe converse is true and that's what the\nincels feel that there's sort of this i\nmean it sounds actually like the same\nargument where it's like there's a\nfeminine standard of beauty um yeah\nand and that people are being judged and\naligning towards that and i never\nthought that feminists and in cells\nwould be making the same argument\nbut yeah this is the sparkly uh well i\nthink uh\ni i think that i guess in cells 10 when\nwe talk about surgery they tend not to\nbe super critical of it\nlike they feel that there's this male\nstandard of beauty um\nbut oftentimes instead of attributing\nthat to say like patriarchy\nthis like social circumstance that could\nbe changed\nthey attribute it to like evolution the\nnature of\nthe dating market and the nature of like\nthe you know competitive meeting and all\nthis kind of stuff\nyeah but it seemed to think the female\nbrain is just wired to like this kind\nof jaw you know whereas i think that the\nfeminist critique is more\nit is the idea that like oh this is all\nsocially constructed\num now i think that with trans\nsurgery it's kind of\ncomplicated because there's kind of a\nlittle bit of of two different things\ngoing on\none is like gender dysphoria there's a\nperson's individual internal sense\noften totally against what a person has\nbeen raised to think they should be\nright\nlike i was raised to think i should be a\nman why am i not doing that\nlike because there's something\nindividually about me that is like\nrejected the script i was handed\num and so i think that like part of the\nreason for my wanting to have surgery\nwas really just to\nmy personal desire to see myself as i\nfeel i should be\neven against society to wanting me to\nlook like that however\nwhen you start you know i live as a\nwoman and people judge me as a woman\nand they judge my parents as they would\njudge a woman's appearance a lot of the\ntime\nwith some complicating factors because\nof the fact that people know that i'm\ntrans\num but i think that i\nit's a question i definitely struggled\nwith when i was you know preparing to\nget surgery\nit's like who am i doing this for\nexactly like am i doing this because\nthis is me is this what's going to make\nme happy like this is what i want to see\nin the mirror like this is all for me\nor am i doing it because i think it's\ngonna make me look\nmore socially acceptable and be more\ndesirable to other people\nmore um easily able to assimilate\nand to other you know into society and\nyou yeah\nand answers both yeah it's it's\ninteresting because there's actually\ni really love that you mentioned that\nbecause it's like where does the desire\nto change come from\nyeah does it come from wanting something\nfrom other people right so if i'm let's\nsay like i want a stronger jawline to\nattract more women\nthat doesn't feel that feels to me like\nit's a desire to change yourself\nto accommodate or have something to do\nwith the outside world\nwhereas what it's all about other people\nand what they want yeah\nand what i'm hearing from you is that\nlike the fundamental difference is like\ni mean not to say that you don't want\nsomething from the outside world as well\nbut that\nthere's a difference between wanting to\nbe satisfied with the way that\nyou look for your own sake as opposed to\nwanting to look a particular way\nfor other people and to get something\nfrom other people\nabsolutely like i think that for insults\nthis is all\nthey don't particularly seem to care\nabout looking in the mirror and seeing\nthis\nwhatever they're flawed a jaw or\nwhatever it is except that they think\nthat\nthis is holding them back socially or\nsexually\nand like if they could just fix this\npart of their anatomy\nthen you know this would be a means to\nthe end of attracting women\nand so natalie as you transitioned um\nhow were you\njudged what's that been like for you\num well it's not easy to\nespecially online like people view i\nmean people online are just who are just\nhorrible in general\nare pretty horrible in general they can\nbe anyway they can also be amazing but\nbut there's a lot of like judgment and\nnegative judgment i think\nwomen get scrutinized very very heavily\nbased on their appearance\nand then trans women in particular i\nfind attract as certain like\nlike not from everyone but there's a\nsubset of people who are sort of\nhave this cruel obsession with trans\npeople and sort of analyzing them and\ndeconstructing them\nand just picking us apart and that's\nsomething that i've experienced a lot\nand i would be lying if i had if i said\nit didn't get to me\ncan you can you tell us a little bit\nmore about that\nuh yeah well people when you know you\nwill see\nsometimes it's youtube comments\nsometimes it's you know\nthe responses to your tweets or comments\non instagram they'll have to say these\nthings for me\nit mostly isn't that it's mostly what it\ngoes on like\nin a secluded part of the internet you\nknow there used to be a\nreddit subreddit called gender critical\nwhich is which is like ostensibly like\na trans exclusionary radical feminist\nway of thinking\nbut what you're often kind of what does\nthat mean\nso there's a cut there's a there's a\nfaction of radical feminists\nwho are like vehemently opposed to trans\npeople\nbecause they view trans women they\nbasically don't\nthink that being a trans person is\nlegitimate they view trans women as\nmen who are kind of impinging on female\nspace sort of invaders\ninteresting yeah and they sound like\ngender appropriation\nyeah that's often an argument they'll\nmake and then they view transformation\nas like\nas like our lost damaged sisters who\njust are just internally misogynistic\nand trying to be men to escape\num but like oftentimes people will just\njudge other people for all kinds of\nstuff\noh yeah people but it often just devolve\ninto like simple like\nlike a roasting basically and you know\nit's not\nit's not just them it's not just these\npeople there's there's a lot of people\non the internet who\nenjoy this if you ever go to you know\n4chan god help you\nlike there's people there's parts of\nthat website where they sort of will\nobsess over trans people\nand it's like it's especially bad if\nyou're yeah\nthere's a lot of criticisms to be made\nfor 4chan but oddly enough\nand hopefully i'm not speaking out of\nturn i was really surprised recently so\ni\nyou know sometimes i work with people\nwith autism and it seems like it's\nactually a pretty supportive place it's\nit's for people with autism it's kind of\nstrange\nit's a complicated website i mean\nthere's parts of it that um\nthat are like are pretty pleasant\nthere's there's\nthere's parts of it that have even like\nkind of like\nfostered some of the good parts of the\ninternet and people will\nyou know anonymously without any\nexpectation of thanks or\nreward um like do very nice things for\neach other\ni've absolutely seen those how things\nhappen on 4chan but then it can also\ndevolve and it sort of depends on which\nyou know uh which form you're in\nbut it can develop it and just use\nincredible nastiness and cruelty\nalso yeah and i think that especially\nthat that\ntends to be within that with with trans\npeople\nso i don't know it's not it's been a\ncommon experience that i'll run across\ni've gotten better at just avoiding this\nkind of thing but you run across a forum\nwherever it is where people are just\nlike\nyou know they're posting pictures of you\nor videos of you and they're just like\ntearing you apart like your physical\nappearance\nthey're misgendering me they're either\nthey're dead naming me that's saying\nlike\nyou know oh look at his giant shoulders\nlook at his like\nlike will anyone ever believe that's a\nreal female voice like of course not\nand like like this kind of it's just uh\nit's very mean or they call you a sexual\npervert and say that you're just\nnarcissistic\nand it's uh so a lot of it\nit's very like cruel i guess and how\ndoes that\ni mean what's it like to be on\nthe receiving end of that well you feel\nlike\nlike a butterfly pinched to a board or\nlike a vivid section in a way\nit's it's very it um it hurts it does\nand like\nand a lot you know i think of myself as\na very thick-skinned person\nlike i'm a person who's been arguing on\nthe internet for four\nfour plus years professionally i am\nacquainted\nwith negative comments and negative\nfeedback\nbut i feel like this style of thing in\nparticular\nhas really hurt my self-image and it has\nkind of\ncaused me to become like preoccupied\nwith my appearance\nin a way that i think if i were not\nonline i never would have cared this\nmuch\nand in a way that i feel it sometimes is\npathological\nwhat what kind of preoccupations\nwell i i feel um\ni feel like i have to be very prepared\nto go on camera\ni i when i look at myself and the um\nyou know i'll glance over here and look\nat my um\nthe my own monitor basically\nand i'm just sort of analyzing it i\nimagine the things that people are going\nto say about me\nand i guess you sort of internalize this\nvery negative\nway of looking at you and\nthe worst part is then you you begin\njust applying it to yourself\nand maybe we're still applying it to\nother trans people\nwhat does that mean applying it to\nyourself well you sort of look at\nyourself with the owner\nyou're the same judgmental mean\nkind of gaze other people look at you\nso so i i find myself in if this is too\npersonal please let me know\nnatalie but i find myself like wanting\nto know the actual\nthoughts that go through your head\num that when when you see\nlike when and i would imagine that that\nactually your\ncriticalness of your appearance\nfluctuates personally\ni would say i would hypothesize and i'm\ncurious about you know when it's more\nactive\nwhat are the actual thoughts that you\nhave about yourself\nlike what thoughts kind of thoughts go\nthrough your mind\nwell i will i will sort of i mean if i'm\nfilming a video for example i'll be\nlooking over\nin the monitor and i'll see like you i\nlook like such a transsexual\nand i'll say well you are transsexual\nyou idiot of course you look like one\nand then and i'll you know i'll listen\nto according to my voice and be like oh\ngod like that does not sound good\nand you know it sounds like a fake voice\nit sounds like i'm\ntrying too hard or i will um\nlike i can't watch like my old videos i\ncan't watch videos\nfrom two years ago where i was sort of\nlike not as good at this\nas i am now and those are just horribly\npainful\nand when you say horribly painful so i\ni'm i'm going to share something with\nyou well let me just start off with this\nso i i'm noticing there's actually two\nthings one is your reaction\nand the second is your reaction to your\nreaction\nand i think a lot of toxicity that\npeople struggle with\nin terms of the way they view themselves\nactually comes from that second part\nright one is like so\njust to kind of repeat back to you and\nthis is why i'm asking so i want to try\nto illustrate this\npoint for other people too that you look\nat yourself and you say oh i look\nlike such a transsexual and then\nsometimes people you know clip what i\nsay\nso you know you you you say to yourself\noh i look like such a transsexual and\nthen actually i think\nthat's actually okay it to me but i\nthink the really damaging thing that we\ndo to ourselves is we\num we say of course you do\nyou're a [ __ ] transsexual right yes\nand\nand so like the funny thing is that you\ncan respond to that initial\nobservation in two ways which is like\nyeah this is just\nyou know i'm i'm never gonna look like a\nperfect woman because\nyou know somewhere in there there's a y\nchromosome and that's okay\nright like i can learn to be like i can\nbe accepting\nthat i'm not gonna look a particular way\nor whatever but\nbut i think when we really get into\nthose dark places it's like you can make\nan observation\nwhich is fair right and then like but\nthen it's like the thing that we tell\nourselves\nafter the observation that's really\ndamaging\nand what i find is that people try to\nfix that first thought\nwhich is they like try to convince\nthemselves that when i look in the\nmirror\nyou know i don't want to look like\nwhereas like i think that's actually\nmissing a point which is that\nit's it's okay to look like that like\nyeah you know\nno i agree that like i think that\nsomething i sort of\ni think is an area i've begun to approve\nand prove a little bit recently\nis is to say like oh yes i like a\ntranssexual well good\nbeing transsexual is good and it's fine\nit's like you're allowed to be a trans\nwoman\nlike you're allowed to it's allowed it's\nit's an okay thing to be\nand if you look like one okay you are\none and that's not bad\nlike i think that's like the more the\nmore healthy response\nyeah and sometimes sometimes i'm like\nfeeling that sometimes i'm able to get\nto that\npoint of confidence or i'm like well\nyeah\nand like that's fine and like that's not\nsomething to be ashamed of\num and then sometimes i slide back into\nlike the negativity about it\nyeah yeah so so in a weird way you say\nand that's fine that's not something to\nbe ashamed of\ni think like there's even one other\nlayer of compassion here\nwhich is that if you're ashamed of it\nit's okay to be ashamed of it\nyeah accepting the shame and like yep i\nguess\nnot blaming myself for it yeah\nabsolutely right so like like it's okay\nto be ashamed\nabout your appearance like it's almost\nlike saying like okay i get where you're\ncoming from\ncool man like don't beat yourself up\nabout it\num and i use man as a gender-neutral\nterm which i knew i know is going to get\nme in trouble at some point\nand i i try to catch myself but it\ndoesn't bother me\num so can you can you tell me natalie\nand and once again if we you know touch\nhow are we doing so far am i asking you\nquestions that feel hurtful or personal\nno no this is good okay this is i i\nthink it's actually really helpful\nbecause i\ni like hearing your actual thoughts\nbecause i think that's\nsomething that we all do whether you're\ntrans or cis or whatever\nwe all judge ourselves and then\noftentimes\nbeat ourselves up for our own judgment\nand the wildest one i heard recently\nwhich is so common\nit just really hurts me sometimes to\nhear that when people make progress\ninstead of being happy about it they\nbeat themselves up for not making\nprogress sooner\nyeah it's one of the strangest\nphenomenon but like instead of like\nmoving forward in life\nas you start to move forward you start\nbeating yourself up more and you kind of\nsay like oh\nwhy didn't i do this when i was 20 or\nit's really strange anyway\noh it's well that's definitely how i\nfeel about transitioning like there's a\ni think this is very common there's a\nlot of regret for like why didn't i do\nthis earlier like\nit would have been easier when i was\nearlier i would have missed out on less\ntime and like it's uh you know i i\nreally\nstarted taking hormones when i was 28 so\nthat's on the later side\num you know and i feel like oh it would\nbe if i'd done this when i was 19\nthis would have been so much easier had\na better result like\ni would have wasted less time in this\nlike gender limbo that i spent a lot of\nmy 20s in\nbut i don't know it is like it's it's\njust what i had to do it's just what i\nhad to go through to realize this to get\nto where i am\nso uh i try not to like to dwell on the\nregret too much and like it could be\nworse like it you know i\ni did get it i got it in my 20s and like\nyou know things have gone pretty well\nfor me considering\nit's not not necessarily something to\ncomplain about but it is often\nyou know it's a kind of background\nregret\nyeah why not complain about it\nwell i don't know maybe it's fine to\ncomplain about it okay\nsometimes it also accompanies it as kind\nof i think i think among trans people\nenvy is so common like\nit's it's one of the things i feel makes\nmy community of trans people sort of\ndifficult for me to be around\nis that i feel like there's\nyou know we're all sort of under the\nsame pressures and so there's this like\nlike girls who look amazing\nand who kind of pass easily as women\nand and just you know are kind of\nthriving in that way\nare they often intensely resented by\npeople who haven't made that\nand the other side of this is that often\ntimes like the people who are\nyou know trans women who are super\npossible who are pretty zoo or whatever\nlike they they can be very contemptuous\nof people who aren't\nand i find myself often like in\nboth of those mindsets at various times\num\nwhere you know sometimes i i will look\nat the other\nthe trans women and particularly on\nyoutube who thrive and a lot of these\npeople are people who transitioned it\nyou know 16 17 18 another 22 and they're\ngorgeous and they're perfect and i'm\njust like oh god\nlike why am i even allowed to be on\ncamera around these people\num and then other times like you know i\nthink i will kind of\nwas a terrible part of psychology human\npsychology\nwhere the sort of abusive things that\nare said about you\nthere's a sick pleasure and reiterating\nthose things that someone else\nand i like um i'm sorry to say that i'm\nnot a buff\nat least in my head doing that to other\ntrans women yeah\ni think sometimes sometimes we forget\nthat\nhatred is born of hurt in my\noverwhelming experience\nyes and and you know not not that this\nis a conversation about themselves but i\nthink that's just another example of a\ncommunity where\nmost of these people that i talk to it's\nusually like\nthere's some hurtful experience that\nhappens to them\nand then they start to hate the thing\nthat hurt them which\nunfortunately is part of being human um\nyeah and and what what do you i mean\nwhat is it\nso it sounds like you're aware that you\nexperience envy and you sort of also\nhave some\nmean thoughts what's that like\nto like see someone who's like 16 and\nhas transitioned and\nand i'm imagining a miss the boat sort\nof kind of feelings that can\nit's a very mystical feeling like it's\nthere's this there's this this intense\nlike\nregret and longing and envy to have\ngotten\nwhat i miss you know what i mean i think\nthat there's definitely an element of\nthat\num and i\nuh you know i try not to dwell on it\nbecause i know it's it's totally\nunproductive\ni can't go back in time like you know it\nis much better to look forward and be\ngrateful for what i had you have and\naccept it but it is also you know it's\nhard to entirely put it out of your mind\nyeah so oddly enough um natalie i'd i'd\nplay devil's advocate there for a second\nand i think part of the reason that\nthose feelings linger\nis because you may not be dwelling on\nthem enough\nright so like like i think that this is\na really challenging\ntight rope to walk but the balance\nbetween emotional processing\nand like wallowing in regret whereas\nyeah you know i i hear this thing a lot\nand it sounds really positive and i\nthink generally speaking it is\nbut it's not true peace right so if you\nsay like oh like you look at that person\nand you have thoughts of like\nyou know envy and you have thoughts of\nregret and then you kind of say well i\nshould be grateful because at least i\ndid it\nin my 20s and yeah i'm lucky enough to\nhave done\nxyz and maybe i don't live in you know\na country that's less accepting of trans\npeople\nand and so what happens is you take that\nnegativity and you like like\npush it down with positivity yeah\nyeah absolutely and that that's adaptive\nbut i think what i've seen is that like\nthen the negativity keeps\ncropping up right and and ultimately\nwhat you want to do is\nis actually like accept that you know\nmourn\nright as opposed to regret and or even\njust accept that\nregret and accept that this is your i\ni'm going to toss out a word karma or\nkarma like this is just\nyour path in your life and it's not\ngoing to be perfect\num but it got to be careful because i\nthink a lot of times we try to squash\nnegativity with positivity especially if\nwe're like\nyou know pretty\num decent human beings for lack of a\nbetter term\ni've heard only i've heard this term\nlike toxic positivity thrown around\nto describe this like sort of refusal to\nengage with the negative\nto the point where it becomes like\nalmost damaging\nand or damaging yeah i was gonna say not\nalmost\nno let's see it becomes damaging and\nyeah i do think that especially like\nbecause i have a i i'm very conscious of\nthe fact that like i can in the grand\nscheme of things like i am lucky and\nprivileged\nbeyond most trans people and\nthere's a scent with that there's a\nsense of like\ni have no entitlement to this petty\nregretful like moping\nyou know because i'm so lucky to have\nwhat i have\nbut it is true that it it does that does\nnot\nare you that sounds to me like toxic\npositivity\nyeah okay maybe so cause\nbecause i i think let me let me like if\ni can just share something with you\nnatalie like so\nyeah i think this is a really common\nproblem i mean i think it's a problem\npeople disagree with me so i i think\nthat like\nno amount of privilege\nor luck it\nexcuses suffering right like so\nlike like would then i think he was\nright about this sort of said that like\nhuman beings suffer it's like part of\nwhat we do and no matter how much you\nhave\nwe suffer and somewhere along the way\nlike we started blaming people who were\nprivileged for suffering\nand i'm not saying that like people who\nare privileged shouldn't appreciate it\nright so this is really tricky because\npeople sort of say like if i express\nsuffering and i have some kind of\nprivilege\nthat i'm being ungrateful or you know\nyou you tell yourself that that like i'm\nfeel i'm entitled but i think you're\nallowed to suffer and i think if you\nhave privilege you should use that\nprivilege for the betterment of the\nworld but\nyour individual suffering like no amount\nof privilege and we can see this because\nyou know you can see a lot of people who\nare very successful and have a lot of\nmoney and things like that\nwho are clearly like distraught and bent\nout of shape and things like that\ncelebrities and\nand you know yeah political candidates\nfigures they're told there is this sense\nthat like\nonce you make it to a certain level like\nwell you've lost your right to complain\nlike\nor or you cannot possibly be suffering\nunless\nthere's something sort of wrong with you\nright\nlike if you're if you if you have money\nand you have success\nand you're not happy well like you're\nungrateful you're spoiled you're not\naware of your privilege and if you just\nbe aware of how lucky you are\nthen you would be happy um but yeah i\nfound that not to be the case at all i\nmean the last year\nlike this has been one of the hardest\nyears of my life\nto be honest and it's also uh\noh well a lot of things um but but one\nbut certainly not a lack of like\nyou know career success like i'm i mean\nthis is i'm at the peak of this i've\nnever\nyou know i'm i'm doing financially very\nwell like\ni'm doing the views thank you\nthe views are just pouring in like i can\ncount on a million views per video which\nis like\nit's wild it's like it's a lot of views\nbut most people are on this website on\nthis platform are lying to get that\nmoney\nand it's like i don't think i ever would\nhave believed\nfour years ago that having what i have\nnow\nwouldn't have made me happier it would\njust be unimaginable to think that oh\nhaving all these things i wanted\nif getting them wouldn't really make me\nhappier\nbut it doesn't and it's like it's\nit's hard to like i don't know if i can\nconvince anyone of that i feel like it's\nsomething you almost deceive for\nyourself\num because i know it's not like no one\never told me it's like it's almost like\nplatitudinous that like money doesn't\nbuy happiness\nlike we all say these things but\nthen when you're when you you don't\nreally believe them until you live them\nyeah that's like that's kind of where\ni'm at so\nso um so many different places to go so\ni'm going to give you three options that\ni'd love to talk about let me know if\nany\nfeel okay to you one is i'm a little bit\ncurious about\num what you think and feel when you\nwatch older videos of yourself\nthe reason i feel like that's important\nis because i i hope natalie that you can\nactually just\nbe at peace with where you are\nand i think the way to really get there\nis by confronting\nyou know what you've stuffed down about\nthe way that you look at yourself or the\nway that you think about yourself\nthat's one second thing um which maybe\nis a little bit more philosophical is to\nthink a little bit about\nyou know where does happiness come from\nright so we do have these plat\nyou know these like platitudes um is\nthat\nplatitude that doesn't feel like is that\nthe right word\nokay um about you know money doesn't buy\nhappiness and sort of this idea so then\nlike where does happiness come from\nand what can we understand about the\nnature of happiness\nand the third thing that i find myself\nbeing curious about is you said that the\nlast year hasn't been easy and i'm i'm\ncurious about what's been challenging\nfor you\nbecause it sounds like from a\nprofessional standpoint you're doing\nreally well you've cornered what made it\nyeah and and so what do you what do you\nthink any of those\nkind of resonate with you or that\nthey're all pretty good\ni think uh yeah we'll start with um\nsorry what was the first one the first\none was like what do you see when what\ndo you think of\nwhat do you think or what happens in\nyour mind when you look at older videos\nof yourself\noh yeah so i just can't stand it like\nbecause i see someone you know at a much\nearlier stage of transition\nand like a lot of things are wrong with\nwhat i'm seeing\nlike i'm seeing like uh you know like oh\ngod like i didn't know how to do makeup\nproperly it looks terrible\ni what am i wearing like what kind of\ncringy not understanding how to dress\nyourself as a woman\nthing is this like what i i hear my\nvoice which at the time is much worse\nthan it is now i mean\nwhen i was you know if you go way back i\nhad like\na much deeper much more masculine voice\nand then\nthere's also a lot of just deeply\nawkward stages along the way\nwhere my voice i'm trying to i'm trying\nto sound\nmore feminine because i'm more womanly\ni'm not succeeding\nyou know that's my impression of it it\nsounds like strained\nand false you know and it's like\nthere's already this success this like\nsuch like negativity around\ntrans women being like men\ntrying to be women or men acting like\nwomen that to like go back and see\nmyself\nbasically as that is very painful\nwhat hurts about it well\nit's a i guess it's\ni'm at a point where i think of myself\nlike\ni don't think of myself as a man trying\nto be a woman\ni think of myself as a woman with a male\npath\num and so to see myself like as almost\nthis like\ncaricature of what i don't want to be of\nwhat people\nlike i like to think what people\nmistakenly think trans people are and\ni'm like literally seeing myself as that\nlike it's like i just hurts because i\nsee\ni sort of take the gaze that people\nmaybe see all trans people as\nand i literally have seen myself that\nway so interesting\nyeah so what i'm hearing you say is that\nlike when you look at yourself from a\ncouple of years ago\nyeah you see the negative stereotype of\na trans woman\nyou are the embodiment of what people\nnegatively you're like you're you're uh\nyou're the embodiment of the negative\nrepresentation of a trans woman\nyeah that's exactly what it is yeah\nhave you ever seen this subreddit called\nblunder years\nno so it's it's it's like a great place\nwhere people post like pictures of\nthemselves like\nusually during teenage years or things\nlike that and yeah\nand you know i guess to play on wonder\nyears but like the blunder years like\nbefore you got to\nbe where you are you know when you were\ntransitioning\num you know it's interesting because\nwhen i hear you talk about yourself the\nthe closest thing that i can think of is\nactually like thinking about puberty\nand just how awkward puberty is\ni think that i think it has a lot of\nparallels to\npuberty i mean sometimes people are\ntrans you know trans world we call it\nlike\nsecond adolescence meaning that it's\nlike a\na period where similarly your body is\nchanging\nyour identity is changing your social\nworld is changing\nand so in a lot of ways you act like a\nteenager\nacts and you make mistakes that\nteenagers make but i feel like this\nadditional layer of being undignified by\nan older person doing it\nand you know the person who should know\nbetter we think right\nand like that's the second part yeah\njust just started interrupt but like you\nknow so like you set a standard like so\nlike you're allowed to blunder yeah\nit's it's when you say that you should\nknow better like you're not\nallowing yourself to go through a second\npuberty\nyou know with all that entails including\nthe awkwardness and the incredible\nyearbook pictures\nright yeah no i think this is true i\nthink that like\ni think that would help me a lot more if\ni could reach a point of compassion of\nseeing\nthis as like an awkward like sort of\npseudo-adolescent period um i guess\nwhat is the obstacle to that well part\nof it is that most people\ndon't transition right so there's not\nlike a widespread\ncultural awareness and like relatability\nto like because everyone knows\neveryone can relate to looking back at\nyour like 16 year old yearbook and being\nlike oh god\nright because i think most people kind\nof do but but it's much harder to relate\nto like\ni don't know looking back at you at age\n28\nin your early transition stage making\nall these terrible faux pas\nand like and just like not having it\ntogether\nyeah so i can see what you're saying\nabout you know not having it relate\nto the common experience um\nbut in my experience and there's a butt\nthere right so\nnatalie that i i think that relating to\na common mis\nexperience is a common mistake about\nlike\ngrowth because i think actually the more\nyou look at your own growth\nit sounds to me like you've grown\nimmensely and i think most of the growth\nthat you've gone through\nhas nothing to do with the common\nexperience in fact it has been\nin spite of and separate from the common\nexperience which is your point exactly\nyeah but what i'm saying is that if you\ncan grow so much without\nsharing this like you know a common\nexperience with other people that common\nexperience is not\na necessity for growth and in my\nexperience it's actually like\npersonal introspection that\nis the real answer right like i can\nprocrastinate and the rest of the world\ncan procrastinate and i can feel\nvalidated\nand connected to other people because we\nall procrastinate\nbut ultimately my journey against\nprocrastination is one that i have to\nwalk\nirrespective of what everyone else is\ndoing\nand so you know what i'm hearing is like\ni i just think that you've really got to\nthink about why you judge yourself so\nharshly\nright and where does that come from when\ndid that start\nwell i think it's a product of being\njudged harshly by other people\nlike especially during those times when\nlike like i said people are\npeople who don't pull in punches they're\nvery mean like online and like\nwhen you put yourself out there\nespecially on video\nlike there's not a lot of restraint that\npeople have in terms of saying what they\nthink about you\nand so i feel like it's these series of\nexperiences of like\nhumiliation i guess and we're shaming\nyeah where do you remember any\nexperiences of like\npretty strong humiliation or shame like\neven before the age of 18\nlike even before you started to dabble\nin this kind of stuff\num\nwell i yeah\ni can um i mean i can remember like i\nyeah i was i was when i was you know\nearly teenage years\ni had like you know a girlfriend for\nwhatever that meant at the time you know\nfor two years\nand sorry not to for two months um and\nlike\ni remember like one of her reasons like\nfor breaking up with me\nwas this sense of like why can't you be\nnormal\nlike why why are you wearing your hair\nlike that why you just advised that\nyou're framing little like\nto see you know like and and\nso there was a sense of shame about that\nthere was a period where like i did try\nto be like more like a normal man\num i think that when i was when i was\nlooking around in my early twenties\nespecially i was like\ni was giving it a real try um so\ni think all i think that like the first\npart of the shame was the shame\nabout being like i mean at the time like\nyou know a a male identified person or\nmale 1\ni'm just functioning as a man in society\nbut with this like sense of that it was\nwrong for me and is longing to do\nsomething else\nbut a thing that like you're very\nstrongly discouraged from doing\nas a man right so i i think that like\nthere's a kind of identity fracture at\nsome point in here because now obviously\ni don't apply\nthe standards of manhood to myself but\nit was a time when i actually did\nand i felt that you know so there was\nthis kind of\nshame around that um and then when i\ntransitioned you know\nthat involved overcoming that shame to\nto to sort of put myself out there as\nlike no i'm actually\na different person than you think i am\nand\nlike it's just it's a shameful thing\nthat is not\nexcept socially acceptable but like here\nhere it is\num so there was like this moment i guess\nof triumph them\nabout of having overcome a kind of shame\nbut i feel that it was replaced in a way\nwith an almost a whole new world of\nshame\nwhere it's like you're you know you go\nfrom shame from not being\na good enough man to not being a good\nenough woman\nas people start judging you by different\nstandards\nyeah so so natalie this may be you know\na touch academic\nand and you know i'd say that if you're\ninterested i don't know if you you see a\ntherapist or\nyou know have anyone that you can kind\nof confide or work\nthrough things but if you don't i think\nthis is a great kind of\nthing to work through with someone but\num and maybe you already have\nbut i think that you got to be really\ncareful there so my understanding of\nof the mind comes primarily from like\nyogic theory and like eastern\nconceptions of mind\nand i think that essentially what\nhappens is you've got like this ball of\nshame\nwhich just changed clothing and the\ntricky thing there and i think this is\nwhy things don't get better is because\nso it totally makes sense that people\nare toxic towards you on the internet\nlike that's going to leave a mark and\nthat's going to change the way\nthat you talk to yourself completely\nagree actually after hearing your story\ni think that there is the the real red\nherring here\nis that you did triumph but that there\nwas a piece of it that was left over\nand like changed clothing and then\nstarted to be like\nbut that toxicity actually lingered and\ni suspect that it actually started way\nbefore your transition\ni think i think it started with the way\nthat you started to talk to yourself\nas these trans feelings like so your\nlack of acceptance for who you are\ndoesn't come from youtube i mean i know\nthat youtube comments can be\nreally impactful for people but i think\nyou've been carrying that with you for a\nlong time\nnow i think you're right about that i i\nthink that you know i'm thinking back\nso i transitioned in 2017 that's when i\nstarted medically\ntransitioning but like there was an\nearlier period where i considered it\nback in it was in 2014\nand that you know i was living in\nchicago at the time\ni was kind of experimenting with\ndressing more androgynously i would go\nout with nail polish and like you know\nmakeup on and i i was i was sort of\nmoving this direction that that\nis like sort of difficult of someone\nwho's like moving towards the gender\ntransition\nbut i can remember having experiences\nof like seeing other trans women who\nlooked like\nme like out in public like on the subway\nand having this strong reaction of like\nyou know oh god\nno i can't be that i do not want to be\nthat i can't look like that this is not\nacceptable\nand then like that shame causing me to\nlike nail polish gone make up god\nget it together like we can't i can't be\nthat you know\nwhich is like a really ugly thing to\nthink about someone else\nright a horrible thing to think about\nanother trans woman\nbut it was not based it was it was it\nwas it was\nsort of disgust with myself in another\nperson in a way\nabsolutely it was yeah it was seeing\nlike oh god people are going to see me\nthe way they see her\nand like i can't i can't handle that so\ni know this sounds bizarre natalie but i\ni jotted down i've been taking very few\nnotes but one of the things that i\njotted down\nis i wrote down the word someone and\nit's so interesting because when i\nactually asked you\nwhat do you think when you\nlook at videos of yourself from a couple\nof years ago\nit's the first time i heard you use the\nthird person talking about yourself\nyeah it's it's it's like a tiny thing\nand then you switched into first person\nbut like it was a strange way because\nlike it's almost like\nyou know the thoughts that you the\nthoughts that come\nup when you look at old videos from\nyourself\nsound to me exactly like the thoughts\nthat came up when you saw someone who\nwas transitioning\nabsolutely it's absolutely bad it's like\nit's like i'm seeing like this shameful\nthing i see in others i see in myself so\nit's almost like i don't know which came\nfirst was it me being sort of judgmental\nand transphobic towards other people\nor was it being judgmental and\ntransferred towards myself\ni don't know so natalie this is a i'm\ngonna take a shot in the dark it's not\ntransphobia towards other people it's\nactually envy\ni think at the root of this is your envy\nfor the ugly person\nhow so because i think that like you saw\nthose people\nand you saw them doing something that\nyou thought was\nugly and i think deep down you wanted to\ndo it too\nsure yeah and and so i think there's\nmore there than transphobia there's more\nthere than revulsion\nthere's i think as you mentioned right\nlike like i think there's envy wrapped\nup in that\nthat like i don't have the courage\nto be the ugly person that maybe i\nshould be\ni don't have the courage to be ugly\nyeah i'm afraid i no it is it is that\nit's like\ni it is a kind of i guess cowardice like\ni can't\nespecially at the time like it was like\ni\ncannot handle the life this person is\nliving\nyep right so so i think that\nself-judgment doesn't come\ni mean so i think you know if you look\nat the internet the internet is going to\ncall you\nmany things natalie but coward is not\ngoing to be one of them\nyeah maybe not right so that sense of\ncowardice doesn't come from the outside\nit comes from you\nit comes from your own judgment about\nnot doing this thing and that's like\nregret is rolled into that too\nyeah right like what do you regret that\nyou weren't\nwhat you weren't courageous\nyou didn't do it earlier you do it\nearlier yeah right and then you judge\nyourself\nfor like not being courageous whereas\nlike\ni mean you know i don't mean this to be\ndemeaning but i think you were like you\nlike literally went through\nlike a second puberty right you went\nthrough a coming of age you went through\ni mean you're a late bloomer and i think\nthis is something that uh\ni think a lot of our community like on\ntwitch and gamers and whatnot like\npeople who watch youtube like we hold\nourselves to a certain standard of time\nlike life is a race\nand then we're falling behind and it's\nvery biased towards like\nvery young people because that's who's\nrepresented on these platforms\nyeah and and we kind of look at all\nthese people and\nand we like look at ourselves and we say\nlike oh i'm behind and it's like i i\ndon't know how to stress this to you\nnatalie but\nbecause i think you understand this\nstuff i think the interesting thing\nabout think about the way the mind works\nis that\nyou activate your mind activates certain\nprogramming which is not\nthe natalie that i'm talking to it's\nlike a natalie from a couple of years\nago like these feelings are old they're\nnot like current feelings it's kind of\nweird\nbut you know it's like it's just like\nlike opening up an old picture of\nyourself like\nlooking at an old picture like that\npicture retains the age\nat which it was taken even though you\ncan grow and change\nyou have these things in your mind that\nare like\nrelics of your past\nand when those things activate you know\ni think there's a lot of envy\ntowards people who are more courageous i\nthink there's a lot of\nlack of acceptance towards yourself\nwhich we kind of have been talking about\nbut i think what you've really got to\nthink about or what i would you know\nencourage you to read about or think\nabout is just to really recognize that\nlike\nyou were supposed to be quote unquote\ndon't even steer clear of that\nright that was just that's just what\nhappens in puberty like\npeople start getting acne and their\nvoice cracks and like it's just an\nawkward time that's part of your\njourney and i think what keeps you from\nbeing happy today\nand now we can maybe transition to\nhappiness but is that like\nultimately you know success and stuff is\nfantastic i i don't think that that\ndoesn't contribute to your happiness\nit's just that\nyou're carrying these things from the\npast\nand as long as you you know view\nyourself as a coward as long as you\num because you're very self-aware\nincredibly insightful incredibly\ninsightful\nvery aware of your internal process\nyou're really gifted in that way\nand and um i i i mean i think you have\nto be to transition right like you've\ngot to really dig in there and see like\noh wow\nthis gender is not what i feel like as a\nperson\num but i think until you sort of work on\nthat stuff i i think happiness is gonna\nbe\naround the corner unfortunately which\ndoesn't mean that you can't enjoy things\nand you can't be happy but\nthat old hurt you're going to carry with\nyou\nyeah i think well i guess that's the\nthought i've had i thought before that\nlike if i could\nbe if i could find like some kind of\nlove\nfor that person that i'm like so\nurgently feel feeling willing to\ndistance myself from\num then i think it would i think i would\nhave a more peaceful\nmind um because it is kind of a burden\nto\nfeel i mean especially because like as a\nyoutuber like\nlike i'm never gonna to me it feels like\na ball and chain like my own path feels\nlike a ball and chain that i'm dragging\naround\nbecause i made that what i think is a\nridiculous decision\nto transition with the camera on and\nit's like oh why did i do that why would\ni\nput myself in this position now where\ni'm sort of because\nonline it's like time it's it's like\nfrozen it's frozen yes it's like it's\nlike\nlike people perceive you as this like\nfour dimensional\nlike like uh you know ever\npresent person or the past is just as\nimmediate as the present because they\ncan just\nyou know you can watch my video from\nthree years ago and there it is right on\nyour screen you're gonna hear my voice\nyou see my face\nit's like that person is there still um\nso so yeah natalie i have a\npseudo-meditative exercise for you which\ni think could be\nchallenging and painful but i think\ncould help you a lot\nyou want to give it a go sure okay\nso this is what i'm going to ask you to\ndo okay i'm going to walk you through it\nand then\nyou're allowed to say hey i actually\ndon't want to do that okay\nokay so so here's so when you look at\npictures of yourself or videos of\nyourself\nyou know you react a particular way\ntotally fine\nyou know you think certain things about\nyourself and you sort of externalize\nthem\nlike you sort of turn it but you think\ncertain things about yourself i can't\nbelieve i was like that whatever\nso that's a very selfish way of thinking\nright because when you look at yourself\nyou're thinking like oh i'm so\ndumb by by selfish maybe self-centered\nor self-focused is a better way to think\nabout it\nall of your thoughts are about you and\nthat can be hard to develop compassion\nwhen you're just kind of thinking about\nyou so what i like to try to do i've\nnever really done this before but\nhopefully it'll work\nmaybe it'll help maybe it'll be a\ncomplete train wreck is i want you to\nwhen as you watch that video\nwhat i want you to do is first of all\nnotice those things right and notice\nthat those are thoughts about\nyourself or maybe someone else is a\nlittle bit clear but then i want you to\nask yourself one question is you watch\nthat person\nand that is or maybe you can just tell\nus not so much about what that person is\ndoing right or wrong but what does that\nperson\nneed\nright what is that were you calling\nyourself natalie back then\nyeah yeah right so like think about like\nwhat did that person like need more than\nanything else in the world like what is\nthat person's experience of life in that\nmoment\nyou know and really try to like put\nyourself back in those shoes instead of\njudging it try to be\nempathetic and just like what like as\nyou look at that\nthat image of yourself and you guys can\ndo this to anyone who's watching right\nif you regret something\nor you judge yourself to like go back\nand and try to think about\nyou know if you could go back in time\nand actually have a conversation with\nthat person from three years ago\nwhat would you say to them and if the\nhypothetical is enough we can talk about\nit otherwise i would encourage you to\nactually pull up\nan image of yourself and look at it and\nwatch what happens\nwell i think like on the top of my head\nwithout even looking\ni mean i i feel that what i just needed\nwas like\ni just needed time like i needed time\nto make those mistakes and time to like\nwork on the things that needed to be\nworked on\nworked on and like you know i\ni know it's gonna things are gonna be\nokay now\nbut it's like and at the time i just\nneeded the i just needed the experience\nto to learn how to how to sort of\nbecome a more comfortable uh\nself that's not this kind of like person\nwho's sort of straining\nto be what i couldn't yet be right so\nso like if i were to tell you natalie\ni'm gonna try to pretend to be you\nfrom three years ago and i'm gonna say\ni'm\ntrying this stuff out and i feel really\nreally dumb about myself because when i\nlook at myself in the mirror i'm ugly\nyeah i don't know who i am\nbut i know it's not this what would you\nsay\nuh well i'd say look like first of all\nlike you're not\nthat ugly like it's really not\nworth worrying about it but like also\nmore to the point like\nyou know i understand that you're not\nhappy with who you are and you're trying\nto be someone else\nbut like the way this works is\nyou have to you can't try to become\nsomeone else\nyou have to learn how to become\nyou have to learn how to express\nyourself\nand i know sometimes it feels like\nokay but i'm transitioning so shouldn't\ni be trying to get away\nfrom you know this thing that i used to\nbe that i don't want to be\nand it's like in a sense that's true\nbut also i think that\nyou know doing it by forcing it\nis sort of i don't know uh\nit's making things worse than it would\nbe if you had a more relaxed\nattitude towards this and like\nweren't trying to sort of rush it so\nmuch because in some ways i thought\nyeah but if i had started earlier like i\nwent through\nlike a male puberty yeah and so because\nof the testosterone like my jaw is\nbigger now i've developed all these\nsecondary characteristics\nlike i i mean you're telling me that i\nshouldn't force it but like\ni'm telling you that i should have\nforced it a long time ago\nthat's so well because if i started this\nprocess\nearlier like i wouldn't be in this\nsituation i wouldn't be awkward now yeah\nwell that's also true that i you know if\ni had\nif i had done this you know earlier then\ni could have sort of gotten myself\ntogether\nfaster and i wouldn't have such a long\nperiod of the\npast that i feel is like an alienated\nfrom\nso great so i don't know if you noticed\nbut that's exactly what you should do\nso i think we just flipped i think we\nhit the barrier i don't know if twitch\nchat is going to understand this\nis just all in my head so like\ni think you did a fantastic job of\ntalking to yourself\nthe message that you sent to yourself is\nexactly\nwhat you should be thinking and and yeah\nright like i just go back and like watch\nthis later\nbut like that's not what you say to\nyourself but it's exactly what you need\nneed to hear and it's exactly how you\nneed to talk to yourself\nwhich is not dismissing the negativity\nit's just saying hey this takes time and\nyou're gonna have to figure it out and\nit's gonna be a bumpy ride\nyeah right that's what you told yourself\nbut those aren't the thoughts that you\nactually have when you look at a picture\nbut now what i want you to do is the\nnext time you look at a picture of\nyourself from a couple years ago\nsee those two conflicts right just like\nyour philosophy degree where you take\nthe other side\nand you try to sit in it now you've got\nboth sides of the argument and just\nswim in those waters i don't know how\nelse to put it to you now\njust swim in that space i have faith\nthat given your\ndegree of self-understanding given your\nanalytical capability\nand given your earnestness for lack of a\nbetter term\nif you just give your mind and your\nbrain the opportunity to swim around\nin those thoughts and feelings you're\ngonna come out fine\nand then what happened is i asked you\nabout the regret\nand then you had trouble talking to\nyourself in the right way\nright so like then you started like\ngoing back to your standard thought\npattern i don't know if that makes sense\nbut i've never heard you talk about\nthe old you in the way that you did\nduring this exercise\nbut i think we hit the border of kind of\nwhere your exploration is\nand like where your compassion is and\nwhere your empathy is\ndoes that make sense to y'all like i\ndon't know but anyway does that make\nsense to you\ni think well i think in a sense yeah\nbecause it's like\nthe more compassionate i guess i guess\nresponse is like\ni was doing my best at the time now\nmaybe that's not\ngood enough at my standard now but it's\nlike\nstop time so so now you're\nintellectualizing that's not what you\nwere doing earlier\nright now you can because you're [ __ ]\nsmart natalie so you can\ncome up with logically what the right\nanswer is but logically the right answer\nis not actually empathy or compassion\nyeah the way that you were talking to\nyourself was not a logical conclusion\nabout what this person needs to hear\nit's an empathic connection it's like a\n[ __ ]\ni know what it's like to be there and\nand friend you just need time\nright it's not the it's absolutely the\nright answer but it's coming from\nonce again like you know it's not coming\nfrom the outside it's coming from within\nand so i don't care about what\ncompassionately what you should say to\nyourself\nbecause you can't say that to yourself\nyet but you i think you\nclearly i mean at least to me you've\nmade progress today\ni don't know if that makes sense but i'm\nsorry i think no i think it's i mean\nhonestly like\ni think a lot of this has been like more\nhelpful than a lot of actual therapy\ni've been to like\ni think that like like i mean i think\nyou're doing\ngood but i think that um uh\nlike we've zeroed in pretty quickly on\nsome things that are like the major\nproblems\num i will say like i guess that another\ni guess maybe something that holds me\nback somewhat is like because of the\npublic nature of this\neven if i feel that even if i can sort\nof form a kind of compassion for that\npast self\ni sort of feel the way that i was judged\nat the time and there's this fear that\ni'm going to be continuously judged\nnow for the way i was then because of\nthis\nthis like 4d like you know\ntime eternity that we have but natalie\nokay so now i'm going to talk logically\nand i'm going to express a little bit of\nfrustration\nbut i'm not frustrated at you i'm\nfrustrated with the part of you\nthat does this to yourself so the reason\nthat you're\nafraid that the rest of the world will\njudge you that way\nis because you judge yourself that way\nuh well i do but also other people too\nyeah absolutely right but like the thing\nis\nis that like i don't know how else to\nsay this but if it's\nif you're on the same team with the\ntoxicity of the internet\nyou're gonna [ __ ] lose yeah well you\nneed to be on\nyour team they can say whatever the [ __ ]\nthey want to\nyeah but the cool thing is just like if\nnatalie three years ago\nhad you as a sister supporting her she\nwould be in a completely different place\nand i can tell you that your ability to\nstand against the toxicity of the\ninternet\nis going to be transformed if you can\nstand with yourself\nyeah you're damn right you're right\nbecause you're [ __ ] smart and that's\nhalf your problem\nthat they will continue to hate on the\nquestion is\ndo you want to join them\nwell that is the problem isn't it\nbecause like because i feel that\nso many times i have essentially\njoined in yes with those people like i\ntake their voice into my own head and it\nbecomes like\npart of me and it becomes my own\nperspective yeah so i think you've got\nto\nbe careful a little bit about where\nyou're giving credit you said you take\ntheir voice into your own head which you\ndo\nbut you had that voice before they did\nthat's true yeah right so be careful\nyeah and so if we're thinking about your\nagency and empowering you\nit starts with the acceptance that this\nvoice is not\nsure they reinforced that they fanned\nthe flames they threw fertilizer on it\nlike call it whatever you want to i'm\nnot saying that that's positive\nbut i think you have way more power up\nin the way that you look at yourself\nthan the internet does\nyeah well that's that should be true\nuh i mean i i guess it is technically\ntrue because\nyou know then there's a limit to how\npowerful the internet can be in\neffect affecting me but uh yeah it's\nlike as a question is like\nhow where i'm gonna find that\ncompassion um because i i sort of had an\nawareness for a long time\nthat like this is this this is something\nthat's missing it's\nit's something that i feel like if i\ncould if i could find this if i could\ncreate this\ni would be much stronger and i would\nhave a lot more fun online frankly\nyeah because yeah all this all this\nawfulness commentary\ndummy i mean it could be sort of just\nbrushed off as the sort of amusing\nridiculous\nnonsense that it is um\nthe like the weird hate obsession that\nother people have is that that is simply\nnot my problem\nright um it's a question of like\ni just can't seem to get to the point\nwhere i genuinely don't care and when\nwhere there's not still this part of me\nthat's\non their side yep so so well said okay\nso\nlike here's your quarter unquote answer\nso the first thing is that\nyou did it today i'm pretty sure i heard\ncompassion come out of you that was not\nthere before\nand i think it's the way that and so i'd\nsay just go back\nand like evoke those feelings and then\njust ask yourself pretend that you're oh\nyou're your own older sister yeah right\nand like how would you talk\nto your how would you talk to that\nperson who's stuck in time\nnow you're sort of lucky because like\nthat person is still preserved right so\nyou can like actually kind of go back in\ntime and like talk to them\ni think that literally that exercise\ntowards yourself so like i'd say like\nanother thing you can do is\nimagine that time that you had you know\nnail polish on\nand like you went and you saw someone on\nthe subway who was like\none of these ugly transsexuals\nyeah and and just like you know just\njust walk yourself through\nand like listen to the way that you\nthought about your like you you thought\nabout that person\ntry to explore that feeling and then\nlike talk to yourself\nnow right and and that gets more\ncomplicated that's the barrier by the\nway\nwe hit that barrier and you can see it\nif you go once again go back and watch\nthe vod\nthere's there was a new thinking and\nthen i saw the old thinking kind of crop\nup\nyeah and so you just gotta i mean you\ngotta work at it right so i'd say like\njust\njust learn how to talk to yourself so\nyou're gonna you're gonna figure out you\nknow\nlevel one you can talk to yourself from\nthree years ago level two\nmaybe five years ago you just have to\npractice\nthe second thing oh [ __ ] something else\noh yeah the second thing is that\ni think just in general\nthe more that you can accept\nthat you were a toxic [ __ ]\nand the more that you can accept that\njust like all the other toxic [ __ ]\non the internet\nyour toxicity actually comes from hurt\nit doesn't come from you being a bad\nperson and the more because right now\nwhat happens\nyou judge yourself for being the [ __ ]\nright\nyou're like oh i used to be bad like\nthat and i try not to and stuff like\nthat\nwhat i want you to do is is follow that\npull on that thread\nback to its source hurt and once you\nfind that source hurt\nthen you can express compassion towards\nit i think the reason you can't be\ncompassionate towards yourself is\nbecause i don't think you've tracked\nback\nto the actual wound\nso follow the thread of hatred back to\nthe wound\njust like incels right like go back to\nthat rejection\nand like like then then you can be\ncompassionate if you know like what\nhurts\nyeah i think um you don't know how to\nkiss the boo-boo because you don't know\nwhere the boo-boo is\nyeah i think it's hard to place exactly\nlike where it starts it's more of a damn\nright it is\nyes yeah like a couple of things come to\nmind but i don't know\nlike i don't know what the origin is\nexactly yeah so but\nnatalie that's what you've got to\nexplore right and this is the thing it\ndoesn't have a origin\nso if you get a chance to go back and\nwatch if i have a video about some scars\nyou should just go back and watch that\nbut the thing is each of these so that\nhurt it's that's actually the\nbeautiful answer that makes me more\noptimistic so the way\nso i think what's what's going on this\nis some scar so some scar is a sanskrit\nword that means a ball of undigested\nemotion or an emotional trauma\nand essentially what happens is that we\ncarry around this ball of undigested\nemotion with us\nand every experience that we have that\nsort of relates to it\ngrows the size of that emotional trauma\nand so when you're saying i don't know\nwhere it starts the way that you fix it\nis by going through each of those the\nmore things that you can think of\nconversely actually the easier it's\ngoing to be to heal because each of\nthose needs to be processed\nsort of with me i'm going to give you an\nexample in a second yeah yeah\nso if if we think about like let's say i\nhave a phobia of dogs right like that\nphobia of dog starts with one dog biting\nme\nand then what happens if i get bitten\nagain what happens to my phobia\nis it confirmed confirmed right yeah and\nthen\nif i get bitten the third time fourth\ntime fifth time the more\nexperiences i can think of of dogs\nbiting me the greater the emotional\ntrauma is and so interestingly if you\ncan think of a handful of things then\nyou need to go back\nand talk through each of those right we\nthink like okay that first time that dog\nbit you it actually didn't bite you the\nsecond time this happened\nthe third time this happened and you go\nback and you process each of those and\nthen\nnatalie you'll feel it you'll do it it's\nactually i\ni can't i feel really optimistic for you\nbecause if you can already think of a\nbunch of things that's because\neach of those things relates to that\nsome scar\nright why does your mind think of like\nlike if i say the word sushi and your\nmind thinks about six different kinds of\nsushi that's because it's all related to\nthat core concept\nso i'd say if you've done therapy you\nknow go through each of those\nexperiences and really think about\nwhat hurt about this where does my anger\ncome from\nand track them back and then you'll find\nthis ball\nof like amorphous relatively undigested\nemotion\nthat sprouts and pokes through the\nground\nin several places but just because you\nsee a lot of different shoots\ndoesn't make your life harder it\nactually makes your life easier\nyeah well\ni i can say yeah i guess\nyou think you could just describe to me\nlike what it would look like to process\nlike an individual one of these\nincidents sure so give me an example\nwhat's one of the things that you\nthought about um\nwell okay this is like not necessarily\none of the earliest but i guess sometime\nwas the first six months or seven months\nof my transition\ni can recall like basically like going\ninto\na restaurant and like trying to get a\ntable\nand having them just like straight up\nlaugh at me and be like\nlol like this like like\nthis is like a crazy cross-dresser like\ni forgot exactly what they said but it\nbut it was um you know\nso there's that or they think there's\nlike the time\nwell hold on a second okay sorry keep\ngoing keep going sorry\nlike another time i was walking down uh\nthe street and like early on and like\nsome got like it was a guy who was\nfollowing me\nand sorry this is like a little bit\nexplicit\nbut he just came up right behind me and\nsaid\nwould you mind if i sucked your dick\nlike\nwhat is the point of that except to make\nhim make it to\nhe wants me to know that he knows that\ni'm trans\nand also he wants me to feel degraded\nabout it\nokay i don't know why he said that it's\na weird thing to say but i completely\nagree\nbut but like there's a couple\nexperiences like like\na bunch of experiences like that where\nit's like well people like\nthere's sort of people they want me to\nknow that they know that i'm trans\nthey don't want me to get away with\nthinking that\nthat people see me as a woman and\nthey also like want me to feel bad about\nit and they succeed at that\nokay\ncan i think for a second yeah yeah\nso if people are wondering that's the\nsump scar\nso it's this this whole okay\nso let's just look at something\nlogically for a second okay\nand i'm i'm gonna try to unpack\nsomething but like it's okay you don't\nhave to\ni'm gonna point out logical\ninconsistencies i don't want you to\ndefend them\nbecause i think that's a sign that we're\nmoving in the right direction\nso the guy who walks up to you and says\ndo you want me to suck your dick\nand then you say he wants me to feel dot\ndot dot dot dot\nand then like literally is you\nhypothesized two reasons\nwhy he did that and then and then\nliterally in the next sentence you're\nlike i have no idea why someone would\nsay that\nyeah well i just think it's a weird way\nof getting\nthose things across well but so that's\nthe thing is i don't know\nwhere you get the idea of what he was\ntrying to get across\nso you may have some insight that i\ndon't have\nand i'm sure you do right because you've\nbeen on the receiving end of a lot of\nthese interactions\nbut i think it when you say they don't\nwant me to get away with it\ni think that's like\nnatalie do you think you're getting away\nwith it\nget away with what you tell me what were\nyou referring to\nwell i guess\nnice dodge but what i feel is that\nthey're trying to do\nis that they're kind of trying to\nhumiliate me\nby making sure i know that they are\nclocking me\nas like a transgender person\nyou know what i mean like hey like no\none sees you you know\ni don't see you as a woman like just so\nyou know do you see yourself as a woman\nnatalie\nuh well i kind of go back and forth kind\nof um\nthere it is yeah right so like\ni don't think i mean i could be wrong\nright so you've dealt with more toxicity\ntowards transgender people than i have\nyou know sucks for you and so you\nprobably have a better understanding of\nwhat's in their head than i do\nbut i'm gonna go out on limb and say\nyou're really\nfrankly could be projecting a lot of\ntheir motivations\nbecause when i ask you because like\nhere's here's the\ncrazy thing right that's the [ __ ] sub\nscar he said they don't want me to get\naway with it and i ask you\nnatalie are you a woman and\nthe way i'm going to interpret your\nanswer is that i really want to be\nbut i'm not sure that i'm getting away\nwith it\nyeah i think that well so i i see what\nyou're saying\nand that i do think that like if i was\nlike 100\nconfident i know who i am like i know\nthat i'm a woman\nlike nothing anyone else thinks can\nchange that then this would not bother\nme to the extent that it does right\nprecisely it's the fact that it's\npicking at\nwhat is already an insecurity exam\nright that's the sum scar so that's why\nwhen a random person who\nyou know who knows what the [ __ ] he was\nthinking because\nit sounds like a real perv but when when\nyou can take\nand granted you can assume some things\nabout you know what they're thinking but\nlike\ni think generally speaking like that\nbehavior is so\nfar outside the norm that i would\nconclude that you\ncan't actual like your capacity to\nimagine what that person is thinking is\nactually quite low maybe\ncould be different for you but but i\nthink what happens is ambiguous\nambiguous interactions small\ninteractions short interactions\nlike you walking in and they're them\nlaughing like do you even know that they\nwere laughing at you i know it sounds\nlike a crazy question\nwell sometimes you're not really sure\nbut sometimes but sometimes sometimes\nlike it's they're looking at you in a\nway that it's like\nit seems like that they could be\nlaughing at you for some other reason\nbut\nbut like what else would it be\nexactly right so so i i think so that's\nthe thing is i\nonce again natalie i'm hopeful because\nyou're insightful this is your insecure\nit's not coming from other people so\nthen the question that\nnow we have to go to the root of it is\nlike like where\nwhen did you start to think that you\nwouldn't get away with it\num well i guess what do we mean by\ngetting away with it as in like\nyour language yeah so okay i i guess\npart of what i'm talking about here is\nlike it's like\npassing as a woman like having other\npeople see me and then just\npick up okay that's a woman you know uh\ni guess to me well especially the the\nperfect example\nlike because it's because like sometimes\npeople apart from me just the way that\nthey perform on\nany woman you know and that doesn't\nbother me\nbecause it's like because it's like well\nyeah because you're passing\nright that's what they do but like they\ndo that's all\nto most of them they're to a lot of\nwomen and so it's like okay it's not the\ngreatest thing but it also doesn't\nreally needle me in the same way\nbut it was the way this guy did it\nspecifically as a reference to the fact\nthat i'm trans\nyeah you know what i mean and so it's\npart of it\ni guess in a way like part of the pain\nis like it's regardless of the fact\nthat regardless of\nof of what he was trying to do\nwhat he said is still revealing that\nlike he got me\nyou know yeah so yeah but so i i think\nthat he can\nonly get you if you don't if you're\nhiding something\nyeah right yeah\nit's true that like it and i think this\nis an area where i've made some\nprogress like you've made a lot of\nprogress\nyou're allowed i'm allowed to be\na trans woman and part of that is i'm\nallowed to look like a trans woman\nabsolutely um and like but for a while\nthat seemed like\nso unacceptable it was like no like if i\nlook like a trans woman like\nthis is failure like this is like\nequivalent to looking\nlike ugly and unlovable blah blah blah\nblah blah like\nand so it became this whole painful\nthing yeah yeah\nbut i mean that's what that's it natalie\nyeah\nso like it's like going back in time and\nlike examining\nthose thoughts the thoughts of\ni feel like a failure right so and i\nthink i think you're right you've come a\nlong way but the problem is that like\neven though you've learned how to make a\nreally delicious dinner\nyou still have you haven't taken out the\ntrash from the failed attempts before\nright right and so i think that there's\nstill a lot there about like\nwhat you need to accept yourself as and\ni you know maybe i'm rubbing people the\nwrong way here but like\ni think you've got to accept yourself as\nwho you are which is a trans woman\nwhich like i mean maybe this is\noffensive and please let me know if it\nis but like\nif you are holding yourself up to a\nbeauty standard that involves two\nx chromosomes yeah that's just like\na battle that's gonna be hard to win and\neven if you do win it someday which i\nhope you do and great for you\nyou still can't really it's like just\nnot fair to beat yourself up for like\nlosing all of the attempts until\nyou know someone injects you with a\nvirus that replaces your y chromosome\nwith an x chromosome or something like\nthat\nand then you're like you know like like\ni mean you are who you\nare right yeah and and for a long time\nand i think that's sort of the antidote\nto it but i think you still have to\ntake out the trash which is to go back\nto all those times where you were\nhunting\nright you were expressing yourself at\nfirst you were\nhiding a woman in the man's body and you\nwere hiding it being\na man right and then your girlfriend\ndumped you because you weren't masculine\nenough\nright and so so like you've been hiding\nyour entire life and i think it just\ngoes back to like each of those\nexperiences and talking those through\nright processing them and recognizing\nthat i've been trying to hide who i\nam for way longer than i'm pretending to\nbe a woman i don't mean that\noffensively but like i think i'm putting\nmyself in your shoes\nbecause i think you sometimes still\nthink that you are pretending to be a\nwoman\nyeah no i i agree that with that or at\nleast that i'm pretending to be like\ni'm i'm sort of i'm getting this great\nsense of security\nfrom the idea that people are just\nperceiving me as like a biological woman\nyeah you know what i mean like the\npeople are not noticing any transness\nabout me is it this great sense of\ncomfort\nand like i do still have this experience\nwhere like\nokay so here's something that happens\ntime to time like if i meet a new person\nlike and they don't know what i do they\ndon't know anything about me\neverything seems to be going well and\nthen they ask like oh like what's your\nwhat was your job and i'm like i\ndo internet media\nthey want to know okay explicit oh my\ngod i'm a youtuber and they say what's\nyour channel about oh you have to tell\nme so i can google it right now\nand then like i'll tell them and then as\nthey google my name\ni will just like like i can feel my face\nget like hot with the shame\nof knowing that what they're about to\nfind out yeah\nso that's coming from you friend yeah\nit's not coming i mean as much as those\ntoxic [ __ ] on the internet think\nthat they have power over you like i\njust don't think\ni mean sure they can hurt you don't get\nme wrong\nbut like that's the shame that is like\nit's the anticipatory shame\nof them knowing yeah right and you're\nright because it's security but like\nthis is this it goes back to courage\nnatalie yeah security is about like\nhiding from them something about\nyourself\nbecause you're afraid like why is that\nsecure for you because\nyou're afraid of what they'll see\nand how they'll react and like why is\nthat and like that's because it goes i\nthink that goes back to like\nhow you used to react yeah\nwhat you see in them is like yeah and\nand so\ni think it's like it's like i mean i\ndon't know how to say this but it's all\nthis crap like we can't\nunfortunately we can't do it all today\nbut i think these are the threads you've\ngot to run down right like your own\ntoxicity towards other people the way\nthat you used to judge them\nbecause that's the way you judge\nyourself yes\nit's it's about like learning that\nyou're going to be a trans woman for the\nrest of your life\nyes and i i don't think yeah no that's\nlike that's something that i recently\nhad\nlike it's kind of because i'm you know\ni'm\nwith like almost three and a half\nsomething like that years into medical\nand social transition and like i i'm at\na point where\ni've sort of dispelled this illusion i\nguess from earlier on\nearlier on it there's there's almost a\ndelusion that takes hold that's like oh\ni'm going to get to the end of this and\ni'm just going to be a cis woman\nbut it's like no i'm not like i'm kind\nof\nso so here's here's the problem\nright so like i'm not an expert in\npolitical theory or sociology\nif i say something that's offensive i\napologize\nhere's what i see as a problem and\nyou're welcome to think i'm wrong\nif you don't accept yourself as a trans\nwoman\nyou're placing a value on cis women over\ntrans women\noh 100 yeah right and so that's i think\nthe basic problem is that like you are\nvaluing something above yourself that\nyou will never be\nyeah and impossible and then you're\nconfused why despite your material\nsuccess you were unhappy\nyeah right\nwell yeah and and so like natalie like\nit comes to like\naccepting who you are and accepting that\nyou know like there are a lot of parts\nof you that are ugly and you hate\nyourself and whatever but like i think\nyou've got to go back and and just\ni mean that's the thing until you accept\nyourself\nfor who you are right and you can still\nlike want to be more feminine but once\nagain it's like that has to come from\nyou and that has to come from like\nforward momentum it's like you're like\nthe person who\nwants to lose 50 pounds and has lost 30\npounds and you're beating yourself up\nbecause you still need to lose 20 more\nlike it's going to be a journey\nyeah and i don't think at least in this\nlife you're ever going to be a cis woman\nwe'll see\nbut the thing is i don't think that\nthere's a problem with that\nyeah right i think it's like if you\nthink there's a problem with that that's\non you\nbut if you think it's a problem with it\nthat's not something that's ever gonna\ni mean maybe medic who knows right well\ni feel that it's like\ni feel that it's something i sort of\njust i mean there are trends the one who\nkind of say like oh i'm not even trans\nanymore i've had all the surgeries like\nlike but i don't know i think that i\ndon't quite agree with that i think that\nlike\nthere's no erasing who where you come\nfrom\nand i guess natalie do you try\nyeah well sure i do especially i mean\nlike not all the time i don't try\nall the time and i'm like aware that\nonline like in like come on\nthe game is up people know that i'm\ntrans like but but it's true that\nthat like offline i do try\nto keep people from knowing okay a lot\nof the time\nand like and i guess on some level i\ni there's also a regret almost at the\ntime on the internet it's like well\ni might have had a chance to just kind\nof blend in and just not have to deal\nwith any of this\nif i hadn't made this so public yeah\nso the regret is once again about the\nsecurity it's about the mask\nyour regret is that like you let people\nknow who you are\nyeah if your regret would have won you\nwould be living a life that is\ninauthentic and you'd be happy and\nunhappy anyway that's true yeah it's\nhard to really but like you've got to\njust\nswim in that [ __ ] yeah\nwell i know like for some as trans\npeople like that like it's called on\nlike\nwe call it living stealth which is when\nyou're living\nyou're not out as trans the people\naround you people just think that\nyou know if you're trans women people\njust think you're a woman they don't\nknow about your trans history\num so i think part of the i think\nbecause i've heard from a lot of people\nwho live that way\nthat it actually kind of eats away at\nthem in its own way\nbecause they're keeping this major part\nof them with other people\ni think part of my issue is that i never\nhave lived like\nstealth except in these like little\nisolated incidents where i'm like\ni'm enjoying the fact that i've just met\nthis person and they don't seem to know\nyet\nyou know um but like i i think that\nbecause i don't have that experience of\nliving as stealth\ni guess i feel like\ni don't know i wish i had like at least\nmore of that and maybe if i did have\nmore of that\nthen i would realize that it's not that\ngreat and i wouldn't care you know\nso natalie i you know this may be i\ndon't even know what the statement is\ngonna do\ni didn't realize you were a trans woman\nwhen i watched your youtube video\ni don't know how that's going to affect\nyou like how does that make you feel if\ni tell you that\ni love it anyway\ni know i'm not supposed to know and i\nwas supposed to love it but it makes me\nfeel really good\nokay so so forget about what you're\nsupposed to do\nyeah like why like i'm telling you\nto you know so you can look at yourself\nand like\nwhat feels satisfied well it feels like\num\ni guess it feels like you saw me\nthe way i kind of want to be seen\nokay and now i know you're a trans woman\nyeah how do you feel\nuh i mean it's fine\nmost people know but like but i guess\nit's um\nit does i feel ch change a little bit i\nfeel like it must change it must change\nhow you see me\nsomewhat look at my face\nwhat do you see what do i think about\nyou\noh i don't know try\ni mean you invited me on your show sure\ncouldn't hear me that much but i i\ndidn't know you were trans when we\ninvited you on our show\nyeah uh well i guess\nnatalie look at my face and tell me what\nwhat i think about what do you see in my\nface\num well i i think i think you're\ninterested\nand and you care what i have to say\nokay good both true anything else yeah\nuh i mean okay you don't seem like\nyou don't you don't seem too disgusted\nwhat do you think about that um\n[Music]\nit's nice yeah so when you say something\nmust have changed what must have changed\nwell i guess it comes from this fear\nthat\nlike if people know that i'm trans\nthey're gonna like re-categorize me as\nlike\nokay probably like\ni don't know some kind of abnormal\ndeviant instead of just\nand we're trying to know like why why do\ni care so much about people think of an\nabnormal deviant i haven't had normal\ndeviation like\ni don't i don't know i don't know yeah\nso much because\nbecause like it comes from you man yeah\nand hopefully that's not offensive\ni just don't know i just don't know like\ni don't know\ni want you to understand why i have this\nlike conformist streak\nthat comes out about this particular\nissue when a lot of other ways i'm not\nreally that conformist\nyeah so like like here's the thing\nnatalie you were a complicated\nbundle of all kinds of [ __ ] some would\nbe good and some of it bad\nand i accept all of it\nwhatever there's a part of you that's a\ntoxic castle\nfine there's a part of you that's\nbrilliant and a good teacher fine\nthere's a part of you that's a trans\nwoman fine there's a part of you that's\njust a woman\nwithout cis without trans without\nanything else\nfine but you're you yeah\nand like every part of you that i've\nseen i think is great\nright like you're just you and like you\nkeep on doing you\nand don't worry about like you know like\nbecause when i tell you like\nwhen we explore my understanding of\nwhether you're trans or not\nit like it comes from your head because\nyou've been talking to me the whole time\ni've known your trans\nsort of the whole time right but it's\nlike even when i share with you like\nso you've had a particular impression of\npeople when we start\ntalking about my beliefs about whether\nyou're trans or not\nthis whole other complex arises in your\nmind do you see that\nyeah whereas we've been talking for like\ntwo hours and like\ni mean i don't know if it's been there\nor not but i haven't noticed it until\nnow\nwhich is like it's just weird it's a\nwhole separate thing\neven it's like my preoccupation with\nlike how you're seeing me or\nyes yes right and i i turned that switch\non\nby telling you i didn't know you were\ntrans\nyeah guys we've just been two humans\ntalking about\n[ __ ] for the last two hours and like\nit's been fun for me hopefully it's been\nfun for you yeah\nand then all i have to do is i have to\ntell you i didn't know you were trans\nbecause i really\ni don't know and then as soon as that\nlike a switch turns on in your mind and\nthis whole complex\nopens up but like that's just like some\nweird psychological conditioning or\nsome scar it's not anything to do with\nreality\ndoes that make sense yeah i i mean no it\ndoes i think\ni think that this this question of like\nwhether i'm being perceived\nas trans or whether i'm being perceived\nas a woman or whatever having perceived\nis like i mean it's maybe not as bad as\nit used to be but for so\nthere was there was years where this was\njust a constant preoccupation\nand so it's very easy to like re-enter\nthat state of mind you're damn right it\nis\nyeah that is the some scars so each of\nthose moments that you remember\nright you got to talk those through with\nsomeone and i don't know if you\ni don't know how much emotional\nprocessing you've done since you asked\nme how do i do that but i suspect a\nlittle bit\nso your tools are going to be like going\nback thinking through that\ntrying to talk to yourself like your\nolder sister\nyou may evoke compassion maybe like a\nshortcut to find you know what you\nneeded to tell yourself and\nhow to practice self-compassion which i\nthink everyone can do like one tool is\njust pretend that you're the older\nversion of yourself\nand i mean you know just going back in\ntime the third thing and i i kid you not\nnatalie is\njust noticing is enough to transform\nthis is the biggest like misc\nmisunderstanding of the largely western\nworld\nis that we think that doing something\nenacts change\nwhereas the yogis in the east say\nawareness of something is sufficient to\nchange it\nand so i'd say just notice these\nthoughts notice notice notice and when\nyou explore why do we say explore\nwhy do we say emotionally processed we\nare bringing things up from your mind\nfor you to notice and that is what\nemotional processing is\nit's kind of really bizarre but like you\nknow if you tell someone\nhey you know i just lost a loved one and\nthat person says to you\nhey i'm sorry that sucks is that person\nalive\nno no that thanks but like but why do\nyou feel better they didn't do anything\nright all they did is acknowledge yeah\nthey\nnoticed your hurt and that in and of\nitself is sufficient to reduce it\nit's crazy but that's how it works\nso that's my recommendation to you i\nthink that's maybe\nkind of part of the hope and part of the\nmotivation for making the like the more\npersonal videos that i do\nis like this this feeling that like oh\nif i can share\nif i can make up the other people see\nthe pain that i'm in\nthat will be some it will someone simply\nrelieve part of it\nyeah so i makes sense to me but i think\nthis goes back to something you said at\nthe very beginning of the interview\nwhich is that you're a confession junkie\nyeah right and i i don't think it's\nabout sharing with the rest of the world\ni think it's the reason that feels good\nlike why does confession\nis because you're noticing it right like\nyou're accepting it you're bringing it\nto the surface\nyou're not hiding it you're not masking\nit you're\nnot stealthing anything you're just\nbeing with it and then it gets easier\nwhich is like i think anthropologically\nlike probably one of the reasons that\nif you look at like a you know how\nconfession and things like that of all\nthat probably has something to do with\nit\nquestions well i know like um\na lot of teenagers are kind of like\nbullies\nand then come to like later regret\nor feel the horrible about having been\nbullies like i've talked to a lot of\npeople like\nlike they look back on their teenagers\nand they say like oh i was awful to\npeople\nbut it came from this space of like\nof being hurt themselves and kind of i\ndon't know preferring to like\nbe on the side of the person doing the\nhurting or something for once\ni guess\nsorry i was going with this\nwas the question you asked me huh\nwhat was the question what was the\nquestion you asked me i just said do you\nhave any questions\noh i guess um\ni guess i feel like the one thing i\nhaven't mentioned\nrelated to any of this stuff is that i\ndo feel that like\nin a lot of subtle ways that these\nproblems have like\nbeen behind some of the like uglier\nmoments in the time that i've been\nonline\nyeah and i you know i\ndon't know how wary of as you are but\nlike a lot of\nthe like i make a fairly controversial\nperson\nwithin trans spaces okay because of like\na lot of people are upset about some\nlike borderline transphobic things that\ni've said in the past\nand it's i i sort of i\ni know that those the things that i said\nthat\nthat are contra i didn't say anything\ntoo horrible but like it's something\nthat like\npeople kind of pick up on because in a\nsense when they say that i'm transphobic\nthat they're right\nlike like i feel like if they're exactly\nthey're exact they're exaggerating\nobviously they say they don't know the\nmean way or they're trying to vilify me\nbut like they're they like they see the\nsame thing that you're seeing\nyou know and\ni feel that and i feel that on some\nlevel they're right that it has like\ncome out in these ways that are\nsometimes\nugly and i guess i just don't i guess my\nfinal thought is like\ni wonder if there's any way to kind of\nlike undo some of the damage of that\nsure of course\nso so i i know it sounds like a simple\nanswer to what sounds like a heavy\nquestion\nbut absolutely not so i think it starts\nwith what i'm hearing is that there's a\nlittle bully in you\nthat sometimes is a little bit bullying\ntowards trans people\nwhich we know because you bully the [ __ ]\nout of yourself all the time\nand and that it peaks out and then some\npeople from the trans community\nblame you for it yeah which i don't\nthink you're\ntransphobic in the way that there's like\nthrough transphobic people but\ni'm not surprised that there are people\nwho are attuned\ntowards some of your negative attitudes\nthat fluctuate and peak out\nin your content i think it's not\nactually fair\nor compassionate for them to like zero\nin on those moments\nin the larger scheme of your overall\nthread\nright i tend to be a pretty\ncompassionate guy sometimes i can be a\ndick\nand i think it's fair for people to\nsniff that out\nand like i'd also appreciate it if they\ncould you know look at\nthe scope of my things and judge me for\nall of it\nthat's what i want to yeah yeah so i\nmean but that's sort of on them and\nyou ask can i heal from it i think\nabsolutely and i think this\ngoes back to what we're talking about\nwhich is that you've got to start with\nyourself\nright you've got to start with like\nstopping the bullying towards yourself\nthis is the crazy thing that is you kind\nof alluded to is that a lot of bullies\nare bullies because they're hurting in\nsome way\nlike if you look at kids that are\nbehavioral and like hit other kids\nit's oftentimes because they were abused\nand you kind of mentioned you've alluded\nto this but it's something that i call\nthe cycle of abuse\nand it's like the cycle of abuse\ncontinues like we see it in like medical\ntraining where\nyou know you get yelled at in the\noperating room by a surgeon because\ni mean it's like my second day and some\nguy's yelling at me because i don't know\nhow to do surgery i'm like\ndude if i don't know how to do anything\nin this room it's [ __ ] your fault\nlike it's not\nyeah you're the person who's been doing\nmy second day bro\nand and so so we do that right like we\nlearn a particular way of like\ninteracting and then we adopt those\npatterns and we propagate them\nso if you want to make the world a\nbetter place and you want to heal the\nhurt that you've caused and i don't\ndoubt that you've caused hurt and that's\nnot because you're a bad person because\nwe all cause hurt\nlike you know we're new at this thing\ncalled life\nyeah can you fix it i mean can you fix\nthose\nparticular things no i maybe not but i\ndon't think that's relevant i think\nyou've got to start\nby like trying to make the world a\nbetter place that i think you can\nabsolutely\nstart by understanding why you bully\nyourself\nthat too track that back to your hurt\ncompassion towards that hurt will make\nthe bullying behavior go away\nand once you become that person i have\nno doubt in my mind that you will be\na force for overall met good in the\nworld if you aren't already\nand that's what i think you should do in\nthat my friend is your karma\nthis is your journey and you've been\ngiven these challenges\nyou've walked this path you've learned\nhow to stumble\nyou've learned how to fall and then you\nwill be in a different kind of place\nbecause right now bullying yourself in\nthe trans community is transphobic and\nno one is going to do it\nbut i would venture that a lot of people\nare doing exactly what you do\nbut the problem is it's so [ __ ]\ntransphobic no one's allowed to talk\nabout it\nso no one can ever help each other with\nit no one else can ever be compassionate\ntowards it\nwell that is the problem is that because\non the one hand it's\neither other people who are like very\ntransphobic\nwill take your side and then the people\nwho are hurt by what you're saying the\nvilify you for it\nso it's like the only compassion that is\nis had for you is well there's no\ncompassion for you right\nit's either taking your side into an\nevil way well it's not an ethos of evil\nbut like you know in\nsome way in a mean way a malicious way\nyeah so\nthere's like you know they're they're\nseeing you as this villain\nso natalie this is what i think you need\nto do you need to\nhelp yourself first and foremost and\nthen what you need to do\nis shine out towards the rest of the\nworld\nyeah right like once you become\nlike pure and clean and you accept\nyourself who you\nare just let broadcast that [ __ ] out\nthere\nand some people are gonna get pissed at\nyou and some people are gonna glom on\nand some people are gonna twist your\nwords\nbut it's been my overwhelming experience\nthat when you just\ntry to work on yourself and you become a\ndecent human being and you just let the\nrest of the world see\nit tends to work out pretty well yeah\nso start by fixing the hurt within\nyourself and then you can talk about\nbeing transphobic or bullying yourself\nor the hateful thoughts and if you use\nthose words right if you use if you say\nlike\ni used to like look at myself in the\nmirror and like i'm ashamed of who i see\nthere is no doubt in my mind that like\nyou know lots of trans people out there\nare going to resonate with that and then\nwhen you say\nthis is how i learned how to be\ndifferent a lot of people are going to\nresonate with that and then they're\ngonna stop bullying themselves and then\nyou'll be a\na force for good in the world and you\nwill have healed the hurt\nsound good that sounds very good\nthis is very helpful glad because i\nnever know where this is going to go\nno this is going very well okay i'm glad\ni i i i need someone to tell me things\nevery day\nokay yeah so who can that be\num there's a couple of people in my life\nwho\nlike incorrect i think i think okay\n[Music]\nwho is that i have to tell myself is\nthat damn right\nyeah yeah right\nbecause here's the crazy thing what do\nyou tell yourself every day\nuh what do i tell myself every day yeah\nright\npsy says it all yeah\nyeah you're right you absolutely need\nyou need to hear these things every day\nyeah you're damn right you and everyone\nelse is insecure\nor struggles with something you need to\nhear this every [ __ ] day\nand there it's wonderful that you have\npeople in your life i encourage you to\nrecruit them\nbut once again it depends on which side\nyou're on are you\non their team natalie are you on the\ntoxic team\nyeah to work on it\ni have faith in you you come this far\nand i think that like it's hard to come\nthis far without\nyou know having a lot of courage a lot\nof resilience\nbrilliance frankly\nyeah cool\nso i i'm kind of done you okay wrapping\nup\nno i'm good that's that's sounds great\nto me\nyeah um so you know in terms of\nmeditation sometimes i'll teach a formal\npractice but\nin this case natalie i really encourage\nyou to like\nwatch what comes up so like go and look\nat a picture of yourself and like\nwatch what comes up and even like like\njust\nwatch those thoughts and those feelings\nand then like try to be your older\nsister and that's going to take practice\nyeah you know if you feel ashamed of\nyourself just look at yourself in the\nmirror and see\nwhat comes up see what you tell yourself\nright and then try to it would be good\nto do to be able to do that because i\nfeel like then i could also be an older\nsister to other\ntrans people which is something that i\nsort of have not quite gotten\nto be able to do yeah because you\nhaven't been ready yet\nyeah so that's your karma\nright so like it'd be interesting\nbecause i think from like a karmic\nperspective\nthat if you wanted to be an older sister\nto lots of trans people\ni would recommend a career like a phd in\nphilosophy where you're doing research\nin in an academic setting\nas opposed to having a youtube channel\nwith a million subscribers where you\nhave a platform where you can\ncommunicate\na message of positivity towards people\nwho need to hear it which one would you\npick\nwell i suppose at this point\nthe decision has been made i don't know\nyeah i feel like i think this can be\ndone either way yep\nand i think that's your karma right\nbecause oh lo and behold\nyou happen to have a platform where you\nget three million views\nfor videos that you make interesting\nyeah it's a lot of um well it's\nit frightens me actually the amount of\nresponsibility that it comes with that\ngood that is the best feeling that\nyou've had\nall the time today you should be\nterrified it's terrifying\nbecause natalie you have a big burden on\nyour shoulders\nyeah and the world needs you yeah\nand so time to you know start treating\nyourself well\nget fully aligned with who you are as a\nperson because there are lots of trans\nwomen and trans men and cis women and\ncis men\nwho are insecure about what they see and\nneed something from you\nand it turns out that you're an\nincredibly thoughtful person who can\ntell a very succinct\nstory with lots of context and\nbackground and you have a training in\nphilosophy and argument\nso if you have something to say turns\nout that you're actually pretty skilled\nat saying it and helping people\nunderstand\nso if you feel the crushing weight of\nresponsibility on your shoulders i'd say\ngood job\ngrow the [ __ ] up and get to work sounds\ngood\nall right thank you so much for coming\non\nyeah thank you for having me this has\nbeen this\none was a little more interesting than i\nimagined it was going to be\nfor me too no you're a trans woman\ni don't know\nbut hey natalie it's been delightful\nit's been great yeah\nit's been good so you guys just you want\nto just tell people who are here a\nlittle bit later a little bit about what\nyou do and where we can find you\nuh yeah um so my name is contra points\nis the name of the channel c-o-n-t-r-a\npoints and uh yeah twitter\nyoutube instagram i would focus on\nyoutube the other stuff\nyou know yeah so she makes really cool\nvideos that are like really\nwell thought out um and and kind of\nstart to finish i think it's like really\ngood\nit's not just something like snippet\nit's like really well thought out\nso check out contra points thanks for\ncoming on and good luck to your friend\nthank you so much all right bye\nthat was different from what i was\nexpecting\nbut uh yeah that was great\nman she is awesome"
