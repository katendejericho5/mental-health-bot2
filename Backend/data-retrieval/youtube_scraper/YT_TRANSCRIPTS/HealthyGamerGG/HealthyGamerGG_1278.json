    "transcript": "i want to talk to you guys for a second\nabout\nfighting yesterday's battles and\ninsecurity\nso the first thing to understand is that\nlike\nyou know be careful about what makes you\nfeel good and what makes you feel bad\nbecause a lot of times we have hunger\nand that hunger is to like\nright or wrong from like yesterday\nor a decade ago or two decades ago\nright it's an insecurity that's born\nlike when we're young\nand then what happens is we carry that\ninsecurity we like feel a particular way\nabout ourselves right like we're not\nattractive or we're not worth loving or\nwe're stupid or we're smart which can\nalso be an insecurity\nand then what happens is like we want to\nwe do everything we can to reassure\nourselves\nthat that insecurity is false right so\nif you're\nif you think you're smart and you're\ninsecure about your intelligence\nthen you won't ever really apply\nyourself\nbecause you'd rather half asset and get\na c\nthen do your best and get a b and so you\nlook for reassurance around that\ninsecurity\nif you're in a relationship for example\nlike you need to hear other people tell\nyou hey like\ndo you really love me and so you seek\nreassurance and there's that hunger\nright like you want other people to tell\nyou\nthat yeah you're worth being with you're\nawesome you're beautiful\nor you run around on the internet and\nyou\nyou know talk about how smart you are in\ntheoretical physics because you want\nother people to appreciate your\nintelligence\nyou need that appreciation and so the\ntricky thing about insecurity is it's\nlike a hunger inside you that needs to\nbe fed from the outside\nand so you go outside you look for i'm\ngoing to get it fed over here i'm going\nto get fed over here\ni'm going to flex on these guys i'm\ngoing to stomp these noobs\ni'm going to show everyone\nand the crazy thing is that the things\nthat you need to show\neveryone are the things that you don't\nbelieve about yourself\nyou're looking to solve that insecurity\non the outside\nyou're looking for their responses\nto show you that the insecurity is false\nbecause you believe it yourself\nbut you're afraid that it's true so you\ngo to other people and the problem is\nthat kind of hunger can be satisfied for\na time by reassurance\nbut it's like a band-aid because the\ninsecurity comes from within\nand so anything that you do from the\noutside is not gonna fix it\nand that's what we see right like the\nperson who needs to be reassured in a\nrelationship needs to be reassured the\nnext day and the person who thinks\nthey're really smart and flexes on these\nnoobs\nhas to flex on some other noobs tomorrow\nbecause the internet is not like those\npeople don't flex on like egotistical\npeople on the internet aren't\negotistical one day\nand then they disappear no they live on\nthe internet for their entire lives and\nthey're\nthey're flexing on everyone as much as\nthey can because they believe\nsomething about themselves that they\ndon't want to be true\nso the crazy thing is like how do you\ndeal with that and the first thing is\nstop feeding it from the outside\nbecause here's the crazy thing when you\nhave an insecurity and you feed it from\nthe outside\nwhat happens to things that you feed\nthey grow\nand so each time you seek that\nreassurance you're gonna need more\nof it the next time and you're gonna\nneed more of it the next time\nand the more you rely on outside things\nthe more i know this sounds\ncrazy the more you become dependent\non those outside things you need those\noutside signals that's what you rely on\nto feel good about yourself and then you\nwind up with these kinds of\nsituations where you feel wonderful one\nday and you feel like crap another day\nand what's the difference it's how\nyou're treated by the outside world\nyour happiness is not dependent on\nyourself it's dependent on other people\nand so then what you do is you sign away\nthe rights to control your life to the\noutside world\nand then you're not in control\nlife is taking you wherever it wants to\ntake you you feel powerless other people\nmake you feel a particular way\nyou're a victim to their feelings and\ntheir whims\nso what do you do what do you do about\nthis\nit's hard but you start by going to the\nsource of the insecurity and recognize\nthat\nif you're confident if your confidence\nin yourself is lacking the only place\nit's going to come from is within\nif you're insecure about your appearance\nno amount of reassurance by the outside\nworld is going to make that go away\nif you're insecure about your capability\nabout your worth about your value\nno amount of the outside world is going\nto be able to teach that to you\nso what you've got to do is sit with it\nright so like look at yourself in the\nmirror and then like\nlook at yourself and this be like okay\nwhere is where is the ugliness and you\nmay see it\nyou may see it right away you look at\nyourself in the mirror you'll be like oh\nmy god\nthis guy's hideous and then notice how\nyou feel and sit with that feeling and\ntolerate it tolerate the hunger\ntolerate it sit with it\nand then something magical will happen\nit's going to be a waiting game\nit's going to try to feed thoughts into\nyour head\nbe careful don't give in to those\nthoughts put your focus on something\nelse\nso go and find like a candle\nand then like look at so what i want you\nto do is place a mirror\nand place a candle in front of the\nmirror and then look at the\nlook at your reflection in the mirror\nand then look at the candle\nand then look at the candle and put your\nentire attention on the candle\nand then notice that as your attention\ngoes onto the candle\nthe hunger within you the thoughts of\njudgment of your own appearance\nwill begin to subside and then you step\nback into the arena you look at your\nreflection again\nand notice all of those thoughts come up\nand then turn your attention to the\ncandle and with each of those moments\nthe hunger will start to subside it'll\nstart to melt away because you're not\nfeeding it\nand if you do that practice enough the\ninsecurity will dis\nwill dissolve with it all you guys have\nto do is stop feeding it\nbring it up face the hunger and stop\nfeeding it\nyou can even do with food if you have a\ntemptation with food watch what happens\nto your desire\nget some kind of food or get a coke or\nwhatever you kind of struggle with and\nlook at it\nnotice your desire come up and then turn\nyour attention to something else\nand then look at the thing again notice\nit come up and turn your attention to\nsomething else\nand eventually learn how to tolerate\nthe bad feelings on the inside and as\nyou learn how to tolerate them as you\nlearn how to\nsit with them you will start to accept\nthem and they'll start to dissolve\nand the insecurity will dissolve with it\nso stop fighting yesterday's battles\ntoday because that's what we see a lot\nof\nright everyone else made fun of you so\nnow you've got to show the rest of the\nworld how awesome you are\nit's yesterday's battles it's not\ntoday's\nand it ends up creating all kinds of\nthese like weird problems in your life\nbecause\nyou start to be treat people in a way\nthat's kind of bizarre\nand is like dependent on how you felt\nsome time ago\nso stop fighting yesterday's battles\ntoday and the second thing is\nstop fighting internal battles on the\noutside\nif you have an insecurity nothing in the\noutside world is going to take that away\nthat's a battle that has to be fought\nin here so if you want to do that that's\nhow you deal with insecurity\nin terms of meditation practice i\nactually encourage you guys to do what i\njust said\nso to actually take a candle and go and\nsit\nin front of a mirror and look at\nyourself in the mirror and see what you\nthink about yourself\nand then look at the candle and then\nlook at the mirror\nlet those thoughts come up and tolerate\nsit with the person that you are\nbecause you're not a bad person but it's\nwhen you refuse to hang out with\nyourself and you distract yourself with\nalcohol or video games or whatever\nthat you start to like slip away be with\nyourself\nsee who you are because i guarantee you\nthat\nit's not nearly as bad as you think it\nis if you guys need a little bit of help\nwith this kind of stuff\nthat's what we made our coaching program\nfor right because\npeople want time with dr k but\nunfortunately i'm a little bit busy and\ni can't reach everyone\nthe good news i know this sounds crazy\nbut it turns out that if you look at\noutcomes the coaches tend to do\nas well as i do in terms of actually\nimproving people's lives\ni'm not saying that you're going to have\nan emotional catharsis within the first\nsession that's probably not gonna happen\nbut people do have emotional catharsis\nthrough our coaching program pretty\nconsistently it's just\nthe coaches work a little bit slower\nthan i do but at the end of\neight twelve or sixteen weeks we tend to\nactually\nhelp our clients the same amount so\nthey're basically as good as i am\nso if you guys need help with that\nthat's why we started the coaching\nprogram\nand we're building additional things for\nyou guys\nmore stuff like what we're doing"
