    "transcript": "because like what did they do to you man\nand how is that fair\nit blows my mind that you're not angry\nand hateful towards everything in the\nuniverse\nhello hello hey man how you doing today\ni'm doing great how are you\nuh it's an early morning but i'm doing\nwell so\nperfect that's great i just i think our\nsound levels and stuff\nare good um yeah so and and what do you\ngo by\nuh you can call me george george okay so\nwelcome george\ni'm all up it's nice to meet you nice to\nmeet you\nthat's a cool wall you have there yeah\nthat's my whiteboard wall this is like\nmy office so\nyeah that's is your so your entire wall\nand your ceiling or whiteboards\nuh so we didn't go as far as the ceiling\nbut\ni thought that would be like a funny way\nof of having\nuh the interior so but\ni didn't go that crazy it's interesting\ni i gotta upgrade my\nmy game can i show you what i have yeah\nyeah\nplease do\noh you're lugging that thing around\nunfortunate\ni just have the old-fashioned one oh\nnice\nyou have such better handwriting this is\nwhat i'm working on it's our\nunderstanding of depression\noh this is very interesting nice\ni like how you break that down i'm i run\ninto a problem with my whiteboard\nbecause if i want to work on more than\none thing at a time i have to erase the\nold thing\nbut um i i think maybe i should take a\npage from your book and just coat the\nwalls with whiteboard because then i can\ncover it with all my things i really\nlove that idea\nit's not it's not that expensive so it's\nconvenient it's convenient\nyeah cool man um and so george is there\nsomething in particular you want to talk\nabout today\num honestly not really i think uh\ndissecting me a little bit and maybe\nlike talking about my life would be\ninteresting\num there's a lot that's happened\nover like the course of my exploration i\nstarted\num in canada london ontario when i was\nlike 19\nand then i'm 30 now and i'm in\ncalifornia and\nit's been a pretty long journey a lot of\nstuff has happened\num and uh i think that\njourney is interesting for a lot of\npeople and so\ni don't really tell it much so yeah so\nthat sounds\nfantastic is there something that you're\nso tell me about your journey\nyeah uh sure um so i was like 19 years\nold\ntwitch didn't exist um it was the start\nof\nstreaming in general there were\nplatforms like live stream\nand x stream and so i was just like a\nkid that wanted to show how good he was\nat playing a certain champion in league\nof legends\nso i started that and i started\nstreaming to like five viewers\nand um that uh\nsomehow evolved from like living in my\nmom's basement\nand uh uh to\nto going to school and doing it um\nand then i dropped out of school to like\npursue\nuh gaming full-time actually was\nstreaming\nand then i built a community for people\nto connect\npeople use websites a lot more back then\num\nand uh we had like the clg website and\nit was actually a community and i love\nbringing people together\nand how did you come up with clg\num so\nwhen i played this game called warcraft\n3 i understand it now as\ngame theory but um\nit's it's making assumptions on what\nyour enemy is going to do\nover and over and over and over in which\nif you\ndidn't make an assumption um you would\nwin some of the time\nright you just kind of like throw out\nthe same\nor like a simple move um\nthe the other the opponent like\noverthinks themselves that's how i like\ni thought of it when i was like 13 or\nsomething and what\nwhat does clg stand for uh counter logic\ngaming\nso the counter logic there is um sort of\nnot falling into the normal assumptions\nof game theory\nyes well\nit is game theory but you know like at\nthe time when i was 13 like\nthat's what i was that's what i was\nthinking in my head okay\nyeah that's awesome man and what did you\nplay in war three\nuh i played human human was my\nmy race yeah water elements also soapy\ndid you go archery\nfirst yeah i did all the time actually\ni also did blood mage too oh that's\nstyling man\nyeah i was the i was like the styler um\ni looked up to all the players that did\nwacky things and thought outside the box\nso that was that was my\ndo you remember this guy akm yes\ni actually talked to akm he comes on\ni've come on his stream every now and\nthen he still like hangs around the\ntwitch community\noh interesting yeah so you're back you\nknow the workout three days\nyeah man this is boomer talk about the\nold days yeah back when it was real\ngaming\nyeah my hero's grumpy grumpy is like my\ngaming idol\nyeah interesting okay he's an amazing\nhuman being\nand um and so so he's\nso it sounds like you started playing\ngames when you were pretty young\nyeah i mean i started playing games when\ni was like two years old i remember like\nplaying dance\nberenstein bears on like uh the computer\nand then my dad got me a diablo before\nit was released\nsomehow and i played that and um\nyeah i just got the bad hookups he had\nthe he had the hookups\nyeah and um what what what was growing\nup like for you in ontario\num ontario is a fairly lar uh well sorry\nontario's\ni don't think of it too much different\nuh than la\ni think the culture of people in canada\nare arguably\na lot more accepting\nbut it was\nit was pretty normal like for here in la\ni don't really notice too much of a\ndifference\nsure um there's some cultural\ndifferences but\nand can you tell me a little bit about\nwhat home life was like for you\num so home life and thank you for uh\nthank you for leading this it's hard to\ntalk about yourself and talk about your\njourney so\noh i appreciate you doing it i noticed\nyou started at 19 and\ni tend to get i just wanted a little bit\nyeah that story no that's great that's\ngreat\num so uh what was the last question\nyeah just tell me what growing up was\nlike for you um oh yeah so\ngrowing up i lived with my grandparents\nand my parents\num and\nmy mom was hurt in an accident so her\nback was out and so\nyou know that's why we kind of like live\ntogether\nand i had a lot of values from my\ngrandparents\nkind of like you know when you have like\none set of parents\ni had like my grandparents and then i\nalso had my parents too\nyep thank you sorry so you're saying\nthat you're it sounds like your\ngrandmother had a\ninjury or you're a mom i'm sorry uh my\nmom had it okay\nyeah so she had a back injury she had a\nback injury so yeah\num i lived with my grandparents and they\nwere they were like\nmy full-time parents and you know my mom\nwasn't able to be my full-time parent\nand my dad was\ndoing whatever he was doing what was he\ndoing\nuh my dad was always like tinkering with\nthings and like finding things to do\nhe i don't think he really had like a\njob that he was consistent with\num he just always\nin canada there was this huge thing when\npeople were\nstealing uh satellite from the us\ni'm not sure with like when satellite tv\nwas a big thing and so he was like on\nthe forefront of like\ntinkering with that and like he was kind\nof like a\nengineer type person you know okay he's\nlike it wasn't like\nabout the business part of it it was\nabout like oh this thing is cool this\nconcept is cool how like\nradios connect how like satellites\nconnect and so\nyeah that's interesting and so do you\nmind if i ask george\ni mean how did your how did your family\nsupport itself\num my mom's a teacher um so she would\nwork and\nshe would work yeah okay my grandparents\nwere fairly well off\nthey came as immigrants and they had\nnothing\nmy grandfather was actually like a\nwar general in greece um\nhe fought against turkey at some point i\ncan't remember the whole history but\nhe he didn't talk he didn't like talking\nabout it he he just liked\nbeing the nice jolly grandfather\ninteresting\nwhich my parents didn't really get i got\nso\ni love that what can you tell me a\nlittle bit more about him\num yeah i mean he was he was a guy\nthat everybody when they talked about\nhim in the past\nhe was like this big scary controlling\ndude that\nwas really really hard on his kids and\num\nnow i think like he\nwhen i knew him uh and when i was\nlike always growing up with him he was\nkind of like this\njolly guy that like puts you in the\nright place if you were going too far\noff but it wasn't like\nin the same lens of like how they\nhe did it to my parents like he would be\nlike george\num i'm gonna drive you down like if i\nwas\nmissing school or skipping school he'd\nhe'd basically drive me down to\nplaces where uh in the city where it was\ndrug ridden full and\nfull of crime filled with crime like\njust like this is what real life is\nif you don't succeed in life this is\nwhere you can fall like the depths of it\nand so like it's important to to know\nthese things and he wasn't trying to\nlike shock me or scare me\nis more like this is reality and\ndon't fall in a trap like thinking this\nis all a game interesting so what i'm\nhearing\nit's quite a powerful image actually\nyeah\nyeah um and what i'm hearing is that\nyou know it sounds like he used to be\ncontrolling but instead what he did with\nyou was sort of\ntried to inform you and then also sort\nof respect your ability to like make a\ndecision so he kind of says like\nhere are your options but it's\nultimately your choice\nand maybe with your parents he sort of\ndidn't do that as much he was like this\nis what you're gonna do\nexactly yeah it sounds like you respect\nhim a lot because of it\noh yeah my grandfather uh was very\nvery like he was a good human being\nand he was very uh i would say he was\nlike very punctual with his behavior i\ndon't know how to describe it he was\nvery consistent\num same with my grandma my grandma is\njust like an incredible human being like\nstrongest woman i've ever met in my life\num\nbut you know that's probably because\ntheir lives were very very hard so they\nhad to be\nwhat what made her so strong what do you\nmean by that um\nshe still like garden for like three\nhours on end\nshe's like in her 80s um her sisters\nlike\n10 mountain goats by themselves in the\nmiddle of nowhere\non on like up large steep mountains\num in greece yeah\nshe would beat me up and like wrestle me\nlike\nfor a significant period of my life and\nshe was jacked\nshe was legitimately strong um\nand like her punctuality was crazy um\nshe never missed uh ever since she came\nto canada\nshe never missed one day working for 40\nyears\nbut it was it was like the spirit of it\nthat she had which was really\ninteresting\nit wasn't punctuality for punctuality's\nsake it was the spirit of\nbeing strong uh\nuh for others that's that's what it was\nabout\nsounds like you love and respect your\ngrandparents a lot oh yeah\nthey're they're they're they're like my\nidols yeah\nyou know this may sound funny to have\nthem well this may sound kind of weird\ngeorge but i'm i'm almost hearing like\nthis is maybe unfair but i'm almost\nhearing like a little bit of a\ni don't know you just speak so highly of\nyour grandparents and i don't quite hear\nthat when you talk about your parents\nwell yeah um my father uh\nmy father divorced my mom when i was\nlike\n13. um and so my mom was a single mother\nand she was very very busy with like\nwork\nand school and and she's kind of like a\nkind woman\nso she um\ndidn't ask my father for child support\nshe was basically like hey let's try to\nkeep this civil\nlike you go do your own thing i'm gonna\nlive my own life\nand i'm gonna try my best to like raise\nthe kids\num and so\ni think mom and dad weren't there as\nmuch\nas grandfather and grandmother and and\nespecially in a value sense and a\nthought sense\ni think when you're not in the motion of\nthings and you're not doing things so\nmuch\nyou have time to reflect on what values\nyou want to carry across\nwho you want to be um and so\ni i think my grandparents were\nlike very cognizant of like who they\nwanted to be and who they wanted me to\nbe\nand who they what values they wanted to\ninstill in me\nand what i'm hearing from you is maybe\nyour parents weren't like that\nno well i think my mom was just like\ntrying to get me\nto get past like not failing right she\nwas she was keeping me above\nwater uh and she she fought to keep me\nabove water\num why were you below water in the first\nplace\num i think this is this is a good\nquestion\num so i was always\naddicted to games uh i love\nthe challenge and the nature of games\nlike school wasn't challenging for me\num schools i would yeah schools for\nactual noobs um\ni i would go into like you know warcraft\nthree i was like top of the\ntop of the us east ladder and you know i\nhad like a lot of people i respected\nthere and\ni had a huge level of respect for my\nopponents\nthat's why my name is hotshot gg it's\nnot because of my initials it's because\ni had like a huge respect for my\nopponents and so\ndeconstructing why i lost was like\nreally important to me\num and deconstructing how i could\nimprove\nis really important to me so you you\ncall that an addiction\ni i called it an addiction because i\ndidn't want to do anything else\nall i wanted to do was get lost in those\nworlds\nand um\nand i couldn't force myself to do\nanything else\nit just wasn't of my interest and maybe\nit isn't an addiction maybe it's just a\npassion um\ni think when we go into that period of\ntime\na lot of people would have called it an\naddiction\nand they would have claimed it wasn't a\ngood addiction\num as i talk of it now i don't think of\nit in addiction any way shape or form\neven if i play a jillion hours a day um\nbut that's like that's the sentiment\ntowards gaming\nright it's it's changed over the past uh\ncouple of years uh or not a couple of\nyears past 10 years\nso much so george help me understand\nwhat was it about\nthe game that was so attractive to you\nand\nwhat was it about real life that was so\nunattractive yeah so\ni wouldn't say real life was\nunattractive i would say school was\nunattractive\na lecturer talking to you um and just\ntelling you to like write notes\nand like in in my opinion the problems\nweren't that difficult they weren't\ni wasn't constantly evolving and\nengaging it was more like i was\nfollowing a process uh\nthat that someone was like hey abc\nand then i go to i come to school and be\nlike a b c it was a very\nboring uninteractive\nand um\nit was more like follow the steps yep\nrather than\num rather than uh\nhere's a sophisticated challenge that we\nlet you explore yourself\nin and we let you challenge at your pace\nat your level\num you know there's some people that are\nstuck in gold their whole life\nright and some people that finally climb\nto platinum and there's people that\nreach the top echelon and inspire like\nmillions across the world right and so\nthe freedom of gaming is that you really\nyou're just put in that leaderboard\nsystem you put into that matchmaking\nsystem and where you can get like\ninstant feedback instant results um\n[Music]\nwhich is a problem itself but yeah\nyeah and and so you say that your mom\nstruggled to keep you above\nwater what do you mean by that uh just\nlike\ngetting through school my teachers\nreally really\nloved me in one sense which was like i\nwas a nice kid\num i was very intelligent\nbut i didn't go to school i missed like\n381 days of school in my\nin my high school years um and\ni stayed home a lot uh and i barely\npassed all right well sorry i passed\nwith like 70s\nuh like high 70s\num how did you stay home so much from\nschool\nuh i actually faked sick which\nif there's karma in the world uh it\nturned into like\nreal sick somehow um but\nuh what i would do is like my i would\nsay my like stomach hurts i can't go\nto school and like my mom bought it a\nlot um\nand um\ngeorge i don't know how we're ever going\nto get to 19\nyeah no i know i mean we can speed it up\nno no i i think my point is that i i\ndidn't mean to say that we should speed\nit up\nwhat i what i meant to say is that i\nthink there's a lot of\nimportant stuff here and if you're if\nyou're okay with it\nmaybe we'll kind of focus on what you're\nsharing yeah\nso i i think like to be candid with you\nright\ni'm very like\ni have thick skin i've had thick skin\nbecause of my time in clg and doing what\ni\ndoing what i did um and i also have the\ni think a strong ability to\nnot be defensive and really to just look\nlook\nto help others and so talking about my\nlife and being very open with\nthings is about helping others right and\nso\nthat's why i'm like dissect me because i\nthink there's a lot of\nthings that i can talk about to help\nbe relatable to a lot of young people\nand also maybe like give them some life\nlessons about\nuh what i've learned and and hopefully\ngive them some guidance in that in that\nregard\nokay i said something provocative no oh\nyeah oh yeah sorry go ahead\ni just feel pretty think about whether i\nwant to say this or not say it\npromise i promise you can say it unless\nunless you think it's gonna\naffect others negatively\nso why does someone fake sick\ni have no idea other than to just like\nescape responsibility\nuh sure so so i think escaping\nresponsibility\nis true i would say overall avoidance\ni think it's an avoidance strategy what\nif i told you that your altruism\ncould also be an avoidance strategy that\nyour thickness\nyeah is just a it's it's a healthier\nmanifestation\nof whatever caused you to fake sick\nit's still a form of avoidance that by\ndevoting yourself to others\nyou can avoid\nlooking at yourself i would say that's\nonly half true\ni think the process of me looking at\nmyself has has been happening\nand i've had a lot of great human beings\nin my life that have helped me get there\nand i went through a lot of bad stuff to\nget out of that um\nand i think my altruism is\ntwofold it's like i'm in a pro i'm in\nthe process of evolving\num so i would\ni would agree and disagree i think maybe\nmy ideals\nare too idealistic and it's not like in\nthis realm of\nof i'm being like fully real with myself\nbut i think it's in the right place\ni might get a little too excited and\njump jump the gun\na little bit but um i know where i'm\ngoing\nand i'm very like i feel it as well as\nthink it\ni can get behind that okay cool yeah\nso uh is it okay if we talk a little bit\nmore about feeling sick\nsure and then you said something about\nkarma what do you mean by that\nyou said that so yeah yeah so i um\nyeah it was like a stomach thing and\nlike i was like yeah i have the stomach\nthing\nand i went to the doctors and they\nactually like were like hey\nyour kid might have ibs i think it was\nirritable syndrome\nyeah um and then like\npotentially acid reflux and that's\nwhat's causing these issues and now i\nhave acid reflux\nand uh it's actually caused some issues\num which is\nyou know it's almost like pinocchio you\nknow\nyeah so how does that work\nuh i don't know i i i think that uh it\ncould just be coincidence\nbut uh i think it's a funny uh it's a\nfunny uh\nthing to think about i don't think we'll\never know or figure out what\nwhy or how that happens but\num coincidence let's call it let's chalk\nit up as that\ni don't think so man really yeah\nwhat's your understanding of what ibs is\nuh ibs uh\nis so i i haven't thought about this\nsince i was a kid\nright but i thought it was\num something to related to like a\nphysical part of your stomach\nnot responding correctly\nthat's like uh somewhat incorrect\nso so so yeah so so the first thing is\nibs is irritable bowel syndrome\nand ibs is one of this new wave of\nphysical diseases\nthat are probably psychosomatic oh\ninteresting right so that's part of the\nreason when when they can't find\nsomething in particular wrong with you\nlike there isn't a cause\nfor your distress but there is a problem\nwith your function so they're also\ncalled functional diseases\nso like like let me just put it this way\nlike so if you think about a functional\ndisease so a functional disease is like\nit's a disease of function but like\nnot a disease of cause so if i have a\ngunshot wound\nthere is a clear cause as to why my\nfunction is impaired\nthere are some diseases where you have\nthe functional impairment like something\nisn't working right but it doesn't\nnecessarily have a causative agent got\nit\nokay it makes sense and and so i i know\nyou kind of\nlaugh about karma and coincidence but i\ni don't think it's really coincidence at\nall that\nyou were probably going through and we\ncan sort of see touches of this right so\nlike\nsure so you were probably going through\na fair amount of psychological distress\naround the age of 13.\nuh yeah i think\nmaybe i i developed like some coping\nmess\ncoping mechanisms of rationalism and\njust being like\nhey it's not logical to feel pain hey\nlike my dad's an idiot like don't feel\nsad about that\nyou know like all that stuff yeah so so\nthis is\nlike this is a neat thing right so the\nwhole principle of the body\nwhen you bury emotion do you know how it\ncomes out\nit forces itself out i'm not sure how\nyeah it forces itself out through the\nbody\nyeah oh interesting\nright so it's got to come out the\notherwise but i mean\nthere i'm sure that there could have\nbeen a lot of common commonality in\nterms of like different things that\ncould have been wrong for me\nright and i just find it curious that it\nwas my stomach\nright like it could you could apply this\nto so many different parts of my body\num but the thing i was like trying to\nuse to fake became\nthe the specific point you know\nyeah so there are physiologic reasons\nfor that\nreally yeah so that's crazy first\nquestion is do you know\nwhat the most common treatment for\nmedication treatment\nfor depression is do you happen to know\nthat\nwhat do we use to treat depression do\nyou know\nuh i don't know actually so like\nantidepressants the most common one is\nsomething called\na selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor\nor an ssri\nokay which essentially increases the\nlevel of serotonin activity in the brain\nso interesting side note which is do you\nknow\nwhere serotonin is the most plentiful in\nyour body\nno idea it's in the brain can you guess\nwhere the second most\nplentiful place for serotonin in the\nbody is\ni'm getting this is the stomach\nabsolutely and you would be correct\nokay so there there's actually a lot of\ngrowing\nevidence that mental health\nand your gi system are intrinsically\nconnected\nin fact there's an entire burgeoning\nfield of science called gut brain\nhealth and this is the wildest\nexperiment that i tell people about\nbecause it's my favorite example\nthey took a group of depressed mice okay\nand you can tell a mouse is depressed in\none of two ways one is you put it\ninto like a novel environment and mice\ntend to be like curious creatures and so\nif it's a healthy mouse\nit'll like get curious and explore\nthings if it's a depressed mouse it'll\njust sit there and not do much\nthat's the more humane version the\nsecond way you assess depression in the\nmouse\nis by putting it in a chamber with water\nwhere there's nothing\nthere's nothing to there's nothing for\nit to like stand on\nand then a healthy mouse will struggle\nto\nswim until it gets tired and kind of\nstarts to drown which is sort of\ninhumane\nwhereas the depressed mouths will give\nup very easily\ngot it they don't actually let them\ndrown they you know pull them out but\nthey see how long they they try um\nso they took a depressed mouse and then\nthey took its poop\nand they transplanted its poop to a\nhealthy mouse\nand what they found is that the\ntransplanted poop\nled to depression interesting\ni would buy that it's weird yeah\nand and so we also know that like\nphysiologically like when you're\nfeeling stress or depression so one of\nthe\none of the nine diagnostic criteria for\ndepression is changes in\nappetite or weight gain\ngot it so nine things that sort of we\nlook for in depression so the stomach\nand the brain are actually\nvery closely linked yeah and i\ni don't think it's much of a i don't\nthink it's karma per se\nbut we know that for example like\nchildren who are distressed will\nexperience stomach aches and that\noftentimes\nstomach aches are sore when we say\npsychological in origin it doesn't mean\nthat there isn't something going on in\nthe stomach\nthere is something going on in the\nstomach it's just that our brain and\nit's\nwild but our brain and our bodies are\nactually connected\nand our psychology and physiology are\nactually connected\nand ibs is a very good example\nof one of these conditions where a lot\nof people will have treatment\nand then it won't really work because\nit's unclear exactly what's wrong\nand then they'll come to me and then\ni'll treat them for a little while or\nibs will go away\ni i i think it's interesting because\nthe the part i think is fascinating\nis when i when i saw it before the\nthe brain and the body being linked and\nbeing able to\ncause harm to each other made sense\nright\nbut it's the specific quality of it\nbeing linked to the\nthe stomach or the mouth like i've read\nsome stuff about like\npotentially like healthy uh\nyou know gums and gum function and just\nlike\nyou know mouth bacteria lead to like\nsomething related to the brain right\nyep and so i thought it was like more\nuniform\nlike if you start having like a lot of\nstress\nand anxiety and all these things that\nyou start to take a\nfull toll on your body but i i it must\nbe more specific than that right\nyeah so you're saying that your global\nbody function is affected equally\nyes yeah so it turns out that that's not\nnecessarily the case and that there is\nspecificity\num you said something else there that i\nwanted to\nmention for a second but i lost track of\nit anyway\nlet's find out um oh yeah you said that\none is able to hurt the other\nyes so that's not how i think about it\ni think about i don't think they hurt\neach other i think they're on the same\nteam\nand what they're doing is transferring\nsome amount of damage from one to the\nother\nokay fair enough i agree that um\nso let's kind of go back to this so\ncan you tell me a little bit about how\nyou felt about your dad divorcing your\nmom\num yeah so i rationalized it\nwhen i was 13 that\nmy dad's just not a great person he's\nnot a great\nfather and he did something bad to my\nmother\nand like i need to\nlike and he wasn't really like he he\nwasn't like that\nemotionally connected to me i guess\nmaybe when i was a kid i had like that\nimage of the app\nlike him giving me diablo and like\nplaying some games with me when i was\nvery young but at a certain point he\njust stopped being there\nand i think if he was there more or i\ndidn't have my grandfather\ni would have been i would have been like\ni think more stricken by that\num but i just rationalized as like hey\nnot a good dude\nmy mom's a good person my grandparents\nare good people i have my family\nso he can go do his own thing\nwhy do you use the word rationalize uh\nbecause it helped me uh\nmake sense of everything\nlike think about it i play warcraft\nthree\nhow i win is not through emotion it's\nthrough pure logic\nright it's like a and so\ni bring the game components into my real\nlife\nthat's what got me to where i am now um\nis is figuring out how to pull that\nthose those learnings and the way my\nbrain works pattern recognition blah\nblah\ninto but i brought it into the i brought\nit into the real world maybe too much\nwhy do you say you brought it into the\nreal world too much uh\nthat's this is later stuff this is like\nwhen you realize\nlike how things are linked in your\nchildhood and how you grow up to\nto like form who you are and stuff\nisn't that what we're talking about uh i\nmean if you\nuh\nyou kind of okay i i guess i guess i i\nthought\nwe were going through like a more\npositive sure chronologically yeah\nyeah let me just george let me ask you\nquestions if you want to connect\nare you in a relationship right now yeah\nhow's that going uh very well\num okay yeah sorry i tend to jump out\naround a little bit\num so i'm gonna go back to this idea of\nrationalization for a second\nsure so if you're rationalizing that\nimplies\nto me like just your the way that you\ntalk about it implies to me that there\nare other things within you\nokay right so if you say\nlike if you say i rationalized it to\nmyself dot dot dot\nwhich implies that you're taking and you\nused a really good analogy with the\ngaming right so like\nyou have emotions and you have rational\nthought and what we're going to do is\npush our emotions to the side and we're\ngoing to focus on the rational\nand then you even did a great great job\nthen you said i took the strategy and\nthen i applied it to my real life\nwhich implies that there were other\nthings that you thought or felt which\nhad\nbeen pushed to the side in favor of\nrationality\nyeah so i can actually really remember\nthat time period\nbecause like i love it for a lot of\nreasons\nbut um and also like it was hard for a\nlot of reasons\num i\nwasn't that strongly connected\nwith my dad like i it didn't\nit didn't hurt i think other things in\nmy life\nlike seeing my parents cry or seeing my\nmom cry\nsee my grandmother cry like going\nthrough hardships with my family\nthat stuff hurt right and i like i\nsucked it up to be\nstrong because that's like kind of like\nthe status quo for the\nmen in the family but as far as my\nconnection to my dad\nit's never really hurt it never really\nhurt\num maybe that's weird but i can like\nfirmly remember that\nyeah okay i i think i i can get behind\nthat because you seem very confident\nthat\nyour dad is sort of sounding like just\nanother dude he's just another dude\nhe's he's just another dude i mean he\nwasn't around much right as i\nexplained earlier um\nhe brought me diablo which is my\nfavorite memory right\nuh but other than that it's kind of like\nblank\nyeah right do you remember feeling a\nparticular way not so much about him\njust being another dude but the fact\nthat you\ngrew up with just another dude for a dad\ninstead of a real dad\num my grandfather was like my real dad\nfor for me\nand so like if i didn't have my\ngrandfather i'd probably be\nmore of a mess but he was he was there\nfor me all the time\nokay so i lived with him a lot yeah\ni mean i i think you yeah you talk about\nhim\nwith a lot of respect and love and it\nsounds like he really was there for you\nand did all the things that a dad\nshould do like you know teach\nyou take the time to like teach you\nthings and show you things\nand also like respect you enough to kind\nof make your own decisions have the\nfaith in you that you're going to make\nthe right ones\num it sounds like he was an awesome\nperson also we're just an awesome person\nyep and you're talking you you use the\npast tense when you talk about your\ngrandfather in the present tense when\nyou talk about your grandmother\nyeah my grandfather passed away uh\nwhile i was in the us um he\nthis is where we're jumping a little bit\nbut i'm fine because i think you want to\ndo that\num i was\nillegally in the u.s um\nbecause the visa situations were hard at\nthe start of the esports\nlike my visa was one of the first\nesports visas ever\nand i was operating clg and what\nhappened was if i went back to the u.s\ni couldn't continue clg and i couldn't\ncontinue just gaming in general and he\npassed away while we were\nwhile i was in u.s and he was in canada\nand he told me\nto like i was like hey i want to come\nback\nhe said don't come back like stay\nin the u.s like i love you\nyou don't have to do this like grandma\nknows\nlike just stay there um i'm gonna be\nfine\nand obviously he wasn't fine but uh\nthat was super hard for me\nyeah was that like not going back\num\ni knew what he was trying to say\num i knew he was like be strong george\nlike i i know what mission i put you on\nright i know who i wanted you to be like\nkeep doing it like i'm proud of you\nthat's what he\nthat's what he was saying and like i\nthink\nhe was also trying to save me some like\nemotional damage too\nof well maybe like emotional relief with\neverybody\ni i like i get really sad when my\ngrandma gets sad and so like being there\nwith everybody\nprobably would have uh uh\nprobably would have been a huge burden\nwhile trying to like manage clg\nrun clg and play on the team like i was\njust\nso overwhelmed with so many things at\nthat time\nsounds like he was looking out for you\nyeah he was\nalways even towards the end\nput you first mm-hmm\nsounds\ni can also see how altruism isn't just a\ndefense mechanism for you because i\nthink you learned\ni'm very sure i learned it yeah\nsounds like you miss him a lot of course\nwe all do yeah\nwhat are you feeling right now\ni'm sad um very sad like i\nkind of feel like i want to cry but\ni'm stopping myself because\none i don't want to cry on stream\nand two\nthat's actually probably the right thing\nto do\nbased on what i want to do um\ni have a really\nand and i have a really uh this is\nsorry my thoughts are getting confused\nmy feelings right now um\ni think a lot of the problems that\npeople\nhave are they're not able they're not\nable to connect with emotions\nlike people aren't resonating with their\ntrue self and their truths\ntheir true feelings and so\npart of\nme accepting to come here is to\nreally really\nshow that i'm like a human being and\nthat we're all human beings\nright and i think\nwe forget that very often um\nand i'm sure that you're aware of that\nthat paradigm just being very true in\nthis space\nit seems to me like the emotions are\neven more powerful as you say that\nyes of course why\ni mean\nyou have to really like hone in on some\nof the stuff that's happened\num and some of the people that have come\non here right\ni have a lot of respect for you um\n[Music]\nbecause you're able to\nget people to a place where they're\nhonest to help others\nthat's that's what i see you as um\nand so um\nyou know for reckful for a lot of\ndifferent people\nand influencers streamers whatever you\nwant to call them\num it's really hard even people\nthat play sports um to commit to like\na journey to be in front of\nmedia and others it's\nvery hard there's a huge cost associated\nto it\nthat we all just shove under\nwhat's that cost it's our like humanity\nreally is you feel like you've\nsacrificed that\noh for sure i sacrificed that a lot\num and i see it doesn't matter what part\nof success that you go to\nit's prevalent everywhere it's like a\ndisease like\neverywhere it doesn't matter if it's\nif if you're you know\nat the bottom of a company if you're at\nthe top of a company\nit doesn't matter if you're just like\nsomeone that\nyou know is just playing games that uh\nand and and are part of these\ncommunities like it's everywhere\num so yeah\nwe're losing our humanity we're losing\nour humanity\ncan i think for a second sure\ni'm gonna lighten the mood a touch\nbecause you've told me that you don't\nwant to cry so\ni think that that was a defense\nmechanism\nnot wanting to cry if i want my father\nto say that\ni came here on a mission in which is to\ntalk about things to help\nthe people and if you think honestly\nthink\nthat i can help other people by talking\nabout this\nthose things that i'm okay talking about\nthem why do you need to help other\npeople\nbecause it's important to me that people\ndon't suffer the same way i did and\nthat's important to me\n[ __ ] where'd i begin dude uh\ni didn't know i had feelings i've\nrationalized that i had feelings\nup until like a year and a half ago\nand then the start of even recognizing\nthat i had feelings\nwas like i didn't know what the [ __ ] was\ngoing on\nthat's basically what it was what\nhappened a year and a half ago\nuh\num god damn okay i\ni i would say that the biggest thing and\ni i hate to talk about this\nthis is where we get a little\ni went to my first rave\nuh\ni don't like talking about this because\ni think you know where it goes\nand i think it's a very uh\nmaybe maybe no okay okay fine i'll just\ntalk about it\ni took a drug\nand i used to s okay no i should talk\nabout this\n[ __ ] um\ni took a drug and then in the moment\ni started feeling and then i recognized\nhow other people would feel and i\nrecognized\nwhat that felt like um\nand then i've tried to like\nunderstand how i felt and what the\ndifferences of like how i was feeling at\nthe time versus how i normally am\ntry to understand how i can get there\nlike mentally\nspiritually like physically without the\nneed of that\num but that was like the catalyst\nto like really push me in that way and\nwhat did you realize about\nhow other people felt\num\nthat they were suffering a lot of people\nwere suffering\nand a lot of people were able to have\nfun and enjoy the company of each other\num just like everything that has to do\nwith emotions\nlike to be able to like really feel what\nit's like to be that other person\num i'm not like\nyou know i don't fully understand it to\nthis day right like i'm still learning\num but yeah i get it\ndid you feel somehow responsible for\ntheir suffering\nno i don't i think\ni don't feel responsible for\nfor like the suffering of those around\nme\num i think there is a level of\nresponsibility i have to like the gaming\ncommunity\nbecause i was like a leader in it i was\na part of it\nand um but like if you ask me like am i\nresponsible for everybody that suffers\naround me i'd say no\ndo you feel responsible for anyone who\nsuffers around you\num no i think i i think i'm\ni think i'm there to help people that\nare trying to listen\ni i like you can't help someone that\ndoesn't want to help themselves\nright so i think bearing that\nresponsibility\nis a little too much um\ndo you help yourself yeah\ni do i do help myself a lot okay um\nbut yeah this is this is like very\ncomplex and it's just like you know it's\na lot\num but what's feel free to ask questions\num\nso the way my brain works is like i\nthink of\n50 things at once and how they're all\ninterconnected\num and so there's like\nit's really hard for me to speak out\nloud i usually think first and then\nspeak\nbut when thoughts get very complicated\nin my head\nit really screws up my communication\nso do you feel like you're not\ncommunicating well right now\num i have no idea\ni would say my communication is like\ngenerally not that great\nuh but yeah\ni don't know\ncan i think for a second sure go ahead\n[Music]\nso i'm a little confused\nsure um and i i don't think it's because\nyou're communicating poorly i think it's\njust\ni understood where we were and i sort of\nunderstand where we are now\ni don't really understand how we got\nfrom a to b because something changed\nvery rapidly we were talking about your\ngrandfather\nunderstandable that you have emotions\nthere\nand then we started talking about like\nthe hurt of the world and that seemed to\nevoke even more emotion\nyes and and i got the sense that\ni almost feel like i imagine you know\nthey're\ni'm from texas and in texas you know\nthey're\nlike oil fields and so you'd have a\nfarmer that would be digging a ditch\nand they'd they'd hit something and then\noil would start spurting out of the\nground and it's sort of like wait where\ndid that come from\nclearly something there clearly\nsomething important\nnot what i expected i was looking for a\npotato\nand i found one yeah yeah and so so\ni'm kind of trying to understand a\nlittle bit i'm just kind of i'm sharing\nwith you what i'm processing right now\nwhich is sort of like where to go from\nhere and what's useful\nand um because i understood where we\nwere\ni was sort of like i mean i wouldn't\nquite say leading but like i\nkind of had a couple of hypotheses i'll\nall\nmaybe help you uh and just speak out\nloud um\nokay fundamentally like\ni feel obligated\nto try to make the world a better place\nand because i see the human cost\nof everything that we're doing uh within\nour country\nuh within with our within my friend\ngroups\njust around the world i consume just\nlike a huge\namount of information right of so many\ndifferent fields\nright uh and i i hit the surface level\nof all them\nbut i see them connect right and and\nand i also ask so many different people\nlike the question why and i asked it so\nmany different\nways to try to understand uh\nunderstand what's going on in the world\nand\ni i'm stopping asking why\nand i finally am like building a\nconclusion\nand from that conclusion\n[Music]\ni've found some sort of motivation to\nreach deeper into myself\nto be a different kind of person um\nand try to help other people\nand i'm going through great lengths of\nlike really challenging myself\nlike i have all the money i could\npossibly\nwant like i have a house i have good\nfriends\ni have very limited i have\nvery low responsibility right now like\nbut\ni think i found a purpose in life that i\nreally care about\num and i'm just chasing that purpose\nright now\nwhat do you feel when you say that\num\nfeels good\nyou know it seems like like you're on\nthe verge of tears but i get the sense\nof a powerful sort of like\nresolve you know i i'm getting the\nvalence of emotion as being positive and\nsometimes what i'm i'm sort of getting\nis that you're not\nit just has a physiologic effect right\nthis is what we were talking about\nfor a while is that it just has an\neffect on your body when you\nthink certain thoughts and you feel that\npurpose and your body just has to\nlike you see how some of the weight of\nwhat's on\nin your mental space has to be carried\nby your body\nyes and your body's just carrying it as\nbest as it can which is sort of like\nphysical emotional expression\nyeah what was the conclusion you came to\num the conclusion is that\neverybody is suffering more and more\nwe're on a train of\nlike critical malfunction\nand it's getting worse no one's\nrecognizing\nthe problem um the problem\nthere being like we are disconnected\nfrom our emotions\nwe are losing our humanity and\nwe're losing the ability to help each\nother\nuh for this needless pursuit of wanting\nmore and more and more\nand also i think they're underlying to\nall that\nis we use a lot of rationale\nand ideas to stop ourselves from\nadmitting the truth\nor even searching for the truth um what\ni see\nis it doesn't matter how high you climb\nbillionaires millionaires i've talked to\nthem\neverybody is building this layer of\nrationale\non why they do things and\nno one's searching to see if that's like\nthe truth right if if their version of\nreality is even\nlike congruent with with what's\nhappening in the world with other\npeople's experiences with other people's\nemotions\num i think there's some people that are\ndoing it but\nyeah you know i i think the challenge\nwhen i listen to you\nis that sure you know earlier i kind of\nmentioned\ni don't know if your altruism is like a\nmanifestation of avoidance as well and\nyou kind of said i agree and disagree\nso once again i don't i don't think this\nis mutually exclusive but i don't know\nif what you just said\nis you know a quite like a tarma for the\nfor life or if it's the mother lode of\nall projective identification\nyeah i don't\ni would have to be\ni can't i can't know like right like i\nbecause just the way that you're\ndescribing things you sound like you're\ntalking about yourself\nyes i know i know i know but uh\nthat's how i help uh\nuh linking it to myself\nis just a way of\nhelping me articulate it\nif i like think in my head i think about\nall the recent conversations\nof other people where we just dig under\nthe surface a little bit\nand just like really connect with each\nother\nand i just see all of them\nhaving a lot of similarity in pain\nand experiences\nwhat about your own pain\nwhat do you do what do you mean what do\nyou do with your pain\nuh i share it with other people um\ni ask them to walk me through like how\ni'm feeling\nuh i try to talk talk with them to\nare you in pain george\nno i mean like generally speaking\ni would say like my general state is a\nlittle bit stressed\num you seem to be in intense pain to me\nreally yeah when you talk about these\nthings\nokay sorry this is like i think our\ncommunication\nis falling apart a little bit um\nthis is where i think i become a bad\ncommunicator\nuh and oh god brian would be so\ni have a roommate named brian and he's\nprobably like one of the\ngreatest people i've ever met in my life\num\nand\nhe's helped me become\na better person and he like through\na lot of communication that we have with\neach other\ni will i will say things that don't line\nup with\nwho i am very frequently and what i\nthink\nand i communicate like the wrong\nsentiment and\nvery frequently he would say like george\ni've known you for like\na year i know that's not what you're\nsaying uh\nand then he would like correct my\ni'm just i'm having a really hard time\ncommunicating right now i i don't know\nhow to do i think you're doing\na great job communicating oh thank you\nso that makes me feel better i have a\ncouple of counterpoints so when i say i\nthink\ni see a lot of pain right now that's not\nme misinterpreting it's my attempt at\nclarifying to make sure that we're on\nthe same page\nbecause communicate communication\nproblems are inevitable\nright so when you talk about the\nsuffering of the world and how we're\nlosing humanity\ni almost see in you a manifestation\nof that pain when you talk about it you\ntalk\nso deeply and with such conviction\nthat it hurts you to see this happening\nall around you\ncorrect okay i'm on the same page there\ni\ni was misinterpreting like\nthe pain as being like always\npain like george you're like always in\nthe state of pain\nokay yeah i don't know why i thought\nthere or like where i got there\ni i i couldn't make the connection i\nmean you hurt\nman like when you talk about it like i\nsee hurt\nin you of course yeah of course\ni see others suffering and i think about\nhow much i was suffering and\ni just want i did\ni want to help people like i i don't\nknow tell me about your suffering\num oh like this is maybe why\nchronological order would have helped\nokay\ni went through a period\nwhere\ni went down what i would call a dark\npath\num and\ni was acting with the sense of just like\nthis is how everybody does it this is\nhow\npeople should do it um\n[Music]\nand this is just the way things are\nand when operating in\nesports\na lot of the early days were very\nrough like cheating\nlying manipulating those\nqualities are still ever present and\nmaybe even worse in esports now\nand those values conflicted\nwith the ideals of\nthe people that i love and\nhave cared for or have have cared for me\nmy entire life and when i got into\nesports and i got into business\ni suffered so much pain by following\nthose ideals\nthat i shoved them all away\nand i just started operating like\neverybody else\nso here's what i'm hearing\nthe way you behaved in esports would\nhave\nwould be something that your grandfather\nwas ashamed of\nno i don't think he would\nbe ashamed of it um\n[Music]\nhe would be sad\nright because i think he's someone that\nfought for a better world for us to live\nin right\nbut you know someone that has lived in\nwar\nknows the importance of\nnot going back there right and\nfor me\nwhat's happening all around and this is\nwhat i feel\nis we're almost like at war with each\nother\nuh\nand the humanity and being nice to each\nother\nand being a thoughtful person and trying\nto help each other is\nisn't what's happening like\nit's it's like we're always at war\num and so i don't think he would be\nashamed of me\ni think he would just be sad that like\nthe world is\nin in my view like not changing we're\nnot\ntrying to build a better future i think\nthat's\nthe part of him that would be sad\nhow do you feel about being a\nparticipant of that war\nbecause it sounds like that's what you\ndid\nyeah uh\ni\nfeel responsible\nbut i don't put\nthe weight of it all on me\ni i recognize\nthat i'm inherently a good person or i\ntry to be a good person\nbut man it's [ __ ] hard it's really\n[ __ ] hard\ni can't tell you like if you're trying\nto be a good person\nand everybody else is\nreally trying to look after themselves\nand be selfish\nand they start hurting you they start\nbackstabbing you they start breaking\nyour trust\nyou have two choices you either get the\n[ __ ] out\nor you survive that's it\nand to survive you start to fall into\nthe system\nthat's just how it is\nso you know george i'm hearing something\nkind of interesting\nwhich is that like sure underneath all\nof your statements\ni think guilt would fit well\nbut i've i've asked you i've asked you\nseveral times kind of nudging around\nguilt yeah but you seem to block it\nyou don't seem to agree when i sort of\ntoss out guilt\nlike so for example i think yeah yeah so\ni i feel like i'm guilty for jumping on\nthe train\nright but i'm not gonna beat myself\nup over uh\nit entirely because\ni don't know how else to say it\nthere were so many [ __ ] people\nthat were trying to push me on that\n[ __ ] train\nand i i feel like an amount of guilt\nright but\nthis is where i think it's a huge [ __ ]\nit's it's a huge\nproblem so\nyou know what i mean like uh george so\nyeah so i i can't tell\nif you're really far forward or really\nstuck\ncan i share with you my dilemma yes\nplease i i\ncan't tell if you're halfway to\nenlightenment or\non stage zero so let me explain to you\nso when we talk about\nguilt what do you respond with\nyou say yeah i feel some guilt\nbut a lot of people were trying to push\nme\nit was the environment i was in it\nwasn't my fault\nthat's what you say does that make sense\nyes so what do we call that when someone\nsays\ni did something bad but it wasn't my\nfault what's what do we say that that\nperson is doing absolving response of\nresponsibility through what\nthrough deflection through\nrationalization\nthrough justification right got it okay\nit was the world\nit was the world we lived in it's what\neveryone did\neither i could fail or i could play the\ngame it's rationalizing\nokay it's what you do\nyeah right that's your archmage with\nyour water elemental every game you know\nyour archmage\nget your water elemental it's the\nstrategy that you use\nand you have okay\ni think and maybe this is like helpful\nas\na connector i've thought about this a\nlot\nright and so i can tell you've thought\nabout it a lot\nokay so i\ni didn't do like okay so\nif you're talking about esports as an\nindustry okay\ni think it's clg\ni tried my best to\nbe a good person that and i don't think\ni did a whole lot of\nwrong okay so like i think i did\ni i think i think i tried to do\nthe best i could\nand\ni\n[Music]\ni think i always challenged myself\nto try to be a good person in all this\nand then something\nbad happened\nand then i jumped out of the way i\njumped like i got away from esports\nentirely\nand i think when i when i talk about my\ninter when if you were to talk to me\nabout my interpersonal relationships\nand how business manifested in them and\nthe pain that caused\ni would feel infinite guilt\ni would feel so much guilt and i do feel\nso much guilt\nbut\nwhen it comes to esports\ni don't feel as guilty i don't know how\nto just i don't know how else to\ndescribe it yeah\nyeah so george we've got a couple of\noptions okay\nsure so first of all um\ni just want to commend you for bringing\na hundred percent\ntoday thanks i i can see that you're\nbringing everything you've got\nand and we're getting the synthesis\nessence and results of all of your\nreflection all of your exploration all\nof your investigation\nand i think i'm i'm grateful that you're\nsharing all of this with us\nthank you a couple of thoughts that i\nhave is like we have to pick a direction\nokay so one is you know i find myself\nbeing curious about\nyou're kind of talking in in in vague\nterms like you said something happened\nand then i jumped out of the way\nso that seems emotionally charged to me\ni don't know if we're steering clear of\nthat because of drama and things like\nthat you don't want to disclose that\nor if you're just trying to sketch in\nbroad strokes and i should ask more\nyeah this is hard i'll just i'll just\nlike be outright\num\naround 2015.\n[Music]\num\nsomething how uh [ __ ] i'm okay\ngeorge yeah\ni was giving you two options and we\ndon't have to talk about that if you\ndon't want to\ni was experienced it's it's i i i want\nto talk about it because i\ni haven't really got another like real\nserious opinion on this\nit's just kind of like it just goes\nunder the bridge\nand i think that this is like something\nthat has i carry with me today\nsomething i'm really passionate about\nand it kind of hurts me to see\num\nwhich is when narratives can get\nout of control truth doesn't matter\nanymore\nit's about the messaging\nit's about what you can convince people\nand the winner writes history in a sense\nand for me there was a time in esports\nand in the part the part of this is like\ni forgiven these people\nfor doing this to me and causing me like\na lot of pain i spent like a year and a\nhalf in isolation\nlike pretty much just by myself in an\napartment\nin the dark because of how much pain i\nwent through\nand i've like forgiven these people\nif they ask for your forgiveness\nno\nlong story short\nmaybe long story short it's not i'm\nreally sensitive about this\nuh okay there was a point\nin history clg history where\nsomeone on clg had a lot of credibility\nin a false narrative\nabout their character\nand what ended up happening is that\nperson did\nthey betrayed many people within clg\nthey utterly betrayed me\nthey use their social leverage\nto change the conversation and narrative\nwhen i was trying\nto do the right thing\nand what happened was\nmillions of people started\nto say things about me\nbelieve things about me believe things\nabout\neverything that happened everything that\nwas happening that was completely\nuntrue and i tried to stop it\ni tried to tell\nthe reality of the situation i had\npeople that were like\ngeorge i've got your back like let's\ntell the truth together\njust jump out of the way\nand it affected my relationships\nit reflected it affected clg\nand it ultimately affected me\nso bad that i can't begin to describe\nhow much i hurt\nand you know they just\ngot away with it and\nthere's nothing i could do about it\nthere's really nothing good\nit's so hard so hard when you try to be\na good person\nthere's so many people doing bad things\nand you just have to let it go\nuh\nthe reasons people give you is so [ __ ]\nup\nthat person had more social capital than\nyou\nthat person's more well-liked than you\nthat person's more tactical than you\nno one cares about being a good person\nno one cares about helping each other\nthey're all out there just to [ __ ]\nbig buddy\nand get things for themselves\nit is so obviously apparent\nand we just walk through accepting it\nso [ __ ] dude\nit's really really [ __ ] up\nand it's not just in esports it's like\neverywhere\ngeorge yeah go ahead\nthe part of me that was like struggling\nis\ni feel this with myself right\nand i extrapolate that\nright and i see it\nhappening in like different aspects of\nlife right it's not just esports\nthe function of\ntrying to subvert people's feelings\ntheir emotions how we treat them\nfor money\nit's [ __ ] up dude i don't know how\nelse to say it\n[Music]\ni'm gonna just collect my thoughts\nbecause i i think george you just shared\nso much yeah i know i wanna\ni i appreciate it it was powerful man\ni'm just trying to think about\nhow to meet you where you're at sure\ni can pull myself back um you don't need\nto do that\ni prefer that i rise to your level as\nopposed to you pull back\nfair enough\nall right so i'm gonna just start you\nneed a minute\nno i'm good okay i'm gonna start talking\nsure chances are i'm i'm gonna be wrong\nokay i hope this will help you but i\ndon't know if you're gonna like to hear\nit\nokay so\ngeorge sometimes when people try to go\nout and fix the world\nit doesn't come from the world it comes\nfrom them\nand in fact i would argue that most\npeople who try to go out and fix the\nworld\nit's rooted in them\ncan you repeat that again yeah so most\npeople who go out there\nfix the world yeah it's not doesn't\nactually come from the world it comes\nfrom them so like this is just\nyou know really simple like if you think\nabout\num you know why do people\nadopt particular causes it's because the\ncause is near and dear to their heart\nright i don't hear you trying to save\nthe rainforests\nmaybe you are but like there's something\nabout\nthe suffering of the world in the loss\nof our humanity that hits home with you\nso overall like some time ago i said i\ncan't tell if this is the mother lode of\nprojection\nand i'm going to go ahead and lean into\nthat a little bit\nokay because i i think that the first\nthing that you've got to do george\nis not fix the world it's to heal\nyourself\nbecause you are really really hurt man\nand i've tried to like ask you in a\ncouple of ways and i think that you have\nbeen on a journey of a lot of genuine\ngrowth\nbut i think that you you're getting\ntripped up with this beautiful thing\nthat you just said\nyou feel pain and then you extrapolate\nit out to other people's pain\nand so i think the reason that you half\nagree and half disagree and we're like\nwe're uh a hundred percent together\nfifty percent of the time\nin this conversation that's just been\nthe way that i felt it's like we're\na hundred percent aligned except like\nsuddenly like something\nwe're like you're like no sort of i sort\nof agree with you but like here's this\nother piece\nand i think what you're doing just this\nwhole thing is like you start with a\nfeeling you start with a personal\nexperience and then you extrapolate it\nand by that extrapolation you move away\nfrom yourself and towards the outside\nworld\ntowards rationality towards all these\nother things making the world a better\nplace which has this emotional root\nbut fundamentally at the end of the day\nyou're moving away from yourself\nin order to fix the world's problems\nwhich i think is a noble thing in bro\ni'm behind you\ni appreciate it i think we're actually\nfighting the same battle\nwe're on the same team i'm grateful you\ncame here all that stuff is true\nand i think it's like not you're leaving\nsomething about yourself incomplete\nand you've made a lot of progress\nbecause you can sort of own some of the\nyou've like discovered your feelings\nyou've discovered connection\nyou know it sounds like you've really\nworked on yourself you went through a\ndark\nyou know trial of your life\nand i i don't think any of that is false\nor anything i don't think this is really\nthe mother lode of projection i don't\nthink this is all like baked in [ __ ]\nwhat it feels to me is more than\nanything else incomplete\nand i think it could be that yeah yeah\nand so i think like let's just start\nwith this idea of guilt so like\nwhy are you so respon why are you so\nso you know the the biggest\nadvocates against\nyou know drunk driving can sometimes be\nthe people themselves who drove drunk\nright and they say that like yeah yeah\nof course\nand so there's a part of me that that\nstill thinks that like you know i ask\nyou like a couple times do you feel\nresponsible for other\npeople's suffering like i asked you like\nearly on because i was sniffing\nwhat i'm sniffing from you more than\nanything else is a profound sense of\nguilt\nand it's some of these things like when\ni ask you would your grandfather be\nashamed of you\ni think that you try to be a good person\nwhich in turn makes it so much more\ndevastating\nwhen you find yourself giving in to\ntemptation\nfor sure i would expect self-loathing\nfrom you\nself-loathing like hate the person i\nam yeah absolutely\nbecause you try to be a good person and\nyou weren't for a time\nyes and i\nexperienced amount of self-loathing\nalready\nyeah and so\ni'm less about experiencing more\nself-loathing\nand more about growing\nunderstanding myself understanding\npeople\nyep yeah i i'm with you so i i just\nthink that based on your statements and\ni don't think that like i said i don't\nthink there's all like\nyou know you're not like you don't have\nany super narcissistic defense\nmechanisms or anything like that\nokay but um i'm trolling\nbut yeah i know i know so uh but\nat the same time i do feel like\nsomething about this feels incomplete to\nme\nso it's clear to me that you've really\nexplored yourself i think the way that\nyou know you answer these questions\nabout your grandfathers you're like\nhe wouldn't be ashamed he would be sad\nand if you were more in the\nself-loathing camp\nthen you would you would see shame for\nhim as opposed to sadness\ndoes that make sense as you come to\nprocess and accept some of your mistakes\nand recognize that it's not entirely\nyour fault\nyou've forgiven yourself some i think\nyou sort of like move into sadness and\naway from shame and self-blame\nfine but something about all of this\nstuff\nand you even said it a little bit in the\nmiddle is that you've looked around at\nthe outside world and you've\ninvestigated\nand then you realize you need to grow in\nas a person and then like kind of make\nthe world sort of a better place but\nwhat i see from you overwhelmingly is\nstill a lot of stuff\ncoming from you i don't think you're\ndone with yourself yet and i don't think\nyou're ready to fix the outside world\ni think what you've got to do is focus\non fixing yourself\nmore you're just getting started or\nyou're halfway there\nyeah i think that that you know\nthat i can agree with um\n[Music]\ni guess i'm having the hard a hard time\nunderstanding\nlike what the pathway is to that or even\nlike\nacknowledging i need like a step to\nacknowledge\nbecause because this is your\ninterpretation\nof talking to me for x amount of time\nright there's so much history and\nexperience and stuff\nthat if you knew me you'd be able to\nmake like oh okay i get it\nright and so we're jumping a huge amount\nof\nwe're building a huge amount of\nassumptions here right\nand so i'm trying to follow your your\npath\nbut i don't know\ni don't know this next leap you're\ntrying to make me\nyeah i can't see it fine totally fair so\nthat's i'm not done so maybe i can i can\nelusive okay sorry first question is\nhave you seen a therapist\nyes do you see one now yes\nis that helpful yes\ngreat so i think that's fantastic\nand i think you should continue doing\nthat okay\nmy point so so that's one thing the\nsecond thing is that i think that\nif if you're looking for a next step to\nfocus\nmore on yourself i think it's\nbeautifully you illustrated a\nbeautifully i feel this guilt because\nyou're not\nyou're not blind to yourself or anything\nlike that you actually understand your\ninner parts\nsomewhat i think you just do this thing\nwhere you like\nyou you quickly extrapolate and you move\noutside of yourself and into the rest of\nthe world\ninto conversations with other people\ninto gaining information\nand instead i think what you need to do\nis kind of like what you\ndid just now is sort of like sit with\nsome of these\nlike thoughts and feelings and really\nlike think about that for a second\nbecause what i found from you is is what\ni saw what you showed us\nis a wound that is still open and raw\nyes that that wound\nright is probably the only wound\nthat i have and i recognize that wound i\nknow it's there\ni feel it every day right i\n[Music]\nyou're like whoa what's going on yeah\nyeah you're damn right you feel it every\nday yeah\nand i and the the problem\nwith the wound right\nis that\ni\npart of that like closing that wound for\nme\nright is\n[Music]\nnot going out and going back\ninto time to like try to\nyou know val like try to like seek\njustice for it\nright the uh george george george\nbuddy here's what i think okay filled\nwith assumptions\nhouse of cards feel free to knock what\ni'm about to say just\nknock it over with a hammer do it you're\ntrying to fix that wound by fixing the\nentire [ __ ] world\nbecause it's a wound that you live with\nevery single day\nand it hurts buddy and you see\nsomething of the suffering out there\nbut i don't understand why you would go\nabout fixing the world\nif you live with a gaping open wound on\na daily basis that hurts you on a daily\nbasis\noh uh i mean okay so\nthere is and maybe this is just like a\nlearned behavior\nbut i can still function\nwhile hurting of course you can\nright and i can still function up\nso george why is it important why is it\nimportant to\nto to fix this wound this is exactly why\nyou haven't fixed it\nbecause you can function in spite of it\nbut just because you can function in\nspite of it just because you can keep\ngoing doesn't mean that you don't owe it\nto yourself\nand and don't deserve a life where this\ngaping wound\nis like bleeding all the time okay it's\nnot about\nfunction it's about getting better\nthough right it's either okay do you\nwant me to like just\nfully on focus like resolve myself talk\nto therapists only about this wound\nand not do anything else in my life no\nwhere are you getting that black and\nwhiteness\num have i said to you that you should\nstop everything that you're doing in\nyour life and focus only on this\nwell well i do focus on the wound that's\nwhat i i don't understand\nlike if i'm focusing on the wound and\ni'm passionate about helping others\nand also we i haven't even mentioned it\ni want to build a game at some point\nright cool um awesome but uh\nthat like i could i don't i guess i\ndon't understand\nwhat you're what the action point of\nthis is i'm with you\nand i'll get to it in a second so the\nfirst thing is is that just the\nacknowledgement that like you have this\nwound\nright that you carry with you on a\nday-to-day basis and i acknowledge that\nyep and what i'm saying i'm not saying\nthat you can't try to help other people\nbut what i'm saying is that\nyou shared with us your noble quest\nwhich is like a noble one which is like\nto you know help people who suffer in\nthe world\nbut i think that that comes ultimately\nfrom you\nright like it it's like and i think that\nyou should focus on\nhelping yourself which i know you do\nbecause we've asked you right so this\nonce again i'm not saying you're not\ndoing it i think you're doing it like\nhalfway you're seeing a therapist and\nthat's like\nthe bread and butter right answer i\nthink practically\nwhat that means is i i have a direction\nfor exploration for you\nokay i've gotten answers yeah so you say\nclosing that wound means seeking justice\nwhat did you say i thought you said\nsomething like that\nuh or okay\ni think like justice is a part of it i\nalso think like just learning to like\nlove\nother people and forgive other people\nlike that's\npart of it too right um do you hate\nno did you used to hate\nno there's your [ __ ] problem\nhey why would i want to hate someone\nbecause they hurt you bro because they\nstabbed you in the back\nand if you're telling me that you've\nnever experienced hate\nafter all of these things that's the\nemotion you're missing\ni\nmissing hate\nthe way i i think about that\nis why would i want\nto breed more hate you're not\nreading more yeah okay so so you respond\nto it logically right so that's the\nfirst thing\ni'm not telling you to breed hate\nbut the problem is you can't let go of\nsomething unless you realize you're\nholding on to it\ni'm not telling you to go out and be\nmean to people what i'm telling you is\nthere's nothing about the outside world\ni don't think it's good to act dominate\nbut i think it's good to recognize that\nit's there\nand to learn to let go but what i'm\nhearing is that you've forgiven people\nwhich because you're trying to be a good\nperson and in doing so you take a small\ncorner of yourself and you shove it to\nthe side\nthis is what i'm telling you man you're\nlike you're like a 50 there\nbut there's this whole other 50 and it\nboggles my mind i don't know i don't\nknow what the [ __ ] happened with clg\nbut it sounds traumatic and terrible\nand generally speaking when things like\nthat happen to people we experience a\nwhole range of emotions\npain suffering guilt hatred and\nanger are in there bro\nyeah i i definitely think i was angry\nbut i don't i try not\nto hate people uh\nyes i i i would say like if i were to\nreally speak\nlike how i'm feeling right now yeah i\nfeel\nvery misunderstood yep\nand i don't know why that is\nyeah so they're a couple great i'm so\nhappy you shared that\nso here are the reasons that i think you\nfeel misunderstood\ni think i'm tossing something out to you\nwhich does not\nfit that's why you feel misunderstood\nright what i'm saying and your\nunderstanding of things are clashing\nof course you feel misunderstood i think\nit's a completely normal way to feel\nso here's the next step okay\ni'm glad i mean i think it's normal and\ni don't mean to invalidate you but what\ni'm saying is that\nthat i think that there's a blind spot\nin your vision\ni would not like say that there isn't\nright so then let me ask you something\nwhen you point out a blind spot sure\nwhen you point out a blind spot in\nsomeone's vision\nhow would they feel um\n[Music]\nfirst they would get defensive usually\nokay uh\nand then they would have a hard time\ncomprehending it\nmisunderstood misunderstood\nand then they would try to get to the\npoint that they understand it by\nasking more questions or\nthey would try to explain themselves\nfurther so that\nthey remove the blind spot i'm sorry it\nreinforced the blind spot right\neither you're going to try to understand\nmy perspective or you're going to\nconvince me of your perspective\neither one fear okay you're going to try\nit's just an issue of whether i'm\ngetting on your page or you're getting\non my page\ngot it but i think i think my goal\nin this conversation is to not\nis to a certain degree walk with where\nyou've gone\nbut i would like to help you too we have\nthe same quest we're on the same quest\nokay and so what i'm trying to do for\nyou george in this\nhour and a half which as you mentioned\nis full of assumptions how much can i\nreally know how many details can i get\nyou're working with a therapist and all\nthat kind of good stuff is to point out\nto you the possibility that like maybe\nthere's hatred\nsome buried somewhere deeply deeply in\nyour heart\nand to consider for a moment that you're\nsomeone who from a very young age\nlearned how to bury things underneath\nrationalization\nand have things sort of manifest in like\nrelated but not directly\nrelated ways\nbecause like what did they do to you man\nand how is that fair\nit blows my mind that you're not angry\nand hateful towards everything in the\nuniverse and i get that you've done\nsome amount of work on that it's not\nlike those people are\nbad people either right it's not\nit's not like that you know it's not as\nblack and white as\nthey're terrible people oh\ni completely believe that that is true\nand usually when our feelings are very\nactive they don't think that\ncould you repeat that one more time yeah\nso like i agree that like no one is all\nbad and no one is all good\nbut that's a rational thought that's not\nhow feelings operate\nlike when feelings are active everything\nis like\nman that guy is just there's no\nredeeming quality\nfor this karen uh\nokay i see what i'm doing now i i see i\nsee what i'm doing\ni i i'm\nbasically justifying\ntheir behavior because i don't want to\nconfront the issue\nthat's a good way to put it that's right\nbecause\nbecause because if you confront it then\nwhat happens\nunless if you make them if you have an\nunderstanding buddha-like perspective\ntowards all people in the human being in\nthe world and they hurt you what does\nthat allow you to do\nuh sorry sorry i was just thinking about\nthat but it allows me to heal\ni assume no no it allows you to not get\nyeah sorry sorry\nso like like if i'm like\nso so if i sort of am like a tranquil\npeaceful bunta\nokay and i can see the duality of all\npeople and i can be\never forgiving when someone hurts me\nwhat does that let me do\nsomeone hurts me what is that like it's\nlike kind of a weird question\nbut basically what it lets me do is not\nget hurt\nuh i see right because like\noh like they stabbed me and they stabbed\nme in the back but like that's just the\nnature\nit's just the nature of the beast it's\nnot me it's just the nature of the beast\ntherefore like\nthere's nothing like fundamentally like\nwrong with me\nit can't be that there's any\nfundamentally wrong with me because it's\njust the nature of all things\ni am just like a leaf in the the\nriver of time yeah yeah i i get the\nanalogy you're trying to make\nright and um and like this is the really\nwild thing which is that like i\ni wonder if that's the same exact thing\nthat you did with your dad\nwhich is that he's just a guy who's like\nthat therefore i don't have to be hurt\nthat he doesn't give a [ __ ] about me\nbecause that's just what he is yeah and\nit could be\nlike honestly it could be the thing is\ni've been operating this\nway my whole life at that in that\ncontext\nthat\nhow the hell would ever i\never be able to like see that blind spot\nand how would people be\nable to like really see it even if they\nwere to really get to know me\nright like they wouldn't be able to\nso i see that\nblind spot a little bit now um\ni don't okay i think you\nsee the logical\nyou're like detecting a black hole i'm\nfeeling it too i'm feeling okay\nokay okay just a little bit a little bit\nokay but my thinking is obviously\nstronger than my feeling right like it's\nagreed um next level thinker\nyeah uh\nokay that's impressive if you're feeling\nit because you did a 180 pretty quick\nyeah it's hard\nwhat are you feeling\nuh well i'm feeling confused i'm good\noverwhelmingly um that's a good that's\nactually\nthe best thing to feel i'm feeling a\nlittle bit of anxiety\nokay uh um\nthere's a little bit of sense of a\nrelief okay that\nthat i'm kind of like understanding it\num\n[Music]\nthat that's where it stops right now i\nneed to think about this more and to be\nable to fill it more\nfantastic so so i think i think maybe\nthis is a good place to sort\nof wrap up george because sure my goal\nis to make people feel overwhelmingly\nconfused a little bit anxious and a\nlittle bit relieved at the same time\nwhen we know we've hit that that point\nthat's when we know we're\nkind of at a good stop so let me explain\nto you why confusion i think is very\ngood\nso we live our life based on static\nassumptions\nabout the way that we operate and those\nassumptions tend to be\nsometimes incorrect and tend to shoot us\nin the foot and hold us back\noh yeah that's the process of\nunchanging that staticness isn't to move\nbecause\nprior to like you had knowledge right\nyou had a conception of how the world\nworks\nand then we want to bring you to like a\ntheory of better knowledge\nbut you don't move straight from\nknowledge to knowledge you move from\nknowledge through confusion to new\nknowledge\nyes there's confusion in the middle\nthere there's like hey wait a second\ni thought that this build order was\nexcellent why did i lose\nyeah so i think it's great that you feel\nconfused and that's a sign\nwhen people are no longer rigid with\ntheir thought structures\nis when they grow yes of course i think\na big problem with the world is that we\ntry to avoid confusion\nwhen in fact confusion for sure\ni'm totally on that page so very\npractically i think there are a couple\nthings that you could try to float by\nyour therapist and i think\nin general you just need to do one thing\nto start out i'm going to give you a\nvery very\nsimple exercise to do i'm going to try\nto teach it to you now\nin some way i have to figure that out\nit's going to be something like\nmeditation\nbut literally george your first step\nis just to acknowledge the full range of\nemotions that you experience on a\nday-to-day basis\nyeah and because my guess is so it's\nlike very\nnormal for human beings to experience a\nrange of emotions\nincluding hatred i'm not saying you\nshould cultivate hatred i'm not saying\nyou should feed hatred i'm not saying\nyou should\nact on nature so don't take it that way\nbut what i'm just saying is that\nunless you're like really really\ndifferent like chances are your brain\nhas evolved the way that everyone else's\nbrain has and generally speaking you\nshould have the capacity to feel hate\nand unless you are enlightened buddha\nyou should probably be feeling some\namount of hatred somewhere\nand if you go throughout your day and\nyou don't feel hatred\nthen that's kind of weird\nso then you have to figure out okay like\nwhy am i like\nit's like color blindness for a\nparticular wavelength right\nwhy is hatred absent in my mind\nand then see if you can find it or just\nstart there\nbut just start with the observation of\nwhat's the full range of emotions that\nyou're feeling\nand i'm not saying that you should feel\nthem all equally so be careful about\nlike you know it's not equal\nbut can you find like hatred within\nyourself\nbecause like any normal human being\nshould\nhave hatred somewhere in there given\neverything that you've described\nhmm do you feel like hatred is\nsomething that a lot of people hide yes\nor no i think the one\nvery common emotion that people hide yes\nso i think the people who show hatred\ndon't recognize that what they're\nfeeling is hatred and i think the people\nthat\nfeel hatred don't show it\nokay my my my feelings line up with\nyou're getting somewhere with me now\nbut i'm still feel misunderstood\nbecause i i know where you're coming\nfrom no i i think i think the reason you\nfeel misunderstood is because you are\nmisunderstood\nbecause i'm making assumptions and you\nhaven't given me the whole story and i'm\njumping into conclusions\nyeah okay cool so i i i actually think\nit's\nvery helpful and i think\nthat perspective is putting me in a\nplace where i'm\nfeeling more and thinking less which is\ngood\ni sure so and i think i think\nunfortunately\ngeorge that's just the nature of the\nbeast yeah\nunless the more wrong i'm willing to be\nand the more i'm willing to jump to\nconclusions the more we can get done in\nan hour and a half even though it's\nwrong yeah\ni'd rather i'd rather risk being wrong\nto try to find something right\nrather than move as methodically as\nreally we should\nbut that's what therapy is that's what\nyour therapist is for\nso you shouldn't be misunderstood by\nyour therapist you should take this\nhypothesis\nbecause i'm not giving you a conclusion\nlet's be clear yeah what i'm giving some\ntime to explore\nexactly the most i can offer you is a\nhypothesis and i'm okay to\njump to formulate a hypothesis because\nthen the real answer is not\nin constructing the perfect hypothesis\nit's far more efficient to construct a\nass hypothesis once you get an inkling\nof something and then test it\ngot it okay this is all this all makes\nsense i guess\nin in all of this one of the things that\ni find interesting\nand and i i don't know why but you don't\nseem to\nresonate with the idea or at least you\ndon't\nfeel i guess as much passion towards the\nidea\nthat um\n[Music]\nalmost not relatable in the sense of\nlike i'm\ntrying to relate with you sometimes\nand you're almost being too much of\na doctor and not enough\nas a person\nyeah can you say more about that yeah\nso i\ntried i think\nto open up to\nrelate to you in a way that like we\ncould find\nsome common ground um\nand relate to experiences and i think we\nhad like a step at the start\nbut somewhere along the lines i was\ntrying to relate to you as a person\nand you were speaking to me too much of\nas a patient um and that\njust feels weird um\nit just\nyeah i don't know how to i don't know\nhow else to say it\nwell thanks for sharing that with me i'm\nnot surprised you feel that way\ncan i think about that for a second yeah\ni'm noticing a potential irony which is\nthat\ni found myself saying things to i found\nmyself thinking things\nto my thinking things that i would say\nto my actual patients\nthat i withheld from our conversation\nbecause i understood the scope of our\nconversation to be somewhat different\nfrom what i do with my patients\nso that could explain it okay um\nbut at the end of the day i wonder do\nyou feel judged by me\nmaybe a little bit i i think what i\nlove about you is when you get into\nthese moments\nwhere um you're not just\ndr k right you're\nyou're a guy that gets\nthis space in the industry and\nlike you're very relatable um and\nthrough that relatability i think\nyou really like connect with people on a\ndeeper level\num but i missed that a little bit\num this is a little bit or missed it a\nlot\na little bit uh i appreciate\nlike the um\ni appreciate like that you're trying to\nhelp me i really do\nlike i i i'm just like i'm speaking out\nloud right now\ni appreciate something i don't normally\nnormally don't do i think it's great man\ni'm really glad you're sharing this um\ni'm gonna ask you a question sure i want\nyou to\nreally really think about it before you\nanswer\nokay watch your first answer and then\nreally think about it\nshould i apologize no\nyou did you really think about it oh\nsorry you said watch my first answer\nokay\nshould you apologize should you\napologize\nno\nno because i set you up\nfor this\nlike\ni literally said dissect me\nso\nokay watch what happens next okay you\nready\nyup i'm sorry\nwhy for judging you oh\nfor not listening for not relating\nfor treating you like a patient\nthanks i'm sorry for not meeting you\nfor being superior for being analytical\nfor not walking the journey with you\ni think that's\ni think that's what is special about\nwhat you do\num when you can do that\ni think that's powerful\nbut yeah thank you for that apology\ni think i i\neither way i wouldn't have hard feelings\nbut that means a lot to me\nokay all right george i'm sorry\nokay so first of all\ni just couldn't hold myself because you\nsaid i wouldn't have hard feelings and\nit's like buddy\nwhen i i know i know you see you see\ni'm sorry no no it's it's like you see\nit though\nlet's look at it and laugh at the\nabsurdity of it yeah yeah i know i\ndidn't need to apologize how did you\nfeel when i did\nit was nice why it was like\nwe connected as human beings but like\ni needed to right yeah\nyeah absolutely it's crazy\nyeah it's it's crazy but\nyou this is\nwhen you said no you don't need to you\nbecame a buddha\nan artificial buddha and you protected\nyourself from the pain\nyeah because i did you were wrong man\nand then you wouldn't have hated me\neither way\nwhich is what i'm saying the [ __ ]\nproblem is and if if the\nif the apology creates if an unnecessary\napology\ncreates that kind of emotional response\nmaybe the apology is necessary\nmaybe those people should have asked for\nyour forgiveness\nmaybe when other people wronged you you\nshould hold them responsible for it\nokay you're [ __ ] right dude oh my god\ni see it now\nah that's so painful and i do it and\ni've seen it every now and then\nright i do it i rationalize it i\ni accept it i just you know like\nroll with the punches bro like but i\ndon't take care of myself\nyep and then that is going\nto cause a massive problem later because\ni'm going to just have that blind spot\nand i i haven't even begin to feel or\nthink\nabout what that evolves into but i'm\nsure it's not good\nyeah so i'll say one last thing george\nand i think you're pretty\nyour practice hand at this sure have\nfaith in yourself i think you can do it\nman\nthanks i think you've been working\nreally really hard to grow as a person\nand that work is not in vain\nand and it may feel like this is an\nunclimbable mountain because you haven't\nchosen to climb it yet but\ndon't confuse yourself you're good at\nclimbing mountains\nthis one is actually no different yeah\ni'm confident i can climb mountains\num so but it does\nhelp and it does mean a lot that you or\nanyone for that matter\nyou know pushes you up that mountain\nright\nwith support you know yeah sure cheers\nyou on\nthat's that's what we're here for man\nand and that's what you're doing for\nother people too\nyeah maybe not perfectly\nbut i'm trying to dust yeah\nwhich is all that you can do and no one\nelse can do it perfect either\nright so george what i really respect\nabout you is that you give what you can\nand it's not your fault that you you\ndidn't see the blind spot that's the\nwhole [ __ ]\nthat's what's a blind spot and now maybe\nmaybe it's there maybe is it isn't let's\nbe clear right so maybe the hypothesis\nseems more likely now but it doesn't\nnecessarily\nso test it i trust you i trust your\nintellect i trust your reason\nokay sweet okay i work through it with\nyour therapist\nso generally speaking i teach meditation\nbut i think i i hope this makes sense\ni think the i'm sorry exercise counts in\nmy mind\ndoes that make sense yeah\nokay i mean i've watched a lot of\ndifferent like\nsegments of yours so you don't need to\ngo through that process\nyeah so i think i think you we actually\ndid it then that\ni think is literally equivalent to\nmeditation because you saw what happened\nin yourself you were looking inside\nyourself you were paying attention it\nwasn't an intellectual exercise\nyou noticed it and then you understood\nafterwards\nbut overall george i i mean i think\nyou're just this has been amazing man i\nthink you're an amazing guy and i\ni really i think you can do this\nyou can do this man and you deserve you\ndeserve to do it\nfor yourself rest of the world you'll\nfix them later\nthat'll happen yeah you're right\ncool good luck man i appreciate this\nconversation thank you dude\nyeah take care um take care bye bye"
