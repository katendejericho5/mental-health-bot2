    "transcript": "okay so let's start with the idea of\nloneliness so like how do we understand\nif you feel emotionally isolated\nor lonely like even if you know people\nlike what's going on there\nthe first thing to understand is if\nyou're around people and you feel\nlonely it's because the part of you that\nconnects to them\nis not the real you it's the mask that\nyou put on\nright that's why you feel disconnected\nbecause there are all these people\naround\nbut they don't actually get to see the\nreal you they get to see a version of\nyou\nand so how can you feel connected when\nall you show people\nis a piece of who you are and so then\nthat begets the question\nwhy do we have masks on in the first\nplace\nright why do we like adopt this system\nof like putting on a particular mask\nand that's because for some reason or\nanother we're afraid of what people will\ndo\nif we don't have the mask the mask\ncomes because we lack confidence in who\nwe are as a person\nthere's something on the inside that i\ndon't want people to see\nand the solution here is not like oh go\nget confident man you're beautiful on\nthe inside\nno the reason that you lack confidence\nin who you are on the inside\nis because that's what you've learned\nit's not like you just need to get\nconfident it's because something\nhappened\nwhich taught you very clearly that when\npeople see\nwhat's on the inside it's not worth\nassociating with\nand that's why you put on the mask and\nthen you can discover something really\nreally dangerous\nwhich is that when you put on the mask\nthings get better for you\nright because when you hide who you are\non the inside people treat you better\nyou become\nnicer sometimes you become a doormat\nyou do things for other people you're\nalways down for this\nyou're a lot of fun you borrow you let\npeople borrow money and you don't ask\nfor it back\nyou become all kinds of things to make\nthe world\nlike you and to make the world an easier\nplace to navigate\nand then why would you want to be what\nyou are on the inside where people like\naren't your friend\nwhen you can be what they like\nand then they are your friend and so we\ndiscover that the mask\nactually has a lot of value it actually\nhelps us move forward\nin a way that you know being your\nauthentic self\ndoesn't but even though it gives you\nkind of lots of friends and you can hang\nout with people and you get invited to\nplaces and stuff like that\nyou're not letting people see who you\nare on the inside so you're emotionally\nisolating yourself\nthe more successful the mask is the more\nalone you feel\nand that's the damnedest thing because\nthe mask is doing exactly what it's\nsupposed to do\nit's supposed to get you invited to\nplaces and people texting you\nand stuff like that you think it's the\nantidote to loneliness because it's\nincreasing the number of interactions\nand yet you become more and more\nisolated\nso what do you do about that it's hard\nright so we can start with this idea\nlike oh you should accept yourself for\nwho you truly are bro\nand live a life of authenticity and like\nall this other you know like\nfeel good positive kind of stuff\nbut practically how do you do that the\nfirst thing\nis to understand that there is a part of\nyou that you were afraid of people\nseeing\nand it's going to be hard but you\nactually have to like show it to some\npeople\nright you should be your authentic self\nand\nrecognize that as you try to be your\nauthentic self there's going to be a\npart of your mind that rebels\nand says if you say this or you open\nyour mouth or you be\nlike you know who you really are if you\ntell a friend of yours that hey it kind\nof pisses you off that\nyou pick them you drop them off at the\nairport all the time when they have a\nflight but they never drop you off\nbecause it could rupture your\nrelationship\nbut it's authentic and you have to\nrecognize that\nas you start to become your authentic\nself\nyou can get rejected\nand you have to have the courage to face\nthat you have to acknowledge that okay\nthis is going to be terrifying\nbut i'm going to do it you have to be\nwilling to lose\nbecause the mask is about playing a game\nthat you can't lose\nand by playing the game that you can't\nlose you end up never winning\nbecause you're not putting it on the\ntable you're not actually risking\nanything\nand so something magical happens it's\nhard don't get me wrong\nso notice all those things like when you\nstart to you know say something that\nmaybe people will rob the wrong way\nor i mean i'm not telling you guys to go\nout and be an [ __ ] but like the other\nthing that could happen is like maybe\nyou want to be vulnerable\nright you can say hey like i'm afraid\nthat\ni'm gonna be alone forever and when you\ndisclose\nthat kind of thing you're going to feel\npathetic\nand so when you try you recognize that\nthere's going to be a part of you that's\nlike don't take don't take off the mask\ndon't take off the mask people won't\nlike what they see\nand this is the really damn annoying\nthing\nis that your impression that they don't\nlike what they\nare gonna see is actually like sort of\nan\nincomplete picture and somewhat false\nbecause that's the bottled up emotion\nthat's the sense\nof lack of value that you have in the\nfirst place in yourself which causes you\nto misjudge\nit's the insecurity itself that's\nspeaking\nthere's a difference between people not\nliking you and you believing that people\naren't gonna like you\nand that belief starts to control your\nactions and the more that you put on the\nmask\nthe less that you let people see the\nmore that belief gets reinforced\nbecause then what are you showing\nyourself you're showing yourself oh by\nthe way\nwhen i don't be my real self people like\nme a lot\ntherefore my real self isn't worth\nliking because they like my false self\nso every day that you put on the mask\nyou reinforce this idea that you're not\nworth liking\nbecause they love the mask why would\nthey like you\nthe thing is though it's all built on a\nhouse of cards it's usually built on\none experience or a handful of\nexperiences what we call\nsome scars so these are balls of\nundigested emotion they're rejections or\nexperiences of hurt\nwhere like you felt like you were not a\ngood person or that people like you know\nmade you feel like you're not worth it\nand then you carry that basic thing with\nyou and then it starts to grow in your\nmind\nand every day that you put on the mask\nit grows bigger and bigger and bigger\nand bigger\nbut something magical will happen if you\nstart to take off the mask little by\nlittle\nyou know find the right place find the\nright person try to take off the mask\nand see what happens\nthe more you take it off and you'll be\namazed because actually people\naren't going to reject you the way that\nyou think they are\nand then you're going to be like oh\nactually i don't have to wear the mask\nall the time you're going to feel\nconnected\nyou're going to open up a little bit\nmore you're going to open up a little\nbit more\nand then you'll start to realize that\nwhat i am on the inside may not be\nperfect but it doesn't have to be\nrejected\nand then you can start to turn things\naround because if we think about\nconfidence in yourself we think about\nsecurity and who you\nare security isn't about being perfect\nright security is about being flawed and\naccepted anyway\nthat's what it means to be secure in\nyourself because no one's perfect\nthis is the tricky thing about\ninsecurity is that there are a lot of\npeople out there who try to fix their\ninsecurity with perfection\nso what they do is they like i'm\ninsecure that i don't look good so i'm\ngonna\ndress very very carefully and if i can\ndress perfectly then people are gonna\nthink that like i'm\nan okay looking dude and that's a real\ndangerous thing because if i dress\nperfectly and i go out\nand then like no one's like hey man\nyou're ugly then i start to think\nthat i have to dress this way in order\nto be accepted\nand what it actually does is feed the\ninsecurity\nbecause then i begin to think that\npeople's acceptance of me\nis dependent on how i dress and there\nand is the nature of insecurity that's\nsomeone who's insecure\nthey have to dress a certain way\notherwise they're not worth anything\ncrazy so how do you start you start by\nnoticing the insecurity\nyou start by noticing the lack of value\nyou start by noticing that there is a\npart of yourself that is terrified to\nlet other people see\nthat's the beginning then what you do is\nyou put your toes in the water\nif you see what happens it takes a lot\nof courage but you have to take the mask\noff a little bit by loop\nand then something crazy is going to\nhappen some people are going to reject\nyou\nand some people are going to accept you\nand the more you\nlet people accept you because right now\nthe problem is that you're not even\nletting people accept you\nthe only opportunity you're giving the\nrest of the world is to accept a version\nof yourself\na false version of yourself and so how\ncan you ever gain security\nyou've got to give them a shot and the\nmore that you give people the\nopportunity to accept you\nthe greater the chances are that you\nwill actually be accepted\ni know it sounds like rocket science\nit's crazy\ngiving people a chance to accept you is\nhow you get accepted\nbut that requires courage it requires\ndifficulty and it requires noticing\nso if you feel emotionally isolated\nrecognize that it is the very things\nthat you\nuse to protect yourself that are the\nthings that are\nisolating you here you are building a\nton of walls so that people don't see\nthe real you\nand you're crying because you're on the\ninside all alone\nthe very solutions that you create to\nfix your problems are the problems\nthemselves\nand the more that you understand this\nthe more free you'll be\nthe more in control you will be because\nwhat is freedom it's about\ni can't control what other people like\nme like you're right but it's sort of\nlike you're\nyou're giving in to like that paradigm\nand so if you want to be in control of\nyour life\ntake a chance control isn't about\noutcomes it's about choices\nright you can't control what happens\nwhen you ask someone out\nbut when you never ask anyone out you\nfeel out of control in your life\nand what you try to do is control for\nperfection you try to make them say yes\nand all that thing just feeds into your\ninsecurity\nso i hope that was helpful it's kind of\nbizarre\nthere's a lot there and you know work on\nyourselves\nthe last thing is that that meditation\npractice that we did can be really\nreally helpful at helping you understand\nyou know what is you and what is the\noutside world and to learn to separate\nthose two things\nbecause a lot of insecurity comes when\nsomeone looks at something in the\noutside world\nand attributes it to their sense of self\ni asked one person out they said no\ntherefore i am an incel and i will\nalways be alone\nyou never bother to learn that they're\nlike actually not interested in you\nbecause they're attracted to a different\ngender but that somehow becomes your\nfault\ndo you take the outside world and you\nbring it into yourself\nand you are the responsible agent so the\nmeditation practice\nof focusing on the object of your senses\nversus the sense of yourself\nhelps you navigate that continuum\nbetween yourself and the outside world\nand the more you begin to realize that\nthe more you'll\nstop attributing things that are not\nyour fault\nto yourself if you guys want help with\nall this stuff\nyou know we have um that's what our\ncoaches are there for\nso i think you guys can you know learn\nthese principles and stuff do the\nmeditation we hope it helps\nif you guys want some help if you want\nsome support if you want some\nassistance you're welcome to work with\nour coaches\nthey try to help you guys understand\nthese kinds of patterns and stuff about\nyourself\nif you guys are interested you can also\nsign up for groups so the cool thing\nabout groups is that you're going to be\nworking on\nyou guys will be surprised at how much\nyou share with other people and i know\nthat a lot of people think that\noh like you know i have my own problems\nand like i won't be able to relate with\nto anyone or a lot of times the reason\npeople don't sign up for groups is\nbecause they\nthey're afraid they're going to bring\nthe group down or that they\nwon't mesh with the group and the cool\nthing about groups is that the whole\nreason that like healthy gamer is a\nthing is because\na conversation with one person actually\napplies to thousands of other people\nand so you guys will be surprised at how\nmuch you share with other people and the\nfact that you\nshare it is in and of itself incredibly\npowerful\nbecause when you get into a group of\nseven other people who feel emotionally\nisolated and you guys all talk about\nhow emotionally isolated you are\ni don't know if you guys get this but\nlike that's a very powerful antidote to\nemotional isolation\nso check out our coaching program if you\nguys are looking for a little bit of\nhelp"
