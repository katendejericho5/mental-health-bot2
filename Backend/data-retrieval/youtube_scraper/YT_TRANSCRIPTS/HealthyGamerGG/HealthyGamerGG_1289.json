    "transcript": "so a couple of things guys today is a\nvery exciting\nday because we're launching our uh\ncoaching platform to the public to the\npubs\nthe plebs the noobs so\njust a quick explanation about what\ncoaches are and what they aren't so\nthey're\nyou know they're people from they're you\nguys\nwho've said hey i want to help other\ngamers and or\ni guess we've even expanded beyond\ngamers now but\nyou know i want to help noobs let's call\nlet's call it that\nand uh they um\nso i train them for a few months and\nthen we kind of like go through\nyou know understanding other people how\nto talk how to listen and what they\nreally try to help you do is help you\nunderstand yourself better\nand once you understand yourself you can\nlike do more of the things that you want\nto do so it's my belief that\npart of the reason that we're stuck is\nbecause you guys know what you need to\ndo but you get you can't figure out how\nto do it\nlike you know what you should be doing\nbut like you can't do the things that\nyou should do so why is that\nand so our coaching program is really\ndeveloped to like help people understand\nthemselves because like once you\nunderstand\nyou know once you understand the\ncontrols then\nit becomes so much easier to play the\ngame okay but let's\nlet's get into the league league exparts\nyo how's everybody doing today\ngood how about you okay good so you guys\nare a bunch of like league experts\nsomething like that that's awesome right\num can we and we're talking a little bit\ntoday about like\nleague positivity and toxicity\nis that right yep do you guys want to\ntalk about something else\nit's your show or your uh your stream\nyeah but i i never figure out what we\ntalk about it's usually the guests who\ndetermine\ni know it's kind of weird right it's the\nfirst thing i'll ask people is like\nwhat do you want to talk about today i\nsee so you gave us a topic but then we\ndon't actually have to talk about the\ntopic\nnot if y'all don't want to i mean i\nthink that's why we assembled this\nparticular group of people but\nultimately if you guys so y'all are the\nexperts right\nso you guys know what our community\nneeds and what you guys need and if you\nall want to talk about something else\nthat's\ncool\ni mean if something comes up and\nwhatever happens happens yeah absolutely\nbuddy\ni can get behind that can we start with\nintroductions\nshould i go first i'll go first i'll be\nshy guys uh so i'm all at kenoja\nuh also known as dr k i have played\nleague of legends a handful of times\num i don't even remember which champion\ni played but it's\none that can root things and as a\nsupport\nand uh it's a fun game maybe i'll play a\nlittle bit more\nthat was great uh i'll go uh my name is\ndanny\nkenny lee or shifter uh team league you\nplay pro\num yeah not just stream uncomfortably\nnow\ncool um my name is jodat or boyboy\nlike danny i used to play pro two we\nused to\nplay against each other with each other\nand yeah i just been streaming for a\nwhile now too\nmainly league um\nmy name is uh chris or serches um i just\nplay\nleague for fun to stream um never played\nprofessionally\nbut uh i do get pretty up there in the\nelo with just playing\none champion so which channel my name is\noh sorry oh sorry sorry kurt oh you're\ngood you're good yeah\ni play uh singe i don't know you messed\nup the nasa sometimes too\nyeah we lost today boy boy i don't know\nif you i wasn't i know\nno i realized no it wasn't your fault i\nsomeone else through man i saw it it was\nhecarim but\nyeah i don't want to mention names yeah\nyeah sorry go ahead dude okay sorry my\nname is kareem\nsanchez i never played pro but i've been\nstreaming league for about two years now\nand i play top\nyou know what this sounded like what you\nknow like uh\nwhen you go to like those sharing\ncircles when they talk about like\naddiction and they get like the\nalcoholic yeah yeah yeah\nit's like my name is danny lee i'm 27\nand i\nplay league of legends\ndr casey you're damn right\nyou guys see how you fell right into\nthat trap i was like we could talk about\nwhatever you want to and it's like a\nshare circle at the beginning of an aaa\nmeeting\nmy name is you said it's it's chris or\nsearch searches yeah so search has is\nactually uh my name backwards\nso chris e with the z but uh that's how\npeople call me so i just stuck with it\nsearches\nyeah so search has this like i'm a i'm a\nsinge\nspammer pretty much yeah\nthe only champion i know to play yeah so\nyou guys um\nso let me just kind of dive right in and\ndanny that's hilarious man\nso you guys mentioned earlier that that\nyou know search has kind of apologized\nfor losing a game right\num and then and then boy boy was like no\nman it's not your fault\nit's that other [ __ ] noobs fault\nright so we get to we get to the\nbeginning of league which is like what's\nit like\nwhen you blame a teammate like why does\nthat happen like what what do y'all\nthink about that\ni think it's pretty natural reaction\nfor people to look for\nother reasons outside of themselves\nwhether it's true or not\nto like you know put a lot of the\nresponsibility or\na lot of times it turns out the blame\nand it happens a lot in league right\nlike um you know someone might have a\nsomeone might be playing well all game\nthey might not even make a mistake but\nsomeone might just\nsomething might go wrong and they might\nthink it's their fault and then they'll\nstart like typing flaming them\nthey'll get mad and just like go off on\nthem and that kind of stuff and i mean\nit\nthere's so many different situations and\nand contexts where that kind of happens\nbut i think it's it's like super meta um\nat least an elite community to just kind\nof\nlook for reasons to like tier other\npeople\nespecially on your team down um or like\nfind someone to like you know be a\nscapegoat or blame for whatever happens\nand\ni feel like that's kind of like been\nbeen been around since like you know i\nmean it's just like a gaming thing but\nit's definitely gotten worse over time\nin the league community i think as well\nwhat do you all think about that\num sorry i'm glad no no go ahead okay uh\ni think\npersonally shifting blame is like one of\nthe easier ways to\nlike i don't know it's just something\nthat a lot of people\ndo um and i notice it a lot and i think\nunless you're at the\nhighest of the highest levels of play\nnobody ever plays\nperfectly and it is like\nfrom my experience one of the\nlike the worst things that you can do to\nstop yourself from improving um\nbecause i think like instead of looking\nat what others did wrong\nyou should look at what you did wrong in\nthat certain situation but\nit's very hard to do in like the\nin the moment because\nlike something just went wrong the game\nis potentially lost you have 20 minutes\nof\npain ahead of you playing a game that\nprobably just got lost\nand like despite that you still have to\nlook at what you did wrong\nand so i think that's just like\ndifficult to do\nin that environment especially when\neverybody else is\nalready sort of tilted what makes it\nhard to do\num\n[Music]\nwell your ego gets in the way\nand that that's something that you have\nto really\nlike be real with yourself about\nespecially in league you'll find that\nit's much easier to blame others for a\nplay\nthan to blame yourself you guys think\nthat's specific to league\nno no i think right\nreal life other games it's the same in\nmy opinion\nyeah so why do we do that so it's like\nkind of like there's something actually\nreally\ncool about this is that you guys are\ntalking about something and i can't tell\nthat you guys are talking about me\nthere's ego involved you look for other\nreasons besides yourself\nfor the failures that you face\nright which is like this is crazy i\nnever connected these dots until now but\ni wonder if people can transform their\nlives by understanding\nthemselves in league because if you guys\nare saying it applies outside a league\nlike\ninteresting right so i've known plenty\nof people who are happy to blame their\nparents their siblings their teachers\nanyone but yourself\nyeah that's a good point so when curry\nlike i'm sorry go for it point\ni was going to say like it it kind of\nseems like a lot of people\ni kind of want to see like they lack\nlike perspective i guess\nlike when people get stuck in like a\nbubble\nthey they think about this one way or\nthey tunnel it and they forget to think\nabout it in different\nways or um\nyeah they just like they're just so\ntunneled on it and they these same guys\njust like wake up and get mad every day\nyou know they probably kind of fall into\nthe same routine but they don't really\ntry to actively switch it up so\ni feel like it's hard to change right\nyou just it's really easy to fall into\nyou know do the same thing every day\nyeah so\nhow does one so you guys used a couple\nof terms which i think it's important to\nkind of explore\none is ego and the other is losing\nperspective\nso what would you guys say like what is\nwhen kareem says ego what do you all\nthink he means\nego you just don't want to be seen as\nlike weak or worse than other people\nyou don't want to be seen as weak or\nworse than\nother people do you guys\nproblem i encounter a lot in league is\nthat\npeople will automatically like they\nreally don't like to get blamed\non i guess like um\nhe's how do i work this um\nyou give after me on this point let's so\ncan anybody help danny\nout wait wha\nwould you you said they don't like to\nget blamed on\nyeah like they they hate being the\nvictim they hate\nfeeling like weak or like bad yeah yeah\nyeah um yeah i think\nit's it i feel like i it's kind of like\n[Music]\ni guess one just immediate way to put it\nis like it's like you have like\ntwo junglers and like they're fighting\nover like this finite resource which is\nlike scuttle crabs\nand like usually two spawn one on each\nside of the map and like\nyou know one jungler can like go for one\nthe other can go for another or like\nthey can contest the same one\nand a lot of times especially since it\nwas introduced like\nyou'll have a lot of junglers like like\nmental boom because\nthey want to go for one and then like\nwhatever the situation is like whether\nthey don't have\npriority in lanes they can't get help\nfrom their team or they have\nworse like early game champions on your\nteam like they'll just over they'll over\nforce it or if they don't get it or\nwhatever they'll just be like all right\nwe lost like the game's over when it's\nliterally like you know it's worth like\n100 gold like a bit of exp like it's not\nit doesn't really matter that much\nin the grand scheme of like a whole\nleague of legends game\nbut i've had people like literally leave\nmy like the game at like three minutes\nin\nso many times because they like didn't\nget scuttle crap or whatever or they\nlike they felt like someone like screwed\nthem over\nand it's just kind of like that's like a\nmicrocosm of like what happens\nall the time in league which is like\nyeah if like if like you feel like\nyou're\nthe thing that you cared about the most\nor like your personal strength or like\nyour ability to carry or like be the\nhero\nor like you know whatever objective that\nyou had in mind or\nyou know if that if that gets derailed\nbecause of someone's else or because\nbecause you think it is or you just want\nto blame someone else it kind of just\nlike breeds like kind of like a\nnegative like outburst and like some\ntoxic behavior and stuff like that and i\nmean i've\nseen it a lot over the years and in like\ndifferent forms and stuff like that\num but yeah people definitely don't want\nto like\nyou know feel like they can't like\nbe like the like they want to be like a\nsingle-player game where like they're\nit's like their story and stuff like\nthat\nand if anything happens and they can\nfind a reason that like it wasn't\nthat that stopped them from doing that\nin the way they wanted like they'll just\nthey'll just like\nyou know go off on people and i don't\nknow obviously it's\nit's a little different in each\nsituation but i feel like\ni see that quite often\nwhat did you guys hear from voyboy's\nstory what do you think are the\nimportant\npoints from his example\ni think people just don't like to admit\ntheir mistakes so though like you i\nthink he was mentioning like how\npeople like to force things and um\nyou know it's not um what do you call\nit's not favorable for\nto like follow up with whatever the\nperson is trying to do\nbecause you can end up losing more like\num\nsometimes you know i'm top lane and my\njungler wants to gank\nlike tower dive and if i commit to it i\nknow i'm gonna die also\nso is it it's better to just let him die\nthan have me die\nand at that at that point the jungler\ngets really mad saying oh how come you\ndidn't commit with me\nuh you suck and then he starts blaming\nme for losing the game and then\nit's the whole game he just type scenes\nlike oh you suck this guy\ntop gap everything and it's just chopped\none\nto do oh they say like top gap like\nthere's a top difference like the other\nplayers better than you\noh got it yeah okay\nso i got something kind of bizarre to\nsay\nwhat if i told you guys so like you guys\nare talking about basically like this\nprinciple in league where\nsomething relatively minor goes wrong\nright like let's say he dives the top\ntower and he dies and you don't\ndie with him and what he wanted more\nthan anything else is you to die with\nhim because now that you haven't died\nwith him we're going to lose the game\nwhich is a [ __ ] up logic for it's in\nits own way\nbut and then avoid boy was kind of\ntalking about\nscuttle which is like you know you lose\nyour scuttle and you really wanted that\nscuttle like that was supposed to be\nyour scuttle\nand it's not your scuttle now and then\nyou like kind of throw in the towel\nright what if i told you guys that\nthat's not restricted to leak\nwhat if i were to say that i think half\nthe problem with the people who\nfeel stuck in life and join our\ncommunity is because they throw in the\ntowel because something didn't go their\nway\nyep sounds about right makes sense i\nagree\nright so like what do we do about that\nlike this is actually really bizarre\nbecause i think what you guys\ny'all are using league terminology but\nwhat i'm hearing you guys talk about is\npeople that i work with\nright they had something so like let's\ntry to understand\nwhat is it that makes like why do people\ndo this like how does that\nwork in their mind where\ni wanted to scuttle and i didn't get it\nso [ __ ] everyone\nand most of all [ __ ] me i'm gonna end in\nreal life\nso that's what we do right we int in\nreal life too\nwe self-sabotage i gotta be on a test\n[ __ ] it i'm never going to class again\nthey literally throw they throw they\ntake their gpa and they toss it out the\nwindow\nwhich is really kind of bizarre but the\nreally thing that i didn't really think\nthat we were going to get here\nbut i think bizarrely you guys may have\nan answer to transform\nthe lives of thousands of people\nif you guys can figure out why do people\ndo this in league\ni think people have a certain like idea\nand a certain mindset before even\ngetting into a game of league when they\ndecide to queue up\nfor example if you're going to play a\nreally aggressive champion\nyou have a way of thinking how the lane\nis going to play out or how\nthe matchup is going to play out and\nsometimes it just doesn't go your way\nand then depending on your mental\nyou can either\nlike improve on it see what happened\nwrong avoid it in the future\nand then in the moment adapt to the\nsituation and see how you can play from\nbehind\nor do what i think is the easy way out\nand just\nself sabotage [ __ ] everything i'm just\ngonna end\nso kareem said these are your three\noptions what would you guys\nsay to that\ndamn options suck\nyeah um rick i mean i think it's just\nlike\ni want to get back to the thing called\nperspective like yep\ni think maybe it's like\nmost people get mad like it's all they\nknow they haven't like experienced much\nelse\nlike to them like league is everything\nright\nbut they lose this game like they're\nlosing everything but like\nyou know some things aren't how much\nvalue are going to put on losing\nleague of legends games just one league\nof legends game unless you're like you\nknow pro play where everything is\non the line like how much is this one\nloss really worth you know like maybe\nyou could step outside like live life a\nlittle bit and like there's\nthere's more things in life than you\nknow at one legal legislative\nso i think yeah so danny\ni feel like theoretically that's true\nbut that's not how people treat it\nright so we can say whatever we want to\nwe can say oh like\ndepression is bad it shouldn't be there\nand but it's true and kind of going back\nto kareem's like okay either you learn\nfrom it\nyou rage like those are the two options\nkareem's\nright so i think our question so you\nguys have done a fantastic job of laying\nout okay so people lack perspective\npeople can learn from it or they can\nrage the question is\nwhy why do they do like if i it's like\nlet me give you guys a choice column is\nlearn from your mistakes\ncolumn b is let your mistakes determine\nthe rest of your life\nand so it's a no-brainer like no no i'm\ngoing to pick column a\ni want i want to learn from my mistakes\nbut it's not actually what people do\npeople [ __ ] pick column b all the\ntime\nso what on earth do they do that it's\nlike it's just a scuttle man like why\nare you\ngetting bent out of shape because once\nyou start hinting then you're actually\ngonna lose\nso why fulfilling prophecy you're damn\nright it is so why do people choose\nthe clearly crappier option\nbecause it's easier sorry oh yes\ni think it's yeah it's easier on us i\nthink it's they also want to bring other\npeople down to their level\nbecause like for example with what\nshifter said\nhe said um when uh\nyou know they they think it's just a\nleague game so\nthey're gonna leave how's it gonna\naffect them but when they leave it also\naffects their teammates\nbecause the other like their teammates\nthey want to win\nit's not just him getting infected so\nhim leaving\nalso affects the teammates and he\nprobably just wants to bring everyone\nelse down with him\nor her yep and you guys said it was\nit's easier what's easier about it\ni think it's like how they release their\nanger right like it's not like someone\nlike like\na small like a punching bag like they\nrelease anger like\nthey see something and then like maybe\nlike just get to like put it out a\nlittle bit i don't know\nso let me ask you guys a question how\ndoes it feel to int\nit feels good in the moment i can say\nfrom experience\nit feels good in the moment you bastard\nyou you can't help but feel bad about it\ni mean i know some people are so far\ndeep into this downward spiral that\nthey don't feel bad about it and they've\nkind of become known\nfor doing or this kind of behavior but\nyeah it definitely feels good at the\nmoment but they're\nfor sure healthier things to do for\nyourself for the game in the long run\nyes i'm not so interested in those right\nbecause they're they're healthier things\nfor\neveryone in our community to do right\nand they don't want to yeah\ni know what it feels like to be on the\nreceiving end of it\nhow does that feel um\nhonestly like\ni've i myself and like a lot of people\na lot of these guys like we we know how\nit feels to like\nbe into it whether it's like targeted\nbecause we're streaming or because\npeople like don't like us for a reason\num or like you know people have\npeople like put like bounties on my head\nin solo queue and like\npaid off like booster and stuff just to\nlike just like run it down on my game\nand like clip the reaction and then be\nlike haha look how like sad he is this\nkind of stuff\nit's like when i'm streaming and stuff\nlike obviously trying not to show\nlike how how like annoyed or like\nupsetting it is but like really like\nwhen i when i like have like a stream\nlike like into like three\nthree games or something like that and\nthen and i like barely get to play it's\njust\nit really sucks man like it actually is\nlike really\nover time like over years and like stuff\nlike that it is pretty depressing\num just like not really get to do the\nthing you love and then\nlike like at the way you want to and\njust have like your experience ruined\nand like it's just a game right like\nto a lot of people it's just like oh\nlike these like you know streamers\nthey're just like playing games like why\nare they like stressed out but like\nto me like league is like you know it's\nbeen my life for like you know 10 years\nand then just to like have it happen and\njust like you know have riot do nothing\nabout it\nso for so long and then just have people\nlike kind of normalize that kind of\nstuff and\nyou know belittle like when it happens\nor like justify it or whatever like\nthat kind of i don't know it's it\ndefinitely sucks\num yeah it definitely sucks a lot um\nso i don't know i i've tried always\njust like obviously losing a game by\nitself\nfeels really shitty for anyone right but\nthen just to like you know\nput yourself out there and like try your\nbest in a game\nand just have like someone whether\nbecause a play went wrong or they're\nlike you know just trying to like you\nknow get back at someone or\nwhatever their their reasoning it\ndoesn't really matter just to like\nsingle-handedly decide like all right\nlike your experience is ruined and\nyou're not you're not gonna get to like\nplay the game that you like and we're\ngonna just like make this\nmake this one game or this moment or\nmaybe multiple games like feel really\nshitty\nuh for you and then you have to like you\nknow be on stream and like\nyou know just do your best to be like\nwell guys sorry this guy's like running\nit down\num you know hopefully next game will be\nbetter uh\nhow's everyone's day going like it's\njust like what what do you what do you\ndo at that point like\nthere's not there's not that many\noptions um but yes\nit's definitely not a good feeling i\nguess search as i saw you nodding\ni relate to like i i'm known for just\nalways being positive and\nnever getting mad at anything but yeah i\nmean couple times\npeople do in and um same same attitude i\nhave to pretend that\nit doesn't affect me and i just try to\nyou know tell my community like hey guys\nwell that sucks it's just you know it\nhappens gotta move on next game\nhow does it feel though i mean it pretty\nmuch it kills the mood it kills the mood\nand you kind of just don't want to play\nanymore\nbut i i do enjoy the game it's just\ngetting losses like that like i don't\nmind losing\nyeah losing sucks but you know losing\nbecause of a player that's purposely\ntrying to lose the game for you\nmakes the the loss much worse and you\njust kind of kills the boot to play\nanother game\nwhat makes it so much worse\ni don't think that it just makes you\nfeel um\ni can't really describe the feeling but\nit's just you're hostage\nyeah like you're being held hostage for\n20 30 minutes\ncan you say more about that uh danny or\nkareem\num yeah because uh i mean usually\nmost of like the bad stuff happens all\nthe negatives that will happen in the\nfirst maybe five minutes or so\num but a game will always drag on to\nlike minimum\n15 minutes is when you can early as you\ncan send her now but\neasily games will just go like 20\nminutes and you're just trapped there\nfor like 15 20 minutes dealing with it\nbecause you can't just leave\nit's not like a game like like fortnight\nwhatever like whatever\nif you don't like your teammate you just\ntakes out there's no repercussions\nreally\nlike in the league you're stuck with\nthem and it's a team game you know you\nneed to work with your teammates to\nprogress and if they don't want to work\ntogether with you then\nyou know a [ __ ] so that's what i'm\nlooking for right\nlike so danny says so all you guys are\nsaying something at the\ntail end you'll talk about something and\nat the end there's some\nemotionally the [ __ ]\nwhat is that right because that's the\nclosest\nto the authentic what you feel like\nwhat is that\nat the nuts feels like kicking the nuts\nright so this is something that men do\nwhen i ask you guys about feelings\nyou describe physical sensation\nthat's the way that we represent\nemotions because you can't come up with\na word\nthey're words to describe how we feel\nwe call those words emotions\nsag right so this is actually really\nfascinating because\nas a community we've come up for our own\nvocabulary because we don't know how to\nuse the vocabulary of normal humans\nright that's what we feel like what is\nsad it's kind of like sad\nbut it's like i just learned about sag\nright it's kind of it's like really\nawesome it's like cool to see us\ndevelop our own like\nlanguage to describe our internal\nsensations and everyone understands what\npepe hands means\nwe all know that feeling\nright like so what is the feeling\nwhat how do you guys feel when someone\nshows up on your stream\nfirst of all how does it feel to have\nsomeone putting a bounty\non your head like [ __ ]\nthere it is so boy boy keeps on saying\nlike [ __ ] what does that mean\num like like me\nand all of us i guess like we're like\npretty positive streamers\num like it's like when someone comes up\nto you like in real life like\nthey like speak like in the face like\nwhat's your natural response like maybe\nfreaking you want to fight them right\nlike push them away but like\nfor us like we genuinely try to uphold\nlike\nyou know some sort of like positive\nenvironment community\nso it's like it's very draining for us\nto like\nhold it and hold it in because you don't\nwant to step down to their low\ntheir level we want you to be better\nthan that\nyeah so i'm hearing a lot of stuff so oh\nboy boy i'm going to ask you and i i\ndon't mean to pick on you by the way so\ni think that\nthe reason that you say like [ __ ] is\nbecause i think there's a lot of stuff\nencompassed under that umbrella\nso danny talks about it being draining\nlike you know that feeling right where\nlike you you have all these like\nfeelings that come up\nand you're like if i was a noob\ni could just let loose\nbut i'm not and so there are parts of\nmyself i think part of the reason that\nwe don't know\nhow to describe our feelings is because\nwe actually take those things and we\nshove them off into a closet and close\nthe door because you guys are\npositive streamers and if you show if\nthey see\nthat it works\nthat's just going to increase it yeah\num no for sure i mean it's something\nthat i've struggled a lot with over the\nyears like\ni'm i i did like a\nlike a 10 minute video where i was just\nlike talking to the camera like\na few months back and i was just like\ntalking about how horrible\nlike solo queue is and how riot's not\ndoing anything and how like you know\nlike target hinting and like people just\nrunning it down like it was one part of\nit but\nit was just something that i i just\neventually just like need to get off my\nchest and just like\nhoping like ryan would do something or\nthe community would like stop\nenabling um this kind of stuff because\nlike\ni don't i don't know man like it's\npretty hard like\ni've been i've been playing in like\nstreaming league for like nine years and\ni guess what just feels kind of bad\nsometimes is like\ni guess like i don't know like i feel\nlike i've always tried so hard\nto like set a good example and like be\nlike\na good member of like the scene and the\ncommunion stuff and like never like\nnever like ran down on people never just\nlike went off for no reason like always\nlike tried to like\nshow like you know like the best\nqualities you can like in game and like\nout of it\nfor like the players and just hope that\nyou know other people could could pick\nup on that and like and like run with it\ntoo and then just to have like you know\nso many like i just i just like i just\nlike\ni just like take a shower and just like\nwake up eat some food come on stream and\nthen just\nto like not be able to play the game\nlike to have like a four hour stream\nlike have like four games in a row where\npeople are just like insulting me and\nlike\nrunning it down and like this kind of\nstuff and just knowing like riot's not\ngoing to do anything and like having to\nlike\npeople people in chat being like boy\nlike what's why are you so sad like it's\njust a game like\nyou know just you know don't worry about\nthese people like they're just it's just\nlike\nyeah but they're like literally\ncontrolling like my like actual life\nlike when you're playing a game when\nyou're streaming and stuff\nyou know that's that's what you're doing\nthat's like what that's something that's\nlike who i am basically\nso i mean yeah it's definitely something\nthat's\nlike weighed down on me for like years\nnow and\ndefinitely got like it's been really\nlike the worst\num like this year but yeah i i don't\nreally know like\nwhat to do about it and like yeah it\ndoes i feel like showing like that it\naffects you or like\neven like when it's happening being like\nyou know like not just like laughing it\noff like i don't really know what to do\nbesides just trying to laugh it off even\nthough sometimes it's like\npretty hard um you know whenever it's\nhappening and\nyeah i don't know like i just i just\nfeel like\nit's it's not really fair i guess and\nthat's when i say\nlike it feels like [ __ ] it's just you\nknow it's just encapsulating\nthat those kind of things over the years\ni suppose um\nbut yeah can i say something\nuh i think i'm a bit of an outlier in\nthe way that\ni handle some situations compared to\nsome of these guys i mean\ni'm not i don't claim to be like this\nbeacon of positivity\ni mean like i know what it's like to be\nwatched\nand to have something happen to you that\nyou couldn't do yourself because you are\na streamer\nand i think that well i just want to say\nlike the way that you guys\nhandle those situations takes so much\nmental strength it is ridiculous like\nyou you could never understand\nunless you are put yourself into this\nsituation and like i really\ncommend that and i have so much respect\nfor guys like voyboy shifter searches\nlike for having the mental strength to\nnot do what others do\nand to not like um have this sort of eye\nfor an eye mentality\nand that's something that i'm working on\nmyself\nuh yeah i just want to say like because\nthat video\ni think was the beginning of something\nthat\nwas like a lot bigger and\nalthough like it hasn't really gotten to\nthat point yet where we can\nsay that there has been some like\nobvious\nchanges in the way that people think i\nthink it is\nfor sure like happening\nso like i just wanted to say like how\nmuch respect i have for for you guys and\nlike to keep going and not to give up i\nguess\nyeah thanks man\nno problem\nwhat's it like to hear that from korean\nit's nice because uh i mean sometimes it\nfeels like we're\nfighting like a hopeless war is it\nlike there's a reason why you know\npositive\nreinforcing streamers kind of died out\nover the years we've lost a lot of\nfavors like that um so it's\ndefinitely nice to know that you know\nwe're at least showing\nimpact or we'll see our efforts\nwhy do positive streamers yeah go ahead\nsuch as\nit's it's uh it's definitely uh\nuplifting and encouraging to keep\ndoing what we're doing um it's you know\nit's hard\nto see if we're making a difference or\nnot but you know\nit's really good to hear feedback from\nother people\nyou know just encourage us to keep going\nand um\ndefinitely\ni know this sounds kind of weird but um\nso kareem said something that was very\nwarm and supportive\ndid anybody find themselves having sort\nof like a negative reaction towards what\nhe said\nno not at all\nno it's something that\nsorry no go for it\ni was just gonna say like um\ni guess yeah what kareem said like the\nencouragement\nlike you know showing respect like i i\nguess like there are definitely\na lot of people that that do vocalize in\nthat way and like you know\ndo kind of encourage what we've what\nwe've always tried to\nbeen doing but i feel like it's\nthe almost feels like the vocal majority\nin the community kind of drowns it out\nsometimes so it's like a little easy to\nnot hear those things or not see them or\nkind of like forget about it\nwhen you're when you're kind of faced\nwith like\nsome of the more toxic sides so it\ndefinitely\nfeels you know good every time you know\nsomeone someone's like hey like\nyou know keep keep up keep up you know\nwhat what you've been doing and\njust trying to set a good example and\nthat kind of stuff so\ni it definitely feels good\ncan i think for a second yep\ngreat you guys have anything else you\nwant to say i i mean uh\ni feel like i'm sniffing something i'm\njust i need to package my thoughts but\nif you guys have more to add\ni'd love to hear\nokay\nso karim you say that you're not like\nthese are the guys\nright how does it feel to end\nthat's a funny question um\nin the moment again it does feel good\nbut you know you're not doing the right\nthing and it feels shitty because\nlike you have people in the chat calling\nyou out for it\nand then you have this inner conflict of\nlike\nbut everybody else does it why is it bad\nwhen i do it\nand then it's again you have these\nvoices and it's like\nokay but i'm supposed to be held to a\nhigher standard because i'm a streamer\nso it's just there's a there's a lot\nit's it's\nlike you have to balance out a lot of\nthings when you're streaming league of\nlegends\nand there are a lot of many different\nthings that can get to you kareem does\nit feel\nfair to int it does feel fair yes\ndamn right it does yeah\nwhat do you guys think about that it's a\nweird question to ask does it\nfeel fair what do y'all think about that\ni think it feels fair but it isn't sure\nyeah why does it feel fair\nbecause like what what i'm hearing from\nfrom these other guys these\npositive guys is that it's not fair\nit feels hopeless it's so exhausting\nright tiring but hinting is like\nthe opposite of all those things yeah it\nfeels fair\nit's invigorating\nright right yeah that's how like how can\npeople do\nlike like boy boy streams for four hours\nand he's wiped at the end of it\nthese [ __ ] ain't for 12 hours\nstraight and they're still going\nright it's weird right\nhow do y'all understand that\nit's like a very personal thing where\nit's just like you feel like you're\ngiving back what's being dished out to\nyou\ndamn right yeah and what was dish out to\nyou kareem\num that same thing what i've been\nbeing into yeah so so like in those\nmoments when you in what are you giving\nback to them\nwell i think the problem is you're not\nnecessarily giving back to the same\npeople\nwhen you like when you had a rough game\npreviously\nand you go into the next one with an\ninting mindset\nit's not fair but it feels fair i know\nbut what are you giving back\nright and who are you giving it back to\ni agree you're giving something back\nmaybe to the wrong person right you're\ngiving back [ __ ]\nyeah giving back a horrible experience\nyeah for sure\nto who to\nyourself and to others no i i toss that\ni'm gonna toss out a word\nyou're giving it back to the universe\nyeah because the universe [ __ ] gave\nit to you\nright right last\nlast game the universe or riot or call\nit whatever you want to\nlife gave you these shitties\nthese smurfs on the other team and this\ntop gap noob\non your team right\nthis afk jungler and so you're gonna\nyou're\ngonna punch back\ndoes that sound like it makes sense\nsounds about right yeah\nand so i'm gonna just start talking is\nthat okay\nyep you guys let me know if i'm like on\nthe right track or the wrong track feel\nfree to jump in if you guys have\nthoughts or questions first of all thank\nyou guys so much for sharing all this i\nthink it's actually\nreally fascinating um because what i'm\nactually hearing is not\nsomething i'm not really hearing you\nguys talk about league i'm hearing you\nguys talk about life\nwhich is bizarre but i'm going to start\nwith this idea of like not fair\nso here you are trying to live a good\nlife\nand then they're all the shitties\nin the shitties i don't know why we're\nnot quite sure\nbut maybe we'll figure it out by the end\nfor some reason they do things to you\nthat are like\nhard and painful and danny used to\nplay as [ __ ] depressing hopeless war\nright because that's what it feels like\nto try to be like positive\nin a game and sometimes that's also what\nit feels like to be positive\nin your own life is that you're fighting\nthis like hopeless war\nagainst i'm not quite sure what\nbut i think it comes back to the scuttle\nit comes back to this idea that like you\nwoke up today and you got into a game\nand you had this idea about what was\nsupposed to happen\nand somebody took that away from you\nwho took it away from you\nanyone but yourself it was\nnot enough lane pressure as you guys put\nit\nor you know like the other team like\nhaving a sm like\nsomeone took something away from you and\nthen you get angry\nand you feel hurt because you had this\nidea of what you wanted but it's not\nwhat they gave you\npoor boy boy wakes up every day and he's\nlike i love league of legends i used to\nbe pro i like to stream i just want to\nplay this [ __ ] game\nbecause i love the game and it's cool\nlike\ni'm okay losing i'm okay winning\ni just want to play that's all i want to\ndo if i get crushed i get crushed no big\ndeal\ni just want to play the game but instead\nso he has this idea right like he has\nthis expectation\nthat's the word you guys haven't used\nyet but that's the word i'm gonna toss\nout is the root of all this\nhey this expectation it's like i'm gonna\nqueue and i'm gonna get to play league\nof legends\nnot an unreasonable expectation\nand then someone someone somewhere out\nthere puts a bounty on his head\nand then he doesn't get to play that\ngame\nand i know it's like like kind of apples\nand oranges and i don't mean to\nsuggest that boyboy's like the guy who\nyou know rages when he\nloses the scuttle in the first five\nminutes but there is actually an\ninteresting parallel because like\nit's about an expectation that gets\ndashed right and i i think that one is a\nmore\nfar more reasonable expectation but at\nthe end of it i still see an expectation\nhe just doesn't get to play the game and\nit's not fair\nnow the interesting thing is like when\nwe look at voyboy we can say yeah dude\nactually you're right it's not fair but\nthe interesting thing\nis how does the scuttle player feel when\nhe loses the sky\nit's not fair\nand so if it's not fair to me it sure as\nhell isn't going to be fair to you\nif i'm diving the top tower your ass is\ncoming with me\nif i'm going to throw you're gonna throw\ntwo because i ain't thrown alone\nand we get to this like idea of i don't\nknow exactly how this turns into like\nsabotaging but it also is like\ntaking the world with you\nand and now i'm kind of like a little\nbit of a loss but i feel like there's\nsomething\nreally important about\nyou know making it fair and\nand sort of this sense that that cream\nis like yeah it feels fair\nright like it's like what what i feel\nabout someone who hints\nyou know what i really think describes\nthem as righteous\nwhat do you guys think about that\ni think it makes sense\ni think you know it's\nlike i mean in the context of league\nlike it's a team game\nthere's like 10 people playing and\nthere's so many factors that determine\nthe results\nbut at the end of the day like if you\nwant to single-handedly decide the\nresult for your whole team\nyou can you could literally just leave\nthe game or\nyou know buy mobi's and run it down mid\num so it's like you're taking all the\ncontrol away from everyone else and\nlike it's it's you have all the control\nright like you\nyou basically just decided everybody's\nfate um for better or for worse\nand so i don't know maybe like\ni mean you're the expert but that's i\ndon't know maybe that's\nkind of in parallel with with what\nyou're saying\nmaybe maybe not sir chess what do you\nthink\num i honestly i don't know okay\nbut i'm gonna stick with what boy boy\nsaid\nyeah so so i think there's something\nreally important here right so like\nlet's forget about the term\nrighteousness for a second but i think\nthere's something about\ntaking control when control has been\ntaken away from you\nwhat do you guys think about that\ni think somewhere along the way this\ngame stopped being\num team focused in the way that people\nview it and became a lot more individual\nfocused\nuh when people queue up and that kind of\nremoved the idea that sometimes\nuh there are going to be circumstances\nwhere\nit's actually not good to contest an\nobjective or\nto make a play um\nand that in turn\nlike leads to those events those\nunfavorable\nevents and then that leads to\nthe behavior that comes with that\nif that makes sense can somebody help me\nunderstand that\nyeah no i think it does make sense um\neveryone it was kind of like the first\nthing we like we're talking about too\nlike\nit's everyone wants to be like\nit's like you're playing skyrim or\nsomething like you go into a game and\nyou're just like\nthis is what i want to do this i'm going\nto win like i just watched like you know\nthis pro player or like tarzan like\njungle like oh i know exactly like\nhow to like 1v9 this game and then like\noh this like\nthis and then they go for something and\nlike they don't get the help or they\nthey mess\nthey mess up or they want to like find\nsomething else like you know it's just\nit's just figuring out like the\nwhy did it go wrong why was it not me\nand some people some people will be like\noh that was my bad like they'll learn\nfrom it\nthey'll improve as a player like that's\nreally good but i think it's kind of\nmeta\nat least it has been in the community to\nlike yeah\nit's all about you like how who can i\nblame\nif if if it's not going the way i want\nif the game's gonna be hard or like\na little bit arduous for my personal pov\nmaybe like\nmaybe it's worth just like giving up\nlike let's just open like running it\ndown like whatever the way you want to\nlike\nlike kind of kind of deal with that\nfeeling i guess\num and it like everyone has their own\nway of dealing with it\nlike for me if i'm jungling and i want\nto go for scuttle\nand their lanes collapse and i lose it\nor i die like\ni'm not going to run the game down\nbecause it happened some people will\nsome people won't some people will keep\nplaying their best like\nbut just from freezing from my\nperspective i'll just be like okay that\nsucks\nbut like what can we do from here like\nhow do we play this game out because i\ni really think most solo games are\nwinnable and that's why i try to like\nencourage my teams to like never give up\nand like\nplay it out and focus on like what win\nconditions that we can find even if it's\nlike a small chance right like\ni've gone flat for this over the years\nbut like yeah if if if you start off a\ngame with like a 50\nchance of winning and like your regular\nelo and then things are going poorly\nand then it turns out you know you're\nreally behind and maybe it's a 10 chance\na lot of\npeople would just like want to go next\nimmediately and\ni'm not saying this is correct but this\nis like how i've always approached it\nlike\ni want to play for that like 10 chance\nof like winning the game usually\num which is like very far gone from like\ngiving up as soon as you lose like the\nfirst\nthing that you're fighting for just like\na scuttle cover whatever which is maybe\nthe percent chance to lose the game\nafter that went down by like\nlike two or three or something like that\nwho even knows like one percent like\ni'm not i don't know exactly but i don't\nknow it's\nhow did this kind of sorry how did the\nmeta\nbecome that way\nuh i think oh sorry sorry no okay\ni think over time like i think i think\nlots of it has to do with riot i think\nlike\nit's just it's just we've been like i\nknow with like the video on the stairs\nlike\nasking for help and stuff like we've\nbeen doing that for\nyears years we've been talking like\ndirectly like one-on-one and like your\npersonal stuff like\ntoxicity like people like believing gays\nand stuff like this has been happening\nages and i think like\nwe've been waiting for so long and it's\njust never really happened\ni think something was just like yeah\nlike in the last little hope\nright to like solve this issue it's just\nkind of spiraled out of control it was\nlike\nmm-hmm yeah are you angry at that 100\nwhat is this video you said video on the\nstairs\noh what does that mean\nit was it was yeah it was just it was\nlike a vlog i did\ntalking about solo queue and league and\nhow riot hasn't like done anything and\nfor years and how the system's just kept\ngetting worse\num and people were just like abusing it\nand like there's no consequences and\nstuff so it was based it was basically\nasking like\nriot to like fix [ __ ] and help us right\num because i do think a lot of the blame\nis on riot\nyou know like their system has been\nbroken for like so long\nand if you like we're talking about\npeople like why people end like this\nkind of stuff but like if you go into a\ngame you just like start running it down\nlike\nyou should get punished for that you\nshouldn't be able to like just queue\nback up and go into another game and do\nthe same thing and ruin like you know\nnine other people's experience\nbut like for so many years like that's\njust\nit's like people people literally have\nlike ran down like 50 games in a row and\nlike even their automated\ndetection systems haven't done anything\nin a lot of cases so\nit's just it's been like a pretty big\nproblem for\nfor a while now so yeah like the stairs\nthing was just me sitting down like\ndoing like a\nlike a vlog talking about and like\nasking right to help because like we've\nbeen saying the same things for so many\nyears and\num at least that video like a lot of\npeople like resonated with the message\nand like shared it and write like\nyou know watched it and responded and\nstuff like that but i mean it's we're\nstill far from like\na good system but what they say um you\nknow\num uh yeah they i mean they they they\nsay they said like yeah we've been\nworking on stuff like we hear you guys\nlike\nall this stuff and they've been posting\nlike more consistent updates about like\nhow they're approaching like the systems\nand toxicity\nand like you know fix like improving\ntheir automated system\num all these kind of things but yeah i\nmean obviously it takes time\num i don't think anyone expects it to\nlike but it's been like a problem for\nlike so many years but\nwith that said like it does take time\nbut um\nyeah i don't know hopefully hopefully\nlike you know going into next season\nthere\nthere'll be a more robust system i guess\nand some of the problems can be\naddressed but i\ni don't really know like it's kind of\nlike a wait and see\nthing at this point so so pardon my\nignorance but\nand does anybody else want to uh bounce\noff of what roy boy said i want to give\npeople a chance but i had a couple of\nlike general questions about\nweek\nso so like does league have a report\nsystem\nyeah but it's the most flawed uh\nsystem ever it is useless what do you\nmean by flawed how does it flaw\nit's flawed in that punishable behavior\nisn't punished\nor very rarely is like\nthere have been so many instances where\nthere was blatant\nthings that are against like\nthe summoner's code or whatever that\nhave been\nreported but not punished and then there\nare\nlike on the complete end where on the\ncomplete other end where there are\nthings that shouldn't\nlike be seen as serious\nget punished i think\nyeah and and is there anything like\nyou guys know what the concept of the\nbehavior score and dota\nno you guys heard about this okay no so\ndota actually has a pretty interesting\nthing which they implemented a couple of\nyears ago i mean some people\ncomplain about the system generally\nexperience my generally speaking my\nexperience with it has been pretty\npositive\nso you have this thing called a behavior\nscore that goes from zero to ten\nthousand\nand generally speaking i don't know\nexactly how it's like on the back end\nyou don't really know\ni don't know how your behavior score\nchanges but if you have a high behavior\nscore you get paired with\nother people with a high behavior score\nand what i tend to find is since they\nimplemented behavior scores\ngenerally speaking in my games i've been\nvery surprised by like when i [ __ ] up\npeople will be like hey man that's okay\ndon't worry about it\nand and i also hear that there's an\nabsolute cesspool\nof like low behavior score people\nso like for example if you disconnect\nfrom a game you get put into something\ncalled\nlow priority queue which means they take\nall the re\nall the degenerates and they stick them\nin games and\nliterally what could happen is you can\nget stuck in low priority queue\nbecause everyone is ending all the time\nand it's just like constantly like all\nthe ragers just being paired with each\nother\nand get out of that if you decide that\nyou have to finish\nall you have to do it's like [ __ ]\njail i kid you not it's like purgatory\nyou have to like like complete five low\npriority q games\nor something like that and and i've\nnever\ni've never i mean i've always been\ncurious but i've never been in a little\nprivate eq game before\nand and so i'm i'm afraid to go because\ni'm afraid i'm never going to be able to\nget out\nbut i think it is kind of interesting\nthat like you know they have implemented\nthings and generally speaking like\npeople are pretty\npositive in in the games that i play i\nmean there's still people who are upset\nand stuff and i think in dota\nyou know you're not locked in for 25\nminutes it's 45 minutes baby\nit's it's damn near an hour and\nand so that's that's really painful and\nyou can't surrender in dota\nthere's no conceived button which which\nalso is kind of an interesting\ndesign choice um\nbut uh yeah what do you guys think about\nthat\num i think it's like i think it's a good\nidea i mean very rarely\ndo i get in a game where everyone's\npositive like very rare i probably like\none game every\nmonth and i play like 10 games a day\nor more so it's very rare but when when\nyou get in those kind of games\neven when you're losing your whole team\nis so positive everyone just has fun\nabout it they're like oh we're losing\nand\nwe just like start playing around and\nyou know have fun losing and\nthat's like the kind of you know kind of\ngames i want to play\ndaily you know to me have more enjoyment\nplaying league\nyeah i would rather oh no you guys\nuh those systems typically only work for\nlike lower rating\njust because there's more people playing\nso you actually find a match with\nactual like the amount of positive\npeople i want to return higher\ni'm pretty yeah the real players is\nlower so yeah\ni imagine like maybe if they implement\nthat take like\nhours to find a game yeah that's\nprobably why they don't do it\nyeah uh that's i was gonna say something\num relate to that too so i don't think\nryan would do something like that\nbecause of that problem and also like i\nmean like they tried with\nwith like the whole honor system right\nbut\nthe thing with the honor system that\nryan implemented like\nwhat ends up happening is usually people\njust honor like it's like you can honor\nfor like\nlike i think it's like shock calling\nlike\nwhat are the other ones guys like i\ndon't even know like like positive and\nyeah like a good game yeah like having\nlike it's like there's like a heart one\nand then i don't know i\nfor me like i just at this point just\ndefault like people that like\neven like yeah i i don't think anyone\nuses the honor system like the way it\nwas designed people just usually just be\nlike oh who like popped off the hardest\nkind of\nand they just honor them so if you have\nlike a high honor level it's usually\njust like\noh you just probably like carry like a\ndecent percentage of your games\num so but it's kind of weird it's called\nhonor and like there's like rewards tied\nto it like you get like little skin\ncapsules and stuff like that but\nit doesn't really help in like the sense\nthat like\nincur i don't think it really encourages\nlike those kind of behaviors or like\nmakes the community truly better um i\ndon't know maybe i'm wrong i don't like\nthe numbers like that but i never felt\nlike\nit really uh did anything productive\nat least from my perspective yeah\nwould you guys describe the league\ncommunity as\ntoxic yes\nyes yeah majority of it probably\nreally so you guys this isn't like a\nvocal minority kind of thing it sounds\nso surprising\nthis is like public yeah everyone\nthinks that way everyone will think of\nbiggest thoughts\nwhy\nprobably just have more bad experiences\nthan good ones and playing a game\nand like you play games for fun normally\nif you eat it casually\nyou probably just ran into more bad\nexperiences than good\ninteresting you know so this is kind of\na random aside but\nyou know the problem with the behavior\nscore system so like you guys\nthis is going to be a random question i\nhave no idea if you guys have any\nexperience with this\nyou know if you have a kid who acts out\nlike do you guys know what the like\nso if i let's say there are 10 kids in\n10 classes that act out\ndo you guys know what happens when i\ntake all those 10 kids out of those\nclasses and stick them in a class\ntogether\nnope so the interesting thing is that\ngenerally speaking if you want to\nrehabilitate people\nyou don't separate you keep them\nwith like so if you take like a toxic\nperson so if you think about like uh\nyou know like if you think about\nalcoholics for example maybe this is an\neasier example\nso if we have a bunch of alcoholics and\nyou actually like\nput an alcoholic with a group of sober\npeople\nthat's actually how they get sober\ndoes that make sense you don't do it by\nlike putting a bunch of alcoholics\ntogether and i know people sort of they\nsay but\nisn't out is an alcoholic synonymous\nlike a bunch of alcoholics together\nwell yes but they're also sober they're\nsober alcoholics\nright so the interesting thing the\ndownside i think to the behavior score\nsystem is that it actually\nconcentrates all of the positivity in\none area which is great if you're a\npositive person\nbut also makes it a hopeless\nfor everyone else and\nand i what i'm kind of curious about is\nlike when you guys talk about like the\nmeta has become toxicity\nand so what my question is to you guys\nis like how do we change that\nand i know you guys have said riot needs\nto do something so fine but\nyou know that's them\nwe gotta make everyone positive how do\nyou do that\ni mean i don't even like i don't even\nthink\ni don't even want like the whole\ncommunity to be like like positive like\nnecessarily\njust like i just wish people would be\nlike more mellow like chill like\nnot like you know so\njust getting so hyphy and like vicious\non each other for like you know maybe\nhaving a bad game or\nyou know playing poorly or whatever like\nyou know whatever\ntheir percep perceived like offenses i\ndon't know i just like\nit's just so easy to to tear people down\nwhether you're playing a game or like\nwatching a stream or like\nyou know posting a reddit comment or\nlike a youtube comment like whatever\nlike i know this is like it's the\ninternet like i don't know it's it's\nkind of\ni mean you're asking like what can we do\nabout it like it's just i\ni just it's just hard when like you a\nlot of places that you look it's like\nthere's so much negativity and\nyou know it can be draining over time\neven if it's not even directed at you\nright just seeing it like\nso consistently um and honestly i have\nno idea like like i said\nyou know just i feel like trying like on\nour like we're just like we're just like\na few streamers right like people\ni'm sure there's a lot of people\nwatching this or like you know might\nhear like this convo that\nmight might you know be a part of people\nthat want want like a more chill\ncommunity like want\nmore positivity like less less you know\nnegative hyphy behavior\num but like you know what what can we\nall do right like that's the thing\nlike it's it just feels like\nit just feels like i'm not gonna say\nlike\nlike for example i've been sorry i'm\nlike saying like a lot and so um i'm not\ni'm trying to figure out like where i'm\ngoing with this but it's like i've been\nstreaming for like\n10 years almost like lee and i feel like\ni've always tried to\nyou know set a good example and like do\nmy best\nnot like not like being fake like i'll\nget mad all like i'll\ni'll be like this guy literally through\nthe game like i'll call people out but\nlike i've just tried my best to like\nnot be the the things that you know i\nfeel like really tear me down or tear\nother people down that i see it\nsometimes in the community and i just\nfeel like all\ni just feel like at the end of the day\nlike what did i really accomplish like\nit just feels like there's so much\noverwhelming like\nnegativity around and it feels like\nthere's nothing i can really do on an\nindividual level or like you know we can\nreally do to like change that\num that's that's honestly like like\ndanny says like a hopeless war like i'm\nnot saying i like i've like given up or\nanything like that but it really just\nfeels like\nlike i haven't like we have no clue like\nwhat we could possibly do\nto like change that it's like we're\nwaiting for reinforcements\nbut all we get is like little timmy\nlittle waggy little sword in the back\nbut some key fragments yeah where's that\nwhere's our help\nwhat i'm hearing is that positive league\nplayers are an endangered species\nyes i get the sense i mean this hopeless\nwar analogy of like you guys are like\nyou know stalwart warriors falling one\nat a time\nand every time one of you falls you like\nlook behind you to see if reinforcements\ncoming and no one's gone\nit sounds pretty bleak to be honest guys\nsounds hard\num again like i i'm not sitting here\npretending to be a very very positive\nperson i'm not\nand i i also don't think that it's\nrealistic to\nthink that there is a date that's going\nto come where the majority\nof the community is going to be positive\num however i think\nlike with the like it it's undeniable\nthat it has been a downward spiral\nbecause a few seasons ago it was\nnever the way that it is today\nso i i'm just so curious as to what\nhappened there must have been like this\nit's like a a community but it's also\nlike a culture in a way\nwhere it's become\nnormalized to be toxic\nand uh like i'm not sure where that\ncomes from uh maybe it's\njust from the fact that most people\ndon't play this as a job\nand they just um queue up for a game of\nleague to\nlike escape or lash out or whatever the\ncase may be\nbut i just wonder like i'm really not\nsure how it got to this\npoint\nyeah you know i think that's a\nfascinating question i sometimes wonder\nso pretty much like there are big trends\nthat are happening so sometimes i wonder\nif the trends that we see in gaming have\nnothing to do with riot or the actual\ngames they have to do with the people in\nthem\nso what has happened to people's lives\nover the last three or four years\ngenerally speaking one thing that we\nknow is that mental illness has\nnow surpassed heart disease in cancer\nand is now number one in the united\nstates for\nwhat we call morbidity and mortality\nwhich means that like\nthe burden of disease is now\nworse so we're number one so something\nis going on with people's minds\nin general like across the developed\nworld\nprobably also true in like third world\ncountries or developing countries as\nwell\nbut generally speaking like people's\nminds are becoming\nmore toxic\nand i wonder if if that has something to\ndo with it like i think there are big\nmacro trends\ni do think that i'm not ready to give up\nhope yet\nand i know that you guys and that's\nprobably because i'm new and naive\nand i'm timmy with poop little sword\nbecause i just i just don't train a\nlittle timmy though huh\nwe gotta train little timmy though\nthat's sure so maybe a little teammate\nneeds to learn how it is\nbut i have a couple of like crazy\nthoughts i mean so i think the first is\nthat\ni think we can understand as a community\nlike how\num where like tilt comes from and i\nthink we have to understand that like\ntilt the reason that tilt happens and\nthe reason that there's so much toxicity\nis because i think it feels good\nright like like we said earlier i know\nit sounds kind of bizarre but being\npositive is going to wipe you out\nin four hours raging at the internet\nis like something that you can sustain\nfor hours on end\nand i don't quite understand why that is\nor how that is i think part of it feels\nlike very validating\nor resonant for lack of a better term\nlike it feels right and so you know you\ncan do a lot of things that feel right\nwhereas like you know restraining\nyourself like we were talking about\nearlier if you feel hopeless if you\ndon't want to display your negativity\nthat comes at a cost whereas like\nletting loose and i think it kind of\ngoes back to what kareem was saying\nearlier about\nyou know you can rage when you lose or\nyou can learn\nand karim why do you think why don't you\nthink people\npick learn\ni think either because they don't want\nto learn and play the game\ncasually or because\nit is the harder like route to take\nso what makes it harder and this kind of\ncomes back to what danny was saying\nabout perspective\nright so danny was saying like if people\ncan get perspective they don't tell\nso what makes perspective hard why don't\npeople have perspective\nlet's do something different i'm sorry\nyou gotta do something different like\nlearn that\nyeah yeah like like i'll say again like\nthey respond to the same routine that\nthey don't want to change\nor do anything different because it's\njust easy easy to do the same thing\nwhat makes it easy to do the same thing\nbecause you know it\nyou know what to do you feel comfortable\ndoing it because\nyou're in your zone you don't want to\nstep out of that zone\nyeah you're not really challenging\nyourself and putting yourself in a\nposition to fail i guess when you're\ndoing\nthe same thing that you know you're\nputting other people in position to fail\n[ __ ] that if you're gonna fail they're\ngonna fail too\nright i'm diving i'm diving the top\ntower your ass is coming with me\nif i'm gonna have a bad game you're\ngonna have a bad game\nyeah so i think that's a big part of it\nso like here are a couple of\ni mean you guys have anything else like\ni feel like sort of i have a couple of\nconclusions to share with you guys i'm\njust curious what you think\nand i wanted to sort of give you guys\nsome chances to respond or\nor tell me i'm an idiot\nand tilt is that okay\nyeah yeah because i think i've learned a\nlot from what y'all have to say\nand i'll start with this once again i've\nsaid it two or three times already but\nthe first thing is that it it blows my\nmind\nhow parallel what you guys are\ndescribing is to\nactual real life and it kind of starts\nwith this idea of expectation\nright so like i'll give you guys just\nlike a real life example let's say i'm\nsmart\nbecause that's what we are as gamers\nright we're smart\nand then we go to school and\nwe've been smart so like i i've i've\ngotten straight a's\nthrough the sixth grade and seventh\ngrade after flex on us\nhuh so you didn't have to flex\noh straight a's through the sixth grade\nis flexing now\nand so so i go to the seventh grade and\ni find that i get a b\nand then what does that mean about me\nbeing smart\nwhat do you guys think it threatens it a\nlittle bit\nabsolutely so how do i get an a\nwhat do i have to do now in seventh\ngrade you gotta study\nand what is work harder what does\nstudying say about me being smart\nyou're not as smart as you thought you\nwere you're damn right\nit's interesting right so what i need to\ndo\nactually threatens who i am i'm stuck\ni'm screwed\nparalyzed because if i study i'm not\nsmart anymore\nand if i don't study i'm going to get a\nb and i'm not smart anymore\nso what is the only way i can preserve\nmy intelligence\nyou guys know not studying\nand why i'm still getting a's nope\nit's actually a stop trying yeah you\ndon't even get tested or whatever you\ndon't even\nabsolutely oh yeah you you just don't\nyou just don't want to see the result\nabsolutely you're damn right i just say\noh yeah\ni don't care about learning english\ni read dostoyevsky in my free time i\ndon't need to read this middle school\n[ __ ]\nyou denigrate it and then it's okay to\nget a b\nbecause you're smart so it starts with\nan expectation i don't know how exactly\nthat translates into league\nbut i think there's something in there\nabout not learning and not getting\nbetter\nit's the easy road right kareem was like\nit's hard to learn\ndanny's like it's hard to change who you\nare\nso these people preserve who they are\nbecause it's easier\nso i'm going to be bronze and call\neveryone else a shitty\nbronze is a rank in league is that right\nyeah\nokay so like i'm gonna say bronze and\ni'm just gonna call everyone else\nshitties\nso i think there's something there the\nsecond thing is like oh man gg go next\noh god if there's one problem in our\nsociety right now it's gg go next\nbecause this is what we do like people\nwho are stuck at home\nthey wake up one day and they're like\nyeah today i'm gonna learn how to code\nand they load up league and then\nwhat happens after one hour is they tell\nthemselves gg go next\nand you know what next is it's tomorrow\nand then they wake up tomorrow and\nthey're like today i'm gonna learn how\nto code\nand they play one game and they say gg\ngo next\nright it's it's like the first five\nminutes when you lose the scuttle you\ngive up on the game and you're like gg\ngo next\ni want it to be perfect otherwise it's\nnot the game that i\nenvisioned oh [ __ ] like coding turns out\nthat it's like it's way\nmuddier and it's not the expectation\nthat i had like\ni knew what i wanted to do this game i\nwas gonna be a tarzan or whatever\nand i was gonna own everyone 1v9 and\nsomeone ruined it for me so [ __ ] that\nexpectation\nand we have expectations for our rise\nfrom the shittiness of our life\nright we're going to be transformed and\nlike some people like i'm going to be\nthe next boy boy\ni'm going to be the next positive\nstreamer i'm going to be the next kareem\ni'm gonna be the next xyz and i'm gonna\nbecome a big league streamer\nand then when things don't go their way\nwhen they start streaming for like two\nor three days and they they have like 30\nviewers\nthey're like ah screw that\nlike it's easier to say gg go next and\ngive up than it is to actually like try\nto learn\nand that kind of gets to this issue of\nlike you know what are our choices\neither we rage or we learn and there is\nsomething really really awesome\nabout raging and giving up because it\nfeels good it just feels really good\nit feels really good to say gg go next\nand i thought it was really interesting\nso if you guys listened\nto kareem's words he said it feels good\nbut you know it's not the right thing\nand i think there are a lot of people on\ntwitch\nwho do things because they feel good and\nthey know it's not the right thing\nlike you know you should stop playing\nleague after one game and like maybe\nlearn how to code\nbut there's that voice in all of us\nthat's like it's not the right\nwhat i'm doing is not the right thing\nbut i want to do it anyway\nbecause it feels good so then the\nquestion is why do you get that\nis this okay am i just ranting am i\nlosing you guys no no you're great\nthat's good awesome okay\nso then we get to like okay so then why\nis that\nand i think it's beautiful because you\nguys gave it to us like in the first\nfive seconds of stream\nego right if we think about like like\nwhere does ego go into this\ni think a lot of toxicity comes from ego\na lot of toxicity comes from this idea\nthat like like i'm intelligent like i\nhave this\nidentity is i'm very smart\nlook at how five head i am and the more\nthat we attach ourselves to that\nidentity of i\nam this way like the more we get to this\nbass awkward sort of situation where\nlike i get a b\nin class and i'm relegating myself to bs\nor c's\nor d's or dropping out for the rest of\nmy life\nbecause that's what gg go next looks\nlike for the people who are 23 and\nliving at home and watching twitch\nall day i love you guys but your problem\nstarted when you started saying gg go\nnext\nso the really crazy thing that i had\nnever envisioned before\nis that an antidote to this problem of\nall places\nis league of legends this is the really\ncrazy thought\nand i've never really thought about this\nuntil this moment but the way you guys\nare describing league of legends makes\nme think that\nif you can take a toxic player and\ntransform them in league of legends\nthe same formula is what's necessary to\ntransform your real life\nbecause it's the same [ __ ] it's ego\nit's expectation it's perspective what\ndoes perspective mean\nperspective is something that i would\ncall attachment\nyou are one in the game your identity is\nlost in the game\nit's not just a game it's everything\nfor that person in that moment league is\neverything\nand you [ __ ] [ __ ] you took my\nscuttle you're taking everything away\nfrom me\nand so how do you cultivate that\nperspective\nright because some of you guys are able\nto do it but it's like really hard\nand even in your case boy boy i think\nyou could bet everyone can benefit from\nperspective\nwhen you have a hundred percent\nperspective you guys know what we call\nthat\nor what people what another term for\nthat is\nand it's kind of a weird open-ended\nquestion when you have like a hundred\npercent perspective all the time\nthat's what buddha called enlightenment\ndistance from the thing that you are\ndoing\nthe ability to recognize that all of\nyour emotions\nthat get wrapped up in that is not a\nreal thing but it feels so real in that\nmoment\nit's being able to take distance from it\nand saying like that's just\nthe game and what would they realize is\nthat life is actually just one big game\nand you don't have to get bent out of\nshape that life\ncan do crappy things to you but this is\na big revelation that he had\nmost of what sucks about life is what we\ndo to ourselves when life does something\nto us\nbecause the damage doesn't come when we\nget a b the damage comes\nthe way that we respond to the b when i\nlose scuttle i haven't lost a league of\nlegends game\nwhat causes me to lose the league of\nlegends game\nwhen i run down mid and this is the\nshocking thing that i don't think people\nget\nis that most of what's ruining their\nlives\nis not the scuttle it's the [ __ ]\nrunning down mid\nand this is where things like you guys i\nknow y'all are hopeless\nbut this is what gives me hope i know it\nsounds crazy\nyou may not have control over the\nscuttle but you actually have control\nover running down mid\nand so you can actually win that game in\nfact\nit's probably pretty chances are like\nmaybe 51.49\nor like 49.51 like not in your favor\nafter losing to scuttle\nbut the way that we respond to what life\ngives us is ultimately what determines\nwhether we win or we lose\nand that's like really really bizarre\nbut i refer back to the studying example\nbecause getting a b it's like weird but\nwe get on this trajectory\nof like throwing and we just throw it\nlife\nand then we feel hopeless\nbut here's the crazy thing like so let\nme ask you guys when someone loses\nscuttle and\nstarts running down mid on a scale of 1\nto 10\n10 being completely hopeless and one\nbeing having all the hope in the world\nwhere are they where are they\nwhere are they oh in the game\nno like like on a scale of hopelessness\nin the context of the game or yeah in\nthe context of the game oh\ni mean obvi like hope like hopeless i\nguess absolutely right\nyeah so but the funny thing there is\nit's the hopelessness which causes them\nto run down mid\nit's the hopelessness which causes us to\nnot act\nbut the crazy thing is that the\nhopelessness\nis like kind of false like we know that\nin the context of league of legends\nright\nlike you're not actually like what the\n[ __ ] man you just lost 100 gold\nitem like we can still dumpster these\nshitties\njust play the [ __ ] game\n[Music]\nbut that's not what we do because once\nwe feel hopeless\nthen we don't see like in that moment\nwe're not able to see\nand what is it that lets us see danny\nlee baby\nperspective\nperspective hey take a step back man and\nthis is the other thing that wood that\ntaught\nexpectation leads to attachment\nattachment leads to suffering i'm like i\n[ __ ] you guys not if you guys go back\nand you read the poly or the sunscreen\nit's it's exactly what you guys said\nabout league of legends when i go into\nthe game\ni'm gonna get i'm gonna get to the top\nscuttle first or left scuttle or right\nskunk or whatever one of the scuttles\ni'm going to beat the other jungle\nplayer to it and then i'm going to go\nand i'm going to get the bottom skull 2\nand then i'm going to be 200 g up and\nbuy this item i'm a gank mid\nwe're going to roll these [ __ ]\nexpectation\nattachment now i'm going to leave you\nguys with one other question\nwho is more likely to to tilt the person\nwho goes\n2 and 0 in a game or the person who goes\non 2 in the game\ni think it depends on player themselves\nokay\nbecause like i mean there's games where\ni'll be like\ni'll be like 10-0 like hard smurfing and\nthen like\ni'll make one mistake and like we'll\nlose like an objective or something\nand i'll feel really bad i'll be i'll\nactually\nbe like pretty tilted but i mean i can\nstill bounce back and there'll be games\nwhere i'm just getting camped\nand i'll be like oh and five but i know\nwe can win and i know that like\nyou know the jungler's permatop we're\ngetting stuff on the other side of the\nmap\nlike you know it's like a balance like\nand there's some games like\ni'm just i'm just like completely\nneutral and i'll be tilted\nlike pretty hard and i know it's like a\npretty big spectrum for everybody\ni agree so yeah go ahead i think it's a\nlot more likely for the o2 to turn into\nan o10 than for the 2o\nto turn into 8.\nnot in that the 2o might not be\ntilted they might be tilted but still\ncontinue to try\nbut once you're 2-0 there's or once\nyou're o2 there's that level of\nhopelessness that settles in and the\nmore you die\nthe worse it gets okay if that makes\nsense yep\nso like if you go 0 and 2 so i i think\nthat there's a subtle thing there did\nsome i'm sorry did somebody else want to\nsay something\noh okay right so so i i\nthink that there's a there's a really\ninteresting thing there right so i i\nhear what you guys are saying i think it\nis like kind of a simple\ni mean it's a complex it's a complicated\nissue that i'm trying to turn into a\nsimple question to illustrate a point\nso i i definitely know people who go 0\nand 2 who feel\nsuper [ __ ] tilted\nbecause what was supposed to happen\ni was supposed to go 2-0 they're\nright and so here's the crazy thing so\nmost of chat seems to think that two and\no is more likely to tilt\nand why is that i think it's because\nonce you're two and o\nwhat do you expect to happen for the\nrest of the game\nyou expect everything to go in your\nfavor absolutely\nso when you're 0-2 absolutely when\nyou're 0-2\nand you get a kill how do you feel\nwhen you're two and 0 and you die how do\nyou feel\nlike you just threw absolutely right so\nit's about expectation\nexpectation is key what do you expect\nevery day when you wake up\nand the more that you expect the the\ncloser you are\nto the thing i don't know how else to\nput that i don't know if that makes\nsense and then you lose perspective\nand the more that you can separate\nyourself out the less\nmore expectation will melt away you can\nsee like there's no\nexpectation is about being invested does\nthat make sense\nlike i can expect certain things to\nhappen but they're not going to bother\nme unless i'm invested\ni can go into a game and i can be like\nokay i should win because this is a\nfavorable match up\nbut like maybe i won't\nand then you do well and so the crazy\nthing here is that when\nwhen it comes down to it i think that\nlike\nokay how to wrap up so like let me just\ntry to piece this together so i see\ni see a lot of this stuff around\nexpectation and perspective\nof gaining perspective and i also see\nlike some themes where i get that you\nguys are hopeless but i don't i'm not\nhopeless\nand that's probably just because i\nhaven't played enough league of legends\nand and the reason that i'm not hopeless\nis i think that you guys are hopeless\nfor the same reason\ni think there's some common element\nalthough your situation does sound\ngenuinely are we dropping what's going\non\ni think voyn then you just deceived\ngg he had to go next yeah gg go next\nnext stream gigi disco there's lots of\ntalk of gg go next\nwe lost voice uh anyway i forgot what i\nwas saying did you guys\ny'all remember sometimes i just started\ngoing and i don't remember exactly where\ni was\ni do that nope we cut out so i don't\nknow i was i was listening intently but\nthen\nyou're here i was listening but\nokay anyway i don't know what to say but\nokay let me try to get it back\nso i was talking to you guys about like\nexpectation right so\nthat the reason the 20 person tilts is\nbecause they have an expectation that\nthey're going to continue to dumpster\nand it's that expectation that actually\nscrews them\nbecause the second that you you tell\nyourself like oh i'm i got this [ __ ]\ni got this [ __ ] on lock that's the\nmoment that you open yourself up to tilt\nand if it's sort of like hey i've got an\nadvantage let's see if we can turn this\ninto a 3-0\nbut maybe they'll compensate and by the\nway like i'm worth way more because now\ni want to kill streak\nright so there's like there's like a\nrubber band mechanic built into the game\nthis is definitely not unlocked let's\nsee if i can dumpster these shitties\nso there's a big difference between i'm\ngoing to and let's see if\nanyway this kind of gets back to the\nsort of the last issue of like what do\nwe do about toxicity in league and i i\nhear that\nyou know hopefully riot does more\nthey're working on it sounds like pretty\ncool and hopeful\nat the same time i would be careful\nabout underestimating your own impact\nso one of the things that you kind of\nlearn as a therapist is that\noftentimes you don't realize like how\nhelpful you are\nlike if i if i'm working with someone\nwho's got bad depression they come into\nmy office every week and they're like\ndepressed every week what am i gonna\nfeel like\nam i going to feel like i'm doing a good\njob\nmaybe not\nso sometimes the most important thing\nthat you can offer\nsomeone is like your constancy\nin the face of hopelessness\nso i cannot underplay\nhow important it is that you guys do\nwhat you do\nbecause there's like there's a lot of\nvictory and overcoming hopelessness\nthere's something like wonderfully noble\nabout standing against it anyway\nright so you guys are on the front lines\neveryone except for cream\nso cream\na little bit behind us right so like\njust the fact that you guys show up day\nafter day dealing with the [ __ ] that you\ndeal with i don't think you guys realize\nlike\nhow important that is and don't\nunderestimate your inability to see it\nfor the lack of effect\nbecause if we listen to kareem you know\nhe's kind of saying three years ago\nthings weren't like this\nso oftentimes we as human beings don't\nrealize how profound of an impact we\nhave on other human beings\nwe don't see it but it doesn't mean that\nit isn't important\nand i've seen time and time and time\nagain that all it takes is like one\nperson\nto like transform something\nlike a community and in your case like i\ndon't know exactly what's going to come\nfrom this i find it hard to believe that\nanyone who's watching this stream\nis going to be more likely to tilt a\nrage at the end of the stream\ni have to say that something about what\nyou guys have shared\nand the perspective that we've gained is\ngoing to positively impact\nthings in in some way\ni just you know i don't i don't think\nwhat you guys say is rage inducing\ni don't think it tilts people more i\nthink it's actually like positive and\ninspiring\ni something tells me like people who are\nwatching have to\ngo into their league games at some point\nand like maybe\nrage a little bit less what do you guys\nthink about that\nyeah it makes sense um\nlike i had you know sometimes i get you\nknow hate mail\nor hate messages people will just hate\non me for some no reason like\ni haven't done anything to them i'm very\npositive and stuff so i have\ni don't see why they hate me that's why\nthey just\noh okay we'll talk about that in a\nsecond but\nkeep going i didn't mean to derail you\noh yeah\num usually you know i just\nignore those kind of messages but um i\ndid respond to one\ni i said i don't know why you hate me\nbut i hope the best for you\nand it was crazy because he responded\nback you know it's like why are you\nrequesting the best for me\nlike i'm making like i'm i hate you and\nall stuff but\nwow man thank you and he started being\nmore positive so i was like oh\nokay well that's cool i think he got\nlucky there bro\ni i know i got the person i responded to\nno but i i think so so does anybody have\nany idea why so many people hate chris\nyes let me know guys why do you hate me\nno there's no way\nwhy do you guys think people hate him or\ni shouldn't say so many people i should\nsay the ones that hate him a lot\nand take the time out of their day to dm\nhim\nwhat do you guys think that is\nand i think like maybe trying to spread\nlike a positive message or at least a\ndifferent message in their eyes that\nlike how you're thinking\nit's like different from theirs in a\nsense you tell them they're wrong or\nin a way i think yep it's terrifying\nso like let me ask you guys a question\nwe're gonna go back to the sixth grader\nwho's now in seventh grade and got to be\non a test\nand who's debating between do i stop\nstudying\nor do i study and then therefore i lose\nmy smartness\nand then like the person that that\nwho does that person hate the most\nit's the person who they perceive as\nsmart who they one day find out has been\nstudying\nright so i think i think chris the\nreason that people send you hateful\nmessages\nis because if they had chosen\ndifferently\nthey could have been who you are\nthey see themselves in you the thing\nthat inspires\nin my opinion the most vitriolic hate\nis when you see the person that you are\nmaking the choice that you didn't make\nbecause that's hard\nthe most engaging to the ego\nbecause i can't tolerate that because if\nsanchez does it that means that my\nentire life\nhas been a lie\nmaybe it's because the champions you\nspam\nyeah like cinch\n[ __ ] people watch\nuh chris's stream and then as a result\nthey're picking cinched in by games\nand they're losing\nyeah so [ __ ] you sorry man\ni'm trying to teach them the right way\nso any any kind of we've been running at\nit for close to\nlike an hour and a half or so a little\nover you guys have any like thoughts or\nquestions\num\nwell i guess what what you said about\nhow we do have an impact even if we\ncan't always see it um\nyeah it definitely i i definitely like\nappreciate and understand that like\nwhen like i'll get messy i'll get like\nhate messages but also get like\nyou know positive messages from people\nwould be like hey boy like just like\nwatching your stream like just seeing\nlike\nyou know how you how you are in game and\nlike how you don't give up and just\nkeep trying and and try to like rally\nyour team up and stuff like it\nit helped me out like not only in game\nbut also like\nin like other aspects of life which i i\npersonally\num i don't i don't really understand\nbecause like for me it's like pretty\neasy to like\nthink about win conditions in league and\nlike know like how we can come back in a\ngame even if it's losing and stuff like\nthat\nbut like you know translating that like\nyou're like you were talking about how\nlike we can like\nhave an example for like real life like\ntranslating into my own life it's like a\nlot harder right like\ni think in league like i can all it's\nreally easy for me like be positive\nbecause i understand the game and i\nunderstand like how we can win like\nwhat are the options like if it's\nhopeless then i'll be like all right\nwell maybe we lost this but like in life\nit's just\nit's just so so much of a mystery right\nand there's just so many unknowns and\nlike so much\nthat it's not like a game like in league\nwhere like\nthe rules are voiced what's the\ndifference between real life and league\nwhen it comes to you\num\ni i i don't know that's that's really\nhard actually\nsorry yeah so it's kind of a weird ass\nquestion does it does anyone even\nunderstand the question\ni get it but i i think it's such a\nlike a like a special case\ni i think uh like voy has put in\nhis life into the game so league in a\nway has become\nhis life you're damn right yeah\nso he says life is so much harder and\nthat's because boy has dedicated a\ndecade of his life to\nunderstanding league and voy how much of\nyour life have you dedicated\nto understanding life\ni probably stopped about a decade ago if\ni\nmy calculations are correct\nonly reason to me that it is harder than\nleague for you\nis because you have taken and i know\nthis is going to sound weird in\nvogue memes but you have taken your\nmassive\nintellect and dedication and you put it\ninto one thing for a decade\nand then you're saying oh [ __ ] this is\nso much easier\nthan this other thing well no [ __ ]\nwonder man that's because you've been\ninvesting in it for a decade\nyeah when you play like that\nlet me explain something to you guys\nlife is not actually harder\nthan games the big difference is we just\ndon't\n[ __ ] practice one\nlike we don't think about it we don't\ntry to improve\nwe don't do replay analysis we don't\nwatch streamers\nthink about someone that you know that's\ngood at life\nthink about someone that you know that's\ngood at league how do you learn from the\nleague player\nyou watch their [ __ ] stream how do\nyou learn from the person at life\nyou don't\nif they try to have a conversation with\nyou you run for the hills\noh [ __ ] he's good at life i'm a reject\nwho plays lol all day\ni can't interact with him\nlike this is the thing that blows my\nmind like i've literally taken\nlike these like cases so this is like\nsomething so i was in a class at harvard\nbusiness school okay\nand i had this case for a bunch of\n[ __ ] there were 100 physicians in a\nclass at harvard business school\nand they gave me this case study which\nis like a complex problem\nit's like a 16-page thing about\noptimizing revenue in a urology clinic\ni took i took this case to a group of my\ngamer buddies\nand i was like what do you guys think\nabout this\nthey work on it for a day tell me what\nthey think i go into class the next day\nand they're like what do people think\nabout the case i raise my hand and i say\nwhat my gamer buddies told me\nprofessor is impressed\njust turn your focus it's about your\nattention and your focus\nthink about the way that you play the\ngame of week think about all of the\nstruggles that you go through all the\nenergy you expend\nin streaming and you don't expend a\nfraction of that in the rest of your\nlife\nso like no wonder you suck at it but it\ndoesn't mean\nthat you suck you suck at it\nyou're not bad you just haven't invested\nin it bro\nlike that's what i'm telling you guys\nlike i invested a couple years of my\nlife into learning how i work as a human\nbeing\nand absolutely worth the investment\nwhere does desire come from what is the\nnature of attachment and suffering\nwho is more likely to tilt two and o or\no and two\nhow do you work as a human being\nlearn these things i think you guys\nactually understand a lot of stuff you\nall have a leg up because you all seem\nto be good league players\nthat means you guys are like smart and\ndedicated and if you just shift the\nfocus\nyou'll be amazed at what you can learn\nyou guys just don't know the vocabulary\nit's like like\nboy boy today's been to feels like [ __ ]\nfeels like [ __ ] feels like [ __ ]\nright and that's just because it's like\nwhat's like if i came to you guys and i\nsaid\nyou're like hey dr k how's the league\ngame going and i i'm like i lose\nlike why do you lose i suck then i play\nagain and they're like why'd you lose\nthat game i suck\ni suck you guys\nrealize like you don't lose a game of\ngame of league of legends because you\nsuck right like you lose a game because\nof all kinds of complicated reasons\nwhich no one understands because i just\ndon't i haven't spent the time with it\noh i don't know how to last hit i'm\nrotating poorly i bought the wrong items\ni had a singed on my team\ntop captain was good don't hate on the\ncinch\nright you see how easy it is to adopt\nthe toxicity i don't even know who is\nthat canadian on stage\ntoxicity comes so naturally\nbut boy boy dude and for the rest of\ny'all too and everyone watching at home\njust put fraction of what you put into\nleague into the rest of your life you\nwill be amazed\nbecause this is the thing that people\ndon't understand everyone thinks gamers\nsuck like i think gamers are the biggest\nuntapped potential in the world today\nno one gives them any kind of respect or\nany kind of responsibility\nthis entire organization was built on\nrejects healthy gamer built on rejects\nbuilt from people from our community who\nhe said you know what\nactually i don't care that you haven't\ngraduated from college\nwe'll give you a shot don't let us down\nand it's been amazing\nabsolutely amazing\nand so just take this dedication and\nlook at other parts of your life man\nand you'll be amazed you guys are\nbadasses y'all are giants in the making\nyou guys are already giants fighting\nagainst the hopeless hordes\nof toxic zombies who are hinting right\nand left at high elo which i hear is\nreally bad actually in league\nyou'd expect you know high elo to be\nlike less toxic but i hear it's bad\nand y'all are awesome\nand you guys are inspiring other people\nwhether you realize it or not\nand if y'all weren't there like imagine\nwhat would happen\nthe hordes would take over right there's\nsomeone somewhere out there who watches\nyour games goes into a league of legends\ngame and then decides to try to emulate\nyou\nand i think as long as you guys keep at\nit you may not see the change but i\nthink it'll happen\ngenerally speaking that's been my\nexperience if you study like you may not\nget a b right you may not get an a right\naway you may get a b for a little while\nbut you keep keep working at it and\nyou'll learn how to study you'll get\nbetter and you'll start getting a's\nyep okay oh yeah\ndanny i'm sorry you wanted to say\nsomething and then we'll get to kareem's\nquestion oh i was just saying like yeah\nonce\nyou know people stop trying i mean we're\n[ __ ] as long as people try\nto effort maybe other people put an\neffort to\nyep\nso if you try maybe you're [ __ ] and if\nyou don't try you're certainly [ __ ]\nkareem you had a question yeah i just\nhad a question\nrelating to um\nbettering yourself as a person and then\ntranslating that into league where we\ntalk about the analogy of the\nthe a student going into b what does\npractice or studying in that case\nlook like for somebody who is trying to\nbetter themselves mentally\nsomeone who used to be good mentally and\nthen finds themselves not good mentally\nor somebody that's just not good\nmentally and that's never been good\ntrying to\nget good so how do you\nget good when it comes to your mental\nright it's a fantastic question\nso the answer to that question is\nwhat healthy gamer is all about and i\ncan't answer it simply but i'm going to\ntry anyway\nright so i think honestly kareem\nthe foundation is awareness and noticing\nso the first thing to recognize is that\nso\ntoo many times do people especially\nwithin our community\nequate their value as a person with a\nparticular thing\noutside of themselves first thing to\nunderstand\njust because you're bad at life does not\nmean you're bad\nbut most people don't think like that\nlike if i can't find a date to prom what\ndoes that say about\nme as a human\nnothing incorrect\nthat's technically true and actually\ntrue but what do i think about myself\nboy\nthat no one likes you\nnot just that no one likes me that i'm\nnot worth liking\ndo you guys see the difference between\nthose two statements because there's an\nentire chasm\nno one likes me i'm not worth liking\nso the first thing preem is to\ndisidentify yourself\nwith your problem i'm not a bad league\nplayer\ni'm just a nude there's a huge\ndifference between sucking at league\nand being a noob which i know we equate\nthe two right like even in our society\nin our community\nwe equate the two but lack of experience\nis different from like talent or value\nso the first thing is that you may not\nyou're not bad at life you just haven't\nlearned how to live it\nbecause how have you tried so that's i\nknow that sounds weird but that's\nactually the foundation that's the first\nthing\nsecond thing is okay so fine i accept i\nhaven't learned how to live it\nhow do i learn how to live it and so\ni'll teach you guys how to meditate in a\nminute\nbut i'd say oftentimes the the biggest\nand most important foundation is\nawareness\nso you have to understand what is going\non inside you\nand the cool thing is like you can do\nthat any number of ways you just have to\npay attention so it could be something\nas simple as\nthe next time you play so cream you say\nyou're not like these positive\ndick wads here but like some days you're\nsuper toxic in league and some days\nyou're less\nless toxic and league right\nyeah sure so what's the difference\nthe it just kind of depends their\noutside um\ni guess variables and also depending on\nhow\nprevious games have gone it's very easy\nto sort of get caught up on\nsomething that's happened in the past um\nhaving one event in a certain game\ndictate the way that your mood is\nfor the rest of your games that day okay\nso like that's\nthat's a that's a decent answer but it's\nnot nearly specific\nright so you say so you have vague\nstrokes of like [ __ ] that happened in\nthe previous game affects me in this\ngame\nso then the question becomes if you want\nto get good at life you have to figure\nout\nwhat is it in the game that affects you\nwhat is it that carries over the next\ngame what is it that stays behind\nwhat has to happen for me to get from\npoint a to point b\nwhat are all of those variables and\ngetting good at life\nis about understanding those a simple\nexample\nif i don't sleep well what happens to me\nright so getting good at life is an\nunderstanding like how you function as a\nperson\nand that starts with paying attention so\nand here's a kind of a pitch that i give\nto people when i'm trying to convince\nthem to\nhire me for consulting so i'll go to\nlike a corporation or like a startup or\nsomething and i'll say\nwhat's the difference between a good day\nand a bad day\nwhat do you guys think so i'll go to\nlike a hospital\ni'll have a group of surgeons like 40\nsurgeons in a room and i'll ask them\nwhat's the difference between a good day\nand a bad day you [ __ ] up in surgery\ntoday\nwhy what do you guys think\ni'm actually not sure i don't know do\npeople have good days\nyeah do people have bad days yeah yeah\nwhat's the difference like let's just\nthink about this from the surgeon's\nperspective\nso you went through your training on\nmonday your training was let's say\n15 years and one day\nand you make a mistake and then on\ntuesday\nyour training is 15 years and two days\nand you do a good job\nhas your biology changed has your brain\nchanged have you lost dexterity\ndo you know less surgery did you forget\nsome surgery no\nridiculous how can human beings like\njust think about this for a second\nif our cars worked like we do as human\nbeings no one would ever [ __ ] drive a\ncar\nthat's true crazy\nand so what is this pile that we call\nhumanity\nlike how do we work no one understands\nthis [ __ ] what's the difference between\na good day and a bad day and everyone's\nlike i don't know but i have good days\nand i have bad days so why don't you\nstart [ __ ] paying attention that's\nnumber one\nthe next time you have a bad day try to\nlike ask yourself because this is the\ncool thing is you guys can actually come\nup with answers\nif you bother to try\nthink about how you guys learn learn\nleague of legends you took this thing up\nhere which is actually pretty badass\nand you pointed it at something and then\nas long as you point it at something\nyou're going to figure [ __ ] out does\nthat make sense yeah\nyou're going to get better you just have\nto point it in the right direction how\nlong have you spent pointing it at\nyourself\nnot much so point it at yourself that's\nwhat awareness is\nwhy am i having a bad day today what's\nthe best that i can figure out\nthen you experiment what happens if i\nsleep\nwhat hap how much did i sleep yesterday\nis there a correlation be scientific\nstudy yourself and the third thing you\ncan do is like\nread right so reading is good but like\nyou should use it to inform what you\nunderstand because the cool thing about\nthis is you guys actually know all this\nstuff\nright boy boy knows how it feels he\nknows it's draining the reason it feels\nshitty is because it's draining\nwhy is it draining because is karim put\ntogether i have two choices i can rage\nor i can learn\none is easy and feels good one is hard\none requires more mana\nso i want you guys to think about league\nof legends is like expending mana\nevery time you rage you fill up your\nmana bar and every time you control that\nrage\nyou drain your mana bar at some point\nyour mana bar runs out and then what do\nyou start doing\nraging absolutely\nyou guys know this stuff right so you\nknow what they call\nmana bar and regular people speak\nwillpower\nright so every day when voyboy logs on\nhe's got a mana bar\nwith a hundred points of willpower every\ntime someone\nputs a bounty on his ass he loses it\nit's not feeling like sure those\nfeelings and stuff\nbut this is a principle of science boy\nboy is a human being\nyou can only put up with so many\nbounties before you crack it has nothing\nto do with your\nstrength as a person your resilience\nyour worth but that's what it\nfeels like\nbut as a human being you have limits you\njust don't know what they are and\ndanny's got some of this [ __ ] too\nright because he's talking about\nperspective so buddha says\nexpectation is where suffering comes\nfrom\nthen there's this third principle of\nit's what we do to ourselves because of\nwhat life does to us that really screws\nus\nthis is the principle of two arrows life\nshoots us\nshoots one arrow at us hits us the\nsecond arrow is the one that we shoot at\nourselves because we got hit by the\nfirst one\nit's [ __ ] dumb but we do it all the\ntime\nright so like start to understand these\nbasic principles about yourself\nand look at yourself and you'll be\namazed at what you can accomplish\ndoes that answer your question sort of\nranted at you for a minute\nbecause it's a really complex question\nbut i wanted to try to give you a good\nanswer\nother questions\ni wanted to ask about meditation and\nhow obviously it helps and we all know\nthat it helps\nbut not to get too specific because i\nknow it'll take a while but how it helps\nand\nhow to use it um\nlike efficiently sure that actually is\nnot\ntoo hard of a question so when you say\nhow it helps what\nwhat kind of help are we talking about\nwe're talking about like tilt prevention\nright and keeping that mana at a hundred\nokay so keeping the man at 100 and tilt\nprevention are two different things\nokay so i know i know that sound\nso let me explain so let's talk about\nboth of them the first thing is\none form of meditation i'm going to\nteach you guys\ntwo techniques today um\nso yeah i'll teach you two one is going\nto help you with tilt\nactually both of them will help you with\ntilt and both of them help you with mana\nbut their mechanisms are different\nso in terms of tilt prevention how do\nyou feel\nlike what are the emotions that you\nexperience when you're\ntilting\nsad frustrated embarrassed\nsadjay okay right\nso what do you guys think is happening\nto your heart rate when you're tilted\nit goes up yep sometimes you have\ndiaphoresis or sweating\nright your body is activated you're\npissed you're angry you're in fighting\nmode\nso that i don't know how else to say\nthis but that is actually governed by\nphysiology\ndoes that make sense like there are\nthere are hormones that are flowing\nthrough your body that actually increase\nyour heart rate\nand make you feel angry\nso there are some chemicals that can\nmake you feel angry and other chemicals\nthat will make you feel sad\nor calm or whatever so the first thing\nis i'm going to teach you guys a\ntechnique called alternate nostril\nbreathing\nthat literally balances the two modes of\nyour central nervous system\nso your central nervous system so we\nhave two kinds of nervous system a\nperipheral nervous system which is all\nthe nerves in our hands and fingers and\neverything outside of the brain in the\nspinal cord\nand then we have this thing called the\ncentral nervous system which is our\nbrain and our spinal cord\nour central nervous system has two modes\nof operation\nit has a yin and a yang or\na surya and a chandra which means a sun\nand a moon\nor what's scientifically called a\nsympathetic or a parasympathetic nervous\nsystem\nand what that means that our body has\ntwo modes it has a fight or flight mode\nright so you guys can think about this\nas like stances\nso we have a fight-or-flight stance and\nwe have a rest and digestants\none stance is for activity one stance is\nfor like\nrecuperation so what happens after you\nhaven't eaten for eight hours and you\neat a gigantic ass burrito\nwhat happens to your body and your mind\nuh food coma absolutely right so how the\n[ __ ] does that work\nso what is a food coma a coma implies a\nmental function\nyou guys get that yeah so what happens\nchris in your mind after you eat a\nburrito and you're in a food coma what\ndoes that mean what does it feel like to\nbe in a food coma\nuh yet sleepy yup so why does that\nhappen\nbecause the parasympathetic nervous\nsystem is engaged\nso when we eat a big meal our body says\nyo bro we have a lot of this food in our\nstomach\nwe're going to literally divert blood\nfrom our brain our arms and our legs\nand increase the size of our our\ndiameter not size\nof arteries to our stomach and our\nintestines to digest this food\nand as a result you literally get sleepy\nit's because there's literally less\nblood flow going to your brain\nso on the flip side tilt is the opposite\nof the food coma\nyou feel angry agitated your thoughts\nmove fast\nalso your peripheral vision collapses\nfrom like\n120 degrees to 30 degrees when your\nsympathetic nervous system is active\nthis is what adrenaline does\nliterally you cannot see outside the\nsides of your vision when you have\nadrenaline\nalso does it cognitively so we see that\ncognitively when you're tilted\nyou can't consider things out here\nyou're just zeroing in on the scuttle\nand this goes back to what danny was\nsaying perspective you lose perspective\nliterally adrenaline causes a collapse\nof your peripheral vision\nand a collapse of your cognitive vision\nto only see\none thing it's a [ __ ] scuttle\nso there's actually a practice which i\ncan teach you\nwhich will balance those two nervous\nsystems it'll turn one off and turn the\nother one on\nand literally glad you're yawning boy\nboy\nthe other thing that it can do is it can\nbalance the other way too so what it\nreally does is it balances them\nso we're going to see and boy you should\nyawn if you guys feel like yawning you\nguys should just go ahead and i was just\ngonna say it\ni was gonna say i just didn't i just\ndidn't sleep much so it's not like i'm\ni wasn't like bored or anything i'm not\noffended don't worry about it okay i\nthink if you if you need to yawn you\nshould listen to the signals of your\nbody\nokay and you may yawn more so that's\nokay so we're gonna see\nso i think it's actually useful because\nlike if you're tired right now let's see\nhow you feel\nafter the meditation practice and you're\nallowed to say more tired if that's what\nreally happens that's okay\nso the first thing is to balance your\nsympathetic and parasympathetic nervous\nsystem there's another one that actually\nincreases your mana bar but let's start\nwith one\ndid that sound okay cream yep 100 okay\nso sit up straight\nokay so what i want you guys to do so\nyour back should be straight\nso the simplest way to tell if your back\nis straight is if your knees are lower\nthan your hips\nyour knees lower than your hips yeah\nif they're not you can sit on a pillow\nit'll elevate your hips\nand it'll move your knees down right if\nyou sit on a pillow\nbut anyway okay so i want you guys to do\nthis it's kind of complicated right hand\nthumb out\ntwo fingers if you go like this that's\ntotally cool don't worry about it\nyep awesome okay\nso then what we're gonna do thumb on\nyour right nostril plugging it\nblock it and then breathe in through\nyour left\nswitch so block the other nostril with\nthe other two fingers\nyep and breathe out\nin\nswitch there you go\nand out\nin\nswitch and out\nin and don't switch in\nswitch and out now close your eyes\neyes closed in\nswitch out\nand\nswitch out\nand now continue at your own pace we'll\npractice for about 60 seconds\nremember to breathe in switch on a full\nbreath\nand then out\nthen in through the same nostril before\nyou switch again\ngo ahead and finish the breath that\nyou're on\nlet your eyes remain closed\nand let your hands relax\nand now feel the person that you are\ntake a note of how you feel\nnotice that you spend a lot of your day\nthinking certain things\nfeeling certain things\nand that those things may just be\nquieter\nyou're still you but you're a different\nkind at you\nyou may also notice that\nfatigue could be returning you may be\nfeeling it more fully\nit's okay too just notice whatever you\nfeel\nwhen you're ready open your eyes\nhow do y'all feel\nthat was that was really cool\ni feel a lot i felt like during and\nafter like\na lot more relaxed um\ni definitely like pretty tired today but\nlike anxious as well and then i guess\njust\nyeah doing the breathing it was like it\nwas nice just like focus on that\nand just kind of not really worry about\nanything else for like a moment\nso it was there's a good feeling for\nsure\nso i'm gonna comment on what voy boy\nsaid for a second to teach a principle\nand then i'll ask the rest of you guys\ni want you to imagine how run ragged\nyour mind is\nwhen you never give it a break so much\nto worry about\nso much to think about so much to do\nyour mind deserves a break from time to\ntime and it can feel amazing\nyou guys know how long we meditated\ntwo three minutes two minutes that's it\nbro\ndo this [ __ ] for half an hour a day you\nwill be a different person in eight\nweeks\ntwo minutes you guys know why i don't\nteach\n30 minutes of meditation on stream\nwhy ain't nobody got time for that\nright\nright but what i want you guys to see is\nthe difference in such a small time\ni gave you guys a taste before we get\nyou really hooked\nother experiences\num go ahead for me it's just like a lot\nto process just the entire\nlittle session we had so you would take\nlike a step back and like\nget a almost get it like pull the whole\nthing out\nout of a hat like to focus on like\nonly focus on that instead of spreading\nyour focus to all the things\nwas what i got out of it\nso this is really important you guys\nknow\nwhy people get stuck it's because their\nfocus is spread\nlaser focus is what creates progress\nyou guys think about like y'all are\ngenerally speaking good law players\nright\nwhat's the difference between you and a\nbad law player\nwhen it comes to getting good at life i\nwould argue that the biggest difference\nbetween\npeople who are good at life and bad at\nlife is spread attention versus focused\nattention\nif we think about discipline what is\ndiscipline\nit's the restraint of your attention\nwhere you tell it to go\nthat's it so if you practice\nspreading your attention and focusing it\nyou'll like literally get better at life\nwhich is what the data suggests\nother experiences\num my mind feels lighter i guess like\ni was there's a lot of you know things\nto process like you're mentioning\nbecause there's a big topic so\nyou know thinking of all the stuff that\nyou've mentioned in the past and then\nafter the meditation i feel lighter and\ni can like take in more\nafter the meditation\nmaybe we should have started with it\ni've been a good idea yeah but that's\ncool right so like i think\nyou guys use this word like i i always\nask people how they feel after\nmeditation they say relax and it pisses\nme off a little bit\nwhat you are is so much more than\nrelaxed bro\nit's not like you just got a massage you\nknow like we talk about lighterness of\nthe mind like what is that\nit's actually like something very\nspecific like if we hear\nchris and he's kind of saying that my\nmind is now more receptive i can absorb\nmore information\nlike how opi is that just imagine if you\nwere studying\nand you were like oh [ __ ] i can absorb\nmore information now after\n90 seconds of this ancient himalayan\ntechnique and people would be like oh\n[ __ ] that's so op\nhacks\nbut yeah so kareem you were asking a\nquestion how do i get better at life\nyou start with things like this you\nstart by buffing yourself\nand doing things that are opie that\nother noobs don't have access to\nand then you crush them because you're a\n[ __ ] cheater at the game of life\nany last thoughts or questions for you\nwrap up sorry that's\nover the top\ni'm gonna try i'm gonna try the the 30\nminutes\nand see how i feel 100 yeah yep\nso can i give you guys a suggestion yep\nstart with two to five so remember that\nthe brightest candle burns out the\nfastest\nso you all are pumped awesome start with\nfive\ndo it a couple times a week don't sign\nup for one day\nyou're gonna do it every day unless\nyou're a pretty disciplined
