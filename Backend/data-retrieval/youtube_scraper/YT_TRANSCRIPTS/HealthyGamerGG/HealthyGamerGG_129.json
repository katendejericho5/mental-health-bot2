    "transcript": "now I think we should be good all right\nI think we're good\nnow um\nyeah one\nmoment so what what what so now your\nturn I asked a bunch of\nquestions before and and if we get if we\nget canceled again then we'll we'll\nwe'll have\nto I I guess then maybe that's the\nuniverse's way of telling me that this\nconversation needs to be private but\nyeah or something I don't know I don't\nknow so once again the third the third\nspace sometimes sends me\nsignals the signal we talking about like\nthe third space and like the whether\nthings are manifesting in the universe\nand like or like whether it's just in\nhere yeah and like this is what I mean\nman it's weird bro like I don't\nknow if this is cognitive bias on my\npart where I'm like looking at these\nrandom events and I'm making order of\nthem right so we know that like our\nbrain will look at like clouds and we'll\nsay like oh that's a feret but like\nthat's not a feret we we make we make\nsignal out of noise all the time is the\nhuman brain yeah it's CU we're pattern\nrecognition yeah right like humans are\nan amazing pattern recognition\nprocessing machine that is the\nsuperpower that we have hands down and\nsometimes that leads us to making\npatterns out of things that don't have a\npattern yeah pretty normal I think\nthat's pretty wrong with it 50% win rate\nbut also ghosts are creepy so like you\nknow yeah so what what um and sorry I I\nlost my kind of train of thought which I\nthink is perfect because now tell me\nwhat what what would your turn I I asked\na bunch of questions I think we've\ngotten to where I wanted to\ngo but so when you're talking about when\nyou're talking about not this not this\nwhat do you think this\nis what is the this to you uh so the\nthis is I'll give you like a personal\nanswer and then I'll give you a a um\nlike a more like academic answer if you\nwant so the first is this is\nexperience so if we look at like if we\nlook at the nature of reality okay so we\nknow that there's like a physical and\nnow we're going to like leave science\nbehind Okay so now we're like we're and\nthere's some maybe scientific stuff\nwhere people like to talk about the\nquantum but I I find that most people\nwho talk about the quantum don't know\nwhat they're talking about and they're\nlike just full of BS um but so so we're\nleaving science behind for a moment if\nthere's some science to be added we can\ntalk about that like we can talk about\nsome scientific correlates of what I'm\ngoing to say but if we if we look at it\nbasically like we think about the world\nas primarily material right so like the\nworld like is what I can see is what I\ncan touch Etc but there is a layer of\nexistence that is experience so when I\nexperience a thought when I experience\nemotion when I taste a strawberry sure\nthere are taste buds though there's like\ndifferent nerves in my tongue tongue\nthat go to my gustatory cortex travel to\nmy Thalamus travel to some part of my\nbrain where I experience taste we know\nthat all of that electrical activity is\nhappening but if we if we look at like\nthis is a little bit more philosophical\nnot my area of expertise so I'm probably\ngoing to butcher it so like there's this\nconcept of like qualia or qualia which\nis like the fundamental like\ndifferentness of different kinds of\nthings so experience is fundamentally\ndifferent from objects in the same way\nthat like matter and energy are like\ndifferent\nso that's where this is so the and if\nyou look at it like experience just like\nmatter so matter can be collected in\ndifferent forms okay so like for example\nlike there's this concept of a molecule\nwhich is just matter and then I can put\nmolecules together to make a cell and\nthen I can put cells together to make a\nperson I could put molecules together to\nmake a cup right so this is like Silicon\noxide and so like there's there's all\nkinds of stuff that objects can assemble\nbut at the end of the day it all breaks\ndown into\nmatter yep so experience is the same way\nwhere experience can be broken down into\nits its individual basic components into\nits Atomic nature and the third thing\nthe third layer is in that\ndirection now the interesting thing is\nthat generally speaking when we break\ndown matter into its constituent\ncomponents we tend to think about a\nreduction in\ncomplexity but there's this concept and\nnow we get a little bit more so I I I\nthink what that thing is is tapping\ncloser into pure\nexperience so that's the thing right\nit's not logical but it's absolutely\nexperiential like you feel it um you get\nbetter at it over time the more that you\nlearn and and so I I would say that for\nme that's where like I call them\nknowings so sometimes when I work with\npeople like in a more spiritual way like\nwe'll talk a little bit about a\nparticular kind of of spiritual practice\nthat I do that increases your connection\nto this\nthing and there are all kinds of other\nlike weird manifestations to this but um\nso this thing you know this third layer\nof stuff it's actually like kind of like\nthis infinite potential is the way that\nI would describe it so even any\nmanifestation or form is actually a\nreduction so if you kind of think about\nlike you know a blank piece of paper\nlike or actually a better example is a\nblock of wood so one of my favorite\nbooks is this book called in search of\nSchrodinger's\nCat and at the end of the book it's a\nbook about quantum mechanics and physics\nand I think it's like pretty accurate I\ndon't think it's one of these like you\nknow spirituality quantum mechanics\nthings I think it's written by a a\nphysicist and so you know at the end of\nthe book they have this beautiful\nanalogy that they're talking about\nthings like the particle wave Duality\nand they say that if I show you a block\nof wood and I say Thor your face is\ninside the block of wood and you're like\nthat's crazy and then sure enough like I\ntake a chisel and I take a hammer and I\nchisel away and we find your face look\nit was there all along so there's kind\nof this idea and physics\nthat you know the world gets shaped by\nthe way that we look at it but in its\ncore form it is\nundifferentiated so I don't really\nunderstand this stuff but there's some\nstuff about like you know the universe\nexisting is a probability waveform and\nthen the act of and then it collapses\nwhen you view yeah when you view it\nright so like\nand some people will say oh that is\nproof of this like Eastern concept of\nundifferentiated Consciousness that then\ncollapses into form Sanskrit which is R\nright so this thing doesn't have R\npeople also use it as a basis for saying\nthe universe is a simulation and part of\na computer yeah so I I can't comment on\non the physics connection to that I\nthink there it seems to make sense to me\nbut I'm not an expert in it so that's\nwhat this third thing is this third\nthing is and so the academic sense we\nhave a couple of different states of\nConsciousness we have sleep we have\ndreams we have\nwakefulness and then we have or sleep\ncan also be unconscious and then there's\nthis fourth state of consciousness\ncalled Dua Dua is a state of\nconsciousness without\nobject so the sense of self so right now\nas we go through the\nworld I am here and you are there so if\nI'm playing a video game like I am\nplaying the game and things are\nhappening in the game but even when I\nworked with like Esports teams we we\nkind of talk about becoming like a\nDivine incarnation of a player where you\nare one with the game and you'll see\nlike some of these players like make\nthese just amazing moves and it's like\nthey reach some Transcendent level of\nskill where I'm sure there's a\nneurologic correlate but when we talk\nabout how to do that consistent\nconsistently it is becoming one with the\ngame yeah so\nwe see that in other ways too like\npretty much any athlete or even even\nones like NASCAR you know like they they\nit's even funny because we kind of\nexplain that in certain audities around\nthe world where like you get in a car\naccident it's not they hit my car they\nhit me you know and that's so there's\nlittle pieces of that and other stuff\nwhich isting that actually is considered\na misidentification so we'll we'll talk\nabout that but so the the main thing is\nthat um so the closer you get to this\nthing the better you will be so even in\nterms of like flow state is like one\nstep closer to this thing because in the\nFlow State you said it\nyeah uh let me do this let me\num screen share with you hold on give me\na second give me a second I gotta I can\nsee it on the stream\ntoo uh no we're gonna do this you can\nsee this or no now I need to do this\nhold on\nI don't I it's going to get confusing if\nyou see the the\ndelay let's see I can see the\nstream okay yeah but the stream will be\ndelayed by a few seconds so so now you\nshould be able to see oh it's delayed by\na lot for me I got to refresh it yeah no\nno no no I just go to Discord okay cool\nI'm I'm gonna show them oh God what is\ngoing on now it's showing okay now we're\ngood okay\nso here's what this thing is so we\ntalked about you know oh\nweird Okay weird you're still off kill\nso small but okay we're going to have to\njust settle for that if I'm screen\nsharing we just pay the price you you'll\nbe stuck in the corner this this empty\nspace on the borders represents the\nnothingness that is deep within you okay\nso small\nyeah okay so so there's this third layer\nof stuff okay so there's uh there's\nStates of Consciousness that's what we\nwere talking about right so there's like\nwakefulness so this is where we have\nawareness we have\nthoughts\nemotions then we have\ndreams where we have mental activity but\nwe don't have\nawareness then we have\nsleep which we have no\nawareness and no mental activity\nand then there is a fourth state called\nDua where we have\nawareness with no mental\nactivity so even as we talk to you right\nyou say like this isn't it doesn't it's\nnot logic or emotion it's not actually\nmental your mind kicks in\nafterward and then does the work does\nthat kind of make sense like you can you\ncan have emotions related to it sure you\ncan be logical about how you implement\nit sure like that's the job of the Mind\nonce the signal comes from the Beyond or\nthe third place or call it whatever you\nwant toia then you'll have a certain\nmanifestation and then sorry then your\nmind will have to work with it do you\nfind that the first one can be described\nas a person who's very skilled being on\nautopilot even with very very difficult\nactions uh I would say it is the ex\nexact opposite of autopilot but it would\nbe as easy as autopilot yes okay does\nthat make sense right so it's not\nactually autopilot so autopilot is\nactually closest to dreams so even if we\nlook at the the term daydreaming because\nthey're not aware anymore they're not\naware so so awareness is the the main\nthing and the more aware you are the\ncloser you get to the State of\nConsciousness I think a good way to\ndescribe that then would be like you\never seen those videos where those\npeople are like chopping fish really\nreally fast uhhuh because they've a\nbillion times yes that's closest to that\nwhere they're not aware of the situation\nanymore it doesn't really matter right\nbecause they've done it so many times\nand they have like the mentals there but\nthey're there's nothing you know they\ndon't have to be aware of the situation\nbecause they've done it so much yeah so\nthat's that's something that I would\ncall autopilot and I would say that is\ndifferent\nfrom um so now let's talk about a an\nanother kind of layer so I would say\nthat's different from playing like let's\nsay I'm like performing like at a\nconcert\nso I think there's a big difference\nbetween playing the music on\nautopilot and playing the music from a\nflow State makes sense right so then the\nother layer of this thing is over here\nwe have uh let's call it Brahman so\nBrahman is the Sanskrit word for Cosmic\nConsciousness so there's this idea that\nwhatever this thing is in the same way\nthat like all atoms in the universe are\npart of of one physical existence all\nenergy is like\ntransmutable so also Consciousness which\ncan get localized so our body is a\nlocalization of atoms and matter and a\nlocalization of energy and a\nlocalization of Consciousness is what\nbasically will kind of create our\nego and\nso actually what we have over here at\nthe opposite end is aamar or ego so what\nyou will find is that when human beings\nare when their ego is is active they are\nless\nconscious ego is almost like an\nautopilot of your mind where you're not\nable to see things clearly you actually\nsee things not clearly because you very\nbiased right so we become so localized\nand remember this is like Cosmic so it's\nall over the place so ego is a localized\nversion of this stuff and then in here\nwe actually have some interesting\nscientific evidence of the Flow State so\nin the Flow State what we know is that\nthe self tends to disappear you become\none with the object that you're doing so\nyou're like in you know programming mode\nor you're in like Transcendent gamer\nmode or you're in whatever like even in\nterms of like connection so you can be\nin Flow State with another human being\num other examples of this are being\nabsorbed in watching a sunset so that's\nlike a really good one CU a lot of\npeople can relate"
