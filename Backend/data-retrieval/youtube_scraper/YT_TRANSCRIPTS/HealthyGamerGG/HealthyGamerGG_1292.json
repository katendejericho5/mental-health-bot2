    "transcript": "just uh a couple of quick announcements\nso we are actually like opening uh our\ncoaching program\nup on september 4th so really excited we\nhave we've had eight coaches that we\nstarted training back in november that\nstarted working\nin like april the coaches don't focus on\ntreating like depression or anxiety or\nanything like that it's more about like\nhelping you find motivation\nhelping you get unstuck helping you find\npurpose in life\num sort of overcoming unhealthy habits\nto like get\nunstuck so a lot of times that involves\nvideo games uh but other things as well\nand so the results seem to be like\npretty good and i'll share those in a\nsecond\num and so since it seems to be working\nand people are like getting helped\nwe're actually gonna like have more\ncoaches that'll go live on september 4th\nyeah so um welcome i i know we had sort\nof talked about talking earlier and it\nseemed like it just wasn't a great time\nyeah i mean it's been wild um yeah so\ntell me a little bit about\nthat or yourself or you know what you\nwant to talk about today\nand thanks for coming on um yeah thanks\nfor having me i don't know uh\ni'm pretty anxious right now especially\nthe weight like to get on the show so i\nthink i'll i think i'll do better once\nwe kind of settle into things\nyeah what are you anxious about just\nlike\ni don't know i lost i lost some i lost a\nlot of sleep last night which is\nprobably\ni mean no that's not good yeah whenever\ni have like\nthis is this i'm awake earlier than i\nexpected to be\nso i had like three separate dreams\nabout being late to this interview\nwell i'm the one who's late i was like\nyeah well\nthat kind of makes me feel a little\nbetter so it's all right it's all right\ncool yeah i just have an incredible\namount of scrutiny on me\nthat's like it's really stressful you\nknow yeah i've kind of become this meme\nuh and they're i've been harassed for\nlike three months\nstraight now like every day i get\nharassed about\nabout the the things like\nthat happened three months ago you know\nit was just like all the clips that were\ntaken there were like from\nfrom uh from like two days uh and\npeople haven't really heard anything\nfrom me since and i'm still getting\nharassed for it so i'm like that sounds\nhard yeah it's it's it's hard i don't\nthink anyone could act could be prepared\nfor it\nyeah i mean it sounds really awful to be\ncontinuously harassed for\ni don't even know what they would harass\nyou for\nlike uh like my identity\nlike they they want me to be fired they\nare\nupset at me being trans um they\nthink i identify as a deer i i don't i'm\na human\ni identify as a furry but um\nthat was one of the things like like\ngenerally generally how i see\ni i don't i don't think i said anything\nwrong\num and i'm willing to like challenge\nthat like i don't even\ni mean i have some regrets about like my\nphrasing for assumptions\nbut i think my head was in the right\nplace\num yeah for sure\nyeah for sure can i just lay out a\nlittle bit about like\nwhat this is and kind of like what we\ntried to do here\nyeah sure um so i i think steph you know\ni\nwe try to treat everyone basically the\nsame and and it's a chance for us to\nhopefully actually benefit from what\nyour experience is your experiences\nsound\nit sounds actually really awful in terms\nof being harassed and trying to\nauthentically represent yourself\nand either i mean turning getting\nyourself turned into a meme i think is\npart of the job description you know so\ni i don't know how much\nwe can really blame people for doing\nthat because that's what happens on\ntwitch\nyou know we're all meme farming and it's\nit's our greatest source of sustenance\nand at the same time it it does sound\nlike a lot of what happened\nhappens to you or what has happened to\nyou sounds really stressful\nand i'm just hoping to understand um\nyeah sure\nand and so can you tell us a little bit\nbecause i i saw like\nlike is part of you know i watched\nlike a very brief clip um but i'd love\nto understand more about like what it\nmeans to identify as a\nfurry what it means to uh you know like\ni\nlike please educate us because that's\nkind of this the stream is about\nlearning and sharing knowledge and like\ngrowing as a community from it\num if you feel like you want to talk\nabout the stress and stuff like that if\nthere's some way that i can help you\nwith that i would love to\nsometimes you know part of the aoe\nhealing of the stream comes from helping\nan individual person with something that\nthey're dealing with\num yeah sure and so if there's something\nin particular that you want to talk\nabout or some way that i can be of\nservice to you please let me know\ni think i think it might be helpful for\nme to talk a little bit about like the\ntimeline\nof my harassment and what i've been i'd\nreally love that because i really don't\nknow\nso okay so i got accepted i accepted\nthis position for the twitch trust and\nsafety\nuh the safety advisory council okay\num and that position is i'm one of eight\npeople\nfour streamers and we are\nuh we're supposed to talk to twitch we\nhave meetings with twitch\nwhere we kind of discuss and uh what the\nterms of service of twitch should be or\nthe community guidelines of twitch\nshould be and kind of\num put our perspective into the mix\nin terms of trying to advise like twitch\non what what direction\nthey should go with those things um\nwe're kind of just like uh\nwe're like a think tank like we're uh\num i'm not like i'm not twitch staff\nand i don't actually have any like\ndirect control over\nwhat's going to happen all i can do is\nput my voice in and be like here's what\ni wish would happen\num part of my blurb\npart of my blurb was like about about me\nabout you know the fact that i'm trans\nand\nabout how i um\nhave an opinion that voice chat in video\ngames\nis uh anti-inclusivity\nthat is a non-inclusive feature\num and and that's\nthat go ahead can you help me understand\nthat\nthat yeah so the idea is\nthat in a competitive game you either\nif you let me let me let me collect my\nthoughts a little sorry sure i'm like\nstuttering a bit\nand uh\nif you're uncollected i have a really\ngood tweet\ni'd love to hear you when you're\ncollected because i think you sound\ngreat right now\noh thank you that's really sweet\nseriously i'm not\ni mean i don't think you've come across\nas unclear at all\noh well you know i've been it's been a\nlong few months\nso i'm trying to be very deliberate with\nmy voice and like\nyou know it's very much unrelaxed to me\ni guess you could say\num where is that sounds like you give a\nlot of attention and scrutiny to your\nthoughts and how they translate\ninto words and i i mean it hasn't really\nbeen\nthat way like that's\nthat's that's the consequence of like\ni'm like running these simulations of\nhow are people going to\nspin my words and how are people like\nhow like\nand that and that's what they're looking\nfor too you know like people i feel like\npeople are looking to\ncause you know if they can frame me in\nan inflammatory way they\nbenefit with clicks um\nand that's like really that's really\nscary and that's the game that's being\nplayed like i haven't\ni think my voice has been twisted so\nmuch to things\nthat like because people\nare looking for ways to make me sound\nbad yeah that's frustrating\nso steph uh you know honestly what that\nsounds like to me is actually kind of\ntraumatic\nso like when when human beings you know\nchoose their words really carefully\nit's a sign that your mind recognizes\nthat you can be\npunished for saying a particular thing\nyep right and and so\nit's interesting because like that kind\nof scrutiny honestly reminds me of\npeople that i've worked with with trauma\nwhere they're so careful about what they\nsay because if they say the wrong thing\nor do the wrong thing they're gonna get\nhurt\nyeah i mean i i\ni i hesitate to describe\nwhat i felt as as traumatic because\neven that can be used against me you\nknow because because all of a sudden\num if i if i complain i'm doing it for\nyou\noh thanks i appreciate you\n[Laughter]\nthanks dr k thanks um\nokay so i couldn't find the thread i've\ngot a really good thread on it i'm sure\nsomeone hopefully someone just give us\nwhat you've got steph\nthat's all that i can do it okay yeah no\nproblem\num the idea is that voice chat using\nvoice chat is a competitive advantage\nin competitive games you if you use your\nvoice\nor you hear other people using their\nvoice that's like the that's like the\nmost\ninformation data dense way to\ncommunicate\nyou know tactical call-outs people love\nit it's like super important\num the the problem arises when you're\nplaying is specifically in pickup groups\nwhere you're with other random people\nand you're trying to climb a competitive\nladder\nif you speak they're they're you're\nyou're giving up your linguistic profile\nwhich is like\nit it carries so many identifiers about\nyour identity\nyour gender even if you have like a\nspeech impediment or a lisp or or a\nstutter there's so many things\nthat can um\nthat can can open you to\ndisproportionate abuse and harassment\nfrom from your peers um\nor from you know from the other people\nin the match and i think because of this\nbecause we have so\nthere's so many social biases against uh\nfemale gamers or\nsounding voices i think\nthat's one of the main reasons why you\nsee more\nmen in competitive team games and\nthere's a greater diversity in\nsingle-player\ntitles like like a woman won the\nhearthstone finals\nat blizzcon recently and\num but but you know it's harder to see\nthat diversity\nin in other teams yeah\nlike in in team games okay\nthat's really interesting um\nlet me just make sure i understand you\nso you're saying that like\nvoice communication basically exposes\nparts of identity that are\ndisproportionately\nreacted to in terms of like bias\nand toxicity yep yep\nand there's like it's not just toxicity\nyou know it\nyou also can have these like subtle\nbiases like your calls won't be listened\nto as much and that's like a\nlot harder to prove trump but just some\nvoices are less respected and\nthey've the person with that voice can't\nreally control that yeah so so\nand then you're saying that as a result\nsince some people's voices are\nmore or less respected than others we\nshould\ntake voice chat completely off the table\nfalse i don't believe that i mean that's\nthat's what people think i mean\nyeah that's what i think yeah sure uh i\njust think it's unfair\ni think it's important that we raise\nawareness that it's unfair like like\nsomething that we should talk about it's\nsomething that a lot of people deny\nand i think this the strongest thing to\ndo is to\ntry to increase the data density\nof uh other non-voice communications so\npeople\nthat feel like their voice puts them at\na disadvantage are\nat less of a disadvantage because they\ncan use pings and prefabricated voice\nlines\nand i see you know so so what you're\nsaying so thanks for clarifying right\nbecause at the beginning\nyou had said something about voice and\nyou know competitive\nadvantage so like you think voice chat\nshould stay in the game\nit's just we should be careful because\nsince there is a bias within the voice\nchat we can start to think about\nother more resilient\ncommunication methods that are less open\nto bias\ncorrect thanks for clarifying\nbecause yeah sure i mean that's\nsomething that's a little difficult\nbecause like i say that it's unfair\nand people i think people jump to she\nwants it gone\num but you know life is unfair there's a\nlot of unfair things in life\nand the best we can do is try to make\nthese uh systems more inclusive\nuh instead of like you know taking them\naway\nyeah i mean i i think i tend to have a\ndifferent sort of\nflavor there um i'm not\nnecessarily disagreeing with anything\nyou're saying i just think that if like\nthe problem is toxicity like\nthat's what you have to deal with right\nlike everything else to me feels\nhonestly a little bit like a band-aid\nand and begs the question like why do\nwomen in games get treated differently\nand like what's going on there\nand if we can figure that out and target\nlike the toxicity at its roots\nthen that's sort of that that tends to\nbe what i tend to focus on\nwhich is yeah i'm not saying it's right\nor wrong it's just as a\nindividual clinician like i work with\nindividuals\nand i tend to think about the individual\nlevel so how can we change someone being\ntoxic\nlike how can we change one person's\ntoxicity in a game\nand then i think because i think like\nyou said voice comms are awesome\nand i i felt like i kind of disagree\nwith you a little bit if we were talking\nabout\nhanding voice comms just because they\nare more open to bias\nbut your nuanced view i think makes a\nlot of sense\nthank you um it's interesting i wish\nyeah i i think i think it would move\nsociety and like gamer culture in\ngeneral if more women\nwere like winning competitive titles\nyeah and so i kind of see that as like\nthe goal is if we can make these games\nmore inclusive\ncan i toss out a troll we're going to\nsee yeah sure\nokay so like dates are all good but so\nthere's a troll inside me\nokay and you have to please let me know\nif you take this the wrong way but like\nyou know there's a troll inside me and i\ndon't actually believe this but that's\nthat sort of says like well if women\nwere better they would win more\nright and i don't think that that's\nactually fair but it's kind of\nit's an interesting i just noticed that\nreaction within myself and i was just so\nsurprised by that conditioning\nwhat do you think yeah i mean i feel\ni i hear that i've heard that troll a\nlot yeah\nand i don't think that troll is real i\ndon't think that like i don't think\nthat's the problem\ni think i think the troll is real i\ndon't think that trolls analysis\nthe problem is real right that's what\ni'm that's what i mean but the troll\neven within myself i was really\nsurprised to have that reaction\nbecause i'm such a understanding and\nopen-minded person but i have that troll\nthere's something inside me that's like\nkicking and trying to feel people\nand it's weird i mean it's a difficult\nit's a difficult thing to be\nin a competitive environment like you're\ntrying to play on a team\nwith four other guys and they see you as\na woman and\nand you kind of feel like you have to be\nbetter than your you have to you have to\nprove yourself kind of above\nand beyond your male counterparts for\nthe absolutely trying out for the team\nand like because otherwise like if\nyou're not demonstratively better\nthen they aren't going to take the risk\nwith you because you're gonna\nmake some amount of the people on the\nteam a little bit more uncomfortable\njust because you're different um\nyeah it's and and that extra pressure\ncan\ncan break you too because you're trying\nto be\nat the top point zero one percent and\ntrying to trying to\nbe better than is possible is is\nnot going to help you get on the spot\nyeah i've been\nthinking a lot about uh women in pro\ngaming\nand also indian people in pro gaming\nbecause there are a billion of us out\nthere and there's like there are no\nvery few indian programmers there are a\ncouple out there\nbut um actually maybe there are a fair\namount now that i think about it\nmay just be a bias on my end but i i you\nknow i would love steph i've been\nthinking about this a lot i would love\nto like take a a group of\npromising female gamers and help them\nlike handle their stress\nand like make it pro because if there's\nif yeah if you're saying that there's\nthere are stresses that are additional\nto like the regular stresses of going\npro\ni wonder how we can sort of fix that so\nthat like we can have more women in pro\ngaming because i\ni don't see a biological reason why\nwomen\nlike you know if the nfl it's a\ndifferent story or like yep\nyou know but in pro gaming i don't i\ndon't get it\nbut let's go back to the timeline um so\nyou were saying so yeah can you tell us\nabout the timeline sorry i went off on\nthe team\nno thank you it was a good tangent um\nso so that that that left a sour taste\nin a lot of gamers mouths because that\nwas like the first that was like their\nfirst taste of me is like steph's\nthis this this trans girl and she thinks\nthat\nvoice chat is bad and we need to ban it\num\nand then um and then some really really\nscary stuff started happening\nuh i got the attention of a really\na really scary website uh that i don't i\ndon't wanna i don't wanna say their name\num but they uh\nbuilt a like portfolio on me\nuh and they started working to doxx me\nand\num threaten my life uh\n[ __ ] yeah and they um\nyeah and it was it was super scary i\njust i all i could do was have\nmy i had some i had some my moderators\nlike watching the thread\num and just they just kept getting\ncloser to my address\nand they were just kept like and what's\nwhat's your understanding of why they\nwould do that what did you do to\nevoke this is it just that you were on\nthe safety advisory council\nor you made statements\nthey are a transphobic and\nuh white supremacist website they are\nanti they are they're like\nradically right aligned from what i can\ngather and they are\ni am i am their enemy by identity alone\nand so they were\nuh so um\n[Music]\nand that was just one those is one\nwebsite i saw\ni know of later or maybe around the same\ntime\num some of the chan boards\nwere were getting were were starting to\nlike\ntake note of me and um organized\nharassment against me\nso what does that mean i like harassment\nlike threads were made on these off-site\nwebsites\nwith the purpose of um trying to find\nand like like gather\ngather hatred against me and like send\npeople my way or like\nyou know how does that feel go ahead uh\nit's\num you know i've been streaming for like\nfour and a half years i've been out and\nproudly trans for the whole time\ni've faced a lot of harassment and it\nthis was a whole new level of like\nlike hundreds hundreds of people coming\nin harassing me\nmy stream was usually like a hundred and\nnow i was getting\nlike like several thousand viewers\nand i could not tell how many of them\nwere just there to harass me but a\nsignificant portion were there just just\nto hurt me\num and i think and it's\nit\nit's a complicated feeling um\ni want i really want to make a safe safe\nplace on the internet like i\ni've i\ncare a lot about the direction of the\ninternet is going and i\nand and i really want a space where\npeople\ncan become better people and all this\nharassment has made me question whether\nor not\ni'm capable of\nhaving and maintaining a space like that\nand and\nthat's that's been really hard it just\nit hurts it hurts a lot\nwhat hurts about it\nlike like i've been forced\nto change my behavior and i've\ncompromised on like\nmy what what i value my space for has\nbeen\nlike compromised against my control\nlike my voice has been taken from me and\n[Music]\nby your voice has been taken from you\nyou mean that when you speak out\nyou were met with a certain kind of\nresponse\nyeah that like well i've kind of i've i\nwell if i if i feel myself becoming more\ndefensive\nand like even just kind of interacting\nwith with trolls\nthat in a way feels like my voice has\nbeen taken from me because like my\ncontent\nmy my chat interaction has been taken\nfrom me\nbecause i have to i have to be something\ndifferent i have to react\nto this and i have to be in the mind of\nthese of these trolls i have to like\ntry to understand where they're coming\nfrom to to\ntry to understand them i can't just like\nnot read and assess uh\nwhat what's been coming at me\ncan i think for a second sure\nso i i have kind of a weird question and\nand is it like\nme please let me know steph if i ask\nsomething that you find to be\noffensive or challenging in some way i'm\ngonna sort of challenge a particular\nviewpoint that you've shared is that\nokay yeah okay\nso and this is just more for broader\neducation\nso a couple of disclaimers here so i had\na patient once\nwho kept on saying that people were\ndoing\ntreating him a certain way because of\nhis money\nand he's like oh this person is jealous\nlike they're treating me this way\nbecause i have so much more money than\nthey do\nit's like possible right\ncertainly possible and then at some\npoint like i started wondering like is\nthis actually like are you being treated\nthe way that you're treated because of\nyour money are you being treated the way\nthat you're treated because of your\noptions\nso like part of it is like sometimes we\nget judged for what we\nrepresent and sometimes we get judged we\ndo\nand it sounds to me like what you're\ndescribing is really scary and i don't\nthink that that's a fair way of judgment\ni mean if we're talking about people who\nare like\nlike truly transphobic and or hating on\nyou and stuff like that because of what\nyou represent\nthen that's there are people out there\nlike that\nwhat i'm curious about is that like i i\nthink a lot of people in our community\nfeel like they are judged because of\nsome attribute\nof theirs right like i get um like let's\nthink about the insult community for\nexample they say like oh i am judged\nbecause of this like particular\nthing that is outside of my control\nabout who i am\ni am a beta i am a simple therefore\ndot dot dot and what i'm curious about\nis like\ni'm not saying that these people aren't\ntransphobic or that they're not hateful\ntoward you because of your your trans\nnature but what i'm curious about is\nhow does someone know whether the\njudgment that is face\nplaced upon them is a genuine question\nokay\nhow do i know whether\nsomeone is doing something because i'm\nrich or they're treating me a particular\nway because i'm an [ __ ]\nhow does an individual like know the\ndifference of\nunfair judgment versus fair judgment\num\nthat's a really good question and\nyou have to i mean people have to reveal\nthemselves\nthrough context and i think if you if\nyou\njudge someone for like if i if i judge\nsomeone for being transphobic\nbefore they reveal that they're\ntransphobic\nthen i have judged them unfairly\nsure um but\nwhen several of my other harassers\nor say a whole scary website yeah\nthat's you know like i know some amount\nof my harassers are\nare transphobic are attacking me for the\nwrong reasons\num do you get attacked for the right\nreasons\ni don't\ni don't think so okay i don't i don't\nknow what i\nlike\ni think i think a lot of i think\ni've been by some by some people i've\nbeen framed in a way\nthat um\npeople hate me but if they got to know\nme they wouldn't hate me\nand i think there's some people that\nhate me\nand if they got to know me they would\nstill hate me\n[Laughter]\nso yeah uh\nand that and that kind of gets to this\nthis so there's\nthis kind of if you don't mind it's kind\nof a segue into timeline point number\ntwo\nwhich is one of my first my first\nstreams back\nuh i was trying to play celeste and it\nwas a mess i've\nwhat i did is i put my sub only mode on\nfor a while\ni'm confused when you said first stream\nback what what\ncan i lost you there oh like let's just\nsay the first stream since the trust and\nsafety council announcement it was\neither the first or\noh so so it was just the announcement\nthat got people\nlike targeting you just that you were on\nthe trust and safety council\n100 we're not even we're not even at any\nof the clips\ni've said i'm already i'm already\nharassed how are you and how getting\nchosen for the trust and safety council\ndo you know i'm not entirely sure i\nthink i\ni yeah i don't\num there's a there's yeah i don't know\nthe process i was just approached\nby um two lovely people okay i'm kind of\ncurious like can i toss that another\nlittle caller's thought\nand let me except if i overstepped in\nany way do you feel like i'm being\ndisrespectful or\nor anything it's not you've been fine\nokay and i'll i'll do my best to let you\nknow if yeah\nplease let me know so i sometimes find\nthat like challenging\npeople's assumptions is something that\nwe do on stream and just so we can\nclarify our understanding\nbut there's a part of you that says like\nyou know the trust and safety council if\nwe really want to understand like how to\nmanage twitch\nand if we wanted to be representative\ntwitch there's got to be a flaming in\ncell on there\nright uh\nyeah yeah i think that that probably\nwould have helped you know\ni mean are you being happy i'm really\ncurious what do you think you know it\nwas\nno i think that i would have helped with\nmy harassment i don't know if it would\nhave helped the\nwell i would have helped the council\nmore perspectives broader perspectives\nthe better\nand like yeah i have some\nweird well i don't know weird isn't\nreally the word i'm i'm willing to speak\nmy mind and have\nhave inflammatory perspectives like this\nvoice chat thing which is something i've\nstood up for i know i think that's part\nof why i was\nselected for this council is because i\nwill\nspeak my perspective and like that's\nawesome even i\ni feel like i'm guided by my own moral\ncompass\num that that\ni think it's awesome that you speak so\nthank you\nyeah thank you anyway so sorry for\nderailing you again so it sounds like\ntrusting the safety council happened\nuh you know the internet started going\nam i doing that right yeah yeah and if i\ncan be just a little bit salty\nyeah yeah go for it all\nthis this the announcement came\nbefore our first meeting um\nwhich i think is just it's frustrating\nbecause i feel like\ni feel like i i feel like it would have\nbeen more impactful if\nthe council had met a few times if we\nhad accomplished something if we could\nbring something to the table\nbut instead i think twitch was really\nexcited to feel like here's a new\ninitiative\num and it's just part of my personal\nphilosophy\nand i think a lot of other people's\nphilosophies too that like\nwhen you talk about something you're\ngoing to do or something you're working\non or planning like i think it\nyou're less likely to follow through on\nit because you're kind of cashing in on\nthe idea before it like reaches fruition\nyeah i'm with you 100 we literally talk\ni i mentioned that\nconcept on stream actually last week and\nand you know in in the hindu and\nbuddhist traditions there's this\npractice called\nmantra or mantra and it's like you chant\nsomething\nand but you keep it secret and one of\nthe key things about mantra practice is\nif you disclose your mantra to other\npeople it diminishes its power\nand that that's sure airing things\nactually diminishes\ntheir power which is useful in the case\nof trauma\nbecause you're airing things that are\neating you up inside and it diminishes\ntheir power to eat you up but if you\nhave something good and you air it out\nthen it diminishes its power and you're\njust kind of bragging and you're all\ntalk\nand no walk there's something definitely\nthere\nokay so so you were salty because this\nis kind of a sign\nyeah okay so then yeah so we went back\nto streaming\nit went back to streaming we went back\nto streaming and i'm trying to talk to\nmy chat\nand uh\num i i mean i say a lot of things in\nthat stream\nand i i mean that of course\nwell i'm just like i'm interacting with\nmy with my viewers i'm engaging\nwith my trolls i'm i'm saying that like\nthe volume of words okay\nthe volume of words i am producing is is\ngreat\nokay um which is kind of maybe the first\nproblem is that like\nnow people have their like pick of what\nthey can clip out of context\nfor me um and then the\nthe first thing that really goes viral\nis i say\nyou know i think a lot of you gamers are\nwhite supremacists\nand i think i think most people saw that\nclip\num and uh\nthat that was that was in response\nto to the previous i mean the stresses\ni've talked about\nand to you know comments of of people\num you know\narguing for ethnostates in my chat like\nit was like i was actually\nreading uh nazi ideology in in my chat\nroom at the time\num what's that but\nit's it's like it's like absurd\nit's like and i think that's that's\nwhere a lot of this like\nthere's like it's weird because it's so\ninflammatory\nit's so terrible and\na lot of people say that i stutter every\ntime i say a lot now by the way because\ni like crutch\non the word a lot like i use it a lot\nfor me to mean like attention you know\num and uh\nsome people love to speak\nthey they use they use nazi symbolism\nand speak nazi ideology\nto get a reaction they like to they do\nthat to troll and i'm\ni'm willing to i'm willing to think and\ni want to think\nthat the majority of people um\nthat are using like say say nazi words\nand use nazi\nsymbolism are doing it to troll and\ndon't really believe it\nbut i also know that some amount\nare serious and\nwhen you leave room for jokes you\nleave room for people to be radicalized\nand like actually get exposed\nto these interests right ideas yeah\nevery joke and you know it kind of it's\nkind of\nit's like a weird spectrum and it kind\nof percolates up to this idea\nthat i think the most mainstream kind of\nuh uh ideology\nhow i don't know\nwords um this idea that some people\nin society are like invalid of existing\nin that society\nand people um feel this\nin different ways but like like there\nare plenty of people that think\nthat disabled individuals should just\nnot exist like if you can't have a job\nif you're poor if you're on welfare you\nare\nbetter off dead uh and and i think uh\nway too many people believe this either\nconsciously or\nsubconsciously um and there's lots of\nreasons why they do\nand i think it's really it's really\nscary and that's something that like\ntrans trans people face all the time i\nmean one of the largest things i hear is\nthat i'm\nmentally ill and therefore should kill\nmyself um\nsorry i should have i feel like i should\nhave had a content warning before saying\nthat i forget there's like a chat and\neverything here\num i'm confused\nuh a casual reference of of suicide is\nuh can be a bit much for people i guess\nokay\nand not i guess it is um\nso uh but i mean i hear that a lot and\nit's\nit's\nthis so and anyway i guess i just went\non another tangent\num\ni think they give us a lot of color\num i'm kind of i'm kind of curious you\nknow it's interesting because you say\nlike\nsome people talk about other people not\nbeing allowed to exist i wonder\nso it's i i've certainly seen that in\nterms of hatred towards a particular\nethnicity\nor gender identity or or sexuality or\nwhatever\ni'm curious what do you think about\nnazis should they be allowed to exist\num i think\nthere is a paradox of tolerance that\nto be tolerant you need to be intolerant\nof intolerance um\nsome real five-head stuff dude\nyeah it's interesting so uh\nyes i would say um but you know i think\ni think we should judge each person um\nkind of on their impact on others and if\nif someone is\nhurting many other people um i don't\nthink they should like not exist but i\nthink they should get help and they\nshould\nbe in a place where they aren't able to\nhurt as many people or\nyou know de-platformed for example\nthey should be deep platform yes yeah\ni'm with you\nokay thanks for it was that an okay\nquestion yeah\nyeah i think it really helps me\nunderstand kind of what your viewpoint\nis\num okay so kind of going back to the\ntimeline so it sounds like you started\ngetting a lot of hate\nthen you made this statement that most\nare you gamers or\noh you did it okay but see see\nthat's you you did the thing where\npeople think i said most gamers\nare white supremacists or all gamers or\nthe majority of gamers\nbut the actual quote is i think a lot of\nyou\ngamers yeah so so if you pay attention\nto what i did i\ntossed out two or three different\nphrases because i wasn't sure exactly\nwhat the quote was\nuh-huh so i said you gamers or most\ngamers or i was going to ask you\nactually like what was the actual shirt\nagain\nsorry to interrupt you but uh i mean\nit's just that's like here all the time\ni mean like\nlike when when i enter a new room or\nsomething and people\num this this is an anecdote from vr chat\nactually i'm on vr chat quite a bit\nuh i had a uh you know people sometimes\nfigure out who i am\nand they're like oh my gosh she's the\none she's the one that said all gamers\nare white supremacists and i'm like\nno i was i was just trying to call out\nsome of the people in my chat like i was\ntrying to\nsay how i saw it two people in in my\nchat\nand and uh but because i used the word\nphrase a lot\nuh i was i opened myself up to the\nsubjective\nidea of what a lot means and that\nthat gave people the power to write\nand create hate content that made it out\nthat i\nthat i thought most gamers or the\nmajority of gamers\nthen that like permeated this like\npublic consciousness that like i\nhad said most many or all\nyeah and and just to be clear so i want\nto point this out so\ni i think that's just what happened\nbetween you and i\nright so like i said you said you gamers\nor most gamers and maybe the vaude will\ncrucify me but i think\nwhat i'm noticing is that you picked out\na particular thing that i said\nand judged my statement based on that\npiece of it which is normal\nby the way does that make sense right\ni was stumbling along trying to recall\nwhat exactly your phrasing was right and\nso i said something like i think in\nthe vaude show maybe it's a perception\nof memory error on my part but i was i\nremember\nkind of thinking what i thought in the\nmoment was like i don't remember exactly\nwhat the phrasing was like you or most\nand the second i said most your mind\nkind of picked up on it and then you\nkind of jumped in and you said you see\nyou just did it\nand to which i would say yeah absolutely\ni may have done that\nbecause i my perception could have been\nincorrect i may have just\njudged you based on an i may have made\na nuanced argument collapse into a\nsimple judgment\nbut at the same time i think that's\nexactly what you did to me\nbecause i was actually looking for the\nright word and then what your mind\nlatches onto which is normal by the way\ni'm not trying to blame you for it\ni think it's just a really common\nprinciple that we tend to do\nwhich is part of the reason why the\ninternet is the way that it is is that\nonce we get burned by something we start\nlooking for it\nwhich is like normal like so like it's\nevolutionary that if i get bit by a\nsnake\ni'm going to be paranoid about ropes\nyeah and but yeah there's a there i\nthink there's a significant difference\nbetween saying\nthere's a lot of white supremacists in\nmy chat which isn't i mean that isn't\nthe\ndirect quote but just just for for\nexample to say there's a lot you know\nthat can that can mean that can mean 10\nlike 10 is a lot\nbut when you when you change that\nphrasing to\nmost most absolutely\nmore than 50 more than 50\nand it also becomes something that's\nlarger than my chat itself\nwhich is important for for like framing\nhow\nhow people have been attacking me what\ndo you mean by that\nit means it's it's been it's it becomes\nsomething that i'm not just referring to\nmy chat anymore\ni'm referring to all gamers got it\num so yeah i i i'm sorry for jumping on\nthat\nbut it is no no i think it's good that\nyou did i think it's fine\ni think it's normal to jump on it\nbecause i've been trying to defend\nmyself\non this since the start it would be a\ndifferent thing if i misspoke\nif i said most but i didn't and i think\nthat there's a huge difference\num and i think a big part of why people\nhave\nbeen attacking me is because they\nthink on a personal level that i have\ncalled them\na white supremacist unfairly\ni see um and what is it like\nto be\nso misunderstood or being judged for\nbeing judged in for something that you\ndidn't say\num it is exhausting in a word\nit is i have to\ni'm constantly trying to correct myself\nand\num it feels like my voice has been taken\naway\num if you've watched a youtube video\nabout me\nuh any anyone in my chat i'm sorry i\nsaid my chat this is a reflex your chat\ni'm not stealing your chat okay\ni like the way you said my trolls\nearlier like it's like you have these\nlittle\ntrolls hanging out in here\nit's not my chat it's not your chat\nstuff it's twitching right\nyeah that's that's that's the truth if\nany of y'all have seen a video\nof me no no not a single one of those\nyoutube creators\nasked for my opinion asked for my voice\nor properly looked into context for me\nnone of them cared to hear\nme um they wanted to make me look as bad\nas possible\nto generate clicks and revenue for\nthemselves\nor they just were trying to\nyou know do the best job they could i\nmean i guess that's\nthat's that's the most kind way i could\nsee it\num but even then i don't think they did\na very good job because they didn't\nlisten to me or hear me out\nyeah so steph there's something that i'm\ntrying to like understand\nwhich is like there's something oh god\nthis is gonna get so taken out of\ncontext\nthere's something like incredibly juicy\nand succulent about you as a target\nlike there's something about either what\nyou say or what you do or your\nappearance or your identity i don't know\nwhat it is\nbut there's something about you that\npeople like seem to really love to hate\nwhat's your understanding of that\ni think i am unashamed to be\nauthentically me\ni am different i\num i mean\nah jeez if we move down the timeline you\nmight you might understand a little bit\nyeah\nso let's do that then maybe we can table\nthat question we'll get to our answer\nsure um\nsorry steph i keep on derailing you from\nyour timeline i really oh i\ni'm i'm i'm i'm i'm here it's great this\nis great we're like going through it\ntogether\nand i like that we're doing this in like\nchronological order it's\nit's nice um so\nwell the thing is i was\ni was a little bit i guess provocative\nis the word on my on my next stream\num because i was frustrated uh i was i\nwas frustrated that i was being taken\nout of context\nand that kind of thing um\nand uh people were were spreading this\nthis misinformation\nthat i was i was a deer or i believed\nthat i was a deer\num uh i am i'm\ni'm just a furry i think that it\nit's uh\ni am like\ni'm trying to i'm trying to describe\nthat uh because furry can mean a lot of\nthings but i feel\ni've in general i feel very welcome in\nthe furry community especially the furry\ncommunity in vr chat\ni have an affinity for for gear i think\ndeer are really cute\nand and pretty they make me go aw a lot\nuh on some level i wish i had fur and a\ntail\nlike like if i could choose my body if i\ncould be like\nsome kind of avatar uh you know i would\nin a transhumanist kind of way like i\nwould love to make those modifications\nwhat does that mean right i still don't\nunderstand what a furry is and i\ncertainly don't know what transhumanist\nmeans uh transhumanist is like\nif you like it it can be a furry thing\nbut maybe it's more easily\nunderstood as like kind of like a\ncyberpunk\nfuture kind of way would also be\ntranshumanist so the idea like i wish i\nhad a mechanical arm that did\nall these things or if i if i had the\nability to have a mechanical arm\nthat had had special powers like deus ex\ni would do it or um i have\ni have a friend who uh\nis so like becoming a feels like she's\nin\nyeah like becoming a cyborg you're like\nis that a transhumanist\nyeah okay so someone has like a\nprosthetic leg does that make them\ntranshumanist\nby by some by some definitions yeah i\nwould okay\nso is someone who's transhumanist no\nlonger human\nor what does that mean no\nno they're like they're like upgrading\ntheir their biological\nthey're still human but they're like\nupgrading their form in some way\nthey're like yeah it's like it's like a\ntransformation into something better and\nlike an idealized transformation\nwhich um you can see there's a there's a\nlot of overlap\nwithin the trans community and these\nthese other things you know we\ni i i've transitioned i have\nyou know which is largely because i have\na preference for estrogen it works\nbetter for my brain\num but it's like\nchanged my physical form and that kind\nof thing and\num in a way that is\nah i really i don't i don't have i don't\nhave like super nuanced uh\nanswers to your questions but i hope you\nknow where i'm getting that with that\nwell yes okay can you tell me what it\nmeans to be a furry\ni think i don't want to represent the\nentire furry community\ni don't i don't want to like i\nespecially don't want to misrepresent\nthem\nbut i think to be a furry you would you\nwish your body had\nanimal attributes um\nhold on like ish\nyour body\nhead\nokay keep going thanks for pausing uh\nlike\nlike fur or a tail and i think people\ncan have\nlike uh dysphoria about that too um\nlike you know feeling like they should\nhave a tail\nor they are sad that they don't have one\netc uh there's also furry\nfurry feelings of like uh furries\nin my experience are also and kind of\nmyself included are trying to be\nkind of more uh in touch with\ntheir natural animalistic side like kind\nof i guess the\nthe inverse of being civilized like\nwhatever whatever you feel like\ncivility is you know do we really need\nthat\ncan we just make yeah primal primal\nnoises\nprimal primal expressions of emotion and\nthat kind of thing and trying to get in\ntouch with that is also\nuh something that you see in the furry\ncommunity\nokay um and the furry community is also\nlike uh\nis is kind of like a safe space and and\nin for for queer people and a lot of\nqueer people go to the queer community\nin the queer community\nlike the queer community and the furry\ncommunity are very\nvery intermax in intermingled because\nthey're both\nsocietally like outcast in in some\nregards they're\nallies the enemy of my enemy is my\nfriend\nyeah yeah and what is it what does it\nmean to be clear\nuh queer is\num you know that's\ni don't think i've ever been asked that\nand and it should be an easy question\nbut it's uh it's it's a lot of things to\nbe queer to me is like\nit's like the largest of the umbrella\nterms like if trans is an umbrella\nand and gay is an umbrella like queer is\nthe umbrella of umbrellas\nso what is it an umbrella for uh\nany sexual or\nuh any sexuality or identity\nor gender identity that is outside of\nthe norm\nnor meaning heteronormative and cis\ngendered hetero\nyeah yeah right\nokay so so\nqueer is anything that is not\nheterosexual\nor assistant straight yes cisgender\nheterosexual correct thanks thanks for\nclarifying some of these terms because\nlike yeah\nmy definition of queer comes from the\ntoxic internet\nwhich is that it's something that you\ncall your teammates when they disappoint\nyou in video games when you make a\nmistake\nright right right that's not and yeah\ni i personally i don't consider queer\nslur i think it's\nit's just a lovely large umbrella yeah\nyeah\nsome people said what i'm saying is that\nlike the reason i'm asking for a\nclarification is because\nwords get used a lot by people who\nmean something entirely different like\nwhen i feed in my lane and dota my\nexperience of the word queer is that's\nwhen i get called\nbut that's not i don't think that's what\nit's supposed to mean\nand i actually really appreciate you\nredefining what the norm is\nbecause i think it's better for people\nto say that you know\nuh yeah so thank you yeah i'm with you\nthere\nyou're you're welcome i suppose it's the\nright answer\num so so when when you kind of say like\nwhen you identify as authority and i get\nthat you don't represent the entire\ncommunity because i think a big part of\nwhat we do here is that\nthe assumption that we're talking to one\nperson right and and what we try to do\nhere is understand\nwhat about this person or what about\nthis conversation applies to me like\nthat's the whole\nfoundation of aoe healing that we can\nhave one conversation with an individual\nperson\nsomething about that person can resonate\nwith everyone else who's watching\nso can you just tell us what it means to\nyou to be a furry\nuh yeah well i would like to get more in\ntouch with my\nwith my primal side i think when i'm\nreally comfortable i make a lot of\nuh immediate like impulse\nnoises to emotional stimulus um\nespecially when i'm feeling safe and\nthat's something i want to foster and\nget better at because i feel like that\nhelps the people i love understand me\nand\nand like know know how i'm feeling like\nimmediately i feel like\nstuff like that we've we've lost um\nand but does that make you different\nfrom other people\nlike making primal noises when you feel\nemotionally safe isn't that like just\npart of being human\nor am i missing something there i think\nthat's that's it i think it is\nbut i think a lot of people repress that\nso i don't think that necessarily makes\nme afraid but like maybe it makes me\na human furry in the sense that like\ni am uh trying to be more of a human\nanimal\ninstead of like this civilized\nyou know idea of what a human should be\nokay interesting okay that that's\nhelpful so you think like a lot of\ncivilization is\nrestrictive yeah yeah\nand we engineering underwear instead of\nfreaking\nyeah sure so totally totally\nyeah and uh well and i think a lot of\nthese systems like\nit's it's a shame i i think a lot of\npeople are more\nhave are way more beautiful than they\nknow and they're they are trying to be\nsomething else\nthat is not themselves and i really wish\nto inspire authenticity into people\num and that's something that like is\nsomething i like about being trans you\nknow um\nbecause my my off i wear my authenticity\nin that sense like i know i'm trans\ni know i'm a woman like i know this\ntransition was right for me\num and hopefully that can help inspire\nother people to\ntake on whatever whatever transition\nthey're looking for in their life and\nlike\nand make make the change to be more them\ni know we have a timeline to get through\nbut man do i have so many questions so\nlet's do the timeline\nand then i would love to hear your\nperspective about what it means to be\ntrans and how would someone know if\nthey're trans\nbut let's get to the timeline can i\ntable that get to that\nyeah okay yeah okay yeah so\nlet's go um\nfinish the timeline i mean it's ongoing\nwe got it\nokay i mean we've gone for two days\nor so like two or three days okay i'm\nnot going to respond\ngo i should stay silent i shall let you\nreclaim your voice\nstaff oh thank you you've been you've\nbeen you've been great dr k\nthank you so much for having me on um\nso okay i mean that is sort of\nauthoritarian isn't it i will let you\nreclaim it once\ninteresting right as if it's mine to let\nyou yeah\nthe very opposite of anyway i promise\ni'll be quiet\nlet me just put it back you know you\ndon't have to be where\nwhere were we okay so uh yes there's the\nsecond comment\nand then yeah day three so i get a\nlittle i get a little trolley on\non the third the third event and this is\nthis is something i kind of regret\nand i was talking about people taking\nthings out of context\nand i was trying to make a point uh like\na\nlike a tangible point about how things\nare taken out of context and i\nsay that like i i preface what i'm about\nto do\nwith you know watch this get taken out\nof context too\nand then i say something along the lines\nof\nuh like i'm a deer i think i'm a deer i\nlove to prance outside my backyard\nand eat grass and and then i say okay\nlike that was a joke like i don't mean\nthat and of course\nof course i knew what was going to\nhappen\ni poked it anyway i poked that universe\nanyway and i just let it happen\ni made it happen but in a way it was\nempowering\nbut in a way it was totally the wrong\nwrong thing to do\ni don't i still don't know i kind of\nmaybe things that are empowering are the\nwrong thing to do\nyeah yeah\nso what happened everywhere\neverywhere some like prominent some i\ndon't i don't want to like\ni don't i don't want to shout out some\nespecially some prominent like\nright-wing personalities especially a\nspecific\nuh very popular radio talk show host\naired that clip on on their show\ntalking about how ridiculous the\nleftist media and twitch has gotten to\nhire\na person who believes they're a deer on\ntheir\nuh advisory council and uh\noh my gosh i underestimated how\npoor journalistic integrity is these\ndays\nbecause if anyone had looked into it\nright if anyone had you been i'm like so\nsteph i don't think you underestimated i\nknow i'm supposed to shut up but i can't\nhelp myself\nyou don't underestimate journalistic\nintegrity you\nyou underestimated the succulents\nof you the succulents of me\nthat's the best word you just you just\ntitled my autobiography\nright like i mean you can't give the\ndankest\nmemers in the universe\nsomething so juicy it's not it's not\nabout journaling like what do you think\nthese people are right\nyou're right you're right dank is so\nsweetest\nhighest quality it's delicious it is i\ngave them what they want to say\nyou gave them exactly yes i gave them\nexactly what they can't expect them not\nto eat it come on\nbut at least i said at least i said like\nyou're gonna eat this\nyou know at least no way like that gave\nme that gave me some strength to be like\nyeah you want this\nboy do they want it they do\nand then okay so what happened next\nuh i mean that's oh\nokay and then and then kind of\nsimultaneously\num this is i'm just getting into more of\nmy like\noh yeah so that's that's event two out\nof three if there's a third event\nthat i think i have i have you know in a\nlittle bit of a way avoid it because\nit's\num it's more it's more personal\num but i reached the top\nof live stream fails\noh yeah multiple top\nlive stream fails finishes thank you i\nactually maybe there's a speed run\nany percent\nfirst place or so i guess it's 100 uh\nlive stream fails um for some really old\ncontent of me getting head scritches\nby my lovely partner\num and making i was\nit was it was a cozy stream it was\ndisclaimered and it was mature\nalthough i don't believe i i\nnothing about it was sexual um where\ni was lying on some pillows just here in\nthis room\nand my partner was giving me gentle\ntouches on my on my scalp and head and i\nwas\ntrying to be as primal as possible and\nand making noises of enjoyment um\ni that was never sexual i was i was\nnever aroused\nit was just an intimate moment between\nme and my partner that i wanted to\ndemonstrate for the world\nuh but that became the infamous\ndeergasm um that was\nhigh quality juicy cringe content for\nthe world\num so thank you for your noble sacrifice\nstuff\nyou know i hope i know i i i can't not\neven i hope\ni know i know i know it awakened some\nthings in some people\nyeah damn right it's okay yeah yeah\ni wonder about like you know all the\ndeergasm whether that's some amount of\nprojection\nwhich is when they insert their own\nfeelings into what you see in another\nperson\njust kind of curious definitely and\nit's like you know it's like wow\ni don't know like that it's just so\nclearly not an orgasm\nby like my like but\nit's uh it's just\nit's funny it's funny in that way it's\nfunny in that way because\num i think it's obviously not an orgasm\nor anything sexual\nbut i think to the uninformed eye or\nmost of twitch has never experienced an\norgasm so they don't know what one looks\nlike\nthank you dr k i didn't want to say it\nit's too easy it's too easy deep within\nme is a troll as well and i just can't\nhelp\ni can't help myself sometimes it's the\nbait is just too succulent\nbut that's me\nso so what happened after that\num well that's that's\nthat's uh that's like the whole reason\nthe internet's mad at me dr k\nwe're we're like we're there and we're\njust three months later i'm seeing\num i see a lot of yeah i see a lot of\nsubtle death threats\nuh there's a lot of there's a lot of\nthere's a lot of people\nposting deer hunter memes you know if\nyou're a deer\nthen it's illegal for me to kill you in\nhunting season i've heard that probably\na close upwards of 500 times um\nand there's been some serious\nserious death threats uh my that's\nterrible\nmy address has been leaked i have been\ndoxed\num i want to move i want to get out of\nhere because\nit just takes one person to want to come\nand kill me\nto kill me and you're not\nsaying a lot of scary stuff but you're\nsmiling a little bit\nyeah because i'm trying to like channel\nthe absurdity of it and trying to make\nlight of it and you know everything's\nkind of a joke to me\num i mean that's it's just a coping\nmechanism\nreally um\nand it's also something that like while\nyeah\nit's traumatic and it's like ongoingly\ntraumatic\num thank you for helping me like say\nthat by the way\nuh it's\nin a way i'm detached from it uh because\nfor my own sanity like in a way it's\nit's\nit's not it's not right now i think if\nyou if we actually had that interview\nseveral months ago\nuh it would have been you know it would\nhave been still fresh\nbut now it's something that i'm like\nsettling into is like it has a fact of\nmy existence like\nit's it's absurd in a lot of ways so\ni mean you use the word detached like it\nfeels a little bit almost dissociated\nyou know because yeah that's what\nhappens when we get traumatized it's\nlike we just say like oh this\ncan't be real yeah and you can't\nyou you can't sit with the thought of\nwhat you're actually facing because that\nwould destroy you as a person\ni would not be able to function so yeah\nand you know 2020 sucks for for for most\npeople too\nlike it's a so it's a rough year for all\nof us disassociating is the mood\ninto our into our nightmare rectangles\nthat's that's my name for a phone\nah nightmare i don't think i coined it\nbut yeah\num so that's that's sort of the\ni i mean i couldn't tell if that was\nsort of the end of the timeline because\nthe timeline's not over yet\num but you know you were kind of saying\nthat like that was like the third point\nso now you're still sort of dealing with\nthis stuff\nit seems like it's persistent but not\nquite\nas acute as it was when you skyrocketed\nto the top of lsf\nyep um yeah thanks for sharing that\nsounds really rough\nyeah thanks thank you for giving me the\nability to\nlike it feels really good to be able to\nspeak\num can i um\nask a couple of questions sure\nso can you tell us uh what it means to\nbe trans\nyou help me understand that concept\nyeah to be to be trans um\ngenerally is a feeling of dysphoria\nfor your gender identity or your\ngendered expression\nor a feeling of euphoria for\nyour preferred gender identity and\ngender expression\nor or both um\nuh to me um so what does dysphoria mean\ndysphoria means a feeling of like\nuncomfortability with your body it's\nkind of like your brain is expecting\nyour body to be one thing and\ngender dysphoria or dysphoria in general\nthat's just that's dysphoria in\ngeneral oh so so you're so you're\nsaying that dysphoria is something about\nthe physical form\na feeling about the physical yeah okay\nyes\nyeah it's like a it's like and that\nmanifests like a disappointment when you\nlook in the mirror or you know when you\nsee your body or that kind of thing it's\nlike an\nincongruence with what you wish you were\nseeing or\nor your mental expectation\nto uh reality\nso what is you foreign euphoria would be\na feeling of of it would be like the\nopposite it would be feeling like\njoy at like what you're seeing or\nwhat you look at when you so\nso my understanding is that that's like\nthat's gender dysphoria or gender\neuphoria\nso sure but that euphoria is just\nfeeling good yeah yeah but like if\nso if a trans euphoric yeah but also\na trans woman often putting on a skirt\nand doing a twirl is euphoric\nyeah and that means you have gender\neuphoria because you have\npresented femininely and it feels good\nand that is enough\nin my mind to to transition uh you know\nwe all should be which is kind of\na little bit contentious some people\nbelieve that you have to feel bad\nto transition but i think we should all\nbe choosing\nour best lives and like trying to\nchase happiness um wherever we go\nand so so if i'm understanding you\ncorrectly like so to be trans is to\nhave a dissatisfaction with when you\nlook at yourself in the mirror\nand to have a satisfaction when your\noutward appearance\nor your body mirrors something of your\nmental expectation\nyeah okay thanks a lot for explaining\nthat\ni'm gonna is it okay if i share like my\nsome of my experiences working with\ntrans people and how they've described\nit to me\nyeah and there's i mean there's\ndefinitely more i could say oh yeah so\nplease say more\num i mean i think there's also it's also\na hormonal thing\noften um so it can be it can also be a\ndissatisfaction\nor with testosterone or satisfaction\nwith testosterone and\nand the inverse um i found myself\ndisliking how testosterone felt in me\nand that was\none of the largest drives for me to try\nestrogen and try blocking testosterone\nand um\nthat that was kind of the doorway to\nopening up my trans identity\nbut i come from i actually come from a\nbiochemistry background\nso that was kind of like i looked at it\ntried to look at it in like a very\nchemical kind of way\nlike you know and i feel like my brain\nwas always meant\nto be on estrogen like that was just\nbetter for me and and i\nhaven't how did you feel on testosterone\num i felt you know it it's a little bit\ndifficult because it's you know it's\nbeen so long ago it's like a whole\ndifferent person to go i've like gone\nthrough a different i've gone through a\nsecond puberty\nand now i have emerged a totally\ndifferent entity\nthan than the me on testosterone\ni feel um and uh\ni i felt like i didn't have\nas much emotional resolution um\nand i kind of feel like i should\ndisclaim this like you know\nwhen you accept yourself and transition\nat the same time it can be kind of hard\nto\ndifferentiate what is what is\nfrom accepting yourself and\nunderstanding your mental state better\nand what is from\nthese hormones you're taking um and it's\nlike\nyou know it's it's both uh but i felt\ni felt like um but also estrogen has\nincreased my sensitivity\nto lights sounds tastes and smells\num and i feel like i have a greater\nemotional\nbandwidth like uh like sadness is\nmany different colors instead of just\nyou know a generalized feeling of\nbeing sad now i i feel like i can\nunderstand a lot more of the nuance\num sounds like a hack\nsounds like an emotional yeah\nsounds like i mean we're like we're here\nliving i choose your own hormone\nadventure you know all you need\nto justify transition is the any\ntransition\nin my mind is a feeling beyond a\nreasonable doubt that it's\ngonna be what what's good what's\nit's gonna improve your life it's gonna\nmake you feel better okay\nso um is it okay if i share kind of my\nperspective\nso what i'd like to do is like sure ask\na couple of questions which may come\nacross as challenging but i want to\nshare\nmy perspective of understanding\ntransgender\nand sort of get your thoughts on that so\nhere's the first thing\num so i had a couple of\npeople that i worked with that really\nexplained this to me well so\ni think my best understanding of\ntransgender\nreally what i think helped me as a cis\nmale understand transgender\nis to like take your cis\nso let's take cis men okay so like most\ni guess\ni do think that 51 of twitch hat is\ncisgendered men um statistically\ni could be wrong here i don't really\nknow and so like you know go\nbuy a pair of high heels and go buy a\ndress\nyour choice if you want to get makeup\nand jewelry and whatnot\nand put those on and the second you put\nthose on\nyou are going to feel intensely\nuncomfortable look at yourself in the\nmirror and it's going to feel\nicky it's going to be feel weird it's\ngoing to feel awkward\nnow that is the way that a transgender\nperson feels before they transition\nevery single day yes\nhow's that for a description\ni think it's the best way that i've come\nto understand what it's like to\nempathize with a transgender person\num the first time i got brave enough to\ngo to a thrift store\nand find a dress it wasn't even i mean\nit's it's not like the it's not a very\npretty dress even\num and like it's not even it wasn't even\nlike a great dress but i\ni managed to get a dress and i put it on\nand i\nloved how i looked so much i wore as\nmuch as i possibly could for like\nfour days i was just jumping around my\napartment because i felt\nfinally liberated and free and that part\nof me that like i had\nrepressed for so long like at some point\ni learned\nthat me wearing a dress was wrong that\nme expressing femininity was wrong\nand that was like locked away until\nuntil i finally was able to like\novercome that\num and it was it was amazing\nyeah um so so you know that's the best\nway i can\nunderstand it in terms of like the\nintense\non discomfort you feel in the relief\nthat you feel when you get out of those\nclothes\nis sort of like what a transgender\nperson feels like\nnow i i have a couple questions for you\nso like let's say that i\nwhen i look at myself in the mirror i\nhave a feeling\nthat my nose looks wrong\nand then i decide to have surgery to\nfix my nose what do you think about that\num i think\ni think that uh if your nose looking\nwrong or your discomfort your nose\nseverely impacts your mental health that\nyou should\nget surgery or you know try to\ntry to improve your perception of\nyourself\neither through surgery or yeah\ni mean i i'm down so i think you should\ni'm gonna disagree with you is that okay\nfor me to do yeah that's fine\nso i come from kind of honestly stuff\ni'm i'm really conflicted about some of\nthis stuff because i see two sides of a\ncoin\non the one hand like it really helps me\nunderstand like the trans person's\nperspective and like i said that's the\nthat's the perspective that helped me\nunderstand trans the best and the one\nthat made the most sense to be\nand it makes a lot of sense that like\nyou know if you just feel like you're in\nthe wrong skin\nto get into the right skin the\nthe the confusion that i have because\nthis is an internal disagreement it's\nnot that i disagree with you it's that i\ndisagree with parts of myself because i\nunderstand that like that's\ni get what i just explained i this other\npart that comes from like\nmore of an eastern tradition of like\nyoga and meditation and stuff like that\nwhich actually posits that our sense of\nidentity\non the whole is actually like false\nand that what truly makes us human is\nnot gender\nis not letters after my name is not a\nparticular age\nand that there is some sort of\ninescapable humanness that is our truest\nform of self\nand that the more that you peel back\nidentity the closer you become to your\ntrue self\nand so i get a little bit conflicted\nbecause also as a psychiatrist\ni've been trained that some people have\nsomething called body dysmorphia\nand and so like you know homosexuality\nused to be a psychiatric illness\ni probably to a certain degree\ntransgenderism used to be a psychiatric\nillness\nnow we describe something called gender\ndysphoria which kind of focuses on the\ndis\nor gender identity disorder it doesn't\nnecessarily mean that\ngender identity is disordered it means\nthat some people\nhave a pathology associated with gender\nidentity\nright it's like the disorder is not\ndoesn't define\nit's not that your gender identity or\ngender identity can cause\na disorder but it can also not cause a\ndisorder\nand so what i kind of struggle with is\nthat like what i'm hearing you say\nand i understand like one side of it\nright just kind of like i explained\nbut what i'm kind of confused by is like\nat what point do we let\nfeelings determine identity\nyou know so that there's a part of me\nfor like my yogic training actually\ntells me that feelings should be the\nlast thing\nto determine identity because feelings\nare just feeling in who i am is who i am\nand my feelings do not define me as a\nhuman being\ni'm curious what do you think about that\num\nhow do you feel about happiness\nlike is is is happiness something that\nwe should\npursue how do you define happiness\num uh dopamines\nserotonins no uh i don't think that's\nsomething we should pursue\nokay interesting right so like if i\nbelieved that\ndopamine was worth pursuing for its own\nsake i would be okay with cocaine use\ni'm not okay with cocaine use huh\nyeah right i mean me neither\nbut um that's a\nreal quick shot of dopamine right there\nit is it is but it's incredibly harmful\nto long-term\ndopamine generation you know you gotta i\nshould like min max your dopamine\nfarming\nyeah but i i know for sustainability\nyeah go ahead so i i don't even think\nthat's a good idea\nso yeah so so like this is where i think\nhappiness like what is happiness\nis it the chasing of like positive\nfeelings\nno i think what we should chase is like\ncalmness tranquility contentment and\npeace\nwhich is not necessarily happiness right\nright i definitely am in the camp of\nlike we should be chasing\nchasing happiness and um but i think you\ncan definitely\nget happiness from\nyou know calmness tranquility and like\nmeditation is like an important\npart of of being a happy being um\nand i mean we should all be\nwe shall be looking for better but i\nthink\na quest to pursue\nhappiness is is worth it on its own\nand i i\ni feel like i i i have a personal\nphilosophy that people\nif people pursued if people were maybe a\nlittle more selfish\nand pursued their happiness more they\ncould\num they could live better lives\nand and make changes to like improve\nwhere they're at\nand to a point like i feel like there's\nso much like accepting a bad situation\nand being at peace with your bad\nsituation uh\nat what point do you like try to\nmanifest change\nfor better so i think that accepting\nyour bad situation is the first step to\nmanifesting change\ni don't think that the two are mutually\nexclusive i think actually a lot of the\nproblems that we run into\nin terms of why people are stuck is\nbecause they don't accept where they are\nthey focus too much on where they want\nto be\nthey focus too much about finding\nhappiness\nif dot dot dot i would be happier\nif dot dot dot if i was\nin you know a different place\nif i had a girlfriend if i had more\nmoney if i was promoted\nif i was this if i was that if i was in\na different body\nright so like a lot of what you\ndescribed makes sense to me in terms of\nlike\nfeelings and and identity and dysphoria\nlike when i look at myself in the mirror\ni imagine that i would be happier if i\ndid not have my dad bod with my dad gun\ni look at myself and i i strive and want\nto be\nmore physically in shape\nand i'm not so sure i think it's fine to\nexercise i think it's good to exercise\npersonally i i'm a little bit conflicted\nbecause at the same time\ni think that like chasing after a\nparticular external thing\nand especially when i work with people\nwith body dysmorphia which i do believe\nis actually an illness\nor illness really isn't the right word i\ndo think it causes a lot of suffering\nlet me put it that way\nyeah and so i'm curious what do you\nthink about like body dysmorphia and i'm\nhappy to define it if you\nwant go ahead yeah so it's like you know\ngenerally we think about people who\nlook at themselves in the mirror or and\nare unsatisfied with what they see\nand go to great lengths to change things\nand sometimes even on an objective\nmeasure so like the most difficult\npatients i've ever had to deal with\nin my history as a psychiatrist is male\nbodybuilders with body dysmorphia\nthey're every time they look in the\nmirror they're unsatisfied with what\nthey see\nand it's it's you know they make\nprogress and they're still unsatisfied\nand so i really struggle with\nthe concept the yogic side of me so i\nlike i understand the transgender\nexample because that sort of just makes\nsense to me and on the flip side the\nyogic side of me\nstruggles because i i don't really\nunderstand\nsomething feels wrong to me about\nletting your feelings determine who you\nare as a person\nright because something is feels wrong\nto me when someone has been like\nraised in an abusive household and they\nfeel like they're\nbad people and those are determined by\nthe way that they feel i do not believe\nthat their identity is accurately\ndetermined by the way that they feel\nsure yeah whether it be narcissism\nor low self-worth\ni i'm just not sure\nwhat do you think about that i\nagree with you you're certainly giving\nme something to think about like i\nuh\num\nit's tricky because i think if someone\nis like if maybe we can go back to the\nnose example\nif if someone is\nis is fixating on the fact that they\ndon't don't like their nose\nintensely if it's like distracting them\nfrom their day-to-day if it's\na mental handicap for them to to to have\nhave something that they could and and\nthey have the ability\nto change that i think that they should\nto better their mental health and\nespecially like\nif you're talking about trans people\nthat you know taking different hormones\ncould liberate so many mental processes\nthat they're not that are are\nspent um being uncomfortable with their\nbody\nor spent like\nspent on these feelings um\nthen i think like i\ni fundamentally think that you you\nshould act on\non feelings but maybe not maybe not all\nfeelings\nso i have i mean i certainly have to\nthink about um\nyeah yeah it's certainly something for\nme to meditate on\nyeah i mean it's something that i\nstruggle with because like\nyou know on on one hand of the spectrum\nlike i sort of\nyou know so my daughter loves to wear an\nelsa dress\nyou know she like really loves like\nsometimes she'll just change at random\ntimes like she'll like\nget ready for the day and then like 3 30\ni'll roll around and she's like i feel\nlike being a princess\nshe'll go upstairs and she'll just like\nchange into her house address\nand you know there's a part of me that\nthat's kind of like okay like you do you\nright like so we want to support kids\nand let them be like who they are and if\nyou want to be a princess then like by\nall means go for\nit there's another part of me that sort\nof wonders a little bit though like\nthere's there's some\nparts of me that are concerned one is\nthat like ultimately what i'm\nteaching my daughter is that her\nhappiness is dependent on the kind of\nclothing she wears\nor her perception of her identity or how\nshe looks on the outside\nthat's not something i actually want to\ninstill in my daughter\nlike there's a part of me that wants\nlike she asks for princess things and as\na parent i'm like absolutely go for it\nlike you do you\nand then like i'm conflicted because\nthen there's another part of me like\nwhat am i teaching her\nthat the clothing that you wear in the\nway that you look on the outside\ndetermines who you are because that i\nwouldn't agree with at all\nlike i just don't know right you know so\ni i just want to\nyeah i would say that her enjoyment has\nhas value\nright her her positive feelings you know\nshe's she wants she wants to enjoy this\nshe feels good\ncompletely\ni i think i think if you if you like\nyou kind of you're maybe running the\nrisk of like\nhurting her enjoyment of a thing\nto you know when you remind her that\nlike\nthis shouldn't matter in in that sense\nthat like\nuh absolutely so i think that's really\ntricky\nare you feeling okay by the way is it\nokay that we're having this discussion\nyeah we're in a difficult we're in\ndifficult and kind of existential places\nbut i\ni feel good i'm comfortable uh do you\nfeel attacked or\nwell anyway no okay no so so\ni'm with you there too because like i\nkind of get what you're saying that\nyou know i i bock at the word should\nlike that she should be something right\nand so to sacrifice enjoyment for the\nsake of what she should be\nbecause that i think is a whole\ndifferent problem that i also\nreact very negatively against right that\nwe tell people that\nyou're not allowed to be happy unless\nyou are\nwhat i think you should be that's a\nwhole i mean that's how\nyou know gender identity discrimination\nstarted right with that concept\nso i i i take issue with that and at the\nsame time i also kind of have this other\nside of the coin and this is really why\ni struggle with this stuff\nis you know to\nto chase good feelings i think is also\nproblematic from the yogic side\nright because to say that like hey if it\nif you feel\nhappier doing it go for it\nright because because then you kind of\nget back to like the trolls of the\ninternet because\nlike are we saying that they should\nsacrifice their trollish enjoyment for\nthe sake of what we think they should be\nor are we saying like actually\nsatisfying your enjoyment because of the\nway that you feel\nand if you're like if i'm a nazi and it\nsatisfies my sense\nlike it gratifies my feelings\nto act behave or even portray myself in\na particular way like let's say i get a\ntattoo\nthen like how do we navigate like i i\njust rub up against this issue of like\nfeelings determining identity and\nchasing\ngood feelings\nit's like an emotional there's like an\nemotional maturity\nand like emotional intelligence side of\nthis of like\nnot trying to hurt other people like it\nfeels good\nto help other people and um\nif you if you're chasing good feelings\nin a self-harming way i don't think\nthat's a good thing for you to be doing\nif you're chasing feelings in a way that\nhurts other people\nthat makes other people's lives worse i\ndon't think\nyou're you're you're doing\ndoing the right thing either so\nagree i think that the tricky thing\nthough is like this kind of comes back\nto your succulents\ni think something about you\nreally like gets at people and i'm not\nsaying that's bad\nbut i think like something about you\nlike really rubs people the wrong way\nright and it could be because you're\nchallenging things that need to be\nchallenged\nbut it's kind of interesting because\nlike i don't know\nwhy when they look at you like it's\n[ __ ] crazy stuff like why are they\ndoxxing you what did you do\nbecause there's no way that you said\nsomething it just doesn't\nit doesn't compute in my mind that you\nhave the power\nto say anything that evokes the response\nthat you've got\nyeah right well i think right i agree\nwith you i mean\nit hasn't i've been around for a long\ntime and it hasn't gotten this bad until\nlike\ntwitch endorsed me in the sense of\nhiring me\ndefinitely assumed like i wasn't\nas soon as as soon as twitch the entity\ngave me their endorsement it became an\nissue that i was\nthis way that i am who i am did i say\nwhat i say\nyeah so i mean i think this is where\nlike i once again i'm kind of conflicted\nbecause that makes a lot like it just\ndoesn't make sense that you're deserving\nof what happened to you and at the same\ntime\ni feel like their reactions have some\nkind of dysphoria based on who you\nare and in my experience a lot of anger\nand hatred actually stems from hurt\nmore than anything else that like if you\nlook at the insult community like i\nthink there are a lot of people who have\nbeen hurt\nand that hurt somehow transforms into\nhatred and now i get really confused\nbecause then it's like\nit's kind of like you know is that woman\nresponsible for hurting\nthat that dude because i i that doesn't\nfeel right to me\nyeah and and so so i i think it just\nit gets really confusing for me because\ni don't really know how to navigate okay\nso\nyou know gratifying your own feelings at\nthe expense of others\nsounds bad but now we get to this\nridiculous situation where your\nexistence\nhurts other people right because that's\nwhat you said like you said\nlike they're like they're just\ntransphobic and then like\nyeah i'm just i'm confused i don't i\ndon't really know like how to\nsort through this because i have these\ntwo really strong conflicting kind of\nviews\none is and i can lay those out to you\none is that like feelings\nthe yogic part of me says that feelings\nshould not determine identity in fact\nthe more that you let your feelings\ndetermine identity the more suffering\nyou'll lead and the more\nfalse identity you'll build that's what\nsort of yoga and buddhism sort of says\nthat if i like determine\nmy identity based on a feeling of pride\nbecause i'm\nceo of xyz or i have a particular net\nworth\nthat's going to cause problems how\nhow do how are trans people like just in\ngeneral how do they reconcile their\nexistence\nto to that you're the that's fine\ni don't know because i understand the\nperspective i understand the perspective\nof like\nyou know if i if i like put on high\nheels in a dress that would feel really\n[ __ ] uncomfortable\nand it makes perfect sense to me that\nif i was in that if i was in the\nposition where i was waking up every day\nand society told me to wear\nhigh heels in a dress i would completely\nget behind someone who says i don't want\nto wear high heels in a dress\ni want to wear jeans and a t-shirt and i\nwould support a person 100\nmakes perfect sense to me and it's\nconflicting with this other thing\nall right yeah sure well uh\num i mean we're all\nwe're all out here trying to do our best\nright that's like i'm not\nand and i don't think life is something\nto just drift\ndrift through in the sense of like you\nknow\nmitigate i don't think we should be\nmitigating\nemotions i mean you're you're the expert\non like this\nthis philosophy that like i'm trying to\nquickly you know\nintegrate and like understand but\num you know i think i think\nlife the we're gonna get\nreally deep i think\ni think one of the fundamental purposes\nof\nof what one of the fundamental joys of\nexisting\nin life and and that kind of thing is\nappreciating art\nin in moments in in the present\nor just you know what other humans have\nmade i think that's something that's\nlike\ncool fundamentally awesome about the\nhuman consciousness that like we can\nmake and share art uh\nand feel feel feel things\nabout it not just not just good things\nbut all things\nand i think i think in that way feelings\ngive my life purpose\nuh they're like they're they're very\nimportant\nand they can be destructive and they can\nbe\ndangerous and you know like\nuh new like new relationship energy is\nsomething\ni love because it makes me feel really\ngood\nbut i have to be very careful about like\nyou know\nuh about like not hurting people along\nthe way when i go if i go and date and\nflirt with someone new\nlike it's super exciting and fun and\nlike i get all\njoyous and i jump around i have energy\ni'm happy\nand and i like that i like being happy\nand i\nwant to continue chasing those feelings\num because i feel like they\nmake me the kind of person that can also\nshare that happiness with others\num which is something i\nfundamentally like want to do is make\nother people happy\nand i think some of that boy brain\ntangence\ni mean some of that is definitely coming\nfrom like\nuh old feeling of like trying to find\nworth in\nuh a family that like\nyou know like like i wasn't i wasn't as\nacademically gifted as my older brother\nfor instance\nand um you know so i found i found value\nin like making puns\ni've got a huge pun brain by the way i\ndon't i don't\ni like don't i actually like suppress\nmy my punliness i'm really good at\nmaking puns but don't do it\nwhy is it sad because i think the best\npart of what you have to offer the world\nmay be puns\nif it's what your brain was made for\nthen give it to us dude\nyeah sure but i mean there's\nthey're they're they're funnier jokes\nand puns have a place in time and it\nshould not be used as a substitute for\nconversation\nin my opinion and some people like\ninstead of having a real conversation\nkind of it was it was a behavior\nfor me that was distracted destructive\nin the sense that like okay\ninstead of yeah anyway um\nso i think i'm worth way more than my\npuns dr\nk um\nbut uh yeah so like i have the strive to\nmake people happy and\nit is it does feel existentially\nfulfilling when i have a stream and\ni make people's day and you know they're\ngoing through something and like\ni can help them feel better like that is\nwhy i turn on the camera\nevery time that i do that's why i'm like\ndriven to streaming\nas much as i am it's like wanting to\nheal heal people\nand help them feel better\ninteresting okay so i mean i'm hearing\nyou kind of share my dichotomy\nbecause you're kind of saying that like\nyou know flirtation and stuff\nmakes you feel good and i i don't know\nif you quite said this but\nthat maybe that's not necessarily a\nhealthy thing to chase\ndo you have to be careful yeah you can't\njust chase\nhappiness absolutely not yeah so i think\nthat's kind of the the struggle and i'm\njust kind of thinking about the people\nwho are watching and like one of the\nthings that i really struggle with\nyou know when i work with our community\nis like how do they know\nwhich are the feelings to give into and\nwhich are the ones\nto overcome right which feelings do you\nchase\nand which feelings do you set aside like\nhow do you know like and we get to this\nvery like the best example i can think\nof is quitting\nhow do you know when like quitting is\nthe right move and for you to say like\nokay this actually isn't gonna work i\nshould drop out\nof college or i'm i'm going for like i'm\ntrying to become a pro gamer and like\nnow it's time to quit\nlike it's enough yeah is enough\nyou know and when do you give in to that\nsense of wanting to give up\nand when do you say to yourself okay\neven though i have these feelings\ni'm not going to let them define me as a\nperson\nbecause the really tricky thing and this\nis the dichotomy that i run into is like\non the one hand i'm with you\nright like but there isn't always a\nclear answer there are some times where\nletting your feelings and this kind of\ngoes back to your\nyou know something really rubbed me the\nwrong way with the way that you defined\na furry which was something about\nyou know your identity is based on the\nwish that your body had\nanimal attributes and\nand i i don't know if i i i've missed\nthe first couple words of that\ndefinition\nbut there's just something that feels\nlike scary to me about like having your\nidentity be defined by your wishes\nlike that just doesn't i feel like what\nmakes people human\nis not what they wish for it's like what\nthey are\nright right so like you know and and\nmaybe this just comes from medicine but\ni'm specifically thinking about it\nyou know a kid with pediatric cancer and\nlike\nboy there are a lot of wishes in the\nroom but that's not yeah\nyeah and who they are is is\nvery different from what they wish for\nand so i just kind of struggle with like\nyou know when do you let your feelings\ndetermine who you\nare like if you're an incel\nyou say like okay i feel like i'm\nunlovable and so\nthat's who i i am an insult they claim\nthis identity based on feelings\nand and that there's a part of me that\nlike understands where they're coming\nfrom but there's a part of me that's\nthat just grates against me and even\nwhen you talk about phrase i'm not\ntrying to be\nnot understanding or challenge them or\nthings like that\num but but there is just something that\nlike rubs me the wrong way from a yoga\nperspective that even like describing\nmyself as a male\nis a yogic mistake and\nand describing myself as an anything is\na mistake because you are not\ndetermined by\nand sorry if i'm talking too much but\nlike i'll offer one last example\nwhich is like i i sometimes think about\nwhen i became a doctor\nand it's not when i got an md after my\nname\nright like who you are is not determined\nby how you\nlook or this is what i i sort of at the\nend of the day this is what robs me the\nwrong ways like i feel like who i am is\nnot determined by the fact that i have a\npenis\nor that i'm a doctor or that i'm indian\nor that i'm a male\nthat my humanity actually transcends all\nof those qualities\nyeah i i would and i would agree with\nthat\ni mean we are all individuals and in a\nlot of ways labels\nlabels help us identity labels help us\nunderstand each other in broad strokes\nbut ultimately to like know somebody you\nhave to\nknow them as a human outside of outside\nof those\nso any idea like if you had to give\npeople concrete advice people who are\nthinking about\nquitting because they feel a certain way\nany thoughts about like what you would\ntell them because you've struggled\na lot with like who you are and what\nyour feelings tell you\nand it sounds like you've come to a\nplace of like peace and contentment and\ntranquility around that\nand sorry for coming on the spot but\ndoes that make sense like because you've\nwalked\nit does yeah well you're i mean you a\nfolk\nyou evoked quitting like esports\nand and that kind of thing quitting in\ncompetitive\ni i in a lot of ways i would say that\nquitting is difficult because i think\npeople subject themselves to a lot of\nharm before\nthey decide that it's time to quit\nbecause it's really hard to give up\non an investment that you've put\nyourself into and admit\nthat something was was not healthy for\nyou\nor is now not healthy for you um\nand i think i think it's important to\num\nappreciate appreciate the journey for\nwhat it is and the path\nand be proud of yourself for trying as\nhard as as hard as you did\nbut uh i think\nif you if it's time to quit\ni feel like in a lot of ways you already\nknow that you just haven't\naccepted it yet that like you've you've\nbeen\nfeeling bad for a while and persisting\nnone persisting anyway and that\num\nuh and if that isn't trans that isn't if\nyou're not if that's not changing into\nsomething that's healthier for you\nlike like the thing you're looking for\nthe the wish that you're actually a pro\ngamer the wish that you're on the team\num you you have two choices really and\nit's to either like\nhow i see it anyway it's either to\ndouble down and try harder\nor to stop and\nlet it be and you know\ntry to find something else to do um\nand so if you're on that precipice and\ndoubling down if that's not an option\nyou know i think that's the first that's\nwhat people really look at is like can i\ncan i do better can i really\ncan i push myself harder um\nbut uh\nyeah thanks for so much for that\nperspective steph i really appreciate it\nwe kind of we've been kind of at this\nfor a little while how are you how are\nyou holding up\ni'm pretty tired and you get more water\nyeah do you want to\num should we go ahead and wrap up or you\nwant to try meditating or take\ni'm kind of spent too to be honest i\nthink why don't we why don't we why\ndon't we wrap up\ni mean if you'd have me on again i'd be\nhappy too\nyeah i'm kind of curious actually a\nlittle bit about we didn't really get\ninto like what\nyour you mentioned a little bit about\nyour brother and what your upbringing\nwas like and i'd i'd love to hear\nmore about that at some point um yeah\nsure\nyou know forget about sort of the drama\nand your gender identity and all that\nkind of stuff which we kind of focused\non today and just\ntalk about like you irrespective of your\nyou know whether you're a furry or other\ncancer\nyou know i don't really care about any\nof that stuff\num yeah i'm i'm not another kin but\nyeah um so so\nhow do you feel about meditation\ni i like meditating okay i don't i i\ndon't often um i wish i did more but\num so there's a particular you said\nyou're going to go get you want to get\nsome water\nyeah go get some water yeah can you get\nsomething to eat as well\nyeah sure okay yeah just get some small\namount of food to eat\nand youtube to a chat we're gonna do a\nmeditation\nyeah i mean you know so i i know that\ni mean we i don't know how to say this\nbut like so\ni think it's okay to disagree with staff\nright like i disagree with stuff like i\nmean the last 30 minutes has been\non some level me disagreeing with staff\ni don't think i mean i would hope that\nchad is so you know these are not\nhow can i say this the stream is not\nabout people being right and y'all being\nwrong\nright it's like it's not about you being\nright and them being on it's about like\nlistening to someone else's perspective\nand you're welcome to disagree with it\ni'd encourage you to disagree with it\ni'd encourage you to disagree with us\nand that's okay like it's just about\nhearing another person's perspective\nyeah so that if steph i was trying to oh\nshe can't hear yet um\nyeah i mean so then like this is the\nkind of sorry stuff i was interacting\nwith chat for a moment\nand i was trying to get a sense of like\nwhat chat has been like and it seems\nlike i mean i've been glancing over from\ntime times pretty okay to me\nbut apparently that some people are are\nyou know being a little bit toxic\ntowards you which i guess is not\nunexpected as\nyou come to expect and at the same time\ni'm just really curious about like\nwhy they have to treat like i'm just\ncurious like what about\nyou know it goes back to your succulents\nlike what what is it about you that they\nhave to\nhate and attack like why do they care so\nmuch\nto come and spew you know i i just don't\nunderstand like i genuinely do not\nunderstand it\nlike what you know why not do something\nmore productive with their day\nthen come here and try to talk trash\num i'm not\nit's not a rhetorical question i don't\nhave any questions like what do\nwhat do people gain right so they're\nchasing a feeling too\nor they're chasing an identity and a\nfeeling that comes from attacking you in\nsome way\nit's like what is that are they like\nmaking the world a better place\nby calling someone trash and\ntwitch chat like are they solving the\nworld's problems and standing up for\ninjustice\num yeah that's that's not my question to\nanswer\nyeah i i really don't but steph i think\nhonestly part of the problem with\nthe way that we treat the internet is\nthat we don't actually talk to the\npeople who are toxic\nwhich i know is a really dangerous game\nbut it's something that i'm\ni hope to do more of how do you feel\nabout that i do i've i mean i've talked\nto a lot of my harassers to try to\nunderstand them\nyeah they have how's that sound\nnot well i suggest\nusually well oh really cool can yeah\nmost i mean most people that have a\ndialogue with me\num feel better about me by the end of\nthe dialogue\nas i don't have enough there's not\nenough stuff to go around\num and uh\nuh usually people think a lot of\nvery very prominent thought is that i\nhave mental illness\nand i'm invalid as a human that should\nlike\nexist and speak and have my my\nperspectives are in some way like\ndangerous toxic and like i should be\nquarantined away\nand that's that's why a lot of them want\nto hurt me\num others are on the bandwagon want\nsomeone to bully\ni am a valid target for bullying\nin their brain and uh they get some\nenjoyment out of that they don't know\nwho it's okay to be mean to\nso when they find someone when it's like\nthey have the target\nthey're like okay with it\ni guess you're contagious your\ntransgenderism is contagious is that\nwhat they're afraid of\ni don't think it's that but maybe maybe\npartially\nmy whole it's like it's like because\nit's just like this\nright so when people use it yeah\nquarantined i think of the word\ncontagious\nyeah maybe it's just like my radical\nself-acceptance\nis super dangerous and like my\nacceptance of other people is\ndangerous and i i don't like\nit's kind of unfair to like have me\nbe the one who\nanswers for my trolls yeah i can only\nkind of say what\ni kind of see but they're all\nindividuals that have their own personal\nreasons and when i paint them in broad\nstrokes they just get more angry\nit's unfair it's unfair to ask you to do\nthat\nyeah yeah okay so let's talk about\nmeditation\nso you grab something to nibble on i\nhave a nibble\nokay awesome so i want you to yeah oh go\nand open it up\nand twitch chat you guys grab something\nas well\nwe're gonna have a zen moment with\ntwitch chat and everyone i like this\nzen i don't not twitch chat come on\nstuff\ni i want to forget if i'm projecting\nwe're gonna\nwe're gonna see if we can get by the\nnext couple of minutes without\nyou know creating a dank meme that's the\nbest we can hope for\nthe sad moment happens it happens but\nokay so i want you to sit up straight\nat some some somewhere in twitch chat\npeople are having a set moment with us\nthere's always that is represented too\nso sit up straight and go and close your\neyes\nand feel the person that you are\njust try to i know this is going to\nsound weird\nbut how do you know\nyou exist you don't have to answer\nand try to figure out like what is it\nthat lets you know\nthat you exist\nand so that starts with sort of the\nsense of\nyou yeah go ahead\nso just feel the person that you are\nthere's something there that is doing\nsome kind of experiencing right you may\nfeel your body\na lot of times people can feel their\nbreath\nyou may notice your thoughts\nso somewhere in there is you\nand sometimes people have a perception\nthat\nwhat they are is to be shamed\nor to be proud of\nbut i encourage you if you feel anything\neither positive or negative just notice\nthat that is a feeling\nit is an emotion that goes across\nthe screen of yourself\nthat feelings fluctuate with time\nand at the end of the day no matter what\nthe feeling itself is or the thought is\nthat there is an experiencer of those\nthoughts and feelings\nthere's a backdrop under which thoughts\nand feelings exist\nnow try to get a sense of the person who\nexperiences the feelings\nare you the feelings or are you the\nexperiencer of feelings\nand are your thoughts you or are your\nthoughts\nthought by\ntry to just get a sense of like sit with\nthe person that you are for a moment\nnow i want you to think about the ways\nin which you identify yourself\nwhether it be gender or job\nor location or name\ngamer troll\ngenius\nkind compassionate\ngood person\nor shame worthless\na ball of envy\na ball of fantasy hope\nlonging wishing\nthat you are something else\nwhatever it may be\npride accomplishment\nhowever you think of yourself\nand now take a bite of your nibble\nand then ask yourself who is it that's\ndoing the\ntasting as you taste this thing\nis this person accomplished are they\nshameful\nare they a man are they a woman\nare they a streamer\nwhat is this person then tunnel down\ninto this\nexperience precisely where is the gender\nin this\nwhere is the accomplishment where is the\nshame those things may exist\nsomewhere within you but in this moment\nyou're just someone is eating\nand focus on the taste that is left in\nyour mouth\nmaybe the sensations of little crumbs or\nwhatever there may be\nand try to ask yourself where is the\ngender here\nwhere is the joy where is the happiness\nwhere is the hatred where is the shame\nwhere is the gamer\nwhat is this person\nand as best as you can notice that\nunderneath all of these qualities\nwhether it be age or name\nor a sense of bank account or\naccomplishment or lack of accomplishment\nthere's just\nyou\nthat there may be some things that\nfluctuate within you but at the end of\nthe day there's\njust you on a good day\non a bad day yesterday today tomorrow\nand take solace in who you are whether\nwhat's on the inside is good or bad\nbecause that changes are days that you\ncan forget\nand days that you remember strongly\nbut if that's true then neither of those\nthings can truly be you it can feel like\nyou\nyou can be one with infused with what's\non the inside\nbut at the end of the day you are just\nyou\nthat you may have feelings you may have\ndesires\nyou may have questions you may have\nconfusion\nbut that you are what you are and\nthere's actually nothing wrong with you\neven if there's unhappiness that\nunhappiness can just be a shade of who\nyou are\nand there's nothing right you are what\nyou\nare\nand when you're ready let steph come\nback\nallow her back in advocate\nchampion\nvillain\nall of those things that's that\nright and so be it like step is a cool\nperson it doesn't have to be you\nand no matter what you feel or how\npeople treat you theft\nno one can take what you are away from\nyou\nthey can just make you feel a certain\nway but they can't take you away from\nyou\nsorry did you say something i i didn't\noh what's up i said thank you oh you're\nwelcome\nhow do you feel what was that like does\nthat make sense i can never tell\nbecause i can't actually read your mind\nyeah\nno it made sense it was it was nice it\nwas good to take it\ntake a moment to kind of deconstruct\nuh existence and experience\ni a good way to put it we are\nwe are a lot of things i am i am a lot\nof brain\ni am not just my taste buds but i can be\njust my taste buds they're in the right\nin in the right mind state so\nyeah so oddly enough if i can give you a\ndirection\nis that okay so i'd encourage you to\nyou know you can do this practice or\nbreathing practices or whatever\nand when you say i'm a lot of things\ni would really check because i think\nthat is the statement that i disagree\nwith the most and this is the one i'm\nconfident about\nthat you are none of those things\nstaff may be a lot of things but you are\nnone of those things\nand so see which of those things you\nactually are\nyeah i know it doesn't make sense don't\nworry about it\nyeah my microphone doesn't it seems to\nnot want to work as well all of a sudden\ni'll lean in maybe it's because we've\ngotten we've gotten all quiet\nyeah well thanks a lot for coming on\ni i this was i didn't know you know what\npeople were expecting or what you were\nexpecting\nbut i'm always happy to disappoint\nno you were you were great i've heard\ngreat things i haven't like\nwatched your content before but you were\nyou're a good host\nand uh you know i appreciate that\nwe are different people and we got to\nhave like such a good discourse and i\ngot to speak my mind which is like\nah really nice to me thank you so much\nby the way to speak\nfor me is like really so thank you for\ngiving me the platform to do that like\nit's really nice\ni hope we've been helpful in some small\nway and i really wish you all the best i\ndon't\ni mean you may deserve i know this\nsounds bizarre but i think that like\nyou got to be careful in terms of\nsometimes i think when we get a bunch of\ncriticism\nwe may deserve some of that criticism\nbut i can't imagine anything that you've\nsaid or done\nthat makes you deserving of the way that\npeople are treating you\nyou know there's just no way i just\ndon't see it\ni just i there's no way that i can\nfathom what you're experiencing is\nactually what you deserve\ndoesn't mean that you didn't screw up\nhere or there you know\nthat's usually what happens but it\nsounds like really unfair\nthe way that people are treating you\nso good luck to you steph thank you\nyou have a good day chat you have a good\nday too\nbye\nyou"
