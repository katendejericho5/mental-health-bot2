    "transcript": "okay so thrilled today folks we've got a\nlot of cool stuff\nwe have today we have the ban appeals\nso it is still the year of our lord 2020\nmod appreciation week\nwe're halfway through mod appreciation\nweek where proceeds from stream are\ngoing to our mods\nit's a way of saying thank you so\nbasically we have a we have a discord\nright\nand on our discord uh sometimes people\nget banned so just so you guys know our\ndiscord is really a place for like\npeople who are interested in the values\nof healthy gamer\nit's about like understanding yourself\nbetter or growing as a human being\nit's not about you know sharing the\ndankest memes and a place for the walls\ni mean we want people to have fun and\nthere are you know chill channels and\nstuff like that\nwhere we want people to enjoy themselves\nbut our our discord is really focused on\ngrowth it's not focused on\nyou know fun you know what we're going\nto do today is actually like talk to\npeople who have been banned and try to\nget a sense of like\nwhat their understanding was of why they\ngot banned\num and then we will let you guys kind of\nvote on what we should do in terms of\nletting them back onto discord or not\nhello hey man oh hold on\nis it if for some reason it's going\nthrough my my vr headset\nhold on okay then so what uh\nwhat do you go by man just call me again\nbecause my name is ganymede so just call\nme ganny danny okay\nso ganny can you tell us a little bit\nabout how you came to join the healthy\ngamer community\nwell um initially i was watching your\nstreams and i was watching the\nuh vods on youtube and um\ninitially that well the one that drew me\nin uh was the\nthere was there was a guy i think his\nname was paul or something and he was\nlike it was about the whole incel\nconversation\nand um i saw that and i\nsaw a few of your other streams and\nstuff and i and i and i kind of liked\nthe sort of angle that the channel was\ntaking where it was like\napplying the sort of mental health or\nthe sort of like\nuh sort of mental health angle for like\nthe gaming community and i thought that\nas somebody who\nis a part like pretty active in the\ngaming community and as somebody who\nengages frequently with like discord and\nvideo games that i would\nbenefit from being in a community that\nwas sort of centered around that\nthat's awesome man we made the community\nfor people like you\nand so what happened when you joined the\ndiscord how did you get yourself banned\num well a lot of the times i i think\ni think it was repeated behavior i think\nit was uh it was stuff that was\nhappening over and over and over again\nwhere i was kind of using the using it\nas a platform more event\nand like people would give me advice and\npeople would would like uh\ntell me things to do but i a lot of the\ntimes i wouldn't say i ignored it\ncompletely like a lot of times i would\ntry my best to address it\naddress it but a lot of the times i i\nfeel like the advice was either not\nspecific or enough\nor it was kind of hard to take action on\nand i was just a bit confused\nsometimes so as much as i tried to sort\nof take advice\ni maybe wasn't the best at listening to\nothers\nand a lot of the times the advice to me\nseemed kind of cliche and seem kind of\nlike\nuh stuff i've heard like a million times\nbefore\nand how did you respond to it well\nusually i\nuh what i would do is i i would try to\nsort of address it or i would\ni mean the thing is is when you're in a\ntext chat there are so many people\ntalking at you at once it's almost\nimpossible to address what everybody is\nsaying\nbut uh i wouldn't necessarily address\nevery single thing that was said to me\nnecessarily because there was just so\nmuch of it and people would get mad at\nme because they would say oh why aren't\nyou addressing what i'm saying\ninteresting and uh can i add one more\nthing because\nthere was multiple reasons i was banned\ni think i was also vain for making like\nnot safe for work comments as well\nuh or or saying things that was uh that\nwere not kind of like out of place\nand i'm for the most part like used to\nbe in communities where that stuff is\nokay but i understand that like\na lot of the times it was out of place\nand a lot of the times\nsome of the remarks i was making were\ninappropriate and really\ndid not have to be sad all right so let\nme just make sure i hear you ganny\nso on the one hand it sounds like you\nwere maybe reaching out for support and\npeople would try to support you but they\nwould try to support you with cliche\nadvice\nand you're saying that you would respond\nin ways where you couldn't\naddress everyone sort of yeah okay\nso generally speaking that's a little\nbit confusing to me because that's\nusually doesn't like at least as far as\ni understand that doesn't get you banned\nlike usually what gets you banned is\nlike you know if someone gives you\nadvice and you respond in a toxic manner\nthat could get you banned so i'm curious\nabout the way that you responded was it\njust that\nhey guys i'm a little bit confused and i\ncan't get to everyone because that\nsounds weird because that's the way\nyou're making it sound\ni think i think a big reason too is\nbecause i would go to the chat with the\nsame issue repeatedly and\npeople would kind of get tired of of me\nsort of monopolizing or taking over the\nchat and sort of\nlike with my issues because it would be\nthe same issue over and over and over\nagain and i think people were kind of\nfed up with that\nokay so it sounds like you were asking\nfor help but when people were trying to\nhelp you you\ni get the sense that you kind of weren't\nmeeting them halfway\nyeah you were rejecting the help that\nthey offered and you kept on asking\nand you kept on rejecting help yeah that\nsounds right\nokay and then it also sounds like you\nwere posting some things that were\ninappropriate and\nyou know you're a gamer on the internet\nand so a lot of times posting things\nthat are not safe for work\nis like completely normal in some\ncommunities but it's not okay in our\ncommunity yeah i understand that\nand the other thing that i'm hearing\nfrom you which i think is quite\ninsightful is that it seems like these\naren't one-time things these are like\nmultiple times that you were doing this\nyeah like i was muted i was muted twice\nbefore i was or\nuh yeah twice before i was banned so\nuh i understand like why i don't\nokay i feel like the final band like it\nkind of came out of nowhere i was kind\nof surprised\nbut at the same time i understand why\nafter uh\nrepeated offenses i would be banned okay\nso let's like dig into that for a second\nwhen you get muted once and then you get\nunmuted what do you what was going\nthrough your head\nlike how do you get muted again well i\nwas muted for\ndifferent for different reasons so i\nwould get muted for something and then\ni'd say oh i guess i'm not going to do\nthat again but then i wouldn't do that\nagain but then i get muted for like a\ncompletely different reason or for\nsomething else okay and then so yeah\nyeah so i'm also hearing like some\ndegree of like\nalmost conflict or confusion in terms of\non the one hand like yeah you got banned\nbecause you were muted twice\nbut on the other hand it sounds like you\nfelt like you were breaking different\nrules\neach time and so it sort of felt like it\ncame out of nowhere but on the other\nhand\nsomeone who gets muted twice and gets\nbanned it's like not that unreasonable\nbut to you it still felt like it sort of\ncame out of left field yeah because\nthere wasn't like a specific\nthing i said that caused me to be banned\nit was just\nit was just general i mean i could read\nuh i think i i still have the\nthe message from the bot i don't know if\nyou it says here\nam i allowed to read it out or yeah\nwe'll let moses do that\nyeah i think it was just mostly\ninappropriate comments related to sex\nwas\nthe big one yeah that's understandable i\nfeel like because a lot of the issues i\nwas having were like not safe for work\nissues so i was trying to talk about\nthem but\ni was i wasn't really sure how to talk\nabout them in a way that was\nuh in a way that was necessarily\nuh appropriate for the server but maybe\ni guess if an issue is not safe for work\nand it's\nprobably better to talk about it\nsomewhere else or not talk about it at\nall\ni'm curious moses can we go into a\nlittle bit more detail because that's\nkind of an interesting question right\nlike so\nsometimes people do have issues that may\nnot be safe for work\nand like how do we want to and how do we\naddress those on our discord\npeople in chatter saying make an nsfw\nchannel but i feel like that would\nbecome\nfor people to say all kinds of stuff and\nthen they're like oh it's the nsfw\nchannel\none comment was i just get extreme\nsatisfaction when people are shamed and\nhave negative things happen to them as a\nresult of sex\nokay i mean that just sounds less infw\nand more just like bitter and like uh\nmaybe\ninappropriate in another way less than\nan nsfw you know what i mean\ni i again what i hear you saying is that\nlike you were trying\nyou're not necessarily advocating for\nthose feelings\nyou're just trying to share that you\nfeel a certain way and maybe you want to\nwork on that\nam i being like too optimistic there or\nyou just i feel like it's a mix of both\nlike i do want to work on them\nabsolutely like i do want to see them\nchange\nbecause i know they're not productive\nthoughts and behaviors\nbut at the same time sometimes when i\nlet them out maybe i'm not necessarily\n100 thinking about it at that in that\nway in that moment but it is it is\nsomething i want to change if that makes\nany sense\nyeah so what are the other ways in which\nyou're thinking about it that's\ninsightful of you to realize that there\nis like something\ntoxic about those statements it's not\njust\ngrowth and positivity right what else is\nthere well i feel like part of it kind\nof gets it off my chest or like\nme it was sort of it's a venting as as\nit said in the\nban uh the band reason it's it's venting\na lot of it is\nuh a lot of it is releasing some of my\nanger because a lot of the times i mean\ni do harbor a lot of anger and a lot\nof frustration and a lot of the times i\nrelease it through like\ninflammatory or negative comments or you\nknow what i mean\nyeah do we want to go into more detail\nabout what kind of inflammatory or\nnegative comments those could be\ni mean it's i if you want me to be\nspecific specifically things around like\nuh sexuality or like my inability to\nuh the fact that i'm not sexually active\nor the fact that other people are able\nto be sexually active but i'm not like\nspecifically that is i think the\nthe thing that causes uh frustration for\nme\nand so ganny you know just to kind of\nclarify so like\nwhen you have those feelings what have\nyou noticed like what has the internet\ntaught you\nis like the appropriate way to\ncommunicate that what is the internet\ni mean the internet hasn't necessarily\ntaught me a lot of positive things when\nit comes to dealing with that i feel\nlike what the internet teaches me is\nthat you get you post it you post\nsomething and then a bunch of people get\nfrustrated at you and a bunch of people\ntry to argue with you\nand then you you cause like a big scene\nand then that's basically how you deal\nwith your problems rather than\nyou know how can i improve and how can i\nuh\nget better or how can i change this\nright sure\nso so moses anything else you want to\nadd in terms of like logs or\nanything i mean do you feel comfortable\nwith me saying this\nyeah i mean i think it's worth it if it\ncan help other people it might be going\nthrough the same thing i think it'd be\nfine to\nshare it or yeah i mean yeah just share\nit because like here's the thing right\ngandhi is like like people need\nanother way to think about some of these\ntopics and people need\nto understand like what is okay to say\nand what is not okay to say\nyeah and i i don't know how we do that\nwithout providing examples\nokay yeah because that makes it far away\nyeah\nall right vlog one i honestly can't\nconceive of the fact that millions of\nguys literally get to have sex with\nwhoever they want while i raw alone\nnever gang to feel the touch of a woman\nseems kind of unfair don't it\nokay all right keep going\nnext log two i feel that i am treated\nlike a second class cis and through the\ndenial of sex by woman i don't think\nevery individual woman owes me sex but i\nthink i'm owed it in a fair world\nlog three can a trans woman get wet\nthat yeah that wasn't one that was one\nthat was pointed out to me that i\nknow is inappropriate for obvious\nreasons uh log four\nam i allowed to talk about wanting to\nkms on here\nand then the last log was the one i\nalready said when people are ashamed and\nhave negative things happen to them as a\nresult of sex\nso ganny what is it what is it like when\nyou hear\nmoses read off what you've said well i\nfeel like when you say these things\nor when i say these things i don't\nreally think about it before i say it so\nto hear it sort of uh said back to me\nafter i've had some time to think about\nmaybe some of these things it kind of\nmakes me\ndouble it makes me think again about\nmaybe some of the things i've been\nsaying and maybe how reasonable i mean\ni think a lot of it sounds kind of\nunreasonable and stuff i wouldn't say\nagain but at the same time i mean i've\nsaid it so\nit's very easy to say oh i wouldn't say\nthis but i've already said it so\nit's just uh it doesn't seem it it seems\nit's very i mean hindsight is 20 20 but\nyeah no it's very it sucks to hear these\nthings i mean i don't i don't like to\nhear these things\nhow do you feel about yourself hearing\nthese things oh\ngeez that's kind of harsh uh i i feel i\ni honestly feel like\nuh i mean i i kind of i hear what these\nwhat this person is saying and i know\nthis person is me but i hear what this\nperson is saying and i just think of\nlike why is this person so angry or what\nhappened to this person to\nmake them like so bitter and so or\nnot maybe not what happened to this\nperson because that kind of but like\nbecause i feel like when you think about\nwhat happened to the person it's kind of\nrelieving them from some responsibility\nbut like\nwhy why does this person have to say\nthese horrible things right\nit's interesting that you thought my\nquestion was harsh\num it's not harsh at all it's just uh\ni'm just saying it's\nit's harsh to think about for me not\nnecessarily yeah so so and and i i think\nthat it's kind of interesting because\nwhat i'm hearing you say is that like\nyou recognize that this person is you\nbut you also recognize that like this\nisn't\nall of you right this is a piece of\nyourself\nthat is angry and resentful and you're\nable to like when you hear it it's like\nthat's not\nthat certainly doesn't sound like the\nganny that i'm talking to right now\nright you see yeah level-headed you seem\nlike\nthoughtful you're careful to not like\nabsolve yourself of responsibility\nyou're trying really hard to take\nresponsibility i hear that\nright because you kind of say you know i\nsay that i'm not going to do it again\nbut then again i i did it i did it\nseveral times\nso how can i even say that i'm not going\nto do it again even though in this\nmoment i really feel like i'm\ngoing to do it again yeah i know that\nmakes sense um\ni mean can i be honest about something i\nthink this is something i want to make\nclear\nuh if i am for some reason allowed back\ninto the server i feel like i wouldn't\nnecessarily talk about my issues in it\nnecessarily\nbecause i feel like when i do like it it\ntends to\ngo in a negative direction and intense\nand i tend to\ni tend to end up seeing things that i\nregret and i'm not saying and i feel\nlike\nlike for me if i were to use the\ncommunity again i'd probably use it to\neither talk about other people's issues\nor\nuh just have fun like just talk to\npeople on the vcs because honestly\ni feel like when whenever i talk i talk\nabout things that are going through my\nhead i kind of go down a rabbit hole\nand i kind of uh i start to hurt the\npeople around\nme and i start to i don't know like i i\njust\nit's maybe like i just need to take a\nbreak from like my\nthinking so much about myself and my own\nuh\nmy own problems i i mean oddly enough\nganny i think\num and so we'll we'll sort of ask twitch\nchat\nand and zach to kind of yeah so zach's\ngot a poll up but here's what i think so\ni think that that's like a really\nproductive\ntake i do hope that our community is a\nplace where we can actually address some\nof those feelings\nbut not in an like in-cell\nkind of approach or language like i\nthink the way that you\nreacted to listening to your own\nlanguage is actually the healthy way\nright is to like ask yourself like where\ndoes this anger and resentment come from\nand i think if your focus is on like i\nfeel angry towards women and i follow my\nfind myself like falling into this\nin-cell red pill\nkind of like thinking do you guys have\nany thoughts about like how i can\nstart to think about things differently\nand i think this is going to be a more\nyeah yeah so\nso i mean i i do want our discord to be\na place where people can like\nauthentically look at the dark part of\nthemselves and try to change\ni think in your case there's a double\ndoozy because it sounds like maybe you\ndid that\nand people tried that with you right\nlike they tried to give you advice they\ntried to talk to you\nand it sounds like for whatever reason\nyou shot them down every single time\nand so what i would really also look at\nif you are on band\nis to like ask yourself why do i ask for\nhelp and then shoot it down\nbecause that too is like angry and\nresentful and hopeless\nyeah no that's true so let's see what\nwhat do you think you think twitch chat\nis going to want to unban you uh i'm\ngoing to be honest\ni'm not allowed to read the twitch chat\nbecause i don't want some no\nno reading to a chat you have to tell me\nwhat you think\ni i don't think so because i feel like\nsome of the comments i make people are\ngonna hear them and be like oh what's\nthis guy's problem\nso interestingly enough so it seems like\ntwitch had 63\nof twitch chat feels like you should be\nunbanned\noh my god really yeah man\nand frankly i'm not surprised because i\nthink you're not the toxic [ __ ] that\nyou are at times when you talk like this\nlike the person that we're talking to\nright now ganny is i think like\nabsolutely allowed on her server it's\nwhen you start to like become this other\nperson which you\nabsolutely have inside you that doesn't\nbelong there\nbecause you have to understand that not\nonly is that not helpful towards you but\nit's actually hurtful towards other\npeople\ni know sometimes it just feels like\nwords to you\nyou know if you ask like inappropriate\nquestions about like transgender people\nlike their\ntransgender people come to our our\ndiscord for like\nto be like safe and accepted and you\ncome to our discord because you want to\nbe safe and\naccepted so when like people are bashing\nin cells like that's hurtful towards you\nand when you bash on people like that's\nhurtful towards them\ni mean i feel like when people bash in\ncells i don't really get that upset\nbecause i don't identify myself as an\nincel even though i know that\npeople might think i am one i don't know\ni just don't really like\nidentify myself that way okay\nmistaking a sub [ __ ] on my part yeah\nall right just i'm curious now last\nquestion how do you identify yourself\nwell i think i'm just uh struggling\nindividual who has problems who has\nresentment and i feel like\nlike putting a label on it for\nespecially like an ill label from the\ninternet\ni feel like that's not necessarily going\nto help me especially when\na lot of the people who consider\nthemselves in cells are very like\nthey're not the kind of productive\npeople you want to surround yourself\nwith they're the kind of people that try\nto drag you down and the kind of people\nthat\nuh aren't like trying to get you to\nimprove yourself you know what i mean\nsure so that sounds like a really good\nanswer and so i'd be really really\ncareful\nganny when you start using labels about\nother people\nbecause just like you're you're a\n[ __ ] insult man\nbut like that label doesn't help right\nit's like it doesn't speak to when you\ntalk about being entitled to sex like\nthat's in cell language\nand at the same time you're not an\ninsult because you're a human being\nwho's struggling and has like resentment\nand anger issues\nand you're trying to grow as a person so\nbe careful the next time\nyou know you call someone like an\ninappropriate label\nbecause you feel angry because you're\ndoing the same thing to them\nthat people do to you and they call you\nin excel which is that you're\ndeorganizing\nand i don't think it's fair to label you\nas an incel even though in a sense you\nfit the bill like i don't think it's\nhelpful\nright like i get behind your definition\nwhich is that you're someone who's like\ntrying to grow as a human being and\nyou've got challenges\nbut then you should give that same\nrespect to other people yeah that's fair\nenough\nall right good luck annie thank you\nthanks for coming on man\nand it looks like no problem man twitch\nchat in a\nin a two to one ratio feels like you\nshould be allowed back onto the server\nall right all right take care yeah\nthank you bye hey man\nhey what's up can you tell me um what\nwould you like to be\nlike how do you want to be referred to\nwhat should i call you um\nbrecken works that's my first name can\nyou first start by telling me a little\nbit about um\nhow you came to our community and and\nkind of how you\nwhy you joined the discord i saw your\nstreams with like reckful and a couple\nothers\nand then i saw a link for your discord\non the\nhealthy gamer site because okay i went\non originally to like\nuh contact you um or like see if it was\npossible to set up like\nuh like an actual point like medical\nappointment but i didn't know if you did\nlike online\nsure therapy like actual online therapy\nlike sure like medical\nyeah and then i found the discord that\nway okay\nand so you signed up for the discord and\nand you've been banned\nright yes and so help me understand a\nlittle bit about like what happened and\nwhat's your understanding of why you got\nbanned\ni i i in real life i've been diagnosed\nwith borderline\nso uh i've and i'm not medicated right\nnow\ndue to a lot of other reasons but i i\ndon't want to like excuse\nlike things i did because of that but\ni'd be lying if i said it didn't have to\ndo with it\nat all sure and um\ncan you explain to us what borderline\nmeans\nit's almost like you get into these\nstates where um\nyou feel something like this this\ncreeping feeling\nwell up in your chest and you can't\nreally like let it out\nthrough any way other than than anger\nokay so you have some feeling and then\nyou get angry\nyeah it's it's like instead of uh like\nregulating your emotions normally\nit's like taking it out on yourself and\nothers because of\njust like the building up and then not\nbeing able to release it through\nlike normal means and okay so what\nhappened on on discord\num i had brought up something about um\nuh like uh being a victim of like a\nsexual incident and\nuh then someone um like said something\npassive aggressive to me about it\nand so i uh like responded like really\nharshly and just attacked him\nbut that was that was the warning and\nthen the ban\nwas oh i attacked someone which was\ncompletely unwarranted on their end so\nit was my fault that time but\ni i didn't hold back at all i just went\nas hard as i could on him and i\ni just thought of like the things to say\nthat would\nhurt him the most basically so it sounds\nlike\nyou understand that you really were\nnot nice to him yeah and\nand that you were out to hurt him yes\nand\nso but it also sounds like you sort of\nrecognized that that was bad and that\nmaybe you were like weren't in control\nof your emotions at that time\nwell yeah i wasn't in control my\nemotions at the time like\nfor example like i've broken like two or\nthree smartphones\nand like also have\nlike gambling and drug addiction\nproblems and stuff so\nuh this isn't like sounds rough this\nisn't like\nit isn't even something that happens\nthat much sounds like it happens rarely\nand sometimes explosively\nyeah yeah it's like whenever i'm at the\nboiling point\nand it just wells up in my chest it's\nlike primal rage\nyeah and then you can't control it yeah\nso on the one hand it sounds to me like\nyou really dealt with a lot of really\nunfortunate things\nand and i feel compassion for kind of\nthe way that\nyour life has been um you know i do feel\nlike we want to support you\nand it's not fair that you've had to\ndeal with the things that you've had to\ndeal with it sounds like you have your\nfair share of struggles\nand our our discord is actually a place\nwhere we want people like you\num who have struggles like that's what\nthe healthy gamer discord is about it's\nabout people who struggle and giving\nthem a space where they can like work on\nthose struggles in sort of a proactive\nway\nmakes perfect sense so i'm i'm really\nconflicted personally because on the one\nhand i feel like it's a place where\nyou belong and we made the discord for\nplaces for people like you\nand bizarrely because we made it for\npeople like you\nit makes it really unacceptable when you\nkind of go off on them\nand i'm personally i agree because you\nknow i see that you\nrecognize that you made a mistake and\nand you sort of didn't feel like you\nwere in control of your actions\nand so i i genuinely don't know kind of\nwhat to do\nlike i even if i were to get unbanned i\nprobably wouldn't join back\nsimply like right now at least until\nlike i i just don't think\ni would be ready to participate in the\ncommunity right now\nand like whenever i go in there\nsometimes whenever i\ni i would be in like a negative state of\nmind like in a lot of ways it would make\nme feel like even more strange from\npeople just seeing\nhow like just seeing people's reactions\nor like responses\ni mean there were a couple people that i\nthink i helped really but\nlike other than that brecken i really\nrespect you for saying that\nif you did something wrong and you feel\nlike you should apologize for it i think\nyou know you mentioned you tossed out\nthe phrase net negative effect\nbut i think by coming on here i think\nyou just\nflipped that around because i think that\nwhen people mess up and they like try to\nmake it right\nmy hope is that the world becomes\na net positive doesn't always happen but\ni do think generally speaking that there\nare not enough people who are given\nan opportunity to say hey like i kind of\n[ __ ] up and i'm sorry about that\ni also really really commend you for\nrecognizing that even if you are\nunbanned that maybe\nyour interaction with our discord is not\nin its healthiest space right now\ni need to address a lot of things\nprobably beforehand and i i don't even\nknow even if i'm\ni don't even know in the future even\nwhen i am technically ready if i would\nbe fit\nso i don't know but yeah so then\ni think in in a weird way this\nconversation is is\non the on one hand it's productive and\non the other hand i was under the\nimpression this is a ban appeals stream\nand what i'm hearing is there's\nactually consensus between the mods and\nyou that maybe you need to work on\nyourself for a little while and maybe\nlike a ban appeal\nis more appropriate down the road what\ndo you think\neven if i were to get ben though like i\nsaid i probably wouldn't rejoin the\nserver\nuh because i'd probably i i've come to\nthe\ni'd already come to the conclusion\nbeforehand like that i just felt out of\nplace in the server\nin general so sure so sometimes\num bracken sometimes people will\ncome on a banner like i can just it's\nkind of weird right because like\nyou're on a ban appeal stream and you're\nkind of saying i i'm not ready to be\nunbanned i'm not ready to participate\ndoes it feel okay to you how do you feel\nright now with us saying yeah that\nsounds okay to us\nwere you hoping or expecting us to say\nno you really are ready we really want\nyou to be back on the community\nplease come back i saw this as more of a\nchance to talk to you than\na ban appeal to be honest okay\nthat makes sense yeah yeah i'm sorry if\nif you were a little bit disappointed\nwith how this went\nno it's fine i i don't know i part of it\nwas just like\nuh i wanted like to externalize like how\ni felt myself about\nmy experience in the community because\nlike if\nif i externalize it then i also get the\nfeedback from you guys so\nit and chat so it makes it um\nit just clears it up more in my mind\nyeah so first of all bracken thank you\nfor coming on man um no\nproblem you know i know it sounded like\nyou wanted to apologize and and get some\ntime with me which i can totally get\nand at the same time i think you\nactually have made the community a\nbetter place by doing that\ni think you make it you make all the\nother people who are having feelings\nlike maybe they don't fit\nmaybe they don't belong i think you\nnormalize their feelings\nand you've let them know that hey it's\nokay to like\nnot really connect with the community\nand have times where it's like difficult\nto connect and that's actually perfectly\nfine i think you've also done an\nawesome job of demonstrating a really\nimportant principle which is that\nsometimes you're just not ready for a\nparticular kind of engagement\nwith another person or a community and\nthat's okay\nand it's okay to work on yourself first\nand then maybe engage with a community\ni'm also kind of sometimes thinking\nabout relationships where sometimes\npeople may really want a relationship\nand they're just not\npersonally ready so thanks a lot for\ncoming on anyway\nappreciate it man oh no thank thank you\nfor uh\ngiving me the the time to come on so and\nand lastly i hope i'm not being harsh\nhere but\nif bracken was an [ __ ] to you you\nknow\nwe can hear brecken say that he's sorry\nand we hope that you can forgive him\nyeah i wanted to apologize personally\nthe person i said to but to be honest i\ndon't even remember who it was so\nthat's okay maybe they remember maybe\nthey don't but i think that's enough\ngood cool man oh yeah thank you thanks\nfor coming on\nhello hey man that's good\num and what are we calling you he-man\n493 or just he-man\nhe-man so he-man tell me what's going on\ni was\nbanned because from what he said um\ni was talking about hentai and he said\nthat the\ncomment was about um me saying i hated\nsisters\nokay can you can you tell us he meant a\nlittle bit about how you came to join\nthe healthy gamer discord\nuh i came to the healthy gamer discord\nbecause i had a gaming addiction\ngaming was actually more important to my\nfamily than my friends than anything\nelse\nso um being in the group kind of helped\nme have a lot\nmore perspective on what was more\nimportant um i actually\nimproved very much to where i was\nactually spending more time with my\nfamily\ni'm getting more projects done stuff\nlike that and so\nso it sounds like you were addicted to\ngames and then you kind of came in and\nwere doing better\noh yeah mostly mostly addiction came\nfrom like a lot of my um\ndealing with molestation and false\nallegations at my um work\nwas more of a coping mechanism okay and\nso\nwhat's your understanding of why you got\nbanned um\ni honestly have no clue um\nthe only conversation i can think of\nthat i was talking about hentai was in\nthe context of that\num a person was talking about in cells\nand how like\nyou know they have an issue with like uh\ndisrespecting women\nand i was making the comparison of the\nanime community\nwhere they are very addicted to hentai\nwhere they're very addicted to these\nparticular fictional characters we're to\nthe point where they even fall in love\nwith them\nand they don't want to improve they\ndon't want to try\nto be better instead it's more about hey\nyou know\nwhy should i even take a shower why\nshould i even you know get a job when i\nhave this\nhentai girl waiting for me at home every\nsingle day that's\nthe only thing i can think of so you\nwere kind of\nbut there was a conversation about like\nweebos or sorry why\nyeah or something and and so you're not\nyou're not really sure so maybe we can\njust ask moses\nmoses what's your understanding of of\nwhy he-man was banned\nokay so i'm gonna add the mod that\nactually banned he-man\nhi this one okay never mind so can you\ntell us a little bit about\nwhy he-man was banned the ban reason in\nitself\ndid say that behavior does not fall in\nline with the intention of the server\nself-promotion sending not safe over\ncontent in text channels\nand being inappropriate with members of\nthe healthy gamer community\nthe truth here is that like roughly a\nmonth ago we\ngot a report about he-man\nand another member of our community's\ninteraction with them outside of the\nserver\nwe found a lot of things\ndo you mind if i asked what was the\nreport that you guys received of his\nactivity oh yeah\nyeah so apparently there was this female\nmember\nwho you had discussed about going\nto talk on some anime podcasts\nyeah yeah she uh volunteered to come on\nto the\nuh podcast because she was interested in\njoining us\nand talking about anime and manga yeah\nokay\nthat sounds correct and it seems like\nwhat happened was that in her\ndescription at least\nshe pointed out that throughout your\ntalk\nyou kept trying to initiate a rather\nsexual conversation no um\ni don't do that what it was was that\num apparently from what my co-host\nand my partner who runs the business\nshe got afraid because she claimed that\nshe'd seen\nsomething in there that she did not like\num\nmy friend tried to understand what she\nwas talking about\nbut apparently she just left the group\ndid not explain her reasoning\nor whatever so let's let's go back to z\nyeah thanks for sharing your perspective\nhe-man yeah\ni appreciate you sharing but i would\nlike for you to not interrupt me you can\nwait until i'm done\nokay go ahead z yeah so from her\npoint of view um he man kept trying to\ninitiate their other sexual conversation\neven pointing out that he's interested\nin the bdsm community and that he's a\ndom and that he was into submissive\nwoman in itself this report was by the\nway\ntwo thousand characters long so it is a\nlittle bit difficult to summarize\nof course so then what did you guys\nnotice in the server\nso you said that yeah so this happened\noff of our server right so that brings\nup an interesting question about\ndo we act on things that happen outside\nof our server is that appropriate\nand when you guys so it prompted you\nguys to take a closer look which sounds\nreasonable to me\nyes so initially if something like this\nhappens what we do is that\nwe would consider mute and then\noverall look their behavior on the\nserver so\nthroughout our investigation we found a\nlot of\nself-promotion some questionable posts\nand statements\nand some not safer work\nposts as well i don't think so because\ni've never posted\na i don't think that's true\nso let's let's start with just one at a\ntime so you said self-promotion right\nsee what do you mean\nby that so apparently uh he-man seems to\nhave some kind of\npodcast where they talk about different\nkind of topics\num including hentai which in itself is\nnot safe for work so there's another\nrule broken there about keeping posts\nsafe for work well one um\nwe didn't tougher hentai until now and\nwe have no hentai\num content on there um two i posted that\nin the creators\num section so\nunless i was not allowed to do that i\nmean\ni don't know exactly what you define as\ncreators creative\nso could you do that yes that is\nactually very\ninteresting because when when this uh\nreport was brought to our\nattention and we looked up your post\nhistory it was kind of surprising for\nall of us that this had been going on\nfor so long without\nany of us catching on so it is maybe a\nfault on our part\nand could have been reported by other\nmembers or maybe even\nthe rules throughout your stay on the\nserver had changed\nfair enough so then so in addition to\nself-promotion\nz you said there were a couple of other\nthings that you all noticed or had\nconcerns about\nthere are some questionable posts and\nstatements\nthe thing is that um in okay it seems\nlike\nsome of these posts were not written by\nyou but they were\nshared by you so that in our opinion\nkind of reflects on your behavior\nand what you stand for so there was this\none go ahead there was this one post\nwhere it actually says sisters are\n[ __ ] worthless\nmine won't do [ __ ] to help me relieve me\nof my sexual\npoverty won't hook me up with her\nfriends won't bring me to parties won't\ngive me money so i can get facial\nservices\noh i know exactly what that was very\nlong post but that those are the few\nfirst lines of it oh i know exactly what\nthat was about\nwhat that was about was we were having a\ndiscussion about me being an um\ni was uh um talking about my experience\ndealing with incels when they were\ntrying to\nharass me um they actually called me a\ntyrone\nand rachel pro found me i think that was\nlike some black chat or something\nand they sent me all this stuff and i\nwas showing these people what these guys\nwere doing\ntheir discord got banned so it wasn't\nreally me\ntrying to say i hate sisters because i\ndon't have any to really hate\num it was me more showing uh the gamer\nuh\nhealthy gamer gg community what these\nguys actually believe in\nwhat these guys stand for and why they\nstand for it\num so again i will add it's very\nimportant to ask for context when you\nmake these\nbands because when you don't\na lot of people can get unfairly banned\nand they can piss them off\nso it's very important to just may have\npulled me to the side and say\nhey what was this about or\ndo you really believe in this because\nbanning me outright\nwas just kind of kind of wrong but\nthat's just my opinion\nand was there anything else that you\nguys kind of wanted to add that\nthat sort of contributed to the ban um\nanother one is\ni think ultimately a lot of guys don't\nhave enough confidence\nthat there will be any more single woman\nthat they want and if\npeople suggest to them why don't you get\na trans woman and why don't you date a\nsingle mother\nthey'll get angry just because it's almo\nit's almost like getting a consolation\nprize\nthe reason why i said that is because\nthere are a lot of men\nin the uh gamer community that for some\nreason believe\nthat they are unfairly treated\nbecause they do not they're not able to\nget the\num scarlett johansson's or the very\npretty women in the world\nand they believe that if a woman who\nhas a child or a woman who is a little\nbit overweight\nor a woman who may not fit the beauty\nstandards of society\nare attracted to them they feel as if\nthey're getting a consolation pride\nso that is what i was trying to uh\num say in that dm was that these men\nare not looking at the bigger picture\nthey're not looking at this woman who's\nactually showing them actually affection\nand loving them for them\nbut they're judging that woman based\nupon\noh she's not really pretty she's not\nshe has a child or she\nshe's too ugly for me that's what it was\nso ximena let me ask you a question have\nyou been watching the other ban appeals\nyep and what have you thought so far\nhave you thought that those ban appeals\nwere dealt with in a fair way\nyeah i believe that it was uh that\num well more or less i would have maybe\nhad a private call\nnot on twitch but i do believe that it\nwas much more better for them to be able\nto kind of\nspeak on their behalf and you know you\nknow\nsay their piece and generally speaking\nso sometimes we've sort of like arrived\nat some conclusions and i know this is\ngoing to sound kind of weird but\ntwitch chat also has like voiced their\nopinion have you felt like twitch chat's\nopinion has been relatively fair\num i i honestly am not watching\num twitch chat right now so i don't know\nokay so i'll give you like an example so\nthe first guy said that he said some\nreally vicious things and he was kind of\nin an emotionally bad place\nand that he didn't really feel like he\nwas like ready to come back to the\nserver and twitch chat sort of agreed\nand so that's something so then the\nquestion that i have so we haven't asked\nto a chat but in a second we're going to\npull twitch at and we're going to ask\nthem whether\nwe think you should be unbanned or not\nif they say that you're unbanned do you\nthink that would be fair\nyeah i guess if they say that you should\nremain banned\ndo you think that would be fair sure\nokay so let's ask do you really think so\num\ni mean i wouldn't mind being unbanned i\ndon't think that anything i said was\nlike\ntoxic or anything there was no i i\nwasn't\ni wasn't trying to like post anything\nunsafe for work it was more of where\nthis was just showing us more of an\nexample of a conversation\nyeah i get you man so so i think what\nzeke commented i i think\ni i can tell as well is that like you\nhave a different perspective right\nso you're saying that like z's\nperspective like there's a different\nside of things so what i'm asking you is\nwhen a bunch of people\nseem to have a perspective that isn't\nyour own\nhow do you know whether they're wrong or\nyou're wrong\nhonestly i all i know is that what i\nknow and i'll\nonly know what i what my intention was\nfrom the post\nand it wasn't to um\ntry to troll or anything like that i\ni get you i i get you i think you've\nmade that very clear\nand at the same time the question that\ni'm asking you is i agree\nthat all you know is what you know and\nwhen\nother people tell you something else how\ndo you reconcile\nwhat you know versus what other people\nare telling you\nhow do you know whether what you know is\nright or wrong like how do you\ncritically look at your own thought\nprocess\nand statements to know like sure you\nhave your perspective right so you said\nthat like\nessentially like you weren't advocating\nfor that you are using that as actually\nan example\nof what is back what so in a sense you\nactually like side completely with the\nmods that you were\nyou posted something not as a\nrepresentation of your own views\nbut as a representation of views that\nyou strongly disagree with and that you\nthink are wrong\nmakes sense to me and at the same time\nwhat i would encourage you so let's go\nahead and just ask twitch at whether\nwe think that you should be banned or\nunbanned\nand he meant what i would encourage you\nto do so it would make sense to me if\nthey felt\nlike um you know that\nyou have sort of a counterpoint to a lot\nof this kind of stuff\nand at the same time it would also make\nsense to me that like sometimes talking\nto women about how you're a dom\nand and women feeling like you're sort\nof\nsexually inappropriate with them on a\npodcast\nand something that you don't understand\nbecause all you see is what you know\nthat's something that's worth looking at\ndoes that make sense\nno that wasn't right either i didn't\ntalk to anybody about me being a dom\nor anything like that what was that\nstatement\num yeah so in the report it clearly\nstates\nthat he-man randomly told me that he was\ninto bdsm\ncommunity and that he's a dom and if i\nknew what adom was and that he liked\nsubmissive\nwoman out of the blue i tried to keep\nthis conversation\nbeing about anime podcasting but he kept\nmentioning\nsexual harassment topics um\nno so hold up hold on a second amen\nso i know you say no in response to that\nso let's just forget about what actually\nhappened\nthe question that i'm asking you is when\nsomeone has a perspective\nthat is very different from your own how\ndo you approach that\ndo you just say no and they're wrong and\ni'm right\nwell i told them that's not what i said\ni mean\nand do they have any evidence of me\nactually saying it\num it's it's from as far as i can\ntell from this young lady she either\nmisheard\nor misinterpreted what i was saying that\nwas\nnot what we were talking about great\nhe-man so now we get to something\ninteresting right so when a lot of\npeople\nconsistently mishear or misinterpret\nwhat you say how do you deal with that\ni try to correct them i try to have a\nconversation with them\nyeah so maybe buddy what you should do\nis when a lot of people are mishearing\nyou\nmaybe you should instead of correcting\nthem think about\nlike the way that you're coming across\nbecause what i'm hearing is a pattern of\nmisunderstanding\nright that's the way that you're\ndescribing it and generally speaking in\nmy experience\nwhen there's a pattern of\nmisunderstanding that revolves around\none person that person is the one that's\ndoing most of the misunderstanding\nuh that's sure um\nit's something to think about i mean i\ndon't have a rule\nfor you but i i i'm not trying to bully\nyou or anything like that i'm just\nsaying that like\nso by the way so i i think 75 of people\ndon't believe you should be on band so\nthey think that the ban is appropriate\nand i recognize i can see how that's\nlike really confusing\nbecause the whole point here is you\nstarted this conversation off with\nsaying\ni don't understand why i was banned and\nyou don't see\nanything that you did wrong and you\nprovide actually good\nreasons right so if like mods are\nbanning you for quoting something\nthat you are actually like in the\ncontext of the conversation you're\nsaying\nit's inappropriate to use the word dildo\nwhen you're talking to someone\nand then they ban you for using the word\ndildo it's like what the [ __ ] mods\ni was saying that it's inappropriate\ndoes that make sense\nyeah it almost sounded like either she\nonly listened to a portion of what i\nsaid or\nmaybe she just maybe what she was saying\nuh what i was saying\nshe thought i was talking about that i i\nget that and my point to you is that\nwhen you\nare have a pattern of interactions\nwhere it appears to you like people are\nonly listening to a portion of what\nyou're saying\nand not giving you the appropriate\ncontext maybe that's a reason to\nre-examine your\nown communication because there is a\npattern of misunderstanding what you're\ntrying to say\nand so when there's a pattern of\nmisunderstanding what you're trying to\nsay\nyou can try to convince the rest of the\nworld that you're not saying what you're\nsaying\nor maybe you're conveying something that\nyou don't realize you're conveying\nokay does that make sense\nsure yeah i get it i mean you don't\nsound like you sound like you\nare conceding the point but i don't i'm\nnot\ni feel like you you still don't really\nget it i get it\ni get it i'm not i'm not i'm genuinely\ndude because i i think\nlike everything that you're saying\nactually makes sense to me\nand i think like that's what's so tragic\nabout the situation is i don't think\nthat your intentions\nare genuinely bad and if you know i it's\nreally bizarre i i don't know\nwhat to think when one person has an\nimpression that you're like\nasking them if they like submissives and\nyou're telling them about\nhow you're a dom and you're saying you\nnever said that i don't know what to\nmake of that\nwhat i wonder about is that when there's\nlike when you have\nthat kind of experience with like a\ndozen people and i'm not saying that\nit's a dozen people and you can dispute\nthat point what i'm saying is that\nand z sort of said it right she's like\neach of these things on their own is\nlike it's not really potentially a\nbannable offense\nbut there's something here that the mods\nfeel like is like generally\ninappropriate\nand so it makes sense to me that you're\nconfused why you got banned because\nyou really don't feel like you stepped\nout of line and what i'm saying is that\nmaybe you didn't explicitly step out of\nline but that there's a lot of\ncommunication\nthat you're offering which for some\nreason is perceived\nby multiple people in a different way\nfrom what you're conveying\nand when any time i have\nsomething that i think i'm saying and\none person disagrees\nsure maybe i'll try to convince them but\nif there are a dozen people that i have\na conversation with and they\nall sort of read something into what i'm\nsaying that like i don't think i'm\nsaying\nit really causes me to look at my\ncommunication\nso i would really encourage you to do\nthat\nall right that's something i can do and\ni\ni really do appreciate you coming on\nbecause i think this is a this is\nactually an awesome example\nof how like communication can be really\nconfusing and some people feel like\nbands\nare inappropriate now i don't know\nactually it's not my place to decide\nwhether the ban is appropriate or\ninappropriate\ni just know that generally speaking i\nthink our mods do a pretty good job and\ni think i would encourage you to like\nbecause i i do think actually twitch\nchat is like pretty good about this\nand you know twitch hat does feel like\nthe band was kind of appropriate and so\nlike i would really like take this as an\nopportunity for self-reflection\nand and maybe it is just that you know\nyou're quoting things inappropriately\nbut like\ni would really stop and think you know\nbecause if people are perceiving\nthat you're talking about you know bdsm\nin an inappropriate manner like i would\nreally try to figure out where that's\ncoming from\nokay right because it does seem like\nit's not just one person\nit's like there's a pattern of like\nright on the edge kind of stuff that\nsome people feel is over the line and\nyou don't feel as overblind and you're\nentitled to your opinion\nand i get where you're coming from and\nat the same time the pattern sort of\nlike bothers me a little bit and i think\ndeserves some amount of reflection\nokay thanks for coming on man appreciate\nit\nand good luck to you in your anime\npodcast\nyeah yeah thanks\nyou"
