    "transcript": "hi how are you okay awesome yeah\nthank you very much um\nyeah so thanks for coming on and do i\ncall you amaranth or is that\nkate is fine kate yes okay um thanks for\ncoming on kate\nuh yeah it was nice to meet you a couple\nweeks ago on the scuffed podcast\ni watched your stream from time to time\nuh but it was really cool to hear your\nperspectives on\nkind of mental health so thanks very\nmuch for sharing those\nno problem i think i'm going to have you\non my screen too so if you need to crop\nmy window so that you're not shown twice\nthen you can do that if possible\nokay um thanks for letting me know that\nyou were doing that so\nand it's kate you said yes and what did\nyou\nso i saw that our topic today was going\nto be something about social media\nyeah i was thinking just more of like\nthe various effects\nthat social media from the creator side\ncan have\non the mentality of the streamer or\nyoutube or whatever it is\nyeah i'd love to hear your perspectives\non that\nyeah well i'm saying something i've\nnoticed for me personally i think the\nbiggest\nchange with social media is like i feel\nlike\ni don't have as much personality as i\ndid before i started streaming you know\nlike day in and day out it's like\nbecause i guess everything's so\nmonotonous\nthat i feel like i no longer partake in\nthe activities that made me me\nthat's kind of frightening a little bit\nto say that you\nlike no like have less personality or no\nlonger have personality\nyeah it's like really weird it's like i\nguess for smiling it's a lot harder for\nme to do that like i used to\nlike i just noticed in myself like i\nguess less bubbly because i used to do\nlike disney princess parties and stuff\nfor kids birthdays before i started\nstreaming and that became like something\nthat was like a part of my like normal\nidentity too where i was just smiling\nall the time\nyou know i was like positive person and\ni guess like social media\ni've noticed that physically my mouth\ndoesn't feel as comfortable smiling so i\ndon't do it as much\nyou know i'm hearing emotion in your\nvoice\nyeah yeah i'm a very emotional person\ntoo\ndo you mind if i ask what you're feeling\nright now as you say that\nconcern okay what are you concerned\nabout\nhow to like keep that balance right\nbecause i think that's like the biggest\nproblem i found\nis chasing long-term happiness as like\ngoal-oriented for being a social media\nperson like what i want to achieve in\nlife\nversus like short-term mental\nlike happiness i guess like short-term\nindulgences versus like keeping the\ngrind up to achieve long-term\ndreams if that makes sense yeah it does\nmake sense you know usually i say this\nlater but can i think for a second yeah\ngo for it because i'm hearing a lot of\nimportant stuff\nfrom what you're saying kate um yeah and\ndon't\ndon't get like too concerned if i sound\nemotional part of my problem is i can't\nbreathe very well so like\ni get over anxiety feelings much easier\nthan normal people i guess\nso i have a breathing issue so like i\ncan't breathe deeply when talking about\nthings\nso i just like sound like i'm about to\ncry but like emotionally i feel okay\noh okay that's useful to know so\num\ni'm curious about your breathing issues\nbut i i think that's more on the medical\nside\nyeah it's it's just something i notice\nthat if i like stop and i breathe\nand then that the waiver in the voice\nfades but like if i keep going in a\nsentence without breathing it's just\nit just sounds really bad yeah it sounds\nworse than it actually is\nhow long have you been breathing like\nthat\num i guess my whole life has been\ndeviated but it's gotten worse i've\ngotten older\nbecause i think the cartilage is like\ngrowing against my favor\nyou know just as my nose ages\ninteresting something i have to fix soon\nbut that's like another issue is like\nscheduling time to get things like that\nfixed when it would take like a hiatus\nfrom social media and losing that\nmomentum and stuff\nokay so it sounds like there's really a\ncost to taking care of yourself\nyeah exactly yeah i'm\nyou know not to sound bleak kate but i'm\nalmost like\nhearing that you're kind of losing a\npart of yourself\nyeah i agree um i mean that's\n[ __ ] frightening you know\nand and so what and by the way disney\nprincess party sound awesome i think my\nkids would\nabsolutely love that they wear um\nthey have we got them elsa costumes for\nhalloween like\ntwo years ago yeah yeah\nmaybe one year ago it's it's rusty now\nbut and they wear them like once a week\nlike my older kid will just be like\ntoday is an elsa costume day and she'll\njust like\nat 12 30 yeah she'll just like it you\nknow after lunch she'll go\nupstairs to her room and she'll actually\nlike change and then she'll fold her\nclothes and put them away\nwhich is really awesome i mean because\nshe doesn't leave the mask she used to\nleave the mess but she'll just like\ntoday is an elsa costume kind of day and\nit's not really a costume it's just like\nshe just puts on her elster dress\nbest halloween costume money we've ever\nspent\noh yeah yeah they love that stuff i used\nto do it like every weekend so\ni saw all the dresses all the kids built\nthe songs it was like a really like\nreally fun wholesome time yeah and\nand i i guess tell me about what that\nperson was like\nthe person who did those kinds of things\ncan you tell me i guess that kind of\nthing it wasn't so much that like\ni was different in the way i was thought\nabout things but just like i felt like i\nwas more happy\nbut i think some of that comes to do\nwith like the whole spontaneous nature\nof that job right every party was\ndifferent and i noticed that with\nstreaming every day even though you\nmight be doing different things on\nstream\nthe routine is mostly the same okay\nand i feel like that's hard for me\nbecause i do have add you know\nand so it feels like that's like almost\nlike emotionally\nlike life sucking you know but at the\nsame time\ni also have like a huge goal that i want\nto achieve and i know that social media\nis like the best way to get there\nlike monetarily you know and it's also\nlike\ni feel really lucky to have social media\nbecause so many people\nwant to have a platform and they don't\nforget it\nso part of me feels like um i need to be\nable to take advantage of the\nopportunity while i have it because you\nknow how long it's going to last you\nknow\nyeah so i'm hearing like you kind of\nbeing stuck or pulled in a lot of\ndifferent directions\non the one hand you have goals on the\nother hand\nyou're grateful and lucky to have the\nopportunities that you have\nand on at the same time i'm sort of\nnoticing that like\ntaking advantage of those opportunities\nand being grateful for what you've been\ngiven\nalso comes at like a significant\npersonal cost\nyeah that's really tough i mean how do\nyou\nyeah i i mean it sounds it\nbecause i'm i'm sort of hearing you give\na piece of yourself like every single\nday\nwhen you do something that's a little\nbit more grindy and maybe you don't feel\nlike it but you recognize like this is\nan amazing opportunity so\nyou sort of like want to do it and you\ndo want to do it but it just it seems\nit sounds like it's hard to do yeah\nwhat makes it hard\ni guess like for me um i don't take\nbreaks\nthat's probably what makes it hard\nbecause i think for the past four years\nit's been like\nstream stream stream stream stream like\nlike\nnot just like two hours a day but like\nanywhere from i guess\neight to 15 hours days of streams yeah\nand i don't take vacations or days off\nbecause i'm like oh no the momentum\ni would lose all the moments when\nworking towards because like in\nstreaming what i've noticed is like\nto build something like sub number for\nexample it's the easiest to measure just\nby the numbers\nit can take months to build a few\nthousand extra subs\nbut then if you disappear for a week you\ncan lose them like that\nyou know so it's like a very like high\ncost type of job for if you take time\noff\nyeah that's hard so it sounds like you\nhave to\nevery day off is like\ntaking away something you built right\ndo you feel trapped kate a little bit\nbecause i didn't like i guess for me\nit's like i started streaming about four\nyears ago\nso this has been most of my like young\nadult life\nright and it's like if you don't do\nstream it's like you can't\nthere's really no other job that i can\nthink about that would have like\nthe same freedom of getting to do what i\nwant and also the same level of\nfinancial support that it brings\ntowards like just living plus what i\nwant to achieve later\nand and can you do you mind sharing what\nyou want you mentioned that once or\ntwice what do you want to achieve later\ni want to open a animal rescue ranch\neventually like no kill\nno snow cage so it would be like dog\nsanctuary plus some like more farm\nanimals too maybe\nand that's gonna be like a huge thing\nthat i went like about a big scale\nso it's really difficult for me to like\njustify time off because i feel like\nit's taking away from that\nopportunity you know\nso it's like a difficult balance it's\nlike long term i know that\ndoing it like i have is mentally\ndraining so i'm probably not performing\nat my top level\nso like even though i'm streaming every\nday i'm probably not growing as much as\ni\ncould be if i was actually like um\nmentally healthy because you know\nthere's a vibe that people have and\nthey're like they got it all together\njust more charismatic to be around but\nthen if\ni focus on my short term happiness and\nlike get myself put together then i have\nless momentum and more distractions to\nkeep me from actually doing the job\nit sounds like there are a lot of things\nmore important than you\nprobably let's play a part of it\ni mean that's what i'm hearing right i'm\nhearing that\nlike there are a lot of things like it's\nlike kate\nversus growing your stream kate\nversus the animal rescue wrench\nkate versus amaranth\nand and usually like kate ends up at the\nbottom which i think is how you end up\nfour years without a break right because\ni'm kind of noticing that\nyou know whenever you would take a break\nthere's just some voice in your head\nthat says but like\nactually this is more important so you\ncan't do that\nyeah what does that do to you\nsee i don't know that's the scary part\nlike i feel like i'm past\nlike people always say like don't keep\ngoing you're gonna burn out but i feel\nlike i would have burned out by now so i\nmight be past that point and i just\ndon't even know anymore\nhow do you i'm like\nhow do you feel on a day-to-day basis\ni don't really know i don't think about\nit you know\nit's like i just do it\nsometimes we don't think about things\nbecause\nwe don't like what we would discover\nthat's the thing i don't really know\nwhat i would discover\nhow do you feel about yourself\nthat's the scary part is i don't know\nanymore\nwhat's scary about that\ni feel like a robot a little bit\ni mean that's how you treat yourself\nright\nevery day wake up grind and for a good\nreason\ni think one of the hard hardest things\nkate is that some of the worst things\nthat we do to ourselves\nare not out of like selfish reasons but\nactually selfless reasons\nwhen we sacrifice we do it for bigger\ncauses right\ncauses with a capital c\nyeah and it's hard because if you don't\nmake that sacrifice then\nyou know you're one step away from\n[Music]\nthe rescue ranch and you're one step\naway from all of those animals that need\nlove and protection and support and it\ncan almost feel like\nyour sacrifice like it's like there's\neither you sacrifice yourself or you\nsacrifice them\nright is that how it feels\nyeah i would say so like just the the\nlong term and don't don't feel bad yet\nif i'm crying i'm like i'm okay i can\nstill talk it's just\nmy body that's how i just don't respond\nto any kind of stress whether it's anger\nsadness anxiety overwhelm happiness i\njust cry it's just that's just me\num yeah that's pretty much how it feels\ni guess it's like do i\ncater to myself which feels shitty\nbecause to me it's like the animals have\nsuch a shorter life\nand you know there's the whole concept\nof like if an animal gets stuck in a\nshelter\nit sometimes can live just a few days\nand then they kill it because there's\nnot enough space\nso it feels really bad to like try and\nvalue my life over theirs you know\nso how does it feel if you value\nyourself over them\nselfish i guess\nand how long have you been trying to not\nbe a selfish person\ni guess most of my life i've just always\nhad like a very big\nrespect for animals and wanting to help\nthem since i was a kid\ni think part of that comes from like not\nreally having many like social\nguides in my family you know because my\nparents didn't really have friends\ncoming over i never had like a social\nexample i was never good at making human\nfriends\ni was always just friends with the dogs\non my street\ncan you tell me a little bit more about\nthat\num yeah i guess like i would just go\noutside sometimes and like every day\nlike\nmy neighbors dogs just come up and roll\nover for belly rubs and it was just like\na genuine connection where it felt like\nyou could actually connect to them\nwithout\nneeding to be good at talking you know\nand then from like a family where it's\nmy parents are always working\nand i was like left at home most of the\ntime you get really lonely right\nand so animals became like the only\nthing i cared about\njust how it is you said animals became\nthe only thing that you cared about but\ni wonder if it's\nanimals really made you feel cared for\nyeah that too there's like a mutual yeah\nwhat was it like so it sounds like you\ngrew up without siblings\nuh it's a little complicated i guess\nbecause i had an\nolder brother who's kind of who's my\nhalf brother that i really connected\nwith\nbut then when i was four he moved in\nwith his dad since i was from my mom's\nsecond marriage\nso he left the house and then i was\nstuck with my other brother who had like\nthe middle child complex if you've seen\nthat before where it's like they don't\nget the attention of the young one but\nthey also don't get\ntreated with respect like the older ones\nso they just kind of like\nact out out of spite so he was kind of\nrude to me until he became an adult like\nyou know like big brother like pigs on\nlike no you can't play with me yeah like\nsibling\nviolence i guess not like actual damage\njust like without hitting each other\nyeah so just sibling rivalry baby yeah\nthat's better yeah and and what was\ni mean can you tell me a little bit more\nabout um\nyou know what kind of situation you grew\nup in or what your house was like\ngrowing up\num i guess it was just pretty boring\nlife you know because it says that my\nparents were working but we didn't have\nenough money to actually do anything\nso we had enough money to survive but we\nnever traveled we never\nlike spent much time together so it was\njust kind of like\nthere was nothing wrong with the family\nyou know like there was never\nlike domestic violence or never never\nabused like my parents argued a lot but\ni feel like most couples with\nfinancial problems do that anyways so\nnothing out of the ordinary\nit was just like a lot of alone time i\nguess because they were always working\nit sounds like you understand why there\nwas a lot of alone time\nyeah and you kind of you recognize that\nthat was sort of a necessity because\nthey had to work\nyeah do you remember how you felt\num bored a lot\nso like uh i didn't actually get my own\ndogs i guess so i was like 12 because my\nparents\ndidn't want me to have that\nresponsibility as a child because they\nweren't there enough to be able to\nhelp so i just like\nstarted playing video games a lot and\nlike did art and stuff\nso i found though that like with my 80d\nlike stuff like art there's only\ni can focus on that like there are a few\nthings i can hyper focus on like\nlike training dogs art horseback riding\nand i think like\num graphic design if i made like\nweb web images so i used to like do like\nrole play on\nneopets because it was a dork and very\nlonely so\nso like certain things i could hyper\nfocus on but another thing is i was just\nlike really bored\nsuper easily okay and and what was high\nschool like for you\nmore of the same to be honest i was kind\nof like i guess a social outcast because\ni didn't have any social\nguides in my life so i never kind of\nlearned how to talk to people and how to\nlike\nbe emotionally savvy with other humans\nit was more of just like\nthe loner waiting people to talk to me\nand that never works when\neveryone's waiting for people to talk to\nthem i found that as an adult\nyeah it's like no no that's not\nproactive enough to actually make\nfriends\nand and so it sounds like like you've\nlearned a lot it sounds like you weren't\nreally modeled\nuh there wasn't good modeling in terms\nof how to you know engage with people\nbut at the same time just the fact that\nyou're talking about it like that\nsuggests to me that you've like figured\nthat out and you've\ngrown in some way yeah i think we talked\nabout on my own podcast a lot when i\nhave other girl influencers come on is\nthat we're all\nso afraid of reaching out to each other\nbecause we don't want to be seen as like\na leech\nthat like ends up just all of us are\nlonely and don't talk to people\nand how did you learn to overcome that\num i guess just by being online it's\neasier right because it's like you send\nthem a message and you're like hey\ncome be on my podcast it's so much\ndifferent than walking up to somebody\nand being like do you want to be friends\ndude it's like a lot less scary\nand and or do you feel like socially\nmore adept\nnow interpersonally or not so much\ni feel like i can manage better um\nat conventions especially like i feel\nlike i can talk to people\neasier now but\nthere is always like that fear i guess\nfrom social media that's like you don't\nknow what their intentions are\nif they're meeting you at the convention\nlike i always have to have security and\nstuff it's just like it has a problem i\nhave a problem trusting people now\nbecause i have so many like stalker\ntypes\nthat do follow me so it's like i can i\ncan manage better socially but there's\nstill part of me that like can't\ntruly connect in a genuine way sure\nwhat what do you mean by their stalker\ntypes uh\ni does have various stalkers but you\ndon't really know who they are in person\nright so like all you know is your\npersona so you don't really know what\nthey look like often so you can't really\nlike trust them\nat conventions when you meet people\nbecause you don't know who\nin real life was actually being really\ncreepy to you online\num so i i'm noticing a change in\nin the tone of our conversation it seems\nlike a little bit easier\ndoes it feel that way yeah\nit's just i'm trying to breathe more\ngood for you breathing is important\num yeah i had a couple of thoughts about\nunderstanding the relationship between\nyour body and your mind\nand uh you know we can go down that road\nin a second but\njust to kind of give you a quick heads\nup so you know i ask you\nsometimes kate some questions about how\nyou feel about yourself\nand you're saying i don't really know\nand that in and of itself sounds kind of\nscary right\nis that fair to say yeah and then at the\nsame time i'm noticing that you also say\nthat this is just how my body reacts\nlike and so yeah\nperfect so that's a great observation so\nthe question is like how does that work\nand in my experience oftentimes people\nwho don't know what's going on\nin their mind feel it in their body\nand so if there is some kind of like so\ni i mean i\nreally see this oftentimes more with men\nbut like\nthey don't know the vocabulary\nor they feel colorblind to their\nfeelings\nbut they can like sense it in their body\nin terms of like tension or you know\nthey get like a lot of tightness around\nthe shoulders they can clench their\nfists\nthings like that so we can talk a little\nbit down the road if you'd like to about\nmaybe how your body is sending you\nsignals about how you feel about things\neven if you're not consciously aware of\nthem\nright okay also you know i mean i i\ndon't want to go down the road of\nactually\nhaving a medical conversation but one\nother thing that i've noticed\nis that you know there's good data that\nsuggests that breathing issues and\nanxiety are actually like very\ntightly connected um so for example\ndiseases like asthma are worsened\ndepending on your mental state\nand there's actually like physiological\nreasons for that\nso depending on you know hormones like\ncortisol and like other things they can\nactually make your breathing worse\num so high stress states for prolonged\nperiods of time will negatively impact\nyour respiratory system\nso there may be something kind of there\nbut so those are just like\nthat's you know one or two thoughts i\nwanted to hear a little bit about\nkind of what your upbringing was because\nsometimes when people are feeling a\ncertain way in terms of\nwhat i'm basically hearing from you is\nthat you're not really sure who you\nare anymore you're kind of like losing\nyourself\nin the grind yeah\nand it seems like a lot of the reason\nthat you grind that way is because of\nthese like\nbig goals like goals with a capital g\nand so i was and and part of the reason\nthat\nyou have those big i mean i think part\nof the reason that you sacrifice\nyourself is because you do\nplace other things above you\nand so the reason i was asking about\nyour upbringing is because sometimes\npeople are sort of taught that\nso they're taught that they may be not\nas important as other things or they're\ntaught oddly enough like\nselfless sacrifice to the point of\nhurting yourself\ncan be taught two ways one is if you\nwere very very neglected\nthe second is if actually someone did\nthat for you\nand then you're kind of like that was\nthe behavior that was modeled\nright um does any of that sort of like\nring a bell or resonate\nor gain traction with you i know i sort\nof kind of talked about a lot of\ndifferent stuff i understand what you're\nsaying but i don't think that any of\nthat was actually in my childhood\nbecause for the most part you know my\nparents worked like they still told me\nthey loved me\nyou know it's like they've gotten\nfrustrated with each other but like as\nan adult you understand\nwhy as a kid you're just like oh shut up\nit's like y'all are so annoying\ntype of thing because like you know you\ncan hear them doing in like your room or\noutside\njust about like stupid stuff like you\ndidn't get cabbage this is lettuce\nit's like really really stupid\nthings yeah i don't think that my\nchildhood really affected me in that way\nas far as my upbringing maybe just the\nisolation\nset me on the path for like social\nissues\nlike nothing that really like it's not\nso much anything that they did\nspecifically i guess more of what they\ndidn't do as far as like show examples\nand like this is how people socialize\nwith each other\nyeah it sounds like they were pretty\nbusy so they may not have had time to do\nthat\nyeah so thanks for sharing that i i\nthink um i'm kind of with you there kate\nit doesn't seem like this is something\nthat started in your childhood not\neverything does\nand so then let me ask you something you\nknow when did you\nlearn how did you learn to like put\nyourself\nlast\nwhen did you start doing that\ni'm not sure when i feel like part of it\nwas probably um when i was streaming\ni think in 2017 and then while i was\nstreaming\none of my dogs started having like bloat\nwhich is um i didn't find that\nout to later what it was but that's when\nlike the dog's stomach if he eats too\nfast\nor drinks too fast and then goes to do\nan activity sometimes the stomach can\nstart filling with\nair and then it turns on itself and it\nstarts expanding and it cuts off all of\ntheir like organs and they just like die\nwithin 30 minutes and that's what\nhappened i didn't know what's happening\nat the time it was super traumatic\nyeah but i feel like after that is when\ni said myself last probably\nat some level i know that i couldn't\nstop it but i still feel responsible for\nhim dying because i was streaming at the\ntime\ni know like there was nothing i could do\nright it's one of those things that\nhappens it could literally happen if\nlike someone else was feeding your dogs\nyou weren't home\nor if you just put your food outside and\ngo put do something else like\nit could happen at any time it was just\nsome really bad coincidence that\nhappened while i was streaming so\nyeah i can hear that your mind\nunderstands that but how do you feel\nabout it\nshitty okay\ni can understand that you would feel\nthat way what does that mean\njust like if i had been\nthere with him while he was eating maybe\nhe wouldn't have ran and got his\nbloat started you know but i know that\nlike especially since i didn't even know\nwhat it was at the time\ni would have no idea right it wasn't\nsomething that i was aware of and was\njust like neglecting the situation it's\nsomething that's not even talked about\nby vets very much\nthey just say oh dogs of this breed can\nbe prone to bloat but they never\nactually explain what that\nis or the symptoms or anything oh my god\nyeah so it's like it's like common in\ngerman shepherds and stuff\noh was it was your dog a german shepherd\nor a german shepherd\ni grew up with a few german shepherds\num so it's uh so\nkate i'm hearing you kind of like you\ni'm seeing emotionally i'm seeing one\nthing\nand the words that are coming out of\nyour mouth seem to be something else\nso like you're saying it wasn't my fault\nit's a coincidence\nit could have happened at any time and\nit sounds like you really understand\nthat and yet\nyou still feel pretty shitty about it\ni'm guessing that you feel guilty\nlike there's a disconnect it's like i\nknow i shouldn't but they still do\nyeah so why shouldn't you feel guilty\nbecause there's nothing i could do at\nthe time for him right\nbecause it's like it happened at\nmidnight and the only way to for them to\neven have a chance of living if it\nstarts doing that is to get them to like\nan emergency\nclinic and there were like none around\nme at midnight and the operation then\nmay not even work to save sure so it was\nlike something that like really\nwas just an unfortunate thing that i\ncouldn't do anything about\nso i know that it's not my fault like\nthat he had this\nbut i also just it feels bad right\nbecause it's like you wish you would\nspend more time with them\nyeah and and so i want you to pay\nattention to what you said there i know\nit's not my fault\nbut it feels bad and what i hear you\ndoing right now is reassuring yourself\ndoes that make sense like you're almost\nlike a friend consoling yourself\nyou're you're trying to tell the longest\ntime i did feel like it was my fault but\nlike i've come to terms like no there's\nlike it could\nliterally happen at any time you could\nbe out of town and someone would come\nfeed them and it could still happen\nyeah or you could be with them and you\nwouldn't i mean you can't\nknow what's happening to their stomach\nright\nyou know so it sounds like you feel\npretty\nbeat up about that and and you know i\nasked you when did you start putting\nyourself last and then you came up with\nthis story\nso how has this affected you\ni think it made me feel like um\nafterwards it's like yeah i gave him\nlike he i guess i got him when he was\nlike six months old so i've had until he\nwas five and this happened and i was\nlike he got to live five like really\ngood years imagine all those dogs in the\nshelter because i\ndidn't get him from a shelter who gets\nto live there for like a week and\nbecause no one claims them they just\nkill them\nyou know and so i guess like feeling\nguilty for that even though like i know\ni shouldn't kind of like make me\nfind my life purpose so in a way like\nit's something i'm really passionate\nabout so i know that\ngood has come from the incident as\nhorrible as it sounds\nbut it just feels really bad though\nbecause he didn't get to live longer\nyou know it really is a real tragedy\nand so i i had to see him die right i\nlike saw him having\nseizures it was like a really traumatic\nlike nightmare type of\ntraumatizing event for a long time\nand now like i still have nightmares\noccasionally of like\na zombie version of him coming out of\nthe ground and running around which is\nreally [ __ ] up but it's like it\naffects me still\nafter three years but i also know that\nit's something that i can't do anything\nabout\nso what do we do when something affects\nus and we can't do anything about it\nwe cry yeah\nright so kate i'm getting the sense that\nyou you're still\ncarrying this burden and even though you\nknow it's not\nreally logical at the same time\nso if we think about behavior behavior\nis not just\nmotivated by logic\nright and and i'm kind of i'm getting\nthe sense that there's like that emotion\nis part of what keeps you from taking\ncare of yourself and taking a break and\nthings like that because it's sort of\nlike\nlike does that make sense\nand what do you think about that\ni don't really know it's more of just\nlike one of the things like i really\nwant this skull\nand so i just keep going and then that's\nwhy i'm confused i'm like do i\nchase the long-term dreams that i know\nwould make me like\nfulfilled in my life ultimately like\nwhat i really want to do my passion\nor do i like take care of myself in the\nmoment and like\nindulge in little like moments of joy to\nkeep myself mentally staying\nat the risk of like my momentum of the\ncareer because it is a very momentum\nbased\nthing that i found with social media so\nit's like if you take a little time off\nthen\nyou're like monetization directly is\nimpacted\nyou know yeah\ncan i think for a second yeah go for it\nit may be a long second\nit's okay my second's thinking about\nhaving very long too\nwhy are you less deserving than other\npeople or animals\nhmm i don't know if it's so much i\nconsider myself less deserving it's just\nthat it's hard for me to\nwant other things like as much\nwhat do you mean by other things like\ntaking free time off feels less\nrewarding to me\nthan having my animal ranch fulfilled\nbecause it's like the things i could do\nin the meantime like\ntake a day off go for it i don't know\nwhatever mental\nhealth things people do to relax what\nare they gonna go to the spa\nthey travel i don't even know i've never\ndone any of it\nit's like i don't know i just like free\ntime\nhaving free time quote unquote doesn't\nfeel as rewarding to me\nokay sorry i'm getting it\nalone though right all i have is like me\nand my dogs which is great but dogs\ncan't go everywhere\nright and so i don't really have like a\nbunch of friends local that i could like\neven think of\nactivities to do with\nokay so like time alone feels less\nrewarding i guess\ni'm wondering if actually like not only\nwere social skills not modeled but\nrelaxation and recreation weren't\nmodeled\nwhat do you think probably i mean i\ndon't think my parents\never did that either like we never took\nvacations or anything because mostly\nbecause we didn't have the money to\nyeah but that's you know\nthat's probably created my lack of\ndesire for a vacation because i've never\nseen how like fun it is\nyou know i've never been exposed to the\nthrills of relaxing\nokay i'm gonna need a minute because\nthis is\nthings are coming together for me but\ni'm also there a lot of different\ndirections can i just think\nthat's fine okay so let's just think\nabout this\ntrying to sketch out a plan\nto transform your life oh\nbut really to transform your way\nokay sorry for the silence i know it\ndoesn't make for a very\nentertaining\ntwitch chat i just glanced over i made\nthe mistake of glancing at twitch and\nthey said get cats\ni already have dogs i'm good\nwhat kind of dogs do you have i have a\nborder collie and a caucasian shepherd\nwhat's a caucasian shepherd uh they\naren't very popular here they're like um\nrussian mountain dogs used for like\nguardian protection\nthey guard russian prisons big\nand ballpark i learned this i made this\nmistake on the first or second time i\never did a stream where i asked\na young woman where she's from and i\nrealized i'm not supposed to do that but\ni'm just curious\ngenerally what part of the country do\nyou live in\ni'm in texas i'm in texas too\noh i grew up in texas\nsame i think i lived in the same house\nuntil i moved out\nokay\nso i think some of this stuff is like\nspiritual\nsome of it is like a little bit more\npsychological and some of it is a little\nbit more physiological\nand i realize we haven't been talking\nvery long so\ngenerally speaking i try to tie things\ntogether for people at the end\nbut i think you've you've done such an\nawesome job of like sharing so much\nlike so much rich information that i'd\nlike to lay out a couple things and then\ni'm curious about\nhow we can help you or maybe explore\nwhatever sticks because some of it may\nnot stick any of it may not stick\ndoes that sound okay yeah\nso the first thing is like i get the\nsense kate that it's you\nor them right like you make a lot of\ndecisions\nevery day where it's like i have to do\nthis or like i get to choose one or the\nother\nand the crazy thing is that like that\nfundamentally needs to change\nit needs to be you and them and i think\nyou already actually suspect this in\nsome ways where you kind of say\nif i don't take care of myself i can't\nquite pop\non stream sometimes the way that i\nshowed or i need to\nand that like the quality of your\nstreams could actually go up\ntaking care of yourself and as someone\nwho works like in stress\nmanagement is my day job that is what i\nsee overwhelmingly\npeople tend to have this idea\nthat you know i don't have time for\nwellness so i'll leave you with a really\nfascinating i think quote from the dalai\nlama\nin the dalai lama said people should\nmeditate for half an hour a day\nif they don't have the time they should\nmeditate for\nhow long what do you think uh\n10 minutes beautiful no he said if you\ndon't have the time you should meditate\nfor an hour\nright do we need it more yeah\nand i know it sounds absolutely crazy\nbut like that's actually how it works\npeople who don't have time to meditate\nfor half an hour when they meditate for\nan\nhour everything gets better and they\nfind the time\nso when i teach like so i do some work\nwith like corporations and stuff and\nlike part of what i tell them is that\nyou can't tell people to take care of\nthemselves off of the clock\nso what i actually encourage like\ncompanies and hospitals to do\nis like bake meditating time into their\nday\nand pay him for it you'll see a return\non your investment\nit's crazy but what i tell people is\nwhen they call me in for like a\nmeditation training i say don't have me\ncome at 5 pm\nhave me come in the middle of the\nworkday and they don't have to stay\nlonger\nit's dedicated time to take care of\nyourself because that's actually part of\nyour job\nit's part of your job and so the first\nthing that has to change is that you've\ngot to start stop thinking in terms of\neither or\nand and then the question becomes okay\nhow the [ __ ] do we do that\nso that's one thing right so like\nyeah so we'll get to that so but i just\nwant you to notice\nthat your mind is programmed to think in\nterms of either ors\nit's like i have to do this or that and\ni just don't\naccept that logical premise\nso you're going to wake up and like you\nknow you're going to say like okay i\ncould do this but i don't feel like\ndoing this i don't i really don't want\nto do this\nand then your mind is going to\nautomatically go to like either i do\nthis or i do this but like just\ntry to take a step back and try to find\nan and somewhere in there\ncan you start stream a little bit later\nevery day can you stream for like less\nthan 15 hours\nyou know can you like like put some\nkinds of limits around it\ntake care of yourself and stream\nsecond thing is i think you've gotta\nunburden yourself\nand i know there's a lot of these\nquestions are going to be like how and\nso we'll get to that\nbut i mean i get the sense kate that you\ncarry around\na lot of weight which really does not\nneed to be on your shoulders\nand what i mean by that is like you have\nthis pressure to create this range like\ni don't know\nhow to explain this to you but like you\ncan't really do that\nright so like for the same reason that\nlike there's the random bloat stuff and\ni don't mean to bring up something\nnegative but my point is that\nthere's a certain amount of rng in real\nlife\nand for you to slave and sacrifice\nyourself\nfor like this thing is i just don't\nthink that that's\nfair or even reasonable can the ranch\nhappen absolutely should you devote\nyourself to it absolutely\nand at the same time there's a certain\namount of [ __ ] rng\nright so like i it sounds crazy to me\nthat like you're you're\ndoing all of this stuff but like take a\nstep back and recognize that\nyou know the ranch is going to happen if\nit's going to happen\nthe other thing is that like what you\nkind of mentioned this nightmare about a\nzombie dog\nwhat i'm actually envisioning is 10\nyears from now you succeed at the ranch\nand instead of like disney princess kate\nrunning it\nand it's gonna be like have you seen\nsnow white like the old one\nyeah so like you know how snow white\nruns around a lot of animals like\nsurrounding her that are singing and\ndancing and stuff like that\nthat's what i envision the ranch is what\nthe ranch should be\nand what i'm actually seeing is like\nzombie kate running\nthe ranch because that's what you're\ngonna turn into\nthe way that you're going and it's gonna\nbe like everything is like scary and\nlike you're like a zombie because you\nburnt out and\nand you're like i don't even know what\nburning out is that means you burnt out\nyou're already burnt out\nthis is this is burnout yeah that's what\ni was like wondering because everyone's\nlike\nalways sworns about a burnout i'm like i\nnever felt that coming does that mean\nthat it's by past that point\nyeah so let me give you a quick heads up\nif you don't know who you are as a\nperson you cry at random times\nand you feel like your soul is being\nsucked away by social media\nyou might be burnt out probably\nthose may be signs of burnout i don't\nknow what that sign of but burnout sure\nas hell\nlike kind of fits there right yeah so i\ni really do think it's worthwhile to\nkind of\ntake a step back and think about you\nknow in order for you to really\nmake the ranch what you want it to be\nwhat it needs is not like burden\nlike it's not like a sense of like\nsevere duty that's going to create the\nplace that i\nenvision when i hear you talk about it\nit's actually like\nlove and caring and what i'm hearing\nfrom you is that like\nthat person is slipping away from you\nwhich is why it's so [ __ ] terrifying\nyou're just not that person anymore it\ndoesn't feel like you are that person is\nstill in there\nwe gotta let her out we'll get to the\nhouse but i genuinely do think that\ntaking care of yourself\nis gonna help you be the person that has\nthat compassion to get\nif you look at studies of burnout the\nfirst thing to go\nwhen someone gets burnt out is empathy\nand compassion\nthat's what your mind and body and\nphysiology and neuroscience sacrifice\nso if you look at physicians who are\nburnt out the number one sign of burnout\nis a lack of empathy\npeople stop caring about their patients\nthey go there and they like do the work\nof saving their lives\nbut they stop caring when you you know\nwhen you're working with a patient who's\nbeen diagnosed with\ncancer and the family like wants to talk\nto you about things that are not medical\nthe compassionate physician sits down\nand has that conversation the burnt out\nphysician which doesn't mean that\nthey're an [ __ ]\nis like looking at their clock and\nthinking about okay where when can i get\nout of this room\nand like finish up my orders and check\nin with the nurses and do all my\ndocumentation so that i can go home\nat a reasonable hour like 8 30 at night\nand i've been here since 7 in the\nmorning\nand it's not the physician's fault it's\njust compassion goes first\nso i genuinely think that like you've\ngot to start taking care of yourself so\nthat you can be the compassionate person\nlike\nthat's why i think you're losing\nyourself because you can't\nyou can't be that person right i think\nin my case because i don't have other\npeople around me it's like that\nhas been towards myself compassion and\nempathy what do you mean\ntowards yourself like losing it losing\nit towards myself like my self-care and\nstuff\nyeah absolutely other people it's a very\nisolated job\nand and that we kind of see too because\ni i think like you know because i i get\nthe sense that i mean\nclearly you've told us that you actually\nlike don't take care of yourself\nright and and that for example you have\nsome potential medical problems that\nmay need to be reevaluated and stuff but\nyou can't find the time in the day\nright um so the last thing is that like\ni encourage you to i know this may sound\nbizarre and and maybe we can have a\nbrief conversation about like religion\nor spirituality but like\ni encourage you to think about taking\nwhat life has given you\nso like you're lucky and you're grateful\nwhich is awesome\nbut also like you know just because\nyou're lucky and great\ngrateful and you have this opportunity\ndoesn't mean that you have to sacrifice\nyourself\ni mean something about this just feels\nto me like you're not\ncounting on the forces whether they be\ntwitch at\nyour general charisma your rng or your\ncosmic duty\nare like they're supporting you and then\nyou don't have to do it all yourself\nlike i came onto this platform and i\ntried to do it all by myself and like it\ndoesn't work i can't do it\ni can't save the internet it's\nridiculous\nbut that's how we feel right like you\nfeel like you have to do it all yourself\nbut like\ndon't i mean i don't know how else to\nsay i mean as someone who has\nrecognized that i am very very well\nsupported by like thousands of people\nlike there are people who are in your\ncorner too\nyou don't have to grind out every sub to\nmake this ranch happen\nlike if the ranch really is going to\nhappen it can't be done just by you\nbecause you're talking about making it\nbig\nright yeah and so are you thinking about\npersonally bankrolling it\num part of it's going to be like\nfundraising i feel like through social\nmedia but\ni guess for me personally i want to make\nsure that i'm\nlike i have enough money saved up for\nlike emergencies or just general life\nthings for myself\nso that that way every um discretionary\nincome that i make can be\nspent towards the charity organization\naspect of it so yeah it's not my income\nanymore but instead it's like\nthrough the charity yeah so i i think\nthat like so just\nlike stop and think about that so that\nwhen you when you wake up on a\nparticular day and you're like hey i\nneed to start streaming right away or i\nneed to keep streaming like\ni don't know how those thoughts if those\nthoughts like factor in\nto your decision in the moment do they\ni guess at this point it's not really\nthinking about it it's more of just like\ningrained in me it's like i get up and i\ndo this\nand like i like i wouldn't know what\nelse to do with my day at this point\nwhere it's like as far as working\nproductively towards\nthe goal goes yeah so then i think we\nget to the next thing\nso i like your idea of a charity and\nstuff like this because\nas someone who also had a mission to\ncreate an organization and\npersonally bankroll it it's not\nsustainable\nyou're just going to tear yourself apart\ni was working a full-time job\nas a doctor and trying to start a\nhealthy gamer and it just doesn't work\num so the last thing\ni think is is kind of like more\npractical which is like okay so like\nwhat do we do about this stuff\nright and i think some of this stuff is\nactually like super super like nuts and\nbolts\nit sounds to me like you literally don't\nknow how to take care of yourself\nyeah a little bit and i i don't mean\nthat to be like\ndoes that sound condescending no okay i\njust have\nlike if i've never been taught in my\nhome life i also never like\ntried to do it as an adult then\nnaturally you just like don't know what\nto do\nyeah absolutely so you know here\nso so then we can talk about practically\nlike how do you take care of yourself\nand and some of this stuff also involves\nlike behavioral reinforcement because\non the one hand i'm feeling like this\nsense of like you know duty\nor to create this thing for animals and\nlike make the world a better place\nand on the other hand like even when you\ndon't like that\nat least the grind feels rewarding\nbecause you know you're moving towards\nthis like\nultimate goal yeah and then\nthe flip side is like if you don't\nstream for a day then you're just kind\nof twiddling your thumbs and like\ndoing laundry and like kind of hanging\nout around the house and you're like i\ndon't even know what the [ __ ] i'm doing\nwith my life\nyeah and so how can we help you\nget some kind of reinforcement through\ntaking care of yourself that you can\nstart to like learn and appreciate like\nthat's also an important practical thing\num so\nthoughts about what i've said so far\num yeah i mostly agree i think another\npart is just like\ni know that there are certain things\nthat help me clear my mind but it's also\nlike justifying them i guess\ngetting to a point where it's like oh\nthat would be great but then afterwards\nit's like look at all the time you\nwasted that you could have been\nstreaming with\nso if i like took time off to like maybe\ngo like horseback riding or something\nwhich is like\na meditative activity for me you know\nyou can clear your mind think be out in\nnature it's great but then it's like\nafterwards you're like\nand i just spent the whole morning not\nstreaming\nkind of like flip side guilt yeah so\nhow long have you been feeling that\nguilt\nprobably for maybe like three years or\nso\nso is this also like it sort of started\nwhen your dog passed away\nyeah okay\nso kate\nokay so there's so much to talk about so\nfirst of all i want to just kind of\ncheck in with you about how this\nconversation is going\ni'm noticing that a lot of times i have\nlike emotional conversations with people\nwhere there's a lot of like catharsis\nand like realizing what's really holding\nyou back kind of stuff\num are you hoping for something like\nthat is that what you want\ni guess that would be nice also just\nlike\nit's they feel like it's also just an\nimportant conversation to have about\nlike\nit's okay to feel this kind of way for\nscreamers you know where it's like the\ngrind makes you like\nlike you're going crazy i think that's\nlike normal to know that you're not\ncrazy\nyeah a lot\nthat is important um so can you tell me\nabout\nyou know what what about streaming makes\nyou feel like you're going crazy\num i guess like i i personally\ndo have 80d so it's like just like the\nchat in general doesn't\nwork well with my ability to retain\ninformation or to process it at all\nyou know okay like i think your\nconversation with misgive\nand he he also has the same issues that\ni felt like\nthere's like problems like focusing on\nlike conversations typically if i like\nif i'm looking at chat like right now i\nhave chat clothes because i get\ni get so distracted um i have difficulty\nlike taking in just like my environment\nthings happening around me i'll often be\nlike in my own head and i'll like\nsometimes just like bump into stuff at\nstores i just don't realize like\nanything's there\nand then like i'm super messy i also do\nthe thing of like leaving fridge doors\nopen\njars off lids when i was living with my\nroommate\nthey would often think that i got\nabducted\nbecause they would come home and like\ngroceries outside of the car because i\nwould be like making trips unloading the\ncar and i would just like get distracted\nand do something else and then the\ncabinet would be open the jar of peanut\nbutter\nwould be left like with the lid off and\nlike the milk cap\nwasn't screwed on but it was still put\nback in the fridge\nso it was like stuff like that where\nthey're like what happened here\nokay yeah it does seem like you got\nabducted everything's like half done\nright so it's sort of like\nsomeone just walked in and just snatched\nyou up yeah\nand and so that sounds like add really\ndoes\nyeah um yeah i mean that doesn't make\nyou crazy but you\nsaid something about social media and\nand streaming and how\nyou kind of feel crazy sometimes i\njuggle too many things\nright or like i try to which would be\nlike i guess\nokay if i was healthy but because i\ndon't get enough sleep because of the\npressures of social media having to\nconstantly make stuff get stuff done on\nall the platforms\ni feel like my mind can't handle it off\non a functional level\nlike because i i have three youtube\nchannels i have two\nin no three instagrams i have two\ntwitters and i stream full-time\nas well and and i also have to have\nphoto shoots during the week for\ninstagram\nand like it's why it's\nwhy do you have three instagrams because\ni have my personal one in case something\never happens to my main one\num and then i also have my dog's\ninstagram because i'm trying to grow\nthat towards like the animal stuff later\nin life and network with trainers and\nthings on that\nuh so yeah i have i'm very diverse and i\nfeel like\nmy 80d mentality thinks like i can\nhandle this i'm used to multitasking\nyeah but because i'm\ntaking care of myself i just feel like\ni'm actually going insane\nmore than i normally would be with all\nthe multitasking\nwhat is going insane what do you mean by\nthat like\nbringing fog a lot like i'll just like\nstop like i'll\ni can't remember what i was doing and\nstuff you know it's like different from\nlike process information like mid task\ni'll just be like totally blanking on\nlike what i was just doing\nokay so you're noticing like a cognitive\nimpact\nis yeah you say the word insane to\ndescribe it is like having a browser and\nyou keep opening new tabs to the point\nwhere it just no longer responds\nokay so i'm not hearing anything kind of\nemotional in terms of insanity what i'm\nhearing is like more\ncog like cognition so it's like like\nyou're kind of\nyou know your program crashes like\nmaking pv and j\ndot exe has crashed and it's just yeah\njust stop and then there's like peanut\nbutter and jelly jars\nin two different places yeah it's a lot\nof like different effects i guess\nbecause the emotional side feels like\nbecause i don't like cater to like my\nown self i don't i don't have like\nas much personality or know myself\nanymore you know but then there's also\nthe cognitive side where i feel like i'm\ndoing so much that like\nmy mind is actually stopping its\nperformance\nokay who did you used to be\ni guess just more like spontaneous and\nenergetic and fun like i still have like\na lot of energy but not like\nin my um emotional side it's weird it's\nlike i have physical energy\nbut i'm not like as bubbly or happy\non a daily basis if that makes sense\nit's weird it's like hard to explain\nbecause i guess english doesn't have\nthat many good words for it but it's\nlike\nemotional energy is a lot less\nwhat keeps you what what kind of keeps\nyou from being happy on a day-to-day\nbasis\ni just overloaded my system like like i\ndon't have enough free time to do\nthe things that i know would be helpful\nfor myself like to de-stress\nwhat like the like the like taking long\nwalks\ni guess with the dogs or like horseback\nriding things i'm just like there's not\nenough hours in the day to accomplish\nall the different aspects of my social\nmedia empire\nand also still take time for myself so\nit's like\ni know kind of like what would help but\nthen\nit would also be detrimental i feel to\nthe career side so it's like a lot of\nconflicting\nfeelings\ni also do not have a good sleep schedule\nwhich is like i know that it's bad\nbut i also feel like every time i try to\nlike\nfinish my tasks faster and go to sleep\nthere's just always more to do\nhow many hours yeah so you know\nyou know the problem with sleep\nschedules is that they're wonderful in\ntheory\nbut like practically like who the [ __ ]\nhas time for a sleep schedule\ndoes that make sense yeah so\nmy average is like four to five hours\nhow many\nhours a day do you work\num i guess technically every time i'm\nnot\nsleeping i'm working in some way because\nit's either like getting ready for\nstream you know like makeup and hair and\nall that or like i'm\nuh doing photo shoots\nfor my other platforms or i'm like\nanswering messages and emails so i guess\ni work constantly if i'm not sleeping\nwhich i guess in my case should be\nconsidered napping because it's really\nnot that restful\nthis is [ __ ] awful dude yeah\nwhat how do you feel when i say that\ntrue\nlike a big true\nwhat's what's true about it\nit's not healthy\ni mean that's true what else\nwhat's awful about it\ni don't know what else well it's hard to\nput in the words i guess like just the\nfeeling of being trapped again\ntrying to figure out how to dig further\nright and and you do yeah that's\nsomething i haven't really been able to\ndo\nlately what are you trapped by\ni guess the what i know it might be like\njust my psychological\nfeeling of what the job requires but\njust like having to be\nconstantly uploading content everywhere\njust to keep everything alive and\nworking together towards like\nconstant growth rather than loss i guess\nof\nnumbers and relevancy and monetary and\nall that stuff\nand it's not so much like an ego thing\nlike i don't really care about if it was\njust\nlike you know myself like i feel like i\nhave enough confidence as a person\nit's just like the the dream that i have\nit's like so intense that i feel like no\ni don't want it to slip away because\nit's like a very rare opportunity that\nmost people don't get\ni feel to actually like be in the\nposition where you can\nactually accomplish what you want\nso you feel lucky and it's almost i'm\nalmost getting the sense that you feel\nbeholden to the dream\nand the big dream because you can\nactually achieve it\nyeah it almost yeah it's like most\npeople just have dreams and they never\nget to even have a chance at achieving\nthem\nand so you would be an ungrateful little\n[ __ ] if you had the chance to achieve\nyour dream and you let it slip by\nbecause you wanted to sleep for five and\na half hours instead of five\nright so kate i'm gonna say something to\nyou it may sound kind of weird\ni think what you've done is you've\nmanaged to build an empire\nand empires i know this is going to\nsound like kind of a silly question it's\nnot a trick question\nso you know what requires more of your\nlife force\none youtube channel or three\ni'm actually not sure because i feel\nlike for me\nonce i'm in the mode of working you know\nlike it doesn't feel much different\nmaybe i'm just so used to it\nit's where like working a little bit i\nmight as well work a lot because if\nit feels like the same amount of energy\nfor each task you know\nyeah so that that sort of boggles my\nmind because the short answer is three\nyoutube channels take more energy than\none youtube channel\nand sometimes we you know i kind of talk\nabout\nthoughts and i think what you've managed\nto do kate is you built this\nempire and the bigger it grows the more\nof you it\ntakes right\nand like as you get closer and closer to\nsuccess\nyou get more and more like lost\nbecause like now there's three\ninstagrams and three youtubes and then\nlike not only do each of them require\ntheir own thing and two twitters\nplus streaming plus photo shoots\nand you could give it was fine to\nsacrifice yourself when there wasn't\nlike that much\nthe empire wasn't as big and hungry as\nit is now\nbut you fed it and it's grown\nand then it wants more and the only\nplace that you know\nlike where to feed it is from yourself\nand what i'm almost getting the sense of\nis that like you're getting consumed by\nit\nyeah i mean the first in the first five\nminutes you were talking about like\nlosing yourself in social media\nand now what i'm kind of getting a\npicture of is like you've like created\nthis monster\nand then the more you feed it the bigger\nit grows\nand the bigger it grows the hungrier it\ngets and the more food it needs\nright and then you're just getting keep\neverything growing\nyeah what do you think about that\nit just is what it is if you want to go\nthat route right it's like\ni don't really know how to keep it\ngrowing without like\ncutting without cutting back a\nsignificant amount and still like\ncatering to my happiness right it's like\nit's almost like i have to choose\nand the problem is i don't want to\nchoose i'm very indecisive like i want\nboth and as a result of that i feel like\nneither\nyep so there it is right i feel like i\nhave to choose\nno you don't have to there's there's\nyou're thinking that's the\nyou or them you feel like you have to\nchoose i don't think\nyou actually need to choose i know it\nsounds crazy\nbut i i think you can take care of\nyourself and\nthat the empire can i mean there may be\npractical things in terms of\ni don't know if you like work with other\npeople or like you have employees or you\nlike farmers helps with some stuff\nyeah so i mean there's always that kind\nof stuff but and ultimately if you want\nto grow i think that's the right you\nhave to go because you can't do it all\nyourself\nbut i think that this is this is the\ncrux of the problem and i think in your\ncase\ni have something that i really want to\ntell you but i think it's going to\nterrify\nlay it on me i've already terrified\nmyself a lot\ni think you've got to let go of your job\nand i'm not saying that you shouldn't\npursue it\nright but like you can't there's no such\nthing as like\nlong-term happiness that very idea\nis false this is like part of the gold\nat the end of the rainbow and i see this\ntime and time and time again like so\nlike my favorite examples are from\ninvestment banking\nso these are people who work really hard\nin college to get their dream job\nand then they get their dream job at a\nplace like goldman sachs\nand then they're like an analyst there\nwhich means that they're at the bottom\nof the totem pole\nand if they just keep grinding and keep\ngrinding things are going to get better\nand then they find themselves as\nassociates and they have more money and\nnow they can fly first class\nfor the 10 days that they get to\nthemselves every year\nright and then the other 355 they're\nworking and then they become\nvice presidents then they become\ndirectors and then they become managing\ndirectors\nand then they make 16 million dollars a\nyear and they've made it\nand they sacrifice so much they're 58\nyears old\nthey've been divorced three times\nand that's the end of the rainbow\nand then they look back at their life\nand they're like this\nis it this is what i did it for\nand they're filled with regret and\nloneliness and it's not what it was\nsupposed to be it's not what they\nthought it was\nit was a fantasy and then ultimately\nlike each step of the way in theory\nthings got better and they moved closer\nand closer to their goal\nand like are you moving closer and\ncloser to your goal\nuh i am and how does that feel\nit's like a light at the end of the\ntunnel right it's like oh i'm almost\nthere and then i can like\nfeel the peace and enjoy but then part\nof me is like what if i get there\nand i'm so [ __ ] up that i can't even\nfind that happiness i'm looking for yeah\nand i think the scary thing kate is i'm\nhearing that\nthe closer you get to your goal the\nworse that you feel\nand the worse that you feel the more you\nhold on to the fantasy\nbecause that'll make it okay\nand then like that's 22 yep\nand so i think kate you gotta start\nliving for today\nand if if the light at the end like i\nhave faith in you i think that\nyour passion and compassion and drive\nand dedication\nare not gonna disappear if you take a\nweek off\nlike you're not gonna magically\ntransform into a [ __ ] lazy [ __ ]\nyou know like if you take a week off i\nwant you to have faith in yourself that\nyou'll get there one day and you're not\ngonna do it on your own and killing\nyourself in the process is\ncertainly not gonna help and as your\nempire has grown and you've gotten\ncloser and closer to like success\nyou like fall more and more into the\ndark side\nright and then you like you reach all of\nyour ambitions and then you look back at\nyour life and it's like\nempty and filled with like ruin and\nthat's not\ngood yeah and i know it's really really\nscary but i think you've got to start\nletting go like i'm not saying don't try\nbut what i'm saying is like don't attach\nyourself to that\noutcome it's kind of like you're looking\nat the top of the mountain\nand you're kind of saying it's going to\nbe amazing when i get to the top it's\ngoing to be amazing when i get to the\ntop\nwhich which you should really be focused\non is like how am i going to take the\nnext step\nyou can't ever avoid taking the next\nstep\nand is that the right step or the wrong\nstep\nand what i'm hearing right now is that\nlike you've pulled a muscle\nand you're forcing yourself to continue\nto climb\nand like that's not the way to get to\nthe top of the mountain\nas someone who's tried to climb them out\nand pulled a muscle and kept going\ncrazy story then maybe i'll share it one\nday but\ndoes that make sense like i just don't\nlike i think you've got to take care of\nyourself in the here and now\nand like don't i mean i know it sounds\nweird to say don't worry but\njust have faith in yourself that you'll\nget to where you want to go\nyeah it makes sense it's just like i\nguess it's hard to\nlet go of the grind because of the way\nthat if i was on youtube i feel like\nit'd be easier because you can schedule\na bunch of videos and then take a week\noff and it's fine\nit's like you weren't didn't even\ndisappear just i think twitch is unique\nin the fact that like\nwhen you're not live people are\nconstantly being distracted\nwith other people who are alive and it's\nlike if you're gone for a week that's\nhow habits form and they just watch\nother people and so it feels like you're\nlosing\neverything that you've built and like\nit's just difficult to like\njustify time off because it's how it is\nespecially with like the way the\nsubsystem works like people are falling\noff every day\ni feel like it would be a little easier\nbut twitch would probably never fix this\nif they had like\na certain day like the first of the\nmonth where subs were charged then you\ncan like schedule your time off\nbut that's just not how it is so it's\nreally hard to like justify that\nyeah so i i don't know that you should\ntake a week off but what i'm thinking\nabout is like it starts small\nright so you've built up this empire by\nfeeding the beast\none bite at a time and then two bites\nand then three bites and four bites\nand i think your road to balance is the\nsame way\nso i think it's not so much about don't\nbecause like you say that the\npile of tasks you have to do is endless\nright\nthere's always something else to do so\nat the end of the day\nyou know you have a hundred tasks and\nyou can do 40 of them\non a given day like what's the\ndifference between 38 and 40.\nso what i would encourage you to do is\nset aside some amount of your day\nto take care of yourself every day\ndon't think about it as doing less work\nbecause you actually may not even do\nless work it's just carve out the time\nfor like\none hour a day to like do something for\nyourself\nwhat do you think about that\nyep it's definitely more i guess um\nreasonable of an approach\nto me\nthe discipline and actually following\nthrough with that yeah\nyeah so so dis discipline is like i\nthink discipline is not the right word\ndiscipline is not what you need what you\nneed is practice right so this is\neveryone's like oh i'm lazy it's going\nto be hard\ni guarantee you it's going to be hard\nit's not you're not it's not discipline\ndiscipline is not actually the answer at\nall you don't need to be disciplined\nyou're never going to be disciplined\nyou're always going to be a creature\nthat is like pulled by your impulses\nthat's what people with add are and i\nthink that's actually okay\nlike 80d is a problem because you leave\npeanut butter or jars open but it also\nallows you to thrive\nin a social media environment because\nyou can manage\neight social media accounts plus a\ntwitch stream\nyeah people without add can't do that\n[ __ ]\nlike your mind is actually designed to\nthrive in this sort of environment\nand you need to practice doing something\nelse\nand so i don't know if it's like\nhorseback riding like do you do\nscheduling or no do you do schedules\nno not really or just like when\ni feel like i can't handle anymore i'll\njust like do something and then but then\ni'll\nduring it it's like i'll feel great and\nthen afterwards it's like oh no\nit's so much type of thing it's like\nit's it clears my mind in the moment and\nthen after you feel like\nthe guilt yeah so let's talk about that\nfor a second\nokay so just because you have\nokay this is going to sound like a\nstupid question so sorry if it confuses\nyou because it's so\nstupid but our thoughts facts\nno okay so like you're gonna go\nhorseback riding\nand then you're gonna feel guilty right\nand then that guilt is going to generate\nthoughts\ndoes that make sense yeah so you're\ngonna say like oh i wasted so much time\nbut those are just they're just [ __ ]\nthoughts they're like\npatterns they're like conditioning it\ndoesn't actually mean\nthat's true like sure you spent an hour\nhorseback riding and you could have done\nsome things during that hour but even if\nyou had done things during that hour you\nstill would not ever be doing enough\nright it's kind of like let's say that\ni'm trying to empty the ocean with a\nteaspoon\nand then i spend an hour horseback\nriding instead of emptying the ocean\nand then i come back and it's like oh my\ngod i could have emptied 30 teaspoons\nout of the ocean\nand it's like yeah that's technically\ntrue but who the [ __ ] actually cares\nit's not gonna make a difference\nyeah it's true and what i want you to do\nso this is like very important for like\npeople who are watching too is that\ndo something to take care of yourself\nbut don't do it to take care of yourself\ndo it as an experiment so go horseback\nriding today's friday\ndo you stream over the weekend yeah\ncan you go horseback riding over the\nweekend\nlike i imagine it's safer in terms of\ncovet stuff right\nbecause texas is crazy right now so your\nyour homework is to go horseback riding\nand more importantly you're gonna go\nhorseback riding and then what you're\ngonna do is pay attention\nwatch and see when the feelings of guilt\narise\nand like just let them arise and they're\ngonna have those thoughts and like\nyou kind of like you know it's sort of\nlike when you're training a dog like the\ndog sometimes barks\nand if you kind of like give into it\nit's gonna like agitate more\nbut if you kind of just behave with\ntranquility then you kind of like\nit'll calm down and see what happens\nwith how long the guilty thoughts last\nif you don't feed into them\nyou don't disagree with them kind of say\nyeah you're right i could have\ni could have done more but i chose not\nto\ni'm going to feel guilty so be it what\ndo you think about that\ni think that it's it's probably likely\ni'll soon forget with my way of thinking\nof like\nif i don't focus on it i'll move on to\nsomething else in my mind\nokay so this is also so good\ni was getting the sense that something\nabout that wasn't sitting well with you\num and and so then the question becomes\nso then like how but so so what are you\ngonna do about that kate like this is\njust because you forget about things\nlike you can't\nin my mind you have to figure out some\nway to and i can help you\nbut um you know just because your mind\nis likely to forget\ndoesn't mean that you can't you can't\ngive up practicing because you're likely\nto forget\nit's sort of like you have to do with\nthis in spite of that does that make\nsense or am i losing you yeah\nyeah it makes sense so i mean that's\nalso where i'd say like you're streaming\nright now\nright and how long are you streaming\ntoday\ni don't really know typically it goes\nuntil i'm like okay i have things to do\nand i don't have like a set schedule for\nmy end time typically just for my start\ntimes\nokay can you go tomorrow horseback\nriding\nno not tomorrow why not\num because i already had stuff\nplanned for tomorrow's stream i wanted\nto do like cooking and like a dog walk\nand stuff\nthat's i plan out my streams weekly so\nthat's why it's like all so hard i have\nto like kind of like schedule\ni guess the time off hold on hold on i'm\nconfused\ni thought you didn't do well with\nschedules not for my own time\nmy free time okay so now we get to a\nreally important point\nthis has to be part of your job it's not\nfree time\nyeah you remember when i was telling you\nlike when i go to a corporation i'm like\nyeah\nyou guys are going to have me teach\nmeditation can't be at 5 p.m when\neveryone's ready to go home\nhas to be during work hours you need to\nreduce the amount that you work\nnot squeeze this in as extra kate this\nmust change this is part of your job\nbecause zombie kate is not gonna get as\nmany subs\nas fun kate living cape let's call her\nliving gate and zombie cake\nyeah right so this has to be part of\nyour job\nand where's the rebellion go ahead rebel\ni'm i don't have any right now really\nreally\nso when do you make your schedule for\nthe week\nuh sunday night okay so do you have can\nyou do it can you go horseback riding on\nsunday\nno i have a podcast okay i have to\nschedule it for some time next week\nokay so schedule it as part of your day\nand if you need to to feed the social\nmedia beast take a lot of selfies\nhow does that feel it's it's not so much\nlike a\na selfie type thing it's more just like\nthe stream okay\neven better than no selfies that sounds\nfar healthier to me\nbut you gotta schedule time for yourself\nmy dude\nlike it's the only way this is gonna\nwork because you're just getting lost\nhate is getting consumed by amram\nyeah and you've got to like help her out\nlike she needs your help\nshe's like it's almost if you want to\nget super like freudian and\npsychoanalytical\nyou were you were sacri you were leaving\nkate\nalone at home while amaranth goes to\nwork\nfor 16 18 20 hours a day\nand you're doing exactly to yourself\nwhat your parents did to you\nwhich is not abusive it's just\nyou always come last because there are\nmore important necessities\nyeah makes sense\nemotions\nuh i don't know it's hard for me to like\nfeel emotions lately like as far as like\nexpressing them like i feel them but i\ndon't know how to describe them\nyeah what do you feel that you don't\nworry about describe tell me what you\nphysically feel\n[Music]\ni feel like tension i guess still in my\nbody\ni but i also don't sleep so i'm not\nseeing that part of me is wondering like\nhow much of it is because i don't\nphysically take care of myself\nversus like the actual job itself\nboth it's not either or there's your\neither or thinking again\nis it because i don't take care of my\nphysical self or because of the job\nboth right\nand i can tell that you've got some\nemotion i think maybe what i said was\nmaybe a little bit more\nhurtful or gained traction than i\nintended no no it wasn't hurtful it's\njust my that's just\nhow my body copes with i guess physical\nstress too is like\nemotional crying and stuff no that\ndoesn't make sense to me so because what\ntriggered\nyour response is something that was\nemotional in origin\nyour body copes so it's a cycle like i\nsaid something and then that triggered\nan emotional response\ndoes that make sense maybe just like\npart of it could be also like knowing\nthat i have to change and also being\nlike\nscared to actually do it yep that i can\nget behind\nwhat are you scared of\ni don't really know i guess failing\nyeah see you're doing a good job\nso now we know there's fear right that's\nwhat you're feeling\nthere's tension but there's also fear\nyeah i guess like there's so many like\ndifferent aspects of like\nthe way the physical and emotional and\nlike ambition and stuff that it just\nkind of like is very confusing to\nprocess\nyeah i completely agree so i think you\nhave a lot\nof emotions that you've stuck in your\nbasement\nor attic because we're in texas and we\ndon't have basements\nyeah and i think the problem is like\njust like cleaning out your attic or\ngarage\nwhen you go in there and you've stuffed\na lot of stuff in there it can feel\nreally really overwhelming and there's\nfear and there's ambition there's hope\nthere's responsibility there's duty\nthe coping mechanism is to just like\nsuppress all of it and just keep like\nburying yourself into work yep\nvery insightful\nright and that's not going to work on\ni didn't mean to be sound condescending\nbut sorry no\nfine i say that to males that i work\nwith too\ni say dude and hun kind of\ninterchangeably i try to be gender equal\ni have so i will call women dudes and i\nwill call men\nhun yeah and therefore i offend everyone\nequally\ndo you mind if i ask how old are you 26.\nyeah and are there people that can\nlike do you have support in your life\num i guess like my parents are generally\nsupportive you know\nbut like i guess i don't really talk to\nmany people so it's like yeah and no\nlike in theory supportive but like not\nlike on a daily basis\ndo you share your struggles with anyone\nnot really what does that feel like i\ncan't talk back so huh my dogs can't\ntalk back\nso yeah um i don't know\ni guess you'd kind of not tend not to\nthink about it when you don't practice\ndoing it right if you just suppress\neverything and\njust keep working and you don't have\ntime to think about it you don't realize\nhow much it's like\n[ __ ] up up there yeah\ni want you to take a deep breath\ngood slow exhalation\nit's hard for me to like physically deep\nbreathe deeply which i think contributes\na lot to anxiety\nwhat makes it hard for you to physically\ndeep breathe deeply\nlike my nose doesn't inhale air very\nmuch and when i do it through my mouth\nit feels like i can't get it quite to my\ndiaphragm like it's very drying\nokay\nokay so what i want you to do is slow\ndown your exhalation\nso\nreally slow slower okay\nslower tiny tiny tiny tiny\nhuh it feels like i'm running out of air\nto exhale\ngood it feels like you're running out of\nair to exhale or do you feel hungry for\nair at the end of your exhalation\nboth like i feel like it needs to be\nlonger and that i need more immediately\nso it sounds like taking deep breaths is\nactually somewhat uncomfortable for you\nyeah interesting\ni think it's because like with my nose\nit's like it wasn't as bad when i was a\nkid so my whole life\ni've been used to nose breathing i've\nnever developed like the mouth breathing\nexcept like i guess maybe when i'm\nasleep and don't realize it\nbut like as i get older i feel like it's\nbecoming more of an issue so it's like\ni'm having to shift it and it's\nuncomfortable too because i've built it\nup the other way\ncan you do me a favor can you pinch the\ntip of your nose like this and then\nbreathe\nit's like a little better i've noticed\nthat too when i like shift my nostrils a\ncertain way i can get more air through\nit\njust pinch and take a deep breath\ni just realized how ridiculous we look i\nknow\ncan you notice a difference though yeah\nit's a little easier\nokay interesting yeah\nso kate you know i think of all of the\nconversations i've ever had on stream\nthis feels to me to be the most\nincomplete what do you think about that\nwhat do you mean by incomplete i feel\nlike we have a lot more left to talk\nabout\nwhat do you think yeah probably\ni would say so just like i guess because\ni'm a unique case most people don't like\ndo this type of like constantly for\nyears yeah\nwhat comes up when you say that\nexhaustion a little bit and like sadness\nfor myself\nyou sound really tired to me\ni joke with chad i'm always tired\nthey're like how do you keep having\nenergy\nwhen aren't you tired by now i'm like no\ni'm always tired\nyou know it's like the hulk thing he's\nalways mad\nwhat's it like to be tired all the time\njust overwhelming to my system like i\ndon't even know why i'm crying it's not\nthat i'm sad it's just like my system is\nphysically overwhelmed\ni think you've gotten so good at\nsuppressing that your body is like hey\nwe have a bunch of emotions\nand then your mind is like uh-uh and\nthen your body's like okay we gotta put\nthem somewhere and they come\nout through your body yeah probably\ni've been like this too since i was a\nkid like you know this is like if my mom\nwas like\nyelling at me to clean my room or\nsomething like just any kind of\nconfrontation and it might be because my\nbreathing problem just induces more\nanxiety i'm not quite sure\nlike just like mundane parental\nconversations i would just start crying\nand it's not like a sad thing she's not\nlike insulting me it's just like any\ntype of like confrontation where i'm\nlike\nhaving to do something i didn't like\nnaturally want to do because i'm like a\nmessy kid it's just like constant\ncrying yeah\nkate have you thought about working with\na therapist or do you work with a\ntherapist\nno i thought about it i haven't done it\nyet\nwhat's gotten oh i can probably answer\nthis but what's\nwhat's kept you from here\nif i've been paying attention i should\nknow the answer already but\nlet's do give you the benefit of asking\nyou what's gotten in the way\ni'm just working so much i guess the\ntime yeah\nso i think you gotta really seriously\nconsider it and i think a couple hours\nthroughout the week like three or four\nhours throughout the week i'd say\nideally every day\nyou got a schedule as part of your job\nsomething to take care of yourself\nyeah because you owe that to kate\nyeah absolutely it's really weird\nbecause i think people whenever you cry\nperceive like you're really sad and i'm\nlike\ni'm not even sad i'm just like\nphysically overwhelmed\ni feel like i'm not like emotional about\na certain thing at the moment\nyou know like all things considered i\nhave a pretty like\ngood outlook on life you know i'm like\nyeah i'm really lucky to be here i have\nall my\nstuff in order and stuff i know i don't\ntake care of myself but i'm not like\nemotionally torn up about anything at\nthe moment it's just like my body\nexpresses being overwhelmed with crying\nyep\nso i and it's my belief okay that\nyou do have part of that that over\nphysical feeling of overwhelmed\nis probably like emotion that as you\nkind of have hinted that is suppressed\nright because when like how does it feel\nto be tired you said tired and\nsad there's some guilt there's some fear\ni imagine there's a lot of a thing it's\nmore of like\ni guess it's like a different type of\nsadness it's not like you know like oh\nno everything is terrible it's more of\nlike oh\nit sucks that like i'm losing myself\nkind of like\nsorrow for like my personality i guess\nyeah it\nthat is very sad right\njust listening to that person it's just\nlike a sad thing\nit's it's hard to put into words yeah so\nit's almost as if you're like not\nconnected to that person it's almost\nlike it almost sounds like dissociative\nto me\na little bit you know like you're like\noh it's like it's sad that that's\nhappening to kate\noh well back to editing youtube videos\nexactly\nright and and that's that's that's the\ncrux of what we're talking about today\nis like you've\nyou've lost touch with yourself\nand i think part of what keeps you from\nre-engaging\nis because like if you re-engage you\nmentioned fear\ni think part of what you could be afraid\nof is like\nthe torrent of stuff that's gonna come\nif you engage\nif you reconnect with kate amaranth is\nafraid of getting bowled over\nyeah and if you fall apart as amaranth\nthen everything you've worked for\ngets blown away\nand so why would you risk connecting\nwith kate\ni'm sorry i don't have more for you oh\nno it's fine\ni i not really i don't have expectations\ni just feel like it's good i'm sure\nthere's like a lot of people who\nmake content who like feel similarly\nlike the grind is like\ntaking away part of what made them them\nbefore the social media\ngrind began and they just don't know how\nto talk about it or two to talk to or if\nthey even can because they sound like\nungrateful little [ __ ] and\nyep i was gonna you know i've been\nwaiting for an opportunity to ask if you\nsound if you feel that way\ndo you feel like an ungrateful little\n[ __ ] i mean i don't\ni don't feel like i am i'm just afraid\nof like if you\ntalk about this a lot are you perceived\nthat way right it's like if you're like\nman\nit's so like it's so uh i guess\nexhausting to be able to do what you\nwant for a living day in and day out\nwith no one to tell you otherwise and\nget to make a lot of money doing that\nyeah it must be\nmust be really terrible you little [ __ ]\ntype of thing\nit's like people it's a reaction to it\nlike oh yeah\ntry shoveling [ __ ] in the street for 12\nhours see if you prefer that you\nungrateful [ __ ]\nso i feel like people would be\nyeah the internet the internet loves it\nwhen content creators\ndon't get to be human yeah they hate\ntreating you like humans\ngo like there's a lot of gatekeeping\naround suffering too\nyou know we say like oh you're not\nallowed to suffer\nbecause you have it better than other\npeople which is just not true\nunfortunately if only it were true\nany kind of apologies if this has been a\nlittle bit of meandering on my end but\nlike any kind of takeaways or anything\nthat you felt was helpful from today's\nconversation\num just reconfirming that my feelings\naren't\nungrateful and crazy and that it would\nbe understandable to feel that way\nyeah i think very much so\ni think not only is that understandable\ni think you deserve to feel that way and\ni think you should feel that way and i\nthink it's okay to feel that way\nyeah and i don't think that anything\nthat you\ndo invalidates any of the things that\nyou feel\ni don't think that your gratitude your\nluck your empire or anything\nobs like takes away the right for you to\nfeel the way that you do\nand i do think you're gonna need courage\nand\npractice not discipline don't need\n[ __ ] discipline\ndiscipline isn't for people like us\nyou don't need it because i have not a\ngood amount of that\nyep right and i'm sure people watching\nwould be very confused because what they\nsee is someone who works like 16 to 18\nhours a day\nright 20 hours a day they're like how is\nthis person not disciplined\nit's not disgusting i don't know how to\ntake time off\nyeah it's like robot hyper focus yep\nand so some people robot hyper focus on\nvideo games you robot hyper focus on\nstreaming\nand people are envious of\npeople who happen to hyper focus on\nthings that lead to\nmonetary success which is fair but at\nthe end of the day i feel like you're\njust as out of control as someone who's\nlike addicted to video games and playing\nat home because you're not in control\nyou're consumed you're on autopilot\nso yeah and\nyou know kate like i said i'm i'm sorry\nthat i feel like there's still a lot to\ncover in terms of like practically\ni think i'm gonna make a note based on\nour conversation\ntoday about like if you're completely\nstuck on autopilot and living a life\nwhether it be a grind or video games\nlike practically how do you get started\nand the first thing\nso i think i'm gonna think about this\nand try to maybe make like a\nvideo or something but the first thing\nthat i would encourage you to do\nis to make set aside sometime in your\nday schedule\ntime for yourself is part of your job\nokay you know and and like even if it's\nlike\nand even like 30 30-minute meal time is\nlike not a bad idea we haven't talked at\nall about food but i don't know if you\neat and take care of it i don't\ni only eat on the stream because i never\ni moved into this house maybe like\na year and a half ago almost two years\nnow maybe and i never bought\na table and chairs because i'm always\nworking so i eat at my desk\nwhen i'm working\nokay any questions for me\num not really i guess if uh\nyou want to have like an another talk if\nsince you feel it's incomplete i'm\nalways open\nyeah how do you feel about that\ni think it would be good be a fun fun\nendeavor for me too\nlike i like talking about it even if i\ncry through some of it it's still like\nenjoyable for me to discuss things like\nthat\ni find them insightful good for a lot of\npeople who\ndon't have that avenue to talk about it\nso\ni i think that that could be really\nuseful okay\ni think the the because what i felt from\nour conversation today is that there's a\nlot of like really practical stuff\nthere's sort of like some emotional\nstuff like i would have loved to dig in\nand get to a particular emotion\nbut oddly enough i don't think that like\ndiscovering a particular emotion\nis the most important thing for you i\nthink the most important thing for you\nis for you to like literally schedule\ntime to take care of yourself throughout\nthe day\nyeah and and like i know it sounds small\nbut like the cool thing is that you've\nbuilt this\nmonster and you can build a different\none\nthe one where you take care of yourself\nand i do think you can find balance in\nyour case\nkate it's all about a lack of balance\nyeah\nand generally speaking when people are\nunbalanced i don't think they're as\nsuccessful\nyeah do you want to learn how to\nmeditate today\nsure so i'm a little bit reluctant to\nteach you a breathing meditation\ni mean i can always try yeah but that's\nokay we don't have to teach you a\nbreathing meditation\nso i actually what i'm going to teach\nyou is something also a little bit more\npractical so i want you to sit up\nstraight so you said you have a lot of\ntension in your neck\nyeah what i want you to do is tuck your\nchin\ntowards your throat yeah like that so\nyou\nfeel like you're kind of the back of\nyour head is kind of stiffening up\ndoes that make sense like tuck your chin\ntowards like\nyou know where your atoms would be and\nnow i want you to\nhold that spot hold that tightness like\nin terms of\nyou know you're not you're kind of yeah\nlike kind of like looking down\nalmost and then i want you to turn your\nhead to the side this could be hard with\nheadphones\nbut keep it tucked up and tell me what\nyou feel\n[Music]\nnot um an incredible amount of soreness\njust because i do exercises a lot for\nthis\ni just i still like feel it when i'm\nlike supposed to be like in a resting\nposition i like feel my body being held\ntense but it's not actually sore\nyeah i understand so so and then come\nback to the middle\nokay so and then go to the other side so\nkeep your chin tucked and then turn\nand then you should feel something along\nlike either here\nor on the back side do you feel that\nyeah probably the back side\nand then come back to the middle\nand then this way\nand then back to the middle then go\nahead and close your eyes\nokay and now we're going to go to the\nother side\nand just focus on that sensation\nof the tightness yep\nand then back to the middle\nand then over to your left right\nand notice that as you tuck your chin in\na little bit more\nyou may feel an increased sense of\ntightness\nkeep that chin nice and tucked\nand now back to the middle\nand then over to the other side\nnow as we're doing this your mind may\nstart to wander\nespecially as we go through subsequent\nrounds\nso just notice those thoughts\nnow back to the middle and let yourself\nflew back in so now just go ahead and\nrelax for a second let your\nchin relax eyes closed\nand now feel your body\ni still feel the tension a little bit on\nlike the back\non both sides okay so just go ahead and\nlet your shoulders hang down\nlike imagine like your arms are actually\nsleeves\non a piece of clothing hanging on a\nhanger\nso don't hold them up just let them hang\ngood\nnow what i want you to do is take a deep\nbreath in\nand push out your diaphragm\nand then out good you can use nose or\nmouth whichever you prefer\ndeep breath in\nand out\nand again\nnow i want you to sit with the person\nthat you are\ntry to figure out who is this\nwho are you right now is this kate\nthis is amaranth\nis this the future starter of your\nanimal rescue sanctuary\nis this a girl from texas\njust be with whoever you are\nlet your palms be face up\nfeel the warmth in your hands\ntry to stay nice and straight with your\nspine but let the rest of you relax\nnow we're going to take a deep breath in\nand we're going to raise our shoulders\nduring the breath\nspike up your shoulders and then as you\nexhale let them come down a second time\ndeep breath in\nand then out and relax\nand then third time\nand out\nnow in the space afterwards\ngo ahead and notice what thoughts may\ncome\nand i'll try to trigger some think about\nall the work that you could be doing\nall the things that you can\nand invite those thoughts to come invite\nthe beast\nof duty responsibility of being\ntrapped of having a mission\ntrying to make the world a better place\nall of those big thoughts with a capital\nb and a capital t\nall of those things that are more\nimportant than kate\nall of those things can be there but\nthey just just exist in your head\nthat you are actually more than those\nthoughts\nwhatever your goals are whatever your\naspirations are\nwhatever you strive to be\nthat all of those are just located in a\ntiny tiny\npart of you that there's so much\nmore to you than those things\nand now we'll do the last phase of our\nexercise today\nand that's going to be what i want you\nto do is open your eyes for a second and\nlook at me\nso keep your arms by your sides let them\nhang down\nand then as we breathe in what we're\ngoing to do is actually i'm going to put\nmy arms up\nand then touch them up top like a\nnamaste\nand then as you exhale\nlet them come out good\nand then again breathe in\nand then out\nnow close your eyes we're going to do\nthree more\nand try to match the arms with your\ninhalations as they come up\nas you fill up air your fingers should\ntouch and as you exhale\nas your breath finishes your hands are\nby your sides\ntwo more deep breath in\nand then out\nthen last one\nand now we'll sit in silence for a few\nminutes\nadd 60 seconds\nwhen you're ready go ahead and open your\neyes\nit's bright yeah\nworld is a different place\nso kate one last thing that i'll leave\nyou with\nreality isn't what you think it is all\nthat [ __ ] is just thoughts\ni don't know if that makes sense to you\nbut like this is really what you are\nand i think you should work hard every\nday but\nnothing i mean this this goal that you\nhave is the light at the end of the\ntunnel and it's not worth sacrificing\ntoday for\nbecause the scary thing is sometimes the\nlight at the end of the tunnel is\nactually another train\nyeah uh what was that practice like for\nyou\ni guess less tints\na little more like relieving of the\ntension\ngood what was your mind doing\nnot really anything great that's the\npoint\nthat's why we meditate to give yourself\na break from your mind\nbecause your mind does a lot to you it\ndoes a lot for you\nso take a break from it from time to\ntime\nyeah for me i have even though i have\nadd\nsince i have breathing problems if i\nhave to concentrate on breathing that's\nthe only thing i can do\nbecause it's so difficult to actually\nbreathe so it kind of counteracts\nthe issue sounds uncomfortable to have\nbreathing problems\nyeah yeah cool well any\nlast questions for me before we wrap up\nfor the day\nuh no i think that's pretty good here\num do you mind if we follow up with you\nabout whether you went horseback riding\nnext week\nsure would that keep you more\naccountable\nprobably should we should we do it or\nshould we ask your viewers to do it\num maybe both\nokay schedule they can include it\nyeah because i schedule weekly so\na lot of what you stream is for them\nright and so let them help you out too\nyeah and maybe your viewers can do\nsomething for themselves during the same\nhour that\nyou know stalkers and stuff aside i\ndon't know how much information you can\nfreely give out but\nif you're planning on doing something to\ntake care of yourself i think it'd be\nreally awesome if your community could\ndo the same thing\nand then you guys could like meet and\nkind of check in with each other about\ndoing it yeah that'd be nice\ncool thank you very much for coming on\nand i hope we were able to help in some\nsmall way\nyeah definitely it's good to know that\ni'm not crazy yet\njust close but not there yet we're good\nno i think you're the very opposite of\ncrazy i think you're\na normal wonderful person who has had\nlife social media and streaming get to\nthem because that's what it does\nand i think underneath i hope you'll be\nable to find some kind of balance\nbetween kate and amaranth\ninstead of leaving her at home yep\njust gotta work on it it has to be\nsomething that i do proactively because\nit's not going to happen if i just keep\nbeing like at some point sure damn\nstraight\nwise words okay wise words and something\nthat i think everyone can take home\ntaking care of yourself is not something\nthat happens on autopilot it's something\nthat you do\nso good luck with that thank you i\nreally appreciate it\ntake care you too\nyou"
