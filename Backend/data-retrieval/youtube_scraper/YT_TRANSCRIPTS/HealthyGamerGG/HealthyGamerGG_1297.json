    "transcript": "i don't know if you guys have have\nnoticed but\num i make less i make fewer boomer\nmistakes now\ni'm proud of you yeah wait hold on i\ncan't\noh i i can't see myself i was just about\nto\nmake another mistake um so welcome\neveryone\nthank you thank you so i think maybe\nwhat we can do\nis um so i understand we're going to be\ntalking about setting boundaries\nand potentially the friend zone is that\nright\nyeah yes okay and i noticed that there\nwas a pretty lively discussion ahead of\ntime but i\ni wasn't i haven't read it yet\num just a couple of things so what we'll\ndo is we'll start with introductions\nand uh we'll also kind of do like a\nsound check at the same time and and\nmaybe we'll have to adjust a couple of\nthings\num and then yeah we'll kind of see where\nthings take us\njust a quick disclaimer i tend to say\nyou guys which i don't\nmean to offend anyone um so i sort of\nuse it in the gender-neutral way which\nmaybe is part of the problem but\nuh so forgiveness i'll do my best to\navoid using that\noftentimes i'll just say y'all which i\nthink is way better\num but you know i don't mean to offend\nanyone\nso let's go ahead and let's get started\nwith introductions so why don't we start\nwith\num intuitive cutie\nhi my name is alyssa i'm 23 years old\nand i'm from\ncalifornia and i'm really excited to be\nhere\nbecause i've never talked about setting\nboundaries with a group of ladies before\nso awesome and i'm sorry what was your\nname\nalyssa alyssa okay yes welcome melissa\nthanks for coming on\nthank you for having me um\nlinda you want to go next well hi\nuh yeah i'm linda that's pretty much it\nokay welcome linda\num math of the valley\nyeah hi my name is math uh i'm a student\nand i'm 19 years old and i can\ncome here with more of a perspective of\nuh someone who hasn't had many things\nhappen to her\nbut the few experiences i've had are bad\nenough that i want to speak about it\nand i also want to speak as a few like i\nwant to speak stories that my friends\nwent through as well\nokay wow that's yeah i don't know if\nthat's like\nfortunate or unfortunate that on one\nhand\nyou know you haven't dealt with it a\nwhole lot but it sounds like when you\nhave had to deal with it it's been\npretty bad\nsorry to hear that thanks for coming\nthank you um and risaka\nyeah my name is risa i am 24 years old\ni'm currently working as a content\nmanager\nin the team fight tactics esports scene\nand yeah i'm really looking forward to\nthis conversation all the ladies here\nhas been\nextremely supportive and wonderful and i\nthink that this is a great conversation\nfor everyone to\nkind of have more insights about okay\ngreat yeah so we're i think we're really\nhere to learn and we'd really\nlove to have your perspective i think\nyou know most of our community\nis men although that's changing rapidly\nso i think when we started streaming it\nwas like\n95 to 90 percent men and and five to ten\npercent women and i think it's like\ncloser to 70 30 now\num and so i you know hopefully we can\nlearn a lot thanks for coming on risa\nthank you uh star sleeps\nyeah you can just call me star um i'm 22\ni'm an artist here on twitch but i'm\nalso a student studying engineering so\ni've had some stories in both of those\ncategories that we can get into\noh unfortunately real life stories and\nthe internet stories yeah\nokay that also i don't know i mean that\nsounds actually unfortunate because it\nsounds like there's nowhere to escape to\nnative style stay in bed i guess\num champaloo yes um you can call me\nchamp\nokay um i am 23 years old i live in\nswitzerland that's in europe\num i'm working in the banking industry\nand\ni'm a business admin student um\ni have also experiences in real life and\nonline and i think this is a really\nrelevant\num like thing to know like about setting\nboundaries\num yeah and i'm just i just want to\nspread that aoe healing\nfor all of you guys thank you so much i\nhope we can learn from that\nyeah so let me ask y'all um you know\njust to start off so first of all thank\nyou all for coming\nuh i was i'm trying to debate a little\nbit\nabout how do we want to approach this\ndiscussion so\nyou know champ said this is an important\nthing to talk about\nand i'm wondering whether we should\nstart by defining\nwhat is this or if we just want to jump\nright into like an actual experience\nwhat do you guys think would be like\nbetter to do first definition\ndoesn't it yeah okay um\ni didn't even know what boundaries were\nwhat does that mean so remember that\nlike you know there's a group of people\nwho are watching and maybe\nyou know hundreds of thousands more will\nwatch on youtube one day\nand i i don't know um i know there's a\nsort of a presumption that we're going\nto be talking about\nfemale male boundaries but\nyou know this could apply beyond that\nthere are certainly women who\ndon't respect boundaries in terms of um\ntheir relationships with men\num and also i think we're going to sort\nof take a default heteronormative\napproach which we don't necessarily have\nto but in my experience\nyou know boundaries it doesn't matter\nwhether you're heterosexual homosexual\nor something in between\nboundaries or boundaries doesn't matter\nwhat gender you are um\nand so yeah it sounded like star you\nwanted to say something\noh no i would i said i waved because you\nsaid potentially hundreds of thousands\num so yeah so what is this how do we\ndefine what are we talking about today\num yeah go ahead\ntoday we're talking about boundaries so\nboundaries can affect in a lot of\ndifferent parts of the life\nso with your partners you have to talk\nabout like what you're okay with each\nother peop\nlike are doing but outside partners who\nis even more than that right like you\nhave friends\nyou have people that you just meet\nonline so like what are some stuff that\nyou're comfortable talking\nwith them about how you interact with\nthem every person is different and this\nis the type of communication that's so\nimportant you have that most people\ndon't\npeople just assume certain things that\nis okay from another person\ndo those things and then make others\nuncomfortable so that's why this is such\nan important conversation to have\nespecially with covert going on\nthere's so much online interactions\nright now so just kind of learning\nhow to define this boundary that you\nhave between people through online\nwould be really helpful okay yeah\nand strangers in the street as well\nlike a lot of people in the street think\num\njust because you don't know the person\nit's okay to step out of the boundary\nit's not like it's i think it's in every\ncase online friends and\nstrangers yeah okay so how is someone\nsupposed to learn\nwhat the right boundary is um\ni think setting boundaries has always\nbeen about\nwell what i've learned is that it's\nabout communicating your limits\nand how you want to be treated so in\norder for somebody to know\nhow you should be treated you have to\ncommunicate that to them in a way\nwhere they'll understand\nyeah okay um but unfortunately\ni have had more cases of strangers\nof people that i don't really talk to\nand\nit's really hard to communicate with\nsomeone you just met like two seconds\nago so\ni think it's also just uh common sense\nin what you should or should\ndo but when you have that close\nrelationship with someone\nyes like they should be more established\nafter that\nokay and also what i think gets confused\na lot is like when you finally\nexpress your boundaries there are still\nsome people who think\nthat they are entitled to deflate those\nboundaries that they know better\nwhat to tell you what is right and wrong\nlike oh no this is actually not that bad\nor\noh this is you know this is don't make a\nscene out of this\nright but i think there's nothing wrong\nabout\nsetting your boundaries and\ncommunicating your boundaries\nokay what do you guys think motivates\nsomeone\nto try to deflate your boundary\nego what does that mean\num i think a lot of people don't like\num being told something don't like being\ntold that they were doing something\nwrong\nand out of ego they try to deflate you\nand what makes you comfortable or\nuncomfortable\nokay linda i think i think maybe a lot\nof people also just don't\nthink that things apply to them because\nthey like try to read you and then they\nassume that they're special for some\nreason\nso that the boundaries just don't apply\nto them anymore for some reason\ninteresting okay i think it could also\nbe a power dynamic\num because i've experienced that at work\nand in relationships too\nbecause when people feel like they have\na certain authority over you\nit's almost like they're setting the\nboundaries not necessarily\nlistening to yours so it makes it hard\nto\ncommunicate what you're not okay with um\njust out of fear that they might\nretaliate or\num won't listen to you okay um is it\nokay if i kind of challenge some of what\ny'all are saying i know it sounds\nbizarre yeah\nfor sure yeah so so like we don't have\nto get into this now but i just want to\nthink a little bit about like\na counterpoint so as a psychiatrist i'm\na big fan of setting firm boundaries you\nknow\nhere's my cell phone it's appropriate to\nuse it if you\nwant to schedule something or if you're\nin a true crisis\nbut it's not uh just text me at random\nhours of the day\nat the same time so when we think about\num so i think setting boundaries is\nreally important it's a lot of what i\ntry to educate people on\nat the same time when it comes\nespecially to romantic relationships\ni think a lot of romantic relationships\nthrive with a lack of boundaries\nright so i'm trying to figure out like\nif you think about flirtation\nso flirtation is almost like kind of by\ndefinition\nnot saying thanks yeah\nright yeah okay so some that's why i'm\nso it's just a different perspective you\nall are welcome to disagree\nor sort of educate us on like how that\nisn't the case\nbut i i just know i'm i'm actually\nthinking about you know when my wife and\ni got together like\nwe were apparently dating and i wasn't\neven aware of it\ni thought i was just showing her around\ntown she thought we were going on dates\nand there was a lot of you know\nconfusion there yeah and\nand i think frankly i probably would\nhave done a far worse job if i thought i\nwas on a date\ni thought we were just hanging out and\nand so sometimes when i do look at\nrelationships sometimes things are a\nlittle bit ambiguous right so like\nat what point do you set a boundary with\nsomeone about like what your\nrelationship\nis like do you meet someone and say\nhello i'm so-and-so\ni'm single and i'm not looking for a\nrelationship nice to meet you\nyou know when you meet people online\nkind of yes to be honest\nso it's actually a genuine question\nright so like i i get what you guys are\nsaying about the value of setting what\nyour limits are\ncompletely agree with that the thing\nthat i'm a little bit confused\nabout um and i imagine our community is\nconfused about is like\nwhen and how do you actually do that\nin my experience and i don't think this\nis like the best way to do it but in my\nexperience most of those conversations\nhave happened\nlike after someone's crossed a boundary\nand you have to like\ngo back and be like hey sorry that i\ngave you the wrong idea\num i'm not in love with you you know\nyeah or whatever it might be\nand that's a huge problem right is\nbecause like there's a lack of\nsetting boundaries and then you get into\na situation\nwhere there's confusion on both sides\nand so what i'm\nkind of like really curious about is\nlike part of what we try to do on stream\nis to make things applicable\nand what i'm envisioning is like if i'm\na 17 year old kid watching stream\nwhat can i learn from y'all about how i\ninteract with like women i feel that\nwhenever you are unsure\nask and obviously not from the start we\ndon't go out and just be like i'm single\nand i'm talking to you because i'm\ninterested like that's just not going to\nhappen right\nyeah so yeah like obviously a lot of\ninteraction starts off as friendship and\nmaybe\nthat person is flirting you don't know\nyou're confused so after hanging out\nask them be like hey like i just want to\nmake sure i'm not\ntaking the wrong hints like is this that\nwhenever you're unsure about anything at\nall regarding you and another person\nit's so scary for that confrontation but\nyou just have to go and ask\nokay so scary for the confrontation i\nthink that's a really important point\nyeah\nand also um at least in my experience i\nthink\num that part of if you're\nif you don't want if you're scared to\ncommunicate in your you might step\na boundary i think it should only happen\nwhen you know for sure you're already\nvery comfortable with that person uh i\nthink like\nif you already have a little bit of not\ntrust like friendship with that person\nyou already know them well the person\nyou\nyou didn't come in like trying to\nimmediately step\num step on the boundaries\nthen like if you have that trust then\nat least in my case if i already trust\nsomeone if they step a boundary\nand uh i think i like if i have like a\nresponsive um\nwith the same way they they're coming\ntowards me i will also\ni'll be comfortable with it because i\nalready trust them but i think\na lot of people step the boundary too\nsoon sometimes\nokay and there needs to be a trust okay\nso i'm seeing a bunch of questions kind\nof rise to the surface\nhow do you develop trust right um\nand not that we have to answer these\nright away but and then i i also kind of\nheard from um\nstar that you know it sounds like\nsometimes the boundary conversation\nhappens\nand oddly enough i can kind of see how\nmafin\nand stark kind of may be talking about\nsomething like that's similar which is\nthat\nyou start a relationship you're not sure\nexactly where the boundary is\nyou start to develop really like\nfriendship and trust and then maybe they\nthink it's one thing you think it's\nanother thing\nyou kind of cross that boundary and then\nyou have a conversation about it\nalthough that doesn't really sound ideal\nbut i'm sort of seeing value to\nyou know not having the conversation the\nfirst time you meet someone\nand also like that seems too early\nand then in in stars case it seems like\nsome of those conversations happen way\ntoo late\nand so you know how do we find that\nmedium\nand i think that's something practically\nthat if the at the end of\nof today if we could sort of have some\nguidance around that i think that would\nbe a really cool\nlike takeaway what do you all think for\nsure\nokay so does anybody want to like let's\nlet's dive in does anybody want to share\nlike a situation that they've been in i\nkind of want to hear from star\nbut which one which is not\ni don't know i'm just trolling you so\nseriously\nanyone wanna i mean i do want to hear\nfrom you but i didn't mean to put you on\nthe spot\nno you're good um you see guys what i\ndid there as i tested a boundary i was\nlike asking oh a storm is it\nokay but does anybody feel like they\nwant to share a situation\nlater i think if she goes first it's\nit's okay i have\num so mine gets into power dynamics i\nhad a\nsituation i guess i could say with a\nprofessor\noh [ __ ] yeah\nyeah and so like i'm laughing because\ni'm uncomfortable\nsame i'm good i don't know look we're\nhere to talk about real experiences so\nas long as it's not going to\nthe one thing that i strongly strongly\nrecommend that people do on stream is\nrecognize that this is public and if\nthis is going to actually impact you in\na negative way in terms of your\neducation star\ni would actually actually say you know\nno\nyou're okay i've already been through uh\nsome stuff with my school regarding the\nincident but basically\nyeah um basically i\ni'm an engineering student and you're\nlike first two years of engineering they\nkind of make you take classes in every\nfield to\nget you like up to speed on the\ndifferent industries\nand so i had a professor that wasn't\nreally in my major\ni'm mechanical and he was an electrical\nengineering professor\num and he was like hey like\ni think you should come and work in my\nlab which is like a huge opportunity for\na student right and especially like\ni definitely wasn't qualified right like\ni'd taken one electrical engineering\nclass at this point and i had like a b\nin it i think\num and so like he sort of had ulterior\nmotives there right um\nand so i went out to his lab once\nhe it was just kind of uncomfortable he\nlike hugged me when i got there\nand like like put his hand on my\nwaist while he was showing me around the\nlab and stuff and i was like okay\nnot going back there right like but i\nwas then put in a situation where like i\nhave to go back to class and see him\nright like i have to\ncontinue to be you know like i can't\nlike if it was\nif it was outside of school i could be\nlike [ __ ] off you know\nbut with a professor i don't really have\nthat opportunity\nso it was just like he would he got my\nnumber to like\ni don't know why i [ __ ] gave him my\nnumber in hindsight but i gave him my\nnumber to like coordinate when i would\nbe at the lab\num and he would text me like hey like\nwhat are you doing today you want to\ncome out to the lab and i'd have to like\nlike 12 times in a row i had to come up\nwith some excuse\nbecause i didn't want to say no to a\nprofessor that like\nhad my grade in his hand you know\ni'm processing that's fair\ni'm gonna need a second this is just\nhow old was the professor uh like 50.\nokay what do you all think about that\nbut it's also not surprising which is i\nthink the more\nlike like it doesn't even really shake\nyou anymore\nit's almost like you're used to\nlistening to stuff like that linda\nwhat's not surprising about it\nthat that the situation happened like\nit feels so normal to hear about these\nthings almost to a point where it\ndoesn't\nyeah almost like oh you too\nyou know yeah yeah which is a sad thing\nyou know\nto yeah to relate i mean to be fair\nthat kind of behavior oversets\nboundaries and it's\njust predatory like uh\nwhat's predatory about it he is a fifth\nyear old\nprofessor who is trying to have this\ntype of relationship or conversation\nwith a student who is much younger than\nhe is so\nyeah yeah there's the power dynamic\nthere with the profession obviously\nand then also the setting of where all\nthis is taking place as well\num i also have a story about\nmore of the theme of power dynamic that\nhappened to a friend of mine\num she was being followed by a man\nand yeah she was being followed by a man\nand she went to the police\ni went with her the first time then we\nhad to go to another place\nand she was taking care of the business\nof the matter\nand the policeman that gave her his\nnumber\nand so she could call him when she was\nbeing followed and they could get there\nhe started asking if she had a boyfriend\nand if they could meet out\noutside of her house at night alone and\nshe had to get\none of her co-workers to pretend to be\nher boyfriend for him to\nstop messaging her and it just really\nmakes me angry because\nit's you can't call the police on the\npolice so\nit just makes me really angry that she\nhad to go through that situation where\nher only safety net just exploded\nbasically and we only didn't report this\nbecause um she was already so devastated\nabout the whole thing that she did not\nhave the emotional energy to\ngo report it\nokay this is way heavier [ __ ] than what\ni was mentally prepared for\nno i mean i think it's like i'm just\nsharing how i feel i don't think\nwe should stop it's just like wow\ni was expecting something along the\nlines of\nyou know someone messages me on on\ndiscord\nand then i have to block them after a\ncouple of days\nyou know we can talk about that too yes\nwe also have those stories\nthere's a lot more of those\ni mean so you know it's interesting\nbecause you know lin uh star said\ni can't tell him to [ __ ] off\nand i'm noticing the same thing in math\nstory the thing that i think\nactually terrifies me the most and when\ni think about what's my instinctive\nreaction to hearing you guys\nis it's actually like a powerlessness\nbecause when someone dm's you on discord\nyou can tell them to [ __ ] off\nyeah but it's like these situations\nwhere sort of like\nit almost feels like you can't enforce a\nboundary\nright and yeah and so i'm kind of\ncurious how do you guys deal with\na situation where you can't tell someone\nto [ __ ] off and then that also begs the\nquestion of why can't you\num um can you repeat the questions\ni was just saying why can't you tell\nthem to [ __ ] off\nfor me it's like let's start with alyssa\nit's what alyssa um it's always been a\nfear of retaliation\nsomething bad happening to me um you\nknow getting punished\nor um you know i've watched lots of\nthose um\nstories about girls who have you know\nsaid\none wrong thing and then they got killed\nor you know something really\num terrible happening so it's just a\nfear of\nany of that on top of um even having to\ngo to the police sometimes like i was\nalso\num followed by a man when i was about 19\nto my job and um i didn't know what to\ndo\ni didn't feel comfortable going to the\npolice so when he showed up to my\nmy job i was like i froze i'm\nthe type of person to freeze so um\nyeah like you're saying in that moment i\nfelt very powerless\nand i think that that um that pressure\nto like do something but also not\nknowing what to do\nis what has kept me silent many times\nbecause it's like i don't want to make a\nwrong move and have that backfire on me\nlisa you had something to say uh for me\njust due to a lot of bad experience i've\nlearned now to just\nsimply say like like you suddenly [ __ ]\noff or in a nicer way but like be very\nfirm\nwith people but the times that i yes how\ndo you say that in a nicer way\num so like if it's dms and they like\nkeep pushing be like hi sorry i'm just\nnot interested or like i'm\ngoing through a lot right now and i do\nnot want to make this connection with\nyou\nand then they keep pushing and overset\nthat boundary i was like i actually will\ntell them be like hi you are going\nway overboard right now i'm actually\ngoing to block you now\nso that's usually the most direct way if\nit's someone that are really persistent\nthe times i did feel very powerless is\nusually if it's in regards to\npeople related to my career um just\nbecause\ni can't say [ __ ] off to someone that may\nbe uh\ndetrimental to like a networking system\num\nso those times it's very hard for me to\nshare with\nanyone because it's like who do i trust\nwhere this won't spread or like i don't\nwant this to cause\nthis like deal or anything so just just\na lot of\nuncomfortable feelings usually during\nthose times i will talk to\nlike my someone like i'm really close\nwith in terms of my co-workers i'll\ntell my boss about it or like someone in\nhr\nand but i have to say that not much is\nusually done per se it's usually they\nlisten to me\nwe feel better about it and they try to\nlimit my interaction with that person\nbut there's been not a lot of\nrepercussion towards that individual\nwhich\nis honestly kind of my thing too because\ni'm scared of it i'm just oh i don't\nwant repercussions to him because i\ndon't know\nlike it will like fire back at me so\nthose are the times where i'm definitely\nreally quiet and i'm scared even though\nany other time i'm usually the first one\nto talk yeah it's interesting i don't\nknow if you guys get the sense but i i\nget\nthe sense that risa doesn't [ __ ] around\nyou guys\nwe've learned that about her in the last\nthree years so it's like\nit's pretty easy to tell and at the same\ntime\nthere are also things that get her to\nkind of like\nstep carefully and and remain quiet\nwhich also is like\nextra terrifying because rhys is staying\nquiet\nwhich means that there's got to be\nsomething you know pretty significant\num so i i'm noticing some and i'm sorry\ndid somebody else want to speak\nlinda or champ\nokay no it's fine maybe later\num so i i'm noticing a certain tone of\nlanguage which is like repercussion\npunishment retaliation\num so it sounds like you guys have some\namount of fear\nabout what could happen if you set a\nboundary\nright so like on the one hand there's\nlike repercussions which is like hey i\nthink this is inappropriate\nand someone should be punished but\nthat's like at one end of the spectrum\nso i i do think that like a formal\ncomplaint against this\nprofessor like sounds like a good idea\num\njust because but on the other hand i\nalso wonder a little bit about like\num you know education and i'm just\nthinking about\nobserving some some of my own\nexperiences so i\ni once worked in a hospital where there\nwas uh\nthere was like a senior doctor who was\nlike from foreign country where\nsexuality was like way more acceptable\nand so he would like openly say sexual\nthings to\npeople including his junior people and\nthey seem to actually be okay with it\nlike i'm not sure i didn't really have a\nconversation\nbut he would even like talk to his\njunior people and he would be like when\nare we going to have sex\nand then everyone it's crazy and then\neveryone would just kind of laugh and\nlike it sort of continued\nand and i don't get the sense like\nhonestly just\nreading people's facial expressions and\nstuff i i thought that everyone was just\nsort of like oh like that's just how he\nis\nand some people even he was also like a\ngood-looking european dude\num you know in shape and in his 40s and\nwith a good head of hair\nand so sometimes i wonder a little bit\nabout that kind of thing but it's like a\nstrange thing where i'm not sure like\na repercussions appropriate is education\nappropriate like what's the\nright\nyou know so i think that's the thing is\nthey're pro\noh sorry you go first i've talked more\num i think that\nin that case people just let it slide\nbecause they i don't know maybe they're\nused to seeing people like that it's\njust oh it's it's just how he is\nbut you should really educate them that\nno one said anything\nbut they could have been very\nuncomfortable maybe there was\none person who had a closer experience\nwith him and no one said and\nno one knows about it i think it's more\nof an education thing\neven if yes how do you do that\ni don't know but what i could\nobserve like in a work environment is\nthat you know everyone\nkind of don't want to like you know\nstand out they just want to blend in\nand don't make a scene and keep it you\nknow yeah\nprofessional and quiet so they are just\nobserving\nyou know their environment and they are\njust can adapt to that\nyou know they are they can't really like\ngive some like authentic view on things\nbecause they think that yeah i have this\njob now\nmy job is just to do that job and to\nkind of like blend in and not\ncause a scene so it's really hard in\nwork environment i think\nsee i i work as a strainer as well\nsometimes um and i mean\nit's like sort of like i will\nflirt with people that come into my gym\ni will [ __ ] with my co-workers and stuff\nlike that because it like gives a little\nbit of an extra kick and motivation if\nit makes sense so it's like\nit doesn't actually seem that odd to me\npersonally so\ni don't think you can't even blame that\nperson just because like\nlike you mentioned the reception seemed\npositive everyone's just like laughing\nalong with him and there's also this\nquote that\ni like and dislike heavily that's just\nhow he is right\nand honestly he doesn't know better if\nno one has ever spoken up against him\ni think the most important point here is\nthat if someone\ngoes up to him and it's like hey i am\nuncomfortable with this\nhe should never respond with that's just\nhow i am\nbut if noah has ever spoken to him like\nthat before then\nhim acting this way honestly i'm not\nupset just because it has\nbeen positive for him yeah so i'm gonna\nonce again\nchallenge this or play devil's advocate\nfor a minute okay so like let's say that\ni'm\na 19 year old guy in the gaming\ncommunity\nand and or let's let's not even say 19.\nlet's say i'm 26.\nand i'm a caster for a particular esport\nand i'm a prominent caster\nand i tend to be a little bit vivacious\na little bit inappropriate a little bit\nhumorous it's part of my on-screen\npersonality that makes me successful\nand so what i'm kind of curious about is\nlike especially when you kind of think\nabout power dynamics if you all are\nreluctant to speak\nand i'm not blaming you for feeling that\nway because there could be repercussions\nand we've heard\nsome of those stories before and and\nyou know at the same time like no one\nhas really ever told me that i'm doing\nsomething wrong\num you know how am i supposed to know\nlike\nwhat's appropriate or inappropriate\ni guess and if i can talk i guess in\nthat situation\ni wouldn't blame that person unless\nsomeone\ncame to them and said this was\ninappropriate and they\nlike tried to brush that off does that\nmake sense like\ni think in some situations it\ndepends more on the person's reaction\nthan\non their initial actions and i mean\nin a way especially like public people\nlike\ncasas like that especially when they're\nlike popular\ni mean those are one of the most like\ndiscussed people i don't really know how\nto say it but like there's like [ __ ]\ntons of reddit posts and people's\nopinions online so\ni mean i guess i can get like really\nhard to filter stuff out and to listen\nto what's like\nprobably morally right but then that's\nlike different for everybody anyway\nso um\nyeah so i mean that makes a lot of sense\nto me i'm just and it kind of goes back\nto what risa was saying too\nif they respond with that's just how i\nam so what i'm hearing you guys say is\nnot so much that\ni mean it sounds certainly like some\nbehavior is inappropriate right\nvery inappropriate and at the same time\nthere is like\nthere's a space between punishing\nsomeone for behaving inappropriately\nand educating them and really not so\nmuch about like\nthat you're setting a boundary with them\nbut the way that they respond to\nand respond to your boundary setting\nthat's actually like the really\nimportant thing\nthe setting that you put to the caster\nas someone who works with a lot of\ncasters and they're all\namazing like saying that first\nit's so important for them to like\nbounce off of like\nthe other casters and whoever they're\nworking with and that's how they get\ntheir reactions they gauge reactions\nobserving is literally their job\nand so i feel like it's very hard\nfor them to miss if someone's obviously\nuncomfortable\ninteresting like in your in your example\nwhere if someone's just\nthe personality is that they just make a\nlot of these like remarks out\nif i was a fellow caster and they did\nsomething like that to me and i suddenly\njust shut up and go\nlike that i feel there's certain stuff\nthat i will automatically instantly\nreact to even if i'm not like hey that's\nlike awful\nthat caster is ignorant\nif they choose not to look into that\nreaction i feel like they're just like\nall right just moving on this is just\nhow i am so like i\nmentioned that's the excuse again that's\njust how i am i feel like if you're\nuh okay uh i don't know i just feel like\nworking on observing\nbecause i think the pivotal is still for\nsomeone to speak up and tell him\nlike hey like this action actually makes\nme uncomfortable because you can't just\nassume they would know but\npeople should work on observing skills\nin general to try to\nlike view boundaries absolutely it\nsounds like it's really important\num so i'm kind of curious when it comes\nto uh\nyou know responding or or so what i'm\nhearing is that\nat some point you guys generally or may\nor may not try to communicate\ndepending on your sense of of fear about\nrepercussions\nyour sense of power and the relationship\num\nyou know so maybe you guys will say\nsomething maybe you won't and then the\nway that they respond to that\nis really important so can you guys\nshare\njust your experiences of when you have\ntried to communicate so it sounds like\nsometimes you don't feel comfortable\num and and when you have tried to\ncommunicate what happens\ni i saw a star raise your hand i well i\njust wanted to share\nwith my professor um\nso well this is just like his response\num\nwhich wasn't to me so i ended up telling\nanother professor that i trusted and he\ntold me that there was like an office\nthat\nhandles this kind of stuff and so i went\nto them and said like hey like this\nprofessor made me a little uncomfortable\nthey did like these things you know um\nand i later found out that i like wasn't\nthe only student that said something\nabout him that semester\num and so they like wrote up our\nstatements and like sent it to him and\nthen he made a statement and then\nthey like sent us the like follow-up or\nwhatever\nand he literally said like this\ngeneration is so sensitive\nlike that was his like official quote in\nresponse that he was like what\nwhat do they want by saying this and i\nwas like all right dude\nlike gr you know at that point what do i\ndo\nwhat what what do you do\ni mean i don't i just blocked his number\ni never talked to him again\nhow'd you do in the class i actually got\nan a\ni stopped going to class but my grades\non my\nlike tests were enough to get an a i\ndidn't need him\nyeah wow what other experiences of\ntrying to respond to people and how that\nthat's received\nlike i i often see like guys\nplaying that yield card whenever you\nare addressing your boundaries like for\nexample\nlike there was a user who you know i was\njust\nin the mood to listen to someone and\nthere was a user who\nexplained me his things and i'm like\nokay\nyou know so i listened to that person\nand then\nat one point he messaged me and said\nlike oh\nlike i think i have a crush on you\nyou know that stuff and i'm like\nokay look first of all like\ndid this how how does this work right\nlike i'm just here listening and you\nhave a crush on me like you actually\ndon't know\nreally who i am and it's kind of like\nweird to me that just from\nspeaking to someone you can have a crush\non right like i can tell you whatever i\nwant online basically right you don't\nknow me\nyou don't know where i live you don't\nknow when like you don't know anything\nabout me\num so i was saying to him like look this\nis this is\nthis can't work like i was just like\nfine listening to\nto you and i feel bad for your situation\nbut this is just\num yeah like this is not my attempt you\nknow like i didn't try to\nyou know to engage any like relationship\nwith you\nso what he said is oh\nlike you know uh\ni am like really in a good spot and\nwhy are you rejecting me and why are you\ndoing this\nto me and i'm like like how how how\nshould i react\nin that situation like should i feel\nguilty for rejecting him for\ntelling him my boundaries like right i i\nthought i was\nlike i don't have to tolerate everything\nright i can right yeah i don't have to\ndo this\nand that's like that guilt card on me is\nlike\nyes and it's not the first time like\nit's also in real life that happens like\nwhat is that\nfeeling what is the feeling that you get\nwhen someone\nsays like why do you think that you have\nto put\nall your weight on my shoulders like\nwhy do you think that i have to be that\nperson manipulation\nyes how does how do you guys imagine\nchamp\nfeels when they do that frustrated\nby what math because she\nis afraid that her actions will have\num a reaction but at the same time it's\nnot her\njob to take care of him like he's a baby\nso\nit's just guilt it's manipulation\nsounds like emotional blackmail yeah\ni've had that happen to me too\ni was 17 i had a group of friends on\ndiscord\nand this 24 year old dude started\nspeaking to me also a thing of like two\nthree weeks\nspeaking um i wasn't saying i was like\nnot interested but then in the end i\njust i just like no i'm not interested\nat all to speak to you\nand he made me feel guilty for rejecting\nhim to the point\nwhere i was crying my eyes out even\nthough i didn't like him\nand he was fine i called him and he was\nfine and i was crying my eyes out\nhe was making me feel guilty for\nrejecting him and\nafter all of that happened i was banned\nfrom the group of friends\nso i felt at the time i didn't see it\nbut now i look back into it\nand i realized i was just\nsome someone he could speak to for them\nit didn't work out so just they didn't\nneed me anymore and\nthe worst part of it they made me feel\nbad for it okay so because\ni didn't want to be with him yeah so let\nme ask you something how does someone\nmake\nyou feel guilty because\nthey're expressing their sadness and you\nthink\nand it's obviou when you make someone\nsad it could be from your actions but in\nthat case he was faking it he was\nmanipulating it\nto make me feel sad for for me to stay\nhow do you know he was faking it i\ncalled him\nand i was crying my eyes out and what he\nwas saying in text\nwas he was fine and called he was\nspeaking normally\nhe wasn't sad at all it was his stone\nsure i can i cannot be\n100 sure but he was fine\nokay so what i'm hearing is that\nsometimes people yeah\nlinda go for it oh i was just going to\nsay that\nfor me a lot of the time is like when\nsomeone\nlike confesses to me or something that\nthat especially online it's been that\nwe've already spent time together and\nwe've like sort of\nbuilt a bond as in like a lot of guys\nactually\nopen up a lot and talk about their\nproblems with you\num and i'm not sure whether that comes\nfrom like they don't trust\nto guys to talk about it um\nbut they're a lot more open towards well\nme or something like that\num and then at that point it's like\nyou know the [ __ ] that is going on in\ntheir life you know how bad they feel\nabout certain things and like\nin a way how like lost they are and you\nlike want to help them\num but then\nthen they come out and they they tell\nyou that they like you and then you\nsuddenly sit in that spot where you have\nto hurt them\nand you sit in a call with them and you\nlisten to them to their like voice\nwhile they speak to you and it just like\ndestroys you because you're like\nyou're their friend and you're trying to\nbe there for them but you literally\ncan't and it just hurts them\nand it sucks yeah\nso i i think that's also uh there are a\ncouple of important points here about\nwhat confiding in someone means and i\nthink sometimes\ndifferent people me think it means\ndifferent things\none thing that i kind of want to point\nout for a second is that what i'm\nhearing from math and\nand from y'all is that you know they can\nsay words that\nmake you feel a certain way is that fair\nyeah and so what i'm kind of curious\nabout in hearing linda's case is i\nwonder if the opposite is also true\nwhere you can say words that make them\nfeel a certain way\ni mean absolutely so then what i'm kind\nof curious about is like if you hold\nthem responsible\nwhich is sort of what i'm hearing for\nmaking you feel guilty\ncan they hold you responsible for making\nthem feel love\ni don't really\nlike i i can't really blame them you and\nand like\ni also like sort of if if someone has\nfeelings for me i could\nsort of encourage that they get it out\nbecause it like helps\nright it helps to talk about um so i\ndon't actually mind it too much it's\njust like\ni'm i'm just like not sure how to like\nemotionally deal with it myself\nbecause i'm inflicting this pain by\nrejecting them\nyep the thing with that too is that if\nsomeone is protecting their sadness to\nme i don't find them\nlike guilty of anything they're honestly\ni don't even call them fake or anything\nif they're sad they're sad right\nbut the issue is if i tell them that\nlike oh hey like so\ni'm going to use a specific story so\nsomeone messaged me and just gave me\ntheir\nlife story about how i'm very similar to\ntheir\nex i remind them of her she she broke\nhis heart and that he's\ngoing through a lot mentally through\ndepression and a lot of very serious\nissues right\ni've never really talked to him much\nprior to this so i don't know this man\nwell at all so this was just like his\nlife story suddenly at me so i told him\nhey i'm really sorry\nabout everything that you went through\nthat sounds horrible i think you should\nspeak\nabout this to someone close to you like\na friend\nand he retaliates saying like oh i'm\nalready going through like so much i\nguess like people\nthese days on internet just don't want\nto listen to others that you don't care\nabout\nanyone and for me that made me very\nangry right like i didn't show it but\nit's just a responsibility that you\ndon't put on someone i don't blame him\nfor sharing all that story for me was it\nweird sure\nbut i'm not here saying like you can't\ndo this you can't say this to me\nbut if i'm telling you like hey like\nsorry\ngo next you go next you don't then be\nlike\nno i told you this now you have to\nrespond to me\nthat makes sense so i'm hearing a common\ntheme of so it's interesting right so if\nwe go to\na champs case and and you know champ is\nlistening to someone\non i presume the the internet champ is\nthat right\nyeah yeah and then when he says hey i\nhave a crush on you\ndo you guys think that that's a good\ncommunication or a bad communication on\nhis part\ni don't mind that yeah just be okay if i\nsay no\nyeah yeah but do people disagree because\ni mean you're allowed to not feel that\nway right\nso like i i think the problem is when\npeople don't stop after you tell them\num like i've had\nso so generally whenever someone\nconfesses to me i\ni sort of try to stay friends with them\nbecause they're like good people and\ni mean i am sort of close with them um\nbut i had for example one um\ncase in real life where this this friend\nof me\num just like kept trying to make\nmake moves of me and kept like touching\nme inappropriately and stuff like that\neven though after\nuh even after i told him multiple times\nthat i wasn't interested in him\nat all and i didn't like\num i would say that i didn't do anything\nback to him so it should have been\nin a way obviously from obvious from his\nside that\nthere was like nothing coming for me um\nand that just like sort of\nkept happening and happening to a point\nwhere it was like\ni couldn't bother to deal with it\nanymore and i just i gave up the\nfriendship\neven though i would have loved to like\nwow\nyeah it's like there's a difference\nbetween someone saying like i feel this\nway about you and someone saying like\nyou're responsible for this happiness or\nlike you owe me this happiness\nand sometimes it's like like any\nconfession you're not sure which side\nthat it's on\nyeah like i didn't mind even though i\nfind it kind of weird and i find it it\nkind of didn't make sense that he\njust said he has a crush on me after\njust like hearing his story\num and and just me hearing him out\num i didn't have a problem with him like\nsaying to me directly that he has a\ncrush on me\nbut when then i told him like\nlook i i already told him like look i\nappreciate\nyou saying that's this to me so i can\ngive him like that feedback\nbut this is not like uh this was\ni'm sorry if this was my like if you\nthought that this was my\nattention right that i tried to engage\nany like relationship\nuh thing so the thing that bothered me\nwas like when he played that guild card\nlike\noh like you know exactly that i'm going\nthrough things so that i'm really like\nyou know not good with you know taking\nbad responses so better act the way that\ni\nwant like this is how i felt um\ni felt really like off and this is when\ni was\nsaying to him look i don't deserve this\ngoodbye and this is where i blocked him\nyeah and i'm actually glad that this was\nlike on the internet and not\nreal life because you know\ni don't know if yeah with the real life\nyou can block and people\nyeah block people in real life\nyeah i\nokay so a couple of thoughts so i i want\nto kind of return to this idea so here's\nthe general theme which i'm hearing\nso first of all there's ambiguity at the\nbeginning of the relationship\nand then at some point it sounds like\nfor the most part you guys are\nokay with people sharing their feelings\nabout you even if they're weird and they\ncome from\nlike you know we don't know where they\ncome from that you kind of talk to a\nstranger on the internet\num in reese's case that just sounds so\n[ __ ] you remind me of my ex-girlfriend\nlike that is the worst\njust don't even anyway\num right because it's like it's not even\nabout and i think this is what i'm\nhearing from you guys is it's not about\nyou\nthere's like something coming from them\nthat you sort of\nfit into a mold does that make sense\nyeah yeah and and so the tricky thing so\ni\nthe interesting thing is that i actually\nam hearing even though it can be\nmake you uncomfortable and can be hard\nin terms of a conversation that it's\nactually a good thing\nfor them to tell you like hey i have\nthese feelings about you\nand then comes the key thing which is\nthat like they should respect your\nresponse\nbut instead what seems to be happening\nis when you guys respond\nthey respond in such a way that they\nkind of make you feel guilty maybe they\ndo a little bit\njust a touch of that sprinkling of that\nemotional blackmail\nor something like that they don't really\nrespect the boundary\nit's interesting because it's like it's\nnot so much that they're ambiguity or\ntheir feelings\nit's that like the boundary is not\nrespected once it's set\num it's a problem with your generation\nstar\ny'all are just so right i've been\ninappropriately groping women since i\nwas 20 years old and they didn't have a\n[ __ ] problem with it i don't know\nwhat's wrong with y'all\njesus kids nowadays\n[Music]\nright so here's here's my next question\nfor you guys\nand and i want to kind of like tunnel\ndown into this so like\nyou know i don't mean to be let me know\nif this comes across the wrong way or if\nyou guys feel like i'm asking an\ninappropriate question or making an\nappropriate assumption so in a sense we\nthink it's like\nokay that i mean we sort of acknowledge\nthat they can do certain things to make\nyou feel a certain way\nthe common nature of your experience\nmakes me\nthink that you guys are consistently\ndoing something to make them fall in\nlove with you\nor have questions\ni think it's just the image they have of\nus it's not like we're even doing\nanything\nfor i feel like oh okay so i'm going to\ncalm down a little bit\nbut simply being a approachable\nperson i've learned makes people assume\nthat we fit like you mentioned a mold of\ntheirs and ideal of theirs\nthat makes it okay to suddenly bear\ntheir stories and to be\na certain extent a lot of us here as i\nmentioned but all these ladies have been\nreally supportive and they are\nall very approachable and it's like\nwelcoming to others\nbut it's about taking advantage of that\nwhen we\nput the boundaries of saying no this is\ngoing too far\nyeah dude like i had i had weird stuff\nlike\npeople just speaking to me for five\nminutes and they were like doing\nstatements like\nyeah i know for sure you my dream wife\nwhatever and i'm like you don't even\nknow me\nyou don't know maybe i'm a terrible\nperson like maybe what you heard in\nthose five minutes is not even me like\nhow can you tell me that like i don't\nwant to be\nlike i don't want to have this\nconfirmation of like men\n[Music]\ntelling me that i am their fantasy after\nfive minutes talking like\nare you even interested to understand me\nto know me or is it just like\nokay she's my fantasy check let's go no\ndon't do that\ni think that comes down to them having\nlike a very a very small checklist to be\nfit it's like\nshe plays games you know what she's a\nwoman\nshe's female oh nice okay\nthat's it i need those three things and\nthat's perfect now we're good\nwe can get married now\ni think a lot of people also confuse\nthis happens with both sides\nfriendliness with flirting a lot of\npeople also confuse that being nice oh\ni obviously want you because i'm not\ntelling you to [ __ ] off\nso yeah that's also a problem that\nhappens to a lot of people\nso so when i trust yeah go ahead melissa\nthere was a point in my life where i had\nthis happen\nso often that i figured okay the only\nway to stop this from happening\nis to be mean and that didn't really\nfit my narrative as a person so i would\nalways feel a lot of conflict if\nsomebody\nyou know confided in me and you know\ntold me that they had feelings for me\nand then sort of\nexpected anything more and i didn't feel\nthe same way\nit was just it sucked that it happened\nso often\nin relationships with my friends\nand um i guess i just wish that\nthere was an easier way to navigate\nsituations like that\nso that it's not so uncomfortable was\nthat an okay question to ask\nabsolutely so i think here's what i\nreally liked about\ny'all's answer so i i think so i sort of\nsaid if they can make you feel guilty\ncan you make them fall in love and what\ni heard you guys say is that\nyou know i i do genuinely think\nsomething is going on here where there's\nclearly a common pattern\nof men feeling this way about you\nso then the question becomes if there's\na common pattern\nyou know where does that come from and\nwhat i'm hearing from y'all\nis that they have some kind of like\nstrange preconceived notion\nthat they're not actually falling in\nlove with you\nthey're falling in love with some like\ni yeah it's weird right like\nand you can hear you can hear it with\nrisa like like\nsome guy randomly and he's like you\nremind me of my ex-girlfriend which\nsignals to me that there are a lot of\nfeelings on his end which have\nnothing to do with risa\nand and where do you guys think like\nwhere like how does\ntalking to someone for you know five\nminutes on the internet\nturn you i mean don't get me wrong champ\ni've known you for a little while and i\nthink you're an awesome person but\ni'm still a little bit confused about\nyou know what you're doing that makes\nrandom strangers consistently fall in\nlove with you on the internet\ni i think you're great i don't think\nyou're that great\ni it confuses us too\nyeah so what do you guys think like\nwhat's up with that uh\ni think it's an experience right like if\nyou're someone who is not used to\nsomeone being responsive to you\nand then you're talking to champ and\nshe's like so nice it's like yeah i'll\nlisten to you\nand it's the first time ever someone\nlistens to him i understand where it's\ncoming from where someone's just like oh\nmy gosh this girl's so nice to me she's\nthe only one she must be\na nice person she must be someone that\ncould\nhelp out with x y and z going forward so\ni think inner experience does deal a lot\nwith it\nbut as mentioned like once champ was\njust like oh no i'm sorry\nand he's just like oh you know what i've\nalready gone through how dare you do\nthat it's just him being\nupset because you no longer fit that\nidea\nyeah yeah like reality check this is not\ngonna work\ni oh yeah that's that's interesting\nright so then like suddenly they have\nthis idea\nof what champ is and what this\nrelationship is\nand then you guys come along and i can\nsee where a lot of the toxicity towards\ntowards women comes in because then they\nsort of blame you for tearing it down\nhow dare you not live up to my fantasy\nyeah it's like we've denied them\nsomething yeah and that's\nthat's interesting right because i i've\nheard this thread of entitlement or\nexpectation\nyeah what do y'all think about that\nwhat's up with that\nlike i can't i can maybe say something\ngo ahead um because it's kind of like\nmixing like rl\nwith online relationships um so\nwhen i had my first relationship i\ni don't know i didn't thought that i\ncould like set boundaries or i\nthis was not a thing that i\ni i don't know i just didn't think that\nthis was a thing that you have to do in\na relationship\ni yeah so like i was just like so happy\nthat this person wanted to be with me\nand um it felt great to be honest like\nyou you're really overwhelmed if like\nsomeone wants to be with you\nso i was like basically like i i really\nwanted to like expect\nlike meet his expectations see him happy\nso i keep doing that for years and then\nat one point i realized that holy [ __ ]\ni'm so tired\nlike i am tired and i don't know where\nthis is coming from\nthis was when um it was a phase in my\nlife where i was really\nyou know like i set goals for myself i\nhad to push a bit more than i was used\nto\nand then i realized like holy [ __ ] i\ndon't have any energy\num and then i communicated that to him\nand i set boundaries after\nfour years right and then he was so\nconfused he gave he was\ngoing mad man he was like what do you\nmean and you know he\nand it kind of fell apart from there but\ni have to say like i'm also the one to\nblame for because i never communicated\nthose boundaries right so he was used to\nlike\nme being this person who meets every\nexpectation\nright so yeah\nthis is a huge learning that i had like\nit's okay to set boundaries\nbecause at the end of the day you want\nto be loved for who you\nare and be accepted for who you are and\nboundaries your boundaries is also a\npart of you\nand this person should love you with\nyour boundaries too\nand this is a huge learning that i had\num and i'm actually applying it to my\num recent like my actual relationship\nnow\nand i can see a huge difference so i'm\njust like\nreally trying to motivate you guys to\njust set your boundaries in relationship\ntoo\nsounds like someone leveled up\nyeah that's awesome um\nyeah so what do you guys think have you\nguys sort of dealt with the sense of\nexpectation or entitlement\nfrom interactions online or\nprofessors entitlement for sure okay so\ni will talk about\ntinder data that i had three years ago i\nthink\nnever met him i'll explain why um\ntexting wise where you set up a date you\nmeet\nand then it starts storming like crazy\netc and then the person was just like\nhey we're still meeting i was like hey\nlike\ntrees are falling down storms are awful\nlet's take a rain check and meet up like\nnext week instead\nit was like oh no no don't worry about\nit like i'll come pick you up\nand i was just like oh hey like i'm\nactually not comfortable with that\num so let's just do the rain check and\nhe just kept pushing he's like why are\nyou\nnot okay with this like i'm even\noffering\nto pick you up right now and you're\nstill saying no and i was just like hey\nsorry like\nit's just something i'm not comfortable\nwith but like i do want to meet with you\nso like next week\nand then you reply with c-u-n-t and then\ni saw that i was just like\nwhat just happened what does nt mean\ny'all are gonna have to educate me\ni don't know that's true i don't know\nc-u-n-t\noh see you aunty\nyeah yeah got it gotta go i i thought\nyou said\ns e e space why are you\nspace\n[Laughter]\nyeah i figured it out\ni thought it was like some you know i'm\na boomer and i like\nsee you no time it's like short for\nc-u-n-t in no time\nlike a case that like this person was i\nwas like really nice and everything\nand i felt like i was rejecting the\nnicest way possible while setting that\nboundary of just not wanting to pick me\nup\nbut something just didn't live up to\nthat expectation and he just called me\nthat\nand yeah so i\nand that's not like the first time not\nin terms of dating just in general where\nif i nicely reject someone they will\njust retaliate or something like\ncurse where like okay bye [ __ ] i didn't\nknow you actually just cruel and it's\njust like\nand that's what i am apologizing as\nnicely as possible hey i'm really sorry\nabout this but i just like can't have\nthis right now\nso i think those are the worst\nretaliations i've gotten\nyeah uh i've had\nlike a very soft case of that i haven't\nhad that experience yet\nbut um i've i was speaking to a guy\nand then after a while i just realized\ni'm not vibing with it i don't want to\nbe with him i don't want to speak to\nhim nothing he did personally i was just\nnot feeling\nthe situation and then i told him that\nonce and then i felt bad so i said okay\ni can give you a chance but don't expect\nme\nto after still not have the same idea if\ni have the same idea i will just stop\nspeaking to you and he was fine with it\nthen that time came and i said i'm still\nnot\nclicking with you i don't think it's\ngonna work out and\ni i said i don't think we're on the same\npage and\nhe he just told me oh he was\nlike okay fine but he was kind of like\npassive aggressive where he said\nsince you've decided not to be on the\nsame page since i've decided to be on\nthe same page like i get to decide if\ni'm not on the same page as you\nlike he he basically said oh you're just\nbasically calling me\nbasically calling me cruel like i've\njust decided to not\nthat i just didn't want to speak with\nhim for no reason but no i was just\nfeeling that\nand i get the choice too well i mean\nthat's like because he's also deciding\nto not be on the same page with you\nright it goes both ways like that's the\nwhole thing um yeah obviously like he\ncould tell me the same and\nokay that's fair like but he was just\nupset i guess\nor more like passive aggressive about i\nthink he wasn't too bad\nalso always like amazing the length\nthat people will go to to like try to\nmake that noah yes\nfor you because like so for me it was i\nonce um was like\nreally close with this guy um and he\nso first of all while we were just\nfriends we were just hanging out we were\nwatching movies together sometime\num he broke up with his girlfriend\nlater he told me that he broke up with\nthis girlfriend because he had feelings\nfor me\num and we even met irl once at an event\nand then um i mean i told him\nthere's nothing gonna be between us\nnothing's gonna happen and then after i\ntold him that he told me that he would\nliterally do anything for me\nhe would like pay rent for me i could\njust live with him i could just play\nvideo games all day i could just like\nchill there um and and i was just like\ni've i've told you for like two or three\ndays straight that\nnothing's gonna ever happen between us\nand now after we met you\nyou're gonna come at me with with that\nand then i had another instance of\na person um that that said that they\nwere in love with me\num and i said that i wasn't\nor whatever and then he like tried to\nstay friends but he was being like\nreally pushy and he was just really\nlike he needed a lot of attention so i\ndecided to stop talking to him\num and then he tried to he literally\ntried to bait me with anything possible\nto still talk to him like\nhe he came into my dms at some point and\nhe was like yeah my therapist\ntold me um to ask you\nwhat three things were about me that you\nliked and three\nthings that you didn't like or were the\nreason for us not being in a\nrelationship and i just sat there like\nhuh what no\nand it's just like these kind of things\nit's\nit's kind of strange\ni i i'm sorry i kind of missed you on\nthat last part is that what felt\ninappropriate about that was just\nbecause you didn't want i mean the thing\nis just\nno the thing is that there was like a\nclear no\nfrom my side like i told both of these\npeople that\nnothing was gonna happen but they just\nkept trying to push it and kept trying\nto like\nturn that no around um\nso which just gets tiring linda maybe i\ni totally understood what you were\nsaying in the first one in terms of like\nyou know someone asking you to pay their\nrent and\ni mean sorry that they'll pay your rent\nand you can play video games and\nand things like that that sounds really\nwack what i'm a little bit confused\nabout and maybe\nsomebody your colleagues can enlighten\nme is like\nwhen someone asks you three things that\ni was good at three things i was bad at\nand why things\ni mean wouldn't work out he used the\nexcuse of a\ntherapist first of all but then it was\nit was just like\ni hadn't talked to him in like weeks and\ni had ignored messages over messages\nover messages and it was just like okay\nit just wouldn't stop even after months\nto me to me it feels like also like he's\nlooking like he's requiring you to have\na concrete answer\nwhen really it should just be like i'm\nnot interested\nokay yeah to me it sounds like he\ntries to get like any feedback from you\nbecause this is something that he quite\ndon't understand\nbut i totally understand that like you\nknow spamming\na person and not reacting to a person is\nalso kind of\nyeah not comfortable yeah so that i\nthink makes\nthank you so much for clarifying that\nbecause on the one hand i was kind of\nwondering i was like you know because we\nwere talking earlier about education and\nwhether like that's a good opportunity\nto educate someone\nand at the same time it sounds like if\nthat comes after the conte\nor in the context of weeks of repeatedly\ntrying to get something from you and\nthen they pull the therapist card\nthat paints a pretty different picture\nright yeah\nand because on the one hand i was like\nthat sounds great like if someone you\nknow if someone says like hey\nif they're respecting your boundary and\nthey ask like can you tell me you know\nif i did something that was\ninappropriate\nthat sounds to me like a good\nopportunity to educate but on the other\nhand it also sounds like\nmy therapist using their therapist\nas a way to re-engage you yeah like from\nmy perspective it just seemed like he\nwanted to know three things that i liked\nabout him and then to give him three\nthings that he could like work on to\nlike be a better person in my\nperspective\nso then i see he might make the like he\nturn that note he had something to work\non for himself for me i guess but like\ngrind\non his like knows that he\nmaybe can get you yeah i'm almost\nnoticing like\nit's interesting because i i didn't\nrealize this assumption but now i kind\nof see it\nthere's almost an assumption there that\nif he grinds on those things\nthen linda won't have an excuse and that\nkind of goes back to the entitlement and\nexpectation\ni did everything that you said i was\nbad at love me now\nand when you still say no the\nretaliation gets worse yeah but i did\neverything\nlisa i did everything\nfor you yeah right so so this\nis the other trend that i'm kind of\nnoticing is i i'm getting the sense that\nthey don't\nreally treat you like people\nyeah does that make sense they treat us\nlike an image\nlike some an addition to their we're\nsomething to make their life better\nthey don't come talk to us to because\nthey like who we are and they want to\nexperience moments with us they come to\nus because they have the idea that when\nwe're in their lives we're going to make\neverything better\ni actually think that in a lot of the\nsituations that i've been i was actually\nlike\nclose enough or had close enough often\nlike friendship with them already\nbecause i just like\ni mean when you're friends with someone\nonline you can spend like hours talking\nand i\ni would say that you like when you get\nto know people online you get to know\nthem better than if you would meet them\nin real life but um so i would actually\nsay that they were there because they\nlike liked who i was\nyeah and they sort of understood that um\nbut they were just like confused about\nlike\nthemselves because i think that it's\nmore of like the idea that a girlfriend\nwill just solve everything and then also\num\nlike it's a distraction almost like\nhaving a girlfriend\nlike it's a nice addition like it's a\npast time\nkind of like a new car new car it's like\ni feel like it's a common issue amongst\nlike\neveryone like guys and girls it's just\nthe idea of when you are talking to\nsomeone\nand i do this stuff like in my past as\nwell like where i'm talking and i'm only\nthinking\nfrom my own perspective right like this\nconversation's benefiting me i'm like\nopening it up\net cetera and i feel like it took years\nand a lot of situations for me to\nrealize that sometimes like\ni am overstepping my boundaries like\nthis person's going through a lot x y\nand z\nor i don't know what they're going\nthrough so like me doing this right now\ncould honestly be really stressful for\nthem\nso i think it's something that i\nactually check now like if i'm going\nthrough a really hard time i talk to my\nfriends i'm like hey like are you okay\nwith this and if they ever say no like\nhey sorry i'm like dealing with a lot\nbe okay with that okay if they\ni think that's the most crucial part and\nit's not something to like instantly\nlike learn\nbut try to practice that try a thing on\ntheir shoes and if they\nyou get rejection no it's okay and it's\nnot\never on them wow\nthat's i mean that's pretty\nintrospective of you recently really\nthink about you know that sometimes the\nthe roles can be reversed and maybe\nyou're burdening someone\ninappropriately have you guys run across\nissues\neither in your own life or like kind of\npeople that you know in terms of\nwomen taking men up on their offers\nof you know paying rent and and things\nlike that\nand like i mean is the reverse also true\nhave you guys seen that\nlike where women are not respecting\nmen's boundaries obviously\nyeah a hundred percent mm-hmm i mean a\ncommon one\nis uh i these days a lot more women pay\nfor themselves but i do have friends and\ni love to death but they do have the\nopinion of like men should pay for them\nfor example\nand then i've been a situation my guy\nfriends was just like that's not fair\nlike i'm at dinner and then they are\npushing this expectation over me and\ncrossing that boundary where sometimes\nthey're like i never bring my wallet\nbecause i thought this was expected of\nyou\nand so that's something like on the\nreverse side that i think is completely\nunfair that\nis more common with females than guys\nthat occur\nand that's that's a friendship or a\nromantic\nuh usually romantic for those\nyeah other situations does that resonate\nwith anyone else\nyeah i mean i was in a a six-year\nrelationship\nwhere um it started off with me\num compromise or not compromising um\n[Music]\nuh or i guess what i'm trying to say is\ni\ndidn't allow myself to have boundaries\nin the relationship so\ni felt like i was catering to this\nperson and making sure that they were\nhappy\nand giving them everything that they\nneeded um so\neventually i started to feel exhausted\nkind of like what champ was talking\nabout\nin her relationship and that led to a\nlot of\nresentment later on and so when i did\nfinally\nfind my voice um it almost felt like it\nwas too late\nand um um that person didn't respect\nwhat i was trying to say\nand what i needed and so it just kind of\nbecame a really toxic situation where we\nwere both\num crossing boundaries and we never\nreally had a chance to\nfix that so it just um it made things\nvery toxic\nbetween the two of us so i can i can\nhonestly speak for both sides when i say\nthat\num it's not good to\ngive in to um i guess the pressure\nto like um i guess be there for a person\nand meet their expectations if you feel\nlike it's hurting you\nor affecting you because later on it's\njust gonna lead to a lot of\nanger and frustration and um\nyou know sometimes it just feels like\nit's it's too late to even salvage\nthe relationship or the friendship at\nthat point because there are no\nboundaries\nit's just like anything goes at that\npoint\nit sounds exhausting to try to be\nsomeone that you're not\nyou know sounds tough um\nanything else that like people i i know\nwe've been been kind of bouncing around\na lot does anybody want to share\nanything that they kind of haven't\nhad a chance to yet otherwise i've got a\ncouple other questions or\nmaybe some direction but does anybody\nfeel like they wanted to share something\nand didn't get a chance because we moved\ntoo quickly or\nso overall i just want to say and we're\nnot done\nquite yet or anything but i just want to\nsay like i think it's really really\nuseful to hear\nespecially when i sort of challenge or\nplay devil's advocate\nit's really useful i think for me to\nhear y'all's perspective when i do\nchallenge something\num and and for i think it's it's really\nuncovered a lot i hope that people who\nare watching\ncan get a sense of what your internal\nenvironment\nis when they interact with you in this\nway\nbecause what i'm hearing is a complete\nabsence\nof appreciation that you have an\ninternal environment\nright that like you or a person with\nthoughts and feelings and needs\nand that you are not this thing that\nthey think you are\ni think that's a broader question is to\nlike why they form these opinions or\nwhere these beliefs come from\nin the case of the 50 year old professor\nit sort of makes sense because it's like\nhe's 50 and maybe he believes certain\nthings and\nwas conditioned a certain way and\nhonestly i wouldn't be surprised if when\nhe was 20 that kind of behavior was more\nacceptable\nright so like if you look at people who\nare boomers\nlike disrespect\nfor various reasons including your age\nor your gender\nor whatever your race was like more\nacceptable 50 years ago than it is today\num a couple of other things that i kind\nof was was curious\nand so i think it's like worthwhile i'm\ncurious about where these impressions\nfrom people come from\ni also wonder a lot about like i get the\nsense that a lot of people that you guys\ntalk to are really\nstarved and hungry for something that\nthey don't get anywhere else\nand it's been my observation that like\nwhen you treat them like humans\nthey confuse that because that's also\nsome of the way that we're conditioned\nas men\nthat we don't disclose really personal\nthoughts or feelings unless it's\nromantic\nthat talking so weird what's weird about\nthat\ni don't know like i wouldn't have any\nproblem talking to friends about that\nlike i wouldn't\ni wouldn't think it was anything more\nthan friends if i like went to someone\nfor advice or to talk about something\nthat i was going through\ni like wish it was more normal you know\nlike i wish i could just have that\nconversation\nwith friends that are men without it\nbeing weird you know\num i guess they hold um speaking to\nsomeone about their problems\num more special to them than we do\nbecause we have\nno problem sometimes depends on the\nperson but speaking with a friend\nbut they associate speaking with someone\nto someone who's more special maybe\nthat's where that association comes from\nbut it that that association\nalso comes with a lot of insecurity\nbecause they are told sometimes men are\ntold like you cannot cry you cannot\nspeak about your emotions because you're\nseen as weak so when someone\ngives them the chance to be themselves\nthey might attach to you\nbecause you make them feel good but it's\njust in fact like\nthey should just be able to speak with\neveryone normally and\nhave a lot of friendly people treating\nthem like humans\nyeah and i completely agree with you\nmath and i think that actually is like\npart of the problem because\nyou know they should be able to speak to\nother people like that that way\nbut they're not and so if you're\nyeah i think if i can imagine and based\non my conversations with like gamers and\neven like in cells and stuff\nwe've been trying to get a real incel on\nstream and we haven't found one\nmostly what is the real infill i don't\nknow but like i thought it was like\nlike most of the people that we get on\nstream end up being decent human beings\nwhich is\nyou know i feel like once you have\none-on-ones with people they are\nactually decent human beings yeah but\nthen like through\ni really think so like uh but then like\nwhen there's the online persona like\nall the insult comments come in they\ndon't think before they speak but like i\nfeel like when they go on a show with\nyou dr kayla you start targeting with\nspecific questions\nand for once they're actually analyzing\nbefore they speak they're naturally and\nso\nif they put on some thoughts about it a\nlot of um\nsorry a lot of the incel um\nbehavior at least i think comes from a\nlot of bad feelings that they have\nthat they just to cope put out\ntheir hate on women but i think it just\ncomes from a lot of bad feelings and\nthat emotions that they have\non their daily lives so when you speak\nto them like face on face\ni mean i'm saying like a few of them i\ncan say it's all of them but a few of\nthem are just\nnice people who are going through a hard\ntime and not\ndoing the right things with those those\nemotions\nbefore they've had a couple of bad\nexperiences and these were enough\nto make them feel so angry at women\nyeah i i think that i'd agree i mean\nthere's a lot of understanding i i think\nyou guys are speaking\na lot of sense to me i mean that's my\nsense too is that\na lot of times what happens and if we\neven think about your experiences\nyou know when they feel rejected or hurt\nby you\noftentimes like you know hurt turns into\nanger\nand when i think about where did where's\nhatred born it's usually born from one\nof two places in my experience\none is hurt and the second is\nconditioning\nand in the case of some of these online\ncommunities like\nyou know they feel hurt and then there's\na community\nthat embraces them with open arms\nand at the same time you know kind of\nthinking about what i'm hearing from\ny'all's stories i mean i get the sense\nthat\nyou guys are providing something that's\nrare and valuable and frankly what\nsounds like it's intoxicating\nto some people and they don't really\nknow what that means because they've\nbeen taught\nthat you know when you talk about\nfeelings like people don't really listen\nto you and being listened to\nand respected and treated as a human can\nreally be confusing for them\num because they were just taught by a\ndifferent kind of playbook\nnot saying that you know it excuses\ntheir behavior but\ni can also understand um how hard it is\nto find somebody to trust\nbecause that's something that i've dealt\nwith in my life and\nso when you finally have an interaction\nwith somebody where you feel like you\ncan\nyou know really open up and be\nvulnerable it it\nchanges the dynamic of\nthe relationship or the friendship and\nsome people are able to separate\nthemselves\nand understand that it's not romantic\nbut then there are other situations\nwhere\npeople can't and they take it as okay\nthis person\nis interested in me because i can trust\nthem and they trust me and\ni can take it further because we have\nthat type of relationship\nbut it may not be the case and\nyeah go ahead math uh i also see\nsometimes when\nyou set the boundaries a lot of people\nare actually respectful like okay i'm\nsorry i didn't know this i will uh\nrespect your boundaries\ni lagged i don't know if you heard me\nyep but um\nand then the other when people don't\nreact well i think it's because they\ndon't know how to\nseparate um the rejection\nfrom their value i think they they take\nthe rejection as\nimmediately like you suck so i don't\nwant to be with you\nit could be just the thing of we're\ndifferent people we don't fit together i\ndon't think it would work out but they\ntake it to their ego\nand that's why and it hurts them that's\nwhy it comes off as anger\nsometimes yeah so i i know we're talking\na little bit about\nyou know valuing someone as a person but\nnot necessarily\nbeing on the same page about a\nrelationship that's what we call the\nfriend zone\ni know we've sort of been talking about\nthis does anybody want to share an\nactual like experience of like friend\nzoning someone and what happened\nchampion linda um yeah after that\neveryone\nokay i will start so um it's a\nuh real life experience that i had so\nlike some years ago i had\nreally like a lot of friends and most of\nthem they were men\nand um then i realized why i have so\nmany many\nmale friends um so\nthey tried to have a romantic\nrelationship with me and when\nyou know they were like clear evidence\nlike when they said it because\nback then i didn't quite understood it\nlike like\nwait what kind of evidence are they\nthere out\nlike are they out there so i thought\nlike yeah a guy just\nbeing nice to me and want to hang out\nwith me this is like\nthis is cool you know this is this is\nnot a relationship like this is not\nus trying to go to the next level this\nis just us\nappreciating each other and just hanging\nout\nso you know when they try to make a move\nlike\ntry to hold my hands or something i was\nlike wait\num this is not quite what i was going\nfor\nlike can we just like like how do you\nsay\ncan you can we just be friends right um\nso\nthey were like oh yeah sure but then\nthey ghosted on me\nwe never like hang out anymore so i lost\nlike almost 10 friends like that\nbecause after i communicated that look\nthis is the friend zone i never heard\nfor them again\nso like now this kind of stick with me\nbecause now\ni'm like scared of having like\nmale friendship like or even having like\na\nguy friend that i can be just like that\ni can just hang around with\num because i'm scared of having like\nthis confirmation of\nagain that all they wanted was just like\nme fulfilling\nlike their fantasies and not actually\nlike me\nlike appreciating my presence and just\nhang around\nso yeah this is my friend's own\nexperience\nso so let me just ask a quick question\nso\nthey ghosted you so clearly they were\nnot interested in friendship they were\nmore\ninterested in something else um\nyou know what i guess i'm sort of\nenvisioning if they had said no i'm\nactually like i do have strong feelings\nfor you and i don't think that we can be\nfriends\ni understand they didn't say that if\nthey had said that do you think that\nthat's\nokay\ni'm trying to think back like that's\nback then how i would\num yeah i don't think there's nothing\nlike wrong with them\nsaying it it's just that i can't give\nthem the answer that they want\nyup you know yeah so\nand i i'm i'm kind of noticing that like\nthis is one of those situations where\nthey may be on one page and you're on a\ndifferent page which is totally cool it\nsounds like you set a good boundary\nbut then also like maybe what would\nactually be healthier\nis if they do have feelings and it would\nbe hard for them to be friends\ninstead of ghosting you just being\ntransparent right like\nrespecting your boundary but also sort\nof\nsharing their feelings and saying\nyou know hey i don't know if i can do\nthat because i do have feelings for you\nwhat do you think about that yeah i\nwould appreciate that because it will\ngive me\nlike clarity and i don't have to guess\nit on my own\nand interpret it that oh like my\npresence\nas a female friend for male friend\nis giving hints of me wanting a\nrelationship with them\ni don't know yeah yeah i think that also\nkind of goes back to the ambiguity of\nof like you know when do you know\nwhether\nyou're hanging out or you're dating or\nwhat\nand yeah and it just kind of goes back\nto like the common theme that i'm sort\nof hearing because it's not so much\nabout\nso it sounds like it's important for you\nto set a boundary right so it's also\nmaybe important for them to try to\nsignal to you\nthat they are interested by trying to\ngrab your hand or hold your hand and\nthen you kind of say hey i'm not really\ninterested in this\nso i so far based on what you guys have\nsaid i'm sort of assuming that it's okay\nfor them to let their\nintentions be known if they do is feel a\ncertain way about you\nwe on the same page there or yes yeah as\nlong as they're like respectful\nexactly it's what you want kind of like\ni i want to know\nso i know how to like react right\nand then for you to set the boundary in\nterms of what you're comfortable with\nand then they too get to set ideally\nthey would set their own boundary in\nresponse to\nyour i mean respect yours but also are\nallowed to set their own which is that\ni'm actually not too interested in\nfriendship\nyeah that's something i feel like\nsometimes it doesn't have to be so like\nblunt or straightforward like oh i have\nfeelings for you what are we gonna do\nit could be as simple as like just\nchecking in with each other and making\nsure\nthat um what's going on is comfortable\nfor both\nparties and go from there because it can\nbe a lot of pressure to hear somebody\ntell you that they have feelings for you\nand you don't have the same feelings\nback um\nit's just it's harder to respond in that\nsituation because you don't want to\nanger them you don't want to make them\nfeel like\nbad for being vulnerable so i think just\ncheck-ins are nice\nyeah i think even like if it does\nprogress to a relationship\ncheck-ins are nice because like i was in\na relationship for like three years\nwhere there were things that i was\nuncomfortable with but it like\nfelt like it was established so early on\nthat it's like too late to set a\nboundary now\nor like if i set a boundary now would it\nbe offensive to my partner you know\nand that's like i i didn't know\nlike when i didn't set those boundaries\nearly on it was because\nthat was confrontation and i didn't want\nto be like hey you went too far this\ntime\nbut instead of having that conversation\nthen\nhe just thought he didn't go too far and\nit happened again and again and i wasn't\ncomfortable with it you know and so it's\nlike\nin hindsight i wish that i knew\num so what i'm hearing is that that\nyou know it's easier to set a boundary\nthan it is to change a boundary\nlike or set an expectation than it is to\nchange an expectation\nand i actually hear a common theme that\njust in terms of y'all's relationships\num you know i don't know how old many of\ny'all are but i'm\nin my mind you're young none of y'all\nare boomers\nand so you know i think it's normal to\nnot know\nsome of the things that you guys know\nnow right like we we've heard\nyou know champ leveled up like all of\nyou all have leveled up and that's what\nhappens when you're in a relationship\nfor three years four years six years\nthat you level up and you learn and that\nsometimes you have to kind of adjust\nexpectations you have your own\ninsecurities you're trying to be this\nperson that the other\nbecause you care about you want a\nrelationship so you're willing to\ncompromise certain things and that's\nactually pretty normal\nin relationships by the way and that\nhealthy relationships are not the ones\nthat\nstart one way and stay that way but that\nexpectations and relationships\nchange over time and that\nin my experience healthy relationships\nare the ones that are not the same as\nwhen they started\nand it involves changing your\nexpectations\nsetting new expectations hey it was\ngreat that you played video games for 15\nhours a day when we were 19\nbut now that we're 28 and we have three\nkids\ni know it sounds like a joke but it's\nactually kind of sad man\n[Music]\num and what alyssa was kind of saying\nabout sort of feeling things out and\nchecking in with people like actually\nreminds me of what risa said in the\nfirst five minutes\nwhich is if you don't know ask\nright i can imagine that champ's\nsituation would have been like\nsmoother if people had sort of let her\nknow ahead of time or even that\nif you would let them know that hey just\nchecking in like\nhow do you see our relationship\num yeah so\nso any i think someone else had a story\nabout the friendzone linda\noh yeah i've i just want to say\nsomething before it's something that is\nlike sort of interesting to me is that\num i every time\ni meet new people or i engage in a new\ncommunity\ni like sort of make it very clear\num that i'm not interested in starting a\nrelationship\nhere like and and the thing is like even\nthough people know they will still\num develop those feelings for me or\nstill\ntry to make a move whatever um but then\nokay so it's it's probably one of my\nfavorite or not favorite friend zone\nstories but my best friend\nactually confessed to me um like\na year ago when we barely met we we'd\nmet each other for like\ntwo weeks three weeks um and he said\nthat he thought that he had feelings for\nme even though he knew that i wasn't\ninterested in anything\nand stuff like that um\nbut out of that confession a sort of\nlike openness in our relationship\ndeveloped where\nwhere he realized that i was just\naccepting and i was like okay with him\ntelling me these things\num and we sort of like talked about it\nand stuff like that and he realized that\num he didn't like actually fall in love\nwith me or whatever and now we're like\nhe he is definitely the person that i'm\nclosest to in my my life\num and i'm like super happy that i have\nhim and i know he's also watching so\nso i'm gonna troll you a little bit so\nit sounds like he's playing the long\ngame\n[Laughter]\nthe thing okay so he he recently moved\nto the same city as me\num and and i thought especially in the\nbeginning when we like met up and stuff\ni was like a little bit skeptical i was\nlike wait\nso so i picked this up i picked i picked\nthe discussion up again and i was like\njust making sure and stuff\nbut that just like again cleared things\nup and it was nice\nlike okay so linda pardon me for being\nskeptical\nbut i don't really know your situation\ni'm gonna actually ask\nyour colleagues what do you guys think\nabout the situation because like they're\nthe experts right\ni'd be curious if in like a year it's\nstill you're just pals living in the\nsame city\noh really i say good for her i like\nthink that's yeah which is great\ni think he he understood that he had a\ndeep friendship with her in connection\nand in the beginning he might have\nconfused it with love but i think\nonce like he understood okay so i can\nhave a really good friend that i can\ntalk to and she can\ncan not be my girlfriend she could just\nbe my friend and that's okay\nlike so yeah yeah if anything it shows\ngrowth on his part because he was able\nto\nexpress how he felt and understand what\nyour\nfriendship meant to him and whether or\nnot it was important to keep going or to\nsay okay this is not going to work out\none thing is you know i actually hate\nthe term friend zone\nso i think it's a really fun meme term\nto use like i love it which has to only\nsee something else you're like oh you've\nbeen friend zoned it's funny\num but in terms of like real life if a\nguy or a girl and bisexual by the way\ntells me that like hey like you're a\ngood friend of mine\nfirst insane it's like cool they're a\nfriend too let me see them in a friend's\nlike\nview and even if i did initially find\nthem attractive in a relationship sense\nthat's fine it's just simply change that\nkind of mentality like all right\nthey told me that they see me as a\nfriend i see them as a friend too great\ni'm not like oh no i've been in the\nfriend zone now like that's not my first\nreaction and i think that people who\nhave that first reaction whenever a girl\nor a guy\ntells you that they see you as a friend\nand you're like oh wow\ni've been zoned i think that's\nactually a really bad mentality to have\nyeah i think a counterpoint is like\nyou've been girlfriend zoned\nright yeah right because that's what\nhappens to you guys you guys get\ngirlfriend-zoned\nfrom the get-go oh you listened to me\nfor five minutes about how i lost this\ngame in league of legends\nand you were sympathetic girlfriend's\nown time\nto be honest it isn't even that it's not\na lot of the time\ni think guys don't even confess in the\nhopes of have of like getting with us\nfor me at least like because because i\nalways make sure that people know that\nnothing's going to happen they know they\njust want to get it off their chest\num but the the problem that i\nmainly have with this is like how much\nit happens and the frequency of it\nsure like i would almost say\nlike maybe every fifth to seventh person\nthat i become friends with online\nis like at some point um tells me\nthey're attracted to me\nand because of that it's just like you\nlose a very big amount of friends and it\nalso puts you\nsometimes at a like awkward spot in a\ncommunity\num yeah sounds hard so it kind of puts\nyou out like\nit just yeah i'm i'm gonna just\nchallenge again\nbecause i i sort of heard a lot so linda\nsaid\nhey this happened he moved to the same\ncity i was kind of joking a little bit\nand and i i do think that you know it\nsounds like the majority opinion\nis that this is a sign of growth and\nit's like healthy and i think everything\nyou guys said makes a lot of sense in\nterms of\nsometimes it's important to just get\nthose feelings off of your chest have a\nmature conversation and that's how the\nfriendship moves forward\nat the same time star was a little bit\ncurious\nright i'm just like actually just\ncurious because that seems like a big\nstep\ni can't think of any friends that i\nwould make that step for\nbut that's just me personally like i'm\nnot saying one way or another\ni i think if we think a little bit about\nwhy we're talking today\ni think actually the way to be the most\nsupportive is to not\nnecessarily just agree with people what\npeople are saying\neven though i don't think you guys are\njust agreeing with linda i think\neveryone brings up good points\nsounds like linda's very good at setting\nboundaries early on\nand that she's good at like managing\nthings and that they are genuinely very\ngood friends\nand at the same time i also think what\nstar says you know like\nsomething flipped in my mind because\njust like she said\ni don't know or let me be\nclear i have never well\nmaybe even that that's a not a good i\nwas about to say i've never moved cities\nfor a friend\nbut that also assumes for a moment that\nhe moved for her which is like probably\nnot a fair assumption\nright it just happened he wanted to move\nout of his country in the first place\nsorry yeah and and so it sort of makes\nsense to move to a place if you're\nplanning on moving to like move to a\nplace where you have\nsome kind of connection in some kind of\nroots\nbut i also do know people that have\nplayed the long game\nand and so just something to think about\nyou know it does sound like it's\nshe set a firm boundary and there are\ngood reasons to move and and things like\nthat\nlinda am i making you feel uncomfortable\nyou look good no okay\nsorry yeah good and i i think what\neveryone else said too but i'm also\ncurious and i i wonder what will happen\nin the year\ni hope it's not being an [ __ ] to say\nthat no no no no no not at all\ni mean it's as i said yeah yeah because\ni i think\nfrankly part of what i where this is\ncoming from is that\ni also know that some people\nwill do their best to try to be friends\nand that over time those kinds of\nfeelings can re-emerge\nor as he sort of figured things out and\nthen\nyou know as as time goes on you can\nfigure out oh i actually like do have\nfeelings right\njust like relationships change and\nevolve and you guys have conversations\nit's possible i can imagine if you take\na hundred people\nin linda's scenario some of those\nconversations will probably end up being\noh i actually do have feelings for you\ny'all is that fair risa you wanted to\nsay something yeah so i just want to say\nthat has happened to me where i friend\nzoned someone and then we actually dated\nlike\na year later and the concept was that\nthough\ni'm so sorry i'm so sorry about this\ni'll make a proper point about this okay\nso do you realize how many women you\njust screwed with that statement because\nnow\nbut i will make it clear though\nlet me finish\nlike the thing is is that he was not\ncontinuously hitting on me\nlike after i made it clear he became a\ngood friend like honest to god\nnever was just like hey you're cute\ntoday or like hey\nlike we should do this together it was a\nvery respectful relationship and then\nthings just ended up that way because\neventually i\ncaught feelings and then i reached out\nto him\nabout it not the other way around with\nhim forcing it\non me so much hope to the internet reset\ni would definitely rare completely it's\na rare case it's a rare case for sure\nlike i'm so sorry if i screwed people no\nit's true though\nit's true because i wanted to say like\nrelationships do change but the idea is\nthat you're not forceful about it\nright like so even though you are\nyeah like if you're a friend your friend\nact like a friend that's what my ex did\nright and then uh things just happened\nwith that one and it was a rare case\nbut in general this is not like the long\ntime when you get friend zone and you're\nlike all right\nlet me figure out what is the plan of\nhow i can still hit on her and get each\nother\npoints and he did not have that\nexpectation if anything like it just was\nout of nowhere that i confessed to him\nso i mean the key is just like being\nopen with your communication especially\nin these like situations and it's also\nlike\ni have that with my best friend that\nwhen he confessed to me\nit was like when he caught feelings i\nhad feelings for someone else and i was\ntalking to him about those feelings and\nthen like\na little while after that he was like\nthe way that you felt about that guy was\nexactly how i felt about you\num but like that sort of established\nsuch a like\nclose trust factor that even if he now\ncaught feelings for me i would trust him\nto\nsay it again and if i developed him i i\nwould like be open about it and be able\nto talk about it to him as well\num so i think that's why i trust him in\nthat way by the way\nto also save the conversation slightly\njust because i know that lineman is\nscrewed there are people that has\nconfessed to me that i will cut out of\nmy life instantly because\nand continue to try to flirt and etc and\nthat's not proper friendship for me\nso i would be like hey i just goodbye no\nbut i mean i i think it is common right\nso i think part of the reason that\nthat some people stay in the friend zone\nis because i have heard a lot of\nsituations\nwhere um until my wife explained to me\nthat this wasn't true\ni thought we were friends first right\nand\nthat's not unreasonable right that like\nyou can be friends with someone because\nwhat we're talking about is people\ngrow and change over time and so like if\nsomeone is in your life and they grow\nand change as a person and you grow and\nchange as a person\nthe nature of a healthy relationship is\none that changes over time and sometimes\nthat can start as a friendship\nand end up as a romance or bizarrely\ni've also worked with people who are\nlike\nyou know divorced and are on amicable\nterms and realize\noh actually like we make awesome friends\nand we were just confused and we should\nhave never been in a romantic\nrelationship\neven gotten married and that's true too\nright so i was kind of trolling you but\ni i do think that\nyou know i can understand why some\npeople hope\nor i can understand why some people\nwould stay in the friend zone\nwith their fingers crossed and what i'm\nhearing from you guys is what makes that\nokay or not okay is the openness\nand the trust with which you do that\nright it's like in the back of your mind\nif you're like waiting for her to fall\nin love with you\nthat just sounds unfair toxic and\nfrankly unhealthy in your life\nand at the same time if you can value\nanother human being and set aside\nromantic feelings\nand at the sa you know things change\nover time then like so\nbe it\nyeah because i think there are men that\nare pretty good about\nhiding their feelings but we're very\ngood at one or another\nyeah i think i'm actually i'm actually\ndeeply in love with one of you right now\ncan you guess who\nthat was a joke maybe\ni think like if you have this hope\nthat you might um be able to get into a\nrelationship with somebody\num it'll show and it will make things\nuncomfortable\nso it's not like you can just play the\nlong game and\nnever show it i think sooner or later\nthe other person is going to feel that\nsomething's\ngoing on or something's happening\nabsolutely right i think it does blend\nin and you guys can tell\nright that's what i'm hearing from\nmelissa\nhow do you know yeah oh it's just\ni've been in situations too where it's\njust like you trust them as a friend and\nthen\nit's just like a parties when alcohol is\ninvolved people take advantage and\nthat's not okay\nand it's just the idea that if you're a\ntruly good friend if you see a drunk\nfriend like that or such a your first\ninstinct should be to just help them\nnot like this is the girl that i have\nhad a crush on i've been playing this\nlong con\nlet me think of the intuition like that\ni just want to put that out there that\nis just\nnever ever okay and so even if you do\nstill have a crush on someone\nplease just if they tell you that they\nsee you as a friend and\nvice versa like just keep with that\nmentality\nand if things happen sure but yeah be a\nfriend first\njust wanted to put that out there yeah\nso i i think you guys are kind of\ntransitioning to something which i've\nbeen sort of thinking a lot about which\nis like\ni'm almost hearing a playbook come out\nof this\nin terms of y'all are sharing a lot of\nimportant stuff from your perspective\nabout what's acceptable behavior and\nwhat's not acceptable behavior\nand i wonder if actually you know we\nwere talking a little bit about\nrepercussions versus education\ni wonder how do you guys feel about like\ncan we just go from start to finish\nabout you know how what's an appropriate\nway to interact with women whether it be\non or not i mean people\num but i'm sort of thinking a little bit\nabout you know this group of people who\nlike\napproaches you guys online it sounds\nlike it's relatively frequent\nright up to like 20 of people in linda's\ncase\num and and to kind of think a little bit\ni mean it doesn't sound\nunreasonable to me it's probably true\nfor all of you guys but um\nand for us to like think a little bit\nabout you know how should they speak\nwhat should they say when should they\nsay it how should they respond to what\nyou say\num and like how can we sort of like\nmaybe actually concretely educate people\nabout like how to deal with women how to\ndeal with romantic feelings\nhow do we know when we're friends versus\nflirting like\nyou know what happens because sometimes\npeople flirt with their friends\nright and and so how do you navigate\nthat like what do you guys think are\nthere kind of take-home points that we\ncan kind of\nput together from our conversation today\ni think i guess go ahead oh no\ni guess if i had like one point it would\nbe\nlike asking if something you did was\nokay\nafter the fact in like as neutral a way\npossible like hey\njust wanted to make sure like i made\nthis joke just wanted to make sure you\nknow it was just a joke and it didn't\nmake you uncomfortable\nlike there are friends that i've had and\neven like relationships that i've been\nin where if someone had said like\nhey i just want to double check that\nyou're okay with this like that would\nhave meant so much to me and like could\nhave opened\na conversation if i wasn't okay with it\nversus like\noh is it worth starting a fight by\nbringing this up and like putting me in\na situation where\ni have to like you know like confront\nthem\nto have that conversation and i know\nthat's like hard like i don't normally\ndo it in my relationships but i'm trying\nto now and i think it'd be\nlike really good for most friend groups\nif\nthat was a conversation everyone was\nwilling to have\nso what i'm hearing from you just i want\nto recap each point as we go through it\nis that okay\nguys okay so what i'm hearing is like\nsometimes in the past\nyou're gonna feel like avoiding a\nconversation\nbecause of the conversation could be\ndifficult\nor could cause waves but really when we\nthink about healthy relationships they\ninvolve having difficult conversations\nexactly\nrisa champ sure so in addition to that i\njust want to say try to do it beforehand\nthis one's a lot harder to do\nbut if there are something you are\nuncertain like for example if i am\nsomeone made a lot of provocative jokes\nfirst thing i would do before this call\nis ask these ladies like hey like\ni make these provocative jokes i\nactually asked them about my cursing is\ncursing okay\nlike just because i do curse on a normal\nbasis and just to make sure of that on\njust little things that you know from\nhistory but then my most important point\nthough is to observe\nobserving is a skill set that takes a\nwhile to build but try to when you do\nsomething\nlook at the person's reaction or if\nyou're sending messages even you can't\nsee reactions\nif you send 50 messages and this person\nreplies with k\nor like not much response chances are\nyou're not very close to the person\nokay or you can just be like hey like\nare you going through something awful if\nyou guys are a really close\nfriendship just check in gauge reactions\nand then respond accordingly through\nthat so\nlet me ask actually quick follow-up so\nthat was really useful risa because you\nsaid\nif someone's sends 50 messages and they\nrespond with hey\nwhat i'm getting the sense of is\nespecially a lot of people don't know\nhow to interpret\ncommunications online and especially\nthat sometimes it sounds like you guys\nare trying to be like\ntactful and not mean\nand that there's ambiguity like so you\nguys have a choice between\non a scale of like zero or like on two\nends of the spectrum one is like being\nnice and being mean\nand you're trying to set a boundary and\ni i thought maybe i heard alyssa say\nthat\nwhat she's had to learn how to do is to\nbe mean\nbecause sometimes when she i i may have\nit may have been someone else but that\nsometimes when you guys are trying to\nlike let people down gently\nor like not hurt their feelings or you\nknow you know\nnot like you recognize it could be\ninsecure and so you try to be nice\nso what are some signs that you're like\nnot interested in someone\nin that way like what i also i guess i\nwant to clarify that\num i haven't been\nmean in the way that like i was cussing\nat somebody or saying like\nthings that were hurtful it's more so i\nhad the\nmentality that maybe i might have to be\na little bit more aggressive\nand um i think what i do more now is\ni'll just ignore it yeah\nfirm i'll just ignore it or i will send\na message that's really short and um\ni guess to try to let them know i'm not\ninterested anymore instead of\nhaving that conversation because i don't\nalways feel the need to talk about\nyou know boundaries with a stranger or\nyou know to\nsort of like open the floor up for that\nbecause\nat the end of the day i don't really\nknow you so i don't owe you any\nexplanation as to why i'm rejecting you\nor why i'm not responding\nand i think that's what's important for\nme is being respected\nas a person and as a woman to just be\nable to say no and\nhave that be enough for me so\nyeah so what i'm hearing alyssa says\nthat you should\nyou know just because someone says no\ndoesn't mean that you deserve an\nexplanation\neven if you want one so that's kind of\nan important take-home point\num math yeah i was answering\nto the what are some signs a woman is\nnot interested\num you usually have to start\nconversations or you start the action of\ninteraction between both of you\nif in those actions she's not very\ninteractive as well like the\nthe spamming and the k and the third one\nsometimes if they just say i don't want\nto speak with you i think that's a\npretty\nbig sign and yeah is that they don't\nunderstand that\nsome stuff yeah most i'm not\nlike sometimes most of the times they\nare they kind of back away but\nsometimes they don't like i had one\nsevere case\nwhere this guy he spammed me on discord\nand then i'm like okay easy thing to do\ni'm just gonna block him on discord then\nhe found a way\nto message me on another platform he\nmessaged me on facebook spammed me on\nfacebook blocked him on facebook i\nthought i was done\nthen then he spammed me on steam\nblocked him on steam then he messaged\nlike somehow he got my number\nthen he messaged me on whatsapp had to\nblock him on whatsapp\nfour platforms already and then\nhe used another person's account to\ncontact me and i'm like\nwhat should i do i can't only react\nyou know like with the block\nbecause i i i when he was spamming i\nsaid stop\nstop please stop and then i had to send\nit to him on facebook that\nand then block him then on steam please\nstop this is not gonna\ni'm not gonna read those messages\nyeah i would say\ngo to the police but i've i've had\nstories where the police haven't been so\nnice\nso i don't know\nyeah i met a guy at a dog park\nand um i gave him my number just because\ni was being nice\nand he ended up finding me on instagram\nfinding me on snapchat\nadding me everywhere and um at first the\nconversation was pretty\ncasual but it turned into him messaging\nme every morning\nevery afternoon like pretty much any\ntime he could it seemed like\nand it got to the point where i told him\nlike hey i'm not interested i don't want\nto\ntalk to you anymore and um he got mad at\nme\none time and kept messaging me um and\nanother time i had blocked him on\neverything and i guess he found my\nwhatsapp somehow\nand he started um acting like nothing\nhad happened basically and was like hey\nhow are you doing what's going on\ni was like i thought i told you you know\nwe're not talking i'm not interested\nand then he called me a bunch of really\nterrible words and\num i decided to just you know leave it\nthere and block him i didn't even\nrespond to the things that he was saying\nbecause they were so\nterrible\ni think one final advice that i could\ngive\nis that do it this is something i do\nit's like a final message\nbasically if i don't know this person\nlikes me or like\nmaybe i'm getting mixed signals and\nstuff like that i will send one message\nthat's just like\nhey like i'm sorry if i'm disturbing\nbecause i sent like this is my third\nmessage to them or something like that\num just when i know my doors are open if\nyou ever want to talk\nand if i ever bought you anyways i\napologize and i just kind of leave it at\nthat\nif at least for me when i see a message\nlike that if i truly\nlike the person and i see them as close\nor a friend i will 100 reach out to\nclear out that misunderstanding\nbut if i don't like you or then i would\njust leave it ignored\nand i for me at least i like the final\nmessage policy send one last one make\nyour points clear\nand give them an out yeah give them a\nnow if they want to respond they will\nif not you leave it at that what does\nthat mean star give them an\nout so like give them an opportunity\nto end things there like like oh like no\nworries if you're not interested but if\nyou are\nblah blah and then if they're not\ninterested they can just leave it at\nthat without any hard feelings because\nyou've said no worries\nokay so anything else that people want\nto add in terms of\nyou know what yeah we'll do champ and\nthen linda\nokay so um when you when you see\nsomeone communicating their boundaries\nplease respect them\ndon't deflate them don't try to put them\non your standard like oh i'm actually\nokay with that why is that person not\nokay with doing that that is not normal\nso i can like no like these are two\ndifferent boundaries like\nyour boundary doesn't have to be the\nother person's boundary\nand there's no likes over like an\nuniversal like standard that can be\napplied for anyone like\nuh we are all individuals and we have\ndifferent boundaries\nand we should respect them especially\nlike\nfor me like boundaries is first you\ncommunicate\nthen you can respect the boundaries\nright because you have like legit no\nevidence what this\nperson is okay with because i sometimes\nalso had like interactions where i\ncrossed someone's boundaries and i was\nlike oh wait\nlike how did this happen right like i\nthought this was perfectly fine\num but when this other person like\ncommunicates their boundaries\njust don't be like oh yeah like\nthis is you acting weird this is norm\nnot normal\nyou know don't deflate them those things\nbecause i heard also from\num other girls that um they got like\ntheir boundaries got\nalso deflated from like close friends\nand families which i think\nit's not great and if you want to have\nlike a\nsafe place you sh this is this should be\nlike a criteria where people can like\ncommunicate their boundaries\nand that you know that those people will\nrespect those\nfantastic linda\noh um yeah i'm okay\nso for me it's like when i guess the\nadvice\nthat i wish a couple of people would\nlike think about is that\nwhen you feel like you're in love with\nsomeone maybe ask yourself if you're\nlike in love with\nthe idea and not the actual girl and\nlike\nmaybe maybe think about like how your\nrelationship would work because like\ni know for myself that i'm like a sort\nof really confident person\nand i know that just with the amount of\nlike people that don't have\nthat confidence there would be like a\nsort of power dynamic between us if\nanything great to happen\njust thinking about it it would just\nlike wouldn't work because we're like\nnot compatible i guess um\nso just like think about\nwhat like this does this even make like\nany sense\nsure so let me let me hear yeah\ngo ahead i also have something to add um\nnowadays people are more open to speak\nabout these\nissues but what i feel like what happens\nafter is that\nis that the idea of that if you if you\ndo this if you do the right thing\nyou're better than other people no it's\njust a normal thing that should be\nrespected in\nthe first place you should not feel more\nspecial because you respect women or\nrespect their boundaries is a thing that\nshould exist\nalready math i'm a bit confused and\nand maybe you'll help me out you're\ntelling me that if i don't respect\nyour if i you're telling me that if i do\na good job of respecting your boundaries\nand treat you like a human i'm not\nentitled to date you no no\nyou're talking about nice guys right now\nno what\n[Music]\ni'm confused but i i did everything that\nyou guys said why\naren't you yeah but sometimes this is\nthe thing like we just don't click\nyou're respectful thank you very much\nfor being respectful but sometimes this\njust doesn't work out\nand what i've yeah basically i thought\nwas dr hey i think he'd be a great\nfriend\nbut i thought that being the great\nfriend is the way that i become your\nboyfriend that's what reese said\ni'm just at the boy to the friend and\nthen you become the boyfriend\nyeah right\nso like i think i think maybe what was\nmissing is that like you guys didn't\nunderstand what my gender was so i can\nsend you a particular picture proving it\nand isn't that\nisn't that what i'm supposed to do oh\nthank you\nyeah so so it's what i'm hearing from\nmath in all seriousness and you guys\nhave to let me know if i overstep\nokay so you know all right\nuh but that's funny so but i i think\nwhat i'm really hearing is that like\nyou know basic respect and talking about\nboundaries and treating someone like a\nhuman being\nis what is just like that's just being\nhuman it's not\nlike making you boyfriend material like\nsure a boyfriend should do all those\nthings\nyes but it's not sufficient\nto enter a romantic relationship and\nthat what we're talking about here is a\nplaybook of interaction\nnot a playbook to like get a girlfriend\nexactly although i do think i do think\nit is\nnecessary although not sufficient to to\nbe\nboyfriend material to like treat someone\nlike a human it's the base\nyeah it's a business okay so let me see\nif i can recap\nall right so the first thing is that you\nknow like when you interact with people\nonline the first thing to understand is\nthat you are a stranger\nand they are a stranger if you talk to\nsomeone for five minutes you guys\nare not even friends y'all are strangers\nalso that like certain things while they\nmay\nbe on the path to boyfriend don't\nnecessarily\nmean that they're on the path to\nboyfriend like if alyssa meets you at a\ndark part and gives you her number\nit does not necessarily mean that she's\nromantically interested in you\nright that there are lots of gestures\nlike maybe a a good thing to do would be\nto like\nyou know reverse the person's gender to\nlike\nsomething else in your mind like if i\nmet a dude at a boy at a\ndog park and i'm a heterosexual male and\ni'm gonna assume that he's a\nheterosexual male and we exchange phone\nnumbers\nthat's fine right that like just because\nsomeone is a man or a woman doesn't\nnecessarily indicate romantic interest\nso the first thing is that when you\ninteract with a woman online that\nthey're like\ny'all are still strangers and you guys\ncan maybe get to know each other a\nlittle bit\num if someone does respond to you if\nyou're interacting with a woman\num that you know it's fine to interact\nand for you guys to connect but that\nactually like unless there's something\nlike flirtation going on\nthat the presumption is that you guys\nare friends\nand that if you're interested in being\nmore than friends you should signal that\nin some way and probably do that\nearly before you invest a lot of the\ninto the relationship\nand that because the further i one thing\nthat i've noticed is that you know when\npeople invest a lot in the relationship\nthey expect a lot out of the\nrelationship\nright i've done so many things for you\nwhy won't you date me and that's why\nthey feel kind of like\nlet down because they've given a lot oh\nyeah i like moved across the world for\nyou\nand i'm paying your rent and like we're\ngreat friends but like why won't you\nlove me\nand and from y'all's perspective i would\nreally think it's\nit's like healthy if someone does seem\nto be investing a lot in\ninto the relationship that that you\nreally kind of stop and think about like\nyou know what is the assumption here\neven though you think you guys are\nfriends\nthat that you know boundary setting\nconversation or like trying to figure\nout what your relationship is\nactually goes two ways and i think a lot\nabout what star said and that sometimes\nas human beings we like to avoid\ndifficult conversations\nbut that it may actually hurt more in\nthe long run to avoid those difficult\nconversations\nso probably relatively early on you\ndon't have to be like\nyou know overly expressive or\nor go too far but probably men who are\ninterested in you and once again i'm\nassuming a heteronormative standpoint\nshould indicate to you somewhat early on\nbut not too early on right like not\nafter five minutes of dms\nbut they should try to get to know you\nas a person move past a stranger point\nand then i think someone i forgot\nexactly who said this but maybe it was\nlinda who was kind of saying that like\nif you feel like you're in love with\nsomeone like ask yourself what are you\nin love with\nbecause what do you actually know about\nthis person\nand so far all you know is that they\nwarded well when you were playing league\nof legends and like wow\nthat's amazing right\nending all of my standards yeah and and\nso\nso to really think about okay what do\nyou know about this person as you guys\nstart to interact a couple of warning\nsigns one is like an\nuneven communication and oddly enough i\nknow this is going to be kind of a weird\nanalogy i don't know if any of y'all\nplay tennis\nbut you know with with tennis i\nsometimes think about there's a ball and\nthen you hit the ball from one side to\nthe other side\nand then the ball has to get hit back\nbefore you hit it again\nso it goes back and forth and sometimes\nwhat i'm getting the sense of is people\nthat you interact with on\non discord or through dms or like those\ntennis ball machines you guys know those\nmachines\nwhere it's just like they're just\nshooting bubble after ball after ball\nso ask yourself am i playing a game of\ntennis with this person\nor am i a tennis ball machine blocked me\non instagram\nchallenge accepted i'm gonna find your\nyour phone number block me on whatsapp\nchallenge accepted i'm gonna find out\nwhere you live\nso don't be a tennis ball machine\nright and and so to try to reciprocate\nthe level of interaction and this is\nwhere what risa says i think is really\nimportant\nobserve which i really just am shocked\nby\nthe lack of observation i don't know how\nyou can expect people to observe if\nthey're like you're blocking them on\nmultiple platforms\nand they're hunting you down on others\nlike you know observation\nthat just sounds so on a different level\ni don't even know\nwhere to start there um and i think part\nof\nyou know i think i feel like ultimately\nwhat we're having is half of the\nconversation and what we need to do is\ntalk to the tennis ball machines talk to\nthe people who have been friend zoned\nand get their perspective\nbecause i i do sort of think like i can\nsort of understand that if i\nyou know meet a cute girl at the dog\npark and she gives me her number\nlike hey can i call you sometime um and\ni can understand how there's ambiguity\nthere so there's also like that's why\nand it's not that you guys should and we\nsort of acknowledge this at the\nbeginning right it's not like you can\nsay\ni'm giving you my number but i'm not\ninterested in you romantically but i'd\nlove to hang out as friends like that\nseems like a bit much\nright so there's ambiguity at the\nbeginning and that's actually kind of\ncomforting but then as as someone\ngraduates past stranger if you find\nyourself feeling in love with them\nask yourself why and recognize that\nthat's probably not\num appropriate full disclosure though i\nfell in love with my wife the first time\ni saw her\nand you know i just don't\nso i struggle sometimes with that and\nthen everyone doesn't say like\nreese is like oh no one says [ __ ]\ncreep right\nbut that's like that's how we treat the\npeople who fall in love with us\nit could have been right so that's like\nthere's something more here\nlike i absolutely just you know i saw\nher like i remember i like\nliterally remember the first time i saw\nher and it like it like it was like i\ngot\nhit in the chest with something and then\nfor years i didn't even understand what\nthat what the [ __ ] that was\num but so i was playing long game too uh\ni would love a room half and half by the\nway where like guys can talk about like\nthings that we might be doing that are\nmisleading them and yeah because\nmy point of view and they can explain\ntheir side as well so i would love that\ninteraction\ncool yeah i think that's a great idea\nrecently um\nso then to think a little bit about you\nknow reciprocating in terms of\nconversations and a couple of\nyou know things to watch out for because\nrece i don't think observe is enough i\nthink people need more direction than\nthat\num so you know first of all obviously if\nsomeone is well\ni guess not obviously if someone is\nblocking you on a platform\ndon't assume it's a mistake within this\nclip\nright so so if someone is trying to set\na boundary respect that boundary\nand then also recognize that if someone\nsets a boundary with you and you\nfeel hurt you feeling hurt does not\nentitle you to anything from the other\nperson\nso that seems to be a big one that we\nhaven't really said explicitly\nand then also i would encourage people\nif you're expecting a lot out of the\nrelationship\nfigure out why you're expecting a lot\nout of that relationship\nand then ultimately have conversations\nwith people\nso the first conversation is like hey\nlike let's hang out and then if you have\nfeelings maybe have a conversation about\nthat\nand then you know down the road even if\nyou guys do end up as friends\nthat it's okay i think to have\nconversations\nabout developing feelings or if you guys\nare in a relationship it's okay to have\nconversations\nabout hey i actually don't feel this way\nabout you anymore\num even if it sucks even if it sucks\nright so to have a lot of hard\nconversations\num but not too early because they don't\nowe you that after five minutes of dms\nokay and and the last thing is like it's\nnot\nyour job to get on their page and it's\nalso not\ntheir job to get on your page which also\nmeans that if they girlfriend zoned\nyou and you say i'm not interested in\nthat\nthey're allowed to walk away even if it\nhurts your feelings\nand also if you friend-zoned them\nyou're allowed to walk away even if it\nhurts their feelings\nright until while there's ambiguity\nthere's going to be mixed expectations\nand like that's just why we have\nconversations\num yeah\nand then i guess kind of the last point\nthat i just want to acknowledge is that\ni think that a lot of the people that\nmaybe y'all are interacting with\nare hungry and even starved for some\namount of basic humanity\nwhich math was talking about about\nlistening to someone when they've had a\nbad day about supporting them\nemotionally and that that doesn't mean\njust because a woman\nor a man is supporting you emotionally\ndoesn't mean that they're romantically\ninterested in you\ndid i miss anything\nyou think so no that was well summarized\nactually i left one or two out\nif you are someone's professor don't\ntouch them\nif you're a policeman please do not take\nadvantage of already\ndisturbed victims thank you\nyeah true okay\nany last thoughts or questions\nthank you for having us yeah very much\nsure\nwe're a little bit over time are you\nguys okay with not meditating today or\nis that something that you guys really\nwere looking forward to\ni was actually looking forward to it\nyeah i was like\nokay let's do it\ncan i can i confess something to y'all\nby the way\nthe word confess was used a lot you guys\nnoticed that it's like\nwhat's that i'm curious about that\nbut so so part of it is that i feel like\ni owe you guys a better meditation\nthan what i can give you today so that\nwas actually part of my hesitation\nso i i do some meditations that are\nshakti oriented meditations\nshakthi is the sanskrit word for energy\num and it's also like by definition\nprinciple i mean feminine so like\nshakthi\nalso it me is literally the translated\nas energy so like\nyou know any kind of energy and it also\nis translated as goddess\nso it's kind of weird s-h-a-k-t-i\num and and the challenge is that like\njust after even after like five or ten\nminutes\nof talking to you guys i was like you\nguys should really learn to shakthi\nmeditation\nbecause i think there's just something\nabout that that's resonating with me the\nproblem is first of all i don't know\nthose meditations very well because\nthey're\nuh traditionally they're\nthey actually are taught by female\nteachers and so\npart of my hesitation to teach you guys\nthat i think you guys deserve something\nthat i don't know that i'm the best to\nteach\nso i'm going to teach you guys something\nand if you all are okay i'm going to\nthink for 60 seconds about how i can\naccess\nany kind of shakti\nbut the other thing that i ask you all\nfor is a rain check\nthat one day i'm gonna learn how to do\nthese properly and teach them over the\ninternet\nand i just don't know when that's gonna\nbe but i hope that you guys check that\nout when it happens um\nso can i think for a second of course\nfor sure thank you very much\nokay is everything okay yeah\nyeah okay okay so i'll try something\ni don't know if it's gonna work but\nwe'll try something okay\nso i want you all to sit up straight\nall our gamer posture\noh my god you're a gamer check all my\nboxes\nshe said gamer posture i'm in love\nwe have the same posture man i met this\ngirl you'll never do that\nokay you're joking but yeah\nokay so let's sit up straight so close\nyour eyes and what i want you guys to do\nactually open your eyes sorry put your\nright hand\nin your left like this right and then\nput your thumbs together\nokay okay and then\nput this in your lap\nokay and i want you guys to sit up\nstraight and i want you to close your\neyes\nand the first thing that i want you to\ndo is feel your spine\nand as you feel your spine\nnotice that it's straight keep your neck\nerect\nyou know make sure your neck is straight\nthat you're not leaning forward\nkeep your chin sort of level to the\nground\nlike parallel to the ground\nand what i want you to do is imagine\nthat the rest of your body\nare like clothes on the hanger\nof your spine so relax your shoulders\nlet your arms relax let your legs relax\nthat you have a pillar a core of\nyourself\nthat is your spine and let everything\nelse\ndrape across it\nand now what i want you to do is feel\nthe weight of your body\nfeel it resting on your spine and almost\nas if\nit's traveling through your spine into\nthe ground\nthat your spine supports who you are as\na person\nand now what i want you guys to do is\nfeel\nthe circuit of your arms\nso i want you to imagine for a moment\nthat there's\nalmost light or energy\nthat is coming in from the top of your\nhead\nand that it's kind of passing through\nyour arms and down to your palms\nand now for a moment i want you to pull\nyour thumbs apart\nand feel how unnatural that is\nand let them come back together and it's\nalmost as if there's like\na circuit that you're closing\nand with your eyes closed i want you to\neither nod or shake your head if that\nmakes any sense or not\nokay okay i see mostly nods but some\nshakes at the head which is okay\nso now what i want you to do is feel the\nwarmth\nso if you feel the closed circuit kind\nof focus on your fingertips\nor what you can do is focus on the\nsensation of your palms\nand feel the heat of your left palm\non the back of your right hand\nnow what i want you to do is focus\non your right palm and how there seems\nto be\nheat almost emanating from it or above\nit\nnot if that makes sense or shake your\nhead if you don't feel okay\nnow for a moment i'm just going to\ninvite you to look at something a little\nbit strange which is that\nit almost feels like you can feel the\nheat coming off of your hand\nwhich is weird because you can't feel\nanything off of your hand\nbut just notice that sensation and focus\non the area above the palm where you\nfeel the heat\nand now kind of notice that you have\nthis circuit this warmth\nthis energy and feel the person that you\nare there's something just\nwarm and pure untainted\nwe've been talking a lot about\nexpectations and feelings and\nfear powerlessness\nbut in this moment none of that is you\nthose things may apply to alissa\nor linda or star or resa\nor champ or math but in this moment\nthere's the pillar of your spine\nthere's the weight of all of your being\nhanging on it\nand the spine can easily handle that way\nand there is warmth and energy\nand now what i want you all to notice is\nthat there's something like\nperfect and even divine\nabout the person that you are right now\nand is it is it any surprise that people\nare drawn to you\nand that you are able to give them\nsomething wonderful\neven though it causes you problems\nand that that's okay\nthat sure we're going to do all the\nthings about setting boundaries and\nlimits and things like that\nbut at the end of the day no matter how\nthey make you feel\nor who they are you can always come back\nto this place\nthat no one can ever take this away from\nyou\nand that this thing that you can feel\nwill support you throughout your entire\nlife\nthroughout any challenges\nthrough any trials and in your\nrelationships\nnow sit with that feeling\nfor the next 60 seconds or so\npick your choice of sensation\nwhether it be the weight of your spine\nthe tips of your fingers the warmth\nabove your palm\nor light coming in through the top of\nyour head\nand focus on that\nnow we're going to take a deep breath\nin for three seconds and out for three\nthrough your nose\nand now in for three and out for five\nand then in for three and out for seven\nand when you're ready\ncome back\ni'm so glad that i asked for that\nmeditation\nit's like more emotional than i was\nexpecting\ni almost cried at some point\nhonestly\nwhat were y'all feeling\nnice to me it was not like strong\noh yeah like i was like oh i have a\nstrong spine\ni felt very light\nme too and um i could feel the warmth it\nwas so intense\num and also um when you said that we\nshould like\nfocus on like a light in your our head\ni could see like the color yellow and i\ncould see blue\nyeah so i'm\nhappy that some of y'all had some really\npositive experiences\num i'm relieved\nso this kind of meditation is actually\nnot my forte\nso i've learned some of these techniques\nbefore and i try to do my best but\ni'm i'm really glad and this is kind of\na lesson to me too\nit was really good i'm glad um\nso a couple of things just to think\nabout so first of all you guys can do\nthis technique\nuh you know and you can pick on whatever\nsensation\nyou kind of feel but your shakti\nrests in your spine there are also a\ncouple of other\nadvanced techniques which i can teach\nyou down the road but\num you know to elevate and generate that\nenergy\nthe last thing that i kind of want to\nsay and i sort of hinted at this but i\nwant you guys to really understand this\ni do genuinely believe that you guys\neach have a spark of divinity within you\nand i know this is not egalitarian or\nequality or anything like that\nbut i tend to find that women are\nactually closer to that spark than men\nare\nand and i'm not trying to make it's just\nmy observation\nand i i'm not kidding when i when i say\nthat\ni think that you guys are able to give\npeople on the internet like something\nthat they really don't have in their\nlife\nand as best as you can and as\nfrustrating or unfair as it is to you\ni'd encourage you to like try to have\nsome compassion towards them i'm not\nsaying that you guys don't\nbut really that these people are\napproaching you from like a place of\nhurt and loneliness\nand then you do the wonderful gift of\nlike giving them\nsupport and you listen to them and you\ntry to be their friend\nand sure they respond to you with\ntoxicity which really isn't fair to you\ni'm not\ntrying to excuse all of that but i think\nthat like it's kind of sad that you guys\nare in the situation and they're in this\nsituation\nand as best as you can try to forgive\nthem\nbecause there is something really\namazing and divine within\neach and every one of you and and it\nreally is kind of like\nyou know you're like you're giving\nemotional support to like a human whose\nlife is a desert\nand it's like water and they're drinking\nit up and they just don't know\nhow to not ask for more and they get\nconfused\nbecause everything we've taught them is\nlike you know it's love\nthat's when everything is gonna be okay\nand you guys know that right like you\nknow that they look at you and they're\nlike\nthere's some fantasy in their mind but\nit's because there's something real that\nyou are giving them\nand it's something as simple as\ncompassion not saying it excuses it\ni'm not saying you can't tell them to go\n[ __ ] themselves\nbut as best as you can don't become\nbitter\nand and as best as you can forgive and\nif you can't\nthat's okay too and it's an\nunfair burden that i'm placing upon you\nby asking you to do this\nit's more than you or it's more than you\nshould do\nand yet i see something like absolutely\namazing and divine within each and every\none of you\nand i think that that's like what we've\ngot to\neven if it's unfair\nrisa you wanted to say something i feel\na little bad since like\nhas all hearts and everything right now\nthat's the only part of meditation that\ni couldn't\ncontinue afterwards is when you mention\nthe divine and pure\nand untamed part i i don't think what we\ndo\nis or at least what i do is that great\nof a gift to people i do agree with\neverything you said to not find bitter\nwhen to be on the receiving side of\nthings like this but\ni don't think what we're doing are godly\ni think is simply being supportive of\nanother person\nand if someone retaliates or responds\nnegatively yeah don't feel better but\nthat was the one part of the meditation\nthat sure\ni couldn't yeah that that's that's\ntotally fine so like let me just explain\njust one quick thing so there are three\nsteps to meditation or understanding\nmeditation\nthe firs and we're going to talk about\ntwo today so the first is to listen\nand the second is actually to doubt in\nthe hindu tradition\nthere are actually texts designed\nto train an aspirant to doubt\nand so i want you all to understand this\nvery clearly\ni don't know the answers what i'm giving\nyou guys is hopefully a tool for you to\nfigure out what's right for you\nit may be this technique it may not be\ndivinity that you feel risa which is\ncompletely fine\nso use whatever parts of this kind of\nresonate with you and if you disagree\nwith the rest so be it\nyou know it ultimately the truth is not\ngoing to be determined by\nwhat i tell you it's going to be\ndetermined by your own experience\ncool yeah thank you last questions or\nthoughts\njust thank you honestly like i've been\nwatching this dream\nsince before my breakup and i don't know\nif i would have broken up with my\nboyfriend if i hadn't been\nand i'm just like in a period of growth\nthat i think your channel started\nhonestly ruining relationships\nyes no seriously the bad ones\nyeah i mean i think it's hard right i\nthink one of the worst things that we\ncan do\nis live life on autopilot\nand sometimes not living on autopilot\nlooks rocky when you first start to do\nit\nbut all the more power to you because\nthat's how you actually take control of\nyour life\nis by doing the hard things so props to\nyou\nmy condolences to your boyfriend\nor ex-boyfriend's heart\nbut good for you and you guys are very\nwelcome thank you all\nvery much for coming on and you know\nsharing who you are and sharing and also\nresponding to my challenges pretty well\num i really do appreciate that i think\nit really shows what your experience is\nwhen i push back\nand i think that's some of the most\neducational stuff and i do apologize if\nespecially the\njoke about you know me being in love\nwith each one of you right now\nout of line i'm sorry if that did offend\npeople\nuh sorry that's all right but thank you\nguys very much and and i agree let's get\nlet's get the counterparts on\nand see what that looks like yeah yeah i\nthink it's cool looking for e-boys\nwhat's that\nokay i don't know what that means but\nokay\nif you guys um but thank you guys\nyeah thank you it's like it's like a boy\ngamer that goes after\ngirls are like is very particular about\nhis appearance\nfor women on the internet\nokay well learn something new every day\nokay so thank you guys very much and\nreally thank you and good luck to all of\nyou\nthanks a lot thank you thank you so much\nbye okay"
