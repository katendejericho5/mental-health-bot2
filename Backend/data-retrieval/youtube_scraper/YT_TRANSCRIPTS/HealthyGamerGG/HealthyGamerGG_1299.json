    "transcript": "yeah man so and and what do you go by\nfriend\num azrael's fine okay\nand so what yeah welcome\nsorry this is this is really confusing\nbecause\nthere's like a a delay um\ndelay on stream yeah it's\nwell you should talk to me on discord\ndon't talk don't listen to what i'm\nsaying on stream right\nso close the close the stream yeah there\nwe go\nthat's better yeah\ni'm sorry i'm new to this yep that's\nokay man\nme and you both i've been doing a little\nbit longer than you but it's okay to be\nnew to it\nyeah all right um\nsorry where were we i was just i i\nmean we weren't really anywhere we were\njust starting all right so\nasriel tell me a little bit thank you\nfor coming on\num tell me a little bit about you know\nwhat motivated you to\nto come on stream today so\ni've been wanting to come on stream for\na while now i think i've been trying\nfor six months or so but oh wow\nwell i'm glad you're here today yeah i\nthink i just wanted to\nshare my story and um i don't know get\nsupport and all that sure\num and yeah i want to talk about\nover analysis and fear of failure\nand i also have social anxiety and\nall that fun stuff yep\num so yeah can you tell us your story\nyeah so um\ni guess this year was my second year at\nuniversity\nand\nso it didn't start off great i sort of\ntook on more than i can handle and i can\nsay that how i dealt with it wasn't\nvery good for my mental health\num so\ni had a lot of courses i had a lot of\nwork to do and all that\nand i started getting depressed\num i wasn't performing as well and so\nlike i it was getting sort of\ndifficult so i started like oh shoot you\ncan't do\nsome simple homework like gotta get on\nthis and\nstarted beating myself up about it\ncalling myself a failure\nand like um started getting afraid\nit's like oh shoot what if i can't do\nthis\nand uh it all sort of spiraled downhill\nfrom there\ni think i met you in december\nwas when i started watching your streams\nand i've been making progress since then\num i changed majors\nbecause i found that the one i was doing\nsort of felt meaningless\npurposeless in a way it's like why am i\neven doing this\nand so yeah i just sort of dropped\neverything and changed pictures\nokay and i think\num i have a lot of fear of failure\nbecause it's like\ni sort of can't mess this up like if i\nmess up university then i mess up\nmy life pretty much and\nit's like that for a lot of things um\nwhat else are\nyou afraid of messing up\nso i tried getting a job this summer\num i applied for a few places and like i\nsort of gave up pretty quickly and like\neven if they hired me like who's gonna\nwant\nme working for them like i'm just gonna\ndisappoint them and all that\num i don't know i felt like a pretty big\nfailure and\nsort of just sort of hid in my room for\nmost this year barely going outside or\nanything\njust playing games and what are you\nplaying um\nso i play minecraft i play starblast.io\nwhich is\nan internet browser game uh\nkerbal space program\ncool stuff i i think those are my main\ngames\n[Music]\ncool so and\nand so uh i'm sorry i didn't mean to\ninterrupt your float you were telling a\nreally great narrative\num so you were saying you're afraid of\nyou tried to get a job this summer um it\nwas kind of hard to\neven kind of apply and stuff because you\nwere concerned that people\nwouldn't even want to hire you anyway so\nyou kind of gave up a little bit\neasily yeah yeah i hardly felt in the\nstate\nto like have a job and um\nokay i think it's like that for a lot of\nthings actually\nlike what um so there's the job\num i\ni'm supposed to be um going to a dentist\nwhich i haven't really done i think i\nneed to update my health card\nand i don't know i just have trouble\ntalking to people\nespecially over the phone and getting\nthat all set\nup and i have i'm afraid of talking to\nmy family because\ni haven't really been completely honest\nwith them with\nwhat was happening um\nwhat is it that they don't know\nso they know that this year was\nparticularly hard for me\nthey don't know that i failed my\ndegree and um they do know that i\nswitched majors and my dad isn't\nparticularly happy about that\num he doesn't think i'll be able to do\nphysics\nwhich is what i switched to and what did\nyou switch from\ni switched from marine biology\nokay so he doesn't think you're gonna be\nable to do\nphysics yeah\nwhich is fair because physics is pretty\nhard right\nsure does your dad\nis your dad disappointed in you\num i\nit's hard to tell i know if i told him\neverything that maybe he would be\ni think he is a little yeah okay\nand so it sounds to me like\nyou're afraid of telling people things\nbecause\nyeah they may be disappointed if they\nknew everything\nyeah if they saw the real you\nyeah so do you feel like you try to hide\nwho you really are\nyeah i think so um\ni've been\nworking on my mental health this summer\nand i've been opening up a little more\nbut\nmainly just online i don't\ntrust anyone in real life with anything\nokay what about like a mental health\nprovider\nlike a therapist um i looked into that\nbut they only have over the phone\nappointments because of kovit and\nagain i have a fear of talking on the\nphone much rather go there in person\ndo they not do like video chat they\nshould do video chat they do like phone\nphone\nlike boomer phone i think so i haven't\nlooked into it that much\nbecause most providers are shifting to\ntele\nhealth which usually involves video\nnowadays\nokay but just something to think about\num\nokay and so i'm not hearing anything so\ni'm hearing about fear of failure\ni'm getting the sense that you feel like\nyou're inevitably gonna disappoint\npeople\nyeah are you disappointed in yourself\ni think um considering\neverything that has happened in my past\nand everything\ni think i was sort of destined to fail\nlike\nthere was definitely warning signs early\non and i didn't really know better but\ni think it was something that was bound\nto happen just because i didn't\nreally know what was going on wha what\ndo you mean warning signs\nwhat were your warning signs\nso even before\nsecond year like i've been sort of\nignoring problems um\ni know in high school\ni had this fear of death\nwhich um i think that\nsort of what happened was so my brother\nwent off to university\num and i was in grade nine and then i\nwas sort of left on my own to figure out\nlife and i don't know my brother was a\nbig part of my life and so\neverything sort of felt pointless and\nmeaningless after that and i started to\nlike\nquestion why am i even here and all that\ni think part of that was trying to\nnavigate the family situation at home\nbecause my parents are divorced\nand it's sort of like a week on week off\nthing where i switch houses\nand my mother found someone else to live\nwith who has\na drinking problem and\nan anger problem which don't go well\ntogether\nso i think that's where my um\nwhere i started getting addicted to\nvideo games because it was an easy\nescape\nsure and what i think all that added up\nto\nwhat happened this year\nso you feel destined to fail\nyeah also sounds like your brother was a\nreally stabilizing influence in your\nlife\nyeah i'd say that\nit's hard to lose someone like that\nespecially at such a formative\ntime of your life like ninth grade\nwhen did your mom start living with this\nother person\nprobably when i was\nseven or eight okay so that sounds like\nthat's been\nin your life for most of what you can\nremember\nyeah okay my parents\ni remember when my parents divorced\ni was going into grade four my dad was\ndriving me to school and they're like\nsorry you're not registered with the\nschool anymore\napparently my mom had just like switch\nschools without telling anyone\nand so it's like oh i'm at a new school\nnow\nthat feel\ni was frustrating i\ni didn't understand like her reasoning\nwhy she didn't tell anyone\nand it's like i don't know\nit's yeah my life's been pretty chaotic\ni'd say\nyeah i was kind of thinking that it it\nseems to me like\nyour life isn't really something that\nyou have a whole lot of control over\nno not really yeah it sounds to me like\nyou're getting\npushed around by events in life like\nyour parents divorce\nwho your mom chooses to live with your\nbrother leaving\nand and so it sounds tough it it feels\nto me like\nyou may be feeling or it seems to me\nlike maybe you're feeling powerless\nyeah i think so a little it's like\ni don't know what to do anymore yep\nand um so one of the things was like\ni know probably around\nlike grade 10 or so when i was dealing\nwith all this on my own i'm like\nyeah i will um i sort of made a promise\nto myself that i would\ndespite how bad things would get i would\nnever\nconsider suicide as an option\nso i think that's helped\nand um sort of at grade 12\ni was really anxious to get out of there\nreally anxious to go off to university\nand live on my own so i could just\nescape it all what were you escaping\neverything really the whole\nsituation at home and everything that's\nbeen going on\num switching back and forth between\nhouses\num sort of means that\neverything that i own has to sort of fit\nin a backpack\nso i can carry it with me where i go\num escaping\n[Music]\nyou know the verbal\nthe anger and stuff of my stepfather\num my mother tends to be over\ncontrolling\nshe likes to do everything for me and i\nwanted to escape that as well\nso yeah sort of everything\nwow that's a lot bro\nthat's a little\ndo you really feel that way or are you\njust making a joke\ni i don't think it's as much as some\npeople go through\nokay so what does that mean for you\nsome people have it worse than you do\nyeah\nso\ni think despite everything that happened\ni should\nhave still been able to find a way\nthrough and\ni shouldn't have ended up where i was\nwhere i am\nsort of thing where should have you\nended up\num\nshould i pass this year at university\num and\ni don't know i should have just been\ndestined for success\ni was supposed to be successful\nand what got in the way\n[Music]\num\nshitty life syndrome i guess um\ni felt very lonely and isolated\nthis year which didn't help\nand i never talked to anyone about how i\nwas feeling or what i was going through\nbecause\ni was afraid of how they would um\njudge me for it and like they'd brush it\noff and say oh it's nothing\njust keep going like you'll get over it\nhave people told you that before\nuh i think my dad tends to um\nhe's not very emotional um i mean he is\nsometimes\nbut like it's like you just gotta do it\nand like\nignore what you're feeling just do it\nright\nyep and he was always pushing for my\nindependence\nand all that being successful\nyep so\nand and where is your brother throughout\nall this\nuh he's in university he's\ni think he graduated last year\nwith a degree in software engineering\nand i also have a sister she's off in\nalberta\nshe got married she has\njust had a baby this summer\nand she's doing pretty good\nshe's an accountant and then there's me\nand i failed\nyeah so it so it feels\nright and so also practically it sounds\nlike you actually failed some coursework\nyeah i stopped doing my assignments okay\nso asriel i'm gonna point out a couple\nof things and i'd love to ask you a few\nmore questions\nis that okay yeah so i\nsee something that really confuses me so\nearlier\nso recently you said that you were\nsupposed to be successful you were\ndestined for success\nbut that something got in the way yeah\nright but earlier when we\nwe when we were talking to you also said\nlike when you\napplied for a job you were just going to\ndisappointment\ndisappoint them even if you got the job\nand that you were destined to fail like\ni asked you\nyou know like what do you think about\nyour current situation you were like\nwell\nnow that i look back on it i saw that\nlike my failure was actually inevitable\nand started many years ago\nso i'm just i'm going to point out to\nyou and we'll explore this that there's\nyeah decide what was that what did you\njust feel\nwhat is it like hearing me point that\nout to you\num\ni i think i'm still a little nervous for\nbeing on stream\nand um\ni i'm just confused like my thoughts are\ncrazy\nyep i can imagine that and that's what\ni'm pointing out to you\nis that i'm seeing a lot of conflicting\nthoughts\nbecause on the one hand asriel was\nsupposed to succeed and everything was\nsupposed to work out\nand on the other hand you sure got\n[ __ ] in life\nyeah and what are you feeling now\npowerless yeah hopeless\nand so here's what i'm seeing asriel it\nwasn't supposed to be this way\nthis was the life you were supposed to\nlive this life\nand then something happened and then\nthat life is now\ncompletely gone and now you've\nshifted into this other life\nand now this is what your future is and\nevery step you take on the road\ntowards failure reminds you that the\nroad towards success is getting further\nand further away\nyeah what does that feel like\ni don't know um\ni don't know about it it's like\ni i'm trying sort of\neverything to try and recover and get\nback where i was\num i'm trying to avoid that road as much\nas possible\ncan you\nmaybe if i try hard enough\nokay\nthat's a good answer maybe is actually\nthe right answer\ni don't know is also acceptable so i\nthink what i'm hearing the first thing\nthat i want to point out asriel is that\nyou have a deterministic view of life\ndestined to fail or destined to succeed\nit's not how life works bro\nright life is a maybe okay\nright like you just can't because like\nyou were destined to succeed and then\nwhat happened\ni failed right so like\nthat the idea of destiny in and of\nitself is false\nbecause like clearly it's not true\nwhat do you think about that\num\n[Music]\ni\ni i don't know that's sort of one of the\ndebates i've been having is like\nyou know is is are things destined to\nhappen\nor do i have a choice and it's like\nwell i make the choice based on\nwhat i have to deal with right now and\nit's like\ni'm doing the best i can so\nand yet i am still failing so\npart of it seems like destiny okay\nsure um\nand so let me ask you a question\nso if you were destined to succeed and\nyou ended up failing\nis it possible to be destined to fail\nand end up succeeding\ndoes it go both ways i hope so\ni hope so too right but that's like it's\ninteresting because if we want to be\nscientific about it\nand if things were destined and then you\nended up failing like maybe\neven though you're hurtling towards\nfailure a hundred percent\ni actually think you should you could be\nokay like i'm not kidding\nwhat do you think about that\ni think i could be too um but it's gonna\ntake a lot of work for sure\nyeah i think it'll take work\ni also think that it's gonna take more\nthan work\nwhat do you think about that\nwhat more is there than work luck\nmy bro that's true\num\ni i don't i don't know if i really\ni don't know how i feel about luck\ngood when you say i don't know how i\nfeel about luck what does that mean\nbecause like if it's just\nluck then why am i able to influence\nthings okay so so there's an important\nword there\nif it's just luck\nyeah so it's not just slack it's not\njust luck but it's also not\njust you\nright so i think this is the hard thing\nabout life\nis that we're in control of our actions\nbut we're not in control of the results\nof our actions\ni can pick up i can pick up the phone\nand i can talk to someone\ni can talk to my parents about how i\nfailed this class\ni'm not in control of how they respond\nyeah yeah that's true\nand how does it feel to not be in\ncontrol of how they respond\nit's it's hard because i want to make\nthem understand but i can't\nyeah so so that too\nyou can't make them understand but\nyou also can't make them not understand\nlike that understanding is not\ndetermined by you\nyou can talk to them right but there's\nno guarantee that they're going to\nunderstand\nso what is it like to pick up the phone\nand tell someone that you failed the\ncorrect answer is it's [ __ ]\nterrifying\nyes that is the right answer okay\nright and that's what you feel\nso now asriel the question that we get\nto\nis like how do you as a human being\nact in the face of complete terror\ni hide in my room which is also the\ncorrect answer\nthis is where there's a part of you\nthat's going to want to say\ni overcome it with strength and internal\nfortitude\nno that's not what happens when we face\nabject terror we get our asses kicked\nthat's what happens man it crushes us\nyeah and then you wind up where you are\nnow which is\nin your room playing minecraft all day\navoiding your responsibilities and being\ncrushed by terror\nyeah now comes the next question\nis that okay\nnow incorrect\nwhat do you think about that\ni\ni feel like despite everything that's\ngoing on i should be able to\ndo something and i shouldn't be hiding\nin my room so when you say um\nwhen you say this is the right thing to\ndo i\ndon't understand that good\nthat's what we're here for right so like\nso is it the right thing to do no\nis it the expected thing to do\nabsolutely\ncan we blame you for doing it\nabsolutely i mean sorry like not really\nright like we can't\nyou know like in a sense like i don't\nblame you for responding the way that\nyou have\ndoes that make sense yeah\nlike it's understandable and i think\nwe've got to start there right so i\nthink\none of the biggest things about taking\ncontrol of your life asriel\nis starting where you're at instead of\nwhere you should be\nthink about this with me for a second\nokay\nwe live our lives and we come up with\nsolutions for our life based on where we\nshould be not where we are\nand then we're confused when it doesn't\nwork\nand it's like man\nyou know i i can't even come up with an\nanalogy but do you see how ridiculous\nthat is\nyeah it's like i should be able to fly\nlike a bird\nso i'm gonna flap my wings and like then\ni get upset with myself for not being\nable to fly\nright it's crazy because you keep on\ntalking about what you should be like\nyou should be able to overcome that fear\nwell like if you were a dude who could\novercome that fear then you would have\ndone it by now\nso okay you can't overcome fear here's\nthe wild thing\nis i think that you can still be\nsuccessful as long as you acknowledge\nthat you're [ __ ] up in some way\nall right right because then at least\nlike you know what you're playing it's\nsort of like\nyou know like i don't know like i don't\nknow if you've ever played dark souls\nbut like\nyou know i kind of think about there's a\nclass in dark souls called deprived\nwhich is like you start the game naked\nwith a club\nand if you think like you can also start\nthe game in like chainmail armor\nwith a sword and shield and then you can\nplay dark souls like pretending that you\nhave a sword and shield and armor\nand then you're gonna lose but if you\nlike start with the get-go which is like\ni'm a naked dude with a club\nyou can actually play the game but you\njust have to like accept that you've got\na club instead of like\narmor and a sword you can accept that\nsomething about the way that you were\nraised and we're gonna get into this\nhas made it hard for you to be confident\nin yourself and have faith in yourself\nthat i don't think is your fault so no\nwonder like\nyou don't have like so you say i'm just\ngoing to disappoint them like where the\n[ __ ] what what do you base that on\num past experience um\nexactly right but here's the thing i\ndon't know if you know this\nbut when human beings are born\nit's not like natural that they believe\nthat they're inevitably going to\ndisappoint people\nlike people have done studies on the\nbrain and there's no like i'm going to\ndisappoint everyone in life center of\nthe brain\nwe're taught that we're going to\ndisappoint people\nso the beliefs that you have about\nyourself are very reasonable\neven if they're wrong what do you think\nabout that think that makes sense\ni don't think they're wrong yep\ni know that you and they're they they're\nnot wrong for you right because\nyou're not a dumb guy and why do you\nbelieve the things that you believe\nbecause i learned them absolutely\nbecause of\npast experience now here's the thing\ndoes past experience determine future\nexperience\nnow you sure about that\num\nyeah i guess it could\nit depends like if it's the same person\nthen yes\nbut if it's a different person then\nthings are\ncould be different okay are you the same\nperson you were yesterday\nno okay so\nright so that's kind of interesting\nbecause what you're shaking like what\nyou're doing there\nif i were to accept your answers what\nyou seem to be suggesting to me\nis that you do have some limited control\nover your future\nyeah how does that sit with you\nyeah that makes sense okay so now we get\nto the important question\nis it enough\nwell i'm figuring that out now because\nwith everything i'm trying i hope it's\nenough\nthat also is the right answer so there's\na\nsubtle shift in your language asriel and\ni'm optimistic for you by the way\nand is like you you started out by\nsaying\ni'm just going to disappoint them i'm\ndestined to fail\ni'm destined to be successful i'm\nsupposed to be this\ni should be this right\nyeah and and then the question becomes\nlike like\nso those are very deterministic\nstatements they're black and white\nthinking\nand now what you're saying is like\nmaybe or i hope do you\nusually think thoughts like that\nhold on a second there seemed to be like\na thousand people getting\nmessages deleted i don't understand\nanyway um what what do you think about\ni'm gonna just realize that\nwhat do you think about like you know\nlike shades of grey statements versus\ndeterministic\nlike do you usually think in in terms of\nlike this is going to happen\num uh\nnot entirely\nit's sort of like i have no clue what\nwill happen\nbut i think it's gonna be bad okay\nright so that makes sense because it\nsounds like there have been times in\nyour life\nwhere you weren't sure what was gonna\nhappen and what usually happened was\nbad so that's a reasonable thing to\nexpect\nright so now if it's okay i'm going to\nask you a couple questions\nabout your your life and your upbringing\nso\num so i'm going to just run through like\nwhat i understood your story to be\nactually before we do that can i ask you\nso i understand that over\nanalyzing is part of the like what you\nwanted to talk about today i'm not\nhearing any sort of over analysis so far\ncan you tell us about that\ni think i think that's um sort of like\nlike what we were just talking about\nwhere it's like\ni'm uncertain what will happen but i\nknow it will be bad and i can analyze\nthat\nin like so many different ways as oh\nthis could happen this could happen this\ncould happen this could happen\ni'm gonna have to think about this more\nbefore i take action\nit's like and like in all the bad things\nthat can happen i can only have one\ngood outcome which is that it succeeds\nand the bad outweighs the good in most\ncases\nyep right so let's let's look at that\nbecause that's fascinating\nso what i'm hearing you say is that the\nmore you\nanalyze does that\nmake it easier for you to act or harder\nfor you to act\nharder and generally speaking when we\nthink about analyzing a problem what is\nthe goal of analysis\nto come to a solution so that you can\nact\nabsolutely accordingly which is weird\nright\nso the reason that we like use our head\nis to figure out how to do things\nand yet somehow the more you think the\nharder it becomes to do things\nyeah and so\nwhat do you think about that\ni think i think that's how i was raised\nis\num there's only one good outcome in the\nrestaurant bed and like\ni i gotta make the right decisions or\ni'm gonna mess up\nand things are gonna be bad um\ncan you tell us what you mean by that's\nhow i was raised\nlike if i didn't get do my homework then\ni was gonna get in trouble\nif i didn't ask my stepfather if he\nneeded help then he was gonna get angry\nat dinner if\ni don't know if\nif i left my room when he was in\none of his bad moods i was likely to get\nin trouble\nand what is getting in trouble look like\nwell\nhe sort of gets um\nangry right and he\nhe takes it out on me because it's like\noh this is your fault somehow\nfunds a way to blame me for it um\nand i try all that i can to try and stop\nstop\nthat from happening um\nbut it's not physical it's only verbal\nso and then\nin the beginning my mother sort of\nsupported him\nbut i think near the end\ni started to become more vocal about\nlike\nthis isn't right i sort of started to\nstand up for myself and\ni think near the end things were\nstarting to change\num i know he started seeking help for\nhis problems a little\num\n[Music]\nyeah how do you feel about that\nit's hard because\nwhen my brother was there it's like oh\nwe can get through this together but\nwhen it's just me it's like oh\ni have to figure this out on my own what\ndo i do\nit was hard but\ni think like i understand\nthat he was going through his own\nproblems\nbut doesn't make it right\nyeah i mean you know in a bizarre way\nasriel i feel\nsadder for you now\nbecause it's like now he's on the\njourney of self-discovery and\nimprovement\nand like that [ __ ] needed to happen way\nearlier\nand you started standing up for yourself\nand then like you know you needed\nsomeone to do that for you when you were\nyoung\nit sounds to me like too little too late\nwhich is almost worse than like nothing\nat all\nmaybe we got there in the end i guess\nso what\nstill [ __ ] you up before he got there\nsure\nasriel i'm not getting much anger from\nyou\nno i'm not an angry person i\ntend to sympathize with others even if\nthey've done me wrong yeah what do you\nthink about that\ni think that's just\nbecause i can always see their side of\nthe story\nand it's i understand that there are\ngoing through their own troubles\nand what does it do to your hurt\nwhen you can see their side of the story\nwell it takes the blame off of me a\nlittle i guess\nsure it\nmeans that i can sort of\nfind ways of helping them so that\nbecause if i help them then maybe\nthey'll stop\nokay\ni'm gonna need a second to think is that\nokay sure\nso that makes a lot of sense to me\nasriel and it's just\nso [ __ ] up i want you to listen to\nwhat you're saying\nokay i'm going to repeat it back to you\nyou have an abusive stepfather\nand you try to understand him\nand the conclusion that you come to is\nthat if you can help him\nbecause he needs help\nthen you'll feel better\nwhereas like that's not really where\nlike it's not\non you\nyeah right and and so i get what you\nmean about sort of deflecting blame i\nthink the interesting thing is that\nthe other person that you're protecting\nby doing that what you also do is you\nlike prevent yourself from blaming them\nyeah so one last psychological point i\nwant to make or one\nkind of psychological point that i want\nto make is that\nsome people believe that depression is\nanger turned against the self\nthat that describes my experience pretty\nwell yeah\nokay so\nhere's what i think could be going on\nwith you because i think you have\nso when someone grows up in an abusive\nhousehold\nand when their step parent is abusive\nand their\nactual parent is even supportive of it\nhow much anger do you think that that\nperson should feel\nthey should be frustrated\nthat's the understatement of the year my\nfriend\nright like how fair is that\nlike your mom should be protecting you\nagain i understand why she wasn't\nbecause\nshe herself was a little afraid too\nyup and i understand that you understand\nthat which is cool\nand at the same time she should have\nbeen protecting you\nand i'm not talking about blaming her or\nthings like that in your particular case\ni want you to think about this like\nother people\nlike when you have a step parent who's\nabusive towards a child what is the\nparent supposed to do\nyou're supposed to step in absolutely\nright so and i i know that you're going\nto have your mind is going to generate\ncertain thoughts\nlike you're going to want to get go\nahead and give me the counterpoint\nwhen you said that you wanted to say\nsomething else right and explain things\nand protect her go ahead protect her\nwell\ni think she herself was also um\na victim of it too um\ni think she was doing the best that she\ncould um\nmaybe she didn't understand the\nsituation as well\nsure yeah all those things are fair i'm\nnot trying to demonize your mom do you\nfeel like we're beating up your mom\nasking if you feel that way no\nokay i don't think so because it's not\nit's genuinely not my intention\nso now the question becomes if someone\nlike you know if someone grows up in\nthat situation\nlike sure i understand that you are\nunderstanding\nbut i think that what's going on is\nyou're accumulating anger\nyou're not sending it towards them\nyou're just accumulating it and then\nwhere does it go\ni push it down pretend it doesn't exist\nand then it bursts out in second year\nuniversity\nhow so what is it target\nbecause it's energy it's got to go\nsomewhere\ntargets me absolutely\ngotta go somewhere\nright so like now this is how emotions\nwork\nif i win the lottery i'm filled with joy\nand then what do i do i spread it around\nit's got to go somewhere i can't contain\nit it's got to go somewhere\nand in your case filled with anger\ndoesn't have anywhere to go got to keep\nit inside\nand then now left feel it no of course\nyou don't\nwhat it feels like is depression\nyou don't think that i'm just going to\ndisappoint them\nis you being an [ __ ] to yourself\nyeah it is there it is it just feels\ndifferent\nyou've gotten so good at not feeling\nanger you don't even know what it looks\nlike\nanymore my dude you are\nin an abusive relationship with yourself\nyep right\nand that's like really sad and it's\nit's like why why are you that way with\nyour song\num\ni blame myself for everything because\nthere's always something i could have\ndone differently\nand maybe it would have worked yep right\nso right so\nthat's the thought process that's the\ncontent of your mind i'm asking\nwhy does your mind think in that way\nand it's because you were taught\nthat things are your fault\nright like your stepdad was like it's\nyour fault i'm angry\neverything in the world is whose fault\nasriel\nmine absolutely\nright so then like like we asked the\nquestion why do you blame yourself it's\nbecause\nthose are the rules of the game if you\nlog on to the game of life\nand you're playing this game with\nminecraft where you're asriel\nand then something burns down halfway\nacross the world\nand then everyone on the server is like\n[ __ ] that guy asriel\nand it's so [ __ ] up my dude\nbut we see this a lot right like we see\nlike you know like i'm gonna just give\nyou an example of another abusive\nrelationship so let's say there's like a\nhusband and wife and\nlike the husband is physically abusive\nand i've dealt with this a lot\nand then the wife like i talked to the\nwife and she's like yeah he hit me\nand then i was like oh like tell me\nabout that she's like well it's because\nyou know like i didn't have dinner ready\non time\nand if i had dinner ready on time\nhe wouldn't have hit me which is\ntrue right and like it it's true\nbut it's also [ __ ] up it doesn't make\nit okay\neven if it's true and i think the\nproblem\nthat i'm seeing in you is that like\nthere's a lot of truth in your mind of\nthings which i think unfortunately\nyou're a smart guy\nlike if you were stupider i could\nconvince you that you were wrong\nbut i think that you learned and this is\nwhat happens when kids grow up right\nlike this is a survival mechanism\nif i have a dog that i'm physically\nabusive to the dog learns how to not get\nhit\nand you learned because he sure as hell\nisn't taking any of the blame in the\nrelationship\nand your mom is also reinforcing like\nwhose fault is it that he's mean to you\nit's mine right and generally speaking\nshe's supposed to tell you the opposite\nand so you've learned that everything is\nyour fault\neven things that aren't your fault and\nthen let me ask you something what is a\nkid\nwho feels like things that are not their\nfault are their fault\nhow do they think about their ability to\ncontrol the future\num they think that\nthey can control everything and if\nsomething doesn't happen\ncorrectly it's their fault yep\nit's bizarre right\nand that's what we see in you\nyou feel like you have perfect control\nall of the responsibility actually it's\nnot\ncontrol i'm going to use the word\nresponsibility you feel like you are\nresponsible for controlling your\nfuture and at the same time you feel\npowerless\nand why do you feel powerless\nbecause deep down you recognize that you\nactually don't control your stepdad\nright so that kid is conflicted because\neveryone is telling him\nyou are in control of the situation but\nthen there are horrible truths that you\ncan't control your stepdad's behavior\nand it's this core conflict of like\ni'm in control but i'm actually\npowerless\ndoes that make sense yeah\nis that how you feel\nyeah it's like i'm powerless now\nbut if i work a little harder i'll be in\ncontrol\nyeah right so like if you had asked your\ndad for help\nthen then you'll be okay\nand so so it's interesting because\nsubtly and i i think you're right there\nthat like\nyou have this idea that if you do\nsomething that something will happen but\ni think unfortunately as you've learned\nyou can't really control\nwhat's gonna happen and what i'm hearing\nyou actually try to do and and this may\nbe a bit abstract\nyou're trying to shift your life back\ninto the world of [ __ ]\nlike this is the way your life should be\nand if you could just get back on that\ntrack\nthen everything's gonna be fine\nthat's what i feel from you it's like i\njust need to board that train and then\nthe train will take me where i need to\ngo\nyou're living in fantasy it's not how it\nworks man\nit's sad all right\nhuh\ni i think that could be true yeah\nwhat makes you think that could be true\ni tend to um i tend to fantasize a lot\ni'm a big dreamer i\nlike to dream of the future and\neven if it's not relating to me i like\nto think of\nyou know epic space battles and\ncivilizations on the edge of the\nuniverse and all that\nthat's cool man it is\nso it sounds like you're familiar with\nfantasy are you familiar with hope\n[Music]\nnot so much right\nand i think here's the problem is that\nfantasy doesn't actually help us move\nforward\nwhat do you think about that\ni i disagree okay because like\nit's like this is where i want to go\nwhich is the fantasy and it's like all\nright how do i get there\nand then i can plan it out\nand hopefully go in the direction i want\nokay\nso that's i i stand corrected\ni concede the point so when you plan it\nout\ndoes it help you get there\nyes i think so\nnow i'm really confused because\nthis doesn't sound to me like someone\nwho's destined to fail\nhelp me help me understand are you\ndestined to fail\nno are you just saying that because\nthat's the right answer or do you\nactually believe that\nbecause this is like healthy gamer dr k\nand i'm supposed to be inspirational\nno i i don't i don't think i'm\ndestined to fail\nbut in order to succeed i would need to\nwork really hard\nfor it okay and what do you need to\nwork really hard towards\ngetting my life back where it was\ngetting back on the success train\nokay so i think that's the wrong answer\nso here's why i think the success train\nis an illusion\nit's it's wishing you had chain mail and\na sword\nright so i understand i i think you can\nbe successful\nbut i think like instead of chasing that\nfantasy of the success train i think\nit's like way\ndirtier than that\nthere's something about that that seems\nlike very clean and beautiful\nand alluring to me i think there's\nabsolutely hope and i think i\nabsolutely see success in your future i\njust think it's gonna be like\nmessier than you or that i'm getting\nfrom you now\nmaybe i like to think that everything\nwill just work\nout but\nthat's not the case obviously\nyeah so that can be a comforting thought\nasriel and now i think we get into like\nsome really nuanced territory\nwhere i don't think that everything is\njust going to work out\ni think you can build the life that you\nwant to and if you're studying physics\nbecause you want to discover\nextraterrestrial life one day\ni'd say [ __ ] dude go for it\nyou know and and like you're interested\nin science fiction and understanding\nlike how the universe works and like the\nfrontiers of like\nspace travel and all that kind of i'd\nsay go for it man i just think it's\ngonna be messy\nyeah and i don't think that that's\nnecessarily bad\nokay right because i i think what you're\ndoing and now we're going to kind of go\nback to some of your like psychological\npatterns\nbecause what you're always doing is\nlooking for the perfect solution\nbecause let me tell you why you think\nyou have a fear of failure\nand the reason that you think is to get\nrid of the fear of failure because if\nyou can find that perfect solution where\nthere's no chance of failure\nthen do you need to have fear you know\nthat's what you try to do right you try\nto remove fear through thinking\nagreed yep and that's a perfect solution\nthere it is again do you see the fantasy\nof that if i can find that\nmagical road then i don't have to deal\nwith the fear it's so clean and it's so\nbeautiful\nand i can figure out the perfect thing\nto say and then i can pick up the phone\nand i can talk to someone\nall i need to know to pick up the phone\nand talk to someone is i have to figure\nout what's the\nperfect thing to say yeah\nbecause that's what you do man you look\nfor it like how can i tell my dad\nthat i failed and how can i phrase it\nso that he doesn't judge me\nit's the magical train how do i board\nthat train if i\nthink really really hard and i analyze\nand analyze and analyze\ni can find i can board the magic train\nand he won't be disappointed\nso you're overthinking and you're\nyou're your search for fantasy is to\nprotect you\nfrom fear it's your antidote to fear\nand it's paralyzing because\nthere isn't a perfect solution\nand so you're searching for a cure to\nfear that doesn't exist do you disagree\n[Music]\ni think there's always a perfect\nsolution but\nlike i don't think things have to be\nmessy\nokay i think that's a fair point\nso here's my question to you\nso actually it's not a question i'm just\ngonna make a point for you to think\nabout okay\ni think that there may be perfect\nsolutions and i certainly have felt that\ni think there are times in my life for\nexample like as a psychiatrist sometimes\ni deal with people\nwho are suicidal and then i think that\nsometimes there is like the perfect\nthing to say\nand this is someone who's like wants to\nkill themselves\nand then you like you gotta say the\nright thing can't say the wrong thing\nand so i do believe that those things\nexist i'm with you\nwhat i have found and this is something\nyou've got to think about this isn't\nsomething that i can ask you questions\nbecause you're a smart guy i think\nyou've got to come to your own\nconclusion\nis that building a strategy based on\nperfect solutions\nis a bad strategy\nbecause perfect solutions are few and\nfar between\nand they're hard to find whereas\nbuilding a strategy based on solutions\nthat are good enough\ntends to be a better strategy\nand while it ain't perfect it's actually\ngonna get you to where you go like you\nknow i just think about cooking\nand it's like you can't like sure you\ncan make a perfect cookie but\nthat's hard making a decent cookie\nactually gets you most of the way there\nwhat do you think about that\ni think that's true\ni do a lot of cooking and it's sort of\nlike i just improvise and\nfigure out what works what doesn't just\nby trial and error\nokay interesting right so why can you do\nthat with cooking but you can't do that\nwith other things in your life\nbecause with cooking it's just me\nand it's like if i mess this up oh well\nit's like the consequences aren't that\nbig i just have\nbad food\nnow i'm gonna say something that's\nabsolutely go ahead sorry\nyeah sorry it's like um\nyou know i could have bad food but most\ntime it turns out pretty good\nso i i think it works\nand and so what makes real life\ndifferent\nbecause in real life you only have one\nshot\nto make it pretty good\nbecause like if i fail\nand i waste all that money in university\nthen i'm gonna end up broke and i'm not\ngonna have a degree and i'm not gonna\nhave a job\nand then i will be nowhere and i can't\nhow would i recover from that i can't go\nback to university because i'll just\nwaste more money that i don't have\nso i only have one shot\nright yeah i can see why you think that\nway\nand as someone who\nalso failed a lot\nlike i mean i you know i had\ni had a d average after two years of\ncollege\nhad a lot of f's took me five years\nprobably took would have taken me five\nand a half or six years to graduate\nreally busted my ass in my fifth year\nand and managed to graduate\njust one year late i don't know what the\nis it canadian uses of four canadian\nschools use\na four-point gpa system\nyeah so i graduated with a 2.5 and had\nless than a 2.0 after two years\nand what you're saying is logical\nand in my experience real life turns out\nto be way more like cooking than you\nwould imagine\nand i'm not saying that the steaks\naren't the same like if you overcook\nyour chicken like not that big of a deal\nbeing a hundred thousand dollars in debt\nslightly bigger deal\nand at the same time i i just don't\nthat's not\nit's just not how life works man like\none relationship is not\nyou know like even when it comes to your\nyour mom and your stepdad\nthey kind of [ __ ] you up and at the\nsame time\ndoesn't mean that they can't try to fix\nit\nwhat do you think about that\num i don't think\ni think it's up to me to fix it honestly\nwho's surprised you said that\nright because what are you doing there\ni'm blaming myself for what happened\nyep you see how quick you are to do that\nyeah and and and so it's so hard because\nwhen you blame yourself for what\nhappened it's like it\nlike really raises the stakes right it's\nlike kind of it's hard it's a hard way\nto live man\nand you know i\ni feel like this is sort of an abstract\nor theoretical discussion is this\nhelpful for you\num\ni think so how so\ni think it helps me understand sort of\nwhat's going on um\ni don't know i tend to be pretty\nabstract\nyeah i think you're a thinker yeah\nyeah i am too i really enjoy it\nat the same time i'm i'm noticing a\nlittle bit of a pressure within me\nto try to make this practically\napplicable to you\nyeah i think so okay\nso here's can we do that for a little\nbit\nsure so it's cool like we like have\ncontemplated like oh like what is your\npsychology like man\nand then it's like today is august 5th\nand you're going to wake up tomorrow\nmorning and it's going to be august 6th\nand like what the [ __ ] do you do with\nall this\nright so like let's talk about that for\na second because i don't know\ni mean have i helped you today like sure\nwe've jerked each other off\nintellectually\nand philosophized but\nyou know it's like is this actually\ngonna help you like\nmaybe down the road or something sure\nbut like let's think about\nhow to actually help you so here's the\nfirst thing that i want you to\nreally recognize i want you to see that\nyou have a pattern within yourself\nthat you consider\nfailure so you have a fear of\ndisappointing people\nand you have a fear of messing up\nbecause ultimately you're responsible\nand if you screw up you screw up and\nthat\nthe way that your mind tries to fix that\nfear is by analysis\nuntil you find a perfect solution\nand that in turn paralyzes you\nit keeps you from acting as we talked\nabout analysis\nnormally is designed to help you act and\nwhat it does is the exact opposite\nand if you don't act your life is going\nto continue going down\nyeah so bizarrely what you need to do is\nmake\nto based on bad decisions\nbecause your decision is not nearly it's\nnot going to be perfect and in your mind\nany solution that is not perfect is\nit's gonna i'm gonna fail yep\nbut that's not how things work really\nright\nlike it's not like if you overcook your\nchicken it's inedible\nlike there tend to be some things that\nare gonna really mess up your life\nand then there's like a perfect solution\nbut like most of the things that you're\ngonna do are gonna kind of work out okay\nlike that i mean that's just been my\nexperience\nbut i i want you to more importantly\nlike even even despite challenging that\ni think the more important thing is to\nrecognize that when you\nact when you try to act that you're\ngonna look for a perfect solution\nand then that that search for the\nperfect solution is going to impede your\nactual action\nwhich in turn is going to hold you back\nin life\nand that when you've actually grown and\nbecome confident in something you did it\nthrough trial and error\nnot painstaking research and perfect\nsolutions through trial and error\nand honestly asriel that is exactly what\nmy experience was\ni started my third year of college and i\nwas like this isn't working\nand i haven't figured out how to fix it\nbut i gotta do something\nand like i didn't turn like i didn't go\nfrom\n2.0 to 4.0 it was like 2.6\nthe next semester and then it was like\n3.1\nand then it was like 3.0 and then it was\nlike 3.4\nand i sort of wound up with a 2.5\nwhich is not that much better\nyou know than i mean it's it's good\nenough\nso i want you to just recognize that\nyour fear\nlike you're going to have this very\ntangible fear that's going to keep you\nfrom acting\nand that your mind is going to analyze\nto try to make the fear go away\nbut that actually what it does is like\nparalyzes you further\nso your solution is actually your\nproblem\nso then so yep when i would just\nwould i just act on my first instance\nthat's going to be impossible for you\nbecause the programming is pretty deep\nyeah right so you can't just act on your\nfirst\ninstinct what you need to do is like\nnotice this pattern within yourself\nand then as best as you can try to set\nit aside in the tiniest ways\nso like i think for example you should\ntry to find a therapist\nand what's happening is you're afraid of\ntalking to them on the phone\nand so notice that fear and then run a\nlittle experiment because you're a\nphysicist at heart\nand what you need to do as real like so\nall of your\ncurrent hypotheses are based on the data\nof the past\nand what i would really love it if you\ncould do is collect your own experiment\nthat does not involve your stepfather\ni mean collect your own data run a\n[ __ ] experiment without him\nbecause i can almost guarantee you it's\ngoing to give you different data\nyour sense of confidence in yourself\nis based on like him interfering with\nyour [ __ ] experiment\nso like no wonder you think that you're\nincapable of doing everything and\neverything is your fault because that's\nlike\nthat's what he taught you\nand when it turns out like you know did\nyour stepfather think you were a good\ncook\ni didn't cook much fascinating\nit's almost as if you like learned good\nthings and life skills when he wasn't\naround\nright so like notice that you have the\nfear and like just run a couple\nexperiments right so like try picking up\nthe phone\nand recognize that you have this beast\nwithin you that's going to say\noh my god you're going to screw it up\nyou're going to screw it up you're going\nto say the wrong thing\nthey're going to say who is this idiot\nwho's calling me he's not even worth my\ntime as a therapist like he's too dumb\nyou're gonna have all these like random\nthoughts and it's like\nlike what did you think was gonna happen\ntoday\ni thought i was gonna mess up how are\nyou doing\nfine i'm pretty good\nwell\ni i do i have to admit that\ni was trying to control the situation\nbefore i got on\nactually this morning and got a webcam\nand a mic\njust for this well i plan on using it\nfor other things too but good for you\ni'm confused though like how like did\nyou find the perfect solution to this\ndid you figure it out\nwell it felt like a pretty good solution\num\nyeah i'd agree\nso can i tell you what i saw today\nasriel\ni saw a guy who showed up and gave it\nhis best shot\nwith no guarantees took a [ __ ] risk\nyeah like the chance that like maybe dr\nk\nis gonna think i'm an idiot and everyone\non twitch that is gonna think i'm stupid\nand i may disappoint not only your\nfamily\nbut this thing called the internet\nand you didn't cause here's the crazy\nthing asriel i think you're actually a\npretty capable guy\ni think you're smart you're compelling\nyou have a nice smile\ni think you try really hard you're a\ncompassionate person you care about\nother people sometimes to the detriment\nof yourself\nand if you can stop stop being angry\nwith yourself and cut yourself a break\ni think you're gonna do great\ni don't need you to be perfect i just\nneed you to be you\ni don't need you to be on that track\nthat you should be and think about all\nthe preparation you could have done\ninstead of what you did\nwhat you did was like the minimum\nnecessary which is you got a webcam and\na mic\nand thank you for that because if you\nhadn't done that this would have sucked\nwell i already had a a webcam and a mic\non my computer it was just bad quality\nso like that's that's i think a perfect\nexample my dude\nbecause like this is the amount of\ncontrol that you have in life\nyou could have made this experience\nworse but instead\nyou put forth a little bit of effort and\nyou made it a little bit better\nand that i think is all you need to do\nit's going to be anxiety provoking\nthere's a chance you're going to\ndisappoint people\nand that monster of fear is gonna be\nthere\nand at the same time like it takes huge\nballs to come on here\nespecially six months after you signed\nup like there's a certain amount of like\nidiotic adrenaline when you sign up and\nif we're like yeah come on next week\nwe don't give your mind time to like\nthink through things\nif i'm honest it's um i sort of signed\nup multiple times\nit sort of like took multiple shots in\nthe dark\nokay um\nbut yeah each time i refined my response\nto be a little better until\nfinally it worked and i'm like wow and\nactually think i'd be on today\nyeah interesting i wonder if that means\nthat everyone else is going to refine\ntheir responses\nbut i i i wouldn't are you sure it's\nanyway we don't need to get into that\nbut that also is like kind of cool right\nlike so that's kind of respectable\nlike if at first you don't like but i\nthought you just got one shot at stuff\ni'm confused\nnow i'm confused because what you're\ndescribing is that the road to success\nis trial and error\nand not to do things perfectly out of\nthe gate\ni think um i think that's what i'm\nlearning now is sort of\ntrial and error but that's not how i\nused to think\num i do trial and error for some things\nbut for other things\nthe risk is too great yep\nthat's that's yeah how i think of it yep\nand that's okay\nright so i want you to notice like\nyou're going to have a conversation with\nyourself\nand asriel is going to ask terrifying\nasriel\nhey buddy can we try this\nand then sometime terrified astral is\ngoing to be like absolutely not\nno way we are not going to ask that\nperson out on a date\ncannot do it\nand and there are going to be some\nthings like hey can we get go on the\ninternet and bear our deepest darkest\nfeelings to random people on twitch\nand be judged by them because we have\nsocial anxiety\nand then terrified asriel is like go for\nit\nthat's the funny thing is that i\nactually i trust twitch\nmore than i trust real people\nand that's i know people call that funny\nbut i'm with you\ni'm with you bro because i think we have\nthis perception that twitch is like full\nof\n[ __ ] but like the crazy thing\nis it's like the exact opposite\nlike all you have to do is give people\nan opportunity to like be\ndecent human beings and they amaze me\ncan't let them take advantage of you\nthough because they'll still troll you\ni'll get you\nthey catch you with your pants down but\nyeah it's cool right it's amazing like\nhow much people on the internet\ncan help you and support you and how\nloving and caring\nof individuals they can be\nit's wild it is\nso last thing i'm gonna ask you asriel\nis like\ni want concretely like what are you\ngonna\ndo like today is august 5th\nand what are you going to do tomorrow\nor today\num well i have a list of all the things\nthat i'm supposed to do\ngreat i love making lists of things that\ni'm supposed to do that i never end up\ndoing\nit's one of my favorite pastimes\nyep\ni i guess i'm just gonna try things\num so i'd be more concrete i'd pick one\nof those things on your list\none of those what's just pick one\nall right um\ni am\nwhat if i i picked the most the least\nimportant one fine\nyou can pick whatever you want what's\nthe very important one\nactually it's pretty important but um\ni sort of have a minecraft mod pack that\ni'm working on\nand um it's pretty much\nready it's just that i'm trying to\nrelease like\nget the description and everything so\npeople know what it's about\nand the fear i have with that is like oh\nno one's going to be interested\nbut i i can try it anyways\ni guess see what happens so so\nso this is what i want you to do i want\nyou to notice that fear\nas if it's like a part of you\nright so there's going to be like a\nlittle corner of your mind or a big\ncorner of your mind that's filled with\nthat fear\nand that fear is going to tell you no\nyou can't release that description\nbecause the description isn't good\nenough\nyou need to revise it more\ndon't half-ass it right don't just show\nup today with your like inbuilt camera\nbut at the same time don't cancel and\nnot come on stream\nfind that middle road of okay like i'm\ngonna make it give it a decent shot\ni'm gonna spend an hour coming up with\nthe description i'm gonna sleep on it\nso i want you to come up with the\ndescription today sleep on it\ngive it a pass tomorrow and then\neveryone into a chat is asking for the\nlink\noh boy right so\nso when you say oh boy what happened\nwhat happened when i told you that\nwhat happened within you\nit's like\nit's not ready yet so but what is that\ndon't tell me don't tell me the content\nnotice what happens there's like\na serpent that is uncoiling and right\nit's like a cobra that's like rearing up\nand it's flaring its hood\nyou feel that yeah\nlike like what what are they gonna think\nso so notice that thing don't get lost\nin the thoughts themselves now we're\ngonna meditate but sort of a weird\nmeditation\nclose your eyes okay one sec\nyep\nokay so you're gonna draft a description\ntoday\ncan you do that\ni can start how long is a description\nwell i'm trying to describe every little\nthing\nso it's pretty long description so don't\ndescribe every little thing\nso you can list as much as you want to\nbut the description should be like one\nparagraph\ni think i don't know how mind packed\nmods\nminecraft mod packs or whatever how long\ntheir descriptions are\nbut like they're nice to be like i have\nthe description it's just i'm trying to\ndescribe all the features involved and\nall that\nokay so are we talking about like a\nnotepad text file that has the full\ndescription\nare we talking about the blurb that\npeople like download\nlike that describes the mod before they\ndownload it\nthe full description okay so the full so\nthis is like in a text file\nand it can be like a hundred pages right\nyeah okay okay okay fine okay so i want\nyou to just\nthink about that description for a\nsecond you're gonna try to work on it\ntoday\nyou're gonna sleep on what you did\nyou're gonna work on it tomorrow\nhow do you feel emotionally and what\nwhat are you thinking in your head\num i think i can do that okay\ni don't feel anything okay\ngreat so this is what i'm gonna do i'm\ngonna ask everyone else to sit up\nstraight\nand i want you guys to pick something so\nwe're gonna give you guys about 30\nseconds to\nthink of something that you want to do\nthat's like on your to-do list that is\nhard for you to do or that you're\nprocrastinating about\nor whatever it's ideally something that\nyou're afraid of doing\nso this is going to be like a\nfear-oriented meditation\nokay now i'm going to say something\nasriel to trigger you\nokay and this is going to be hard\nbecause then what i want you guys at\nhome to do\nis think about the scenario\nthat you're trying to avoid\nso in your case we're going to think\nabout like what's going to evoke\njudgment\nso asriel everyone on twitch wants the\nlink\nand what happens watch it catch it\nexperiment\nwhat happens within you um\nfelt something in my chest yep\nthat that's all i felt okay and what's\nhappening in your mind\ni i don't know\nit's sort of\nsort of blank okay so hold on a second\ni thought that when we talked about\nsharing the link you would be paralyzed\nwith fear\nbecause that's what started to happen\nwhen i first said it right\nthe first time i thought you're a legit\ni'm still legit\noh they want the link\nlike on friday like people are gonna ask\nme about it and if you've got your [ __ ]\ntogether\nsee we're gonna make it real for you now\nyou can't gotta play with live ammo\nthey're gonna ask me on friday when i\nstream next they're like where's the\nlink\nand i'm gonna be like okay here it is\nnow what do you see what's happening\nwith you asriel\ni gotta do it now okay\nthey're they're depending on me how does\nthat feel\num\ntightness in the chest a little fidgety\nokay um\nheart rate's increased okay so you're\nnoticing all these physical sensations\ngood\nare you afraid\na little bit but it's sort of like\nwell now i know what i have to do\nis having to do it does that feel like\ngood or bad\ni i think that feels good [ __ ] weird\nright so now i want to point out\nsomething very subtle in your language\nthis entire conversation we've been\ntalking about the outcome\nwe've been talking about people are\ngoing to be disappointed this is going\nto happen\nwe've been talking about the effects the\nresults\nthey're going to be disappointed to have\nme work with them anyway i'm destined to\nfail i'm going to fail out of college\ni'm going to be in debt\nthose are all outcomes they're not\nactions\nthe way to move forward in life it's\nwhat i have to do\nit's not about what happens it's about\nwhat i have to do it's about what you\nhave to do\nnot about what has to happen because you\ncan't [ __ ] control that\nand now we come to the crux of it which\nis as a human being in life you are\nentitled to your actions\nyou're not entitled to results\nyou have to work on your mind craft pack\nor whatever\nand write your description and upload it\nbecause that's what you have to do\nyou can't control whether people are\ngonna like it or gonna hate it\nyou could be traumatized because of how\nbad it is\nin their response so be it\ntrial and [ __ ] error my friend\nall right\nhow you feeling\num\ndetermined good\nright it's like kerbal space program\nlike sometimes stuff crashes but you\ngotta do it\nand so people say like oh just do it i'm\nnot saying just do it\nwhat i'm saying is like look at doing it\nrecognize the horrible fear that lives\nwithin you\nthe sense that you're a piece of [ __ ]\nand that you're inevitably going to\ndisappoint\nand give them the finger and then do it\nanyway\ndon't just do it recognize all of these\nthings that hold you back\nrecognize how terrible of a person\nyou've been taught that you\nare and then say you know what i'm not\ngoing to give into that\ni'm going to try anyway don't just do it\ndo it in spite of all of the reasons to\nnot do it\nyou're telling me that there's one road\nto success and there are a thousand\nroads to failure\nand what i'm telling you is that you can\nhave a thousand reasons to not do\nsomething\nand all you need is one to just [ __ ]\ndo it\nthat which you think holds you back in\nlife is actually like completely\nirrelevant\nthey can try to hold you back as much as\nthey want to for a thousand different\nreasons as real\nand all you need is one good reason to\nupload and you're gonna [ __ ] upload\nit and they can go [ __ ] themselves if\nthey don't like it\nall right how do you feel\num\nall right i feel all right okay all\nright\nokay good i'll take it you can open your\neyes\nall right man so that's what i got\nany questions\nso\nit's not about just doing it\nit's a it's about\ni'm gonna do it\nso don't just do it do it in spite of\neverything\nin spite of the thousand reasons\nthat that are holding me back\nbecause just do it absolutely just do it\nimplies\nignore all of these parts of yourself\njust just do it man just\nignore all that crap just ignore it and\njust do it i'm saying\nthat doesn't work you can't ignore it\nwhat you need to do is embrace it\nyou know it's like when you're playing\ndark souls you can't just pretend to\nhave chain mail and then just\njust just pretend that you've got\nchainmail and go and like\njust pretend ignore\nlive the life pretend you're in the life\nof your fantasy\nand act that way it doesn't work\nstart from where you are don't just do\nit you can't just\ndo it you have to do it anyway but\nyou've got to do it in spite of all the\nbaggage that you've got\nright you got to play the hand that\nyou're dealt not the hand that you want\nand that involves acknowledging and\naccepting that you have this fear\nthat you've been taught that you're\ndestined for failure\nit doesn't mean that it's actually true\nit's just what you were taught\nit's like people who are taught that the\nearth is flat\nit's just what you were taught doesn't\nmake it real\nright and now the flat earthers on\ntwitch are going to tell me\nbut so be it\nbut like that's cool man it's it's okay\nthat you think you're a failure it's\nokay that\nyou're inevitable to fail and then also\nlike\ncollect your own data as real because\nthis is not the life\nyou are not the person that your\nstepfather thinks you are you're the\nperson\nactually that you are you don't even\nknow who you are\nso try to collect some data\nand do it in spite of everything\nthen you'll succeed at least it's\nworked for me your mileage may vary\nall right all right man\nany last questions or thoughts that was\na great summary by the way\num i i think i'm good\nokay i'll i'll try and see what i can do\nthat's all we ask and what i will tell\nyou is that\nif you do have a link that we can share\non friday that would be awesome\ntoday is wednesday so that gives me two\ndays\nyep and at the same time\ntwitch chat how are we gonna feel about\nhim if we don't have a link\non friday\nwhat's our sentiment\nokay okay\nso i don't know if you can predict do\nyou can you imagine what\ntwitch had to say\ni want to say disappointed no they're\nnot going to be disappointed\napparently they're going to burn the\nworld down\nor they love you it's a little bit\nunclear\nso they're gonna riot they're not gonna\nbe disappointed\nthey're gonna riot or they'll they'll\nforgive you\nwhich so you know that's like right like\ntrial and error sometimes means that you\nget error it's not trial and success\nit's trial and error so it can be both\nso you know do the best that you can i\nsuspect twitch chat will forgive you\nbut also that they really do want to see\nthey want because here's the thing like\nhere's the thing\nif you can do it they can do it\nso there is a big burden on your\nshoulders which is that now you come\non on the stream and they're counting on\nyou\nand so i do i know it's crazy but i i i\nthink that you can disappoint them\nwhich is a real possibility on the other\nhand what you can also do since you're a\ncompassionate person is like\nyou can set your own feelings aside\nabout judgment\nand recognize that if you can share with\nus a link on friday sure there's a lot\nof pressure and i recognize i'm putting\nit on you\nbut like that's what people see right\nlike they want to see progress\nand you can give them hope which is a\nbig burden to place on your shoulders\nbut i'm telling you um asriel i can't do\nthis alone\nwe need we need your mind crackling\nall right all right so it seems like\nthey love you it's apparently one person\nwants to smell you\ni don't think they do it's a little hot\nhere\nbe careful i mean don't assume that you\nknow what twitch chat wants\noh oh right because they'll be like\nchallenge accepted\nthat they want my urine or bathwater or\nwhatever\nright that's oh boy\nall right man this is turning south real\nquick so i'm gonna say goodbye\nand good luck and um i look forward to\nhearing from you man and and no sweat if\nyou can't\nall right all right take care man all\nright you too\nbye bye okay\nchat\nyeah so that's you know that's life\nyou're you're trying to\ngraduate from college and then suddenly\nyou know your sense and odors become\nthe rage of the internet\nand and really i want you guys to like\nthink long and hard if you guys struggle\nwith this kind of over analysis fear of\nfailure thing\nbecause this is a very poorly understood\num little mechanism which is that\nthe reason we overthink is to alleviate\nfear from ourselves but the funny thing\nis that the more we think the smarter we\nare\nthe more possibilities our mind\ngenerates\nabout how things can go wrong and it's a\nvicious cycle because if i generate 10\npossibilities\nthen i need to think through each of\nthose to remove that fear\nand each time i think about removing the\nfear i generate more possibilities\nand this is why we get stuck\nhow do i overcome the fear of failure\nfirst you understand where the fear of\nfailure comes from\nand then you recognize that your\nsolutions to the fear of failure\nare actually propagating their feel of\nfailure and no wonder y'all can't\novercome it\nit's like how many holes do i need to\npoke\nin my tire to fill it up with air\nbecause the more holes that i put in my\ntire the more places air can go in\nhow many holes do i need to poke and\nit's like no man you don't poke holes\nit's bizarre but the solutions that our\nmind sometimes comes up with\nare actually the very problem that keeps\nus paralyzed\nand so the way that you overcome your\nfear of failures first of all in\nrecognizing that over analysis can make\nit worse\nrecognizing that the fear of failure is\nbuilt upon\ncertain impressions that you have of\nyourself\nand that those impressions may have been\ntrue of the past but they're not\nnecessarily representative of the future\nand the third thing is that you don't\nreally overcome your fear of failure\nthat too is fantasy\nit's sort of like i overcome my fear of\nfailure and then i can go live my life\nright it's like shifting to the the\ntrack of easy success\nonce i overcome my fear of failure then\ni can start living my life\nthat in of itself is the wrong attitude\nyou never overcome your feeling\nyou just live your life in spite of it\nso that which you're afraid of\nthink about doing it try to do it and as\nyou try to do it\nclose your eyes and pay attention to\nyourself and you're going to feel that\nthat serpent coil up\nthe fear is going to uncoil because it's\nbeen living deep down in your belly\nand it's going to rise up and it's going\nto take over the rest of your body\nand when it does that be like just sit\nwith it for a second say okay can i do\nit anyway\nyou don't overcome your feeling fear of\nfailure you act in spite of it\nand when you start acting in spite of\nthings\ninstead of trying to fix them before you\nact then you'll stop being stuck\nbecause you guys want to fix everything\nbefore you do anything\ni better start working out so i don't\nembarrass myself at the gym\nit's like backwards but it makes sense\nso don't try to fix things just do\nthings\njust do things don't just do things\nrecognize that\ntry to do something and notice what\ncomes up and give yourself some time and\nsome space\nthat some of these battles you're going\nto win and some of them you're going to\nlose sometimes the fear is going to win\nand sometimes you're going to act in\nspite of the fear and the cool thing\nthat happens\nis like as you act in spite of the fear\nwhat actually happens is when you can\nact in spite of the fear\nthen next time around the fear isn't as\npowerful\nbecause it's like oh that fear was\npredicting all these problems and that\nactually didn't work\nand so this tiny voice is going to start\nto grow with inside\ninside you it's like oh maybe i don't\nneed to worry about the fear\nand then you struggle again and the fear\nrises up\nsometimes you win sometimes you lose you\nact again and it's like oh\nmaybe i didn't need to worry about it\nit's not so bad\nand the more that you do that that's\ncalled confidence\nand confidence isn't about in this last\nthing i'll kind of like explain\nso analysis to\nbypass fear or negate fear does not lead\nto\nconfidence in fact all it does is like\ngive in to the fear\nbecause you're accepting the fear it's\nnot courage it's removing fear from the\nequation\nthat's not overcoming your fear that's\njust removing it from the equation\nconfidence is about acting in the face\nof uncertainty\nbecause you believe that you can manage\nwhat comes\nright if you're like confident in a\nvideo game and like let's say it's a\nmultiplayer game\nyou're like confident that like there\ncould be a good person on the other team\nbut like i'm gonna be able to handle it\nand i'm gonna do the best that i can\nsome games i'll win some games i'll lose\nand so if you want to build confidence\nand overcome fear\ndon't try to solve so that the fear is\nno longer an issue that's not how you do\nit it's in fact it's the exact opposite\nthe way you do it is by like actually\nacting in spite of the fear and then you\nrealize oh like the fear doesn't\nactually have a hold on me\nyou guys don't need to overcome the fear\nyou need to be like\nbuff your fear resistance and the fear\ncan be whatever it wants to but if\nyou've got like\n90 fear resistance then like it's not\ngoing to control you anymore\nso hopefully that makes sense it's not\nignorance\nit's actually pure awareness it's the\nopposite of ignorance\nit's acknowledging and understanding\nthat sometimes the fear will control you\nand sometimes it won't and that the more\nthat you practice and the more you try\nthe less it'll start to control you and\nthen you'll start to believe in yourself\nand then the fear can be as big as it is\nbut your confidence is going to be big\ntoo and you'll be able to handle it\nyeah you have to level up your fear\nresistance absolutely okay twitch who\nare you rating"
