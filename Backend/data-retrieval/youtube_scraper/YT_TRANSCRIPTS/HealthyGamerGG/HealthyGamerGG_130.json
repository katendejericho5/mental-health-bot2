of like\nthings about moving your life forward\nand they struggle with motivation in\nthese\nthings it's because when I don't think\nI'm worth\nit I'm not worth fixing\n[Music]\nm\n[Music]\n[Music]\nm\n[Music]\nall righty chat let's get started\nwelcome to another healthy gamer GG\nstream just a reminder that although I'm\na psychiatrist nothing we discussed on\nstream today is intended to be taken as\nmedical advice everything is for\neducational or entertainment purposes\nonly if yall have a concern or question\nplease go see licensed professional\nwelcome chat Lords and chat ladies today\nwe are going to be interviewing the one\nthe only pirate software or\nThor which is a cool name which I think\nwe talked about last time um we had an\nawesome interview last time we're going\nto have an awesome interview I'm sure\nthis time I don't really know what we're\ngoing to be talking about there's no\nparticular like uh topic or anything\nwe're just going to be chilling we're\ngoing to be vibing um Thor is just so\ninsightful we can just listen to him\ntalk about whatever and maybe we'll\nlearn something about meditation or the\nmind or the soul or Psychiatry or\nneuroscience and Maybe not maybe we'll\njust try to understand a little bit\nabout what's going on in the world today\nso before we hop in with uh\nThor we are going to take a quick look\nat something cool so this\nmonth\nevery every May which is mental health\nawareness month which we' been we've\nbeen doing for 5 years now isn't that\ncrazy chat that we've been like\nstreaming for 5 years we've been doing\nthis stuff for a while\nnow maybe four years I don't know I\nthought I started streaming in 2019 at\nthe end of the year so maybe this is\nfour years I don't know\nanyway so we we do community challenges\nevery May and they tend to be awesome so\nthese are uh these are things that we do\nwe connive to help y'all improve your\nlife in a more structured way so what we\ndo here on stream and when we lecture\nand we upload videos and all that like\nall that's fantastic there's a slight\nproblem though which is that watching\nstuff on the internet doesn't\nnecessarily transform your life so\nthat's why we run these Community\nchallenges um they are much beloved by\nthe community it looks like we have\n476,000 points accumulated so\nfar um so make it is a month-long event\nfor healthy gamer uh partic participants\nengage in Practical creative and\ncollaborative tasks focused on the theme\nof together we can make it through okay\nso um we if we hit a million we're doing\nokay we're like almost halfway through\nMay so like we got to pick up the pace a\nlittle bit I get to do a pickup Artist\nreview stream so I will be commenting on\npickup artists which is something that I\nsecretly want to do if we go super far\nwe may see a guru stream arrive at 1.25\nmillion we get Cru these M AR but the\nwhole point is to um week one make a\nplan so this focuses on making concrete\nplans goal setting and time management\nweek two make connections this week\nfocuses on building healthy\nrelationships communities and networks\nweek three Make Your Mark focuses on\nusing creative skills and\nself-expression to enhance our mental\nhealth Journeys and week four is make a\ndifference using skills and passions to\nmake positive actual change in the lives\nof others so this is what people have\nbeen doing so 20 things that I'm proud\nof\nabout myself so this is cool like you\nknow it's about has completed my\nstrength so like understanding what your\nstrengths are and there's a lot of like\nscience that shows that that spending\ntime thinking about this stuff actually\nlike basically improves self-esteem we\ncan go into this in more detail if yall\nwant to but like there's a lot of great\nstuff about cultivating particular\nthoughts and when your mind thinks in a\nparticular direction it does have a\npositive impact so some of the goals of\nthings like cognitive reframing and\nPsychotherapy is to change the way that\nyou think and the more that you think in\na healthy way the healthier your mind\nwill become and the more successful\nyou'll become now there's a subtle way\nto do this it's not just like the power\nof positive thinking it's not always see\nthe Silver Lining um there there are\nparticular ways that you can do this\nthat is effective and sometimes if you\nlike power positive thinking if you do\nthat too much it can actually be\ntoxic um completed a has completed a\ngood review interesting so they like\nreviewed something on the Internet\nthat's\ncool um has completed an elevator pitch\nthis is awesome right so this is the\nkind of stuff that we want yall to\npractice because this will help you in\nreal life right so hi I'm blank I'm a\nneuroscientist neuroscientist received\nmy PhD a year ago I specialize in\ncognitive neuroscience and can provide\ngood judgment on Research topics I want\nto make new discoveries in the mind and\ncontribute to advancements in field here\nare my contacts if you want to keep in\ntouch and I would love to hear more\nabout job opportunities you have on your\nteam so this is like super cool right so\nI think this is\nlike I mean there's a lot of stuff where\nwe say like oh I need to get a job I\nneed to make more money but what are the\nactual subsequent components of\naccomplishing that right so that's what\nwe're trying to structure for y'all and\ngive y'all like a a carrot dangling in\nfront of you so that you do stuff that's\nactually good for yourself and so you\nall should definitely par participate\nand like you know start putting your\nlives together let's see okay this one\nis um so this is good so it's completed\nhow I want to be treated so how I want\nto be treated and then like listing that\nout right so if we think about how do we\nstay in unhealthy relationships we stay\nin unhealthy relationships by\nwaffling over what we're Worth right and\nwe constantly justify that it's okay\nthat this person treats me this way\nbecause of XYZ and like sitting down and\narticulating what you want from the\nworld is like very very helpful from a\ncognitive perspective so I I don't know\nif this kind of makes sense but there\nare studies that show that if you think\nthrough a task before you do it you will\nmore likely there's a greater likelihood\nof success so this is something called\noperationalizing and when it comes to\nour relationships like all this stuff\nthat we've figured out in the business\nworld we don't apply to our\nrelationships so you can operationalize\nyour relationship like you can think\nabout okay what do I want in my\nrelationships and simply the act of\nthinking about it and writing it down\ncan have some kind of\nimpact right like we're not sure exactly\nI don't know what particular outcome\nyou'll see from that I've never seen a\nstudy that shows you know doing this\nparticular exercise has this particular\noutcome but it Taps into principles that\nhave been scientifically\ndemonstrated um yeah so definitely check\nout make it may and without further Ado\nI'm going see if Thor is ready\nyes I'm calling you over Discord my dude\nlet's see if you\nanswer hello hello wait I gotta fix this\nis it gonna work fix it there we go\ncheck here I'm gonna turn down your\nvolume a touch can you count to 10 for\nme one two three four five six 7 8 9 10\nperfect I think that's great okay I\ndon't see your your\nface yeah I'm going to raid I'm in a\nraid one moment okay uh all right we're\ngoing chat I didn't burn the entire que\noh this is guest name but I\ntried we're\nrating we're raing here it\ngoes I'm going to tell all the YouTube\npeople about you as well here you\ngoooo okay goodbye everyone 62 short\nfrom the end of the queue so\nclose what what's going on oh uh one sec\nthe Raider's out thank you you don't\nhave to raid by the way yeah but I'm\ndoing it\nokay where're we're we're here for the\nmemes not the viewers that's totally\nfine I want them to to be able to see\nyour stuff doing good\nactually virtual camera is that working\nnow let's\nsee I know that you in the field of\ncomputer but if you're oh there we go if\nyou're struggling I can use my racial\nbonus to tech support oh is that is that\nwhat you get you get a racial bonus to\nthat so I'm I'm you know I'm the kind of\nperson who like I've just gone through\nlife and I've never like gotten\nproficiency skill in computers I've just\nbeen writing that racial bonus it all\nMak sense I I don't I don't know what my\nracial bonus is I'm just like generic\nwhite guy so like what do I get I mean\nyour your name is Thor that is true I\nyou have racial bonus to axis you have\nracial racial bonus to hair that's true\nI do have that I have that bonus racial\nbonus axes and hair possibly drinking\nmaybe I you I do have a high tolerance I\njust don't use it yeah so\nthat's funny how you been man so you're\ndoing good yeah doing really good in\nfact I've I've been able to execute on\npretty much all the things that I wanted\nto of the last like when was the last\ntime we talked how many months has it\nbeen dude it's been a while but I I\nabsolutely loved our conversation I have\nno idea what I don't remember what we\ntalked about but I remember just\nthoroughly enjoying it yeah it was super\nawesome actually a lot of the community\nPops in all the time and they're like I\njust saw your Dr K video it's super\nawesome so like no it was super fun to\ntalk about man I really enjoyed it as\nwell G me a lot of stuff to think about\nand kind of doubled down on all the\nthings that I was doing oh really\ninteresting can you tell me about that\nyeah yeah so like the stuff that I was\ndoing with the ferret rescue right so\nI've kind of expanded the idea out for\nthat now where we're going to be\nbuilding the largest F rescue in in the\nUnited States is the idea um I've gotten\na piece of land so I moved or I'm in the\nprocess of moving we're waiting on the\ncounty has finally approved the project\nto be able to build fiber there which is\nis huge so we're going to be able to\nbuild a building that is going to be the\nlargest fa rescue in the United States\nI'm going all in on that having a lot of\nfun with it and hiring in people that\nare going to be full-time uh Veterinary\nwork and and management for that so they\ncan run it and then we can have that as\na side thing and uh yeah that's that's\nkind of like the big thing that I'm\ndoing with that the game Jam that I was\nrunning actually exploded so we did 1400\ngames for that we ended up giving out\n$30,000 to the winners of that so we've\nhelped fund those new new aspiring\nStudios for that so that was a huge\nwinning for that and then um I'm looking\ninto either building a publishing house\nor working with a Publishing House to\ntry and direct that to help with new\nIndies wanting to get published in that\ndirection so that's made me pretty happy\nwith that that's a that's a really\nlong-term goal of mine that I had had\nand it's much more attainable now also I\nhired on all of my moderators so\neverybody is now well six of them are\nsalaried right now we're starting with\nhalf the team then we're going to do the\nother half the team once we make sure\nthat all this is financially stable\nenough to do it and uh they all get\nbenefits so medical benefits dental\nvision\nuh all the healthcare stuff that I can\nthrow at it basically and and retirement\nas well for all of that and I've set it\nup in a corporation so the corporation's\nfinally done did an es Corp so there's\nno way that I could ever IPO it it has\nto be you know I can never go back on\nthat promise we structured in that way\nto get rid of any perceptions that could\nhappen and then made sure that all of\nthat was done in a way where basically\nthe employees are going to be taken care\nof as much as possible because I can't\ndo this without them they can't do it\nwithout me that's awesome dude so\nbasically just executed on everything I\nwanted to yeah so so um can you tell me\na little a little bit about what is game\nJam so a game Jam is a whole lot of\npeople want to make video games right\nand they may not have sort of the the\ndrive to do it they're like I don't know\nif I want to do this I don't know how to\nstart I don't know where to do this so\nyou give them a two-e period and you say\nyou have a theme this is the theme for\nthe game gam it'll be something\nridiculous our last one was um it's\nspreading right so you're like you're\ngoing to make a game around spreading\nmechanics in some way whatever it's\ngoing to be and they build that game as\na prototype and then they submit it and\nthen we vote on it and then we get them\nfeedback and we try to basically build\nthis environment where they feel safe\nfailing you you should fail doing this\nit's likely that you will not succeed so\nyou get a a really good safe environment\nto fail at you learn a bunch of stuff\nand then you move forward as a Game Dev\nand if you win it is likely that you\nwill be able to take that to be a game\nthat you can go and sell on steam or\nshow other people or whatever we want to\ndo with it at that point you get a bunch\nof accolades and things like that so\npeople build a game in two weeks yes oh\nyeah and it will usually be a prototype\nthat's kind of junky right but like they\nget the core an idea of something that's\nreally good really compelling and then\nthey can expand that out into the future\nwe've already gotten dozens of games\nthat have contacted us and said like hey\nI'm planning on building a studio out of\nthis now thank you for doing the game\nJam I'm so inspired to do this or people\nthat say you know I didn't I didn't\nfinish or like but but I I never felt\nlike I was comfortable enough to make a\ngame I didn't think I could so they went\ndid it the first one I ever did like\nthis I actually tricked our community\ninto learning which was quite funny so\nmany people were like I don't want to do\nthat I can't make a game I can't program\nand I was like okay then we won't won't\ndo a game Jam about making a video game\nwe'll do a game Jam about what you would\ndo if you did make a video game so they\ncreated what's called a game design\ndocument which is you make a piece of\npaper that says everything you would do\non the if you made a game all the tools\nyou would work with all the things that\nyou would learn everything you needed to\nknow how you would plan it out and then\nthat was the first week of the game Jam\nI was like it's just a week long Jam\nafter the week was over I said okay\nsecond week bonus round go make the\nPrototype and they went well I already\nknow how I'm not afraid anymore I did\nall the research now it's easy and and\ndid it we had um I think it was 98% of\nthe teams actually went forward and made\na prototype on our first game Jam as a\nresult that's awesome dude yeah it's\nit's also interesting because that\nreminds me of something that we do in\nPsychotherapy which is um so if someone\ndoesn't want to talk about something we\nuse this technique called going meta so\nsomeone says like oh I don't want to\ntalk about my relationships and you know\nit's totally fine to respect boundaries\nwe don't NE the goal isn't to push um\nbut what we'll do is we'll ask people\ncan you help me understand why you don't\nwant to talk about it totally fine we\ndon't have to talk about it but what's\nyour reason so what we do is like here\nis the thing that is psychologically\nactivating and what we want to do is\nmove one layer like meta or one layer\nlike remove from it and talk about the\nobstacle to the thing that is that is\nscary and it almost sounds like y all\nstumbled into that or thought of that\nright which is like okay we're not going\nto actually make a game we're GNA we're\ngoing to do something else that feels\nemotionally safer and moves us closer to\nthe topic and then we often times find\nthat that's very effective at getting\npeople to like open up yeah the basic\nidea I had about it was like cuz I have\na background in Social Engineering right\nit's part of my job part of my work and\nI was like the the one thing that's\nstopping people is they're afraid and\nthey're mostly afraid not because of\nanything other than they just don't know\nwhat it takes and because they don't\nknow what it takes they're worried about\nfailing so I was like well what if we\nstructure that around exposing them to\nWhat It Takes and do it in a way where\nit doesn't matter if they fail or not\nand it worked and end up working really\nreally well so it was kind of stumbling\ninto that frankly yeah that's\nGeneral understanding what is social\nengineering so social engineering is\nwhen you were trying to either\nmanipulate a situation to get a certain\noutcome with another person right or um\nI use it more often to try and figure\nout what somebody needs in order to move\nforward and move past the thing that's\nblocking them a lot of the times I used\nit when I was in you know offensive\nsecurity to try and get into areas of\naccess that I wasn't supposed to be in I\nroleplay as a character or I do anything\nlike that to try and move forward to do\nthat you know to try and trick them into\nletting me have access where I shouldn't\nhave access or get information out of an\nemployee that I shouldn't have a good\nexample of this is let's say you're a\ncustomer service representative and I\ncall in and while I'm talking to you\nabout my customer service problem that I\nhave I say hey I'm thinking about\napplying at your business and uh I'm\nwondering you know I can't really cook\nI'm not good at that can you tell me\nwhat like the best places to eat in the\narea because I'll be there pretty soon\nfor an interview and then you tell me\nwhere you eat in the area and now I know\nwhere to go to be able to clone your\nbadge if I need to break into your\noffice that is part of social\nengineering it's starting kind of a\nsituation like that for an ulterior\nmotive is the idea and that's kind of\nwhat that first game Jam was the\nalterior motive was to get people to\nlearn so you can do it for good reasons\nbut yeah that's so that's so interesting\nso what what so this is not coding what\nyou're what social engineering is it's\npeople dissection right yeah Behavior\nBehavior freaking no freaking is phone\nhacking so this is behavioral analysis\nsocial engineering is it's a very common\nthing it usually comes down to acting\nand understanding body language and\nbehavior but a lot of that is done by\nintuition not through reading it is\nthrough learning that every time I\nlearned it hilariously from playing\nDungeons and Dragons because I roleplay\nas a DM like I'm a DM and I have to role\nplay a bunch of characters and I can see\nthe immediate emotional response for my\nplayers so I know how to act in certain\nways streaming does the same thing for\nyou as well you immediately react to how\nchat is reacting you see the things that\nyou say if they function or don't\nfunction how you say things the\ninflection that you all of that kind of\nstuff super important that's so\nfascinating CU you said role play as a\nDM and I was like oh that's interesting\nwere you were you playing Ro characters\nas a DM yeah who was pretending to be a\nDM like that would be yeah pretending to\nbe one yeah no\ndefinitely um I pretend to be a DM yeah\nand uh I do sometimes it's good\nyeah that that's so fascinating so it\nsounds like you've uh and the social\nengineering stuff is I think a really\ninteresting topic of discussion because\nthat that too is something that so it\nsounds like a lot of what you do is very\nsimilar actually in a lot of ways to\nwhat what we do or what I do which is\nalso trying to help people understand\nwhat makes them tick and how to make\ntasks easier for you to complete how to\nunderstand your mind and like how it\nworks in your brain um yeah and so\nthat's super cool yours comes from a a\nvery different background than mine\nthough like mine is very intuition based\nso there are going to be gaps for me\nlike 100% And I think that's really\ninteresting I think it's interesting\nthat you have kind of two that lead to\nthe same goal there in different ways oh\ngive me a second this is my hey what's\nup okay yeah I'll balance them more all\nright I needed to I need to make an\naudio adjustment all right hopefully\nthat's better count to 10 for me one two\nthree four be better yeah okay it's\nshowing been balanced yeah finally Happ\nso you know it's interesting that you\nsay that there's going to be gaps in\nyours um I mean I think that is\nundoubtedly objectively true but I think\none of the things that I've learned\nabout sort of like this dichotomy\nbetween like science and spirituality so\nif you look at like Psychotherapy versus\nlike let's say meditation\ntraining the yogis and these like\nBuddhist monks and people like that they\nsort of had a sample size of one and\nthey were just interested in the\nsubjective they were not interested in\num objectively what is correct for all\nof humanity they were interested in what\nworks for an individual\nyeah so their their laboratory was a\nsingle\nperson the interesting thing about the\nWestern perspective we think it's\nSuperior because it's scientific and\nscientific is about objective Truth The\nChallenge is that the application of\nscience to an individual has a big gap\nso even though we have a study that\nshows that cognitively reframing is\nhealthy it doesn't teach us how to\ncognitively reframe\nso that is actually subjective process\nso so I think when when you say it's\nprimarily intuition I mean that I think\nis an interesting thought but I think\nthat just because it is subjective or a\npersonal exploration does not mean that\nit is inferior to science I think it's\nexperiential more I guess is better than\nthe intuition way of saying that it's\nmore experiential so it's it's based on\nmy experiences and it's based in uh not\nin a clinical setting it's more in a in\na you know out in the world setting yeah\nso yeah that makes more sense definitely\nyeah that it'd be interesting to kind of\ncompare notes yeah definitely I think\nthe biggest Gap that I get in that\nregard is terminology there's going to\nbe terminology like I said last time\nterminology is just going to be missing\nbecause of that because it's it's like I\nlearned this thing out in the street you\nknow yeah no but I I think that that the\nterminology is it's really interesting\nbecause you mentioned that because\nthere's actually a an interesting study\nI forget what it's called it's some\nreport back in the early 1900s there was\na so medical education was not\nstandardized so like you had all these\nMed schools that were just teaching\nwhatever the hell they wanted so there\nwas some report I'm blanking on the name\nthat um analyzed like the different\nmedical schools and like tried to figure\nout like okay is there any consensus\nhere and in the process of that report\nthey also point out that medical jargon\nis specifically obtuse yeah to try to\nkeep regular people from understanding\nand preserve the status of like a\nmedical doctor that's why they use Latin\nfor everything instead of just saying\nlike oh you have like you know\nosteoarthritis as opposed to my my knee\nhurts yeah um so it's it's really\ninteresting because the terminology is\nactually used to\ngatekeep yeah I I think it's actually\nfunny is that reminds me of Idiocracy\nthough because if you go too far in the\nother direction you end up getting\nsomething that makes no sense you're\nlike oh my bones suck you know like okay\nbut what does that mean you know like\nyeah there's a lack of precision yeah a\nlittle bit yeah we see that I think a\nlot with our emotional vocabulary where\nwe're not precise about what we feel and\nwhat we think um I I think a lot of\ntimes people lack the kind of words to\nexpress that though not not to discredit\nor say that that's that's like their\nfault or anything it's just many people\ndon't talk about emotions they don't\ntalk about their feelings and like\nSociety doesn't like you to do that a\nlot of the times frankly and I think\nthat sucks yeah yeah I I think it's it's\nabsolutely something that is discouraged\nso one of the the best examples that I\ncan think of is that everyone says that\ncommunication is important for a\nrelationship you know they'll ask you\nlike oh like you've been married for 40\nyears what's the secret they'll say like\ncommunication communication\ncommunication what do that means yeah\nyeah what does that mean so one yeah go\nahead super common it's it's just a\nsuper common thing and it's true it's\nlike communication matters but it's like\nwhat what does that communication entail\nit means telling your partner you're\nupset it means telling him that you\nupset that you don't like the thing\nthat's going on telling him why you\ndon't like that thing it means and to\nhonest with you sometimes it means\nFighting Man sometimes it means having a\nverbal argument not a physical argument\nobviously but a verbal argument about\nsomething is sometimes that's what\nwhat's needed if there's an emotional\nthing on the table and it's it's deeply\ndistressing having a verbal argument\nabout it is normal there's nothing wrong\nwith that just don't make it bad you\nknow like don't okay take it too far I\nthink that's that's certainly an\nimportant part I I think one of the\nthings that worries me there are a\ncouple times that you know I've talked\nto people about their relationship and\none of the things that actually worries\nme one of the things I consider sort of\na yellow flag or red flag is a lack of\nconflict yeah so of I learned that in\nthe past in relationships mind it's like\nwow it's perfect until it wasn't and we\ndidn't have any practice fighting we had\nno practice having arguments the entire\ntime and then we had an argument and it\nwas real bombastic and that sucked you\nknow and it actually it self-destructed\nthe relationship because it was like we\nwent from this Whiplash of just like\nperfect perfect perfect everything's\nfine too we fought you know verbal\nargument real bad couldn't recover from\nit cuz there's no there's no like\ngetting rid of the stress over time it\nwas just like a powder kick it was like\na pressure cooker right so it all goes\noff at once you have to you have to\nargue sometimes you have to make that\n known it's interesting I I I did a\nlecture a couple months ago I think we\nuploaded it to YouTube about how red\nflags early in relationships are good so\nlike this really yeah it's super\nfascinating So like um like I would say\n50% of successful relationships that\nI've seen as a psychiatrist I don't do a\nwhole lot of coup's counseling so I have\na lot of patients who have very healthy\nrelationships and when I ask them about\nlike the start of their\nrelationship um they're like they're\nusually red flags like in in half of the\ncases they're like solid red flags so in\none case uh 22y old what kind yeah a\n22-year-old um with basically no career\nprospects uh asking out a\n16-year-old right so big big big big big\nno no um with with awareness so there\nwas nothing Shady so like the person\nlike went over to the 16-year-old's\nhouse and was like hey I would like to\ntake your daughter on a date and parents\nwere actually like okay with it um and\nhow old was a person\n22 oh man maybe\n21 even then yeah so right that's what\nI'm saying they they're like they're\nhappily married now and like they've\nbeen married for you know like 20 some\nodd years and they've got kids in a life\nand and all this good like it's it's\ncrazy started weird started weird\nstarted weird and and the interesting\nthing is that you know the the parents\nwere really like like cuz the the the\nthe guy was quite I mean they were like\nquite impressed and they're like this\nguy seems like respectful and decent and\nalso like seems like to really care\nabout you know\nshe's I be like that hey look I'm\ntelling y'all it's it's red flag is\nearly I'm not I'm not suggesting that\nyou date 16y old red flag yeah yeah\nthat's I've seen it so another another\nreally good one is like uh so two people\nmet at a professional event like a\nconference and then they like text back\nand forth and they like make it a point\nto like go to conferences where like one\nperson is and that's like the start of\ntheir relationship where like hey are\nyou going to this conference okay like\nif you're coming then I'm coming and\nit's like they're not not dating they're\njust texting back and forth and then\nthey like show up and for a period of\nlike a year they're just meeting\nrandomly at conferences for like you\nknow every two or 3 months M and and so\nthat that's the kind of thing where it's\nlike you know flying halfway across the\ncountry to see someone that you're not\ndating and you've got a professional\nreason to do it like you can go to the\nconference and make it worthwhile but to\ndo that repeatedly like you know another\nred flly it's a little weird it's a\nlittle weird I I don't know if that\none's as big of a red flag to me it's\njust a little strange yeah it's like\nthere's there's various kinds you know\nyeah there definitely yeah different\nkinds I think the interesting thing is\nthat when you have a red flag early it\ngives you an opportunity to like work\nthrough some\nnegativity and so what tends to happen\nwhen we look for green flags is it's\nexactly what you described which is like\noh this person's great great great great\ngreat great great and there aren't like\nchallenges and then when a challenge\ncomes along like your your ability to\ndeal with challenges is like\nunderleveled whereas when you're with\nsomeone who there's some kind of\nconflict early on like it lets you level\nup your conflict resolution skills I\nthink that actually happens over time\nwith multiple relationships too like as\nyou have relationships throughout your\nlife you will have ones that fail and\nyou learn stuff from each one of those\nand you get better at conflict\nresolution you get better at\ncommunicating you get better at finding\nout what's the Line in the Sand for you\nright of like what works for you as a\nperson and what you need in a\nrelationship and I think many people\ndon't really realize that they're like I\nhad a bad relationship now I never have\none again it's like no you will you'll\nhave more you should have more and\nyou'll get better at it it's a skill\nlike everything else right yeah I think\nthis theme of being safe to fail I think\nthat's the challenge is I see that so\nmuch um in relationships which whereas\npeople instead of thinking about it as\nsomething that you will get better at\nbetter at over time you have a\nrelationship and if one person considers\nyou Unworthy of love then a lot of\npeople will make a conclusion in their\nmind once again not their fault that\nthat I am\nunlovable um it's funny you see the same\nthing in work as odd as that is when\nsomeone gets laid off from a job it's\nvery similar in terms of the reaction\nwhich is I got laid off from a job I am\nworthless because I tied my emotional\nself to the status of that job or I tied\nmy emotional self to the status of that\nrelationship that's never healthy I\nnever think that is at all like you are\nstill an individual person outside of\nthat and I find that happens far often\nvery very often yeah so there there's a\nlot of interesting uh Neuroscience\nevolutionary psychology and kind of like\nyogic stuff around that so the the tying\nof the\nself to a particular aspect is something\nthat speaking of terminology in Sanskrit\nthis called the aamar or the ego right\nso like we have huh when I actually know\noh okay so that's what I actually know\nyeah so the the ego is when our ego gets\ntied up into something and I think this\nis something that's so confusing for\npeople is that they don't realize that\nthey are not their ego so I have a\nconception of who I am which is not who\nI am it is just a conception I I found\nsome of that is is also very cultural um\nso like I've been to France before and\nsomething I found in France is if you\nask someone what do you do they don't\ntell you their job they tell you their\nHobbies they tell you their interests\nthey tell you things that they like and\nyou're like no but what do you what do\nyou do but here in America you say what\ndo you do and they're like oh this is my\njob yeah so like it's a defining Factor\nhere where it's not a defining Factor\nthere of what you do for a living right\nand I I think that ties the emotional\nstatus to that much more because like\nyour title Your Role is who you are here\nand that's not the same everywhere yeah\nit's it's a great point I think it's\nabsolutely\ncultural\num anyway what I don't think either one\nis wrong they're just different you know\nyeah so the yogis would say that all\nidentification on some level is wrong\nwhether you identify with being yeah so\ninteresting yeah how do you have a sense\nof I guess you don't have a sense of\nself at that point you wouldn't have one\nno no you all you have is a sense of\nself you don't have an\nidentity so sense of self without\nidentity I understand okay I think I\nunderstand what you mean so sense of\nself with completely without identity\nyou don't have the extraneous fact they\ndefining who you are AB yeah the\ninternal Factor so so the best way I\nwould describe it as like if you're on a\ndesert island for an hour and you close\nyour eyes and you just exist on the\ndesert island and imagine that in that\nhour what you experience is the entirety\nof your\nlife okay right so then like you're not\ngoing to have a social like you'll exist\nyou'll be there you'll perceive things\nyou'll enjoy things you'll be frustrated\nby things but this overarching sense of\nidentity that carries over from day to\nday you just exist for that one hour\nright you don't have that broader\nidentity you don't have a social\nidentity and then the really interesting\nthing is that if you really look at your\nlife your life is a string of those\nhours right your your life is just\nexisting this moment and then existing\nand then all of all of our sense of\nidentity is actually abstractions that\nare strong together they're not based on\nour experiences they're external there\nexternal factors that we apply to that\nto tie them together if that makes tying\ntogether is the right is the right\noperative work right so when we string\ntogether a set of experiences like a\ngood example someone who thinks they're\na loser there's no such thing as a loser\nthey look at all the negative pieces and\nthey say I'm a loser because yes they\nthey string together unique experiences\nwhereas those things are losses so you\ncan lose but the identity of a loser is\nnot something that is like a physical\nreality it's not real yeah it's not it's\na per it's a perception issue that's\nreally all is yeah and and when things\nare fed through the ego when our ego is\nthe one that is doing the perceiving\nthen we end up with all kinds of\nperception issues yep no that makes a\nlot of sense I can understand that no\nyeah no it's it's always interesting to\nsee like perception drives reality more\nthan anything else it's it is absolutely\nthe case and you get people that are\nstuck in these weird perceptive Loops\nwhere they're like I suck they're like\nwell why do you suck and they're like\nbecause I made a mistake when I was 12\nyou know like it's like but look at all\nthe stuff you've done outside of that\nright look at all the things that you've\ndone since then what all all the things\nyou've accomplished you like you live on\nyour own you have you have your own your\nown place to live you have your own job\nwhatever it's going to be you've\naccomplished all these goals you have a\ncool relationship yeah but I made a\nmistake when I was 12 like okay like you\nhave to that kind of a perception can\ntear someone down even though it's it's\nnot based in reality it's based in just\nthat you know that little piece of a\nmemory that doesn't really matter yeah I\nI I think uh like I'm on the shtick\nrecently where over the last year I've\nbeen focusing a lot like in my own life\nand with people that I work with on\nperception so I think perception is the\none aspect of cognition that we tend to\nnot\nunderdeveloping our perception we'll\nthink about improving our logic even our\nemotional\nawareness um we'll do certain cognitive\nskills to improve things like o like\nbecome more productive overcome emotions\nthe one thing that I think is actually\nthe worst thing in society right now is\nthat everyone's perception has become\nvery very weak so like I agree no I\nfully agree with that we see it mostly\non uh social media you see it mostly on\nsocial media you have people that have\nextremely like extreme opinions rather\nthan having nuanced approaches to things\nthey don't know how to perceive anything\nbeyond the exact thing that they've\nhyperfocused on in that one area they\ndon't know how to see a greater picture\nbeyond that e and it usually comes\nacross as they don't want to that\nthey're they're being you know jerks or\nanything like that a lot of people who\nare in those positions don't believe\nthat they're being jerks they're just\nhyper fixated on one little tiny thing\nand their perception isn't wide enough\nto see the rest of the picture on that\nand that's not like a that's not like a\nmalicious thing a lot of the times it's\njust a failure to expand the perception\nand I it sucks right it's made the\ninternet really toxic it really has so I\nI think that that there I would agree\nthat social media and especially like\nthese short form pieces of stuff don't\nadd for so so the the smaller the bit of\ncontent is Yeah the\nmore our mind has to fill in to add it\npeople are trained to get a dopamine\nRush from that short content when it's\nnot even when it's not positive\nwhen it's destructive yeah yeah so so I\nI wouldn't say they're trained I'd say\nit's it's taking advantage of a\nbiological certainty sure yeah right and\nit's it's not it's not so what we know\nis that or my running Theory I think\nthere's plenty of support for this is\nthat um emotional oscillation is what\nkeeps people engaged in\ncontent okay so I could see that if it's\ntoo dope and energic you'll actually\ndevelop tolerance it's just like if you\nplay a video game for 10 hours like\nyou're not having fun on hour eight the\nreason you continue to play is because\nof other mechanisms it's not fun right\nit's like achievement finishing out a\nparticular round grinding towards a\nparticular goal that's why they have all\nthose things because the if you really\nthink about it like especially like MMOs\nright grinding is not fun it's never\nbeen fun but people will do it for hours\nand hours and hours and hours and hours\nto get the thing at the end yeah yeah so\nso so no that makes sense it kind of\nreminds me of kind of like Hunter gu\nsort of behavior so we so I'll give you\nan example I go mushroom hunting right I\ndo mology so we'll go and find um like\ndifferent mushrooms here in Washington\nstate yeah I do I love it it's super fun\nright I I raise uh oyster mushrooms and\nLion's man and shitake and RI mushrooms\nsuper fun for me to do I really enjoy it\nand um doing mushroom hunting here in\nWashington state we can actually go and\nget like um uh King bites King bites are\nawesome but you're walking around in a\nswamp and it's just gross everywhere and\nthen you see like a oh holy crap I got\nthe big King B they're like this big\nthey're huge man and like I've got a\nbunch of pictures of them they're quite\ncool I can send them over to you but uh\nthere's this moment where it's like\ngross gross gross gross gross and then\nyou find it and you're like wow I got\nthat and it makes me wonder like how far\nback does that kind of trait Behavior go\nfor humans because that's a survival\ntrait AB that's a we survived because of\nthis and now now it's being used to sell\nyou things on the internet but like yeah\nso Thor it's it it always amazes me how\nintuitive you are about understanding\nsome of these things so like um there's\nactually a lot of really interesting\nstudies that were done in the mid 2000s\nthe early studies on video game\naddiction really discovered that it is\nthe denial of the reward that correlates\nwith addiction right so so some people\nkind of think about this as like random\nreinforcement schedule where like you\ndon't always get but it's not just the\nrandomness there's another part to it\nwhich is if you look at like from\nsoftware games like why are they so\nsatisfying it's because it's hard to\nachieve right so like like you you wipe\non a boss you wipe on a boss you wipe on\na boss and then you get so the the rush\nof dopamine that you get correlates with\nthe amount of denial and difficulty yeah\nand everyone who beats that boss when\nanother person sees you do it they're\nlike I beat that boss and I understand\nhow difficult that was Absolut right\nbeing a cultural like kind of group\nthing abely so we we societally we value\nhuman beings based on the difficulty of\ntheir\naccomplishments yeah right so absolutely\nand so the the real challenge is that\nthis principle video games have figured\nout how to take advantage of but the\nreal challenge I'm just thinking about\nthis concept of failure and making\nfailure safe because like the whole\nthing that's that's really interesting\nis the more you fail in life and if you\nfeel like you're a\nloser in the same principle of video\ngames where the harder a boss is to beat\nwhen you beat the boss you feel really\ngood so the really interesting thing is\nthat the more you've failed in life the\nmore I will see like a rebound so when\npeople are super super behind and they\nget one break you will be amazed at how\nquickly they can catch up yeah that's me\nI got my ass kicked for a long time yeah\nand and that's that's the real tragedy\nis that people who think that they're\nlosers in life they think that there is\na linear like you know I the race is\nlinear right but it's not you can ab you\nabsolutely have this weird potential\nenergy which is like building up so I'm\nthinking about one particular patient of\nmine who was like 32 years old when I\nstarted working with them\nand they had struggled with addiction\ntheir whole life I think they finished\nundergrad and then in the span of like\ntwo or three so they were like basically\nnot quite homeless but they were\nfinancially dependent on on someone that\nthey were close to like didn't have a\ncareer like you know just really really\nbad uh worst possible scenario yeah yeah\nright and and then within two or three\nyears they wrote a novel they became a\ntherapist themselves and like got\nhealthy like got into a healthy\nrelationship and in like 3 years like\nthey went from like Zero to Hero you\nknow and like they've got a stable job\nthey do work that pays them well and\nlike they find like invigorating and and\ngratifying and in addition to working 32\nclinical hours a week they spend 30\nhours a week working on their like\nfiction novel and they like wrote a\nnovel and in the span of three years\nit's just amazing how much someone can\naccomplish and looking at what what they\nwere how they were at the age of 35 like\nyou would never know that this person\nwas behind yeah it's the same thing like\num I've got a buddy on here primagen\nhe's another streamer streams\nprogramming um he talks about it all the\ntime he used to be he was a meth addict\nright he was addicted to meth and he\nmanaged to dig himself out of that went\nto work at Netflix awesome programmer\nnow is quit Netflix and now does this\nstuff full time and is like kicking a\nhuge amount of ass dude is amazing yeah\nand it shows you and it's funny too\nbecause people contact me they're like I\nStr struggle with addiction and uh you\ncan't really fix that for them a lot of\ntimes you just say hey look over here\nyou can see that people can get out of\nthis and then you show them like it is\npossible and I think that that does a\nlot of good A lot of the times it's just\nshowing them it is possible to succeed\neven in that very rough scenario that\nyou're in you know yeah so that's\nusually what I do is I'm like look at\nPrime he did it you you can it is\npossible to do this but you'll have to\nfind your route you know yeah I think\nthat's the challenge right is that's\nwhere the ego comes that's where the ego\ncomes in and the ego says they did it\nbut I can't do it because I'm different\nyeah yeah that's the that's the biggest\nthing is it ends up being you you end up\nbeing Your Own Worst Enemy there that's\nthe the best advice that I have for that\none is then make a bet with yourself\ntell yourself okay I'll see if I can do\nit I'm GNA give myself three months I'm\nGNA see if I can I'm G to put that to\nthe side I'm put all the fears to the\nside I'm just going to do this we're\ngoing to make a bet if that is right if\nI can't do it then at the end of three\nmonths I'll have accomplished nothing\nbut if the end of three months I made\neven a step forward of progress then it\nmeans that I can do this and I can keep\ndoing this and it's just a short BET\nright and what do you got to lose\nnothing really you know so people try\nwhen they're given that kind of idea\nlike oh I can just make a bet on this I\ncould try it and they'll usually find\nthat in three months they've made some\nsort of progress and they can look back\nin they be like now I've documented\nevidence I'm kicking ass I can keep\nmoving forward and they just keep making\nthe beted and I found that works really\nreally well especially for people that\ndon't believe in themselves and it's\nusually because of like imposter\nsyndrome you have like an imposter\nsyndrome scenario where someone just has\nthat little voice in the back of their\nhead that's telling them you're not good\nenough you you're not going to be able\nto do this and I find that that is more\nof a defense mechanism than anything\nelse they're trying to protect\nthemselves from failure so if you make\nthat little bet and you say hey I don't\nbelieve you but we'll find out if you're\nright or not and it it works you know\nyeah so it's really interesting because\nI I think there's a lot of cool\nmechanisms that play there and I I I\nlove the the the strategy so a couple of\nthings that I'm kind of hearing the\nfirst is that there's a really\nfascinating study about feeling\noverwhelmed so a lot of times people\nthink that feeling overwhelmed is a\nconsequence of how many things you're\ndealing with right so if I'm dealing\nwith 10 things then I'm going to feel\noverwhelmed like this is objective so I\nthink it's very\nsubjective it's very different for every\nperson so so so it's it's really\ninteresting but what what there's a lot\nof research on anxiety which shows that\nthe degree of overwhelmed you feel does\nnot correlate with the number of things\nthat you have to deal with so you can\nyou can deal with one thing or things\nthat's not what that's the feeling of\noverwhelmed is what percentage of things\nthat you are dealing with did you choose\nto deal\nwith I agree with it so there's this\nthis concept called active challenges\nand passive challenges passive\nchallenges are like aggro like there are\nlike challenges in your life that\naggroed you when you were like walking\ndown the street so things like oh you\nknow my parents have cancer or something\nlike that like or some Agro Jesus yeah\nthat's bad aggro like you know some\nnegative downturn in the economy like\nthings that you can't control so the\nreally interesting thing is that there's\nyour your mind keeps a ratio like\nsubconsciously of stuff that I signed up\nfor stuff that I didn't sign up for and\nwhen the majority of my life is doing\nthings that I did not sign up for this\nis what leads to burnout so the really\ncrazy thing is and feeling overwhelmed\nand then like not actually being able to\ndeal with those things so the crazy\nthing is that if you're feeling\noverwhelmed in life the right move is\nnot to do less it's actually to take on\nmore that is intentional things that you\ncan control absolutely so there are like\nfive things that I'm dealing with that\nare outside of my control to to take on\ntwo things will actually improve my\nperformance over time I actually really\nlike that that's not something that I've\never thought about in that direction I\nthink that's that's really interesting\nbecause usually when it's when it's\nsomething like that I I had never drawn\nthe Cor between things that you did\ncontrol or did not control and it's true\nI've seen that for myself many times\nlike where where I'm dealing with a\nwhole bunch of things and I can handle a\nwhole bunch of projects spin a bunch of\nplats no problem and then you have\nsomething that's like throwing a wrench\ninto the machine and it's like oh you\nknow it's like now I gotta handle this\nthing you know it's so irritating yeah\nand I think it's get it I'm sorry go\nahead I was saying I get that that\nactually makes complete sense and it's\nnot something I ever thought about yeah\nyeah so I I think when we you know when\nI first heard what you've been up to it\nsounds like you had done this feret\nReserve this game Jam you're working on\ntheir Publishing House it also sounds\nlike you're streaming I don't know if\nyou have like a a job um this is the job\nokay yeah so so you're a full-time I I\ndon't know oh yeah um so you know it's\ninteresting because someone will look at\nthat and they'll they'll think like oh\nmy God like this person is doing so much\nhow is Thor super human well he is he\ndoes have that I sleep five hours a day\nthat's the Superhuman part it's the\nmutant um but but I I think that's what\nI tend to find is that when people take\non more they tend to do better and the\nother really interesting thing is that\nwhen you give someone this three-month\nchallenge it moves them out of the realm\nof cognition and into the realm of\naction and any shift from cognition to\naction is almost always a good\none and when people are just stuck in\ntheir own head like what's going to\nhappen is your mind will play through\nall these different scenarios that'll be\nhypothetical but you won't ever actually\nget additional data to count C your\nperceptions that's the biggest problem\nwith it is it's you you have to have you\nhave to have evidence otherwise the\nperceptions just going to take over like\nif if you're sitting there telling\nyourself you can't do it all day and you\ndon't have any evidence to the contrary\nyou're probably going to believe it you\nknow and if you give yourself even a\nmoment to have any type of evidence you\ncan defeat that immediately like well\nwhat about that and it just disappears\nyou know floats away so I I think it's\nchallenging because depending on your\nmind your mind will shape the evidence\nso so what happens for a lot of people\nis that you know they will try things\nand in their mind they acted but it's so\nchallenging because our mind can\nshape our experience yeah um and there\nthere ways to kind of get around that\nbut or there ways to clean out what our\nexperience is so that it's more\nobjective as opposed to not being shaped\nby the mind but that's a really tough\none to be honest with you changing it\nfrom like the subjective opinion to the\nobjective opinion of what's going on\nespecially when you're the actor\ninvolved in that right when you're the\none the action that's really difficult\nfor people yeah so it it turns out it\ncomes back to perception so if you look\nat like any action that you take there\nis the objective reality and then there\nis what your mind adds to the reality so\nwhat is the significance of someone not\ncalling you back today what is the\nsignificance of an email from a company\nthat says hey we really liked you but we\njust don't have a position that fits at\nthe moment yep and some people will\ninterpret that as oh they don't like me\nand some people will interpret that as\nis they do like me I have value but they\ndon't have a position that fits yeah so\nsome people it's that's why I like\nanalytics so much like that's something\nthat I I drive a lot of our businesses\nbased on analytics right and I do that\nspecifically because it's an immutable\nfact it's it's one of those ones where\nit's like you have this thing that is\nevidence of what's going on Beyond\nwhatever your perception could be you\ncould have perception that may back it\nup and move in different directions for\nideas you can try but you have solid\nevidence of what is going on how do you\nuse Analytics\nI use analytics for anything that we\nwant to do in terms of business\nDirection so anytime I'm doing anything\nI find out if people like that thing we\nkind of do tests on it and be like hey I\ntalk about this thing or we look at some\ngame or anything like that if I'm\ngetting a sponsor in right and we play a\nsponsored game I go and show them\nanalytics be like this is how many\npeople wanted to engage with this people\nmay find that the game is really fun to\nwatch they just don't want to play it or\npeople may find that they want to stop\nwatching me to go play the game so like\nif you're streaming a video game that\nyou've been sponsored for and suddenly\nhalf of your audience disappears a lot\nof streamer would would probably freak\nout they'd be like oh no may people hate\nthis but if you go and look at the\nanalytics on steamdb for the game you\nmay find that the amount of players in\nthe game have skyrocketed it as a result\nof this they just stopped watching you\nto go play it because they thought it\nwas compelling enough so you have to use\nanalytics to kind of get rid of whatever\nworried perception you can have because\nit's it ends up being a fact right and\nyou can you can find that out as an\nexample of this is quite funny one of\nthe best watched videos that I have on\nmy YouTube is me playing through outer\nWilds but one of my worst stream days\nwas outer Wilds because of the beginning\nof that stream I told people don't watch\nme play this if you haven't played it\nbefore because it'll ruin the game for\nyou and they left it was like two-thirds\nof the audience just left so it's like\nthe worst viewership I've ever had for\nthat kind of a stream but the best\nYouTube video because they after they\nplayed the game they wanted to go see\nhow I experienced it after they could no\nlonger be spoiled yeah so you have to\nuse analytics you have to otherwise you\njust you run into these weird walls\nwhere I would have a negative perception\nI'd be like oh well I should never touch\nthat game again you know but like no you\nshould you should learn about that you\nknow yeah so it was interesting I I gave\na a talk at I think GDC about 2 or 3\nyears ago I forget yeah um but I was I I\nwas talking to some advertisers\nabout uh\nsponsorships and and one of my beliefs\nis that I know a lot of sponsors want a\n60-second thing within the first like\ntwo minutes of the video yeah but I I\nwas explaining to them that I think that\nif you really look at like user Behavior\na sponsorship at the end of a video that\nis tightly tied to the content of the\nvideo will do way better than something\nat the beginning because everyone's like\nwe want more eyes but those eyes are not\nengaged right so so people are like oh\nthis is like they'll just skip past it\nwhereas if you have a sponsorship that\nis at the end of the video related to\nthe topic of the video I suspect that\nthe user Behavior will be a lot better\nlike in terms of what people like even\nthe fewer people will watch the the ad\num their ability to engage with what\nwhatever the advertiser or the sponsor\nultimately wants may actually be way\nhigher so I think there's a lot of\nchallenges with the way that we get data\nand we see this a lot like in in the\ncontent creator like burnout management\nstuff that we do where like the the\ninternet gives us in platforms give us a\nlot of data that I don't think is\nactually helpful they just give it\nbecause that's what they can measure\nthis is the big problem with dating apps\nis that they can't measure the things\nthat actually correlate with like\nsuccess in a relationship they can just\nupload pictures and you can write things\nabout yourself but there are no studies\nthat show that making a good bio like\ncorrelates with relationship I mean I'm\nsure that that would be true in a sense\nthat because it's got to get you more\ndates but if you look at the things that\ncorrelate with success in relationships\nthey're not things that dating apps can\ndetect or select for you also get a lot\nof really weird gotcha images and things\nonline that I find where people will be\nlike look at how many times I had to\nsend out a thing before I got one reply\nand it would be like look 5,000 you know\ndates and like it's one relationship and\nI think those are pretty misleading as\nwell because it doesn't show you the\nfull story there of each of those\ninteractions like how many swipes you\ndid or anything none of that matters\nfrankly well I find that to be very I\nthink it's incredibly misleading for a\nwhole host of other reasons oh yeah\nthere's a lot of reasons say it's\nmisleading but I think that one is that\none is demoralizing to people in a way\nthat's weird like really bad you know\nit's not it's not benefiting anyone put\nthat out have you heard of this concept\nof the missing missing\nreasons no so this is so fascinating I I\ngot to send y all this link this is one\nof the most brilliant psychological\nExplorations that I've seen sent you the\nmushrooms by the way okay cool thank\nyou so the there's like if you look at\nposts online especially about\nrelationships there's this great\npsychologist I think or maybe it's not\neven a psychologist who wrote this this\nbook about the missing missing reasons\nso it is um so basically like when\nsomeone shares a story\nonline they there will be things missing\nfrom the story and the things that are\nmissing from the story are really where\nthe money\nis right so someone will say oh like\nI've been married for 30 years and then\nmy partner just woke up and just walked\nout of the house and took my kids they\nrefused to talk to me they they they\nblocked me on all my numbers you know\nlike and then they'll they'll like frame\nthings in some kind of like victim\nmentality but there's like stuff missing\nfrom the story yeah and and so I think\nis so common yeah so common yeah and and\neven in our own lives if you really pay\nattention to the ego the cool thing\nabout the ego is that the ego believes\nit's logical but it's very selective so\nthe nature of the ego is to ignore\ninformation that does not align with\nwhat you your ego wants in that moment\nand so one of the and even Carl Yung I\nknow I'm kind of bouncing all over the\nplace but Carl Yung I think discovered\nthis when he was talking about this\nconcept of the Shadow which is even\nwithin our own Psych ology in our own\npsyche there are parts of our psyche\nthat we actively suppress or ignore and\nif you want to grow those are the things\nthat you need to confront because that's\nreally where the problem is and if you\nkind of think about if there's a part of\nlife that you're not looking at if that\npart of life is not fixed you will never\nbe able to fix\nit and so a lot of times people don't\nrealize that you know they're living\nthis life that things are going bad\nthings are going bad things are going\nbad and they feel like they're a victim\nbecause\nthis person screwed me over this person\nscrewed me over this person screwed me\nover you know's the funniest thing about\nthat yeah oh sorry go for it I think the\nfunniest thing about that is you can\nquit it to League of Legends or any\ncompetitive game oh if you're in bronze\nit is more likely that you're going to\nblame the rest of your entire team for\nyour team failing when you're not\nfocusing on you doing better at the\nvideo game which is going to increase\nyouro so this happens all the time in\ncompetitive games like if you're in\nbronze you deserve to be in bronze I've\ngot a\nI've got a cool paper to show you hell\nyeah give me a\nsecond but that's really what that is is\nlike you you need to focus on improving\nyourself and improving your own\nperformance there not tearing down your\nteammates so it's not gonna help you\nthis is I gotta find it but what do you\nmean it's always my team no it\nain't\nit's\nuh come on where's this\npaper I know I've got it come on you\nstill can't carry four people no that's\ntrue you can't carry all of your team\nall of the time but in times where you\ncould make a difference your performance\nis what matters and you'll win more than\nmore often that way and then you'll\nclimb so I gotta I gotta do some\nshenanigans on on my stream setup\nbecause I I gotta screen share with\nyou on Discord Shenanigans I can watch\nthe stream I can do that if that's\neasier um well I want to show people too\nso let me see if I can do this browser\nplus 2 does this work oh sweet oh my God\ndude mods for the win this is\ngreat so now I can still see you and\nshow this so this is great oh yeah so\ncognitive flexibility in decision making\npredicts expertise in the MOBA esport\nLeague of Legends so look at this so\nyou're saying that like you know when\nyou blame your teammates all the time so\nthere's there's one thing that\ncorrelates with rank okay so data was\nanalyzed by a means of correlation and\nmultiple regression analysis results\nshowed that cognitive flexibility was\npositively related to rank percentage P\nless than\n011 um so this is a pretty big\nconfidence interval so I don't know\nexactly how they measure this but it\nseems like it correlates a lot with rank\nbecause this number is big but it's very\nwide right so and what we're talking\nabout is like the ability\n[Music]\nto pay attent like the ability to not\nthink the way that you're thinking\nthat's what cognitive flexibility is so\nwhen people constantly blame their\nteammates there's no cognitive\nflexibility right my team sucks my team\nsucks my team sucks they're not\nflexible um let me just make sure yeah\nwe don't need this one if you turn\naround you go but maybe I suck and then\nyou work on it you go and look at the\nanalytics and you find out where were\nyou sucking you you find out like if\nyour build is even making sense were you\nbuilding you know magic into Mr Right\nyou know basic stuff like that like you\nhave to you have to think about your own\nperformance because you can't control\nyour teammate's performance but you\ndefinitely can control yours and that's\nthe best thing you can start at and then\nif you're doing that you can set an\nexample for your teammates and maybe\nthey modify their behavior well and then\nyou win yeah so I I want to make this\nvideo one day I've been recording myself\nplaying DOTA and recalibrating on rank I\nmentioned this on stream a couple times\nbut I basically had an experiment so a\nlot of people will say like if you want\nto climb in video games like don't like\nmute everybody because you'll tell\ndoesn't work it doesn't work it's so I I\ndid this cool experiment I had two\naccounts one that I use for streaming so\nthat it doesn't leak my steam\ninformation and then I have a second\naccount but DOTA recently cracked down\nso I stopped doing this but um so I\nbasically calibrated to both at the same\ntime but in one be the most toxic\nteammate is that what you're saying and\nthen are you are you saying that you\nplayed both both sides or you like no no\nso so I I played I I did my calibration\nmatches cuz you can recalibrate like\nevery year so I did my calibration\nmatches on both accounts but in one I\nwas muted and in one I was talking I\nthought you were trying to say you were\ntoxic in one and not toxic in the other\nI was like no I mean I I could be toxic\nI'm sure that that would be a greater\nMMR variation but like it it's amazing I\nmean I I think it was it was like an 800\nmm difference which is you know like a\ncouple of ranks I want to say it's like\n20 percentile points unhealthy gamer BG\nit's finally happening and when you\nlearn how to communicate in games like\nit's amazing you can I mean you will\ngain like a thousand MMR and there are\nall kinds of things you know speaking of\nrelationships it's like the same stuff\nlike you got to learn you know like one\nthing that I found is uh instead of\ntelling like uh my carry player to like\nstop going to some part of the map after\nthey die three times in that part of the\nmap I will ask them hey do you want me\nto place Wards so you don't die there\nagain or do you want to play around\nwhere I have Wards like tell me what you\nwant me to do and like 90% of the time\nwhen I ask them what do you want me to\ndo and I point out like hey I can play\naround this and place Awards where you\nkeep dying do you want me to do\nthat what they'll actually do is just\nswitch to the right part of the map yep\nbut if you tell them questioned to them\nyeah dumbass stop going there you keep\ndying they'll like I'm going to do it\ntwice as much now and that's what they\ndo yeah and that makes sense because\nlike if if you if you had somebody come\nand attack you for playing the way that\nyou are when you were failing especially\nin the in the most vulnerable moment\nwhere deep inside you know that you're\nscrewing up and you want to lash out at\neveryone around you and then you give\nthem a Target to lash out of course\nthey're going to lash out at you it's\njust going to spiral the whole team it's\nso bad you can't do that yeah it's it's\namazing sometimes I'll you know I'll\nhave teammates who are so good and I\nwonder how are they at the same rank as\nme and it's because they're just so\ntoxic yeah and they don't they can't\nprevent tilt and you know yeah tilting\nis is probably the worst it it it's\nfunny because there's a meme inside of\nleague for a long time which is like oh\nit's 4 V6 right now you know that kind\nof things like there's one of your oppon\none of your players has moved to the\nenemy team when you're saying that\nyou're the one on the enemy team\nabsolutely the the the really crazy\nthing that that I've started to realize\nis I really do think we can learn just\nabout everything that we need in real\nlife from video games like I think all\nthe microcosm of gaming I think is\nsufficient like the stuff around\ncognitive flexibility how to not tilt I\nmean here we are talking about making it\nsafe to fail right and what's the\npurpose of that it's because we don't\nrealize that we're like tilted IRL like\nfeeling overwhelmed you're tilted IRL\nyou know like we blame our teammates\nright so my situation in my life is not\nmy own making it's a bad upbringing it's\nbad friends it's bad spouses and there's\nno I mean there's a ton of data that\nshows that adverse childhood experiences\ncorrelate with trauma and depr and\nthings like that so people do have\nsometimes bad bad\nsituations um but even the ability to\nrise above those situations depends a\nlot on these like core video game skills\nyeah I think that's actually true I I I\nthink it's funny because video games\ntaught me a lot growing up you know what\nthey you all kinds of things like to to\nbe real with you being able to solve\nthrough problems being able to analyze\nproblems and find different ways to do\nit because the game doesn't care what\nyour emotional state is the game is\nalways the same so if you're going to\napproach a problem emotionally largely\nthe game doesn't care about that you're\ngoing to lose you're not going to solve\nthe puzzle so it taught me to take the\nemotional feeling that I had put it on\nthe side for a moment take a logical\napproach to it and then kind of work my\nway through that that's where I learned\nthat from games that's why I do that\ntoday and I do that for everything now\nand I do it because I learned it from\ngames when I was younger and that allows\nme to go like all right I'm getting\npissed off I'm going to take a minute\nand we're going to look through this\nlogically and I'm is going to take that\nemotion put it off inside and when you\ngo through it logically like logically\nprocess that you largely aren't going to\nbe angry at the end of that conversation\nit just kind of goes away you know we I\nthink we talked about that last time we\nhad a talk too was was the ability to\njust kind of take a step back and wait\nand it's it's what I learned from games\nearly on very early so I I'm kind of\ncurious Thor do you have any thoughts\nabout so some people are able to like\ngrind a game for hours and hours and\nhours I can do that and then they have\ndifficulty grinding IRL for hours and\nhours and hours do you have any sense\nhow to translate being able to grind in\na game into grinding in real life\nimmediate emotional feedback or\nimmediate feedback from the game the\ngame tells you instantly when you get\nrewarding or when you accomplish a goal\nor don't accomplish a goal that the best\nway they can look at this is homework if\nyou give a student a online test or an\ninteractive test where they are\nimmediately getting feedback from the\nanswers\nI find that to be much more compelling a\nlot of the times for many people than\ngiving them homework where they have to\nwrite it all down and they find out the\nanswers the next day they're less\nengaged with that because it doesn't\ngive them immediate interactive feedback\nand it's funny because I I see that more\noften with people that have ADHD I don't\nknow if there's a correlation there but\nthat seems Seems correct to me see see\nwhat more often uh that people are less\nengaged if they have ADHD I find them to\nbe less engaged if they're not getting\nimmediate feedback on the things that\nare going on that the actions they're\nperforming absolutely a correlation so\nwe know that the the dopamine reward\ncircuitry in\nADHD uh so their ability to delay\ngratification is impaired because the\nthe time window between action and\nreward is very very tight so I think\nthat's what games give you frankly yeah\nso that's really interesting because you\nknow there's uh let me see if I can pull\nup some more research sure I want to\nshow you something it's more than just\nopen it's just all all feedback whether\nit's good or bad it's all feedback\nwhere's that Haggard paper\noh that's why it always made me laugh is\none of one of the memorable things that\nI remember from Earthbound MH was\nEarthbound had a section of the game\nwhere to progress the story you had to\nsit behind the waterfall for like three\nminutes okay and do nothing okay that's\ntough and it was so in today's world I\nfeel that many gamers can't do it that's\na difficult one like I I really feel\nit's not a thing that's like super\ncommon where waiting is the solution\nwhich is quite yeah so like I always\nwondered like in games like Earthbound\nhow did they ever figure that out\nso you know so like I I I played did you\nplay the old castlevanias oh yeah so\nlike you played Simon's Quest I don't\nknow specifically which ones I played\nbut I pa I played Castlevania when\nCastlevania 2 is just an amazing game so\nit was like want to go back and play\nthese it was it was I think the first\ngame where I don't know if you played\nlike Symphony of the Night um I did syph\nSimon's Quest I think was like the first\ngame I guess they had metroids so they\nsort of like turned the level-based\nCastlevania into like a more Metroid\nVania kind of game I don't know if I\nplayed Simon's Quest it's so good dude\nand there was this one part of the the\ngame where you have to find some item\nand then you have to walk up to a wall\nand you have to duck in front of the\nwall and you just have to duck and hold\nit there and if you hold it for like 30\nseconds or 60 seconds a whirlwind shows\nup out of nowhere picks you up and\nCarries you through the wall and like I\nremember we we saw that cuz we had a\nsubscription to Nintendo Power where\nthey like explained this because that's\nwhere there was no internet so you\ncouldn't like Google things but I always\nwondered like how on Earth are people\nsupposed to and there was someone who\nlike gave you a clue in town but this\nwas like poorly translated from Japanese\nso like the english- speaking there's\nlike no way like it doesn't make any\nsense you gave yourself the answer there\nthough we had to use Nintendo power but\nbeond that you get Nintendo Power you\nhave the solution you go to school and\nnow you got the solution you tell all\nyour friends about it you're the cool\nkid yeah that that was there was a lot\nof like discuss so I I wonder how did\nthey figure these things out probably\nthat way um the the interesting thing\nthat I wanted to mention is there's a\nreally cool you mentioned this immediate\nfeedback so there's a really cool\nprinciple uh or like scientific thing\ncalled intentional binding which is what\nare the what are the things that you can\ndo to increase the repetition of a\nbehavior okay so like if I work out\ntoday\nwhat what increases the chance that I\nwill work out tomorrow now a lot of\npeople think that the reward that you\nget from working out correlates with a\nrepetition of the action right so if I\nget rewarded I will do it again and\nthere's absolutely a component of that\nreally fascinating thing is that there's\na there's a particular researcher named\nHaggard who does a lot of research on\nintentional binding and what he\ndiscovered was super cool like there are\na bunch of studies that show that there\nare three things that you can do to\nincrease I want to just find the\npaper that increase the likelihood that\nyou will\num damn it okay that will increase the\nlikelihood of repeating the behavior and\nthe interesting thing is that this\neffect is independent of the outcome of\nthe behavior so people have done\nscientific studies\nwhere no matter what you choose the\noutcome is the same and yet there are\ncertain things that you can do that will\nincrease your likelihood of repetition\nand this this feel felt to me like\nreally pretty revolutionary so the first\nis to think through your options ahead\nof time so just think consider all the\nchoices so people who intentionally\nconsider choices are more likely to\nengage in the behavior so if I'm like\nbecause you're intentionally choosing it\nand then it's yeah it's not just a thing\nyou do it's a thing you chose to do yeah\nso instead of like need to go to the gym\ntoday oh my God you get into this\nconflict of I need to go to the gym I\nneed to go to the gym I don't want to go\nto the gym I get to go to the gym not\njust I get what do I want to how do I\nwant to exercise I want I want to do it\nnot even I want to do it just just\nconsidering your options this this is\nhow crazy it is so not even selecting\njust having the selection available yeah\nwell I think at some point you make a\nselection but having multiple options\nincreases the likelihood of any Behavior\nso thinking through do I go to the gym\ndo I exercise at home even going through\nthat cognitive\nprocess second thing is to predict the\nconsequences of your actions so spend\nsome time thinking through what you\nexpect to happen even just spending some\ntime thinking about it increases the\nlikelihood that you'll do it\nirrespective of what\nhappens process you're talking about I\ndo this yeah so the third thing so this\nis what I'm sure we'll Discover right\nbecause you're quite productive and\nwe'll find that and anyway the third\nthing is some amount of reflection\nafterward\nso spending some time processing and you\ndon't even have to think a par you don't\nhave to think in a particular way you\ndon't have to do something specific you\nliterally like after a task is complete\nyou spend 5 to 10 minutes just doing\nnothing and reflecting you don't have to\nreflect in a particular direction you\ndon't have to discover anything you\ndon't have to learn anything and if you\nkind of think about it what I've noticed\nin people I work with is that some\npeople do this automatically they do all\nthree of these things and they tend to\nbe super productive and there a lot of\npeople like me who don't do these things\nso you don't I used to not so so so you\nyou trained into it sort of yeah so I I\ntrained it into it in a kind of\nroundabout way but like basically what I\nused to do is like it wasn't like do I\nwant to study at the gym do I want to\nstudy with my friends it was like oh my\nGod I need to study I don't want to\nstudy so I was always stuck when I take\nan action not thinking through the\nconsequences I was always stuck trying\nto work with willpower like overcome\nmyself\ninstead of consider my options predict\nthe consequences and then the other\nthing that I would always do this is so\ndevastating probably one thing that's\nhuge is as soon as something finished\nwhether it was good or bad I would move\non to the next thing so if I studied for\na test and I take the test and the test\nis like oh man like I didn't I didn't\nget to that chapter I didn't get to that\nchapter I would immediately try to leave\nthe test behind Okay the test is over\nI'm done time to celebrate never spent\nany time reflecting even if my test went\nwell it's like wow I like really studied\nwell for that test time to celebrate and\nyou didn't you don't take into account\nany of the things that worked or didn't\nwork absolutely right you carry nothing\ninto the next you just you just yeah\nempty-headed you just jump to the next\nthing so literally like predicting your\nuh considering your options making a\nprediction doesn't matter if the\nprediction is correct or not yep and um\ntesting the Assumption yeah and then\njust reflecting yep and it's it's it's\nfunny because I didn't us to do that\neither and then I went homeless and I\nhave done that ever since that exact\nprocess you're talking about the whole\nthing happened after I was homeless\nbecause I lived in my car for a year and\nafter that point it was like I never\nwant that to happen again let's slow\nthis down a little bit let's be more\nintentional about the actions that I\ntake right all the actions that I'm\ngoing to take I'm going to be more\nintentional about this and I started\ndoing that process I didn't know that\nthat was like a standardized thing but\nyeah that's how I approach anything\nthat's the thing is it's not a\nstandardized thing so it's it's it's\nlike biologically accurate but we don't\nteach people these kinds of skills we\ndon't teach people if you want to do\nsomething what are the actions that you\ncan take that will increase the\nlikelihood of you doing that thing yeah\nwe don't know what our brain actually\nresponds to right so everyone focuses on\nbuilding habits everyone focuses on\nbuilding willpower um everyone focuses\non finding the right thing for them so\nthey're like oh the gym doesn't work for\nme whereas like what we're seeing and\nand this is something I I literally just\nmade lecture about this about how like\nwe as a society are becoming less\nadaptable so if you look at like\nadaptability as a trait of human\nperformance as\nSociety Society is like engendering in\nUS less adaptability because Society\nwill meet you where you are you don't\nhave to learn how to like this game\nbecause there are 20,000 games you can\nfind the perfect game for you oh sign up\nfor Tinder we have 20,000 we have a\nmillion people on the platform you can\npick the perfect person for you you can\nfind the perfect food for you you can\nfind the perfect job for you now with\nlike\nglobalization and so what we're we're\nreally starting to see I'm I'm noticing\nthis like even in the 10 years that I've\nbeen practicing\nclinically people are less adaptable and\nas you become less adaptable you succeed\nless because then also more extreme in\ntheir requirement too what do you mean\nlike so the one of the things that I\nnoticed quite a lot about is if if you\nhave a video game and that video game\nhas all the that you like except for\nthis one little thing the game is trash\ndown vote bad awful developer and that's\nthe thing that I think is really\ninteresting is because that sort of\ninfinite choice where you can select the\nperfect game means that when you have\none thing that's missing well then it's\nawful doesn't matter anymore right\nbecause I could find something else and\nI I think that that kind of goes hand\ninand with what you're talking about\nyou're you're right it is dramatically\nless adaptable it's dramatically less\ninterested in finding any type of\nsituation that almost fits and making\nthat work for you it's more what doesn't\nfit even a little bit 1% is wrong so\nscrew that thing oh whoops sorry um I'd\nlove to hear more about your homeless\ntime but can I show you something real\nquick yeah sure do do you like it when I\nshow papers or yay n yeah yeah I love\nthat so this is a fantastic paper um\ncalled the neurocognitive basis of human\nvolition so this is this dude's absolute\nChad um but there's uh let me look at\nthis um\nso mechanisms of human vition in the\nbrain\nuh there's some there's some really cool\nstuff independent\noh I think it's\nhere um reading chat yeah wild Chad it's\nsuch a good this paper is just so long\nand\ndense yeah um I read here's uh okay a\nlot so crucially this binding effect is\nfound only for outcomes that follow\none's volitional actions and is absent\nwhen the voluntary keepad blah blah okay\nI think this is is the section\num uh give me a second it's worth the\nwait I promise\nyall okay so first several studies\nconfirm that the ability to choose among\nseveral possible actions increases\nintentional binding so just if you have\nlots of options it increases the\nlikelihood that you will do the thing um\nso uh so here okay so this is what's\ncrazy\ninterestingly this effect of free choice\nwas found both when all possible actions\nled to the same outcome and when they\nled to different outcomes so this is\nwhat's crazy the outcome this is\nindependent of the actual outcome of\nYour\nAction so simply thinking through things\nlike literally like different routes for\nthe same place yeah yeah and and and so\nI I think that's what's so interesting\nwhen I kind of hear you like you know in\nsome of the stuff you've like really\nstumbled into like this idea of like\nlet's make\nless fearful and the cool thing is like\nit doesn't matter whether they actually\nbuild something or they don't build\nsomething because everyone is thinking\nlike oh I have to build something to get\npositively reinforced where that's not\nit right and you're talking about that\nthere's an emotional component to it\nabsolutely it's not just but it's not\njust about failure it's like literally\nlike the parts of your brain\nthat urge you to act will get boosted if\nyou think through options if you engage\nin some kind of behavior it doesn't\nmatter like it it doesn't matter if it\ngoes well doesn't go well whatever like\nit it's kind of funny cuz people come to\nme all the time and they're like I don't\nI don't feel like I want to do anything\ntoday but I have all these things to do\nand I was like have you tried writing\nthem down put them on a list and then\none of the things I always tell them is\nlike a list can be kind of overwhelming\nfor someone at first right so you got\nlike five items in a list make the first\nitem in the list you creating that list\nso then you have at the end of you\ncreating the list you mark that one off\nyou're like I already accomplished one\nand now I have all these other options\nof what I could do so I think that fits\nin exactly with what you're talking\nabout because that's the piece of advice\nI'm always giving people and it it works\nit works really well for a lot of people\nnot everybody nothing works for\neverybody but the grand majority of\npeople are like hey that helped me a lot\nI got a ton of done today it's like\nyeah so what one thing that I realized\nthat liberated my list making and helped\nme so much with lists is that lists\ndon't have to be complete they also\ndon't have to be completed in order yeah\nso like I started doing this thing a\ncouple years ago where I would make\nthese lists because I was so overwhelmed\nand I would have like 15 things on there\nand then I would do a couple and I would\ncheck a couple things and I'd look at my\nlist and I'd be like oh my God there's\nso much left to do I have literally a\npile of incomplete lists or like lists\nthat I've not finished off and I don't\neven need need to finish I realized\nrecently it doesn't matter because at\nthe end of it like just getting all the\nstuff on paper and then like doing a\ncouple things and losing the list\ntomorrow it doesn't matter I'll just\nmake a new list the process of making a\nlist helps me so much so I have like\nthis whole stack of just incompletely\nI'm never going to finish it that's okay\nit's right I I I feel the same way too\nis like I'll I'll create my task list\ntoday whatever I need to do right\nwhether it's a mental checklist or just\nthings that I write down or or calendar\nstuff sometimes one of those things is\njust like there's not enough time to day\nyou know the my body doesn't want to\nkeep going I'm going to go to bed right\nthis is kind of how it is and we move it\nto tomorrow it's it's fine to do that as\nlong as you are spinning the plates in a\nway where things are effectively getting\ncompleted over time you're fine you know\nsome things have are critical and they\nhave to be handled right now but not\neverything is you know yeah so Thor I\nknow we've been kind of Meandering all\nover the place I love this but is there\nsomething particular that we should be\ntalking about that you think we should\nspend more time on anything that\nyou're I don't know I mean you wanted to\ntalk about the time that I was homeless\nyou asked about that we could talk about\nthat yeah so what what changed for you a\nlot pretty much everything so I I went\nhomeless God I don't even know how long\nago it's a long while ago I lived out of\nmy car for a year is and I was in\nColorado the time and that happened\nbecause I didn't have proper constraints\non our business right so like I had a\nbusiness at the time I was working\nfreelance I was working on things with\nanother person um the way it worked is I\nwas creating programming they were\ncreating 3D models and we were building\nthese things together and then selling\nthem online right and they wanted to\nrenegotiate after about probably about a\nyear of us doing this together and at\nthat point we're making a lot of money I\nwas making like 10 grand a month I was\nmaking a ton of money and for a young\nperson that's a that's a ton even now\nthat's a ton of money right so I was\nmaking a bunch of money for this and I\nwas not careful with my finances and I\nwas not properly constraining the\nbusiness and what this meant is I was\nspending everything I was just like\nwhatever there's a ton of money I just\ndo whatever I want right I was just\nbeing a dumbass and spending I was\nbuying you know ordering out getting all\nthe food that I wanted doing anything I\nwanted to do going to any party that I\nwant to do anything I want to do and it\nwas what felt right at the time but I\ndidn't know how dangerous of a position\nthat put me into eventually that person\ncame by and they're like hey I want to\nre renegotiate I want 80% and I give you\n20% cuz I do the the art and uh you do\nyou just do the programming they didn't\nrespect that the programming was half of\nthe half the job right and I said no\nlike we have a deal for\n50/50 like no we're not doing that and\nthey said okay and they took all of our\nwork and they open sourced it against my\nwishes our income went gone so they cut\noff their nose to spite their face they\nlost everything as well but I was in a\nmuch more financially precarious\nposition because I was an idiot and\nspent all of my money that was on me\nright their action awful but also I\ndidn't plan for anything like that so I\nwent homeless I lived out of my car\nalmost immediately too I didn't have\nmoney for next month's rent like it was\njust like Boop gone that's a problem\nright and uh I was on a month-to-month\nsituation like that which is already\nhighly expensive so I was out and I\nlearned throughout that process it's\nlike I could blame them but where's that\ngoing to get me I'm going to get back in\nthis exact same scenario and I had a lot\nof time sitting in my car being on a\nlaptop you know taking internet from\ncoffee shops as I was sitting in the\nparking lot to think about those types\nof scenarios and be like what can I do\nbetter so that even if another person\nacts improperly and tries to abuse that\nsort of connection or the what they have\nover me that I will not be back here and\nthat's where I formed all of these ways\nthat I kind of handle problems and\nlogically walk through problems and\nhandle everything the way that I do is\nto prevent that from happening to me\nagain so Thor let me ask you a question\nwhat was your emotional state at the\ntime oh at first I was devastated I was\nso pissed I I was absolutely enraged and\nI was I was just like I was just super\nmad right I was like you've stolen\neverything from me and then after a time\nit was like okay that doesn't get me\nanywhere you could be as mad as you want\nthe rest of the world doesn't give a\n not even a little bit that other\nperson doesn't matter right you're not\nfixing the scenario that way so it came\nto this point where it's like I could be\nmad but what does that get me wasted\ntime not getting that back that's not\ngoing to give me anything at all so I\nstarted to change that sort of idea of\nlike what the victory condition here the\nvictory condition is to make sure that\nthis doesn't happen to me again let's\nchange the way that I feel and interact\nthrough these types of scenarios so that\nit can't happen and it for me that\nworked out really well was just changing\nkind of the objective because I think a\nlot of the times people want to\nimmediately get back everything that was\nstolen from them right everything that\nthey lost you got to get back to where\nyou were and I realized in the very\nbeginning I was like I'm not getting\nthat that's not possible that's\nunrealistic right I can get something\nnew something different but I can't go\nback to the way that it was that's\nalready out of the bag right so Thor\nwhat I'm kind of curious about is how\nare you able\nto\nlogically disarm your emotions like this\nis very\nrare I think it's effective anyone can\ndo it but I I I mean most people you\nknow when they get enraged they can't\njust like I I love your framing of like\nwhat's my victory condition I think\nthat's such a powerful way to deal with\nemotions like I think you really\nstumbled onto something there I think\nyou stumbled onto a lot of things but\nwhat I'm curious about is you know I\nwork with a lot of people who they\nrequire help to decompress their\nemotions so I'm curious like what your\ninternal experience of like this emotion\nis not useful let me discard\nit I honestly feel because it doesn't\nlead to anything anything attained that\nis beneficial I could sit there and be\nenraged I could I could when I'm mad at\nsomeone on the phone I could throw my\nphone right I could an emotional\nreaction I could throw my phone it'\nbreak my phone does that solve my\nproblems or does it make more every time\nyou have the the violent emotional\nreaction in the beginning I don't think\nthat solves anything I think it always\njust creates more problems and at that\npoint I didn't want more problems I\nstill don't want more problems so the\nway that I felt about it and the way I\nstill feel about it is take the\nemotional thing and and kind of put it\ninto a box off on the side and then look\nat it and be like does that make\nsense like is that going to create more\nproblems let's look at all the routes\nthat could come out of that emotional\nresponse are those routes beneficial\ndoes this matter right now does this\nhave meaning does this actually get me\nanywhere that makes sense is it okay to\nfeel that because if I do feel it in the\nin the way that it is in the exact way\nthat it is where does it lead and that's\nkind of what I got out of that is being\nable to dissect that sort of response\nbefore letting it go fully forward and\nbefore that I was just like whatever do\nanything who cares right so were did\nthat change for you when you had this\nexperience of homelessness or have you\nalways been like that I think it got\nmore defined that way I was always kind\nof like that when I was younger like I\nwas more like you know more logically\nthinking more more sighting with the\nlogic but I still have you know\nemotional outbursts as a human being\nright and I had that for a long time\nuntil I became homeless and then after\nthat it was like never again not\nallowing that to be a thing that was a\nbig defining moment for me was realizing\nthat I'm an adult now and there are real\nconsequences to not planning there are\nreal consequences to not thinking about\nmy actions and thinking about what can\ncome out of that and thinking about\nyou know routes and where things lead\nand that was a that was like a no one's\ngoing to catch me now so I have to be my\nown safety and I need to take this\nseriously and think about this you\nknow that I mean so so that sounds like\nyou know like traumatic but like in a\ngood way oh yeah yes no most definitely\nit was for me it was terrifying I was\nlike what if the car breaks down what am\nI going to do right you know like\neverything was terrifying everything I'm\ncurious what is your kind of emotional\nveilance now like do\nyou like do I feel emotions or yeah like\nlike what's your relationship with your\nemotions now oh yeah no absolutely the\nonly time that that kind of like kicks\nin for like hey wait a minute is when\nI'm having an extreme emotion when it's\nlike normal like oh I'm happy about this\nI'm sad about this like it's normal to\nfeel sad I think that's fine there's\nnothing wrong with that there's never an\narms length for every emotion but it's\nlike a I am very angry right now wait a\nminute I am very sad right now wait a\nminute is this does this make sense\nbecause I find that when I have a very\nextreme emotion if I just kind of let\nthat go and don't think about what could\nhappen in that moment like what if I'm\nreally really sad like in anguish or\nsomething and I want to break something\njust break something off the wall right\nyou have one of those types of violent\noutbursts because of a strong emotion is\nthat g to help you no probably going to\nhurt your hand it's going to break the\nthing on the wall everything's going to\nsuck you have more problems so when I\nhave a very extreme emotion and I can\nfeel that it's an extreme emotion for\nsomething then I then I hold back and I\ngoit wait a minute this is this is too\nmuch right and we got to wait now and\nfigure out what that is but for normal\naverage emotion stuff I I guess there's\nlike a filter in place if that Mak sense\nlike there's a filter that says that's a\nbit much hold up you know too far I\nguess is the best way to put\nit and how do you see what you're doing\nin the\nworld like how do you see like your like\ntell me about what what you think about\nyour\nlife I think that's an external\nperspective a lot of the times of like\nthe effect that I'm having on those\naround me or any of that type of stuff I\ndo a lot of that through I try to do\nthat through objective means like I said\nanalytics before things that people are\nsaying things that people are feeling\nthings that are you know interactions\nthat people are making because it is\nhard to form a subjective opinion\nespecially in social media especially\nonline right it is difficult to form an\nopinion of how I am doing when there are\nas an example the stream has 3.5 million\naverage viewers per month right 3.5\nmillion unique viewers Grand majority of\nthose people don't say anything I have\nno idea how they feel about it right but\nthey show up they watch the stream they\nengage with some of the content and we\nget a bunch of people into the stream\ninto the Discord and I can get at least\na gauge on how effective I am being with\nthe types of things that I'm trying to\ndo how much that resonates with other\npeople that gives me a kind of basis of\nunderstanding for that even though I\ndon't have the full complete picture and\nI don't think there's any way to get the\nfull complete picture if that makes\nsense yeah so what I'm kind of curious\nabout is like so you know when we were\ntalking about being homeless you said I\nI did those three things I thought about\nmy choices I predicted my actions and I\nkind of reflected on the consequences so\nwhat I'm really curious about is when\nyou have these like things that you're\ndoing right so you're a streamer you\nhave game Jam um Publishing House faret\nReserve what I guess I I I'm not so\ninterested in the word the motivation\nisn't really the right word but I think\nit's a place to start so like what\nmotivates you\nlike what is your driving force when you\ndo this stuff like what goes on what I'm\nreally curious about is what is the\nmechanism like what is the experience of\nmotivation for you not necessarily like\nwhat motivates like like like I mean\nlike when you wake up right there's some\nkind of driver that gets you out of bed\nin the morning and I'm kind of curious\nabout what is\nthat it's kind of interesting actually\nbecause I think for me it's definitely\nnot one of those things like oh I have\nto do it right I feel like a lot of\npeople get the oh I don't get that at at\nall I don't have that and I I think I\nused to for some things but I've kind of\ncrafted my life around the things that I\nI just like doing right um for instance\nthe ferret rescue ferret rescue is\nsomething that I didn't plan on doing\noriginally never planned on doing that I\njust knew I lived in California and in\nCalifornia ferrets are illegal so when I\nmoved up to Washington I wanted to get\nferrets I got two ferrets from\nUniversity of Washington uh their names\nare snail snails and Loki uh Loki is\nstill alive today she's like six years\nold snails died 3 years later she had a\nheart condition ferrets would largely\nhave heart conditions here and one of\nthe things that I I realized in that\nmoment is like I'm very sad about this\nthis sucks but also I was like but no\nthat's okay and the reason it's okay is\nbecause in medicine they will kill a\nferet after one year that's how it works\nright because these were laboratory\nanimals and I you know took in\nlaboratory animals she lived through\nthree plus years extra on top of what\nwould have been her lifespan and I\nrealized this is awesome actually it's\nawful that she died but she got three\nextra years her lifespan was quadrupled\nright over what it could have been and\nin that moment I was like I feel good\nabout this I want to do this more and\nthen I started looking into other\nrescues I was like what is the biggest\nthing that plagues rescues where do\npeople fail doing this where do other\ngroups have problems doing this so I\nstarted to break that down and I found\nmost of the time they go the route of\nbeing a 501c3 so they're they're\nnonprofit and they have issues with\nfunding the entire time until eventually\nit closes because ferrets are exotic\nanimals they're incredibly expensive\nit's difficult to take care of them and\nthey collapse over time there's very few\nferret rescues that are out there as a\nresult of this it ends up being really\ndifficult I said how do we fix that the\ncommunity started asking hey can I see\nyour ferrets hey can I see your ferrets\nI was like I'm GNA put them on stream\nand just see what happens so I ran a\ntest it was like maybe this could make a\nlittle bit of money to help get rid of\nthat kind of a problem well now today we\nsit at around 1,200 viewers on there and\nit makes enough money so that I can run\neventually the largest faet rescue in\nthe United States the ad revenue from\nthat alone solved that entire problem so\nthat was me going I like this thing from\nan emotional standpoint I think it does\nobjective good other people seem to like\nit as well let's do a test to see if we\ncan do business in a different way so\nthat it can support itself let's try\nthat it worked let's keep going right\nand that's kind of how I walked my way\nthrough that entire process and and it\nstarted with this is an emotional\nfulfillment thing for me how do I have\nthat emotional fulfillment thing in a\nsustainable way if that makes sense in a\nway where I can make sure that I don't\ncause harm to these animals by putting a\nfinancially inviable situation forward\nand then failing later on and just\nhaving a huge problem for a bunch of\nanimals that I was supposed to be taken\ncare of right so that's kind of my whole\nprocess for walking through that if that\nmakes sense that does so I'm I'm kind of\ncurious and even a little bit skeptical\nis not quite the right word but um I'm\ncurious if there's more so so you're\nsaying you you do this for emotional\nfulfillment that one definitely most\ndefinitely there's something what about\nthe others okay yeah tell say more\nthere's I don't know how to describe\nthis to you there is nothing nicer than\nlike laying on the floor with all these\nfreaking fets right and they're just\nlike they're just awesome animals it's\njust really cool there's a there's a\ndeep emotional thing for me for that and\nI cannot place where that comes from but\nknowing that I have extended the life of\nall of these creatures and they are\nhaving better conditions than they did\nbefore because I I do a lot of medical\nresearch for this I look into all the\ndifferent ways we can treat them part of\nwhat I do is nutrition and medical\nresearch to try and form new treatments\nfor them and in many cases I've been\nable to find ways that we can pass that\noff to the veterinarians that we work\nwith they enacted a plan for them and\nwe've saved their lives that isn't a\nfinancial incentive for me that is 100%\nan emotional incentive for me that feels\nvery good because I know that I'm making\na difference in a way that isn't like a\nfinancial gain difference it's in a it's\nin a this animal gets to live that's\nreally nice and especially in situations\nwhere people treat them really badly so\nI know that I can correct the situation\nand fix it in a way that extends someone\nsome something's life right so I I'm\ncurious Thor do you find that there are\ntwo layers of your and I'm kind of like\nasking a leading question here so you\nstrike me as someone who is not very\nemotionally driven right usually not and\nand so what I'm kind of curious about so\nthat that's why I'm kind of like a\nlittle\nbit confused\nI kind of have a hypothesis but I'm kind\nof curious whether you find that there's\ntwo layers would you say that there's\ntwo layers of your emotional experience\nthere's like one where you're kind of\nit's not like you know you have a lot of\nexercise over it and then there's\nanother layer of emotions that feels\njust feels different right cuz\ngratification of your positive emotions\nokay I don't I don't think there's a\nmulti-layer system there I think that to\nme it's one of those things where it's\nlike I understand that this is a\npositive thing for me I think that I am\ngetting positive kind of feedback from\nthis in a way that's emotional for me\nbut also can I can I do that more in a\nway that adds for other people and adds\nfor these animals it's a mutual benefit\nthing at that point the animals win the\nviewers win I win does that make sense\nit makes a lot of sense I think anything\nthat you'll see that across everything\nthat I try to do is like I don't like\nthe idea of one person winning it's the\nwhole thing of you know Rising tide\nraises All Ships anytime that that's\ngoing on like that's why I brought the\nmoderators on fulltime that's why I do\nall the free knowledge that we can do on\nthe Discord everything that I try to do\nis with that because\nit this is funny because it's it feels\ngreasy otherwise it feels wrong right if\nyou like the the way that I feel about\nit is if I become a millionaire I\nprobably screwed up I did something\nwrong right is like put it into other\nthings that actually have meaning and do\nsomething of tangible benefit and the\nferet rescue to me is definitely an\nemotional fulfillment thing but when\nhaving something like that where the\nstakes are so high where things can go\nwrong and then animals can be hurt\nbecause you didn't plan ahead there has\nto be that logical component of making\nsure it's self- sustainable which is\nexactly what the stream is for so it's\nthe logic side ensuring that the\nsituation is safe enough for me to get\nthe emotional fulfillment and do\nsomething that I think is good that\nhelps other things like the animals you\nthe ferrets and the community because we\nalso spread a bunch of knowledge in that\ntoo try to spread it around can I think\nfor a second sure\nso basically what I'm kind of thinking\nthrough\ninternally is\num slightly more esoteric Concepts so\nI'm kind of hunting for an answer and\nlike so when when I see your life I see\na lot of two things Dharma and Karma so\nDharma is Dharma are you familiar with\nthat term yes that's the things that you\nare obligated to do that you're like\nyou're intended to do versus the\nthings it gets it gets translated as\nDuty usually yeah Duty yeah okay but I\nthink it's a different emotional\nveilance from should so I think it's so\nand then the other thing is is karma so\nlike that that what is happening in your\nlife feels to me like a chemical\nreaction that is playing out that a\ncouple of pieces were put in a few and\nthere was a predisposition for something\nand you're kind of leaning into that\nthat's kind of why I ask about this\ndouble layer of emotion so I find that\nfor a lot of the work that I do there\nthere is like sort of a different\nfeeling so one is like a deeper sense of\nof Dharma or a feeling of like\nrightness which is which can be\nemotionally gratifying but I think that\nthe fluctuation of the emotional\nexperience of those things is almost\nlike independent of this other quality\nand in fact I think that it's the second\nthing that allows me to sustain the\nemotional variance right so like if if\nif I loved streaming and I did it for\npositive emotions\nthen that would not work because the\nemotions are not always positive\nsometimes they're negative so so the key\nthing about Dharma from a almost like a\nscientific perspective is it is that\nwhich allows you to act and persistently\nact outside of the variance of emotions\nand\noutcomes so the reason that I'm kind of\nasking you this kind of stuff is because\nlike like I I get a lot of vibes from\nyou that that track to this concept in\nin the meditative tradition from having\ndone a lot of meditation in a past life\nI think I've mentioned that to you\nbefore because you you have you Intuit\nit a lot of things that are like\nnormally taught\nand so when people when they say like\nokay like so if you if you spawn and\nyou're level like 50 as opposed to level\n10 how do we understand that oh like you\njust xped up prior to spawn and then you\nyou carry over when you respawn you\ncarry over some experience you're saying\nI'm on New Game Plus okay you're on New\nGame Plus yeah beautifully said\nbeautifully said right so many of the\nthings in your life feel very new game\nplush-ish to me so your capacity for\nlike discrimination um and by that I\nmean like being able to like and your\nyour internal awareness Your Capacity to\nlike think through okay like what is the\nis this a good thing or is this not a\ngood thing let me abandon it that's very\nrare so like most of us when we think\nthrough things and it's a bad thing we\nkeep we still keep doing it I can't do\nthat right but that's what I learned at\nthat moment when I was telling you when\nI was homeless it's like I didn't do\nthat before that not really not to the\ncapacity I do now fair enough so so I\nand and this is where I don't know if\nlike you know this is I have a\nparticular way of viewing the world it\ndoesn't make it correct and and we could\nultimately say that everything comes\ndown to just there's just one layer of\nlike emotional veence and that's what it\nis what it is what it is but but really\nlike everything you're describing like\nscreams to me of these two concepts and\nI was just curious if you have\nencountered those before if you think\nabout it because I I don't I've never\nencountered that I I I guess that to me\nthat kind of splits between like emotion\nand logic because the emotional need is\nlike hey this this feels great to do\nthis I feel fulfilled doing this but\nit's beyond that there's like something\nelse there if that makes sense yeah I\ncan't it's hard to describe that's what\nI'm talking about so is there a third\nvariable and the logic is about the\nimplementation so once the driver is\nthere the logic is like you know like\nhow do we do it exactly it's the how\nit's not the it's not the what direction\nyou're going in yeah for me for me it's\nlike like I have I have the the thing is\nlike why do I want to do this how do I\nwant to do this and then at the end of\nit it's like okay if I do this does that\nmake me drop anything else that's a big\none does it get in the way of any other\nthings objectives that I have can I make\nit so that it's sustainable in a way\nthat I can step away from it and it\nworks can I make this so it expands like\nthere's so many different things that go\ninto that it's a lot of pieces if that\nmakes sense yeah but all that comes\nafterward yeah do you get what I'm\nsaying all of it comes afterward so let\nme ask you this is the reason you do it\nbecause it needs to be\ndone I think the world is an objectively\nbetter place if I do it it becomes a\ncompelling Factor how do you understand\nthe specificity of how you make the\nworld a better place like why do you\ncare to make the world a better place in\nparticular\nways I can't make the world a better\nplace in all ways I can do it within my\npurview there is a limit to what I can\ndo as an individual so because of that I\nwant to do that specifically in this\ncase because I can make a difference\nhere it is possible within what I know\nmy knowledge of it my interests and my\nmeans if that makes sense so but there\nare many ways in which you could make a\ndifference how do you decide which ones\nto\ndo is that your emotional response to a\nparticular thing like why farit as\nopposed to anything else so for instance\nif I if I decided to get very deeply\ninto an aspect of something I don't know\nanything about right now it'd be very\nhard to make a difference inside of a\nlike that area the reason why is because\nthere would be a perception that I'm not\nan expert in that area the perception\nfrom the general public means that it's\nmuch harder for you to make a change\nthere make a difference a real\nDifference by going down this route and\nshowing all this stuff with ferrets and\ndoing everything that I have and having\nthis entire all this information all\nthese things that I'm doing it makes it\nmuch easier to make a difference because\nnow we have something that is widely\nseen as being positive force inside of\nthat area now I can actually make a\ndifference but if it's an area that I'm\nstarting from scratch on there's all\nthose pieces that have to fall into\nplace first before people trust you\nenough that you can make a difference if\nthat makes sense it makes a lot of sense\nso so I'm I'm kind of curious cuz I I'm\nI was it\nit my guer counter is going off the\ncharts but when I talk to you about it\nit it doesn't seem accurate right okay\nso so I'll just like share my own\nperspective and I think this is just\nsomething I just got asked waiting for\nthe like the golden question to uncrack\nbecause maybe there's a Mis maybe\nthere's like a piece that's missing\nthere that I don't understand yeah yeah\nno I I I I don't think there is a piece\nthat you you misunderstand that's why\nwhat I'm going to do is just share my\nperspective and I'm curious what you\nthink about it sure\nso I have a logical mind I have an\nemotional mind so if we look at emotions\nlike we also know that there's like Two\nbasic kinds of emotions there's are more\nprimitive emotions like\nanger fear and then we actually have the\nsecond layer of emotions called social\ncognitive emotions completely different\npart of the brain Pride shame guilt that\nthat second layer of higher human order\nemotions requires other humans to be\npresent so a reptile I don't know if a\nreptile ever is capable of feeling\nguilty but a reptile can feel anger or\nfear so these are the layers of the self\nso in my experience there is a third\nlayer of stuff so this is where I would\nsay Dharma and Karma operate so\nsometimes when I'm meditating for\nexample like I have a particular\nlike insight and then I will sometimes\nact on that insight and it's weird like\nsometimes I will not have spoken to\nsomeone in many many years and I'll\nreach out to them and there's something\nkind of going on in their life and it's\nkind of like spooky so like there's some\nsomething about my experience of life\nmakes me think that there's a third\nlayer of stuff and when I think about\nthe work that I do I think about what is\nlogically good and I think about what is\nemotionally\nfulfilling and clinical practice is\nsufficient so in clinical\npractice\nI would did make would make way more\nmoney than I make now because doctors\nget paid very well in the United States\num and so and then I find the work very\nfulfilling like it's like it's great\nlike I love doing it I trained really\nhard at this every day is like fun\nreally yeah\nuh you know I tend to work with people\nfor maybe a year or two so I I don't\nusually work with people for like 10\nyears it's like people come in we help\nthem and then like I get to meet new\npeople very intellectually\nstimulating um you know I I can work a\nlot in a short amount of time plenty of\nspace for leisure activities emotionally\ngratifying and yet something about that\nwas not fulfilling right so I guess\nthat's maybe the dimension that I'm kind\nof talking about is like there's a third\ndimension of emotional veilance and what\nis logic a good idea or a bad idea did\nyou feel like like I guess at that point\nlike beat the level sort of a thing too\ncomfortable uh not necessarily so\nactually it was fulfilling so so this is\nwhere like you know I experienced what I\ncan best be described as a calling right\nso we use we use some of these words\nlike calling and and I think that that\ntracks to things like Dharma or Karma\nand now it makes sense to me like so I\nhave a debt to pay to the internet\nthere's the golden word what the calling\nso tell me it felt like this is correct\nyes yeah so see that's the thing so so\nthis is\ncorrect that doesn't come I'm making a\nstatement here a hypothesis which I'm\nasking you to agree or disagree with in\nmy experience and what I would venture\nfor you is that this doesn't come from\nlogic or emotion no it was a totally\noutside thing where does it come from I\nhave absolutely no idea because when\nthat happened that this is correct that\nwas the moment where I understood that\nsnails died but she had lived three\nextra years and that was the moment\nwhere I was like this is the correct\nthing I want to do this more it wasn't\neven I want to do this more it's I'm\ngoing to do this more yes how do we make\nthat work how do we have that how does\nthat function how do we how do we build\nthis in a way that it isn't like the\nfailures that other people have had how\ndo we build this in a way that it\nactually works do it and then kind of\nthrow everything together make the\nhypothesis all the IC stuff comes in\nafter that yeah so I I smelled it that\nwas I was wondering I was wondering when\nyou were going to come because I was\nlike there's something missing here\nsomething's not being communicated but\nwhat I'm so what I'm so curious about is\nlike I have an understanding this stuff\nand I I can explain it if you want but\nlike I'm I'm so curious because you you\nknow you you you get there on your own\nso I kind of like I can explain it if\nyou want to but that that also like\nthere's some amount of personal\nexploration there's some amount of like\nreading a bunch of books but what I'm\nreally curious about is how do you\nunderstand that I I don't want to\npollute you with\nthe calling portion\nyeah I don't know I think that's one\nthat's kind of outside of my purview\nfrankly and it's it's funny because it's\nnot like a religious experience or\nanything like that it was just like this\nis correct we're going to do this now\nlike that's how that's going to go right\nI'm going to I'm going to take the\nemotional side of this this is\ndefinitely fulfilling in that part it is\nThe Logical side of it we like this can\nbe done right this is possible to be do\nand then also that third esoteric\ncomponent of whatever that is I want to\ndo this this is getting done right and\nthen on top of it it's also the other\nstuff for me too which goes into the\nemotional side of it which is there is a\nreal benefit to the animals there's a\nreal benefit to people that get to\nengage with this and it's it's something\nthat I find to be good in the world\nthat's all on the emotional side and the\nobjective side is like cool like The\nLogical side is like cool it can pay for\nitself I don't have to worry about that\nI never have to worry about it\ncollapsing right if I position this\ncorrectly which is always a thing you\nalways have to figure it out are you\naware of other\nthings that come from that third layer\nso we talked about the Farah thing the\nfa thing is like that's Geer counters\noff the charts but I'm curious like have\nyou noticed that that layer in other\nparts of your life constantly so doing\nfree and open open information I gained\nthat from the hacking Community when I\njoined in with the hacking Community I I\ngo to Defcon and compete and everything\nlike that a big part of being a hacker\nis spreading as much information as\npossible teaching other people to solve\nproblems that are difficult with\ninteresting Solutions right so my\ndiscord's completely structured that way\nI don't need to do that I could\ndefinitely gate that behind a whole\nbunch of pay walls or other but\nthat component says Nope do this free do\nthis free and release it to everyone and\nthat's exactly why I do that is it makes\nsense to do that it is the correct\naction to take you know anytime that I'm\nI'm taking a stance on those types of\nthings there is that extra component is\nnot a not a purely logical not a purely\nemotional it's that third piece and I've\nkind of traveled with those and used\nthose for different reasons of of\nchoosing different things I want to\nfocus on right the ones that are truly\nimportant to me are the ones that that\nthird component takes place and it does\nhappen quite a bit there's a lot of\nthings there and I think it's for me\nthat's what defines me as myself if if\nthat because we all have emotions we all\nhave logic but the things that I decide\nnot even decide the things that I am\ncompelled to do from that third piece is\nwhat I determine to be me if that makes\nsense that yes I think that is\nconsistent so I'm curious what what do\nyou think that third piece is\nthat's difficult to discern me right\nlike everybody's going to have their\nthing I guess that for me is my thing\nwhatever it's going to be and I feel\ncompelled to engage in that thing right\ncan I can I ask um about so I I know\nyou've had a like can I ask about your\nrelationship your\nrelationships sure yeah so I'm curious\ndoes the third element does\nthat have does that inform you about\nanything relating your\nrelationships yeah actually you sh us\nyeah when I um when I I got married\nactually that was a big thing is like\nthat felt correct that felt like it was\nthis was the thing that I want to do\nthis is exactly what it is there's an\nemotional side to it there's a logical\nside to it the emotional side is like\nhey this relationship is really working\nbeen together for a long time this all\nmakes sense logical side is like do you\nhave enough money to buy a ring you're\ngoing to look like a dumbass you know\nlike that it's like a normal one it's\nquite funny but then like also the\nthings is like am I jumping anything too\nsoon does it make sense to actually go\nand try this is anything going to work\nright and then go along with that right\nand yeah that relationship ended really\ndevastating but at the time in that\nmoment I could take that as a definition\nfor me of like this is the right time to\ndo this I feel correct about this for\nall their aspects of this and there's\nthat third component that says go for it\nyou know in terms of getting married\nyeah well in terms of\nyeah what does the third layer say about\nthe end of your\nmarriage that it's fine that that it\ndoesn't always work out and like I for\nme I gained a lot of experience from\nthat I learned a lot there it is even\nthough it ended that's okay and it's\nthis is going to be such a bad like such\na weird way to post it it's like an old\nmultiplayer game right multiplayer games\nare amazing at their Peak they're\nphenomenal and one day that multiplayer\ngame ends nobody's playing it anymore\ndoesn't work and we we kind of can sit\naround and pine for the old day of when\nit was perfect and it was at its peak\nand it's amazing or we could be like I\nwas there I experienced that and I can\nremember that fondly and I can take that\ninto account for the rest of my life you\nknow and that's I see it as the second\npiece you know I I had that experience\nand it was great and I learned a lot\nfrom it there was upsides and downsides\nand I'm happy about it you\nknow yeah so that that's weird man like\nI I'm I'm really like this guer counter\nis going off the charts cuz like this is\nso consistent right so so like this is\nwhere yeah it's so interesting that you\nnever like learned this stuff so this\nlike kind of gives me makes me feel\nspooky because like this is where all\nthe things that you were saying are are\nwritten about right so even your\nperspective like the conclusions that\nyou're coming\nto um the existence of the third layer\nof stuff and uh I don't know where it\ncomes from so yeah no I mean even even\nyour your hesitance to describe it I ask\nyou like what is it and you say it's me\nand you don't give it quality so this\nthis that's the one where it's kind of\ndifficult yeah yeah so this what's\nreally cool is like the Sanskrit\ndescription of what that third place is\nis NTI NTI and NTI is not this so it is\nnot this not this so it cannot be\ndescribed it's not the emotion it's not\nthe logic it's something else it it\ncannot be described it is that which\ncannot be described so it's me right so\nyou can't can't attach words to it and\nit's really interesting because you\ndon't even try to attach words you don't\neven get into that which tells me that\nyou really understand it because you're\nlike okay it doesn't it doesn't have a\nform or a shape it is like that which is\nleft over it's also something that I\nfind I cannot anticipate when it happens\nI'm like Yep this and it's like where'\nthat come from I don't know yeah so\nthat's another feature of it it is\nspontaneous yeah so and there's there's\nno way to plan for it it's an extra\nvariable that shows up is the best way\nto put it yeah yeah so I'm curious\nthough have you found things that get\nyou closer to\nit or things that move you further\naway I would say yes I think there's\ndefining factors there which is why I\ndescribed it as me as self right\nlike a good example of this being\nincredibly transparent with things right\ntransparent with business transparent\nwith the fa res you're transparent with\nthat I found very early on one of the\nfirst things that I wanted to fix was we\nwere starting a game studio and I wanted\nto do a Kickstarter and I found that the\ngeneral standard was there's a whole\nbunch of these games that do\nkickstarters and they run away with the\nmoney so I was like how do I fix that\nand that compelling Factor like stepped\nin and said why don't you stream all of\nit why don't you just show everybody\nright and it kind of breaks the\nperception of oh I can't stream as a\nprogrammer I can't stream as an artist I\ncan't stream these types of things I\ncan't show people the world this and it\nalso breaks the perception of he's not\nworking on anything I can see him\nworking it removes any Whispers of that\nimmediately because people can see it\nthere's a track record for that and I\nthink it was the first thing I was like\nokay that worked here what if that works\nover here what if that works over here\nnow it makes sense now it starts\nstepping away from just being a\ncompulsion there where it's like this is\na standard for me now is make sure that\nthis is always part of things that I do\nas a carrying thread because it's not\njust that it works it's that it is\ncorrect if that makes sense it is a\ncorrect thing in the way that I have\ndefined things it is correct right and I\nfeel like that is a better option in\nfact I've even seen other people\nImplement that we actually have a um a a\nVeterinary here where they have glass\nwindows on everything for absolutely\neverything you can watch your pet in\nsurgery anytime you can see everything\nthat all of the attendants are doing all\nthe way in the back which is a wild\nconcept that's not something you ever\nsee but they have this set up and the\ncustomers like the people come in with\ntheir animals and they're super nervous\nthey're way less stressed out because\nthey see what's going on they know\nwhat's happening they may be upset\nbecause it's a crisis situation but they\ncan see and they don't have to sit there\nwondering is something going to go wrong\nare they going to come out and tell me\nmy dog is dead they can see what's\nhappening they know in real time and\nit's it's actually really interesting\nit's like a really interesting thing so\nI've seen other people implement the\nsame thing and it it makes sense right\nso that's why it feels that way to me\nyeah so so it's it's once again\ninteresting so I I think like there's um\nwhat you describe as transparency I\nwould describe using the Sanskrit word\nSatya which means\ntruthfulness okay there's also like a\nweird there's like weird angles to this\nand I'm I'm just kind of curious but\nlike uh you know so I I also noticed\nthat you're accumulating a lot of Shakti\nor energy so there's like all these like\ntexts that say that when you start\nliving in accordance with Satya you will\naccumulate like energy and things will\nbegin to manifest around you and this is\nvery like spooky and gets turned into\nyou know the secret and like Oprah book\nclub don't put a whole L of into\nthat but but I you know it's just it's\nso interesting to see so many principles\nthat I've learned about or studied about\nand it seems like you're kind of like\nliving them so like when you live a life\nof\ntruthfulness um I certainly found that\nit has been very very like good for me\ntoo so I started like intentionally\nbecoming more and more truthful and\nthere's a there's a really\ninteresting see a lot of people don't\nrealize that being truthful in life\nactually makes your life better and\nmakes you more powerful so if we think\nabout lying lying is all about the\navoidance of consequences and if lying\nis about the avoidance of consequences\nthen you can continue engaging in\nbehavior that you don't have to pay the\nconsequences for and you should be\nbecause it and it's usually more\ninefficient whatever it is absolutely\nyeah and and so the really interesting\nthing is that when when I kind of like\nstopped ly lying I think maybe once in a\nblue moon I'll lie like I want to say\nmaybe two or three times a year but are\nyou lying right\nnow I don't think so maybe this is one\nof the two or three um but but what I\nreally found is that once you stop lying\nit changes your behavior so if you take\nlying off of the table the way that you\nhave to live your life changes yeah and\nI us I was a kid constantly what when I\nwas a kid I lied constantly I was\nconstantly worried of quence I was like\ntrying to avoid all that lie about\neverything right like and I realized\nover time I was like this is this is a\nlot of energy to like upkeep all this\n like because you're constantly like\ntrying to spin the plates on like which\nlie did you tell to who and it just\nturns into this web of just like why\nit's just waste it's all wasted energy\nit's ridiculously wasted energy I I\nthink that was something I grew out of\nbecause it was just stressful and stupid\nright you know it's just a huge waste of\ntime massive waste yeah so that that's\ninteresting because that that's a very\nlogic IAL take and and and that's where\nin sort of these Eastern systems there's\nlike a weird esoteric take which is that\nwhen you say it's a waste of energy they\nalso equate out that leakage of energy\nwith like less manifestation in the\nworld yeah I mean that's absolutely I I\ncould see that being absolutely true but\nnot in a manifestation way the way that\nI see it true is like this if you were\nspending all of your time upkeeping the\nWeb of Lies that you've created how are\nyou forwarding your life where do you\nhave time for that where do you have\ntime to put it into things that could\ngive you benefits going forward you're\nspending all this time maintaining this\n that doesn't actually give you\nanything tangible you could be learning\na skill but doesn't lying to people\nAdvance you in many ways\nlike sometimes but not forever and\nthat's the biggest problem with that is\nif you get caught in a lie it can set\nyou all the way back to ground zero or\nbefore that you could lose everything\nwhen if you spend the time on actually\nlearning something you can spend the\nsame amount of energy doing that you\nkeep that forever\nand that's kind of where that went for\nme it's like yeah I can understand that\nbeing a aspect of manifestation but it's\nnot really a manifestation it's a it's\nlocalized to you yeah it's localized to\nyou there's no connection to outside\nthings that's how it feels to me yeah\nyou are you are creating s scenarios in\nwhich you have more chance of succeeding\nbecause you are spending time on\ncultivating keys for all these doors\nthat you might you know arrive to if\nthat makes sense and otherwise you're\njust spending time on nothing right\nyou're spending time on maintaining this\nbig around here does make sense\nI I think I think there's there's uh\nthat I think that's a fair take I I'm\nstill somewhat conflicted about whether\nthere is some kind of connection to\nOuter things or there is some kind of\nmanifestation and that also gets to this\num you know this third layer because\nwhere does the third layer exist it\ncould be right do you think that the\nthird layer is is completely localized\nto you that I don't know right that's\nsomething that is an impossible question\nto answer it could be a feeling thing it\ncould be like wow you know there's like\nI think a lot of people describe that as\nlike kind of divine intervention right\nlike I had God told me this thing and I\nwent and did the thing because I felt\ncompelled to do it and that came from\nGod right but I'm not really all that\nreligious so for me it's like well if\nthat is a religious experience that's I\ncould describe it as a religious\nexperience but in reality for me it's\nlike does that make sense for me not\nreally because I don't spend a lot of\ntime on that right so it's one of those\nthings where it's like this came from\nsomewhere I don't know where and it's\nthat's like you said it's the not this\nnot this so what is this don't know\nfascinating and I'm okay with not having\nI guess I'm okay with not having the\nanswer there right yeah"
