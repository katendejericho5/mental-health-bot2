    "transcript": "so yeah that's really cool i just like\nchecked out your youtube channel for the\nfirst time it seems really dope\nthank you so tell me a little bit uh\nwhat do you\nwhat do you want to talk about or i\nunderstand you have some questions about\nbipolar disorder\nyeah that i have two main things i want\nto talk about\none about bipolar disorder and like i\nhad a few questions about that\ni've done i haven't been really educated\non that stuff so i want to\nknow more about it and the second topic\nis actually something that i can't find\non the internet\nokay it's it's have you heard on child\non child abuse\nchild on child abuse yes no\nit's when a child abuses another child\ninstead of an\nadult okay so i had some questions about\nthat topic as well sure\nso fire away okay so\ni recently got diagnosed with bipolar\ndisorder or actually i got diagnosed\ntwice\none at the urgent care and one\nby my like psychiatrist that i normally\ngo to\nokay and i was curious if it's something\nthat's genetic or if it's\nlike caused by some incident or\nsomething\nbecause like i haven't been showing\nsymptoms until like\nnow okay that's and um do you mind if i\nask the ballpark of your age oh i'm\ni'm 21. okay all right\nyeah that's an excellent question man\noreo these are fantastic i love\nthat that we're asking so here's how i\nthink about mental illness\nso i think about mental illness as an\nintersection between genetics and\nenvironment\nso is there a genetic component to\nbipolar disorder\nabsolutely but does it mean that you're\ndestined to get it or is it all genetics\nusually not so i'll give you just one\nexample\nso people who have parents who are\nschizophrenic\nmay develop schizophrenia so there's\nsome amount of\nlike possible inheritance of\nschizophrenia i don't remember exactly\nwhat the number is\ni'd ballpark around 30 or 40 percent\nand then people who have a history of\nschizophrenia\na family history of schizophrenia who\nuse marijuana\nespecially at a young age are far more\nlikely to be diagnosed\nwith schizophrenia now the interesting\nthing there is like what is the\ninfluence of marijuana does it cause the\nschizophrenia i don't\nthink so um the best hypothesis that i\nbelieve in is that it unmasks what may\nhave taken longer to occur\nbut you know it's unclear but we do know\nthat marijuana plus family history\nis worse than family history alone and\nwe also know that early onset of\nmarijuana use\nprobably leads to a greater risk of\nmanifesting symptoms of schizophrenia\nso how does that work i mean my sense is\nthat we each have a genetic\npredisposition\nand then based on certain environmental\nfactors like stressors\nthat genetic predisposition can kind of\nlike\nactivate or you're like you're halfway\nso in this in cancer there's something\ncalled the two-hit hypothesis\nwhich which hypothesizes that in order\nto get cancer you need\nmore than one kind of like genetic\nmutation in your cell\nyou need to have one mutation and then\nyou need to have a second mutation\nand those mutations together will cause\ncancer\nso i think that most people may have\nsome predisposition\nor a high risk to develop a mental\nillness\nand then when some circumstances happen\nso for bipolar\ndisorder for example things like\nsubstance use or really just not\nsleeping\nwell for a couple of weeks or even a few\ndays pulling a few all-nighters\ncan really result in the manifestation\nof bipolar disorder\ndoes that answer your question or was it\ntoo good yeah yeah no that was really\nthat was really in-depth and yeah yeah\nthat made sense um\ni i remember talking to my doctor\nbecause i didn't want to take medication\nyep and he um she said that\ni had to because like if i don't sleep\nthen that causes like my mania even more\nyeah i didn't see that as a big thing\nbecause like all teenagers are all like\nyoung adults sleep late i thought that\nwas like a normal thing it is a normal\nthing\nso this is it's a great point right so\nhere's the the thing right so this is\nwhat i mean about the intersection\nabout an environmental factor and a\ngenetic factor\nso all teenagers have screwed up sleep\nschedules\nthe difference is that most teenagers\ndon't have that genetic risk\nwhich is why they can have the\nenvironmental influence and be\ncompletely fine\nbut when you combine that environmental\ninfluence with the genetic risk\nthat's when you get an illness\nso i'll give you just one last example\nso let's think about alcohol\nright so alcohol has also gets\ninherited to a certain degree so if you\nhave parents that are alcoholics you're\nmore likely to be an alcoholic\nand you know people who are 21\ndrink a lot and not all of them become\nalcoholics why\nso when you have an alcoholic a strong\nhistory of alcoholism in your family and\nyou start drinking a lot when you're 21\nyou're much more likely to become\nalcoholic than someone who doesn't have\na family history of alcoholism\nthe other interesting thing that's also\ntrue is that if you have a strong family\nhistory of alcoholism and you don't\ndrink it all\nthen do you become an alcoholic\nwhat do you think wait sorry can you say\nthat again i kind of felt it yeah\nso if if you have a family history of\nalcoholism\nand you don't drink it all do you become\nan alcoholic\nno you become an alcoholic yeah right so\nwhen it comes to bipolar\nuh people who have a diagnosis of\nbipolar disorder\nif you can control your sleep then the\ndisease for the most part\nmay actually like kind of go away\nbecause there are certain risk factors\nthat trigger\nthe disease\nand um when you're diagnosed does that\nusually mean for\ncertain or is that like because i've\nbeen diagnosed with\nso many different things and i'm not\nsure like what\nwhat i have or if like if i even have\nbipolar\ndo you mind if i ask are you diagnosed\nby polar one or bipolar ii\num did they tell you that but\nyeah they said probably one but i'm not\neven sure what the difference is between\none\ntwo and cyclothymia i think that's all\nokay\nwe'll talk about that okay so here's the\nfirst thing\nso i once had a one of my very wise\nmentors\nonce told me that if someone has three\npsychiatric diagnoses they're all wrong\nokay so so what we do is psychiatrists\nsometimes is we tend to like label\npeople\nand then we don't really take label\npeople we don't take labels off\nwe tend to just slap people with more\ndiagnoses they're like oh you're bipolar\nand you have adhd\nand you have anxiety i don't think so\nand so that goes to the nature of\npsychiatric diagnosis which is that\nit's kind of bad so like\nwe don't have a test right so if you\nthink about like cancer\nor like covid we have tests that you can\nobjectively verify\nwhether this person has this illness or\nnot\nbut i can't do a blood test i can't do\nan x-ray\ni can't do any of that stuff to tell you\ndefinitively that you have bipolar\ndisorder\nso psychiatric diagnosis is one of\nobservation\nand guesswork and so what we do\ngenerally speaking with in psychiatric\ndiagnoses is that we have some criteria\nand if people check those boxes they're\nmore\nlikely to have the illness but there are\nsome people who will check the boxes\nand not have the illness like that's\npossible too because it's just checking\nboxes right it's like\nso for depression for example changes in\nsleep\num so being sad\nchanges in sleep feeling guilty\nhaving changes in your energy being\neither psycho\nmotorically agitated or depressed which\nmeans like\nyou kind of like her like this or you're\nlike fidgety\num you know changes in concentration\nsuicidal thinking and the more of those\nyou have the more likely you are to be\ndepressed but\nyou can be sad and suicidal and actually\nnot have clinical depression\nit's possible so it doesn't mean that\nthe diagnoses are right\nit's really an issue in medicine what we\ncall clinical judgment\nas opposed to objective testing\nand sometimes our judgment is wrong\nbecause like you know we don't have\nperfect information\nbecause the information that we rely on\nis like what you tell us\nor what your family members tell us\nand that could be biased right so not\nonly do we have a list of check boxes\nbut then like you know we don't have\nperfect information\nso sometimes we're wrong\ndo you feel like your psychiatrist\nunderstands you as a person\nyes i like my psychiatrist just a lot\nthen i would trust what they had to say\nyeah you know somebody misdiagnosed me\nwith other things\nbefore so like sometimes well it's also\nbecause i\nhaven't been that honest sometimes\nbecause i wasn't very comfortable\nwith soda\nthat probably makes sense but like i\nknow this sounds bizarre but this\nthe sign of a good psychiatrist is one\nwho changes your diagnosis\nthat tells me that your psychiatrist is\nbeing thoughtful\nand is willing to accept that they were\nwrong about something\nand they're actively interpreting new\ninformation\nand reformulating you as a person which\nis actually good\nlike that makes me confident in your\npsychiatrist yeah i took a while for\nthat because like i've had a lot of\nexperiences with other psychiatrists\nwhen i was like\nbecause i i've been getting looking for\nhelp since or getting therapy and like\nand stuff since i was like 16 but\ni've keep getting my case closed and\njust being sent to the mental hospital\nand like they didn't diagnose me and\nthey just give me medication\nand make me take it and then yeah it was\njust it was just crazy\nso like i don't know if\ni did anything wrong or if it was a\nsystem that was wrong\nor if i said something wrong but it's\njust it was crazy\nwhy do you assume that something wrong\nhappened\nmaybe i i said something that or i\nover exaggerated my situation like\nand it wasn't as bad as it was maybe but\nwhy do you assume that you over\nexaggerated why do you assume i mean the\nsystem's not great\nbut yeah like sometimes i feel like i\njust say things\nbecause i want attention okay i\nexaggerated just a little bit\nbecause i want someone to like pay\nattention to me\nbecause i'm lonely or something\nyep yeah i think that's very insightful\nof\nyou to realize right most people go\ntheir entire life without\nwithout ever realizing that [ __ ]\nand they're like 60 and cause problems\nwith their kids and\ngrandkids and become a strange because\nthey never recognize that there are\nparts of themselves\nthat do things that may not be healthy\nso i still think it's great that you\nrecognize that maybe you are doing that\nand also maybe you weren't exaggerating\nyeah i can't tell because like at the\ntime it doesn't feel like\nit is but when i look back it's like oh\nmy god i was so\nlike dramatic yeah so\nthat sometimes happens with people who\nare bipolar\nis the way that you think changes\nright so like you we have this\ninstrument of mind with which we\njudge the world and part of the problem\nespecially with mania is that the\ninstrument that\nwe use to judge whether saying something\nis okay or doing something is okay\nchanges\nand looking back on it it seems like\nkind of\nnuts to other people but to us it feels\ncompletely normal\nin fact we feel very confident\nyeah and that that the rest of the world\nis really really wrong\nyeah i feel like sometimes the rest of\nthe world like doesn't understand and\nthey don't\nlike i'm at a whole new level or\nsomething yeah that sounds like my\nbullet disorder\nyeah cause um i don't i don't know if\nyou you don't own or you don't like\nmanage your twitter right but i was\nactually spamming you guys on twitter\nbecause i was just like oh my god like\nmaybe if i keep messaging this person\nlike i'll have like\nan interview or something so i kind of\nfeel bad about that\ni don't i don't know most of i don't\neven know how to use twitter\noh but i you know\ni think it's okay i apologize to whoever\nis managing\nyeah they must have gotten a lot of\nnotifications just like\non on their behalf i forgive you\nthank you and and i i at the same time i\ndon't want to tell people that it's okay\nto hammer\nyeah i don't because i i don't i don't\nwant them to have to do\ni don't want that to happen so i i don't\nlike i kind of feel guilty that\nthat actually is why i have this\ninterview\nwith you i i don't honestly honestly\noreo i don't know how any of this [ __ ]\nworks\ni just people people tell me to show up\nand then i don't know\nand then so i'm glad you're here though\nbecause i think this is these are\nexcellent questions\nthank you um so your question was\nyou know are do people get psychiatric\ndiagnosis wrong and\ni would say i certainly hope so\ni think that we i certainly hope that\nmost\npsychiatrists out there don't label\nsomeone with one thing and then just\nassume that they're right\nand is it possible to have like other\nsymptoms\nto other disorders that like while\nyou're like manic\nbecause like i was strangely like really\ni thought i was i was like confident i\nhad ocd\nsure for some reason because like i had\nto do things a certain way and like\ni had to like say things like a certain\namount of times and do things a certain\namount of times\nin order for it to be valid\nyeah that was really weird yeah so i\nthink that too is like so mania will\nuncover\nother things which like your normal mind\nis able to manage\nbut when your mind becomes manic like\nyou just can't manage it the way like it\nsort of becomes like\nyou know things and and yeah so i really\nthink about mania as like\nturning the dial up to 100 and all kinds\nof stuff\nso it made turn up the dial in to 100 in\nterms of like ocd symptoms\nit can also turn the dial up to 100 in\nterms of\nenergy and creativity so\nthe interesting thing is that if you\nlook at even harvard college has a\nhigher\nincidence of bipolar disorder than the\nrest of the united states\nand and the reason is because people who\nare a little bit bipolar\ncan get away with only sleeping two to\nfour hours a night\nand have lots of energy to study like\nnot a joke\nno that's like really relatable actually\nhow so\ni kind of now that i'm like evened out\nand like calm i kind of miss being manic\nbecause i was so productive and like\nevery idea that i had was like\namazing and ideas kept flowing and\nthat's usually when my channel started\ngrowing as well as manic it's because i\nposted a lot of videos a lot of content\non like popular things\nand i didn't have any doubts yeah so\ni've worked with\nvery successful artists\nwho have sometimes asked me\nhow can i use my bipolar disorder to\ncreate more\nand they've come to me and they've said\nlike hey i want to stop taking\nmedications for a certain amount of time\nand i want to create\nand then can you put me back on them\nafter a month because i'm not feeling my\ncreative energy do you ever think about\nthat\nyeah that's why i actually wanted to\nstop taking my medications because it\nmade me feel sleepy\nbut my doctor was like no yeah\nand how do you feel about that um i\nthink\nit makes sense because i even though i\nfelt really good\nand i i was at the best state of mind in\nmy\nor that's what i thought like other\npeople were having a hard time like my\nparents like they were really worried\nabout me because\nfor some reason i had this strange\nobsession with america's got talent\ncomedy and um howie mandel\nand i was like i have to go to america's\ngot talent audition for comedy\nspecifically\nand meet howie mandel and touch his bald\nhead\nspecifically i don't know why yeah that\ncertainly\ndoes sound i mean so i understand you\nalready have a diagnosis and just to be\nclear\nclear you know so it's good that you're\nin treatment because otherwise it would\nterrify me\nbecause i don't diagnose people over the\ninternet but this really does sound to\nme like\nmania like it sounds like that's an\nappropriate diagnosis\num one question so one reason that\nbipolar disorder gets misdiagnosed a lot\nis if people are using substances so i\ni would normally ask you do you use\nsubstances but instead what i'm going to\nask you is\ndoes your psychiatrist know truthfully\nwhether you use substances or not\nwe don't need to know what they need to\nknow okay\nanother thing is because i was\nmisdiagnosed with just depression\ni was taking like the wrong medication\nthat actually made my mania even more\nlike\nyeah so yeah unfortunately that is very\ncommon\nso the problem is that we can't diagnose\nsomeone with bipolar so let's just talk\nabout depression and bipolar for a\nsecond\npeople who are bipolar have periods of\ndepression and periods of mania\npeople who are depressed or may have\nmajor depression\nonly have depression right does that\nmake sense\nyeah so now like put yourself in the\nshoes of a psychiatrist let's say\nan 18 year old girl comes in and she is\ndepressed\ndoes she have bipolar or is she does she\nhave depression\ni guess we don't know exactly and that's\nhard\nyeah right so like we just don't feel\nbad for my psychiatrist\ni don't know i know it's their job but\nit must be really difficult\nit's a hard job it sounds like it is but\nit's\nworth it every every cent like i mean\nit's worth it dude\nbecause here's the thing like oreo\nhelping people like you is absolutely\nworth it i don't want my job to be easy\ni want you to get better i want you to\ncontinue to create music\ni want you to like live a happy and\nfulfilling life where you take that\nlittle bit of crazy deep inside you and\nturn it into music which touches people\nin a way that a completely sane person\ncannot\nso this is the other crazy thing is like\nwhy does bipolar disorder exist\nright so like why does it happen and i\ni'm telling you that i think that some\nof the most beautiful things that i've\nseen\nin terms of artistic creation happen\nfrom people who\nare on that bipolar spectrum in some way\nshape or form doesn't mean that they're\nactually man because i think when you're\nfully manic\nyour mind is so like extreme that like\nother people can't appreciate it\nyeah but you're channeling like\nsomething really powerful and when you\ncan get that under\ncontrol and like focus it on artistic\ncreation i genuinely think it's more\nbeautiful than what the average person\ncan make\nwhich is\ni realized i said something that is hard\nto respond to\nno it's just yeah i don't know if i\nshould take that as a compliment\nor yeah like yeah\ni i feel flattered okay\ni mean i think it's just the truth of\nyour situation right it's it's\nauthentically like\nit doesn't mean i mean on one hand\nyou're ill but i don't think it's all\nbad\ni do think that way too yeah like i\ndon't think it's something that people\nshould want\nbut at the same time if you have it like\ni guess appreciate it\nyeah yeah and i think keep it under\ncontrol because like i mean if you're\ntruly manic like\nyou're gonna make music and it's gonna\nbe such a mess\nyeah dude i made him i made a song that\nwas called happy and then i just slammed\nmy keyboard like three times and that\nwas\nthe song it's because i'm so happy you\ncan't even\ncomprehend and they don't comprehend\nright so that's actually not good music\neven though in the mind of someone who's\nmanic it feels like good music\ni thought everything was good yeah\nso highly elevated mood is what mania\nusually entails\nlike everything's perfect um\nyeah i mean and uh other questions\nand we're kind of bouncing around but i\nhave some for you but i want to make\nsure we get\nno i i'm pretty i got through everything\ni wrote up a little doc just in case i\nget\nnervous and forget everything are you\nfeeling nervous\num at first i'm like\nat first i was like really excited and\nthen all of a sudden i just got this\nsurge of nervousness you know the eminem\nsong like\npalm sweaty knees weak mom's spaghetti\nyeah that's how i feel\nyeah that's just a sympathetic nervous\nresponse that's adrenaline\nyeah i feel like so much energy\nokay so do you wanna should we just keep\ntalking through it or do you wanna like\nmeditate for a second or what do you\nwanna do\num i i actually like talking so\nokay i want to keep talking so do you\nwant to tell me about child on child\nabuse then\nuh yeah um recently or\nit's gotten a lot better but i've been\nhaving a lot of flashbacks about my\nchildhood\nand um i know i just\nwant to talk more and learn more about\nthis because i can't find a lot of\nresources\nokay and i i feel like it's more common\nthan it is\nlike than i think it is okay yeah\nand what are we talking about help me\nunderstand what happened oh yeah\num so basically\nwhen i was like nine or eight eight or\nnine i moved to georgia\nand i like lost all my friends because i\nmoved to a different state\nand i met this girl who\nsaid she'd be my friend but only if i do\ncertain things with her\nand it was it was like a relationship\nthat i didn't really\nwant i guess okay\nand she made me like there were times\nwhere i was consensual but at the same\ntime it's like\naren't kids like not able to give\nconsent\nyeah so when you say wanted to do things\ndo you mean like\nintimate things yeah like really\ninappropriate things like things like\nnormal kids don't do\nokay and you were eight or nine and how\nold was the other girl\num she was one year older okay so that's\nkind of [ __ ] up\noh i've only told my close friends and\nmy family and they told me that\nit was pretty normal and i didn't feel\nthat way about it\nthey said a lot of kids like play doctor\nand stuff\nbut it didn't feel it felt like more\nthan that\nokay so now i'm a little bit confused\nbecause what you were describing to me\nand because i when i said that's kind of\n[ __ ] up i was expecting you to say\nyeah but you seemed confused by my\nanswer\nyeah because no one's really told me\nthat\nor maybe a few of my friends but\neveryone else is like yeah\nthat same stuff happened to me and they\nkind of just\ndo you tell them what actually happened\nto you\nyeah in detail actually\nnot in detail because it's kind of\nembarrassing for me for some reason\nbut i just say like they made me\nuncomfortable\nso i'm guessing what they think is\nnormal is not what actually happened to\nyou\nbut they're filling in so when you speak\noreo you're vague oh sorry\nno no it's not it's i'm not asking you\nto applaud i'm pointing it out to you\nokay okay so like for example you said\nthere was a nine-year-old girl and she\nsaid she would be my friend but only if\ni do certain things\nand i don't know if that means\nso my wife used to play a game with her\nsister called princess\nand my wife was the older sister so she\nwould be the princess\nand then her younger sister would be the\nservant so she would just like run\naround and like\nget her candy and like that was the game\nthat they played right so\nso i i don't know and i don't think i\nmean i'm not trying to say that that was\nanything inappropriate i think it's just\nyou know older sister being an older\nsister but like when you say that\nshe said you know you can't be my friend\nunless you do certain things like\ni don't know if that means wear a\ncertain piece of clothing\nor carry around her book bag or do her\nhomework for her\nor something that's like it was like\nsexual activity\nyeah so that's really bizarre for eight\nand nine-year-olds to engage in\nso generally speaking if you take an\naverage nine-year-old off the street\nthey don't really engage in too much\nsexual activity\nusually engaging in sexual activity as a\nnine-year-old or ten-year-old\nis like the you know that sh that's a\nred flag as a\nis a treater for sexual abuse\nbecause how does a nine-year-old learn\nhow to be sexual\nthrough other people i guess absolutely\nright that's where our kids learn\nlike so you know my kids want to be\nprincess\nqueen elsa because they watch frozen all\nthe time and that's what they run around\nand that's what they pretend to be\nand so what kids tend to pretend to be\nis like\nwhat they see\ni had my kid recently put her sheepy in\ntimeout\nand where did she learn to put her\nstuffed animals in timeout it's because\nshe gets put in timeout\nwhen she spent it so it sounds to me\nlike this person\nyou know i that's a red flag in my mind\nthat this person\nthemselves was abused\nyeah i think so too but going back to\nwhat we were talking about so i think\nwhen people say they you know it's\nnormal for kids to play doctor it's also\ni mean i agree it's normal for kids to\nplay doctor\nbut it sounds like what happened between\nyou and this girl was more than playing\ndoctor and if you're being vague\nthen what they're gonna assume is their\nexperience as a kid\nso do you know like what words you use\nto describe this when you're explaining\nit to other people\nprobably the same thing i i'm not i\ndon't remember\nexactly but the same way i was pretty\nvague yeah yeah\nright so it's like i don't know what\nthat means\nyeah i mean so oh sorry i was just gonna\nsay like so in our case we have an\nadvantage because at the beginning of\nthe conversation you said\ni tried to google child on child abuse\nand i didn't see anything\nso that sets a tone for all of the vague\nstuff you say afterward right does that\nmake sense\nso we sort of assume that think\nsomething here is not kosher but unless\nyou say that\nto the other people they're going to\ninterpret it like\nin a non-threatening kind of way\ndo you think um yeah go ahead sorry no\nit's just i've told my parents\nspecifically and they thought it was my\nmom didn't think it was\nnormal but my dad was like oh that's\njust what kids do you know and i was\njust like\nreally and\nyeah i think he it's also because she's\na really\nclose like her dad is a close friend of\nmy dad's\nand she he didn't want anything to\nhappen\nbecause i was like angry to the point\nwhere i actually was thinking about\ntaking this to court\nbecause i felt like i felt like i lost\nsomething like in my childhood like\nmy innocence you know yeah\nhow do you feel right now saying that um\njust\na little angry but at the same time i\ni feel like i shouldn't feel angry\nbecause\ni don't know i i want to blame that\nother person\nbut like i can't because she probably\nwent through\nsomething too and she didn't know what\nshe was doing\nwhat's wrong like she didn't know that\nwhat she was doing was probably wrong\nyeah that doesn't mean you can't blame\nher\nright so so like this is a weird thing\nokay oreo\nbut like let's say that so i've worked\nwith you know patients who have\nhad suffered from abuse by their parents\nand they also hope\nas part of that healing process they\nlearn about their parents and sometimes\nit involves family therapy and they\nlearn that\nyou know part of the reason why their\nparents were abusive was because they in\nturn were abused\nand interestingly enough usually like\nthe abuse actually gets\nbetter with each generation like their\nparents had it way worse\nthan they treated their kid and so it's\nit's an interesting\nkind of tightrope to walk to say\ni understand that you had some things in\nyour past which like pushed you in a\ncertain direction\nand also like you could have not done\nthat\nand you didn't but\ni feel like she didn't understand like\nwhat it meant\nin a way sure i i don't think she did\nbut that doesn't mean that you can't be\nangry at her\noh right so like like let me just say\nlike let's say that two kids are playing\nand then they like\nlike they're gonna play mermaids\nand then they decide to go into a pool\nof water and then like\nyou know like or they fight or let's say\nthey fight\nand then you know they don't they don't\nrecognize that they're fighting because\nthey're playing teenage mutant ninja\nturtles so they like\ngrab two sticks and they start hitting\neach other and one of them smacks the\nother one across the face\nbecause that's what they do in teenage\nthey're like playing martial arts\nand even though they didn't intend to\nhurt that doesn't change the fact that\nthe person who got smacked across the\nface with a stick\nis genuinely hurt and if they lose a\ntooth\nthen like that hurt stays with them\neven if the child didn't know what\nhappened\nand what i'm sensing from you is that\nlike you lost something\nand even if she didn't mean it it\ndoesn't mean that you didn't lose\nsomething\nand it feels okay to be to be angry that\nyou lost something that you shouldn't\nhave\nfeels unfair\nunjust you may also be angry with your\nparents\nare you yeah\nnot my mom but more my dad because my\nmom was really understanding and\nshe she actually apologized because she\nsaid she didn't she thought there was\nnothing\nthat could possibly go wrong with two\nkids you know\nand yeah i'm just more angry at my dad i\nguess\nyeah what are you angry at him for\nfor not understanding\nyeah and\nto defend someone that hurt me\nyeah like i feel like he should\ntake my side like no matter what because\ni'm his daughter\nbut but another thing is like i keep\ncomfort like\nhaving like conflicting conflicting\nthoughts because like my dad's been\nthrough a lot\nmy dad's actually handicapped and he's\num he's been in the hospital for 19\nyears so i could understand why he's\nlike\nreally he like i don't know i feel like\nmy problems are like less\nin a sense so maybe that's why he\ncan understand i don't know\ncan i think for a second yeah\ntakes a lot of courage to say this stuff\ndo you feel courageous not really\ni just feel like i'm stating what\nhappened\nlike when i think of courageous i think\nof like superheroes saving like\na cat from a like getting run over by a\ntruck\ni can understand that and when i think\nabout some of the most courageous people\nin the history of humanity\nsome of them just said what happened\nright yeah so it's interesting\n[Laughter]\nyeah that's true it's interesting how\nsometimes we can't see ourselves\nthe way that we deserve to be seen\nmaybe you should reevaluate your\ndiagnosis of yourself\nand how awesome you are\nso\noreo we have a couple of different\ndirections to go\num since you are thankfully in treatment\ndo you talk to your psychiatrist about\nthis stuff by the way\ni'm not my psychiatrist but i'm thinking\nof telling my therapist because my\ni try to talk to my psychiatrist and\nshe's like you should talk to this\nwith your therapist okay so it sounds\nlike your psychiatrist mostly manages\nyour medication\nyeah okay so i would highly recommend\nthat\nso we have a couple of options so what\ni'd like to do is actually teach you\nsomething that's a little bit more\neastern because i'm noticing that your\nmind is doing a couple of things\nand i'd like to teach you maybe\nsomething that's not so much talking\nabout\nthis particular thing but\nyou seem conflicted to me\nabout the way that you feel what do you\nthink\nyeah i can see that it's very conflicted\ndo you feel conflicted\nso what i'd like to help you do is maybe\nget to some sense of peace\nover that conflict and this has really\nnothing to do with\nwhat happened to you in a sense it all\nhas to do with how does a human being\nwho feels conflicted about something\ncome to peace with their inner conflict\nor what we can do is talk more\nabout the actual child on child abuse\nand your\nyour your feelings and whether they're\njustified and explore those\nbut i think a therapist can do that\nwhat what do you think i mean do you\nwanna do you wanna i actually\ndo have one more thing i want to mention\nbecause i have another incident\nwhen i was um around 12 or 13 when i was\nat korea\nby another family member and\nthat also felt similar in a sense\nbecause\nthey were my family member and i didn't\ni couldn't it's just conflicting because\ni couldn't tell if they were dude like\nthey had ill intent and they were\ndoing something wrong or if they were\ngenuinely like\njust trying to help me i guess\noh sorry i was vague again good you\nnoticed\nyeah um basically what happened was\nwhile i was sleeping\num this was next to my mom and my\nbrother we all shared one bed\nbecause there was only one room um my\nuncle\ncame in and he\nstarted to massage my leg and everyone\nelse was sleeping\nhe started massaging my leg and i\nremembered like my parents telling me he\ndoes this thing where he like massages\npeople because he's really good at it or\nsomething but then\nit made me really uncomfortable because\nhe he did it at night\nand without telling me and then he\nslowly like went up\nand started touching me in places where\nlike made me feel really uncomfortable\nyeah that doesn't sound kosher to me\nyeah\nbut again my dad comes in place here\nbecause my dad was like oh no he's just\nmassaging you like that's like\na thing he does because he's really good\nat it or something and i was just like\nbut\ni mean it didn't has he ever massaged\nyour dad's dick\nno i don't think so but my mom told me\nshe had a similar experience\nwith me like with not with me but like\nthat with what happened to me the guy\nsounds like he's\nhe's holding back and should be giving\nthe same service to his male clients too\nlike i mean i don't mean to be an\n[ __ ] but like that doesn't sound like\na massage to me\nright so i think that's where once again\nmaybe\nso we're i'm noticing a couple of\ndisturbing patterns\none is so one is it could be vague right\nso it could be the vagueness and because\nlike maybe he's massaged your dad's\nupper thigh but never like\ncrossed the barrier from thigh to like\nscrotum like that's\nmaybe right and it sounds like he really\ndid touch you in places that were\ninappropriate and i think generally\nspeaking i would trust your instinct\nabout that\nand it also sounds like it happened to\nyour mom\nand you know so like i would trust your\ninstinct about that like i forget the\nexact statistics but\nyou know most people who molest children\nor people who are like close to them in\nsome way\nit's not like strangers off the street\nit's like family members and [ __ ]\nand that's really sad\nand then the other thing that i'm i'm\nnoticing is that that like you know\ni'm curious oreo how did you feel when\nyour dad\nsaid he does that to everyone\ni cried like really\nyeah it's just really upsetting because\ni don't think he\nmaybe it's because i was vague but i\ndon't think he understood like\nhow uncomfortable it made me feel and\nhow like\nthe boundaries he crossed and what made\nit hard for you to tell your dad\ni think not only because he's a dude\nbecause that's also a bit uncomfortable\nbut\ni feel like he's been through so much\nworse\nand yeah i don't know i just keep\ncomparing\nlike i don't want to make it a\ncompetition but like\nthat's what we're gonna get to yeah so\nwe'll get to\nthat's sort of the eastern thing that i\nfeel guilty because like\neverything else is in my life is like\nfine like i have a great family\ni have a lot of friends and i have a\ngreat job\nbut it's just little things i feel like\nwhat do you feel guilty for\nguilty for not being happy\nsometimes when i have like\nso much privilege i feel like i know\na lot of a lot of people tell me because\ni'm\nasian american i have a lot of privilege\neven though like i'm like what the only\nminority that has like privilege because\nlike my family's well off and no one's\nreally racist against\nasians or something i don't know like\nlike\ni don't know i it's just i heard a lot\nof things\nyeah so i how do you feel when they say\nthat\ni think it's so wrong\nbecause i don't it doesn't matter if\nyou're like whatever\nwhat what the color of your skin is or\nwhat race you are i think everyone has\nlike their own story to tell in their\nown issues but\nevery time that gets like put down\ni kind of lose hope yep\nand i can understand why it's almost\nlike i mean it's weird because there's\nan interesting parallel there between\nyour dad and what people tell you which\nis that you're not allowed to feel the\nway that you\nyou do you're wrong oreo\nyou're mistaken that your feelings of\nsuffering\nand hurt are incorrect\nyou're a bad korean girl for feeling\n[Laughter]\nright\ni think indian people are pretty similar\nthere\nwhat are you complaining about um\njust i don't know i don't think\ni'm complaining it's just things that\nupset me in the past\ni mean i was i was being uh facetious i\nwas playing a character\noh oh okay i think you have every right\nto complain\ni mean i think so like this is the\nchallenge right with privilege which\nmaybe is a conversation for a different\nday but so as someone who's a clinician\nit's hard for me to i mean we'll talk\nso i think this all actually goes back\nto the central concept which i want to\nteach you about\nso hold on comparison\nokay but i think it's like hard because\nlike you know you look at things like\nwhite male privilege\nand there's certainly some data to\nsuggest support that right like so if\nyou're like a white person versus a\nblack person you get pulled over by a\npolice officer\nthe way that the police officer like\nyour odds do get influenced by your race\nso that's true and at the same time 68\nto 69 percent\nof people who kill themselves in this\ncountry are white men\nso it's like where's the privilege\nthere right so like people assume and\nwe'll get to this\nso in your case like i think you do have\nadvantages and you do have a lot to be\ngrateful for\nthat does not somewhere along the way\nlike privilege became like\nabout one axis and that just doesn't\nmake sense to me\nit's like sure you have a lot of\nprivilege and i think you should be\ngrateful for that i certainly have a\nhell of a lot of privilege\nand i'm grateful for that and at the\nsame time that doesn't\ninvalidate the fact that it sounds like\nyou were sexually molested by two people\nhave bipolar disorder and like your\nfamily didn't take it seriously\nlike the fact that you're [ __ ] korean\ndoesn't\nchange that horrible truth that you have\nto deal with\nand in the grand scheme of things i\ndon't think it makes up for it either\nyou know like do you have particular\nadvantages because you're korean like\nabsolutely sure\nshould you be grateful for those\nabsolutely sure should you help other\npeople who don't have those kinds of\nadvantages\nabsolutely sure but it doesn't mean that\nyou don't get to suffer too\nright your privilege does not give\nother people the license to invalidate\nwho you are as a person which is i think\none of the saddest things that's\nhappened to you\nlike the really crushing thing if i can\njust go there for a second\nwhat happened to you is bad but what\nreally i think is the loss of innocence\nis not what happened to you it's the way\nthat your dad responded\nright because like what a dad is\nsupposed to do in that situation is\nprotect his little girl\nand that didn't happen and that's what\nhurts\nlike that's what hurts me it's like i\nknow [ __ ] happens but like\nwhen someone who's supposed to take care\nof you doesn't take care of you and in\nfact\nprotects your abuser that's what feels\nbad to me\nand i would hate myself for the rest of\nmy life if i ever did that to one of my\ndaughters\ni think it's the shittiest thing you can\npossibly do\nanyway i'm going to need a moment\nbecause now i have\nbut i didn't think i'd get emotional\nbecause it's usually hard to crack me\ni mean it's easy to crack me\nthoughts questions\nno everything you said made sense it's\njust all coming together\nlike i'm really glad i brought this\ntopic up i was like debating because\ni i guess i was kind of afraid i'd hear\nthe same thing\nother people told me or like what my dad\ntold me\nbut i'm relieved\nwhat are you really what's relieving to\nhear\nthat what i went through wasn't\ngood but like yeah it wasn't good at all\nand i don't know just but\njust to hear someone that can understand\nlike the pain that i went through\nit's just really relieving refreshing\nyeah i'm i'm happy you feel that way and\nit's it's interesting that you feel like\ni understand your pain because i\ni really don't i don't know it's just no\ni i feel\nlike yeah yeah i mean because but i i\nthink that's\nthat's actually the amazing thing right\nis that like human beings can connect\nand support each other without\nknow without truly understanding\nand and i think it's really really sad\nwhat happened to you and i don't think\nit's fair\nand i do think you lost something\ni do however think that you're gonna be\nokay\nand i do think i'm gonna be okay too\nyeah i i do think that just because you\nlost something\ni gave this this five-minute rant before\nwe started talking about how instead of\nyou know avoiding taking damage what you\nneed to learn how to do is heal\nbecause then you can take damage and\nthis is a great example right so i think\noreo everything that i see tells me that\nyou're\nan intelligent capable caring\nand talented young woman who has a lot\nto give to the world\nand most of it is positive\nand i'm you know i think i'm in your\ncorner\num yeah that's another one of those\nthings that i don't know how you're\nsupposed to respond to\nyeah thank you\nokay so let's talk about you have other\nthoughts questions can i\nteach you something yeah teach me\nsomething okay so i want to teach you\nsomething called\nadvice so this is a sanskrit word\nthat means non-dual\nso if we look at human beings and why\nthey have conflict\nright so like let's take the conflict\nthat you have over your dad where you\nwant to blame him for something\nbecause let's be fair he [ __ ] up\nand and then what you but you all you\nalso want to do is like\nkind of acknowledge that it's not\nentirely his fault right so there's a\npart of you that's like\ndamn it dad you know you did something\nreally bad to me and there's another\npart of you that's like he's been in a\nhospital for 19 years\nyou know he suffers a lot too it's sort\nof like not\nfair to blame him so there's like to\nblame him\nand there's like the let's feel sorry\nfor him and it's not his fault\nright and we can see that with that\nother girl that you were talking about\nas well where it's like there's a part\nof you that's like\ni want to blame her because she hurt me\nand also like she was only a young girl\ntoo she didn't know what she was doing\nand that's the conflict so sometimes in\nlife we have a part of us that\nyou know has black and a part of us that\nhas white so you can see this kind of\nconcept in the yin yang\nand so what advaith means is that the\nway to get to peace\nis to be non-doom so to not\nseparate two things and choose one over\nthe other\nbecause generally speaking as human\nbeings what we try to do\nis we try to like we think about the\nresolution of conflict as one winning\nright and like you think through it\nyou're like okay i'm not going to blame\nhim at the end of the day and then my\nmind will it be at peace\nif i stop blaming my dad or it'll also\nbe at peace if you do blame him and then\nit's like conflict complete\nyou with me there's like a battle and\none needs to win\nso the concept of advaith is actually\nthat like\nneither one needs to win and what you\nneed to learn\nis how to sit with both conflicting\ntruths\nat the same time so and it's kind of\nweird but like\nfor you to say that my dad suffers a lot\nand and maybe he deserves some amount of\nforgiveness or leeway\nand instead of using but you use and\nso we say like oh like what he did was\nreally bad\nbut he suffers a lot too and so what but\ndoes what the word but does\nis it invalidates the first part of the\nstatement\nlike i think you're a really wonderful\nperson but\nyou know and then it's like it doesn't\ndoesn't matter what you said first right\nand and so what i i'd like to try to\nteach you how to start\nto do today is to replace the word but\nin your mind with and\nthat he suffered a lot and at the same\ntime\nhe really should have done something\ndifferently\nthat and this is kind of what i was\nsaying about you know the kids who were\nfighting that like\nwhat that girl did to you hurt you a lot\nand at the same time if you can sit with\nthat that that wasn't fair to you\nand at the same reason she didn't know\nwhat she was doing\nwhich doesn't really absolve like it's\nsort of like we're not gonna blame her\nbut we still\nallow ourselves to feel hurt at the same\ntime\nyou know because maybe on some level she\ndid know what she was doing\nright like like it sounded like she was\nsociopathic and she understood that you\nwere lonely\nand she used that loneliness against you\nin a malevolent\nway and i don't know where we got off\nthinking that children aren't malevolent\nbecause children are some of the biggest\n[ __ ] on the planet like seriously\ni'm not kidding it's not a joke it's\nlike they're some of the most\nspiteful and hurtful people out there i\nknow it sounds funny\ni laugh too yeah but i mean children can\nbe very cruel\nlike i remember when i was growing up\nsome of\nthe people in my school like we had a\nhandicapped teacher\nwho was in a wheelchair and like a group\nof 10 year old kids like they were\n[ __ ] relentless\nand it's like one of the saddest things\nto see like how cruel children can be\nand sometimes kids are good and\nsometimes kids are bad and do we give\nthem excuses sure\nbut so i i think the the goal here is to\nlike think about advaith which is like\nhow can you sit with both of these\ntruths at the same time\nthat something did happen to you that\nwas bad and that people hurt you\nand that people who should have\nprotected you didn't protect you\nand that pain is there like it's done\nand at the same time\nhow can you also forgive\nand how can you continue to love your\ndad it sounds to me like you love your\ndad\nright and so how can you sit with the\nfeeling of like\nhe wasn't there for me and love him at\nthe same time\nbecause those two things appear to\nconflict\nand what i'm what i'm sensing you in you\nis that your love is trying to\novercome your anger with him\nand there's a war am i pissed at dad or\ndo i love dad\ndoes that make sense and who do you\nthink is winning the war right now\nlove or anger for me\nlove because my dad's been there for me\nthrough like really tough times too\nlike he makes mistakes as well so\nyeah so so that's what i sense in you\nand at the same time for you to really\nbe at peace\nso we can understand that if love wins\nlike that's good right\nlove triumphing over anger is good but i\nactually don't think it's\nthe best i think what's the best is to\nhave\nlove in your heart and to have anger\nand to acknowledge that like i do\ndeserve to feel this way and i can love\nmy dad\nand and he can [ __ ] up just because i\nlove him doesn't mean that he can't [ __ ]\nup\nand when you say it like that it's like\nduh but that's not how we feel\nright because then when you feel angry\nat your dad how do you feel about\nfeeling angry\nwhat do you tell yourself you scream\nokay so what do you tell yourself when\nyou feel angry with him\num it's kind of a read my mind question\nbut i'm digging for a particular answer\nwhich\ni'm gonna see if i can phrase the\nquestions properly but\nlike when you yeah so so like when you\nfeel angry at your dad\nlater on how do you feel about being\nangry with him\ni don't know why i feel like this is a\ntrick question yeah yeah it's weird i'm\nasking it in a bad way so that's my\nfault\nso i would guess that you feel guilty\nfor feeling angry with him\nyeah right it's like weird like you and\nand like what is that guilt like what\nkind of thoughts do you have\nwhen you get like i should have known\nbetter like he's been through a lot\nand yeah right and and so what are you\ndoing there like i know it's kind of\nthat's kind of a weird question too but\nwhat are you doing to the angry part of\nyou\ni'm invalidating it absolutely\nright so you're telling and you're in a\nbizarre way that's exactly what your dad\ndid\nright he was like oh it's not that big\nof a deal\nyou shouldn't feel that way that's the\nwrong way to feel oreo\ndoes that make sense\nand and so i think what you've got to do\nis like learn how to sit with all of\nthose things\nall at the same time and the the way to\nnot feel guilty is to actually like be\nable to be angry with him\nand is there any part of you tiny tiny\npart of you that hates your dad\nyeah right so so that\nthat deserves to be there too what do\nyou hate him for\nfor just brushing off my problems\nyeah and do you think that's a\nreasonable way to feel\ndo you love your dad how do you love and\nhate him at the same time\num rather than hate i guess it's okay to\nbe\nangry and love my dad\ncan you feel those at the same time\nand so do you feel like yeah so so i i\nthink the interesting thing is that the\nmore you do that i suspect the less\nguilty you'll start to feel\nand if we really think about the guilt\nthe guilt is i think what\ncauses the most conflict\ndoes that make sense like i think it's\nthe guilt that\nthat's you fighting against yourself\nbecause you have the anger and the\nguilt's like no oreo\nwrong don't feel that way and that's the\nconflict so if we want you to be at\npeace we have to let you feel the love\nwith one hand\nand let you feel the anger with the\nother\nwhat do you does that do you know how to\ndo that do you can you imagine how to do\nthat\ni guess when i'm angry you just be angry\nbut when i feel better\nfeel better yeah that's i it's\ninteresting or your your\nsome of your answers are vague and the\nones that\naren't are simply beautiful because they\ncapture the essence of it\nit's like a zen master kind of thing you\nknow because the zen masters are like\nwhen you are angry be angry\nand when you are done be done it's like\nsaid\nit's really like simple kind of [ __ ]\nthat's like super profound\nyeah quotes and and i i think so right\nso let yourself feel what you feel\nand acknowledge that you don't have to\nhave one win over the other that you can\nhave both\nthat can you can say like oh i'm a good\nperson\nand i'm a bad person\nand even when it comes to something like\nbipolar disorder like it sucks to have\nbipolar disorder\nand it's part of what makes me who i am\nand some of that energy is going to help\nme create or has helped\nme create and even if you're not\nactively manic or actively\ndepressed you're still going to be\ncreating\nthat bipolar is still down there\nunderneath the surface and it's fueling\nyou a little bit\nand i think it's just about finding that\nbalance\nall right i feel like i've been talking\nat you for a while what do you think\ni learned a lot good i'm glad\ndo you have that was that was kind of my\nspiel\nhow do you feel about you know today's\nconversation\nit was really nice like i was i actually\nhad a nightmare\nabout how this conversation would go i\nhad a dream\nwhere you were like at my house and we\nwere having like we were talking\nand then you made me throw away\neverything that i liked\nyou were just like you like this throw\nit away it's a problem and you like\nthrow it you did it across the window\nand then the window would break and then\neverything else would break and i'm just\nlike no\nmy nintendo ds\nthat's scary man\nfor some reason i had this fear that you\nwould like i think i was nervous because\ni thought you would jump out of the\nscreen and like grab my nintendo ds and\nmute it out the window\nyeah that sounds really scary you know\nit's interesting because you know being\na streamer i understand that sometimes\nstreamers find their ways into people's\ndreams\nbut this is not what i expect\nthe representation of dr k in in\ndreams is is someone who throws away\nthings\nwhat i expect is that you know when dr k\nfinds his way into a young woman's\ndreams that that\nthat means something else but\n[Laughter]\nbut yeah i mean i'm glad that it sounds\nlike that's not what we're doing here\ntoday\nso yeah i mean it's sound\nyou know good i'm i'm glad that i didn't\nmake you throw out your nintendo ds\nyes i'm very glad to what do you play on\nds\nby the way pokemon and chrono trigger\nreally wow chrono trigger is amazing\noh i just i played it for the first time\nso like i'm\nlike halfway finished so it's really\ngood i love it so much yeah\nit's like one of these boomer games that\ni'm i'm happy that the younger\ngeneration is playing photographer\nbecause it's\none of the greatest games that's ever\nbeen made\nit was very revolutionary in a lot of\nways\ni won't say now because you're halfway\nthrough\nyeah don't spoil yeah no spoiler you\nknow do you have a switch\nyes i have a switch light\nwhat's the difference between the switch\nlight and the switch um the switch you\ncould actually like\nto connect it to the tv and take the\ncontrollers out but the switch light is\nlike a console like\nit's like oh it's like a handheld a ds\nbut without yeah it's a handheld okay so\nyou can't\ntake the things out yeah and you can't\nplug it to the tv either\noh interesting okay yeah cool\nall right so we anything else i mean it\nfeels to me like we're kind of done\nyeah i i think we talked about\neverything i wanted to talk about\nyeah are you okay with the amount that\nwe got into it like\ndo you feel like you wanna okay felt\nokay to me too\num yeah did you have any other questions\nyou mentioned cyclothymia earlier do you\nunderstand like bipolar 1 bipolar 2 and\ncyclothymia\noh yeah i don't think you got through\nthat yeah yet\nso we'll do that very quickly so bipolar\ndisorder has\ntwo variants and\none is like depression with something\ncalled hypomania and the other one is\ndepression with\nfull mania so hypomania is like this\nkind of like middle level\nof elevated energy so people sleep a\nlittle bit less they tend to be\nsuper productive this is the thing that\nall the kids at harvard college\ndon't want to get rid of because it\nactually is like helps them perform\nso they can study for 12 hours a day\nsleep four hours a night\nthey feel generally pretty good the\nproblem is that most\nperiods of mania and hypomania have this\nkind of like\ncrash afterward which feels like\ndepression\ntrue mania is when you know generally\nspeaking i think about like periods of\ntime without going\nreally with very little to no sleep very\nhigh energy level\nvery high positive mood and a mind that\nis super super active and like is not\noperating with the same set of rules\nthat\nnormal minds operate with so you know\npeople will think that they like\nlike they'll like really believe that\nthey've come up with the cure for cancer\nor solved the problem for like you know\nendless energy and figured out how to\nharness a hundred percent of the energy\nfrom the sun\nand like these other kinds of like ideas\nthat seem quite extreme\num and mania especially can be quite\ndangerous because sometimes people can\nactually become like psychotic\nand by psychotic they can start to have\nvery distorted perceptions of reality\nlike sometimes they'll start to think\nthat they're like the incarnation of\njesus or things like that\nand so that's bipolar one and bipolar\ntwo both of them have depression and\nthen one has like\nmania and then one has maniolite\nand which then has bipolar one is true\nmania\nuh bipolar two is mania white\nthere is some confusion in terms of\ndiagnosis so the interesting thing about\nbipolar disorder is that most people\nhave their first manic episode like\nbefore the age of 23. so reason i ask\nyou your age\nis because you know when i have a 17\nyear old who i diagnose with depression\nin the back of my mind there's a clock\nthat's ticking\nand it's that if they're going to become\nmanic it'll happen in the next couple of\nyears\nand so i tend to look out for it but i'm\nnot gonna put people\non bipolar medication until i know\nthey're bipolar\num you know just a couple and so\ncyclothymia is sort of a low level of\nboth i\nmemory serves i'm a bit rusty on that\nbecause i don't work with a whole lot of\npeople with psychothemia\num and the last thing is you know when\nit comes to\nto medication with bipolar disorder uh\nyou know i think that it can be very\nhelpful but i also don't think it's like\na lifelong sentence\nso this i disagree with many of my\ncolleagues so i've had\nother people i've had patients who have\nbipolar disorder\nwho have taken off of all medication and\nthey're doing fine\ni would not recommend that for you so i\nwould trust your psychiatrist but i\nthink those people\nyour brain is still developing and like\nyou said teenagers have messed up sleep\nschedules\nso in your case sleep is actually like a\nrisk factor\nfor your mental illness so if you don't\nsleep well you can literally become\nmanic or depressed so in the cases of\npeople who don't need medication\nusually it's full adults whose brains\nhave developed\nand then also like being very very\ncareful about\nso for example i worked with one person\nwho was a physician\nand they would travel internationally to\npresent their research\nand every time they traveled\ninternationally and if they dealt with\njet lag\nwe would put them on medication before\nthey traveled\nthey would go go to the conference have\nthe medication on board\nspeak at the conference be jet lagged\ncome back and then taper off of the\nmedication\nright so the real risk factor is like\nmessed up sleep so i do think that you\ncan sort of manage it\nat some point but like trust your doctor\nand i think in your case specifically\nespecially for students\ni'm very hesitant if they need\nmedication i keep them on it\nbecause you're at a stage of your life\nwhere you can't afford to like go manic\nand [ __ ] up your life\nand and people can really [ __ ] up their\nlives like in in bad ways\num but but you know i do think that it's\npossible to do\npretty well with low levels of\nmedication or even no medication in some\ncases it just depends on the person\nbut it sounds to me like you have a very\ngood psychiatrist and it sounds like you\ntrust them and i would really trust them\nbecause the hard thing is that you don't\nremember what you're like when you're\nmanic\nyeah whereas the people who see you are\nlike\nyou really can't be doing that it seems\nless bad to you than\nwhen you sit with a truly manic person\nit's like\nthey can't do anything and what i see in\nyou oreo is someone who has a\nbudding or successful music career and\nwhat you need more than anything else is\nstability of growth\nbecause if you go awol and disappear for\nlike six months like i don't know what's\ngoing to happen to your career\nbut generally speaking you know stable\nproduction is the most important thing\nfor you right now\nso i'd stick with the medicine that's\nwhat your psychiatrist tells you to do\nokay\nhow do you feel about meditation uh\ni think it's pretty cool i'd be down to\ntry it\nwhat are we going to teach you is the\nquestion\ni've done like breathing meditation\ndo you want to do something else\nsure\nwhat do you want to change about your\nlife\nin what way do you want to grow um\n[Music]\ni want to ex expand\nfrom music and like make more things\ni guess create more like different\nthings like i eventually want to make a\ngame\nso i want to learn things that i'm not\ncomfortable with\nlike programming okay\ndo you still feel like you have a lot of\nenergy in you\num no i feel pretty normal\nokay\nso i'm going to teach you something i\nhaven't taught on in a while but i think\nit's going to be a good practice for you\nit's actually a cleansing practice and i\nthink it's going to help you manage\nhyperactivity and calmness\nuh it's also a practice that works\nreally well for anxiety so\ni'm gonna teach you a practice called\nbellows breathing\nit's another breathing practice\nme just double check with myself\nyeah so i'm gonna tack on something at\nthe end okay\nso we're gonna we're gonna sort of sit\nwith this idea of advice\ntowards the end of our practice okay but\nwhat i want to help you do\nis teach you a technique\noh one second\nhello\nno dude you can't teach her quindalin\nthat's bad for people\nyeah nope okay\nnope\nsomeone tried to give me a suggestion as\nto what to teach you but i think that\nthat is dangerous for people who have\nbipolar disorder\nokay at least not yet\nyou need to be purified before you do\nthis\num okay so\nso i think this will be good so what i\nwant you to do is sit up straight\nand do you know how to abdominally\nbreathe\ndo you know how to do belly breathing\nit's like\nfor singing breathing through your\ndiaphragm yep very good\nso like when you breathe in your stomach\ngoes out\nand when you breathe out your stomach\ngoes in\ndoes that make sense so let's just try\nthat so i want you to just do\nthree belly breaths so breathe your\ntimer so breathe in\nand then out\nthrough your nose\ngood so for people who are watching when\nyou breathe in your stomach should\nexpand so make your belly big\nand when you breathe out pull your navel\ntowards your spine\nso suck in your navel and pull it all\nthe way towards your spine and breathe\nout very good\nso now what i'm going to teach you oreo\nis\nis forceful exhalations with passive\ninhalations\nso what i'm going to do is i'm going to\ndo like nine breaths\nwhere what i'm going to focus on is like\na sharp exhalation\nand as quickly as i can another sharp\nexhalation\nthere's going to be a very small\ninhalation in between\nbut i'll demonstrate okay okay\ncould you tell what i was doing inhaling\nlike really quickly exhaling really\nquickly oh exhaling\nyeah so it's like a you're like pushing\nall the air out\nyeah so push all the air out fast\ngood now try to try to do nine breaths\nin a row\nas large and as forceful as you can do\nso breathe in so take one big deep\nbreath and then go\nboom boom boom okay boom boom\nokay go ahead let's see\nokay good so now so sit up straight\nand now we're gonna do 15 okay so we're\ngoing to close our eyes\nand we're going to do 15 hard\nexhalations\nand you'll kind of feel that recoil of\nthe inhalation afterward and try to push\nit out again\nokay okay so deep breath in and 15\nbreaths\nokay good so now we're going to do the\nnext phase we're going to do 15 more\nbreaths\nand after you finish the 15 i want you\nto just\nnotice like how chill you feel\nso you're gonna take one really long\nsuper slow breath\nand just sit in that space so there's\ngonna be the frenzied breathing followed\nby like the post\ncalm okay so after i\nexhale then i breathe in again and then\nso\n15 sharp no no 15 sharp exhalations\nand then just stop and do whatever your\nbreath naturally wants to do\nand just chill in the space of mind\nthat you create through those 15\nexhalations\nand so we're going to be in kind of\nsilent meditation afterward for like a\nminute\nokay okay so eyes closed sit up straight\nand begin 15 breaths go\nnow i want you to feel your heartbeat\neyes closed\nor listen to it with headphones you may\nbe able to hear it\ncan you feel it or hear it\ni feel it okay so i want you to\nnotice that the feeling has\nhas two thumps you feel both of the\nthumps\nokay so now we're going to do the third\nphase of the practice so you can open\nyour eyes\nso what i'm going to do is have you do\n30 breaths 30 exhalations\nfollowed by a period of silent\nmeditation and i want you to pay\nattention to the feel of your heartbeat\nand what i'm going to do after maybe\nabout 30 seconds of silent meditation is\ni want you to keep your eyes closed\nand then i'm going to guide you in some\nways and just listen to what i say maybe\nit'll make sense maybe it won't\nno big deal okay and the total practice\nwill\nlast about two or three minutes of\nsilent meditation\nafter you do the 30 breaths so the whole\nthing will take maybe about\nfive minutes you good any questions\nokay sit up straight\ntake a deep breath in and begin 30\nbreaths\nand now i want you to think a little bit\nabout your father\nand find within yourself\nall of the love all of the affection\nall of the caring all of the compassion\nand then at the same time\nfind the anger\nthe hatred the sense of loss of\ninnocence and just like the beating of\nyour heart i want you to feel\nboth of those things together\nthere's\nthat you can have both of those within\nyou and that's actually how it's\nsupposed to be\nthat you can love him and be\ndisappointed\nthat he can be a wonderful father and\ncould have done better\nthat you're lucky to have him in your\nlife\nand you're unlucky\nthat you can be grateful for many things\nin life\nand you can be resentful\nas you as you swim between these two\npoles of feeling\nreturn to the feeling of your heartbeat\nand notice that within your body there\nis never just one thing\nthere's always a balance\nthe two thumps of your heartbeat\nthe inhalation and the exhalation\nthe contractions squeeze your fists\ntogether\nand then relax them\nthat eyes can open and close\nand that our most basic sense of self\ninvolves two things\nand so it's perfectly okay for you to\nfeel both of those things with your dad\nand that there's no need to feel guilty\nfor feeling angry\nthat you deserve to feel both of those\nways and that's okay\none doesn't need to win\nand the more that you focus on your\nheartbeat\nthe deeper this principle will sink into\nyour mind\nall you have to do is focus on the\nheartbeat and you'll learn this on your\nown\nand now for nine beats i want you to\nfeel your heart\nwhen you're done open your eyes\nhow do you feel relaxed\nthat's what we want to do so i think\nrelaxed is an interesting word\nbut i think that um\nyeah practice it if you\nare interested i think the rapid\nbreathing if you're feeling anxious or\noverly energetic\nit can also calm down your mind so that\nbreathing technique since it involves a\nlot of activity\nis going to let you get energy out and\nthen you're\nleft with a calm mind naturally\nright it's like if you're fidgety and\nyou run like a bunch of\nlike if you do a bunch of sprints you're\nnot going to be fidget anymore\nso you need a technique that's going to\nlet you get the excess energy of your\nmind out and leave you\nin a calm space and then find something\nsensory within you to kind of like\nzero in on this principle of like yin\nand yank\nin breath and out breath heartbeat\nand since you're a musician i i decided\nto go with the heart\nbecause it's got a rhythm to it it's got\na you know\nokay any last thoughts or questions\nno okay well thank you very much for\ncoming on oreo\nthank you for having me that was so much\ni learned a lot\ngood i'm glad i'm really happy that\nyou're\non the road
