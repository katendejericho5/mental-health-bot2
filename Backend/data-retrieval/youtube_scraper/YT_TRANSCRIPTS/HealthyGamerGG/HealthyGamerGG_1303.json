    "transcript": "uh\ncall me evan that's my name okay welcome\nevan\nyou can call me alexa okay nice to meet\nyou alexa and evan\nso um i understand that we're gonna be\ntalking about your relationship today\nyes okay and so let me just try to\noutline a little bit\nabout how i usually like to do this so i\nlike to talk to each person individually\nfor like maybe 30 to 45 minutes\nand get y'all's individual perspectives\nbecause especially i understand there's\nsome kind of tension in y'all's\nrelationship\ni imagine that's why we're coming on\nokay um\nand so we wanna hear from each of you\nindividually\nuh and that also gives you guys kind of\na chance to\nyou know speak freely without the other\nperson there i mean i understand this is\nbeing\nrecorded for the internet um so a couple\nof ground rules no watching\nokay so you can't watch the stream while\nyou're not in the room\nokay um and maybe even no watching\nafterward\nand and then after talking to each of\nyou we'll kind of get you all in\ntogether\nand see if we can sort of facilitate\nsome kind of communication or hell\ndoes that sound okay so who wants to go\nfirst\nyou can go first babe i'll go first okay\nall right\nso alexa do you mind stepping out of the\nroom yeah no problem no\nno watching\nevan it looks like we have the same\nchair man chairperson ah\nikea yeah oh yours has some does mine do\nthat\nit was up and down oh wow you have a\nbetter one\nit's fancier\num so evan tell me a little bit about\nwhy uh you know why you guys decided to\ncome on stream which thank you by the\nway\nyeah thanks for having us um i\nwell we recently moved\ncities together uh okay it's been a\nrelationship for like five\nyears um coming up about five years\num we're 22 kind of young\nand i would i wouldn't say there's a\nlike urgent issue that arises it's\nthere's much more of a sort of\npassive uh background feelings i think\nthat we have\nuh okay about it and like insecurities\nand\nkind of yeah the the question we posed\nof\nwhen to break up which is not something\neither of us actively want\nlike we very much feel in love and on\nour day to day is like usually very good\nand uh\nproductive and uh okay cohesive work we\nwork well together we communicate well\num\nbut there are things that\narise over time where they're just sort\nof like\nno-go zones i guess um\nand that's what i'm gonna put has put\nlike yeah\nfrustration in me over time because uh\nand personally i am much more like\nfocused in on the thing once once i know\nthe\nno go zone i get fixated with it over\ntime and i\nokay respect it to a degree but once it\ncomes up i\nuh it's hard for me to have any other\nperspective on it than the one that we\nleft off on\nif that sure makes sense yeah so let me\njust make sure i understand you\nso it sounds like there's some you know\nthe day-to-day interaction\nin your relationship is good um it\nsounds like you guys love each other\nand there's some taboo topics yeah and\nand so you guys sort of it sounds like\nyou all don't\ntalk about them because that usually\nleads to conflict so you guys have\nrealized\nfor the sake of harmony we're going to\nsteer clear\nof that area yeah there's there's pve\nzones\nand there's pvp zones yes good i like\nthat\nand and so you're like okay we don't\nwant to play pvp but the problem\nis that those seem to be on some level\nimportant things and now you know that\nthere's like some zone that's like taboo\nthat issue never gets settled so it's\nkind of weighing on you\nyeah okay and\nand it uh increases over time almost and\nespecially given like\nthe recent like moving there's uh\nthere's much more like on the line i\nguess so those\nokay can you tell us can you be a little\nbit more specific so like what's an\nexample of a no-go zone\num i think uh\nlike breaking up or sort of uh\nlike talking about the end of something\nwhere\nthey're uh\nyou know it's kind of what it's very\nlike either\ntogether forever or it happens at some\npoint and\ni feel a certain\nlike uh yeah that that bothers me i\nguess um what bothers you\nuh like the fact that it has to end and\ngo like one\nway or the other um okay and\ni know and i yeah like a lot every day i\ncan be like okay well you take it one\nday at a time you\nyou make today a good day yada yada but\num\nand like this some other like\ndifferent uh i don't want to get too\nspecific but different\nways we care for our mental health she\nmight\ndo something and\ntreat herself one way i might do it\nanother um\nand so we're talking about self-care and\nthe way that you guys\ndiffer like the way that\nyou know those are their differences in\nthe ways that you care for yourselves\nyeah yeah um okay\ni and where\ni'll i just have an opinion on something\nand i uh\nthink she\nshouldn't and i understand this is flat\nbut that's not the way she should be\nuh approaching the problem sort of and\ni get um again like when she shouldn't\nbe doing something\nyeah whenever the topic comes up i\nstay at that stance even though i i'm\ntrying to be supportive and like dynamic\nand see the perspectives and\njust supportive of however she thinks\nshe needs to\ni i find myself being incredibly curious\nabout\nwhat you're saying and at the same time\nalso wanting to respect your privacy\nyeah if you can give me like five\nseconds sure i don't think\nshe'd have a problem with me mentioning\nwhat it is but i just want to make sure\nit's okay with her yep thank you\nthat's solid by the way\nthat's what we want right\nall right we got the green light okay so\nwhat are we talking about\nwell done by the way evan thank you yeah\ni do my best um uh\nantidepressants okay like she\nthis is not a medical stream i know that\num but\nshe will uh you know going through a\nhard time\none of her ways of like she's on them\nand particularly rough period chose to\nlike increase\num after and i guess my perspective on\nit is\nshe's been on them forever for a very\nlong time\nand i've always seen the goal as\nlike decreasing those like not having a\ndependence or um like i think i think\nthings will be good for a very long\nperiod of time but she's still taking\nthem and that seems\nodd to me okay um so\nyeah it badass okay so and and how\nhow do you care for yourself when you're\ngoing through a rough time\num i i mean like any other gamer i'd say\ni\ni withdraw i i hide\ni um yeah i have had\nblessed not much lately but used to\nrecreationally drug use\num and generally kind of like\nsuppressing and uh that kind of stuff\nand\nsure like healthier ways of doing this i\nthink are\nreally just like talking to people i\nfound and having relationships\nhelps me a ton in processing those in a\ngood way instead of just not thinking\nabout them playing league of legends\nyou all noob yes\nokay so it sounds like sometimes you\nguys have um\nkind of arguments about perspectives\naround taking medication and\nuh you know being dependent on\nsubstances\num and so that's kind of one of the\nno-go zones\nit sounds like another no-go zone is\nsort of talking about\nwhere your relationship is going\nyeah um and this ventures into\nsort of uh like yeah\nthe the expectations of relationships\nlike we've always\nwe've always what kind of expectations\nare we talking about\num like when we first started dating we\nwe both used this phrase that we\nbig picture liked each other we we like\nliked each other on the big\nit wasn't like just like oh you're fun\nto hang out with a couple times a week\nwe're like no this is we\nreally like each other and the timing in\nour lives was such that\nwe could uh\nthink on that level um and it's like\nworked really well and she's in school\ni'm not i just\nwork um and we've\nchugged along with this but there is\num yeah i guess i feel like an\nexpectation to live up\nto that me five years ago who was saying\nthat sometimes\nand i'm sorry what were you saying\nexactly\noh that like oh and\nthat we like big picture like each other\nthat we're in this for the long haul\nthat we know\nthat we may not always like each other\nbut we love each other sort of okay\nin it for the long haul and so do you\nfeel\nbound by making that commitment years\nago\num i feel a responsibility i feel i\nguess i feel bound by that\nresponsibility too\nand what is the responsibility um\nto be there for her\nand would breaking up with her mean not\nbeing there for her\nyes okay\nwhat do you think about that\ni mean and i you've got maybe uh\nthey it does do i have what is it\noh no because uh i imagine\ni don't see it going us breaking up in a\nlike\npeaceful we can still be friends kind of\nway even though i think we're mostly\nfriends\nmore than like lovers or anything\num that i do i don't know how what that\nwould look like\nat all to be able to support her but not\nbe dating\nand and so i mean so evan i'm gonna say\nsomething that may be judgmental but i'm\njust gonna toss it out there okay\nyou gotta let me know if it's it makes\nyou feel bad or if it's wrong\nso i'm i'm hearing that a major reason\nyou're in the relationship\nis out of a sense of responsibility as\nopposed to like wanting to be in the\nrelationship itself\num yeah i think that's\nmore my cynical view of time at\ntimes sure well and there is\nuh\nlike i and then there's obviously i\nthink\nor not obviously uh i've learned\nthroughout time going to therapy and\nthings that\nthe value of relationships and that i\nneed relationships and that\nthey do just improve my life even if it\nseems hard in the short run\num so\ni uh yeah and there's\nthere's some other thing there of like\nbeing too comfortable in this and like\nknowing how it's going to go\nand it's it's safe because it is how\nit's always been for the past\nwhile instead of the scary unknown\nand how do you feel about that\num i i do\nfeel like i should\nat times i feel like i should sacrifice\nwhat i have\nlike the comfort that i have um to to\nget something better\ni guess is the idea that i hear a lot um\nbut also at the same time when i think\nof what that actually looks like\nand actually going through that it\ndoesn't feel like something i want\ni i feel like it would be a mistake\nokay\ncan i think for a second please\nthank you\nokay here's what i'm hearing\nso it sounds like your relationship is\ngood for a lot of reasons\num you know it sounds like you guys have\nbeen together for five years and you\nsaid you're\n22 so you guys got together when you\nwere 17. yep\num you know early on y'all were very\nmuch in love and it sounds like y'all\nare still in love\nand you made kind of as 17 year olds do\nbroad commitments we're gonna do it for\nthe rest of our life\num you also recognize and so years have\ngone on you guys have gotten through a\nlot together you've moved in together\nuh you know like any relationship you\nguys have your challenges but i'm\nhearing that there's a lot of good stuff\nthere\ni'm hearing that for your own stability\nthat being in a relationship is\nimportant i'm hearing that the\nrelationship has become\ncomfortable safe dependable\nmaybe there's more i'm getting the sense\nthat something is missing from your\nrelationship\ni'm not sure exactly what that is maybe\nthere is something missing maybe there\nisn't\nwe can get to that in a second but\noverall it seems like the relationship\nis good it sounds like\nalexa is a is uh maybe your best friend\nand and so you know there's a lot of\ngood stuff there\nwhat i'm hearing from you evan is a butt\nbut so like if we think about life\ndo we want to choose the road that's\nsafe\nthere's a there's a path of certainty\nand safety\nand there's a path of uncertainty\nthere's a path there's like a risk like\na high risk and a low risk option\nand what i'm hearing you kind of\nstruggle with is like how do you know\nwhen you should do something that like\nyou kind of know is good for you\nversus how do you grow\nbecause what i'm really hearing from you\nis that like you're not growing in this\nrelationship anymore\nyes i think that's very accurate\nright and and that's tricky because like\nhow much of this relationship\nsure i mean this is what i envision it's\nkind of like\nyou know there's the waters around our\nisland which we know well and which are\nsafe\nbut at what point do you decide to like\npack as much food as you can\ninto your boat and sail into the horizon\nand see what you can find\nis that how you feel yeah yeah um\nand especially with another person\ninvolved the the decision gets like\nmuddied very quickly because how does\nanother person muddy the decision\ni mean it's uh\ni feel that i should take her feelings\ninto account right i feel like\nuh even i need to venture off into\nuncertainty\nand i'm like well there's plenty of\nother ways i can do that that doesn't\nnecessarily mean\nlike ending this relationship you can\ninstall dota for example yeah exactly\nyeah i just started playing\ncounter-strike and that's\ni'm like a new new way to waste my time\ncool um\nbut there's yes sorry i lost a point\nno i mean so you were saying that when\nanother person gets involved it gets\ncomplicated so like how like so\nhow does taking her feelings into\naccount how does that complicate things\num well i'd say because\nthere's there's no like one to one on\nmy feeling versus your feeling like\nin obviously one one individual another\nindividual\nbut the like levels of feeling and the\nattachments and the like need for\nsomeone else at a certain time and it um\nthe like specificity of\nthinking about uh like\nchanging things up gets okay\noverwhelming\nokay so so so what i'm hearing is that\nthe details of\nhow you go off sailing into the sunset\nbecome really complicated when you have\nto think about someone else\nyeah yeah and especially the i think the\nfeelings\nhave arose at this time which feelings\nuh those the feelings of\nuncertainty and um\nlike almost like lost possibilities\nlike that i'm like yeah committed on\na path now of some certainty having\nlike moved in together in a new city\nhow does it feel to have lost those\npossibilities\num it's\nit like it it hurts it hurts my\nego or something inside of me where it i\ni want to like do a lot whatever that\nmeans\num and\nlike i have yeah friends who have done\nthings for the same period of time that\ni've like been in this relationship and\ni\nalmost do one-to-one compare those\nthings where i'm like well they have\nthis degree or this project or this like\norganization going and i\nhave a relationship cool\nyeah i'm a little bit um help me\nunderstand\nwhat how\nthe relationship interferes with let's\nsay\nhaving a degree or a project\nuh\nright i think yeah yeah i think and\nmaybe i'm\ngetting too abstract but i think it is\nlike an identity thing\nof feeling some tie\nto be a similar person to who i was when\nthis started what does that mean\num like i remember the time we met\nit was last year of high school\nand i was like nope not going to college\ni'm going to\ni'm gonna work i worked at a restaurant\nand i'm independent it's very\nlike i'm gonna read books and\nphilosophize on my own and like\nbe this uh individual and\ni like that voice you did when\num and yeah i guess\ni just i guess i'm not\nyet sure why i feel like there's less\nor less yeah opportunities available to\nme but i do feel like there's less\nopportunities available to me because\ni'm in this okay okay\nokay\nso you sound to me like you're feeling\nlike you're stagnating or shackled in\nsome way\ni wouldn't use those words but yes the\nfeeling is yes\nyeah so what words would you use\num i mean i would say\nuh stuck or um\nkind of dormant oh dormant is a good one\nooh i like that one i'm gonna have to\nstart using that one more\nso much more positive than stuck yes i'm\ni think i'm i'm very good because you're\nreading\nphilosophy books on your own\num okay and and so can you help me\nunderstand like\nwhat happens when you go into a no-go\nzone\nwhen you switch from co-op to versus\nyeah\nit is like it's almost as if the lights\nchange\nand the like spotlight comes down on us\nand\num the i mean what it literally is is\nvery much like\nattention arises and\nwe both are sort of\nusually not saying anything because we\nboth know\nthe space that we're going to be\nentering we both know like\nthe scripts that we usually go down\nwhich is like okay\nwhy like yeah why did you increase that\nor like well\nyou're gonna have to go down like so\nyou're gonna be on it forever you know\nlike this\nthose kind of things um and\nvery much waiting for someone to make a\nmove\nand sort of and then maybe like guys\ncircling each other yeah you like maybe\nlike provoke them and you're like hello\nlike\nhello you know you try to get them to\ncome out a bit\num make them to make the first move so\nyou can counter attack\nexactly yeah no we always we're and\nwe're both like so\nargumentative people so it's a lot of\nposturing\nbut not it doesn't um\nwe we have like engaged and\nhad like large fights and crying and\neverything\nwhat isn't how does how do you guys have\na large fight what does that look like\num\ni mean it is mostly talking i don't\nraise our voices not too much we're not\nbig yellers and\nviolent people but like what gets set\nlike what is an actual argument like if\ni were to watch\nthis for five minutes what would it look\nlike\num it would look like me sitting\nlike a armchair philosopher philosophers\nkind of like trying to\nas if i do have the divine knowledge of\nwhat is what should and shouldn't be\ndone um\nher much more like fidgeting or she is\nmuch more likely to like get up and\nleave like either to a different room or\nthe house or\num take the dog for a walk or something\nand\num i think she\nis much more like expressive and i\ni call her out for calling me names\noften even though\nthe names probably are fitting at times\num\nwhat does she say oh just like [ __ ]\njerk\nuh okay douche you know um\nthing and because it yeah and it is like\ni'm\ntrying to maintain and what what are you\ndoing that mate that\nmakes [ __ ] warranted um\n[Music]\nacting as if i know the answer i'd say\nbut you feel like you know the answer in\nthose moments\nyes yes which is why it's\nfrustrating you know it's interesting\nbecause what i'm what i'm\nenvisioning is almost like a courtroom\nwhere you're the judge\nthat's what it feels like to me yeah no\nlike\nlike she's sitting down there and you're\nsitting up there in your arm chair\nand relatively theatrical saying yes\nmaking the final judgment yep and i\nand i that's also kind of thing is i\nlike retrospectively or reflectively uh\ndon't like\nthat version of myself that like is\ntrying to be more powerful\nthan her in some way that's trying to\nlike\nmaintain control and like embarrass her\nor something yeah where does that\nversion of yourself come from\num\ni\ni'd say i'm uh i'm a youngest\nof i have three older sisters which uh\nhelps i helps in just like communicating\nwith her but\num i have always been like a very\nreserved they all talk and discuss and\ni'm much more\nlike sit there and then add a joke at\nthe end or add a comment kind of thing\num sort of observational\nnature i'd say okay let me actually ask\nyou kind of\none or two other questions if that's\nokay i'm going to switch gears for a\nsecond\ncan you tell me what uh the no-go zone\nof talking about y'all's relationship\nlooks like\nhow does that conversation go\nlike breaking up yep um\nit's\nuh very that's much more like\nsad it's much more like\ncrying in bed like holding each other\nkind of like\na supportive like less of an argument\nand more of a\nlike um joint feeling\nhow do you guys get there that's what\ni'm like okay\nyou know like how was work today it was\ngood do you want to get into bed and cry\nwhile we hold each other\nthat's only on the weekends um\nuh you got a very funny one very funny\nthank you thank you um\nthere's usually some yeah you obviously\nhave some sort of\ntrigger from yes um and usually i think\nit's pretty variable it's not we're not\nusually\nbased on any tell me the last time that\nyou guys wound up in bed\ncrying together and how that\nconversation started um\n[Music]\ni think i i brought up the\nlike what initiated it all was like i\nmy feeling was that we're\ntoo much friends that like\ni feel like we're roommates almost okay\nand so what that was the feeling what\nhappened\nuh i i mean i brought that i think she\nher\ninitial response was kind of so you said\nto her\ni feel like we're roommates yeah\nokay she said back like um\nwhat do you mean like is this like a\ndo you mean like is it not enough\nlike together time doing things uh like\nkind of inquiring more and i said i i\ni reply that it's just much more of a\nfeeling of\nthe whole relationship you know i kind\nof drop a\nyeah it's kind of a more of\ntry yeah i guess just expressing my\nfeeling instead of um\nright doing anything and then she'll say\nlike so\nwhat do you mean by that like so what\ncan i do\nshe you know she kind of looks trying to\ndo and i said there's like and then\nmaybe i'll like throw some things out\nthere but\num she'll\ntalk or she'll start going on uh\nlike bringing things up from the past of\nlike\ninstances where we were\nlike good or bad in like\nor we were good friends or we were like\nnot\ngood friends or um\nand so i think stressed\nrefute your point yeah\nyeah like sort of give me her\nthe things that come to her mind of like\nwhy that's clearly not the case\nand why from like her perspective\nobviously not friends because\nfriends wouldn't do this or that um i\njust thought there's\na higher tier of relationship to it um\nand i think it's like there\nthat like my feeling\nversus her facts um\nsort of just like saddens us because i'm\ni'm like well i have this like this is\nall i have to offer\nto you um and she's like well i was\nliving in this world and now you're\ntelling me that you were living in this\nworld\num and that like we both want\nwe both want like and then kind of like\nthe presupposition of wanting to be\ntogether is never in question it's\nalways\njust like then it just gets very sad\nbecause\nwe feel like that's yeah\ncrumbling in some way what's crumb\num our love or like our\nuh understanding of each other our\nability to relate\nokay and help me understand\na little bit about what your perspective\nis on antidepressants\nand it's um\ni mean you don't have to i would\nencourage you to not worry about\njudgment uh although i imagine that can\nbe hard\nbut generally speaking i just genuinely\nbecause i think understanding how you\nfeel about things\num kind of is very important without\njudgment yeah um\nso i guess i'll start with my experience\nof antidepressants um\nwhich was very much i mean it was i was\na depressed gamer doing depressed gamer\nthings\num right off and the i feel like my the\nantidepressants at the time\nalmost blurred everything more where it\nwas\njust like a more monotone existence of\nwhat i was\nalready doing um very like yeah the\ndulling effect\ni think i was taking i took two or three\ndifferent of the most common\nvarieties um and\nthen like yeah went through a few mental\nhealth institutions they were\nthrowing the kitchen sink at me and\neverything and i think\ni came out the other end still having a\nfeeling but also having like a\nconfidence\nwhat i gained from all of that was not\nlike a prescription\nor um a diagnosis or anything but it was\nlike a confidence\nin myself to like okay well none of\nthese\nidiots could do it none of these drugs\nactually did anything\num but like i am the one who can\nchoose to do stuff and like make a life\ni want or whatever um\nand yeah i guess\ni just see them very much as a crutch\nand as a way of\nlifting the bottom\nup to a place where they can start to be\nhelped\nlike because there is there is a bottom\nthat\ni've been at and i i've seen people at\nwhere like yeah you just need more\nuh serotonin and you need more dopamine\nor whatever\nand when\nwe like are on trips and like there's\nmonths and months and months where\neverything is like fantastic it's\nlike it i like i think i like to think\nthat i'm very\nmindful of like what i eat and what i\nput in my body and\nthe idea of like taking something that\nmakes you feel better while like\neverything is good around you\nseems uh drone-ish to me\nseems very like just doing what you\nare supposed to okay or what what the\ndoctor ordered\nwhich is not i guess in authority i\nnecessarily\nokay\nokay so i'm detecting\nyou know something of your independence\nstreak coming up here too\nright this idea that i'm going to study\nphilosophy on my own to be independent\nand [ __ ] the doctors the establishment\nand i don't want to be a drone\nyes exactly very much cool\nso what goes through your mind when you\nsee\nalexa upping her dose and does she up it\nherself or her\ndoctor tells her to increase\ni mean the most recent one and\nwhy this is relevant was her\nreaching out for it um which\nyeah aggravated me more than if it was\njust a doctor telling her because i\nunderstand just\nwhat aggravates you about her reaching\nout to her doctor\num well i thought the like\nthere was clear indicators during the\ntime period where she was feeling worse\nlike she was just spending a lot of time\nwith her family who really stresses her\nout and trains her and asks a lot of her\num and\nnot like we moved but she had to leave\ntown to go help them\nfor a while and not having a home and\nthere's so many\nmore circumstantial things to me that\nthat seems like just a random\nlike it it'd be like\nuh it's like\ntaking uh or\nit's just not it doesn't seem like a\nrelevant um level\nto be adjusting it doesn't seem like a\nskill you need to be\nboosting right now it's to me it's just\nkind of a\nuh you're only like increasing the like\ndependence\nokay when you could very much just like\ntake some time reorient yourself and\num start from there because\ni get and i guess this always like i\nhave some idea that\nthe goal is to be off of them and okay i\nsee that as a\nlike a step in the wrong direction yeah\nyeah\nevan do you feel like alexa understands\nyou\num i think she understands me the best\nof anyone\ni i think i won't i'll give you the\nshort\nversion of like i\ngrew up not feeling very understood by\nmy mom\nuh my parents were divorced and we did\nlike a week at one house week at the\nother house and\ni felt like my dad understood me very\nwell but my mom totally didn't\num and there's this eternal like\nhiding from people presenting a certain\nfacade\num to like everyone most of the time\nand in order to uh\nprotect myself i guess or something okay\nand\ni i think she understands\na lot of me but almost that that almost\num\nwhen she says things that imply that she\nunderstands what i'm going through\nthat almost angers me because i\ni'm like no you don't actually get it\nlike this is actually an everything i'm\ngonna ask you again\ndoes she understand you\nuh not entirely okay\nokay\nso\nis this relationship safe for you\ni feel safe in it is this relationship\ngood for you\nthat's the question that's that's\nyeah what i've felt both sides\nof that okay\ndo you want to be in this relationship\num i feel like i want to i guess\ni think that ties into um\nwhether it's good for me\ni feel like i want things that are good\nfor me um\nso i want to be in it but i also don't\nwant to be doing things that are bad for\nme\nokay are you afraid that\nif you are in this relationship\nyou won't live the life that you're\nsupposed to live\nyes okay so i think that's the crux of\nit\nis what i'm getting from you is that\nfair to say\nyeah okay any questions for me\nwhy is it what's what's up with the\nchairs today behind you\nyou've chaired behind you yeah um i\nthink that\nyou know i'm we're still sort of moving\nin so i also have a couple of boxes that\nneed to be cleared out\nokay and so yeah i mean it's just\nmore furniture in my office\nnothing no no no no other questions\nregarding my results yeah\num yeah so i i think i've kind of heard\nuh i think you've done an awesome job of\nkind of representing what you're going\nthrough\num and you know i\ni think i i feel like i'm ready to kind\nof get some of alexis perspective\nand i also want to make sure that we\nhave enough time to talk to the two of\nyou together\nso if there's something that is there\nanything that you feel like we didn't\ncover\nor left out or sort of didn't get to\nthat you want to share\num\ni don't want to spend much time on it\nbut uh\nthe i guess i'd say\nlike being a gamer dating a non-gamer um\nis a interesting thing and um\nthat like i\ni was generic twitch chat user\num and at a certain point\num like nothing changed i just i just\nfell into this relationship\nand i still feel that way and i guess\nmore so i'm just saying like to\neverybody that\nit uh it yeah being in a relationship\nisn't like isn't\nfixing anything it isn't going to fix\nyou\ninherently like the the eunice is still\nthere for sure\nokay okay cool can you\ncall alexa in yes\nthank you very much thank you\nso any takers on the idea that the\nreason that he's not moving forward in\nlife is gonna be because he plays two\nvideo too many video games from alexa's\nperspective\nbecause he didn't really talk about the\nvideo games i'm curious whether we're\ngoing to see video games\nhey i guess you can't can't hear me\nhey alexa hello did i get a good review\nuh yeah i don't think uh oddly enough we\ndidn't really talk much about\noh imagine that um\nbut uh okay so can you tell me a little\nbit about\nyour understanding of why we're talking\ntoday uh\nyeah so um\nokay well i think this like starts with\nthe fact that like evan and i live very\ndifferent lives\nbut we're together because we have\nsimilar values and morals and\nwe obviously like care about each other\nand we love each other very much\num but i think there is this like\nlooming idea that um\nsince because we live or because we live\nsuch different lives\num perhaps we aren't compatible for a\nlong term\num i know like when we started dating\npeople always made like comments about\nhow different we were and like both of\nour families did\num yeah and i guess\nlike me a data point of why i think this\nis a problem\nis um so like we love each other but we\nwill have like moments of like very\nintense and\ncity towards one another which i think\nis like common\nin relationships but um\nyeah we can't ever really like talk\nthrough these things\nso like if like i guess this happens a\nlot like\ni'll be talking too loudly in a\nrestaurant and like it is probably too\nloudly\nand i'm like hey be quiet and i'll just\nbe like why are you telling me what to\ndo like leave me alone\nand then we just like don't talk like\nfor like the remainder of dinner or\nwhatever so it's weird\nbecause we communicate so well together\nmost of the time but we just can't get\nover these incidences\nthat i think are tied to our long-term\nlooming questions of compatibility\nokay can you give us that was a great\nexample can you give us another example\nof how\nanimosity develops between you two um\nyeah okay like so many to choose from\n[Laughter]\num okay let's\nokay this is a good one um so like\ni feel like definitely previous before\nquarantine\ni like come and go a lot and\ni like like to be busy probably\nto a fault i always like to be doing\nsomething be out of the house like\nrarely find me just chilling um and i'd\nbe like bopping in and out of the house\nand evan would be like playing games\nand i just kind of like wait in the\nkitchen to say hi or like pop my head in\num and like stand in the kitchen or\nsomething kind of like\nwaiting i don't know and i think he\nfeels just\nlike i think he internalizes that like\nmaybe he's playing video games too long\nbut i think i genuinely don't care uh\nbecause i realize i just fill my time by\nprobably some negative way being too\nbusy and he fills his time\nplaying video games i think in a similar\nway but\nthen he'll come out and be like there's\njust like this weird mood\nthat like we aren't really like we're\ntalking around each other instead of\ntalking at each other um then it's like\ni think sometimes evan is like quick to\num\nreact quicker than i am and then\ni'm like well i'll meet you there i just\nwon't talk to you like\nand this very adaptive behavior what do\nyou mean made him where\nlike at his like crappy mood he's like\nquick to react nature and when you say\nyou're talking you're kind of circling\naround something what are you all\ncircling around\neach other which is probably the problem\num\nlike okay peanut yeah so so this is\nreally helpful and i'm missing i'm\nlosing you somewhere or i'm i'm losing\ntrack\nso i kind of get that okay so it sounds\nlike you kind of pop home like you're\ndoing something you kind of come home\nhe's gaming so you're like\ni don't know why i would sit around so\nthen you leave again\nyou do something for a little while you\ncome back yeah and then\nwhat is how do you guys start to circle\nor\ninteract because it sounds like\nsomewhere in there a foul mood is\nbrewing\nyeah yeah and i think that's the problem\nis like we don't know where it starts\nand um so like i would be standing in\nthe kitchen\nlike making lunch or something and he\nwould come out and be like\nhey babe how are you doing i'm like good\nhow are you\nlike good and then\nboth just like look at each other and\nthen\nit's almost like i feel unwelcome\nso like i give him like the cola\nshoulder\nor like negative body language\num or will like what\nwhat kind of thoughts do you have about\nhim\nuh like in those moments yeah\num i think i react so negatively\nto that because i feel like perhaps i'm\nbeing judged for\nthe busy nature in which i live my life\nand um let's see\nuh probably also that\ni would like to come home and be like\na warmly embraced\nyeah and i know like\nlogically like he's in the middle of a\ngame he can't come up\nand i know i'm his priority in his life\nbut like in those moments i can't be the\npriority\nso these are things i logically know but\nsomewhere along the line\nokay judge for the busy nature\nof your life do you feel judged for the\nbusy nature of your life\ni think um\ni before i started dating evan i thought\nof this as like a positive\ncharacteristic that i would never stop\num but i am becoming more and more aware\nof how i\nuse my\nlike enjoyment of being busy as a way to\nnot deal with my issues\nso um when i\nam around evan who lives a very like\nquiet life i think\nhe doesn't like i find joy like going\nout of the house and doing things and he\njust doesn't\nso i think it's like my lifestyle is\njuxtaposed to his very staunchly in\nthose moments\nso what do you use your busy lifestyle\nas a coping mechanism for\num\nwell i think um i think that if i'm busy\ni have like no time to not be okay\nor to like not be um\nlike if i'm busy i can't process my\nemotions i can just like\nfile them and then\nlike obviously this is a problem when\ni'm not busy\nthen like everything's comes like\ncrashing to the ground\nand what kind of stuff comes crashing to\nthe ground when you're not busy\num well um\nor is that the kitchen scenario you\ndescribed\nno that's not the kitchen scenario um\nlet's see um\nwhat kind of stuff are you looking for\nlike behavior\nare you like so when you're not busy\nwhat happens so you're saying that you\nuse busy as a coping mechanism\nmaybe it sounds like he uses gaming as a\ncoping mechanism\nyeah i'm not busy i'm like sad\num what are you sad about\neverything that i haven't uh processed\nemotionally\num so like relationships with my family\num i think\ni like judge myself a lot for uh i think\nwe all do\nbut um let's see\num i judge myself for not like mediating\nthose relationships better\nwith your family yeah okay\nyeah um\nyeah do you have thoughts about evan\nwhen you're standing still\nand you also this is interesting um\ni feel like evan is like really in my\ncorner\non life right now and understands like\nhe listens to me\na lot he's a very good listener um\nand i don't always feel like members of\nmy family are able\nto uh listen to me in that way so\num yeah i think\nevan's like the best cheerleader i have\nin my life um\nsounds like he supports you very well\nyeah i'm very lucky\num yeah so uh in a selfish way most of\nthe time i'm not thinking about evan\num but when i do i know i\nlike catastrophize things so\nlike evan is like quick to anger\nabout i guess normally like little\nthings like\num it was like heating up water on the\nstove the other day he's like i just\nhate the sound the stove makes\nlike just like kind of crackles i was\nlike oh\nwell like i can stop it and he's like no\ndon't do that and i just like stop it\nthinking like i'll solve this problem\nby like eliminating the fact that this\nthe stove is even crackling and then\nhe's like why did you do that like it\ngets angry\num and then in those moments when i shut\ndown\ni like begin to think like that's when\nlike the negative thoughts about our\nrelationship\ncome to boyle i guess come to surface\nis like um\ni think the easy things for me to think\nare like\nhe's failing to see the way i see the\nworld he's not asking questions about\nthe way i see the world\num and like\nuh yeah and then i lose the fact\nthat he is the biggest\nadvocate of me and my success in my life\nand i think\nthe stove boiling is a big\nmetaphor for the destruction of our\nrelationship\nhow what's the metaphor like\nthat him like this just demonstrates his\ninability to see the world i see the way\ni see the world\nah so this goes back to the\ncompatibility in living different lives\nyeah i think so um and like\ni know saying that now this isn't true\nbut in the moment\nit feels like so\nintense and so founded in truth\nokay\ni'm gonna think for just a second okay\nokay\nso let me ask you a question um alexa\nwhen you were growing up did you find\nthat\nwhen you felt bad\nthat you could change something about\nyour behavior that would make people\nless angry with you\num i think i was a mediator in our\nfamily um\ni had two older sisters my parents had a\nvery very turbulent marriage if you\nwould even call it that\nuh until they got divorced when i was in\nuh high school\num so i always\nlike yeah so you always what\nuh i always felt some responsibility to\nlike peace keep the household\nlike getting in between altercations i\nwasn't involved in\nor like i just\nlike wanted my family to be happy and\ndidn't understand why they couldn't be\nokay and when when evan is like just\nyou know hanging around and he says the\nsound of the water boiling is so\nannoying\ndo you know what your first feeling in\nresponse to that is\nuh like fear that um\nmy actions are gonna make us have a bad\nday\nlike my actions of like\nchoosing to boil water which like as i\nsay it i know is ridiculous\nsure but yeah if i'm being honest that\nwould be it\ndo you ever get the feeling that he has\none foot out the door\nno okay like\nyeah uh he didn't have to move with me\nuh and that's why i feel some guilt\nlike he absolutely did not have like i\nwas even like contemplating\nuh beginning my grad program here if uh\nevan wasn't up to the move\nbut yeah he sacrificed a lot to be with\nme okay\nso he sacrifices a lot to be with you\nyeah what do you think he gives up\num living close to his friends\num\nuh like time like\nhe definitely could gain more if i\nwasn't around\num how much does he gain\nuh i think it depends um like for a\nwhile he had like\na break in work and he was like i think\nhe was playing\ni don't even know what he was playing\nbut something a lot of hours a day\num and like how many hours per week\ni'm not really like keeping a time\non it maybe like a part time\ni don't know maybe like we've been\nmoving i don't know\nso like when he games i think it's\nprobably like a part-time job\nokay so\ni i'm a little bit so i'm just trying to\nget a sense of like what his day looks\nlike\nso okay yeah i can tell you what his day\nlooks like so\nhe would like wake up make breakfast and\nthen\nwe would like go for a walk together or\nhe would like\nand then we'd come home and there'd be\nsome down time and he would game\nand then i would try to find something\nto fill the rest of my day\nlike i'd go to the gym or like walk my\ndog again\nor like yeah um\nand so so i am are we talking like\nfive hours a day on average more or less\nprobably less than that okay yeah\num feels like more to me because i mean\nwhat i'm hearing is like\nyou do something in the morning and then\nyou find something to fill the rest of\nyour day\nwhich then sort of implies to me that\nhe's gaming for the rest of the day\ni don't know that that's a fair\nassumption like we always eat dinner\ntogether\nokay um and evan like it's a very good\ncook\ni'm very spoiled uh so he makes dinner\nfor sure\nyeah uh well he's really into like uh\nlike korean street cooking now\nso i'm eating all of these yeah i mean\nyeah he has like bought tools off amazon\nand stuff now\nso now i know it's like official uh\nyeah okay very spoiled yeah he makes\nyeah\nuh so i eat some like very impressive\ndish for dinner\nand then we'll like spend the rest of\nthe evening like watching netflix\ntogether or like going for another walk\nor something\nokay and then he used to he's like\ntrying to regulate his sleep schedule\nright now\num but like after i like to go to bed\nreally early\num but he would like often stay up\nreally late\nand play games and\ni think that bothered him that we lit\nhad such different like\nschedules but now seems to bother you\nwhat does that bother you ah\num like yes and no um so i used to work\nmorning shifts that would start at six\na.m so i would like\nbe up by five and like sometimes he\nwould still be up and he would like make\nme breakfast\nso that was pretty dope um\nbut i mean like when he sleep\nif he would sleep in the middle of the\nday it would be uh\nsometimes difficult like sometimes i\nwould find myself saying like\num like why can't you be awake when the\nrest of the world is\num and that's just a difference i think\ni fundamentally can't understand\num okay because i don't like to function\nat night i don't know\nyeah so alexa you know i'm just going to\npoint something out so like it seems\nstrange to me that you're saying he\nplays and maybe this is just\ni just want to clarify but like i'm\nenvisioning\nyou know if you go to bed maybe around\n10 and you wake up at five\nand he's still awake at five like that's\nseven hours right there\nright yeah yeah i suppose you're right\nand i think some days\nuh that is true and i think it's hard\nfor me\nto pin down these hours uh because it\nlike sometimes he'll really be into a\ngame and be playing a lot with his\nfriends and like\nsometimes he won't like we've been\nmoving so there's been no time to play\nvideo games\nfor the past like couple weeks or a\nmonth probably\nyeah what i'm hearing from you is that\nyou don't think his gaming is really a\nproblem\num i think that's accurate and i also\nwould probably\npreface that with like i know his mom\nhas made such a big deal about his\ngaming in his life but like i don't want\nto be his mother\num and it's not my job to tell an adult\nhow they should spend their time\nso do you think he should be spending\nhis time differently\nit's one thing to not tell him but do\nyou think he should be spending his time\ndifferently\ni think he utilizes his time in the best\nway he thinks he can and if he can't\nhe'll ask me for help\nand yes like hey babe can you wake me up\nwhen you get up in the morning and i'm\nlike happy to step in and help then\nokay so i ask you the question do you\nthink\nthat there's a problem and you said i\nthink he\nthinks that there isn't a problem and\nwhen he thinks there's a problem he asks\nfor my help\noh man normally i can pull off these\ntactics dr k\nright so what do you think um\ni think perhaps he would be happier if\nhe had a more\nbalanced life where he could enjoy\nplaying video games in a smaller amount\nof time every day\nand not feel as guilty about it so i'm\ni'm detecting you've said this a couple\nof times\nso you're picking up that he feels\nguilty for the amount that he gains\nyes\nnow see that's interesting because that\nputs you in a weird situation\nuh yeah it's definitely difficult to\nnavigate\nbut i think i will like i think i'm more\nreadily able to navigate this space\nbecause of like my uh role in my family\nmodel\ngrowing up yep so which is conflict\navoidance\nmediation right so here's here's what i\nthink is tricky about your situation\nalexa\non the one hand so it sounds like you\nunderstand him pretty well\nyou care about him and you support him\nand so it's i'm hearing from you\nbasically because you're not saying\nyou're stepping around this but i i\nsuspect that you think that\nhis gaming is negatively impacting him\nin some way\nand even if we take that off the table\nat least we can acknowledge that he\nsometimes thinks that\nnow that puts you in a weird situation\nbecause if you want to support\nhim and his goals and help him feel less\nguilty\nthen you're kind of stuck because if you\nstart pushing him in that direction then\nyou become his mom\nyeah yeah so that's my job to parent an\nadult yeah\nyeah so that sounds tricky because even\nif you want to help him it maybe turns\ninto\nlooking like his mom very very quickly\nso i'm not quite sure what you would do\nin that situation like i don't know how\nto navigate that right\num yeah that's correct\ni think probably if i was more\nstraightforward uh\nwe probably would be having a different\nconversation today\num so here's the other thing\nuh alexa that i'm just gonna toss out\nthere i don't know if this is\nlegit or not but i've gotten the sense\nthat\nyou speak very very protectively and\npositively of him\nand and so that's cool like i think\neverything you say is genuine\nand at the same time sometimes when\npeople do that\nit's like they're almost compensating\nfor something else that they're not\nsaying\nright so like like do you feel like\nthere are things\nways that you feel about him that maybe\nbecause we're on the internet\nyou don't feel comfortable sharing which\nis\ntotally legit it's just like you know\nhere's the picture that i'm getting\nright he's\nhe's a guy who has moved across whatever\nfor you\num you know cooks you korean street food\nis thoughtful and caring\nand sounds like in some ways the perfect\nboyfriend sometimes he plays a little\nbit too much sometimes you show up at\nhome\nand you're kind of like twiddling your\nthumbs for a little bit and he's like\nkind of not responsive and you recognize\nthat\nyou know he can't pause the game to come\nand say hi to you\nor you know he can't stop playing and\nthen you kind of like you're kind of\nliving your life and he's sort of living\nhis life\nand it sounds like every now and then\nyou guys like meet at a train station\nand hang out for a little bit and then\nyou guys board your separate trains and\nthen you\nyou know and that's the picture that\nyou're painting to me\nwhich seems very positive but i'm i'm\ngetting like there's like something\nunderneath the surface here that you\nguys aren't able to talk about\nand i'm not even sure if you're really i\ncan't tell if you're not aware\nor if i'm reading too much into it or\nyou're not saying something does that\nmake sense because like so far it sounds\nlike an\nawesome relationship which in a lot of\nways it clearly is\nyeah i think um maybe the thing you're\nmissing\nis um\nyeah most of the time we function well\ntogether\nand we live and inhabit our space as\nwell um\nbut when we clash it's like\na huge problem and um\nlike we probably\nuh avoid talking about\num long-term compatibility because we're\nscared of the idea that like we could\nnot\nlike it's possible we're not compatible\nin the long term and then when these\nclashes happen\nthere's like fallout for days and\nwhat is fun look like uh like not\nsleeping in the same bed\num sometimes i'll like go to my mom's\nhouse\num what are the conversations\nsorry go ahead no yeah what's the\nconversation\nwhat are the conversations about not\nbeing compatible look like\num well like the most recent thing i\nrecollect is um\ni don't even know how we\ni said something like\nmy memory is hazy so i'll do my best to\nrecreate this but i said something like\num i don't know it just annoys me when\nyou treat me like that\nand then whatever and then he's like\nwell do you really want me to come up\nwith something about why i think i do\nthat and i'm like yeah i do\nand he said well i just think you're an\nannoying person\nuh and like for someone who tries so\nhard to foster their\nimage to the world i think i try much\nharder than evan probably does\nlike was like\nuh wrecked my\npresumptions about our relationship um\nand it's like really that shouldn't\nmatter i think like that comment\nwhat shouldn't matter that he thinks i'm\nannoying\nwhy isn't that i'm confused like\ni think i would try to justify and say\nlike if anybody else said this i\nwouldn't care\nbut uh yeah it matters\nbecause um yeah evan's kind of my person\nalex i get the sense that you\nyeah you're very protective pam\nit's strange i think sometimes you place\nhis opinion above your own\nbut that does sound incredibly hurtful\nbecause it sounds like he's making a\njudgment about you as a person\nyeah i've heard that feedback um from\nsome friends as well\nwhat feedback um that they think\nuh i like lower my\nview on the totem pole in our\nrelationship\nyeah yeah um\nnow help me understand how we get to the\nhim saying\nyou're an annoying person\num\nokay i actually have no idea what\nactually happened before that yeah\num if i can feel like a general gist of\nlike something that would happen\num would be like uh\nso like something happens evan is like\nquick to anger\nand kind of like snaps um\nand then i either like shut down or\ni'm like let's let's brawl bro like\nlet's do this\num and\nso yeah then i probably was like well\nwhy are you even treating me like this\nlike\nyou're treating me like trash like this\nis not nice i don't like being treated\nlike that\nand then like you know\nthen it all comes tumbling out and then\nhe probably legitimate i don't know if\nhe knows their nose\ni know it's something he works on that\nis\nlike quickness to anger um but\num yeah and then\nhe'll like produce something in response\nthat he probably really thinks and i'm\nnot ready to hear it\nokay um i just want to point out so like\nyou know you did\nyou do this thing where you'll point out\na flaw he has\nlike he's quick to anger and then you\nfollow it up with i know it's something\nhe's working on\nso i think that's what what people are\nprotected presenting is like\nor detecting like that's what i detect\nis like a sense of protection\nbecause whenever you kind of point out\nyou also it's like you're it's\nyou kind of mentioned that you're\nconcerned about image and i wonder if\nyou're protecting his image too\nby sort of pointing out you know it's\nweird like i just i think it's reflexive\nin your mind that anytime you kind of\nhave a negative like you have to balance\nit with a positive\nyeah uh yeah called out um and\ni appreciate you telling me this um\nyeah i think i do this\nobviously it's a coping mechanism sure\num\nand i think in the home i grew up in\nyeah that was like the only thing i\ncould do to like\nconvince myself i was okay yeah\nso she's like yeah here's the concern\nthat i have around that\nso i think that you guys have a lot of\nstuff under the surface\nand as long as your mind\nwhen your mind sees a negative and it\nputs up a positive\nit removes the need to actually have any\ndiscussion because on balance\neverything's okay\nand then things kind of get propagated\nand then i think you wind up kind of\nwhere you are and i'm not saying that\nyou guys are in the situation because of\nyou alone\nit's a group you know you guys are at\nthis team game\nand and and so i'm just i'm noticing\nthat there's like a certain amount of\nmaybe this is what your friends sort of\nsay about putting yourself lower on the\ntotem pole\ni don't know if it's like sure you can\ncall it a self-esteem thing but i think\njust it\nin a way you've learned how to see pause\nlike to see the silver lining of a cloud\nbecause otherwise life would be bleak\nyeah damn that hits home yeah\nand and i think the challenge here is\nthat like sometimes life\nis weak right\nand and we have to acknowledge or it's\nit's my\nit's my experience that really the way\nthat we fix\nproblems is like you know if my sink\npipe is busted\nand there's water going everywhere and\ni'm sitting there and i'm like well at\nleast i don't have to mop\nbecause like the water's cleaning the\nfloor you know like that's\nit's adaptive absolutely i don't blame\nyou for doing it because i think it's\nit's like really a survival mechanism\nand at the same time sometimes it can\nallow\nproblems to propagate\nand what i'm hearing from you is that\nproblems have propagated i still don't\nknow what\nbut it seems like you guys are kind of\ngetting to this place where you're\nthinking about\nlong-term compatibility which i don't\neven know what that means\nlike what does that mean like why would\nyou guys not be long-term compatible\nwhat what are the ways in which you guys\nare different\nthat means that you guys may not be\ntogether\num how are you feeling by the way am i\nbeing rough on you\nyeah i'm not feeling good but that's\nokay so let's think about that\nhold on in what ways are you not because\ni'm sorry to make you feel that way but\nlet's explore that are you okay with\nthat or you want to\nwhat are you feeling\nokay um\ni'm feeling like bad about the problems\ni've created\nokay um\nand like\num unable to do anything about them\nokay okay\nalexa can you listen to me yeah are you\nable to\nyeah so i want to point out something\nthat you said earlier okay i i don't\nthink things are as bad as you think\nthey are\nand i'd like to help you try to\nunderstand how\ncan you run with me for a little bit\nokay yeah\nyou said earlier that when he asks you\nhe when he mentions to you that the\nkettle\nmakes him he doesn't like the sound of\nthe kettle\ndo you remember what you said to me\nabout how that makes you feel\nuh yeah of about what\nuh that i'm gonna ruin the day is that\nhow you're feeling right now\nyeah same thing right so here's the\nthing\nit it's like it's like a mode that's\nactivated\nthis is the it's [ __ ] alex's fault\nright it's the same thing and the thing\nis\nit just as it's illogical then it's com\nit's it doesn't mean it's false\nbut that feeling arises it's the same\nthing you're like oh now i see how much\ni've messed up our relationship\ndude you haven't messed up your\nrelationship really like i honestly\nbelieve that\ni think that something somewhere along\nthe way you've got some kind of\nprogramming\nthat when someone expresses\nanything vaguely like a criticism\nbecause i think this is the other weird\nthing\nnow i got to be careful about this\nbecause i don't think this is your fault\nbut i think it's something you can\nchange\ni think sometimes evan is actually\nlooking for validation from you\nand what you try to do is make his life\nbetter\nwhen really all he wants you to do is\nsit and listen\nright so he doesn't actually want you to\nchange like he doesn't want you to\nchange because he recognizes that it's\nabsurd\nthat you should turn off the kettle\nbecause he finds it annoying\nyeah what he actually wants from you is\nnot for you to fix his problems but a\nshoulder to cry on\nkind of but something is happening where\nlike when i point out\nyou know when i start to criticize the\nnature of your relationship which is i\nthink what we're here for\nyeah right and then this thing arises\nand then like kind of takes over and\nthen you're like oh [ __ ] i [ __ ] it up\nit's all my fault and there's nothing i\ncan do to fix it\nwhich is whereas honestly i believe the\nexact opposite\nwhat do you think about that yeah um\nyeah i think you're right and i think\nlike this response isn't helping me as a\nperson get what i want\nin my life uh what i like deserve\nand i'd like to not do that okay\nespecially in my\nrelationship with evan okay do you blame\nyourself for having this response\ni sound gnarly no this will just sound\ngnarly but i blame my family\ngood that's the right people to blame\nbecause here's here's the concern that i\nhad because remember your response is to\nblame yourself right\nyes that's the response my actions are\ngoing to make us have a bad day\nand so then when i ask you so here's the\ntricky thing right like as i point out\nthis response to you\nthat same complex could arise again and\nsay oh it's my fault\nfor having this complex in the first\nplace\nwhich would just be the complex i don't\nknow if that makes sense yeah no it does\ni yeah it's alexa's fault complex it's\nlike\nit's alex's fault.exe let's open up that\nprogram\nand so then when i ask you is it alexa's\nfault that you keep on opening up this\nexe this [ __ ] malware\nand you're like actually it's my parents\nfault which means that that's not the\nprogrammer\nwhich i i agree right so i think that\nthis is something that you learn to do\nas an adaptation\nthat by taking all the blame onto\nyourself\nyou absolve other people of blame and if\nyou absolve other people of blame\nthen that allows you to stay in some\nkinds of relationships\nyeah or at least like uphold a world\nview that i think is important\nyeah beautifully said right\nyeah um\nokay how are you feeling now\nfeeling good yeah weird huh yeah no i\nfeel a lot better thank you\nyeah so what happened there let's try to\nunderstand that for a second\num it came up\nyeah and yeah how did we make it\nprobably some fairy dust i don't know\num i like stopped taking\nresponsibility for other people's\nactions but how did you do that just now\nbecause i made you feel like [ __ ] there\nfor a second\noh how did i do that\nokay because that's an important skill\nyo\nyeah that is that that's one i should\nretain um\nyeah um what did i do um\n[Music]\nwell i i realized like everything shitty\nin my life\nisn't always my fault but that's what\nyou were thinking right\nhow did you realize that\nhow did i realize that because you think\nit's your fault\nand then somehow today just now you were\nable to realize it\nand i i think basically the main thing\nis pointing it out to you\nso if you see that there's like malware\non your computer and you like\nyou know open up your processes and you\nsee it's there then you can like end\ntask that [ __ ]\nso like just try to catch this and\nrecognize\nalexa that at some points you got you're\ngoing to be interacting\nand then it's alexa's [ __ ] fault\ngets called up yeah and then then what's\ngoing to happen is\nthat controls you and when that controls\nyou you turn off the stove\nright yeah because that's what it's\nalexa's\nforget that i want to make tea how dare\ni inconvenience him with sound and then\nhe gets infuriated because he's like\nthat's [ __ ] insane like your t is\nmore important than my\ninconvenience yeah\nand and i i mean i don't think anyone\nhere is an [ __ ] it's it's just like\ngenuinely like this is what happens when\npatterns\nin our mind are operating without our\nknowledge\nyeah so just try to catch it and notice\nit that sometimes if people say things\nto you that may seem critical\nit can pop up yeah i think\nperhaps why i do this so much also is\nlike i get a lot of validation from\ndoing it uh like in\nmexico academics um\nespecially in academics when you say\nlike i take full responsibility for\nanswering this\nreally like shitty twist\nlike test question wrong and i'm gonna\nbe the one student who realizes like i\nshould have studied more\npeople like you yeah that's that's five\nhead level [ __ ] so here's the other\nthing right so like\nyou're not broken like this is adaptive\nespecially in academia beating yourself\nup is how you it sounds like you're\nstarting a graduate program\nit's the reason that you're starting\nyour graduate program if you didn't beat\nyourself up in undergrad you never would\nhave gotten into grad school\nyeah so that's a very very insightful\nconnection there\nalexa okay so let me just ask you one\nlast question and let's get\ni i imagine evan is getting nervous and\nhopefully he's not watching\nno i don't think he will be um nervous\nor watching\noh i'm sure he's not watching okay\nso in what ways are you guys not\ncompatible why are you concerned about\nyour future\num okay i'm gonna come up with some good\n[ __ ] here\nokay um\ni worry that um\nlike my main concern would be like if we\never have children i worry\nthat we're not gonna have a way to solve\nour problems\nand that our like children will be\nsubjected to a turbulent home life\nokay so you're concerned about your your\nlack of conflict resolution\nyes okay it's a good concern\ni too am worried about your lack of\nconflict resolution\ngood news is y'all are 22 and this is\nwhen you guys learn this [ __ ]\npeople aren't good at conflict\nresolution at the age of 22. i don't\nknow if you realize that or not\nit's like but we could be you can start\nthe process\nokay other concerns that you have\num\nyeah i guess my main concern about how\ndifferently the way\nour lives look day to day\nis that i want a partner to be\npresent with me like when i get home\nand yeah okay\nwhen i get home from school i don't want\nto feel like a burden\nfor [ __ ] being home\nokay and so then let me ask you\nsomething do you feel like a\ndoes does evan make you feel like a\nburden or do you feel like a burden when\nyou come home\num sometimes i do because he's still\nsleeping and then like\nif i want to spend time with him i would\nhave to wake him up and he hates waking\nup\nokay yeah what about other times\nwhat about when he's gaming and you come\nhome\num i would like we've talked a little\nbit about this but i like to\ni would like to know like a plan for\nwhen he thinks he'll be done\nso i don't sit around like a sad\nhousewife waiting for my\nhusband to get done with the work or\nwhatever\nokay so you know what i didn't hear\nthere alexa how do you feel right now\nmuy bien okay really you feel okay yeah\nyeah i feel fine because because i this\nis the first time that i've heard you\nkind of call him out and not protect him\nyeah right so earlier\nyou were saying i recognize that i can't\nalways be the priority in his\nin his life and that when i come home\nfinishing the game of league of legends\nis more important than saying hello to\nme and being warmly greeted\nbecause he moved across country with me\nto to pursue graduate school\nthat's what you said at the beginning\nand now you're saying eh\nactually yay we're going to torpedo your\nrelationship for the next 30 minutes\ndon't worry about it\nbut do you do do you see that difference\nyeah\nyeah no i do yes and i didn't know i was\ndoing it when i said\nyeah so so but that's okay like it's\nokay that you're doing it right because\nit serves a purpose\nit keeps your relationship harmonious\nwhich i think has been very important\nfor both of you\nyes doesn't fix it but keeps it\nharmonious okay\num that makes sense to me\nare you what do you think about like so\nit sounds like you're\nin grad school do you feel like you're\ngrowing as a person\num i'll start in the fall i haven't\nactually started yet\num am i growing as a person i think yes\nbecause i'm going through a lot of hard\nthings\nthat like for the first time i'm having\nto deal with as like an adult\nand not like somebody living under my\nuh family's domain cool\nuh yeah do you feel like evan is growing\nas a person\nuh um\ni think um\ni would say not as much as he'd like to\nbut probably\ni should say no right so so\neven there in that construction you\nfeeling okay\nyeah breathing you're being yeah you're\nfeeling i'm eight\nyeah i'm anxious but that's okay okay\nso so even then you did it again where\nyou kind of said\nyou started your answer with what you\nsaid\nsomething like he thinks not as much as\nhe wants to\nand then you said like because you're\nonce again adopting his frame of mind\nlike i'm asking you what you think and\nyou said he's probably not\ngrowing as much as he wants to\nyeah what are you feeling now\nsomething's happening alexa what's\nhappening\nwell it's just like a really messed up\nway to think that's not gonna help me\nand i feel like bummed that i'm a\nperson who is like trying so much\nto appease their partner's frame of mind\neven though\nhe's not even asking me to do that yep\nand in fact when you do that\nhe actually gets frustrated yeah he gets\nangry and like rightfully so it would be\nreally annoying\nlike yeah he's like yeah he like chose\nme\nbecause i can do my own thing okay so\nnow that i'm gonna any questions for me\nno how you holding up we too harsh on\nyou\nno it's okay this is good this is where\nthe growth happens\nit's not fun is it\nthat's that's the real [ __ ]\ni'll have a diet coke after this it'll\nbe fine good for you consider having a\nregular one\nyeah um okay so\nyou want to go ahead and grab evan yeah\nokay i want you to just\ntake like i want you guys to just have\ntake like come back in like 60 to 90\nseconds\nokay just just recollect your thoughts\nokay\nokay all right we'll be back in 60 to 90\nseconds\nokay\n[ __ ] i had something really important\ni wanted to think about it but i just\nlost it\noh yeah here's what it is\nso she doesn't okay\nokay\nokay\nhello\nuh i don't know okay\nall right so um\nall right so first thank you guys so\nmuch for coming on um\ni'm gonna actually start by asking each\nof you\nto summarize what you unders\nlike what you took away from our\nindividual conversations\nand share that with the other person\nand like sort of what you feel is\nimportant for them to know\nokay so we're going to start with your\nrepresentations of our individual\nconversation\nthe next thing that i'm going to ask so\nif if you're\nsharing if you're recapping the\nconversation\nwhat i want then the listener to do is\nto repeat back what they heard\nas opposed to respond so just make sure\nthat you guys are on the same page\nokay so who wants to go first i'll go\nfirst\nokay um we talked about\nhow um the way in which i\nblame myself is detrimental to us\ncommunicating in our relationship\nuh and doesn't really allow us to talk\nabout\nall of our problems when i like\nscapegoat myself\ni think i use that as a way to like not\naddress our issues\nbecause i'm like scared of actually\naddressing them\nyeah so what i heard is uh\nin like those times when i'm\nlike from my perspective when i'm trying\nto yeah start that conversation and\nbring up that feeling\num you're like self-critical\nlike over overly harsh on yourself\npart comes out and you start to think\nonly about like the things you\nwere doing wrong yeah i think like as a\nway to like absolve you\nbecause i think it's important in my\nmind that i\nalways view you in some stagnant way\nthat like makes me feel comfortable\nyeah that's really interesting yeah\nokay\nokay hold on so first of all\nalexa we talked about more than you\nblaming yourself which is the message\nyou're sending him\nright yeah you summarize the\nconversation is\ni do something bad but we talked about\nmore than that\num are you with me or no\nuh yeah\nso i'm gonna ask evan evan repeat back\nwhat you heard\nand just listen to what he's saying yeah\ni heard\nuh that you\nblaming yourself is the cause of our\nbreakdown in communication which in\nanother\nitself is yeah you blaming yourself for\nthe breakdown of communication\nso here we go [ __ ] my family\nokay so so say more um\nwell i think i like learned these\nadaptive uh\nbehaviors through like the role i played\nas a mediator in my family\nand those are not serving me well so i\nwould like to not do that\nand to like i would like to think about\na better way\nto think about myself in our\nrelationship\nand i think it would be helpful if you\npoint it out and i'll do my best to not\nscapegoat myself\nokay great you want to repeat back\nyeah that so you like at a certain at a\ntime in your life felt like you had to\nbe\nthat mature uh\nlike mediator of conversation and\nthat like you've it's easier for you to\nblame yourself\nthan like engage with\nour problems yeah okay so now comes\nthe next question which is\nwho is responsible for your situation\nalexa\nwe both are and what is his fault\num oh um\nit's hard isn't it yeah i don't know um\nokay that's okay yeah that's okay\nso i can also see you're starting to\nfeel anxious again\nthat's okay okay so we're gonna get to\nthat in a second\nbut i i want you evan to notice\nthat like i think you accept some\nresponsibility for your situation yes\nyeah and you also see how she blames\nherself for y'all's situation\nyep and sometimes we talked about some\nof the things that you do wrong\nbut even in this moment she's having\ntrouble\ncatching those because of the way that\nshe's been\nthe way she evolved in her family to be\nlike a mediator\nand more mature and accept\nresponsibility she also mentioned that\nit's like very helpful in academia for\nher to do this thing\nso it can be hard yeah right so in a\nweird way\nwhat you're gonna have to do is like\nthink like don't let her get away with\nthat [ __ ]\nokay i like this right so like here's\nthe problem with a relationship\nis if she blames herself like\nboth people have to have the same\nstrategy if i take all the\nresponsibility for all the problems in\nmy relationship\nand my wife takes all the problems for\nresponsibility in our relationship\nthat works out fine if i share\nresponsibility with her and she takes a\nhundred percent\nthat's not gonna work yeah okay if i\nblame her 100\nand she blames me 100 that's fine\n[Laughter]\nthe problem is when i take 100\nresponsibility and she gives me 100\nresponsibility\nthat's what an abusive relationship\nlooks like i don't think you guys are an\nabusive relationship i'm saying like\nthat's how they get them right because\nit's like always one person's fault\nand this whole thing with the water\nboiling thing is an example\nof like evan doesn't actually blame you\nso when he when you turn off the water\nthen he gets upset because like actually\ni don't want you to stop yeah\noh that's a great that's a great example\nyeah right see he gets it i remember\nright now yeah\nso like what pisses you off when she\nturns off the water kettle\nit's like a um and i guess this almost\ntransitions to what i'm saying or\nwhat we talked about which is that like\nthat's not what i meant\nwhen i say like i hate this like i hate\nthe stove because it sucks like\ni didn't want you to take the blame\nthere you know like that wasn't\nme trying to put anything onto you that\nwas just me expressing\nmy my feelings that just arise um\nand yeah i think it goes\nit circles around to like just being\nunderstood and like feeling like\nwhat i am like that you're on the same\npage as me and that like\nit's uh yeah okay okay any thoughts\nbefore we're gonna let evan go then any\nany responses or thoughts alexa\nyeah i guess i'm just like seeing how\nthese\nlike self-blaming behaviors are making\nit harder for you to feel heard\nin our relationship when that's not my\nintention at all\nso this is very helpful to hear yeah\ndo you feel heard evan\num when she said that yes\nokay right like so do you feel like she\ngets it\nyes okay right right there is uh and\nwhile she was saying it i got it in a\nway in a new way that i have\nwhere like i've circled around this\nthing before but the way you put it\nactually like yeah clicks something in\nmy brain as well which is that like my\nunderstanding thing connects to your\nlike self-blaming thing like this is\nthat's the\nthose two forces combined which is like\nmy thing in your thing\nyeah to faster yeah yeah yeah\nthat's how see it's both eels [ __ ]\nfall\ngood message okay so evan you want to\nyou want to share recap um\nyeah so we\nas mentioned talked about um\ni guess whether or not i feel understood\nby you\nand um\nlike what that like yeah\nwhat that brings up with me and like why\ni\ndo that and a lot of\nwe talked a lot about my\nfeeling of independence and like lost\nopportunity\nthroughout time being in this\nrelationship\nand that yeah i have some\nuh i identify with\nlike the things we said when we started\nthis relationship still and i feel like\na responsibility\nto do that what to what things facebook\nlike\nuh like big picture like you know we big\npicture like\nyeah yeah um and\nthat i don't want to like\nmisstep but i also need to change\nand it's hard for me to do that do both\nof those things\nin the like context of our relationship\nor just in the context of your life\nboth i don't know um\nokay explain what you mean evan by\nmisstep and change\num what's the sentence i use them in i\ndon't remember\nokay so i'm sorry i'm i'm not following\nmy own rules\nso alexa what did you hear from evan\nokay what i heard\nis that um i think at times\nyou do not feel understood\nby me and that\nyou are finding it hard to change\nand grow in some way and that um\nyou want to change and grow but you also\nwant to like honor\nthe like foundings like the\nfoundation of our relationship\nyeah i think yeah i think that's what i\nheard i agree with that okay\ni i like to honor the foundations of the\nrelationship that sounds\nyeah they're the house building\nwe started digging a hole yeah okay\nso uh evan are there other things that\nyou want to share or that you took away\nfrom our conversation\num\nnothing comes to mind okay i'm blinking\nright now yep so i think i'm gonna add a\ncouple of things so\num so the first thing is that that\nyou know evan you talked about feeling\nstagnant\nright and what did you can you share a\nlittle bit with\nwith alexa about how you feel about that\nuh sure i guess that\nlike yeah i've seen people do\na lot of things and i often\ncompare like our relationship to\nwhat i could have done in five years\nokay almost\num and like that i\nknow that that's not obv that's not the\ncase and that\ni can change in this relationship but\nthat um\nit yeah i there's some like\npart of me that it feels like safe being\n18 year old us who is just like in our\nparents basements you know it's very\nthere's a very uh comforting\nfeeling that like recreating that yeah\nrecreating that\nis like satisfying but\nthe other side of that coin is uh\nthere's like gnawing away at like always\nstaying\non a path of uh like\ncertainty rather than kind of seeing\nlike go venturing out yeah yeah making\nmy world bigger\nyeah what did you hear alexa\num i heard that over time you've seen\nother people you're close to in your\nlife change and that\nyou haven't seen that change in yourself\nand you wonder\nif like our relationship is somehow\nconnected to that\num and then you\nlike okay you um\nyou want to like see yourself in a\ndifferent way than how you saw yourself\nwhen you were 18 and we started dating\nand that\nuh i think what i hear is that you want\nroom in the relationship to grow\nto like allow you the personal uh\nbandwidth i guess to do that to like\nachieve new personal things and explore\nnew things\nbut at times you feel like you can't\nbecause of our the context of our\nrelationship\nyeah yeah um i guess\nthe one caveat i would add to that is\nthat like i don't\nuh know what i need you know like\nwhatever space in a relationship means i\ndon't\ni i guess i need some and it is i like\nthat you use the word wonder because\nit is a lot of wonder and like\nhypothesizing over\nlike oh sh what is this the thing like\nshould i sacrifice this relationship is\nthat what will make me change\nyeah um but i think you got the i think\nyou have the idea\nokay okay how does it feel to hear the\nphrase\nis sacrificing the relationship what i\nneed to change\nwhat do you think about that alexa i\nthink it's a legitimate\nwonder right like we have made a\nlong-term commitment to each other\nwhoops um\nand like i've been on an easy path i\nthink in life where i went to school and\nthen i graduated\nand then i got into this grad program\nand it's been easy for me to see\ndevelopment but for you\nit hasn't been that laid out and the\nonly like consistent thing has been our\nrelationship\nso you've kind of had to use our like\nrelationship as a landmark i think the\nquestion is like\nin the absence of those like landmarks\nin our relationship what would you do\nor what could you have done yeah\nfantastic okay can i share a couple of\nadditional things\nplease so um evan what do you think\nabout how much you gain\num\nit goes in waves and i\nfeel like i have some self-awareness\nover it\nbut when it does come i do\nnot like how much it is all right i do\nrecognize the uh\nkind of escapism that it offers me okay\nokay so we're going to talk for a second\nabout gaming\nso i think sometimes alexa picks up\nguilt from you about your feelings of\ngaming\nand she also feels frustrated that\nsometimes it feels like bizarrely\ni think you guys actually agree here so\nat one point we had sort of\nyou had said something about\nyou know feeling stagnant or something\nand then she responds by like\ninvalidating what you say by\npointing to things about what you guys\nlike say like you know\nwhen you guys have done stuff together\nyeah yeah\nand so the funny thing is that she\nactually kind of feels the same way\nbecause\nshe sort of feels like sometimes with\ngaming she's like\na housewife kind of twiddling her thumbs\nlike she'll be out doing stuff and then\nshe'll kind of come home and you'll be\nlike\ngaming and then she'll be like okay what\nelse like so sometimes it's sort of like\nshe's not sure\nwhen she's playing a single player game\nand when she's playing a co-op game\nyeah yeah yeah cause i'm literally just\nplaying a\ngame with different random people yeah\nright right so so i think she expressed\nsome frustration\naround that which it took some work\nfor her to even be able to say that she\nwas kind of frustrated with that so\nstrong work\nalexa but but i i think you guys really\nhave to look at the gaming because i\nthink it is\ni think like a loss of potential\ni've certainly seen relationships that\nfall apart\nfollowed by immense growth on the part\nof a gamer\nbut it's not because the relationship\nfell apart it's usually\nhonestly the situation is girl dumps guy\nguys like oh [ __ ] i have to get my act\ntogether and then like cuts back on his\ngaming\nokay yes and and so i think if there's\nany sort of lawson\nof potential it sounds like evan how\nmany how many hours do you play on\non average per week um\nsince we moved i will probably play\n15 to 20 i think before that yeah\nlike during early covet i could easily\nlog\n40 to 50. okay and what about like one\nyear ago\noh i mean that last summer was\nwas not a good summer necessarily and\nthat was probably\nyou're you're 60 or 70. yep that's what\ni mean i think\neveryone watching twitch was aware of\nthat yes you know i think we can tell\num so so i i'm proud yeah\nso i mean that's us we we recognize\nourselves\num so i i think the other thing in terms\nof your stagnation and your lack of\ngrowth like\nif you're pounding out 60 hours a year\nago like that's why you're not growing\nit's not because you've been dating the\nsame chick for four years\nyeah right like to be blocked and\nand yes um you know so i think that's\nsomething that you guys are gonna have\nto work on especially because\nuh you know evan you do have it sounds\nlike sometimes you get\nangry very easily which is also common\nfor people who play a lot of league of\nlegends\nand dota and games in general cs go you\ncan take it call it whatever you want\num the one other thing that i want to\npoint out so i think you guys really\nhave to look at that\nand evan what you really need to do is\nthink about\nwhat ways do you want your life to\nchange\nand then what you need to do alexa is\nwhen he tells you his want\nhe wants his life to change in a\nparticular way you can't make it your\nfault\nokay his life is the way that's the\nworst thing that you can do\nand here's the other thing the\nconnection so i'm glad you guys are able\nto see that like some of your problems\nare not your fault or her fault it's\nwhat you guys combine together\nso earlier we were talking about evan\nbeing the judge and how he's like\nbasically like\njudges you right and then that makes you\nfeel bad\nso that also you guys can go back and\nwatch the pod but i think the other\ninteresting thing is that like\nyou like to be the judge and then she\nalso likes to be the accused\nright that's very well put yeah and so\nit's like\nlike y'all are both falling into that\npattern because both of you feel\ncomfortable with it\nso she likes to be the accused because\nshe's the mediator she you know it's\nadaptive in an academic setting\nyou've got to figure out where that\njudgeness comes from\nand and so kind of just notice that\nthese patterns that you guys have\nare like something that you guys create\ntogether\num but but i really i i mean\nyeah so so thoughts any questions about\nthat\num maybe a question of like\nso i yeah set um\ni guess like set standards for what not\nstandard i don't know\nget an idea of what i want moving\nforward and realistically what that\nlooks like\num sometimes i worry about like\ninvolving her too much\nin that goal so if it is like stop\nlike gain less like only only game on\nfriday saturday sunday or something and\nthe rest of the time is like\ndedicated to work days or something um\nlike i i worry of like involving her in\nthat and\nhaving putting a responsibility on her\nand holding me accountable\nyep that's your independence streak\nyou see it you want to do it on your own\nyes\nright so just because so yes i i should\nask her for help\nwell that's something you've got to sort\nthrough\nso maybe i should just start blaming you\nwhen you came outside of fred\nfriday saturday yes and so we're going\nto talk about things that are going to\ntorpedo your relationship in a second\nbut evan i get what you're saying\nbecause i think you're someone who\nmuch like antidepressants wants to learn\nhow to do it on your own\nright so i'm not saying that there's a\nright answer or a wrong answer there\nbut like i i think that it may be\npossible to recruit her\nin some ways but i think if you use her\nas an accountability tool\nit's going to piss both of you off okay\nshe can't make you accountable i think\nwhat she can do\nand this is something you've got to work\non alexa is recognize that when he comes\nto you with a problem he's not looking\nfor you to fix it\nhe's actually just looking for you to\nlisten and this is bizarre because this\nis like\nreally a gender reversal in traditional\nheteronormative relationships\nwe're very proud of that yeah so usually\nit's the woman\nwho will express some frustration and\nthen the man is like how do i fix it\nand then it's like she doesn't want you\nto fix it she just wants you to listen\nso alexa i think sometimes when evan is\nlike i don't know what to do in our\nrelationship\nand then you're like what can i do to\nmake it better that's not what he wants\nfrom\nokay what question would be more\nproductive to ask\nor what what's a better response\nwhat feels like it's unproductive in our\nrelationship or\nwhy do you feel like you're stagnant\njust try to understand\ndon't try to fix don't try to help try\nto understand\nfirst and foremost\nokay tell me more period not even a\nquestion oh yeah\nokay and then what and then what you can\ndo is you can employ\ni think in general instead of sitting in\nsilence with each other while y'all are\neating your food\ntry doing so recognize that the emotions\nare going to come up and then try doing\nwhat we did today\nwhich is just repeat back what the other\nperson said don't respond to it\ni like that yeah okay and then you guys\nare gonna get on the same page\nokay it's really hard to do by the way\nokay\nit's easy to do here with a referee but\nlike when y'all are pissed off\nand when you're it's alexisfalt.exe is\nactive\nthen it's hard to do but you guys have\nto pull yourselves out and and really\ntry to practice okay okay thank you\nlast thing that i'll say is that so the\nquestion is should we break up\nand my answer is maybe so here's what\ni'll say\ni think you guys are not the people that\nyou were five years ago\nand this relationship is not what it was\nfive years ago\nso the question should you guys can you\ncontinue this relationship\nabsolutely not the question is can the\ntwo of you\ngrow as individuals and evolve your\nrelationship into what it needs to be\nnow which is not what it was five years\nago\nthat what evan needed was safety and\nsupport\nand someone else to take the blame when\nhe felt like things were his fault\nbecause he lacked confidence and all\nthis kind of [ __ ]\nright i'm just hypothesizing there you\nguys can\nright and but now what what he needed\nfive years ago alexa is different from\nwhat he needs from you now\nwhich is like the exact thing that made\nyour relationship\nso valuable is now the very thing that's\nkeeping it from growing\nyeah and so i think both of you guys\nneed to grow\nas people as individuals and then see if\nyou guys can like continue to evolve but\ngenerally speaking i'm hopeful\nright but like that you y'all both\nunfortunately do have to acknowledge\nthat like\nyou know people who get together when\nthey're 17 don't stay together for their\nentire life all the time\nand i think the ones who do it are the\nones who recognize that like you guys\nare starting a new relationship\nnow with each other that each of you is\nevolving and changing and if you guys\ncan support each other and doing that\nat some point it sounds to me like\nthere's enough good stuff there that\nit's like you know worth giving it a try\nbut you all aren't going to be 17 year\nolds for the rest of your life so you\ncan't preserve that relationship\nand in fact it's trying to preserve that\nrelationship where a lot of like sadness\nand suffering comes from\nright yeah yeah yeah i think\ni really like a lot of what you said\nespecially gather like\nwe needed something then and\nwe need something now and we're not the\nsame people and\ni like the idea of like it's a new\nrelationship yeah\nit's a new type of relationship yeah uh\nat\nin each new stage right at all times\nyeah yeah\nyeah so like for another good example\nof what is a new relationship is like if\nyou guys have kids one day\nthen you're just not the same people you\nwere after you have kids\nyour relationship completely changes\nright so that's an example of a common\nevolution\nin relationships that sometimes end up\nfracturing\nrelationships right which is okay\nokay last thoughts or questions\num like how do i\nstop myself from this like self-blaming\ndialogue\nlike are there any good questions i can\nask myself when evan says like\npoints it out uh so\nwhat i would say first and foremost is\nyou have to notice it\nso you can even go back and watch the\nvod and see what happened and try to\nremember what happened in your mind\nbecause you did shut it off it's really\njust noticing because\nwhen when that programming activates you\nthink it's fact\nyou don't realize that it is a program\nin your mind that's running\nand so just recognizing that oh [ __ ] my\nmind is gonna do its thing again\nlike think about your mind like kind of\nlike a\nyou know like a bad leg that sometimes\ngives out\nand it's like it's not your fault it's\njust like the leg sometimes poops out\nit's like it's just doing its thing\nagain so your mind is gonna do its thing\nand there may be some triggers\nlike criticism or feeling like or\nactually bizarrely\nyours may not be triggered by criticism\nof you it may be triggered by\npain on the side of evan\nright actually that's what the trigger\nis so that's what's weird is it's like\nwhen\nevan expressed his frustration about\nsomething in his life\nyou're like how can i make this my fault\nand take the pain away from you evan\nand then when you do that like you gotta\nnotice when she does it and try to point\nit out and be like hey are you taking my\npain away just ask her\nyeah and then you guys figure it out\nmm-hmm\nyeah yeah okay thank you that's given a\nlot of words\nto a lot of vague feelings feelings\nlike acted out over time that's what we\ndo here\nokay so last question is do you all want\nto learn how to meditate\nlet's do it yes okay so this is i think\nthis is going to be fun so we're going\nto do om chanting we haven't done it in\na little while\nbut i think home chanting is especially\ngood if you guys want to be\npartners oh good then because champions\nwe still do stream chat\num so if you guys uh so i think om\nchanting is actually good to\nlike it's actually better when you do it\nwith other people\nso what i want you guys so we're gonna\ndo it together\nokay okay so i want you all to sit up\nstraight\nokay um so i'm gonna demonstrate so om\nis composed of three syllables\nah and and then\ni understand that sometimes on discord\nit cuts out so let me actually try to\nlet me know if it cuts out okay because\ni think discord's voice activation\nalgorithm like chops it it happens okay\non stream but\nso what i'm gonna do uh so i'm gonna\nstart with\n[Music]\nthat you guys hear that we heard\nright so you go from a fully open mouth\nto a fully closed map okay okay okay so\none or two things to remember about\nchanting\none is chanting is not about sound it's\nabout vibration\nso you don't want to focus on what you\nhear you want to focus on what you\nfeel okay people feel anxious\nwhen they start to chant because let's\nbe honest\nit's [ __ ] weird and then the the goal\nthough\nis that like notice that anxiety within\nyou and then like start focusing on the\nvibration\nand as you chant the anxiety will just\nlike\nfade away which is also useful\nokay so i'm gonna demonstrate with\nthree breaths and then we're gonna do\nthree breaths together\ni'll demonstrate with two let's say and\nthen we'll do three together okay so\ndid that clip out entirely oh yeah okay\nso hold on one second okay let me just\nfix this let me move to push to talk\nand then hopefully this works okay\nall right so i'm going to try one more\ntime with push to talk no we don't hear\nyou\noh yeah i need to try now\nthat is the okay keyword one more time\n[Music]\nyou guys hear it that time yeah okay\ngreat is that one\nthat's one okay okay so we're gonna do\nthree breaths now okay in succession\nwith eyes closed\nokay all right so sit up straight\nyoutube twitch chat big deep breath\nokay big deep breath\n[Music]\nah\n[Music]\nagain\n[Music]\nfour more deep breath in\n[Music]\n[Laughter]\n[Music]\nin\n[Laughter]\n[Music]\ntwo more deep breath in\n[Laughter]\n[Music]\nlast one make it count\nnow we're just gonna sit about 30 to 60\nseconds\nall right\nokay\nokay\ngo ahead and come on back\ngo ahead and come on back i forgot that\ni\nshould talk how do you feel\nvery peaceful very yeah my mind is very\nat ease cool\nso maybe that'll help you guys so it's a\ngood practice that you all can do\ntogether did you guys\nharmonize or resonate with each other we\ncouldn't really hear you but\ni don't know i i\nwhile we were chanting i definitely felt\na sense of\nuh like yeah for sure like anxiety at\nthe beginning but\nonce we were in it um i was losing\ntrack of my voice versus her voice\nversus\ncoming through my earbud voice great\nthat's the whole point yeah yeah so you\nwant to lose track of\nthe individual\ncool well thank you guys very much for\ncoming on any last thoughts or questions\nbefore we wrap up\nmaybe no i would just like to say thank\nyou know what therapist i've seen for\nthe past\nseven years he's been as insightful and\nblunt with me as you have and i really\nappreciate that\njust a reminder this isn't therapy\nthough yeah yeah i know i know\nit's a nice friendly conversation yeah\nso i mean\ni think yeah it's it's strange because\noftentimes with my actual therapy\npatients i will not be as insightful or\nas blunt\nbecause therapy is a longer process and\nyou know i think we just have two hours\nwith you all so\ngotta make it count well thank you i\nthink you did\nso we very much appreciate it yeah of\ncourse man so we're rooting for you\ntwitch chat is rooting for you but\ndoesn't mean that you have to stay\ntogether\nbut i think we're all in your corner and\nso good luck\nthank you thank you very much thank you\nguys very much for coming on and\nsharing so much because i think this\nreally helps everyone\nyeah strong work we hope so have a good\nday you too\nyou too thanks"
