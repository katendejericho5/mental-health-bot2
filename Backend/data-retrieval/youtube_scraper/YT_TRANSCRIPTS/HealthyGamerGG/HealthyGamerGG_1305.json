    "transcript": "i i don't know how to like put this in a\nquestion but can you\naddress the i need dr k kind of type\nthat people\nlike you are the only one who will\nlike help yeah so\ni'm gonna ask permission for to play a\nclip for you guys from someone\nso there was so so you know so i do\ncoaching\nand we also have coaching groups right\nso you guys can sign up and\ndepending on the role of the dice you\ncan get paired with different people\nso i run a group and the group ended\nrecently\nand um so we were just kind of offering\nfeedback about the end of the group\nand i couldn't have said it better\nmyself but one person was like i came to\nthis group because i thought dr k was\nthe only one that could help me like i\nwas convinced that\nhe was the only one and he understood me\nso well and\nhe's he's the only one that could help\nme after 16 weeks of working with dr\nk i realized that i never needed him\nand that like really what i needed like\nthe only person i needed was myself\nand that's the truth and that's like the\nbest feedback that i could get\nis everyone has this perception that\nwhat you guys need is me but like that's\nyou all don't\nneed me you know it's kind of like just\nbecause you watch a cooking show and\nthere's like an amazing\nyou know like like those amazing\nfive-star chef or whatever who's like\nmaking this food like sure that food\nthat dude makes delicious food but\nthere's like delicious food all over the\nplace\ni know that a lot of people feel like\ni'm the only one for them and\nbelieve me it's flattering but i think\nyou guys don't know me as well as i do\nand i think you'd be surprised at what\nyou're capable of is if you put your\nmind to it and work with\njust anything like really any therapist\nit's about what you guys put in not\nabout what we put in\nthe last thing that i want to say i'm\ngoing to read something to you guys\nokay so there's a post on our subreddit\nright now\nthat says today's chat with zach and his\nfather dave is probably the most\nincredible thing healthy gamer has ever\ndone\nso i want you guys to think about this\nfor a second\nwhat makes that incredible\nbecause it's not me right so like i'm\nthe constant and healthy gamer but what\nmakes that so impactful\nis like zack and day like sure i'm the\ncommon element but if you really think\nabout it like why are\nlike the reason that some things are\nimpactful and other things are not\nimpactful if it was me then everything\nwe\nwould do would be like equally impactful\nbut it's not\nit's the person who comes on that makes\nthings\nimpactful or not that's where the money\nis that's where the value is\nthe real value comes from you you just\nthink it comes from me because you\nalways see my face\nbut if you really think about it the\nbulk\nof healing doesn't come from me\nit comes from the people who come on\nstream it comes from you\nand so for those of you who think that\nyou you need dr k like i don't doubt\nthat i could help you\nbut i i really am like not that special\nthe thing is what i i mean i fail too\nand what what causes me to fail or\nsucceed\ndepends on the person sitting across\nfrom me because i can't fix them\nthey have to fix themselves i'm just\ngonna help them\nand so the real thing that you need for\nyour success is not me\nis you if you show up and you give it\nyour best effort with a therapist i\nthink you're gonna do a good job\nand that's what we hear from people\nright like even zach\non on wednesday's stream was like yeah i\nstarted seeing a therapist and i've i've\ngotten a little bit better\nturns out he's probably gotten a lot\nbetter\nbut like he didn't need me like i don't\nthink any of y'all\nneed me specifically\ni know it sounds weird but the real\nmoney is on\non you it's like there's no i mean that\ndoesn't it's just how it is"
