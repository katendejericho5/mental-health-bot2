    "transcript": "how so how are you doing I'm all right\nyeah I haven't slept in quite well but\notherwise doing all right what's up with\nthat especially no so I started I\nstarted paying a little bit more close\nattention to my health good for you\nI've been logging it because I have a\nplanet nothing happens unless I write it\ndown because I've got bad memory\nproblems so I I write what I've been\neating how much caffeine I'm having how\nmuch have slept that sort of thing and\nthere's only one day this week were\nactually slept I tried to take a nap on\nanother day I think I lasted an hour and\na half maybe but yeah I don't know why\nI'm just I'm just not sleeping hmm what\nis it that keeps you from sleeping busy\nlike you're so busy that you literally\ndo not sleep yeah\nwhere do you do uh your dad he's good\nI'm sorry he's not he's not good\nI been I've been just getting on with my\nlife I mean since that since that since\nthat cuts that since the in since that\nsince since Kovac broke out and it's not\nbeen we haven't been able to get carers\nout to my mom's a bit a bit more busy\ntaking care of her as well as you know\nrunning a stream running a YouTube\ntaking care of rescue animals a lot of\nthe charities to take on animals right\nnow are understaffed because of covert\nso I I'm getting a lot more people come\nto me when they have injured animals so\nyeah I've just been busy very very very\nvery busy and weirdly I feel more okay\nthan I should be at this point\nI feel like now I should be like really\nreally sleepy but I'm okay\nyeah I'm concerned about you any that I\nam I used to be worried about this\nlittle thing but I've actually grown\nquite used to it I'm kind of a burnout\nQueen even before I streamed life used\nto get like this every now and again and\nweirdly I'd always pull through so I\nwouldn't worry too much because I'm\npretty sure I'm gonna be fine yeah so is\nit okay for me to be worried about you\nif you're even if you're gonna be fine\noh then what's the point seems like a\nwaste to worry\nwell because I I'm concerned that so\nyou're saying you're gonna be fine let's\naccept that for a second but what\nworries me is that like what you're\nshooting for is fine survival right eye\nand what I would want for you is more\nthan survival I guess I guess I'm very a\nvery very very very very much more\ncomfortable being busy yeah and tired\nthen still since for me this is this is\nokay okay difficult but it's okay is it\nokay if I is there something in\nparticularly you want to talk about\ntoday by the way I didn't make any plans\nI'm quite notorious for that perfect so\nyeah I would read to talk about whatever\nyou and me both\nright so then can we talk a little bit\nabout I'm curious if it would be useful\nto talk about like why stillness feels\nuncomfortable for you sure yeah\nwhat feels uncomfortable about being\nstill why you got to be moving all the\ntime\n[Music]\nI guess for a lot of reasons I mean I\nfeel a lot of guilt if I stay still I\nfeel like I'm wasting time and letting\npeople down but also it's been my coping\nmechanism for difficult so if I am in a\nsituation where I'm not very comfortable\nlike emotionally if there's something\nthat's been going on I just keep busy\nbecause then I can only give enough time\nto face it in increments which allows me\nto face it without it hitting me too\nhard and so I think in part it becomes\nthe coping mechanism for adversity I\nguess sure and that sounds pretty\nimportant because it sounds like maybe\nif you let it hit you all at once it\nwould be overwhelming yeah so\nlike it's a pretty important coping\nmechanism yeah I think it's working out\nI mean uh uh uh he's I was I was I don't\nI don't know if you know this but I used\nto be depressed for thirteen years I\ndidn't so yeah I had I had I had a\ndifficult background god I remember yeah\nso obviously I think it's kind of\nnatural to not be happy about that but I\ndid have really very severe depression\nfor thirteen years I had a severe social\nphobia and anxiety which is\nunderstandable especially when I didn't\nhave a diagnosis and it was kind of\nscary to interact with people because I\nnever knew how that was gonna go um so\nyeah I don't think it was so much a\nfailing or anything I think it's just\nkind of a normal reaction to the\nsituation I was in and what was the\nnormal reaction I'm sorry to be\ndepressed about it yeah but luckily I\ngot out of that and even though you know\num maybe not living the most\nconventional life and pretty happy\nI don't feel depressed I don't feel down\nI don't wake up feeling kind of bad\nabout the day I feel quite excited about\nwhat's gonna happen next but sounds\nawesome\nyeah so like even though it may on the\noutside seem very uncomfortable\nit's actually really working for me to\njust stay busy and keep moving yeah so\nthat that makes a lot of sense that can\nI just tell you what I heard mm-hmm so\nit sounds like you were depressed for a\nwhile\nyou had somewhat of a tough upbringing\nyou had some social phobias and you kind\nof managed to get out of that somehow\nand now maybe when you're dealing with\nas you put an adversity or there are\nsome kinds of emotions that you're\nexperiencing staying busy is like a\nreally good way of coping with it and\nand I'm not hearing that you're really\nlike suppressing or anything it sounds\nlike you genuinely find enjoyment in\nwhat you do you're not like necessarily\nblocking things out or things like that\nit's just like you wake up every day\nyou're pretty happy about what you do\nyou care for people and animals that you\nlove and you make the world a better\nplace and\nit kind of helps you feel fulfilled and\nhappy yeah yeah so I I mean that makes\nsense to me I think the only thing\nthat's a little bit confusing for me is\nthat like if you're still then guilts\nhappens right so it it sounds to me like\nI just have trouble reconciling there's\ntwo things in your mind in my mind that\nthat you know there can be sort of\nhappiness and fulfillment but it sounds\nto me like if you're still and there's\nguilt and there's a feeling of letting\npeople down then maybe there is a little\nbit of well I don't know suppression is\nthe right word because it sounds like\nwhat you do is you you kind of manage it\nin your own way over time right that's\nthe way that you deal with it is you\nkind of take chunks and then you kind of\nprocess a little bit and then chunks and\nthen process a little bit but I but I\ncan't help but hear so it sounds like\nit's a formula that works for you yeah I\nmean it can't land me in a lot of\ntrouble how's that well it means I'm\nslow to anger one of the disadvantages\nof having Tourette's syndrome is a lot\nof people don't know you get sick\nemotions so I will get out of context\njoy or out of context anger the thing is\nwhen you get a surge of emotion it's\nquite natural for your brain to try and\nrationalize that so if you get a rage if\nyou get a surge of rage you're like it's\nbecause of this and it could be\nsomething stupid like I don't know if\nthere's a scuff on the table your brain\ntries to rationalize things it doesn't\nreally understand so if you have an\nincomprehensible wave of motion you try\nto contextualise it and the way I've\nmanaged that so that I don't rage out at\npeople or just be really sad and burst\nin tears over nothing is I sit beside my\nemotions become detached from them and\nwatch them as if they're I'm an observer\nlike a scientist documenting a feeling\nso I'm like wow my heart rate has sped\nup\nI can feel a tingle in my teeth my\nfingers have gone cold I can feel my\nbrain like rushing towards this kind of\nthought and that kind of thought and I\nsit beside it and listen to it and make\nsense of it go is this a tic or is this\na genuine feel and this means that I\nhave a delay in my anger which means\nthat when people are inappropriate\ntowards me\nI don't immediately react the way that\nthey should and I don't necessarily get\nto safety\nor challenge\nthe situation in the way that I should\nbecause I question whether or not I\nshould be mad and I need time to figure\nthat out and so someone might not figure\nout that they've been disrespectful or\nthat they need to stop the certain\nbehavior I don't really communicate that\nand and this isn't a very delayed sense\nquite often which puts me in danger\nand has done fairly recently even and so\nyeah it does have disadvantages but I\nfeel like it's a side effect of of of\ngrowing up with Tourette's because a lot\nof children especially have difficulties\nwith like especially tick rage but I've\nmanaged to be a very calm person by\nmanaging my emotions in this way but\nyeah it means that because I deal with\nmy emotions in increments and I make\nsense of them especially adversity I end\nup I end up I end up taking like weeks\nsometimes to figure out how I feel about\nthings and that delay can definitely be\na disadvantage at times hmm hey your\nthoughts seem very well-formed Thanks I\ndon't know how time has lost all meaning\nat this point I'm pretty tired yeah it I\ncan hear that you've thought about it a\nlot or analyzed it a lot or really spent\na lot of time trying to understand\nyourself and trying to figure out how to\nmanage some of your internal environment\nah I think I'm just listening to my\nmonologue I think I'm just listening I\ndon't I don't know that I necessarily\nput a lot of time into it I mean I\nalways get this thing where people tell\nme it sounds like a rehearsed what I say\non stream or that I've written it down\nor foot it through a lot I haven't\nusually I'm just formulating that on the\nspot I think it's it's not so much that\nI'm paying lots and lots of energy into\nfiguring stuff out it's just I'm\ngenuinely listening to myself yeah that\nthat's interesting to hear because it\ndoes sound well-thought-out it sounds\nyou know so so even even if you're not\nconsciously thinking about it I think\none of the consequences of observation\nis understanding and what I'm hearing\nfrom you is that you underst\nyourself quite well and you've noticed\ndifferent patterns that you have you've\nnoticed different strategies you've used\nto cope with Tourette's and situations\nand the the interesting thing in eating\nand I don't know if this is I kind of\ndon't know exactly what we're talking\nabout today but let me tell you what I'm\nseeing if that's okay so yeah you know\nit sounds like you've been Delta a very\nunique hand of cards in life and you've\nlearned certain strategies to manage\nthose hands of that hand of cards how to\nplay that handle and you've done a\nreally good job of playing the hand of\ncards that you've been dull and so one\nof like as you mentioned like one\nexample of this is that you've learned\nhow to just look at your emotions and\nnot kind of give in to them and the\nproblem with your strategy though is\nthat it sounds like sometimes for the\nmost part it works really well and it's\nallowed you to be successful and\nfunctional in this world but that there\nare some kind of cracks at the seams\nand and I've heard you say some words\nthat still concern me and so you said\nsomething about you know like burnout is\nsort of what you do like so that doesn't\nsound like a great strategy to me you\nknow there's there's the sense of guilt\nand letting people down if you set still\nif you sit still and then lastly use the\nword danger that sometimes the way that\nyou you distance yourself from emotions\nleads you to danger and that's scary\nlike III don't know I mean because\nyou're so articulate granted you may not\nhave thought things out you're maybe\nthinking them through as you speak but\nthat's a powerful word and and I'm just\nnot quite sure how to understand or how\nto think about you know a system that\nseems to work so well and allow you to\nhelp so many people but then also tosses\nout words from your head like guilt\nletting people down being unable to sit\nstill getting yourself into danger and\nburnout\nyeah pros and cons yeah\nfancy it has a lot of really powerful\nupside to me but also a lot of powerful\ndownsides I mean to give you some scope\nof what my life looks like right now I\nthink if I genuinely described it I\nthink a lot of chat would assume that\nI'm not very happy or that it'd be\ndifficult to be happy in my\ncircumstances mmm let's let's hear about\nit I'd love to if you're okay with that\nokay I I'm worried I'm a little bit\nscared this is a tentative situation you\nsee if I start listing the things that I\nfind difficult in life there are gonna\nbe a bunch of people who hear this he\nthink I'm fishing for pity so I'm always\nvery nervous about describing my life in\ndetail because yeah can we talk about\nthat for a second sure why would you\nthink that people think you're fishing\nfor pity\nbecause people I've noticed a reaction\nand people in real life and on the\ninternet that if someone seems\nvulnerable people are afraid of being\nmanipulated it's one of the hardest\nthings to come up against this one with\nTourette's or any kind of disability on\nstream is that people are afraid of\nbeing manipulated and so you know I get\nlots of people saying that I'm the next\nzillion ope and things like this and I\nam what is that that was once a streamer\nQ I don't know much about it I wasn't on\nTwitch when it happened but as far as I\nknow there was a streamer who pretended\nto have a disability in order to get\ndonations for years accidentally stood\nup on camera even though he was claiming\nto have a wheelchair I think that was\nthe what happened am i right\ncheck there I'm sure there was some\nveterans here who know\nyeah yeah yeah yeah okay so basically he\nforgot his camera was still on and stood\nup and yeah it came to like that yet\nperhaps he might have been overplaying\nhis condition although I'm not sure I\nmean people don't flat check on twitch\nand I do know that some people who need\na wheelchair can stand up but can't\nstand up for long periods of time for\nexample so I don't know whether it was\ngenuinely that he didn't have a\ndisability or that people just expected\na disability to present in a specific\nway and got outraged when he stood up I\ndon't know but anyway people quote that\nand they're like kind of accusing me of\nbeing fake all the time because yeah\npeople are scared of being kind and\nempathetic and people are scared of\nbeing used and so when when people talk\nabout their hardships I certainly\nnoticed a trend of not being met with\nkind of empathy but rather suspicion and\nso it's very very scary to put your\ndifficulties let to lay them out on the\ntable sometimes because do you think a\npity no I think I'm doing all right I\nthink I'm I'm pretty happy with the fact\nthat I managed to live the life that I\ndo and do as much as I do\njust by everything I think that's the\npoint I feel I feel really good about\nthat would you be okay if you were\ndeserving a pity\nprefer empathy it's a pity I didn't\nreally I don't really feel like I need\npity but I think that you know if people\nwant to empathize with my situation I\nthink that's just natural I empathize\nwith people who have facing stuff you\nknow it's normal so how would you\ndescribe the difference between pity and\nempathy it's use when you're glad you're\nnot someone and empathy is when you feel\nwith someone it's a great way to put it\nhmm so you're concerned that you will be\nperceived as fishing for pity mm-hmm as\nin as in people\nbut if I openly discuss everything that\npeople will disbelieve me or think that\nI'm trying to manipulate them so can I\noffer a reason why I think this is an\nimportant discussion so I think that\npeople assume that their circumstances\nare primarily responsible for their\nhappiness or unhappiness\nmake sense did you say that again yeah\nso people assume that their\ncircumstances are responsible for their\nhappiness or their unhappiness one of\nthe most mind-boggling things that I've\ndiscovered is that certainly\ncircumstances influence your happiness\nor unhappiness but what are the most\nshocking things is that sometimes people\ncan be in bad circumstances and it can\nbe happy and sometimes people can be in\ngood circumstances and be unhappy yes\nand generally speaking the internet\nloves to get their pitchforks out when\nthere is someone in good circumstances\nwho is unhappy and we sort of have this\nidea that circumstances and I'm not\nsaying that they don't influence\nhappiness there's data that suggests\nthat certainly a certain amount of like\nfinancial security correlates with\nhappiness or a sense of security so I'm\nnot saying that they're completely\nindependent but I think it could\nactually be useful for people to hear\nabout your circumstances and then also\nhear how you're able to be happy in\nspite of them because that's an\nimportant lesson to learn\nwhat do you think about that\nyeah we could do that okay cool so the\nother thing to just think a little bit\nabout is you know we were talking\nearlier about your strategy and how\nthere are pros and cons and I wonder\nwhether it's worthwhile like discussing\nare there other ways or are there ways\nto deal with the cons of your strategy\nyeah because can I just speak plainly\nfor a second mm-hmm so based on our last\nconversation like I don't know what you\nremember about it but I remembered a\ncouple of things and I think you\ngenerally speaking don't place yourself\nhigh enough on the priority list of\nwhat's important and that's just\nsomething that I had to take away from\nlast time and I know that you're an\namazing person and you make the world a\nbetter place it's just there's a part of\nme that is that fields and this is a\njudgment and I apologize if this offends\nyou that you should try to make the\nworld a better place for you from time\nto time and that's one of the big cons\nof your strategy that actually makes me\nsad is because like it bothers me when\nsomeone can't sit still because they\nfeel guilty and like they're letting\nother people down that just bothers me\nand I I'm trying I don't know if that's\nsympathy or empathy I'm not quite sure\nbut you know it makes me sad to think\nthat and this is gonna be an\nexaggeration this could be unfair but\nI'm gonna say it anyway this is how I\nfeel it makes me sad to imagine you\nbeing unable to be happy with yourself\nunless you're doing something for\nsomeone else\nso I leave it up to you as in terms of\nwhich direction we go okay and if you\nneed me to recap a couple of options I'm\nhappy to yes so the couple of options\none are the two big options are to hear\na little bit about you know how your\nlife is hard and then to explore a\nlittle bit about how you can be happy in\nspite of difficult circumstances right\nso to paint a pitiable picture which is\nwhat you're afraid of but then also like\nrealize that actually we don't have to\npay to you because you're happy and how\ndo you find that happiness despite being\nin circumstances that other people may\npity because that's huge like if we can\nunderstand that like that's gonna help\ntons of people could be the most helpful\nthing that we ever discover on stream\nwhich is how to get okay so tell us\nabout your circumstances okay so I have\nan autoimmune disorder okay about six or\nseven times a day at least when I do\nmake the time just the I wake up several\ntimes drowning because everyone else\nwhen they have fluid running down the\nback up they're very all day like this\nlighter and stuff it goes somewhere but\nfor me it doesn't and I choke on it and\nI kind of wake up with burning lungs and\nI am a high risk of pneumonia\naspirational pneumonia and lung scarring\nso I'm in pain whenever I try to sleep I\ndon't get a good night's sleep and I am\nconstantly vomiting I'm tired\nsome days I won't be able to eat for a\nfew days because my body just decides\nthat it's not gonna let any food in and\nI'm just going to be sick every time I\ntry to get something into my stomach I\ntried to get on basic things and I have\na lot of responsibilities but they're\ndifficult because sometimes my tics get\nin the way and I'll throw things on the\nfloor smash things I'll burn myself\ntrying to cook I will try to feed the\nrabbits and just threw the food\neverywhere I'll you know I'll punch\nmyself in the face I'll and I'll be so\ntired and busy and even when I try to\nsleep I can't\nso sometimes I'll be getting home with\nsomething and I'll just fall asleep out\nof nowhere and I wake up next to my\ngrasshoppers or whatever and this is the\nthing like it's really hard and it's\nreally annoying\nI've tried to have housemates because I\nchoked on my food a lot and if nobody's\nhere when that happens really badly I\nmight not be here anymore\nbut the thing is whenever I get\nflatmates it goes bad like people hit on\nme a lot I have to harm you as in like I\nI'm scared of sounding very vain um I\ndon't necessarily consider myself\nparticularly attractive person but\neveryone I ever live with ends up\ngetting weird and like stealing my\nunderwear or secretly filming me or\ntrying to coerce me into things and it\nhappens even if they're female and I've\nbeen trying to figure out what the\nproblem is and not really getting that\none right so I live on my own now and\nyeah it's risky can I jump in with a\nwhat the [ __ ] I know I mean a quick I\nknow it's annoying but yeah you have no\nidea the things the things the things\nrecently so I had four or five friends\nI'd read a second time but what the [ __ ]\nit eat it yeah I know but what key do\npeople just steal your like your\nflatmates steal your underwear that's a\nroutine occurrence for your flatmates\nit's happened with multiples that means\nyes and friends and is there something\nthat we just don't understand about your\nunderwear\n[Laughter]\nif so then it's something I'd also don't\nunderstand about my underwear this is\nlike like this is like the bathwater\nthing like I just don't understand some\nof these things but maybe there's\nsomething that we don't get about what\nis happening right now but yeah that's\nreally bizarre my best guess is\npheromones is all like that's my best\nguess that's actually a damn good guess\ninteresting okay sorry to derail you I\njust I could I literally could not\nlisten to the rest of what you were\nsaying because my mind had a great big\nwhat the [ __ ] are balancing around in\nthere so I have friends who tried to\nrush to help me you genuinely tried to\nsupport me but it often goes awry one of\nmy flatmates kept cooking me food and\nthen it turned to you leaving chocolates\non my bed and then alcohol and then\ndoing loads of favours for me and then\nsecretly filming me one day I\ntransferred some he let me use his\nlaptop to transfer some files and\naccidently deleted them\nso immediately went into the recycling\nfolder and opened the first folder\nthicky I'd be the one that was most\nrecently deleted right no it was a\nmotivational it was a fotomat motivation\nwith just the loads of pictures of me\nthat he taken of various social media\nwith my ex-boyfriend cropped out of them\nand I was ah this might be time to run\nbut like it got creepy I know you feel\nwhen you open that\nyou\nlike it's happened to me a few times\nthey're like I just feel this gut\nsinking um not again and it becomes a\ndangerous situation and uh I have this\nto contend with whilst trying to run my\nlife and keep up with everything and\njust try to stay well and yeah it just\nputs a lot of strain on me when that\nhappened I stopped coming home for like\na month I just went out and did rescue\nwork and stayed in my office working and\njust got really busy and just avoided\nthe house because that got really bad at\none point he said that if I ever got a\nboyfriend he'd make me homeless so yeah\nI kind of feel like I'd end up in these\nsituations a lot\nI keep everyone goes why do you what\nkind of people are you hanging out with\nand they just blame me but my friends\nhang out with these people too and don't\nsee it coming and always think that\nthey're nice people and that everything\nwill be fine\nsome people say I should hang out with\nwomen but one of the worst cases of this\never happening to me was a woman and it\nwas this year so like I I don't know I\ndon't know what to do about it but\nfriendships are difficult for me because\nso many of them go weird like that and\nso I end up on my own and struggling and\nlots of people are like why don't you\nask me for help and it's like because\nI'm afraid everyone I pulled closer\neveryone I spent time with a lot tends\nto get strange and so I am coping with\nthis alone and it can get a bit\noverwhelming and very busy\nI'll have 30 or 40 things on my list I\ncan see why you spent so much time with\nanimals right but yeah I think my mom my\nmom is another part of it all like she\nhas a lot of illnesses going on we\nfought for 20 years to get a diagnosis\nbecause she was progressively getting\nmore ill she would put her hand up to\nhelp me cross the road when I was little\nand just walk us out in front of a car\nnot because she wanted us to come to\nharm but because she'd have absences\nshe'd constantly burn food and nearly\nburned the house down she'd flood the\nhouse trying to run herself a bath and\nin the end I just ended up taking care\nof a lot of stuff when I was really\nlittle because to not do so it was\npretty dangerous\nto leave it up to my mom was pretty\ndangerous my dad was a bit I don't know\nout of it and not really there much and\nto be honest I'm kind of glad he went to\nhold my hand across the road and another\ncross the road story and he still had a\ncigarette in my hand and I have a little\nbone in my hand because he just\naccidentally bite me he was a bit\nabsent-minded not because there's\nanything he wasn't ill or anything\nhe's just absent-minded so to be honest\nI was happier looking after my mom and\nyeah that's where I stayed without the\nto well after they split and yeah I've\nbeen looking after her it's been pretty\nintense the doctors weren't sure what\nwas wrong with her they suspected\nsomething neurological at one point they\nsaid that she might not have long to\nlive and that all of the symptoms were\nindicating something very serious and\nperform and nose took some brain scans\nand then just didn't tell her what was\ngoing on for like months and during that\ntime it was really difficult because we\ndidn't know how long we were she was\ngonna be around she they just she kept\ngoing in they didn't leave her and she\nended up with a tumor so large and\nattached to so many organs that removing\nit would cause more symptoms than\nleaving it now and she had a disease for\nso long that it caused brain and organ\ndamage alongside that that could have\nbeen cured with a bit of medication\nwithin a week of her getting it and\nshe'd have been fine\nhe said jammer yeah I think\nit's it's I guess humor is a kind of\nvery dramatic word but what's the thing\nwhat was the thing\nfibroids endometriosis there we go I\ndon't mean to say yeah so it's grown and\ngrown and grown off her womb and just\nconnected everything in inside her and\nthe only way to remove it now would be\nto remove several other organs so not\nworth that anymore\nbut the side effects of it being there\nare quite bad she yeah she's in a lot of\npain she's barely out of bed it's pretty\nserious now and there's nothing we can\ndo\nso yeah those two things and trying to\npush for diagnosis her constantly\nreporting pain we constantly go into the\nhospital with her going to the doctors\nwith her having some really awful events\nI remember when I was little I stood in\nthe corner of the room while the\nparamedics resuscitated her and there\nwas just nothing I could do and there\nwas one of the one of the medics was\njust looking making me look at him\ninstead of my mom and just talking to me\nand just keeping me talking because he\nobviously didn't if it was gonna be her\nlast moments and want me to watch her\ndie so yeah it's been a struggle and\nscary because the main foundation of my\nlife the most constant human I have in\nmy life every day I don't know whether\nshe's still gonna be here and that's\nbeen the case for so long and it's a\nreally precarious place to be\nbecause everyone else around me comes\nand goes and sometimes because of really\nbad things I mean one of my best friends\nbecame a stalker he yeah he he assaulted\nme he slept in my back garden he watched\nthe house he chased me whenever I left\nthe house some people heard from a shop\nhad to intervene and hold him down\nbecause he just yeah so basically the\nonly person I have in my life is someone\nI don't know how how long I'll I'll get\nto have and it's it's scary and but I I\nfeel bad as well because I'm so busy\ntaking care of so many animals and\ntrying to keep up with everything that\nsometimes I'm rushed with her and I'm\nlike hi okay I'll do all the things bye\nand I feel so bad because I wanna you\nknow I wanna have these conversations I\nwant to sit with her I want to spend\nmore time with her I do whenever I can\nbut whenever it's rushed I feel terrible\nbecause I don't know you know is mom\ngonna be okay next week is this gonna be\nmy last week and what do I get a female\nso I get a few more years what what's\ngonna happen hmm\nso what's that what's it what's that\nlike most the time I don't think about\nit\num and I just take each day so I think\nyou're very good at yeah I just feel\nlike worrying about it won't change\nwhether or not it happens it just mean I\nsuffered twice so I just focus on being\ngrateful for the moments I do yet\ninstead of brought you about the moments\nI might not get\nyeah it also says I mean that also\nsounds like something that you're good\nat which is that you don't really let\nyourself feel certain things because\nthere's no utility to them sure but you\nmight start to think that I I maybe bury\nthese emotions that maybe that they're\ncausing a lot of havoc but being\nunaddressed because that's usually how\npeople don't do those emotions is that\nthey just don't acknowledge that they're\nthere a lot of people who don't think\nthey're particularly emotional are\nusually emotional wrecks who just can't\nsee their emotions rather than them not\nbeing there but with me genuinely I just\nhave this thing where I can just be like\nnow I'm just invest my energy and my\nthoughts into you other ways of feeling\nand processing like genuinely I I don't\nhave like some some like I don't know\nhow to describe it like unseen sadness\nabout the situation I really I just feel\nlucky that mom is here today sure it\nsounds like you're I mean I'm getting a\nlot of genuine gratitude from you I'm\nkind of curious Anita how would you know\nwhether they're doing what you're doing\nor whether they're the emotional wreck\nis just buried deeper how can you tell\nthe difference\nI guess because I have repressed\nemotions in the past and I it comes with\na very specific since sensation and feel\nokay so if so that's how you know you're\nnot doing it so you you cuz you're\nsaying basically I know what suppressed\nemotions feel like and I used to do that\nI've learned now not to do it and it\nsounds to me like you're practicing some\namount of detachment as opposed to\nsuppression like you acknowledge the\nemotion you recognize it's there and\nthen you sit with it for a little bit\nand then you kind of choose to focus on\nother things which is not quite like\ndenial right it's sort of like\nacknowledgment but separation as opposed\nto like sticking it in the basement and\npretending like it doesn't exist yeah I\nmean\nyeah so and recent recent recent oh can\nyou see that behind me can you see my\nrabbit just like I saw someone move\nyeah I'll be right back he destroys\nwives so I have to address that right\naway\nhello buddy are you\n[Music]\nthanks for waiting sure I think they\nwant to see the rabbit but oh I can grab\nhim if you like he's only in the kitchen\nhe's in the next room it doesn't mind\nyeah again\nyou\nyou\noh wow that's a big rabbit no I'm just\nsmall everyone says that he's actually\nquite a small species of rabbit I'm only\n5 foot 2 you so everything looks big\nlike sometimes I'll lift up a\nnormal-sized Cup and people like where\ncan I get that giant cup from the rabbit\nis a boy rabbit or a girl rabbit he's a\nhe I actually so I spotted him in a\nrescue centre up country and being a\nfriend traveled all day to go and get\nhim umm I thought he'd make a really\ngood husband for my lonely girl because\nher partner died and I didn't think that\nshe should have to live alone so we're\nnot to get him thinking that you're on\nlike a house on fire but they don't\nreally like each other so I'm still I've\nbeen working on it for a year trying to\nget them to love one another and it's a\nreally hard matchmaking process I can\nimagine I can imagine that some of your\nformer roommates feel the same way was\nthat out of line I'm sorry was that a\ndick thing to say no it's I'm so my mind\nis still bottled by the pheromones and\npeople sniff me a lot like in public and\neverything [ __ ] yeah they sniff you and\npop mm-hmm\nso like it would be like I have a friend\nwe're not attracted to each other\nwhatsoever one time we got really really\ndrunk and we all just fell asleep in a\nline adjacent on the sofa watch miss me\nemailing like um there'll be situations\nwhere like I'll wake up to someone\nasleep humping me like with their\nclothes on and I'm just like god damn\npheromones and I'll just get up and move\naway like I get all of these sorts of\nsituations all the time and it's so\nannoying\nbut yeah like people sniff me people\nstalk me people get weird and yeah\nbasically it's it's a whole thing like I\nhave thousands of stories I just don't\nknow what to do with it anymore how do\nyou understand why this happens to you I\ndon't understand why this happens to me\nI don't understand why I just understand\nthat it does and that you know I've just\ngrown exasperated with it honestly\nso it does sound quite exhausting I'm\ncurious do you have any other emotions\nthat come up when you find people have\nbeen stealing your underwear or stocking\nyou or anything like that\nbesides exasperation no this point I\njust feel tired because I don't want to\npresume that it's gonna happen again\nit feels vain to presume that every\nsingle person that I ever make friends\nwith is just gonna fall in love with me\nand turn into a menace and so I always\ngive people the chance and I always give\npeople the benefit of the doubt and you\nknow assume that it's gonna be different\nthis time and I always give this speech\nfrom like I am not attracted to my\nfriends I am very obvious with my\nemotions if I'm attracted to someone I\nwill let them know I hate people who\ncome on to me without me giving any\nsigns so I've had to dump a lot of\nfriends because of this and you know\nit's kind of like this big warning\nstatement it's kind of like a subtle if\nyou hit on me I'm gonna run away kind of\nsituation because I I'm so used to it\nnow and it doesn't work the statement\ndoesn't work no hmm I mean it's it's\njust like this background noise till the\nother trouble I have is that I'd like to\nhave friendships that don't end in\ndisaster\nI mean I'm one of my friends assaulted\nme there was a witness\nunfortunately somebody else watched it\nhappen and he was also a friend and he\ndid nothing I tried to go to the police\nand police did nothing in fact I had to\nreport him for several other things that\nwere relatively minor by comparison for\nexample you know sleeping in my back\ngarden chasing me around following me\neverywhere and constantly trying to DOX\nme on stream this sort of thing but then\nafter they found out my view account and\nhow many people knew that the police\nwere failing me\nthen they took action but he's still\nfree he's been charged but he's still\nfree and yeah he still harasses me\nonline from time to time and I'm pretty\nsure he probably will come back to the\nhouse again at some point because he\nalways does so yeah but he's what do\nthey see in you I don't know genuinely\ndon't know it's not like I'm a pretty\naverage\nperson in most respects I'm not like\nsome supermodel that's just irresistible\nso I genuinely don't know why this keeps\nhappening well there's something about\nyou that clearly is irresistible\nlike literally like ears like not just\nlike their I mean like it's it sounds\nlike people I can't stay away and sort\nof it doesn't I mean it's strange right\nbecause these are people that are able\nto have normal relationships with some\nof your other friends but there's\nsomething different pheromones that that\nyou know and you're kind of saying that\nlike your friends are sort of like oh\nyou know they think that everything's\ngonna be okay but they don't really\nunderstand it like it's just a strange\npattern then yeah\ndo you have any idea I don't I've been\ntrying to figure it out because I just\nwant it to stop\nI uh you have no idea like I've had\nfemale friends uh I've had female\nfriends you've done this to meet you um\nI've had like I've got like three female\nfriends who send me drunk messages well\nthey come on to me and then apologized\nthe next morning and I'm just like I'd\nlove to hang out with you but you know I\ndon't want to another thing that I have\nto start reporting to the police or any\nmore drama and stuff and like I doesn't\nmatter I tried to watch for the pattern\nin life am i spending too much time with\nlonely people but they could be really\ndiverse they can be really outgoing and\nhave lots of friends and it still\nhappens they can be really popular and\nit's happens they can have lots of\nreally attractive friends to hit on and\nthey still hit on me I can set up\nboundaries and be really clear and\nthey'll still do it\nI I get blamed as well people are like\nwhat like what are you doing they act\nlike it's my fault like I go why do you\nhang out with strange people and it's\nlike\nOh Anita I'm gonna say something that\nmay sound like blaming you but but\nplease listen carefully I know it sounds\nweird but so here's here's what I'm\nhearing from you okay and it's weird so\nyou've looked for patterns a smart thing\nto do like is it something about the\nplay the way I find my roommates am I am\nI on the wrong part of Craigslist where\nI'm looking\ninstead of like looking for roommates\nI'm like looking for love am i posting\nin the wrong area you know and the\ninteresting thing is that like if we\nthink about it logically and you know it\nseems to be independent of gender it\nseems that these people are able to have\nnormal relationships with other people\nit seems to be that it's not like a\nparticular ethnicity or like you know\nand there isn't some kind of\noverwhelming physical attractiveness or\nsomething like that then then I mean if\nit's not a factor with them which is\ninterestingly enough that's what you've\nbeen saying right is there's no pattern\nin terms of how I'm selecting people\nthen that sort of suggests that it's\nsomething with you and I'm not trying to\nblame you I'm just saying like the the\ncase that you're making is a really\nstrong one that it's something with you\nright that there is something and it's\ninteresting because I asked you earlier\nlike why do people you know steal your\nunderwear and you were saying like\npheromone it's like that's not a them\nfactor that's a you factor it's um a\npheromone is sort of like I wonder if so\nI wonder if it's actually bear moans\nright which would be interesting because\nif you can get multiple women unclear\nwhat their sexual preferences or sexual\norientation is but be especially\ninteresting if they were actually\nheterosexual and they drunkenly message\nyou two of them ah yeah so so so how do\nwe like that's weird\nright like so then I'm not blaming you\nbut at the same time I'm saying that it\nseems like you know the common element\ndoesn't have anything to do with them it\nhas something to do with you mm-hmm but\nthen like I tried changing my approach\nthere are some people who I've never met\nin person - I barely speak to you sure I\nthink you've tried changing the things\nthat you're aware of\nhmm right so like the question is what\nare the things that you do that you're\nnot aware of and that's a hard question\nto answer because how are you supposed\nto know if you're not aware of them okay\nfair so let me ask you something Anita\ndo you feel like like I guess a big\nsense of stuckness from you I get a\nsense that like you're kind of [ __ ]\neither way like you know either you\nstart taking it like you can't stop\nworking because then you're gonna feel\nguilty and letting like you know letting\npeople down and the emotions will\noverwhelm you but you can't keep working\nbecause then you're gonna be burnt out\nand you're not gonna be able to sleep\nand things like that it's like damned if\nyou do damned if you don't that's like a\ntheme that I'm hearing it like even when\nit comes to your mom it's like you can\ntry to spend more time with her you can\ntry to not spend more time with her like\neither one sort of doesn't work that\nshe's really ill and she needs her\nsupport and she may be gone tomorrow and\nI mean it's it's kind of like there's\nlike nothing you can do and we hear I\nhear that as well from from kind of you\nknow rebates it's like you try to have\nfriends and then it's like panty\nsniffing backyard parties and then or\nyou're by yourself and then if you're by\nyourself it's like you're gonna choke on\nfood and you're actually like you could\ndie it's like damned if you do damned if\nyou don't\nlike if there's one thing there that I'm\nhearing from you it's like I don't see\nhow you can make a choice because no\nchoice is good does that make sense yeah\num I've chosen which isn't to live alone\nbecause I feel happier and safer sure I\ncan imagine I mean I actually I can't\nimagine because I've never felt the kind\nof danger that you were describing I\nactually cannot imagine I could try to\nimagine but I can't even put my head in\nyour in your head what are you feeling\nright now\n[ __ ] okay yeah yeah what are you feeling\njust sat in that down I mean\njust certain let down by my friends the\nones that have kind weird like the ones\nwho'll risk prison to like do stupid\nstuff and ruin the friendship the\nfriends that would idly watch and\npretend it's not happening until it's\ntoo late and you know just uh just how\noften this happens and just how tired I\nam and just how I just can't make sense\nof it and I feel bad even mentioning it\nbecause people don't believe me all they\nblame me and I feel like I've tried\neverything I feel like people are like\nwhat are you wearing and it's like I\ncould be wearing a full-on trench coat\nin the middle of summer just covering\nevery inch of skin I possibly can people\nstill hit on me in the street you'll\nstill get weird with me and sniff me and\nconstantly like don't let me cross the\nroad because they want to get my number\nand stuff and they're like you know\ndon't ignore me [ __ ] and all this stuff\nand I just feel like it's so hard to\ntalk about because nobody believes it\nhappens nobody believes that this is\ngoing on and I just don't know what to\ndo about it because I want to have\nfriends and I want to feel okay and I\nwant to have people that I can trust and\nsometimes I think I found people and I\nwill known them for years and it will\njust happen out of the blue and I'm just\ntired\nthat sounds really exhausting\ncan I think for a second\ndo you work with a therapist or mental\nhealth professional by the way you don't\nI used to back when I was depressed I\nused to but when I stopped feeling\ndepressed and I felt okay\nwhat do you think about seeing one again\nI don't know how they could help me\nbecause I know I make very punishing\nlists and I know I keep myself busy\nhaha I am okay mentally I think that\nsome some of these things like what\nhappened with one of my roommates and\nwhat happened wouldn't my friends\nrecently and things like that\nI don't know how I can prevent that from\nhappening except to just keep trying and\nkeep trusting people until I find the\nright ones unfortunately well so it's\nhot that's actually exactly why I think\none may be helpful because I I think\nthat we're missing some piece of the\npuzzle here hmm right because what\nyou're describing sort of just doesn't\nit doesn't compute there's like some\nvariable to the equation and maybe it's\nactually pheromones like maybe there's\nsomething about you that just drives\npeople insane because that's certainly\nwhat it sounds like now the interesting\nthing is that I think the reason to\npotentially see a therapist is for you\nto get someone get a different pair of\neyes besides your own to look at your\nsituation and see if yeah I've asked\nfriends about this people who knew the\npeople that did this to me and they've\nsaid that sometimes I'm friends with\nvery lonely people who can be very\ndesperate you don't often get as much\napproval and attention as I'm willing to\ngive them and that that seems like\nintimacy to people who don't have that\nlevel of friendship normally and that\nmaybe they take it a lot more seriously\nthan I do but I setup my boundary as I\nsay if this isn't romantic and they\nstill pursue it but also I can be very\nforgiving so limp I hope someone crosses\na boundary I don't necessarily act like\nI'm outraged immediately when I shed and\nthis means that whilst I'm processing\nwhether or not I should be angry about\nit or act out and you know kind of say\nlook stay away or anything like that\nthey've kind of said well she didn't get\nupset that's consent sort of thing and\nthey keep pushing it and pushing it and\nso I know that that's a problem but I\nalso know that a lot of the people that\nhave done this to me have also been\npeople with friends who are happy you\nhave emotional support have connections\nand so sometimes it does feel like I\ndon't know that would be that would make\nsense if it was consistently the case\nsure so so I think that's another\ninteresting example of light\nkind of like that stuckness right so\nyou're you have reasons on the pro side\nlike oh that would explain everything\nexcept dot dot dot so there's there's a\nvery kind of conflicting theme through a\nlot of what you say and it's kind of\nlike maybe it's this way but except it's\nnot and the other thing I would say just\nvery simply is that I don't know that\nfriends can provide for you the same\ndegree of support or examination that a\nlicensed professional can write because\nthey're gonna be friends and they're not\ntrained to like see patterns because I\nam curious so Anita I'm gonna ask you a\nquestion and and I understand that this\nquestion may come across as offensive um\nif it does come across as offensive\nplease let me know is there any part of\nyou that's flattered by what they do no\nno because I know that a lot of these\nguys are so lonely that if anybody else\nyou know was around that gave them the\nsame level of attention they probably do\nthe same thing like I've learnt that\nit's not you don't have to be special\nfor people to be attracted to you that\nquite often guys will especially will\njust take what they can get and it's not\nyou don't have to be beautiful or smart\nor funny for guys to just be like yeah\nI'll sleep with you you'll sleep with me\nright please sleep with me right so no\nit doesn't feel flowering it feels like\nah it feels like I want to make friends\nwith people I want to have genuine\nconnections that last and there are\nalways lonely dicks just getting in the\nway and just like I'd like do you okay\ndo you feel flattered by anything\nthat's a weird question yeah I guess\nactually comments um compliment\nsomething that I I can take credit for\nlike I'm not really I'm not really happy\nwith or don't really care about comments\nand my parents I didn't really choose my\ngenetics I did choose your why Who I am\nor my ethics or the way I go about life\nor the way that I choose to impact\nanimals and things like that so I guess\nagain I I genuinely like ah thank you\nand I weirdly I trust compliments from\nwomen more these days because I'm\nusually a little bit wary now after\neverything I've been through that you\nknow I don't know off the bat if a guy\nis hitting on me and just trying to\nbutter me up\ninitially some cautious so usually when\nlike a woman chooses to you like\ncompliment something I've chosen about\nmyself and like wow cool thank you but\nif it dudes like I like your ass I'm\njust like yeah so I'm really happy to\nhear that India because I was a I was\ngrowing a little bit concerned that\nmaybe you don't let other people\nappreciate you\n[Music]\nI have a friend he's awesome he's never\ndone anything bad\num he's a physicist and will usually get\na thermos of like a hot drink\nwe'll go and sit by the beach we'll\nwatch the sunset we'll look at the stars\nand he'll tell me loads of cool facts\nabout them because he does Astrid and he\nis genuinely very complimentary but\nhe'll compliment actual things about me\nand yeah I do the same for him and I\nreally appreciate him I think I can have\na healthy reciprocal friendships there\njust ain't incredibly rare absolutely\nand there's a little part of me that's\nhad friendships like that before for\nyears that I've turned to right so I'm\nstill slightly under guard like I'm\nscared to you like with friends like\nthat I have like a few where they have\nlike partners and stuff I won't touch\nthem I won't\nI won't hug them I won't you know what I\nmean that because I'm scared of giving\nany signals that will trigger that kind\nof behavior from like I get like some\nsome people who've taken it too far or\ngone weird because it happens out of the\nblue sometimes spontaneously\nand I don't know what causes it and I'm\njust scared and there's little things\nlike that that just really make me\nnervous now because I don't want to lose\nthe friendship and I don't know what it\nis yet and I'm just terrified of losing\npeople to this issue\nyeah I I can I can see that you know\nthere is almost like a traumatic\nparanoia there like it's like it's\nhappened to you so many times that you\nbecome so so careful that you won't even\nengage in like normal behaviors like\nhugging because you're afraid of what\nwill happen I mean that sounds really\nawful\n[Music]\nany questions for me so far\nI don't know I think what let me just\nrecenter of like where we're going on\nwhy we're going so urology about some of\nmy illnesses and challenges I've told\nyou about some of the difficulties with\nfriendships and people hitting on me\nwith your mind female\nyeah and how I feel quite isolated and\nhow I'd like to fit form bonds and have\npeople in my life\nit doesn't always pan out the way I hope\nmm-hmm so now you kind of know a lot of\nthe stuff that troubles me and I find\ndifficult about my existence yeah things\nthat I'm trying to make sense of and\ntrying to maintain some level of\nhappiness and quality of life through\nyeah so can we talk about that part now\nsure\nhow are you happy\nI think I like I used to be very\nisolated and static and nothing in my\nlife changed and now every morning I\nwake up and there's just a million\npossibilities\nand I get to have a positive impact on\nthose around me it feels powerful to be\nthe one that rewrites a story like with\nwith with him with Peter he was\nabandoned because he's a destroyer and\nhe's a destroyed a lot of my stuff um\nhe's quite angry he's a little ball of\nhate he looks adorable he's a little\nball of hate and yeah I think I'm so\nglad I got to make him happy and give\nhim treats and that he's gonna have a\ngreat quality of life he's gonna have\nall the best pet care he's gonna be okay\nnow even though the first people to love\nhim don't anymore\nand I get to you know I get to talk to\nloads of people online I get messages\nfrom people who are struggling I get\nmessages from people who've taken stuff\nfrom my stream and my coping mechanisms\nwe're living a better life now and they\ntalk through what they've taken from it\nand you know I get to I get to change\nthings for people and I get to make sure\nmy mom's okay and I get to see a lot of\npositivity in the world and I get to be\na part of a lot of positivity in the\nworld I guess laughs I get to have a few\ndrinks and like an pikas with my friends\nsometimes when I get the time and even\nthough that's not as often as it used to\nbe I feel really privileged to have\npeople in my life and to smile at them\nand to just like enjoy these moments and\nI kind of feel like if I wait for\neverything to be perfect before I can be\nhappy I'll never be happy and there\nthere's always gonna be stuff I'm not\nhappy with there's always gonna be\nsomething to be dissatisfied with we're\nnot meant to be satisfied and I can keep\non improving my life but that doesn't\nmean that I'm blind to all the beauty in\nit um and yeah I think to be honest even\nsuffering suffering is a privilege\nbecause ah I get a short moment of life\nI get a short moment to exist and then\nI'm gone and for most of the existence\nof the universe I haven't been here and\nwon't be here so for the brief time that\ngets seen hear and feel and think and be\nI feel really honored to have that even\nif not everything about it feels awesome\neverything about it is awesome but kia's\nexperiencing stuff is a privilege and I\nremember that every day and I feel\nreally really really lucky\nto exist and I really really feel\npassionate about leaving the world a\nbetter place the one I found it and I\nget to do that every day I don't know\nhow long I have but every day at the end\nof the day I know I've chipped away at\nthat goal I guess and I know that I've\nI've kind of not just justified being\nbut really loved the chance to be and\nyeah if I die tomorrow I'm really glad\nthat I did everything I did because I I\ndevoted a lot of my time and energy and\nmy power to influence the world to do\nthings that I'm genuinely proud to have\nbeen a part of and I have a lot of\nreally great memories um so yeah I feel\ngood I like life life is awesome even if\nin order to enjoy it you have to have\nsome downside sometimes and maybe I'll\nfigure out how to make friends with\npeople who don't want to meet with me\nbut maybe that's the thing that will\nhappen I'm still figuring it out I've\ntried a lot of approaches so far I'll\nchip at it and for the friends that I do\nyou have the handful that have stayed\nand not done anything like that so\ngrateful for them I'm scared but\ngrateful and um yeah and like I have\nthis overall philosophy overall with the\nwhole existence of the universe you know\nbeing the lens through which the\nuniverse observes itself stuff which I\ntalk about a lot on stream but there's\nalso like an underlying I know what I\nexist I know the things that make me\nglad to exist I know the things that\nfeel good about having lived that I can\ndo daily and monthly and yearly\ndepending on how long they take that\nmake me grateful and satisfied and I\nbuild like I found stuff that is like ah\nlike a bucket like I like drops in a\nbucket that fill and stay instead of\nconstantly dripping away so many\nbeautiful energy yeah well thank you um\nI don't I I don't remember anything of\nwhat I just said cuz I'm tired so I\ndon't know which part was an analogy but\ncool um there was a the thing is I used\nto I used to find happiness and things\nthat used to drip away and a lot of\npeople do that like when you buy stuff\nlike you buy a thing and you have the\nthing and you're like cool and then you\njust want to buy another thing it\ndoesn't really make you happy and it\nwon't matter like when you die no one's\ngonna remember that you had those shoes\nno one's gonna remember your opinion\naren't drop like that stuff's going\ntrip away and it probably drove away day\nyear you probably won't remember what\nshoes you had a couple of years ago so\nbasically a lot of people reach for\nhappiness and treat themselves to things\nthat don't really build and satisfy\nthey're just kind of like a stopgap and\nI found stuff that genuinely sits Joe\nnot only is there how they how do you\nfind stuff that genuinely says\nhow do you know which drop it drops stay\nin your bucket and which ones drip away\nfirst\nso\nI remember when I had at their best we\nused to talk about this I used to have a\nlot of stuff that I would do but it\nwouldn't keep me happy and I'd have to\nconstantly be running and constantly\ndoing it over and over again to feel any\nsemblance of okayness and then I started\ndoing the things that I felt I couldn't\nhelp but do things that if no one paid\nme I'd still be doing if it hurt I'd\nstill be doing the stuff that I can't\nhelp that do and I started allowing\nmyself to give time to doing that more\nthan everything else I used to just run\naround looking after my mom and kind of\nchasing after my ex and just making sure\nhe was okay and and attending to\neveryone else's needs when I wanted to\ngo and do volunteering and I wanted to\nlook after animals and I wanted to go\nand I wanted to read books I wanted to\neducate myself and this sort of thing\nand that's the kind of stuff that stayed\nand that I loved but I wasn't allowing\nmyself to invest in so when I actually\njust let my urges free and just did\nexactly what I wanted\nI gained experiences that I remember for\nthe rest of my life and connections I\nremember for the rest of my life even if\nthey don't turn out awesomely in the end\nlike I still feel really lucky about the\nfriends that I hang out with I have fond\nmemories of the guy who assaulted me I'm\nglad I met him I'm glad he gave me a\nchance to laugh and a chance to you\nlearn and stuff and I'm sad it's over\nbut I'm not going to define our\nfriendship by the way that it ended I'm\ngonna define it by all the things I was\nlucky to experience you see so I guess\nit was worth reaching out and risking it\neven though I'm really scared of people\nthese days sorry I didn't mean to start\nlaughing but it just occurred to me but\nmaybe that's the pheromones would you\njust hear are you talking about this\nstalker and how you can appreciate\npeople and appreciate your friendship\ndespite the way that it ended that\nsounds intoxicating to have someone in\nyour life who like treats you that way\nlike I could imagine that people are\ndrawn to that non-judgmental acceptance\nand gratitude and appreciation for life\nlike a moth drawn to a flame because\nthat is that's rare\nright and either like most people who\nget stalked\nhave difficulty appreciating parts of\nthe relationship and expressing\ngratitude towards the relationship\nbefore people got crazy right\n[Music]\nI hate how I hate how right you are\nbecause like one thing that is\nconsistent that my friends say that I\ncan't really deny is that I'm very\nforgiving\nlike I have this thing where man\nso like when people [ __ ] up I'm like\nyeah I'll make mistakes to you someday\nand if I want to deserve forgiveness\nI'll I'm gonna be understanding\nempathetic and you're going through this\nright now and this was going through\nyour head and I understand that just\nlike you to stop and I'm really like\ngentle and forgiving I mean he did a lot\nof stuff that built up to the assault\nthat people kind of be like well why\ndidn't you just cut it off there and I\nwas like jeez I was okay and you know\npeople make mistakes and yeah I think\nit's the fact that I'm very forgiving\nthat may be a pretty consistent\ncomponent in this because I'm thinking\nback to all the people all the extreme\nexamples there was a girl who literally\nseduced and slept with everyone around\nme and sent nudes to them and all sorts\nbecause she wanted to get closer to me\nlike the minute anyone appeared on\nstream with me or whatever suddenly she\nwas their best friend and she'd be\ntrying to move in with them or whatever\nright and yeah it got to the point when\nshe broke a lot of hearts and really\nupset a lot of people and in the end I\nwas just like wow you've caused a trail\nof devastation here lady um and she just\nwould not stop hitting on me over and\nover and over and I said no but I was\nforgiving and then she drunk text me and\nshe'd say this and she'd do that and I'd\nbe like no but I forgive you it's cool\nthen she'd be like I'm so sorry it's\nokay it's okay I understand you sorry\nI'm sure it won't happen again\nand then she'd do it again and I'd be\nforgiving and then like my friend would\nhave a broken why are you so forgiving\nyou don't know\nokay yeah\nso can we go can I share a couple\nthoughts with you yeah some of them I\nhope will be helpful to people some of\nthem may be a little bit concerning if\nthat's okay\nyeah so I see a couple patterns here\nthat that I think it's worth your walk\nyour time to explore but let's start\nwith this so what we were talking about\nhow you were able to be happy despite\nall of this stuff I think that that is\namazing\nlike that kind of free association\nspeech rant about how to view the world\nis like absolutely beautiful Mita and I\nthink there's there a couple of\nsubtleties there and my favorite\nsubtlety is you always use the verb get\nto when you talk about yourself which is\nit it's like it's a little subtle it's\nlike a subtle thing but like you use\nthat you use the verb get like I get to\ndot dot dot I get to dot dot dot I get\nto dot dot write like I get to\nappreciate this I get to do this I get\nto do this I get to do this I get to do\nthis and so there's there's just a lot\nof gratitude like baked in to the way\nthat you look in the world it the world\nwhich i think is a key thing because\nhappiness would this says that happiness\nis not about like circumstances it's\nabout mindset it's about detachment it's\nabout being able to appreciate as\nopposed to expect\nso expectation leads to suffering and\nlike a lack of expectation is what leads\nto happiness and if we hear your words\nit's kind of interesting because I've\nnever heard someone who expects a lot\nsay I get to because get to sounds like\na privilege right it sounds like\nsomething extra that you get to do it's\nnot that like you're entitled to do it\nlike I don't I'm allowed to sit in this\nchair it's my right to sit in this chair\nand nowadays we tend to be I'm not\nsaying that this is negative I'm just\nsaying it's an\nkind of consequence that I never\nrealized when we think about rights\nright rights are about entitlement and\nrights are about expectations and I\nthink rights are a good thing but\nthere's like a big difference between\nbeing entitled to do something and\ngetting to do something and getting to\ndo something is about appreciation and\nwhat I really hear from you is that\ndespite all of the terrible things in\nyour life you have genuinely found the\ncapacity to appreciate the good I think\nthere's also a lot of like other really\nimportant stuff in there I loved your\nanalogy about like fine like drops of\nhappiness that drip away versus drops of\nhappiness that stay in your bucket and\nsomewhere along the way that you kind of\nstarted gravitating towards things that\nyou find fulfilling is opposed to things\nthat bring you like temporary or\nmaterialistic happiness you you have a\nvery interesting I mean your language is\njust really interesting because you also\nuse words like allow you allowed\nyourself to start to do things that like\nyou cared about as opposed to doing the\nthings that you were supposed to do and\nand that also is kind of weird because\neven the things that you allow yourself\nto do or things that are like giving\nthings which we'll get to in a second\nbut and I really do think that it's been\nfascinating for me to hear and I hope\npeople can kind of take away with\nsomething I think there's an another\nbaby conversation that needs to be had\nor exploration into like how were you\nable to do that right because at some\npoint you were chasing materialistic\nthings or you were chasing temporary\nhappiness and then you said that I\nallowed myself to start to invest in\nthings that like I should do you know\nfor the betterment of the world and\nthings like that and so how did you do\nthat how did you be to prep how are you\ndepressed for 13 years and like what\nturned it around for you now I don't\nknow if that's a short conversation or a\nlong conversation if that's something\nyou can like touch on for a few minutes\nI think that would be fantastic but then\nI do have a couple of other things that\nI'd like to share with you sure if you\nwant to know how I got out of my\ndepression I think it was a lot of\nthings a lot of steps but\nif I'd open it as quickly as I could it\nwould be in the beginnings of my life I\ndidn't know I deserved respect I excused\nthe behavior of the people around me by\nexplaining it away and that was\nimportant to me because I took it list\npersonally when I understood it it's not\nbecause of me it's because of their\nupbringing it's because of their issues\nit's because of their this and\nunderstanding psychology and researching\nthe way that people respond to trauma\nhelped me to feel less flawed and\ndeserving of the aggression and\nmistreatment but I endured when I was\nyounger and that helped me until it\nstarted become an excuse to allow abuse\nwhat I didn't then process until much\nlater was that it's okay to expect\nrespect I didn't even know what that\nlooked like I didn't know what it felt\nlike to be cared about and prioritized\nand loved and so I ended up in a\nsituation of really extreme domestic\nviolence and I was drinking to cope with\nit every day\nweirdly I thought I maybe what hap was\nan alcoholic or something but then as\nsoon as I moved out I didn't drink like\nI didn't I didn't even notice that I\ndidn't pick up anything and from there I\nstill had a lot of ways to go but I was\nstarting to build a better and more\nbeautiful an environment where I could\nthrive and discover who I was and then I\nhad a lot of time throughout that whole\nsituation to sit and listen to myself so\nas soon as I had like a tiny little inch\nof movement to be free to do what I want\ninstead of what other people wanted me\nto do for them because I'm basically\ngrown up being a servant in a lot of\nways I didn't know what it was to has\nthat changed\nI don't know yet I am happier but yeah\nlike I started to notice all of these\nthings so I started building a better\nenvironment I was offered\nantidepressants especially after a\nsuicide attempt\nI didn't survive because I failed I\nsurvived because someone busted the door\ndown and intervened and so I didn't\nexactly feel grateful to live it wasn't\na second thought thing it wasn't a\nchoice it was a I didn't I didn't\nsucceed kind of situation and I in that\nin that situation I needed to get out I\nneeded to fix my environment and when\nthey offered me an expression I was like\nI don't feel like this is a problem with\nmy neuro chemistry I feel like this is a\nproblem with my surroundings and I'd\nlike to change those first so I went\nrunning to help with the neurochemical\nside of things and I started fixing my\nlife and getting to safety and when I\ndid I started to expand into that little\nbit of extra freedom and yeah from there\nI guess the next part was just thinking\nabout the philosophical part of it and\nwhy I should want to live I needed to\nhave a reason so I started thinking\nabout what mattered to me and what was\nbeautiful about life and that's where\nthe kind kind of like universe kind of\ntheory stuff came from and that helped\nme to have like a little bit of a\nfoundation and a backbone and then the\nnext part was what will I be glad I did\nhere from now like if I look back a year\nfrom now in the future future me what\nwill I be glad I did what will I regret\nwasting time on and I started\nprioritizing according to the stuff that\nwould consistently make me satisfied\nlong term and when I started imagining a\nlife in the future where I was happy it\nhad animals had stability safety and all\nthese sorts of things so just by being\nlike picturing myself happy\nI knew the direction I had to go in and\nI built all these things I'm safe now\nand I'm happy and I have animals and I\nhave computer games breakfast and I have\nI have all of the things that allow me\nto thrive and have choices and another\nthing I think the final thing is to stop\ntrying to manipulate the world to be\nwhat I want it to be I don't have\nawesome plans anymore I go with the flow\nI take what the universe hands me\nI take what Kaos throws up my feet and I\nbuild the best of it there are people\nwho get handed [ __ ] in life and they cry\nbecause they've got [ __ ] on their hands\nand there are people who make it into\nbricks and build [ __ ] houses and I\nwant to be the second kind I want to be\nthe kind of person who could be handed\nanything and see it as an opportunity\nsince then I've been incredibly happy\nand surprised by all the ve that's come\nmy way okay beautiful anything so can I\nhighlight a couple things that I heard\nthere No get out yeah go for it so the\nfirst is that like I think it starts\nwith listening to yourself right so I\nthink that this is something that people\nneed to understand is that we're taught\nand this kind of goes back to the idea\nthat people with privilege can't suffer\nin that people who are in in black\nprivilege can't be happy and and I think\nthat the the interesting thing is that\nlike a lot of times when I work with\npeople they assume that a particular\nthing is going to bring them happiness\nand the interesting thing is that since\nthey don't have it like like a good\nexample is like let's say there's a guy\nwho's never had so I used to be this way\nwhere like I had never really had a\nserious and loving relationship and I\nthought what I needed to be happy was a\nserious and loving relationship and the\ninteresting thing though is that that's\nnot something that comes from me that's\nsomething that comes from watching other\npeople so it's not actually listening to\nmyself it's making assumptions about\nwhat the road to happiness looks like\nbased on what I see outside of myself\nbecause if you think that a million\nbeing a millionaire is gonna make you\nhappy and you aren't a millionaire then\nlike you're not basing that on yourself\nyou're basing it on the outside world\nyeah and I and we'll go get two I mean I\ndo think a loving relationship goes a\nlong way and we'll get to that in a\nsecond but the first thing is that you\nknow I was listening to your story and\nit sort of started with listening to\nyourself\nit started with getting a little bit of\nspace and listening to that voice inside\nyou and following that direction even in\nthe smallest way and then you got a\nlittle bit more space you listened to it\nmore and so on and so forth I think you\nalso mentioned something like so about\nthe power of environment and the people\naround you\nI think so many people do not understand\nhow much of the way they feel has so\nmuch to do with things that are given\naround them like if you live in a toxic\nhome with abusive parents and you think\nthat there's no way that you're gonna be\nbetter and the we get this a lot that\ndr. K is the only one that can save you\nyou would be surprised how little dr. K\nmatters compared to like getting the\n[ __ ] out of like your current living\nsituation with abusive people it can be\nlike night and day there are so many\nthings about the environment the soil\nthat you you put yourself in and like\nthe air that you put yourself in in the\nsunlight that you put yourself in and\nthe water that you put yourself in that\nwill allow you to grow into a different\nperson\nyeah and so I think that that you were\nable to really make a couple of serious\nsteps forward that were sort of like\nmeant like in a sense mental health\nrelated it sounds like you were in a\ndangerous and traumatic relationship\nwhich you've got the [ __ ] out of it also\nsounds like you saw a trauma therapist\nwho helped you kind of work through\nthese things which is awesome and then\nsomewhere along the way you started to\nlike channel this like universe but\nEastern Western whatever like this sort\nof truth about take what is given to you\nstart to appreciate life and all this\n[ __ ] that everyone wants to learn how to\ndo but no one knows how do you learn how\nto do that and I think the really\ngrateful thing I'm grateful to you Anita\nbecause you've given us like the story\nof like how that happens and I think\nthere were a couple of key things about\nbasically listening to yourself changing\na couple circumstances really like\nthinking about the way that you see the\nworld there's a lot of self-reflection\nand growth as opposed to a playbook that\nyou follow and I think unfortunately\nthat's what I've found is that like\neveryone has to walk this journey on\ntheir own there's no no one can give\nthese answers to you you have to figure\nthem out yourself but we can sort of get\na guide book as to how to figure them\nout yourself which starts with things\nlike listening to yourself okay thoughts\nquestions can I move on to part two can\nI just take it no I I feel like I need\nto say this out loud because I\nremember things better when I see them\nbut so this conversation is kind of\nmaking me feel like I'm being a bit\ngreedy I feel like we've touched on them\nthat I'm a bit too busy I think in\naspect but I haven't really acknowledged\nabout it is that I don't have enough\ntime to be all the things I want to be\nand I just I'm not allowing myself to\nsettle for a few and do them well I'm\ntrying to do everything oh yeah yeah\nthat's part two so we're gonna we're\ngonna talk about that right now so Anita\nI think you're an amazing person and I\nstill think there are some things about\nyou that my hope is that you can get to\na place of even more peace like I think\nyou've attained a lot of happiness\ndespite your circumstances and even some\nof your internal conflicts and my hope\nis that some of those internal conflicts\ncan even become a little bit easier on\nyou and let me share with you what I\nmean so like the first thing is like you\njust said it right despite all of this\nyou feel greedy sometimes you feel\nguilty sometimes you put yourself in\ndanger sometimes you you feel burnt out\num and I think there are like reasons\nfor that like I think there are things\nthat you can still look at in your life\nin ways that you can reflect and grow\nand and maybe therapy is a part of this\nmaybe not where you don't have to be as\nburdened as you are but I think that's\ngonna be tough and I'm gonna just start\ntalking so I think you've got to be\ncareful about I want to be the kind of\nperson that dot dot dot so underneath a\nlot of this I think that there's a lot\nof genuine growth and appreciation but\nthere's also like I'm getting some\nundertones and this may be wrong okay\nabout like you really force yourself\ninto a particular kind of view of like\nwhat's acceptable for you like I want to\nbe the kind of person because if I ask\nmyself like who the [ __ ] is so forgiving\nlike and and I wonder if if somewhere in\nthere is that like you want to be the\nkind of person who can be forgiving and\nso you become the kind of person who's\nforgiving even though maybe you\nshouldn't be so\nforgiving but it's almost like you hold\na standard for yourself that's so high\nthat you don't allow yourself to like\nhold negative qualities what do you\nthink about that\ncan I just think for a second\nit feels like with the forgiving thing\nin particular it's not so much a\nstandard that I'm trying to\ncookie-cutter fit into you I'm not\ncontorting myself out of my own rage I\nthink it comes from a position of\nempathy I kind of feel like I was late\nto the social scene I was socially\nawkward and dumb luckily I didn't have\nsocial media at the time so no one can\nhold some like ancient tweets against me\nor whatever but I was not I was clueless\nand I needed to be forgiven to have the\nchance to grow and learn to be fun to\nhang around I needed the chance to be\nable to see what a good friend is and\nreceive friendship and connection before\nI could be a good friend and and connect\nand so I really relate to people who are\nmessing up I really relate to people\nhere come to me and they bungle our\ninteractions in some way or are only\nappropriate or cross boundaries or don't\nknow that something isn't right because\nto me it doesn't feel like an offense or\nan attack initially I don't feel scared\nor I don't feel you know the feelings\nbut I should feel what I feel is that\nthis person needs help I don't feel it\nI'll know I'm in danger I should call\nthe police\nokay so so let's sorry can I interrupt\nfor a second why don't you feel the\nfeelings that you should feel\nI I don't know I don't know why I'm\nyou've made me very a rather i I think\nwhat causes these extreme situations is\nthat I keep giving people chances after\nthey show that maybe I should let them\ngo I think I think it's like I keep\ngiving people the benefit of the doubt\nwhen I went deep down I know what's\nhappening like I keep yes I think though\nthe hard thing here Anita is that in a\nbizarre way I think maybe your goodness\nneeds to change so now I'm gonna I'm\ngonna build on this hypothesis a little\nbit ok\nand I'm not telling you that you\nshouldn't be a good person but I think\nthat you are a good person at the\ndetriment to yourself and and that's\nsomething that as someone who also feels\nempathy and caring and as someone who\ncares about a lot of people when I see\nyou I see you cannibalizing yourself for\nthe sake of other people and that hurts\nme to see but I don't know that that\ncauses dissonance in me I I don't I\ndon't think it does cause dissonance\nwithin you and that's actually what\nbothers\nI know it's weird hear me out okay so so\nthe first thing is that like I just\ncould be wrong here okay I just couldn't\nbe wrong\nI just don't this is something that any\nthat there's one thing you've\ndemonstrated to me and that's an amazing\ncapacity for self-reflection exploration\nand growth and so I am going to trust\nyou to know all I'm gonna give you is\nsomething to think about and if you\nexplore it and then you are conclude\nthat what I'm saying is like not really\napplicable fine I think there's a decent\nchance of that but let me just tell you\nlike a couple of other patterns okay\nso the first is is is that there is this\npattern of like stuckness of sort of\nlike okay like I'm a good person I help\nlots of people you take care of your mom\nyou take care of bunnies you take care\nof those people who used to be loved and\nthey're loved to no longer noble spirit\nbeautiful amazing right and then on the\nflip side of that there's also some\namount of guilt or feeling like you're\nletting people down if you sit still\nthere's a sense of burnout you're kind\nof like a fixer you're like the person\nwho never gives up on other people what\nare you feeling right now feeling okay\nyeah what do you feel him just squeeze\njust good yep I had a feeling this was\ngoing to happen so I tried to apologize\nthat ahead of time so stick with me if\nyou can if it becomes uncomfortable let\nme know okay and I'm absolutely gonna\nsqueeze you so I'm gonna keep squeezing\nand you got to let me know if I'm being\na dick okay okay one second Bunny's\ngetting too hot oh my god I'm just gonna\nput him away great sometimes we got to\nhit the pause bot\nI need are you okay if I keeps you okay\nif I you okay if I keep squeezing or\nshould we stop it's fine it's okay\nyou'll let me know if it's not okay yes\nokay so you know it's interesting\nbecause I I mean I see that like you\nknow you're clearly a good person and\nyet you have some of these negative\nfeelings which it sounds like you kind\nof manage by chunking them up and\ndealing with them a piece at a time\nwhich sounds like a really good strategy\nthere are a couple of other things that\nso if we look at a lot of the different\nthings that you do there's like sort of\na good side and a bad side right like\ntaking care of your mom has a good side\nand it has a bad side\ngenerally speaking the good side is for\nother people the bad side is for you\nthat tends to be how your relationships\nwork right so if we look at like the\nstalkers like they benefit from your\nyour saintly forgiveness and that comes\nat the cost of you sometimes being like\nin situations that are dangerous and you\nyou are just you're such a good person\nand sometimes it honestly it scares me\nhow good of a person you are because\nanyway so so I I don't know where that\nrelentless positivity comes from I think\na lot of it is is very very genuine and\ncomes from because I I hear absolutely\nlike the result of genuine reflection\nand appreciation for what life has given\nyou and it's it's beautiful to watch and\nI also wonder like I don't know if this\nis just me being cynical but I also\nwonder if there's some amount of\nyourself that won't let you be less than\nwhat you are because it sounds like when\nyou stay still for a minute\nfeelings negative emotions start to come\nup and then like you don't want to let\nyourself feel that way and then we get\nto a couple of other like just\ninteresting things okay so there are ups\nand downs to most things in your life\nit kind of goes back to this idea of\nbeing stuck where like you know you\ncan't eat or like you can't you need to\nhave flatmates because like sometimes\nphysically like it sounds like for a\nsafety issue like you need to have\npeople around in case you choke and at\nthe same time you're kind of damned if\nyou do and damned if you don't because\nwhatever you do have\nflatmates they start you know burbling\nyour underwear and and the pheromones\nand things like that so it's kind of\nlike damned if you do and damned if you\ndon't so the two other things that I'd\nreally think about is like that's a\npattern that I see in so many parts of\nyour life there's one part that I don't\nsee this pattern which is in the\nBergling of the underwear and the\nobsessional worshipfulness of anita and\nso the the the the cynical part of me\nwonders like what what's the positive of\nthat side of the relationship right cuz\neverything else in your life has like a\ngood part in a bad part and the people\nobsessing over you seems to be all bad\nbut generally speaking I don't think\nthat patterns like like you said like\nthe patterns that you have have pros and\ncons right they're the adaptations that\nyou've formed and it is very possible\nthat there is something like purely\nphysiologic about you your pheromones\nthat does this but there's a part of me\nthat says that we would be like it would\nbe remiss if we did not consider what\nare you getting out of this like where's\nthe positive here or is this just the\none dimension of your life where there's\njust negative because I generally\nspeaking I think patterns persist\nbecause they do something for us and\neven the most bizarre negative patterns\nstill do something for us and a good\nexample of this is like abusive\nrelationships because like people ask\nthat you know why do people stay in\nabusive relationships and I'm sure you\nhave some thoughts about that but\nsometimes it's like like when I remember\ntalking to a couple of people who had\ntrauma and what they shared was that\nlike\nthe idea that they would rather be with\nsomeone who they know is abusive then\nsort of take the chance with someone who\nisn't abusive and then one day may\nbecome abusive yeah yeah I mean I think\nit's different for different people but\nI mean it's really bizarre things and\nearlier on Street we were talking to\nsomeone who was embroiled with some of\nthis sexual harassment stuff and it was\nbizarre to discover that part of the\nreason that she did not speak was not\nout of fear or power dynamics but was\nactually out of love which is like\nstrange like that's not why we think\nwomen remain silent when it comes to\nsexual harassment and assault and and my\npoint is that like it's just it's it's\ntoo persistent of a pattern I think\nthere's some order to it and could it be\nphysiologic absolutely could it be that\nlike you evoke something so here's\nanother hypothesis for example that you\nevoke something very very like\nprimordial and almost like carnal in\npeople that there's something about the\nperson that you are and kind of the\nlight that you give off and the\ngratitude that you bring in the\nforgiveness that you bring that just\nlike some people's like brain just can't\nhandle it and they start to get confused\nabout the relationship with you I think\nthere could be a bunch of hypotheses but\nthe the real the real question that I\nthink could offer growth if it happens\nto be true is like what are you getting\nout of it and and in a bizarre way and\nmaybe I'm projecting here because I have\nfelt this way before that like\nthe more the harder the worse people\ntreat me the greater I become if I\nforgive them in bizarrely that ended up\nbeing about my ego not about me being a\ngood person but about convincing myself\nthat I'm a good person\nand this you are making me step back and\nobserve how how I feel when I interact\nwith these people that kept pushing my\nboundaries as I allowed them to do so\nand kept forgiving them and I don't\nthink I felt like a better person I felt\nan encroaching sense of unease and skip\nlike fear like not fear of being harmed\nbut fear of losing them like I felt like\nevery every step was like ah don't do\nthat okay cuz I'm gonna have to not\nfriends with you one day so I'm gonna\nforgive you and I understand why this\nhappened but you have to stop now and\nI'd be so gentle because every step of\nthe way as they step closer and closer\nand I keep stepping back and back I I\nfeel scared of losing them I feel like I\nreally enjoy playing tap you go into\nthis person I really enjoy having\nfriends and building connections I'm so\nproud of myself being able to actually\nconnect with people because it was so\nhard for me before and I really want\nthis to continue and I don't want this\nto be what it's the coming and I don't\nwant to acknowledge that it's becoming\nthe same pattern I don't want I don't\nwant this to go this way\nI'm gonna keep giving you chances to\ntake it in another direction please and\nI don't feel good about it I feel weak I\nfeel degraded because I am surrendering\nmy self-respect I I know deep down that\nI should be able to just say I don't\nlike this you know don't do this to me\nbut I feel like I would rather feel\nhumiliated I fight I'd rather feel like\na soft touch and feel like oh I'm being\nreally weak here then keep losing people\nand keep feeling like I can't connect I\nkeep feeling so alone I just fear I\nthink I fear I fear the loss more than I\nfear the situations I end up in I fear I\nfeel losing these people more than I\nfear the assault yeah so that makes a\nlot of sense and and then the other\ninteresting thing there\nAnita is it's not just the fear of\nlosing people it's the fear I mean once\nagain a hypothesis right so I trust to\nyou so I encourage you to think about\nthis it's it may not just be the fear of\nlosing people it may be the fear of\nbecoming the person who loses people\ndoes that make sense I think I need you\nto expand on that so you used to be\nsomeone who couldn't form relationships\nwith people right and now you've become\nsomeone who forms relationships with\npeople and so sometimes it's not about\nthe loss of an individual relationship\nit's about rewinding and going back to\nsquare one and being banked to the\nperson you used to be who can't form\nrelationships with people I wonder if\nthat's really what you're afraid of it's\nnot the loss of a particular\nrelationship it's about like the like is\nlike I just I'm getting this vibe from\nyou that this is about you is a person\nit's not about them it's about you and\nand anyway so you guys just you just got\nto think I mean think through it and I\nthink you'll know and I trust whatever\nyour answer is so is it about the loss\nof that particular relationship and like\nmaybe there's something with abandonment\nthere or is about is it about becoming\ngoing back to the person that you used\nto be because that would make a lot of\nsense to me that you are [ __ ]\nterrified of losing what you gained\nlosing your gratitude like if there was\none motivator that would Trump all other\nmotivators if I had to hypothesize for\nyou it's about losing what you've gained\nbecause holy [ __ ] Anita\nyou've gained so much through sweat\nblood and tears\nand if anything could possibly take that\naway I this is my empathy speaking I\nwould be absolutely terrified absolutely\nterrified because you have gained so\nmuch you have triumphed and climbed\nmountains and loved an appreciation for\nlife where people are stealing your\nunderwear you wake up every day with\naspirational pneumonia you can't eat\nbecause you vomit you punch yourself in\nthe face and you have emotional moments\nof rage and somehow you have triumphed\nover this [ __ ] and there's a chance that\nsomething can take this away ah no\n[ __ ] way\nyou will deal with as much abuse as they\nhave to give but you're not going to\nslide back on on the road that you've\ntraveled so far\nthat would make sense to me does it make\nit true\nit does make a lot of sense to me - yeah\nI think it's not just about losing them\nand I do mourn them I miss those friends\nthat I've yes trations but I yeah I am\nterrified of the being an isolated\nperson again sees people outside the\nwindow having fun enjoying summer and\njust seeing every moment slip away and\nnot being able to connect and feeling\nreally alone and feeling like I'm losing\nlike my life is drifting away while I\nsit here too afraid to connect and live\nand do things and yeah a lot of things\nthat I do are about our fear of of\nsliding back into that trap again of\nbeing in those same four walls for years\nbecause I was like a phobic - so yeah it\nstands to reason that not not not being\naccepting and not being forgiving and\nnot trying to rectify the issues in my\nfriendships even when it's beyond repair\nyeah it was feel like I'm sliding back\nto that place like it's weird right\nbecause it's like you're not yeah cuz I\nmean you know they're beyond repair so\nthere has to be something really\npowerful and oddly enough I think\npositive and keep it close like if you\nthink about it who puts up with that\nmuch weird [ __ ] there's got to be\nsomething to balance those scales right\notherwise you wouldn't be in the\nrelationship to begin with and the last\nthing is and this is this is where I I\nhope for you because I think that on\nsome level you've processed a lot of\nemotions but like I think this part of\nyou somewhere along the way you still\nhaven't been able to feel secure enough\nthat you're not gonna go back there\nbecause Anita you're not gonna go back\nto it I don't think you're gonna go back\nthere I think you're just a different\nperson I don't think that any amount of\nanything can take you back there and I\nwould love it if you could somehow come\nto understand that and feel secure in\nthat and be free of that fear\nbecause like there's still a lot of\nstuff that you're like I think holding\non to and and suppressing and it sounds\nlike you've got a pretty good strategy\nfor kind of chunking up and managing it\nover time and and at the same time I\nstill see you carrying a burden that I\nwish you didn't have to and I want to\nbelieve that one day you'll get to put\nthat burden down yeah the last thing is\nthat if you do have suppressed emotion\nit's gonna make your autoimmune stuff\nworse so this is a generally like known\nthing that like you know psychological\ndistress makes autoimmune disorders\nworse and that's not it's not\npsychological there is something called\npsychoneuroimmunology which is like a\nfascinating field which looks at the\nrelationship between your mind your\nbrain and your immune system and\ngenerally looks at the dysregulation of\nyour immune system based on\npsychological insults and and so the\nlast thing that I would hope is it that\nif you can continue moving on the path\nthat you're moving I would hope because\nit's a lie I mean I don't know what your\nautoimmune disorder is but it sounds\nlike it's [ __ ] awful and it also\nsounds like you know generally speaking\nwith autoimmune disorders we don't\nreally have great treatments where you\ntake a pill in that [ __ ] goes away and\nyet I've seen a lot of hope with people\nwith autoimmune disorders because they\nwind up in my office and then we help\nthem psychologically and and then their\nautoimmune stuff sort of gets better and\nand so I really hope that your\nautoimmune stop can get better too and I\nhope I just because Anita you're such an\namazing and remarkable person I think it\nlike it makes me sad and I think this is\nmaybe a little bit pity and I apologize\nfor feeling that way it's just how I\nfeel like like I I think I'm not trying\nto pity you it's just it's just how I\nfeel like I feel sad for you and I feel\nlike you don't deserve to feel like for\neverything that you've gained I think\nit's incredibly unfair that at the edges\nyou still have chunks of guilt and\nchunks of fear and chunks of like maybe\nother [ __ ] I don't know because you\nlike you make the world such a better\nplace by your existence and I feel like\nyou know the people who are deserving of\nthose chunks of negative emotion or the\n[ __ ] that are the panty peeves they\ndescribe feel that way not you which is\nit fair and isn't true but that's just\nthe way that I feel\nthank you I really I really appreciate\nthat and I appreciate that you know it's\nso nice to speak to someone especially\nabout the whole panty stealers thing\nwithout judgement it's such a hard arena\nto come forward about this stuff because\nit only ever evokes hate people assume\nthat it's my fate or that I'm doing\nsomething wrong and I'm it's so good to\nhear to talk to someone who once you\nhelp me understand what's going on and\nfix it rather than just blame me yeah\nI've been the most inappropriate thing\nthat I feel about the panties seriously\ncan I sure it's gonna be able to maybe a\nlittle bit humorous it's just like this\nthis bizarre curiosity like like what's\ngoing on there anyway I don't mean to\ndevalue like because because it is I\nmean it's it's the rebuttable pattern\nI've never heard of this before\nAnita and anyway I apologize for not\nmeeting you where you were emotionally\nthere in that moment no no no it's fine\nlike I I joke about it quite often -\nyeah it's like I've been through so much\nregarding it recently with multiple\npeople not just the panty stealing but\nyou know the pushing of boundaries and\njust the weird people yeah people do\nthat I'm just like I would joke I've got\nso many jokes about it you wouldn't\nbelieve but I've been laughing this off\nfor years yeah yeah oh you have no idea\n- it's just so much I think it doesn't\nmake it but get I think being a stream I\nkind of contributes quite a bit I mean I\nget people who DME you're like can I pay\nyou 350 euros to have 50 minutes live\nstream of your feet and things so like I\nthink it's really hard to differentiate\nwhen people first make friends with you\nthey're not like hi I'm secretly\nplanning to get to marry you but you\ndon't know that yeah and I totally not\ninto you okay how we're just friends and\nlike so I I think that there's a higher\nrisk factor of it now just because I'm a\nstreamer and you know it's just\nsomething as a side effect of streaming\nso it's I think it's probably not going\nto go away even if I figure out my\naspects of it yeah really highlighted\nand helped me out I think it's just a\nside effect of what's going on with me\nnow as well but\nat least when I stop streaming they'll\nbe hope but you know I can reduce this\nand kind of get back to kind of like a\nvery safe respectful level with people\nagain well assuming it isn't pyramids\nyeah I mean my mom's 50 and she's still\ngetting it like every kara we've gotten\nhas fallen in love with her and like men\nwould fight over her yeah like two guys\nI remember when I was a kid two guys\nbent down to kiss a hand at once and\nthey both bind heads against each other\nit's hilarious but I have so many\nstories like that my mom has at West K\nshe's very very beautiful she's 50 she\nlooks like my younger sister she\neveryone just is infatuated with her\nit's ridiculous so she has a lot less\nthan me in terms of that level of\nattention so I guess I always scared as\nwell because you know she hasn't ever\nshe's just stayed away from people has\nbeen her coping mechanism and I really\ndidn't want that to be mine interesting\nyeah that that gets me even more curious\nbecause like that's like they're mean\nthere could be something genetic I mean\nyeah I mean she traced our family\nhistory and a lot of our the women in\nour family like from back home from the\nancient cult level used to be sold off\nto marriage to Nobles and things because\nwe were notorious for having a lot of\nwomen that attracted a lot of male\nattention and that you know they were\nall different body types and they were\nall different you know age groups and\nstuff and it's not like we all look the\nsame or act the same we're all very very\nunique people from each other and yet\nthis still happens to us so I don't know\nsounds like some Sir Topham something\nspecial there some cats fax us it's\ninteresting but you know it cause\nproblems like he said that two of our\nfamily members in art history were\nburned as witches and that the story\nthat runs in our family is that there\nwere just some jealous women in the\nvillage whose husbands and partners took\nan interest in them so they accused them\nto get them out of the way so it doesn't\nit's not a good thing it's not fun thing\nno it certainly doesn't sound fun it\nsounds you know remarkable but not fun I\ncan't you know thank yes they're all a\nlot more that's a lot better looking\nthan meet a lot of my family those\nreally gorgeous women in my family um I\nwish I wish it been more positive thing\nfor them honestly sounds like awesome I\ndon't want to eat with your time and I'm\nactually quite excited to see what you\ncan do for this kid in his project yeah\nso thank you very much indeed I I really\nappreciate your openness and and I hope\nI didn't say anything that was out of\nline you know I I think yeah I and I\napologize if I did I apologize if I made\nthat off-color jokes or made you feel\nsqueezed\nI gave consent it's so good yeah I I\nthink sometimes you know there has to be\na little bit of discomfort when we look\nat the parts of ourselves that we just\nhaven't looked at before and and I hope\nthat that was okay and I hope it's\nhelpful to you and I'd really rethink\nabout maybe exploring this with someone\nwho is a professional just to see if\nit's valuable because Anita you're so\nself reflective on your own it's like I\nmean a professional is just gonna be\naccelerant to anything that you would do\non your own and it sounds like you make\nreally good use of that time so I'd\nreally think about getting you know\nthinking about that thank you\nwhat you've given me is a lot and I\nthink it might really help me to set\nbetter boundaries and be safer you know\nI really appreciate you and everything\nyou've done for me and I hope people\nyou've been listening to have taken\nsomething good from it as well\nand yeah with that Allah"
