    "transcript": "yes so welcome and so people refer to\nyou by your full name they call you\nMichael Reese um it's it's really\nwhatever the flavor of what you're\nfeeling is you what do you what are you\nbecause people that like you know it's\ninteresting because I just look at you\nknow who we're talking to today and I\nwanna see like your name with first name\nand last name yeah I've noticed that I\nnot intentionally I've done that\nMichaels fun okay some friends call me\nMike hmm okay what do you what do you\nprefer\nMicra Mike Michaels good okay cool so\ntell me is there something in particular\nyou want to talk about today or not not\nreally I just kind of came into it\nlooking a talk of a conversation um\nsee what you can glean out of it cool um\nthere are a couple things that I think\nare like maybe like stereotypically kind\nof for a discussion like this sometimes\nyou know there's like you know the\nclassic like I get anxious a lot stuff\nlike that but you know I'm really just\nlooking at talk about whatever's and\nwhen you say you get anxious a lot what\ndoes that mean I've like I was thinking\nof things to talk about for the session\nit that's just like you know something\nthat came up I often am anxious about\nmany things so if that's someone you\nwant to explore or it's really whatever\nyou want to get into I mean so I'm so\nMichael think of me as a resource mm-hmm\nso I have a wide background of training\nfrom like meditation and spirituality to\nlike neuroscience and psychiatry so is\nthere something in that span that you're\ncurious about or you think could be\nhelpful for a particular dimension of\nyour life I suppose is there like a\nlittle like your psychology sprinkled in\nthere\nsure awesome\nhelpful I I suppose yeah um I I do\nstruggle with anxiety sometimes so maybe\nthat's something yeah we can get sure\nI'm noticing a theme yeah yeah you get\nanxious a lot about a lot of things as\nyou said yes yeah let's talk about that\nso what do you get anxious about um a\nlot of a lot of things very day-to-day\nthings like like whatever I'm doing for\nwork getting started with anything any\nkind of project lots of things coming on\na show on Twitch that's not that wasn't\ntoo bad but is this a show on Twitch is\nthis a show on Twitch yeah is that we\nare we a show is this a show I suppose\nit as a show okay I'm okay\nI was just wanted to get this fell under\nthat umbrella but okay so you said\ngetting started on stuff sometimes doing\nstuff on Twitch what else ah day-to-day\nstuff you know the normal normal human\nanxious things you know thinking about\nthe long general future of your life\n[Music]\nsure\nlong general future of your life what's\nyour background in neuroscience actually\nso I did research for about I was a\nresearch assistant in a neuroscience lab\nfor about 18 months to two years and\nthen you learn a lot of applied\nneuroscience as in medical school and as\na psychiatrist so what is applied\nneuroscience like how do you apply that\nknowledge because I have no idea what\nthe field of neuroscience is like sure\nso applied neuroscience is if you have\nsomeone who is in a car accident and a\npart of their brain is damaged then what\ndoes that do to them and how do you work\nwith that so that's like applied\nneuroscience another example of applied\nneuroscience so I do a lot of mind-body\nwork\nso for example how does the brain change\nunder prolonged periods of stress so\njust here's an example of applied\nneuroscience so let's say that someone\nis under stress so stress releases a\nhormone called releases a couple of\nthings so first thing it releases a is\nadrenaline which burn or adrenaline\nepinephrine a couple of these short\nacting hormones those affect the brain\nin certain ways so one thing that\nadrenaline does is it collapses your\nperipheral vision from about 180 degrees\nto 30 degrees so that's an evolutionary\nthing that kind of causes people to\nfocus in on like the center yeah\ninterestingly I think that it does that\npsychologically too so generally\nspeaking when people are under periods\nof stress they have trouble considering\nthings that are not right in front of\nthem the peripheral of you know your\nmine exactly so they get they kind of\nlike tunnel down and just focus on one\nthing over time so you also release a\nhormone called cortisol which has a\nslower duration of action so adrenaline\nhits your body within seconds and lasts\nfour minutes cortisol starts to kick in\nwithin the hour and will last for like\nit has different kinds of physiological\nand neurological effects for four to 24\nhours one example is that it goes to\nthis little part in the back of your\nbrain called the reticular activating\nformation which governs sleep and so the\nreason that it does that is because when\nwe were when we were evolving and we\nwere like primates living in dangerous\nsituations if you add an adrenaline\nresponse like if you saw a tiger in the\nwoods you want cortisol to keep your\nreticular activating formation div and\nmake your sleep easily disturbing mm-hmm\nright so like you want to wake up if you\nhear something\nyeah it's a evolutionary response\nabsolutely so the downside though is\nthat now when people are under mental\nstress because we don't have Tigers\nanymore but or etiology adapts to\ncurrent circumstances mm-hmm so when I'm\nthinking about huh you can't\ndifferentiate right you can't\ndifferentiate your body uses what it has\nand so then when I'm worried about\npaying so today is July 8th so if I'm\nthinking about paying rent at the end of\nthe month I'm gonna be in a prolonged\nperiod of stress which is gonna make it\nhard for me to sleep because every noise\nthat happens it's going to wake up wake\nme up because my reticular activating\npermission is like highly active that's\nan example of what I would call applied\nneuroscience awesome oh that's very cool\nI was um I actually really considered\nthat's interesting I considered getting\ninto like psychology when I was in high\nschool I was like a crossroads before I\nwould choose\nI was either choosing like computer\nscience video editing or psychology\nI drew computer science how did you make\nyour decision oh I essentially just\nflipped a coin really just just very\nspur of the moment in which did you\nchoose one computer science yeah oh I'm\nvery happy I'm glad I didn't go in a\nvideo editing that's for sure\nso uh some thoughts about psychology but\npretty happy with what I chose when you\nsay you have some thoughts about\npsychology what has happened okay well\nyou know I wonder what it would have\nbeen like if I had actually ended up\npursuing psychology instead I was I was\nreally interested in it and in high\nschool but I'm quite glad with the\ndecision I made do you like to\nunderstand how things work yes yes yeah\nabsolutely yeah like understanding the\ninner workings of things I can see the\nattraction to psychology for you that\nyeah yeah looking at a phone you want to\nknow how the LCD screen is a little LED\nscreen works and I feel like I mean like\nyou're never gonna fully understand\nmaybe that's why I went with calm sigh\nit was because in psychology there's\nalways more to do right you're never\ngonna fully understand the human mind 40\nsecond do you think he can actually\nfully map out every inner working of the\nhuman mind is that like\nlike a reasonable end goal psychology er\nsure why not I don't know I feel like\nlike the minds and I don't know I'm not\nsure you would be able to like have\nreason for every thought that pops into\na head you know like be able to map each\nand every little meme okay so let's\nthink about that so the first question\nis are you talking about do you think\nit's unreasonable to map out the origin\nof every thought for every person are we\ntalking about mapping out the origin of\nevery thought for you other people I was\ntalking in a general sense about you\nknow any random you know X person on the\nstreet sure I think that sounds\ndifficult what do you think about for\nyou I don't to what extent um I think\nyou probably get pretty deep in there\nabout why I think the things I do i've\ndegree mm-hmm I think that that's yeah I\nmean I I think that it's hard to\nunderstand other people completely but I\ndo hope that you could understand\nyourself completely I think that's what\nthere's this term enlightenment or\nworkshop in Sanskrit which is like when\npeople meditate for a while they gain\nenlightenment and apparently it's hard\nand happens rarely but if we think about\njust the the translation like it\nsuggests knowledge mmm-hmm and so it's\nsort of a complete understanding of self\nand so I don't know if that's possible\nor not but I think that you can\ncertainly make I mean I think you can\nunderstand most of yourself like I think\nthat the human mind ultimately is\nreducible to scientific principles and\nif it's reducible the scientific\nprinciples as opposed to RNG then I\nthink you can understand it I agree with\nthat is that something you seek to do is\nto understand the way other people think\nor to help people understand themselves\nI'd say more of the latter\nokay so\nwe can kind of come back to the anxiety\nover the long general future of your\nlife so what are you worried about in\nterms of is it okay if I ask you talk\nmore in the third person we can do that\noh um dive in as far as you want I I've\njust always kind of struggled with\nanxiety that's just something that's\nlike been very prevalent and my life\nsince you know the early days I think of\nhigh school so can we actually pause\nthere for a second when you say you\nstruggled with anxiety since high school\nmm-hmm what can you tell me like show me\nwhat that like help me understand what\ndoes that mean like paint me a picture\nsure it's a lot of it started a lot of\nsocial anxiety so like not being able to\ntalk to people in high school then\ngetting you know I think I think I had a\nlong very worried idea of what my future\nwas gonna be in high school because I\ndidn't have any plans yeah originally I\nhad no plans for what I was gonna do\nafter high school I was just kind of\nwinging it yeah and so I think that was\na very yeah prevalent creeping anxiety\nfor you know what how am I going to\nsurvive after this and it led to like\nless planning because that meant you\nknow accepting the fact that you have to\ndo something after high school and yet\nthat's yeah I don't know it just I I\ncan't actually like pinpoint the exact\ntime then it started happening but it\nstarted happening at some point where I\nbecome anxious about many things you\nknow like I'm not able to sleep very\nwell like I had that started in high\nschool so where I'm up at night you know\nworrying about things it's gotten better\nI've you know gone through like sleeping\ntechniques meditation techniques which\nare nice for free man yeah what do you\nworry about at night you know it's the\nweirdest thing it's less of like\nspecific things and it's more like a\nnebulous just impending like not not\nimpending but no just a nebulous anxiety\nabout the current state of things even\nif everything is is good you know even\nif everything going on\nso would you call it like a nebulous red\nyes that's a very nice poetic term yeah\nI like that yeah so Michael I'd like to\ntoss out a couple things and let's talk\nas scientist to scientist okay so what\nI'm hearing is that there aren't\nparticular thoughts but that there's a\nfeeling right so the first thing to\nunderstand is that sometimes people are\nanxious about something like they're\nanxious about a particular outcome like\nlet's I think you may have experienced\nthat so when you said not being able to\ntalk to people\nwhat made it art in high school for you\nto talk to people I think it was just\nworried what what what would become of\nthe conversation what I would say you\nknow focused on the mechanics less\nunlike the actual interpersonal the\nreality of the conversation yeah so so\nin what were you worried would happen if\nthe conversation became assert oh\nprobably that I'd look like a jackass\nlike you know look stupid right so\nprobably feeling dumb high school mean\nso if we look at it that's a particular\nfear right it's a it's an anxiety that\nhas form or shape those thoughts have\nlike their thoughts like if I say this\nor if I don't say this they're gonna\nthink I'm stupid\nhmm what you're describing to me now\nseems to be like a general sense of\ndread that doesn't it's not that\nthoughts result in dread mm-hmm whereas\nI would almost say that your thoughts\nsort of result in the feeling of anxiety\nin high school mm-hmm does that make\nsense like you have particular thoughts\nand those thoughts lead to feelings yes\ndoes the feeling come before the thought\nor does the feeling come after the\nthought it seems I I would say the the\nfeeling comes before the thought yes\nokay almost as if it's stemming from\nfrom the feeling okay so that's the\nsubstitute so the interesting thing is\nthat then we can say that your feelings\ncan manifest as particular thoughts\nmm-hmm but your sense of dread does not\nmanifest in any particular way it's just\nlike a raw sense of dread okay what\nwould you say to that I could agree it's\nhard to know what is the symptom and\nwhat is like like the cause it's hard to\nknow if like you know I'm you know the\nchicken or the egg like if I'm worried\nabout something coming up and that's\ncreating the feeling or the feeling is\nthere and I'm just applying it to\nsomething that's coming up great so I'd\nsay it's hard to say yes it is hard to\nsay so we can tunnel down into that so\nwhat you're what I'm hearing you almost\nsuggests is that there's a possibility\nthat the feeling will latch on to or\nhijack particular things in your life\nokay um I could say that it's like like\nI have latched on to as and I apply it\nto things how exactly yeah that's what I\ncould agree with that yeah right so it's\nkind of interesting because then that's\nnot actually like it's not that the\nthing in your life is the source of\nanxiety yeah exactly it's just something\nthat you conflate with each other yeah\nso like I understand that you said\nearlier that it's hard to understand\nwhat's the chicken or what's the egg but\nthe interesting thing Michael is that I\nthink you actually have hypotheses baked\nin to your description of things because\nyou I mean you said that like I don't\nknow if it like picks up something\nthat's happening in the future and kind\nof applies itself to that does that make\nsense yeah and if we think about how\ndoes someone say that sentence it's\nbecause they have noticed something that\ncould be true okay do you think I'm\nalready kind of have an idea for what's\ngoing on absolutely because I'm not\nactually telling you very much I'm\nbasically repeating back to you what you\nsaid to me hmm\nso it because if we really think about\nit I mean you're the one who said it's\nlike nebulous right so it's not specific\nto something but you've noticed\nsomething within your mind that\nsometimes this nebulous dread will like\napply itself to something in the future\nyes yeah and and that's kind of weird\nbecause it's like then where does that\ncome from because it does\ncome from the future no yeah yeah it's\njust ever-present yeah so how does it\nfeel to have ever-present threat you\nknow it's not great obviously but I\nthink I've kind of you know I've watched\na lot of videos and read some things on\nhow to deal with this type of you know\nanxiety and dread it's definitely better\nnow like I think one that helped a lot\nwas like it's it's not you're not\nsupposed to or one of the ways of\ndealing with it is not like pushing it\naway completely like pretending it\ndoesn't exist it's more like accepting\nthat it is you know a part of who you\nare as a person and like learning to\nlive with that in everyday life and that\nthat is very helpful because then you\nyeah it's a I think it's a healthier way\nof dealing with it\nthat's one that helped me okay so\nhealthier way okay so Michael I think\nthis conversation is gonna be a little\nbit different from many that we have on\nstream okay is it okay if I tell you how\nI think it's gonna be different and sort\nof get your permission to let it be\ndifferent fairly lay it on me man so\nsometimes we talk about things that are\nlike anxiety like so sometimes we talk\nabout feelings we talk about emotions we\ntalk about experiences when we may get\nthere for you but I don't know if it's\njust the way I'm feeling today or the\nway that you're talking today or the\nbackground that you have or the way that\nyou speak but I would really like to\nhelp you understand or maybe we can\nexplore together like what the [ __ ] is\ngoing on here sure yeah what is it like\nwhat is it like how does that work like\nwhat is what is existential dread is it\nlike is it anxiety because or is it like\nis you just born this way or like is\nthis like repressive like what is that\nbut your does the [ __ ] come from let's\nfigure it out right right so so okay so\nin order to do that we're gonna have to\nreally tunnel down into a lot of what\nyou say because I think you have a lot\nof brilliant answers that you that\nMacross is sort of like unsure\nobservations uh-huh so when you said\nokay we don't know what's the chicken\nand the egg and then you said I've read\na lot about it awesome you know I've\nthought a lot about it great and what I\nhave discovered or what seems to help is\nthere are certain ways of dealing with\nit and then you said pushing pushing it\naway is not the best way to deal with it\nyeah sort of letting it be a part of you\naccepting it is like a better way to\ndeal with it and it doesn't bother me as\nmuch yeah so now let's tunnel down into\nwhat you're saying okay so both of these\nhave to do with responses to the\nexistential threat\nyes that's do you see that that's\ncompletely different from the origin or\ngetting rid of it\nmm-hmm and so I would agree with you\nthat pushing it away is not that healthy\nis that something you've done before\nyeah I think that's like your initial\nreaction to any negative feeling right\nas a person like get you know fire hot\nback run is kind of the idea but I mean\nnot the you know not the general way not\nthe best way to apply to every negative\nthing you know this so how did you push\nit away I think just ignoring it and\nthen ignoring it you know makes it worse\nso okay and how does one ignore it I try\nto put your focus on other things you\nknow very good distraction or yeah a\ndistraction what else I can think of\nnone other than distraction okay so\nthat's probably lucky because some\npeople ignore it through things like\nusing substances losing themself in\ngaming so that to sort a distraction\nyeah so I'm not yeah so those I guess\nthose are the same let me just think\nabout why do I think about that\nokay so let's just call that distract\nyou every time you have like like\ndissonance in your mind do you try to go\nin and like fix it like every time you\ndo you often do that what you just did\nwhere you wonder why you had that\nthought process and like go in and that\nlook like what you just did right were\nyou oh that's that's cool\nyeah I do that a lot I I don't see a lot\nof people doing it that's I don't see a\nlot of people doing it either\nyou think it's important people go in\nand fix dissonance in their mind yes I\nthink it's very important I think that's\nhalf of what's wrong with the world\ntoday yeah we got a mental health idea\nAaron like that interpersonal tenna not\neven health or interpersonal I think\njust like human beings don't question\nthe conclusions of their mind mmm\nbecause I absolutely I agree I agree\nyeah so I think we're not taught how to\ndo that\nmm-hmm so I think it's a skill yeah I\nthink self checking is very important\nyeah so it's interesting because if you\nwant to take take a quick tangent and\ntalk about like evolutionary\nneuroscience our brains are not decided\nto do that so if you think about it what\nour brains are decided to do is create\ncertainty from uncertainty so like in a\nvery simple sense like back in the day\nlike you know let's say you wake up in\nyour hut and then you're like where\nshould I go look for food mm-hmm that is\na cop a problem that is so complicated\nand you have so little information that\nit's impossible to answer where should\nyou go look for food you have no [ __ ]\nidea\nnorth-south-east-west I don't know now\nlater how far how long should I go north\nbefore I go east and so human females\nhuh that's a complex problem yeah\nabsolutely there's no way to answer so\nwhat our brain is designed to do is to\ntake gigantic swathes of uncertainty and\ngive us answers and it says hey hey you\nshould go this way and you're like why\nand then your brain is like I don't know\njust do it we're gonna just assume that\nthis is the right way that's how most of\nour brain works yeah yeah that's varies\nand then you get reinforcement over time\nas you\nfind like a berry by the somewhere by\nthe creek you go north you think sure\narts is for food yeah and then even if\nyou don't get reinforcements you still\ndon't think you're wrong you still don't\neven if you don't get reinforcements you\nstill don't know really yep thank you if\nI go like north for like five miles and\nI don't find any berry bushes I'm gonna\nbe like pretty pissed right but I still\nthink I'm not wrong nope you won't think\nyou're wrong you'll be like let me go a\ndifferent way okay okay sorry\nso there are modern manifestations of\nthis too so there have been studies done\non like you know like packaging and\nplacement of items within a store so\nlike if you place a prominent display of\ncookies at the checkout and then people\nby the the cookie and then you ask the\nperson as they leave the grocery store\nwhy did you buy the cookie they'll give\nyou a reason they'll say like oh you\nknow Mike he really likes these cookies\nbut that's not actually the deciding\nfactor for why they bought it the reason\nthat they bought it is because of the\nplacement yeah and if it hadn't been\nplaced there\nthey wouldn't have purchased it so our\nmind is actually designed to fabricate\nlogical reasons for illogical behavior\nthat's what it's made for it works like\nbackwards from the conclusion works\nbackwards from the conclusion is a\nlittle weird\nit's shocking and strange yeah why why\ndo you think it what does it do that\nbecause that's the only way it works\nbecause thousands of years ago millions\nof years ago we had to manually just\nthink about out like an animal doesn't\nunderstand how anything works but it has\nto act with certainty uh-huh there's no\n[ __ ] idea like we have no like you\nactually don't know like if I stepped\noutside today I could get hit by a\nmeteor that's a possibility like it's on\nyou there's so much uncertainty in the\nworld and we just assume like I assume\nthat like my family is behind me in the\nhouse even though I don't know that oh I\nknow that huh Michael is\nmichael is quiet is that our urine thing\nor I can also turn it I turned you up a\nlittle bit okay great\nso yeah we I mean our our brain operates\nbased primarily on assumptions that we\nassume or facts like everyday if you get\nup get in your car and you drive to work\nyou assume that your workplace is gonna\nbe there even though you don't know that\nokay like it could've been like\nswallowed by an earthquake okay all\nright\nis there like why do we do you think\nanimals have to have that reasoning as\nwell yes okay it's not just like food\nhere food good it's like there needs to\nbe a reasoning to forgetting that food\nno no I mean so it's a food here food\ngood as that's real but like most of the\nworld is uncertain\nlike if you're a deer and I wake up in\nthe morning I'm like where where are the\nPredators I have no idea but if I if I\nget paralyzed by the lack of knowledge I\nwon't act so the reason that we act in\nignorance is because that's like that's\nhow most human beings function through\nmost of their life like four-year-olds\ndon't know what's gonna happen next and\nthe problem existential dread so now\nwe're gonna talk a little bit about\nwhere things come from let's come from\nthe capacity to realize that you don't\nknow what's coming back so Michael your\nproblem in high school was not that was\nactually one of knowledge not ignorance\nokay it's like knowledge that I know\nvery little yeah like you don't know\nwhat's gonna happen next which happens\nto most people in high school but some\npeople tend to get worried about it and\nsome people don't and generally speaking\nin my experience people who have more\ncalculating who have more RAM and more\ncomputing power tend to have more excess\nexistential dread\nwhat do you think about that um I don't\nknow I feel like many I feel like a lots\nof people can experience existential\ndread\nI don't like sheerly based on like your\nability to compute information I do not\nthink it's really based on your ability\nto compute information but you've\nobserved that I have observed that the\nsmarter you are the worse your anxiety\nokay that's interesting so like if you\nthink about anxiety what is anxiety\nanxiety is generally speaking worried\nworrying about consequences of future I\nmean worrying about future consequences\nof actions taken today present actions\nyeah right so if you can foresee more\nproblems mmm what do you think happens\nto your anxiety no of course you have\nmore yep and now we get to something\nreally interesting which is if you have\na part of your mind which latches on to\nthings and sort of hijacks them mm-hmm\nand you give it more food for things to\nhighjack on to what's gonna happen I\njust breathes more anxiety of course\nright absolutely right it's gonna find\nsomething yeah yeah yeah it definitely\ntakes up a large amount of you know the\nother mental mental juice as it were so\nwhen you say it takes up a large part of\nI would think about it as a large part\nof your mental juices generating things\nand the more mental juice so there are\ndifferent kinds of anxiety so there are\nso there are people for example with\nDown syndrome or other kinds of like\ncerebral palsy who will experience\nintense anxiety even though their\ncomputing power is pretty low but in my\nexperience the flavor of that anxiety is\ndifferent okay how so it's more like\nexistential dread so we'll get to that\nin a second but so so some of that is\nmore physiologic anxiety but it's not\nlike neurotic anxiety so like we think\nabout neurosis which is the tendency to\nworry so there's like neurotic anxiety\nwhich is kind of like you worry about\nlots of stuff and then some people just\nhave feelings that they can't shape and\nthat feeling will latch on to anything\nno matter how small it is okay so that\nbecause anxiety is not just a mental\nsensation as well right there's a\nphysiologic component yeah your heart\nrate will elevate oh yeah I got that\nreading problems and all oh yeah exactly\nand so that to those physiologic changes\nwill affect the function of your mind\neven though the root of it may not be\nmind so what I mean by that is that if\nyou have\nif your heart rate is elevated you're\ngonna have a sympathetic nervous\nresponse\nyou're gonna release adrenaline and what\nadrenaline literally does to your brain\nis starts to increase the speed of your\nthoughts make thoughts black and white\nand makes your thoughts that are\npossibilities feel like realities okay\nso it takes something that might be and\nit turns it into something that's\ndefinitely gonna happen certainty okay\nand that too is evolutionary because\nonce upon a time there were two human\nbeings who each faced a tiger and one\nhuman being saw the danger as a\npossibility and one human being saw the\ndanger is a reality which human being is\nmore likely to survive Nona sees it as a\nreality\nabsolutely so adrenaline makes\npossibilities about the future feel real\nand that's what our brain is [ __ ]\ndesigned to do mm-hmm so anyway a\nphysiologic anxiety can sort of\nreinforce certain thoughts but there's a\nphysiological component there's a\ncognitive component there's sort of a\nneurotic yeah I see what you're saying\nyeah I don't think we've still got into\nthe source of your existential dread but\nwe're kind of mapping things out oh yeah\nI understand it better okay any\nquestions so far\ncool no no I'm enjoying the ride okay\nnow is this I never really thought about\nthe differences and like different types\nof anxieties more nebulous or more\nfocused that's cool yeah so I think part\nof the problem is that we use the word\nanxiety to describe a lot of different\nthings yeah general kind of term so let\nme ask you something Michael by the way\nhow you feeling right now I'm fine\nI'm just having a good interesting very\ninteresting talk so you feel like this\nis a good use of our time yeah for sure\nokay so let me ask you something\nqualitatively would you say that your\nexistential dread is like roughly the\nsame or roughly different as being\nconcerned that people are gonna think\nyou're gonna look stupid roughly I\ncouldn't repeat the question yeah like\nwould you say that that's the same thing\nlike existential dread and like the way\nthey used to feel in high school like\nwhen you were concerned about inner\ninteractions and looking stupid do those\nfeel like different things to you or do\nthey feel like the same thing I think\nit's a rat it's very close to the same\nfeeling that I have okay I don't know if\nit is the same thing but it's it's close\nto the same feeling can you help us\nunderstand that feeling at all or is\nthat difficult it's no that's that's a\ngut in the gut where it you know\nwrenches up and yeah you know it's like\nyou're nervous you're very you're you're\nanxious you're okay what if this happens\nbut so your existential dread also makes\nyou feel things like physically in your\nin your stomach or your gut is it\nsometimes you know you know if I'm like\nreally nervous about something if I'm\nlike I'm like oh man I would really like\nto do this thing and then I like you\nknow spend the whole day you know like\nbeing a jackass and playing Ballarat\nthen I'll be like oh [ __ ] I should have\ndone that thing then I'll you know I'll\nbe anxious you know I'll have a like I\nshould have been doing something else\nit's like you know I could have done\nthis I could have done that yeah and\nthen that's that's the gut feeling\nthat's the like the neurotic anxiety\nfeeling okay so I'm gonna call what you\njust said there self judgement I'm not\ngonna call that anxiety okay\nyeah lots of self judgment okay right so\ndoes that sort of make sense like like\nyou're not worried so there's like so\nlet's just look at that for a second so\nlet's go back to Michael in high school\nis afraid of talking to someone because\nhe thinks they're going to look stupid\nokay yeah so that is Michael being in\nthe present and looking into the future\ngot it self judgment is different\nbecause it's Michael beating himself up\nfor the past yes okay yeah now there\ncould be a future component to that too\nso I think I think about anxiety is\nsomething that's forward facing and I\nthink about regret is something that's\nbackward facing sometimes you can look\nat the past day and think about the\nconsequences for tomorrow yeah\nabsolutely\ndo you do that yeah okay so then that I\nwould classify as anxiety but I think\nself judgment is\nright so like self-judgement is like\nlooking at yourself and saying I didn't\ndo a good job I'm not good enough\nokay and you would say that's different\nfrom anxiety yes I would describe\nanxiety as worrying about the future\nokay I I think III probably the self\njudgement is probably a proponent to it\nit's like oh I [ __ ] this up maybe you\nknow the future might change due due to\nit you know so so agree so there's like\nthis whole cesspool of all of this\nnegativity in all of our minds and so I\nthink it's but the point I'm making is\nthat if you can stop the self judgement\nthen your anxiety has less fuel okay I\nthink a fundamental reason like I don't\nis because I associate self judgment\nwith like being better as like a person\nyou know it's like it's like oh I'm\ngonna do that the next time all you know\ndid you [ __ ] this X thing better yes\nso now we get to another really\nimportant thing which is just like\neverything else that I've described self\njudgement serves a very important part\nso I think the tricky thing about being\na human is that a lot of what is good\nfor us makes us suffer okay\nself judgement discipline kind of type\nbeats absolutely right so like when I\nhave people so I work with some people\nwho are like very professionally\nacademically or financially successful\nand boy do they beat the [ __ ] out of\nthemselves and it's part of the reason\nthat they beat the [ __ ] up that's why\nthey're successful so the reason that\nlike if you look at medical students\nmedical students are super super anxious\nand highly neurotic actually neurotic is\na better term and the reason for that is\nbecause like the reason they got into\nMedical School in the first place is\nbecause when other people were out\npartying on a Friday night they were\nafraid of doing poorly on the test they\nwere at home studying\nso most professional success is\ncorrelated with - there's this thing\ncalled the five factor model of you\nheard of it before no I'm okay so it's a\nit's a well validated personality\nstructure that way has been\nscientifically like studied quite\nextensively and basically what they\nfound is that there are two\nfactors one is conscientiousness and one\nis a neuroticism\nyeah the higher you are in neuroticism\nand conscientiousness the more\nprofessionally successful oh that's\nthat's interesting that makes sense\nwhat are awful little so how do you deal\nwith that because that sounds like a\nvery like desolate piece of the human\ncondition where it's like the more\nneurotic and self judging you are the\nmore successful you become isn't that\nlike kind of awful yes so I think\ndesolate is a beautiful term to describe\ntheir lives so so it's that they they\nhave a lot of success but their life\nfeels empty it's actually a very good\nway to describe their lives so it's so\ngood Michael that I wonder if you have\nexperienced that yet you know for sure\nwhere it's like yeah I've uh I taught\nmyself to it might have been the reason\nI I taught myself to code in high school\nwas um it was worried well the reason\nwas because I needed a job afterwards so\nyou know I mentioned that I picked\nbetween like psych and video editing and\nComp Sci and so I chose Comp Sci and I\ntaught myself how to do it in high\nschool and there was definitely like\nneuroticism behind that like I sat in my\nroom for just like many weeks and months\nand just you know studied one thing and\nthat's surely where that comes from but\nyou know I've you know I've been through\nlike the the gross like nine-to-five and\nall that and it's like like I've\nrealized that you know\njust like working constantly is a very\nbig pitfall you can fall into it's like\nit feels safe but if you just focus only\non one thing it's it's detrimental to\nyou is like a human being\nmm-hm so yeah I can I can agree that\nthat's where some of it comes from I've\nbeen trying to do things different\nthat's actually something I've liked I I\nthink that's on my mind a lot it's like\nthe balance between like doing a lot of\nwork and not doing a lot of work and\nlike being a human being you know mm-hmm\nyeah it's tough and I think I you know\nit's a beautiful word I I'd never really\nthought of it that way but their lives\nreally are desolate and I think that\njust goes to show that I think you\nunderstand more about we're talking\nabout them maybe you know because I\nthink that that you know your ability to\nconjure that word comes from\nunderstanding like if you think about\nlike how do we know what words to use\nmm-hmm so like tons from understanding\nyeah it stems from usually from\nexperience hmm okay so let's just can I\ntry to recap for a second and keep us\nfocused yeah okay so the first thought\nis that there's you know there's\ndifferent kinds of anxiety right so\nthere's like maybe this existential\ndread I'm not even gonna call that\nanxiety for a second there's the\nphysiologic components of anxiety and\nsometimes there are mental there's like\na neurotic kind of anxiety which is\nworrying about the future there is self\njudgment which can sort of feed anxiety\nbut it's not exactly the same as anxiety\nuh-huh so self judgment is kind of\nbeating yourself up and then sometimes\nin that process of beating yourself up\nyou start to worry more about the future\nbecause the more of a piece of [ __ ] you\nare the more bleak the future becomes\nright but interestingly enough so those\ntwo like self judgment and anxiety get\ntogether they tango and the whole is\ngreater than the sum of its parts\nmm-hm so one thing you can do is focus\non self judgment another thing you can\ndo is focus on being in the present\nbecause anxiety is always future\nthinking so if you are thinking about\nthe now you cannot be anxious yeah\nactually that's only true for neurotic\nanxiety if you have physiologic anxiety\nyou can be in the now and it you can\nstill be anxious because it's a physical\nsense\nyeah there's then also we kind of talked\nabout that and then the other thing that\nyou mentioned is that there are ways to\ndeal with it so one way to deal with it\nis you put it as pushing away or\ndistraction great and another way to\ndeal with it is to learn how to sit with\nit let it be a part of you not push it\naway\nand that seems to help so mm-hmm yeah\nsounds like a pretty good summary of\nwhat we've covered no good recap okay so\nnow let's go back to the existential\ndread first of all any questions no no\nno okay\nso let me ask you something how long\nhave you felt the existential dread I\nattached the word existential to it\nbecause that's yeah maybe since probably\nlike around the start maybe the middling\nof high school okay I think it's it\nmight have started with like how am I\ngonna like survive after high school\nbecause I'm very like I seek to be\nself-sufficient I don't like to seek\nhelp a lot so like I didn't I very much\ndidn't want to like rely on anyone after\nyou know becoming an adult getting out\nin the world I need good you know why\nnot then it's just a personality trait I\nhave a you know hard time asking for\nhelp\nokay good aspects and bad aspects to it\nokay so let me ask you something how\nlong have you been self-reliant what do\nwe mean self-reliant so like you said\nhow long have you not wanted to depend\non other people very long very I'd it's\nI've wanted to be self-reliance and for\na long time okay can you tell me when\nyou started to feel that way you know I\ncan't really pinpoint it but it's\ndefinitely like when I look back like a\nlot of the like conflicts I've had like\nlike with parents for example like even\nbefore high school\nweird stemmed from and want to be\nself-reliant right okay\nso surely further back than high school\nlike it's just kind of been like a\npersonality trait that I've you know\nrecognized you know in the in retrospect\ncan I think first\nyeah go for it\nyou\nyou\nwould you say that your existential\ndread kind of feels like worrying that\nyou won't be able to take care of\nyourself um yeah yeah yeah that's a good\nway to put it\nyou\nokay can I have another second to think\nyeah\nyou\nyou\nyou\nI'm trying to figure out what direction\nto go and I won I'm relying on my mind\nto generate some idea of certainty from\nuncertainty do you see multiple paths\nthrough it again\nI do see multiple paths it helps that\nwe've been able to define your\nexistential dread because that's half\nthe problem I didn't think we would get\nthere I think about it a lot now the\nproblem that I have is I feel like I\nknow the answer I just don't know the\nquestion hey you want to lead me\nsomewhere yep right I have a hypothesis\nI just don't know how to investigate it\nokay so the first thing that I want to\nsay is that so we've talked about\ndifferent kinds of ways to deal with\nthis right so there's existential dread\nself-judgement amplifies things right so\nthat's like a multiplying effect there\nare coping mechanisms like distraction\nthere are other sort of coping\nmechanisms like acceptance maybe that's\nnot quite coping unclear whether coping\nis the right word there but there are\nways to deal with people through math of\nit\nmm-hmm there are things that amplify it\nwe still have not gotten to where it\ncomes from and there's another question\nwhich is can we actually yank it out\nroot and stem can we find where this\nfeeling originates and if we find its\norigin does that help us in some way\nokay a lot of questions those like six\nquestions on that sentence yeah I don't\nknow does finding the source of\nsomething mean that it helps I think\nmaybe in some way maybe an understanding\nright sure but you know just cuz you I\ndon't know it's a good example just cuz\nyou know you're the you know the the\nfact that you have a cold doesn't mean\nyou don't have a cold anymore you can\nunderstand it right but you stopped a\ncold yeah I think it helps for\nunderstanding or for treatment right if\nyou know I've yet you have a cold you go\nand get you know sudafed or whatever\nyeah I would agree so so that's why we\nasked the question because let's not\nmake the assumption that discovering the\norigin will fix it yeah one is does it\nhelp uh yeah I think it yes ah hard to\nsay right this is sure it's not a cold\nit's something else I think it's if at\nthe very least it's worth trying to get\nto yeah so so let's do that and let's\nsee let's be scientific so let's not\nmake assumptions that this is going to\nbe helpful maybe it'll help maybe we can\nfind maybe it doesn't have an origin\nmaybe it does we don't know right so you\nkind of said that the existential dread\nis like and this is like you said\nsomething about an anxiety about the\nlong general future of your life it is\nthat also like generally speaking could\nI describe that as worrying about\nwhether you're gonna be able to take\ncare of yourself um in some kind of way\nI like logically I I think with like I\nthink I'll always be able to I even if\nworse comes to worse like I lose I get\nlike everything I don't know I get like\nyou know my credits stolen or whatever I\nthink from the ground up I will be able\nto like come back from just about\nanything great so I think that's a\nreally important point because that\ntells us that that sensation of not\nbeing able or worrying about taking care\nof yourself doesn't come from logic no\nno it's a logical hundred I have\naccepted this absolutely it's I'm at a\npoint where like I I know that I could\nyou know like get a job you know doing\ncomputer science somewhere and it's like\nit's not rooted in logic absolutely not\nyou're still there yep so then we can\nalso acknowledge another interesting\nconsequence of that which is that there\nare parts of our mind that are not do\nnot originate in logic okay so let's go\nback to this so you said that a lot of\nyour conflict with your parents had to\ndo with like your desire to be\nindependent well it's more like I I\nrecognize that I have that desire to be\nindependent and I can go back and see\noh this was you know the this was why we\nhad this conflict and I'm like oh it's\nis because we it's because I wanted to\nbe you know more independent and I\ndidn't give us an example it's it's like\noh okay I'm sure I in high school very\nmuch wanted I decided to do you know\ncomputer science and so I instead of so\nI stopped paying attention to classes in\nhigh school just like kind of just you\nknow I showed up did my thing sometime I\nhave like my computer and I was just\nlike I'm gonna learn one thing it's it's\ncomputer science right so that you know\ncause problems cuz you know your parents\nobviously want you have good grades so\nthat caused a large conflict learn you\nknow we get in touch with a counselor\neveryone's like stop doing this you know\npay attention in school but that's you\nknow that's an example of how I how did\nyou feel when you got taken to the\ncounselor oh you know I was a little\npissed right cuz I'm like man I just\nwant a job after high school like my\nEnglish class isn't really helping me\nfor for job security in the future at\nleast I knew I wasn't gonna be you know\na writer or anything so you know a\nlittle mad but you know I I just kind of\nignored it yeah a little pissed right\nyou know yeah little pisses on you I'm\ntrying to do this thing for job security\nbut I understand like my mom is a first\ngeneration Filipino immigrant my dad is\nhe is very nice but sometimes he's weird\nlike as a person and so like there's not\nalways like a huge level of\nUnderstanding between me and my parents\ncuz I don't know we different\nbackgrounds obviously it's you know we\nstill you know love each other obviously\nyou know but I kind of you know learned\nto accept that we're not always gonna\nsee eye-to-eye on something and I just\nyou know I kept going with what I was\ndoing I was you know [ __ ] you guys I'm\ngonna keep doing\nso now we get to an interesting and my\nmind I have an interesting\nchicken-or-egg question which is like\ndoes the existential dread of worrying\nabout not being able to take care of\nyourself come from your independence or\ndoes your independence come from from\nyeah I don't know how to I'm gonna stop\nthat I I kind of I kind of got what yeah\nI'm picking up what you're putting down\nI don't you mean yeah I know I I have\nthe thought that yeah okay\nand what do you think tick you late\n[ __ ] a long round it doesn't really\nmatter but hmm very hard to say I don't\nknow why they have to be like mutually\nexclusive I think they're related I'm\njust trying to figure out so let me just\nask a different question um you said\nthat your dad is kind of a weird guy and\ny'all have trouble seeing eye on things\nhe's nice\nit's it's like he's a nice guy he is\nnice my dad's nice sure but it's like we\ndo not we're very different people\nmm-hmm I don't know how I became in that\nlike in my family very like strange\nperson and like in my family III thought\nyes yeah but it's just now long have you\nbeen a strange person in your family uh\nyou know pretty is the beginning yeah\nwhat when I say strange it's not like\nit's more like we're just kind of\nfundamentally different people me and\nyou know the other would you say that\nthey don't understand you like to what\nlevel of understanding me as a person I\nI have some level of understanding it's\nmostly they they do care about me that's\nit's that at least I know I'm not I I\ndon't doubt that they're nice that they\nlove you and they care about\nyou've never suggested anything\nsuggesting there's a lot of luck yes\nwell what I see I got to put that\nthere so I don't sound like an [ __ ]\nyeah so so good and I'm sorry I don't\nmean to no III know I'm just I'm just\n[ __ ] uh saying I know what you're\nasking\ni I don't maybe not fundamentally no I\nthink that's the answer you're looking\nfor no yeah I mean it's it's my\nhypothesis but don't just give me the\nanswer I'm looking for it give me the\nanswer that's true no that's the answer\nthat's true I think you got it you got\nit\nokay so let me ask you something what\nhappens to a child who is not understood\nthey they do their own mean they go in\ntheir own kind of adventure yeah and\nthey do go on their own adventure and\nwhat does that mean about reliance on\nother people I think that leads to\nindependence absolutely what does that\nmean about reliance on other people huh\nso so a child who becomes independent\nhow do they feel about relying on other\npeople oh I suppose you don't like it\nright just realize is that yeah I think\nin a way yeah so when you're super\npassionate about something and you're\nconcerned about something and then you\nget taken to a school counselor and\nyou're told that you should stop doing\nwhat you're doing\ndid you feel like they weren't taking\nyour concerns seriously um I don't know\nif it may be on some you know deeper\nlevel not consciously it was I like they\ndon't understand like what I'm going for\nnot consciously but maybe on you know\nlike a some kind of yeah so now we get\nto a basic problem of what we're doing\nso I don't know how much I'm leading you\nor pushing you in a direction cuz it's\nstarting to feel that way and also I\nthink the whole reason that it's not\nconscious like I agree that it's not\nconscious and that's why it's this weird\n[ __ ] feeling of existential dread\nthat you haven't done a conscious\nunderstanding of where it comes from\nwell right so it's it's tricky because\nnow we're getting into the territory\nwhere maybe I'm putting words in your\nmouth because I'm really eating you in a\nparticular\nyou're like hitting the nail on the head\njust right I feel like leading me in a\ndirection exactly\nor if I'm sticking a nail in it it's\nhard for us to tell scientifically right\nyeah yeah absolutely and um but I feel\nlike you know where I'm going and yeah\nwhere do you think I'm going what do you\nunderstand about my line of questions I\nhey well I think your line of\nquestioning is trying to get to the\nconclusion of where the dread comes from\nright yep do you have any sense of what\nmy hypothesis is yeah it's somewhere\nalong the lines is you know different as\na child must provide for themselves or\nnot provide but you know it seeks into\ngreat independence from that\nindependence comes a sense of dread\nbecause you're the only reliance right\nyeah is that kind of where your thinking\nis yes is that how you feel Michael I\ndon't know are you leading me with\nquestions no I'm asking no I don't know\nanymore now ai ai ai ai ai think yes I\nthink okay so let me ask you something\nMichael and I want you to be careful\nabout your logical mind mm-hmm and try\nto tap into your emotional mind Michael\ndo you feel alone sometimes I mean\neveryone does sometimes is that the\nfeeling that we're talking about do you\nfeel like a lot like does the future of\nyour life and I know logically it\ndoesn't include just you but does it\nfeel like it's just you like you're the\nonly person you can count on can count\non from a feelings perspective yes yeah\nI can be honest about that yeah like\nsheer feeling no logic it's like I I\nknow they're like this you know a great\nsupport group around me logically but\nfeelings wise right now it's like I know\nat least I can always count on me right\nyeah so now let me ask you something\nokay so\nnot gonna ask I'm just gonna say okay so\nI'm gonna stop asking leading questions\nbecause I think I don't know how much\nI'm biasing you I don't think I am I\nthink you're pretty good yeah but let me\nlet me run you through my hypothesis and\nwe can look at it as scientists so first\nthing is like who worries about not\nbeing able to take care of themselves\noddly enough you may think that it's\npeople who lack faith in themselves but\nit's funny because that's not where that\ncomes from okay\nthe worry about not being able to take\ncare of yourself is built on an\nassumption that other people are not\ngonna be around as well okay yeah I know\nI follow you\ndoes that make sense yeah that's\nactually where this comes from because\nwhy do you live in a world where you are\nthe only person that you can rely on and\nwe see we see threads of that like in\nyour independence uh-huh like we see\nthat like this is part like I think the\nreason that this existential dread is so\nhard for you to understand is because I\nthink it formed it is it's a primitive\nformation okay and the reason that's\nprimitive is because it was formed when\nyou were very young\nokay so generally speaking when our mind\nforms certain ideas about ourselves that\nidea hairy's the maturity at which it\nwas born\nokay so right so like if I if I sit down\nand I draw a picture at the age of four\nthat picture stays that way\nyeah it's a very young thought it's like\na very carnal thought right absolutely\nconcept right like that like you're just\nlike there's no one and then like if we\nthink about it so then my next thought\nis that okay so you know who is it that\nworries about not being able to take\ncare of themself there's a lack of\nconfidence we don't get any of that from\nyou I mean do you would you say you lack\nconfidence in yourself yes oh yes yeah\ninteresting here yeah\nno I know I come off as like a confident\nperson I'm an incredibly unconfident\nperson okay\nso maybe I just about entirely sohere's\nbecause the reason I asked that question\nis because now we have to we have to\nquestion my assumptions so worrying\nabout not being able to take care of\nyourself comes from two places one is a\nlack of faith in yourself\nokay and the second is a lack of faith\nin others because you're the only person\nthat you can look like I just lack faith\nacross the board sure yeah and and\nthat's what happens to people when\nthey're young they have general swathes\nof beliefs about the way that the\nuniverse works and they those thoughts\nstay that way they stay that way and\nthen as we grow old and we're mature\nlike we have logical things that tell us\nbecause how old are you now Michael\ntwenty-two okay so you're 22 right so\nyou have 22 year-old logic that tells\nyou this is not [ __ ] that you have to\nworry about yeah but there's like five\nyear old Michael who's like I can't\ncount on myself and I can't count on\nanyone else and I think those are\nactually related sick that's badass\nthat's so [ __ ] cool\nhow like I've never really thought about\nthat so do you personally do you ever\nlike replace those thoughts in your head\nlike say you have like a core\nunderstanding about yourself that was\nformed at a very young age do you is\nlike your goal to replace that with the\nlogic of an older smarter you or like\nwhat what do you do about that you\npersonally like do you ever go back and\nyou're like I developed this worldview\nyoung am I going to change it now how\ndoes that work\ncan I ask a question before I answer\nyours yeah sure you said that's badass\nwhich is not the response I was\nexpecting oh it's cool it's that's cool\nI like learning about this okay I like\nit's interesting right what is\ninteresting about that concept of you\nknow you're young and you because I just\ngained a little understanding about\nmyself right that's cool right okay so\nnow now Michael we're gonna rewind a\nlittle bit\nsorry I have a couple more questions I'm\na happy to answer yours okay so don't\nlet me get away from it I got it I'm\nmaking a note so now we get to the\nearlier question which is does\nunderstanding help you remember they\nasked this earlier so you've gained a\nlittle bit of understanding do you think\nit helps yeah yeah for sure okay ma'am\nright do you remember what your earlier\nanswer was it was uncertainty absolute\nyeah so now now we get to an even more\ninteresting question which is how on\nearth are you saying for like like\nliterally ten minutes ago it was\nuncertainty and now your answer is\nliterally for sure\nlet's have that now I have the reaction\nto finding the root of that or or at\nleast so strand of in what way then I\nfeel like you've been helped because you\ndo feel you feel helped yeah well I feel\nyou know a level of understanding which\nis in this case made me feel helped\nright yeah so so let maybe we can\nexplore that down the road but I think\nthat in and of itself is gonna be part\nof your answer so you have to understand\nwhat has changed in you because\nsomething just changed okay that'll help\nus understand like the science of how\nthis [ __ ] works okay okay so we can\ntable that first maybe we can go back to\nthat because we still get to kind of go\nback to existential Venza but if your\nquestion was do I go back and and remap\nthe short answer is like absolutely okay\nso here's the reason why so like when we\nthink about it like so man I just okay\nI've always like wondered how that this\nI call or that you know the the\npsychologist psychologies there\nno this is a call catch-22 oh yeah well\nI think you know you know what I mean by\ndr. kay\nspam spam spam like a little little pep\nog emote okay can I go into teaching\nmode yeah do you understand how the [ __ ]\nworks\nI'll tell you how it works\nokay so it's funny I was teaching this\nlike an hour ago\ngeez huh really\nto whom to our coaches so this is what I\nteach our coaches um oh nice okay so\nwe're gonna try this let's see so you're\na question let me just make sure I\nremember it okay so you're a question\nhold on hold on a second let me just\nthink about what we're saying let me\nthink about how to teach this and help\nyou understand and I may just recap for\nmy own benefit if that's okay\nyeah okay so something you just learned\nsomething so like what just happened and\nthen your question was do I go back and\nlike reanalyze things from the past and\nthen does that help me in some way and\nthe answer is yes okay so here's what\nI'd like to do I'd like to explain like\nhow that works in your mind okay so\nthere's the engineering portion of it\nnot necessarily like the psychology this\nis more about like the science of the\nmind all right so here's my general\nhypothesis about somewhere along the way\nyou grew up and like your parents were\nnot able to like relate to you or\nunderstand you in a way that made you\nfeel quite isolated it doesn't mean they\ndidn't love you yeah yeah and I think we\nsort of hear that when you say like your\ndad was kind of weird all right like\nwhat does that mean that means that like\nit's not that he's weird to you it's\nthat you're weird to him like weirdness\nis like yeah a 2-person yeah yeah yeah\nright so so there's some kind of\nfundamental disconnection where I\nsuspect when you were young and we can\nwe can see if this is the case I mean\nthis is also one of those things that's\nlike it's probably true of everyone but\nso you have to be careful about like\nwhether you have a story like this but\nlike I would suspect that in your past\nthere were several times when you were\nquite young and like people did not\nfundamentally like understand and this\nschool counselors story is a fantastic\nexample because you knew something that\nwas deeply important to you and\nwill told you you were [ __ ] wrong\nthat's how you feel alone when the\npeople who are supposed to help you and\nsupport you and understand the way that\nyou feel tell you that you're [ __ ]\nwrong for feeling that way and you new\nstart so they just don't understand like\nthey just don't understand it and you\njust don't understand that hmm that is a\nworld where everyone speaks a language\nthat you don't speak okay and then the\nworld becomes a [ __ ] scary place and\nthe future becomes uncertain because you\nknow you're gonna screw up at some time\nbut people the reason that people have\nfaith in the future is not just because\nof themselves it's because of the people\naround mm-hmm now the interesting thing\nthere's another interesting so then the\nworld becomes a scary place and it's\nhard to like have faith in the future\nbecause you don't know if you can count\non people like that's what it comes down\nto yeah and the future is filled with\ndread like there's a general dread if\nyou live in a world where you can't\ncount on other people uh-huh\nis that and I'm not trying to put words\nin your mouth so please God say no and\nit was helpful when you said yeah I\ndon't have any confidence in myself but\nlike I mean is that how you feel do you\nfeel like in the future when you think\nabout your future\nis it a multiplayer game or is it a\nsingle-player game I'm not talking about\nwhat you think I'm talking about what\nyou feel I mean I think my world view of\nit is like is that like it's always like\nI can always depend on myself right and\nany supplement to that is just like is a\nbonus right yeah like being able to\ndepend on anyone else is like a great\nbonus but sure it's not something that I\nsee is like like a hugely necessary\nthey're not not necessary no sorry not\nsaying it's like not necessary I want\nother people in my life right yeah\nhere's what I'm hearing\nokay what I'm hearing is it's it's not a\nmultiplayer game it's a single-player\ngame with NPCs ah that makes me sound\nlike an [ __ ]\nyeah so we have to be careful Michael I\ndon't think you're an [ __ ] at all I'm\nsaying that I think that's the way\nyou're describing it right like because\nit's not an [ __ ] it doesn't mean that\nyou don't care about\nother people it doesn't mean that other\npeople care about you it's that there is\na corner of your mind that feels like at\nthe end of the day if other people are\naround and they do nice things for me\nthat's supplemental it's extra but at\nthe core of the being like it's just you\nyeah I think a good way of putting it as\nlike like I don't like there's not like\nI don't rely\nyeah like rely on yes other people first\nsurvival yes I guess bringing it down to\nit's like most big yeah thanks so so now\nwe get to another important point which\nis where do people learn to not rely on\nothers own for survival because\ngenerally speaking that's what we do\nright like we rely yeah as for survival\nyeah so my hypothesis is that this is a\nlearned thing for you for you you\nlearned at some point that you kind of\ncouldn't count on others because I think\nyou were young so you also like you may\nbe a genius and sometimes this happens\nlike I'm not saying that to like you\nknow like make you feel good about\nyourself or anything but like yeah I\nnoticed that so one of my teachers once\ntold me that kids with high IQ or\nactually special needs kids okay think\nabout that that's very interesting\nyou know actually I I'm like inclined to\nagree with you for some people because I\ndefinitely went to school some very\nsmart people who were just different\nright\nlike genius I went to school awesome\nlike really smart people and some of\nthem were like\nIII guess mm not not normal but do you\nknow what I mean like yeah so but others\nwere like like different people you know\nyeah so sorry smart yeah I think I think\nwhat I the point there is that I think\nthat like kids who are smarter or just\nthink different it's not like I mean we\nmake smarter like we place a value\njudgment and I want to steer clear of\nvalue judges I don't think you're a bad\nperson I don't think you're an [ __ ]\nin fact everything that I've heard about\nyou makes you sound like you're a\nwonderful guy and and you know I I don't\nthink that you don't love your parents I\ndon't think your parents love you but I\nthink we have to look at the mind as\nwhat it is and like try to not let our\njudgments interfere with what we see\nyeah and in my experience there are some\npeople who have like I think you're a\nspecial needs kid and I don't mean that\nin a bad way I mean I think you had\nspecial needs growing up like I think\nthat when your program you when you're\nteaching yourself to program in high\nschool because you're worried about a\njob you have some needs that other\n[ __ ] high school kids who are sure\nthat they're gonna be fine for the rest\nof the life don't have okay I'm not\nsaying you're dumb or in fact I think\nthat that's a special need that comes\nfrom I understand what you're trying\nyeah I really do I got it so it's funny\nwhat you put like that no but really\nlike it's like it blew my mind\nwhen they were like and she's like you\nknow smart kids or special-needs kids\nbecause they have special needs you\ncan't treat them like everyone else hmm\nyou know like yeah yeah you try in fact\nif you try to treat them like everyone\nelse which is exactly what your parents\nand your counselor did it's harmful\noh yeah it's a problem i I I think it it\na lot of it boils down to like the way\nthat we perceive what schooling in\ngeneral should be and how it you know I\nI'm sure you have ADD you've had a\nmillion talks about how schooling is\nbroken and it just benefits one type of\nlike learner one type of kid I think a\nlot of that boils down to that because\nI'm not I'm not very good at schooling\nyet personally so the that's that\nthat supports your your idea yeah\nbecause I I did very bad poorly in all\nmanner of school so yeah so I think so\nkind of going back to your earlier\nquestion about okay like what do we do\nabout it right so like like now do you\ngo back and you reprogram things\nabsolutely\nso I'm sorry I'm bouncing around a\nlittle bit is it okay if we go back to\nthat no no it's nothing yeah I go back\nhey it works okay we were trying a new\nformat and I wasn't sure if it was gonna\nwork\nbut thankfully my are like producers and\nour geniuses on the healthy gamer team\noh wow this is great\nokay okay so here's the idea okay so the\nfirst thing is we have different parts\nof our mind okay so the first part of\nour mind is called Manas and so this is\nthe emotional mind\nand it is the part of our mind that\nlikes or dislikes\nand it is the part of the mind that\nreacts okay\nso let me ask you this Michael what's\nwhat's the most recent food that you\ntried for the first time maybe some like\nlike like time was it what's just like a\nnew food that you tried maybe I think it\nwas like eel okay did you like it yeah\nyeah it was pretty good I'm not a big i\nmember picky eater okay but I yeah it\nwas alright okay so let me ask you\nsomething how long did it take you to\nlike it or dislike it um I don't\nremember ever tasting it before this is\nlike my first recollection of trying you\nknow yes good just like just I bit into\nit it was I I don't usually like seafood\nso it had a little barrier to it but it\ntasted good tastes like chicken how long\ndid it take you to like it or dislike it\nfew seconds even that long maybe maybe\none second right so it happened fast and\nrightly mechanically one second yes yeah\nlike like okay so less than one second\nokay and so if we think about you know\nlet's say like so the Manas tends to act\nfence it's the first part of the mind so\nit's usually zero to one second is when\nthe - activates so if we think about\nliking or disliking something there's\nnothing logical about it there's nothing\nrational about it it's just like you put\nit in your mouth and you're like then\nit's good or that isn't good mm-hmm\nsimilarly if we think about emotional\nsituations those two can be kind of you\nknow they tend to be instant so if you\nlike you know someone walks up to you\nand you're in high school and you're\nlike you know someone's been bullying\nyou and you see them in the hallway your\nemotional reaction happens like in less\nthan a second does that make sense yeah\nand so then what happens is like\nsometimes we'll have an emotional\nreaction like you have the sense of\nexistential dread and then sometimes\nyou'll use your rational mind to try to\nfight it okay did that make sense yeah\nso I\nbut the your rational mind is so you say\nyou don't like Seaford\nso did you fight a little battle with\nyourself before you try to ill yeah\nand so what were the two parts of your\nmind how would you kind of describe it\nyou know like a guttural I don't like\nseafood and then uh just try it for head\nits food it's it's you know try\ndifferent foods experience new things\nkind of kind of mean yeah man ate it\nexperience new things\nokay mm-hmm so that the thing to notice\nis that like I like this word got it oh\nsure you're good with words Michael so\nthank you it's cool\nso the modest is kind of guttural it's\nvisceral and it's like reactionary and\nthen our booty which is so this is kind\nof our emotional mind that's the other\nway we can think about it and then our\nbooty is like our analytical mind or our\nintellect\nokay okay so then like you have this\nlittle war where your Manas is like I\ndon't like it and then your buddies like\njust try it man like experience new\nthings come on bro uh-huh and then they\nfight a little war and then depending on\nyou know which one wins you'll either\ntry the eel or you won't try that you\nokay so the interesting thing is like so\nhow well-developed do you think your\nWhoopi is when you're given not not at\nall not absolutely at all how well\ndevelop do you think your Manas is when\nyou're young all the way not not all the\nway but it is in control yep and so else\nyou get older Manas may say roughly the\nsame but would be changes over time okay\nthat's the difference between old and\nyoung mm-hmm\nokay and so the interesting thing is\nthat you know the the thoughts and\nimpressions that are laid down in the\nmind at a young age are gonna be like\nlobe with deep thoughts they're not\ngonna be like nuanced or understood\nthey're gonna be like so the existential\ndread is that like a mana sort of would\nbe thing\nsounds like a Manas thing absolutely\nright so it's like just this like raw\nsort of got a little beautiful word sort\nof sense within you so now I'm going to\nrun you through a couple examples so\nlet's say that so this is my favorite\nexample and I'm trying to come up with\nanother one but we're gonna choose this\none because that's the best one I can\nthink of so let's say that I'm walking\ndown the street with my four-year-old\nand she sees a dog and she pets the dog\nand the the dog kind of turns around\nlike nips at her a little bit\nmmm-hmm what do you think the first\nthing that happened what's the first\nthing that happens in her mind fear dab\nSOG bad right fear don't know okay so\nthat's her - reacts with from zero to\none side and then what's the next thing\nthat happens in her mind dog bad okay\nit's funny I had the same problem\nteaching with this example earlier\nbecause most of the people that we teach\ndon't our kids so what does my dog do\nprobably seeks refuge with her parents\nabsolutely seeks refuge with their\nparents is such a you know\ntwenty-two-year-old thing to say what\ndoes she actually do\ncries and hugs or a father or mother\nabsolutely hogs daddy picked me up\nmm-hmm so this is a thought right she\ntells me daddy picked me up she holds up\nher ops mm-hmm so at this point this is\nactually her booty but it's like not\nvery well developed okay okay and then\nso so then what happens is like I say oh\nyou know like I check her out turns out\nthat you know the dog was just sniffing\nher wasn't actually biting her and then\nshe cries I comfort her a little bit and\nthen I say oh look there's an ice-cream\nshop do you want some ice cream and then\nshe says yes\nten minutes later she's got ice cream in\nher hands and what's going on in her\nmind she is happy with the afternoon\nabsolutely and what kind of thoughts is\nshe having do you think um not about the\ndog absolutely she's just having normal\nthoughts she's telling me about him\nbuying the ice cream you know she's\neating eating the ice cream she's\ntelling me about this picture that she\ncolored she's telling me about like you\nknow how she's like played with the ball\nyesterday just like normal thoughts yeah\nokay so now let me ask you something\nMike Michael where did these feelings go\nthe the feelings about the dog mm-hmm\nare they gone no they probably\nmanifested and some they're probably she\nremembers them right sure like in some\nway she has a fear the next time she\nsees a dog she'll probably been reckless\nexactly right so the next time she sees\na dog so the next day we're walking down\nthe street she sees a dog what happens\nin her mind\nthe dog bit me last time that's not the\nfirst thing that happens in her mind is\nit fear absolutely hmm right so she\nfreaks the [ __ ] out and if you guys have\nlike dealt with kids who are scared of\ndogs\nlike you know it like all they have to\ndo is just see the dog yeah and then\nthey start freaking out there mm-hmm\nright and so the question is like where\ndoes that fear come from from that\nprevious experience so where did the\nfear go between here and here somewhere\nin her head right absolutely so this\ngets stored in her unconscious mind is\nsomething called a sauce sky some sky\nsome sky\nsi M s ka ra so this is a ball of\nundigested emotion okay okay and so now\nlet's think about you so let's say Mike\nMichael you're going down the street and\nyou see a dog and you pet the dog and\nthe dog bites you what's the first thing\nthat happens in your line ow dog bad a\nfear fear fear fear right okay so then\nthen you have a thought your first thing\nis a reaction dog bat and then what\nhappens in your mind\nthe reaction move away from the dog sure\nyou move away you mean after that yep\nwhat comes after that what do you think\nafter you move away from the dog\ndog bad I hate Sherlock okay all right\num I don't know what comes after that so\nlike you may check to see if you're hurt\nokay right and then you may like start\nto think about the situation yes\nlike what kind of thoughts would you\nhave about the situation I wonder whose\ndog that was that I just went up in pet\nand bit me yeah wonder if I need to go\nto the hospital for a rabies shot\nyep um but why did the dog bite me yep\nno lots of thoughts yep and then how are\nyou feeling in ten minutes\nprobably okay I'm probably chillin\nmm-hmm okay and then you're feeling\nfeeling okay great so now\nthe next time you see a dog since I\nprobably since I you know more developed\nI will think that is not the same dog\nunless it is in which case it's an\n[ __ ] and what's what's the first\nthing that happens in your mind oh\nprobably again fear yep and then what\nhappens\nif it's not the same dog I may try to\npet it again okay hold on hold on is it\nthe same dog yeah if it is that's a\nproblem right but that's a thought\nyeah yeah so now like even though you\nget this some degree of fear your\nresponse to it is different right so\nthis is like lower fear got it so the\nquestion is like why does my daughter\nreact with essentially the same amount\nof fear and you react with last year\nthat is your question\nyep my worldview is different from it\nokay so what changes\nwhy is your worldview different from her\nworldview because I understand it's not\nthe same unless it is the same dog in\nwhich case why okay so what do you say I\nunderstand what part of the mind and\nwe're in this process does your\nunderstanding come from the booty right\nis that absolutely trying to go for all\nright so this is also the part of the\nprocess that's different right here\nokay so like what you do here is some\namount of processing okay you like you\nessentially go from fear to feeling okay\nand what's in the middle is this so you\nkind of like process with yourself and\nthen you're kind of like okay maybe I\nshouldn't pet dogs on the street you\nkind of work through the problem and\nthen you're feeling okay and then you\nmay still have a visceral reaction but\nthen you're not gonna like it's not\ngonna be exactly the same\nwhereas for her like this this step it's\nthe ten second to ten minute that I did\nwhat what did I do for her you went and\ngot ice cream afterwards right a\nstructure right so this is processing\nthese are the important questions if you\ndon't have a chance to like sit down and\nthink about what happened to you and\nwhat you did right and what you did\nwrong and what the dog is then you\nwouldn't you may let be left over with a\nsome scar but when you use distraction\nor like a parent you know like you know\ndistracts you from it then that fear\nbasically goes dormant is this some spar\nand then rises up again okay if you\ntreat it with distraction if you treat\nit with distraction and this is what\nwe'll call processing\nokay okay so now we think about now we\ngo back to your earlier question which\nwas do I go back and think about stuff\nthat happened to me when I was young\nabso-fucking-lutely\nokay and what I do as an adult is this I\nadd this step over here um so I recall\nand experience all I'll tell you one so\nthis two makes my dad sound like kind of\nan [ __ ] but he's not nestlé he's a\ngreat guy huh\nso when I was 13 I started a business\nGod and what I did is I started a BBS\nyou know what that is nope so a BBS is\nsomething called a bulletin board system\nso this is in the days before the\ninternet you got a dial-up connection\nand you had a server and what would\nhappen is like people would use their\ndial-up connection to call your house it\nwould connect to your computer which was\na server I mean and your server like you\nhad some persistent thing so people\ncould log on to like my server and they\ncan play different kinds of games they\ncould post on forums they could post\nlike pictures and things like that\nthat's gonna they had to log off but\nonly one user could log on time oh wow\nokay well that's cool all right and\nthat's like the early days of the\ninternet before it was like a persistent\nuniverse like you had to log on to one\nperson server and you had to interact\nwith them yeah yeah and so I ran a BBS\nand I charged people $10 a month which\nwas a ridiculous amount of money back\nthen for access to my BBS and I had like\n13 people\nI started $10 a week and then I had 13\npeople that would be like users on my\nBBS and I was making 130 bucks a week\nback in like 19 like 94 or something so\nafter a couple and the interesting thing\nso I was lucky enough to have parents\nwho were wealthy and so I never really\nlike needed money for anything like I\nnever had an allowance or whatever my\ngrades were good I got whatever I wanted\nmy grades were bad I didn't get whatever\nI wanted all I ever wanted was video\ngames so it was like sort of simple I\nwasn't like period materialistic I just\nyeah and so I had kind of like Tiger\nparents who were like sort of like yeah\nyou can't play games unless you're\nyou're great you're gonna do so I think\nselected ton up like so I knew money was\ngood but I don't really have any use for\nmoney so I just the wad of cash I'm like\nhundreds of dollars just like sitting\nsomewhere not like I did it but one day\nlike my dad found\nand then like he comes to me he's like\nwhat is this and then I told him that\nIvan started a business and then he said\ncan you any idea what he said how did he\nask if you were selling drugs yeah so I\nexplained what the business was good\nyeah okay and he was not impressed with\nthe business yeah so it's funny right so\nactually I think he was impressed and he\nstill shot it down he was like I\nshouldn't be doing this right now you\nshouldn't be focusing on your studies\nbut I remember now that he was kind of\nsmiling when he said it because he could\ntell that I was a clever kid but he\nstill shut it down and he took my money\naway the money you had no value to me\nbut he took it away and so I was like\nokay well I guess like you know whatever\nhmm and so years later I I was I guess I\nstill AM so I was a faculty at a\nparticular academic institution and\nthere was someone at the academic\ninstitution who had been very supportive\nfor me so they had actually been like\nsupportive to me when I was a medical\nstudent and they even like you know were\nsupportive to me in terms of figuring\nout where I went to become a\npsychiatrist and so they really like\nthey've been nothing but nice and then I\nhad started to develop something at a\nhospital that I was at that was like\npretty good and pretty robust and was\ndoing very well\nand for some reason I became paranoid\nthat like this person was gonna try to\ntake credit for it and it was really\nreally bizarre but like it's like it's\nwhat worried me and I was I was going\nthrough some training slash and part of\nthat training was to kind of be in my\nown therapy and so I was I was talking\nwith someone who's who is a therapist\nand we were kind of talking about\nthey're like okay so just pick something\nso that you know we can work on it and I\nsaid okay well this is what's bothering\nlike I'm afraid that this guy's gonna\nlike take credit for my work and as we\ndug into it I realize like this is\ncompletely idiotic the guy has done\nnothing but be supported for years why\non earth do I think that he's gonna take\nsomething that's mine and what we kind\nof came down to is like oh I have this\nsome scar are people who are like\npositive figures in my life taking away\nI have built I and it's really bizarre\nbecause like no one had ever triggered\nthis before because the person has to be\nlike in order for my mind to associate\nthis situation with what happened to me\nin the past\nuh-huh like they have to meet certain\nrequirements right like it can't be a\ncat it has to whoa yeah yeah it needs a\nbit like a like your father like someone\nyou trust no exactly someone I trust\nsomeone who cares about me and I'm\nbuilding something that is wildly\nsuccessful and then they're gonna take\nit away because this is what happens cuz\nthat's how the brain learns mm-hmm\nbecause my brain learned hey when these\nthings happen you get [ __ ] so watch\nout because you're gonna get [ __ ] and\nso now we get to your question which is\ndo you go back and do you analyze it and\nthe answer is absolutely okay because if\nyou want your source of existential\ndread to go away I'm glad you feel\nhelped by it\nokay I'm gonna switch back to the other\nlayout do you have questions about this\nformat or\nlike anything that were mad I mean sorry\nquestions about the diagrams or any of\nthose terms or anything\nsorry I've we've been using diagrams oh\n[ __ ] man I just I'm watching you talk\nabout your subs guys the last 25 likes\ncool all over Oh see there's a soft\nstart what Dyke okay here let me show\nyou oh god I'm so sorry Mike come on let\nme do this oh god I screwed up hold on\nokay hold on I will rectify it oh [ __ ]\nso everyone watching at home knows this\nbecause I've been doing diagrams okay\nI'm glad that they got this okay sure\nthis okay there I've been writing I've\nbeen taking down oh wow okay so let me\nlet me run through this real quick okay\nlet's let's catch up my politics can you\nsee this now it's fine yes I can see\nthis okay okay well thing okay\nso here's the first thing so between\nzero and one second you know the -\nhappens first\nso it's emotional it as likes and\ndislikes it reacts its guttural the\nbooty is analytical and it this was kind\nof the war that we talked about between\noh you don't like seafood and then you\nwere telling yourself just try it yeah\nokay\nso then we get to the first scenario\nwhich is my daughter so this is daughter\nmm-hmm so in the first second between\nzero and one second we have - okay so\nthis is - and then we have thoughts\nafter that so this is where would the\nactivates okay wow dude you're a boss if\nyou were following this without seeing\nthe diagrams you know it might have been\neasier like I'm not I'm not great at\nlooking at diagrams okay I kind of like\nthe personal rhetoric style sure okay so\nthen what happens is distraction right I\ngive her ice cream and then she's happy\nand then what happens is this fear lives\nin the some unconscious as a some scar\nand that it emerges the next time we see\na dog right and in your case this part\nis the same this part is the same but\nthen you're booed these steps in in this\ncritical step and helps you process and\nthen you end up feeling okay and then\nthe next time you see a dog you still\nhave that reaction but then you don't\nfreak out again because you've sort of\nprocessed some of that emotion so\nthere's some scar is smaller\nokay got it does that make sense yeah\nokay we're gonna go back to this and\nthen we're gonna do this and then we're\ngonna do this okay sorry about not\nshowing you the diagram it's not as fun\nso you asked me a question do I go back\nand re-examine things that happen to me\nin my life and the answer is absolutely\nyes\nokay can you and what happened back to\nyourself huh I'm just looking at myself\nright now\noh very introspective mirror cut I'm\nsorry I think so now what what I would\nencourage you to do is to think a little\nbit about like you know where this sense\nso this is what you've got to do is like\ngo bet I can\nthink about like times in your life\nwhere you felt a lot and you felt like\nthe only person you could rely on was\nyourself mm-hmm because I can I would\nbet money that that's the way that you\nfelt when you got walked into the\ncounselor's office\nyeah I'm sure yeah right yeah and and so\nlike that strengthens the some scar\nthat's like you being bit by the dog the\nsecond time and so the reason that your\nfeeling of existential dread is so\npervasive is because you've been bit by\na dog hundreds of times okay and so\nyou're some scar is quite large now and\nyou have it lives with you all the time\ndoesn't even need a trigger it's just\nlike there all the time okay and I'm\nsure you can imagine that if you've been\nbit by a dog hundreds of times you don't\neven need to see a dog to feel anxious\nabout nothing yeah it's just like there\ncould be a dog yeah and and so I would\nencourage you to think back like you\nknow can you imagine can you remember\nthe first time that you felt like your\nparents like you couldn't count on your\nparents and I know we're making him\nsound like [ __ ] I'm not saying\nthey're [ __ ] I know my dad was a\ngood person but everyone winds up with\nsome scars that's just how it works it's\nbecause our mind is not well formed\nmm-hm can't thing back that I don't know\nI get I had a similar experience to you\nwhere I started a small business not as\nsmart I was selling sodas at school but\nthey shut that down very similar\nactually I don't think that's it though\nI don't know I can't think back to so\ntell me about your dad being weird\nhe's just he's funny in social\nsituations with other people\ndefinitely\nhe's a you know like is he funny with\nyou when you say what do you mean by\nfunny\nwhatever you mean by fun what do I mean\nby funny yeah he said he's funny with\nother people in social situations I like\nwhat about like I don't think he he's\nnot very good at social norms like when\ntalking to people okay okay that's\nthat's what I mean by funny um yeah\nthat's what I mean by weird it's not\nlike now I'm never gonna social queues\nokay okay oh it's not in the way I think\nokay so that's a whole other\nconversation so I think that makes sense\nin terms of some of your self-reliance\nbecause it sounds like there may be some\nso a lot of confidence comes from\nempathic mirroring okay so if we think\nabout something else to mirror from huh\nlike from something else\nmirror yeah so like the way that a child\nlearns to move confidently in the world\nbasically has to do with how secure they\nfeel with their parents and how secure\nthey feel with their parents depends\nroughly on how much their parents impact\nlike a mirror their emotions okay so\nwhen when a child like like like the\nworld is a safe place when I bump my\nhead and I hurt and my parents run over\nand scoop me up and express concern then\nthe world like becomes a safe place\nbecause when I'm hurt there are people\nthere that express concern and like that\nmakes sense because the world reacts the\nway that I feel\noh that sort of makes sense yeah yeah\nabsolutely and and so a lot of times\nconfidence happens when conference\nproblems happen when there are parents\nwho can't mirror what a child's\nemotional needs are because then the\nworld becomes a confusing place where\nshockingly the only person you can rely\non is yourself\nuh-huh because the rest of the world\ndoesn't get ya the rest of the world\ndoesn't react the way you feel yeah I\nsee what you mean and so then you become\na pillar it becomes a single-player game\nand you can't count on other people\nokay so I wonder a little bit about you\nknow whether that plays into this\nbecause you're saying that your dad\ndoesn't like pick up on social cues so\nalso then yeah I mean unclear it's just\nanother piece that could contribute yeah\nso that by the way is attachment theory\nif you're interested in reading like\nattachment theory sort of talks about\nlike how security from a child comes\nfrom empathic mirroring of parents\nthat's that arresting okay yeah so in\nterms of practically what do you so\nquestions for me actually let's start\nthere no not really\nokay so let me try to give you like so\nyou're one of your questions is like\nokay maybe I don't know if this is only\nyour question but what do I do about it\nokay yeah that's a good standard yeah\nyeah so I would say that you know try to\nnotice that feeling of X is Central grad\nwhenever it's there and find out first\nof all analyze it with your would be\nbecause the more you analyze it with\nyour buddy I mean not just accept and\nsometimes analysis involves like sitting\nwith it too but really like re\nexperiencing it and then like be a\nshepherd for yourself okay so imagine\nthat there's like six year old Michael\nor 13 year old Michael who's getting\ntaken into the counselor's office mm-hmm\nand imagine the way that you felt and\nthen imagine that there's like\ntwenty-two year old Michael who's like\nolder and can be reliable and if nothing\nelse if you can't rely on anyone else\nyou can at least rely on 22 year old\nMichael okay yeah and 22 year old\nMichael is like gonna go back and tell\n13 year old hey man like I know a lot of\npeople don't understand you bro and I\nknow you feel alone and isolated but\nlike it's okay and you're gonna be okay\nand you don't have to be alone in this\nworld and there are people that love you\nmm-hmm okay how do you feel about that\nI like that like being your own kind of\npillar to mirror back on yeah yeah okay\nI like this so when you think about when\nyou feel that way that feeling of\nexistential dread see if you can do that\nwith yourself or see if this feeling\nreminds you of something in your past\nokay\nand then sit down and like think through\nit in that way okay\nokay and then if you do that over time I\nthink what's gonna happen is the feeling\nof existential dread will get back okay\nlike this and my hope is that for them\nyou don't have to feel that way all the\ntime every yeah be nice yeah and then\nthe last thing that I'll point out is\nthat I don't know exactly how you had\nthat moment of feeling helped and then\nyou said for sure it helps I don't know\nwhat that was but I think if you\ncontinue doing this it'll result in more\nof whatever happened for just a fraction\nof a second mm-hmm that's the way you\ncultivate more of those responses and\nyou're sure it helped like user like\nyou're like yeah for sure and then as\nyou do that for a while I don't know\nexactly how it works but it helps and\nthen one day you're gonna wake up and\nit's like not gonna be that big of a\ndeal okay I like this right yeah\nhow you feel yell I'll try that out not\nfeeling good yeah okay also if you if\nyou need some guidance and this kind of\nthing so the other thing is that that\nyou know that emotional processing that\nWoody does therapy also basically works\non that principle mmm so it's one of the\nways so the other thing you can think\nabout is is if you huh helping you\nprocess yeah so it like that's how that\nmodel of the mind like that's how I\nunderstand what therapy is doing okay so\nyou can also think about seeing a mental\nhealth professional depending on how bad\nit is okay I mean I I consider I'm\ndespite that I'm a generally pretty\nhappy person yeah I can tell you assam\num but maybe i mean if it if it helps I\ncould consider it I'll you know try it\non my own first\noh yeah just think the recommendation\nyeah\nany other questions for me or thoughts\nnot really I mean I'd yeah I enjoyed the\ntalk like cool very insightful learned a\nlot it's interesting sometimes I people\nhow to meditate are you interested in in\ndoing that today\nsure yeah I I've tried meditation before\nI I don't know like what are there\ndifferent types of meditation yeah\nbecause I've done the one where you just\nlike try to empty all thoughts and just\ntry and be completely present mm-hmm\nthat and that's the one I've tried\nbefore it's nice okay do like a\ndifferent kind of one yeah I do a lot of\ndifferent kinds of meditation depending\non what the goals are okay so there are\nsome meditations that are more cognitive\nsome meditations that are more physical\nsome meditations that are more\npsychological some meditations that are\nmore spiritual okay what do you\nrecommend what are you what do you want\nwhat do you want to be different about\num I think I think acting being in the\npresent more would definitely help\nbecause I act a lot in the past and in\nthe you know thoughts of the future so\nsomething to help you be in the present\nokay are you up for doing something\nthat's a little bit more physical sure\nare you okay feeling a little bit silly\nown stream yeah my like pork on the like\nkind of like a one of those what is that\nnothing nothing\nyeah no we'll go for it okay so I'm\ngonna ask you to push your your chair\nback sir and I'm gonna ask you to stand\nup I'm gonna take off my headphones okay\nokay can [ __ ] hear that Kenny I can't\nhear you but that's okay can you hear me\nokay so I want you to close your eyes\nokay all right\njust stand up straight\nand now I want you to your mind to just\ngo where it goes so I start thinking\nabout the past start thinking about the\nfuture\nI'm really thinking about I think about\nwhat you're gonna be doing next I still\ncan't hear you but what I would be being\nsoon ok so just think about the future\nthink about the past think about what\nyou're gonna do later today think about\nwho you're gonna see\nnow I want you to open your eyes and\nlook at me okay now I want you to do\nthis raise your arms above your head\nokay and then I want you to take your\nright foot and put it above your right\nknee good and now I want you to close\nyour eyes and think about who you're\ngonna see later okay so go ahead and\ncome back down so and as you adopt the\nposition so now we're gonna do it again\nyou can try with the left foot please\nyou dock the position I want you to know\nthat set your mind it's gonna force you\ninto the crust okay you're not going to\nbe able to think about other pests okay\nso let's try again just try to maintain\nthe position\nyou can open your eyes open your eyes\nopen your Eska and focus\nwhat are you thinking about balancing\nyeah he can't [ __ ] hear me why am I\ntalking that's fine\nI can't I can't hear when you speak like\nthat but yeah so just just notice what\nyou're thinking about right yes I feel\nthe present I feel pretty focused on\nright now it's hard to do this and not\nbe focused on right now okay we can't\nhear you but that's okay oh I know okay\nso go ahead and come on that okay so so\nnow all right what were you thinking\nabout when you were bowed out about\nbalancing I was thinking about balancing\nso now I'm gonna ask you an interesting\nquestion so were you actually thinking\nabout balancing or were you focusing on\nbalancing what's the difference that's\nthat's what I mean so like when I'm\neating food I can think of better eating\nfood or I can actually just enjoy the\nfood uh-huh did that make sense yeah\nyeah the difference what are you like\nthinking like oh this is me balancing\nwere you just like your attention I was\ndoing the act of balancing yes so that's\nhow you come to the present because you\ncan't be in the past of the future when\nyou're doing that yeah if you try\ndifficult things so I had to be focused\non it yes okay and so the easy mode is\nwith your eyes open so your your sense\nof balance comes from three neurological\nparts it comes from your vestibular\nsystem which is in your ears it comes\nfrom your eye and it comes from your\ndorsal columns or your proprioception or\nyour sensation of like position in space\nokay positioning yeah I got it okay so\nthe interesting thing is that if you\nclose your eyes it becomes more\ndifficult to balance because you're\nlosing yeah you're not focusing on one\nspot you're losing one of those three\nrays yeah so it becomes hard so at the\nbeginning if you need to balance with\nyour eyes open\ngo for it and then at some point you're\ngonna get good at it and then your mind\nwill start to wander and you won't need\nto focus anymore\nand when your mind starts to wander\nclose your eyes and then it'll become\nharder okay so in general I think\nMichael for whatever reason I feel like\nmaybe body is a good\nfor you to focus in the present so I'll\nalso tell you like do you out do you do\nyoga done yet no I do not okay so I\nthink about maybe learning yoga and the\nreason to learn yoga is because yoga is\nnot about like it's not about physical\nhealth the reason that yoga was\ndeveloped is because when you do a yoga\nposture it's not about how much you\nstretch it's about focusing your mind on\nthe present so the reason that people do\nyoga is because when they do yoga\nproperly you can't think about anything\nelse just about yoga yes and so what you\nwant from yoga is a position that is\nstable and brings your mind to the\npresent and that way if you have a\nposition that you can hold for 10\nminutes and it brings your mind to the\npresent then you can be in the present\nfor 10 minutes and it's like op2 just\nuse your body to force yourself to do\nthat you don't have to have to worry\nabout emptying your mind like you you\ncan you can try as hard as you want you\nto think about stuff and you won't be\nable to okay that's that's cool yeah\nthat's very interesting I never I didn't\nrealize yoga was\ndeveloped with that intent yep that's\ncool you can also do like other things\nlike you can just go like this I'll try\nit out and then if you just hold this\nfor a while soon like you can think\nabout things but as your arms get tired\nthey're gonna start to demand your\nattention no just hold but using your\nbody to force attend yeah just just hold\nit for a while and at some point your\nbody's gonna be like hey put our arms\ndown and you're gonna be like nope not\nyeah and then you're gonna be focused on\nso just focus on that sensation you\nwon't be able to think about anything\nelse all right\nJanet's my exercise is therapeutic\nthat may be different but that's alright\nyeah I'll try it out any last thoughts\nor questions before we wrap up Michael\nReaves no I think is pretty fun\nproductive enjoyed talking thank you for\nthe appreciate it having me on yeah man\nthanks for coming on and Mars yeah man\nI'm I'm a big I like you a lot\nthank you have you ever when you're\ntalking about the ear thing then inner\near for balance have you ever seen those\nyou can stimulate the inner ear with\nelectrodes to make a person balance to\none side or not so you can you can you\ncan send electrical signals through the\nvestibular system to like manipulate\nbalance it does just a fun tidbit I I\nthought of what you were talking about\nyeah that makes sense\nso so usually like under neurons\ntransmit electricity yeah and and\ngenerally speaking when we come to\napplied neuroscience you know you can\nstimulate different parts of the brain\nwith electrodes to do all kinds of stuff\nso yeah that's that's cool yeah as a\nlittle tidbit you can just like buy\nthose [ __ ] cool yeah odds are that\nyou might be interested in sticking\nelectrodes in your ear does that sound\nlike a good idea it's not yeah I\nappreciate you taking the time to talk\nwith me yeah man thanks for coming on\nand thanks for being open and honest and\nand present man I appreciate it yeah of\ncourse thank you and good luck to you\nand you don't have to fear the future\nany other people around thanks you'll be\nokay bro\nall right take care is it you as well\nright\nall righty"
