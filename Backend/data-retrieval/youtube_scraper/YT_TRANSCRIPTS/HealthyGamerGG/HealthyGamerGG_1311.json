    "transcript": "Natalia okay yeah great so Natalia tell\nme a little bit about how you're doing\ntoday and what we're talking about okay\num I'm super nervous because I'm\nprobably gonna cry because like okay um\nso me too nice\nyeah yeah I like I cry a lot I really is\nthank you about cries to make me cry so\nI think it's gonna be tears um is it\nokay to cry yeah I cry all the time so\nyeah I'm not embarrassed of crying\nanymore I guess\nokay um but yeah I've just been having\nlike a really difficult time lately and\nI think I wanted to talk about mainly\nlike two things that okay maybe overlap\na little bit sure\nokay so the first part is um I'm bipolar\nokay um I've been diagnosed for about\nlike four years okay right I've\nstruggled with like mental health issues\nmy whole life okay\num I had an eating disorder when I was\n14 okay um\nand I I got was 50 kilos before and by\nthe time I was 16 I was 23\nso yeah I was pretty rough\nI nearly died and I recovered from that\nat about 16 and then I was bulimic from\n16 til about 22 no until about like\nthat's not true okay I was I was like a\ntype of bulimia I don't really want to\ntalk about it but I was sure one type of\nbulimia until 22 and I'm from 22 to like\n25 I was a different type of bulimic and\nthen um in 2017\nthat's 2016 that's when I got diagnosed\nbipolar and when I started my medication\nmy bulimia actually went away okay um\nyeah so sorry like your you have\ntreatment providers right now that\nyou're connected with them yeah I've\nbeen on remission like I saw my\npsychiatrist for like a whole year\noh gosh the one that diagnosed me\nbipolar and I am oh she put me on\nremission after a year because I was\npretty stable\num I take lamotrigine take 100\nmilligrams a day okay so yeah I have a\nlike I think it's type 2 so I cycle\nreally quickly\nah really really really really really\nquickly I sometimes have to hypomanic\nepisodes within a month and then to\ndepressive episodes within a month my\nmedication has been really good at like\nkeeping my depression to like just a few\ndays so I can manage that way but my\nissue mostly is with my hypomania\nbecause I become very impulsive and\nsometimes I like become a little like\nmean I which is so not me okay um and I\nsometimes like I wouldn't say I become\nlike aggressive but I become like it's\nnice\nsnippy like I say things that I don't\nmean saying to people and I do like very\num\nlike abrupt things that I don't think\nabout doing does that make sense\nsure um I have like really racing\nthoughts and sometimes it feels like\nlike especially when I'm asleep at night\nit feels like my body is like\nlike my body is asleep but my mind isn't\nasleep like it feels like my mind is\njust like racing all the time so that's\nlike my main issue right now it's like\ndealing with the consequences of the\nthings that I do when I'm hypomanic um I\nstart a lot of things that I don't\nfinish and I started a lot of projects\nthat then I don't want to do and so like\nhmm that causes some issues and then the\ninterplay of that within my stream and\nlike\ninternet culture in general\nso that's kind of what I'm struggling\nright now like I think that my bipolar I\nhave it under control but the stress of\nmy job is making it really difficult to\nhandle okay so thank you so much for\nsharing all that that's all yeah so let\nme just start by offering kind of a\ncouple of perspectives so the first\nthing is you know I think we a lot of\npeople have been asking important\nquestions about whether what we do on\nstream is is therapy or not therapy or\nmental health treatment so I just want\nto make it clear so you have providers\nso I'm not going to comment on the\nmanagement of your bipolar disorder\nwhether you have bipolar disorder things\nlike that's that I think is about you\nknow that's medical and I'm glad that\nyou have people with that that can help\nyou with that I think what I would like\nto talk to you about is is I think this\nis actually a perfect example of how I\nstill think I can help you because I\nthink there could be stuff going on here\nthat is actually not bipolar disorder\nokay so if we think about like like so\nwhat I really try to do here on stream\nis help people understand how their mind\nworks and and what I'm hearing from you\nis that sometimes your mind acts\nimpulsively that you exhibit means\nbehaviors and in my experience I think\nthat meanness and impulsivity don't have\nto come from bipolar disorder\ndoes that make sense but I am so not\nlike that sometimes yep I understand\nthat there are fluctuations within your\nmood I'm not blaming you for it but what\nI'm saying is that adjusting your\nmedication may not be the only way to\nimprove that because all of us are mean\nor impulsive at times and there may be\nsomething going on with bipolar disorder\nthat makes you act more mean or\nimpulsive but it's a dangerous\nassumption to us to assume that that is\njust bipolar and in my experience if you\nthink about regulating your impulses or\nunderstanding where mean this comes from\nthat's something that all human beings\ncan do and improve those things and just\nbecause you're bipolar doesn't mean\ndo those things too it just means that\nthose things may be harder for you to do\nif you have by far does that make sense\nyeah no I understand that but the thing\nis like what I'm mostly struggling right\nnow and and like I think that I've been\nable to like grow and change a lot to\nget a point with like um I I do yoga and\nI meditate awesome um and I'm becoming\nlike a very spiritual person cool and\nit's helped me a lot to deal with it but\nmy biggest issue is with this eight\nyears of recordings that exists on the\nInternet of my past and the past\nexperiences that I've had and people\njudging me everyday by those things okay\nso let's talk that that sounds like it's\nreally really hard to deal with because\nmost human beings get to make mistakes\nright and they get to make mistakes and\nthey get to learn but when you have\neight years of recordings of your\nmistakes sometimes you're not allowed to\nmake mistakes in the same way or you\nnever get to like really move past them\nis that is that kind of what's going on\nwith you is yeah it's like I get to make\nthe mistakes every single day again and\nagain and again and again what does that\nmean can you help me understand well\nbecause people comment on them all the\ntime so I have to like relive them so\nsometimes it feels like\nevery single day I'm reliving all those\nmoments okay so it sounds like you're\nnot really they're not letting you move\npast it and you're kind of being\nreminded every day of the mistakes that\nyou made yeah what's that like\nit's a horrible\nit's horrible because I'm trying to grow\nand be better but\nit feels like\nokay I I can't move on that's how it\nchilled yeah I mean it sounds like you\ncan't move on because people keep on\nreminding you and bringing you back\nthere I mean I can't imagine I mean I I\nreally don't think that that's like\nsomething you're doing wrong it sounds\nlike you know if I have so sometimes I\nyou know deal with people who suffered\nfrom abuse and and you know I I remember\nI mean I've heard this story like a\nthousand times about you know a kid who\ncomes home and they've got a bad grade\non a report card and like one of their\nparents starts yelling at them or\nhitting them the next day they come home\nand they hear the same thing like the\nreport card like they have the bad grade\nand every day they're just reminded of\nit over and over and over and over again\nyeah even if the kid is studying more it\ndoesn't matter if they're studying\nharder or working harder they're being\nmore if they're if they've actually made\nsteps to improve like the parent just\nkeeps on beating the crap out of them\nsounds like that's what you're going\nthrough yeah and like generally I've\nI've been good at dealing with it I mean\nI've been dealing with us for two years\nnow\nweird literally every stream half the\nmessages I get are about that where\nevery single Instagram I post half the\nmessages are about that where every\nsingle tweet I posed 90% of the messages\nare horrible hateful things I get\nmessages every day from people telling\nme to kill myself that I'm a [ __ ] that\nI'm the worst thing that's ever happened\nto twitch um and like it's not just one\nit's not just two it's thousands of\nthousands every single day um and I\nsometimes I'm good sometimes I can\nhandle it but then some other times I\ncan do you know I'm so Natalia I'm\nreally kind of shocked by that and I'm\nI'm really kind of wondering like where\ndoes all that hatred come from do you um\nlike why do they hate you so much like I\nfind it hard to believe that unless\nyou're committing genocide that you know\nyou were deserving of thousands of\npeople just\nI don't know\nsometimes I feel like if I was like in\nprison it would be easier\nwould be easier about present that at\nleast impress it and be like I'm getting\nto pay for my mistakes in a way in which\nI can move on it should get better and\nwork in myself but up it feels right now\nthat I'm like in hell\nyou know we're like every single day for\nthe rest of my life I'm gonna have to\ndeal with that and like it feels like my\nonly option is to just get up social\nmedia completely but the problem is I\nhaven't done anything else with my life\nlike I I quit college for for twitch and\nso like I would have to let my house go\nI would have to let my pets go you know\nlike it's just not an option for me to\nlike go do something else you sound like\nyou're stuck yeah I it's also shocking\nto hear you know someone say something\nlike I almost wish I could be in prison\nbecause it sounds like if if there was\nsomething what I'm hearing from you is\nif there was something you could do to\nshow the people who hate you that you're\ntrying to atone or you're paying your\nprice or whatever then you would do it\nbut what I'm hearing from you is that\nyou know if they're telling you to kill\nyourself there's really nothing you can\ndo to like appease them right it's like\nthere's no it's impossible\nlike what are they looking for from you\nI can't imagine what would actually\nsatisfy them\nwell I killed myself and I thought about\nit so many days so many times so I am I\nalready had a plan on how I was gonna do\nit okay or you know or your providers\naware of that No okay can we talk for a\nsecond about that mm-hmm\nwhat keeps you from sharing that then I\nhaven't really seen like my psychiatrist\nis like 2017 okay so maybe give them a\ncall and kind of let them know what\nyou're going through because I know as a\npsychiatrist one of the things the the\nmost difficult thing about my job is\nwhen I'm there to help someone and they\ndon't let me know that they need help\nand and so if you're going through this\nstuff I would strongly strongly\nrecommend that you reach out to your\npsychiatrist and kind of let them know\nthat something is going on it doesn't\nnecessarily mean that they're gonna\nchange your medication or anything like\nthat I mean I'm not gonna be able to do\nit because my friends literally like\nthey chased me around everywhere what do\nyou like my friends don't let me be\nalone cuz they know you're talking about\nyou're not gonna be able to kill\nyourself yeah okay well I'm not i I'm\nnot like I'm not left alone ever\nokay so sorry that's reassuring and also\nwhether you're left alone or not I think\nis actually like besides the point\nbecause the point here is that you're\nsuffering and there may be things that\npeople can do for you or that you can do\nfor yourself to suffer less and I'm not\ntalking about winning over the hateful\npeople what I'm talking about as you\nsaid you're becoming more spiritual so\nlike in a weird way I think this is a\nconversation about meanness hatred\npurpose how do you find a way to move\nforward how do you deal with the hate of\nother people because like I there's\nsomething that sounds to me I just don't\nthink I can do it anymore I don't think\nI can handle what they hate anymore\nyeah so that makes sense to me that you\ncan't do that because I'm actually\nshocked that you've been able to do it\nthis long like this sounds insane to me\nlike how have you been able to do it\nthis long\nI don't know I guess I've been really\nstrong for a very long time hmm and then\nlike I just hit a point where it so many\nthings happened like one after the other\nand then I just I don't know okay yeah\nso what I'm asking you to do is lean on\nthe people whose job it is to help you\nthrough this kind of thing so I'm not\nI'm not so I'm not saying that like\nreaching out to your psychiatrist is\nseparate from your friends not letting\nyou feel a lot like the point here is\nlike if they're not gonna let you kill\nyourself that's great that's wonderful\nthat's awesome and at the same time it\nis by belief that you don't have to feel\nthis way at least this much yeah anymore\nand yet there going to be people around\nmyself included who can try to help you\nunderstand you know how to think about\nyourself how to move forward and I think\none of the important people in your life\nis going to be your psychiatrist and\njust let them know what's going on okay\nand probably go see them because so hard\nto explain to anybody what I'm dealing\nwith\nthe doesn't know twitch and doesn't know\nsocial media yeah so so that's it you're\nspot on it is very hard to explain it\nbut yeah this is this is where my\npsychiatrist just like I don't know like\n50 years old like how do I explain to\nher why this is affecting me so much I\nso here's the thing you gotta give him a\nchance to understand okay and here's the\nthing\nso Natalia I think this is really\nimportant if you can think about other\npeople in this moment I know this is\ngonna sound bizarre but I I think the\nworld would be a better place the world\nwould be a better place if you told your\npsychiatrist now why is that it's\nbecause 50 year old psychiatrists are\ngonna practice for another 20 years and\nunless people like you try to explain it\nto them they're not gonna get it and if\nthey get it think about how much more\nthey would be able to help all of the\nother patients that they're seeing do\nyou think you're the only person and in\nthis person's practice that's dealing\nwith hate from social media your hate\nmay be way worse than everyone else's\nbut I can guarantee you because I\na [ __ ] psychiatrist and people come\ninto my office social media is tearing\neveryone apart and so in a weird way if\nyou can I think it's almost like if you\ncan afford if you have any bandwidth\nleft to try to make the world a better\nplace which I don't blame you for if you\ndon't because it sounds like you're\nrunning on empty you know talk to your\nmental health provider and it's try to\nexplain that with them and if they don't\nunderstand they don't understand and\nthen maybe you try to get a referral for\na therapist who's younger or something\nlike that and I'm happy to help you try\nto problem-solve about you know trying\nto find you good help if you know with\nyour psychiatrist and things like that\nif you need help but I would strongly\nencourage that you know you because you\njust it's not fair for you to deal with\nthis [ __ ] because it sounds like you're\ndealing with the [ __ ] alone do like who\nsupports you during this time like for\nthe past two years like who do you have\nin your corner yeah not a lot of people\nI have to like really close friends and\nthat's pretty much it yeah I have a\nreally good community like I have a lot\nof people that love me you know like I\nhave I have a pretty strong community\nthat like shares a lot of love so that\ndoes help and I I loved streaming I love\nsharing my life and my love for life\nwith people but and like this whole time\nI was just telling myself that I if I\nhold on for a little longer things will\nget better so that oh that's a good\nthought to have and what I would like to\nhelp you do today Natalia is not hold on\nuntil things get better but let's try to\nthink about how we can make them better\nokay right so there are going to be\nfluctuations over time which is\ncompletely normal but if you're getting\na lot of hate from the internet how can\nwe think about what's that what that's\ndoing to your mind how can we think\nabout you know meanness and and how to\ndeal with hatred and stress what do you\nthink about that is that a useful use\nlike what do you want to talk about\ntoday yeah like generally and and and\nyou you mentioned like how have I been\nable how have I been able to\nfirst so long with this and I'll explain\nto you how I was able to cope with it\nfor so long\nsure number one and I think this is the\nthe main way that I was able to cope\nwith things was to tell myself that the\nperson the people were hating on was not\nme but the idea of who they thought I\nwas sure so I was able to like separate\nmyself from the hate in a way in which\nthey're not hating me but this idea who\nthey think I am which it's not who I am\nbecause of these people knew me I assure\nyou a hard person they wouldn't hate me\nor they wouldn't hate me as much I mean\nthere's a possibility that they would\ndislike me but not to the point where\nlike being obsessed with me and like\nmessaging me every single [ __ ] day\nnon-stop like I just these people have\nto be sick like you have to be sick in\norder to get pleasure of telling a\nperson to kill themselves every day you\nknow what I mean yeah how do you\nunderstand why they hate you so much\nthey're just angry angry at who\nat themselves\nwhat are they angry at themselves about\noh I feel like they must have a lot of\nlike for you too there's a saying that\nsays hurt people hurt and I kind of put\nthem in that category\nbecause I have things I just like you\nknow but I don't go out of my way to\nfocus my entire life on the things that\nI dislike it must mean that they don't\nhave a lot of happy things in their life\nbut they can focus on so the only thing\nthey can do is focus on this idea of\nbelonging to an entire cult of the\ninternet that likes to hate on me you\nhave to understand I became the punching\nbag of the internet like dr. disrespect\ngot banned okay I've never met the guy\nnever talked to him like ever had an\ninteraction with the guy he got banned\nand I was trending on Twitter with his\nband people telling me that it was my\nfault that he got banned hey isn't he\nmake any sense you know hey I just it\ndoesn't make sense\nlike people were harassing me like why\ndo you get him banned like what do you\ndo what do you did a dog like that you\ncheated with him did you like I'm like\ndude like look what the [ __ ] right and\nso I became obsessed on trying to find\nout why he got banned cuz I wanted to\nprove these people that like add nothing\nto do with me hmm\nand it's just like it's it's impossible\nto make them happy yeah I know and so\nthat's why I'm trying to think about you\nknow how do we what do we do about that\nhow do you approach someone who's\nimpossible once when it's impossible to\nmake someone happy how do you deal with\nthat kind of person\nwhat you can that's thrown unhappiness I\njust have to ignore it well yeah so but\nthen then I've tried I've tried like\nthere's I remember this one guy a little\nbit ago who was like really really\nreally really angry like just I could\njust tell they were messaging me on\nTwitter and they're like kill yourself\nkill yourself [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] and I\nwas like hey like how are you like I was\nactually worried about him I was like\nhow are you like do you have parents\nlike do you have family and they're like\nno [ __ ] you [ __ ] you [ __ ] kill yourself\nkill yourself and I was like I was\nactually I tried talking to the person I\nwas like hey like if you need anything\nyou know just like because I was feeling\ngood at the time like normally if I'm\nfeeling good like I'm strong and I can\nhandle it um and and I just feel like\nthat person must have been hurting so\nmuch right and like my whole night I was\njust like worried about this person\nwho's like hating on me and then I\nthought I was like I'm so like why do I\ncare about this random guy was telling\nme to kill myself like I am worried\nabout how they're feeling and their life\nwhen they're being so horrible to me and\nlike that's not fair to me like I don't\nknow what to do about it yeah honestly\nin Italian I'm not sure what to do about\nit either I mean my thought is that can\nI think for a second\nhmm\nso here's what I'm confused about so\noften times people come on on stream and\nwe kind of talk about what they're\nstruggling with and I can understand\nthat you're struggling with this stuff\nbut the weird thing about this is like I\ndon't know that there is some way to\nhelp you get to peace with this because\nit's sort of like there's this\nassumption that you can do something\ndifferently and then you'll be happier\nor more okay but like this sounds to me\nlike a little bit like cancer like your\nattitude towards cancer only matters so\nmuch right because like it I mean I I\njust don't understand how a human mind\ncan withstand this amount of constant\nhatred over this amount of time like\nthere's just there's some things that\nare just you're just not gonna be able\nto like it's just you that's not how\nhumans work like there's like I mean I\nthink that you can feel better but I\nthink we have to acknowledge for a\nmoment that you know that that that is\nbeyond my control yeah absolutely right\nand and so I think that there's a lot of\nsolace and there's like I mean I don't\nthink you have to continue feeling the\nway that you do now because I think\nthere are some things that you can do\ndifferently and some things that you can\nthink about and understand but at the\nend of the day I guess the first thing\nthat I want to acknowledge is that this\nis not like a single-player game right\nit's like and and no I mean I'm just\nhearing that there's just a lot of\nhatred coming from the other side and\nlike that hatred needs to be addressed\nin order for you to feel in peace\nbecause I don't know I don't know how I\nhave no idea how you deal with that like\nI just don't think that like unless you\nbecome enlightened and and become less\nthey become like some sort of superhuman\nwhere where you're like whooping and\nthings don't affect you and and stuff\nlike that we can not only talk about you\nknow how to take one step forward in\nthat way I've tried like I honestly like\nI've been do you know who Alan Watts\nsays yeah yeah I've been listening to\nhim like every day I've been like like\nbut because I've because I've been\ndealing with\nfor two years now right like I've tried\neverything I can do and like I've tried\nshielding myself from it and the best I\ncan but it's just like it becomes\nimpossible like if I want to do my job I\nhave to see these head messages yeah so\nI mean there's a part of me that says\nthat like the the real way for me to\nhelp you is is not necessarily by\ntalking or not it's not gonna be enough\nto talk to you I think what I really\nhave to do is try to understand the\npeople who say these kinds of things do\nyou write it's like trying to understand\nand I'm with you that that there's just\nangry at things I've done in the past\nyou know what do you want to talk about\nthat like I don't understand I mean yeah\nokay\nI can I can explain to you I can't\nexplain to you everything that happened\nokay so this all started you have time\nbecause it's gonna be long go for it\nokay this all started with PewDiePie\nokay\nhe's a big streamer a big youtuber the\nbiggest youtuber in the world I think I\nwas live on stream and one of my viewers\nshowed me his video at the time I was I\nhad just come from a trip and we\ngenerally when I travel I become a\nlittle hypomanic just change and stuff\num and they showed me a video where he\nwas doing an eye tracker challenge where\nhe was looking at some girls on Twitch\nlike get up and sit and stuff trying the\nwhole point of the eye tracker\nchallenges that you don't look at their\nboobs and their butts and stuff like\nthat and he failed and so he goes all\nthese stupid twitch thoughts hmm you\nknow which I don't have you've heard the\nterm thought I don't think a [ __ ] it's\nlike a [ __ ]\noh my god yeah like just like a hoe it's\nlike that hoe over there or something\nlike that okay um hmm and I got pretty\nmad um and I had just started working\nwith this company that was doing like\nclaims on videos the word like\ncompilations of myself I didn't think\nabout it I got up and he scripts my\nroommate like oh can we copy strike\npewdiepie whatever hmm\nnothing it was just like show me strike\nlike like put a copyright strike on his\nvideo because he was yeah it was just\nlike a joke well I was trying to play it\nup for the stream or whatever\nyou know like like being like oh let's\ncopyright strike this video but what\npeople don't understand is that I didn't\nactually copy strike this video like I\ndidn't do it it was the company that was\nworking for me accidentally and\ncoincidentally put a strike on the video\nnow this was this huge drama on\ncopyright law the company that I was\nworking with that I stopped working with\nthey issued a statement saying like hey\nillinit II wasn't the person that did\nthis it was an employee of ours they had\nno reason to do this liked to put this\nthing out there but nobody paid\nattention to that everybody was like\nshe's evil she's abusing law bla bla bla\nbla bla bla bla bla even though the\nproof was there like this company issued\na statement they said like Alan II\ndidn't do this but he had so many fans\nand they got so angry you know\ninteresting and so people because he had\nso many fans and I was like a pretty\nsmall straight guy I had like a thousand\nconcurrent viewers like I wasn't like\nhuge or anything but like I you know I\nwas like a decent-sized streamer um\nanyway so after that people started\ngoing back on a lot of my old videos\nbecause I have eight years of footage\nand I had all my vods from like 2015 and\n2016 up and they went through all my\nvideos and trying to find instances in\nwhich I had done things and I used to\nhave a lot of fun on the stream I just\ndrank all the time and like played\nstands and like have a lot of fun and\nthen there's a clip of me and my best\nfriend we were drinking and somebody\nasks me this is like the second the\nsecond part of everything somebody asked\nme how I got to Canada now\nI I have to put a parentheses here to\nexplain to you something to explain this\npart but I met my ex-husband in world\nWarcraft back in 2009 he came and\nvisited I think MIT 2008 he came and\nvisited me for a year back and forth we\nwere like super in love we ended up\ngetting married in Colombia because he\nwanted to stay there he wanted to teach\nin Colombia but he wasn't able to get a\njob so I had to come back to Canada\nbecause he was broke I lived with my\nparents and stuff so we started like a\nsponsorship and the sponsorship took a\nwhole year and he visited sometimes but\nsometimes not so then after a year that\nI end up coming Canada it would have\nbeen married for like a year and a half\ntwo years already\nI found out that he had been cheating on\nme like the whole time\num and obviously it was really hard for\nme because I had left like my entire\nfamily in Colombia and everything to be\nwith this guy so I was very better I\nseparated from him I was already in\nschool so I stayed here in Canada acts\nlike I was going to school um but I I\nhave kept a lot of bitterness in my\nheart for this and I understand that\nthat was my mistake\nabout being angry at him because I said\non stream when the person asked me like\nhow did I get to Canada I said like\nlaughingly I was like oh well I got\nmarried and I came to Canada and then I\ndivorced him and so this whole rumor of\nme committing immigration fraud got\nstarted and\nthen it was like oh you know a linen\ndecommitted immigration fraud and then\nlike after enough people say it and\nenough youtubers make videos of these\nthings it becomes my reality you know\nwhat I mean\nlike people take it as a fact that that\nis what happened and now I am very angry\nmyself because I feel like if I hadn't\nbeen better at him back then I wouldn't\nhave said those things\nso I put it is my fault for being angry\nyou know to tell you I'm not sure I\nagree with that and I understand why you\nwould think that but like I mean the\nstory is you tell it today sounds like\nyou sort of so it sounds like you have\nsort of a tendency to make off-color\njokes and then for some reason and I\nmean that's that's fine yeah but but\npeople will always misinterpret the\nthings you say and will create this idea\nthat you're some horrible person let me\nfinish the whole story okay okay so\nafter that it was like okay I committed\ncopyright fraud then I committed\nmarriage fraud then after that I there's\nthere's an incident with another\nstreamer that I'm not gonna mention\nabout and there was something else I\nreally don't want to talk about that one\num then it was it was the the cat thing\nand this one was a really bad one so my\ncat stands here I don't know if you've\nseen clips of it my cat likes to sit\nlike up here um and I was I was playing\nranked in a game and my cat jumps on my\ndesk and I go like oh and I try to put\nhim up here but he falls um and so\nthat's when the whole animal abuse thing\nstarted now people started taking videos\nof every single time I had interact with\nmy pets in eight years hmm\nand then they found a clip where I was\ndrinking vodka and I took a sip of vodka\nand then my cat licked my lips cuz\nI used to do this really gross thing\nwhere I would bird feed my cat which is\ndisgusting I know that means you feed\nyour cat food from your mouth yeah I\ndon't anymore but I used to do that okay\nwe all have younger years where we do\nthings that weren't exactly the smartest\nyeah anyway so I'm drinking vodka and\nshe was able to lick some of my lips and\nshe was clearly distraught and I never\ndid that again ever again\ncuz I was like oh my god I was so dumb\nbut I was really drunk so I know it's\nnot an excuse so then the animal abuse\nthing got started hmm\nI invited the SPCA to my house they came\nhere you know they they issued a\nstatement as well saying like hey no\nabuse was found blah blah blah but now\nI'm the person that committed copyright\nlaw immigration fraud animal abuse and I\ngot away with everything and you know\nhow I got away with everything by\nsleeping with people\nand so this is illinit e to the intron\nso a little bit where the hatred comes\nfrom now yeah so let me ask and I blame\nmyself it's all my fault yeah so I know\nthat you're gonna start thinking that\nway right because that's what happens\nwhen we when we get treated poorly by\nother people we start to believe that\nabout ourselves like when kids get\nabused\nso it's up okay so when kids get abused\nthey start to believe things that their\nabusers tell them and that's not just\ntrue of kids it's also true of like\nabusive relationships and and then we\nstart to believe those things that other\npeople tell us because we hear them over\nand over and over again and what I'm\nhearing from you is that there's you\nknow there's like a little person inside\nyou who's trying to tell you not to\nbelieve this stuff but if you hear it\noften enough you start to blame yourself\nis if this is partly my fault I mean\nthere are stupid things I should yeah\nyeah they are my fault yeah so that's\nthat's what makes me think that you're\nreasonable because I think you recognize\nthat you did some things that were\neither off-color or you know not really\ngreat on camera or were flat-out wrong\nyeah but like the whole bad thing was so\nwrong I mean the marriage thing it was\nwrong that I said it in the way I said\nit but I don't think that people should\nhave taken a clip of five seconds of me\nsaying that you know and like turn it\ninto this what it is because now every\ntime I travel it's a huge deal like I\ncan't every time I come back in the\ncountry I have to go through like\nimmigration for like two hours to like\ntalk to someone and explain to them and\nyou know and like I'm always able to\ncome in because they always do the\nresearch and I show them pictures and\nthe documents and everything and they're\nlike okay you guys live together you\nknow it's okay um we actually separated\nI'm a couple II he I didn't get a penny\nfrom the guys and want anything to do\nwith him you know but it's like\npeople just want to think that I'm this\nhorrible person yeah so where does the\nthe you slept your way out of all these\nproblems come from well cuz people can't\nimagine that I'm not in jail like if you\nhear all these things you're like this\nperson should be deported and they\nshould be like out of twitch and they\nshould be like in jail or something and\nthey see me streaming like oh happy and\nhaving fun and people get angry at that\nthey don't understand that the idea that\nlike yes I have done things that are\nwrong but half of the things that\nthey've heard about me are alive\nyou\nhmm do you think you get treated\ndifferently because of your physical\nappearance oh yeah for sure\nand because I'm a woman like there have\nbeen streamers that have like fed their\ncats chocolate on stream you know and\nright for a cat yeah terrible for an\nanimal it's just this poisonous alcohol\nis um and it's like people don't don't\nthink about it twice you know I mean hmm\nwhy do you think they think about it\ntwice with you because of the narrative\nbecause of your appearance\nyeah because because I think it's the\nwhole PewDiePie thing that got it\nstarted like PewDiePie fans and you know\nwhat the what the worst part of it is\nthe PewDiePie and I are good now like\nlike I'm good with him and his fans\nstill think that like you know this is\nvery funny this happened to me with soda\n- soda and I used to do arenas back in\nthe day you know soda soda popping okay\nme and so what I used to do a long time\nago and there is this ongoing joke in\nwhich I was supposed to give him feed\npigs for carry me and arenas which just\nit was just a joke we had and then in\none of his videos he uploaded it online\nand there was a comment of that and I\nhad people come into my stream for like\nthree years happy but like pictures of\nmy feet Oh feet pigs yes and people came\ninto my stream every single day for like\nthree years asking me to give sort of\nthe feed pics that he deserved so the\nthing is because these videos are out\nthere live\nsorry about the burp because those\nvideos are out of this person because\nthese videos are out there then people\nthink that like that is the reality\ntoday you know what I mean like if a\nperson sees a video that's five years\nold today they're like oh yeah this is\nthe reality right now but it's not so\nit's just it sucks I tell you what are\nyou doing right now how are you feeling\nI'm feeling better yes you're smiling\nwhy yeah cuz it's funny it's a stupid\nsad and funny it gets\nridiculous what's ridiculous about like\nI can't believe that I'm in this\nsituation because the situation is so\nstupid and I can't believe that I get\nthe amount of hate I get for something\nso silly yeah I think it is it is a\nfunny story I mean this is what the\nInternet is about right\nit's about feet pick memes and and you\nknow collaborations and and people like\nI mean that's what hopefully life is\nright it's like yeah but like back then\nthe feedback thing was funny and then\nthe pewdiepie thing I actually didn't\nmind it as much but then now it's just\nlike you're an abuser and you break the\nlaw and this and you get away with so\nmuch [ __ ] and it's like I don't have\ncontrol over these things like I invited\nthe SPCA I have to deal with immigration\nevery time I travel you know the\nauthorities have been here I have been\ncleared the whole the whole copyright\nthing got cleared as well and it's just\nlike people don't see that because they\nsee these videos that people who are\nhorrible have made online about me like\nexaggerating the truth and then there's\npeople like keemstar who like invent\n[ __ ] all the time\nhe like he's like created Photoshop\nstuff like there's this on this ongoing\nthing that I sleep with people at twitch\nnow that's the only way possibly in\ntheir mind that I'm my band and it's\nlike I don't even leave my house\nyou know what I mean like I live didn't\nknow where Saskatchewan is no I just\nknow it's far away okay I live in the\nMidwest of Canada I don't go - I've\nnever been to twitchcon I rarely ever\ntravel like I've gone to packs twice and\nlike I'm going to Blizzcon twice that's\nlike all the conventions have been - in\neight years and like the like I sleep\naround so much and [ __ ] we're like I I\nbarely even leave my house you know so\nit's just it's just so ridiculous it's\njust like it's all so ridiculous\nyes so to tell you I'm kind of confused\nbecause it sounds like I don't know how\nto help you right now you can help me I\nthink the only thing I can do it like I\nhave like two options I kill myself or I\nleave the internet or like I learned how\nto deal with it I guess\nyeah so let's pick number three number\none sounds like a not a good idea number\ntwo also sounds like that's not a good\nidea so number three and I and I'm\ndealing with it but I think I hit a\npoint where like I don't want to have to\ndeal with it anymore\nyeah too much work yes it sounds like\nthere are things that other people have\nin their lives that they can take for\ngranted like when I open up the internet\nit is not hateful things about me and I\ncan only imagine what it's like to I\nmean actually I can't imagine what it's\nlike to wake up and have you know so\nmuch hatred about you coming from so\nmany like literally having to wake up\nevery single day and the first thing you\ndo in the morning is clear hey Instagram\ncomments like that is my morning every\nsingle day that's a sentence then I do\nit I've been doing it for two years\nthough\nyeah I think that that helping you deal\nwith it is like a piece of it but I\nthink we've gotta understand I mean I'm\nlooking at this a little bit more and\nthe apologies that this is unfair to you\nNatalia but I just don't think that you\ncan you know people are abusing you\nwhich it sounds like actually what your\nwhat the sounds to me like is that\nyou're an abusive relationship with the\nInternet and oftentimes we see a lot of\ntrouble amiss like I deserve it though\nbut you deserve what I got I mean I\ndon't to you they're all the hate I get\nbut I I deserved that they hate at some\npoint it's just like it's perpetuated\nyou know right but I think I've already\npaid my dues like I've suffered enough\nyou know what it means\nyeah so that's that's what I think that\nyou know if you deserve I think if you\ndid something wrong sure you deserve I\ndon't know if you deserve Hey I mean I\nthink that I wouldn't I don't know that\npeople deserve hey I think what they\ndeserve is you know possibly punishment\nor justice yeah what total things that I\ndidn't get the judgment that and they\nbelieved I deserved so they're giving me\nmy punishment and hey yeah what I'm\ntrying to figure out is why do they care\nso much about you I mean there are lots\nof people out there that can be hated\nand a lot of streamers get hate from a\nlot of people it seems like you're lucky\nor unlucky enough to get a particularly\npassionate and committed group of people\nor the or what's happening is there\ncould be a cognitive bias going on I\nmean I'm not really getting this but the\nother option is that you are [ __ ] up\non way more regular basis and more\nseverely than you think now is that an\noption like are you because I don't\nthink that that's the case but generally\nno that's not the case I mean I had like\nan accidentally accidental nip slip like\nthree months ago but other than that the\ncat thing was like it the cat thing was\noh and it was so horrible dude they like\nmade so many NIT so many memes about it\nand like they body shamed me so much\ntelling me that my nipples were like too\ndark and they were like people made fun\nof my nipple\nand it wasn't and hey it wasn't just\nviewers the thing is it's also streamers\nthat do this all the time and so when\nstreamers talk about me and say [ __ ]\nabout me then their viewers come and\nhate on me and so I just like got\nconstant waves of people coming into my\nstream because I'll like show a clip for\nlike like sometimes on Instagram and\nthey'll be like a story of something I\nsaid like three years ago and then\nthey'll be like my Instagram gets\nflooded with people saying hateful stuff\nhow many people are there do you think\nthat that sort of do this is it like is\nit a lot or is it like a few very\ndedicated people there's big streamers\nthat do this like big drama channels\nlove talking about me because I think\nlike I became a meme and and so many\npeople hated me so much that I became\nlike a really easy way of getting views\nand followers and likes I'm sorry what\ndoes that mean are you feeling because\nit's dumb so what are you feeling when\nyou start to smile I I just I just like\nlaugh about things that make me sad\nare you sad about this of course I just\ndon't think it's fair okay let people\nget to use me and the bad things that\nhave happened to me for their own\nmonetary benefit I think it's dumb\nyeah I've come to understand that there\nare a couple of channels that basically\nare like drama farming and yeah he talks\nabout me like every day though like what\neven if I don't do anything he like he\nlikes to like go like oh I know I'll in\nany I know what a linen he has on Twitch\nblah blah blah like I don't have\nanything on Twitch what is who's\nkeemstar Oh freaking sociopath he's like\nhe's like he's done so many horrible\nthings I don't even know where to start\nyou should go watch the the hair\nproductions he made a video on him I\ndon't even want to talk about it he's\njust not a nice person and I'm pretty\nsure everybody can agree with that well\nhe has followers but he's known for like\nmaking up [ __ ] and like going after\npeople and like\naffect them them a lot and I\nyeah just not nice yeah Natalia I'm\nsorry to say but like everything you're\ntelling me makes me think that this is\nnot like this problem is bigger than you\nI mean there's there's a lot here in\nterms of like grief and difficulty and\nstress and [ __ ] like that but I don't\nknow like sometimes when I talk to\npeople there their perceptions are\ndistorted and so I think that part of\nwhat I do is like help them understand\nhow does your mind work okay what what\nis stress doing to you things like that\nbut in a weird way I'm not I'm not\nhearing a whole lot like I don't know\nexactly how to help you like do you have\nany sense of what I can do to help you\nwhat can I do that would be helpful\nI don't know\ndo you think you can you're a\nprofessional you tell me yep I am the\nprofessional hmm do you think life you\nknow if you don't think I can be helped\nthat's not what I said I'm asking you do\nyou think here's the thing I honestly\nthink that everything that I could have\ndone I've already done it yeah I can I\nreally do yeah I can tell that you would\nthink that way so my next question for\nyou is do you think you can be helped do\nyou think you can feel better do you\nthink you can be better\nI don't know\nit's just it's just a big problem like\nit's not you're right it's not just me\nit's like it's like an issue of like\nsocial media and the world and stuff\nyeah and and so maybe that's why I'm\nhaving some difficulty because like I\nthink we have to start with your\nperception of whether you have to\ncontinue to feel this way right because\nlike changing the way that you feel is\nactually stuff too step one is can you\nchange\ndo you have to wake up and feel the way\nthat you do every morning no it's not\nworth it anymore\nokay so what about your what do you\nthink can change about the way that your\nmind is or the way that your life is\nlike the situation that I'm put in is\nthe only thing line used to change\nso I'm not so sure I agree like I like\neither like not being on the internet\nanymore you know and like that's a\npossibility for me like I can just go\nback to school or something sure yeah\nyeah so generally I do feel like this is\ngonna follow me everywhere like I live\nin a small city and literally like\neverybody knows about me okay funny\nthing I was actually I was actually in\num in nursing school when I started\nstreaming the first two years of\nstreaming and um I actually had a viewer\nreport me to the CRNA the registered\nnurses association in Saskatchewan\nthey sent a bunch of [ __ ] about me that\nI was like getting naked on stream and\nsaying that I was paying college through\nthat just like stupid [ __ ] and I got\ncalled to the dean's office and the\nZetas like super racist it was awful it\nwas an awful experience it was partly\nthe reason why I quit nursing to stream\nwas because of that because I so like\nI'm thinking like if I go back to school\nit's gonna be that - like people aren't\ngonna leave me alone regardless of what\nI do\nlike I'd have to change my name and go\nsomewhere else maybe like maybe that's\nthe only way\nyeah I don't want to accept that answer\nI'm not saying that you're wrong I'm\njust saying that I don't want to accept\nit what do you think about them I think\nit would be really nice to go and start\nagain from zero somewhere else what\nwould be nice about that but I don't\nhave to deal with this anymore\nyeah that does sound I wouldn't blame\nyou see decided to do that I mean I\nthink no one really good but I don't see\nhow anyone could I'm sure I I think if\nwe're I'm hearing one thing the Talley\nit's that people blame you for all kinds\nof [ __ ] that's unfair they may find a\nway to blame you then I mean I wouldn't\nlet people know where I am or what my\nnew name is and they wouldn't be able to\nfind me she's like I have to disappear\nbasically do you want to do that yeah\nI just want to be a different person I\ndon't like me anymore\nthat hurts to hear because I don't think\nthat your I don't think it's fair for\nyou to not like the person that at least\nI'm talking to I like the person I'm\ntalking to I think you're a wonderful\nperson that's sweet thank you\nwhy do you think I think\ncuz you're a nice person and you see the\ngrid of people okay right so so now we\nsee something interesting so I think\nyou're a wonderful person because I'm\nrelentlessly positive that what you're\nsaying no no I'm not saying that but\nokay like\nif a person is not like a good person\nthey see the bad in others if a person\nlike I don't know how to explain this\nokay so you see the good in people\nyou're seeing the good the good\nqualities in me why do I see good\nquality what do I see in you that's good\nI don't know you tell me nope you tell\nme if you really if you really have\ntrouble with you really okay\nI really like it if you could try so I'm\njust meeting you for the first time\ntoday yeah so like what could I possibly\nthink is respect what you probably say\nthat to all your like clients and\npatients you always tell them that you\nlike ah\nso when you say when you say that I say\nthat to everyone what you're doing is\nactually invalidating what I'm telling\nyou do you see that you're kind of\nsaying but you say that to everyone you\ndon't know me you don't know me how can\nyou like me ah that's a good question I\ndon't know you so what is it about you\nthat I don't know we would change my\nmind let's give it a shot\nbut be careful because we don't want to\ngive people like more ammo so maybe if\nyou don't speak but oh my god right I\nmean we need to be careful here for a\nsecond but I'd say try like okay I'll\ntell you what my friend say about me\nthey say that I'm a very generous person\nokay actually Josh said that to me\nyesterday that I'm very relaxed like a\nvery chill I'm cool with whatever like\nI'm not a complicated person\nI like to treat every human the same\nlike I hate we're in like other content\ncreators think like they're better than\nother people like that are really\ntriggers me so I don't know if there's a\nword for defining like I'd like to treat\neveryone equally\nokay no matter who they are do I know\nany of that about you no you don't know\nthat about me so why why on earth would\nI think you're a wonderful person is it\njust because that's what I say to\neveryone because I'm a human and all\nhumans are wonderful in a way I guess I\ndon't know tell me yeah so but so so in\ntelly good so now let's think about the\nanswers that you're coming up with or\njust like general right there's nothing\nspecific about but I think this is the\nproblem is that you started when you say\nyou don't want to be you anymore what\nI'm seeing is that you don't see\nanything specifically good about you as\na person like you you can't you\nliterally can't come up with anything\nthat you've talked about today that\nwould make you like respect and\nappreciate you as a person right it's\nall general stuff it's like just because\nI'm a nice guy and I see the good in all\npeople [ __ ] like that nah I wish that\nwas true but I I don't I see I see\nbadness and people too so here's what I\nthink is pretty respectable the first is\nthat you're trying to be different that\nfirst and foremost has you in my corner\nI'm in your corner sorry because I think\nyou've recognized that you've done some\nthings wrong and you're trying to change\nso if there is one thing that will make\nme think that you are a wonderful person\nand makes me think that makes me respect\nyou and also makes me think that you\ndeserve my help is that you yourself for\ntrying to change so I don't know if if\nyou get this Nathalia but not everyone\nis like that like you just think about\nthe people that send you Instagram\nmessages every day or like those people\ndo you think they wake up in the morning\nand they say I'm gonna try to be a\nbetter person what have I done wrong in\nmy life and how can I try to do better I\nfind it hard to believe that the legions\nof people that are hating you wake up\nevery day and try to become better human\nbeings maybe they are maybe it's unfair\nmaybe we're judging them unfairly fine\nright and maybe there's a bias with the\nway that you're displaying information\nthere are all kinds of reasons that that\ncould be wrong but generally in my\nexperience when you have people who wake\nup every day and they just like spout\nhate and other human beings that doesn't\nstrike me as a very self-reflective\nperson maybe they're I don't know so the\nfirst thing reason that I think you're\nwonderful is because I think you're\ntrying to be a different person second\nthing is that you know I know this is\nprobably gonna be I'm gonna get some\n[ __ ] for this but I think you're\nactually kind of funny and and I think\nthat you're you're also maybe I don't\nknow if you're and I say this with\nrespect okay but you know I still gotta\nsay I don't know if you're unlucky or\nhurts vo missus oh yeah I don't know if\nyou're a little bit stupid because I\nthink that like some of the stuff that\nyou're doing on stream is like is like\nreally not that great and that sounds\nkind of dumb to me but I also think a\nlot of what you're describing is where\nit's like I think the whole feet big\nthing is is [ __ ] hilarious and I\nthink that you are unlucky because I\nthink there are people like making\npeople laugh I know and that's what too\nextreme yeah I really I really sometimes\nI think like if I make myself look\nstupid and I get people to laugh like\nthat's what went on me like I don't mind\nmaking a fool out of myself if I can get\nsomebody to have a good time yeah so I\nmean I I think a lot of what you do is\nlike par for the course for what happens\non Twitch and actually white which is a\nwonderful place because there are stupid\nass memes that get propagated and there\nare actually suicidal kids out there who\ncan watch that laugh get their day gets\na little bit brighter and in the world\nactually becomes a slightly better yeah\nand I do believe that and I also think\nthat like III I mean I haven't really\nwatched your streams and I don't really\nknow and I'm new to twitch I've been\ndoing this for about six months and I\ndon't have time to watch my twitch any\nyeah but but it does sound to me like\nthere are a couple of things that you've\ndone which which I would really\nthink long and hard about and at the top\nof the list is like how much you consume\nalcohol in general and also on stream\nokay that's smart\nyes sometimes but so so that's the kind\nof thing like what I think when I\nrespect you and I think you're a\nwonderful person like that's the kind of\nthing that I'm talking about right\nbecause at the end of the day I want to\nhave hope for you and I think you are a\ngood person and sure do I see the good\nin people absolutely but I also see like\nthe bad people and and what I'm hearing\nfrom you is that you know you make a\ncouple of off-color comments like I\nthink I mean you know personally I'm not\nsaying that this comment was good or\nthat I support it but I think sort of\nlike cracking an immigration joke about\nyour your ex-husband who cheated on you\nis like within the realm of\nunderstandable acceptable unclear but\nlike people make jokes all the\nfull-width what I say now like I used to\nbe like a real free-spirited person yes\nI'm not I'm not afraid here's the way\nthat I felt before all this happened I\nknew that I was good right like I knew\nin my heart that I was good and I wasn't\nafraid of like saying something that\nwould make people think I was bad\nbecause I that people would receive me\nin the way that I was expressing myself\nand what I've learned is that you have\nto be really careful with how you say\nthings because they can be\nmisinterpreted and I didn't know this\nbecause it was a little girl my parents\nnever like told me not to do something\nor not to say something they let me do\nwhatever I wanted to do and say whatever\nI wanted to say even if it wasn't\nappropriate they thought they were just\nletting me be my true me so I never\nreally learned that as I get to like be\ncareful with my words yes I think that's\na very important lesson to learn and I'm\nhappy to hear that sense\nunfortunately that you had to learn the\nhard way that especially when you have a\npublic platform the words that you say\nhave a lot of meaning and I'm not saying\nthat the joke was appropriate what I'm\nsaying is that like I you know in\nprivate I've had a lot of people who\nhave dealt with with very difficult\nsituations and painful situations and\nthey oftentimes the only way they can\ntolerate them is to make jokes about\nthem and that's what I do that's what I\ndo like I I made like chaff throwing\njokes now all the time because like it's\nthe only way I can cope with it yeah you\nknow but like then people see it and\nthey're like oh my god then if she\ndoesn't feel sorry for what she's done\nand so like it's just difficult it feels\nlike there's no win you know um after\nthis whole like animal abuse thing\nhappened I was doing yoga on stream I\nwas trying to practice a headstand and\nto go in a headstand you have to go in\ndownward dog then - and it's a position\nwhen you go like this basically where\nyour legs are here your bum is up here\nand your head is out here right um and\nmy dog this was right after the animal\nabused my dog comes behind me and starts\nsniffing my ass and so I thought I can't\npush her because if I push her people\nare gonna be like animal abuse sorry\nsorry I very slowly move down you know\nand like I was like okay Luna careful\nand yeah it took me a long time to like\nget out of the post without like being\nsuper careful not to touch her or hurt\nher and then when people started saying\nwas that I [ __ ] my dog seriously they\nstarted making memes about me [ __ ] my\ndog and that I had trained my dog to\nlick my vagina or whatever and it's just\nlike it\ndoesn't matter what you do yeah what\ndon't [ __ ] how do you get that from dogs\nif asses that's what they do I'm sorry\nthat just sounds so preposterous to me I\nI just feel like people really wanted me\nto be evil you know what I mean yeah so\nthen let me ask you a question okay so\nso maybe I'm okay so a couple bouts\none thought that I just want to toss out\nand then I have a question for you so\nthe first is that you know are about a\nweek ago we had a group of female gamers\nwe just came on and talked about their\nexperiences with dealing with toxicity\nin games and and one of the interesting\nthings that they talked about at the end\nis actually expressing some amount of\ncuriosity about like why are why are the\ndudes toxic in games like what's going\non in their head and that's got me\nthinking a lot about like understanding\nwhere the birth of hatred comes from\nbecause like so far what we've been\nfocused on like is an organization is\nlike helping the people who are getting\nhurt and like trying to help like the\nvictims but like I've been thinking a\nlot about you know should we be focusing\non the source of the toxicity instead of\nthe effect of the toxicity because what\nI'm hearing then and just hearing you\ntoday and once again there could be a\nlike a bunch of cognitive bias or things\nlike that but I'm not really getting\nthat I mean it sounds like you you\nrecognize that you did a couple things\nthat we're sort of out of line I mean\nnone of it really sounds band worthy you\nknow to me I don't know but you know I\ndon't know and so I it's just got me\nthinking a lot about them instead of you\nbut I don't know that it's gonna be\nproductive to have a conversation about\nthem so let's just talk about so I just\nwanted to toss that out I love it if you\nthink about it for a little while and\nthen get back to me about about the\norigin of the hatred comes from yeah\nor if you have thoughts about that like\nI mean because I just don't think like\nit comes from someone who is is angry\nyeah\nso like every a feeling of like\npowerlessness yeah so that's the whole\npoint it's like it's like maybe what we\ndon't understand yeah and-and-and\nbut here's the question that I have for\nyou and I think that this is kind of an\nimportant one you said that when you\nwere growing up like you had a sense\nthat you were good as a person and I'm\ncurious about do you still feel that way\ndo you feel like on the outside Natalia\nis a good person I do but I don't think\nthat people see that and that's what\nhurts me yes I don't think that they I\nthink they choose not to see that yeah I\nthink I think it means a lot to them for\nyou to be somehow how is it\nwhat is the cold odd bias we're like\nwhen you believe something everything\nthat gets shown at you is just gonna\nreaffirm the by yeah I think it I think\nthat's me event\nconfirmation bias yeah yeah yeah that's\nthe thing and like it doesn't matter\nwhat I do at this point like people have\nalready made up their mind and Who I am\neverything I do is just gonna confirm\nwhat they believe yeah so I I don't know\nso it sounds like you're able to still\nseparate their hatred and sort of\nrecognize that some of that is\nirrational that's yeah you've been yeah\nit still affects me yeah what hurts it\njust frustrates me frustration is an\numbrella emotion there's another kind of\nemotion blind underneath frustration\nwhat's what are you frustrated by can I\ngo to the bathroom real quick\nyep okay okay I'll think about it while\nI'm in the bathroom\nokay\nall right twitch at\nyou\nyeah this is this is uh this is\ninteresting\nyou\nand I I don't know how much of this is\nabout her like it's weird right like I\nmean I don't\nI mean you know what this reminds me of\nbut like it reminds me of like being a\nfield medic I mean I've never been a\nfield medic and it's like if you get a\npatient that's been shot a bunch of\ntimes and then you deal with you know\nyou you get the bullets out and things\nlike that and then okay they go back out\ninto the field yeah\nsorry to interrupt you no go for it I\nhave to say I have the biggest insights\nin life when I'm in the bathroom I\nfigured it out you figured it out what\ndid you figure it's a control thing what\ndoes that mean\nI've always had a control problem like\nmy eating disorder like everything it's\nabout not being able to control things\nin life I can't control what people\nthink about me oh that upsets me I can't\ncontrol people say about me that upsets\nme ah now we're getting somewhere see\nnow I can help you with this yeah okay\nso say tell us more about that I don't\nknow like I I've always heard that like\nanorexia stems from like a lack of\ncontrol and like for me the way that\nlike I've always coped with stress\nhas been by like being able to control\nthings yes so like when I was younger it\nwas with food I would just like me like\nyou know the whole world can be falling\napart but if I'm only eating one apple a\nday that's the only focus in my life and\neverything else doesn't matter now\nbecause I don't have that anymore\nI organized so I just like take my\nentire closet apart organized by color\nby shape by four you know um clean my\nentire home things like that I've always\nhad an issue with like not having\ncontrol over things and I think that\nprobably stems from somewhere in my\nchildhood where my dad was in prison or\nyou know probably there I feel like all\nmy issues started with my I grew up in\nColombia in the 90s\nand there was cartels and guerrillas and\nbomb bins and kidnappings and the cartel\nwent down my dad was related to the\ncartel he ended up in prison it was like\nthen I parents separated it was just\nlike one thing after the other and right\nafter that I developed writing disorder\nwhat was going on around that time um\nwell like I said it was like one thing\nafter the other yes right so so so it\nsounds like your dad went to prison she\ndid well yeah like for you it sucked\nit really did and not just because of\nthat but because my mom found it he was\ncheating on her wash well he was in\nprison so my mom suffered a lot because\nof that and my dad was shot on her while\nhe was in prison yeah my dad's a big\ncheater like I've it's five of us from\nfour different moms there's overlap in\nrelationships like why not that was a\nplayer yeah so anyway um I had like a\ntumultuous childhood I would say there\nis like a lot of things that happened\nthat don't I don't know I wouldn't say\nlike more than the average person but\nthere's a lot of change happening\nrapidly between the ages of like nine to\n13\num and then writing disorder started\nthen when I was 16 my mom had cancer\nyeah and then\nI was still being bulimic at the time\nand I was in I got into medical school\nbut then I started playing world\nWarcraft and I got like I got upset no\nbut it was bad like I was addicted to\nworld Warcraft I quit school everything\nI am I started just like would wake up\nplay Wow all day until I went to bed for\ntwo years I didn't do anything that's\nhow I met my ex-husband and then I ended\nup here in Canada and then I ended\nstreaming and it's just like my whole\nlife has been like a roller coaster of\nthings going on what did your dad think\nabout him\nooh my relationship with my father Freud\nwhy would he say about this um okay my\ndad wasn't really that much there like\nhe was there he was there like on the\nweekends um we didn't have like a really\nclose relationship but he was always\nthere\nyou know he helped a lot he put me\nthrough like a really good school he\npaid to things so my dad paid private\nhealth care and private school for me so\nI was able to go to school with a lot of\nlike really rich kids even though we\nweren't rich like me and my mom weren't\nrich but like I went to like a really\nrich school and it was hard cuz I don't\nknow I never felt like I fit in in\nschool either plus I had an eating\ndisorder and it was very visible that I\nhad an eating disorder I mean I was 23\npounds don't need three kilos sorry like\nthat's like I don't know like 60 pounds\nless than like I was\nI was Amman ceated like it was really\nbad\num and so I feel like people would look\nat me with like like yuck like everybody\nwould stare at me\nand so that was pretty hard that was\nlike high school for me was like being\nalone and people like staring at me\nbecause I looked like I was dying yeah\ndid it feel to have them stare I think\nthat was my motivation for getting\nbetter\nis that weird\nno like I just didn't want people to\nlook at me like that anymore you talking\nabout people in school or nowadays on\nthe Internet\noh no not in the internet I look good\nnow like I'm good I don't look like I I\nwas just thinking that it was\ninteresting because the statement that\nyou made I wonder if it could apply now\nright that you just don't want people to\nlook at you the way that they do is that\nhow that feels\nI just don't want people to look at me\nat all like I want to go back to my\nsmall little community of people that\nhung out and play video games I like\nthat\nI don't want Fame I don't want money I\njust want to meet have enough money to\npay my bills and have fun playing video\ngames with my close friends that's all I\nwant to do like I I'm not asking people\nto like me I'm just I just want them to\nstop harassing me 24/7\nso this sounds to me like it feels quite\ndifferent from what the way that you\nfelt back when you had an eating\ndisorder at school oh yeah totally have\nyou ever felt the way that you do now\nlike before like growing up\nno not really like I I had like moments\nof like bullying shortly maybe like in\nlike sixth grade when there's these two\nkids they like start throwing things at\nme\nbut that was easy because I could just\nget away from them I can't get away from\nthis yeah\nthat don't sound what you really want to\ndo is just get away from it start a new\nlife\nyes just play your games with your\nfriends and hang out and have a good\ntime yeah you know so just to be clear\nyou know I think we talked a lot about\nthe past on the stream and I think we\nlearned a lot of important lessons from\nthe past we learn about how to relate to\npeople and things like that but I think\nNatalia your story is a really good\nexample of how like I'm sure the past is\nsignificant but it sounds to me like\nthis isn't some kind of you know this\ndidn't start when you were not I mean I\nthink some stuff started when you were\nnine yeah but I think I was able to\nrecover like I am my eating disorders in\ncheck and honestly like I think I have\nmy my polaron check I haven't done any\ncrazy things you know in the past few\nyears I mean yeah I'm a little loud and\ncrazy at times and I you know but it's\njust my personality I think honestly so\nlet's talk about and I agree I mean I\nthink that this isn't this is a bipolar\nthis isn't you know it's not mama from\nchildhood or I mean it sounds like it's\npretty clear to me that you sort of get\nan a very high amount of hate and\ntoxicity on a daily basis and just\nthinking about the mind and the way that\nI understand it you don't need to go\nlooking for another reason to feel like\n[ __ ] yeah it's not like I mean we can\ncheck a little bit but you know I think\nthe interesting thing I do think that\nyou can move forward from this and I\nthink the main thing has something to do\nwith sort of acceptance and\nunderstanding that you can't control\npeople's perceptions and so I mean I\nthink I think I had already got into\nthat point yeah I just think like there\nis a few things that happened recently\nwhat happened dad like really got my my\nwhole barriers down\nwell it was like like everything I\nwasn't going with my crowed and stuff\nit's just been going like like in a\nsteady downhill and then like three days\nago for you know like five days ago\nninja made like a snarky comment at me\non Twitter and like his entire following\njust destroyed my socials with like hate\nand stuff like more than usual cuz he\nhas a lot of followers and so I spent\nlike all night just like reading really\nnasty stuff and then the next morning I\nwake up and I find out that Byron killed\nhimself and\nI mean it that was just really hard\nthat was just really difficult for me to\nprocess yeah because he was like one of\nthe oh geez and Wow like when I started\nstreaming that him and soda we're like\nthe other two wow streamers and like I\nknew like he had struggle with mental\nhealth for a long time and you know we\nhave we we hung out and the times that\nwe hung out like he was a nice guy he\nwas so sweet and he just like\nI just feel so bad about it\nyeah he was a really nice guy it's good\nguy\nyeah I think I think Ovid has been I\nthink four years or even decades people\nare going to be studying the mental\nhealth impacts of koban you know I\nwouldn't even be surprised that people\nare more hateful towards you because\nthey're sitting at home and have nowhere\nto go\nI think there's a lot of weird stuff\ngoing on like part of me feels like I\ndon't deserve that like I don't I don't\ndeserve it to put myself in a position\nin which that's what I have to do I\ncompletely agree with you like in a way\nI feel like I should protect myself from\nthis\nwhat do you deserve\nboth good piece yeah I think we all\ndeserve peace\nI think it's really really sad that\nyou're not able to find it yeah I mean\nI've said this a couple of times and\ntelly I just don't know I mean we can\ntalk about toxicity we can talk about\nstress we can but I just don't I don't\nsee a problem on your end like I know\nit's kind of weird to say but I mean\nmaybe there is one I'm just saying I\ndon't see it I think do you try to\ncontrol things probably I think you know\nyou can think long and hard about I'm a\nlittle bit of a control freak for sure\nyeah so I think that generally speaking\npeople who are control freaks have high\ntrait neuroticism which is sort of a\npersonality characteristic from\nsomething called the five factor model\nand they tend to suffer more because\nthey kind of get bent out of shape yeah\nyou know there are all kinds of things\nthat we can tell you to do like read\nless on social media spend less time on\nsocial yeah it's like that I can\nprobably do that I probably do that I\ntry very hard to steer clear like even\nthough I sort of in a sense have you\nknow it's completely different in my\ncase because generally speaking I'm\nlucky enough to have the opposite\nnarrative from what it sounds like you\ngot so my narrative on the Internet has\nbeen overwhelmingly positive or at least\nfrom what I've seen and so I'm lucky to\nhave that and I still try to steer clear\nof it\nyeah and just be careful you never know\nwhen you like it can change absolutely\nright so it's gonna change at some point\nbecause that's what happens no one yeah\nthe more you get idealized the less the\nmore difficult it is the more you are\nlike every time that you're online every\ntime you say something like every second\nyear online you take a risk of like\nsomebody misinterpreting it or someone\nsaying something right and then like it\ncreates a lot of anxiety in me sometimes\nlike to the point where\nI'm sometimes scared to stream\nI feel like I'm gonna say something\nwrong or I'm gonna say something bad and\nit's gonna bring more hate sounds like a\nvery exhausting way to live in your head\nyeah constantly calculating yeah\nsounds the very opposite of like you\ndescribed yourself as carefree before\nyes that's like your very different I\nmiss it so much\nit hurts me a lot that I can't be like\nthat\nyeah that makes sense to me\nI think out of everything that I'm\nhearing it's almost I don't know if\ninnocence is the right word but I think\ncarefree is like certainly the right\nword what I'm hearing from you is that\nyou have to fight you're doing all these\ncalculations in your head all the time\nabout what you can and saying what you\nshould and shouldn't say and I hear that\nyou're kind of struggling to keep all\nthis hatred at bay as best as you can\nlike you're cleaning your life taking\nout the trash and your Instagram every\nmorning it just sounds exhausting it\nsounds like it's really starting to\naffect you\nyeah is there anything else I can do to\nhelp\nI don't think so I mean this was really\nhelpful I think no way oh so because I'm\nnot really feeling like I did very much\num I received some empathy which is nice\nit's nice it's really really not to be\naddressed innate it yeah so I like\ntalking to people who are nice so that\nwas nice talking to you was nice cut up\nglass\nhappy to be a part of your public life\nthat is not filled with toxicity and\nhatred but I think it's also kind of sad\nthat conversations like this or\ninteractions like this are not the norm\nfor you I think actually it's tragic\nthat the norm for you has changed so\ndrastically and what you have to deal\nwith sounds it sounds [ __ ] awful\nthat's all I gotta be honest I can't\nimagine I've dealt with a lot of people\nwho have dealt with a lot of hatred but\nhonestly the sounds the worst if that\nmeans anything to you tell me like\nyou're so strong you're so strong and\nlike I'm I appear really strong but like\nit's so much work yeah so I thought it'd\nwork absolutely so I think you know\npeople called me strong as well and you\nknow I'm I'm happy people feel that way\nbut I wait yeah and I don't feel strong\nyeah it's it's it's it's hard to\nremember that it's like it ain't easy\nbeing strong and you know I feel like\nthe fact that other people tell you\nyou're strong makes you feel like you\nhave to be more strong yes those people\nare telling you that you have to be\nstrong mm-hmm yeah so I don't know if\nit's a good thing actually because then\nI'd for so long not to appear weak and I\nthink I just had a point like how to\nbreak down yes I did I I don't think I\nshowed like my vulnerability for a long\ntime because I was trying to appear\nstrong so Natalia I think there are some\nimportant lessons to be learned here I I\nfeel like for some reason now is not the\ntime to really go into them but the\nfirst is to be careful about the\nexpectations that you set for yourself\nbecause essentially what I'm hearing\nfrom you first and foremost is that this\nis a problem of expectation it's a\nproblem of what people's what people\nexpect from you it's a problem of\nexpectations that you can't get away\nfrom because they interpret everything\nthrough their lens and you have to be\ncareful because I think at some point I\nmean there's got\nit's got to be affecting you in terms of\nthe way that you think about yourself\nand so be careful about you know even in\na weird way I'm not saying that like it\ndoesn't sound like you're starting to\nbelieve them which is really good and\nreally healthy and at the same time you\nmay overcompensate based on that hatred\nand become something that you actually\nshouldn't be which is a little bit too\ncareful and and I think that there is\nreason to be a little bit less I mean a\nlittle bit less carefree and at the same\ntime I think it would be it would make\nme really sad if you started becoming\nsomeone who was overly careful that if\nyou couldn't let yourself cut loose from\ntime to time because you are a little\nbit on the edge you are a little bit\nfunny you can say things that are a\nlittle bit off-color and I think those\nactually make you a wonderful person too\nI definitely don't think that you should\nyou know you've got to be careful with\nthe alcohol and you should be careful\nwith your pets depending on what\nactually happened but I mean it sounds\nto me like you know you do care about\nyour pets a lot and and I mean you know\nI'm allergic to cats and I have three\nlike they make me very sick I wouldn't\nhave them if I didn't love them yeah and\nyou know I think it's kind of sad if you\nhave to be I mean in a sense if they\nmake you be someone who's like overly\ncareful and doesn't open their mouth\nlike that's not that's not good right\nsure maybe it'll reduce the hate but I\nthink the really challenging road for\nyou to walk is like not to try to reduce\nthe hate because that's not something\nyou can control and this comes back to\nyou by the way Frank the toilets yeah\nlike you have to you have to live a life\nwhere not so much like you shouldn't do\nthings that foster hate or give them\nammo you have to be like careful about\nthat but at the same time you know\nyou're not going to be able to control\nwhether they hate you because they hate\nyou and can you find some piece of\nyourself and it sounds like you can and\nand really find Natalia or like who you\nare on the inside and recognize that who\nthey hate is illinit ii and isn't all\nyeah even then it sounds like I mean I\ndon't I don't think but I have to like\nconstantly remind myself of those things\nyou know yeah so that's where we're I\nthink we can change a little bit because\nwhen you say constantly remind yourself\nthat sounds like a conscious\nprocess yeah you're exerting in the top\nof your mind\npushing down on certain feelings whereas\nI think what would be cool is if if you\ninstead of constant reminders you felt\non the inside and kind of bubbled up\nsome senses like who you are that these\npeople aren't accurate that this is\ncoming from them yeah I think I think\nthis this comes from like\nI have a very like weird sense and of\nthe world I guess this is gonna sound\nreally stupid but like\nyou\nI believe that every person that exists\nis like part of me as well\nand so that has good and bad things sure\nbecause it helps me treat everybody with\nkindness but it also\nmakes it so that everybody's opinions\nmatter and way to me sure you know and\nthat is something that is really\ndifficult for me to make peace with\nthat's hard I don't think that's stupid\nat all in fact there's a Sun script\nphrase that actually capsule eights that\nsentiment and that is but the bomb I see\nso there are four Sun script sentences\nthat are called sort of the great\nsentences which are kind of the\nconclusions that all these like\nenlightened Yogi's came to and that's so\nI don't think it's stupid at all and\nwhat but Pharmacy is literally\ntranslated as I am that or that thou art\nthat that that you and me are actually\nthe same thing yeah I agree with that\nand it makes it so difficult for me to\nreceive hate from people that I'm trying\nto treat us being equal to myself yeah\nso I feel like if I had if I had a huge\nego and I was able to be like oh I'm\nbetter than everybody else their\nopinions don't matter it can be easier\nfor me to tell what the hey\nbut if you think yeah I think you're\nright I think also that you've stumbled\nupon another important thing which is\nthat ego protects us from other people\nand the fact that you're it sounds like\nyou're not very egotistical which in\nturn means that you connect with them\nmore deeply which in turn means that you\nbear more pain this is difficult\nwhat are you feeling right now\nI'm just feeling sad\nbecause I sometimes I feel like my only\nchoice to not let things affect me is to\nmaybe changed the way how I view the\nworld\nI think that'll help but I don't think\nit's the right move\nI don't right so either like I don't I I\nI love the way that I view the world and\nI don't\nI don't know what to do\nyou\nyeah sometimes I have answers for people\nin Italia I don't have answers for you\nyet but I do have some so the first\nthing is that I have faith in you and I\ndon't think that you need to tank your\nlife to get away from it at the same\ntime if you feel like you do have to\nquit streaming want to change your name\nand move to even the further remote part\nof sense catch you on then go for it\nI wouldn't blame you at the same time I\nthink that what I've what I've come to\nobserve time and again is that I think\nyou say that you don't know what to do I\nsay I don't know what you should do and\nat the same time the cool thing is that\nwe're doing something right now\nand I wouldn't be surprised if you woke\nup tomorrow morning and you felt better\nin some way or had some kind of answer\nso let me say this very clearly a lot of\ntimes we're stuck in life and we don't\nknow what to do and the thing is like we\nthink okay I have to figure out what to\ndo like we have to figure out a plan to\nmove from like a twosie you don't have\nto figure out a plan from A to Z all you\nhave to figure out is like a to B and\nyou don't know where Z is you don't know\nwhere how to get there but in your case\nwhat I would strongly encourage you to\ndo is like I don't know if you're\nswimming today or what but you know\nspend some time outside cuz it sounds\nlike it's a nice day because it's summer\nand you're pretty far earth it sounds\nlike just spend some time outside spend\nsome times with your husband doing good\nI haven't streamed since like like\nThursday okay yeah so so I think give\nyourself some time and some space and\nrecognize that you're actually doing a\nlot already and that that will start to\nhave effects and positive effects and so\nyou don't have to we don't have to\nfigure out what to do all we have to\nfigure out is like how are you gonna\nwhat are you gonna do over the next day\nand how are you gonna feel over the next\nday and I wouldn't be surprised if you\nstart to feel better I think you should\nreach out to your psychiatrist and let\nthem know that you're struggling that's\nwhat they're there for\nyeah and then the last thing is that you\nknow I think it's like figuring out what\nto do is going to be an ongoing\nbasically and there's a part of me that\nsort of says like don't give up\nstreaming because I I think so here's\nthe the other thing that I don't think\npeople realize like you know you're\ncreating something for a lot of people I\ndon't know what that is\nand and but you're you're resonating\nwith people it sounds like you're a\npretty popular streamer so you know like\nsomething is like you're doing something\nthat like is connecting with other human\nbeings you say you feel connected to\nother people dr. Bamba so you call it\nwhatever you want to and I think that\nyou're doing that and it sounds like\nthat's what you're gonna ma that's their\ndaughter ma like you your that's what\nyour duty that's what your circumstances\nhave allowed you to do so I think you\nshould have been you doing that I love\ndoing that yeah so if you like playing\ngames and being a little bit you know\noff-color and funny and sometimes you\nspeak out of turn\nlike I hope that you can get to a place\nwhere you can actually be like a little\nbit more of the person that you really\nare and I I get that I think it's you\nknow you're gonna get hate for it but\nsometimes when people hate you if you\nstart to like crumble a little bit like\nthat actually eggs them on more well\nthat's what I thought that's what I\nthought you know that if I showed people\nthat it was hurting me that it would\nmake it happen more and that's why for\ntwo years I remained super strong and\npretended like nothing affected me and I\nthink it actually made people angrier\nyeah yeah so what I'm saying is not to\npretend like it doesn't affect you but\nto actually think a little bit about\ngoing back to the person that you used\nto be alright and and going back I'm not\nsaying you know drink and do things no I\nused to be like I think I I think I like\nthe qualities of my personality of yeah\nyou know like my dark humor and the fun\nand stuff and I still have that I\nhaven't lost good I just I just have to\nbe more careful um I think there's like\na healthy amount of anxiety I can have\nin order to ensure that I don't say\nanything out of line just not\nthat because anxiety serves a good\npurpose I'm just just not allowing that\nanxiety to overtake me into getting in\nmy head and feeling like I can't speak\nor do things yeah absolutely\nI mean yeah I think part of the reason\nthat I don't know how to guide you is\nbecause I think you understand a lot of\nwhen I teach action and yeah one of the\nbig messages yeah and and so I think\nyour spirituality and stuff your yoga\nand your meditation seems to be your\nself-reflection seems to be paying off\nand so let me leave you with one or two\nlast sentiments and if I can I'm gonna\nI'm gonna try to do the thing where I\ntry to give people hope can I try - do\nyou have hope a little bit okay let me\ntry - let me try to feed that flame just\na tiny amount okay so Natalia I\nrecognize that you've been struggling\nfor a while and you're dealing with a\nlot of hatred but I think it's actually\nquite amazing that you are the person\nthat you are and what I mean by that is\nthat I think you're growing in ways that\nare quite profound and I think a lot of\nwhat you're saying and discovering is\nactually making you like a better person\nand I think it's making you into the\nperson that the world needs you to be\nbecause here's the thing when it comes\nto people expressing toxicity towards\ntowards twich thoughts is that right\nyeah you're not the only one right\nyou're not the only person that people\nhate sure they hate you the most it\nsounds like but you're certainly not the\nonly woman out there who's getting hate\nand it's not even just women right it's\nlike like people hate all kinds of\nthings and they just go like really\nreally hard on people like I don't know\nwhy they hate so much but they hate so\nmuch and I think that you are actually\nmaking the world a better place by you\nknow going through this yourself and\nsort of learning from it growing from it\nand I think often times we don't realize\nthat when we're struggling the world is\nsort of turning us into the person that\nit needs and you know I think the\ninteresting thing is that people see\nlike dr. kay but they don't see like all\nlook at the age how old\nif you don't mind me asking\nokay nevermind you're not dead so so you\nknow assuming you're young but and I'm\nmaking assumptions that I'm older than\nyou already - okay\nso how are you I'm 37 okay so the story\ndoesn't quite apply well actually that\nactually makes sense because that's why\nI think I don't need to help you as much\nbecause I think you've grown a lot so oh\nyeah like if I was like in my 20s a\ncompletely different story yeah I think\na lot of times as we're going through\nthe [ __ ] we don't realize what the [ __ ]\nis gonna turn us into after a while and\nwhat everyone sees in terms of like\nstrength is like the finished product\nthey don't see the process and I think\nas long as you I see you sewing a lot of\npositive karma karma so I see you doing\na lot of things for yourself to help\nyourself out and it is my belief that if\nyou continue doing those things you're\ngonna end up in a good place that you've\nbeen on a journey of like\nself-reflection and growth and stick\nwith it because as someone who I guess\nis on the other side who's kind of come\nout the other end of the tunnel I think\nyou're actually quite close hopefully\nyou know I mean hopefully suicide\ndoesn't win but III think I mean because\nlike I'm saying I I don't really see a\nwhole lot to help you with Natalia and I\nthink that's because I mean you do so\nmany things that are difficult to do you\nwalk the line between acknowledging that\nyou've done wrong and also thinking\nyou're a good person that nuance which\nyou hold is so difficult for so many\npeople if you think about our community\nthey think they're pieces of [ __ ] and\nthey do everything wrong right any\nmistake they make reflects on their view\nwhat the internet that you know how the\nInternet has a narrative about you so\nmuch of our community has a narrative\nabout themselves and they treat\nthemselves the way that the Internet\ntreats you and no matter what they do\nthey hate themselves they can't do\nanything right\nI I think like for the first like 20\nyears of my life I had to\ndeal with like learning to love myself\nand I think maybe that was preparing the\nfor this moment absolutely and and so\nyou know I think you hopefully you're\nprepared and you know whatever you end\nup doing you know you're kind of on\nbehind you I mean not whenever I don't\nwant you to kill yourself you know\ncurses or a psychiatrist but like I\nthink if you decide that you need to\ntake a break from streaming or streaming\nis that for you you know I wouldn't\nblame you and at the same time I think\nthat sometimes amidst all of the hate\nit's very very difficult to see the good\nthat you're doing and sometimes even\namongst all of the good it can be just\nas hard to see the damage that you're\ndoing so that's something that we think\na lot about you know I think a lot about\nwhether what we do is ethical or helps\npeople or what seems like the answer is\nyes but just because the world sends you\nhate doesn't mean that you're doing a\nbad job and if that's true the opposite\nis also true that just because the world\nsends you lots of love doesn't mean that\nyou're doing a good job and at the end\nof the day you have to reflect and find\nthat answer for yourself you can't trust\nthem right yeah makes sense and I I\nthink you're gonna be I mean I hope\nyou're gonna be okay and I think that\nyou're doing what needs to be done by\nhaving this conversation by thinking\nabout it by reflecting and I also think\nthat a lot of what you need is not going\nto come it's not something that you can\ndo it's something that we as a community\nhave to help you with which is exploring\nthat the nature of hatred and toxicity\nand trying to get underneath that\nbecause there is just no way Natalia I I\ndon't know how else to say this there is\nno way that you have done anything that\nthere's random people on the internet\nwho you never met and who have never met\nyou and for them to hate you so much\nhas nothing to [ __ ] do with you it\nhas to do with that like to do that make\nsense\nlike you're allowed to hate people who\nlike you know steal yeah right so like\nthat that amount of hatred like it just\ndoesn't make any rational sense for you\nto just pick a random person on the\ninternet and decide that like you're\ngonna spend day in and\nout trying to make that person kill\nthemselves I think like for example in\nmy case though it has to do with\npeople who follow certain like in like\ninfluencers and then that influencer has\na problem with me and so they attacked\nme because of the problem that I have\nwith a person that they follow yeah but\nstill that still has nothing to do with\nyou right because like if there are\npeople who are extensions of an\ninfluencers will then it's still a\nproblem for that person like why do you\nwhy are you directing your thoughts and\nbeliefs based on a particular person\nmyself included oh I understand that but\nwhat I was trying to say as there are\nlike people that follow certain others\nlike for example keemstar Teamster has a\nlarge large following and he likes to\ntalk people and his followers go and\nattack people so I do think that a\nproblem I'm not saying like in video\ngame hate but in the problem that I'm\nfacing myself has to do with\nhim having a platform in which he is\nallowed to hate people and not just me\nlike he like said that some guy was a\npedophile and like he wasn't and it was\njust like horrible for him he like lust\nis gently I don't know the whole story\nbut it's really sad one um and I just\ndon't think that a person should be\nallowed to say things without having any\nproof you know yeah I mean I that makes\nsense to me I think it's that that also\nis sort of a societal problem like I\nthink this kind of goes back to like\nit's not on you though right it's not\nthat you're doing something wrong it's\nthat I mean I think we've got a family\nI've made mistake I have made mistakes\nbut I haven't killed anybody\nyou know yeah like I I think like I\nthink I even like murders don't get the\namount of hate I get yeah yeah sounds\nit's rough yeah so listen any any\nthoughts the kind of questions before we\nsort of I was kind of thinking about\nwinding down we've been at it for about\nan hour and a half even a little bit\nlonger yeah like two hours almost um no\nI I feel better I think like that you\nlook like you're yeah the whole idea\nthat I'm still gonna cry but the whole\nidea that I just can't control like the\nnarrative you know no matter what I do I\nthink it gives me a sense of\nmaybe like I don't have to worry about\nit as much like if I can't control it\nthen like I I can't do anything about it\nso I think it's just maybe gonna be like\nnot exposing myself to that hate as much\nas I can and like try and protect myself\nso I don't have to treat those things as\nmuch and I do have some measures in\nplace a lot I don't know how to read\nthose things so I think I'll be working\non that good\nso Natalia just to kind of clarify a\nlittle bit I don't think you can control\nthe narrative but what I would say is\nthat so the way I would frame it is that\nyou can't control how they receive what\nyou do but you can absolutely control\nwhat you do yeah but whatever you do\nit's gonna get misinterpret like\nwhatever I do it's can I get\nmisinterpreted I already know that yeah\nyeah and and so just be careful because\nsometimes people take that I'm not\ngetting the sense from you to a license\nto do whatever the [ __ ] they want right\nbecause I'm not getting that from you\nbut I was just for the people watching\nlike I you know I think it's an\nimportant distinction to make that\nyou're not gonna you know run around\nhitting people and things like that but\nthat to understand that fundamentally is\na human being you're in control of your\nactions but not the consequences of your\nactions\nand the reason that I have hope for you\nNatalia is because I think at the end of\nthe day the way that you were acting day\nto day is not correlating with what you\nreceive the fact that you're being\nspiritual the fact that you're\nreflecting on what you do the fact that\nyou're being thoughtful about what you\nsay I think all of those are seeds that\nyou've planted which are gonna bear\nfruit months from now or even years from\nnow the person that you're gonna you're\nbecoming is the person that you're gonna\nbe with for the rest of your life and\nthat's the person I can get behind I\nthink what you're dealing with now is\nthe bitter fruits of seeds that you\nsowed many years ago yeah and the\nhardest period of time is when you're\nreaping your bad fruit and sowing your\ngood seeds and it can feel like you\nreally really want to give up but in my\noverwhelming experience if you stick\nthrough it and you do the right thing\nthat starts to turn the tide and I\nreally do hope that that tide turns for\nyou\nlooks like anything emotional again okay\nyeah so sometimes I teach people how to\nmeditate I think if you're feeling\nemotional we don't what do you feel like\ndoing do you want to meditate or not bad\nno I just I just I cry when like a\nperson says something that I believe is\ntrue and then it makes me sad about\nmyself why I'm not crying because I'm\nfeeling sad I'm crying because I relate\nwell you just said yep that's for you so\nyou know just so you know it's just it's\nthe way my emotions work I guess yeah\nthat's that's a very healthy way for\nthem to work that's all okay so what do\nyou think you want to meditate a little\nbit what do you sounds like your\nbathroom\nokay go use about them okay okay\nrevelation number two ink let's see what\nback with this okay so I got to think\nabout what kind of meditation we teach\nyou\nyou\nyou\nyou\nI'm feeling a lot better actually\ngood yeah hmm so if you wanted so tell\nme guys me a little bit\nI teach different kinds of meditations\ndepending on what people's goals are and\nin your case I see a couple of different\noptions one is something that's a little\nbit more spiritual and some others like\nsomething that's a little bit more\nemotional like what are you looking to\ngain from meditation oh I don't want to\nget more emotional I'm already so\nemotional um so you want to be like like\nless emotional like control your\nemotions I just wanna be calm okay\nso I'll give you a choice I can teach me\na technique that will help you calm\nyourself down a little bit or I can\nteach you a technique that will help you\nsort of more on a sort of more spiritual\nlevel like thinking about your\nconnectedness to other people and that\nkind of [ __ ] what do you prefer so let's\ndo the first one I'm already really\nconnected to people okay great awesome\nso let's start by sitting up straight\nand now I have to think about which one\nto do how clogged is your nose not that\nmuch okay so hmm let me blow it okay I'm\ngonna teach you something called\ntriphasic breathing okay okay so what\nwe're gonna do is actually so that\nthere's cool thing about the mind is\nthat it's very connected to the breath\nand depending on how we breathe it sort\nof creates certain emotions and some\nemotions actually create certain breath\npatterns so if someone's like scared\nthey'll breathe like right that's the\nbreath pattern of fear breath measure of\nanger is a little bit different so if we\nactually adjusts our breathing and we\nkind of know this because we'll tell\npeople to take deep breaths and if they\ntake deep breaths they kind of calm down\nso how does that work we're not\nwhatever but there are particular breath\npatterns that I'm gonna teach you that\nhopefully will kind of calm you down\nokay okay we'll help you sort of process\nor separate yourself from your emotions\nand do you know how to belly breather\nabdominally breathe like breathe with\nyour stomach instead of your chest okay\nyeah so take a deep breath in excellent\nand then out very good beautiful okay so\nwhat we're gonna do is triphasic\nbreathing so the first phase is going to\nbe belly breathing so we're gonna do\nthree breaths with our with our about so\nfor those of y'all who are watching so\nwhat we want to do is on the inhalation\nif you guys notice Natalya's stomach is\ngonna come out is she breathe them\nbeautiful do you guys see that and then\nas you exhale the stomach goes back in\nit's great because you have those little\nthings on your pants so you can see them\nmove good beautiful I see Matt okay good\nand now Natalia what I want you to do is\nwhen you take a breath in with your\nstomach when you're at full breath pause\nfor a second and then breathe in a\nlittle bit more and then expand your\nchest so do belly first and then chest\nit's hard it is hard it's supposed to be\nokay okay\nstart with just the belly okay just like\nyou were doing and now incorporate the\nchest right there you feel that a little\nbit more and then out slowly good\nlet's do three of those\nbreathe in with the valley expand the\nchest and then out expound the belly\nwell no it's just I feel it immediately\nyep\nkeep going focus\nI have a very hyperactive item I know I\nmean that's okay that's why we're gonna\nbreathe good so notice that humor notice\nit within yourself good and returning to\nthe breath\nbeautiful Italian just like you did good\ngood so now we can even see it I'm gonna\ncomment about what we're seeing and I\nwant you to listen to what I'm saying\nnotice that what I'm saying is gonna try\nto create a reaction in your mind and\nfocus on the breath so we can see\nthere's a slight smile it's starting to\ncalm down as we talk about Natalia the\nsmile may him peace she may feel more\nself-conscious just listen to the words\nsee there's the humor good so now she\nranks and now returned to the breath\nmoment that I'm not talking about you\njust listen to the sound of my voice and\nbreathe in with the belly expand the\nchest and then out\nyou can see with the exhalation calmness\nreturning to the face there's a pleasant\nneutral slight positive expression\nbreathe again\nbut now Natalia\nto try to break apart the abdomen and\nthe chest so do the valley first and\nthen the chest\nValley first slowly good now add the\nchest good and now out now we're gonna\ndo phase three okay so when belly is\nfull and chest is full then I want you\nto open your eyes for a second\nlift up your shoulders like this and\nbreathe just a tiny bit more you're\ngonna get five percent I can do yes you\ncan\nwhat do you mean you can't those reminds\nme of when do you how do you say like\nthe sound salutations where you breathe\nup yep all the way and then you can\nbreathe anymore\nI hit a point all right yes yes okay\nwe'll get you there Sun Salutation it's\nactually harder when you do that but\nthat's okay okay we'll get you try it if\nyou can't do it in a big deal okay so\neyes closed so breathe in belly chest\nand I lift off the shoulders just a tiny\namount do you get anything and then out\nthat's all you need you don't even need\nto lift him up quite that much\nso abdomen slow chest and then slight\nraise of the shoulders just tiny bit\nmore and then out\ndon't forget this\nI don't know where you get that idea but\nwe're just gonna keep going okay set\nthat aside that's a judgment about\nyourself\nit's an annotation okay ignore it\neyes closed back straight you're having\nthoughts so be it\nfeeling embarrassment so be it you're\nnot good at this just hard\nI meditate all the time by myself but\nit's difficult yeah an area it's very\nyeah yeah so let's try one more time no\nthere's people watching and you're\ntalking you know okay so maybe what\nwe're gonna do is just close your eyes\nand I'm gonna shut the [ __ ] up yeah\nwe're gonna just let you meditate I love\nit okay\nyou\nyou\nyou\ngo ahead and finish the round that\nyou're on right\nyou surprised me no it's okay okay good\nyeah feeling good strong work today yeah\nthat was good thank you for taking the\ntime to talk to me thank you for coming\non and and sharing with everyone yeah I\nlike that project that you're in of\nfiguring out you know the whole hate\nthing and stuff if I can help you with\nit at all let me know you know honestly\nwe're trying to figure it out but my\nfirst thought is that if you want to\nsend some of your haters our way like\nI'd love to talk to them I'm serious\nokay I just don't know if my haters with\ndo something that\nI give you their Twitter account yeah\nwe're gonna like them\nwe're gonna have to figure that out yeah\nif I tell them to go to you they're not\ngonna do that right right sorry for them\nlike I get a lot of hateful twitter them\nso I can just send you three so so what\nprofiles and you can contact them so I\nhave to be a little bit careful because\nI'm kind of a boomer and sometimes I get\ninto situations that are not good for me\nso let me talk to my staff about how to\nactually do something about this because\nwe want to do this we want to talk to\nhaters at some point cuz I think we have\nto write to understand what's in their\nmind yeah and and at the same time I\ndon't want you to send all of your\nhaters our way because you're pretty\ngood at surviving the hate and I'm still\nnew at it so I don't know if I can\nhandle it yet\nI think they hate me I don't think they\nhate everybody I don't know but if I'm\nfriendly towards you maybe I'm putting a\ntarget on my back oh noes anyway we'll\nsort it out we'll reach out to you soon\nI think what we have to we really do\nhave to figure this out okay\nall right yeah don't count on me for\nwhatever and I'm gonna say something\nabout you after I hang up with you that\nI want you to watch on the bog tomorrow\nis that okay I want you to just think\nabout this for a second but I'm gonna\ncomment a little bit about this\nmeditation technique I'm gonna teach the\nrest of twitch but I don't want you to\nwatch it right now okay yeah I want you\njust think for a second they think for a\nday and then you can watch that more\nokay all right take care you too thanks\ngood luck bye okay bye okay so no\nspoilery no all right so here's the\nthing to understand so this technique is\ngonna be really important for her\nbecause she was trying to figure out how\nto block out like she was like people\nare watching and you're talking and\nthat's hard\nabsolutely that's why you need to do\nthis technique because if you can learn\nhow to block out for just a few moments\neveryone watching and me talking to you\nthat's what she needs\nshe needs a place in her mind where she\nescaped what she wants his escape and\nlike even for 15 minutes a day if she\ncan escape from everyone watching\nbecause she takes the people that are\nwatching with her in her mind I don't\nknow if you guys like if that makes\nsense but the Twitter dm's follow her\nthroughout the day right like they go\nwith her they like infect her mind and\nthey like propagate in her thoughts and\neven with all of that simulation she's\nreally got to do this kind of technique\nbecause she needs to give her space\nescaping is not about changing her\ncircumstances although that certainly\nhelps\nshe needs to escape by doing that by all\nmeans but the really crazy thing is that\nyou can escape from all of that stuff\nright here and and she can escape from\nall of the hatred in her own mind\nthrough like dedication in the practice\nand she's well on that journey already\nto be honest it's really cool and maybe\nstreaming is that for her absolutely\nmaybe it's not for her that's a decision\nshe's got to make on Raw but if we can\nequip her with a tool that if she\ndecides that she does love it which it\nsounds like she does then we want to\nhelp her do what she loves and and if we\ncan protect a little bit from the hatred\nby giving her a space in her mind to\nignore my words and ignore that\neveryone's watching because that's what\nshe's trying to do let's help her do it\nand and hopefully it'll help okay so\n[Music]\nuh okay so"
