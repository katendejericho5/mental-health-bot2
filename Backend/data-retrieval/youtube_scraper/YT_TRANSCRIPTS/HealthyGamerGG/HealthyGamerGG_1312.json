    "transcript": "my name is Alok energy I'm a\npsychiatrist practicing in Boston\nMassachusetts welcome to another healthy\ngamer GG stream just a reminder that\neverything that we do on stream is\nintended to educate and support y'all\nbut nothing is intended to be medical\nadvice and I will say this now more than\never that this is not a substitute for\nmental health treatment and so if you\nguys are struggling you really we're\ngonna basically spend the whole second\ntalking about this but we're gonna spend\nyou guys should really get help go see a\nlicensed professional I'm not kidding\nabout that a lot of people will reach\nout to me and say dr. kay I'll pay you\nwhatever you want I just want one\nsession and I want to make this clear\nthat one session with me is not going to\nfix your problems I know that's what\npeople think six sessions with me is not\ngoing to fix your problems and yeah I\nmean what what fixes problems is actual\nmental health treatment and we try\nreally hard to support people into\ngetting that when necessary in in our\nhope here our mission here is to help\npeople understand that mental health is\nreal that it's devastating that you can\nunderstand your mind and that there are\nways to help yourself in addition to\nmental health treatment understanding\nyourself that's what our mission is and\nI'm going to talk about that too so a\ncouple of just simple disclaimers the\nfirst is that I mean I'm gonna talk\nabout Byron and reckful but like it's he\nstill has a right to privacy and\nconfidentiality\nso I'm not gonna like answer any\nquestions about him or anything like\nthat so I mean y'all can ask that I'm\njust not going to say anything I think\nyou know there's a lot more to his story\nthan most people know and his people who\nare close to him kind of know that yeah\nso let's get started\nit's the first thing that I want to talk\nabout is depression so this is gonna\nsound kinda weird I've always thought I\nhad a weird realization when I was\ntraining to become a psychiatrist and\nthat is that depression is the HIV of\nthe mind and what do I mean by that I\nknow it sounds weird but just hear me\nout\nso like you know when you get an\ninfection like let's say you get a skin\ninfection like you know the infection\nattacks your skin well let's say you get\na GI bug like a stomach bug or you get\nthe flu and it attacks like your upper\nrespiratory system it attacks your\nstomach tax your skin and then your\nimmune system is like how you fight back\nright so your immune system activates\nand it goes and it fights a war with the\ninfection in your skin and your stomach\nand after a couple days you're better\nthe reason why HIV is such a devastating\ndisease is because it attacks your\nactual immune system it attacks your\nability to fight back and this is\nanother bad gaming analogy but like I\nthink of most infections as jungle\ncreeps in dota or MO and like they don't\nactually attack you back they just sure\nif you go and pick a fight with them\nthey're gonna fight you but like they're\nnot like attacking your throne right\nthey're not attacking they're not\nattacking you back like your soldiers\nare free to fight them but HIV is\ndifferent\nHIV is like the enemy team it attacks\nyou back it attacks you in the way that\nlike you fight it's not neutral it's not\njust sitting there attacking some random\npart of your body and then like your\nimmune cells like your white blood cells\nare just there to like go to town in it\nand that's why that's why infections\ngenerally speaking don't kill us\nright we get flus and colds and stomach\nbugs like we get that stuff all like you\nknow all the time most of it doesn't\nkill us\nHIV Kelsey HIV kills tons of people it's\ndevastating it's a it used to be a death\nsentence and why is that because it\nattacks your ability to fight back and\nthat's what\ndepression it's depression attacks your\nability to fight back it makes you think\nthat you can't win it makes you think\nthat the people that love you would be\nbetter off without you it controls your\nactions it attacks your very ability to\nfight back and so that's what makes it\nso devastating we rely so much on our\nmind to help us out to protect us to\nhelp us move forward in life and\ndepression attacks that I mean like\nanxieties bad sure I mean there all\nkinds of you know mental this is that\nare bad but I think depression is is in\nsome ways the most devastating because\nit takes your biggest weapon and it\nturns it against you right your thought\nyour mind which wink which can be\ncompassionate and helpful and brilliant\nand analytical suddenly becomes this\nthing that is attacking you and that's\nwhat's so devastating and I don't know\nif you guys saw you know Byron's last\ntweets but like I mean he knew it too\nright he said that like you're not in\ncontrol and that's what it does\nso over 50% of adults over 50% okay just\nthink about this in middle and\nhigh-income countries and developed\ncountries are gonna suffer from some\nmental health problem in their life\nwe're not talking about cancer cancer\nlike at the end of the day is\ndevastating but effects like a small\npercentage of people right what five\npercent maybe mental health is can\naffect more than 50% of people so it's I\nmean people talk about kovat is a\npandemic and absolutely it is and Kove\nit's terrible but like mental health is\nan epidemic that has been silent and\nbeen ravaging the developed world\nprobably the thurible countries as well\nbut definitely busts for years and it's\ngetting worse\nand I don't think we're doing enough\nabout it so let's talk for a second\nabout suicide so when we say mental\nhealth is getting worse\nso suicide overall over the last decade\nis increased by a third you know we're\ngetting better at treating other\ndiseases like cancer rates are down\nheart disease rates generally speaking\nor down I mean those are the diseases\nthat tend to happen when we get older so\nyou know things like Alzheimer's are on\nthe rise but that's probably just\nbecause we're living longer but mental\nhealth is actually increasing in in\nwhat's really scary is that like a 33\npercent increase in the population\ndoesn't mean that everyone is increasing\n33 percent what's really happening in\nmental health is that suicide rates are\ndoubling have doubled I think in the\nlast decade in teenagers so in 2003 the\nsuicide rate amongst teenagers increased\nby 8% I have no idea what happened in\n2003 they go up they're going up by\nabout 5% per year video game addiction\nis doubled in the last five years the\n33%\ndriven by the whole population it's\ndriven by us we're the ones that are\nkilling ourselves more and more so I\ndon't know if you guys get this but\nsuicide is literally killing us I know\nit's a weird thing to say but the second\nmost dangerous thing to you is you you\nare actually gonna be them the second\nmost likely cause of your death and by\nyou I mean between the ages of ten and\nthirty four the number one cause of\ndeath is accidents car accidents getting\nhit by meteors like whatever just like\nsure so the most dangerous thing to you\nis like completely random there's\nnothing you can do about it second most\ndangerous thing to you is you it's not\ncancer it's not heart disease it's not\nlike I mean I guess you've got an\naccidents connecting but you are you are\nyou are the most dangerous controllable\nthing the in your life the only factor\nthat you can control because you can't\ncontrol accidents like I can't control\nif I'm like you know I'm on a plane and\nit goes down the most lethal thing to\nyou is actually in your control and\nthat's you so the first thing that I\nwant to say is don't worry alone and\ndon't die alone suicide and depression\nget bad because they turn what should be\na multiplayer game into his player name\nright and I mean that's what happens we\nstart to isolate because then if it's a\nmultiplayer game like that's that's what\nwe do right that's what twitch is about\nits multiplayer you have friends you\nhave allies to have us we have you and\nwhat depression does is turns it into a\nsingle-player game and this game was not\ndesigned to be played along I don't know\nif you guys get that but you look around\nit's society and society is made of\npeople\nthe first thing that I'd say to you is\ndon't worry alone and don't dial them if\nyou're worried about someone top someone\nsomething just talk to someone it\ndoesn't matter who talk to someone\nanyone talk to your friends talk to your\nfamily talk to your buddies on Steam\ntalk to your buddies on you know reddit\ntwitter instagram twitch talk to\nsomething and tell people what you want\nto do cuz give them a chance because\nthat's what we need right like we just\nneed a chance to help you and you need\nto give us a chance to help you because\nthat's what we want to do right you\nthink about the people like if you have\nfriends that want to kill themselves\nwhat do you want from them you just want\na chance to be a part of their\nconversation in their life you can't\nsave them that's okay but you just want\nto be involved and so it's a it's a big\nmotto that we have sort of on the\ncoaching side which is don't worry alone\nif you've got a problem like just don't\ndon't play a solo player game like if\nyou're playing Dark Souls you know call\nin a son bro to help you out because\nright now what's what's happening in\nthis country\nis it is an epidemic of disconnection\nevery year that goes by I want you guys\nto just think about this for a second we\nare a greater threat to ourselves for\nthe most part we've like sort of\nconquered infections right even HIV like\nHIV is no longer a death sentence in\nfact the life expectancy with HIV is\ngetting close to normal like if your\nheart is clogged and can't breathe we\ncan actually hook your heart up to a\nmachine that that circulates your blood\nwhile we take a vein from your leg and\nattach it to your heart\nand then you have a bypass in your heart\nworks again like what\nthe actual [ __ ] we are capable of doing\nthat if you have a knee that is torn\napart from arthritis we can literally\nremove the knee and put in a piece of\nmetal and you can walk again\nright now there are tons of people who\nare dying from kovat and it's terrible\nbut what's crazy is that some of them\nare living and the reason that they're\nliving is because we have a thing called\na ventilator and what a ventilator is\nlike we can literally breathe for you we\ncan pump your heart for you we can\nbreathe for you we can replace your\njoints we can do dialysis which is for\nyour kidneys right so like we can every\nthree days you can go to a dialysis\ncenter it filters all of your blood and\ndoes the work of your kidneys so you\ndon't even need a kidney oh and by the\nway we can do transplants we can take an\norgan from one human being and stick it\ninto another team of people what the\n[ __ ] that's crazy\nmedicine is amazing we also have TPM\ntotal parenteral nutrition if you can't\neat we can stick an IV in your arm and\ngive you food and sustenance we can keep\nyou alive without eating we can keep\nyour you alive without your heart\nbeating we can keep you alive without\nyour breathing we can keep you alive\nwithout your kidneys working we can keep\nyou alive without you eating we can\nreplace your joints and we can craft\norgans into you from another human being\nwhat's missing what can't we do we can't\ndo anything for your brain and we can't\ndo anything for your mind this is the\nproblem that we face in as society\nchanges I don't know exactly what's\ngoing on but we have an epidemic of\ndisconnection we can't fix this for you\nmedicine can't fix it for you this is\nthe one thing we can't fix for you we\ncan literally like replace every other\norgan of your body we can if you're if\nyou don't have lengths we can give you a\nwheelchair if you can't speak we can\ngive you a voice box can't do anything\nfor the mind and not anything that's we\ncan't\nI set for you all right let me say that\nand so this is getting worse and we\nhaven't figured out how to fix it yet\nand so we've got to do more as a society\nwe'll talk about that and I think what\nwe're seeing is this epidemic of\ndisconnection people are hopeless\nthey're lonely they're depressed they\nuse substances they self-medicate we're\ngoing to talk about that and so how do\nwe understand like what's going on so\nfirst thing is like we're gonna talk\nabout risk factors for suicide so you\nguys are gonna get professor Andy today\nso I want you guys to think about our\ncommunity and I want you to think about\nwhether these things apply to us or not\nrisk factors for suicide Tromp has that\nhappened to anyone that you know is that\na part of your life physical emotional\nsexual whatever mental illness I know it\nsounds kind of bizarre but mental\nillness is a risk factor for suicide\nright not everyone who kills themselves\nis actually mentally ill and that's a\nstrange thing to say yes it may be\nconversation for a different day\nsubstance use is that an issue in our\ncommunity you know it's interesting\nbecause a lot of people have come\nforward about a lot of you know\nimportant secrets that need to be told\nbringing things to light recently and I\nthink that's healthy\nthe one thing that shocked me was like\nhow common substance abuse was in all of\ntheir stories someone's been drinking\nand we got to look long and hard at the\nculture we promote I've been thinking\nlong and hard about the drunk AMA so the\nlast time I had that much to drink was\n3500 days ago I don't drink very much\nbut it occurred to me that like\nI'm demonstrating that that's okay and\nI'm supporting that and I don't think\nthat that's right I think about it so\nsubstance use self medication let me\ntell you guys something about self\nmedication self medication doesn't work\nmakes you feel good but it doesn't\nactually fix the problem substances\ndon't fix the problem they make you feel\nbetter and I don't blame you for using\nit because sometimes you need to use it\nbecause you've got to get through the\nday you know and we certainly saw that\nwith byron\nfix the problem so it fixes the problem\nis actually working at the problem it's\nmental health treatment that's what you\nguys a lot of y'all need and so if\nyou're self-medicating think long and\nhard about self medication and\nmedication in general is a bridge it's a\nbridge to a better life but self\nmedication is a bridge to note\nthere's nothing on the other side of\nthat if you if you wake up every day and\nyou drink and you get high like what is\nthat leading you towards like sure it\nhelps and I get that your anxiety is\noverwhelming but like what like where's\nthat going are you gonna wake up one day\nand then like you don't need to get high\nfor your anxieties out what's gonna\nhappen you're gonna wake up one day and\nsay like oh I don't need the alcohol\nanymore my problems are all fixed are\nyou gonna wake up one day and you're\ngonna say oh I don't need to play a\nvideo game for 14 hours today because I\ndon't like I have a fulfilling life and\nI'm happy with who I am as a person it's\na bridge to [ __ ] number so I'm an\naddiction psychiatrist and I get that\nlike sometimes it's hard to survive in\nyour mind but for [ __ ] sake start\nbuilding at least another bridge\nyou can't overcome\nI guess you can but you know my strategy\nto overcome an addiction is to make the\naddiction no longer necessary\nwe're healthy gamer we're not treating\nvideo game addiction we changed and\nwe'll talk a little bit about that too\nbut you have to do the other stuff too\nsubstance use isn't a treatment self\nmedication isn't really medicating\nanything it's just ignoring a problem\nand so it's not just depression it's not\njust suicide if you guys have a\nsubstance use problem get some help\nand it doesn't have to be medical like\ntreatment is a good thing but there are\ncommunities like Alcoholics Anonymous\nNarcotics Anonymous\nyou know marijuana Anonymous cvaa\ncomputer game gaming addicts Anonymous\nand we'll talk a little bit about that\ntoo other risk factors for suicide\nsuicide clusters and what does that mean\nabsolutely crazy but suicide is\ncontagious when someone kills themselves\nin its prominent other people kill\nthemselves so something that I want\nevery person to understand right now is\nthat statistically the most likely\nsource of your death that you have an\ninfluence over is you it's not someone\nelse it's you and over the next weeks to\nmonths you're more likely to try to kill\nyourself you were your biggest threat\nand we know this so suicide clusters\nhave been a big problem in Japan a lot\nof good literature comes out of there\nbut after Robin Williams passed away\npeople died there was actually I think\nan increase in suicides after Netflix\nreleased 13 reasons why which is a story\nabout suicide so understand that your\nmind may be attacking you more over the\nweeks to come\nand I want you guys to really think\nabout that for a second because if your\nmind starts to attack you more it also\nmeans that your mind can attack you less\nif you can get more suicidal over time\nwhat it also means is that you can\nbecome less suicidal\nover time and that's I know it sounds\nlike so simple but in the mind of a\nsuicidal person they believe that the\ndownward trend is gonna go forever and\nthat's where hopelessness comes but\nthat's just not true\nif suicidality is a fluctuating\nattribute in your mind it doesn't just\ngo downward it's gonna go up at some\npoint all things in the mind come to an\nend that is the nature of the mind\neveryone's crying a lot right now\neveryone is sorry in 2077 we're not\ngoing to be that sad it's just the way\nof the mind sometimes there are\ncelebrations and then your mind feels\nwonderful and then that changes this is\nsomething that you guys have to\nunderstand the mind returns to\nequilibrium you just have to buy it\nenough time give yourself time talk to\nsomeone else let them help you get get\nback to the equilibria ting mind I know\nit feels like it's hopeless I know it\nfeels like it's forever because that's\nwhat mental illness does to us it makes\nus feel like the present is eternal but\nthat's just not [ __ ] true it's just\nnot true it feels like kovat is gonna go\non forever i mean maybe but it's not\ngonna go on forever it feels like it but\nthat's just not how it works things\nchange over time that is the nature of\ntime things change and so just buy\nyourself time don't do it today and then\ntomorrow don't do it that day reach out\nto people and give yourself time and\nrecognize that your you may need mental\nhealth treatment now more than ever and\nso we're gonna talk about that in a\nsecond but so what are the other risk\nfactors isolation sound familiar\na sense of loss unwillingness to seek\nhelp feeling hopeless that are a couple\nof others so no water we're killing\nourselves more that's us\nthat's twitch that's our community we're\ndisconnected we feel hopeless we smoke\npot a lot of us have dealt with abuse\nand so this is us we're isolated but\nhere's the cool thing so I live in a\nworld where I truly do believe that we\nare never given a challenge without the\ntools to overcome it and like that's\nkind of a weird belief as an optimism no\nI don't think it's optimism I think it's\nactually a deep principle of karma or\nphysics that if you take a neutron and\nyou split off a positron you're left\nwith an electron right that like you\ncan't move from neutrality without\ncreating like positive and negative that\nin order for ice to cool a drink it has\nto warm up everything has two sides like\nthat's just an attribute of nature\nthere's no like one side of anything in\norder for me to get calories I have to\neat something else energy is neither\ncreated nor destroyed largely true of\nmatter isn't power and so I think that\nthat's like a deep principle of our\nuniverse which applies to like really\nreally bizarre kind of like\npsychological stock way down the road\nand y'all are welcome to disagree with\nthat but in my life I have truly\nbelieved that we are given the tools to\novercome our challenges that it's the\nchallenge that creates the tool why are\nwe here at healthy gamer like we are\nhere at healthy gamer because the the\nsoil was fertile for us to grow is\ninteresting because Bobby Skaar said\nlike I predicted your coming I saw you\nor like I knew you were gonna come how\ncan you do that because that's what\nhappens right like in terms of civil\nrights or black lives matter police\nbrutality is the negative side of like\nthese protests and black lives matter we\nhave the tools to overcome our\nchallenges and that's not like optimism\nit's like it's deeper than that it's not\na belief it's like a truth and so we\nwe struggle with an epidemic of\ndisconnection and so what are our\nweapons right because like when you're\nlike the final boss is like mental\nhealth like and that's what I mean about\nall this physical stuff like we've\nconquered the body we [ __ ] conquered\nit like just think you don't need your\nheart to survive anymore if your heart\nis [ __ ] we can literally take your heart\nout of your body and stick another one\nin there the final boss is mental health\nand that's where we are in society we're\nat the end of the game it's like\nlate-game civilization where like at the\nbeginning it's like you're fighting\nagainst wolves and [ __ ] and eventually\nit's like we get to this this is the\nfinal boss this is the final boss you\nknow universal basic income people don't\nneed to work anymore we grow food\nhydroponically and we can grow way more\nfood vertically than we can grow like\nhorizontal you just think about as a\nsociety when we start growing food in a\nvertical dimension we don't need people\nto work like [ __ ] is automated now we're\ngonna have self-driving cars what's left\nthe mind that's the final bus this is it\nthis is the climax this is the raid boss\nthis is the end of the game that's the\nboss that we're fighting and you're damn\nright it's hard because the final boss\nis the hardest because we can't use\nscience\nI can't biopsy your depression and just\ngive you a pill to make it go away\nbecause depression is complicated mental\nhealth treatment is a part of it but\nthere's more to it what are our weapons\nclinical care is number one\nthat's psychiatry mental health\ntreatment but protective factors against\nsuicide\nclinical care is at the top of the list\ngo [ __ ] get treatment if you feel bad\nabout what it is or if you feel\nstigmatized or you're like you don't\nknow how to do that\ndon't worry alone talk to someone about\nit weapon number two protective factors\nagainst suicide success to support\nstructures this is what our\nresponsibility\nis an online community and I just don't\nmean helping anyone I mean twitch\nI mean steam I mean whatever take your\npick that we support each other I want\nyou guys to think about this who here\nhas ever met reckful you got a never met\nthe [ __ ] guy you guys have never met\nme how can I do anything for you\njust think about how awesome this tool\nis at our disposal that you can watch\nanother human being in a different\ncountry not even talk to you just\n[ __ ] talk Hatun and you can feel\nconnected to them and you can grieve\ntheir loss so hold on a second because\nthat's that's a [ __ ] nuke against the\nfinal boss because we can form\nconnections with each other that are\nreal and powerful without ever beating\neach other that we're we're a society\nthat doesn't need to leave the house\nbetween ubereats grocery delivery and\nAmazon to day delivery you never need to\nleave and so we become isolated and at\nthe same time we've got a weapon against\nthat because the computer is what\nisolates us and that's what gives us the\nopportunity for connection skills and\nproblem-solving actually protect a\nfactor against suicide we're good at\nthat we're good at solving problems\nthat's our Forte we're [ __ ] smart the\nstudy done by the Department of Defense\nfound that people who play video games\nare ten to twenty percent smarter than\npeople who don't\namong soldiers seriously our intellect\nis one of our greatest weapons and\nthat's why depression is so devastating\nbecause that's when we turn it against\nourselves it's hard right it's like mind\ncontrol like if you guys think about\nmind control in video games right like\nyou like charm and enemy and then they\nlike they fight for you and if they\ncharm you then you fight for them and\nthe stronger the character is that gets\ncharmed the more screen you are so our\nmind is our greatest weapon and it's\nalso our greatest enemy\ncultural beliefs religious beliefs\nthat's actually on both sides that can\nbe a risk factor or a protective factor\nso I don't know what we believe about\nsuicide I think our culture is evolving\nand we've got to think a little bit\nabout that so let's talk about that for\na second what is our culture so what is\nour culture\nhow do we how do we act how do we treat\neach other\nto think long and hard about this so\nwith all this stuff with like sexual\nharassment sexual assault coming out a\nlot of people ask how could this happen\nhow could this happen\nhow did the tournament organizers not\nknow how twitch should do this about it\nEmmett cheer should resign if all this\ndidn't stop right like blaming everyone\nyou can how could this happen what makes\nour culture we do so when when someone\nwe had female game gamers on stream this\nMonday and they kind of said like you\nknow if they speak in boys chat they get\ntoxic responses and people call them in\nall kinds of I want to stick my\nblankety-blank in your blankety-blank\nand then there are two things that that\nhappen right so one is that like\nsometimes like most people just don't\nspeak up and then sometimes they get a\nwhite knight which is just as bad and\nthey're like m'lady let me fedora\nyour face and let me defend humanity\njust treat them like humans let me tell\nyou you guys are gonna know how we stop\ntoxicity on the internet you know how to\nmake gaming a safe place for women it's\nactually really really really simple\nwhen one person is toxic towards a woman\nyou don't have to attack them you don't\nhave to defend you got to say hey man do\nyou think you can call it a little bit\nlike do you really think what you're\ndoing is decent and then what do they do\nthey start calling you as soon fine you\nlet them you don't have to fight them\nyou don't have to convince them you\ndon't have to do any of that [ __ ] you\ndon't have to show them you're right\nthough that's all you say like hey man\ncan you lay off and then if he keeps\ngoing you can apologize to the woman you\ncould say hey I'm sorry you have to deal\nwith this sounds like it sucks I can\nonly imagine if there's something I can\ndo let me know that's all you got to say\n30 seconds of speech and then he can get\nmad at you why does he get mad at\nbecause you're [ __ ] right does that\nsolve the problem no in the next game\nthere needs to be someone else like you\nand in the next game there needs to be\nsomeone else like you and I guarantee\nyou that if that person plays ten games\nin a row where there is a single person\nthat's like hey man why don't you lay\noff they're gonna shut the [ __ ] up on\ngame 11 they're not even gonna do it you\nand I are gonna convince them of\nanything that's how we solve toxicity\nit's not\ntournament organizers it's not twitch\nit's not streamers it's [ __ ] you and\nyou think about when you've been hateful\nand you think about when you've been\ntoxic and when you've grabbed your\npitchfork friends let me explain\nsomething to you if someone who is\nsexually assaulted is not grabbing their\npitchfork\nyou better [ __ ] put yours down the\nright to justice and judgement is the\nparty who's aggrieved\nnot the person browsing reddit and I\nthink you do have an individual\nresponsibility and like I think it's\ngood that you advocate for people and\nsometimes people are so [ __ ] up that\nthey can't advocate for themselves and\nthen you do need to grab their pitchfork\nbecause they're not bringing theirs I'll\nadmit that that's that's absolutely a\nscenario but for the most part that\nshould be the minority and if someone\nsays hey I forgive this person I don't\nwant you guys to tar and feather them\nyou all should think about that like who\nare you to say otherwise and as you look\nat yourself I think you're gonna\ndiscover all kinds of important things\nthat the beef that you're fighting has\nnothing to do with them it has to do\nwith a beef of your own life and that's\nwhat you need to fix\nwhere does hatred come from where does\nanger come from do we just grow up\nhating people sure some of it is\nconditioned\nsome of it is and gets conditioned by\nthe culture right why do why do people\ncall or wire people toxic to women in\nvideo games it's because no one stops\nthem and other people are and we see the\nwide difference in different kinds of\ncommunities I'm not gonna like name\ndifferent communities but just go and\nlook at different streamers see the kind\nof communities they cultivate how do\nthey do that it's because of the way\nthat they act it's because of the\nparticipants like I don't know if you\nguys get this but I don't create the\ncommunity I don't even participate in\nthe community you guys are the community\nthe credit for the health of the healthy\ngamer community goes to you doesn't go\nto MIT and if you're a part of a toxic\ncommunity the blame goes to the\ncommunity it goes to you and so everyone\nis sort of saying like how could this\nhappen it's such a systemic problem\ntoxicity and like like you know sexual\nassault and sexual harassment\nand at gaming right it's not just fair\nit's like everywhere and if it's a\nsystemic problem\nit needs a systemic solution and a\nsystemic solution means you need to get\nthe [ __ ] up off your chair and get\ninvolved and when it comes to depression\nand suicide and disconnection you have\ntwo very important responsibilities one\nis that you take care of yourself and\nthe second is you try to take care of\nother people so cultural beliefs are a\nprotective factor of suicide so the\nquestion that I have for you is what is\nour cultural belief about suicide\nhow are we going to treat it do we think\nit's okay or not okay are we gonna reach\nout to someone are we not going to reach\nout to someone let me ask you guys a an\ninteresting question what is the best\nway for you to get someone else to\ndisclose their suicidal thoughts to you\nany idea ask them is incorrect listen is\nincorrect are you good is incorrect are\nyou okay is incorrect\nTrust is wrong you disclose yours first\nso [ __ ] you model the behavior\nyou be vulnerable you share and if\nyou're not suicidal don't share that\nshare something else\ndon't worry alone\nremember that your struggles are a\nmultiplayer game - if you want to help\nsomeone else start by asking for their\nhelp because think about this this is\nfine I have hope because everyone looks\nat this gaming community and they see\ntoxicity that's not pricey because it\nboggles my mind how little y'all take\ncare of yourselves and how hard you work\nto take care of other people it's\n[ __ ] amazing right let you think\nabout what you're not willing to do for\nyourself but you're willing to do for\nother people like this is a community\nthat can beat the final boss because at\nthe end of the day when we separate you\nfrom your toxic environment y'all are\ngood people and so we've got a chance\nlike sure it's the final boss but like\nwe've got what it takes because at the\nend of the day I've been looking for God\nawfulness within this community from day\none we've asked like in cells and a dude\nwith a waifu to come on and if there\nisn't some degenerate [ __ ] on the\ninternet isn't it that kind of stuff and\nthese people shockingly turn out to be\ndecent and normal human beings because\nwe all are and as long as you like date\nlike just peel a couple of layers of the\nonion back you're gonna find decency\nunderneath if that wasn't the case\nhealthy gamer would be nowhere so give\nyourself a chance to be a decent human\nbeing\ngive yourself a chance to be vulnerable\ngive a chance give yourself do people\nthe favor of letting them help think\nabout that for a second if someone's\nlike hey man like how you have the\ncapacity to make someone feel like they\nhave purpose in life if you let them\nhelp you cuz if you help someone out\nlike if someone like if your friend has\na flat tire and they call you and you're\nlike absolutely man I'll be there you\nchange the flat tire they go home how do\nyou feel about yourself after that you\nfeel damn good B and you should\nyou have worth you can see your worth in\nthe world the problem is that we don't\ngive ourselves opportunities to see all\nworth in the world and to lean on\nsomeone else for support go for it it'll\nhelp you and it'll help them so kind of\ngoing back to suicide so let me say this\nso reckless suicide was absolutely a\ntragedy and it wasn't the first and it's\nnot going to be the last so as a\npsychiatrist when I interview people I\ndon't know what the risk factors of\nsuicide are and I know that pretty much\nevery person that we interview checks a\nlot of those boxes I know that because I\nused to check a lot of those boxes and I\nknow that like before I even showed up\non stream I've worked with hundreds of\ngamers who checked a lot of those boxes\nin reckful suicide was a tragedy but I\ndon't think you guys get this we as a\ncommunity or literally killing ourselves\nthat's not a metaphor it's not a\nhyperbole it's not an exaggeration the\nsecond leading cause of death for people\nbetween the age of 10 and 34 is suicide\nafter random-ass accidents that no one\ncan do anything about it's us that are\nkilling ourselves and this is the thing\npeople don't realize this because look\nat chat right now look at how many\npeople are here and if one of them kills\nthemselves tomorrow who's gonna know not\na single [ __ ] person it's happening\njust because we see it doesn't mean it's\nhappening and it's not going to be the\nlast so we've got to do more\nso what can you do the first thing is\nlet someone else help you\nsecond thing is help yourself third\nthing is help someone else in terms of\nhelping yourself if you guys have any\nmedical professional in your life tell\nthem if you're struggling with\ndepression does it [ __ ] matter it\ncould be a physical therapist doesn't\nmatter if you have a doctor tell them\nthat you're struggling there are\nresources I think we have a\nexclamation-point support kind of thing\ntalk to your doctor you can also call\nyour insurance company if you have\ninsurance and say hey I wanna you know\nwho's a how can I see a therapist and\nthey'll walk you through the process you\ncan go to a website like Psychology\nToday or better help or talk space and\nsign up for stop and just like browse\nprofiles and like call people you can\nthere's weird it's good you guys may not\nbe very familiar with this but there's\num there's a website called google GOOG\nle and it's cool you can just type in\nanything in there and it'll give you\ninformation about it so you can even\nlike it's it's actually like a pretty\nsophisticated website it looks simple\nbut they just have this box and if you\ntype in therapists and then your\nlocation it'll give you like a list of\ntherapists in your location it's pretty\ncool\nit's kind of like a personal assistant\nsort of website so you guys can try\nusing that too\nthe other thing that you can do if you\nguys are struggling is you don't have to\ntalk to a mental health professional\ntalk to a friend say hey I think I mean\nI should maybe see a therapist but I\ndon't know how and this is the funny\nthing right so look at what your mind\ndoes if you think about how do I see a\ntherapist you don't know how to figure\nit out if a friend comes to you and says\nhow do I see a therapist you're on that\nship you'll figure not for them you can\nuse that 10 to 20 percent gaming IQ buff\nto solve a problem for them if you can't\nafford it this is why organizations like\nrise above the disorder exist there are\nalso some free clinics that offer mental\nhealth care so at Google you can even\ntry to type like free mental health care\nin your city or call someone\nright so like a lot of providers will\nsee people for free who can't afford it\nyou just have to ask half of the\npatients in my practice I see for free\nso just ask okay so next thing healthy\ngamer so mental health for gamers by\ngamers that's what we're about at\nhealthy gamer and so what are we are we\ntreatment absolutely not\nso what are we how can we do mental\nhealth for gamers if we're not treatment\naren't we telling people oh like are we\npretending to be therapists and we're\nnot therapists absolutely not so the\nreason that the final boss grew up in\nthe first place is because somewhere\nalong the way we put all of the burden\non mental health on providers and as a\nsociety we gave up on mental health and\nwe said for all mental problems go see a\npsychiatrist and that's the only\nsolution that we have and I want you\nguys to think about how idiotic this is\npeople are like oh like dr. K like does\ntherapy on so you don't do therapy on\nstream it's not therapy what I do is I\nhave human conversations with people\nabout what's going on in their life that\ndoesn't make me a therapist that makes\nme a decent human being in the fact that\nwhat you guys think I do is therapy\nspeaks to the problem that like what I\ndo should be [ __ ] normal that's\nwhat's wrong\nand just think about this for a second\nis all physical health medicine\nyou\nis all mental health psychiatry\ndaran lies the problem now we know how\nthe raid boss got so big because there's\nlike exercise and diet we acknowledge\nthat there are nutritionists and\npersonal trainers that can help you be\nphysically healthy is it medical\ntreatment absolutely not\ndoes it prevent or treat heart disease\nabsolutely so what's missing in our\nsociety and this is why I like life\ncoaching and executive coaching and all\nthis kind of crap has popped up because\nthere are things involving your mental\nhealth that don't have to be therapy or\ntreatment that people I know this is\nshocking there's a depression which is a\nclinical illness and then there is\nunhappiness which is not and what's our\nantidote to unhappiness we don't have\none well why the [ __ ] not right so in\nWestern medicine\nwe're not health care we're sick care\nlike if you think about exercise\nexercise sure helps you if you're\nunhealthy but once you hit like the\nneutral point exercise can elevate you\nto be super healthy and what's missing\nin our society is that elevation and\nthat's what we do in healthy gamer what\npeople I don't think people really get\nthis but most of what I draw on and\nhealthy gamer is not psychiatry it's\nyoga it's meditation it's wood duh what\nwe talk about is finding purpose finding\nhope finding meaning learning under to\nunderstand how your mind works what I\nteach is not psychiatry it's engineering\nof the mind that's what we do\nyoga chitta vritti nirodh aha' Yoga is\nthe cessation of fluctuations of the\nmind and that is what I try to teach\nfirst and foremost what does that mean\nfluctuations of the mind suicidality\ncomes and goes the mine has fluctuations\nhappiness joy sadness disappointment\nexcitement all fluctuations peace comes\nfrom cessation of fluctuations of the\nmind that is first and foremost what I\ntry to teach the rest of it is just\nsupportive whether it be psychology\npsychiatry neuroscience medicine\nphysiology spirituality my end goal if\nyou want to be a healthy gamer yoga\nchitta vritti nirodh aha' sees the\nfluctuations of your mind and you will\nbe at peace when someone is depressed\nand suicidal their mind is very deviated\nfrom the north\nthat's what we do at a healthy gamer\nwe want to teach you how you work we\nwant to teach you how to understand\nyourself y'all are playing a game with\nthe monitor turned off\nyou don't know what's going on you're\njust [ __ ] mashing buttons without any\nidea how anything works that's why\nyou're losing\nwe're here to teach you how to turn the\nmonitor on and do we talk about emotions\nabsolutely does that make it therapy I\ndon't think so\nbecause like emotions are not the\nprovince of medicine like I don't know\nif you guys get this but long human\nbeings have emotions so does anything\ninvolving emotions make it medical\ntreatment no like that's the problem is\nthat we think that like you can't like\nyou can process your emotions with a\ntherapist absolutely you can also do a\nlot of other things for your mental\nhealth that do not involve treatment and\nthat's what's missing in our society in\naddition to stigma and all that stuff so\nthink about how you take care of your\nmind how do you take care of you\ndo you lean on other people for support\ndo you do things that are good for you\ndo you help yourself out are you just\n[ __ ] afk when it comes to yourself\nbecause the answer is yes you are and\nthat needs to change\nso when it comes to healthy gamer this\ndiscussion is incomplete without reckful\nso reckful put us on the map 99% of you\nare here today because of reckful our\naverage viewer count priori reckful was\n100 after rectal it was 2000\nhe's the guy gave us the term AoE\nhealing and he gave people hope but why\ndidn't healthy gamer blow up it's\nbecause reckful came on and he was like\nhonest and authentic and like he let\npeople see him and like this is he was\nthe start of the silver bullet against\nthe disease of connection disconnection\nbecause what what happened with reckful\nis people connected to him they said\nthat's not him that's me and we're so\nseparate and what we need is to be\ntogether and I don't mean that in like a\n[ __ ] inspirational calendar kind of\nway I mean like very practically like we\nneed to connect to each other and it is\namazing that he was able to do that and\npeople thanked me and like sure so I'll\ntake some things but what I really want\nyou guys to understand this healthy\ngamer is not about me it's about you I\njust ask questions the information and\nwhat the learning comes from the person\nthat I'm talking to and he absolutely\ngave people hope and people were like\nman I'm gonna see a therapist like if\nreckful can get help like I can get help\nhe gave us hope right but it wasn't\nenough he had everything he had money he\nhad fame he had adoration he even had\nsix streams with dr. King and it wasn't\nenough and so he gave you hope and he\nkilled himself does that mean that you\nshouldn't lose hope makes sense right\nbecause reckful had it all\nshould you lose help\nmakes sense he's gone he's what got us\nstarted\nbut I don't think you should what's up\nand once again not because of a positive\ncalendar kind of way but I want you to\nthink about this because if he can lose\nthe battle\nyou can and what do I mean by that\nreckful had money he had fame he had\nadoration and access to dr. kay\nand what I want you guys to understand\nis if that month if money doesn't buy\nhappiness then being broke doesn't cause\nyou to lose happiness right these are\nindependent variables are they a factor\nwith each other absolutely but if he can\nlose you can win right now you guys look\nat your life and you say if only this\nwas different then I would be happy but\nwhat I want you guys to really\nunderstand about byron is all of those\nthings were different about him and he\nstill wasn't it wasn't enough but the\ncool thing is that like that's\ndevastating in some way but I want you\nguys to really understand that means\nthat the struggle against depression and\nsuicide and fighting that war means that\nyou at the end of the day it's about you\nit's a personal struggle and money like\nsure money helps because you're gonna\nhave access to resources and things like\nthat but for someone to be so loved and\nalso so and to still lose means that you\nactually have hope\nso if money doesn't buy happiness then\nbeing broke doesn't buy sadness and at\nthe end of the day there is nothing you\ncan do to afk at this game\nyou've got to fight it like it doesn't\nmatter whether you have advantages or\ndisadvantages whether you've got a suite\nlike epic sword or you've got some like\nhalf broken piece of trash like you've\ngot to fight the battle it doesn't\nmatter and no amount of anything that\nanyone can give you ultimately makes it\nso that you do not have to pick up and\nfight you've got to fight that bad\nand it is a personal battle but you guys\ndon't have to fight it alone\nand I think that despite all of reckful\n'he's out of everything that he gave to\nus i think at the end of it\nand unfortunately he was fighting it\nalone and he lost but just because he\nlost doesn't mean that you have to so\nwhat happens when a champion Falls he\ngave us so much like I remember you know\nbeing like a 20 year old kid playing Wow\nand like watching his videos and I was\nlike damn that guy's awesome like I wish\nI could be like that good Wow\nI was a fan he was a friend of mine and\nwhat do we do in a champion false so we\nstop talking it's a personal battle and\nall of us have to fight it but you have\nto fight it but you don't have to fight\nit alone you absolutely don't have to\nfight it alone and I don't want you to\nfight it alone and I'm not going to let\nyou fight alone\nI'm gonna fight with but I can't I can't\nI can't do it alone\nso I've got a pretty big HP pool I've\ngot 100 hit points I lost 80 of them\nyesterday\nI lost most of my HP bar and I'm you\nknow it's kind of like if it came when\nso my HP bars flashing and my UI is like\nred at the corners so I can't take much\nmore of this and every time I work with\nsomeone I I give a piece of myself to\nthem and yesterday the piece that I had\ngiven to rectal died with him and what\ncauses me to lose life is when y'all\nlose life so spirit like link [ __ ] and\nwhat causes me the game life is when\ny'all came and I can do a lot guys I\nreally can and I tried with reckful I\nreally did but I can't do this alone\nbecause at the end of the day I'm not\nsuperhuman I'm just me I have two hands\nI have one heart I have one voice I have\ntwo ears I'm human I want to be more\nthan human I try to be superhuman but\nI'm not and we think about reckful is\nsuperhuman but he wasn't either so this\nis the thing guys I can't do this alone\nand I can't take much more of it and so\nwhat I need you guys to do first and\nforemost is live cuz every time y'all\ndied piece of me diced that's what\nhappens a piece of us died yesterday\nand I need your help I need to do it and\nI need everything that we do here to be\nworth it Mitchell we get better because\nI could do this look each I did you look\nlike a boat making it your life that's\nwhat keeps me oh I can't take much more\nsad because I'm a human I gave a piece\nof myself to each and every one of you\nand I give it willingly but I don't have\nthat much left to give\nI just can't guys I'm sorry it reckful\ngave us the best part of him I don't\nknow if you guys realize that he worked\nhard and he struggled with this for\ndecades ever since his brother killed\nhimself and with Everland he tried to\ncreate what he needed as a child what\nwas ever land it was a place of\nconnection and he gave the best part of\nhimself for us\nstreaming connecting building Everland\ngiving us enjoyment\nhe didn't leave enough for himself\nso really what you guys need to do is be\nbetter take care of yourselves the last\nthing that he's giving us with his death\nis a call touch what are you doing the\nchampion balls you thought you'd pick up\nyou fight you eat you don't give up and\nif we fight before you do better reach\nyou with this war but you don't [ __ ]\nstop\nand just because he did doesn't mean\nthat we have to and there's a part of me\nthat says that you know you shouldn't\nblame yourself for is that than you\nreally shouldn't because it's really not\nanyone's fault but that doesn't mean\nthat you aren't responsible it doesn't\nmean that you have a dharma it just\nmeans we got to do better so take care\nof yourselves let someone else take care\nof you start to live and be an\ninspiration for other people get your\n[ __ ] together and if you can't get your\n[ __ ] together don't beat yourself up for\nit and let someone help you\nbecause I don't know how much longer we\ncan take this it's not just me this is\ngetting worse not better and it requires\neach and every one of us and understand\nthat if if you want us to win this war\nif you care about twitch and you care\nabout me and you care about everyone\nelse even if you're a piece of [ __ ] you\ndon't care about yourself you better\ntake care of yourself because you owe it\nto us to not have a piece of us die with\nyou\neven if you're not worth it we're worth\nit and do it for us\nso he gave us the best parts of who he\nwas and I am too so don't leave us\nhanging\nyou owe us no less you owe him no less\nthan to give the best parts of who you\nare\nif you do any less than that I'll be\ndisappointed thank you guys very much\nfor giving me this opportunity to speak\nlet's not let him down\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\nyou"
