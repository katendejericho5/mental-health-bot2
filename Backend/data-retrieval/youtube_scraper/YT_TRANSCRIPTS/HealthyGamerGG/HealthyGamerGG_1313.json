    "transcript": "oh no no problem thank you so much for\nhaving me on the show I just feel I\ndon't know I'm really excited to come on\nI'm really nervous but I'm excited for\nwhat I could take away from it so what\ncould you take away from it\num I guess but I really wanted to come\non for is sorry I'm like such a crier I\nreally am and some of this stuff is kind\nof hard for me to talk about um but I\nfeel like I would say 2012 to 2016 17\nwere really horrible points in my life\nthere was just like kind of like the\nseries of events that happened and it\nwas really long last time yeah um it was\nI don't know it was really difficult and\nI feel like I came to a point where I\nfeel like the dust has kind of settled I\nguess and I'm ready to kind of process\nwhich is good scary for me but I don't\nknow okay\nI know this sounds I I know I ask people\nto sometimes like can I think for a\nsecond but can I just can I pull that\ncard out now can i play that card\nbecause you just actually just shared a\nlot and I need a moment to think about\nbecause I'm hearing a lot of different\nstuff from you so let me think out loud\nso the first thing is that I'm hearing\nyou facing something by coming on here\ntoday yeah I'm hearing that it's hard\nfor you in some ways I'm hearing that\nalso like I just have to just take a\nstep back and think about you said 2012\nthe two thousand sixteen or seventeen\nwas a hard period that's years yeah yeah\nI um I guess I could go into detail okay\nyou know I'm ready to go into detail\nokay go for it oh god I mean it was like\na lot of years it's a long story um but\nI feel like it all kind of started out\nand this is like particularly sorry I'm\nsuch a crier so why do you apologize for\nbeing a crier let's talk about that um I\ndon't know I feel like I'm kind of um\nI'm like I can't believe I'm already\ngetting emotional I was gonna try to\nhold it together uh can we talk about\nthat for a moment yeah okay I understand\nthat you want to tell the story but\nlet's stop and just look at so you're\nhaving an emotional reaction and I'd\nlike to understand what about holding it\ntogether is important why can't you come\non and be a shitshow from second twenty\nnine I guess I'm just like afraid that\nit'll like kind of spiral like I feel\nlike a lot of it has been kind of stuff\nthat I've been suppressing for a long\ntime because I'm afraid of like that\noutcome I guess what's the outcome that\nyou're afraid of um I don't know I feel\nlike kind of like processing it is just\ngoing to put me out for a while you know\nlike mentally yeah that's gonna happen\nand I guess the idea of like you know\nlike being put out and maybe not being\nable\nto do my job you know my job since I'm a\nstreamer as well as I could\nit's scary to me sure so I so in it gets\nkaceytron yeah okay so kaceytron I think\nthat all of those are really valid\nconcerns and I do think that you know at\nthe end of an emotional conversation or\ndealing with your emotions you're gonna\nbe exhausted and it may impact your\nability to stream and that's normal and\nin my overwhelming experience generally\nspeaking like a week or two from now\nyour people tend to be in a better place\nalthough sometimes they aren't and if\nthey aren't you know if if this if your\nconversation today has ripple effects\nthat you're having difficulty dealing\nwith please let us know and we'll try to\neither support you ourselves or like\nconnect you with the appropriate support\nso that you can kind of get through that\nbecause I don't want to like you know I\ndon't want to like you know if you open\na can of worms then you have to deal\nwith that [ __ ] I don't want to leave you\nhanging does that make sense yeah no but\nI you know I think I think it could\nspiral that I'm here yes so so we'll try\nto help you with that spiral also so\ntwitch chat right they can actually\nsurprise you from time to time if you\nlean on them oh and you know they really\ndo and I guess like that's one of the\nother things that I wanted to say is\nlike you know like you said it was like\nsuch a kind of long period of time and\nreally during this time like the only\npositive thing I had was twitch she know\nthat was kind of my escape I guess so I\nI don't know I always just like think of\ntwitch very fondly oh yeah me too so you\naren't you and dive in yeah um so I feel\nlike it all kind of starts out and it\ndoesn't really start out in 2012 but um\nso I don't know I guess to summarize um\nI was with my boyfriend for a long time\nI was really close with his family like\nI had even moved in with them and\nhis younger brother was diagnosed with a\nreally bad form of childhood cancer and\nhe passed away in 2012 it was this is\nprobably like one of the harder things\nfor me to talk about but it was really\nhard sometimes the visuals from it is I\ndon't really bothersome to me mm-hmm\nsounds like they really burned an image\nin your mind yeah um it was just you\nknow like I've had I've had family\nmembers passed away from cancer you know\nwe all have that just something about it\nbeing a child was just especially like a\nchild that I was really close to I was\none of his main caregivers you know we\nwere very involved he was very sick you\nknow they needed as much help as\npossible I was actually I was actually\nholding his hand whenever he passed away\nand just like the way that he the way\nthe cancer had just eaten him alive\nuh it was really really hard yeah\nso that's I feel like kind of where the\nturmoil starts and during this time my\nmom had relapsed on meth and it was like\nafter this had happened I never really\nwas able to process it because my mom\nalong with my stepdad who was extremely\nextremely abusive to her had both\nrelapsed on meth and this went on for it\nwas like a very abusive relationship for\nthree or four years like I thought he\nwas gonna kill my mom\nand he didn't um but yeah I guess that's\nlike kind of really summarizing it [ __ ]\nthat's a lot any one of those is hmm so\nkaceytron how do you what do you think\nabout all that stuff I mean that's a lot\num it's really weird looking back on it\nnow because I remembered then feeling\nlike so um I don't know like so grown up\nlike such an adult and whenever I like\nthink back at it now you know whenever\nI'm almost 30 like I think like I was in\nmy early 20s\nyou know whenever they said sure started\nhappening and\nI don't know like I guess whenever I\nlook back at it now I just think like\nhow was I able to deal with it\num like I feel like I couldn't do it\nagain\nya know I think that that makes sense\nhow do you how do you feel like you were\nable to deal with it um I feel like I\njust wasn't really able to feel for I\ndon't know like several years I guess\nyeah um like I feel like that was like\nreally the only way I could go on I\ndon't know like I guess I really\nsummarize the the abuse that my mom\ndealt with but it was just God it was\njust so relentless\nlike I don't know like I hate calling\nhim my stepdad I don't want to call him\nby name obviously like I don't want to\nsay his name or anything - um is there\nany is there any danger to you or your\nmom or anyone else if you talk about\nthis more in a public setting no we\nwould need to think about that make sure\nthat no there isn't\nhe's been out of our lives for\ncompletely I would say about three years\nnow but I guess another thing that's\nkind of hard about it is he was in my\nlife like ever since I was five years\nold you know and he had never really\nbeen that abusive to my mom he had hit\nher you know like I think me and I feel\nlike I'm not either\nyeah I want you to listen to this\nsentence he had never really been that\nabusive to my mom right you know which\nlike that's that's something that I've\ncame to realize more and more since I've\nbeen kind of processing it as you know\nabuse is abuse no matter what and it's\njust like I remember then it just didn't\nreally click\nyou know just even to like I guess like\nother family members um you know it was\nlike everybody was upset about it like\nthe times that it had happened and it\nwas awful but it just you know it got\nbrushed off I think is like a lot of\nthose situations do right and then um\nwith the relapse it was just like it got\nso bad like there was probably like I\nsaid like a four year period where I did\nnot see my mom without some sort of like\nbruise or concussion or stitches or\nsomething like something like for four\nyears and because she was using at the\ntime it was really hard to get her to\nleave which I don't really you know\nhold any resentment why not\num I guess I hold more resentment\ntowards him you know because at any\npoint he could have left why didn't he\nlike why didn't he at any point you know\njust leave and stop terrorizing my\nfamily because that's what it felt like\njust like three four or five years of\njust like utter terror there was\nit was just like it went on so much like\nI can't even like begin to describe it\nwas like a daily thing like my mom would\ncall me and a lot of the time I would be\nstreaming and she would just hang up and\nI'd be like oh [ __ ] and just turn off my\nstream and drive over there it would\njust be like this all the time\nafter my grandma passed away it got even\nworse I remember literally the day of my\ngrandma's funeral he broke into the\nhouse and he attacked my mom in the\nshower and just beat the [ __ ] out of her\nshe had like a huge knife on the side of\nher head at the funeral and it was like\neverybody knew\num I don't know there was a time I have\na younger brother who was he wasn't\nphysically abused by him he was only\nphysically abusive to my mom because it\nwas the person that he could get away\nwith it\nright um but he would be very mentally\nabusive to my younger brother my younger\nbrother has autism and it's actually his\nbiological son he would say things like\nhe was [ __ ] he wish he wouldn't have\nbeen born and that he wasn't his\nmy brother still struggles with that a\nlot\nI don't know like I guess just in a lot\nof ways it's just like it's like my\nfamily still struggles with it every day\nmy mom lives with me to you and my\nstruggle\nwhat is this struggle that you guys deal\nwith my mom has pretty severe paranoia\nand it's\nin a lot of ways I think it's just\nbecause she was used to being beaten\nevery day for so long it's just like\nshe's constantly in this like kind of\nfighter flight and I feel like in a lot\nof ways I kind of am too we'd get to you\ngreat and maybe notice but you're\ntalking about everyone else see that I\nguess yeah and I guess throughout all of\nthis it was like I was I was the person\nyou know like I was the person who had\nto be there for my family like I'm the\noldest um I had to take on a lot what\ndid you tell you now um you know my\nmother and my younger brother started\nliving with me it was kind of back and\nforth with my mom like I said she was\nyou know under the influence and\nit was difficult because you know she\nwouldn't stay clean so like during all\nof this going on it was really hard not\nto be angry with her because of her\nconstant use and I guess the other thing\nthat made are really difficult is\nwhenever my grandma passed away she got\nyou know like a pretty decent\ninheritance so she got she got like\n$100,000 so it was just like she had\nlimitless income so it was very\nexhausting yeah it was very exhausting\nwhat was it dealing with it was just\nlike he couldn't keep up it was like\nhere my mom was with this really\nextremely abusive person and um she had\njust like inherited all this money she\nwas a user and it was just like great\nhere's like you know a two three-year\namount of time where it's like she's\nnever going to run out of money just to\ncontinuously abuse right I don't know I\njust got couldn't stop it yeah it was\nyou know completely out of my control\nall I could really do is just like stand\nby and watch you know because during\nthis time I was\nsuccessful and doing well on twitch like\nI earned enough to be able to take care\nof my younger brother and you know my\nmom was able to stay at my house\nsometimes but it would get really\nfrustrating because\nyou know she would like show him where I\nlived like there would always be like\nthis point where she you know she'd like\ntry to sneak him around and she would\nkeep seeing him which like they don't\nblame her for I don't really hold any\nresentment\ntowards her for it um not even is it um\nmaybe a tiny bed I guess I try not to ah\nthat I can get behind\ntry not to I can make sense to me but it\nboggles my mind that\nI mean it sounds like you were carrying\nthe world on your back and it sounds\nlike I mean I can just I'm just putting\nmyself in my shoes I would feel probably\nincredibly frustrated that she didn't\nhelp more and I can imagine I'm gonna\nkeep talking for a second okay and I can\nimagine that I would want to try to\nforgive her and I would forgive her and\nI could still harbor resentment and I\nwould try to keep that resentment at bay\nand I would try to decide that I'm gonna\nbe a good person and it's not her fault\nand at the same time I would still in\nthe deepest darkest parts of my soul I\nwould have anger and resentment\nyeah yeah I guess I would say that\nthat's pretty true like there's a part\nof me that like really resents you know\nthat you know I guess during might come\nup on Twitch because during this time\nthat all of this was happening I was you\nknow like kind of having my breakout\nmoment I guess and I couldn't really\nfocus on it there were times where I\nremember like I would have I know you\nwere robbed of joy yeah yeah that's\nyeah\nlike now that I think about a kaceytron\nwhat I'm hearing more and more from you\nis that you got robbed of so many things\nyeah it's really like you said it's\nreally hard for me to talk about it like\nin reference to myself um I think a lot\nof it just has to do with me maybe being\nthe oldest and then like I said just\nfeeling like I have had to be kind of\nthe protector for my family mm-hmm so I\ndon't know what's it like to be the\nprotector um\nexhausting\nand I think for a second case trial how\nyou hold it up I'm starting to kind of\ncalm down a little I guess I'm just like\nreally kind of um I know I guess like a\npart of me is kind of embarrassed\nbecause I just sound so white trash you\nknow\nand I guess like I'm kind of worried you\nknow what people think sure whose fault\nis it that you sound the way that you do\num in what way like whose fault is it\nthat I sound yeah you say you sound like\nyou're white trash and I'm saying like\nwho's responsible for those\ncircumstances or the story that your\ntalent I don't know I guess my parents\nyeah I think it's important to remember\nthat right cuz like I know in time\nanyway I'll get to that in a second but\nyeah yeah I think it's important to\nremember that I'm not going to try it\nall argue with you that you sound like\nwhite trash but what I would encourage\nyou to remember is there is an infinite\namount of distance between sounding like\nwhite trash and be white trash because\nI'm not hearing any iota of you being\nwhite trash\nin fact I'm hearing quite the opposite\nI'm hearing a story of courage and\ndependability of resilience and pain and\nODS sacked heavily heavily against you\nthank you and ultimately I'm hearing the\nstory of triumph with a terrible\nterrible cost\nwhat do you think about that you think\nthat you don't I don't know I guess I\ndon't give myself enough credit I can be\nvery critical of myself yep we're not\nreally seeing a whole lot of it yet but\nI imagine it's down there oh god sorry\nyeah like I said I'm like such a crier\nand this is just like not easy I can\nimagine to talk about do you want to\ntalk about this I do okay um I do want\nto talk about it um I don't know like I\nfeel like one of the things that I feel\nlike one of the things that really helps\nme is just like not that I would want\nanybody to have the same sort of issues\nbut you know finding you know that\npeople can relate to it and I feel like\nsomebody can kind of you know relate to\nmy story in some way and not feel so\nalone you know them that's what it's all\nabout right like do you feel alone\nsometimes yeah I guess hmm I guess I'm\njust like always felt not normal and I\ndon't know I wouldn't say like I don't\nfeel like I've had some super\nunfortunate life or anything like that\nwhy not by the way I have like this\nreally I think certain kaceytron I have\nlike this really I have this thing that\nI do and I think a lot of it has to do\nwith um Ricky and I was who passed away\nhe was only 7 I think a lot of it kind\nof has to do with that like I feel like\nin a lot of ways that warped my reality\na lot and in a lot of ways like I just\nfeel like this need to feel grateful no\nmatter what and I feel like sometimes I\nkind of use it as a cop-out and I'm kind\nof you know coming to that realization\nlike fairly recently like I like you\nsaid I think it's good to feel grateful\nbut I feel like a lot of the time I use\nit as like a way of not allowing myself\nto feel yeah why do you feel like you\nhave to be okay can I jump in can i yeah\nI've been trying my best to listen yeah\nbut I have I have a lot of thoughts okay\nso is it okay if I ask a couple of\nquestions yeah okay um you gotta let me\nknow if me asking questions makes things\neasier for you or harder for you so I'm\ngonna check in with back in like five to\nten minutes okay\nokay so when you say you've with Ricki\nwhen he passed away you somehow came\naway with the conclusion that you have\nto be grateful no matter what what's up\nwith that\num I guess\nI guess I just feel grateful for my\nhealth\nand my family's health every day\nI guess I have like a lot of like\nselfish feelings sometimes but reference\nto that like guilt\none of the which is kind of funny but\none of the things that I have issues\nwith a lot is just because he was very\ninto video games one of the things that\nI have issues with a lot is um playing\nvideo games sometimes which is weird\nsince I'm a twitch streamer right I\nusually like do you have um like anytime\na game comes out that I know he would\nhave liked\num it's just like difficult I don't want\nto play it\num sure what makes that play cuz it just\nfeels like he is like missing out on\nsomething that he shouldn't have\num and and I know I've asked you a\ncouple of times if you're if I should\ncall you kaceytron I have trouble it's\njust it's having I'm having trouble\ngetting met to role or you can call me\nCasey that's fine thank you very much so\nCasey I'm gonna just ask you a question\nso I'm gonna ask you are you in a place\nwhere you think you can reflect on a\nstatement that I make yeah okay so I'm\ngonna give you a scenario let's say that\nwe have a 23 year old girl who has\nessentially a brother who is dying of\ncancer and dies of cancer at the age of\n7 and then she says that based on this\nexperience I feel grateful and selfish\ndoes that add up to you know what do you\nimagine that person should feel like\nwhat would you predict that person to\nfeel if they lose a seven-year-old\nbasically what sounds like brother dude\nand watch them wither away to cancer sad\nyep what else\nI don't know I guess maybe a little bit\nI don't know how they like [ __ ] up\nfrom it\nand you know what the [ __ ] up looks\nlike\nlooks like you saying that you're\ngrateful and selfish that's the [ __ ]\nup people dying of cancer does not make\nother people grateful and and what I see\nwithin you is a war between the ocean of\nnegativity and the bastion of positivity\nyeah right I and and I think what we're\ndealing with here is like and sorry I'm\ngonna jump around okay so yes and if it\nI don't make sense please let me know so\nwhat I'm hearing from you overall is\nlike loans and debts like you're like\nhow was I able to do this and you're\nspiraling out of control now like\nbasically I think you took an emotional\nloan and now you're paying back that\ndebt cuz that's what we do this for a\nlong time years it sounds like you had\nto be strong but that strength doesn't\ncome from nowhere that's like you're\nyou're taking out a loan against future\nearnings there's a there's an emotional\nprice to be paid\nyeah and now the devil wants us to and\noddly enough that's a good thing because\nthat's what healing looks like because\nthere's a lot of hurt that you have\nbuilt up and kept in their weird ways\nthat your mind has struggled to survive\nI don't blame you for that but like look\nI mean come on yeah you watched a\nseven-year-old die of canceled cancer\nand that you're saying I'm great\nlike what look I get where that comes\nfrom I think it's amazing that you could\ndo that I think it's the only way you\ncan survive that right because if you\nlet the damn loose and the negativity\ncomes you could not afford to spiral\nthem like how the [ __ ] are you supposed\nto spiral when you have a brother with\nautism\nyou know this kid dying of cancer in\nyour house and your mom is using math\nlike there's no that like you can't\nafford to pay that emotional price then\nand so you're paying it now yeah\nlet's come to that realization in a lot\nof ways how so did you help us\nunderstand that a little bit um I don't\nknow like lately I've been like I said\nlike I feel like I used like this I like\nI'll constantly always like refer to\nlike you know there's people who have it\nworse and you know if anything I should\njust feel grateful that I'm here and I'm\nin good health and you know everything's\nokay um I feel like sometimes I just\ndon't want to ask for much more than\nthat I guess in a way yeah\nwhat do they how do make yeah how does\nit feel to ask for more like I'm being\nselfish I don't know\nI don't know I guess like I just feel\nlike things like there's just like a\npoint in my life where I just felt like\nthings were so bad like where I'm at now\nwhere things are you know like not that\nbad a lot better like I just feel like I\ndon't want to ask for much more than\nthat\nyou know so I think there's something\nsubtle and potentially dangerous here\nfirst is that I think it's important to\nhave gratitude and I think I hear from\nyou genuine gratitude yeah right so it's\nimportant to acknowledge where you come\nfrom like I have a lot of gratitude\naround where my parents came from and\nwhat I have um I have it really really\ngood and my parents did it yeah and so I\nthink it's important to express\ngratitude and acknowledge that and it\nsounds like you really do have a lot of\nthings to be grateful for how you doing\nby the way I'm doing okay I'm starting\nto you know it's like like I said I'm\njust like very anxious you know it's\nembarrassing\nwhen I think about\nI don't know like I guess I'm just like\nI know it's so like I know I shouldn't\nbe but it's hard not to worry what\npeople will think of me or how they'll\nthink of me differently\nwhy shouldn't you worry what people\nthink about you of course you should\nworry yeah okay see you make one mistake\nwhich is that you just invalidate the\nway that you feel that's a yeah right so\nlike of course you're gonna be like who\nthe [ __ ] when you come onto the Internet\nand you talk about how you grew up in\nyour works I don't I'm sort of saying\nthis yeah to make a point in a white\ntrash household\nhow do people think about people who\ngrow up in white trash households but I\nthink the really cool thing about your\nstory\nis that it is overwhelmingly clear to me\nthat you are not white trash\neven though Khalid I'll acknowledge 100%\nthat it may look white trash yeah and\nit's okay for you to be afraid of being\njudged yeah and and this is this is the\nthe basic issue that I see is that like\nyou don't let yourself feel bad things\nyou're not allowed to be afraid of being\njudged for white trash I shouldn't feel\nthat way yeah I shouldn't feel sad I\nshouldn't feel angry yeah like breaking\nout on Twitch is supposed to be [ __ ]\nawesome yeah\nand Casey I don't know how to say this\nbut like you got robbed yeah like I I\ndon't know like\nI was talking about resentment earlier\nand how I don't hold any resentment and\nI I do you know I do to a certain degree\nI try not to I think there was a time\nwhere I felt a lot more resentment like\nI feel like I've gotten a little bit\nbetter about it in the past year or two\num but there was definitely a time where\nI was really frustrated with my mom\nbecause it did feel like I was\nrobbed hey Casey\nyou got to let me know if I'm gonna be\nan [ __ ] okay yeah because I'm gonna\nsay something to you I think it could be\nhurtful to you but at the same time I\nfeel like it's important to say not so\nmuch for you but for everyone else out\nthere is that okay yeah okay\nso do you blame your mom\num\nit's hard to I don't know actually agree\nit's hard hard to okay especially just\nseeing how she is now it's hard to okay\num I don't know\nokay so let me ask you another question\nokay we're gonna think a little bit like\nanalytically and hopefully that'll help\nfrom an emotional perspective yeah so\ncan I forgive someone who didn't do\nanything wrong to me\nI guess you can forgive anyone for any\nreason but if they didn't do anything\nwrong like can I forgive someone for\nthrowing me an awesome birthday party No\nwhy not because they didn't do anything\nwrong\nyeah right so it's kind of interesting\nbecause I see this a lot where like the\npeople that we love we try not to blame\nthem which is wonderful and at the same\ntime there's a very subtle problem here\nwhich is like it gets you stuck yeah\nright you can love her you can\nappreciate what she did for you you can\nacknowledge that there's a disease here\nand it was like a roll of the dice and\nit may not be fair to blame her but I\nthink you should absolutely blame her\nanyway there what I what I what I would\nreally love I think the direction you\nneed to go is to not be one-sided to\nacknowledge that like at the end of the\nday like it sounds like you were the mom\nand she was the kid that's not fair to\nyou and I think that as much as\naddiction is a disease and like in my\nday job I'm an addiction psychiatrist so\nI get this but I think not holding\npeople who have addiction problems\naccountable for their actions doesn't\nactually help yeah and and the concern\nthat I have for you is that like I don't\nthink you can forgive her if you don't\nadmit that she did something wrong now\nthat's kind of interesting because maybe\nshe didn't do something wrong or maybe\nyou've already forgiven or maybe you\ndon't need to forgive her but generally\nspeaking when I hear a story like this I\nthink about something called Dharma\nwhich means duty or responsibility and I\nthink that like the wave for this my\nvalue system you don't have to agree\nwith this it's just something that I'd\nlike you to think about is that like\nwhen you have a relationship where some\nlike you can love someone but actually\nthe way to move forward is to like look\nat it like it is and say hey this really\nsucks for me it really wasn't fair and I\nforgive you for it because that's what\nhealing looks like it's not saying\nnothing bad happened to you because\nthat's how you end up with gratitude for\nwatching a seven-year-old die of cancer\nlike sure there's gratitude there\nthere's an appreciation for life I get\nall those things\nI've watched seven-year-olds die of\ncancer - and it's not pretty\nyeah and at the same time it's given me\nan appreciation for life and I'm\nabsolutely grateful for those\nexperiences because it helps you\nunderstand the depth of suffering that's\npossible in this world and it [ __ ]\nsucks to go through and it's not fair\nright and I felt guilty for having\nhealth and that's not fair either it's\nnot my fault that I'm you know it's like\nit's weird like I'm not cell I mean I\nfelt selfish - yeah and at the same time\nhow do you have my dogs it's okay\nwhat is it like listening to me talk um\n[Music]\nsorry dogs\num I don't know I guess in a lot of ways\nI always say that it's like I sorry my\ndogs I have two beagles and they just\nbarked non-stop um do they need some\nattention do they are they sensing a\ndisturbance in the force\ngetting them I think but I guess talking\nto you is really helpful because I feel\nlike I've never really had like a parent\nfull guidance I guess like that's one of\nthe things that I really struggle with\nis I feel like a lot of people are able\nto talk to you know like my mom or their\ndad about things and you know both of my\nparents are like the last people I would\never want to talk to sure yeah I mean I\nI think that that makes a lot of sense\nto me\nand I think there are a couple of other\nthings to think about here which is that\noh man okay\nso I'm glad so I'm happy to hear that\nI'm happy to sort of fill somewhat of a\nparental figure in your life I think I\ndo wanna let me just think about where\nto take the con any thoughts that you\nhave or any questions or anything that\nyou want to kind of dig more into or\nbecause I have a lot but\nI don't know there are like just a lot\nof different I feel like there's a lot\nof different elements so I guess my\nstory that I feel like I need to dig\ninto okay um I guess one of the things\nthat I really still struggle with a lot\nis just\ntrying to wrap my mind around all of the\nreally awful abuse and just how there\nwas like really no justice and like I\nsaid like I feel like my family still\nsuffers with it actually did and it's\nlike he just got away with it and you\nknow it's like I doubt he thinks about\nyou know how it's affected my family\nthere's like a lot of anger there I\nguess\nimagine huh what is what happens in your\nhead when you think about him getting\naway with it like he's left destruction\nand ruin in his wake\nand he gets to move on and you all are\nleft in a city of shambles it just feels\nreally unfair and unjust and\nI gosh I don't want to get banned for\nsaying this but there were you know like\nthroughout the years where this went on\nthere were definitely times where I\nwould like talk to my sister and just be\nlike man I wish I could kill him not\nthat I ever would but you know of course\nit's hard not to have those thoughts\nwhenever you just have somebody just\nlike relentlessly terrorizing your\nfamily like\nsure I think it's good that you didn't\ngive in to those thoughts right um\nand I mean I never would but it was\nsomething that sure I had you know there\nwas\nyou\nit just was like everyday like I like I\nlike I said it was just like it went on\njust like so much and it was just like\nso regular like he would you know steal\nmoney from my mom he stole my mom's car\nhe here's the time where he like made my\nbrother get in the trunk of a car and he\nstabbed my mom think I was gonna kill\nthem he like drove for four hours and\nmade my brother get in the trunk of a\ncar and he stabbed my mom like three\ntimes\num I don't know I just think about it\nand I'm just like how did he get away\nwith it like how did nothing happened to\nhim and I know that it's it's because my\nmom was too afraid to press charges or\nanything but it was just there were\ntimes where I would have to go over\nthere and he would usually like leave\naround the time where like I showed up\nhe'd just like take off because he was\nafraid I was gonna call the cops or\nsomething I don't know\nand my mom would just like beg me she'd\nbe like lady just stay here will you\njust stay like if he sees you're here he\nwon't come he'll leave me alone and I\nwould just have to just stay over at my\nmom's\njust because I guess I'm just like some\nsort of protection\nwhat's it like to have that kind of\nresponsibility\nwhenever I look back at it now it seemed\nwhenever you look back at it now it\nseems really scary but I remember them\nnot really being afraid I guess\nOh sounds unfair to me\nhow's that a lot on your shoulders\nyou\nyeah\nthat's hard exhausting\nsuperhuman even yeah\ndo you think of yourself as superhuman\nI guess on a good day I go back what I\nhear that I have moments where I feel I\nguess like very strong and resilient but\nthen moments were not so much and what\ndo you feel in those moments like um\nlike I'm capable of dealing with\nwhatever's thrown my way I guess\nlike I can overcome anything\nwhat do you feel in the moments where\nyou don't feel like that um really um I\nguess because I have kind of had to be a\nbit of a provider I'm in moments where I\ndon't feel like that like I just feel\nlike\nlike a complete failure like\nyou know like you said like I feel like\nI do carry a lot in my shoulders and I\nhave\nyou know my mom and my younger brother\nlived with me\nlike I feel stressed that I won't be\nable to provide for them I guess\nhmm like that's\nGary to me\nyeah do you feel like you've let people\ndown um no\nthey don't really feel like that at all\nI'm happy to hear that too\nyou know go ahead sorry I was just gonna\nsay like I think I do well I guess I'm\ncoping with things in some way but then\nI just do kind of a really bad job in\nother ways it's like I'm somewhat there\nbut I don't know like one of the things\nthat I always say and I didn't realize\nlike how wrong it was to say until I\nwould say like the past like five or six\nmonths is\nI always say that my mom raised me to\nthe best of her ability like she did the\nbest that she was capable of doing\nand you know like I'm\ngrateful for that I guess and I haven't\nrealized until recently that that's just\nlike another kind of like cop-out excuse\nthat I kind of use\nwhat are you excusing how are you\ncopying out like I don't want to say\nthat my mom was a bad mother but she I\nsee like I always say like she was the\nbest mother that she was capable of\nbeing and she tried\nin the ways that she could but you know\nlike I feel like if I'm I guess if I\nwere looking at it from an outside\nperspective I would be like yeah that's\na pretty bad mom he said what does the\ncop-out help is the cop-out that you're\nnot holding her responsible for yeah\nyeah I would agree with that so I\nactually had this precise scenario with\none of my first therapy patients where I\nnoticed that he said that his dad did\nthe best that he could yeah and then one\nday I realized he never said that his\ndad did a good job yeah so that he did\nthe best that it could yeah and I think\nthat there's some there's some middle\nground between understanding that she\ndid the best that she could and also\nunderstanding that she didn't do a great\njob and understanding that you can\nforgive her because you love her and\nalso that like you deserved better yeah\nright and I think this is the tricky\nthing about the mind is that we try to\ndo things like it's like it's really\nhard for us to not be either/or it's\nlike a or b it's like true/false no it's\nnot it's like it's free answer it's like\nan essay question yeah right and and\nwhat I'm really hearing from you and I\nthink what's important for you is to\nreally acknowledge like I mean you can\nbe grateful and you can be strong and\nyou can be all of these things but\nthey're also like the there's like the\nunderbelly to all this [ __ ] which is\nKaycee this is awful\nthis tire story is just it's it's bad\nman and yeah and like I I'm not trying\nto blame anyone I'm not blaming you I'm\njust saying like objectively when I hear\nthis it's like you know any one of those\nthings is enough to really just destroy\nsomeone watching a seven-year-old die of\ncancer\nthat's enough having a mom who uses meth\nthat's\nhaving an abusive stepdad that's enough\nhaving a brother with autism that can be\nreally hard yeah right because like you\nwant so much for him in it and it can be\nhard sometimes when people have autism\nlike caregivers really suffer because\nyou recognize that it can be hard for\nhim to be happy and that's really hard\nto watch\nyeah gosh I love you know like I love my\nbrother so much and I always tell him\nthat he's one of the strongest people I\nknow and it is really difficult to see\num you know how he has dealt with the\nabuse as well because I don't know like\nit's like my whole family has like like\nmy brother definitely has PTSD my mom\nhas PTSD I have PTSD like you guys ever\ngotten treatment for it\nno yeah that needs to happen at some\npoint yeah it's you know it's hard\nbecause sure um you know like I do come\nfrom like a low-income family and the\nonly time where my mom has been able to\nget like any mental health care I guess\nis whenever she hasn't been like earning\nenough and it's like you know oh if you\nmake $12 an hour that's too much yeah\nwhich is just a joke but you live in\nthat arrest yeah after we're done with\nthis caulk and um you know after we're\ndone with the stream like let me know\nwhat state you're in and then I'd love\nto have a conversation with you about\nmaybe had a game plan in terms of how to\nget mental health treatment because I\nthink there's no doubt in my mind that\nthat would be very helpful for all of\nyou it's I don't know like I'm not\ntrying to say like it wouldn't it's just\nreally really difficult with my mom um\nmy mom is very I don't really know like\nmy mom\nlike I said she has really extreme\nparanoia and she like literally thinks\nthat like everybody is an undercover cop\nor spy she thinks that our house is\nbugged\nshe thinks that like her phone is bugged\nlike if she were to go to a counselor so\nthere it was just like it's really hard\njust I don't know she's one of those um\nI think a lot of it has to do with like\nall of the abuse and she'll still even\nthough it's been it's been like three\nyears she's still like acts like he's\nout to get her like uh it's I don't know\nit just like kind of puts another\nobstacle with you know what about you\nlike as far as me getting late\nI guess I've just always kind of like\nhad a hard time like\nyou\nI don't know like I guess I it's hard\nfor me to talk to therapists because I\nfeel like there's just like with twitch\nI feel like there's just this whole\nelement of my life that's like really\nhard for them to kind of understand\nyeah so okay let's talk about that for a\nminute okay so the first thing is that\nlike you know what we're talking about\ndoesn't have much to do with twitch\nright yeah and then the second thing is\nis that that and but I get what you're\nsaying I don't want to invalidate what\nyou said because I think it's an\nimportant statement I've heard this\nstory time and time and time again that\nyou know a lot of our community goes and\nseeks mental health treatment and sure\nlike the you know a therapist can\nunderstand you know growing up in an\nabusive household but they can't\nunderstand you and they absolutely need\nto understand you they can't treat like\nthe PTSD in isolation because a good\ntherapist has to understand who you are\nas a person and gaming culture streaming\nculture twitch or a part of that so I\nget what you're saying I don't think\nthat you can go there and just talk\nabout this and that's gonna actually be\neffective as bizarre as that sounds what\nI would encourage all of y'all to do\nthough is explain it to them yeah so as\na therapist there are all kinds of\nthings that I don't understand and at\nthe top of the list is I have some\nclients who are women yeah I don't\nunderstand what that's like I can't\nunderstand that's like and if you work\nwith a therapist it's actually your\nresponsibility to try to get them to\nunderstand and if they're a half-decent\ntherapist they'll do their best and one\nof the most interesting things that you\ncan learn about this stuff is when you\nstart to explain streaming culture and\ntwitch and your life to them\nyou are gonna understand more about it\nthan you ever realized it can actually\nbe one of the most therapeutic things to\nlike explain to someone like what's\nstressful about your job right teaching\nis where you actually like really\nsolidify your understanding so I would\njust strongly encourage you like I said\nwe can have a you know second\nconversation about logistics and stuff\nbecause I really do think Casey that you\nyou need like tried and true mental\nhealth treatment and I know that a lot\nof people think that this is mental\nhealth treatment but it really isn't\nit's night and day yeah um I don't know\nlike I said it earlier like I feel like\nI'm\nlike at a point where I'm ready and I\nfeel like this is kind of just like you\nlike opening myself up to the idea you\nknow like I feel like this is kind of\nlike a take-off point I mean I do I\nguess I do have some other things like I\nI haven't mentioned this yet but my\nmarijuana use\num I guess a lot like um I'm a marijuana\nuser I and I actually do have a medical\nlicense for it so I don't know like I\nguess I do self-medicate um and I don't\nthink that marijuana is like a terrible\nthing like honestly like I feel like in\na lot of ways that help it has helped me\na lot\num but I do acknowledge that I guess my\nusage has gotten pretty bad like I\nsmoked too much um sure and I feel like\na lot of it has to do with anxiety like\nI feel like when I struggle with the\nmost like from all of this is just\nanxiety like I um feel Restless a lot\nit's hard for me to sit down it's hard\nfor me to say you know like I just\nconstantly like have these wandering\nthoughts\num I guess sometimes\nI just get really really anxious about\nsomething bad happening I guess like I\njust get so anxious that something bad\nis going to happen again you know to\njust like bring me back to that or like\nit could get like that again is what I\nguess is one of my main fears\nyeah so let me say something about that\nso in my experience anxiety is a\nchameleon yeah\nactually sorry anxiety isn't a trauma is\na chameleon and it can look like all\nkinds of other things it can look like\nanxiety it can look like depression it\ncan look like substance use\nbut when you say I'm worried that\nsomething bad is gonna happen again\nthat speaks to me more about trauma than\nanxiety but I think generally speaking I\ndetest the term anxiety because people\nuse it as an umbrella term yeah it's\nlike you're afraid that something bad is\ngonna happen again not because you have\nan anxiety problem but because you live\nin a world where real bad [ __ ] can\nhappen and so that's your brain telling\nyou hey this can happen so let's worry\nabout it because if we worry about it\nthen we can do something about it that\nwon't catch us off-guard\nit's your brain trying to help you out\nbut that's I mean it sounds to me really\nmore like trauma and anxiety and there\nmay be anxiety in there I guess I've\nnever looked at it that way I guess you\nknow like like you said I don't know I\nguess I really didn't know how to think\nof what I was feeling and I guess what\nmade the most sense to me was anxieties\nlike I've never thought of it like I'm\nyou know like it's just trauma and I'm\nscared of like reliving that I guess um\nbut I feel like sometimes like I'll just\nbe like you said like I'm constantly\nkind of I don't know I guess preparing\nmyself for something like that like I\nfeel like a lot of times it can be kind\nof hyper vigilant like there are just\ncertain things like I feel like I kind\nof like the most recent thing um with\ncorona I was one of those people who\nwent out and stopped by because I was\njust so afraid I was like I don't want\nanything bad to happen to my family and\nthen I think you know just with the loss\nto cancer and that just being so rare\nyou know it's so extremely rare that a\nchild dies of cancer like that it just\nmade it all the more real that my family\ncould be one of those people\noh yeah like I just feel like there's\ncertain like I I think that there's I\nguess there's being like worried but I\nfeel like a lot of the time I see myself\nlike going the next step sure and and\nthat's because most people worry but the\nnext step is a hypothetical for them for\nyou unfortunately it's a reality yeah\nand that's what trauma looks like so\nhyper-vigilance is one of the main\ndiagnostic criteria for PTSD right it's\nlike the the plastic story that people\nhear is like a war veteran who like you\nknow hears like a car muffler go offer\nor something like that or a door slam\nshot and they're like always on the\nlookout and that's not they're not\nmentally ill that's their brain training\nthem hey if this sound happens we need\nto react first and think later\nthat's what trauma does to us right like\nif I get bit by a snake\nI'm gonna be paranoid about ropes that\nlook like snakes in dark rooms\nand and what you're kind of describing I\nmean like I think trauma is really like\nit's the real trickster of mental health\nbecause it can look like all kinds of\nthings it can look like paranoia it can\nlook like substance use it can look like\nanxiety it can look like depression and\nand this is where you know sometimes the\nanalogy that I use with people is like\nme you can plant a seed and the seed\nturns into a plant and then if I ask you\nKC show me where the seed is in the\nplant can you find it in the roots is\nthe seed in the roots I dig up the plant\nI look at all the roots is there a seed\nthere um\nI guess in the blossom it grew I don't\nknow the short answer is it isn't right\nit used to look\nit started in one way and then it turned\ninto something else although you can\nalso say that just because I can't find\nthe seed the plant is absolutely there\nand without the seed it would have never\nexisted even though it looks completely\ndifferent so in your case something\nhappened to you where a seed was planted\nand over a decade it has turned out to\nlook like something else yeah\nbut at the end of the day if you want to\ngo back and really free yourself of this\nI think you got to go back to where it\nstarted and there are a couple of things\nhere which we haven't even scratched the\nsurface of which I don't even know if\nyou've ever thought about yeah but I I\nwonder long and hard about what you were\nyoung\nbecause you feel selfish for having\nneeds right yeah yeah and so like the\ninteresting thing is like that's not\nbecause you're a good person in fact I\nlike it as like nothing - I mean sure\nlike you're a good person but generally\nspeaking people who feel like they're\nselfish for having basic needs are\ntaught that it's selfish to have basic\nneeds\nyeah we believe the things that we were\ntaught\nBret like our thoughts and our opinions\nyeah god I was gonna say like I've been\nthinking about this recently I don't\nknow I feel like it was never that\nanybody like told me oh you can't have\nthis certain thing or you can't do this\ncertain thing I just remember being very\nyoung and always just Casey like they\nabsolutely did but go ahead and say what\nyou're gonna say I was I just I guess I\njust remembered being young and just\nacknowledging that I was poor and my\nfamily didn't have money for these\nthings so never asking yeah so I I that\nI get but I think like you know if I had\nto put my money down I think it's like\nsubtle things so like how old how old\nwere you when your mom started using\nmeth um for five I guess my dad was my\ndad was in and out of prison most of my\nlife whenever I was younger and they\nboth my parents started using Ashley I\nwas probably more like three homes so\nlet me just ask you a question we're not\ngonna talk about you we're gonna talk\nabout a three-year-old yeah okay so what\ndoes a three-year-old do when they're\nhungry cry true food sure sometimes they\ncry but even before that I asked for\nfood absolutely right you go up to mommy\nand you say mommy I'm hungry can I have\nsomething to eat and when you have a\nparent who has substance use how do they\nrespond to that request um I don't know\nI guess I just remember my mom being\n[Music]\nah I did I my grandparents were really\ninvolved but I remember like during this\ntime whenever I was very young just like\nmy mom being incapacitated I guess you\nknow like you know having the highs and\nthen the lows where she would just like\nbe asleep for days mm-hmm and I remember\nlike I guess been very young and just\nlike saving my mom asleep and being like\nwell she's not gonna wake up\nyeah did you ever feel like you were\nbothering her yeah definitely right so\nlike what is bothering me\nit means hating absolutely hey I'm a\n[ __ ] three-year-old and I'm hungry\nand oh [ __ ] I'm sorry to bother you mom\nbut can I have some food because that's\nhow she made you feel because that's\nlike that's what a three-year-old thinks\nit's like oh I don't want like they just\nunderstand like so you get taught like\nat the age of three that your needs\ninconvenience other people and then you\nfeel selfish for needing stuff and it's\nlike baked so deep down man it's like\nwhy are like like literally I want you\nto think about this Casey a\nthree-year-olds brain is building it's\nlike it has an architecture and deep\ninto the architecture of the way that\nyour neurons is the idea that I am not\nallowed to have needs yeah and I guess\nthat's something that's kind of just\nechoed throughout my whole life\nI guess yeah and that's because you were\nwired that way right like that's why\nthey echo through your life because like\nliterally this is not it's not\npsychological it's like neurological and\nso now like everything sort of makes\nsense oh yeah I watch the seven-year-old\ndied of cancer and I'm grateful and I\nfeel selfish like what the [ __ ] because\nthat's the way you learned how to think\nabout things right like you learned like\nso the three-year-old isn't allowed to\nhave needs the 21 year old isn't allowed\nto have needs the 25 year old isn't\nallowed to have needs because your mom\nis using math and your brother has\nautism\nthere's no room and like we got this\nlike 30 minutes in right you talk about\nthe impact to everyone else\nwhere are you you don't deserve a place\nin your own story\nyeah there's no space for you even now\nwhen we talk about what are you worried\nabout it has nothing to do with yourself\nit's like what if I can't support my\nfamily there's no room for you and and\nlike you know when it comes back to like\nblame and being angry at your mom and\nstuff like that like in order for you to\nbe angry at your mom you have to be a\npart of the equation there's no room for\nthat there's only she did the best that\nshe could and let's give her a pass\nwe're just fine like I think it's good I\nyou know I don't in the sense like I\nthink you know people who suffer from\naddiction they have a disease - unclear\nwhat her upbringing was like she should\nget some slack we should be\ncompassionate and you should be a part\nof the equation I guess I'm just like I\ndon't even know how to yeah I don't know\nit's just like I just don't even know\nhow to start yeah\nbecause in that - is like not your fault\nbecause I would just think about this\nlike like you're like a three-year-old\nand I'm gonna let me know if I'm making\nyou feel like an [ __ ] or bad okay so\nlike I just want you to think about a\nthree-year-old who like was never taught\nlanguage and then they find themselves\nat 25 and they're like I don't know how\nto learn language and you're damn right\nyou weren't taught like this stuff gets\ntaught really really really early and it\ngets taught completely subconsciously\nparents don't try to teach it it's just\nhow kids learn like kids just learn\nstuff that has never taught to them\nright and my kid has been doing this\nthing recently where she'll come up to\nme and she'll go like this and like I\ndidn't teach her how to do that I didn't\nbe like okay hold up your hand like a\nclaw and trying to scare me like she\njust picks that up they just pick it up\nand and unfortunately Casey it's gonna\nbe a long road and it's gonna be\nconfusing it's almost more like rehab\nlike not like drug rehab but like like\nit's like you have to rehabilitate like\nsome of your emotional centers and your\nsense of self hey you can I know I don't\nknow like sometimes I just feel myself\nlike even like just doubting my own\nemotions I guess yeah I don't know like\nit's yeah of course because you've been\npushing them aside your entire life\nright like how did you do that when you\nwere 21 you don't think you could do\nthat again yeah because like your\nsurvival mechanism is to like discount\nand invalidate your emotions and it's a\ndamn good win and I'm glad you did it\nbecause I think that's why your family\nis still in the position that it's in if\nit weren't for you I can't imagine what\nwould have happened to your brother yeah\nand so now the question here's the real\nthing and I don't know I don't think you\nknow how to do this but can you be you\nfor yourself I don't know I guess it's\njust hard to even know what that looks\nlike\nabsolutely cuz it's [ __ ] weird Yeah\nright like can you protect yourself can\nyou look out for yourself like it's hard\nI don't even know like in your case I\ndon't even know where to start like I\ndon't know I mean I I see I see what\nneeds to happen I'm not quite sure where\nto begin but I think we've already begun\nit's it's kind of the acknowledgement\nand understanding that like you know you\ndon't have in\nhierarchy of what you care about\nyou're myself yeah lower yeah beautiful\nright so that's how it starts you finish\nthe sentence that I start and once\nyou're able to do that that means you\nunderstand right and we're not saying\nand I'm not advocating that you should\nbe number one and I don't think you're\nthe kind of person that can ever be\nnumber one in new life but can't we yeah\nI was I don't know like I was thinking\nabout it yesterday and I feel like\nthat's just what I am like that's what\nI'm used to being I'm used to being a\nprovider a protector sure you know it's\nlike it's hard to it's hard to think of\nmyself being a different way I guess or\nI guess like putting those guards down\nand not being that for my family scares\nme yeah so oddly enough I don't think\nthat that's what you have to do so I'm\nnot saying cuz I think you are a\nprovider I think you are a protector I\nthink you have a duty or the odd amount\nof responsibility to your family and I\nthink abandoning that would destroy you\nas a person that's what's kept you alive\nand so if people are curious about\nDharma this is what Dharma looks like\nhow are you able to survive all of this\nterrible stuff it's because of your duty\nresponsibilities to your family what I'm\nasking for is can you can you stick\nyourself in the top ten it's not even\ntop five top ten\nso there's mom there's brother maybe a\nromantic relationship to beagles can you\ngive yourself number six or number seven\nyeah I guess so like I said it's just\nlike hard to know like what that looks\nlike like what are the small steps that\nI can take to do that okay great\nquestion I just don't even know how so\nthey're like I'll do things like I feel\nlike in a lot of ways like I'll spoil\nmyself a lot like I'll go shopping and\nyou know before your your dogs protest\nyeah I guess so\nyou know like I'll take myself shopping\nor get my hair done or whatever but I\nguess just all material things\nuh-huh um I guess I just don't know how\nto aside from materialistically I guess\nI'm sure yeah absolutely I think it's\ntrickier\nI think conversations like this are\nactually like a big step forward right\nso giving your space the giving yourself\nthe time and space to think about\nyourself because I don't even know if\nyou let yourself do that right I'm\nhaving a dryer delivered so I'm sorry no\nI was saying that conversations like\nthis are a great place to start I'm just\nused to barking all the time do that the\nonly thing you used to hold on\nyou\nokay\nsorry no I'm sorry what were you saying\nI was saying that I think conversations\nlike this are a good first step because\nlike you're giving yourself space and\ntime to think about yourself right like\nyou're doing something like you're doing\nthis like who are you doing this for\nmyself\nis this materialistic no okay so that's\na step in the right direction right\nbecause what we're saying is you need to\ndo things for yourself that are not\nmaterialistic so great good job\nyou've done it high five yeah I think\nthe next thing that I would really\nreally encourage you to do is is get\nreally think about getting some kind of\ntreatment or therapy and how do you feel\nabout that I don't like I I have I have\nseen a psychiatrist but I guess I\nhaven't really like explored that aside\nfrom getting prescribes like I was\nprescribed adderall for my ADHD and then\nI also prescribed xanax which I don't\nreally like to take um I don't know like\nI don't really I don't really feel like\nI need to be medicated which I guess\nisn't the point of therapy right yep the\nexact opposite I don't know I I feel\nlike I could definitely benefit from it\nI just I guess it's just fear of maybe\nnot like what if I don't\nyeah yeah so that that's that's what we\ngot to kind of tackle head-on right\nbecause the issue here is that like what\nif you don't but like this is the thing\nyou only let yourself do it if it's\ngonna work because you know you're not\nworth trying things for\nsee that like you can only do it if it's\ngonna help like if there was something\nthat could help your brother you do it\nbut if there's something that could help\nyou that's not good enough it's not\nworth your time your energy your\nresources if it could help which is fine\nlike if something could help your mom\nget all four it could help your dogs\nyour all four it could help your brother\nyour all four it could help you not good\nenough yeah and so that's what I would\nencourage you to really tackle and think\nthrough and just give yourself a space\nto work on yourself and then you'll\nyou'll figure enough like I'm not\nworrying about you Casey bizarrely\nreally yeah\nI think I feel kind of relieved now I\nguess\nlike just in talking about it all and\nI feel like kind of I guess getting like\na positive response not that I was\nexpecting like anything bad I just I\ndon't know yeah I'm glad you feel that\ncan I tell you why I'm not worried about\nyou I mean I shouldn't but I'm not what\nI feel is not worried\nI feel optimism and here's the reason so\nwhat games do you play by the way do you\nplay games um I've been mostly playing\nteam fight tactics okay so I'm not too\nfamiliar League of Legends but so like\nhere's the thing like let's say you're\nplaying team fight um yeah I can't I\ndon't have a good analogy there so I'm\njust gonna make that point um so like\nhere's the thing like you were dealt a\npretty shitty hand in life and yet ended\nup okay yeah right\nand so like I'm Way more optimistic like\nwhat worries me and one is when people\nare given a great hand in life and they\nend up in a bad place because I think\nlike in your case you just need to you\njust need like a little bit of support\nand a little bit of tools and like\nyou're gonna you're gonna fly because if\nyou can get through what you've gotten\nthrough and be the person that you are\ntoday boy it's like it's like you're you\nknow you're playing a competitive game\nwith a potato PC on satellite internet\nand you're still crushing news and it's\nlike if we give you an actual computer\nand take the lag off it's gonna be\nterrifying what you're capable of\nbecause that's what I see and and if you\ncan just help yourself out a little bit\nlike it's gonna be ridiculous because\nyou're you've been playing life with a\n[ __ ] handicap this whole time and so\nwhat makes me optimistic is like if we\ntake off the handicap like people are\ngoing to start whining and they're gonna\nbe asking the devs for a patch because\nyou're crushing them so hard yeah sorry\nI just like I always just go back like I\ndon't know whenever you said that like I\njust always go back to like my life\nwasn't that bad yes you know like we've\nbeen talking about this whole time it's\njust like such a I don't know it's like\na defense mechanism type thing yet\ndefense mechanism type thing I think\nthat relates to the idea that like you\nhaving needs or selfish like you just\ndiscount yourself your life wasn't that\nbad okay fine I mean so I I'm I think\nit's this is the other thing is how do\nyou move forward you notice that right\nlike it's really really a huge support I\ncannot overemphasize how important the\nstatement that you just made us and you\njust have to trust me on that\njust act acknowledge it to see it yeah\nright because this is you're saying how\ndo I change my mind\nyou start by understanding what the [ __ ]\nis going on in there that's you opening\nthe hood of your car and that's what\nmakes me optimistic because you can\nnotice oh there it is again like there's\nthat pattern that pops up right and like\nif you want to know how to get rid of\nthat pattern or change the pattern the\nfirst thing that you have to do is see\nits action yeah you have to notice that\nthen you can start to change it but\nnoticing is where things start I'm able\nto notice it I guess but yeah like the\nchanging it part was just like a whole\nother thing because I'm just like how do\nI even I guess like you were saying\nearlier it's what did you say it's more\nlike a cycle of its neural logical than\npsychological like it's like a like just\nlike some circuit in my brain that's\nformed yeah like so like how do I it's\nlike I have to retrain my brain Casey\nCasey okay great now I'm excited okay\nand apologies if that's inappropriate\nbecause let me tell you let me tell you\nso this is cool so this is why I like\nneuroscience so I'm gonna say something\nthat is gonna hopefully blow your mind\nI find it mind-blowing the way that you\nchange your note neurons is actually\nnoticing there is overwhelming\nscientific evidence that changing your\nbrain does not require intention it\nrequires attention literally to\nattention is what causes neuronal\nplasticity\ncity and frontal lobe development that\nis the mechanism through which\nmeditation works so we have overwhelming\nevidence that meditation changes your\nbrain like we know that I've actually\nstarted meditation recently I've started\ndoing meditation recently like actually\njust like this past like a couple of\nweeks I would say cool that's good for\nyou I'm gonna get to that in a second\nbut I'm an academic and when I get to\ntalk about something that I know I like\nto keep going forward can I keep plowing\nso I want to just say that like\nliterally so Casey you're wondering how\ndo I change what I'm telling you\nactually don't need to like literally\nwhat what studies of meditation show\nbecause in meditation no one is trying\nto change anything they're just\nobserving themselves and what we see is\nthat observing yourself actually rewires\nyour brain they don't have to try to\nchange anything\nand that's why meditation works so well\nbecause it doesn't sort of matter what\nyour problem is it doesn't matter who\nyou are and just noticing it is\nsufficient for change and if you kind of\nthink about it like you can see that\nprinciple in other places because like\nyou know sometimes you'll be like oh why\ndo I do this and then you'll have like\nthis light bulb go off and you're like\noh that's why I do it and then you stop\ndoing it I never realised\ndot-dot-dot that drinking water makes me\nfeel good and then like one day people\nwake up and they're like oh I realized\nthat drinking water is good for me and\nthen I started drinking water and then\nyou ask people like how did you start\ndrinking one they're like I don't know I\njust sort of realized it one day it's\nweird\ndoes that make sense like you ever just\nlike realize something and then sort of\nlike started doing it yeah but I guess I\njust like it just made me think like how\nI've kind of like came to this realize\nrealization that I you know set my\nfeelings aside a lot or I don't allow\nmyself to acknowledge my own feelings\nand I feel like I have came to the\nrealization\nand maybe it's not changing that much or\nmaybe it is and it's just changing very\nslowly okay Casey so let me ask you a\nquestion\ndo you think coming when did you come to\nthat realization um I would I\nI think it's been fairly recent like I\nwould say six months okay so do you\nthink that has anything to do with you\ncoming on stream today\num yeah so that's how change happens so\nyou have one realization and that allows\nyou to take the next step which then\nallows you to take the next step and\nyou're looking at the top of Mount\nEverest and you're saying each step that\nI take does it seem to be moving me\ntowards my destination because I have\n30,000 feet to climb and I have now\nmoved up two inches doesn't seem to be\nmaking a difference but that's literally\nhow change happens yeah one step at time\nit's the only way to do it and so just\nkeep going on the path that you're on\nand you will be amazed at where you end\nup only way it can happen can't rush it\nthere's no magic bullet\nthere's certainly in a pill you're\nsaying how do I take care of yourself\nlike you realize something six months\nago\nwhy did you realize that six months ago\nbecause you spent the time thinking\nabout yourself which ten years ago or\neight years ago or seven years ago you\ndid not even give yourself the space in\nyour mind to think about yourself that's\na huge step then you have a realization\nthen you come on stream then we have a\nconversation then you decide oh maybe I\nshouldn't do therapy but like six years\nago you're like ah I'm not worth it\ntiny tiny steps a house is built one\nbrick at a time and no brick makes the\nhouse it's weird yeah like if I lay two\nbricks am i building a house yeah really\ncuz I just see two bricks where's the\nhouse show me I don't know I guess\nyou're so I was just thinking you're\nstarting to build a house where I'm just\nlike so anxious like my mind's racing\nit's okay sorry about that you see but\nyour your answer is actually the right\nanswer because it's the wrong answer I'm\nsorry I'm freaking you out\nbut like because it's exactly right is\nit the house sure you're starting but\nit's not the house yet it sort of is and\nit's sort of isn't and that's what your\ngrowth is gonna be like yeah yeah sorry\nI asked people questions and sometimes\nit makes them feel self-conscious it's\nthat way no I just\nlike I said I just like I'm I'm happy\nlike I feel like I'm having like a lot\nof realizations and stuff that you have\nsaid you know that made sense to me and\nit's just like it's it's you know like\nyou've just said like a few things that\nhave really I don't know I guess kind of\ndropped a bomb on me I guess and it's\njust like trying to process it all at\nonce right like I've been trying to\nwrite down notes and stuff but yeah I\nunderstand that they're good yeah yeah\nso I I am yeah I can I can see that it's\noverwhelming and I'm not sure if I\nshould say I'm sorry or you're welcome\nno it's been really helpful can you just\nhelp me understand what has been like\nwhat you realized um I guess you know\nlike I said I kind of been coming to\nthis realization that I um you know set\naside my own feelings and needs a lot in\nyou know like I have a lot of self-doubt\nand just hearing it from somebody else\nis like okay you know it kind of makes\nit more real like oh maybe I wasn't just\nthinking this maybe it's true like you\nknow um yeah certainly sounds true to me\nyeah so so actually that's it right so\nthere you did it you did it yeah you\nvalidated you validated your feelings\njust then I just realized that that's\npretty cool you see that I don't know if\nthat makes sense it's kind of abstract\nbut yeah like just in that\nacknowledgement that sometimes you don't\nacknowledge yourself you're\nacknowledging yourself yeah it's weird\nit's kind of like inception but anyway\noh yes I see what you're saying yeah see\nyou did it and you're like how do I\nchange in the short answer is I don't\nknow but just keep doing what you're\ndoing\nI think you'll you'll be good yeah do\nyou have questions for me Casey\num\nI guess one of the other things that I\nwanted I don't know like I talked about\nmy marijuana use and sometimes like my\nchat can just get cuz I do smoke too\nmuch like and I guess I acknowledge that\nI need to cut back but I'm like do I\nhave an addiction problem you know like\nI do like both of my parents have\naddiction issues I'm like as I don't\nknow I don't know but then it's really\neasy for me to just be like oh marijuana\nisn't a big deal he's you know like I'm\nI grew up around marijuana in my whole\nlife like my mom smoked marijuana in\nfront of me my whole life and did way\nworse [ __ ] and I guess like I feel like\nto some degree like oh if the worst\nthing that I do is smoke weed you know\nlike it's pretty good for me considering\num but I don't know like I guess I don't\nwant to cuz you know you don't know like\nthe full thing I guess but do you think\nthat I have an issue with addiction to\nmarijuana I know that sounds so stupid\nbut like sometimes like I don't know if\nthey're joking or C's deep do you think\nyou have an issue with marijuana I don't\nknow like I think I smoke too much but I\njust don't even think that it's that bad\nokay so I think I can get behind that\nso do I think you have an issue with\nmarijuana yes because you think you have\nan issue with marijuana yeah you think\nyou have an issue with marijuana it's\njust not a very big issue that's what\nI'm hearing from you is that a fair\nrepresentation I can get behind that\nyeah so here's what I'll say about\nmarijuana and substances in general okay\nyeah so I think that like you said you\nkind of you it sounds like you have\nmedical marijuana and that a lot of\npeople self medicate and I do I think\nthat that's a problem\nabsolutely but I think that nodding back\nis not a solution it's a consequence\nand if you want to cut back on your\nmarijuana use you have to deal with the\nreasons why you reach for it in the\nfirst place so if there's one thing that\nI've understand understood as an\naddiction psychiatrist it's that telling\nsomeone to stop drinking alcohol is not\nenough you have to get to why they drink\nalcohol in the first place and in your\ncase I think that you should reduce your\nmarijuana consumption absolutely even\ntry without smoking for like six months\nand just see what that does to your\nbrain because I think you're gonna be\nsurprised yeah and but that starts with\nlike recognizing that the reason that\nyou smoke is because all the [ __ ] that\nwe're talking about to begin with the\nanxiety which has really which started\nas the seed of trauma which grew into\nthe plant of anxiety in which you don't\nreally see the the seed there anymore\nand so you got to deal with all that\ncrap because like as long as that stuff\nis going on you said I don't know how I\nsurvived the way that you survived us\nthrough coping mechanisms yeah and that\nincludes things like marijuana yeah I\nguess I never I never even started\nsmoking marijuana until 2014 I was one\nof those people I was always really\nreally afraid I never drank I never did\ndrugs because you know I saw what it did\nto my parents nose genuinely afraid of\nit and my sister was always kind of more\nof the black sheep I guess of the family\nand she um you know one night we were\nhanging out and she was just you know\nshe got really excited because I was\nlike I want to try it and I tried it and\nI just remember during that time I was\nyou know it was really terrible time and\nI just remember like whenever I smoked\nit being like the first time where I was\nlike happy and giggly and you know like\nin a while and I guess maybe that's why\nI've like really taken to it so much\nbecause like you said it was a coping\nmechanism during that time yeah so I\nthought\nyes right oh go ahead so so Casey that\nmakes a lot of sense to me and that's\nwhat I tend to hear right and so the\nsolution there is not to just stop the\nmarijuana and let the awfulness of life\ncome rushing back the solution there is\nto learn how to be happy and giggly\nwithout it because then you won't need\nit anymore\nyeah and I think that there is a real\nproblem where people start to become\nthat becomes their source of happy\ngiggly and then it's like that doesn't\nsound healthy to me at all like I think\nwhat I really advocate for is for people\nto like you know process your emotions\ndeal with your anger blame your parents\nwhat have you and then get past that\nstuff and then like be able to enjoy\nlife for what life has to offer because\nlife is really amazing it's really awful\nand it's really amazing and that those\ntwo don't have to be mutually exclusive\nand I would love it I think the real\nsolution that I want for you is to live\na life where you don't need marijuana to\nbe happy and giggly yeah I guess the\nidea of getting like I don't know the\nidea is like not doing marijuana\ncompletely I just I'm gonna be honest\nthey don't like like a you don't like it\nI enjoy smoking you know like is it bad\nto think like oh I never want to not\nlike I never bro I don't know course not\nit's completely good it's an ordinary\nbox it's an understandable fire how like\nhow do you know like I guess it's just\nin my everything in moderation type\nthing and I guess I know that I'm not\nmoderating it very well right now how do\nI that sounds like a proper reading it\nwell okay how do you know that you're\nnot moderating it well\ncuz I smoke too much but how do you know\nthat you're asking me how do I know when\nit's an okay man I'm actually I actually\ndon't I'm actually prescribed Casey no\nthere's no no no none of that [ __ ]\nmatters let me your answers in your\nquestion you said how do I know when\nit's okay and then my question to you is\nmy answer is the same way that you know\nit's not okay cuz you know it's not okay\nwe've heard you say it's not okay like a\nthousand times so whatever that sense of\nyou tells you hey this is okay that's\nwhen you'll know it's okay yeah you know\nand how much you've been prescribed has\nnothing to do with whether it's an okay\namount or not if you want to talk about\na [ __ ] cop out I don't think you\ncopped out until this moment this is a\ncop out\nyeah and I don't think you have to give\nit up today I'm not asking you to give\nit up today I'm saying that I think in\nmy experience I think it's worth and\neven that I didn't say give it up\nforever I'd say take a break from it for\na couple months and what I said is see\nhow you feel now if you have trouble\ndoing that then that also is concerning\nright like if I want to say like hey I\nwant to take a break for a meet for a\ncouple of months like I think it's\nimportant to be able to try things in\nyour life to see if they're gonna help\nyou feel better and if your life is\nbetter not asking you to make a\ncommitment but hey I mean you're asking\nme do I think you have a problem and the\nanswer is damn right I think you have a\nproblem and what do I base that on it's\nbecause you think you have a problem and\nyou know what way more about you than I\ndo like I I mean I just met you like an\nhour ago\nwhat the [ __ ] do I know I guess I guess\nI can acknowledge I have like I said\nlike I acknowledge that I've been\nsmoking way too much and I can\nacknowledge that I have a problem I just\nI guess I'm just like I don't really\ncare to do anything about it and I I\ndon't know like I I guess I'm just like\nah\nso that's how that's fine Casey I don't\nthink you should do anything about it\nright now yeah like like so so here's\nwhat I want you to just notice for a\nsecond okay that you have a compass and\nthis compass is telling you hey this is\na problem but I can't deal with this\n[ __ ] right now that's what I'm hearing\nyour compass tell you is that accurate\nyeah okay I can get behind that a\nhundred percent so I can say sure this\nis a problem and you have bigger fish to\nfry because by the way you have bigger\nfish to fry you've lived a life in an\nabusive household with an [ __ ]\nstepfather and a mother who suffered for\nsubstance use and you've learned how to\ninvalidate yourself that's what we've\nbeen talking about and that's what I\nthink you should focus on\nI think the marijuana is gonna be a\npiece of that down the road\nbut I think it is completely idiotic to\nask you to like cut back or I mean I\nguess you could we can ask you to try to\ncut back and see how that goes but I\ndon't think it's reasonable for you to\nstop because like I said earlier the\nreal solution to substance use is to not\nneed the ship to begin with and that's\nwhere the real healing happens I don't\nthink that forcing yourself to stop\nsmoking pot and then having a life\nthat's miserable every day is like\nthat's not the goal that doesn't sound\ngood to me the way that I get people off\nof substances is by helping them build a\nlife where they don't need them and then\nif you want to use it go for it but you\nshouldn't be dependent on it that I just\npersonally as a value system I don't\nlike being dependent on something I\ndon't like being in control of my life\nand I don't like I want to help people\nbe in [ __ ] control of your life make\na choice don't make it a dependency\ndon't make it a necessity make it a\nchoice and that's what I would advocate\nfor you and then once you are in a place\nwhere you can make a choice then you\nmake the choice and it's your choice to\nmake and I'm a judge you for it other\npeople may judge you for it but like let\nit be your free choice without a\npsychological dependence without a\nneurological dependent\nbe free to choose what you want to do\nwith your life whether that be marijuana\nmarriage having kids living alone\ntraveling whatever live the life that\nyou want to live and give yourself the\nbenefit of choice yeah oh this this\nreally has been really helpful like I\nsaid like I feel like this is you know\nkind of like a starting off point for me\nand I don't know like I'm scared to get\ninto therapy but I guess I'm ready for\nit\nyou should be scared but I don't know\nlike I guess I'm kind of like what does\ntherapy even like look like for someone\nlike me like in the position that I'm in\nlike if I did like go that route like\nwhat does that route like entail um like\nhow often am I gonna have to go like how\nare you how often you get a chance to go\nyou're not happy you don't have to go at\nall right so that even gives us a clue\nas to what's in your head you're\nthinking about a commitment you're not\nlaying a break you're building a house\nwhat I'm asking you to do kc is lay one\nbrick go to one session lay a capo give\nit like I'd give it like a month or two\nand then what do you do I'm not even\nsure I have no [ __ ] idea yeah\nhonestly I don't because when I do\ntherapy with someone like I don't have a\npreconceived notion of like the whole\npoint is that it takes time to figure\nout what someone needs it's gonna take\ntime for you to figure out what you need\nbut my sense is that it's gonna be a\nplace so here's what I think would be\nhelpful about it here's the only\ntreatment benefit that I can really see\nright now it's gonna be the one place in\nyour life where you are at the top of\nthe list for one hour guaranteed no one\nelse is at the top of the list except\nfor you for one hour of your life every\nweek which is not that much and I think\nyou can open you can buy yourself one\nhour week because the therapist is gonna\ndo their job which is putting you at the\ntop of the list and you're asking\nyourself you're asking me how do I put\nmyself on the list well you go to\ntherapy so they you see how someone else\ndoes it for you and then you learn how\nto do it yourself\nit's just like learning anything else\nlike how do my kids learn how to butter\nbread it's like I'm like okay this is\nhow you butter bread so for one hour a\nweek you're gonna go to a place where\nyou're gonna come first and then you're\ngonna see how they do it and cuz you're\n[ __ ] smart you're gonna learn how to\ndo it just by watching because that's\nhow we learn yeah\nwhat are you what are you thinking um I\ndon't know like I guess I I feel really\npositive right now\nI just I over all feel really positive\nlike I feel like this has been really\nhelpful to me I feel like in some ways\nyou kind of like\nI guess like gave me confirmation of\nsomething that I already knew but I just\nneeded to hear from somebody else um but\nyeah I don't know I'm excited I guess\ncool I'm happy to hear that do you have\nany of the darker feelings concern fear\n[Music]\num yeah I guess I have concern and fear\nbut like I've I feel like it'll be okay\nso I'm not super worried about those\ngreat that sounds very very healthy to\nme yeah I would be concerned if you're\nall sunshine and rainbows yeah because I\nthink that you should be afraid you\nshould be concerned you should be\nworried that this may not work out that\nyou may not be able to do it that it may\nnot be helpful that you may be\nunsolvable and that your problems are so\nbad that nothing will ever help most of\ngood feelings to have yeah and just let\nthem have their space and you don't have\nto be controlled by them\nyou\nyeah\nokay so any last thoughts questions um\nnot really that I can think of now like\nI feel like I have a lot to think about\nyou know um I'm ready to just kind of\ntake it all in you know yeah so the last\nthing that I'll say is that sometimes I\nteach people how to meditate on stream I\nthink this is another yeah I I guess\nthat's like I said I started meditating\nor trying to meditate recently and I\nhave to say like at first it just feels\nreally dumb like I feel really dumb\ndoing it or trying to do it you know\nuh-huh and and when you say at first so\nare you over that hump are you still in\nthat I filled I'm doing it huh\num I may be in between like sometimes I\nfeel less dumb than other times is it\nnormal to feel that way\nsolely by the way that never really goes\naway I still sometimes feel dumb when I\nmeditate it's just part of it that's\nactually part of the process is feeling\ndumb and it that's actually why I think\nmeditation is so good because you know\nwhen you get used to feeling dumb your\nlife gets a lot easier when you let\nyourself feel incompetent and you're\nokay with feeling into competent and you\ndon't let the incompetence restrict what\nyou do and you can go and you can sit\nwith yourself being dumb and you can let\nyourself being dumb world becomes a\ncompletely different place yeah yeah do\nyou can you tell me a little bit about\nhow you meditate or do you want to learn\na different technique today um are you\nwhite I guess I've been like there's a\nfew different things that I've tried to\ndo right because there's no right way to\ndo it I guess like I've been listening\nto a few different podcasts and stuff\nabout it and one of the ideas that I\nliked was just trying to put yourself\nlike in a mindset or space where there\nis limitless doubt or you know there is\nno doubt and I really liked that thought\njust like trying to you know think about\nhow my life would be like if I didn't\ndoubt myself hmm um this one's really\ndumb but one of the other things that\nI'll do is I'll just try to think of a\nword like\n[Music]\num\n[Music]\nI don't know like I'll just think of a\nword like um emotion and all just like\nrepeatedly say it in my head and tell it\nfeels like it doesn't have a meaning\nanymore does that sound stupid no that's\nactually called Java but is a Sun\nthere's a Sanskrit word for them there's\na sense of it practice a meditative\npractice that you have discovered all by\nyour lonesome okay so it's the very\nopposite of stupid it's actually\nbrilliant weird huh yeah how do you feel\nwhen I say that I don't know I was just\nlaughing it's kind of in a I don't know\nif it's inappropriate to say but I had\nthat I I mic reduced a little bit of\nmushrooms like a couple of weeks ago and\nthat's whenever I had that kind of\nmoment sure that uh that's also\ncompletely makes sense because\nmeditative practices are developed yeah\nby people who were in a different state\nof consciousness and mushrooms MDMA\npsilocybin or ways that people can sort\nof like you know take the fast lane to\nsome of those spaces the problem is you\ndon't really know what you're getting\nwhen you do that yeah yeah so do you\nwant to learn something today or you\nfeel cuz I I think especially after like\nsessions like this I I don't think or\nstreams like this that I don't think\nthat you necessarily need to meditate\nsometimes it's just good to sit alone\nwith your thoughts but if you want to\nlearn something I can teach you\nsomething both into learning to\nsomething okay so then sit up straight\nokay okay so good so you're looking at\nme is this yeah okay good so when you\nlook at so we're gonna have a little\nconversation I'm gonna ask you a couple\nof questions then I'm gonna ask you to\nclose your eyes and do some other stuff\nokay so like let's start with this so\nKasey something's wrong with you right\nyeah yeah right so like let's just think\nabout like what are some of the things\nthat are wrong with you we're not trying\nto like talk about I'm just saying let's\njust acknowledge or notice like what are\nsome of the things that are wrong with\nyou um trauma sure good um I guess maybe\nsense of self value great\nanxiety sure\num I don't know okay great that's good\nfor yourself right yeah yeah yeah no no\nthat's perfect okay so now once you sit\nup straight back straight is your back\nstraight yeah okay good\nsit up straight close your eyes I want\nyou to actually take your take your\nhands look look at me do this do one\npalm inside right palm inside the left\npalm like laying on top yep perfect put\nyour thumbs together great and then put\nthis in your lap yeah face up looks like\nyou turned them down so they're placed\nit no other way okay there you go\nokay all right so this is pirate of a\nmudra which is a hand thing don't worry\nabout it close your eyes\nand now I want you to find so just let's\nstart with a breath\nokay\nI want you to notice the cool air going\nin knows not mouth okay it's okay to\nsmile okay to lap okay to feel silly no\nbig deal\nshilling giggly yet yeah okay cool\nso just focus on your breath feel it\ncoming into your chest and out y'all can\ndo this at home too\nso think about some things that are\nwrong with you\nokay good\nhead straight your spine should be\nstraight yeah no straight floor sit and\nfeel the discomfort no hunching okay\nreturn to your breath\nif your breath is hard to hold on to\nfocus on the sensations in your hands\nfeel the weight of one hand on the other\nfeel the sensation of this skin-on-skin\nyour thumb tips together and feel your\nthumbs touching each other\nyou\nand now in this place Casey find your\ntrauma where is it\nyou\nand now we're gonna move on so we're not\ngonna get lost in it now look for your\ninvalidation of self can you find that\nthat Tommy\nyou\num I don't know like I just like I guess\nI just see it and like a lot of\ndifferent aspects of my life like ah\nokay invalidate you know like my\nmourning process I guess like I\ninvalidate okay okay okay okay so pause\nfor a second head up straight spine\nstraight good now\neyes closed good okay so those are\nthoughts\nthose are recollections of the\ninvalidation in this moment tell me\nwhere the invalidation exists within you\nI guess I don't know my mind does it\nexist because your mind thinks about the\npast I'm asking you in the now where is\nthe invalidation\nbrat through the nose head up straight\ngood deep breath in and out and look for\nit in this moment try to find it try to\npick it up you can focus on your hands\nfocus on your breath find the\ninvalidation\nfeel the person that you are right now\nfeel your weight in the chair feel the\ntears on your cheeks\ntension in your body breathe in expand\nand relax\nokay\nnow let your shoulders go ahead and take\na deep breath but don't move your\nshoulders\nand then they fly a profess okay good so\nnow I'm gonna ask you where is the\ninvalidation\num\nI don't know I guess\nI don't know I guess I don't understand\nlike can you rephrase no I'm not gonna\nrephrase so I think the problem is that\nI'm asking a question to which I think\nyou have the answer but I don't think\nyou think you have the answer so I think\nthe reason that you can't find it is\nbecause it's not really there because\nyou can find the invalidation when you\nthink about the past and when you think\nabout the ways that you treat yourself\nbut when you stop in you're still in\nyou're in this moment it actually\ndoesn't exist it's a trick question\nokay and the fact that you can't come up\nwith an answer I am so glad you didn't\ncome up with some [ __ ] answer\nbecause it's it's hard when you're on\nstream to like not come up with the\nright answer but if you stop and look in\nyourself like could you find it now so\njust think about that for a second that\nwhenever you invalidate yourself you\nhave within you the capacity to enter a\nstate of being where that invalidation\nno longer exists\nyou do it every morning in your routine\nfine but if you can do what you just did\nif you can put yourself in that same\nstate in your morning routine it won't\nbe able to exist there either\ninvalidation comes from the mind yeah\nand it's the looking that you do that's\nnot actually mental activity that's\nconsciousness it's attention its\nattention without thought\nand if you can go there I don't know if\nthis is making sense or not but I think\nright because if you ask me can i\nrephrase that actually means you're\ndoing it right because you're looking\nfor an answer and you're not able to\nfind one and that's actually the answer\nthere's no such thing as invalidation so\nnow my last question for you is I don't\nknow if you remember this but when you\nthink about the person that you were\nlet's say 90 seconds ago what was wrong\nwith you\nlike whenever I was thinking about when\nyou were breathing and feeling the tears\ngo down your face yeah what was wrong\nwith you\num I guess I was just thinking a lot\nabout whenever Ricky passed away okay\ntens I'm gonna jump in I'm gonna\ninterrupt you okay so that too once\nagain is thinking that's not actually\nyou those are thoughts\nstay with me okay this is gonna be her\nNana so I want you to close your eyes\nand focus fully on the sensation there's\na tear going down your right cheek in\nthis moment if we're lucky the fly's\ngonna come back and he's gonna land on\nyour face yeah if he does I don't want\nyou to move him there he is right on\ntime he's coming coming for you okay\nwe'll see if he helps out he's really\nhere to help and I want you to just\nfocus on the sensation of wetness on\nyour face\nwhat's wrong with you right now and I'm\nnot talking about thoughts I'm not\ntalking I'm talking about in this moment\nif this is all you knew of your entire\nlife what would you know about this\nperson if you were this thing all for\nevery day for the rest of your life what\nwould be wrong with you I'm not talking\nabout the past I'm not talking about the\nfuture I'm not talking about your\nworries I'm not talking about you\nfailing to support your family I'm\ntalking about this thing that you are\nright now what is this who are you and\nwhat's wrong with it\nnot focusing on feelings at all okay\nwhat are you focusing on I don't know\nlike I guess\ncan I focus on feelings because I just\nlike feel like I don't know like I guess\nI just feel kind of heartbroken okay\nanyway good okay so Casey this is what\nyou've got to do good job there no see\nyou screwed it up again let's see if he\ncomes back it's coming for you okay all\nright\nso yeah that's actually a really\ninteresting meditation technique so you\nknow a lot of people don't know this but\nyou know like sometimes Indian people\nhave a doc on their forehead you know\nI've seen that before you know why did I\ndo that is it for the fly\nactually honestly sort of yeah you're\nyou're damn right it's what I'm gonna\nsay so interestingly enough it's to\nbring your attention of your mind to a\nphysical sensation on your forehead it's\nto focus the attention of your mind it's\nbasically putting an artificial fly on\none spot in your forehead yeah I [ __ ]\nyou not meditation is so hard it's very\nhard it's so hard so the only thing\nthat's hard about it is if you beat\nyourself up for not doing it right\nbecause what you did was great so what\nI'm hearing from you is that when you\nmeditate and this happens with people\nwith trauma stuff is humming up and then\nwhat happens the reason you call\nmeditation apart is because you think\nyou should do something instead of let\nthat stuff come up but just let it come\nup feel heartbroken for a little while\nand then let yourself not feel that way\nreturn to your breath return to tears\nyou know grab a fly go stand in the Sun\nI don't know where you live I don't know\nhow hot it is feel the Sun on your face\nput your feet in water\ndrink something cold take something cold\nand put it around the back of your neck\ntake something warm and put it around\nthe back of your neck when you meditate\nCasey it's gonna take you a long time to\nmeditate right but that's not wrong you\nhave to you're just need to let this\n[ __ ] out and then eventually you'll come\nto a place and I think you got there a\nlittle bit today but I what I'm getting\nfrom you is that like anytime you stop\nthe defense mechanisms of your mind the\nheartbreak arises and what I want you\nwhat I want you to envision is like what\nhappens when a bubble reaches the\nsurface\nI don't know pops absolutely so right\nnow you have all of these bubbles within\nyou and you just need to let them come\nto the surface and they'll pop and\ndisappear and then you'll be left with\nstill water because right now your water\nis not still its roiling with lots and\nlots of bubbles and movement and\nagitation it's gonna come up a little\nbit at a time a little bit of time at a\nlittle bit at a time and as much as you\ncan let your son let it come up but also\nfor the love of God do not beat the [ __ ]\nout of yourself for not being able to\nmeditate properly because you're you\ncan't meditate properly and that's the\nway it's supposed to be for you right\nnow okay\nyou'll meditate properly like you can't\nforce what happens if I have a bubble\nunderwater that's slowly coming up and I\nstick my hand in and try to get rid of\nit what happens to it it goes back down\nyeah right like if I'm gonna create more\nbubbles if I stick my hand in like how\ndo I get water to be still if I have\nwaves in my bathtub and I go and I\nselect try to force the waves down with\nmy hands what's gonna happen it's just\ngonna cause more waves absolutely so\nwhen you say you can't meditate right\nthe solution is not to try harder it's\nto try less okay just let yourself sit\nlet that [ __ ] come up and it's not\nendless this is the loan and this is the\ndebt you have an emotional debt that\nyou've been racking up for years which\nwas absolutely necessary and it's got to\ncome up a little bit at a time sorry I\nknow you were feeling good and then we\nstarted meditating now we're back to\nsquare one yeah it's just God like\nit's at the right answer that's the\nright answer\nthat's awareness that's why I'm\noptimistic because sure it hurts but not\nforever when you say God there's a lot\nthat's right because so much during\ntoday I don't know how to say this Casey\nbut for so much of today you have said\nthe exact opposite yeah you have not\nacknowledged how much there is\nyou have invalidated and you say how do\nI learn how to validate I don't know how\nthe [ __ ] you did that but you just did\nit god there's a lot that's absolutely\nright I guess I'm just like oh I'm like\nafraid I'm like is it too much\nabsolutely it's just like when I'm ready\nto talk about it it's just like\nwaterworks like I just can't help it is\nit too much for a single conversation\nabsolutely but you've been taking loans\nfor how old are you now 28\nyou've been taking loans for at least 25\nyears and you haven't been making\npayments and when that's the way that\nyou live your life it can feel like the\ndebt is insurmountable but the second\nyou start making payments it turns\ncompletely around and I think if you\ngive yourself honestly it's gonna take a\ncouple of years for you to be like\ncompletely like kind of in a good place\nlike I'd say like give yourself two\nyears yeah but I think by the time you\nturn 30 you could be you could feel like\na completely different person I tell you\nCasey I've worked with people who have\nhad trauma on the order of magnitude\nthat you have and whether you call that\na lot or whether you call that a little\nlive what I mean is that I work with\npeople who have grown up in substance\nuse abusive households and it is amazing\nif you just take care of yourself a\nlittle bit because so far you haven't\ntaken care of yourself at all\nand if you if you give yourself the\nchance you'll be amazed at what you're\ncapable of yeah sorry to leave you in\nshambles I feel like it's just gonna be\nkind of a reality for me for a while\nright you're damn right of this but\nthat's the important statement\nbeautifully said it's going to be the\nreality for me for a while yeah cuz it\nis but I can I can tell you from the\nbottom of my heart not forever not\nforever enough for today I think yeah\nsorry I knew I was gonna get really\nemotional so I consider the problem I\nthink it's just enough time I don't\nblame you for saying it I'm just saying\nlike we got a parcel it out right we're\nnot gonna wipe out your debt in one day\nright go do something fun what are you\ngonna do today\nI'm probably gonna go outside do some\nyard work with my dogs\nperfect just try to relax a little that\nis absolute mastery big but I don't\nthink you know I think that that's a\ngood idea\ndo you want to know what I do after a\nstream like this I go pull weeds really\nI Drive around for like 32 yard work so\nyeah I seriously what I do is I Drive\naround for 30 minutes and then I in the\nevening around like 6 or 7 p.m. I go\noutside with my kids and like I said I\nliterally like they run around and I\npull weeds it is the best thing you\ncould possibly do be with your dogs yard\nwork sounds I'm telling you this\nstarting a garden is good cuz I've been\nworking on starting a garden\noh man I love Gardens yeah you know the\nZen people love Gardens so much they\nmake Gardens without even any plants\nyeah it's [ __ ] weird they make\nGardens out of sand and [ __ ] like that\nbut it's it's great gardening zopi\nneeds to be nerfed yeah ok I really\nappreciate coming on and thank you for\nso much for your time\nyou're very welcome\nyou ready for the next triggering\nstatement because I know you haven't had\nenough you're worth it Casey thank you\nyou're worthless I really appreciate it\nit really has been really helpful and\nI'm I guess looking forward to some of\nyour resources to baby start you're\ngetting insistent therapy\nsure so let me um you know why don't you\ntake today but shoot me a DM on Twitter\nI mean on discord or something and we\ncan have I can walk you through stuff\nspecifically and then in general I we\nneed to do that for everyone else too\nwe'll do that maybe we'll do a DLC about\nthank you miss but in the meantime you\nknow if you tell me what state you're in\nand and we can talk about insurance and\nI can explain to you how all that [ __ ]\nworks and we can try to get you\nconnected okay okay all

games were like\nyou know she it reminds me that this\nlike ff7 remake thing where you like\ndon't love a lot right she's like one of\nthese people that's like never leveled\nup she's like I'm gonna
