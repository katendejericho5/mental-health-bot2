    "transcript": "and then please tell me kind of what\nyour name is or how you'd like to be\naddressed and we'll do kind of a\nsoundcheck at the same time\nI'll go first I'm Debbie\nNatha thanks for having me Navi yes\nawesome\nwelcome happy thanks for being thank you\nI'm glad\nRasim but I can't yes and I can't see\nyou so so it's Edie\nyeah maybe I'll just rejoin yeah try\nrejoining cuz I I think I see me I don't\nknow what to do if you can't see me\nokay um I'm Sinestro by the hi okay also\nNabi Laz in semestre\nyeah hi Sinestro you look super nervous\nsorry\nno that's fine I apologize okay\nso who's next hi I'm Megan Oh Maggie\nnice to meet you Megan\ncool oh wait hi um Cinna it's nice to\nsee you nice to see you too Cinna\nwelcome and I go by satire but you can\ncall me cell as well for short Celaya\nmm-hmm did I say that right yeah you\nsaid that right okay okay and then last\ncan you see us now okay so it was it was\nNavi is that right yes so Navi lies\nSinestro Megan Sinha and celaya I got\nthose right okay cool so welcome\neveryone and what are we talking about\ntoday you tell us I guess so my\nunderstanding is that you guys were\nright so I use guys as a gender of\nplural I mean a gender-neutral term\nwhich is the way that I was raised and\nI'm trying to rewire my neurons so I\napologize I don't mean to offend anyone\nso I thought we were gonna just share\nall right I was hoping we could hear a\nlittle bit about what y'all's\nexperiences are like being women and\nplaying video games and hopefully\neducate us a little bit and like learn a\nlittle bit about what y'all's\nexperiences are and so if somebody wants\nto start that's cool otherwise I can\nkick things off with a question\na question would be great I think yeah\nso what's it like to be a woman and play\nvideo games\nchallenging what's challenging about\ngetting attention just for being a woman\nplaying games is kind of more than we\nasked for sometimes when we just want to\nplay games okay and is that something\nthat resonates with other people yeah I\nwould say like it's kind of mixed\nbecause like sometimes they'll get\npeople who like treat you normally and\nit's like great and then like sometimes\nyou get people who like treat you like\nabsolute [ __ ] and then like sometimes\nyou get people who are just like super\nweird to you so what what does that mean\nsuper weird um like they like have\ncertain expectations for you or like\nthey have like this like narrative in\ntheir mind that they just play out\nwhenever they interact with a woman\nonline like it's like yeah oh there's a\nwoman let's say like go back to the\nkitchen or something like it's like\nexecute like like a like a line of code\nyeah broadly said for NPCs sometimes oh\nthat's a fascinating way to put it what\ndo you mean by that sly well kind of\nlike you forgot the name you go by you\ncan call me Megan erm use either a yeah\nokay\nwell it's gonna say Muse um sad is like\nthey just play a certain thing that they\nthat they have joke the same jokes come\nup or interaction that they think is\nappropriate or is what we want to hear\nwhen they see a woman in playing the\ngames yes I go ahead\nwell it can be from like this stupid\njokes to whatever questions or following\nyou with within the game or just all\nkinds of things just for their\nentertainment instead of treating you as\na team player or yeah you're just pretty\nmuch an NPC and and if you don't respond\nthe way that they want you to respond\nthen they become even more toxic okay so\nI heard a couple of terms there one was\ntoxic and you said if they don't if you\ndon't respond the way they want you to\nrespond what is it how do they want you\nto respond what do they look at that's\nguesting good to just like get along\nwith them and just hope that like oh my\ngosh like the like she's she's finally\nresponding to me like oh my gosh like\nfinally I can you know get what I want\nwhich is you know because I know it's\njust like I guess some people have like\nthis like mindset in their head that\nlike if I don't play a nice guy cuz a\nnice guy finishes last if I be like an\n[ __ ]\ndefinitely she'll get my attention you\nknow so okay I'm growing more and more\nconfused but let me just start with this\nokay\nso the first thing is so I asked so I\nwas like you know they want you to say\nthe right thing otherwise things\nescalate right that's what I kind of\nheard her say does that make sense to\nyou all which all kind of agree with\nthat yeah yeah and then my next question\nis like okay what's the right thing and\nshe's like I don't know that sounds like\na busted game that you can yeah like\nthere's like only one perfect answer and\nlike if you don't get it then you're\njust like in a world of [ __ ] now so\nwhat's the part I'm curious what is the\nperfect answer is there isn't there\nisn't actually a perfect answer\nno so so yeah maybe just the laugh or\njust\ngive him attention but you never really\nknow how the winning move is not to play\nor not to speak so that they don't know\nyou're a woman how does it feel to not\nplay or not speak\nsucks\nsir madam\nwell your dare to have fun and play the\ngame that you want to play in in the way\nyou want to play and then to be met with\na thought of like well if I speak up now\nthere's a 50-50 if not higher percentage\nthat I can't play the game that I want\nto play because and the game that you\nwant to play is just the game that\neveryone else gets to play yeah I think\ntoo it's like really frustrating like\nwhen you get treated unfairly and you\nknow you're being treated unfairly like\nto just sit there and like have to deal\nwith it too because like a lot of times\ntoo like you'll get stuck in a game and\nit's like you can't leave it right if\nit's competitive or whatever and then\nyou have to like deal with these people\nfor like at least 20 minutes like yeah\noh and then it's like you're basically\nrolling the dice every time you cue into\na game so it's like an overwatch it's\nlike I have a 1 in 5 chance of getting\nlike X number of [ __ ] like cuz it\nkind of depends like sometimes you'll\nget one sometimes I've got none and then\nthe really fun times you get five of\nthem so I apologize for interrupting you\nguys are just saying once again guys\nsorry y'all are just saying things that\nare really like fascinating to me in\nterms of some of the assumptions I can\nhear assumptions baked into everything\nthat y'all are saying right and and so\nmy period like my next question is like\nwhat is an [ __ ] look like like what\ndoes that mean like how do you know when\nsomeone is an [ __ ] to you are in a\ngame like what do they say or what do\nthey do how can I get on the stream just\nnothing that's gonna get us banned and\nthe reason that I want to ask the\nquestion is because I sometimes wonder\nif there are people out there who don't\nthink that they're an [ __ ]\nand so I'm curious about so like when\nyou when y'all say that sometimes I get\nfive [ __ ] everyone and twitch chat\nis like hahaha\nthose guys suck but it's not me right\nthat's naturally what happens when we\nleave things ambiguous and what I'm\nreally curious about is like maybe I'm\nan [ __ ] like in a video game\nI don't know so I'd really like to hear\nfrom y'all about what they will actually\nlike say or do and so we can like really\nknow what is an [ __ ] what's not an\nAxl what's acceptable what's not\nacceptable I think a big question\nnowadays is like what's okay and what's\nnot okay right where do we draw the line\nand so I'd love to hear from you all so\ngo for it Nabby\nI think just avoid you know TOS banning\nthings like acts I don't know\nI'll just blankety-blank okay hey you\nblankety-blank you sound real cute I'd\nlove to have my blank down your blank\nsorry sorry I think one of the things\nthat also I guess like why don't you\ngive me like a like a kiss why don't you\ngive me like a tensioner stuff like that\nor like like if I'm gonna do this for\nyou I'm gonna help you or be actually a\nteam player if you know you give me your\nphone number or if you give me a kiss\nand everything can you kiss someone over\nwatch you want you to make like I didn't\nknow like the noise or like or like\nthey'll be like say whoever I like\nwhatever your best oh wow and what I\nmean we're all smiling but what's that\nwhat are we actually talking about why\nare we smiling right now what's up with\nthat it's amusing because it it sounds\nreally funny in hindsight but it's like\nit's just gross and it's hard like it's\nhard to know how to react to that like\nyeah yeah let me just I know you're\ndisgusted thinking about it in hindsight\nit's all really like stupid it's really\nridiculous do you think that that has\nsomething to do with like the fact that\nwe're all smiling and laughing right now\ndo you think that that has any I'm\ntrying to figure out does that have some\nbearing on why it continues\nnormy it's like a coping mechanism okay\nto laugh it off yeah and for right now\nlike when it's happening in the moment\nmost of us are not laughing yes how do\nyou feel when it happens in the moment\ndisappointed\nusually because it's always the same\nstuff it's\nand and you can only you only have like\na certain ways you can react to it\neither ignore it either play along and\nyou know try to convert the conversation\nor poke back at them with with stupid\nstuff you know the the 1i you normally\nis use is can you not come up with\nsomething original for once like make a\nfun joke and yeah sometimes that turns\nit completely around and then like okay\nand and because I mean you know the joke\nof get into the kitchen and make me a\nsandwich it's so overplayed and it\ndoesn't technically make you an [ __ ]\nit's just stupid to hear every single\ntime it's tiring um it doesn't make you\nan [ __ ] I mean it does but online\ntoxicities is just a it's just a thing\nthat we somehow all won except that to\nbe a norm but I don't know so what I'm\nhearing from Celaya and let me know if\nyou guys you know are the same thing is\nthat basically y'all don't even consider\nthat an app that being an [ __ ]\nanymore because the spectrum of [ __ ]\narea is so big that that's actually like\nthat doesn't even count anymore because\nthere's also stuff happening over here\nthere's worse for sure yeah I think to\nlike at a certain point it just becomes\neasier to let things go then to like\naddress it all the time right because\nlike I I've done where I like try and\nlike be like I don't like the statement\nor like I don't like this and then you\njust become the person who's always\nsaying like no no no no no and it's like\nno one like wants to be around that\nperson who's just like the party pooper\nlike it's like hmm yeah you can't take a\njoke that's what it ends up is\nI think also one of the things that's\nalso super exhausting sometimes we want\nto respond but it's just like also there\nis like external factors like sometimes\nI I deal with harassment in real life as\nwell and also facing it online it's just\nlike alright where do I go if I face\nthis online and I face it's like IRL\nlike where where do I exactly feel safe\nyou know okay that sucks\nlike I was just thinking that you know\npart of what I love about games is that\nlike it's the place that I go when I\ndon't want to be in IRL right that's\nthat's what it is for me it's like I'm\ntired of dealing with copic let me play\nsome video games and what I'm hearing\nfrom y'all is that the place that I get\nto go y'all don't even get to go and\nenjoy if it's single-player then yeah\nI'm definitely tired of being made to\nfeel like I don't like belong in these\nspaces when like I clearly do it's like\nthe the price of a mission is like the\ncost of the game and like that should be\nit damn powerful words and what is the\nprice of admission for you Megan\nuh it's mainly taking a roll of the dice\nlike um for example like um I have games\nthat I bought but I don't play because\nmy friends have told me that I shouldn't\nbecause people will be so rude to me\nthere so um the specific one I'm\nthinking of is Rainbow six siege where\nit's like ice like I've seen game play\nand it looks so fun and I just want to\nplay it but I just don't want to deal\nwith it and I actually played my first\ngame like a one-game of it and they\ndidn't even know as a girl and like that\nlike wasn't a factor in this but I got\nto sit and listen to this guy tell this\nstory about coming into a pair of Gucci\nsocks in my first game and I was like I\ndon't really want to take the chance and\nalso like I hear stories like where it's\nlike a common thing in that game for\nguys to ask girl for their pee and it's\nlike do I really want to put up with\nthat just to play this game and I'm like\nI don't think so\nnow I find myself being morbidly and\nhorrific ly curious when you said guys\nto ask a girl for the bitter P is that a\nslang term like shortage of penis or is\nthat urine like their urine urine\nwhat the actual [ __ ] welcome but yeah\nwelcome what is it\nokay so let me explain something to\ny'all so I'm a psychiatrist sometimes\npeople come into my office and they tell\nme about the sexually depraved [ __ ] that\nthey're into and never have I heard\nanything like just bizarre like why\nwould you want a woman's urine off of\nthe internet like what are you gonna do\nwith that there was some meme about it\nmaking you a better gamer so then they\nwould swap women from what study what\nmemes have some grounding in reality\nright they're like something that\nhappens in the real world and they gets\nlike taken out of proportion I think it\nhad to do with the Bell Delphine selling\nher bathwater I think it came from that\nor something like that and then people\njust basically did it what what is that\nit's definitely that ever since of Bell\nDelphine came on the internet and she\nstarted selling you know bathwater that\nshe used you know do you shower herself\nso many guys were something for it I\nguess there she is gamer girl bathwater\nokay so I don't know if this is beyond\nthe scope of the conversation but can\ny'all please enlighten me as to what the\nwords that are coming out of y'all's\nmouth means so first of all who or what\nis a Belle Belle fiend that's a person\nright yeah she's an individual yeah is\nshe like a streamer or she's a streamer\nokay and so she started selling her\nbathwater meaning though the liquid that\nshe pours him that she takes a bath in\nyes I understand she's like a Mimi troll\nso like okay so like she was trolling\nand she started selling bath water and\npeople purchased it or was that a joke\nher viewers actually purchased it people\nmostly bought it but as a joke like a\nlot of youtubers bought it as a joke and\nthey're like I bought it and then I\nshowed it got it okay because then my\nnext question is like so\nguys no no no and some drink it they\ndrink it\nyou\nand I just think for a second take take\nyour time\nI tell you old story so I was around so\nI have a Boomer right and now we're\ngonna tell a doctor kay boomer story so\nlike I was around when the internet was\nborn and I know that's kind of a weird\nthing to say but like the internet\nwasn't always around like at the\nbeginning the internet was like a place\neven before the days of the internet we\nhad these things called bulletin board\nsystems BBS's that are really cool it's\nlike you log into the server and only\none person can be on the server at a\ntime and you like play games and stuff\nlike that there were like turn-based\ngames and and like you know sometimes\npeople would like chat and have\ndiscussions there'd be like forums where\nyou could post and stuff like that and\nit just blows my mind that this is what\nthe internet has turned into I don't\neven know what this is and also what's a\nsim\nI hear people use that term a lot\nI could take a stab at the definition I\nthink it's typically a guy viewer of a\nfemale streamer or youtuber who is the\nkind of person that would like donate to\nthem just to hear their name be read\nfrom the donation and that's like all\nthat they want to get from that\nrelationship like they're happy just to\nhave their name be read from from a\ndonation marker and they'll give money\nto that person to have them read it okay\nso now help me understand something and\nI recognize that you guys may not have\nanswers here but maybe y'all do so like\nwhen we think about a toxic [ __ ] that\nyou guys play games with and then\nthere's a simp are those like opposite\nends of a spectrum or the same spectrum\nlike that this is that the same person\nor like what is the relationship there\nand maybe there is huge\nusually it's seen as the opposite of it\nlike if you defend a woman against the\nbully then you're a simp okay okay I\nwonder if they're the same person\ninteresting anyway that's just doctor\ndoctor Kay's gonna have to think about\nthat for a little while with his\nFreudian hat yeah um from my\nunderstanding for really good sim the\nsimp is like a person who is just like\nyou know let's have guys who's willing\nto give 110 percent or like hundred and\nforty percent of their attention and\ntheir affection and just be super\nsubmissive to whatever needs of the\npurse like the girl that they're going\nafter it's like just so that they can be\nin a romantic or a sexual relationship\nwith them that's it have you guys\nencountered your own simps like if\npeople tried to do that to you i seal as\nnodding emphatically mm-hmm care to\nshare lassen it's sometimes it's like\nthe guy that is offensive towards you in\nthe game\nand then you have a good comeback or you\njust like stop him from like that\nbehavior or that you say something that\nhe knows that he can't [ __ ] with you\nlike he can't mess with your head\nso then he slides into your DMS and he's\nlike I'm sorry I'm not actually like\nthat and then like and then he's like\nhe's nice and like he's okay and then\nlike two days later he's being weird to\nuse again so you guys all have once\nagain hit that part where I was\nfollowing what you're saying and then\nyou use some words and it seems like\nyour colleagues understand exactly what\nyou're talking about but can you all\neducate the rest of us like what does\nthat mean then he starts being weird\nare we talking about blankety-blank sand\nblankety-blank sar we talking about\nbathing or drinking your urine we talked\nlike what are we talking about here\ngenerally appropriateness is like what's\nthat what's that what does that look\nlike I would say\nwhile the stuff that we've mentioned is\nfor one but also they want to get\nsomething out of you usually so and this\ncould spend from indeed like two days a\nweek a month five months a whole year\nthat you never really know and it just\ninteractions where they they do stuff\nfor you and they want something back and\nthen they suggest something\ninappropriate and that could be straight\nup asking for nudes that could be more\nsubtle stuff at first but yeah usually\nit involves something romantic or\nsexually hmm you know that's bizarre so\nlike because I remember you're the one\nwho said they treat you like an NPC\nright it sounds to me like they're\ngrinding reputation with you again like\na mutation rewards like crime you like\nfor eight months I'm gonna I'm gonna\nmessage to this chick every day and then\nonce I hit you know Grand Marshall in\nthe saliva faction I'm gonna get me a\nnude yeah and it's not even it just\nbeing inappropriate and rude but it's\nalso just a mistrust because you don't\nreally know going into certain\nfriendship relationships whether or not\nthere's actually friendship\nrelationships or not so there's always a\nbalance of do I really trust someone or\ndo I not or yeah you have to always be\non your guard it sounds like you can't\nlike just like playing the game you just\ncan't interact with another person\nwithout having to think about all this\nextra stuff\nyeah yeah um also one of the things is\nfrustrating is that when you actually do\nhave the guts to actually stand up for\nyourself and say like no no man I'm not\ninterested in that type of stuff no\nthank you\nand you you try to stand your ground\nwhat wound up happening is that nice guy\nroutine just kind of snaps and he's like\noh my god she's being such a female dog\nand afterwards you're just like you\ncan't win at all and because of that it\njust spreads sometimes to your own\nfriends sometimes he spreads to you like\nthe people closest to you and you don't\neven know that that's happening and in\nthe back you're just thinking like oh\nmaybe he respects like what's going on\nbetween us\nmaybe he says he understands that I'm\nsaying no and he's okay with it but then\nthere's some people who's just like\nbackstab see and just saves a lot of\nstuff behind your back you know that\nsounds like something pretty bad\nhappened to you\nthat didn't sound general at all that\nsounded really specific\ndo you want to share that or I mean you\ndon't have to it's just I'm curious\nI I guess it's just like when when I do\nstep up for my own self when I finally\nsnapped and I'm already pushed to the to\nthe edge already and I can't take it I\ncan't take it it's already hurting me\nemotionally and mentally and them and I\nalready got stuff to deal with in real\nlife and the person is just like\noverstepping like oh because you know we\ncan't say no to me I'm your friend\nyou're supposed to be there for me I'm\nsupposed you're supposed to be always\nthere for me I thought you're you're\nnever going to abandon me and then\nbecause of that it's just like it gets\nyou it eats you up it makes you feel\nhorrible and and afterwards you just\nkind of sit with that guilt you know and\nthis it's tough yeah it sounds like they\nneed you for certain things like it\nsounds very very dependent does that\nmake sense\nlike they're relying on you for a lotta\nI'm still not quite sure what I don't\nknow if it's like emotional support or\nwhat but like it sounds like they really\ndo lean on you very very heavily and you\ndon't feel like you can say no without\nbeing a guilty female dog\nyeah and and then when I actually try to\nstand up for myself\nI just start feeling okay I shouldn't\nhave done that I start feeling horrible\nfor opening up about how I really feel\nand I and because of that I caused like\na lot of drama a lot of stress and other\npeople are being affected and I and some\nparts of me it's like I should have shut\nup I should have never said anything\nlike now a lot of people are being\naffected by this you know so sooner you\nkeep on mentioning like people's talking\nbehind your back and it affects other\npeople in your friends circle and\nthere's drama with other people is that\nsomething that other people have\nexperienced does it kind of spill over\nso now I experience that yeah tell us\nabout that\num it's like sometimes if you go in a\ngroup of people and you say hi or at\nleast like I tend to talk to like in\nWorld of Warcraft like there's a lot of\npeople you could go talk to sometimes if\nyou piss off the wrong person\nthey're like warm people who joined the\nguild like oh they're an attention [ __ ]\nthey talk to everybody\nthey're gonna use you know what I mean\nand then you go in and you talk like it\ndidn't happen but like then everybody\nstarts like act different towards you\nbecause they've kind of tarnished or fut\nthat's at least the experience I have\nsorry\ncan you tell us a little bit more about\nlike what you did to earn the ire or the\nlabel of attention [ __ ] I like if you\ntalk as a girl like you're an attention\nwe're like you talking game like oh\nyou're only doing it for attention you\nknow what I mean wait it doesn't matter\nlike what you're saying\n[Music]\nyeah\nanyone else getting a feeling of like\nwhat the [ __ ] like that I relate to that\nI'm so confused\nmore than I was hoping that I would\nunderstand more things after this\nconversation and one thing that also\nkind of sucks is that like it's just it\nhappens in real life and also online\nwhat happens like even the thing that I\nmentioned about like this happening\nonline I I've experienced something like\nthis like in real life as well and it's\njust like I sometimes feel like I don't\nknow where exactly - you go - I don't\nknow where I feel safe honestly\nhow do people feel about that yeah I've\nbeen\nactually harassed in person it's more\nfrequent online there are more anonymous\ninteractions where people feel safer\nsexually harassing women so it's more\nfrequent for sure\nyou\nI'm trying to just process if anybody\nelse has things I know that we had I had\nasked lastly a couple of questions and\nshe was kind of saying that they slide\ninto your DMS and also that means that\nthey just message you is that what that\nsliding into your DMS means okay yeah\nthere's no like sliding is just like\nmessaging it's not like a special kind\nof messaging no I find like they'll try\nand find any excuse to like for example\nI was in this discord and this guy\nstarted messaging with me with questions\nlike about the discord but really like\nthere's sort of questions like you would\nask a moderator and it's like I'm not a\nmoderator of this discord so I don't and\nhe was like well I talked to you like\none time in that voice call I'm like\nokay like we talked one time and now\nyou're asking me like and - it's like\nI'm pretty sure you talk to like other\npeople in the discord multiple times\nbefore so it's like why are you asking\nme sure so is that so sliding sounds\nlike they use some pretense to engage\nyou in conversation with an ulterior\nmotive yeah and then they start grinding\nthe reputation and yeah - I'm usually\npretty clear about that - and like I've\nhad cases where it's like so for my case\nspecifically like I'm asexual and I'm\nlike very open where I'm like I have no\ninterest in like a relationship so I'll\ntell people that and then I've had guys\nactually come back and be like oh well\nlike I thought we were actually flirting\nand it's like how like I was as clear as\nday to you that like this was never\ngonna be a thing and they're like well\none day you sent a heart emoji in a\nmessage and it's like\nlike I don't I don't like know what to\ndo with that like I literally stopped\nusing emojis after that [ __ ] because I'm\nlike this is [ __ ] dumb and I'm like\nI'm not having this happen again where\nsomeone tries to use that as like a\n[ __ ] excuse about why they thought\nlike I might like them\nyou okay not really I'm just like I I've\ntried to like moderate my behavior and\nlike I definitely my personality to like\na [ __ ] up avoid this [ __ ] and I know\nit's [ __ ] up but like part of it works\nis the problem\nI agree with you so like here's the\nthing right so like the whole like a big\npremise of most of the stuff that we do\nhere is that people do [ __ ] up [ __ ]\nbecause it works like our last stream\nwas with Austin and he was like yeah I'm\nanxious and it's our astronomic no man\nit's rational it works that's why we do\nthings so I'm just I really just am\nthere's so much here that can I just\nthink for a second and then I'm gonna\nstart talking and then I don't know\nwhat's gonna happen after that\nokay yeah I'm sure I have more questions\nfor you I just can't okay\nokay so here's the first problem okay so\nusually people come on this stream and\nthen my general premise is that like you\ncan change the way that you understand\nyourself or interact with the world and\nthen that interaction can become a\nbetter place and you can feel like a\nbetter person does that make sense and\ngenerally people like when I work as a\nmedical professional people come into my\noffice and then I work with them right\nlike it's kind of like a duh but like I\nwork with the people that I'm talking to\nand then if I work with the people that\nI'm talking to then they start to like\nfeel better about themselves maybe\nchange the way they interact with other\npeople maybe improve their relationships\nmaybe get a promotion maybe switch jobs\nwhatever maybe find love the first thing\nthat I'm really struggling with is that\nI'm not sure exactly what I need to do\nwith you all like I don't see this is\nyour problem which I know sounds kind of\nlike really really like dumb and obvious\nbut at the same time it's actually quite\ndifferent from most of the stuff that I\ndo right even when I talk to women who\nhave been like wronged in some way like\nlast Wednesday we had a woman who talked\nsome about some of her experiences with\nwith a man and still like I know how to\nhelp that person right there's a lot of\nstuff about like shame and and sort of\nunderstanding yourself and why you're\nconflicted and why you're torn up and\nlike you don't know how to act and I'm\nnot talking about what I'm saying is\nthat even in that situation where\nthere's like sort of like a good guy and\na bad guy I can still work with the good\nguy to try to help them be like a little\nbit calmer and understand themselves a\nlittle bit better with me I don't know\nhow to do that with y'all because I'm\nreally not sure exactly what here is\nyour piece and this is the best that I\ncan come up so the first thing is that\nlike what's really confusing me is if\nmost of the questions that I want to ask\nout like most the questions that pop\ninto my mind or not most but some don't\nhave to do with you they have to do with\nthe person on the other side of the\ntable right like I want to ask the dude\nlike\nwhy like when you message a girl like\nwhat's in your head\nin terms of like what are you expecting\nout of this interaction like is this\nlike are you like I won't understand\nbecause we have this really interesting\nanalogy right of like grinding\nreputation with an NPC faction and is\nthat what's in their head cuz I'm really\ncurious about that like I'm really\ncurious like what do they think because\nit here I mean we're listening to Megan\nand Megan is like I send a heart emoji\nand now I'm stopping to use emojis and\nlike what that's no way to live life\nlike what is life without emojis you\nknow it's like and so then we get to you\nknow what's on you and and that I'm not\ntrying to blame you guys but I'm sort of\nsaying like what what do you all do\npsychologically right and and what I\nhear is this like whole thing of\nmoderating behavior I don't know if you\nguys heard Cinna say like you know I\ndeal with the [ __ ] for a while and then\nI'm at my limit and I can't take it\nanymore that's like a thread that I'm\nhearing from you all that you guys\ntolerate sorry y'all you guys you women\nthat sounds so doesn't that's out there\nauga Tory when I say to you women I'm\nfine with you guys like man thing that\nhonestly it's weird though because any\nopposite of like you gals like doesn't\nthat sound condescending like that feels\ncondescending to me I don't know\nanyway I'm confused but let's stick with\nyou all so I'm gonna lean on my Texas\nroots so the interesting thing is it\nsounds like y'all end up putting up with\na lot of stuff that maybe you shouldn't\nand then I kind of get the sense that\nyou all are [ __ ] no matter where you\ngo so like here's the decision tree\nright like queue up for a game and then\ndo you speak or do you not speak\nif you speak you're [ __ ] so then you\nmoderate your behavior and then you stop\nspeaking and then it's like how on earth\nare you supposed to play a game of\noverwatch without communicating with\nyour teammates I would make one note\nyeah I find like um it kind of depends\non the game and also the region that\nyou're in because like for the most part\nlike I play in North America and for the\nmost part like overwatch is like pretty\ngood it's like not like the worst like\nso I think it really depends on the game\nyou're playing to so it's like the idea\nlike this behavior is just a given is\nlike just complete [ __ ] because it's\nnot it's not like even across all games\nlike some games are worse so that's\nreally interesting because that implies\nthat there are individual cultural\ncommunities that treat women differently\nwhich I'm really curious and like you\nsaid Megan what that means that there\nmay be a possibility for us to look at\none game as opposed to another game\nfigure out how those suits are different\ndifferent and then try to implement to\nchange a cultural change from one gaming\ncommunity to do another that's a really\ninteresting point can I go back to\nranting yes sorry no no I'm that\nactually is maybe the most useful thing\nto come out of this but just back to my\nrant because I enjoy doing that from\ntime to time so like here's the decision\ntree that I see in y'all's head to play\nthe game or to not play the game alright\nso you decide to play the game okay and\nthen you're like okay like I said I can\nplay the game as long as I don't use\nemojis fine and then you know to speak\nor not to speak and even if you speak\nthen like even if you open your mouth\nlike you're you're like engaging in\ningesting with you know the nameless\npeople that you're in a game with like\nthat's what it feels like to me it's\nlike you're saddling up and you get your\nLance and it's like hello and then y'all\nheard in this competition right because\nthe second you open your mouth there are\npeople charging at you with Lance's and\nanything from putting their\nblankety-blank into your whatever asking\nfor your urine or was the other one\noh yeah making you a sandwich or make me\na sandwich right it's like those are the\nthree different like kinds of people\nthat you'll deal with or being called an\nattention border so those are that and\nso then like then the question becomes\nlike how do you even engage with this\nit's like it's not a battle that you can\nwin\nand so then the question is first of all\ndo you engage or do you not engage and\nthen maybe what I'm hearing is that\nsometimes y'all can actually thread the\nneedle and find some perfect response\nthat kind of gets people to back up and\nmaybe actually like letting you play the\ngame but that's just so unfair like when\nI play a game I don't you know I it's\njust different like I don't I don't I\nmean I just don't have to do that [ __ ]\nand it sounds awful it's like I just\nplay the game and then you know I yell\nat people because they suck and then\nthey yell at me because I suck and then\nwe tell each other we have small penises\nand then that's the end of it right it's\nlike maybe there's something cultural\nand toxic there I'm sure there is that's\nprobably part of the problem I don't\nactually but I'm saying that like you\nknow men male male interactions seem to\nhave a little bit like knots I mean my\nsense having participated in the gaming\ncommunity as a dude and watched other\ntoxicity between men is that we tend to\nlike not make it we tend to not treat\neach other like NPCs like you'll still\nget flamers and ragers and stuff like\nthat but it's not like they're raging at\nyou because of what your gender is it's\njust they're raising raging at you\nbecause you like made a mistake in the\ngame or even they made a mistake in the\ngame and they're finding some way to\nblame you that's like standard fair game\nor toxicity that sounds different from\nwhich all tequila could shove like you\nhaven't even played the game like you\nhave nothing to rage at you about you\nsay hello and then it's like here we go\nand so then and so then you'll start to\nstay silent or you try to thread the\nneedle a particular way or you try to\nlike joke back and like that sounds\nexhausting and then somewhere along the\nway you know and then even if you engage\nwith them and they like treat you well\nin the game then they slide into your\nDMS and you're kind of dealing with them\nafter\nand they you know you tell them hey I'm\nasexual and then you send them a heart\nemoji and they're like you hurt my\nfeelings I love you send me your urine\nsoaked bathwater right and there's like\nyou know I mean I've even so here's my\nnext question and then sometimes what\nhappens is you try to you have all these\nfeelings right so if I'm listening to\nSinha what I'm hearing is that you all\nhave feelings that kind of pile up and\nthen eventually you reach a breaking\npoint and then you say no I'm not into\nyou or whatever I don't know where you\nrespond to them in some way right either\nyou set a limit you draw a line in the\nsand or you tell them that their\nbehavior isn't okay or you don't or or\nthe worst crime of all what's the worst\ncrime that you can commit is not being\nin love with someone right and then if\nyou commit that crime then they call you\nan attention [ __ ] they talk [ __ ] about\nyou whatever so this is the picture that\nI'm getting now I want to just stop for\na second and consider for a moment that\nthe picture that I'm painting has you\nguys doing nothing wrong right so that's\nthe picture that I'm seeing from you but\nI think probably somewhere in there\nthere's something that can be changed\nhere I don't know what that is but it\nseems to me to be like sort of a\nreasonable picture like what do y'all\nthink so first of all anyone want to say\nanything or respond yeah I'd like to say\nsomething yeah go for it I think the\nmost hurtful part of it all is being\ndismissed about how you feel and when\nyou do like the bubble does burst it's\nbeing always dismissed as like oh you\ncan't take a joke or stuff like that\nbut that's why I would like to say that\nthis\nstuff doesn't just happen every like so\nmonths it can happen to you every day\nand it can happen to you as soon as\nyou're on the internet meaning they\ndon't care if you're 12 or 13 or 14 or\n15 so you hear it every single day that\nyou don't belong and that you should do\nwhat they tell you and I think that's\nthe most hurtful part about it because\nthen we do alter our behaviors because\nit hasn't changed for the over 15 years\nthat I've been playing online games\nwhat's horrible about that yes in a\ngarden sorry I think also one of the\nthings that's also terrible because I\nnoticed this happened for like a lot of\nwomen and it's really disgusting I\nreally I'm it's just I can't believe\nthat some people go through limits of\nlike daxing us just because he say no or\nthreatening us or trying to say like oh\nwe're gonna stocky we're gonna get you\nto like I think it's one of the worst\nthe absolute worst when they threatened\nto kill or hurt you and your loved ones\nbecause you free check them or you just\nsay no and you're standing up for\nyourself that [ __ ] sounds crazy people\nthreaten to kill you and your loved ones\nbecause you said no to them\nit's more likely than you think yeah\nhow likely is and you know\ndepends on maybe the community of the\nguy but yeah it's happened to me quite a\nfew times\nquite a few is like fat like more than\n10 oh wow\nand and how do you all feel when they\nsay that to you\nI can't do anything yeah the best I can\ndo is walk away do you I think I think\nit depends like because I've had a case\nwhere it's like I did have this person\nadded on Facebook so like they actually\nknew where I lived so like that that\nlike makes it more like actionable\nseeming but like since then it's like I\ndon't give like that sort of personal\ninformation about hmm\nI mean I it if so much of this\nconversation blows my mind but I guess\nwhat I'm kind of curious about is like\ndo you all feel like you're actually in\ndanger I've been not all the time but I\nhave been physically stalked and\nharassed through someone who knew me\nfrom the gaming community online so\nsometimes yeah\ncan we just appreciate how [ __ ] up\nNavi statement is does anyone get a\nsense of what I think is just incredibly\n[ __ ] up about it any idea it is [ __ ]\nup the problem is it's just like it's\nnormal for us so yeah so I don't know if\ny'all caught that but she said not all\nthe time but dot dot dot and it's like\nwhat on earth it's some right and you're\nlike not all the time but sometimes\npeople do actually physically sup it's\nnot me from the internet it's like what\nthe standard is just so far from the\nnorm but I think the thing with that\nwhen you say norm it's like like this is\nour normal that's most compared in and\nlike I can't understand your normal\nbecause I don't I don't get to live like\nthat online yeah that's that's what I'm\nsaying that's why I'm having trouble\nlike figuring out what on earth to say\nor think or ask in class I'm just\ntalking this way yeah I just wanted to\nsay that I I thought about this a little\nbit and it was like I started being\nonline when I was like 12 or 13 and I\nguess I stumbled upon the rules of the\ninternet if you're familiar and you know\nthe rules say there's no girls on the\ninternet and tits\nor get the [ __ ] out and I think you know\nas a first impression of like the kind\nof space that I'm going to engage in if\nthat's what the rules of the internet\nsay you know I gotta be\nfor all the hate I'm gonna get like I\nthink that's why this is the norm\nmmm-hmm like or at least that was like\nwhat let's say ten years ago a bit or\nmaybe 15\nand what's the I also like to add\nyou don't have to even say no to anyone\nto get this harassment\nI think there's what do you what do you\nhave to do to get this harassment just\nspeak\nyeah that's why I said it starts when\nyou're very young unfortunately and you\ndon't need a question or an answer to a\nquestion to even get it\nthere are plenty of apps where\nyou just talk or ask a question and you\nimmediately get told how they would like\nto do you and they don't care if you're\n13 or not\nthat's that's just how it is and you\ndon't know how to deal with that when\nyou're young and\nyou know some girls then engage or some\ndon't luckily there's a buck button or\nhighly recommend every girl to use the\nblack button but yeah that is just that\ncould be a daily message to too\nyou know what blows my mind about that\nas you say I don't know how to you know\nwhen you're 13 you don't know how to\ndeal with that I have a grown ass 37\nyear old man with the family kids and a\njob and if someone I talked to randomly\non the internet said that they want to\n[ __ ] me in a particular way I wouldn't\nknow how to do yeah\nand that's why I said like the\ndismissive part hurts the most\nbecause\nyou're Bismol accountable for actions\nlike oh why didn't you speak up sooner\nall writing you do this well because you\nwere 13 years old and you had no clue\nhow to handle it what is that what does\nthat mean that the dismissive part and\nwho's asking that question well when you\ndo tell these stories or you do like\nhave a conversation about it there\nluckily there are enough men that are\nvery supportive and understanding and\nwant to listen but there's always people\nthat are very dismissive or you know why\ncan you not take the normal make a\nsandwich joke well because one we've\nheard it for a thousand times but also\nbecause we know what comes next\nand we don't want to deal with it right\nnow\nyeah yeah so it sounds like people blame\nyou for your reaction oh yeah yeah\nyou're not allowed to feel how you feel\nabout stuff feel like you have to feel\nlike a certain way and if you don't feel\nthat way then you're just overreacting\nor like too emotional so it sounds like\nthey gate keep what you're allowed to do\nand think and feel I mean that's what\nI'm hearing right so you'll have to\nrespond in a particular way and I'm not\nreally hearing like a light at the end\nof the tunnel either we're seeing and\nand because I kind of get the sense that\nlike you know you're kind of [ __ ] at\nevery step of the equation like first\ninteraction to speak or not to speak to\nengage or not engage to follow up in the\nDMS or not the DMS to tolerate some kind\nof behavior I'm also getting some degree\nof emotional dependency and and I don't\nknow if this makes sense but what I'm\nfeeling on the other end of the\ninteraction is hunger okay I get the\nsense that there like a lot of hungry\npeople out there does that feel right\nlike it's just like they're hungry for\nsomething like what are they hungry for\nlike they're looking to you to like\nsatisfy something and if you say quick I\ndon'ts 1 I don't know what's why is this\nthe quick fix for whatever they're\nhungry for yeah so that's the thing\nright is I don't think it's actually a\nquick fix because what I'm hearing from\nyou all is that despite what you do\nthey're still hungry for more\nand then you feed them and you feed them\nand you feed them and then eventually\nyou can't feed them anymore and then\nthey get upset at you because you sent a\nheart emoji or whatever so what do you\nthink it is that they're hungry for like\nwhat do they want for any idea well at\nleast in one case like I think I had\nthis issue with this one guy where he\nthought like oh if I just dated him like\nhis life would be perfect and like his\nproblems would all magically be solved\nand I'm like that's [ __ ] like that's\nnot how that works that's not gonna fix\nyour problems but in his head like\nthat's like how he thought that would\nwork out and so like that's why like he\nwas so insistent on it interesting\ndo other people relate to that yeah I\nthink it's like the whole Manic Pixie\ndream mindset a lot of movies have\nimplied on what does that mean that what\nis a Manic Pixie so like a Manic Pixie\ndream girl is it's it's common in a lot\nof tropes for films and basically one of\nthe things is that a guy has a good\nboring life nothing interesting is\nhappening no value he has no sense of\ndirection a girl comes in his life is\nmillion times better he he finally finds\nhis confidence he's finally living a\nlife that he he wants and everything\never since that girl came into the\npicture and you know everything is just\na million times better and I think\nthat's also one of the things that a lot\nof films try to imply is that if you\nfind like the love of your life if\nyou're fully complete and everything\nhmm what do you think about that\nI think they're all trying to shoot\ntheir shot sometimes you miss 100% of\nthe you miss 100% of the shots you don't\ntake is kind of the the typical guy\nthing I hear in that regard mmm they'll\nkeep asking out and asking out gating\nrejections and doesn't matter how bad\nthey are at it like they might not learn\nfrom how bad they are at it they'll just\nkeep trying\num I agree with both na'vi and sinha and\nat least in my experience because I have\nlike engaged with these people in the\npast and I try to help them through like\nyou know they say they like me but it's\nlike you just met me dude\nor like we just played a game together\nlike what are you talking about and you\nknow I would like talk through it with\nlike talk with them and at least what I\nsee is that there's a severe need for\nlike guys to talk about their feelings\nthat's I mean again that's my experience\nbut it's just you know they could talk\nfor hours about what they're going\nthrough how they feel and stuff like\nthat and maybe they want to talk to a\ngirl because I don't know why or you\nknow maybe it's because they feel like\nthey're gonna be judged by their\nboyfriends I have no idea okay so let me\nask you guys a question and and you know\nI know we're sort of getting into the\nhypothesis space of the people on the\nother side of the table so what do you\nall need as we're here for you we're not\nhere for them\nI think like for me it's just like I\nwant people like to stop like\nsecond-guessing me or almost like\ngaslighting me in a sense well like I\ntell people like I had this terrible\ninteraction with this person and like\nthey said shitty things to me and then\nthem not turn around and be like Oh was\nthat a joke\nand I'm like I can tell what a joke is\nand I've had people try and like uhm say\nsomething that's like sexual in nature\nand then they try and write it off as a\njoke\nwhen I don't receive it well and it's\nlike you didn't mean that as a joke when\nyou said it and it's like like they try\nand like twist it into like oh it was\njust a joke that you didn't get and it's\nlike I got that you said that seriously\nand I'm not stupid\nyeah so it sounds like what you need\npeople to do is maybe take\nresponsibility for their actions instead\nyeah absolving themselves of\nresponsibility by saying nothing wrong\nhappened I think too like there's almost\nlike this expectation sometimes when\nlike I'm in these communities where it's\nlike I'm supposed to be like really like\num compassionate and have like a lot of\nemotional depth and then like the guys\nare like allowed to be like as deep as a\nsheet of paper and I supposed to be like\nan encyclopedia and it's like well maybe\nI'm just a children's book when it comes\nto that\nsounds like you're being frustrated as\nbeing judged as an NPC faction with\ncertain advocates\nwell yeah cuz it's like um when you like\nwhen they put all these expectations on\nyou and then like you don't meet them\nit's like frustrating cuz if you feel\nlike you failed but it's like why did I\nhave these expectations to begin with\nsure like I'm a random-ass person on the\ninternet like why do you have all these\nexpectations for me I think we sort of\nheard that to tell you that from Cinar\nearlier to about her kind of trying to\nlive up to expectations and provide\npeople with something and then she kind\nof hits her limit too\nso what I'm hearing from Megan is that\nmaybe not validation isn't really the\nright word\nI guess what are y'all hearing from\nMegan in terms of what she means what\nshe wants\nI guess - I could like elaborate a\nlittle where I feel like I'm put in\nsituations where like I'll have like\nthese bad interactions with people and\nthen I still have to hang around them\nbecause they're still permitted to be in\nthe friend group even though like\nthey're an [ __ ] to me like all the\ntime and it's like okay and they get\naway with it because they're not [ __ ]\nto like other dudes like they're cool\nwith other dudes but it's just you so\nlike you should just get over it\nokay so Megan I'm gonna actually ask you\nnot to elaborate further\nand I'm gonna ask you your colleagues to\nthink a little bit about what do y'all\nthink it is that Megan needs yes II know\nthat's it I think only things like I\ndon't think treating a person just you\nknow equally like the same way that you\ntreat your homies or treat like\neverybody you know it's like a normal\nperson's like okay cool you know like I\nneed that spotlight I don't need that\nsunshine all over me or or anything\nfocused on me negative positive either\nway just treat me like a human being\nthat's it\nanything to that yeah I think what I\nneed is I think I need other like I have\nmen in my life who are a game with and\nthey're all super respectable and like\nyou know like when we talk like this we\nknow it's not all men and we all have\nlike guy friends if we like to play\ngames with when I'm playing games with\nthem and there is someone who's\nproblematic they get on my side really\nquickly and give me support when those\nmoments happen hmm I know some guys are\nafraid to do that for fear of like the\nwhite knight kind of perspective that\ngets thrown at them but it's nice but\nit's not just me attacking this alone\nand it's like somebody else is there to\nhelp yeah I think understanding and and\nbeing respectful goes a long way\nhow does okay\nit's about to ask a question but I don't\nthink it's a good question right now\nsorry\nlet me think is that okay if I think for\nif anybody else wants to share please do\notherwise all that I can share something\nthat's right uh-huh like in some games\nlike if you talk like you almost get\nlike idolized if you talk like wow like\nthere's a girl on my team like it's my\nobjective now to be your friend just\nlike I like you know and you don't meet\ngirls that much in video games like I\nwould kind of appreciate it if like\npeople would stop doing that or like\nstop giving me the expectation of like\noh like now that you talk like girls are\nusually bad at games like let's see how\nyou do let's see if you do better you\nknow what I mean and then it's like\nawkward and I have to live up to like\nthe expectation of like wow I think\ngirls are bad at games now I have to do\nreally good or like they haven't met\nthat many I have to like have the whole\nreputation of womankind now in my hands\nyeah awkward cuz they'll be like oh like\nthere's another girl in the lobby like\nyou're her enemy now like why like I\ndon't get it\nlike I feel like sometimes I'm pitted\nagainst other woman cuz I'll be like oh\nwell they're not doing as well as you\nyou can't be their friend like what what\ndo you dislike no thanks for sure what\ndo you dislike about that mantle what's\nhard about that just I guess like all\nthe expectations just like in general I\ndon't know it's impossible to live up to\nyeah\nit's interesting right because I'm\nhearing a lot of degrading behavior I'm\nalso hearing a lot of idolizing behavior\nso how can we understand what's the\nsimilarity between idolizing someone and\ndegrading them\nis there one it's not looking at them\nfor who they are yeah\nglass you were going to say something I\nwas gonna say it's an exaggeration - but\nlike both are exaggerated that's what\nI'm hearing y'all is that like\nultimately y'all aren't perceived as\nhuman right anything but that you're not\na complex organism with thoughts\nfeelings preferences that just because\nyou're a girl doesn't mean particular\nthings it doesn't mean anything it means\nthat maybe you like barbecue and maybe\nyou don't it means that maybe you like\nto play this game and maybe you don't it\nmeans that maybe you're good and maybe\nyou saw\nand oddly enough in a bizarre way what\nI'm what I'm hearing from y'all is that\nyou know really really and I'm gonna say\nsomething that's a little bit extreme\njust for the sake of making a point I\nthink it's almost like what y'all would\nappreciate is toxicity if you sucked\nlike if you suck at a game and someone\ncalls you out on it something tells me\nthat y'all would actually be okay with\nthat but that you should be judged based\non you as opposed to their conception of\nyou right and it's kind of weird to\nthink about but like if you guys do a\ngood job it's just you did a good job\nnot you did a good job in spite of your\ngenitals or if you if people like you\nthey like you because you're you and not\nbecause the world is full of simps that\nmaybe you have inherent value that\npeople can be drawn to outside of your\ngenitals shocking but what I'm hearing\nfrom y'all is that's not what happens\nand there's a lot just really bad [ __ ]\nlike it didn't really cross my mind that\nlike y'all started you know being on the\ninternet when you were 12\nlike that's just terrible there's no\nlike age limitations\nI couldn't tell if you were stretching\nor raising your hand I kind of wanted to\nalso say something cuz I'm sure few of\nus have gone through this experience\nbefore where there's another female in\nthe VC there's another girl and because\nof that she notices that you're a girl\nand she kind of puts you down for being\na girl and you're just like we know\nwe're on the same team why are you\ndragging me down and I think that's also\none of the things it's just like I'm not\nlike her I'm not like that eagerly you\nknow I'm not like other girls and I\nthink that's also women frustrating is\njust like do you we go through the same\n[ __ ] together why are you also putting\nme down too you know that's something\ny'all have experienced toxicity from\nother girls and or women and in gaming\nyeah yeah yeah yeah runs the person you\nlike really likes attention and yeah\njust insecurity they don't want to lose\nwhat they have with the with the guys\nthat they play and what are they ending\nnon harassment or just attention\nattention yeah so there are attention\n[ __ ] out there there are West doesn't\nmatter what gender it is\npoint how do you hmm so is most of the\ntoxicity that you get from other women\nyou think relating to attention or other\nthings attention or status if they have\nstatus within that group of friends or\nwithin that community then they would be\nincentivized to put down other people so\nthat they can maintain their status and\nkeep you below them in that's what I\nwould call the insecurities really\nbecause I don't want to lose it and\nthey're afraid they've got the\nreputation worth getting exalted for so\njust go back to our analogy have you all\never done that um I've had some issues\nwhere I've had to deal with girls who\nhad been boosted by some friends of mine\nand then they'd have like these\nattitudes and then I would be like and\nlike I didn't know how to deal with them\nbecause I didn't want to be mean to them\nbut like at the same time I'm like\nyou're objectively bad at this game and\nit's like it's insulting that you're\nacting like you're good when I know I\nknow who boosted you and like dealing\nwith that dynamic\nand so like I I I think sometimes maybe\nI come off like a little rude to some of\nthose girls but it's like it's not so\nmuch like the girl thing it's like that\nthey're boosted trash and I don't like\nbeing thought of as on the same level as\nyou right interesting it's an ego thing\nyeah that sounds like standard ego\nthough doesn't sound like gender\nspecificity ego sounds like you're for a\nshitty that got boosted you should know\nyour place we can all relate to that\ncan't we relate to that in a\ngender-neutral way\nso I'm curious though if y'all ever felt\ntoxic towards either other women or men\njust said okay to ask that question yeah\nI think so okay\nI think a long time ago playing\nStarcraft 2 I potentially been\naccidentally toxic in certain\ncommunities there were there were a lot\nof communities kind of like fighting\neach other for like status and\nsuperiority other over other groups and\nsometimes that created like infighting\nwithin the same gaming community that\nwas unnecessary\nso and what did your I've been there\nbefore and done it too\ndo you mind if I ask you a couple\nquestions about that sure what does that\ntoxicity look like I think it's like\nputting people down I never did it like\na gender specific way but like telling\npeople even if they are like really good\ncompared to me like you suck you\nshouldn't play like uninstall like that\nkind of thing\ngood yeah that's like that's the kind of\nstuff that unites us as gamers you know\nblanket toxicity towards other people\nfor being better than than we are that's\nwhat unites us as a community I've never\nI've never understood what you guys have\ngone through until this moment other\npeople I'm curious for me it's always\nbeen like once you meet another girl in\nthe same game or same hobby whatever it\nis it's always testing whether or not\nyou're there for the same reasons like\nare you also there just to play games\nand then we hit it off like the dentist\nbecause then it's more supportive then\nit's more just like yeah let's just play\nthe game and if someone is being mean\nthen we can both handle it together and\nwhen they're not for that and when\nthey're you know more there for the\nfront of attention then it's like okay\nI'm I'm done I don't have been if any\ny'all felt like you were there for the\nattention or if there have been times in\nyour life where you've appreciated the\ntension or sold bodily fluids over the\nInternet\nno never that no but I would say like\none nice thing is like it's easy to get\nlike invited to discord communities and\nlike Frank groups as a girl like that's\none thing I will acknowledge is like\nit's much easier to like find a group of\npeople to play with as a girl but I\nthink too like there's also like the\nconsequences like some of them it's like\nin these discards they give you like a\nweird like role on the discord and you\ndon't want that role but like\nlike Queens or like collection or like\nthings like that like and then it's like\nall girls in it and it's like weird\ninteresting so what do you all think\nabout you know communities like do you\nguys find that it's like okay hold on\nlet me just think about what Meghan said\nso it sounds like once again that you're\nnot really being treated as a person\nright so even though there are some\nbenefits like you get invited but\nthey're not really inviting you they're\ninviting their expectation of you I find\nit really hard to know where I stand\nwith like these groups of people like do\nthey actually like like me and wanna be\nmy friend or am I just there because\nit's like I'm a girl and like they like\nhaving girls around and what are you all\nso when it comes to interacting with\nother girls who play games what's that\nlike so Celaya sort of said you know\nsometimes there may be like a little bit\nattention-seeking and sometimes they're\njust there to play games and it kind of\nyou sort of feel each other out and then\nsort of get a sense of okay how's this\ngonna go what about other people I think\nI try to first engage like see has about\nhow it goes like yell with [ __ ] was\npoppin and then if it goes like you\ndon't talk to me heck off and I'm like\nokay I that kind of hurt me is one in\nthe makeup female friend man\nand then if it goes great I'm just like\nyo I made a new friend today yo and I\nthink it just goes either that way but\nthen sometimes it really hurts me when\nanother girl is just like no back off\nwe're not gonna be friends I don't want\nto talk to you it's like you're just\nanother stupid like eager on the\ninternet and it's like you know jabs at\nyou\nhmm interesting\nany other perspective zones I think it\nlike definitely has to do with like I\nguess the big group of people you're\nalready with because sometimes if you\ntalked like a group of people in video\ngames just not like a lot of girls like\nafter a while you almost become like\nbear girl then another girl comes in and\nsometimes they'll be like oh yeah I\ndon't really know the line I hear laughs\nfrom girls is oh yeah I don't really\nhave I don't really talk to other girls\nI don't get along with other girls it\nmakes me almost feel like dismiss like\noh like okay like I see where we stand\nnow like we're not gonna be friends like\nI think you're saying you're saying you\nhear it a lot right so yeah I do cuz you\nknow my instinct would be that people\nwho share an experience can lean on each\nother for support but I'm hearing that\nit's kind of like you know 50/50 or\nmaybe even like the odds are against you\nin terms of interacting with other women\nwho play video games\nis that the cat I'm really just curious\nwhat's been yeah I I think most women\nlike to play you know through their\nexperiences kind of isolated from others\nbecause if they reach out they get hurt\nso they've learned not to reach out\nI think I've seen that experience happen\na lot through the course of my lifetime\ninteresting hmm so I have any any\nthoughts or questions just anything that\nwe've left out or people want to ask or\ncurious about other people in the group\nyou all are welcome to you know ask each\nother questions too\nif not I have a couple of other thoughts\nor questions and maybe a kind of one I\nmention about this because I guess I\nnever felt this way for like a long time\nI guess like ever since there is like\nthe the women server and the discord\nspecifically here for healthy gamer and\neverything cuz like I I've tried to make\nmore female friends because I want to\nexpand my group not just only disguise\nbut also girls and everybody and you\nknow and I guess one of the things I\njust wish there was more communities\nlike the ones that we have over here\nwhere there are so many girls who are\njust supportive and just being there for\neach other and just like hey I'll listen\nto your problems I know what it feels\nlike\nI can I can empathize with how you feel\nand I just kind of wish there was more\ngroups like that online\nyeah it took me a long time to even find\na group like that I think I'm lucky to\neven have a group like that\nso let me just be a little bit\ntransparent so do you all think that the\nsort of woman's face on our discord\nserver is a good thing yes I think so\nyeah like I said I was lucky that I\nalready had a group before this so where\nwe just share experiences but also just\nrent when something has happened or you\nknow how we feel and it it it just helps\nto just know that you have a backup\nwhere you can just put those feelings\nout and you can be supported supportive\nimplant instead of being dismissed about\nit that's why I think that this scored\nit was a very good idea because it\nbrings more people together I think to\nlike I've spent a lot of time and like\nthe main discord and the sad thing is is\nlike there has been cases where girls\nhave come and they tried to talk about\nsay things like their relationships and\nthe guys there have been less than\nsympathetic to say the least in some\ncases so I think like that's why I like\nthe women's discard cuz like it gives\nthem the opportunity to talk about those\nthings there\nI have some thoughts and I'm just trying\nto figure out how much to say so let me\nstart with this there's a big\nbehind-the-scenes process about a lot of\nthis stuff that people don't see and you\nknow just as a community if I can just\nshare some thoughts I'd love to get like\ny'all's reflections on this so I kind of\nmentioned this a some time ago that in a\nsense I think that the woman's face on\ndiscord is sort of a bad idea because I\nthink it's sort of a band-aid for a\nproblem that like is kind of and that's\nnot actually the solution that I want\nwhat I want is for that to no longer be\nneeded\nright that like that you guys like what\nwe're hearing is that you what what I'm\nhearing from you y'all overwhelmingly is\nit you want to just be treated as humans\nyou don't want to be dehumanized you\ndon't want to be treated as a Manic\nPixie you don't want to be treated as an\nemotional you know bucket for people to\nrelate to you don't want to be treated\nas a sex object you don't want to be\ntreated as the solution to anyone's\nproblems you want it to be you want to\njust be treated like the shitty ass\ngamer that you are just like the rest of\nus right well scrubs and we all suck and\nthat's how you hole want to be treated\nfair and and that's what I that's what I\nenvision is is that's really what I want\nour discord to be as a place where like\nwe can all just be like flawed humans\nwho are good at some things and bad at\nother things and so that's kind of the\nfirst thought the second thought is that\nI've so I'm not allowed in the women's\ndiscord okay and and so I really don't\nknow what goes on there but it's really\nhappy I'm really happy to hear from you\nguys that you find it to be like a\nuseful place and at the same time you\nknow we do deal with a lot of toxicity\nand so sometimes we get you know we\nbanned people from our server who\nbasically do some of the stuff that\ny'all are talking about so they start to\nbecome emotionally pressuring thankfully\nI mean I haven't heard about anything\nthat is super severe in terms of you\nknow Docs and people or death threats or\nanything like that maybe that stuff goes\non because thankfully we've got a pretty\ngood team of mods who like sort of takes\ncare of things but you know I I do sort\nof know that people are emotionally\nneedy or and that sometimes they put\npressure on other members and it's not\njust women by the way all right so a lot\nof people like kind of get burnt out\nfrom like trying to support other people\non our discord and then I've also heard\nof of you know potentially like toxicity\nor stuff from women on our discord and\nalso towards other women and I'm curious\nif you guys have experienced that or is\nthat something that now\ncool yeah not yet okay great\nI'm happy to hear that yeah that's cool\nso you know I want to kind of and any\nother thoughts I'm glad you brought up\nthe discord and stuff by the way Cinna\nyeah I think most of us can agree on\nthis it it was I guess like when the\nserver opened up and everything and I\nwas posting my selfie I was like oh my\ngod there's no mediums oh my gosh and\nit's just like wait this should be\nnormal right and oh we call it\nit was just felt so nice like for\neveryone else to post their selfies and\nnot just be creeped out by other people\nand they know that like you know their\nselfie is gonna be okay\nnothing Bad's gonna happen after it you\nknow wow that's crazy\nthe silent world yeah I'm actually very\nsurprised are you sure it actually got\nuploaded yes cuz I'm genuine like I know\nwe try to foster a pretty positive\ncommunity but even that's not like I'm a\nlittle bit skeptical you know I put\nfaith in our discord community\nbeforehand been burned so you know it's\nnot that I don't love them\nit's just that you know let's not sorry\ncan I tell you all the story yes okay so\nthere was one time there was a monk who\nwas sitting by the edge of a river and\nthere was a scorpion who like fell into\nthe river so the monk pulls out the\nscorpion and gets stung in the process\nand then he like drops it on the on the\nbank and then a few minutes later\nscorpion falls back into the river and\nthen the monk pulls it out again and\ngets stung again and then a few minutes\nlater scorpion fine like you know falls\ninto the river again the monk pulls it\nout against this get stunned at their\ntime and then one of his disciples is\nkind of there and he's like master like\nwhy on earth do you keep on pulling the\nscorpion out of the river because it\nkeeps singing and the master says it's\nmy nature to pull it's it's the\nscorpions nature to sing people that\npick it up and it's my nature to pull\ndrowning things out of the water so it's\ngonna keep happening what do you all\nthink about that I don't know if that\nstory made a whole a sense\nyeah it sounded like\npair of pair of behaviors that became\ncyclical right yeah and I think you know\nsometimes I wonder a little bit because\nwhat I'm hearing from Sinha is that\nsomeone pulled the Scorpion out of the\nwater and they didn't get stuff because\nwe expect a certain response right like\nthere's a cycle of behavior if you post\nsomething about yourself people are\ngoing to slide into your DMS try to buy\nyour urine I think - maybe like it's too\nmuch like guys maybe I should stop I'm\nbasically saying it for her benefit at\nthis point anyway sorry was that\noffensive I don't know no you're fine\nit's just like cringe yeah I feel so\nstupid it's almost funny but almost\nsomething that's what we do right is we\nwe laugh when there's nothing else we\ncan do because the rest of the feelings\nare too painful\nNavi you were saying something oh I\ndon't think so\nno okay I was laughing yeah so let me\nask y'all um kind of one more question\nand that's like what can I do what can\nwe do what do you all I sort of asked\nyou earlier like you know what do y'all\nneed and and I'm kind of just really\ncurious like what do you want from other\npeople what do you want from us what do\nyou want from me like what would help\nlike how do we fix this it's a really\ngood question\nhow we fix this that's why we'll start\nwith the earlier ones that's my that's\nmy question honestly and that's the one\nI'm gonna try to solve but her answer\nbut what do you all want what can I do\nwhat can we do what can people who are\nwatching do I guess for me like I just\nwant people to like maybe think of our\nabout like what they say to other people\nand like I guess - like why do you feel\nso entitled to like make these\nstatements to me like the weird like sex\nstatements or like stuff like that\nso you want people to think before they\nspeak big ask Megan ask I kinda would\nlike people to stop giving me pet names\nif I don't know them\nthat's very helpful additionally I would\nlike it if like if somebody's like\ntalking to me in the game I don't need\nsomebody to like step in and be like oh\ndon't talk to her she gets this enough\nyou know what I'm like I don't need that\neither you know what I mean I just want\nto be like a normal human like you want\nto ask how my day is like I'll answer\nthat in game like that's fine we're like\nI don't need like the whole game to be\nlike all about me if I like talk once\nlike if I don't whine like one question\nyou know like I just want to be normal\nokay yeah so so let me ask y'all this\nquestion cuz I'm hearing like slightly\ndifferent things so I think it's\nprobably all the same but on the one\nhand you know Navi said earlier that\nit's nice when people within the game\nwere supportive and I'm also hearing\nthat sometimes it's annoying when people\nsort of speak for you and can you all\nhelp us understand you know like what's\nthe balance they're like so what would\nyou you know if someone calls you a\n[ __ ] in a game if there are other\npeople around what would you want them\nto say or not say rather rather than\nlike leave her alone call out the\nbehavior and what they're saying like\ncalled them out and put the attention on\nthem for their behavior instead of\nputting it on like leave her alone don't\nsay that to hurt like put it back on him\nhey yep that's an awful thing to say hey\ncut that out\nidiot like stop that's very helpful\ndoes that mean yeah would you all agree\nwith that yeah because that I think\nreally clarify to me for me because the\nsinestro was kind of saying like it's\nnot about me like that's the whole point\nis call out the behavior don't make it\nabout the victim and it's cuz that too\nis like you know treating you like the\nvictim faction and then white knights\ncharge\nother thoughts about you know what what\ncan we do as a community or what can we\ndo as healthy game or if you'll have\nspecific advice for what I can do as a\nhuman besides keep my children away from\nthe Internet I think there's a good end\nfor canceled culture and for people to\njust like I'll cancel the person get\nthem out of here they're not allowed to\nbe part of human society anymore I feel\nand I think it's just like why not just\ncall like I wish it could just change\nfrom being canceled culture mindsets he\njust being like call out instead you\nknow it helped helped me understand or\nif you all agree with that help help us\non yes LA what\nwell yeah I definitely agree with their\nbecause it's not about canceling the\nother person you don't solve the problem\nwith that it's just oh if we get rid of\nthat one person then it'll be fine\nno there's thousands of them so hats why\nhow do we fix that the well it always\nfit that question always feels very\ndaunting to me because it's about the\nminds rent it's about a mindset and\nbeing respectful and that is sometimes\ntoo big of a task I think I don't have\nany helpful suggestions for okay\nbuilding more respect in the gaming\ncommunity for each other not even just\nfor women but\nyeah like I don't know if that helps sum\nit up yeah\nso I'm yeah go for it last I'm gonna\nagree with everyone that like what\neveryone said like other people should\ndo I would say what you can do as a\nhealthy gamer is just talk about this\nmore like we should be having this\ndiscussion a bit more often and I think\nlike from both sides I think it's very\nhelpful that we're here today I don't\nknow what you're interested in\nyes sorry I don't I don't know I don't\nknow if you're interested in like\nthe other side I guess like like the\nboys that have this behavior side talk\ntalked about it but the only like I\ncan't figure out what I should be doing\nto to make this situation better like\nmaybe you can do something maybe the\nbehavior can start changing but like\nwhat I don't know what I should be doing\ndifferently to either avoid being hurt\nor like try to stop this from happening\nyeah I think it's a tall order to put on\ny'all right so I think it's it's hard to\nget the minority to change the majority\nso I think this is sort of like you know\nif you think about slavery in the United\nStates like slavery ends when the\nmajority starts to support the minority\nbecause when there's a power dynamic\nit's really hard for the weaker\npopulation to do something\nand I guess it's interesting to hear you\nguys kind of say that in a sense you're\nnot a fan of canceled culture so let me\nask you all so would you guys want to\nhear from the other side yeah I think\nthat would be helpful\nyeah I think what's frustrating to me\nabout like this behavior - it's like a\nlot of these times like these guys\naren't like terrible people so it's like\nI don't get why they think it's okay to\nlike do this stuff because I meet them\nand like we'll be friends and then like\nthey engage in this behavior and it's\nlike what's wrong with you like you're\nperfectly fine and then yeah so that's\nweird right because I think that there's\nlike there's a certain perception or\npotential toxicity in giving oh man this\nis such a mess okay let's dig into it\nokay so like like it's it's kind of\ninteresting because sometimes when\npeople say there are two sides to every\nstory that actually like further\ndisempowers the victims does that make\nsense to y'all yeah I could say that so\nlike like if we kind of think about you\nknow victims of sexual harassment and\nassault or you know harassment and we\nkind of think about you know listening\nto the other side and I'm not saying\nthat that's the extreme that we're\ntalking about right so like I think that\nmy biggest complaint is that the two in\ncells that we've got and gotten on here\naren't real in cells and maybe that's\nkind of interesting because when you\nactually look underneath the shell of an\nin cell you find a real human heat shock\nand that's sort of what I'm hearing from\nyou all is that that there's a lot of\ntoxic behavior that doesn't mean that\nthe person is evil that there are good\npeople swimming underneath the bad\npeople so yeah I had an idea of\nsomething we can maybe do in the discord\nor we could have a place for women to\npost written stories of some of their\ntreatment online which people can read\nabout or read and then like maybe that\ngives them some more perspective because\nI feel like a like hearing people's\nstories and like hearing about so like\nstuff that happened to them\nlike powerful and I think maybe like\nthat would give them insight and so that\nand I think too\nI've heard people mention that the\nreason they don't like there being only\na woman's space is like they want to\nhear like about these stories and like\nthey want to hear about this stuff and\nhear women's issues and like they don't\nget to hear it because we put it all in\nthe women's discord so like that would\ngive them an opportunity to see it yeah\nI that makes a lot of sense to me I was\nlike very very loath to segregate people\nand I still don't know if that was the\nright choice or not but it's not like\nthe women can only participate in the\nwomen's discord correct so at the end of\nthe day we just wanted to offer a space\nI think it's a really interesting idea\nto post your stories and I would say\nthat that is a scary idea except for\nthis whole selfie thing which is maybe\ngiving me a little bit of faith that\nthose will be received in the right way\nand if I'm hearing you guys correctly\nwould you also want to hear stories from\nthe other perspective definitely yeah\nsome way you can make it safer is you\njust have them submit them to someone in\nthe like a moderator and they post them\nanonymously and then that way it's not\nlinked to individuals in the discord I\nget your Meghan so I think that you know\nthere are a lot of logistics there that\nwe can consider and I appreciate it\nsounds like you've been thinking about\nthis and I appreciate that thoughtful\nsorry I just thought up this now oh no\nno it sounds like so that's kind of\ninteresting so let me I mean it's really\nbizarre to to hear this from y'all but\nlet me just make sure that I'm hearing\nit correctly that like if we got if we\ntook let's say like half a dozen people\nwho've been banned from our discord and\nyou know like put them on you know heard\ntheir stories in some way or had a\nstream what that was would that be\nsomething that y'all would be interested\nin actually hearing\nI don't know if that'd be helpful\nbecause I I've met some people who's had\nmoderate like they've either had mutes\nor stuff in the discord and a lot of\nthem just think like they don't deserve\nthe mute and like they don't acknowledge\nanything that they don't and I don't I\ndon't think they're the most\nintrospective people\nokay so practically like what do y'all\nlike cuz that's that's the other side\nwhen I hear when I hear your side at the\npolar end of the spectrum is the other\nside so that's what we're kind of\nstruggling with is an organization right\nso like what you know then what do you\nall want you all want just the just the\nlow-level ones the ones that are like\n50% sim 50% toxic I think it's worth the\ntry I just maybe it happens maybe it\ndoesn't happen maybe it's too much maybe\nit's not but I for me I I would want I\nwould want to see that I think that's a\nreally good point like what's the worst\nthat can happen if they do come on so\njust that face there's a lot of bets\nthat could probably happen actually the\nworst that could happen is that we get\nbanned and healthy gamer ends right\nthat's pretty bad so already that we're\nnot willing to entertain the possibility\nyeah you might need a greater filter\nthan just the people who've been banned\nprobably sure so yeah\nwell as you want to say something oh no\nno I just agree yeah so it's it's\nfascinating I mean so like I think this\nis I'm really happy in a sense I'm\nreally happy to hear this despite the\nfact that it's scary and potentially\nwill tank us as an organization but on\nthe one hand I just want to say like I'm\nI really commend you all for you know\nbeing so I it's really actually awesome\nwhat y'all are saying and let me tell\nyou why I respect it so much because\nit's it's a very hard thing to be on the\nlike the short end of the stick and to\nbe like treated like [ __ ] by a group of\npeople and still want to say we want to\nlike hear your story and understand what\nyour perspective\nis not to say that your all are being\napologists because I think this is the\nother big problem is that you know\nthere's like there are people with the\npitchforks and then on the other side of\nthe apologists and and I think that most\nof us are in the middle but what I'm\nhearing from y'all is that maybe\ngrabbing the pitchfork is not the best\nthing to do and and maybe trying to\nunderstand what's going on\nis a good idea can I share just one or\ntwo personal thoughts about it which\nmaybe are a little bit controversial\nmm-hmm so here's what my biggest concern\nis with cancel culture is like when you\ngrab the pitchforks and you say that\nthis person is evil this is gonna sound\nreally weird but I think that something\nsubtle happens which is like it becomes\nof them and us and then what happens is\nlike when someone is a complete piece of\n[ __ ] what happens is that they're like\nall the low-level toxicity people who\nlook at the high level toxicity people\nand they say they're over there and\nwe're over here and then suddenly like I\nthink that they don't think that they\ncould do the same thing and maybe cuz I\nthink at the end of the day because they\nknow like they're decent human beings\nand what I'm hearing from you guys is\nlike most people it sounds like when you\nactually get a chance to talk to them\neven the people who are toxic to you or\nmaybe decent human beings maybe most is\ntoo much but lisanna\nand and I what really worries me is that\nlike I think about my own life and I\nthink about how I was well on the road\nto becoming like a woman-hating insult\nand like that was me like I was 19 and\nnever had a girlfriend I've asked a\nbunch of women out and then like one of\nmy buddies like got into the pickup\nartists and was telling me about how to\nget laid and all this kind of stuff and\nand I think like you know in my life\nsomewhere along the way that was a\nbranch point and I don't know I mean I\nthink I'm a decent human being unclear\nbut you know I think at some point like\npeople have a choice and and I think\nwhat's dangerous but is that that you\nknow I think that those people I've been\nasking like this weird sort of ethical\nquestion it which is like when does\nsomeone become like an [ __ ]\nor you know like someone who's like\ntoxic towards women like\nwhen does that like is it one day and\nnot the next day and and how do you\nchange someone's trajectory because I'm\nwith y'all that that you know just\ngetting rid of the worst cancer it\ndoesn't address the systemic toxicity\nand so then the question is like how do\nyou just address the systemic toxicity I\nthink you have to have a systemic\nsolution you can't just keep on\ncancelling the worst people which I'm\nnot saying you shouldn't cancel the\nworst people by all means do that I\nthink people should be held accountable\nto their actions and if you know they\nget canceled they get canceled that's\nfine and sometimes actually it's it's\nbizarre that everyone's kind of talking\nabout canceled culture and like some\npeople should really be talking about\ncriminal charges and and so I mean\nthat's just my thought but it's not my\nplace to say what should or shouldn't\nhappen and and I think what I'm hearing\nfrom you all is that you know maybe and\nI would like to hear from some of these\npeople because I think it's important to\nunderstand like where your beliefs come\nfrom and it's also like I'm glad that\nsome of y'all said you know sometimes I\nhaven't been the nicest person because\ncome on I mean all of you all have\nprobably been assets at some point in\nyour life yeah and that that's you know\njust because you're a woman doesn't mean\nthat you can't act like and ask you know\nand and maybe people will find that\noffensive but I think that's what unites\nus as gamers is that at some point in\ntime we're all toxic [ __ ] and that's\njust what it means it may be one day\nlike that's the bar that's too high for\nme to solve because that's part of who\nwe are and I think it's been really\nawesome for you guys to be able to take\na step back from your personal hurt and\nand be willing to listen to like another\nperspective because I don't I wouldn't\nblame you if you didn't feel that way\nright because when we get hurt like\noftentimes it's completely justifiable\nfor us to not have compassion or\ncuriosity about who's on the other side\nof the table like I wouldn't blame you\nfor a minute if you all said [ __ ] em all\nyou know I don't want to hear what they\nhave to say honestly I wouldn't blame\nyou and I think it's a real testament to\nyour own self-reflection your capacity\nfor compassion mercy curiosity and your\ndesire to make the world a better place\ninstead of just like punish people who\nhave hurt you because those are two very\ndifferent things and oftentimes we just\ndefault towards\nlet's punish the good and that's how the\nworld becomes a better place it's a very\nvery dangerous assumption that punishing\nthe good will fix the and it's one that\na lot of people make I'm not saying it's\nwrong I'm just saying it's like it's in\nthe sumption those are my thoughts any\nreflections on that\nwant to tell me how I'm a dumbass and\nnow's your chance\nI didn't hear anything I really disagree\nwith so welcome I'll try better next\ntime\nEddie last Lots for questions before we\nkind of wrap up for the day do feel like\nwe're in a good spot to wrap up or I\nmean if we've left something unsaid or\nnot talked about it I'd love to hear\nI can't think of anything okay so\nanybody want to share their discord IDs\nfor people to friend you after Street no\nso at the end of our sessions we usually\nyou know teach some kind of meditation\nand somehow that's pertinent to the\ndiscussion are y'all interested in\nlearning some meditation or doing some\nmeditation as a group sure now I'm\ntrying to figure out how to make this\npertinent because in all of my you know\nyears of studying in India they never\ntold me what meditation is good for\nwomen who deal with toxicity in gaming\nhow strange it's very bizarre because\nit's such a common topic you'd think\nthat Luther would have talked about it\nat some point\nokay so\nto think about it mm-hmm I think I'm\ngonna have to do something on the fly\nlet me just try to make it good instead\nof bad\nokay so what I'm kind of leaning towards\nthis could completely tank so apologies\nif it does because like I said and no\none ever taught me how to do this so\nwhat I'm actually leaning towards is\ndoing something like a mind body sort of\noriented meditation which is a little\nbit more exploratory so what I'd like to\nask you all to do is to think about some\nof these moments that you all have\nexperienced and then sort of in an open\nway it's gonna be kind of awkward and\nit'll take some time for us to kind of\nfind our rhythm but what I would love\nfor is if y'all could all sit up\nstraight and close your eyes and then\nI'm gonna ask you guys certain questions\nand then I want y'all to feel completely\nfine just sharing something whatever you\nfeel with and I'm gonna ask you a lot of\nstuff that's related to your physical\nsensations and so I'll ask you to recall\nthings and I'll ask you like what does\nthat feel like in your body and then I\ndon't know where we're gonna go from\nthere okay so sit up straight and y'all\ncan do this too\nand what we're gonna be listening for is\nsomething about the stories that you\nshare or the physical sensations that\nyou have and whether other people within\nthis group or people who are watching\nhave felt similar things so close your\neyes and sit up straight we're gonna\nstart by taking three breaths so deep\nbreath in\nand out\nin\nand out\nin\nand out\nstart by just feeling our body in its\ncurrent state\njust acknowledge that we've been talking\nfor a little while now and that the\nattention emotions humor concentration\nall of those things have had their\neffect on our body you may feel this\nlike a little bit of fatigue a little\nbit of sense of being spent\nI'll invite the group to just share any\nsensations they notice in their body\nmy jaw is tight\nnot it yeah noticing been number one\nokay\ntension\nmy feet and my the top of my head or I\ncan feel them more okay\nand so think a little bit about you know\nwhat are the feelings or things that\nwe've talked about that evoke tightness\nwithin your jaw frustration\nso what is frustration feel like in your\nbody\nlike tightening everything together to\nhold everything in yep and so now I want\nyou guys to think about the experiences\nthat you all have had which lead to you\nbeing frustrated\ntry to pick one and remember the way\nthat you had to tighten up you had to\nrestrain you had to hold that energy in\nyou couldn't be loose you couldn't be\nrelaxed\nwell as what are you experiencing rating\num I remembered something that was more\nphysical\nokay so remembered something that was\nmore physical and that I'm just gonna\nmake a couple of assumptions and we're\ngonna talk through that for a moment\nokay sometimes when things happen to you\nthat are physical they create a mental\nresponse and that's where everyone else\ncan jump in right so you've had certain\nthings that happen to you that create a\nmental response and then that mental\nresponse then triggers your body in\nparticular ways do you guys see that\nchain of mind to body\nwhether it be whether it's being called\nan attention [ __ ] or being told that\nyou can't send people emojis right with\nthat moment where you say I'm not going\nto use emojis anymore what did you feel\nin your body\nthat moment or someone called you out as\nan attention [ __ ] what did you feel\nwhen people started talking [ __ ] about\nyou behind your back\nand I want you to feel those sensations\nnow and if you feel like sharing them\nI'll be quiet for about 30 to 60 seconds\nand let you feel and share if you feel\ncomfortable I feel a little Hollow\nimages\nyou\nI feel tired I feel so exhausted I just\nwant to be okay\nyou\nmy skin is kind of like crawling and\npipe all of my exterior\nmy stomach hurts so now I want you to\nlisten to the other people who are\nspeaking and notice how you feel about\nthem\nwhat is it like hearing people feel\nhollow and that their skin is crawling\nand that their stomach is hurting how do\nyou feel towards them\nyou\nI want to give them a hug yeah\nright and there's some passion and also\nI want you to take a moment to try to\nacknowledge sadness\ntowards yourself and what you've been\nthrough\nthat happened to you that make you feel\nthis way that you feel exhausted and\nHollow\ntired\nthat things are a chore\nyou\nyou\nnow what we're gonna try to do is\n- how to give yourself a hug\nso I want you to have noticed that\nphysical sensation and find it in your\nbody and really just notice it try to\ntake a snapshot and now what I want you\nto do is take a deep breath in and push\nyour stomach out as you breathe in and\nthen as you breathe out pull your\nstomach back in\nwith an inhalation your stomach expands\nand with an exhalation your stomach\ncontracts\none more time\nand now add your chest the stomach\nexpands the chest expands and then\neverything relaxes\nbreathe in expand and relax\nnow slowly slowly continue\nand notice what's happening to your skin\nyour stomach\nthe pit in your stomach the hollowness\nin your chest\nlet it be there and also let it out let\ngo of it\nmake it up a little bit\nwhatever is in there let it come well\ndon't force it if it wants to stay let\nit stay\nit deserves to be there\nbut also as you have compassion for\nyourself recognize that you don't have\nto hold on to it not that you blame\nyourself that you may not be ready to\nlet it go completely but that you don't\nhave to hold on to it the way that you\nhappen\nthat you couldn't be yourself you\nhaven't been able to be yourself people\nhave put expectations on you burdens on\nyou pressures on you\nthen if you have the space for it hope a\nlittle bit because we live in a world\nwhere there's at least one discord\nserver where you can upload a selfie\nright and acknowledge that there's a\npart of you that's not gonna want to\nhope that says that it's not going to be\nenough and that this will continue\nforever and acknowledge that that part\nain't wrong as y'all started when you\nwere 12 or 13 and who knows how many\nyears that's been and that it sounds\nlike you've been hurt time and again and\nso hurt as a space it deserves to be\nthere with you\nand also you can let it go just in a\ntiny bit\nand now return to your breath\nfeel the breath go into the parts of\nyour body that hurt and then let the\nbreath come out\nlet yourself relax\nyourself process and let yourself let go\nyou\nwhen you're ready\ncome back to the group\ncome back to na'vi and lance and\nsemestre and Celaya megan and\nyou\nhow do y'all feel\nwas that better\nyou\nanybody not feel better you're allowed\nto not feel better\nI just feel tired me too\nyou know it's interesting because we\nthink about letting go is stopping to\nexert energy but letting go is\nexhausting\nalso I don't know what the [ __ ] that was\nbut people were responding very very\ndifferently hopefully it was helpful\nany last thoughts questions or\nreflections before we wrap up for the\nday do you all need time to process what\nwe just experienced because we can do\nthat if you want or we could just\nI'm okay thank you for having us\nthank you for coming thank you for\nhaving me you're welcome\nall right well take care and thank you\nthank you for being honest and\ncompassionate and sharing your point of\nview and I hope that you know the world\nbe a slightly less toxic place because\nyou all have come on today folks thank\nyou yes thank you thank you so much\nthank you okay\nweird huh whoo exactly what's going on\nthere but seem to be good so\nlet's think a little bit about yeah\nthoughts reflections questions from\ny'all thinkin about it would y'all think\nit's that helpful a good stream\nyou\nyou\nman it easy huh so here dude dudes on\nthe Internet are so weird I don't\nunderstand them at all\nI really don't very confusing yeah\nyeah you know so someone's asking\nto know just how bad the community is\nfor so many people makes me want to\ntackle the issue head-on but what to do\nI mean I'd say that like you can write\nso like don't over white knight it so I\nthought that was a really important\ndistinction don't over white knight it\nbut like if you see someone being an\n[ __ ] in a game of yours just be like\nhey man like do you have to be an\n[ __ ] like not trying to be an [ __ ]\nmyself but like can you be like you know\nif you're having a rough day that's cool\nif you're frustrated by the game that's\ncool too\nif you want to be mad at someone that's\nfine but like you have to be so mean can\nyou be a little bit less me and just\ncall people out for it right or if\nsomeone is mean to someone else in a\ngame like be like hey you know like you\ncan you know so I just think a little\nbit about dota so you know sometimes\nyou know if I'm especially like if I'm\nwinning a game of dota like at the end\npeople will be like yeah this guy's\ncomplete trash like this guy on my team\nis complete trash and I'm the guy who's\nwinning the game right so at that point\nI'm like hey like the dudes just like\nplayed the best that he could sometimes\nwe all have bad games like I crushed at\nthis game but sometimes I'm the trash in\nthe game can we just like maybe let\npeople slide because they don't always\nhave the best game and I think the issue\nI don't know if you guys kind of got\nthis but like the issue is that like\nevery game there are chances of people\nbeing [ __ ] and so what you can do is\njust like not be an [ __ ] or call it\nout or try to be nice and one day in\ngame\nand what if like the games that we\nplayed had a chance of having like an\nagenda in lis like good and supportive\nperson in the game\nlike what if that happened to every game\nyou guys just think about the games that\nyou play and how many people tend to be\nlike understanding and supportive of\neach other when they do a bad job very\nfew but you could be that person and how\nmany people does it take to turn the\ntide I'm not sure but I think that each\nand every one of us as gamers has\nresponsibilities to be like try to be a\ndecent person when you are having a bad\nday or when people are playing a bad\ngame or even if you're toxic try say I\nknow this sounds really really bizarre\nbut over the course of the game maybe\nyou can apologize maybe you can say hey\nguys I'm sorry like I just got super\nfrustrated and tilted I didn't mean to\ntake it out on you all it's crazy crazy\njust try to be nice to people and\nplaying video games\nokay anyway so on Wednesday we have\nkaceytron and then on Friday we have\nMichael Reaves you know we really\nappreciate all y'all's support and it's\nreally great that y'all are when the\nsoda pop in common I don't know man\nokay so we're gonna go ahead and Andrade\nAnita thank you all for coming"
