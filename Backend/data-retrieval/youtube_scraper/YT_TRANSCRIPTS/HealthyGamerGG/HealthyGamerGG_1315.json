    "transcript": "last time I talked to you you you went\nby Raj mm-hm and just a little bit\ncurious about what prompted the change\nwell I I had a there's just like a\ntremendous amount of people that I mean\nI don't know exactly how many people but\nthere are a lot of people that felt like\nthat it was like they're very\nproblematic and offensive um and I know\nthat there was other people that like\ndidn't and I I mean I spoke with you and\nI you said that you know like oh it's\njust the internet but I didn't want to\nleave any real like reason for those\npeople within my community to feel like\nthey were excluded because of that\noffense and to be completely honest like\nhe didn't make sense anyway like I was\ndoing I was me I was Who I am you know\ndidn't really make any sense so I wanted\nto move on yeah cool man I just want to\nreiterate that like like I said to you I\nwasn't defendant as an Gujarati Indian\nso your name is Ravi or your name sir\nyou know I grew up around uh in a\npredominantly Indian community like with\na lot of Indian friends but I felt like\nthat didn't justify my use of the name\nand such so like I just I wanted to you\nknow apologize to those who that that\nthat were personally affected or\nimpacted and just sort of move on from\nit oh and by the way start about the\nbandaid on my forehead I uh it's not as\nit but it's a I got a biopsy from a wart\nthat I had so no judgment\nyeah and just just about that for a\nsecond so I won't actually like say I\nappreciate like even though I wasn't\npersonally offended I really appreciate\nthe change and the reason is because\nfirst of all like I know I did and said\na lot of things I don't know when you\ncame up with the name but like you know\nwhen I was 19 I did a lot of stupid and\noffensive stuff and I think it's like\nimportant to you know change and grow\nand I can totally get you know where\nyou're coming from in terms of sort of\nsaying like even though it doesn't\nbother some people and like you know is\nit offensive is it not offensive just\nlike you know just change and then the\nother thing is that I think that a lot\nof times people\nlooked figures like streamers and even\nthough the streamer may not be doing\nsomething that's like completely out of\nline it gives their audience license to\ndo things that are more out of line yeah\nI mean in we yeah it's it's it's sort of\none of those things I mean you know as\nyou say I mean I've gone through\ntremendous progression in my own life my\npersonal life my professional life you\nknow I came out this past year as gay or\nmostly gay as I say because sexuality is\ncomplex and you know it's I've realized\nthat there's just a journey and you know\nwhen I first started experimenting with\nmy sexuality at that moment I was like\nnobody's ever gonna know this is a phase\nyou know that sort of thing so you know\nI've just been on this sort of journey\nover the last bit of time and it's I'm\nhappy you know but it it sucks you know\nyou make mistakes and it sucks but yeah\nI hate that I I'll be honest you know I\nhate that I I like I don't want to say I\nhate myself but like I'm just like god\nwhat a [ __ ] loser you were you know\nlike what no I'm I'm I'm with you man I\nmean I think that's actually like what I\nreally respect about what you're doing\nis because like we all make mistakes and\nlike somewhere along the way it became\nokay to not make mistakes you know yeah\nand and not to say that it is like it\ndoesn't justify the behavior but I think\nthe most important thing to remember is\nthat like humans human beings aren't\nborn perfect and ultimately what I look\nfor and and what Garner's my respect is\nlike someone's ability to look into\ntheir past and say hey like I did this\nthen and I didn't know any better and\nnow I do so I'm gonna change and I think\noften times you know people will just\nlike judge people for being idiots which\nis sort of fair because you were an\nidiot and like so I get that but at the\nend of the day you know I think that we\nshould also respect people who are\nwilling to like change the way that they\nthink and take a step forward because\nand I've been thinking about this a lot\nlike I don't know how what kind of role\nmodels we have on the Internet and and I\nthink a lot of what we see is because\nlike we don't have people don't know\nlike what good looks like and I just\nthink well it sure I can bandaid on the\nforehead I can tell you that what are we\ntalking about today\nwe're talking about we're talking about\nanxiety culture dog I almost called you\nmr. Kay that's cool since you're a\ndoctor no I mean I'm not a foe okay yes\nI know mr. mr. dr. kay people call me\ndr. show which is not not accurate I'm\nnot a doctor I don't want and show isn't\nmy last name I don't know where that\ncame from but I changed my channel name\nto Austin show and people call me mr.\nand dr. show so that's a doctor I am not\noffended by you being called doctor I\nthink it's just except I can change them\ncan we page one into dr. show is that\nwhat I can do\nyeah I mean the only thing is I would\nconsult with an attorney to make sure\nthat your audience understands that\nyou're not a real doctor but as a\npersonal doctor an Indian person I have\nnot been personally offended by either\nof those okay I mean there are all kinds\nof people calling them doctors all kinds\nof [ __ ] yeah that's okay yeah\nso it's ironic doctor get yeah then I'm\nanxious to talk about anxiety it's\nactually kind of fitting but yeah most\ngreat you be open and open and\ntransparent with it and I think that\nmaybe I'm sure there's a lot of people\nthat can relate with anxiety in the chat\nbut as we go through the course of our\nconversation they'll probably understand\nwhy sure yeah so you want to just start\nthere like why are you anxious to talk\nabout anxiety um I think I think anxiety\nand and sort of like you know mental\nhealth in general is a very personal\nintimate thing I guess not I feel like\nit's something that definitely needs to\nbe talked about because it's a it's a\nproblem that that so many people deal\nwith and I think the solution is talking\nabout it and and sort of being open\nabout open about your emotions and\nfeelings but I just think that like the\nanxiety from talking about it xiety is\nlike sort of like the idea of like being\nfeeling vulnerable and talking about\nthings that are just you know\nthings that are personal to you that you\ndon't really talk about because you sort\nof put on like a rough exterior is a\npersonality that like you you are\nexpected to sort of be more than or like\nabove you know what I mean\nwhat are you expected to be well I mean\nI don't know if the expectation is like\nexactly set forth like specifically but\nI feel like I'm expected to sort of be\nperfect in some regard and Marcus sort\nof held to a higher standard which I\nunderstand why that would be the case\nyou know given that I think we are held\nto a higher standard and rightfully so\nwe have a lot of influence and so we\nshould be held to a higher standard but\nbut yeah but like but still despite that\nI still am a human being and I have\nthese emotions and everything so it's\nvery complicated sorry I don't know if I\nanswered your question\nyeah I mean I think you answered it\nreally well I think you know it's kind\nof interesting it's like I don't know\nwhen we started holding different humans\nto different standards like if that's\nactually good like so yeah like if\nyou're a streamer you shouldn't be an\n[ __ ] but if you're in twitch at like\nit's okay to be a racist [ __ ] you\nknow it's kind of interesting it's like\neveryone says like it's the standard\nthing that everyone says like oh like I\nyou know I should be he'll do it like\nI'm held too high like why why can't we\nhold like why can't we expect everyone\nto be decent human beings yeah it's a\nit's a good point\nI mean I've come to the conclusion that\nwe including myself as everybody's a\nlittle bit of a hypocrite yeah you know\nthat's the board like if you if you\nevaluate everybody's life holistically\nis that the right word dr. K I'm in I'm\nin an intellectual environment you're a\ndoctor because the right word let me\nlook tell me man\nholistically I don't know what you're\ntrying to say so I don't know if it's\nthe right word I was just like trying to\nsay over overall like look sure whole\npicture sounds like everybody's life\nlike on the whole picture I I think you\nwould find that everybody is a hypocrite\neverybody yeah hundred Britain of the\npeople are hypocritical sure to some\ndegree I mean if you really look at it\nthat sort of thing but yeah yeah cool I\nmean I don't know where I was gonna I\nit's just interesting cuz I hear this\nline a lot that everyone like you know I\nshould be held to a higher standard than\nother people and I feel that way too\nlike I feel like I have to be held to a\nhigher standard but then like there are\nother parts of me that like why do other\npeople get a pass why can't we hold\neveryone to the same standard isn't that\nreally what equality is like and and I\nalso think that sometimes what I see is\nthat actually people hold streamers to\nunfair standards\nyou know cuz I I feel like yeah I mean\nwhat do you mean in particular I mean\njust just like you know so if we just\nlisten to some of what you started\nsaying you were kind of saying like I\nfeel like I have to maintain an exterior\nright you feel like you have to maintain\nsomething you feel like maybe other\npeople are allowed to feel\nwhereas on some level you may not be or\nyou may not feel as allow to feel right\nand unclear whether you're actually\nallowed or not allowed but like let me\ngive me an example of like in the the\nexterior portion and how that's\ncommunicated to the audience because I\nthink maybe that people might not\nunderstand exactly where I'm coming from\nlet's say I'm like going through like a\nlike a serious like mental health\nbreakdown or something like you know and\nlike I need to like I alway take out a\nshow I like cancel the show I sometimes\ndon't feel well in sometimes I'll be\nlike hey I'm going through a rough patch\nand I'll explain that but other times I\nfeel like I can't really say like hey\nthe reason I acted this way B was\nbecause I was anxious because people\nlike oh yeah nice excuse or something\nlike that or the reason I was like you\nknow doing this or whatever is because I\nwas anxious people you know I feel like\nthat it's just it's just an excuse or\nwhatever so you feel judged yeah I mean\ncertainly I mean yeah of course yeah\nsome degree for being human yeah but\nlook I mean III also want to say that\nI'm extremely extraordinarily blessed to\nbe in the position that I'm in and like\nI feel like you know the the the the\npros of this oh hold on hold on a second\nAustin yeah hold on okay this is weird\nso I'm okay why not so I said do you\nfeel judged for being human and what was\nyour response to go to basically say\nthat I'm not human yep right like\nbasically to basically be like yeah\nyou're just human and then like think of\nit as sort of like an excuse that you\nsaid like I thought you saying that was\ngiving me an excuse it's weird right so\nso I said hey man you're allowed to be\nhuman and you said but I'm blessed\nand there's a saddle there's a subtle\nthere's a subtle there's of something\nvery insidious there which I like really\nwant to point out like I could be wrong\nabout this by the way yeah it's weird\nright like I'm saying Austin you're\nallowed to be human and you're basically\nsaying in your response I didn't even\nlet you finish I'm sure you would have\nsaid something but I just want you to\nnotice what your mind did is you talked\nabout the privilege and why does someone\nlike talking about the privilege that\nyou've been given in life sort of in\nthat moment invalidates like your\ncapacity to be upset or hurt or whatever\nI see this a lot with like privileged\npeople where they almost like invalidate\nlike that's that's the standard that you\nhold yourself to you see that it's like\nyou're not letting yourself be like a\nhuman and and you know somebody else is\na twitch streamer and they say yeah like\nyou know life is hard you're gonna be\nlike but you're blessed that's that's\nnot what you say to them you're like\nyeah man like you deserve to be have a\nrough life too like even if you're a\ntrick streamer like it's cool but it\ncomes with a lot of pressure but when\nyou think about yourself you're like oh\nbut I'm blessed it's almost like it's\nlike a party line that you have to say\nto like not feel like an [ __ ]\nbasically it's like I feel because and I\nfeel like that has to something to do\nwith the culture sort of like of our of\nour industry in general just culture in\ngeneral I think that people that and I\neven feel guilty even talking about this\nbecause like I feel like people are\ngonna be reacting the same way but\ncelebrity types and I'm not a celebrity\nbut you know I get people with influence\nand large audiences I feel like the\nstigma is like oh you make a lot of\nmoney you're fine like you're good let's\ntalk about that guilt what makes you\nfeel guilty like about like being\nprivileged yeah\num I don't know IIIi don't necessarily\nfeel guilty about like being privileged\nperson yeah I just feel like I can't\ncommunicate my feelings without being\njudged about them if that makes sense\nthat makes so like I feel like I have\ntremendous privilege but I don't want\npeople to conflate is that the right\nword dr k i'm using big words here\nconfession basically sir to conflate\nwhat does conflate mean it means mix up\nmix up okay good I'm happy I'm using\nthese words correctly I don't want\npeople to conflate me talking about my\nemotions and feelings as me not being\nappreciative of the privileged position\nthat I'm in and I feel like often if I\nwere to talk about some of the things\nthat I feel like my anxious thoughts or\nfeelings and it might not be rational I\nfeel like maybe people would be like wow\nthis guy's complaining when he drives a\nLambo and I don't drive a Lambo dr. K\nthat's just a meme but um like oh this\nguy's got a this guy's got a great life\nyou know like why is he complaining\nabout anything at all you know so I try\nto keep any complaining about anything\nto a minimum base yeah so let me ask you\nsee what's happening to me but ya know\nto to I just close twitch at a little\nwhile ago cuz I can't I like reading it\nactually I don't know why I just like\nmaybe I mean I like it too it's just it\nmaybe I'm like a masochist I really\nreading sorry Chet Austin two thoughts\nokay okay first is just think about you\nknow what it like you're saying like\nthere's a part of you that says and I'm\nnot saying this part is wrong I'm just\nsaying like let's look at it okay we\ncould talk about your anxiety at some\npoint if you want to yeah this is all\nconnected right it's okay I think so so\nif you know there's a part of you that\nbasically says like you're not allowed\nto complain right like you're and like\nI've seen that before and bizarrely like\nI'm not trying to draw a connection here\nit's just it's just weird because like\nreally I hear this kind\ndialogue in abusive relationships people\ninvalidate their own viewpoint and they\nsay I'm not allowed to suffer because\ndot-dot-dot are you saying dr. K I'm in\nan abusive relationship with my audience\nthere's conflation my friend you\nunderstand no it's a reasonable\nconclusion because I said that these\nteeth I'm just saying like it's not\nimportant out an observation I actually\ndon't know what it means\nyeah but I mean like I see this sort of\nidea that like oh I'm not allowed to\ncomplain right and like it's fair in a\nsense right that like you should be\ngrateful for your privilege and you\nshould be grateful that you have things\nthat other people don't have and I I do\nbelieve that like I kind of agree with\nthis guy Gautam Buddha Buddha then you\nknow suffering is like a part of life\nand that there's no human that is not\ngoing to experience suffering or is\nentitled to experience suffering do I\nthink that all people experience the\nsame amount of suffering no but I don't\nthink that like gatekeeping suffering is\nlike a way forward because that leads to\nall this weird toxic [ __ ] like you know\none-upmanship and like invalidation of\nother feelings and like you know just I\njust don't think that that's all thing\nthe second thing is are you alright like\nyou can keep on asking me about like\nusing language properly or like are you\nconcerned about being perceived as like\nnot intelligent no I don't care it's\nactually joking yeah sort of a meme or\njoke okay okay I'm just I actually don't\nreally mind being like perceived as an\nidiot okay okay I I think sometimes\nmaybe like it would get to me but I mean\noh like I don't really care too much\nlike it doesn't really bother me that\nmuch okay about being like perceived as\nit is an absolute [ __ ] because I think\ngenerally twitchchat across the board\nthinks we're all stupid like and it's\nsort of like a fun loving way sure um\nyeah I don't think I'm stupid I don't\nhave like a okay good like like a\ncomplex where I feel like I'm stupid you\nknow can I ask you just one more\nquestion about that go ahead yeah would\nit be okay if you did have a cop\nit's about feeling stupid yes I think\nhold on wait let me think about that\nquestion um yeah I suppose so I guess\nwhat I don't know if they're it's sort\nof like I guess that's the way you feel\nright um but it's not like something\nthat I like maybe like there's isolated\nmoments like because I think we all have\nthese right we all have like these\nmoments where like is is broadcasters\nlike maybe we're being serious about\nsomething and they'd we don't want to be\njoking in that moment and then they then\nmaybe we take it more personally but it\nto me it's not like I get off stream I'm\nlike oh god they think I'm so dumb I'm\nnot actually um you know I don't have\nthat problem it doesn't bother me at all\nokay okay cool thanks for answering that\nI appreciate it now I do have a problem\nwith with with the saying like a lot but\nI'm dealing with it what do you mean by\nthat\nyeah so let's talk about anxiety let's\ntalk about it so what it what do you\nmean by anxiety um that's a good\nquestion really making me think here\nwhat do I mean by anxiety the way I\ndefine anxiety is just sort of like the\nthe physiological response to events out\nof my personal control so let's say I'm\ngoing on an airplane\nmy mind will immediately go to the\nworst-case scenario that could possibly\nhappen I get on the plane I'm in a\nseconds to disaster movie next thing you\nknow we're going down it's over on a you\nknow because in the call and and and for\nsome reason my mind it's hard for me to\nexplain this but my mind will go to the\nworst-case scenario of anything like\nlet's say I'm going I went on a trip I\nwent out of town like last week and I\ndrove I drove to this this town in in in\na different state and on that drive you\ngo through a mountain pass and through\nthat mountain pass you are that you are\ngoing through periods of places where\nyou are going to like get there's like\noncoming traffic or whatever that you\ncould you could cross over the there's\nno median you could cross over and\ncoming to a head-on collision and so\nevery time I Drive up there the thought\nin my head is oh my gosh that could\nhappen to me I need to be so careful and\nthen I get anxious about it like oh my\ngosh what what if I get in this head-on\ncollision like I'm gonna draw I'm gonna\nmove and so as I Drive up there I like\nI'm like during this part of the drive\nI'm like holding the wheel very tightly\nhugging the right side just in case and\nlike especially when cars like come the\nother way and like just making sure that\nand part of that's being just safe is\nthe driver and be sort of wheelchair but\nbut part of that's like irrational like\nof course yes that's a possibility to\nhappen but is that really rational and\nand why would I get worked up about it I\nhave no idea in even no matter how often\nI\ngo through this it just for some reason\nand like try to justify it and know that\nit's like crazy I still have these crazy\nthoughts of the worst case scenario\nworst possible thing that can happen so\nso yeah thank you so much for sharing\nthat I think it's a beautiful picture of\nanxiety can I collect my thoughts for a\nsecond yes please go ahead\nyou\nhow old are you Austin 26\nyou\nyou\nokay\ngonna need another like maybe like a\nminute I'm just coming up with a plan to\nkind of think through and approach this\nwith you\nyou\nokay how long have you been having these\nthoughts\nsince I can remember\n[Music]\nsince I was younger how young gosh it's\ngotten worse with age I'd say okay\nbut I'd say like\nprobably I can't really remember to be\nhonest just very early I sort of had\nlike the inclination but it yeah okay so\ndo you remember what thinly like paint\nus a picture of what used to worry about\nlike as a kid\nis a kid\nI would worry about they wouldn't be the\nsame so I mean sort of similar things\nlike for example you know around like\nthe the I don't know I'm just trying to\nthink of something random from my\nchildhood that I like what one time I if\nit's a lot of this has to do with planes\nwhich is ironic because I used to want\nto be a commercial airline pilot and I\nstill have a passion for aviation but\nthis one time like I was like getting on\na plane and I had like a complete mental\nlike breakdown and like anxiety attack I\nwas with my mom we were on like a soccer\ntrip and I saw like a box board the\nplane right just like unlike like a box\nit was like all taped up and weird and\njust stuff and immediately my mind went\ntoo you know because this was like 2000s\nyou know and you know and I was like\nimmediately my mind went to oh [ __ ] like\nwe're gonna go like it's it's gonna like\nthis is it like that's that's a\nsuspicious package it's gonna it's gonna\nyou know something's gonna happen\nthat there's something in there that's\ngonna take the plane down or something\nand I like panicked and just like I\ndidn't want to board the plane at all of\ncourse we ended up boarding and is fine\nright but that was where my brain went\nokay so there's something weird there so\nlike you said your brain is like it's a\nsuspicious package and the plane is\ngonna go down yeah wondering that not\nmore like it's weird that's what's in\nthe package that's what I was thinking\nit was probably the likely scenario is\nin which it was it was just some package\nfilled with some stuff nano but but why\ncan't she use the word bomb I I don't\nknow that because I don't know is that\nwhat she thought was in the package yeah\nI thought it was some sort of explosive\nyeah so it's just weird because like\neven now as you tell the story like you\nknow I would imagine that if I had\nanxiety mm-hmm and like because we all\nknow you're talking about a bomb yeah\nbut you're not using the word bomb it's\njust strange\nIIIi don't know\nyeah yeah I I don't know exactly what to\nmake of that observation but like it's\nalmost\nthere's like a Voldemort aspect to it\nwhere if you like you know speaking its\nname is like somehow I don't know it\njust feels weird like it feels like kind\nof like avoidant to use the like you're\nnot trying to use the like you're trying\nto say it without using the word bomb\nwhich I don't know what the significance\nof that is but it certainly seems to be\nlike a bear I mean yeah I don't know\nmaybe I don't know exactly why do you\nsee what I'm saying though yeah I get it\nyeah so so I mean it's just like we\ndon't have to understand everything\nlet's just make observations then we'll\nshort out you know whether there's some\nkind of like avoidance yeah or does it\nmake you feel silly to use that word\nyeah well it sort of makes me feel silly\nthat I even thought that if that makes\nsense yes it just silly that I even\nthought that would be the case so you're\ndodging yeah you're judging yourself for\nyour irrational words and so like maybe\nspeaking irrational words like makes\nyour thoughts sort of more real and like\nthe silliness increases right because it\nis so silly because dr. K this was a\nflight that if I can remember in\nparticular was like a 25-minute flight\nlike from it was like literally like a\nflight it like rationally it doesn't\nmake sense you know it just first of all\nit never made sense but like just the\nidea that this random flight would be\nthe target of something like it just\ndoesn't there's no rationale period from\nany in anything but like it was just so\nstupid to even think of that in that\nparticular situation okay so you\nsometimes I'm not so sure I agree with\nthat but we'll oh you don't think it's\nrational we'll get there mate okay okay\nso let me ask you this like so you\nbasically think about your it sounds\nlike your anxiety is mostly thinking\nabout catastrophic very low likelihood\nscenarios actually right right which I\nthink yeah but I think I don't know does\neverybody think like that or in in the\nsense that like they think of the\nworst-case scenario I think the thing\nfor me is I will obsess over it for sure\nlike I will obsess over to lose sleep\nover it I won't eat you know I can't\nsleep as soon it like for example when I\ngo on long flights\nI won't I cannot\nat all just because for the reason that\nI'm afraid that if I go to sleep I'm\ngonna wake up to everybody around me\nscreaming and if I let my personal guard\ndown it's just what might hate thought\nmy brain goes if I let my personal guard\ndown then something's gonna happen if I\nrelax something's gonna happen if I stop\nI'm not oh no what happened when you did\nlet your personal guard down\nnothing nothing when I relax nothing I\nmean nothing's happened I don't think is\nthere anything and so now we got to be\ncareful because I suspect that so we're\nrunning up against an enemy here which\nis your judgment that's gonna make it\nhard for you to speak right so has\nsomething happened to you that feels\nsuper irrational where you let your\nguard down and something catastrophic\nhappen to you as a result\nI can't think of like anything in\nparticular\nokay where that was a case can you tell\nme you'll go ahead sorry\ngo ahead no you go ahead go ahead can\nyou just tell me a little bit about your\nupbringing yeah sure\nwhat about it what do you want to know\njust where did you grow up what was that\nlike um I grew up in I don't I don't\ngeographical stuff is like irrelevant\nbut on the west coast or dinner state of\nOregon I had a pretty good\nI had a stable upbringing there was no\nreal issues can you tell me about your\nparents\nyeah married like they were I love my I\nlove my mom and dad they they've been\nlike you know extremely you know support\nof me throughout and provided me with\nthe tools I feel like that have created\nthe person that I am today so and who's\nthe person that you are today\nwell I mean I feel like you know\nobviously as anybody I've made mistakes\nand done things but I feel like I feel\nlike I'm a good person you know I feel\nlike I try to do the right thing I feel\nlike I've made mistakes but you know I\nfeel like yeah I feel like that that's\nwho I am\nare they proud of you Austin yeah yeah\nthey are they tell me that they are so\ndo you feel like they're proud of you I\nknow they are yeah I do\nhow does that feel it feels good it\nfeels really good it feels good to know\nthat you know and I have a hard time\nsort of communicating that sort of thing\nto them or you know I like about hard\ntime communicating emotions sometimes or\nwhatever but sure you know I am yeah\nvery sorry I'm getting yeah I get it\nyeah anyway\nwhat about telling for no no nothing\njust getting sort of like crying I guess\nI don't know what's wrong with that\nnothing nothing I think I think we\nshould be do you feel like something is\nwrong with it I think this is just like\nthis whole issue of like being judged\nI guess it's we goes back to the root of\nthe conversation sure being judged so\nthis is like not okay you can't feel\nthis this is not what this is you know I\nguess it goes back to that yeah it does\nwhat does that feel like it doesn't feel\ngood cuz I want it I want to share\nbecause I feel like there's people that\nrelate but I just feel like because of\nwho we like I like like the the the\ninfluence that I have I sort of have to\nput on a happy face and just you know\nwhat I mean yeah so here's what I'm\nhearing from you awesome you're not\nallowed to\nyeah it's not like I feel like I'm not a\nlike I feel like I'm not allowed to\nexpress myself in this particular way\nand again there I go my mind just went\nto like a justification like to try to\nclear up like my mind at that moment\nwhen you said that my mind went to I\ndon't feel this way all the time and I\nactually don't really feel like I'd even\nneed to talk about it\nlike it's just this is just like we're\ntalking about things that happen and\nit's not even a big deal and I you know\nthat's where my mind went\nyeah that's hurt what even in the\ncontext of a place where we're talking\nabout this sort of thing yeah so it's\nalso weird because like you almost said\nthat you're not allowed to be happy I\nmean sorry you're not allowed to because\nwe've been talking about you don't have\nthe right to be sad or suffer and yet\nthat part of you that self judgmental\nand doesn't allow you to actually pops\nup when you're expressing gratitude\nappreciation and good feelings but you\nstill feel like you're not allowed to\nlike you see that's weird\neven the rational justification for why\nyou're not allowed to feel props off\nwhen it doesn't even apply which is like\nare you not allowed to say that like you\nsay I'm privileged but what you just\nshowed us is your privilege in its\npurest and you know highest form which\nis that like I had a stable household\nwith parents who loved me and they're\nproud of me\nwhich is like something that not much of\nour not many people in our audience have\nyeah and yet you know you still feel\nlike like when you you can say the words\nI'm privileged but you can't show it to\npeople right it's weird yeah I want to I\nwant to highlight something because I\ndon't know if this is the case it is\nI was about my upbringing because\nand I don't know if this is the root\ncause of anything because I've done some\nself-reflection like on things like that\nto try to clear psychoanalyze myself you\nknow and think and I'm trying to like\nwonder if growing up my mom is a\ntremendous mother like she was\ntremendous and and in you know was\nawesome\nthroughout one thing she did do is she\nscared the ever littie ever living [ __ ]\nout of me about things drugs you know\ngoing making sure that you're you know\nyou're not crossing the street and in a\ncertain place or like making sure you're\nbeing safe about that where you know\nvery much stressing you know wear a\nhelmet and those are like common things\nright but like almost to like a like\nvery much like if you don't you like\nsomething negative will happen to you\nsort of thing like like something\nnegative will happen and I don't know\nwhat the association with is but I do do\nlike like for example I hope people are\ngonna laugh but I I don't do drug I do I\nsmoke marijuana right but that's the\nonly that's the you know it's the only\nthing that I do that's like a drug and\neven that it took me till I was about\neight nineteen years old to even try\nthat because I was terrified of even\nthat but I don't drink and when I say\ndon't drink it's like I don't like I\nhave maybe a drink every once in a while\nbut it's very rare um I've been drunk\nI've not like I have anything against\ndrinking but those are things that I\nfeel like I growing up I was told you\nknow basically not the drinking part as\nmuch but more like the drugs part not to\ndo and so I'm absolutely terrified\nthat's probably a good thing but I don't\nknow\nso Austin let me ask you something so\nyou offered this you said I\npsychoanalyze myself my mom used to your\nwords were scare the other living [ __ ]\nout of you yeah how do you think thats\nrelated to your anxiety well I think\nthat like my mom would describe things\nthat the way that I think of it and it's\nweird like when I'm conscious of this\nbut I still have this the reaction you\nknow but the way that my mom would\ndescribe things like let's say that\nthere was a you know like let's say the\nthe helmet thing right\nthey I don't know she would go to\ndescribe just like the traumatic brain\ninjury that I that could be sustained\noff of that or the drug related thing\nlike you it just takes one time and\nhere's a situation where this person\ndied you know instantly and they were\njust they were just like you and they\njust died you know and I feel like all\nthese things as a mother I don't blame\nher for telling me in these particular\nsituations because obviously it\nprevented me from doing drugs for enemy\nfrom wearing a helmet but like I wonder\nif there is certain situations where it\nwas the the maybe it like sort of went\nmy mind sort of just goes to everything\nthat I do to the worst-case scenario and\nI don't know if that's true or not I'm\njust sort of wondering if that had\nanything to do with it cuz I don't know\nwhere this comes from and what do you\nthink I don't know I just lot summer had\ncome from I have no idea okay I don't\nknow where they come from\nyes I'm not trying to blame her for see\nthere my mind went again I'm not trying\nto blame her it's not her fault you know\nthat's I get try to so be careful would\nyou be okay blaming her if it was her\nfault because I love my mom I don't\nthink that it would be her intention to\ndo something like that you know to like\ncause me nice dogs used Boston blame has\nsuch like a negative connotation it\ndoesn't like blame like she did\nsomething horribly wrong like she's a\nterrible person for that or something\nlike that but that to me that's not the\ncase like I don't want people to think\nthat if I say my mother it's my mother's\nfault as for that there's conflation\nright so so like like let me put it this\nway so I'm with you that the word blame\ncarries a bad connotation is it possible\nfor her to be responsible without you\nblaming her yeah I think so\nup yeah certainly if we just talk about\nit like straight up here if something\nthat she did I guess it could be\nresponsible whether what she did was\nso yeah there I go again dr. K trying to\ngo for it say it say that what but like\nif what she was doing was wrong was it\nwrong or was it just how I became like\nis is is doing those things or saying\nthose things is that inherently wrong or\nis it just like something that just was\na sort of like an unfortunate that my\nbrain just happened to work this way and\nmaybe she was saying it to the wrong kid\nbasically you know so give me a second\nand then I will have I believe I may\nhave answers for you okay okay sure and\nthat too could be a mistake because like\nwell let me say I have hypotheses yep\nsure yep okay\noh wow\nyou\nI mean so awesome let me ask you\nsomething sure do you think that you're\nanxious because your mom scared the ever\nliving [ __ ] out of you on a relatively\nconstant basis\nyou\nmy true answer is I don't know I don't\nknow if that was the case I've just I'd\nsort of came across my mind I feel like\nit's a possibility I feel like what what\ndoes it feel what does it feel like the\nanswer is I'm not asking for the right\nanswer I'm asking for the visceral\nanswer and if the answer is I don't know\nthat's fine it were truly is doctor I\ndon't know that's what uh in my mind I\nfeel like it's a potential that\ncontributed but I don't believe that it\nwould be 100% okay the reason but maybe\nit will kind of tendril i I think I I'm\nwith you a hundred percent and I would\nagree with that 100% I don't think it's\neverything I think it's a potential\ncontributor so let's just talk for a\nsecond about where thoughts come from so\nI know it's kind of like a basic\nquestion but generally speaking thoughts\ncome from experiences right like I don't\nstart thinking about unicorns until like\nI see unicorns like I don't start you\nknow you don't you can't fall in love\nwith a girl or guy that you've never\nseen or met right like it's kind of\nsimple but like you know you can't want\nto eat a hamburger until you like see it\nor smell it or like see pictures of it\nor see your friends eating it like the\nthoughts in our mind are generated from\ngenerally speaking our experiences the\nother thing is like the things that our\nmind learns how to do it learns from\nlike some pretty common sources and at\nthe top of the list or parents right so\nlike if I'm you know if I say please and\nthank you then it's gonna be like\nsomething that my mind automatically\ngenerates based on the way that I was\nraised if I'm a racist [ __ ] that also\nis gonna probably be related to the way\nthat I was raised right like if you look\nat like I grew up in East Texas where\nyou know there were a lot of racist\npeople and I was kind of racist - I'm\nstill sorta racist like it's so in in me\nI can feel it I try to like but like I\nwas raised in a particular way you know\nlike think about\npeople in a particular way and oddly\nenough like some of my racism is towards\nlike white people because I grew up with\npeople that I used to call rednecks\nright and so I was like these guys are\non culture like that's actually still\nracist you get that like you know I'm\njudging the class of people based on the\ncolor of their skin or where they come\nfrom and I make assumptions about them\nand and so the first thing to understand\nis like in my experience anxiety comes\nfrom two places so the first thing is\nit's not irrational like we think it's\nirrational because when we judge the\nthought we're like that's not going to\nhappen but what is completely rational\nis that our mind is going to generate\nour mind doesn't generate irrational\nthoughts it generates thoughts as best\nas it knows how and even off in the\nobjective manner of truth those thoughts\nare irrational like you can say that you\nknow like let's just talk about sexual\nassault for a moment so like when\nsomeone is sexually assaulted they feel\nlike a bad person and I'll give you just\na very visceral but like I think this is\nthe truest example this when a child is\nsexually assaulted so back when kids are\ngrowing up they don't have something\ncalled theory of mind which means that\nthey don't understand that other human\nbeings exist literally their brain has\nnot developed the capacity to understand\nthat like other human beings exist\nthey're like they're super narcissistic\nlike a kid when it's hungry doesn't\nunderstand that like a parent is busy or\nlike has a phone call they just know\nthat I'm hungry and like there's no food\nand they get upset they're like the only\nactor and then over time they developed\nsomething called theory of mind and\ntheir theory of mind gets like really\nreally good when they hit teenage years\nand that's why people become so socially\nanxious as teenaged because they're like\noh [ __ ]\nother people exist and they have\nopinions about me and what I do affects\nthe way that they think about me does\nthat make sense like like a 7 year old\njust isn't really I'm concerned with\nlike what people think generally ok yeah\noh so so imagine if you're the only\nperson in the world and you get sexually\nassaulted whose fault is it\nif you're the only person in the world\nand you get sexually assaulted by\nyourself it's your fault\nabsolutely you're the only person in the\nworld yeah so like when you have a four\nyear old that gets sexually assaulted\nthey feel like it's their fault\nthey feel like they're bad people right\nin it's bizarre because it's sort of\nlike when I'm learning and that's\nevolutionary it's like when I'm learning\nto walk and I fall down and I'm two\nyears old whose fault is it it that's so\ninteresting I've never even thought of\nit that way ever\nyeah it's shock in it because because a\nlot of people don't understand I'm like\nhow could that be your fault sort of\nyeah but that's what they say like if\nyou talk to them like everyone knows\nthat victims of sexual assault blame\nthemselves and what we all tell them is\nit's not your fault but they feel like\nit's their fault right so like where the\n[ __ ] does that come from and then we say\nlike and then they feel even stupider\nbecause there's a lot of people out\nthere telling them it's not your fault\nbut they're like but it feels like it's\nmy fault it's invalidating their\nperspective and so it sort of it sort of\nmakes rational sense right that it's not\nyour fault that like you were assaulted\ncertainly if you're not for but at the\nsame time that's the way that they feel\nand it like the the thoughts that are\ngenerated by the mind may seem\nobjectively irrational but the mind has\na damn good reason for generating a\nparticular thought like if our thought\nif our mind generated unuseful or\nunadapted thoughts we wouldn't be alive\nthe first thing to understand is that\nyour mind adapts to circumstances like\nif you stub your toe your brain is like\nlet's take care of that [ __ ] how can a\nbrain that can teach you how to walk\nteach you how to talk teach you how to\nlike deal with animals deal with people\nunderstand broad societal movements and\nwhy you should change your name can\nreflect on like what you've done in the\npast this is the instrument that you're\ndealing with and you're just saying like\nin this one random corner of your mind\nit's just broken like that's not how it\nworks\nanxiety comes from somewhere and this is\nthe\nand why people can't get over their\nanxiety because you assume that there's\na part of your car that's busted when\nactually it's working exactly I think\nit's supposed to so any attempts to fix\nit or not gonna work because you don't\nunderstand actually what's going on so\nokay and sorry if I go back to specific\nexamples go for I want to know as time\ngoes on I'll be like because it's kind\nof like embarrassing some of this stuff\nthat I do to like try to fix which went\nimmediately when I feel anxious what I\nwant to do is try to get rid of those\nfeelings of anxiety you're doing what\nI'm doing I'm fortunate enough where\nagain here I go but I'll just say I'll\njust talk because I'm sure it's okay for\nmy anxiety doesn't normally stop me from\ndoing anything okay sort of makes the\nexperience very unpleasant like okay it\nreally wasn't so like for I'll go back\nto the plane one because I think it's\nlike an easy example the point two\nthings that I do specifically so this is\nmy process before I go on a flight and\nfor the record I used to be a commercial\nairline pilot which I'm sure a lot of\npeople are like really they don't\nunderstand how you can have a fear of\nflying whoops Wow\nlike yeah be a pilot sure maybe I don't\nreally know the answer to that but when\nI go on a plane you know I'm scared of\nall the things that I alluded to before\nbut so what I try to do in my head is to\nwork to try to make myself feel better\nso what does that mean and so what I'll\ndo is I'll look up the flight I'll look\nup the flight plan I'll look up the\nweather forecast I'll monitor the\nplane's altitude and airspeed while the\nplane is flying like I'll sit there and\nyou know like on the airline's on the on\nthe screen you'll you'll see like\nairspeed and and like altitude and\nwhatnot and because of my knowledge of\naviation I'll be like I'll feel better\nwatching the the the airspeed the\nweather and everything just feeling to\nmake sure it's normal because when\nyou're sitting in a plane in the back of\nit often you can't really tell what in\nwhat isn't normal right so like you know\nlike when we're going in for when we're\ntaking off Oh monitor the airspeed when\nwe're taking off and I'll look at my\nphone alright I look at my phone I'll\nlook at the airspeed I'm like well we're\nin a 737-900 you know we need to be at\nyou know\nat this time you know we need to be at\nthis particular speed or you know or or\nlike I'm expecting that we're gonna turn\nthis I'm gonna ask you a question does\nthat feel like you're feeding or\nsatisfying something it feels in the\nmoment it feels like I'm like okay\neverything's actually going normal\nbecause looking at like I said looking\nout the window it's hard to really judge\nit's satisfying right so your mind is\nhungry for something yes and then you\nprovide it with something yeah and then\nit's satisfied right so what happens to\nsomething that is hungry and then you\ngive it food it's sad as it's full yep\nand what happens to it over time you\nneed to eat again absolutely but but\nI've never I've never thought of these\nbehaviors as being like exceptionally\nlike healthy like cuz cuz like for me I\nfeel like because they're going on my\nyeah exactly like going on like my phone\nand connect and buying Wi-Fi too so look\nat all these things is just no reception\nyeah so let's I don't want you okay so\nwe're gonna talk man there's so much\ntalk about this is fantastic man so I\nthink I really want to explain a lot of\nstuff to you and I hope that your\nanxiety can get better\nalso you should talk a little bit about\nyou know whether you should actually get\ninto treatment because it sounds like\nyou may have an anxiety disorder yeah\nso I would recommend that you actually\nget evaluated by a real psychiatrist for\nthat yeah absolutely but let's just talk\nabout the nature of mind for a second\nand talk about anxiety in general okay\nso the first thing is that like I want\nyou to just think about a scenario so\nlet's say I have low self-confidence\nand then like I'm feeling bad about\nmyself so what I do is I like ID I'm a\nfriend of mine and I'm like hey like do\nyou think I'm a piece of [ __ ] and then\nthey say no man you're awesome and then\nlike what happens to my feeling of low\nself confidence I'm hoping that it would\ngo up at that point but then but then\nyou would probably I kind of maybe\nforgive me if I'm going ahead of you but\nare you instantly like later\nthe self-confident would that hit that\nwas him eating yep right and filling him\nup but and then afterwards he has to eat\nagain absolutely right so like like but\nis that your observation in the world\nthat reassurance to people who lack\nconfidence doesn't really fix the\nproblem\nit just is sort of like a band-aid\nthat's the hypothesis do you agree with\nthat uh now the way you described it yes\nbut I think that a lot of people would\nthink that like constant support in that\nradicular situation would get them to be\nmore confident yeah but that's actually\nnot what happens yeah okay\nright cuz like you guys y'all will know\nthis if you have either been this person\nor you have had a friend who's like this\nthat no matter how many times you tell\nthem that they are awesome people they\nneed to hear it again\nthat's so god I never you're blowing my\nmind because I've never thought of it\nthat way\ncuz I've been on the opposite end of\npeople that feel that way and me telling\nthem I'm like I feel like this is like\nhelping them like they're gonna feel\nbetter and they may feel better than\nthey do feel better in the moment and\nthen after that just feeding the beast\nexactly I didn't even I did I never\nthought about it that way I always\nthought it is like the solution was to\nmake continue to make them feel\nabsolutely and like let's just think\nabout that scientifically if that was\nthe solution if you did it for a couple\nmonths they should be better then like\npeople wouldn't have if we look at it\nsystemic Lee as a society people have\nconfidence problems all the time\neveryone's [ __ ] reassuring each other\nif that was this good solution no one\nwould have conference problems the\nsolution so so what I really want to\nencourage you to do Austin and we're\ngonna talk about this in a second with\ncommercial pilot and fear of flying is\ninstead of taking something that doesn't\nmake sense and adjusting the data we\nneed to adjust the way that we look at\nthe data for the data to make sense the\ndata is the data just because it's\nirrational for you to want to be a\ncommercial airline pilot and have a fear\nof flying doesn't mean it's irrational\nboth both of those things exist in your\nmind that doesn't mean it's a rational\nwe need to take a step back and assume\nfor a moment that's perfectly rational\nperfectly rational and then we need to\nunderstand understanding of the mind\nthat makes those two thoughts coexist\nbecause that's actually what's happening\nin your mind does that make sense\nyeah it makes sense and it's it's weird\ndr. K cuz I in the moment like I talked\nabout all the things that I do in the\nfear and whatnot but it never would stop\nme from wanting to go on an airplane\ndoes that make sense it never wants to\ncuz I like love the idea of flight and\nlike like flying flight simulator like I\nlove that I love everything that goes\ninto it I watch plane videos like it's\nsomething that I like yeah I'm so we're\ngonna be a course airline pilot yeah so\nnice to really enjoy it sorry go ahead\nso here we go okay so like here's the\nthing you get on the flight and Austin\nloves flying\nand Austin's mom whose voice he's\ninternalized because that's what we do\nAustin's mom's voice pops into your head\nand it's like you're gonna die\nand then there's like a conflict between\nthese two things because your mom taught\nme right like they teach us things yeah\nlike I try to teach my kids to like\nflush the toilet yeah and so like what's\nhappening in their tiny little mind and\nlike even even my so my youngest\ndaughter does this thing where she likes\nto get off of the potty and then wipe\nherself and then like that makes wiping\nway harder right like wiping is easier\nwhen you're on the potty\nso I like try to teach her like we wipe\non the potty I wipe off the potty dr.\nkay but I mean well actually I used to\nknow yeah I use a bidet now but okay\nbefore you have to stand up I mean this\nis a whole nother that debate okay\nanyway it's not judging days be great if\nyou want me to judge you for being a\nstick master we have to talk about so\nnow what she does is like when she's on\nthe potty she literally says the words\nwe wipe on the potty and I'm like yes we\nwipe on the potty she has internalized\nmy voice because internalizing the voice\nof our parents is what we call any idea\noh good\nis this a quiz yes I'm putting you on\nthe spot internalizing dr. kay show more\nparents voice is something that we call\nits a read my mind question oh I learn\nokay learning is its yeah it's the\nhardest questions are the simplest ones\nright I got it got it makes sense so\nlike that it's literally what learning\nis like we don't even think about what\nlearning is like we just like to use the\nword but like literally learning is like\nthe process of internalizing things\naround us and like making it a part of\nour thought process so like racism is\nlearned right like like it becomes\ninternal and then once we learn\nsomething it's sort of like pops up it\nstarts generating certain thoughts\nbecause like we understand it now and\nso what I think happened in your case is\nand this is just a preliminary thought\nright is that like your mom taught you\nand I that's that's the way I want you\nto think about your anxiety it's not\nthat it's irrational it's that it's talk\nshe like literally taught you that like\nif you put on a bike helmet if you don't\nput on a bike helmet you're gonna get a\nTBI and you're gonna die if you ever\ndrink alcohol you're gonna die if you\never do this you're gonna die and then\nwe see that in your mind there's like\nAustin who loves planes and then there's\nyour mom's voice who's ya gonna die and\nanything happens is you're like that\ndoesn't make sense because Austin is\nlike no I'm not gonna die and then like\nthey have a little war in your head and\nthen you pull out your phone and then\nyou start to pull out all your things\nthen what you do is you kind of calm\ndown the anxiety but actually what\nyou're doing is feeding it because\nyou're not getting to the root of where\nit comes from\nyou're like alleviating it from the top\nit's like the root is that is not\nreassurance you need to challenge the\nvery idea that you're gonna die that's\nand that's in that for me that's a\nchallenge because if I don't know how to\nexplain this but it's this feeling of if\nI let my guard down I'm gonna die yeah\nif I like if I'm letting it it doesn't\nmake sense because let's face it dr. K\nif I'm flying at 35,000 feet and I'm\ngonna die\nI can't me thinking me they like nah it\ndoesn't matter I'm gonna die right\nthat's just what's gonna happen if your\nplanes going down me in the back I'm\nwith my iphone looking up the flight in\nthe airspeed is it gonna change my you\nknow yeah so so this is where we learn\nhow to do things like sit with it okay\nso now like I'm gonna give you an\nalternate scenario I think if you want\nyour anxiety to improve over time mm-hmm\nfirst thing that you've got to do is\nlike let yourself die bro like when\nyou're sitting there there's like\nrecognize first of all that like Austin\nloves flying like Eli Gus is like I live\nin stuff and then there's this other\npart of you so we could call it the\nvoice of your mom but maybe it's maybe\nshe's just a contributor so the other so\nyeah I'll talk about that in a second\nbecause it may not be the voice of your\nmom right the second there's just your\nanxiety so your anxiety like I want you\nto think about it like\nAustin it's not a single-player game\nit's like a party RPG and you've got a\nbunch of characters in there and you've\ngot Austin right who's like your\nprotagonist and then you have your\nanxiety which is actually a really\nimportant member of your party it's not\nactually irrational and bad it's not an\nenemy this is what people think like\nwhen we start calling it mental illness\nwhich you know could be apply but we\nthink about it as an enemy but you gotta\nunderstand your anxiety is helping you\nout bro your anxiety is the part of your\nmind which looks into the future\npredicts danger and make sure you don't\nscrew up it's the same part of your mind\nthat is telling you hey it's time to\nstart calling myself Raj Patel or Austin\nyeah right like it's it's saying like\nhey like if I continue doing this bad\nthings could happen and like how is that\nnot a good part of your party right you\nknow like anxieties protect protective\nthat's why we have it like human beings\nlike why does the human brain think\nabout terrible things happening to us\nbecause back when we were like monkeys\nin the jungle we were walking around and\nwe would see a tiger footprint and there\nwere two kinds of monkeys one monkey was\nlike oh [ __ ] there's probably a tiger\nbehind that bush even though the\nlikelihood that the tiger behind the\nbush was low you just need a little bit\nof information and then you project\ndanger and then there was the monkey\nthat was like ah NBD and one of them got\neaten and one of them did yeah and so\nanxiety is adapted it's a war asleep\nyeah why do we still have those types of\npeople then like why do we like we still\nhave those people's that like like my\nfriends that I like fly with they get on\nthe plane and you know they order a\ndrink and they're just you know they\ndon't care and they just sit her and no\nmatter what happens what movement\nthey're just\nyeah so great question so now we get to\nlike okay where does your anxiety come\nfrom so here are the two hypotheses one\nis they didn't have your mom mm-hmm\nright so like when I had you when I went\non a flight my dad did the opposite I\nwould be anxious and he would be like\nit's gonna be okay and he's like you\nknow it's gonna Rumble for a while and\nthen also I had like particular\nexperiences that I remember like\ncognitively like I remember I used to be\nscared of flights and then I would start\nplaying the Super Mario music in my head\nbecause sometimes in Super Mario like\nyou'd get launched somewhere and it\nwould be like you know and so like I\nstarted playing like literally in my\nmind I started playing the Super Mario\nmusic in my head and I'd pretend that I\nwas like Mario flying through space and\nlike that seemed to help I tried\nsomething like that I would turn on you\nI would try to turn on like happy like\nmusic that like would sort of bring me\nto like a normal place so I actually\nlike started playing and I only did this\nfor a brief period of time and then it's\nfrustrating because so I know I'm trying\nto distract myself this is the\ndifference I wasn't trying to distract\nmyself I was trying to change I was\nsitting with the feeling of flying and\nchanging the framework around it I\nwasn't trying to distract myself at all\nokay does that make sense yeah okay yeah\ncuz when I when I think because I tried\nplaying the song I tried playing the\nsong big ol jet airliner by Steve Miller\nyou know daran daran big ol jet line and\nit was like a happy like yeah you know\ngoing on the road and doing like fun\nstuff but and like I would listen to\nthat on takeoff which is like the part\nof the flight where I'm like most\nanxious and in my head like it kind of\nhelped a little bit but I just stopped\ndoing it because again I feel like if\nI'm actively trying to and again I\nunderstand what you said by the way\nabout what your how you were doing but\nin my head I was like I know I know\nintuitively what I'm doing is trying to\ntake my mind off of the\nthe anxiety around flight and in that in\nmy head that's letting my guard down and\nI must be ready to look at everything\nand know what's happening all the time\nyeah so so let's just clarify for a\nsecond I get that you understood what I\nsaid so I'm gonna explain it just as\nclearly as I can so when you face\nanxiety you've got a couple of options\none is to distract yourself one is to\nfeed it or reassure yourself by giving\nin to it okay the third option is to be\nwith it but like not do anything and and\nsomehow I was lucky enough to stumble on\nI think it's just random chance it's not\nlike I was smart or anything it was just\nlike I just stumbled on like this this\nway of sitting fully with my feelings I\nwasn't trying to move away from them I\njust sort of pretended it was like in a\ndifferent context and even now I find\nmyself doing that on flights for a few\nseconds and I still feel uncomfortable\nand like I sit with the feeling kind of\nfully and so you can kind of sit with it\nwhich is what I think you need to learn\nhow to do but that's challenging because\nit's sort of like sitting with like a\nhungry stomach right so like it's gonna\nwant things and it's gonna like grab at\nyou Austin it's gonna be like I need\nthis I give this to me give this to me\ngive this to me I have a question when\nyou're ya know kuffar why do I feel cuz\nI'm not like completely I don't want you\nknow don't I'm not anxious throughout\nthe entire like there are there are\nmoments of flight where I feel clunk\ncalm but not consistently like it just\ndepends right it varies by flight right\nthere are moments during the flight\nwhere I am calm but then but that's when\nyou know we're flying smoothly we're at\ncruise altitude everything's smooth as\nsoon as we hit a bump my heart starts\nracing the phones out again looking you\nknow it the weather like what's gonna\nhappen how long are we gonna be flying\nthrough this you know I do things like I\ngo like you know I'm taking you through\nexactly like if you're watching me on a\nplane I go like this I like I grab on to\nmyself like I claw unto myself when I\ngrab on\non to things like I I put my hands in my\nface I start to like panic during during\nturbulence and thing in the crazy thing\nabout this dr. K is I understand\nlogically\nthat turbulence in the forces on earth\nhave literally never taken down a\ncommercial aircraft there was one\nincident of it and it was like in the\n60s back when claims were made out of\ncardboard you know or whatnot but it's\njust not rational in the modern world\nfor turbulence to impact the aircraft\nbut for me the the the thought in my\nhead at that moment is when I feel the\nturbulence I know turbulence isn't crazy\nbut but like I can't a suit like what if\nit wasn't turbulence what if it was what\nif something else is going wrong what if\nwhat if we are in that crazy type of\nturbulence it could impact the aircraft\nyou know sure yes oh that's so we're\ngonna talk about some scars and kind of\ngetting I have had some traumatic\nexperience flying and I could I don't\nknow if that helps that certainly hurts\nuh yeah and I'll tell you my anxiety\naround flying has gotten worse since\nthis one particular experience yeah so I\ndescribe it to you if you were hurt go\nfor it um I went on a flight from and\nthis might not have even been bad\nbecause it just felt bad right I went on\na flight from Los Angeles to Nashville\nand on Southwest Airlines and I would we\nwere in there and the pilot came over\nand he said hey were experiencing some\nyou know we're about to experience some\nsevere turbulence and the flight\nattendants are gonna be seated\nyou know nothing normal or abnormal I\ndon't know if he used the word severe I\ncan't recall exactly but he said you\nknow some significant turbulence and we\ntold that told him to seat the flight\nattendants the flight since receded and\nthen the flight attendants came over to\nreiterate how like critical it was that\nyou were in your seat because you know\nsome people don't usually take it\nseriously and I and they mentioned that\nit was a thunderstorm and this I was\nstill a augment admittedly I was looking\nat my phone at this time like checking\nwhether and still doing those sorts of\nthings and so I look and there was a\nthunderstorm that extended the entire\ncentral United States and it\nalmost impossible to fly around and\nbeing being somebody that knows aviation\none of the more dangerous things to\naircraft is severe thunderstorms because\nthat's like something that can actually\nimpact air speed and when you impact air\nspeed there's a you know the it's just\nall sorts of like things that that go\nthrough my head so I'm a little scared\nright I'm a little scared and but not\nlike crazy scared cuz you know again\nthis is this is you know I've been\nthrough stuff you know this this didn't\nseem bad but immediately we start going\nthrough and let me tell you the plane\nwas thrashing people were screaming\npeople I look up the aisle people are\nholding hands I was holding hands with a\nwoman next to me I was like oh my god I\nwas I was like on the verge of tears\nthere was a guy next to me rubbing my\nshoulder and other people were freaking\nout and in that experience I can hear\nthe engines going\nbecause when you're in turbulence and\nthe and the plane is like going through\nthis like pilots often step climb and go\nup and down out the treats to try to\nfind smooth air but in my head in that\nmoment I'm not sure what what's going on\nbecause I can't see anything so and\nwe're in a black cloud you look outside\nthe window it's black out there and you\ncan't see anything so there's no frame\nof reference you feel the plane going up\nand down you hear the engines and it was\njust very very like scary it very\ntraumatizing to me I was shaking I\nremember I was so like happy that like\nit was over with that I bought like the\nentire people around me drinks I said\ndrinks on me I'm so happy to be alive\nwho wants to drink I don't even drink\ndr. K as I said like I don't I got a\ndrink cuz I was like let's celebrate and\nso I bought drinks as it drinks on\neverybody and I bought everybody like I\ndon't know remember what it was but\neverybody get drinks and thank God the\nwhole plane didn't go get want drinks\ncuz then I would have had serious bill\nbut but that was an experience that I\nhad that was very traumatizing and I had\na similar experience not as bad but\ngoing into Las Vegas you know how Las\nVegas is from LA to Las Vegas is\nnotoriously bad for like turbulence and\nstuff I went into Las Vegas crazy\nupdrafts and I remember sitting I was\nsitting next to this girl at this\nAustralian girl and she and I was like\ngoing through my panicky thing and she\nlooks at me she says you're not gonna\ndie and like you know like like I was\nbeing so rational and you know anyway\nsort of I was just exported like the the\nexperience that I had after the fact but\nstill but yeah that's not it's not\nnothing happened but still but let's\nstart with this how does that how does\nit feel that I mean I've shared it\nbefore I might have even shared it on\nstreem but it feels like I feel happy to\nbe that I survived that you know even\nthough you know I know that we probably\nwere never in danger ever you know but\nstill I felt like I was and I feel like\nI we I survived it I feel good about\nthat so let's think about this on the\nground so what does that do\nto your anxiety does it increase it or\ndecrease it like when I talk about it\nlet's start with the experiences the\nexperience like I talked about it and I\nlaugh about it right now\nbecause I'm on the ground and I'm not\nEurope I'm not going on a plane but when\nI get on the plane and I'm not\nnecessarily saying I consciously think\nabout that one particular experience but\nwhen I get on a plane I start to fear\nthat I'm going to go through that again\nabsolutely it starts to jump or anything\nso I get where's the thing Austin you've\njust fed your anxiety so much not\ndefault right but like because the thing\nis like the voice let's just assume for\na second it's the voice of your mom and\nwe got to go back and and kind of talk\nabout how it couldn't may not be but I'm\njust gonna call it that so the voice of\nyour mom is like just think about all\nthe times that she told me to do\nsomething and then you sort of deviated\noff course and how much she liked even\nmore flipped her [ __ ] looks like she's\nlike you gotta wear her helmet otherwise\nyou're gonna die and then you wear your\nhelmet I have an interesting thing about\nthe helmet thing it happened later in\nlife though and I don't know if it\nreally let's steer clear stories for a\nsecond sure but her you know it sounds\nto me like you should definitely find\nsomeone to talk to because it sounds\nlike you yes Yeah right so like this is\nthis is how no no don't apologize it's\njust like this is how emotional\nprocessing works like the stuff has to\ncome out mm-hmm right it's not like\nreassurance it's like you just gotta\nlike go back to those feelings and\nactually what you need to do is like sit\nwith those feelings and not and kind of\nlike decompress them so it's almost sort\nof like exposure therapy where you know\nwhat you do is like if you're afraid of\ndogs like you just go and you like look\nat a dog and then you let those feelings\narise and then you don't go anywhere\nwith them you don't run away from the\ndog and then you don't like force\nyourself to pet the dog because that's\nirrational and so you got to force\nyourself to no you just like sit with it\nand you let the like you let the\nfeelings come up you let them just hang\nout for a while and you do nothing and\nso sometimes in therapy like that's\nsomething that people do there's like a\ntechnique called the EMDR that oh that\nhas\nyou know mix evidence behind it but some\npeople find it very useful what do you\nlike recall a traumatic experience but\nyou're basically doing sort of like a\nmeditation kind of thing while you're\nrecalling the experience so your mind\ncan't fully go back into that space it's\nsort of like half here and half there\nwhich allows you to sort of like swim in\nthat water which without getting\nsomething you know going under anyway in\nyour case I think what's happening is\nlike those kinds of things are feeding\nyour anxiety because remember before\nthat happened everything was irrational\nbut now your anxiety is like but that\nalmost happened right it's like this is\neverything we were afraid of and like\nsure we made it this time like before\nthat it like you had a one in a hundred\nchance of going down in a thunderstorm\nbefore the thunderstorm it was like one\nin a million and now your anxiety is\nlike if that happens 99 more times we're\n[ __ ] right the Las Vegas is like 1 in\n2,000 but like the thing is it's like\nit's reinforcing the basic idea that\nyour anxiety has that like things can go\nwrong on a plane and this is the other\nreally weird thing is that your\nknowledge of aviation do you think that\nmakes your anxiety better or makes it\nworse I've I've drawn almost wonder if\nit makes it worse because I know a lot I\nknow what can go wrong on a plane yeah\nand it's not perfect so so this is where\nthis is where I want you to just oh man\nthere's just so much to explain but ok\nso like I want you to understand that\nlike what happens is your knowledge of\nthe airplane is hijacked by your anxiety\nthat which should reassure you because\nyou know all the statistics actually\nsomehow it gets like hijacked by the air\nlike the the anxiety to like be used\nagainst you it's like Austin knows like\noh like actually flying is safe and like\nyou know I can't I've never met a person\nwho knows when the last accident related\nto turbulence was I like literally never\nmet that person I was in Fiji in 1960\nsomething I frightened so that's what\nanxious people\nthey have all kinds they understand what\nthey're anxious about in and out and it\nonly seems to make things worse right\nwhereas we have this assumption that the\nmore you learn about something the more\nyour anxiety should go down you should\nbe reassured by knowledge but if we\nactually look at the data that's not how\nit works\nknowledge and by the way it's like if\nyou read less about airplanes I don't\nknow that your anxiety would be less I\nthink it just it's just like it uses it\nit uses your anxiety is gonna use\nwhatever it can in your mind because\nanxiety is a feeling and it's gonna wrap\nwhatever logical [ __ ] it can to like\nbring in to itself it doesn't matter\nwhat I have a question yeah\nI want to know if this is unhealthy\nbecause I genuinely enjoy it it doesn't\nmake me anxious in the moment but I do\nwatch like aircraft disaster things like\ndisaster you know YouTube video you know\nit's you know okay like I do that\nbecause I enjoy like the educational\nportion of it like what happened what\nwent wrong\nbut like I don't know like I don't know\nif this was like a like a like a sort of\nlike a I know it sounds so dumb like why\nwould you watch that if you're afraid of\nit but it's almost like I want my\njustification in my head is number one I\nlike enjoy like seeing the aviation\nportion I like it but number two I want\nto know what went wrong and what steps\nthey took to fix it so like now I know\nwhen I go on a plane that the likelihood\nof that particular situation isn't gonna\nhappen again sort of thing\nyes yeah makes a lot of sense so the\nshort answer is like yes and no does it\nis it a good idea or bad idea so it's\nfine because remember that Austin likes\naviation that has nothing to do with\nyour anxiety right like if it's not\ntriggering for you I think it's fine to\nwatch it and we see the second piece too\nwhich is that the reassurance piece is\nactually feeding your anxiety but\nanything you do to reassure yourself is\ngonna feed anxiety right you see that\nyeah and I'm not actively thinking about\nthese disaster videos in flight like oh\nI'm gonna be that flight yeah so I mean\nit sounds like it's like I think that I\nthink that the solution to your anxiety\ndoes not involve\nin a significant way stopping - watching\nyoutube videos about aviation okay I\nthink the solution to your anxiety is\nlike pretty simple and it's like the\nsolution to like most anxiety which\nwe'll get to in a second but let's go\nback to the origin for a second okay so\nis this the voice of your mom that's\nwhat it looks ounds like right that's\nthe best example of a smoking gun that\nwe've got but there are a couple of\nother things which I want to clue people\nin on so first of all really interesting\nstudy okay so they took kids diagnosed\nwith anxiety who have had parents who\nhad diagnosed nosis of anxiety and they\nfound that treating the parent\nactually treats the child even after the\nFET or just whether a child okay so like\nif I if I take a child like a ten year\nold with an anxiety disorder and I take\ntheir 35 year old mom with an anxiety\ndisorder and I give the 10 year old\nmedication and I in one group I give I\nmedicate the child and in the other\ngroup I medicate the mom both results\nare the same\nwow that's incredible phrase because the\nsource of the anxiety is the theory that\nthe sort the anxiety came from the\nmother or the person with the anxiety\nyeah sort of like that's what the data\nsuggests right so then there are a\ncouple of other things so we know that\nanxiety disorders run in families so\nthere is an inherited component so there\nmay just be something and I do think I\ndon't think it's just your mom so I\nthink your brain Austin as evidenced by\nyour professional success is very good\nat projecting catastrophe which actually\nhelps you succeed professionally because\nyour brain is capable of considering ups\nand downs that the average person may\nnot be able to consider which can is\nattentive and beneficial to you so you\nwould avoided certain pitfalls and you\nalso can put eyes on some low\npossibility things because you were able\nto predict them because all anxiety is\nis your predictive capability right the\nbetter you are at predicting the worse\nyour anxiety is gonna be yeah I can see\nthat so so one thing is that like you\nmay just have an inherited component\nwhich may not be like due to the\nenvironment of your mom it could just be\nlike genetically your neurons are sort\nof wired to be like a little bit more\nanxious you probably have high trait\nneuroticism which is another personality\ncomponent sure second thing is that\ngoing no you go ahead no please so no so\nsecond thing is like better you learn to\nlisten sorry second thing is that you\nknow I do think that it sort of makes\nsense to me that you were taught to be\nfearful you were taught to be fearful so\nthat's how I would reframe your anxiety\nis like this is your conditioning it's\nnot irrational its conditioning and\nconditioning can absolutely be\nirrational like then you're like why am\ni this way it's because you're [ __ ]\nconditioned and that solves everything\nit's weird I'm starting to think because\nmy mother like but my dad is also kind\nof paranoid\nit keeps kind of paranoid too like I'm\nnot saying I don't think my mom when I\nthink of somebody that has anxiety I\nthink of my mom because she's she like\nshares many traits with me in terms of\nlike my personality and and stuff but my\ndad is also paranoid in like different\nareas like my dad a walk on a plane and\nyou know he'll eat an edible and he'll\nbe passed out and doesn't care right\ndoesn't care doesn't give a rip just\nchill him with his coffee you know\nchilling and you know whatever he'll\nhe'll go someplace and not worry about\nanything you know yeah now now now\neverybody knows where I got it from no\nI'm just kidding\nbut uh but but my dad like he's also\nvery like paranoid about other things\nlike he's like different things that are\ndifferent from my mother\nlike it's different aspects of life I'm\ntrying to think of like an example and\nis your blind a combination of those two\npeople often say that I have my\npersonalities like my mother and my like\nmore people say like my more like if you\nwill like\ntrying to think of it a personality\nmother people say that my dad is is very\nmuch like a like sort of like my more my\nmore rational side if you will like I\ndon't I want to say my mom's irrational\nbut like my more yes like in if I had\nand I'm not saying my mom's stupid right\nbut if I had like a more intellectual\nlike critical thinking side it would be\nfrom my dad right my mom's not that way\nbut that like my my habits sorry good\nyeah so so so well so Austin I'm just\nnoticing there's a lot left to talk\nabout so we'll talk about how to talk\nabout what's left to talk about\ncuz we you know I want I don't want to\ngive you the sense that I'm not offering\nyou complete picture I'm giving you like\n10% because there's you know individuals\nare like I'm gonna share a couple\nprinciples with you we can talk a little\nbit more about that but I want to get to\na couple of other things just about\ngenerally speaking the origin of anxiety\nso what is like we can think that you\nare conditioned so the other big place\nthat anxiety comes from is actually what\nI asked you earlier about like so you\ncan learn you can learn to be afraid of\ncatastrophe in two ways one is that you\ncan be taught to be afraid of\ncatastrophe by like your parents or you\ncan actually have faced catastrophe\nbefore and then your mind then it's no\nlonger theoretic right because if it's\nhappened to you then it's actually a\npossibility and so I'll just give you\nlike an example which of a patient of\nmine who has allowed me to share this\ncomponent because she thinks it would be\nhelpful so she's someone who had anxiety\nfor like 17 years and then at this like\nand it was irrational right like she\nwould always like think about horrible\nthings going wrong and and the more that\nwe kind of talked about her it was just\nso she had lost her or father due to\ncancer and so like that had been\nexplored in therapy as well and like\nlike if she had kind of talked about the\nloss and how that was like sad and\ngrievous and and all that kind of stuff\nand so she sort of been like okay so\nlike lost dad like sometimes that leads\nto an anxiety disorder didn't seem to be\nthe case\nshe was actually anxious before she lost\nher dad so the question is like when did\nyou become anxious so like it turns out\nthat the root Harang her anxiety is that\nwhen she was like 6 or so\nshe knew her dad had cancer she like\nknew something was wrong and everyone\ntold her everything was okay\nbut in her heart of hearts she felt like\nsomething was true and she was taught\nthat she was irrational when in fact\nshe's been right all along and so her\nsense of what is real and unreal got\n[ __ ] up at a young age and the second\nshe ought not the second but over the\ncourse of a couple of weeks is she\nrealized that like her problem her\nfreedom from anxiety was not in calling\nit irrational it was in recognizing that\nit's actually very rational it's the\nopposite and then she got better because\nshe's like oh like these feelings that I\nhave are not wrong they're actually\nright and that allowed her to sit with\nthem and it's like your fears are real\nthey're not wrong and the whole reason\nthat our anxiety never gets better is\nbecause she actually like invalidates\nher feelings and she assumes she's\nirrational she assumes something is\nbroken when actually it's working fine\nand then like how the [ __ ] like no\nwonder you can't drive your car properly\nbecause you're pretending like you have\na flat and your tires fine right so in\nmy experience comes from two places\neither conditioning or an event where\nthe catastrophe actually happened and\nthen it's like no longer irrational for\nyou it's a reality it actually happened\nso this is why like you know people who\nhave bad [ __ ] happen to them to develop\nanxiety disorders because like something\nhappens where that one-in-a-million\nthing like I had another patient who was\nlike attacked in a gas station bathroom\nby like a 13 year old male patient who\nwas attacked in a bathroom by like a 30\nyear old truck driver like sexually\nin a gas station bathroom and like after\nthat he's got anxiety because think\nabout the worst thing that you could\npossibly think about when you're 13 and\nthink about how irrational it is for\nthat [ __ ] to happen and then this\nconfess to you and the low likelihood of\nthe world getting hit by a meteor is\nactually like this is way worse and the\nworst thing can happen to you I have a\nquestion yeah is Earth's is there such\nthing as a combination of both like\nsolutely sort of okay so that's why I so\nso I think I think if you feel like your\nmom is not all of the picture Isis I\ndon't suspect one of the hypotheses is\nthat something happened to you that felt\nincredibly catastrophic that because of\nthe way that your mind tends to discount\nthe way that you feel because you're\nirrational and you just invalidate\nyourself all the time I don't even know\nthat you're able to like go back there\nbecause you probably felt like it was so\nstupid and insignificant\nand that my mind that I like I can't\neven remember because I heard it all\nexactly exactly and this is exactly what\nhappened with the other patient which is\nthat she thought that actually losing\nher dad is so much more of a logical\nthing that should contribute to anxiety\nthen knowing that your dad was sick is\nlike her actual memories where the\nanxiety was born was like seeing like\nthey would like her dad wouldn't go into\nwork one day and he'd like go to the\nclinic and they'd like drop him off to\nget chemotherapy and then she'd be like\nwhat why are we here and they're like oh\nnot everything's okay everything's okay\nand then her dad would like come back\nfrom chemotherapy and he'd be like he\nlooked sick he'd be like sunken and he'd\nlose weight and she's like what's wrong\nwith that and they'd say nothing and\nactually that's way worse than losing\nhim because she was six and then when\nshe was like 18 and her dad was actually\ndying she could understand what was\nhappening and also they were like they\nwere telling her reality right her\ndisconnection if you think about anxiety\nyou keep on saying it's so rational it's\nso rational that disconnection from\nreality happens at six because she\nactually got disconnected from reality\nand so it's not irrational for your mind\nto be disconnected from reality because\nthat's what\nyou learn you learned that everything\nthat you feel is not actually correct\nthat's what she learned right and\nsomewhere along the way you learned this\nstuff you're not broken man\nlike it's just how your mind has learned\nhow to function\nso there there may be an experience\nsomewhere in there where like you felt\nlike it could be something dumb like\nforgetting your homework\nand it could be something where like you\nwere afraid are you getting emotional no\nI'm good I think it's very powerful what\nyou said because I've always out of it\nis saying it's irrational I've always\nthought irrational rational rational and\nI've heart on that and I thought that\nwas a productive thing to do like my\nfear is irrational that's that's all\nthat I thought that that was like a\nsolution to no problem so awesome I\nreturn you to what I said earlier about\nbeing scientific everyone thinks that\ntheir fear is irrational and what does\nit do to their anxiety doesn't help it\nabsolutely so that's not a useful\nframework because data suggests it\ndoesn't work so let's stop thinking it\neven though we think it's right it\nsounds rational for us to approach\nanxiety as irrational right but it's\njust not because it doesn't work it's\nnot it doesn't mirror actual reality so\nwe need to be more open-minded right I'd\nnever thought of it that way\never yeah so you heard it in passing but\nthis is like so the last thing is that\nyou know are your parents to blame\nbecause I think in order for you to\nunderstand where this comes from you\nhave to let your parents take some\nresponsibility for this so I want to\nhelp you do that and let me just say\nthis no matter how good of a parent you\nare there's gonna be collateral damage\nfor your kids doesn't mean that they did\na bad job it's clear that they did a\ngreat job and they're not perfect nor\nshould we expect them to be perfect and\nthey kind of screwed you up in some ways\nwhich is what parents do\nlike my kids are gonna be screwed up in\nsome ways it doesn't like there's no way\nto avoid that like it's just like the\ngoal is for parents to be like good\nenough right it's not for them to be\nperfect and it's okay like my parents\nlike I'm a pretty healthy human being\nand I'm grateful for my upbringing I\nthink my parents are awesome and they\nscrewed me up in some ways that's just\npart of life like there is no\nparent-child relationship I have ever\nseen no matter how good the parent is\nwhere the child is not a little bit\n[ __ ] up just how it works you know\nthey do the best that they can and then\nyou try to because I'm sure there are\nsome things you've already decided that\nyou're gonna do differently from your\nparents if you ever I don't\nand everyone thinks that and that that\ndoesn't make your parents bad it's just\nlike they're not perfect and I think you\nknow we definitely see it's interesting\nbecause when we hear about your mom and\nthis this kind of you know this\nconditioning and all that kind of crap\nand it's actually borne out in evidence\nas well that like if if maybe your mom\nhad treated had been treated you may not\nhave had the anxiety that you do to\nthink we don't blame her for that\nbecause she did the best that she could\nright it's in the same way that we don't\nblame you for calling yourself Raj Patel\na while ago because you didn't know any\nbetter like isn't wrong sure but like we\ndon't blame you for it cuz it you know\nin the same way like could she have done\nbetter sure but we don't blame her for\nit like she did the best that she could\nshe did a really good job we could be\ngrateful and be like okay so like now we\nknow that does that make sense\nyeah it makes sense so I do have a\nquestion though yeah and this is the\nhard part that I have with this and\nassociate and blame to my parents\nbecause and this is sort of in the\nprocess of getting older and maybe\npeople can relate to this but when you\ngrow up you sort of have a perfect image\nof your parents and they can do no wrong\nyou know that sort of thing and the idea\nto like say blame it's just like I don't\nknow why and I understand what what\nyou're saying but in my mind my mind\nimmediately goes to as soon as they I\nwould say blame to my parents that would\nimplicate them as like being just bad\njust because like how people perceive if\nthat's the only thing people have heard\nfrom my parents that they were the\nreason why I'm so anxious I'm afraid\nthat they would think that they're bad\nparents and you logically you being who\nyou are I understand that you wouldn't\nget it that way but I don't want anybody\nelse to think that way or like the\npublic image of them being like bad\nparents you know what I mean\nyeah so I mean I think that's just where\nlike as human beings we need to be more\nnuanced right right so like I'll share\nwith you another story if that's okay\nyes I had another patient who also you\nknow okay with me sharing just that like\nyep so he also\nuh you know lost a parent when he was\nyoung and then I would ask him about\nlike you know what was your other parent\nlike and he said my other parent did the\ndid the best study that they could and I\nsort of like thought it was weird that\nlike you know okay fine they did the\nbest they of course right that's what\nall parents do is they did the best they\ncould but like I was like you know have\nhouse your house your dad\nlike he did the best that he could and\nthen we kind of talked a little bit and\nturns out that like after work his dad\nwould like usually go to the bar and\nlike have a couple beers with his\nfriends and that was like kind of a\ndaily occurrence and he was grieving and\nstuff like that so patient really blame\nhim he's like you know he's like the\ndude lost a wife it's got to be tough he\ndid the best that he could what do you\nthink though is that like he never says\nthat his dad did a great job he says\nthat his dad did the best that he could\nall right so there's like there's no\nblame but there's also like a subtle\nunder the surface acknowledgement that\nlike I mean his son had lost a mother\nand he instead of coming home because he\nhad certain needs of like dealing with\nzone emotions like hung out in a bar and\nit's really hard to blame him for that\nbut it's really important to do that\nright it's it's it's one thing because\nhere's the problem that he had he\ncouldn't forgive his dad because you\ncan't forgive someone unless they did\nsomething wrong and in his mind he was\nmaking excuses so like there's no chance\nfor forgiveness so oddly enough his path\nforward was to acknowledge that like his\ndad did the best that he could I don't\nblame him for that and forgive him for\nbeing not a perfect parent and now he's\nfine like it's like been settled like he\ndoesn't hold a grudge he doesn't talk\n[ __ ] about his dad know when things his\ndad is a bad person that's where\nconflation happens that's where like\npitchforks come out right and you can\nlike and this is where like you have to\nI think it's healthy as a child to\nrecognize that your parents are flawed\nbecause they're not perfect it's healthy\nyou have to grow into recognizing that\nyour parents did the best study that\nthey could and you don't blame for that\nbut it [ __ ] a couple of things up and\nlike that's actually okay like we need\nto live in a world where instead of\nexpecting people to be perfect we need\nto like understand that they're not\nlike actually be okay with that it's\nabout sitting with it right not making\nit go away not treating it not\ndiscounting with it just sitting with it\nand saying that's the way they are\nthey're not perfect and I'm grateful to\nthem I mean I think there's no doubt in\nanyone's mind because watch this whole\nstream that you were incredibly grateful\nto your parents and they're incredibly\nproud of you and just because your\nanxiety is related to them doesn't\nchange any of that we need to be able to\nhold two contrary concepts in our mind\nwhich is not something that our that\nwe're good at as a society\nI love planes I have a fear of flying\nthose can absolutely coexist right\nsomeone is a bad person and I mean this\nis gonna be kind of controversial but\nlike this is just what I've you know\nwhat I when you work with criminals\nsometimes you begin to see that people\ncan do deplorable things but it doesn't\nmake them absolute incarnations of evil\nright that sometimes like it's bizarre\nlike when you work with someone who is a\nsexual abuser who in turn was sexually\nabused\ndoes it absolve them of responsibility\nof their actions absolutely not\nshouldn't they be punished absolutely\nand like sometimes there should be room\nfor compassion I'm not asking anyone to\ndo that that's been my personal\nexperience that I have come to deal with\npeople and the more that I see the world\nis less black-and-white I'm not trying\nto be an apologist for rape or anything\nlike that I I mean I think they deserve\nto be in jail and also like once they're\nin jail you know it doesn't mean that we\nshould I personally choose to try to be\ncompassionate towards as many people as\nI can which I'm not expecting other\npeople to do but what I want to say talk\nabout things being misinterpreted and\nconflated of the internet time and\nfeathering you know what I want to say\nis that we should be able to hold two\nthings at the same time right that like\nthat your parents did a wonderful job\nand they weren't perfect and that like\nyou need to get your own anxiety\ndisorder if you have one treated if you\nget kids yeah\nI have a question yeah I've been its\nmedicating myself for anxiety and and I\nknow I don't smoke weed for my anxiety\nin fact it sometimes it makes it\nincredibly worse I smoke weed because it\nmakes food taste good and you know and\nother other stuff feel good you know\nbut i i've been very against medication\ndo you have like a particular stance on\nthat sure I think if you're against\nmedication don't take medication fair\nenough that's I feel like it's cheating\nand I'm like I'm almost anxious to take\nthis is kind of messed up have you seen\na psychiatrist or like had an evaluation\nfor anxiety\nno it just sort of just sort of known\nthat I have it and like it's a problem\nokay so I would start there okay and I\nwould start there\nand then you know I would listen to the\noption so be careful about the kind of\nlike mental health treatment provider\nyou go to because some psychiatrists or\npsycho pharmacologists which means that\nthey will see like three to four\npatients an hour and they basically\nprescribe medications\nthat's literally with their job it's\nlike it's like a psychopharmacology\nposition so in my experience so just a\ncouple of things about data okay so\nlet's talk about data for a second\npsychotherapy is about as equal as as\neffective as medication they're just as\ngood psychotherapy plus medication\noutperforms either one on one in my\npersonal experience I prescribed\nmedications to about twenty to thirty\npercent of my patients so sometimes like\nthe question the real question about\nmedication it's not like a value\njudgment or anything like that I think\nis just like a tool in your tool belt\nand you shouldn't have a bias against it\nor think that it's like people do think\nit's sort of like a crotch or a weakness\nor things like that I mean I prescribe\nmedication depending on what's going on\nI'm not afraid of it being like a stigma\nI'm just like afraid of what it would do\nto my mind like sure that's valid yes I\nwant to do withdrawals associated with\nit you know so I think that's something\nyou should bring up with your providers\nI get that fear a lot and I manage it\npretty well I'll tell people okay like\nhere's what I understand about\nwithdrawals and things like that so the\nfirst thing I would tell\nis that for the most part your brain is\ndeveloped so developing brains are more\nvulnerable than developed brains because\nyour brain is like growing with this\nchemical around right still at the same\ntime like you know sometimes 16\nyear-olds get prescribed antidepressants\nor anti-anxiety medications that's fine\nI think John yeah is it weird that like\nI'm afraid to take like I'm not and I'm\nnot prescribed it but like the idea of\ntaking like like what do they call that\nmedication that just like it's like one\nof those you you're not supposed to take\nit all the time it's an anxiety\nmedication okay then X yeah I'd be\nafraid to take it because I'd afraid\nthat it would kill me or something\neven though like it's even if it was\nprescribed to me I'd be afraid that it\nwould kill me or like it was something\nwould happen bad yeah so that is I okay\nthis is kind of a loaded term that's an\nirrational fear right okay so most fear\nby definition is irrational because it's\nan emotion it's a different part of the\nbrain at the same time I think it's\ncompletely reasonable and rational for\nyou to have that fear mm-hmm right so\nlike fears aren't rational by their\nnature I think it's I think you should\nbe concerned about xanax so I do my\nlevel best to never prescribed xanax\npersonally because it's highly addictive\nand it works\nentirely too well that's that's that's\npart of my fear is that I would get\naddicted to it because it would work so\nwell yeah that's anxious I take it and\nit would get away my anxiety and just\nthe frequency of how often I am a I\nwould be taking it every time I felt\nlike yeah and then one of these so in my\ntraining program like they really taught\nus conditioned us to fear xanax okay and\nlike they're always like there's a\nthere's a pit in my stomach I remember\nwhen I would work like impatient like so\nwhen people get hospitalized when I look\nat the patient's medication list any\ntime I saw xanax I liked like mice like\nI would feel a pit in my cell right like\noh [ __ ] yeah it's gonna be hard to deal\nwith this person because it's hard to\nget off the Medicaid it's not the\nperson's fault right right\nit makes prescribed usually as like as\nneeded or is it like a like sometimes\nprescribed like generally it's\nsupposed to be used as needed and\nthey're there like a handful of people\nfor whom you can really get away with\nxanax and like those people are people\nwho have like fears of flying or like\npublic speaking where like you know the\nas-needed is not something that by\ndefinition can happen every day like\nsomeone who needs an X like two to three\ntimes a year would be the kind of person\nthat I would prescribe xanax for\nother medications and it's completely\nreasonable for you to be afraid of\nmedications I have been prescribed\nsomething like I'm sorry I interrupted\nyou go ahead go ahead\nI've been prescribed not xanax but some\nor other hydroxyzine is that the correct\nyeah that hydroxyzine they typically\nused as like a anti-allergy but it was\nused to be treated as anxiety yeah and\nalso that's sort of in the same family\nas benadryl just stronger correct I\ndon't know about stronger but yeah okay\neverything else is correct okay yes so\nthat's one of the things that I've so\nthe reason that a lot of people will use\nhydroxyzine is because it is a\nanti-anxiety agent that acts quickly so\nthere are two kinds of anti-anxiety\nagents those that lower your baseline\nlevel of anxiety so those are not as\nneeded medications those are things that\nyou take every day so if we think about\nheart disease for example there are\nmedications that you take for your heart\nthat will like lower your blood pressure\non a daily basis and then there are some\nacute blood-pressure agents that we'll\nuse to like in seconds if you're having\na heart attack\ndrop your blood pressure so that your\nart can pump normally or anyway that's\nnot actually how they work but so that\nthey're like in medicine we have acute\nagents and then we have like long-term\nagents and for anxiety treatment there\nare both kinds they're the kinds that\nyou use for acute anxiety and then there\nare those that you use to lower baseline\nlevels of anxiety that experience from\nday to day the reason that a lot of\npeople use hydroxyzine is because\nhydroxyzine is not habit-forming so it's\nnot addictive like xanax or\nbenzodiazepines which are addictive\nthey're basically like alcohol in like\npill form and modified and so you know\nit sort of makes sense it signals to me\nthat the prescriber who prescribed that\nto you is probably doing it generally\nspeaking a good job yeah and I also\nexpress my like fear of those at benzos\nbut most and I would I would really\nrecommend that you get a thorough mental\nhealth evaluation because there's a lot\nof information that we haven't\ntalked about which is actually really\nimportant important in determining\nwhether you have an a true anxiety\ndisorder and that includes like we\nhaven't I don't ask some basic questions\nlike how often do you have anxiety you\nknow like it was I'm just giving that as\nan example right so there's a lot of\nother stuff like I haven't asked you so\nsometimes anxieties related to actually\nphysical conditions so endocrine\nimbalances like if you have your thyroid\nhormone is too high there's a lot of\nother due diligence that needs to happen\nbefore someone diagnoses you with\nanxiety well what I tried to do today\nand I guess now I'm sort of explaining\nmyself is explain that dealing with\nanxiety is of medical illness is\nactually a completely different thing\nthan helping a human being understand\nhow anxiety in their mind interrupts\nright both of those will hopefully\nalleviate anxiety but one is like more\neducational and like in terms of\ntreatment it sounds like you really do\nneed an evaluation so I would strongly\nencourage you to get I really want\ntherapy for that because like it's\nanybody anybody that has anxiety like I\nhave moments of clarity and it's not\nlike an everyday thing okay there I go\nagain see trying to justify that it's\nnot and so we're like the more it's it's\nit's absolutely crippling it's crippling\nand it's it sucks you can't enjoy\ncertain things that you want to enjoy\nbecause it's absolutely crippling to you\nand it sucks and I want it to just be a\nway I just don't want have to worry\nabout you yeah so in Masan here's my\ngeneral thought about medication just\nstrategically why I prescribe it okay\nthere are different options for you to\nno longer make it crippling if you can\nengage in those then I don't think you\nneed medication if you're unable to\nengage in those that's what a pill is\nfor right if you can meditate do yoga\nand exercise adjust your dot diet get a\nnice Ayurvedic diet going and all this\nkind of crap go to your therapist and\nthere aren't any like houses burning\ndown and you can afford to deal with the\ndamage from anxiety while all this other\nstuff works because that stuff takes\ntime then you don't need medication the\nreason that I recommend medication is\nbecause first of all sometimes people\nhave lifestyles where they can't do the\nother things the know\npharmacologic treatments for anxiety so\ndepending on what your life is like you\nmay not be able to do that stuff\nthe second reason is because there's a\ncertain acuity like so sometimes if\nsomeone is depressed and they're on the\ncusp of getting fired\nthey don't have six to eight months to\nstart doing all this front they have to\nlike do something now students is\nanother good example like if you're a\nsophomore in college and you're\ndepressed you don't have nine months of\nyou can't be depressed for two semesters\nbecause that's going to tank your GPA\nand then you're gonna have to deal with\nthat for the rest of your life so it's\nlike a very individual conversation\nabout your circumstances risks benefits\nand for you to make the right choice\nlike given all of these things and you\nshould probably also as part of that you\nknow anxiety evaluation get like certain\nlab tests and things like that because\nthe last thing that you want to do is be\ntalking to someone about your feelings\nwhen your thyroid hormone is way too\nhigh because that says the like it\ndepends in general it depends okay\ngenerally speaking I test a lot of stuff\nfor people with depression less stuff\nfrom people with anxiety okay because\nthey could just ask you other questions\nthat like if your thyroid was out of\nwhack like you'd have other symptoms too\nright\nokay that makes sense yeah it's\ninteresting you mentioned well I don't\nwant to tell my family that's probably\nnot something I should get into yeah\nfamily history that's why this isn't\nmedical advice right if I was your\ndoctor we would definitely have to talk\nabout that because there's no way to\nmake an accurate diagnosis without all\nof that information is the thyroid\nassociated with anxiety sure if it's too\nhigh interesting\nbut I don't yeah too low leads to\ndepression too high leads to anxiety\ninteresting but it's just interesting\nI'll share that with you off stream\nwhile that's interesting other time but\nyeah sure interesting\nshare it with an actual doctor bro yeah\nwell this but I don't like I've never\nhad like a psychologist or anything like\nthat it's more of like than a general\ngeneral care physician yeah but yeah\nit's more of like a like if not me\npersonally I don't know but see I don't\neven know if my my thyroid has been\nchecked about that sort of thing you can\ngeneral your primary care physician\nabout it yeah I thought that they would\njust do that in like a test given and\nalso like my mom and I shared the same\ndoctor for an extended period of time\nand they knew about my mom's history so\nI you would think but anyway sorry\nthat's probably another conversation\nyeah so here's what I just say real\nquick about that is that like there are\na lot of things that doctors should do\nand the reason that oftentimes they\ndon't do them is not because they're bad\ndoctors but because they've just got way\ntoo much other [ __ ] to do mmm-hmm and\nit's hard for them to analyze their\ntheir patients to the depth yeah so I\nthink it just sort of depends on like I\nthink it's good to have a conversation\nwith your doctor about it and like you\nknow can I tell you learn through this\nyeah my tendency to push things away and\nsay I'm not it's not a problem or try to\nlike be like it's not an issue I'm like\nmost of the time I'm good that tendency\nhas been communicate like because of\nthat it's how it's impacted the way I've\ncommunicated with doctors and people\nprofessionals and and people in my life\nso nobody really like I've pushed it off\nas an issue so I really haven't talked\nabout it and maybe that's a problem like\nI've talked about it but I haven't\nreally like yeah every time I about it I\npush up I'm like yeah I have these\nanxious things and it's really bad but\nbut like I can be I can still live my\nlife and I can still do things like so\nmaybe yes it's good that you recognize\nthat because as a doctor I can tell you\none of the most difficult things is\nhaving a patient who has a problem that\nthey met\nright so then like if they say like hey\nsometimes I get anxious and I'm like oh\ndoes it like how bad of a problem is it\nyou're like it's no big deal\nand I'm like spider I really thank you\nfor that because I didn't think about\njust like an epiphany I didn't even\nthink about it that way ever yeah what\nare they supposed to do with that they\nsupposed to take it as are they supposed\nto test your thyroid because you're kind\nof saying it's not that big of a deal\nright this anxiety have anything to do\nwith control sure wanting is that what\nit's all about like wanting control\nabout oh no I don't think so but I think\nthat control is one of the foods for\nanxiety that we talked about because if\nyou can control then you don't have to\nworry but it doesn't deal with the\nsource of the word mm-hmm right so like\nif you think about when you pull up the\ncell phone even though you're not\ncontrolling it's in the same vein as\ncontrolling right like you're like\ngiving yourself order around your fear\nto reduce your fear\nand so do pecan people get better like\nthat sass stupid question of course they\ncan but like I can't even in my head\nbeing so consciously aware of the\nproblem and like even being conscious of\nlike maybe even a solution to fix it\nit's hard for me to go through that like\nthe gymnastics to say that's going to\nget that's going to improve because I'm\nconscious of certain things okay let's\ntalk about this for a second you said\nthat's a stupid question is it a stupid\nquestion I guess not why not\nI'm thinking that's in my head and I'm\nthinking it good excellent great place\nto start so now the question becomes why\nare you thinking that because I feel\nlike if I'm aware of what's wrong I\nshould it shouldn't be a problem if I'm\naware of the problem why shouldn't why\nshould like why can't I fix it yeah so\nbeautiful so like I'm gonna phrase it a\ndifferent way I think that's a\nmanifestation of what I'm about to say\nthe reason it's not a stupid question is\nbecause you have no experience of having\nfixed yeah so why on earth would we\nexpect you to believe that something is\nfixable if you flipped it your entire\nlife yeah it's like telling a deaf\nperson like oh yeah you can hear and\nthey're like that sounds dumb and so if\nyou've lived with anxiety your entire\nlife it's completely normal to feel\nskeptical that this kind of change is\npossible because like in your brain like\nyou've been conditioned to have anxiety\nall the time and for it to be crippling\nand you did your research on the\ninternet and you looked at this and you\nlooked at this and you looked at this\nand you've been fighting against it for\ndecades and it's still there\nand we want to call you irrational for\nthinking it'll never go right nothing\nman\nit's completely rational and it happens\nto be the case that you can't get rid of\nit it's just I haven't taken those tiny\ndes take those steps I want to take\nthose steps sure cuz you know I'm sure\nmy audience sees it affects my people\ncall me you know I spent like one\nspecific example my professional life is\nmy tendency to be very almost too much\nwith the tos on Twitch because of\ngetting banned like I'm very very very\nvery very very aggressive in moderating\nthat and they see that but that's rooted\nin my anxiety surrounding making sure\nthat the platform stays up you know up\nand it doesn't go down or get banned or\nwhatever somebody doesn't say the wrong\nthing or somebody doesn't get hurt by\nwhat somebody says\nit's all rooted in that which is as now\nI've learned through this which is\nrational but\nit's so sorry it's so complicated but\nlike maybe\nor maybe I overreact a lot uncertain\nthings so here's what I'd leave you with\nAustin okay because I think we should\nprobably wrap up so the first thing is\nthat I want you to try to notice the for\nlack of a better term it may not really\nbe the voice of your mom but notice the\nvoice of your mom as it's up so like in\nthat moment where you're like concerned\nabout TOS is that Austin speaking or is\nthat Austin's mom speaking and then the\nnext thing to do is if it's Austin's mom\nthen see if you can like just listen to\nher words without doing anything about\nit as best as you can just sit with that\nfear and acknowledge to yourself that\nlike if you're on a plane and you're\nlike okay here we go again\nthis is the part of my mind that's gonna\nactivate and it's gonna be terrified\nabout all these things and if I open up\nmy cell phone and I look up things that\npart of me is gonna feel better and now\nthis is where people start to jump to\nconclusions and they say don't open up\nthe phone incorrect the most important\nthing is that you see like okay can I\nget away with not opening the phone or\ndoes this part of me really need this\nright now and if it really needs it like\nyou don't want to be an [ __ ] to that\npart of you like\ncuz there's a chance that there's a\nsix-year-old to whom something\ncatastrophic happened and now the\nsix-year-old is just paranoid because\nthey're afraid catastrophic things are\ngonna happen we don't want to be an\n[ __ ] to that six-year-old we got to\nunderstand that sometimes the\nsix-year-old needs things that are a\nlittle bit irrational and like aren't\ngreat in the long term but sometimes\nthey just need what they need because\nthey're six and so as fast as you can\njust play with that and sort of be like\nokay can I get away with not doing this\nor do I really need this and if you\nreally need it go ahead and do it and\nthen this becomes the important thing\nwatch what happens to the voice of your\nmom see where it goes does it go away\ndoes it feel better does it feel\nrelieved is she yelling at you about\nhelmets and then you put on your helmet\nand then she kind of calms down and the\nsecond take off your helmet again there\ncomes the yelling I put on my helmet I\nwent for a ride around the neighborhood\nwith my friends I came back and my my\nhelmet was off that's the jolt\nthat's the turbulence and then she comes\nout of the house and she starts yelling\nagain she turns on and she turns off so\nwhat happens when I do this start to\nbecome familiar with that part of your\nmind understand in what ways it works\nand it what ways it does it and it's\nthrough familiarity with who we are and\nhow we function that we gain control\nover ourselves we're living a life where\nwe're blind to like who we are we don't\nunderstand how we work and then we get\nconfused and we call ourselves\nirrational we have invalidated herself\nbecause it doesn't make sense because we\ndon't understand like no there's nothing\nabout you that is false like I don't\nknow how to say this but like reality is\nreal like you're real your thoughts are\nreal there are just thoughts they're not\nfacts they're not reality but they're\nthoughts you're real you actually exist\nthis is a problem that you have\nirrationality is just a lack of\nunderstanding because nothing in the\nworld is rational like people thought\nthat you know like gravity and all this\nkind of crap there's order everywhere\neconomics medicine physiology psychology\norders everywhere\nnothing is rational and the the better\nyou understand that you were like a\nhuman being and your mind can be\nunderstood your anxiety can be\nunderstood you just have to look at it\ncuz you've never looked at it you're so\nbusy judging it and dismissing it you\ngot to look at it in that\nzopi man because it's like it's like\nyou're trying to play league of legends\nwith a blindfold on and like you're just\ngetting bodied right and left like no\nwonder look I would get bodied if I\nplayed it at all but yeah yeah okay well\nthank you very much for allowing me to\ndo this it's been a tremendous\nexperience thank you to your audience\nand for listening it was sort of in the\nbeginning I was very anxious to say the\nleast to talk about it I feel very calm\nnow and collected yeah thank you very\nmuch so one last thought so people I\nsometimes let people slip away without\nmeditating do you met do you wanna learn\nmeditation are you interested in that do\nyou meditate I don't I'm open to\nanything\ndid you nose clogged you have like\nallergies yet I think I have allergies\nand [ __ ] is there a booger that looking\nat for the last no just just based on\nyour eye or by the Constitution I'm\nassuming that it's gonna be hard for you\nto do nasal breathing practices uh hold\non runny nose yeah yeah I think\nallergies yeah yeah I can it looks like\nallergies and anxiety are related by the\nway and I really yeah if your seasonal\nallergies as a kid it's just general\nlike a 2p kind of crap yeah like little\nscratchy throat I lost my voice I don't\nknow what's going on there but yeah can\nyou edge with allergies huh you lose\nyour voice with allergies have a raspy\nvoice generally no but I think you just\ngot a topic stuff going on do you have\nlike eczema and stuff to like dry skin\noily skin like different parts of your\nskin are all severe acne moderately\nsevere acne growing up so I tend on the\noily side but that was treated with yeah\naccutane anyway so I'm thinking that\nthat maybe nasal practices aren't gonna\nbe great but we're still gonna have to\nuse the nose cuz you're okay breathe at\nsome point yep so let me just think how\ndo you feel about chanting we haven't\ndone chanting in a while chanting yeah\nvery anxiety-provoking huh uh yeah it\nsounds it sounds scary but what it what\nwhat is the yes\nwhat is or is it so this is great so I'm\ngonna show you we're gonna do ohm\nGenting we haven't taught this in a\nwhile so we'll do it\nso ohm is composed of three syllables\nah-ooh and and so basically the way to\nthink about it is like if you start with\na completely open mouth let you cut out\nactually\n[Music]\ndo I stop no yeah so just go from like\nopen mouth to closed mouth right do you\nsee how it like that's the syllables Oh\nsir I'm so sorry you keep coming out so\nI don't know exist court discord does\nthis okay yes yeah it just keeps cutting\nout so I'm just like ah yeah I think\nthat's right you're cutting out for me\ntoo but okay so you know ah and then I\nshut my mouth\nyou go ah then you go ooh and then you\ngo mmm and then you shut your mouth yeah\nand then when you shut your mouth you go\nmm-hmm okay\ngreat yeah I think it's something with\nlike auto-detect voice algorithms with\ndiscord that we can't hear you either so\nbut so I do that but how long do I go\nI'm gonna demonstrate I'm gonna teach\nyou hold on let's start with this okay\nbecause I'm I know is gay is okay so\nwe're gonna do hold on\nvoice activity let's do push-to-talk\nokay I'm gonna hold on you can't hear me\nanymore\nso does this transmit better if I do\npush-to-talk\nlet's try\n[Music]\nyes okay great\nso I'm gonna demonstrate for you right\nhere you cuz your push-to-talk oh [ __ ]\nokay so I'm gonna demonstrate so I'm\ngonna show you one round okay so what I\nwant you to do is sit up straight take a\ndeep breath okay push-to-talk no no it's\nokay I'll transmit cuz it's okay the\nchat will follow me okay okay close my\neyes\nyeah so I'm gonna demonstrate first okay\nso I'm gonna demonstrate two rounds so\nI'm gonna take a deep breath in\n[Music]\nand one more time okay and we'll talk\nbefore we have you do it mm-hmm as I can\nsee you're anxious to never try you know\ndon't try not to be anxious the whole\npoint of this is that we want you to be\nanxious I'll explain that in a second\none more one more observation okay\nwhy do I feel compelled that like giggle\ngiggle I can't hear you sorry doctor\ngiggle like Vacon you're doing it\nI laugh but I didn't want to be\ndisrespectful yes oh man as I know this\nis like an actual thing didn't giggle oh\nokay we're gonna do it again\nwhat now that you say that now I'm not\ngonna laugh so that's like no no just\ngiggle just see what happens\nnotice notice it within yourself and\njust do whatever you want with it okay\nwe're gonna be one more time\nyou can giggle if you want to no big\ndeal yeah I don't I don't need you\nprobably cuz there you know let's see\nokay ready\n[Laughter]\n[Music]\nhere go no see that's so you taught me\nanother thing is when when you can like\ncall out the fact that you have a\ntendency to laugh on something that\nmaybe you shouldn't be laughing at and\nthat what's what was interesting is I\nfelt like I shouldn't be laughing at\nthat but I didn't find it funny it was\njust that I was laughing at the fact\nthat I shouldn't laugh\nis that weird yeah and then when we call\nattention to it you gain awareness of it\nand I tell you to giggle what happens to\nyour desire to giggle you be giggle\nanymore that's what you need to do with\nyour anxiety just goes away if you look\nat it it just goes away that's the whole\n[ __ ] point okay so now we're gonna do\nthat with chanting and what I want you\nto do is pay attention to your anxiety\nbecause everyone else is gonna be\ngiggling at you got it right you see\nthat I might give it's gonna be silly\nand they're gonna laugh at you awesome\nbecause Austin is a silly boy okay okay\nright and so notice that feeling in\nyourself and then close your eyes and\nwhat I want you to do is take a deep\nbreath in and I'll walk you through it\nokay and then what I want you to do is\ndon't focus on the sound focus on their\nnecks good especially did it need to be\nfunny for you to laugh don't control it\ndon't dismiss it none of that okay okay\nokay so notice it within yourself and\nthen when when you're chanting I don't\nwant you to focus on the sound focus on\nthe vibration I want you to pay\nattention to where in your body do you\nfeel the sound okay okay it's fine smile\nokay so close your eyes sit up straight\nokay deep breath in\nah\n[Music]\nthere it is okay good\nwe're gonna do it again eyes closed no\nbreaking character that's the only thing\nokay you can giggle but no opening the\neyes okay just keep keep if I giggle\njust like in a performance of any kind\nyou just go you move forward you just\nyeah you just giggle but sit with your\ngiggling with your eyes closed\nmake giggling your meditation if that's\nwhat happens okay so we're gonna do it\nagain so deep breath in\n[Music]\ngood again deep\n[Music]\nlook at the silliness for a second just\nlook at it\neyes closed its reopening silly again\nthird time\n[Music]\nokay it takes a little bit is that\nnormal that's fine we're gonna do three\nmore\nno talking eyes closed no talking\ngiggling is allowed observing equaling\nis allowed nothing else is allowed okay\nthree more in succession okay\nso I'm just gonna do a breath chant\nbreath chant breath chant after the\nthird chant we're gonna just remain\nsilent no talking no opening your eyes\nfeel the person that you are when your\nleft over okay here we go\nyou\nagain\n[Laughter]\n[Music]\nthird one make it count\n[Laughter]\n[Music]\ndon't stop it just be\ngood eyes closed just feel it feel\nyourself\nyou\nwe'll do this for about another 30\nseconds okay\ntry to feel the residual sensation of\nvibration\nI don't want\nyou\nand now we're going to take a couple of\ndeep breaths so I want you to breathe in\nfor three seconds and out for three\nfor three and out for five so slow it\ndown\nand then in four three and out for seven\nreal slow\nand when you're ready open your eyes\nthat was actually I feel very calm\nwhen I was\nwas nervous in the beginning because I\nwas afraid that laughing was\ninappropriate\nand like it just feels very like I feel\nvery relaxed\nwhat happened to the anxiety it's gone\nfor now but yes it's gone in this moment\nyeah yeah but wasn't it there before we\nstarted the practice yes when did it go\nit went away after this was after like I\nacknowledged through this process that\nit was okay to laugh\nin this moment I could giggle I could I\ncould chuckle it the fact that we were\ngoing on and then I acknowledge that and\nthen is that is that the practice is\nthat literally is this is this something\nthat you find people giggling at all the\ntime or is it just like my personal\nexperience with it or maybe it's\nirrelevant but yes that's the right\nthing it's irrelevant okay because it\ndoesn't matter really it worked for me\nso why would I care about it\nyes Austen and and here's the thing so\nthere's a couple of really important\nthings about this practice what have you\ncognitively been doing for the last two\nhours\nlike what's what's that thing that you\ncatch yourself doing that I taught you\nat the beginning um\nI catch myself like trying to tell like\nexplain that like it's like it's not a\nbig problem\nor things aren't a big problem or all\nkinds of all kinds of restrictions of\nwho you are what you think and what you\nfeel\nand there's that restriction with the\ngiggling if you can learn how to giggle\nall of those restrictions are gonna go\naway you can just be you\nthat's the whole [ __ ] point\npeople think like oh you shouldn't\nlaughter in meditation what do you guys\nthink the pointless laughing during\nmeditation is like the best outcome it's\nnot serious\nlike what are we doing this for\nIsland\nbliss if you could laugh during\nmeditation when Zen masters become\nenlightened the first thing that they do\nis laugh so laugh let it out buddy just\nlet yourself like if it's silly like go\nfor it\nsilliness is irrational it's the nature\nof irrationality so who the [ __ ] cares\nembrace it laugh be at peace let\nyourself be yourself thank you you're\nwelcome in that was you I really think\nwhat you're doing is tremendous yeah\nthank you you're welcome bro take care\nof you take care of dr. K thank you so\nmuch I guess\nall righty"
