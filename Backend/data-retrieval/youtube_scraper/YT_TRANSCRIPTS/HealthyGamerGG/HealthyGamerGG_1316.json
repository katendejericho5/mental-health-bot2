    "transcript": "thanks I'm nervous everyone is nervous\nhave you seen other people say that uh I\nI think so yeah everybody's nervous what\nare you nervous about um talking in\ngeneral uh uh talking is hard yeah yeah\nyeah yeah yeah it's it's I think it's\ncompletely normal to be nervous would it\nhelp you to hear that I'm nervous too or\nwould that make things worse I don't\nknow I think it's funny yeah because\nlike I don't know what we're talking\nabout mm-hmm and like what if I don't\nsay the right thing oh it's okay I don't\nalways say the right thing either but I\nfeel like you have a very good way of\nsaying things so I know that's why I'm\nnervous right because people come on and\nthey have this expectation that I have a\ngood mood saying things mm-hmm and so\nlike the only thing I can do is\ndisappoint\nnope I don't think so I think you're\ngood no matter what yeah so if I were to\ntell you that what would you say I think\nyou're God you are him you know what you\nbring to the table is what you bring to\nthe table that's cool yeah see that's a\nproblem that I kinda have yeah I have I\nthink I have a bit of impostor syndrome\nhere when it comes to that yeah so tell\nus about that\nis that what you want to talk about\ntoday are you gonna talk about something\nelse\nI I could talk about anything yeah what\ndo you want to talk about\n[Music]\nyeah that's like something we could talk\nabout because it's something that like\noccurs a lot yeah so what do you mean by\nimposter syndrome\nor maybe it's not that but um basically\nwhenever someone tries to like tell me\nthat I'm like doing really well or that\nI'm\nmmm performing all of something or like\ndoing well like whether it's this or\nthat I always attribute it to not really\nbeing because of me um I think mostly\nhuh\nyeah sorry good oh I think it's mainly\njust like the people I'm surrounded by\nwho like carrying me a lot you get\ncarried that's how I feel you're the new\nband and you're with a bunch of pro\nplayers yes yes together sorry I\nprobably speak a lot in league terms or\nthink a lot if that's okay we won't hold\nit yeah so then what what are you envy\num what am i yeah like what are you\nplaying week oh I play ad carry really\nplay but yeah so you're the carry oh but\num oh no don't know that's just the\nleads in real life what are ya what's\nyour what's your league position in real\nlife in real life I feel like I'm kind\nof like a I feel like a support I feel\nlike I try to like run around and be\nthere for everyone as best I can\nyeah you know what I am in league but\nI'm a minion I just I just run down a\nparticular Lane mindlessly and get\nfarmed by other people um it's okay I'm\npretty much the same I'm pretty much\nlike like a cannon minion if anything\nthis yeah maybe it's worse why is it I\nthought a candid minion was better yeah\nI don't know\ngive me mr. busy there you go messing it\nup again no one's around to carry you\nnow\nYvonne yeah exactly yes me so it sounds\nlike but it does sound like you try to\nhelp other people a lot uh yeah I think\nso yeah\ncan you at least know about that I guess\nit's just kind of what I do a TV I try\nto like be there for everyone they need\nhelp or whatever the company needs help\nwith so yeah it's just like I try to\ntill I get everything done and make\neveryone happy mm-hmm\ntry to make everyone happy well it also\nmakes me happy seeing they're happy\nbecause I care about them a lot okay so\nit sounds like you really do care I hope\nso yeah you hope so yeah I mean oh yeah\nI I think I care a lot do you think you\ncare a lot how would you know I'm just\num I know I think there are a lot\ncircumstances where if it wasn't them or\nyeah if it cuz it feel like in this what\nup for what I do I really have to like\nthe people to like what I do well that's\nwhy um just like interact with them\neveryday and like live with them and\nlike yeah just working with people like\neveryday I feel like you sort of have to\nlike them or like what your life\nwouldn't be very like great or you ain't\nlike your job at all if you didn't\nYvonne would you describe your life is\ngreat\nnot so much right now it's okay what\nwhat makes it so it sounds like that\nquestion maybe you seem a little bit\nmore nervous what are you feeling right\nnow when I asked I feel really nervous\nyeah something changed you were talking\na little bit more openly so like what\ndid you feel when I asked you that\nquestion um I think it's like\noverwhelming a lot what's been happening\non like social media or like um I also\nkind of got out of a relationship lately\nthat's been like\nreally turbulent for my emotions um yeah\nso there's just like a whole spectrum of\nthings that's been like I guess\noverwhelming in like this time period\nbecause it feels very I guess it feels\nlike a there's a lot going on in such a\nshort amount of time\nsure yeah I mean that sounds incredibly\noverwhelming like just too much to\nhandle all at once it's sort of like\nyou're your ADC is in ting and you're\ntop lane or DC or it's actually yeah\npretty much there's a lot of stressful\nthings that's just like every Lane is\nfalling apart and you're supported\nyou're trying to you're trying to like\nyour mid laner to like gone off to a bad\nstart and ganked by bitter jungler and\nthen your top laner DC lead and then\nyour ADC is ending chaos everywhere yeah\nand it's like you can't fix everything\nset Hatfields\nI'm trying to it's like I'm I'm like\nslowly like fixing things one by one\nsort of thing wow that's actually pretty\nimpressive because most people just\ncrumble under the pressure I feel like a\nlot of things are like either a with\ntime it's better or like who you learn\nto like manage it better after\nexperiencing a lot of things so cool\nyeah that's you sound like you're quite\na resilient person maybe I never thought\nof myself that way how do you think\nyou're of yourself\n[Music]\nit's a hard question sounds simple yeah\nI don't really know yeah it's like I\njust want to just call your attention to\nsomething so it's kind of weird right\nthat we like think about ourselves in we\nknow in which ways we don't think about\nourselves but we don't know how we think\nabout ourselves mm-hmm you don't see\nyourself as resilient you're pretty sure\nabout that but you're not quite sure how\nyou see yourself which is like a weird\nway to live life but that's actually\ncompletely normal we don't really know\nwe don't think about who we are so maybe\nwe could try to figure out how you do\nthink about yourself so some of so one\nthing to just acknowledge right is so it\nsounds like you think about yourself as\nless than what other people see yeah I\nwould say that for sure yeah so we can\njust let's put a pin in that for a\nsecond what's it like to think about\nyourself as less than what other people\nsee I feel like I don't believe anything\nthat people say so\nwhenever they say like for example oh\nyou're like channel is doing really well\nor anything I feel like a lot of it is\nnot because of me it's because of like\num all the really great people like\naround me and I also feel like whenever\nthey say like my\nif they say like my work ethic is really\ngood I feel like that's just what you\nshould be doing most of the time it's\njust like regular work um like if\nsomeone hired you for something or if\nlike you're working at like an company\nIQ just be doing what you're told or\nlike okay stuff like that which i think\nis just like basic\ncan I just repeat back a little bit of\nwhat I heard sure sounds like you've got\na pretty high evasion rate for\nappreciation yeah I think so\nit's kind of weird huh yeah like people\ntrying to tell you that you're doing a\ngood job you're like dodged easy yeah I\nthink so and it's still nice to hear but\nlike um I just remember my friend\nwalking up to me at a party and then he\nwas like wow we've on like your channels\nYouTube channels doing really well and\nI'll just I felt zero like\ncredit for it I felt like\nI didn't feel that much happiness\nhearing it I ever Fenny what did you\nfeel\num the first thing I just said was oh\nyeah but it's not me mm-hmm yeah so how\nlong have you felt that it isn't you for\nlike a long time\nI don't know exactly how long but yeah\nit's been like that for a bit have you\nfelt that way before you started\nstreaming ah no but that's pretty\ndifferent because before such screaming\nI was just playing games and I wasn't\nthere's like no one there's no like\nnumbers to measure your success or like\nany type of stuff like that\nit was just like I'm just playing video\ngames after work and like that's it\nsure and and so what affected his\nnumbers to measure your success huh hmm\nI don't know but I feel like in our\nindustry it's like a lot of people look\nat the numbers um I don't find myself\nhaving that much value towards the\nnumbers especially nowadays I feel like\nthey're very hollow to me and they're\njust like I feel more I put more\nemphasis on if I'm happy or not and I\nthink like if I'm just doing what I\nenjoy I don't really care like how much\nnumbers or whatever I put out are you\nhappy\nin terms of like what I'm doing yeah I\nget to like play fret play games with my\nfriends every day and like that's what I\nenjoy I think I'm unhappy if I don't\nhave friends to play with okay so\nearlier I asked you if your life was\ngreat and you said it's okay and so let\nme just pause for a moment and think\nthrough what I'm hearing and then you\nlet me know if we're kind of on the same\npage so there are a couple of\ncircumstances like so you mentioned that\nwhat's going on right now and I don't\nknow exactly what you're referring to\nbut I'd love to hear more about that the\nsecond thing you said is that there's a\nlot of turbulent emotion around a\nbreakup so those are sort of like maybe\ntemporary D buffs right or like you know\nthey're like conditions like weather\npatterns that may clear over time mm-hmm\nbut I'm also getting some sense that you\nknow there's something that isn't\ntemporary somewhere along the way you\nstarted to think that like you know the\nnumbers and people's appreciation and\nyour value the value that people see\ndoesn't like fit with what you see yeah\nthat doesn't feel quite as temporary to\nme that feels like it's sort of baked in\nwhat do you think mm-hmm\nyeah I agree so now then what I see is a\nfork in the road so what we can do is we\ncan talk about what's baked in right\nlike where do you get the I like how can\nI say this so you have a particular\nimpression of yourself and when someone\ntries to appreciate you you dodge right\nyeah it's like instant rejection almost\nand I can't help it exactly so then like\nif we think about that the reason that\nyou're dodging is because it doesn't fit\nwhich means in turn that you have a\nparticular perception of yourself right\nso then the question becomes where did\nyou learn what you are like how did you\nlearn that so we can talk about that so\nwe can talk about the over like the the\nidea of like how you view yourself and\nlike where that comes from or what we\ncan do is talk a little bit about sort\nof the effects of what's going on right\nnow as you put it or the effects of the\nbreak-up and because those two things\ncould be related like sometimes when\npeople break up with people like when\nthere's a breakup going on their sense\nof self-worth takes a hit and it becomes\nharder for them to appreciate it to\naccept the appreciation of others mmm I\nthink we could go with what's going on\nright now and the breakup okay cool\nlet's do that first okay see if we have\ntime for the other one so tell me which\none of those do you want to talk about\nfirst the breakup or what's going on\nright now\nI'm not sure which order is better or if\nthere is one yeah okay maybe we can just\ndo it in the order that you mentioned\nthem okay\nwould you venture first uh things that's\ngoing on right now cool how nervous are\nyou by the way um look I'm like shaking\na bit yeah yeah so do you want to just\nthink about that for a second should we\nhelp you with that uh I think it's okay\nI think he's just like\nnervous to talk about of it okay sure so\nlet's let's give it a shot and if you're\nstill feeling pretty nervous we can\npause and try to help you with your\nnervousness that's not okay yeah yeah\nbecause I you know if you're gonna be\nnervous for an hour and a half that's\ngonna be rough man no no I mean like I\nthink no matter what I'll feel a little\nnervous but just like you know talking\nabout stuff especially having you out\nthere it's just like a little\nintimidating okay\nlet me ask you one last question to\nderail you because you're you're just\ngetting your feet steady under you yeah\num do you view yourself as a courageous\nperson um no but I am trying to like do\na lot of things this year to like push\nmyself out of my comfort zone yeah is\nthis one of them um kind of it's like\nnot something I feel like I had to like\nreally like muster myself up to do it's\nsomething that like I've listened like\nwatched a lot of your videos or streams\nand like I like really want to like have\na talk with you so it's like something I\nwanted to do it wasn't something that I\nwas like to like force myself to do okay\nso now I have another question what did\nyou want to talk to me about why did you\nwant to come on here um I kind of just I\nhave this is it uh I never felt like I\nneeded to talk to someone maybe until I\nwas going through like a huge debate in\nterms of my relationship and then also I\nguess that was a main thing that is done\nfrom um because I want to like learn\nabout myself more so that I could kind\nof have a better idea of like what I\nwant or like what I can do for myself\nthis year like stuff like that cool man\nthat's um\nI feel inspired listening to you it's\nthat weird I know it's it's confusing\nright so sorry because I'm probably\nmaking you more nervous because here\ncomes nomination so get ready like\nyou're about to dodge yeah ready ready\nfor it I mean so I think it's really\ncool that you noticed that your life was\nnot what you wanted it to be and you\nthought intentionally about how you can\nmake it different from what it is hmm\nlike basically what I think is inspiring\nis that you chose not to live on\nautopilot right like for a moment like\nit's like a minion is on autopilot\nyou're just gonna run down like we're\njust gonna live life and just just you\nknow that's what we're gonna do we're\nnot gonna think we're not gonna switch\nlanes we're not gonna adapt relationship\nis relationship let's just go\nand then here's Yvonne who's kind of\nlike well maybe I should think about\nlike I'm not sure if this relationship\nis right for me like maybe I should move\nlanes and then like what's the goal like\nwhy am I playing this game of life like\nwhat do I want out of life like that's\nactually pretty cool what do you think\nabout that um I think it comes from like\nwhat bothers me about other people I\nthink something that bothers me is like\nwhen I hear someone complaining a lot\nand they don't do anything to then and\nthey don't try to do anything about it\nlike there are some things that are out\nof your control but the things that are\nin your control I feel like if you could\ndo something to change what you're\ncomplaining about then you should or at\nleast like have the effort to sure so\nyeah I just wanted to like get help with\nthat I guess like cool yourself up do\nyou view yourself as a complainer um I\nrant but if I complain about something I\nwill try to solve it at least\nI hope I'm like that like I try I think\nI'm like that yeah yeah interesting yeah\nI mean so that sounds like a positive\nquality like it sounds like something\nthat's something that you respect and\nappreciate about yourself hmm\nI think so I never thought of that\nspecifically I just know I don't like\nthat about other people when they do it\nso I try not to do but I may not be I'm\nnot perfect so maybe I still complain\nand not fix things you know yeah I don't\nthink anyone thinks you're perfect but\nyou know at the same time I was just\nkind of thinking that sometimes what\nbothers us and other people is what we\nsee in ourselves mm-hmm like sometimes\nthat's the case do you think that's the\ncase here\nmmm not so much I think it's because I\ndo that that it bothers me maybe one\nother I see other people not doing that\nokay maybe we can come back to that\nsecond sorry that I I'm kind of bouncing\nthe conversation around like oh no yeah\nand so okay so you were saying you know\nyou were debating about something about\nyour relationship and that's why you\nwanted to come on I'm just gonna try to\ntoss out one more compliment that you\ncan dodge would you would you consider\nyourself I mean so I I think what you're\ndoing is courageous what do you think\nwhat um what am i doing like oh come on\nstreet talking about it\n[Music]\nyeah I know it's not maybe what's\nhappening in your head let's let's look\noh yeah it's a party that's dodging\nthere's party like no yeah like it like\nyes but it doesn't feel curry just to me\nbecause I don't I think it maybe more so\nto other people I guess I'm not as\nafraid to me I'm just like okay okay\nit's it's not as heart you don't really\nit's not that you discount your\ncourageousness it's just like actually\nit's not that hard for you to come on\nyeah yeah yeah exactly\nokay cool so that doesn't that doesn't\nfeel to me that you're really dodging\nthe compliment or appreciation so much\nas you just don't really think it's that\napplicable yeah okay I can live with\nthat so maybe we should talk about can\nyou tell us what debate you were having\nabout your relationship um so I there's\nkind of a timeline I guess um I started\ndating my first boyfriend when I was\nlike 16 and that relationship last hit\nlike seven years and then it was like a\nmonth or so like not too long afterwards\nI got into my next relationship that\nlasted another almost seven years and\nbut he was just like really too good to\nlike kind of pass up at the time like I\njust met him and I was like go out this\nperson's like\namazing like he's so different from my\nex he was just like um and I guess like\nthe debate I got was this person is like\nif I like he did he was like everything\nI would have wanted in someone um he\nlike said and did all like the right\nthings and what are the right mmm like\nhe would and whenever I was stressed he\nwould always ask me like oh like what\ncan I do to help like he like health\nisn't a lot and sounds like he was\nsupportive mm-hmm he's like he's super\nsuper supportive and almost like\nanything that I do or yeah ever anything\nthat I do and he's like really funny and\nhe all my anyone that all my friends\nlike really like him there's he just\nlike gets along with everyone and he's\nlike a really good person and I guess um\nso for a really long time I never felt\nlike I was really happy and it wasn't\nyou felt like you you were really happy\num being with him is I'm very happy but\nfor myself it's like I felt like more\nwithin this year that um more\nreoccurring thoughts would happen where\nI wonder what would be like if I was on\nmy own because I was in a relationship\nsince I was 16 pretty much\nand like I've never gotten the chance to\nbe like independent I don't know what I\nam like on my own I've always had\nsomeone else there and I felt like such\na strong need for independence despite\nhaving being with someone who was like\nso great um Wow\nso it was like something that it felt\nlike a missing puzzle piece that I would\nlike never experience or have if I would\njust date with this person forever um I\nneeded I it was like something that\nbefore I kind of brushed off and then it\nbecame more and more like in my face as\nit like popped up in my thoughts and\nmore and then I felt like I just really\nneeded to know like what it's like to\ntruly be like on my own and how I grow\nas a person and what when you say it\nsort of\ncome in your face what does that look\nlike um like I just had more and more\nthoughts I kept thinking about like I\nwant to like know what it's like\nlike I I don't know what I'd be what\nit's like at all for me to be on my own\nand like having to tackle problems on my\nown or like how it grow as a person I\nthink in like your early years you have\na lot of like finding yourself or like\nexploring or like experiencing things\nthat help you grow a lot and I feel like\nwhen you say God knows what what ages\nare we talking about just to clarify I\nfeel like in your early 20s okay you\nhave like a lot that of like I guess\nthings that just shape who you are as a\nperson and helps you grow so yeah yeah\nso you feel like you kind of missed out\non that I guess being in a relationship\nI don't know if I\never like like I just don't know I would\njust never know what what's what am I\nlike\nwithout someone that's just it yeah so\ncan I just point out like an interesting\nkind of connection that my mind is\nmaking so earlier I had asked you like\nyou know you'd said that you're you\ndon't view yourself Brazil is resilient\nand I asked how do you view yourself and\nyou're like I don't know and I'm just\nwondering whether what you're talking\nabout\nmaybe is part of the reason that you\ndon't know who you are because you've\nalways sort of existed in relation to\nsomeone else mm-hmm and you don't know\nyou know in a sense it's kind of like\nyou know you're duo queueing for\neverything and so the challenge is like\nif you're duo queueing you never really\nknow like what your skill is means\nyou've always yeah you know it's like\nyou're never solo queueing so like\nmm-hmm and and sure you're gonna hit a\nparticular rank but like how much of\nthat is like you being carried and like\nyou doing the carry mm-hmm is that how\nyou feel um not too much in terms of\nlike I never felt like I was getting\ncarried by someone in terms of in terms\nof like relationships hmm um my first\nboyfriend was just someone that I met\nwhile I was in high school and he was my\nfirst boyfriend so we end up dating for\na really long time because it's like\nyou're an experienced you try to make it\nwork do you like it's like a very naive\nlike I really wanted like my first\nboyfriend to like our last boyfriend yes\nhave a thought but then it was kind of\nlike saying really wasn't working\nthere's no way like you hit the point\nwhere you're like do I want to be with\nthis person for the rest of my life and\nbecause I do you break up for you're\nwith them forever right so that's\nthere's no you got to get out now and I\njust just mustered it up and it was like\none of the hardest things ever had to do\nbecause he was all I knew for like seven\nyears I was so attached as family and we\nhad mutual friends and everything yeah\nso your lives have been kind of in tank\ntogether yeah but like with my most\nrecent boyfriend I was like he gave me\nso much freedom and I um could do like\nwhatever pretty much like he didn't\nreally hold me back from doing anything\nbut it's just like the fact of the\nmatter is that I've just been in a\nrelationship for life alas how many\nyears and I just never got to be on my\nown\nbut that is a conflicting part because\nit's like he's so good but um I I just\nwas like it felt like Miss timing yeah\nso what is what is the appeal of\nindependence like in your mind what was\nit that you wanted from being not what\ndid you I don't even know if there's\nlike something that I want in particular\nit's more like than not knowing what\nit's like period I think I never got to\nexperience it's like missing on like the\nexperience and like how I could be as a\nperson or what I'd be on my own\ninteresting\nhmm and so so can are you still with\nyour boyfriend or is that no nein no so\nhow did that how did that happen\n[Music]\nit's something we I brought up to him\nlike during Christmas and then it kind\nof like you know I kind of like brushed\nit off and I could tell like he didn't\nwant to break up obviously so he also\nlike um tried to like just be like yeah\num but then yeah what Oh like kind of\nlike um he was just like saying I can't\nremember what he said to be honest but\nis something that along the lines of\nlike I could tell he was trying to just\nbe like yeah but we're like you know\nwe're we're good together\nokay it's just kind of like that um and\nthen and I agreed but it was just like a\nthought that just kept surfacing and\nthere's to the point where like I know\nthat if I stay with him I will think\nwhether it's a year down the line 20\nyears down the line 20 foot like 30\nyears down the line that like I still\nwould wonder what it would have been\nlike to be on my own and so I didn't\nwant to like\nbe with him but still have those\nthoughts I needed to just know what it's\nlike and so it sounds like you wanted to\navoid a life of regret\nyes oh yeah pretty much\nand that you would have regretted\nstaying with him um I don't know if I\nwould have regretted staying with him\nbut I would have just regretted like not\nknowing\nand not knowing that I'll not be yeah\nyeah yeah but yeah I think it's an\nimportant distinction that what you\nactually regret is not knowing what\nIndependence feels like mm-hmm-hmm this\nis tricky upon yeah it's real tricky\nyeah what I'm hearing from you is like\nit sounds like you understood that you\nhad something that was valuable and good\nmm-hmm that's what made it super hard\nand that's why I wanted to talk to\nsomeone because it's like\nhe's totally someone that I would see\nmyself with and then and be happy with I\nlike it just felt like I'm missing like\nI just I just needed it sure of it\nand so what what happened next um and\nthen uh we tried talking still for a bit\nto keep in touch and then it's just too\nhard because like my emotions are too\nturbulent whenever I get a message from\nhim or um anything like that it like\nyeah so so after Christmas you guys kind\nof broke up or no this was a this was\nlike in um we broke up right at the\nstart of June okay and and so when you\nsay you broke up so what what how did\nthat go\nit feels bad it feels like I'm kind of\nbeing I'm being selfish um everyone\naround me feel sad for us feels super\nsad like Oh a lot of people say they're\ngetting like secondhand depression just\nfrom listening to because it feels like\nwe're like we love each other so much\nbut it's like almost like we have to be\na part sort of thing\nso it feels very tragic like sad sounds\ntragic yeah so I've been having a hard\ntime especially the past like a couple\nof weeks to be like happy but like it's\nbeen obviously I know it's like a time\nthing I know as time goes on like it\nwould be better but it was just harder\nthere's a couple of weeks and like he\nmessaged me once and he came over once\nto like just give me a cake and then\nlike I I felt so sad it was like the day\nthat I finally felt better and then he\ncame over and then I was like oh my god\nit's like everyone was sad like the\npeople in my house were sad and like\nyeah how does it feel like to be someone\nwho takes care of everyone and then make\neveryone sad\nit felt like I hated that I was like a\nnegative energy I felt like a because I\nwas sad I was like exerting a bunch of\nlike sad energy and they all told me it\nwas okay but it felt bad because\nnormally I'm the one who's like I Vince\nI feel like I've been so like stable\nkind of throughout all the years like I\nnever felt sad or depressed I've always\nbeen like content and like pretty like\nrelatively like chill you know kind just\nlike a lot low like yeah yeah and this\nwas I guess the time where I felt like I\nwas very I was more negative or more\nlike sad\nI don't like exerting that energy at\nleast for too long and two weeks felt\nlong yeah so let's ask so let me ask you\na couple questions about that so the\nfirst is is that okay um I think so\nbecause I know it's only temporary\nI wouldn't want to like be a negative\nball of energy for like a long long\nperiod of time but like it feels good\nnow that like knowing after like two to\nthree weeks like I feel like it's\ngetting better mm-hmm okay yeah so the\nnext question I have for you is do you\nthink you were selfish\nI don't think so but in this case I feel\nlike I am because\nI think it's because\nI know he doesn't want to break up\nthat I feel like it's a little selfish\nand that\nwe could get back together in like a\nyear from now or whatever and it'd be\nlike him waiting or whatever even though\nI'm not asking him to and that feels\nlike selfish because I know him I kind\nof feel like he would wait regardless\nuntil he knew like there's no chance\n[Music]\nyeah so it feels like selfish in that\nregard\nis that okay\nI think that's okay and\nsomething bad happens in between or like\nyeah um I did I don't think it would be\nokay if I started seeing someone else\nwhat do you alright you just lost me for\na second so so what would not be okay\nabout that because he's waiting for you\n[Music]\nwhat's up cuz I would hurt him or what\nokay so you don't think it's okay so let\nme just share a couple of thoughts so\nfirst of all so you got it you got to\nlike let me finish okay cuz I'm gonna\nsay some things but sometimes I say some\nthings that sound hurtful but it's\nreally not my intention\nso first thing is I think what you did\nwas selfish and I also think that that's\ncompletely okay so I think sometimes we\nforget and and know that did I just\nbody you there was that hard to hear\nokay no so I think sometimes we forget\nlike so we have this idea of like who we\nare right and Yvonne is the person that\ntakes care of other people she's the\nperson who supports our you're the\nsupport right and then they're their\ntakers and they're givers and sometimes\nwe go through life thinking that we're a\ngiver and so it can be really hard to\nlike be a taker because that's not who\nyou are and so like it's funny because\nwe kind of say you know we treat\nselfishness like a bad thing because in\na sense it is bad but I don't think the\nworld is quite that black-and-white like\nI think anytime you break up in a\nrelationship where the other person\ndoesn't want to break up because you're\nnot happy that's selfish and also I\nthink it's fine right like as human\nbeings you know it's it's okay and I\nthink this is a big problem that a lot\nof people have that like it's okay to\nyou know put yourself first I don't\nthink you should put yourself first all\nthe time I don't think that you should\nyou know\nI think you should be careful about I\nthink the most important thing is that\nyou're intentional and aware of when\nyou're putting yourself first and when\nyou're not putting yourself first the\nbiggest problems I've ever seen in\nrelationships and we are when people are\nnot aware of like when they're being\nselfish and when they are like when\nsomeone doesn't when someone thinks that\nthey're being selfless and they're\nactually being selfish like that's what\ntanks a relationship for one person to\nsay hey this doesn't work for me right\nnow and I need to like put myself first\nI think that's fine and is it gonna hurt\nanother person yes and that's actually\nokay - I don't think that we can live\nour lives controlling I mean there's\ncertainly some things that we can do\nthat can hurt other people but I think\nsome of that is on them and some of that\nis on us mm-hmm and I'm not saying that\nyou know you can't hurt another person\nbecause you clearly can and maybe that's\nwhen you refer to what's going on right\nnow I think that's what we see yeah and\nso I'm not saying that you know you you\ncan't hurt like of course you can hurt\nanother human being but I think you know\nsome of that is like their investment\nand their attachment to the relationship\nis what's gonna cause them hurt and and\nsometimes I think it is okay to end a\nrelationship that your partner doesn't\nwant to end because it's not working for\nyou because that's just sort of that's\nlife\nright mm-hmm what do you think about all\nthat that makes sense\nbetter than what was in my head what was\nin your head oh I just felt bad and I\nfelt like\nOh\nI just felt bad\nhe asked me if like what I'm\ndoing feels fair\nand I guess it does feel like it's fair\nto me but not him sure and I agree and\nwhat I'm saying is that sometimes it's\nokay to be unfair in a relationship like\nthat's this is a crazy thing is like you\nknow we try to be perfect but I think\nthat like life is muddy right when\nyou're playing League of Legends like\nsometimes you get damaged it's part of\nthe game you know it's it's like and and\nis it unfair to him absolutely\nand sometimes I think that that's okay\nwhich is weird because like a lot of\ntimes we tie together like we assume\nthat unfairness does unacceptable\nmmm-hmm which is like a really really\ninteresting nuance and that we feel like\neveryone has to be fair all the time but\nin my experience of relationships like\nrelationships are frequently unfair and\neven the healthiest ones are frequently\nvery unfair and generally speaking we\nhope that over time that there's\nfairness over the aggregate but like\nhe's invested a lot in the relationship\nit sounds like he's been very supportive\nit sounds like he's been a good person\nhe's been nice to your friends he's he's\nreally supported you and so it kind of\nfeels like he kind of got screwed mm-hmm\nyou know cuz because you're and I'm not\ntrying to beat you up here but I think I\nthink it's important to call it what it\nis because like from his perspective\nhe's invested seven years into this\nrelationship and like the hardest thing\nfrom his perspective is he's not doing\nanything wrong yeah like it's so easy to\nare not so easy but it comes way easier\nto break up with someone and be broken\nup with if you [ __ ] up in some way\nyeah yeah but like what the [ __ ] he did\neverything right yeah and I'm gonna be a\nlittle bit hyperbolic here so you know\nlet me know if your feelings get hurt\nbut I'm just gonna hmm you're kind of\nbeing neutral and kind of quiet and so\nwhen you're when people are neutral I\ntend to show more emotion okay so let me\nknow if you feel judged but he's like\nwhat the [ __ ] yeah yeah I don't like\nyou're breaking up with me when I've\nsupported you for seven years and like\nyou're dumping me because you need\nindependence mm-hmm like why don't you\ntell me when you were 24 so I\nmoved on with my life you know what\nthat's not he feels and that's a fair\nway to feel mm-hmm and just because he\nfeels like it's unfair doesn't mean that\nyou can't break up with it mm-hmm no\nthank you\njust one of those things that feels bad\nbut you know it is what it is yeah\ndo people yeah so you seem like okay\nwith this mm-hmm fry that's impressive\nwhat Oh but uh-oh is is it yeah I think\nit's really hard to so I think a lot of\npeople feel a lot of people have trouble\ntolerating the idea that they did\nsomething that was unfair to another\nperson and they actually knew all kinds\nof mental gymnastics to convince\nthemselves that it was fair that's what\nI think is really impressive because\nI've talked to a lot of people who who\nare in your situation and find some way\nto make it fair\nmm-hmm right they come up with all these\nreasons of things that like maybe your\nboyfriend did or didn't do or like you\nknow they like rationalize things or\nthey justify things but I think a\ngenuine lose I really respect what\nyou're saying which is that yeah it kind\nof sucks for him but I had to do it\nbecause I had to do it mm-hmm which sort\nof sounds cold but I think that it's\nactually incredibly authentic and it's\nbetter to be honest with yourself and\nknow that you did something that like\nhurt another human being then pretend\nthat you did it that's I felt more like\nalso I'd be dishonest with him if I\nstayed with him and felt that way yeah\nso you know the other way to look at it\nis yeah you told him it like so on the\none hand you maybe could have told him a\nlittle bit earlier but you know I think\nyou told him when you did because that's\nwhen you started to feel this way it's\nmore like a lot strongly about it yeah\non the other hand you know I think it is\ngood that you know you didn't just\nsquash those feelings and then go\nanother seven years yeah because I've\nseen those relationships to where you\nknow then it usually ends in divorce\nmm-hmm and and yeah so okay so I feel\nlike we kind of covered that I have a\ncouple of other different thoughts any\nany thoughts questions reflections oh\nthat's good okay is that helpful yeah it\nis really helpful how can I go for a\nbathroom base yes absolutely\nyou\nyou\nposture check\n[Music]\nwait how am i saying hi to myself dr. K\nChicago maybe\nseems uncomfortable for the headrest but\nmaybe it isn't\nyou\nso what should we do chat should we go\nphilosophical should we talk about\ncurrent events or should we talk about\nFoster syndrome sorry I'm\nwelcome back so I have a couple of\nquestions for you of on okay so I sort\nof feel like we're done talking about\nthat thing you seem to be actually\npretty level-headed about it\nI'm not getting like a whole lot of like\nunresolved piles of yeah you know motion\nso a couple of other thoughts I mean\ndoes that feel okay to you I mean you're\nnodding but okay yeah how's your\nnervousness by the way uh better now\nyeah I can tell yeah so a couple of\ninteresting so a couple of directions so\nwe can talk about what's going on now we\ncan talk about impostor syndrome and\nwhere you kind of get the idea that you\nknow why you dodge when people try to\nappreciate you because you'd a dodge at\nall right now by the way I don't know if\nyou remember not like dodging or no\ncognitive biases or anything like that\nleast not that I could pick up\nso either you're out playing me or\nthey're not there I think is just in\ncertain areas like maybe not in all\naspects of life but in that aspect I do\nfeel that way yeah I would agree with\nthat\nso we can talk about kind of what's\ngoing on right now how that's stressful\nwhere you get your idea of like who you\nare we can also dig into a little bit\nmore about that sort of like thirst for\nindependence and where that comes from\nI think though like those are kind of\ndeeper discussions the other interesting\nthing this is a little bit philosophical\na little bit yogic but you know it was\nand so this may be a little bit less\npersonal I don't know how helpful this\nis gonna be but I find it interesting is\nthe idea of living a life without\nregrets right so like when you're faced\nwith a choice in life and you say this\nis good but if I do this then I may\nregret something like how do you know\nwhen to change and how do you know when\nto concur so you're essentially giving\nin to your fear of regret by making a\nchange in your relationship you see that\nmmm-hmm so when do you conquer the fear\nof regret and when do you give in to the\nfear of regret and I don't think that\none is necessarily better than the other\nbecause sometimes giving in to the fear\nof regret is exactly what you need to\nlike that's how you make good choices\nand other times it's how you make\nterrible choices yeah right so like if\nI'm\nin like my mid-40s and I have a midlife\ncrisis and I think about all of the\nthings I feel tied down with a mortgage\nand paying college funds and stuff like\nthat and I think about you know I wanted\nto get a you know like a motorcycle and\nlike drive across Asia and then I like\nthat regret and I'm like [ __ ] that I'm\ngonna divorce I'm gonna go because I\nhave to like do this for myself\notherwise I'll die on my deathbed and\nall have regrets so when is it the right\nchoice to give in to the fear of regret\nand when did is when is it the wrong\nchoice I don't even know how to begin\nthat discussion but I think it's a\nreally interesting conundrum right is it\nbecause there is a road in which you can\nessentially let go of your fear of what\ncould have been and stick with what you\nhave yeah and it's just a interesting\nkind of conundrum that I was noticing\nthat you know you were facing it and we\nsort of had this idea that like you got\nto do you but I I don't know if that's\nalways true because sometimes that just\nturns you into an [ __ ] yeah I think\nit really depends on what it is because\nI think like in my case it's like it\nwould be also unfair to him and it's\nlike something that I didn't just like\nrandomly thought of and on a whim it's\nlike something that's been really goes\nfairly important and somewhat reasonable\nto do so I think it feels like very\ndream you'd have to definitely be way\nmore careful about that yeah so I agree\nwith you a hundred percent and also\nhaving talked to some 45 year olds they\nalso think about it a lot sometimes they\nthink about in four years mm-hmm and\nthey feel like it is unfair to their\npartner as well to be in a marriage\nwhere you're not happy mm-hmm so I think\nsometimes they think the same things\neven though I'm painting a picture\nthat's like far more reason I mean far\nless reasonable sometimes those people\nfeel the same way and I think it's an\ninteresting question to figure out like\nyou know how do you\nwhat's when what's right and what's\nwrong but anyway yeah so what what do\nyou want to talk about because I think\nwe still have a little bit of time you\nwanna talk about what's going on right\nnow you want to talk about a little bit\nmore about imposter syndrome hmm where\nindependence where the need for\nindependence comes from why why you get\npissed off when people complain and do\nnothing about it I think we can talk\nabout what's going on right now yeah so\ntell me what's going on right now um so\nright now there's a lot of the sexual\nharassment and sexual assault stuff\ngoing around on social media and I guess\nthere's like some things that i\nminimized a lot before that are starting\nto what feels like blow up in my face\nnow and um when I was in those\nsituations I guess\nboth times I just like froze at certain\npoints and like I don't know why I do\nthat or like how to prevent that or like\nwhat do you mean by those situations\nwhat are you froze what does that mean\num in which like the\nsexual\niseman or assault or it happened do you\nmm-hmm\noh [ __ ] that's awful\nhave you talked about this like if you\nbecause I know a lot of people are like\nposting stuff publicly you mentioned any\nof this to people before oh no I haven't\num but I've talked to my friends about\nit okay so the first question I mean\nthis question genuinely I understand\nthat we sort of said we're going to talk\nabout this but I would really think\nabout whether you're to what degree\nyou're comfortable disclosing stuff like\nhere and now because I definitely don't\nwant to ask you things that you're not\ncomfortable saying mm-hmm\nso let's just think about that for a\nsecond because I'm you know my next\nquestion is gonna be like what happened\nyeah and but I want to just make sure I\ndon't want you to feel I want to\nacknowledge that you may feel pressure\nto answer that question and at the same\ntime I want to give you the space to not\nanswer it and also I'm going to judge\nyou for like not speaking because you're\nnot ready I think I'm okay with like\nexplaining scenarios and like\ncircumstances and how I feel and stuff\nbut I don't want to like name people\nokay so anything okay\nI completely understand and respect that\nand but I I want to just I think it's\nimportant if it's okay with you for us\nto also talk about what makes you\nuncomfortable naming people\nhmm not that you have to name the people\nbut can we explore the feeling of\nhesitation about naming people yeah okay\nsome of it yeah\ngreat I'm just asking for whatever you\nfeel comfortable yet there because and\nnow I want you to step out of this\ndiscussion and talk to me we're not\ntalking about this now we're just step\nout of it we're gonna go madam for a\nsecond so Yvonne I want us to think a\nlittle bit about our opportunities in\nthis conversation so you're gonna have\npersonal feelings fine it can be hard\nfor you fine there can be all kinds of\nconsequences of this conversation the\nreason that I'm particularly interested\nin would like permission to explore your\nfeelings to not name names and explore\nthe boundary because you drew a line in\nthe sand right you said I'm okay talking\nabout all this [ __ ] but I'm not took\nokay talking about this and I think that\nline in the sand is something that many\nmany people experience and is part of\nwhat's responsible for what we're the\nsituation yeah does that make sense to\nyou yeah so I think I'm not asking you\nto name names I'm really not yeah at the\nsame time I think it's very very\nimportant for everyone to understand\nwhen someone is a victim of some kind or\nthe receiver of sexual harassment or\nassault like what is going on that keep\nslip like you don't want to say\nsomething right in fact you actively\ndon't want to and like what's up with\nthat because that's something that I\nthink we need to understand I'm not\nsaying you should change some people may\nsay that you should change but I'm not\nit's not my place yeah so okay cool\ncan we talk we get all right so what\nhappened\n[Music]\nuh the first time\nI had a club for a friend's birthday and\nthen he got a table and then I worried\nby\nin 2018 okay oh okay so a couple years\nago yeah okay a couple years ago and\nthen\nit was next to\nAbell of some people that I knew\nfor me sports\nand they weren't people that I met\nbefore\nI just know them because I because I see\nthem on I'll see us and stuff and then\nthe guys it was like talking to me\nbecause he recognized me from one of our\nparties and then he was just like oh\nlike you're like you've gone from\noffline TV and like stuff like that and\nthen he like struck up a conversation\nand then he also like he asked me like\nwhat ethnicity I was and I said oh I'm\nlike Chinese and then he like talked to\nthe other people that we were there too\nand he asked them like the same thing\nkind of you're in their similar\nconversation and then like yeah I\nthought he was like being pretty\nfriendly but just like talking wise like\nthere wasn't anything crazy and he was\nlike pretty drunk and then we walked out\nof the club and then he like said to\nsomeone beside him who was like there he\nis just like\nhow do I say I want to [ __ ] you in\nChinese and\nthen later\nwe I try to get into an uber to go to my\nfriend's house we're all in like a van\nbecause a bunch of us are going together\nand then he\nso my boyfriend at the time is well it's\nus in the backseat my boyfriend that guy\nand me and then sitting in the middle\nyeah I don't know why he was sitting in\nthe middle it's just when we got into\nlike her I don't even know why he came\nwith us to be honest he just saw maybe\nwhere I was going and so he followed I'm\nnot sure but um he was just in in\nbetween us I don't think he he didn't\nknow we were dating I think cuz it was\njust like um yeah and then in the fan\nlike I was wearing like a crop top and\nlike a skirt and he like it's a good\ntough it's like a t-shirt is usually\npretty long a crop top is kinda like\ncropped in the middle okay so when\nyou're sitting down it could like go up\na little bit thank you yeah um it's like\na [ __ ] it's just a short t-shirt and\nthen so like is your is your belly\nbutton showing in the crop top no no not\neven it goes past that okay and then uh\nhe has some I don't remember how but I\njust remember like he had his hand like\nunder my crop top like on my skin\nand I felt super uncomfortable like his\narm around me like touching me there and\nthen I\nI remember I was like I have to like\nstop this and then I like grabbed his\nhand I grabbed his hand and I put it\nover my head back to where he was or\nback to just you know on his side this\nis my side and like I put it back on his\nside and then\nand then somehow he had his hand on my\nass\nand then I just froze\nlike he basically went back ahead how my\nass and I just frozen I didn't doing or\nor from his side all the way around like\nlike a round like this yeah and then I\njust like froze and I just couldn't do\nanything there was so because I felt\nlike I already like threw his hand away\nand he did it again and I didn't know\nwhat to do and then\nyeah and yeah that's and then we got\nback to my friend's place and then I\nthink he saw there's like a ton of\npeople there and he just left afterwards\nand then later on that way like a couple\ndays later he like DM me on Twitter and\nhe's like hey I don't remember like\nanything from that night just remember\nmeeting you\nthat's it and I didn't reply\ncan I jest for a moment yeah\nman so [ __ ] creepy oh my god it's the\nfirst one I feel like that just had that\nI didn't get that out out there yeah\nso creepy I can't I'm just and so you\nsaid that he talked okay I'm just I\ndon't even know what to say I don't know\nif I should ask you questions or just\nhear the second one and then I don't\nknow what do you think\nI all see I'm not sure but like you you\ncan do whichever you feel like good work\nthis ah Yvonne I need your help because\nI have no like - how the [ __ ] am I\nsupposed to know when supposed to work\nbest I don't know I there okay uh um let\nme give you two options\nyou tell me which one I think what works\nso one thing that we can do is we can\njust hear the second story and then like\ntry to find themes or common things or\nwe can like tunnel down into this one\nfirst okay what do you think okay maybe\nsecond one and then find like the common\ntheme I think I just want to like yeah\n[Music]\nsecond one is\nsomeone who is like a really good friend\nof mine who I like trusted a lot and oh\nmy god every story is the I'm drunk\nstory but he was drunk he came he just\nuh he was out drinking\nand\nI was like in my room in my bed and then\nhe came in and he do you guys\nokay yeah how does he get into your\nhouse uh he was just teach us can or yes\nyeah just a good friend\nand he came in and\nlaid down next to me and\nfelt it was fun that wasn't anything\nweird and then he grabbed my hand and\nlike held it and I froze I was like\nmaybe he's just like drunk and like\nwants to just chill or something um and\nthen he like started brushing my hand\nagainst his face and then he like kissed\nit and then\nah\nand then he also like\nwent into like my sleeve like my t-shirt\nsleeve and then like\nbasically just\nand it just it was weird like it was\nlike an area I was uncomfortable with\nand then I just like froze and like I\ndidn't know what to do and then ten\nminutes later and then he like stopped\nand then he like it looked like he liked\nwhat he like fell asleep or something\nand then ten minutes ago he's like whoa\nhow did I get here and I was like you\ndon't remember anything and he's like no\nand I was like okay\nand I thought like he just you know was\nthat just\ndrunken maybe he blocked down he forgot\nI don't know\nand then um\nI asked him the next day I was like do\nyou like so do you remember what\nhappened last night and he's just like\nno and I was like okay um but I just\nkind of brushed it off I guess and then\na month later or like I don't even know\nif as a month later or a couple weeks\nlater but like something he came in\nagain again when he was drunk\nand then\napologized for what he did he said he\nknew he was like overstepping or\nsomething and that it was like yeah\nuh so he remembered when he was drunk\nagain\nbut he didn't remember when I asked him\nhe was sober the next day that time so\ndo you think about that\nI feel like he remembers and he just\nlied that he forgot what happened last\nnight\nor the other night why would someone do\nthat\nwhat maybe be about remembering\nso he doesn't have to be as responsible\nfor what he did can you think of any\nother reasons\nresponsibilities absolutely one of the\nbiggest reasons that people lie yeah I'm\nnot really sure what the other could be\nright now\nbut he apologized and then ten minutes\nlater he did the exact same thing I'm\nalso - the t-shirt part I gotta say the\nnot sure it's [ __ ] weird man\nit is weird yes is yes it's weird I\ndon't even I mean I've heard a lot of\nweird [ __ ] in my day and it's it's so\ninteresting how when we think about\nviolation we think about certain body\nparts but holy [ __ ] the t-shirt sounds\nso creepy it is is like an uncomfortable\nplace I wouldn't waste to like touch\npeople it's like when you think about\nlike boundaries and violations like we\ngenerally think about like genitals yeah\nor even the face but like the t-shirt is\njust I mean it it sound I mean it sorry\nif I'm talking too much about the\nservices making you uncomfortable it's\njust hearing your story has made me\nreally appreciate how violation doesn't\nhave to do with genitals right there's\nsomething about the experience of like\nboundaries and space and lines and\ncrossing lines that is not just you know\nlike there's a certain essence to it\nit's like a place that no one normally\ntouches it was like right on the side\nhere that's like next to you know and\nit's like yeah it feels very like\nprivate still or like it's just not\nsomewhat somewhere I want my good friend\nto be touching me that's weird\nyeah like I don't know and like you just\npretended like you forgot about the\nwhole thing how does that make you feel\ni minimized it a lot\ncuz I would still see him around so I\nbasically tried to just\nact like it never happened so see that's\ninteresting the language there is\ninteresting I traveled to act like it\nnever happened so what I'm hearing from\nyou is there's actually like a part of\nyour mind that is actively suppressing\nwhat happened yeah and I did that for a\nvery long time how do you understand\nthat part of you oh I didn't I think\nuntil recently when I started reading\neverything and I realized how much I\nminimized it and it's to the point where\nit's very hard for me to ignore it now\nright so what I'm asking you is why does\na mind so now we're gonna go meta again\nokay like so like let me just so\nactually first let me ask you so after\nsharing this stuff or saying it out loud\ndo you have any thoughts or feelings\nthat come up like how do you feel after\nsharing this I feel like upset that he\nwas able to get away with it\num\n[Music]\nthat\npeople who just\npeople don't see him that way\nwhich sucks people don't see him that\nway\nand so what how does that shape what you\ndo\n[Music]\nI don't really know it just\nyeah so let's look at that so when\npeople don't see someone a particular\nway what I'm hearing from you is that it\nmakes it harder for you to run against\nthe grain\none's thinking one way it's hard to\nspeak up hmm I feel differently from\nthat and I can't really explain it\n[Music]\nyeah it's just not something can yeah so\nYvonne I really am gonna press you here\nif that's okay because I think it's very\nimportant for everyone out there\nlistening to understand why it's hard\nfor you to speak mmm right so like I'm\nhearing a theme here which is that like\nyou kind of made like there were lots of\npoints where\nyou could have said something and you\ndidn't and I'm not blaming you for that\nI'm just saying that I think it's a\ntestament to like the pressure that you\nfeel in those moments does that make\nsense\nmm-hmm it's like really really hard to\nspeak and the question yes why right so\nlike when when a dude so first of all so\nit sounds like he asked someone else how\ndo you say I want to [ __ ] or something\nin Chinese right or no he said I want\nhow do you mean how do you say I want to\n[ __ ] you in Chinese and he wasn't\ntalking to you he was talking to anyone\nelse yeah man I could hear it okay so\nlike you're pretty sure it was directed\ntowards you which you know when he\nclimbs into the car and starts putting\nhis hand on your ass we can either flip\nto and do together yeah and and so you\nknow I'm just I'm kind of envisioning\nbecause you use this phrase you say you\nuse the word froze mm-hmm and I'd really\nlike to understand you know as best as\nyou can and I understand it's hard\nbecause like we don't talk about the\nstuff and like this is the problem right\nas people don't know so if we think\nabout like what we do on the stream we\nhelp people put words to things that\nthey don't understand and by one person\nputting words to it it helps everyone\nelse recognize oh [ __ ] that's what I'm\nfeeling\nmm-hmm and I haven't been able to put\nwords to it and and if it's okay with\nyou and it's not you know like you you\ndraw the line wherever you want to or\nyou know you call it quits whenever\nyou're ready to and I really I'm not\ntrying to I won't judge you for that at\nthe same time I do feel like it's very\nimportant for people to at least\nunderstand how you feel about it and I\nfind myself because if I think I think\nif we want to fix this we have to help\npeople understand like how you freeze\nbecause it's shocking to me that\nsomething like this can happen and by\nshocking it once again I don't blame you\nfor it but I think it's just it speaks\nto how big of a problem this is that you\ncan be in a car with your boyfriend and\na dude can be like feeling you up\nthere's a lot of stuff here that just\nboggles my mind like you know when when\nyour friend comes in and lays down next\nto you in bed like is that something\nthat happened like is that normal within\nthe range of how you interact with\npeople and I'm not trying to paint you\nand about just yet and and so so you\nknow like how does how does a situation\narise where like he thinks that that's\nacceptable and furthermore when he's\nlaying in bed like what makes it hard\nfor you I don't want to say what makes\nit hard for you to tell him to leave but\nbecause I've heard your language it was\nsort of like well maybe it's just this\nlike there's a part of your mind that is\ntelling you that this is not okay and\nwhat I'm also hearing you is there's a\npart of your mind that is trying to like\nbe the Mafia and like shut up the part\nof your mind that's telling you it's not\nokay\nthat's almost how it sounds to me does\nthat make sense yeah like you tried\nreally hard to minimize it it's almost\nlike the secret police is like showing\nup at your door and telling the part of\nyour mind it's like hey this is [ __ ]\nup they're like don't say anything\nand even now that I mean I'm guessing\nthat that's still there because you even\nsaid I don't want to name names so I\nwant you to like look within yourself\nand try to think is there a part of you\nthat's saying and I'm sorry that this is\nhurting you I really I really am that\nbut like you know I think it scares the\n[ __ ] out of me that there's like some\npart of you that like keeps you from\nspeaking and I'm not saying you're dumb\nand I'm not saying it's bad I'm saying\nlike that's the reality that my face\nwhat we're seeing is like the actual\nstruggle like this is why people say\nsilent because something within you is\ntelling you\nEvon whatever you do do not open your\nmouth what do you see that yeah what is\nthat\nhow would you feel about yourself if you\ndid open your mouth and let me know if\nwe got to stop\nI just can't\nI think is it's not just mean that's\nlike it just affects a lot of things so\nI can't say anything\nyou\nI'm gonna think about it you could keep\ngoing if you want to I'm just letting\nyou know that I think there's a lot\nthere and I'm gonna do my best\nto pull as much out of that statement as\nI can because I recognize that this is\npainful for you in some way\nso I'm gonna try to make every word\ncount if that makes sense\nwhat are the consequences that you're\nafraid of\nyou\neverything that happens after\nbut what does your mind envision will\nhappen after\nthings will just be very scary\nwhat will occur\nI think\nyou\nit's just there's a lot that comes with\nit so like it's like hard for me to say\nanything\nokay\ni its weird so I found myself smiling\nthere for a second\ndid you remember earlier when I was like\nthinking you're a courageous person\nmm-hmm I I think I think twice as much\nnow for 10 times as much I thought\nyou're gonna say opposite yeah I'm not\nsurprised because how do you feel\n[Music]\nthe same I do I just feel like I guess\nyou just emphasized it a lot more\nthey're like I really can't say anything\nand that feeling just really sucks what\nsucks about that feeling\nthe under different circumstances are a\nlot of other things that I have to\nconsider I would say something so I'm\nwondering if we should just stop this\nconversation because I don't want this\nto damage you in any way shape or form\nwhat do you think\nI don't think it's damaging I think I'm\njust like\nI just don't\nor people to know okay so if people knew\nhow would you what would happen that\nyou're afraid of what would you what\nwould you they think about you\nI don't think it'd be any\nthing to Adam\nI just think chaos the world burned down\nand like that's just it's how I see it\nyeah yeah well I mean on the one hand\nsort of makes sense because I can\nimagine why you would want to stay\nsilent if the alternative is is burning\nthe world out yeah right I think for me\nVaughn it's incredibly confusing so I\ntend to be like a pretty good judge of I\ncan like read people's minds kind of and\neven then I mean I could you know I can\ntake a stab at it but to me it's a\nlittle bit confusing about you know what\nwhat is it that you're afraid of like\nand the other the other interesting\nthing is that I wonder if it's actually\nfear that's keeping your mouth that I'm\nbeginning to realize it's not fear I\nthink what you're trying to do is\npreserve and protect\nwhat do you think yeah I agree\nthere's Yvonne support player protecting\ntaking it for the team and boy did you\ntake it this time\nwho are you protecting\nI'm not asking you to name those people\nI mean in general like you know just to\nbe clear\nwhat does it feel like you're protecting\na lot of things\nyou\nhow are you feeling right now\nokay\nyou\nyou\nyou\nthis may sound kind of weird but I have\nfaith in you I don't know exactly for\nwhat but I'm in your corner\nand yeah I hope you didn't dodge that\none\nshe don't okay good you've got so many d\nbuffs right now you can't dodge anything\nit's true just take anything at this\npoint\nyeah so I I mean I think you're a good\nperson in oddly enough a bond so I'm\ngonna talk a little bit because I think\nit may help you feel like like less in\nyour head which may be as bad maybe it's\ngood but I'm gonna do it because I feel\nlike I got a I got a taunt okay so I'm\ngonna tank and I'm gonna you want to\nkeep going guys to stay silent no no you\ncan go okay you want to explore your\nfeelings right now or you want me to\ntake the camera off of you\n[Music]\nno you can go okay so oddly enough I\nthink this is making a lot more sense to\nme because I think that how can I say\nthis\nso I tend to be an optimist and when I\nthink about you know what people make\nsacrifices for I tend to think that they\nmake sacrifices and ultimately like the\nbiggest sacrifice that you're making is\nyourself here right can we sort of see\nthat you're like you're paying the price\nfor something we don't really know\nexactly what it is you're protecting a\nlot of things you're protecting the\nworld from coming down with your silence\nand like this is your cross to bear\nthere's this idea that like we can\nprotect the world with our suffering and\nthat's what I see you doing and the\ninteresting thing the interesting\nassumption here is that people think\nthat women stay silent not just women\nbut men too just victims stay silent out\nof negative emotions and to me that's\nnever really like fit perfectly because\nlike fear is a powerful motivator but\nfor the amount of suffering that people\nput themselves through and feel and\ncarry and don't let go because people\nhold on to it right it actually makes\nfar more sense to me that there's\nactually like a noble reason in your\nmind that allows you to put yourself\nthrough this\nyeah like protection and being a support\nand taking care of others and\nmaintaining stability are like the\nreasons that we put up with [ __ ] like\nthat actually makes way more sense to me\nand that's not something that I had\nreally ever understood or appreciated\nuntil we had this conversation everyone\njust assumes that it's like fear right\nbut I think it's all kinds of like other\nstuff and I'm not getting this from you\nquite yet but I really wonder if it's\ndown there like sometimes you know the\nreason that some women stay silent in\nthe car is because when he touches you\nin a weird way your mind thinks that if\nyou're a boyfriend knew he would break\nup with you\nwhat do you think about that mm-hmm that\nwasn't the case for me yeah I'm not\ngetting that from you I think it's\nactually quite I'm happy that you're not\ndoing that because sometimes women blame\nthemselves for being victims I kind of\ndid a little bit in the sense of like\nbecause my boyfriend did ask me like why\ndidn't I say anything at the time\nbecause he was right there or he is\nthere like I didn't tell him until the\nguy left our friend's place and I said\nlike I don't know I just like froze and\nI couldn't say anything at the time and\nthat's just how I explained it and I\nguess like I don't\nI didn't blame myself because I didn't\nwant to be in that situation in the\nfirst place and he put me there so it's\nlike how I react\nis it\nwhy am I to blame for how I reacted when\nI did try to like move him away and like\nI didn't even want to be put in that\nsituation in the first place\nand you don't blame yourself mm-hmm\nthat's rare it's also hard to not put\nthem yourself because a lot of times\npeople do blame themselves do you blame\nyourself for not saying no more\nforcefully\nI feel like I tried but it's like I was\nput in a situation I didn't expect that\nalso I didn't know what to do and it's\nlike thinking on your feet but your\nbrains not really working because you're\nlike trying to process what's going on\nso\nyeah I just think that\nit's not my fault that he just literally\ncouldn't keep his hands to himself yeah\nI think there's something really\nimportant there too so a lot of people\nwhen they look at a story like this\nthey say that you could have said no at\nany point mm-hmm right you could have\ntold your friend what the [ __ ] are you\ndoing in my bed\nmm-hmm you could have said hey like\ndon't touch me I have a boyfriend and\nhe's sitting right over there go [ __ ]\nyourself mm-hmm you know there are a lot\nof people who will say that and it\nthey're not wrong right you could have\nsaid no mm-hmm\nand at the same time I don't think that\npeople really understand or appreciate\neven women will say this about other\nwomen by the way I don't think they\nunderstand or appreciate the\nphysiological response that happens when\nsomething like this happens and how like\nyour mental goes boom like you're just\nnot thinking clearly like it's there's\nsomething there forces within you that\nkeep you from speaking and we don't\nreally understand that or appreciate\nthat and the weird thing is it's kind of\ninteresting because you say that you\nweren't prepared for the situation I\nthink they're in actually lies off the\nproblem and what I'm really like\ngrateful honestly Yvonne from the bottom\nof my heart as a as a father of like two\ndaughters I am like really grateful for\nyou that you're like saying this because\nthis is how people get prepared right is\nlike someone like you have to know that\nit can happen before it actually happens\nyeah and a lot of times like like the\nproblem is that no one knows that the\n[ __ ] can happen it's like everyone just\nassumes mmm because as you put it he's a\nfriendly guy and the other guy has been\na friend of yours for a long time\nand so we're not prepared and like it's\nhard to say\nnext thing so it's like how do you feel\nright now by the way I feel better okay\nyeah\nI've tanked so now now we have an\ninteresting question right so like we\ngot to figure out can we keep going or\nis this enough for today and if you can\nkeep going I'm gonna drop aggro and put\nit back on you but only if you're ready\nyeah I'm ready okay so now I think we've\ngot to talk about like why I'm not once\nagain I'm not trying to pressure you\ninto speaking or anything like that so\nplease understand that but I do think\nit's important very important for people\nto understand why you can talk about the\ngeneral out in general and view yourself\nwhy you can talk about the generalities\nof the situation without naming names\nmm-hmm right so you like what is it that\nkeeps you from speaking fine like your\nyour you know your mind isn't wasn't\nfunctioning back then there's like a\nphysiological stress response there's\nactually you know there's a and just so\npeople know you ever heard of something\ncalled catatonia No\nokay so I'll just tell I'll show you\nguys a paper later so there's a there's\na mammalian survival response which is\nto freeze and play that so it's like\nsome people call it playing possum so\nyou like you know when some animals are\nattacked they just like literally freeze\nthere's a psychiatric condition called\ncatatonia which is fascinating to see\nbut it's like when people become like\nliterally stop and and like they can't\nspeak they can't move they're like\nsitting there just with their eyes open\nand they're like minimally responsive to\nstimuli and so people have hypothesized\nthat so catatonia is like actually\nsomething that happens to people\nsometimes with like schizophrenia they\ncan have different kinds of conditions\nand so there's actually like a\nneurological response that causes you to\nlock up and not it's like your biology\nis just sort of playing dead and that\nstate is called catatonia and later on\nwhen you guys get professor dr. K then\nor Professor K or whatever I'll show you\nguys papers and physiology and stuff\nlike that but I think what happened to\nyou when people blame you for not\nspeaking and when people when when\npeople say oh you could have said no at\nany time and when even people say like\noh you should have said something just\nsay something people need to understand\nthat there's actually like physiological\nevidence that shows that when human\nbeings are in danger literally what they\ndo is lock up it's not like a\npsychological lock up it's like a\nneurological lock up\nit's [ __ ] me yeah um I don't know I\ndon't even know what I was talking about\nthere but oh yeah so so what I was\nsaying is that you know the reason that\nyou didn't speak back then is because of\nmaybe a catatonic response fine it was a\nsurvival response you froze the reason\nthat you're not speaking now I suspect\nis different because you are walking and\ntalking right it's not the catatonic\nresponse it's something else so I'd\nreally like to understand what that is\ncan we talk about that\nokay okay thank you I appreciate that\nand once again you know you get to pull\nthe plug at any point you want okay and\nI may pull the plug if I think you know\nI'm gonna try to pull the plug for you\nif I think that you'd go into a\ncatatonic space and you can't pull the\nplug yourself okay so what is it that\nmakes it hard for you to name names\nthere's a lot of implications that come\nalong with it what kind of implications\nimplications for you implications for\nthem implications for mutual people it\nfeels like the whole world okay so let's\nstop and think about that for a second\nwhen I tell you Yvonne that I'm afraid\nof doing something because it has\nimplications for the whole world how\nwould you interpret that\nwhat would you think about\nI'm not sure um I mean it depends like\nwhat I'm asking you why you're not like\nwhat you're not sharing and stuff but\nyeah so it's like you said before that I\nwant to protect and so I can't okay can\nyou tell us so my first thought is that\nwhen someone feels like it has\nimplications from the whole world that\nsounds like a emotional thought as\nopposed to a logical thought what do you\nthink about that I agree so what is the\nemotion that is keeping you from\nspeaking is it fear is it shame is it\nanger is it love\nadding its love\nyeah man that makes so much more I've\nnever realized this until today but like\nit makes so much sense you know and and\nI mean this is such a hard conversation\nto have because how do i how do we\nunderstand this more without\ncompromising what your goals are which I\nwant to respect at all costs\nbecause the question that I want to ask\nis like who do you love that you're\ntrying to protect but I think that\nthat's the question that you don't want\nto answer so I can't ask that question\nbut I feel like that's the important\nquestion you with me mm-hmm\nlet me think about this\nwhy do you feel responsible for\nprotecting the ones that you love\nbecause I want to\nyou\nyou\nthis may be the final boss by the way\nyou may be the red boss people have been\nlooking for the raid boss for a long\ntime yeah I'm just trying to really\nthink about\nyou\nokay let me put it to you this way the\npeople that you're trying to protect\nwhat do you think they would say about\nyou speaking\nif that was ultimately what I wanted to\ndo I think they would support me 100%\nokay but okay so that's a that's an\ninteresting statement so we're gonna\nunpack that a little bit but like it's\nkind of interesting because you're\nsaying if that's what I really wanted to\ndo they would support me but if you're\nmakin says if you're but you're not\ndoing it for yourself you're doing it\nfor them\nYeah right so so but like so like what\nyou're saying sort of doesn't make sense\nto me is because it's kind of like you\nknow if I want to I feel like baking a\ncake or I'm gonna bake a cake and I'm\ngonna bake it for them so I'm gonna put\nin all this time and effort for their\nsake I'm gonna suffer and stay silent\nfor that and then if I go to the person\nI say like hey like I want to bake this\ncake for you and they're like but I want\nthe cake like you should do whatever you\nwant to like if you want the cake go for\nit you know so it's weird because you're\nmaking a sacrifice for on their behalf\nbut like I'm not so sure that they want\nyou to make that sacrifice do you think\nthey want you to make that sacrifice do\nyou think they would want you to be\nsilent\nwhat they would need to be silent I\nthink they would always want what's like\nbest for me or like they would want me\nbe happy it's just also a part of what I\nwant to do it's a part of what you so\nyou want to say silent right now yeah\nyeah okay and and that's out of\nprimarily you still think love or do you\nthink that there's some other stuff\ngoing on there\nno I think it's still that okay and okay\nso I think if you want to stay silent\nthen I think maybe we've done enough for\ntoday what do you think yeah that sounds\ngood to you okay so one last question\nmm-hmm and then I should teach you\nmeditation but boy is it hard to teach\nmeditation after this yeah so do you do\nyou feel so I know that you don't want\nto name names fine do you feel\ncomfortable saying who it is that you\nlove and for whom you're choosing to\nstay silent or is that too much because\nI can't I don't I don't know if that's\nthe same people uh just think in general\nthere's like not a lot I want to say in\nregards to that okay cool\nI wish I could because I feel like if\nyou helped a lot of people but no just\nme all right now don't don't worry about\nit man I I really don't want you to\nworry about that sure I think that let\nme put it this way he gone\nyou have to help everyone you just do\nwhat you can do and if half of the world\nor a quarter of the world or 10% of the\nworld does what you've done today we're\ngonna be fine hmm you don't need to lift\nfor all of us you don't have to be a DC\nfor the whole [ __ ] every league game\nout there we just need like 20 percent\nof people to be a DC's right like\nliterally look it's a beautiful analogy\neverything can be learned from legal yes\nhmm\nand so you've carried plenty for today\nyou don't need to keep carrying you know\nyou don't need to carry for other people\nI think you've done like that's what\nthat's what a oe healing is about it's\nlike each person comes on and like does\ntheir part and then some other noob will\ncome on and they'll start caring yeah\nhow you feeling right now uh yeah a\nlittle shaken up I'm getting yeah I mean\nI should hope you're a little bit shaken\nout I [ __ ] sure yeah yeah I mean I\nthink I mean a little bit more than you\nbargained for huh mm-hmm yeah definitely\nyeah an extract a lot of it I thought it\nwas be like yeah but it was good as good\nyeah I mean for what it's worth way more\nthan what I bargained for yeah you know\nI thought we were just gonna be talking\nabout impostor syndrome because that\n[ __ ] I know yeah and you know low\nself-esteem and all the sudden it just\nfeels like suck for so long about other\nthings but yes you know no pressure in\nterms of meditation and I don't even\nknow what I would teach mm-hmm today I\nmean I feel like after after sessions\nlike today I don't really tell like I\nthink probably the best thing to do is\nfor you to just sit and process and\ndon't try to force your mind to do\nanything if you have an animal or a cup\nof tea or something tasty or sunlight or\nwater I think you should go and be with\nthose things mm-hmm and just let\nyourself shed because you've been like\nkind of wrung out right does that do you\nfeel that way\na little thing yeah yeah so you've got\nto just let yourself like you know when\nI when I twist something and I wring it\nout it has a natural tendency to like\nwant to come back to its former shape\nthat's what your meditation should be\nlet yourself return to the person that\nyou are that's like kind of in your\ncomfortable neutral state if you have\nchildren I would say that you should\nkiss them and cuddle them that's what\nI'm gonna do after we're done with this\nyeah I'm going to hold my daughters and\npossibly I mean this is gonna sound like\na bad joke but touch them in places that\nthey don't want to be touched\nlike is their belly button and other\ncheeks mmm-hmm and things like that is a\nside note I can tell you sorry my wife\ntold me can't tell you story\nsure yeah so my wife actually taught me\na really important lesson so when my\neldest daughter was - she's like four\nnow um I was trying to convince her to\ngive me a kiss right yes that's what we\ndo\nand that she was like you know you\nshould be careful about what you teach\nher about like cajoling affection when\nshe doesn't want to give it mm-hmm\nand like what am i signal to her in\nterms of like how do you respond when\nsomeone wants you to do something that\nyou don't feel like doing if I can blew\nmy mind yeah that's crazy that makes so\nI never even thought of it that way yeah\nI never thought of it that way either\nbut now I just I totally like respect\ntheir boundaries which is like you know\ncan Daddy yes if she says no and then\nI'll beg and plead a little bit but then\nI'll be like okay well can I give you a\nkiss okay I mean yeah it's really\ninteresting how a lot of this stuff is\nbaked in right yeah it's teaching her\nthat she's allowed to say no when it\ncomes to physical affection is like\napparently something that you start\nlearning when you're 2 and it really\nmakes me think long and hard about like\nwhy you couldn't say no then and what\nthe programming in your brain was that\nstarted when like literally you were 2\nyears old or when your year old mm-hmm\nso it was kind of eye-opening it's\ninteresting\nTapp daughters could be a man learn a\nlot\nI bet yeah but it's a very good thing I\nfeel like you empathize a lot and think\na lot from their shoes\nyeah I I hope so I feel like most of the\ntime I just don't understand them\nthey're just completely different\ncreatures sometimes I give you like but\nyeah yeah so believe on listen thank you\nvery much for coming on today and I\nthink really strong work like that's I\nmean you [ __ ] carried this [ __ ] yeah\nthank you so much for having me\nit was uh is really really nice and\nreally helpful that boggles my mind I\nmean I feel like we just you know you\nyou look like you just ran a marathon\nyeah and I don't usually expect people\nto say thank you after that but I mean\nfor what it's worth you're welcome\nhopefully it helps you hopefully it\nhelps other people I feel really\ngrateful because I feel like hopefully\nwe understand a little bit more about\nlike you know this whole situation which\nI think is far more complicated than\npeople give it credit for mm-hmm so and\nand good for you for you know striving\nfor independence and living a life\nwithout regrets yeah thank you\nwell hopefully it works out that way I\ncertainly hope so too yeah it sounds\nlike you're your most recent\nex-boyfriend was a really solid guy so\nmasters we got him yes cool take care\nthank you\noh [ __ ] chat\nJesus oh man Chad I'm so owned you guys\nreally want me to meditate now I can't\nmeditate man\nyou"
