like what's going on\nnowadays one two three let's go on the\nbutton right here I'm not sure who's on\nthe bottom right here first you go first\nyou like you're a little bit closer to\nthe mic man we're getting some some\nbreathing yeah so um I'm space and you\nguys might have seen me on the discord\nin the fitness and diet channel thanks\nso much that's okay I'm since game\ntherapy I've changed a lot and I'm now\nin school I'm doing an apprenticeship as\nwell as my degree at the same time I\nfeel like this is finally the time that\nI'm gonna get my degree and I feel like\nI'm changing the law um in terms of my\nexperience in mental health I come from\na African Christian background in the UK\nand a lot of it is a Ziva demons or\nmonkeys or Ziva I don't know like we\ndidn't they don't believe in it it's\nlike a thing that doesn't exist you know\num is evil just pray about it or just\nman up yes I miss it might be something\nof a of a Mel finger it might be\nsomething of something in the blackened\nChristian community\never since watching your stream and gain\nthe confidence and to say that okay I'm\ngonna get therapy and gain it through my\ncompany which is which I'm so happy\nabout I've seen so much of a change so\nit's through something called CBT\ncognitive behavioral therapy if anyone's\nheard of it and it's like changing\nthoughts and that automatic negative\nforce and I feel like that's really\nhelped as well as psychiatry as well\nshouts okay what was your name again\nRaymond Raymond Ray okay cool man thank\nyou very much for sharing business I can\ngo next thanks man\nso my name is Aki Aki n sometimes people\nstruggle with that I could go by my\ngamertag wrathy - I don't really care\nbut yeah so I guess just a little bit\nabout myself I guess what I'm doing\nright now I mean I'm not doing not\ntechnically working and you know kovin\nand all that but I've been trying to use\nthe time off of work to work on like\nwork on any everything I care about\nprimarily programming cool I used to\nwork in the software industry and then I\ngot fired for being a lazy piece of [ __ ]\nand so I'm trying to not be lazy so I\nfigure if I can like work on a project\nby myself and like accomplish something\nI would be pretty confident that I could\nlike work any job and at least get my\nwork done and that kind of thing sure\nthat's where I'm at right now hmm okay\nthanks I'll end up sharing knocking yeah\noh also I just mentioned I also come\nfrom an African Christian background too\nso I feel you man Eli you want to go yes\nsir\nI also come from happy Christian and\nit's a very common thing to have the\nsame mental health thing I'm very lucky\nthat my mom's nurse so mental health has\nalways been a thing that was paid\nattention to my family and she attempted\nto get me diagnosed when I was very\nyoung my older brother also doubled\ndepression and bipolar disorder and\nusing that nature so I was diagnosed\nwith depression anxiety I think it was\nabout 7 to 12 years old probably more I\nthink about 7 years old\nand I've dealt with a lot of so in\nNigeria I'm Nigerian and Nigerian\nculture\nabuse is a very common thing is okay to\nbeat your children and without much care\nfor the pain in which they will go\nthrough and the long-term effects with\nthat even now I'm only like actually\nrecognizing the long-term effects with\nthat much like relating to the\nexperience feeling like a lazy piece of\n[ __ ]\nbut it was the kind of struggle in which\nI had where I wasn't really able to\nconvey that I wasn't valuing the work\nthat I was doing because academia I like\nlearning things I got to show you all\nthe books I read my free time but\nbecause of the fact that when you don't\ndo well in school my like in my\nhousehold you get beaten like and I\nwould make mistakes a lot and I didn't\nsaamiya cuz my brain like runs at ten\nmiles an hour so it's already hard for\nme to sleep consistently so that it was\nreally hard to adapt to that when I was\na kid\nso I'd sleep the next class and my\nteachers called me lazy I got in trouble\na lot like me scratching myself and\nstuff like that got me in trouble once\nI'm sorry every time I got removed for\nanything I had to get read slip and I\nbring the rest at home\nthen it would lead to me getting beaten\nso I'll be in class crying and things\nover a red slip my teacher thinks I'm\nthis a child crying over beginning in\ntrouble when in reality because I'm game\nlike being at home and that's something\nI still have any we unpacked yet but I\nbeing Nigerian and recognizing these\nlong-term effects that because I think\nmy mom depression my anxiety stems from\na situational thing I wasn't maybe a\nnatural like inclination because I if I\nhad been in a better situation maybe I\nwouldn't be dealing with the things in\nwhich I do deal with but I think that\nmuch of what my experiences as black\nperson has been feeling that life is\nreally worth living simply because the\ncolour might\nagain and things I've had to experience\nand I went to abdominal white high\nschool I wasn't born here I was born in\nNigeria and I came when I was about two\nyears old and my mom is someone because\nof being Nigerian I think you may have\nFreitas already I don't know if you guys\nknow the Nigerian people but it's just\ndesire to be white designed for\nwhiteness not suit you look white\nbecause I still want you to retain your\nabout or Nigerian culture but they want\nthey could like the conception of\nwhiteness is the ideology to follow into\nand my mom was always happy with my\nAmerica like if I love the idea of me\ndating a white girl or being more led to\nlike Akademi or being more into going to\nlike she wants she sees me in the white\nhouse he's always told me things like\nthis and it it helped me at times to see\nthat she believed in me but it also felt\ntoxic in the sense that like if I didn't\ndo well I get B and when I did do well\nto tell me she's proud of me but it's\nstopping like the the rewards didn't\nfeel like they weighed into the like\nnegatives negatives always from way more\nthan the rewards and that thing I feel\nlike now I've realized me sometimes very\ndepressed over the past like four months\nago getting another fax four months\nthree months of corny virus when\neverything was happening exactly I'm a\nnatural empath\nI have a bad habit of taking like the\npain of others into myself but I\nrealized and around that time and I also\nwasn't even be able to focus on school I\njust got so tired of being in school and\ncuz I must I was a something or going to\nbe a junior about a sophomore in college\n20 years old but um I realized that the\nabuse which I face makes it really hard\nfor me to be able to stick to things\nbecause I get boarded them very quickly\nI'm not sure if that's just natural\ninclination but I'm trying to consider\nthe possibility the possibility now that\nbecause of what I had to experience\ngrowing up it became very hard for me to\nexpress myself fully and also be able to\nfeel like school or any kind of project\nthat was created was worthwhile guys\nwrite a lot of poetry and draw a lot\nwhen I was growing up as a kid and I\nhelped me feel better when I was very\ndepressed but situations changed and I\nfelt I'll being able to do that but to\nkeep things simple bleep like as simple\nas I could be being black never really\nfelt like I like a worthwhile thing\nespecially when I learned about police\nbrutality and things like that growing\nup and learning about social justice and\nlearning about it\nthe world and how difficult it can be\nsimply just because of the color your\nscans cool man thanks for that intro Eli\nwho wants to go next\nOh meet it\nwe got another boomer on here you're\nvery quiet and a little bit laggy oh\nsorry\nhow's my microphone now is that all\nperfect yeah why don't you go man\nawesome yeah so thanks very much for\nhaving me on the stream first and\nforemost it's an absolute pleasure and\nan honor to talk to you my name is mo I\ngo by a GBH short for a great big hug\nI'm 26 I'm from Ontario Canada born and\nraised here family's from North Africa\nLibya and I have type two bipolar as\nwell it's tough yeah I struggle with my\nidentity all the time growing up I've\nbeen told I'm not black enough I've been\ntold I'm too white I've been told I'm\nnot Arabic enough all that type of stuff\nand it's difficult dealing with this\nstigma behind mental health especially\nyour own community you get told\neverything just pray more change your\ndiet you know don't believe in the\nvoodoo stuff all that type of [ __ ] but\nit's it's it's I think my biggest\nstruggle personally just the stigmas\nbehind mental health and come to terms\nwith it especially within my own\ncommunity\ncool thanks so do you prefer a GBH or mo\noh it works my works okay\ncool man how about now yeah a little bit\nbetter is there any way you can turn up\nyour volume a little bit okay my name is\nJulian I'm a second year mechanical\nengineer student thinks you've been also\nlike my therapist as well like she's\nbeen really helpful\num but yeah I'm just taking time to\nquarantine just get better work on\nmyself cool basically yeah Julie you're\nstill crackling a little bit or do you\nguys hear him crackling uh yeah oh yeah\nthat's fine oh that was beautiful\nwhatever he said there just I don't know\nwhat's wrong\nokay so um thank you guys very much for\nyou know so you guys say you're all\ngrateful to be here I'm grateful to have\nyou guys I've I mean I think the people\nis absolutely mutual\nso let me just offer a couple of\nthoughts and then maybe get us started\nso the first thought that I want to say\nis that you know we're here to talk\nabout you know the intersection of\nbasically like race and mental health\nand the first thing that I want to point\nout is that I I think it's you know it's\ninteresting that you guys have some\nthings that you kind of share in terms\nof your perspective around or your\nexperience of mental health and and what\nyou sort of gained from your culture the\nfirst thing that I want to say though is\nthat I don't I feel like most of what\nwe're gonna talk about is not gonna be\nrestricted to black people like I you\nknow I I know that when I went to India\nfor the first time like there was a guy\nwho had schizophrenia but I studied in\nan ashram or a monastery and basically\nlike people thought he was possessed by\na demon and you know and that's long\nthat's like the way that they interpret\nthat so I think that like you know there\nare a lot of different cultures that\nhave stigma against mental health I\nthink I'm hearing a lot of struggles\naround identity which I don't think is\nspecific to a particular race or even\neven race in general and at the same\ntime you know there are certainly common\nthemes about like religion and\nconceptions of mental health and the way\nthat you guys were taught the way that\npeople around you conceptualize like\nwhat were the challenges that you faced\nand what kind of labels and treatment\nyou got because of your struggles and so\nI just you know I think that there's\nlike sort of a tension there between\nwhat applies to everyone and at the end\nof the day I think that you know\ndifferent people of different than\nethnicities have fundamentally different\nexperiences in life and people of\ndifferent genders have different\nexperiences of life but I think what's\nreally cool about us and in our\ncommunity is that what brings us\ntogether is far greater than what you\nknow separates us so I I just kind of\nwanted to toss that out and you guys can\njump in kind of in any time does anybody\nlike does anybody want to comment or\nreflect on that or I've got it\nI agree completely I think you're\nabsolutely right I think the\nintersectionality is not only within the\nblack community but in so many cultures\nand communities across the globe even\nwhen it comes to things like religion\nthat affects a lot of communities\n- so I absolutely agree with you as well\nyeah cool William I'd like my closest\nfriends are\ncan you move forward he like Oh many of\nmy friends are of different races for\nthe very fact that we all relate to the\nsame childhood experiences that\nregardless of where we come from were\nlike overarching cultural there doesn't\nhave been cool yeah so so there are\nthree basic themes that I kind of heard\nmaybe a couple people like tying\ntogether one is a sense of like identity\nlike I thought it was interesting how\nyou know Eli was I wonder Eli if you\nwere basically rewarded for being things\nthat people around you thought was quote\nunquote more white and yes you know like\nit's kind of interesting right so like\nthat that that you weren't rewarded for\nbeing you you were rewarded for being\nwhat they wanted you to be not having\nthe law in school as well so no matter\nwhere I went it was the same kind of\nthing and that's where code-switching\nwas always a thing I had to comprehend\nsince I was a child so when you're\nprecocious I think many other guys in\nhere can understand this or you're a\nprecocious person of color and there's I\nthink here in the Boston is but I'm in\nBoston here in Boston especially it's\nthe kind of thing where you get\ncompliments on while your English is so\ngood or wow you're really smart for that\nI thought were you like I said from\nNigeria I have these white kids from\nSouthie\nSouth Boston say so yeah don't you guys\nlive in huts don't you guys live in\nteepees like nah I'm from Legos one of\nthe most developed parts of West Africa\nand like the conception of what it means\nto be African or what it means to be\nNigerian just a dish it was always right\nin the forefront my head and because of\nthat I had the constant experience of\nbeing seen as a bush boy a kwang-ho bush\nboy this is the thing in my in my\nculture bush boys like someone who is um\nhoney like say how do I describe English\nsomeone who is not raised properly and\nthey see that is your baseline level so\nwhen you perform above that you see that\noh wow you're here so intelligent\nand I thought that it was a really weird\nthing to experience but I tried to learn\nto define it but I can never really take\npride in it because I'd peers who were\nnot treated the same peers who were\nblack and people of color in general but\nespecially the black guys in my grades\nthey weren't treated the same way simply\nbecause the fact that they didn't have\nthat same way with words that has the\nCharter yeah so I think we can talk\nabout identity another thing that we\ncould talk about is like I'm hearing you\nguys use the phrase piece of [ __ ] or\nlazy a fair amount like I'm just lazy\nand and we could kind of dig into like\nwhat that means or where that comes from\nand the third thing that we could talk\nabout you know it sounds like you guys\nhad a couple of really cultural\nintersections with mental health in\nterms of stigma prayer you know it\nsounded like Raymond was basically like\nyou know told to pray the mental health\naway and and so you know we could talk a\nlittle bit about that what do you guys\nthink or you know if you all have a\nsuggestion for something that you'd like\nto talk about then you know by all means\nbut those are kind of the three things\nthat seem to kind of unite a few\ndifferent perspectives here so identity\nbeing a lazy piece of [ __ ] and stigma\nand prayer I guess I would like to talk\nabout one other thing I guess being\nblack in the gaming culture because\nsometimes I feel like I have to change\nmy voice all after kind of like hide my\nface because there's kind of a few I\ndon't know saying I guess um people hide\nbehind the animal anonymity of being\nonline and they feel free to say\nwhatever they want and sometimes it kind\nof hurts like maybe it's like a 13 year\nold kid\non Call of Duty or on whatever food\nlands free or whatever and play and\nsaying the most racist thing that you if\nthe UM their parents heard they would I\ndon't know so I guess that's something\nelse I would like to talk about just\nbeing blind community desire to scream\nbut I've always been in my head about\nseries of things my brain likes to find\nexcuses but once\nI can't get past is like the use of\ncertain emotes and like especially when\nyou have to understand social justice\nand you see that there's so much use of\nracial emote racial emotes to talk about\nlike when they're a stereotype comes\nover a caricature they use the email in\nrelation to that caricature and why is\nit that one like stealing is talked\nabout stream they start using a black\nlike the c'mon bro trihard and things\nlike that like and I don't want to be\nthe person to like ruin people's fun\nI've always try to not be that person\nbut is this something that I personally\nlike this I just find it really\ndifficult to get past a lot of time yes\nso like what is it like being a black\ngamer I mean I feel like it almost oh no\nit definitely ties right back into that\nidentity thing like on the like it's\njust a common theme like okay when I'm\nwith a bunch of other black people all\nright I'm the African guys so I'm not\nreally one of them alright if I'm with\nwhite people on the black guy I'm not\nreally one of them when when I'm with\ngamers no I'm you know black gamer not\nreally one of them so you're not really\nalways feels like I'm not really allowed\nto be part of any group so yeah it just\nfeels like the same thing over and over\nagain it feels a lot like being the butt\nof the joke sometimes it feels a lot\nlike especially when I play something\nlike League of Legends that's known for\nhaving a toxic community sometimes it's\ntough realizing that you're the c'mon\nbro you're the trihard seven or you're\nthe the mean that's being made fun of\nand it sucks that your culture is the\nbutt of the joke and and it's weird\nseeing that level of toxicity so\nnormalized to I can't tell you how many\noften times growing up seeing just so\nmuch toxic behavior on online gaming and\nit's always a black community and it's\ntough it sucks being that part of the\njoke yeah and look at black people have\nseems to serve as the punchline in a lot\nof jokes too and I think that person for\nme like certain streamers I like I'll\nfind them funny but it's also that\nracial agitation as a joke has always\nbeen like a pretty common thing on this\nplatform like I don't like to call names\nlike I like Greek god X I think he I\nrespect his property maybe his weight\nloss the things he's done to improve\nyourself as a\nbut like his liberal use a trial heart\nthroughout all of his screaming career\nand the way in which he look like he\ndoesn't take seriously when it's being\nused or even mostly being used it\nstimulates this idea of trihard seven\nand I feel like I don't want to take\nthat see I won't see you as a joke and\nsee like oh yeah this joking but so I\nhave a couple questions but first can\nyou guys start by explaining to me what\nthese terms mean I I don't know what\nkind of like poke jump that's like\nexcitement a common broad be is a\npicture or 'man of a black person as\nwell as the tripod which is of trihex\nwhich FEMA and people use it for\nwhenever something seen as black comes\non stream and they would spam that email\nso so the the emotes are actually like\nof people with dark skin yes and you're\nreferencing actual black because for a\nsecond there because I use the word\ntrihard a lot but yeah but that's the\ndifferent context than the original\ncause my priority I talk like you're\ntrying harder the game arts yeah exactly\nthat's the rich that's a proper use of\ntrihard trihex is a streamer on Twitch\nwho's black and here an emo it his email\nfrom way back when when teachers are\nlike in the early stages of Twitch got\nit and he is the one who and I think\nhe's originally a track around it's like\na Kona cake alone it was a real person\nfrom twitch and that's the only email on\nTwitch at the time and he uploaded it to\ntest I think was test a test stream\nlatches test nightbot well nonetheless\nthese are like an L is another one of\nthose ones who describes a Muslim person\nand I think Nam describes an Asian\nperson but I'm not sure which\nnationality specifically but there's so\nmany different ones they're literally\njust a person who is of a specific race\nthat that's crazy I didn't realize I\nmean I guess it's no surprise that\nthey're racist emotes but but I wasn't\naware of that so I'm kind of curious um\nmo you were talking about sort of like\nyou know sort of how can I say like\nthere's almost a certain constancy to\nwhat you guys face\nin terms of like it's like I'm just\nhearing all of you guys talk about\ngaming and that there's like just an\nadditional layer of [ __ ] that keeps you\nfrom having fun when you gain like what\ndoes that make sense like I don't know\nhow else to put it\nwhat is that yeah how does that do to\nyou\nuh it makes me it makes me want to build\nup barriers and it makes me like develop\na thicker skin I find like seeing like\nfor example playing World of Warcraft or\nLeague of Legends I see so many people\nwhose usernames are just altered\nspellings of the n-word or big n-word or\nsomething like that like just finding\nsome way to be to use that word in any\nterm it's and it feels as almost if it's\nas if it's like super force on their\npart but when I see that you grow like\nindifferent to it you recognize that\nthat's not you you recognize that that's\nnot true you realize that like you just\nhave to develop these barriers I find to\njust have such a thicker skin because of\nit yeah so like you know that actually\nseems so insidious to me because it's\nlike you have to you have another layer\nof like cognitive [ __ ] that you're\ndealing with you mean you're playing a\ngame like I've experienced a fair amount\nof racism in my life like I grew up in\nEast Texas and I'm brown and you know\nany color except for white in in sexist\nyou know you deal with racism and at the\nsame time though when I play video games\nlike I never think about my ethnicity\nunless I'm like doing an Indian accent\nand being as racially offensive as\npossible you know and so I'm just like\nI'm just imagining that when you guys\nlike play games it's sort of like you\nhave to do some kind of like work or\nit's just hard for you to just like play\na game yeah you got to keep up the\nquotes which even while you're playing\nthe game if you want to play games of\nrandom people and then you end up miner\nqueueing with a kid who who this as soon\nas he hears a black guy's voice these\nthings he needs to start acting some\nkind of way or start saying the n-word\nto start doing something extra and the\nbeats the kind of thing it's not just\ngaming but like even just being out in\npublic in general the first time I\nreally experienced like being seen as a\nstereotype like fully was one that guy\nfrom France this um this exchange doing\nit I wasn't mad about it I'm about this\nthis is a bigger portrayal about how\nblack people character or black people\nin the\nbut the first thing he did when he saw\nme was throw gang signs say and\neverywhere so say hi and I understood\nthat he was trying to be nice and you\nthat's us but is this a caricature and\ncharacter something that has always\nbothered me since I was very young this\nbecause you recognize the ways in which\nblack people have been even like similar\nnot as black people any race for that\nmatter days and white has been\nassimilated in society was through their\ncaricature so if you've played into the\ncaricature you played into those ways in\nwhich were already seen that people have\nthe question then you can find success\nin the conventional society you can\nassimilate into heteronormative parts of\nsociety yeah that's deep man I'm also\nkind of just noticing that you guys have\na I'm sourcing another identity piece\nhere to that like you know it seems like\nyou guys are just not treated for who\nyou are it's like 80% of who you are or\nmaybe even less than 20% of like what\npeople think you are yeah yeah for sure\nwhat's that like time in a row it's very\ntiring and that's what places my\ndepression as well because and it just\nmakes being alive and having to be an\nactor in the world very tiring it feels\nlike I'm constantly putting on a face\nand it feels like I shouldn't have to do\nthat either\nthat won't keep all my have is like\nwatching black kids have to get used to\nhearing the n-word why should they have\nto even get like Mama's having to get\nused to ignorant now this black kids for\nany race for that matter why'd you have\nto get used to ignorant it's like of\ncourse you should go thick-skinned a\nvirgin who learn to not be too sensitive\nbut why is that some of that person\nshould have to get used to why should\nthey have to get used to hate yeah\nwhat's it like to have to get used to\nhate\nand I don't know if you want to jump in\nbecause I can't face I was kind of\nthinking a lot because like in high\nschool a lot of times like the way I\nwould just like to kind of like\ncustomize to fit in basically I was just\nalways making like jokes about myself or\nwhatever\nDemaryius well that was until my teacher\nlike pointed them out you like join I\nlike you okay do you like hey no it's\nlike you think it's funny so play along\nand now it's just horrible Julian your\nvoice is still coming through kind of\nrobotic oh sorry\nthere we go would you go okay I move my\nmic to play a game that's like oh yeah I\njust moved it a bit okay great yeah now\nit's - what what did you hear\nnot much okay I'll try I'll try that\nagain I'm in high school I'm like I had\nso and they were like it's like Florida\nit's kind of like a deep south oh\nthey're pretty racist and like just fit\nin I would just make myself and\neverything and they got some of my we\nwere like some of my teachers were like\nconcerned that like I actually hated my\nface or something I was like no I don't\nreally care it's just like makes them\nlaugh like I'll just be with and that's\nnot so it sounds like you're living an\nactor - yeah but it's it's really like\ntired like I think you said to be like\nusing like a willpower to keep going and\nI'm like at some point start to run out\nhearing other people kind of say that -\nI'm kind of curious\nit was aachen is that right am i\npronouncing that right uh not exactly\nbut I take aachen as well knocking\nknocking okay\nyeah Hawking and and Raymond do y'all\nwant to jump in like what's any thoughts\nabout what we're talking about\nyeah I mean now that I mean now that\npeople are talking about it I'm kind of\nlike reflecting on like so for high\nschool I went to a predominantly white\nschool and like at the time I was a\nloner and I was like okay that's just my\nthing\nwhich is true to an extent but I do\nthink that being one of like three black\nguys in high school made me much more\nextremely of a loner\nand I think it was yeah and I think it\nwas there was a lot of like these guys\nit felt like these guys had never seen a\nblack person before so they just had all\nthese really dumb like these really dumb\nblack jokes like not intended to be\noffensive but they're like wow I've\nnever gotten to use this before kind of\nthing and it was just like it's just\nlike a constant like facepalm kind of\nsituation and but you know that like I\nknow they don't have a bad intention to\nit so it's just like I guess I just got\nto sit here and listen to this nonsense\nevery single day and I think that it\ndoes highlight the difference between us\nand made it easier for me to feel\nisolated and I already would have\nprobably like I already would have\nisolated myself a little but that just\nmade it extreme where I was like talking\nto almost no one oh yeah I'm for me I\nguess for in terms of being an actor I\ncome from South London and I'm Nigerian\nas well so we have a lot of slang that\nwe use but working in like a\nprofessional environment I felt like I\nhad to act a certain way to kind of\nsurvive if that makes sense\nso um I guess trying to be understand\nwhat that means\nso if like being myself or I'm using\nlike slang terms that I may use like it\nmay be a joke but I fam and prov if you\nguys might like\nI guess like in the professional setting\nwhere let's say like it is a boardroom\nand everyone speaking a posture and in\nposh English sort of way I felt like I\nhad to imitate that too\n- if that makes us have to imitate that\n- I guess to survive in the workplace\nand I felt like sometimes I had to also\nbe overly friendly as well so like when\nI go into elevators and stuff like that\nI'm smiling everyone that knows me in my\npersonal life um I try to be kind or\nwherever possible but um whenever I\ncan't but um when I go into an elevator\nthe first ring first instincts of like a\nwoman would be like to clench onto her\nhandbag or say oh he scared me when I'm\njust walking like a normally walk is I'm\nnot trying to be scary I'm just me um\nand I guess yeah just having to be\noverly friendly so I don't scare anyone\num I feel like yeah that's how I feel in\nterms of acting in the workplace a lot\nyeah we have to be constantly aware of\nthe fact that people see you in some\nkind of way and that's why I don't like\nbeing around cops I've never liked being\naround even when doing nothing wrong\nI've been put like stops I'm lucky I'm\nlucky telling you stop twice in my life\nbut each of the contexts in which I\nwould stop a little something stupid and\njust because the fact I'm walking around\nwhile being black in the neighborhood\nthat's apparently supposed to be Dom new\nUI and I've growing up in like here in\nBoston this is Dorchester and there's\nSouth Boston and I went I grew up going\nto a school from fifth to twelfth grade\nthat was predominantly white because it\nbordered between those two neighborhoods\nand because of that experienced I found\nthat you always have to be walking on\nbecause even when I was we had like\ndebates on things black lives matter\nback in 2014 during the Ferguson riots\nthere were always the perspective of\nthese kids and I've never got angry at\nthem so much is the fact that I was just\nsad that their own ignorance because\nthey were unwilling to learn or only to\nsee a world outside themselves which\nsong says black lives matter it doesn't\nmean that other people's lives don't\nmatter\nthat is making a statement and you can\nalso say Asian lives matter we can say\nHispanic lives matter you could say\nIndian lives matter you can say so many\npeople's lives matter but it doesn't\ndevalue the lives of other people\nbut other people still have the desire\nto say that no all lives matter but why\nshould you even have split no before\nthat I think those two things are not\nmutually exclusive they can coexist but\nI had to find that most of my childhood\nwas having to educate people on I don't\nlike the closest phrases you have to\neducate your oppressor to say the least\nthat's and that's the closest thing I\ncan understand to be able to express\nlike much of my life has been trying to\neducate people on where I'm coming from\nand not being defined my skin can you\nguys explain to us what what black lives\nmatter means to you yeah to me black\nlives matter too I think that's what\npeople sometimes forget is that we're\nnot seeing only black lives matter we're\nsaying black lives matter too and I\nthink that's the biggest distinction\nwhen I hear it like growing up in Canada\nit's I hear more polite forms of racism\nbeing told something like all lives\nmatter or being told that there's only\none race and that's human you're\nundermining the true ethnicity that I am\nyou're undermining my experiences and\nthe shared experiences of many cultures\nand many diasporas and when you when you\nsay something like all lives matter yeah\nobviously we get that our lives do\nmatter but black lives matter too that's\nmy plan and racists have literally\nemployed Lee what he just said there's\nonly one race in the human race but we\nhave the right to say we want to keep\nthis place white I've literally heard\nthose words verbatim in the interview I\nwish I could pull it up right now but in\nthe interview that Oprah wrench we did a\nlong time ago I forget which location\nthat was but it was location would that\n- filled with tons of um hate crimes\nagainst black people and where the levy\nhas Brady anywhere in places that black\npeople congregate and it's the\nexperience that clouds matter to me is\nthat no matter how wrong the crime a\nblack person has committed he don't\ndeserve to die on the street like a dog\nand I've had to select my especially now\nwith the protester but having recently I\nthink I should seek men's out this\nmental health help mental health help\nwith this because after have\nto see so many black people die in the\nstreet and like you shouldn't having to\nsee people bleed out like usually you're\nseeing it you're with your own eyes are\nyou seeing like what what human being\nlooks like as they're dying especially a\nblack like this for two cops hitting the\nperson down and they're not holding\nstill for any whatever reason might be\nthey just get shot and killed and then\nthey hang cuff them and I just had to\nsee that at least ten times in the past\nweek alone and it's I feel like the fact\nI'm so desensitized to it bothers me a\nlot\nbecause I'm the kind of person who's\nnaturally apathetic and I feel other\npeople's fit pain very strongly and I'm\nat the point where I can look at that\nand I just I can I keep I can keep I\njust character keeps growing and that's\nwhy I haven't been on social media that\nmuch recently because as much as I want\nto be retweeting what's happening and\ntrying to spread awareness about what's\nhappening the revolution that's going on\nit is difficult in the sense that you\nsucceed how much would like Keibler why\ndid why did why does it take people to\ndie for justice to come why do we wait\nhas to wait until after Brianna Taylor\nis dead or George Florida is dead or\nArmen Aubree's dead or Tamir rice is\ndead like so many young black people and\nblack trans people - or black people of\nany kind of identity why do they have to\ndie first for justice a sense of like it\nshouldn't be this way that's what I'm\nhearing like in it it's not it's not\njust people dying although you know\ndefinitely applies there but like even\njust you know just the way you guys grew\nup and like when I'm thinking about\nRaymond walking into a boardroom like\nyou just can't speak like he I and I'm\ninferring that you sort of speak\ndifferently and I use you guys just it's\nI don't know how to it's like you guys\nare playing life like on hardmode it's\nlike what's the normal game and then\nthere's the game with like all this\nother like layer of [ __ ] piled on top\nmaybe Gioconda on the games that they\nmade um the black if you made your\ncharacter black yeah\n20 percent greater chance to be stopped\nby the police like minus five to speech\nor like people's reactions to you or\nlike you know get a job you get rejected\nimmediately yep the big day it's really\nlike what I think about playing a game\nI've been playing like I don't know if\ny'all played total war but I've been\nI've been playing a lot of total war and\nit's like literally like the game just\nyou know on hardmode it's like you just\nget like penalties to everything it's\nlike number of people you can connect\nwith easily at school goes down from\nlike 52 it's just like I mean I'm\nlaughing about it but I mean it sounds\n[ __ ] awful like it just it just just\nharder like it sounds a little bit more\ntiring a little bit more exhausting it\nsounds like you guys just have to spend\na little bit more energy or maybe even a\nlot more energy to kind of do things I'm\nreally curious though Raymond it's just\nso fascinating though what do you think\nwould happen if you didn't change the\nway that you spoke um\nI've got no idea I have to try it to\nfind all yeah yeah I mean although I\nthink would happen I guess it would be a\nlot harder for people to understand me\nbecause I work in a global company and\nthere's people from all around the world\nso when we do like a zoom call or a\nWebEx cool if I was to speak in a South\nLondon accent or pidgin English which is\ndialect in the Yerba culture which is in\nNigeria it will I would think that it's\nit would be a lot harder for people to\nunderstand what I'm saying because of it\nbeing a another dialect or Lang it's the\nsame language but yeah it was a bit\nharder to understand I guess maybe I can\ntry try and discuss them trying this and\nsee if you guys on sunny you want to go\nfor it I was just kind of curious like\nyou know what what happens when you guys\nbecause I\nthis kind of comes back to identity that\nyou know so I'm getting the sense that\nit's hard for y'all to be like fully\nauthentic and yeah I'm kind of curious\nlike have you guys so you know I think\nthat a lot of times we learn the\nbehaviors that we do right so like we\nlearn to put up barriers we learn or the\nreason that we put up areas is because\nwhen we don't have barriers we get hurt\nin some way so I'm kind of curious have\nyou guys had periods of your life or\nthings that you remember where you like\nreally did try to be you and you were\nlike punished for it I mean I guess kind\nof start like move back home I have like\nthe greatest childhood and he he doesn't\nallow me to think for myself I think I\nwas talking about I wanted to do again\nthe future just like I was like what\ncool and he said like if I did that I\nwould be failing him and like oh yeah\nbasically when I came home oh is that\nbetter\nyes yeah yeah okay I'll try it's like\nthis law only wants you to transmit the\nwords is that better hopefully this\nworks um but when I came back home and\nI'm just around my relationship I tried\nit like I was thinking about like maybe\nlooking into psychology because I\nwouldn't want to work on like a prison\nreform like better committed to the work\nforce afterwards and I told my dad this\nand he told me he like if I did that I\nwouldn't fail and all the work you do\nand I gave him like a second chance like\na be like triple down on it I'll say\nI'm gonna be stuff Julian I'm just gonna\nask someone else to just kind of reflect\nback what they heard just because it\ndidn't come through entirely clearly did\nsomebody want to just share hurt from\nJulian yes right so Julian's saying that\nyou want side of psychology program well\nhe was talking to his dad he wanted to\ndo something different with psychology I\ncould help with Prison Reforms and\npeople get reactivated Society and he\nwell his father disagreed and said that\nyou shouldn't do that and they talked\nabout it again and if I'll double down\non it and I think he said that he has to\nbe material on his own and that's beyond\nhis own to be able to figure to get be\nand do the things he wants to do yeah I\nmean I don't I don't want to skip the\npart where he his dad said if you do\nthat you will waste everything that I've\ndone for you yeah by god that's [ __ ]\nbrutal Jesus does that resonate with you\nfor a particular reason I mean it sounds\nlike um I mean my like my parents are I\nmean my mom is very is actually very\nnice but like I think from every other\nNigerian American that I've ever met\nthere is just a lot of pressure to like\nbe like the best ever though at this\npoint at this what I mean my mom is like\npretty mellow at this point but it's\nalready so deep in my psyche that that's\njust my own internal voice at this point\nso I yeah I would like that would be my\nown mind telling me like yeah if you do\nthis other thing then you're naughty\nyou're wasting all of the efforts of of\nyour parents of of everything that\nyou've done up to this point so it\nresonates on that level same here bro\nlike that's new to me too and I've had\nthe connotation my mom because college\nis very difficult thing for me and I\ntried having the conversation my mom\nseemed this defer for last semester\nbecause I wasn't doing well in school\nbecause my rising much messed up my\nfirst year and even got so heated to the\npoint\nwhere he said if he thinks he knows so\nmuch better he can live on his own and I\nlike that she would say that because I\nit really mess with my mental for a\nlittle while and still does in a lot of\nways but I also struggled with the fact\nthat she only sees me an extension of\nherself especially when I got my first\ntattoo\nit became the kind of thing where I\nwasn't able to be who I wanted me for\nmyself there was only about how she saw\nme who she thought I needed to be in the\nworld and all her fears and trip and\nshe's also a Christian she wants to be a\nminister so that's that on top of all\nthe other things you know it's but I'm\nlucky that she is at least as accepting\nas she is because my brother is\ntransferred female male and he has been\nable to experience that for himself and\nbe a human being in the world and be a\nfull person in the world because she\nlistens to what I have to say one day\nand was able to accept that but her\nwhere her beliefs aside Elaine be who he\nis so I do believe there's a hope for my\nrelationship with my mom but just being\nable to understand how to talk to her\nand make amends with all the things in\nwhich we have dealt with because she had\nbeen in a similar situation as Alfonso I\nwas gonna say like Oh super wholesome\nyou said your brother yeah brother I'm\nout here I guess have you guys found\nsorry I wanted to say something I just\nlost its right of it yeah so I you know\nit sounds like Julian's dad was pretty\nrough on him it sounds like a keen and\nEli's mom mother's have been pretty\nsupportive I'm curious what about it\nlike how what's been he also\nrelationship with your dad or if Moe or\nRaymond want to jump in like a so it\nsounds like family dynamics are pretty\ndifferent yes so my parents emigrated to\nthe UK when off in their late 20s so um\nthey had a lot of expectations when I\nwas younger so I'm guessing this is\nsimilar to lot of immigrant cultures\nwhere is Eva\nfirst class which is an A in the u.s. or\nbust so this this is I think my second\ntime trying uni University and I'm\nliking it a lot more now but now that\nI've said okay I'm just going to do my\nbest is not I have to get a first class\nI have to get 70% half to get the A+ is\nit's just me trying my best but um I\nstruggled a lot with perfectionism\nbecause um the only time I saw my dad\nhappy was when I came home with the\nlevel 5 which is like the yeah with the\nheight which is like a high school in\nprimary school I guess the terms let me\nlet me translate the American middle\nschool miss school that might be okay\nlike the high school in middle school if\nI got like a seeds like why didn't you\nget an eighth if I get one got my 4% why\ndidn't you why did you miss that 6%\nbecause it was sort of point where um\nyeah it's never like yes it's never it\nwas never enough unless it was a hundred\npercent and even if it was a hundred\npercent it was just a yes yeah let's see\nyou do again yeah exactly\nso yeah going through therapy it out on\ntank all of those mental models I had of\nperfectionism I have to get that a\nbecause a lot of back I couldn't control\nand all I could do was my best and when\nI got to the the person was marking it\nmaybe if they're having a bad day or\nthey had the argument their girlfriend\nthey might be like okay let me give this\nperson their 65 is over 70 and yeah yeah\nherpes helped a lot but I feel like he\nis something does I shared amongst all\nof us here\nwell he's Louis I just wanted to care\napply my mom has been supportive but for\nit's only within things that fit her\nframe her paradigm and slowly she's\ncoming out of that but like I relate to\nwhat he just said so strongly and it's\nstill a problem that I deal with right\nnow my mom because college is just I\nwant to help people my life but I just\ndon't like a key\nany more and just in methods this past\nthree months was really hard for me\nsimply because I could not even get\nmyself the type of word in an essay and\nI was struggling with this doing online\nclasses simply I it just felt like all\nthe trauma of academia was rising up in\nme in that moment and I wasn't able to\nperform anymore because there just\ndidn't feel worth de anymore and I get\nto that point so many times with school\nalright so let me actually ask you guys\nfirst so like what do you guys think\nabout our discussion so far is the only\nthing they don't talk more about or\nanything that I think is just like to\nkind of check in with you guys what do\nyou guys how do you think we're doing I\nthink I think a night Opik we should\ntouch on as well as the idea of like\nnormality and the idea within cultures\nof like what is normal and I are\nsupposed to be a true African I supposed\nto be a healthy person I also struggle a\nlot with like toxic masculinity as well\nI find it's really prevalent in a lot of\nour culture especially amongst youth and\nespecially amongst the older heads as\nwell it's you know real men don't cry\nand real men don't have these feelings\nand real men aren't this and real men\naren't sick and all that type of stuff\nand it's those stigmas that really\naffected me personally I remember I'm\nthankful in the sense that my family has\nbeen pretty supportive in a lot of\naspects especially with my mental health\nbut it took them a while to work up to\nthat it took them a while to get used to\nit I struggle a lot with my peers I find\nthat it's difficult to be myself around\ncertain groups of friends and especially\ngrowing up in high school I had that\nissue a lot naturally I'm a very\nenergetic and flamboyant person but I\nhave to tone that down and I have to you\nknow not be gay or not be this way or\nnot be that or in stuff like that not be\ntoo black not be too Arabic and not be\ntoo whatever and I think it's a similar\nwhat Raymond deals with in the board\nroom like it's you have to police your\nown language and you have to police\nyourself and it sucks and it's straining\nto have to constantly do that so let's\ntalk about that mo so in the chat\nsomeone in the chat said define sorry\ninterrupt the Sun sets that define toxic\nmasculinity talk so toxic masculinity\nvisit my personal experience of my\nunderstanding the definition was it's\nthe kind of mescaline that forces you to\nbe a specific kind of way isn't matter\nwhat way that is but usually it's\naggressive hyper-masculinity\nthat is the toxic kind of thing and\nthings that devalue you if you don't fit\nthe common frame what a man is and my\nmom is also like women also perpetuate\nand my culture at least perpetuate that\nsame thing I'm supposed to be the man of\nthe house originally being the only boy\nin the family being the man of the house\nis making her believing that I have to\nbe responsible for things or acting a\ncertain kind of way to look a certain\nkind of way or perform in certain ways\nsimply because I'm a guy anybody else\nwant to add to he lies definition thanks\nfor that man kind of it's how do I\nexplain those it's kind of what I like\nthe world's kind of just jumping their\nown like you go but you should be on you\nand usually it's just like like why\naren't you doing this and like why are\nyou doing this sort of this and you\nshould be like everyone else to here\nlike you should yeah that's level rather\nthan work that right now really yeah\nyeah I I hate that there are strong\nfeelings of shame when it comes to toxin\nmasculinity you feel embarrassed that\nbecause you're not a certain way or you\nfeel like like it's always people\nshaming you into acting a certain way\nand that's never a good motivator I\ndon't think for like how would it be and\nneither is that correct in the first\nplace Oh what have you been shamed into\ndoing I guess having like a traditional\njob having a traditional career with my\nfamily\nacting a certain way being traditionally\nArabic being traditionally Muslim being\ntraditionally African being the\nbreadwinner of the family and it's it's\nit's tough because I get told like when\nI first was found that life was going\nthrough my manic phases and I had my\ndealings with bipolar disorder it was\ntough because I was told to just pray it\naway I was told to you know just\nexercise and eat right don't listen to\nyour doctor he's giving you pills don't\ntake the pills but none of that should\nwork for me I know that shit's never\nworked for me it was always seeking\ngenuine help and like being able to come\nout of my own barrier and my own comfort\nzone to accept that I need help and to\ngo forward with that and it sucks cuz\nit's like I have to break through so\nmany learned behaviors that I was shamed\ninto into feeling like it like if it's\nreally tough it's really tough\nyeah I'm gonna ask people if they've had\na similar experience but I just want to\ncomment for a second cuz you said you\nhad to break through your own barriers\nto accept help I think they're really\ninsidious thing is you don't have to\nbreak through your barriers you had to\nbreak through the barriers that people\nput around mm-hmm right like the idea\nthat you can't get help or that you\nshouldn't get help or you know help is\nfor the weak is not something that came\nfrom you it came from the people around\nme and and I I just want to be a little\nbit careful I'm a big fan of like\npersonal growth and overcoming your own\nchallenges but I'm what I'm hearing from\nyou guys pretty overwhelmingly is that\nlike the challenges that you guys face\nor not ones that you put up its the\nchallenges that people put on you right\nlike 94% isn't good enough even 100\npercent isn't good enough you've got to\ndo it like what about tomorrow you know\nand and I think what I'm hearing from\nyou guys over and over and over again is\nthat it's not like it's not you it's the\npeople around you and the expectations\nthat you put on yourself and then\neventually you end up thinking like like\nHakeem does with like oh I'm a lazy\npiece of [ __ ] and get my confidence back\nI should do a project all on my own I'm\ncurious what are you the rest you guys\nthink about that I've been there and I\nfelt that so strongly especially when I\nwas you into seven years old because\nwhen my teacher said I was lazy that's\nbecause I couldn't focus in class\nbecause I was not able to be the person\nthat my everybody tells me I need to be\nto be successful in this life and that\nmade me feel as I can never really be\nsuccessful in my own personal dreams and\nmaybe on lose desire to do anything this\ncreative constructive or pursue anything\noutside of academia because it felt as\nthough that was worthless the eyes of\neverybody around me what do you guys do\nlike I can't place it\nsorry never say I'm sorry the thing is\nthe lack of the belief was yes so what\ndo you guys think about our teens plan\nand sorry if I'm sort of shifting gears\nfor a second but I just can't let this\nslide because at the end of the day like\nI feel like yeah I want to tackle\nsomething with you guys and and I\nnoticed that I just can't help myself in\nthe sense that I get I get the sense\nthat I Keane is a little bit stuck right\nnow\nand and we should think about that\nbecause you all have felt that way too\nand I can't sorry if I'm putting you on\nthe spot man\nno it's great so like what do you guys\nthink about his plan of like finishing a\nproject on himself so he can build\nconfidence I understand why he feels the\nneed to do that because I kind of picked\non that myself\nyeah just just with like general\nschooling like like last like towards\nthe end I had a friend die and then my\ngrades dropped not really um so then the\nnext semester I didn't like accept help\nfrom anyone else like I'm gonna do with\nthis mister myself to prove it I can't\ncontinue being an engineer like I did a\nlot better\nother people are thoughts I've tried\nI started writing everyday I think I'm\nnot sure if it was you I think it was\nyou motivating you start writing more\nevery day when I was watching one of\nyour strings but I that's one project\nand I started drawing trying to be more\ncreative saw my own I wrote a first poem\nI've read in years\nI just tried I think that's my personal\nproduct maybe but I couldn't understand\nhis need to do that to feel creative but\nI mean fueled I can stick well well is\nit doing it as a solution to get back on\ntrack but for me work doing more work\nhas always been more inversely\nproportional to my happiness\nyeah I would agree with that as well and\nso for me I've got like an assignment\ndude in one month or whenever I look at\nthe top of the mountain okay I've got\nfive thousand requests to write it\nsounds so crazy like ah how am I gonna\nfind the time um but breaking up into\nsmall simple steps so I've got like some\nproductivity journals and I've been\nreading a book called limitless by Jim\nquick and he talks about something\ncalled small simple steps so I always\nthink about okay what's a small thing\nthat I definitely can't feel it so it\nmight be okay\nsomething really small okay let me open\nup the word document okay let me write a\ntitle let me write one sentence let me\nsearch this journal let me search this\njournal and every single time I hit one\nof those accomplishments I feel a\ngreater sense of of calm confidence in\nmyself that okay I might be able to do\nthis so I hours out here also I could\nnot point that um a small project can\nhelp you with confidence a key one thing\ntoo that happened to me though in\nrelation to what you just expect what\nyou just said so I learned that too from\nthis book called Isola I'm not giving a\n[ __ ] and I also went to the game with\nhim TED Talks and also dr. Kane talked\nabout being the bare minimum and that\nwas what got me start writing again but\nI started having that before\nwhen they came to those essays and\ndepression I was doing with those past\nthree months and I was dealing with so\nit's like I couldn't I wasn't trying to\ndo that one word or those like English\ntight like the title this feeling of I\ncouldn't breathe was rise up and ruin me\nand I wouldn't even be able to do that\nand I think that's something that has\ntaught me that I need to reevaluate a\nlot of things about my life because I\nwas in the place where like I was saying\nwith the abuse and things why do I feel\nas though there's no point even doing\nthis anymore I can't get myself do the\nbare minimum and before I was able to\nmotivate myself using my mom's like how\nhow she had to work and how everything\nshe sacrificed to come to America and\neverything she sacrificed for us to have\nthe life that we have I was able to let\nthat motivate me for a while but that\njust doesn't work anymore and I was very\nI became very spiritual - over the past\nyear after reading power of now learning\nhow to meditate and be able to have the\nability to bring mindfulness into each\nmoment that really helped me get through\nthe past year but for some reason to\nstop being enough so let me let me just\nask I'm curious about that Eli but let\nme just go back to a keen for a second\naki do you get the sense that so julian\nuse the phrase prove it I can do you get\nthe sense that like completing a project\non your own is proving something\nabsolutely what are you trying to prove\nI mean on a very like like on a very\nlogical level I do like I do think I\nactually need to prove that I can do the\nwork given that I was fired and it would\nbe a very good story to tell at my\ninterview that I completed a project and\nhave sole whatever issue got me fired in\nthe first place but then on a more\nemotional level I like getting fired\nfrom that job was kind of like the\nnatural culmination of like how I've\nalways done things I have always\nhappiness everything had been lazy for\nliterally my entire life and so I would\nlike to prove to myself that that is no\nlonger a thing at some point and I guess\nI want this to be the proof of that so\nI'm sure that your colleagues and\nsympathize with that I'm kind of curious\nRaymond when you were talking about you\nknow opening up the word document and\nputting the title on there are you\ntrying to prove anything\nyeah that I can't do something because\num I'm 23 now and I've been diagnosed\nI'm not sure if is why is to say some of\nthe diagnosis of I've had but yeah\nhopefully it helps someone and so I've\nbeen diagnosed recently with ADHD\nanxiety and depression and sorry an\nadult age and yeah that felt weird to\nsay that um like whenever I told some\nsomebody does it feel it felt like an\nexcuse that I love the time when I was\nlike trying to read my textbooks I was\nlike okay how come I can't read this\ntrying to read for 20 minutes and how\ncome it's not going into my head I'll\ntry and read the again and I hear like a\nbird outside wall and I get distracted I\nhave to focus back on the book and yeah\nso and what was the question but yeah it\nwas limiting me and I kind of resented\nit before that like I was always just\nupset that I was a TD or everyone it was\naffecting like my productivity and\neverything and I don't really talk about\nkind of them it sounds to me like what\nyou're feeling is that you know you\nalways knew that something was really\nhard for you but your other people\ndidn't understand it and it was like\nwe're trying to tell people like hey\nthis is actually hard like I'm not I'm\nnot stupid\nlet me sit down and I work hard and the\nletters just don't come into my head\nafter 20 minutes you know and then\npeople basically held you to a standard\nthat was not who you are\nand it comes back to identity it's like\nyou tried to tell people who you are and\nand what just think about this right\nbecause we think about ADHD is an\nillness or a deficiency and so it's even\nweird for me to say like you are like\nyou were a completely normal human being\nin that moment and the world didn't\ntreat you that way and it can be hard\nfor you to find a reason and even then I\ndon't I don't know if you guys have seen\nme like talk about ADHD before but I\nthink basically like you guys aren't ill\nit's just your brain is not designed to\nlook at a text book for an hour because\nthere are lots of different brains and\nand like when we were evolving like no\nhuman being had to sit in one place for\nan hour and stare at one object and and\nI kind of talked a little bit about\nhunters versus farmers and hunters or\npeople that are taking in a lot of\ndifferent stimuli and new environments\nand then there are farmers that like to\nwake up the same time every day and do\nthe same thing every day until they die\nand there are different kinds of brains\nmany people are wondering you know\nRaymond is a toughie which is kind of\ninteresting because your ADHD is about\nthat kind of mindset but but yeah I mean\nI think what I'm hearing from you\nRaymond is really that like it feels\nsomewhat liberating together a diagnosis\nis that fair yeah I would definitely\nagree with that because all this time I\nwas told that I was late lazy I'm not\ntrying hard enough even though I'll try\nok let me read this textbook for 2 hours\nbut it's just not going in I'm trying my\nhardest place it was it was so difficult\nbut it kind of felt like a sense of\nrelief that okay there's something I can\ndo about it it's not it's not that I'm\nhopeless it's something I can work on\nand yeah that bus world say own it for\nsure\nI can walk with Moses I was it sorry\nwhat was this wants me to ask Alfons or\nthink it's Julius I'm sure you want\nJulian yeah he wants us to see if you\ncan use your phone on your webcam mic or\nyour phone oh I'll try the right now\nthanks Eli hello hey still hear me yeah\nyeah better all right good fixed thanks\nEli so I can't let me ask you something\nhow long have you felt like you're a\nlazy piece of [ __ ] I'm trying to\nremember if there was a time where I was\nlike seven or eight or so right so like\nI'm kind of curious like you know when\nwere you guys taught these things about\nyourself you feel - it's like when you\nfail to perform I guess and you feel\nthat you fail to perform precision gauge\nbecause math was something I really\nstruggle with as a kid so you have it's\nreinforced in me since I was a child\nbecause my mom would get angry at me for\nnot doing well when I was younger but I\ntried to get help with my met with\nschoolwork but it never really more\nfruit also I found a teacher as a Poulos\ncompatible with as a person who\nunderstood how I learned and I got lucky\n- yeah I've gotten that when I was in\nthe fifth grade for my because although\nI almost got held back because I had to\ngo to counseling for depression for two\nweeks\nand my grades dropped while I was away\nnow in two weeks I think was longer than\nthat but I was away from school for a\nwhile because they sent me to get\ncounseling for depression at this\nprogram and they were sending in my\nhomework or somehow somehow I said\nstarted up failing for that year and I\nhad to go with this math tutor who I end\nup actually becoming close to as a male\nmentor because I don't have a father at\nhome so is that kind of less like a\npseudo father figure that I had at the\ntime Julian you wanted to say something\nbasically like my dad was always like I\nwould always work with it and you're\nlike construction jobs basically and I\nwould my brother he's a little bit young\nhe'd do something like lately wrong and\nI'm like you know like he can get away\nwith that like why can't I my dad Julian\njust stopped half-assing everything like\nconstantly the girl was always like the\nfreight it's like I was just always told\nthat I was a lazy piece of [ __ ] and I\nwas having everything and it wasn't like\nI got out of that environment when I was\nable to like figure out like no I can't\nbe a productive person that's possible\nI'm sorry but Julian is it possible to\nchange your mic to the webcam because\nyou turned on your webcam but it\nactually didn't change the microphone\nokay yeah your webcam may not have just\nlike an inbuilt microphone or the\nalternative is to use like a mobile\ndevice phone for discord\noh I'm sorry I didn't realize you're\ntyping in the phones pound see I'm not\nthe only boomer a way to talk okay now\nyou're meeting uh you know why you may\nhave to move this is gonna be kind of\nweird turn the webcam off but move the\nwebcam closer to you if you can\nphone okay does that have discordant you\ncan't hear you yeah you're muted and\nhe's gonna try to connect through this\none yeah oh saved okay beautiful\npause noise thank you thanks Moses yeah\nI mean I I think it just comes back like\nI'm just hearing this theme over and\nover again about like you guys are just\nnot allowed to be yourselves you know\nwhether it's whether it's race or\nwhether it's like parental expectations\nor whether it's like mental health\nissues or you know like religious\nbeliefs or you know like a minute start\nso young like I really don't I mean I\ndon't I think that lazy piece of [ __ ] is\njust a poor diagnostic term it's how we\nfeel because we don't understand what's\ngoing on right it's like telling someone\nwho has cancer that they're weak because\nno one understands what cancer is it's\nlike there's something that's getting in\nthe way of you being the person that\nlike you can be and you know I I'm not\nsure exactly yeah I'm kind of curious I\nmean what what has been y'all's\nexperience so it sounds like for Raymond\nit was like sort of liberating to\ncertain kind of find a diagnosis and get\na sense of like you know some of the the\nway that his brain is wired what's it\nbeen like for you guys what's been\ny'all's experience with sort of\ninteracting with the mental health\nsystem is always been terrible I tried\nto keep therapy a lot growing up and\nmostly they told me I should just try\nfitting in those try being like\neverybody else and my brother were\nlooking nothing I told him that they\ntold me that he told me to stop seeing\nthem and but I've learned I listened to\nyou recently when you said you should\nwork with the therapist to let them know\nwhen what they're seeing isn't helping\nyou and try to have that proper dialogue\nwith them and now for my like if I\npursue therapy in the future I'll\ndefinitely try to do that previously I\ndid try to do that in some ways but it\ndidn't bear any fruit and I feel like\nwe'll probably best for me to end those\nrelationships like way I did\ndefinitely something to consider in the\nfuture well what's yeah\nit's been difficult knowing that I'm\nbipolar feels like I have a permanent\ndebuff but it's working around that\ndebuff that inspires me it gives me a\nlot of anxiety when I think about the\nfuture especially I think that's my\nnumber one problem as a person I can't\nstop thinking about the future and that\nscares me because I don't want to go\nmanic again and I'm afraid of going\nmanic again and I'm afraid of the\nfeelings that come around being bipolar\nand I'm afraid of the results of those\nactions like so for me personally before\nI was diagnosed I had a really bad manic\nepisode and they're like the trauma\nbehind that episode and the results of\nthat episode still reverberate today and\nso it's it's liberating in the sense\nthat now I know what's wrong with me\nand I get it and I totally understand\nthat and I'm working with a doctor to\nhelp that but it's still it still feels\nlike a debuff it still feels like a\nmonkey on my back but I just can't get\nrid of I'm wondering if I'm hearing like\nanother like point in the favor of it\nshouldn't be this way like that's\nanother theme I've heard from you guys\nwhat do you feel strong feeling yeah\nyeah I didn't ask for this for sure like\nit certainly feels like you know I\ndidn't ask for this [ __ ]\nbut and now it's like learning how to\ndeal with that [ __ ] what do you guys do\nwhen the world is just an unfair place\nand life is a [ __ ] game where you you\nknow you got a randomly generated\ncharacter and you're like stats or all I\nworked it's kind of make the best of it\nso I would do a whole journey of finding\nmyself since I was 13 it went through\nself-help I got addicted to\nself-development and whatnot and I was\nreading a lot of self-help books for a\nvery long time I fell into like 20\nRobbins and reading books on like having\nfriends my first one I ever read was\nhowever in friends influence people and\nyeah then I would go on from there and\nwe can be alchemists and I was my\nfavorite book of all time the book\nthey're really saving for myself and I\nwould say that it was the thing I did\nwhen they were old for like an unfair\nplace was try to create a a person that\nwould like to be the person I could look\nup to try to be the father to myself\nI didn't have growing up and those\nthrough reading books and trying to look\nthrough our lists like people like Alan\nWatts or the book house as a man\nthinketh by James Allen looking for help\nlooking for answers I would say it was -\nlooking for answers died trying to find\nit but try to find who I was and kept on\nputting myself out there and I grew up\nvery awkward because I didn't have that\nmany friends and II know many people so\nI challenged myself often to meet new\npeople however I was really bad talking\nto girls especially me and my dating\nlife or something that I wanted to get\nright and it was do telling myself to\ntalk to girls and mess up over and over\nand over again learn about it and learn\nto see them first of all he knew his\nhuman beings because that's something\nthat you definitely not taught when\ngovernor talks I'm asking the household\nbut um it was to learning that and\nhaving female friends and going through\nso many different things and learning to\nlove even if that even if those people\nthat you love hate you just because the\nway you look June to love them anyway\nthat's what have really helped me and\nchoosen to find things that makes me\nhappy in my worst moments like music and\nart so I know I think it's it's tricky\nbecause like on the one hand I hear Eli\ntalking I'm curious what you guys think\nabout this and I hear him say like I\ntaught myself to be the you know the\nfather that I'd like to be my own father\nto be to be the father that I didn't\nhave and that sounds like so\ninspirational and at the same time I\nfeel like it's like kind of crushing -\nwhat do y'all how do y'all feel about\nthat statement I mean it seems\nsignificant to me I thought it was\nsignificant to you guys I think like\nobviously I resonate with that a lot\nbecause I see that I can think about it\na lot like I would just think about what\nthings that could have been different\nabout my childhood that I could change\nand be different but the weird thing is\nlike my dad probably had those same\nthoughts you know anything like um his\ndad was like far worse than him and he\ntells me about it and you he's trying to\nbe better and I understand but when I\nknow that my dad also had similar\nthoughts and like this is still the\noutcome like it kind of worries me a bit\nlike for how I might turn out moer you\nor even there he might turn out I'm all\nthe time\nI got worried I because I do everything\nin my power to not be my father and I\ntry my best to not fit into any mold but\nit's difficult because I feel like I'm\nconstantly trying to adapt and if you\nlike I'm constantly trying to fit the\nneeds of what I need at the moment in\ntime but it's difficult I I feel like\nsometimes I lose myself in the process\nand I'm very scared of that and I forget\nlike what is the real me anymore\nsometimes and it's difficult because I'm\nafraid of things like like like\nchildbirth and like being a father can I\nbe a father with Bipolar I don't know\nit's it's difficult and those things\nreally influence how I think a lot what\ndo you guys think what do you guys think\nthe real mo is I think most awesome\nperson these I know based on how genuine\nhe has been to me in this day few days\nI've known him we spoke a little bit\nyesterday and he's just a great person\nfrom like a few interactions a god what\nmakes him a great person what about\nthose interactions I have a sister with\nbipolar depression and he reminds me a\nlot of Harriet like my sister is like a\nwonderful and joyful caring person and I\nlove her very much so like Moe exhibits\na lot of those qualities so I just like\nI think he's great same year my brother\nlike my brother also has bipolar\ndisorder and he's also a be the same way\nin that way yeah and uh Moe my sister\nalso has kids it's possible to be a\nparent with bipolar like it's hard\nobviously but it's not possible I'm\ngonna cry\na lot thank you guys thank you what did\nthat mean to you mo that validation is\nreally nice that validation is super\nimportant and like I don't hear it\nenough I think the worst of myself and\nI'm far too hard on myself and I don't\nlike that I always think of the worst in\nthe negative situations and it's really\nnice to have that validation validation\nfeels to me like an understatement had\nwhat do you feel no give us another word\nfor it or a lot of words that are all\noff the mark needed I feel justified I\nfeel like I'm uh\nI feel right I feel accepted I feel like\nI'm in a place where I'm supposed to be\nwhen I hear those things I feel like I'm\ndoing something right and that's really\nit it's it's it's hard and like I've\nalways had love and appreciation from\nfrom other people and I do my best to\nspread that around as well and I mean I\ncall myself a great big hug because I\ntry to be a great big hug all the time\nand like it's sometimes you just need\nthat reflection and so it's nice because\nI want to believe that what I bring out\ninto the world is coming back to me I\nwant to feel like I'm doing something\nright and so when I get that validation\nit really feels like I'm doing good\nit means a lot of people give that\nvalidation when you had the child of\nchildhood is that a huge mo and everyone\nhere in this chat has ADD and I do I'm\nso who deals like this more this for you\nI think is what it's called and since I\ndidn't look the way I look now growing\nup and I get validation externally\nI don't believe - I don't see myself the\nway the world sees man you and I got\ncompliments growing up because of how\neven I did well at home with school I\ndidn't if you were like the rewards as I\nsaid but didn't weight negatives and now\nwhen I get compliments I can never\nreally like feel the joy of the\ncompliment the only time I really felt\nseen was when my mentor told me that he\nsees how much I care about people and if\nfor the first time I like that someone\nactually saw me for the person I was\nbecause growing up all I ever wanted to\nunderstand was why we hurt each\nso much why we can't spread love fully\nand why we can learn to love responsibly\nand why do we have to spend so much hate\nask you something what was it like to\nhear Moe's response to what y'all said\nit was beautiful\nyeah really wholesome what was well\nliked um I'm glad we could like give him\nlike that validation I guess a well you\nsaid it wasn't necessarily validation\nbut I'm glad like my experience is along\nwith everyone else's like could help\nsomeone like understand themselves are\nlike understand how people view them\nmore because I struggle with that like a\nlot and I've only recently started like\nunderstanding how people view me and I\nknow how great that feels so I'm glad we\ncould like help Moe like experience that\ncause it's great mm-hmm does anybody\nfeel a little bit confused or left out\nof this exchange um I wouldn't say I\nfeel confused but like I cuz I this is\nlike a normal thing for me but like I'm\njust very emotionally detached in\ngeneral so like a lot of things just\ndon't hit the same for me yeah and I\ndon't like see things the same way so\nthat's just like normal for me yeah what\ndo you think about that Aki um I was I\nwas actually just thinking like I feel\nlike I don't really I don't really feel\nlike a lot of the emotions that I think\nare probably there on the inside but\nlike I feel like listening to all of you\nguys I feel like I'm it's almost like\ngetting a mirror that lets me get an\nidea of how I probably actually do feel\nabout things because everything you're\nsaying like on some level it feels like\nit relates and it makes sense and I'm\njust like okay these are just things I\ncan't see for myself for whatever reason\nbut when you guys say it it all makes\nsense and I'm like okay now it all ties\ntogether\nthis is what party XP looks like by the\nway right so I I think this is why I\nthink yeah I mean you know I think\nindividual work is really important but\nI think that I can imagine that if I was\nspeaking to anyone of you one-on-one we\nwould have gone down a particular rabbit\nhole and and you know hopefully it would\nhave been helpful but I think that there\nis something that you guys can give each\nother that I can't give you right\nthere's something about you know I can\ntry to be a mirror but I don't really\nknow and to a certain degree I kind of\nknow but like you know I don't really\nknow what it's like to grow up black\nminority sure toxic masculinity sure a\nculture that sort of has very strict\ngender rules and ideas about what men\nshould be sure you know but I think\nthat's you know part of that it really\nis just humanity because it's not like\ntoxic masculinity in a particular\nculture it's like masculinity as whole\nyou sometimes be toxic anything that you\nguys want to kind of explore further I\nmean we've been at it for a little over\nan hour anybody have questions for each\nother for me or has anybody has anybody\nbeen told you're a smut guy you're just\nlazy\nalmost it's not your fault you're a\nsmart guy you're just lazy all the time\nI push it a lot if it's true like but\nthen like I'll notice like my\naccomplishments and I'll be like yeah\nlike I'm kind of smart and sometimes you\nknow I always do it it feels like a\nburden of expectation yeah and it feels\nlike it feels like I like you know I'm\nnot on my true potential just because\nI'm lazy or I'm not on my trip potential\nbecause these things are holding me back\nbut that's never the case and that's why\nI always think it's just such a [ __ ]\nwhen I very hear that I heard that's so\noften growing up I hate it and it still\npisses me off when I hear that and he\nleaves this feeling there's always\nsomething you should be doing and makes\nwhat you do like what you're doing right\nnow even it's relaxing you can make you\nfeel like it's never enough and that\nsense of you're a smart guy you're just\nlazy\nit proved it's a pervasive and insidious\nkiller in the sense that it makes even\nwhen you actually do work hard on\nsomething you doubt if your full effort\nwas really even put to it and when you\ntalk about procrastination as being the\nsmart thing to do dr. K it made me\nrecognize that that's why broke my\nchildhood it became more and more the\nthing where I've grasped me more and\nmore and more and more as years gone\nwould go by because I'd find that my\nemotion most my emotional state would be\nbetter the mark ratain ated\nsimultaneously as the work ethic Liz\nthat yeah I would get a good grade on\nsomething I do and study on this because\nin nature they actually pay attention in\nclass but that would leave a bad habit\nto grow where I don't study or don't do\nthough premeditative work that needs to\nbe done because the fact that what those\nmean you're smart you're just lazy yeah\nI think I think smart but lazy is the\nmost damning diagnosis someone can get\nbecause it leaves this idea that it's\nyou have it within you to do it but\nyou're just [ __ ] dumb so you're not\ndoing it I mean my take on smart but\nlazy and and I don't know if this is\ngonna make sense it's just kind of an\nimage popped into my mind it's sort of\nlike if you guys played like or we yeah\nthere's like it's like kind of like you\nguys are living life and everyone's\ntelling you to use the buttons on the\ncontroller but what you've really got is\na wiimote and you have an entire input\naxis that like other people aren't\nwearer and sometimes you use the Wiimote\nthe way it's supposed to be used and\neveryone\ntelling you to just hit the buttons but\nwhen you Excel it's like because you're\nmoving the Wiimote around and there are\njust parts of you that you guys have not\nfound yet and and so what happens is\npeople see that you can absolutely\nperform at a very high level and the\nproblem is not that you guys are dumb\nthe problem is that you're not able to\naccess that which you have been able to\ndo before and and so it's it's not\nreally like it's not that y'all are bad\nor dumb or lazy or anything like that\nit's just there's something about the\nway that you work that y'all don't\nunderstand yet definitely and I would I\nwould be really careful about you know\nso I also kind of sympathize with Aki\nand sort of the idea of like I'm gonna\nprove myself and then dot-dot-dot\nright like I want you guys to be really\ncareful about the and then like Moe's\nlike I'm gonna get my mental health in\norder and then maybe I'll have kids like\nbe really careful about this idea that\nyou're gonna be ready to take the next\nstep before you take the next step you\nwant to be confident in taking the next\nstep before you take it but I want y'all\nto really tunnel down and like pay\nattention to what Raymond said and and\nalso what Eli is kind of mentioned is\nthat like he sort of takes the next step\nbefore he's ready\nlike he just opens up the word document\nthere's no mater readiness you know you\nlive life in a way that you're not ready\nto take the next step you just take it\nthe other last thing that I want to tell\nyou guys I don't know if you'll know\nthis but you guys are really really good\nat being thrust into situations that\nyou're poorly prepared for ie being life\nbeing born in life as a black person\nwhich no one prepared you for right no\nlike we don't get prepared for the life\nthat we get thrust into and like it's\nnot just being born a black person it's\njust like being born now like we guys\nwere born you know it like with post\nboomer generation and it's like this is\nwhat you all have been thrust into a\nworld where like mental health is like\nclimbing at a crazy rate so when I\nstarted working with video game a\naddict's it's not really a great term\nbut can you you guys know what the\npercentage of people who are addicted to\nvideo games was so I started working\nwith backpack with in 2016\nworldwide what percentage of people do\nyou guys think we're addicted to video\ngames in 2016 like 5% simple said see\nlook at that you got tonight at this\nwhat a guy store percentage is four\nyears later 20 is still 5% it's actually\nlike 9% so I'll take the first one but\nthere are so interestingly enough Moe in\nIran the addiction rate is close to 20%\nno idea why yeah so like things are\ngetting worse\nin a in a shocking rate but I think I\nyou know it's cool like I I think how\ncan I say this so first of all any\nquestions anyone else want anything else\nand that was a great question by the way\nMoe just about you know being told\nyou're smart lazy cuz it's absolutely\nsomething that and that's not I mean\nthat has nothing to do with you guys\nbeing black and has to do with us being\non Twitch\nit's like what we get told yeah totally\nI I did have a question like related to\nthe identity thing so like a lot of what\nyou guys are saying is like you can't\nyou feel like you can't be yourself and\nit's interesting to me because all of\nthe stuff that you're kind of being told\nthat you have to be I feel like I just\ninternalized all those things and like\nthat is what I consider myself like\npeople say I'm supposed to be smart so\nI'm like I already have the smart guy\npeople say I'm supposed to be masculine\nall right then I'm gonna be the stoic\nguy so like I don't even know how to\ndraw the line between people's\nexpectations of identity and what my\nidentity actually is I that makes me\nthink of what dr. K talked about enology\nhe used for was like for a trans person\nto be trans and he said what you can do\nis go into the bathroom and we're all\nmale clothes and well not female clothes\nwell wear women's clothes red dress were\nabroad\nsee how you that makes you feel you feel\nuncomfortable that's our trans person\nfeels they look in the mirror every\nsingle day I think of when people gave\nme those compliments he told me those\nthings about myself I felt really\nuncomfortable because I just didn't feel\nlike that's who I was because the\nreality that I was living didn't feel\nlike we resemble the things I was being\ntold and well people perceived me and\nI'm not even I'm someone who like has\nreally balanced energy between masculine\nand feminine validity and I find that my\nexperience has been that the more\nmasculine as people made me feel that I\nhad to be the more uncomfortable I was\nespecially more I tried to force myself\nto be that person especially any dating\nis like the feeling that you have to be\nhyper masculine to get women to be into\nyou it was a big struggle for a very\nlong time and so I became 17 I was\nreally having a proper dialogue ruin my\nlife and you don't understand that the\nbest thing I can do for myself would be\na better version of myself what do you\nguys think about you know I came talking\nabout like how do you know where you\nexist when when you sort of form your\nopinions about yourself based on\nexpectations like you become the\nexpectation that's what you think you\nare is that something that you guys have\nexperienced more or struggled with I\nhave liked a lot recently um like before\nlike like like within the past year have\nbeen like kind of working on it and\ntrying to figure out like what kind of\nis my place in the world Who I am like\nwhat my dynamic is and like a friend\ngroup and everything and it was fine\nuntil like I think my therapist\nbasically told me don't worry about that\nlike if the people around you didn't\nwant to be around to you like you don't\ndon't worry about like if they didn't\nwant to be around like they just\nwouldn't so you don't have to worry\nabout like how you fit in where your\nplace is you can just find it because no\none really knows like how exactly like\nother people perceive them and what they\nliked you know and I was [ __ ] like my\nreally close friend Spencer and we were\ntalking about like the idea of like who\nwe are in identity he was like kind of\nexplain to each other like uh who we\nthink each other are but when\ndid we both realize like we just have\nvastly different ideas of who we think\nthe other person is so like we no one\nreally knows kind of just a guessing\ngame\ndoes anybody have a sense so it sounds\nlike Eli's done a lot of kind of\nexploration and sort of discovering\nKorea's I'm curious does anybody else\nhave a sense of like do you guys feel\nlike you know who you are\nI feel I feel pretty confident in my\nself-image sometimes but it's difficult\nwhen it doesn't mesh well with other\npeople's sense of who I am as a person I\nfeel like I conflict a lot with others\nwhen someone sees me coming from a\ntraditional African family then but I'm\nnot so traditional myself then I feel\nlike that's where I struggle with a lot\nit's just how did you not have who you\nare\nmylord I'm through a lot through going\nto university through meeting and dating\nso many different people through\nexperiencing different traumatic events\nin my life through you know so many\ndifferent experiences that I think\nshaped myself including my bipolar\ndisorder like I I think someone asked me\na question recently where would you want\nmore or less pain in your childhood but\nI think without that pain I wouldn't\nhave been the same person that I am now\nso it's difficult it's it's I think I\nwould say I truly discovered myself at\nthe time I found my bipolar disorder\nthat's that's where I would kind of like\ntie it all in yeah so you know I hope\nthat\ntake away there isn't the road to\nfinding yourself is to get diagnosed\nwith bipolar disorder so I think I think\nI think the key thing there is that you\nknow so I think for people who are\ntrying to figure out who you are I think\nwe we can hear from kind of Eli and Mo\nis that like first of all and also\nRaymond too cuz I get the sense that\nhe's getting a real handle on it now is\nI hope you guys hear that these are\nincredibly individual journeys and like\nwhat the [ __ ] did you guys expect when\nit comes to finding out who your ID a\nunique identity is you think that\nthere's a standard formula for it like\nthe whole point is that it's individual\nright like it's your identity it's no\none else's identity so why is anyone\nelse's story like you can learn how to\nwrite poetry and talk to women you can\nget diagnosed with ADHD and and start to\nlike you know have a job and work in\nboardrooms or you can get diagnosed with\nbipolar disorder like those are all\nequally good answers and I think I came\nyou know the challenges that that\ndoesn't really give you a way forward\nbecause I get I guess on some level what\nI'm hearing between reading the lines\nbetween your question it's like how do I\nfind out who I am because you've noticed\nthat your sense of self is based it's\nbuilt upon the expectations of others\nbut that's not who you are right and\nthen you're like then how do I find who\nI am so maybe this is where I can teach\nyou guys a particular meditation\npractice and so we'll do that in a\nsecond but if it's okay with you guys\nI'd like to just try to summarize a\nlittle bit about what I heard today is\nthat okay so I just need a second which\nnow I wonder whether that's going to be\nlike an emo that is racist towards\nIndian people that's what I learned\ntoday thank you guys very much we'll see\nyou all next so let me just think about\nthis all right so like i'ma start with\nall right this may not make a whole lot\nof sense because I'm just looking at\nrandom things that I jotted down so I'm\ngonna start with it shouldn't be this\nway like that's where it starts right\nthat you guys were each thrust into life\nwith various amounts of debuffs and on\nhardmode and it just it just shouldn't\nbe this way that greed and and you know\nlike like that you guys were so I I\ndon't know that you guys were really\nallowed I mean it's almost like you guys\nyou know roll the stats of a fighter and\nyou were given like a wizard staff and a\nset of robes and then you were like when\ntold to live life and this is where like\nidentity and exercise right and and so\nit's kind of hard cuz you guys are like\nsitting there on like level one you're\nlike what the [ __ ] is the stick like you\nknow so this kind of goes back to the\nidea of like you know playing the game\nwith a wiimote instead of a regular\ncontroller and being called smarten but\nlazy because it's like everyone's you\nknow you're running around with the\nstick and you're you know me laying\npeople with it when the stick is\ndesigned to have spells and you're just\nyou're a different character like you\nwere born to use a sword and and so I I\nthink that there's a lot of there's a\nlot of like expectation that was thrust\nupon you guys everything from religious\nexpectations around what mental health\nis to really kind of invalidating and I\ndon't really like that word but like\nreally just you guys being not allowed\nto be the person that you are and what\nI'm hearing from many of you guys is\nthat you guys had to fight for each inch\nof ground like I'm thinking like I'm\nimagining y'all's lives as like World\nWar two trench warfare where it's like\nevery foot that you gain is like gain\nwith like blood and sweat yes you know\nand and it sounds like Eli's mom is\nsuper supportive but it doesn't sound\nlike she started that way you know that\nwas like like you guys have to carve out\nyour space in the world and whether\nthat's holding back the way that you\ntalk around your peers because they\nliterally wouldn't understand you or\ntrying to tell your dad like what you\nwant to do in life and like he tells you\nthat you'd become a waste of everything\nthat all of his sweat and toil if you\nchoose to be the person that you are\nwhat the [ __ ] man all right\nor for for people in your life who have\nbeen very very lazy in terms of their\ninvalidation of you the lazy ones just\ncalled you smart but lazy right they\ndidn't even bathe in eve it like take\nthe time of data to invalidate you as a\nperson and a very specific in thoughtful\nway hitter just like you're so [ __ ]\nlazy why can't you just be better just\nbe better in life\nAkeem would stop just sucking just be\nbetter bro right and so then I kind of\nget to this like you know I think we\nkind of get into this idea of like\nbuilding your identity and the\nexpectations that people put on you\nwhether it's playing a game and like not\nbeing able to use voice chat or you know\nI've been having this question by mine\nlike I don't even know can pee I mean I\nassume people can tell that you're black\nbased on your voice over voice chat yes\nyour cadence is about the cadence of\nluigi last week and that's part of a\ncaricature as well and you already\nunderstood like if you understand that\nmen when you bring the caricature has\nbeen perpetuated for such a long time\nthey will immediately sign the cadence\nin which you speak from that caricature\nto you yeah so I like you know it comes\nback to the sense of like you know be\nlike not being able to be yourself in\nthe world which you know starts with\nyour parents and even like even like\nmanifests in the gaming community and so\nthen I get the sense of you know I think\nwe see a couple of things that come up\nthe first is exhaustion that you guys\njust have to do [ __ ] that like other\npeople don't have to do or maybe other\npeople do have to do it maybe that's\nunfair to other people but I'm just\ngetting a layer of additional effort\nlike let's forget about other people but\nthat you have to do right that like I\nyou know when I log on to discord I\nreally don't think about you know what\nhow I sound and I don't have to spend\ntime thinking about that\nand you know when I the only time I\nspend thinking about is when I'm having\nfun like when I saw top I'm talking like\ntakes and you know we can do that and\nwho the so you can you can play a game\nof doubters for long new agents y'all\nplay legal agents leaders great ending\nand so like that's been my experience of\nmy voice and it's been an overwhelmingly\npositive thing and so I'm hearing you\nguys just really so there's like this\nidea of like who you are and who the\nworld wants you to be and and walking\nthat tightrope is just exhausting mm-hmm\nand and at the worst it's like painful\nand and really like I I'm really glad\nthat Moe took the time to dig in and and\nthink about what validating means\nbecause it's not validating it's like he\nused the word justified yeah what\njustified what justified his [ __ ]\nexistence is a person and who he is and\nnot to be labeled or like you guys were\nlike yeah man you deserve to like be on\nthis earth and we're okay with the\nperson that you are that's what that was\nit's not validation that's justification\nof existence which what I hear from you\nguys is not something that you'll get on\na daily basis and and this also I think\ndoes race have a piece of why you're\nabsolutely I think you guys really you\nknow drew the short end of the steak in\nthe world that we live in today and at\nthe same time I think that's also\nsomething that is not unique to black\npeople right I mean I think that smart\nbut lazy people who don't deserve to be\nalive is like pretty much describes our\ncommunity and that's who we are\nand and that's tough it's like it's\n[ __ ] exhausting and so then I think\nnow we get into the part that I think is\nreally really tricky which is like you\nknow this idea that you're a lazy lazy\npiece of [ __ ] and that you have to prove\nit and I'd be careful because there's a\npart of me that really like that rubs me\nthe wrong way when you guys try to like\nprove it or unquote I don't even know\nwhat I mean by that but that's what I\nfeel because I think what you're trying\nto prove is not the person that you are\nbut the person that people want you to\nbe want you to be mm-hmm and I think you\nguys got to be really careful about\nthat right if it's the person that you\nwant to be fine but if it's if it's like\nproving to yourself that you can be that\nwhich people expect you to be you got to\nbe careful and I'm basically talking\nmostly to pequin here but also all of\nyou guys felt like you know that's who\nI'm kind of thinking about I think his\nstatements really made me kind of think\nabout that I think we all face that too\nand so then the question becomes how do\nyou figure out like who you are and it's\nabsolutely an individual journey and I\nthink the main thing that I'm hearing is\nthat the main different the main common\nthread between and I'm just gonna kind\nof reference Eli Raymond and Moe because\nI think that's where I heard heard it is\nthey paid attention to their experiences\nand they paid attention to their\nexperiences with their own eyes and with\ntheir own ears and their with their own\nfeelings instead of interpreting their\nexperiences through the lens of stigma\nsociety and expectation and it's I hear\nthe [ __ ] in it it still boggles my mind\nevery time I hear it but like get\ngetting diagnosed as mentally ill is\nlike a positive thing but Raymond felt\nit was liberating and like you know Moe\ngetting like this diagnosis felt like he\nstarted the process of understanding who\nhe is which doesn't mean that mental\nillness is like a good thing I just it's\nweird and I don't really know how to\nmake sense of it but I do think I mean\nI've talked to when I used to do consult\npsychiatry so this is like a\npsychiatrist who works in a hospital\nlike in a medical hospital and I like\nworked on the oncology floor and people\nwould say this weird [ __ ] like cancer is\nthe best thing that ever happened to me\nI'm like dude what are you seeing like\nhow can that possibly be and I think\nlike you know in a game or analogy\nthere's like there's XP to be gained\nthere right and it's really about\nlearning and paying attention and like\nthinking through your own journey and\nand then at the end of the day I think\nthough that that identity and now we\ncome to our meditation exercise identity\ncan be found I do believe that that\nthere's an individual journey but there\nare also some practices that you can get\na sense of like who your truest form of\nidentity is because the the people in\nthe East sort of had this clear idea\nthat like our identity is something very\npure the\nthe word divine and and that at the core\nof our being like if you slough off all\nof the expectations in all of the\n[ __ ] what you see is what people saw\nin MO and what mo felt which is\nsomething like pure and beautiful and\ndivine and it doesn't matter what the\ncolor of your skin is it doesn't matter\nwhat diagnosis you have it doesn't\nmatter what you wear it doesn't matter\nhow you sound but there's just something\nincredibly like pure and perfect\nunderneath all of it I believe that and\nso then the question becomes how do we\nfind that well now I'm going to teach\nyou guys a particular meditation\ntechnique okay so this is taught before\nbut I think you know I'm I sometimes we\nteach things so I don't know if you guys\nhave encountered this but I want you all\nto sit up straight I want you to close\nyour eyes so I'd also encourage you guys\nto adopt Pyatt of a mudra which is this\nso right hand and left you can put your\nthumbs together and then go ahead and\nput it in your lap so your arms are kind\nof like a loose circle and then close\nyour eyes and just feel the person that\nyou are for a second just notice\nyourself right so notice your body maybe\na particular facial expression maybe a\ncrinkling of the eyebrows a slight smile\nmaybe a little bit more of a bigger\nsmile\njust notice who you are and this is\ngonna sound kind of weird but like where\ndo you feel yourself you know where is\nthat Yunis like where do you exist maybe\nkind of a weird question it doesn't make\nsense not a big deal if it does you may\nalso notice your thoughts so take a\nmoment to notice that weird-ass thing\nthat we call the mind you saw the random\nthoughts that it generates and sometimes\nhow you feel like those thoughts become\ntruth and that the thoughts can be\ndevastating and at a time those thoughts\nbecome you or you become thoughts you\nmerge with them I'm a bad person I'm a\nstupid person you know there I'm a waste\nof space I'm a lazy piece of [ __ ] and\nnow I want you guys to look for a second\nwhat D can you find the lazy piece of\n[ __ ] within you but in this moment can\nyou find the part of yourself that is a\nlazy piece of [ __ ]\nlook for it where is it what is it what\ndoes it look like what does it feel like\ncan anybody find it I'm gonna ask you\nguys to speak okay so so it sounds like\nEli can some people can't I can what\nabout you maybe a little maybe a little\nit'll take it right so Eli can you tell\nus what the lazy piece of [ __ ] feels\nlike to you the first thing that came to\nmind the first thing that came to mind\nwas the child so I have this thing in my\nhead constantly since I've been the kid\nwas I feel like the kid that I was the\nonly thing that I really need was a hug\nand in my mind the person that came to\nmind was the kid that was scared of the\nworld and I was crying and I think that\nis that part of myself okay great thanks\nfor sure so now what I want you guys to\ndo is keep go back to eyes closed so\nfeel that circuit between your arms and\nkind of the linking notice your breath\nand I want you to notice the inhalation\nand the exhalation preferably through\nthe nose\nbut exhalation through the mouth is okay\nif you really feel like it and now\nwithout holding your breath I want you\nto zero in on the moment where\ninhalation becomes exhalation\nnotice that there's a discreet\ninhalation in a discreet exhalation and\nthen there's something in-between I'm\ngonna give you guys a few seconds to\njust breathe and notice and now as you\nfind that space between inhalation and\nexhalation put yourself fully into it\nand then in that space try to notice who\nyou are who exists in the space between\ninhalation and exhalation we'll practice\nfor about 30 seconds 60 let's give it a\nminute\nnow let your awareness slowly return to\nJanuary 8th 2020 let your name return to\nyou let your location return to you\nyou're ready slowly open your eyes would\nanyone like to share some reflections or\ntheir experience of the practice yeah I\nfelt really chill I guess the point\nwhere you were asked in the moment\nbetween the inhale and exhale it was\nlike a parabola and it was at like a\nrange between sometimes it was closer to\nthe in hill sometimes quistis about um\nexhale and also when you um asked me who\nwas that person at that moment in time\nit was just a guy breathing it wasn't\nmyself it wasn't Raymond it wasn't space\nand it wasn't was just a guy breathing\nthus I saw it forward liked it thanks\nthat's okay people sort of had a similar\nexperience different experience having\num I was meditating recently especially\nI've been after I started feeling better\nway before all the black lives matter\nprotests have been gone recently I have\nthis is this associated feeling from the\nmadness of the world being able to\nrecognize that my being above and\noutside of that and I feel that again\nvery strongly right now especially after\nthis entire stream I didn't recognize\nhow much better I would feel after\ntalking about all these things and I\nguess getting them out of my head\nwithout realizing how much of a problem\nfor me well such a long time and I feel\na lot peace in this moment I I feel\nanxiety and that in between in that\nmoment in between an inhale on an exhale\nI feel scared I feel I just I don't know\nit's I don't know if I like that\nin-between moment I like the inhaling of\nthe exhaling because it's there it's\nlike curry and it's like constant but I\nit's it's that pausing that moment\nbetween that scares me I think that's\ncompletely fair man it is it can be a\nvery scary place to be for some people\ndoesn't mean you're doing it wrong\ndoesn't necessarily mean you need to\ncontinue doing that practice but thanks\nfor sharing hard to explain like like\nthe shift like like a transmission oh\nyeah yeah go for it you we can hear you\nnow maybe you speak up up eat it again\nit's kind of party maybe bring the phone\ncloser to you yeah I can I could pick it\nout is that better yeah okay all right\nso for me I kind of saw like the shift\nlike and like shifting gears and unlike\nthe breath like returning and exhaling\nand it just like it I was able to like\njust reflect on myself a lot and how I\nview myself which it was a really\npositive experience because I think I've\ngotten a lot better like a more happy\nperson I feel better about myself\nand so is kind of just helping like\nreinforce that fact and I really enjoyed\nit so thank you\na keen you don't have to speak but you\nknow you're it's kind of weird I mean I\ndon't want you to feel pressure to speak\nif you don't do I guess at that moment\nof like between inhale and exhale and\nlike you asking what do you feel about\nyourself or like who do you feel you are\nat that moment and I guess the only\nimage that came to my mind was just like\na very I don't know just I guess I just\nfelt like very grand and like powerful\nand I don't know if that's like I mean\nthat's kind of the thing that I always\nwonder about in terms of identity like\nI'd persistently have that perception of\nmyself but then I also feel like that is\nalso comes a lot from what people have\ngenerally always expected from me so I'm\nalways like is that actually how I feel\nabout myself or is that just like me\ntrying to fit a role so I just always go\nback into that question in my mind but I\ndon't know yeah so I Kenai I think you\nhave a lot of teasing apart to do right\nso the way that I would interpret what\nyou said and we can go through and kind\nof interpret everyone's different\nresponses but let's start with you and\ngo in reverse order so your case I think\nthat you've always had a sense of for\nlack of better terms your divinity the\nproblem is that your the expectations\nthat people place upon you in the\nexpectations that you place upon\nyourself turn that pure divinity into\ngrandmas they hijack it like because\nhere's the thing is they've expected\ngreat things from you and you felt\ngreatness within you and so you've just\nlumped those two things together where\nthey actually need to be completely\nseparate and it's it's gonna be a hard\nroad but like it really involves teasing\napart that which you feel about yourself\nfrom that which you expect yourself to\nbe but I'd encourage you to keep doing\nit I think before that was Julian yeah\nand Julian you had said what me good\nyeah so it was just like um it was a\nmoment for me to like be like very\ninsightful about like how I view myself\nand um re-emphasize like how do I say\nthis kind of cosign those like in my own\nmind like so I thought like generally\nlike nice things about myself and like\nwhat I know from like what people have\ntold me and everything um and I was\nkinda just like reaffirming those\nfeelings just while I was just thinking\nand just trying to like I could feel\nlike just happier and I could feel like\nthat like more complete yeah good so I\nthink just let yourself continue to like\ndrink the water from that well right and\nand like as people have other\nexpectations and you have thoughts about\nyourself and like whether it's positive\nor negative just like don't let go that\nsource you know and let it just continue\nto fir like you know water your fields\nand like whatever other nature analogy\nyou want mow in your case I think it's\ncompletely fine for you to feel anxious\nso sometimes raw experiences of self can\nbe incredibly anxiety provoking and\nuntethering I'm not sure that you had a\nraw experience of self but that\nabsolutely happens so I think in your\ncase you may just want to have a\npractice that really anchors you to the\npresent and anchors like is like so this\nis a more abstract or untethering\npractice it's actually designed to like\ntech like and remove yourself from all\nof the things that you think you are and\njust find kind of a pure part of you and\nI think the interesting thing mo is that\nI think a lot of your growth has been in\nfinding anchors with your life and I\ndon't think that you're ready to let go\nthose yet which I don't think you should\nbecause they're good anchors for you so\nif you need to stick with the inhalation\nand exhalation by all means stick with\ninhalation exhalation keep going keep\nwalking the road that you're on because\nit feels to me like it's on you know the\nright direction you can absolutely have\nkids one day you know it's like I mean I\nknow a lot of people who have bipolar\ndisorder and have children some of their\nkids struggle too but like they're\nthey're happy stories like I'm thinking\nabout one person in particular who kid\nhad a lot of problems they had a lot of\nproblems they're both doing fantastic\nnow and now they have grandkids we're\ndoing great that's beautiful thank you\ndoctor it's like it absolutely happens\nman\nyou know Eli I think I think it's\namazing that you've done I you know when\nI heard you kind of talk about that\nchild within yourself i think it's clear\nto me that you've done a lot of growth\nand you've done a lot of exploration and\nthat you can sort of feel the some scar\nfor a lack of a better term of like you\nknow the piece of [ __ ] within you and\nand to recognize that like that piece of\n[ __ ] is not who you are but is a piece\nof you that needs you to take care of it\nand i think it's sort of a line with\nwhat you're saying earlier about like\nteaching yourself to be like the father\nthat you needed interestingly enough my\nmy teacher taught me a very specific\npractice to do that which was sort of\nlike the cert my teacher gave me this\npractice for the search for inner guru\nso to like find a teacher within you so\nthat you need no external teachers so i\nthink you should just do whatever\nwhatever [ __ ] you're doing and you've\nbeen doing just keep at it bro so I\nthink in sounds like it's a it's a good\njourney and then Raymond I think you\nknow when I teach this practice and be\ncareful because this is gonna be loaded\nwhat I hope what I imagine people will\nexperience or what I hope people would\nexperience is actually the closest to\nwhat you described like this sense of\nthe parabola and the up and down doesn't\nmean that it's right that's not the\npoint of meditation but I all of the\npeople in this group I would encourage\nyou to continue doing this practice the\nmost because I think that just something\nabout the way that you described it is\nyeah maybe I mean you got all y'all can\ndo it everyone except for Moe but you\nknow III think that in terms of just the\nway that you described it I think it's\nthe closest description to what I think\nyou will gain more from and it's not to\nsay that other people can't do it or\nwon't gain a lot and you definitely\ndon't want to make a decision after like\nyou know three minutes of a meditation\npractice right so but but I think just\nthe way that you lost yourself in the\nparabola is something that let me put it\nthis way other people who I have taught\nthis practice who have described\nsomething similar have gone on to gain a\nlot from it that's the way I should\ndescribe it says nothing about the rest\nof you guys it just means yet I've heard\nother people describe that and then\nthey've they've gotten a lot out of\ncontinued practice\nso overall guys thank you so much for\ncoming on and and you know sharing\ny'all's perspectives I it's it's been\namazing to hear your story and also like\nsad to be honest to hear what you guys\nhave had to deal with and yeah just\ntired\ntiring more than anything else and I'm\nglad that you all are part of the\ncommunity in like I think it's been\namazing to listen to you guys and I'm\ngrateful that you all have decided to\ncome on here today and try to share a\nlittle bit about yourselves and help\nhelp us out\nthank you that's okay as well\nwhat's for having us thank you so much\nrather than you really appreciate it and\ngood luck to you as well but I'm gonna\nkeep thank you\nokay alright so that was fun helpful I\nhope that was helpful to you guys as\nwell yeah man it's tough dude it's tough\nlife ain't easy it's hard game hard game\nto play\nreally hard for some people\nyeah I think it's been tough but you\nknow those guys are strong and I I felt\nyeah\nI just have to process for a second\nit surprises me how\nit surprises me like how individual art\njourneys can be and how common our\nproblems and struggles are like we can\nall share the same challenges and\nthere's a lot to be gained from each\nother and at the same time it's so\ninteresting to see like how you know\ndifferent people's growth and progress\nis so wildly you know how it's supposed\nto blur and that everyone's journey is\nso unique and I think it's really cool\nwhen like you know I guess I'm just sort\nof envisioning a couple years ago I went\nto climb Mount Kilimanjaro and it was\ncool because like you know you you meet\ncertain people and then you hike with\nthem for a while and you're on the same\nRoad side by side for like two days and\nthen you know they decide to leave early\nthe next morning and then you're kind of\nlike by yourself again and both of you\nguys are on your own journey and you can\nreally share it and resonate with\nsomeone and really be with someone for\nsome time and then you have to go off on\nyour own path and and just hearing those\nguys that's kind of what I felt like it\njust reminded me of Kilimanjaro and like\nthat each of these people are walking\ntheir own path but like sometimes you\nknow the steps look really similar and I\nhope that you guys learned something or\ngained something from hearing about\ntheir path and maybe you can you know\nwalk yours a little bit better or even\njust keep walking\nafter hearing theirs and it's it's cool\nI'm glad that you know they came on and\nI'm glad that you guys show up to listen\nand\nyeah"
