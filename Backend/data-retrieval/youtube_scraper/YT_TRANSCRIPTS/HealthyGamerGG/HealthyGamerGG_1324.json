    "transcript": "and so what's your name friend William\nWilliam welcome we're thank you I\nunderstand where you you had asked a\nquestion on our AMA stream is that right\nyeah and what was your question well I\nhave a lot of different questions though\nbut one of the ones are the one you have\nin the title so can someone actually be\nfully healed okay and I what did I say\nback then I don't remember I was drunk\noh I did I didn't ask that question I\nasked yeah I asked about more it's kind\nof the same its it like I thought I had\ngotten better it's a little bit what you\ntalked in a reckful stream where you\nknow where you think you get better but\nafter a while it hits you again\nbasically and and that's where I am at\nbasically yeah I thought I'd dealt with\nby things but it turned back again and\nstuff like that\nokay so so when you when you say it\nturns back or like so it sounds like you\nmade progress and then you start to slip\nback yeah I thought it I thought I was\ndone with it like completely okay what's\nmy check psychologist also thought um\nbut but then like after two months it\ncame back again\nand it wasn't so clear because um so\nwhat I could do before was I could\nactually listen to my emotion like why\nam I feeling oh okay I'm getting these\nkind of flashbacks was things like that\nbut this time it was more like a\nconstant noise or noise constant feeling\nhow I felt that dragged me down and I\ncouldn't really listen to a specific\nthing if it makes any sense like it was\nlasting for long periods let's just take\na step back volume so first I want to\nask you for a definition so when you say\ncan someone be fully healed right what\nso let's start with your perception when\nyou're asking that question what do you\nthink fully healed looks like\num it to me it is more like you can take\nit really without it affecting you okay\nand and we'll get to what it is in a\nsecond okay without it affecting you\nokay\nyeah maybe that's it okay I don't know\nwhat else\nokay yeah so then tell me can you tell\nme a little bit about what you've\nstruggled with and then you know tell us\nwhat you struggled with what got better\nand then okay how you slipped back okay\num so I have yeah a very narcissistic\nparent so can you tell us what well\nmeans um I mean there's a lot to tell\nbut she it was just the world was\nevolving just around her basically she\ntreated all only for her own benefits um\nI mean\nso I mean the reason why she even got us\nkids born was to for her to be able to\nstay in the country as well she didn't\nwon't really want to raise kids um help\nme help me understand how you know that\noh she well she directly said it to me\nwhen I confronted because I've always\nyeah there's been a lot of questions\nI've always tried to fit the puzzle\npieces together with all the information\nI got him from you know my grin line\nfrom how the pieces look like um well\nthere's so much to say but I wondered\nhow a person can behave like they can\nlike how can a person be or how did that\nperson become who that person is like\nhow is it possible so for instance my\ngrandma took care of me when I was\nyounger um the case yeah because my mom\nwasn't there and my grandma was really\nreally nice person\nso I didn't understand really why my mom\nturned out the way she turned out to be\nso like we don't really make sense for\nme if it's okay with you here's what I'm\nenvisioning I'm envisioning that there\nare people in our audience right now who\nmay have a narcissistic parent and don't\nrealize that that parent is narcissistic\nokay so what I'd love for you to do if\nyou feel comfortable with it is yeah is\nto tell us like give us an example of\nsomething that your mom did or a couple\nof the puzzle pieces when you were\nasking how did she end up this way like\nwhat did you see that made you start to\nask her did you ever want kids right\nbecause that like well yeah so I mean\never since I was born or as far as I\nremember she told me that she hated me\nand that I just take space in the world\nand that I'm a total useless piece of\n[ __ ] and she always put me into really\nhigh demands like told me really high\nthings or okay yeah like she minified me\nextremely much like I wouldn't past like\nmiddle school and when I passed middle\nschool she told me I wouldn't pass high\nschool and one\nI passed high school she would tell me\nyou know nothing really pleased her and\nshe would just yeah minify me always\nlike by these tasks like and I don't\nknow there's so much like I could never\nwalk beside her\nI was actually always walking behind her\nwhen we were out walking in town of\nthings like that\nshe had posters of herself and she in\nthe house which I actually yeah I didn't\nthink that much until my friends pointed\nit out but also she always claimed like\nthe biggest groom I'm being very\nanalytical here because I'm a very\nanalytical person I said she oh yeah she\nalways claimed the biggest room when\nwhen I compared to my friends and when I\nwas over at their places and stuff like\nthat they would sacrifice it for their\nkids so they would take the smallest\nroom and give the biggest room to their\nparents to their kids but my mom which\nwas like basically never at home took\nthe biggest her room she when we wanted\nthings or things like that if it did not\ngive her for any benefit if it was just\nyeah what's a computer or a computer\ngame she would not really spend money\nfor that but if it if it was more for\nher own benefit and status she would\nhelp out like you know maybe getting\ninto better school or stuff like that\nshe would step up and do it so she could\nbrag more with her friends about how\namazing her kids were so for instance\nwhen when I met her friends and they\nasked asked me like oh who is this\nlittle guy\nit's very seldom that I even could\npresent myself it would usually be my\nmom speaking for me and it would be so\nlittle so it could be oh yeah that's my\nyoungest son he's eight years old or so\nand then then she just goes immediately\nto my brother which you know he's an A\nstudent\nhe's actually a doctor as well my\ncondolences but yeah so it was always\ndrifting towards that immediately like\neven when people asked me she would just\nconvert it directly to my brother and me\nlike oh but my his brother is a doctor\nblah blah blah and his dude and you know\nhe's awesome ba ba ba and stuff like\nthat so what is there as a narcissistic\nparent I don't know yeah that's that's\ngreat guys come on thank you so much\nyeah it's not great it's terrible what\nyou had to do yeah that's exact\nyou know when you say those kinds of\nthings I think it helps people\nunderstand like that terminology and I\nthink it's good that it sounds like\nyou've been working with psychologists\nso it's clear to me that your analytical\nyou know what you're talking about\nyou're pretty familiar with this stuff\nthere's something else I could add on it\nas well that might be clarifies it is\nthey I don't know if it was like I guess\nit's a little bit connected with like\nsociopaths as well like they're very\ngood at playing with people's emotion\njust for their own benefit and what do\nyou mean by mant mmm so my mother played\na lot of the victim card she was like oh\nI'm yeah I don't know how much\ngo into details but basically she was\nlike oh yeah it's poor me I'm single mom\nraising YouTube kids but literally it\nwas her choice doing it and she's done a\nlot of really really crazy things behind\nthe scenes I'm probably not gonna go\nokay shouldn't sit here I think yeah\nyeah okay but yeah yeah I'm glad you\nfeel comfortable sort of saying yeah I'm\nnot gonna I don't feel comfortable\ntalking about that that's very important\nI I am quite comfortable talking with it\nI just yeah I think it doesn't fit so\nmuch I don't know like hmm it's a little\nbit more yeah I'll just stop myself\nthere I think it's true yeah so we'll\njust one one point about that I want you\nto feel very comfortable not talking\nabout something that you don't want to\ntalk about yeah\nbut generally speaking if your thought\nis that it's not relevant then I would\nquestion that because I think oh the\nwhole point of these conversations is\nthat when people give me raw data\ninstead of their analysis I tend to be\nable to help them more because if I get\nyour analysis I'm dealing with your\nbiases and I can't form my own lecture\nso I'm not trying to pressure you into\nsaying it I want to be very clear about\nthat but and we don't have to talk about\nnow I point to cell I can talk about why\nI'm restricting myself a little bit let\nme just sure change battery on my\nheadset just one second here okay can I\nhear yeah I\nI think okay it's because of the well\nwork-related I have probation and I'm\nthat's why I'm thinking okay a little\nbit let's just steer clear let's not\neven take a chance can you tell me about\nyour older brother you have one sibling\nyeah just one sibling yeah can you tell\nme about him uh well he's a doctor okay\nfive years older than me okay probably\nthe kindest brother I could ever wish\nfor\nreally but yes but he I think he never\never really understood how I felt I\nthought he did at one point when he\ncalled me one time and said dude oh so\nwhat was happening was I moved out and\nwhat happened was my mom started\nprojecting it towards my brother which\nhas never ever happened before I was\nalways the one taking it yeah all the\nshits that she had to project or so\nwhich I guess cuz I'm smaller and it's\neasier and she portrayed in me as the\nbad person cuz I never lived up to her\ndemands and stuff like that but yeah so\nwhen I moved out he was calling me and\nhe was like [ __ ] dude I'm sorry I didn't\nknow he was this much like I've been\njust experiencing this for two three\ndays and I can't imagine you've been\nliving this through your entire life\nyeah how does it feel to say that well\nwhat are you feeling right now um I felt\nthat he understood at that point what\neven now I don't know like as you say\nthose words yeah I can't steal it I can\nstill I can still feel how I felt back\nthen and well are not feeling tell us\nabout that\nOh\n[Music]\nwhy am I here\nwhat are you it's it's like what am I\ndoing here why am I here why am i\nexisting even like it yeah\nso let me know so when your brother\ncalled you and told you that I can't\nbelieve you've been doing this with this\nyour entire life I've just been doing it\nwith two or three days the way then you\nfelt was why am I here\nno no oh oh you mean at that point sorry\nsorry I thought you meant what the\nfeelings of of those feelings were sorry\nyeah what that feeling was I felt like\noh [ __ ] finally my brother and\nunderstands me\num because I don't know yeah you can\nstop me also at whenever you want um cuz\nI don't have her own stuff but first\ntime I mean I had suicidal thoughts\nalready when I was like around 8:00 and\nI was really really considering like hey\nyeah I don't know I shouldn't yeah I\nshould have been dead I guess when I was\nlike 12\nwell I mean the day after in debt when\nyou were well like yeah I tried to jump\noff a cliff but in the end I got\nflashbacks from my grandmother which is\nthe one and the main reason why I'm\nstill alive I guess but I somehow\nmanaged to lunch myself back to safety\nagain I was literally outside another\ncliff and I I talked to my brother the\nday after I was like yeah I was supposed\nto be dead yesterday and stuff like that\num What did he say\nso I don't remember\ntoo much cuz it's like because I talked\na lot with my brother about the past and\nstuff like that as well and and we both\nhave like kind of no memories of her\nchildhood like till were 15 or something\nlike that but from what I think and from\nall right I do believe and I remember is\nthat um yeah he was like oh oh [ __ ] cuz\nhe hasn't been really that good with\ntalking with emotions sure um and I\ndon't know how much he actually\nremembers cuz I told him like a year ago\nI was like did I'm feeling so bad I'm\nreally at a bad point and he was like oh\nit's just D vitamin so it's uh I don't\nknow if it's some doctor thing or if\nit's uh yeah I don't know but yeah so\ncan I ask you do you so can you tell us\na little bit about like pulling yourself\nback from the cliff why did you do that\nI got flashbacks from my grandmother\nthat she would be crying so much and it\nwould be very egoistic to do it um\nactually anybody was just a flashback of\nmy grandmother crying see and I managed\nto somehow launch myself back to safety\ndo you regret not jumping\nI don't know good answer\nI'm glad you didn't jump yeah but I\nthink it's okay to not know mm-hm right\nwhether you made the right choice there\nor not is your grandmother's still alive\nshe is\nwhat's your yeah how's she doing\nuh-huh pretty bad right now\num which has also been a very major\npoint on on how it's affected me how\nlong has she been pretty bad\nwell I\nthe reason why she couldn't take of care\nof me anymore when I was 8 years old\nonwards she was in an accident and after\nthat she just got bad all the way was\nbetter than me\nmmm he'd never she she had problem\nwalking and stuff like that and it just\ngot worse and worse and yeah and I I got\nafter a while when I kept like I kept\nvisiting her right and she got yeah bad\nalso in the memory and thought wise so\nshe confused me with my brother even\nwith my uncle and stuff like that so I\nfelt like I wasn't really meeting my\ngrandma anymore like she was funny -\nyeah fade away how long has that been\ngoing on\ntwo years two years out when her oh the\naccident or her memory part of her\nmemory uh two years ish okay two to\nthree years and I I got so much guilt it\ntakes me it takes me a while to get\nthere even to visit her cuz it's another\ncity and even when I visit her the\nfeeling is also not right cuz yeah she's\njust so confused and stuff like that\nsure so I decided to and which was so\nhard for me to do but I decided to try\nto work with myself and cuz I I could\nbarely even visit her as well because I\nwas at a pretty bad condition but that\nled me to feeling even more guilt\nbecause I didn't visit her on top of\nthat so it was like just a bad Luke on\ntop of that with everything else I had\nyou felt like you were abandoning her\nyeah I felt like the only one that I\ncould trust in this world yeah\nyou felt like the only one you could\ntrust in this world was heard so what\nwould you feel by when you sort of\ndecided to work on yourself no I knew\nhigh I had I knew I had to twist yeah\nwhat are you feeling right now well it's\nuh yeah I don't know it's it's just\nthat's yeah I don't know maybe I feeling\nI will never\nget again basically well yeah yeah I'm\nimagining that you're kind of just\nremembering you know how much she meant\nto you and that yeah I think she was the\nonly one that made me human to be honest\num yeah or somewhat human but yeah\nWilliam do you feel alone for sure for\nsure is that the main is that that I'm\nnot part of it I don't think so I've\nthere's so many other parts on it I've\nbeen thinking about it too if it is but\nI think like even if so I can even be\nwith friends and stuff like that and and\nstill feel lonely um it's just that I\ndon't think I think there's so much more\ninto it tell us well I think I mean when\nI've been in a relationship I know what\nhappiness can be I don't have to fake it\num I know how the world should be when\nyou're a functional human so I'm touched\nupon that part and mmm you know it's\npossible yeah but I think it was through\ndistraction that I reached it as a\nrelationship I I think yeah the dealt\nwith all my problems when I met the peak\nlike it when I'm feeling good yeah how\ndo you feel we know it like that when\nI'm feeling bad I don't have motivation\nI I have so many different kind of bad\nperiods sure so it depends on which one\nyou mean so let's start by tell us the\ndifferent kinds of bad okay excellent\npoint on your part um yeah I mean I\nguess that's already one of them when\nI've been already telling me since my\nchildhood basically and yeah that was i\nI didn't understand why what function I\neven had to why I was existing because\nwhat I just heard from my mom was that\nshe hates me and that I just take place\nin the world and and uh that she doesn't\neven want me and so I took\nthe routes I yeah I what struck me a lot\nwas like when my friend told me likes\ndude who's live are you actually living\nfor\nit's not even your life and I'm like\nwhat do you mean and then that's kind of\nfirst time I opened up I was like living\nthe life to try to pleasure my mom\nbasically were to meet up her demands\nwhich was never met anyways\nbeen crazy how like how crazy is that\nshe really could never say thank you or\nyou know have never even heard her say I\nlove your stuff like that that was\ntotally out of the dictionary it's more\nlike when she told me to do things\nit was always never good enough no\nmatter what I did like if I vacuumed the\nhouse and I she came home and saw it she\nwould scream at me and also say the way\nlike you have not vacuum clean right as\nin intending that I haven't done it very\nmuch even still s even though I might\nhave still done it in the house\noh 10 yeah I don't know firely I I did a\nlot I did shopping I helped her helped\nher doing washing clothes I yeah there's\na lot of things but she have yeah two\nolder no she's the oldest hmm did she\nhave to help a lot around the house I\nknow how much from the story from what I\nunderstand I'm not really sure I haven't\nasked too much about it and I don't\nremember who told me it but he might be\nfrom her so it might be very false or I\ntake everything she says there with a\nvery grain of salt I can't really trust\nmy mother so I don't really if it's for\nmy mother then which I think it is she\nsaid that she took care of her siblings\nbecause parents were yeah out and stuff\nlike my my grandpa was a prison and my\ngrandma had to take care of her or\nsomething like that\noddly enough I I don't know if she's\nmistaken there wait she may she may be\nright that she took care of her siblings\nand we'll get to that and said okay yeah\nokay yeah yeah oh yeah different kind of\nbeds sorry uh I trailed off a little bit\nyeah so that would be like yeah I took\ndetours oh yeah and she she made me do a\nlot of things that I okay so this kind\nof paths I'm trailing off a little bit\ntoo much here I see I'm just gonna try\nto talk about the bad the bachelor boy\nyeah\nyou're doing fine bro okay yeah so the\nbats were like you're doing actually\nreally well thank you it's I tried to\nalways when I was younger I tried to\nalways make my mom happier so the\npunishment would be less yeah verbally\nand stuff like that so I always when I\ncame home\nlook if they were her shoes inside so I\ncould prepare what kind of state I could\nbe and I came here by our footsteps\nbefore like if I were to play computer\ngames\nI had study materials next to me so I\nwould like shut off the screen and put\nit in front of me just to make her not\nrage as much as she would towards me\njust to prevent as much as I could and\nyou know try to even flatter her by some\ncomplements and stuff like that but so\nyeah\nthat kind of bad is like I tried to do\nsomething I kind of diss not really I\ndidn't really discussed it at that time\nbut like I had to live through it and\nand still still feel bad about it in\nthat punishment and then there is a\nlater on before I even talked a lot\nabout this and managed this\nI had the different kind of bad as in\neverything was extremely heavy um no\nmatter what I did you mean like physical\nheaviness mmm and mentally especially\nlike you felt like your body was heavy\nyeah\neverything I did you described it really\ngood when you say debuff it really is a\nbig debuff yeah cuz and it effects on\neverything so how about at that that\ntime of debuff last like the heaviness\nthat one yeah\num because it's been in periods and\nstuff like that\nI felt it mostly when I broke up with my\ngirlfriend so that one lasted for I\nwould say two two years but before that\nI had gone through it for a very long\ntime but I think like I was living with\nit so like my my thoughts were when I\nbroke up when my girlfriend again was\nlike holy [ __ ] has it been this bad\nmaybe I cuz I wasn't quite a long time\nrelationship so I think I faded it out\nfor like five and a half years and I'm\n29\nokay yep so yeah I I think I didn't\nreally remember but there's actually a\nlot of things there that I could also\nmention actually in that period too but\nyeah I I didn't understand how heavily\nI've been through it every day because I\nthink I got used to it so much at that\ntime even though I still know it's been\nreally shitty like I even wrote a diary\nhow often my mom would scream at my ear\nand telling me how useless I am and\nstuff like that even when I was begging\nor banging my head against the wall and\nscreaming for her to stop she would\nstill continue to do that so I brought\nthat diary how many times she does it at\nmy probably worst period and I stopped\nafter like a week when I realized she\ndid it on an average one to one and a\nhalf hour per day just screaming at\nthese things and stuff like that but\nyeah sorry I lost all\nwhat I was that that's a that you don't\nI think you're doing a really remarkable\njob of trying to keep track of the\nconversation you don't actually need to\nkeep track of it so much I'm keeping\ntrack yeah\ncan I ask you a couple of other so first\nof all dude it sounds like you've been\nthrough like just you just have a really\nshitty life yeah for sure yeah I cannot\nimagine having your mom you know like be\nbanging your head against a wall\nsignaling to her in every way that you\nknow how that you were distressed and\nthat you were hurting and that she\ndoesn't give a [ __ ] and just keeps\nhurting to be honest I think she was\nactually enjoying it even more there's a\nlot of things I've tried I mean I\nstarted even ignoring her I tried to\nignore technique because yeah I remember\nI talked to my grandma I said dude I\nthink I can't I can't last anymore like\nI'm so broken and I'm quite young when\nI'm saying this I was like yeah cuz I\nwas thinking about moving out already\nwhen I was like yeah 11 12 ish and well\nthat's when I started ignoring her for\none and a half year as well I tried so\nmany different techniques just to try to\nsee what works and what you know so even\nwhen we were living in the same roof I\nignored what happens to someone who\ntries a lot of techniques and none of\nthem work well that that's my other dark\nside so the first yeah these first\nthought that I'm talking about like even\nthough it still felt so had been stuff\nlike that I still felt like I knew or I\nknew I had possibilities to actually\nwork with methods that would help me\nlike I tried to discover a lot by myself\nhow to improve and stuff like that I\nwere visiting the psychologist and\nthings like that so I still kind of felt\nhope but especially when I beat me again\ndown to these bad loops and especially\nwhen it went longer and longer I felt\nmore and more hopeless like oh [ __ ]\nmaybe there is no way to go like I've\ndone everything by the textbook above\nyeah I had so many things so that's my\nsecond bed where I start to feel because\nnow I don't feel as heavy as before\ndefinitely not but there has been\nperiods yeah but they're not as heavy as\nbefore definitely not before I could\nthink how yeah suicidal thoughts like\nfour five times per day but now it's\nit's more yeah the the way of it's\nhopeless and I'm I'm not yeah getting\nanywhere I've tried a lot yeah so I'm\nactually a little bit surprised that you\nyou're still alive\ndoes that yeah no no no no I I actually\nsay that to everyone I meet that I share\nthis story like I don't know why I'm\nstill alive that's that's how I'm saying\nI'm I literally don't know why I'm still\nalive and that's why I don't want to\npromise anyone as well when it comes to\nthem saying like yeah but yeah that's\nenough yeah yeah I get you\nso we're gonna think about I'm gonna\njust can I collect my thoughts for a\nmoment yep\nso let me start with this William I feel\nlike I've asked you two percent of the\nquestions that I want to ask and I\nunderstand two percent of what I want to\nunderstand about you okay and at the\nsame time I feel like I you know people\ncome on here for answers and so we have\nto take a step back and acknowledge that\nthe answers are I'm you know I don't\nreally have answers but the thoughts\nthat I have for you aren't gonna be\naccurate because I really don't know you\nknow we've just scratched the surface of\nwe yeah yeah at the same time you know I\nwant to share with you something that a\npatient of mine who had tried to commit\nsuicide several times you know and one\nday I asked him because he feels a lot\nthe same way you do and so I was like\nyou know so it sounds like you don't\nreally have any like reason to live like\nwhat you know you don't have hope which\nis fair because if you don't have any\nreason to hope all right cuz like we\njust tell people like oh just like keep\nhope and keep hoping I think people who\nsay that don't really understand what\nyes the lives of the people that they're\ntalking to have been like I cannot you\nknow to be an eight-year-old child and\nyelling at your mom to stop and banging\nyour head against a wall because what\nshe's saying is hurting you and for her\nto continue yelling at you for like 60\nminutes or 90 minutes is just like why\nthe [ __ ]\nand then like how many days can an\neight-year-old hold on to hope with that\nhappening how many years can you hold on\nlike you know at some point the hope\nruns out and I get that I don't think\nit's reasonable for you to hope and also\nI want you to hope and I hope that I can\nhelp you hope a little bit and if I\ncan't that's okay too because I don't\nthink it's my place to believe that I\ncan get you to hope does that make sense\nlike I'm gonna give it a shot but if you\nchoose not to hope at the end of this\nconversation like that's totally cool\nman and like I have no problem with that\nmmm I'll be saying head but at the same\ntime like I won't blame you for it right\ncuz like why the [ __ ] would you hope\nlike you\ndoing this for 29 years and you know it\nsounds like whenever you start to claw\nyour way forward something just pulls\nyou back and what's pulling you back I\nmean you know I almost get the sense\nthat you're swimming in the ocean and\nyou have a cannonball attached to your\nlegs and you can work really really\nreally hard to swim to the surface and\nget a breath of fresh air and then\nyou're kind of like put like you're not\npulling the cannonball up but like any\ntime you start to slack a little bit\nthat cannonball is there just drags you\ndown and I don't see a point and you\ncontinuing to try to swim to the surface\nif you can't ever get rid of a\ncannonball like that's just no way to\nwin life like live life yeah so the\nquestion is why do you live and I don't\nmean that I'll give you the good answer\nyeah right and I don't mean like like I\ndon't mean that in the philosophical\nsense no I get you though because I've\nbeen thinking about that extremely much\nas well one of them is I try to not be\nto be egoistic or maybe that's the main\nreason but that also runs out after a\nwhile but yeah basically like even\nthough what I feel as I feel I know\nlogically like for instance my brother\nwould be devastated and before that like\nwhen my grandma went and then I don't\nthink you get it\nhold on okay that stuff is fine I mean\nlike literally like wire like so I'm not\nsaying okay so let me tell you what this\npatient told me okay okay so he's like\nyou know he tried to kill himself a\nbunch of times and and so like I was\nlike why don't you kill yourself like\nyou know why are you no longer suicide\nladies like he had suicidal thoughts but\nhe wasn't intending on killing himself\nand then I asked him you know why is\nthat he's like well you know after the\nthird or fourth time I realized that as\nmuch as I wanted to kill myself and I\nwould try to kill myself my body\nwouldn't let me hmm so literally the\nreason he's alive is not because he has\na reason to live but because there's\nliterally a force literally on his body\nkeeps him from killing himself mm-hmm\nand that there was something inside you\nthat wants to live more than you want to\ndie right that is the reason I think\nyou're alive and yeah I didn't recognize\nwith that as well\nyeah and it's [ __ ] weird because you\nwant to die but there's something inside\nyou that's like no man we're not gonna\ndo that\nhmm right and in his case like he was\nlike he literally realized that he was\ntrying to kill his body so there was\nsome part of his being that was like\nputting pills into his mouth and trying\nto kill himself and there was another\npart of his body that was like this is\nbad for me I don't want this and he\nwould vomit and so one thing and I don't\nmean this in sort of a philosophical or\npsychological sense I mean like\nliterally if we look at it\nscientifically there is something within\nyou that is striving for life and that's\nthe only if we really look at it\nscientifically with everything all the\n[ __ ] that you've been through if you\nhaven't killed yourself the reasons to\nkill yourself are like let's give it a\nscore of a thousand and if you haven't\ndied that means that there's something\ninside you that is worth 1,001 fighting\nagainst that what can we just\nacknowledge that for a moment like does\nthat make sense yeah and and so I think\nyour way forward isn't understanding\nlike what the [ __ ] is that right because\nif we can try it like and I think you\ncan talk about all of the things that\nare bad in your life and the different\nkinds of bad you experience fantastic I\nthink each of those are particular D\nbuffs that you need to cleanse before\nyou get healed and I do think that you\ncan get healed and the reason that I\nthink you can get healed is very its\nscientific it's not hope it's not\nphilosophical it's not even\npsychological it's just that I see a guy\nwho has something within his whole being\nof a person that wants to live more than\nyou want to die and I just don't think\nyou understand what that is and I think\nyou've lived your whole life being\nconfused about that thing but as you\nbegin to understand it you'll\nactually find hope but it's not gonna\ncome from like me telling you that life\nis you know worth living which I do\nthink it is and I do think you should\ncontinue to live I'm glad you're alive\nand I do have hope for you I think you\ncan be fully healed let me just say all\nthose things good I really do we have\nthat and yeah I mean yeah I I think then\ntoo I think it comes from it starts with\nthe exploration of like live and I think\nyou're in the right spot like you're\nlike you know why am I here\nand it's not a rhetorical question that\ndoesn't mean I don't have any reason to\nlive although that could be true but the\nquestion is if you have no reason to\nlive and yet you continue to exist and\nyou have no reason to be there there has\nto be a reason why you're here and\nfinding that thing is gonna be the start\nof your journey right so like we have to\naccept as a fact that you are here yeah\nand that like this is the other thing\nnow we get philosophical because I think\nlike there's order in the universe like\nI think things happen for a reason and I\ndon't mean that in terms of like a\ndivine reason I mean like literally if I\nhold this pen and I let go it's gonna\nfall\nit fell for a reason like like if there\nif there's rain that means that they're\ngonna be clouds right that there's like\norder and rhythm to the universe and\nthat if you're alive like I don't think\nthat order in the universe breaks down\nat some arbitrary point which is what a\nlot of people who claimed to be\nscientific believed right so they sort\nof say that lay out there's like an\norder to clouds and rain and stuff but\nthere's not an order to life they just\nsort of draw this arbitrary dividing\nline which in my mind let me know if I'm\nlosing you or if this is getting\nabstract you fall um I think so yeah\nokay anyway so I think that there's a\nthere's a reason that you're alive yeah\nand I think we have to explore kind of\nwhat that is the second thing is in\nterms of your question of can you be\nhealed\nI've only they're fully healed yeah I\nthink so although maybe not let me\nabout that for a second I think you can\nbe healed enough to where you can no\nlonger want to die and you will cling on\nto life I do believe you can be fully\nhealed as well but as a clinician and\nthe scientist I can't put my money on\nfully healed but I do feel comfortable\nputting my money on healed enough yeah\nso if you would put a percentage on it\nhow much would it be so to say 80% okay\nyeah that's cool yeah I was guessing\naround eighty ninety two myself\nyeah I'm nine he's a little bit\noptimistic like I believe it's possible\nsure but I'd put my money on eighty yeah\nokay and here's and I want to hear a\nlittle bit more about like you know your\nbackslide and when you started feeling\nbetter and stuff but even before we go\nthere I'll share a couple of thoughts if\nthat's okay with you\ndo you want to jump in and say anything\nor ask questions by the way no I'm fine\nokay so I'm gonna share with you a\ncouple of thoughts and then I want to\nask you a little bit about how you\nstarted to feel better and now how you\nfeel worse okay so I think the problem\nwith getting fully healed is that like\nyou think about getting fully healed is\nlike 80% but it's not really 80% it's\nlike like sorry did you ever play\nfallout no okay\nso in fallout you have like different\nbody parts and you can like target and\ndamage different body parts right and\nthen like depending on what you damage\nyou like lose some ability like if\nsomeone like wounds your leg then your\nmovement speed is reduced if they wound\nyour arm you can't shoot things you know\nand so I think when we talk about a\nhundred percent I don't know if you can\nget a hundred percent but I think you\ncan like heal your leg and like have the\nmovement debuff gone hmm and so so I\nthink it's actually in a weird way\noptimistic that you have a lot of\ndifferent kinds of bad because if it was\njust one blob of bad like I don't know\nwhat to do about that but the feeling of\nloneliness is like a particular thing\nthat I think you can improve the feeling\nof motivation\nI think it's a particularly of\nhopelessness I think is a particularly\nbeing extremely heavy which hits you for\ntwo years at a time is a particular\nthing which you can improve and I think\nall of these things are maybe related in\nsome way but I think they're discrete\nthings so for example your feeling of\nextreme heaviness sounds to me like\nclinical depression it sounds like you\nsuffer for something called neuro\nvegetative depression and the cool thing\nis that we have good scientific evidence\nthat there may be mental health\ntreatments that you can engage in which\nwill drastically reduce the hurt from\nthat thing the feeling of loneliness I\nthink also is something that we can\naddress the feeling of oh and this is\nthe big one is worth like you don't you\nliterally have not been taught that it's\nokay for you to exist like I don't know\nhow else to put that but like literally\nyou were taught that you it's not okay\nfor you to exist\nso most eight-year-olds sort of have\nthis fundamental sense of self that it's\nlike okay for me to be here right now\nright like they walk up to you they're\nlike Daddy can I have food because they\nhave a presumption that like it's okay\nfor me to be here it's okay for me to\nwalk up to my dad and it's okay for me\nto ask him for food if they feel hungry\nlike you were actually the most\ndevastating thing is you are not given\nlike a baseline permission to exist as a\nhuman being and so I I don't know how\nyou're gonna find why you exist if\nyou're not even allowed to exist in the\nfirst place does that make sense\nyeah but it's like you don't even\ndeserve to have air to breathe is like\nwhat you were told so it sort of starts\nand this is where I think like you know\nfully healed maybe we can actually like\nyou know go from we can print heal you\nto like a hundred percent I think that's\npossible unlikely but possible and in\nthe what the committee looks like is for\nyou to have a basic sense that you are\nallowed to belong in the world and I\nthink you've got to be careful because\nyou're saying I don't feel like I belong\nI think that's even the reason that you\nhaven't made progress is because I think\nyou're you're not really meeting\nyourself where you're at it's not even\nthat like why do you belong that's not\neven like that's one step ahead\nit's are you even allowed to belong in\nany way shape or form that's the first\nquestion you got answer because I think\nright now in your head there's a part of\nyou that the answer is no like you don't\ndeserve to be here at all like what do\nyou think about that yeah so I I have\nthought about that as well a lot so I\ntried to really live in the now so I\ntried to be very neutral on that point\nbut before that yes 100% but now I still\ntry to be very neutral and I would say\nyeah I don't know where I'm at at that\npoint okay oh you wouldn't say no or yes\nso William I'm tempted to go down this\nroad with you but I think it could be\nhard for you to understand because I\ndon't know how to explain it adequately\nand I think we're gonna lose our viewers\neven more but I'm gonna give it a shot\nis that okay okay so let's start with\nthe idea that you don't even deserve to\nbe here in any way shape or form forget\nabout why am I here it's like you're not\nallowed to be here to begin with with me\nthere okay okay so why am I here is a\nquestion that's like for level two level\none question is do I get to be here with\nme mm-hmm\nthen you said okay so that was a\nquestion where you used to ask yourself\ndo I even get to be here do I get to\nspawn in at all or do I like sit in the\nlobby and like never get to spawn in and\ndon't get to play the game like why I'm\nplaying the game is a separate question\ndo I even get to spawn in with me yeah\nyeah then you said you started being in\nthe present and the more that you're in\nthe present it sounds like it's easier\nto get away from the question of do I\nget to spawn in at all yes yeah yes now\nlet me ask you a question is being in\nthe present does that give you do you\nfeel like you have permission to exist\nor do you distract yourself from the\nquestion of whether you have permission\nto exist\nprobably distracting myself from the\nquestion I would say yeah okay I hope\npeople are able to follow that because\nthat's really important right because\nwhat I think your perception of sliding\nback is which in turn is gonna make you\nhopeless right so the more that you feel\nlike you're moving forward and you slide\nback the more your hopelessness is gonna\nincrease that's logical with me yeah\nright so but I think that the reason\nthat you you're right to be hopeless\nbecause that's not actually getting\nhealed that's like getting shielded\nright and so a shield sort of gives you\nthe same effect as healing but it's not\nreally healing because when the shield\ngoes away like you're back to square one\nand then you start to ask yourself can I\nget healed when actually what you're\ndoing is you're distracting which is\nlike a shield its bonus hit points it's\nnot actual healing yeah so now I have to\nthink even if that's the case so I feel\nlike I understand you now I have the\nproblem of where do we go through so I'm\ngonna need a second do you have\nquestions mmm no okay that would help me\na lot if you did but yeah you can ask me\nquestions if there's something unclear\nno I mean there I mean there's a lot\nthat I want to know about you but I feel\nlike we're on the same page that you\nknow your attempts to get better aren't\nreally getting you better which I agree\nwith yeah I just don't know how to heal\nyou huh which I have to just give me a\nsecond okay so I'm gonna think out all\nright so you don't\neven deserve to exist so how do we help\nyou understand that you deserve to exist\nand do we want to ask you more questions\nabout so the safer route is probably we\njust ask you more questions about how\nyou got how you came to know that you\ndon't deserve to exist or we can just\ntry to give you an experience of you\ntaking your existence for granted and\nfor you to understand and sit and feel\nwithin yourself that you deserve to be\nhere something\nas well yeah that might give you it so I\nthink this with it with the existence\npart I think that also is very much\nconnected to the loneliness that I feel\nlike even when friends say that oh yeah\nyou mean a lot to me and stuff like that\nit's it's kind of like I don't really\nbelieve them yeah yes but I do have\nworked with a lot of self-compassion and\ntaking like you complimented ghost in\nthe real world I have done like that\nextremely many times yes like where I\ndissociate disassociate myself\nwell extremely much like even when I'm\nat a party with friends that are close\nto me and everybody's happy I just\nwonder like what am I doing here oh\nright I have to take my happiness around\nthem and stuff like that this all what\nyeah the the ghost thing is yeah\nit's it's very it has been many of that\ntimes yes\nyeah sorry sorry for derailing you so so\nyou were saying you know your friends\nhave yeah I'm just getting the sense\nthat like you you know it's like you're\nplaying a game where you're like you\nknow you can interact with NPCs and\nstuff but you're like you're like\nethereal you're not like a real\ncharacter\nand it's like the NPC's are sort of\nthere and you're interacting with them\nbut you don't I mean it makes sense to\nme that you you can't understand so it\nsounds like you're confused not confused\nbut you really can't digest maybe that's\nthe word I'm looking for\nthat you bring value to other human\nbeings it's that fair like you don't\nlike you sort of get what they're saying\nbut like it doesn't yeah you're that\nmean yeah you can't digest it like it's\nnot yeah right it's like it's like they\ncan't touch you you like their hand just\ngoes right through you it's like not\nlanding with you mm-hm and and I think\nthat comes back because you haven't like\nzoned into the world yeah like you have\nto be like in the world and like\nexisting there and understand that\nyou're there for other people to be able\nto affect you\nyeah and and I think a lot of the stuff\nthat people have tried isn't working\nlike the reason you can't get healed is\nbecause you don't have a physical body\nright you got a zone in first and like\nnot be a ghost and then you can like get\nHP back but it comes with this basic it\ncomes to the basic idea that you do not\nbelong in this world and to me hmm what\ndo you think about that yeah I mean\nsense but when am i when I was in a\nrelationship I could like I did touch\nupon the world and stuff and none of\nthese thoughts has occurred where\nanything like that I like the the colors\nof the world just I appreciated it so\nmuch more like autumn colors and stuff\nlike that like all small things like\nbecause I before that I really faked a\nlot like fake it till you make it I\nfaked my posture and things like that to\nbe happy but when I was in the world I\ndidn't even have to fake it I could see\nit all and it began super clear for me\nyeah so you're like a ghost that hidden\ncar nated and like you know ghosts see\nthe world in shades of grey and they\npretend but you had become a person so\nit's it's actually great that you went\nthere because my next question was gonna\nbe can you tell me about your\nrelationship can you tell me about your\nrelationship how he was or char like how\ndid you meet your girl you said\ngirlfriend right yeah yeah well\ntechnically yeah to friends yeah to\nreturns I'm thinking there's there was\none time we met earlier faced but\nthrough threats yeah show me your honor\nbut there were some things that she\nnoticed with which I filtrated totally\nright not really sure why even because\nevery time I've had a girlfriend and\ntalk and try to introduce them to my\nparents were I I don't remember why I\ndid it\nor if it was my mom forcing me to do it\nI don't really remember why but they\nwere all super terrified with it which I\nam but they all are super terrified\nwho's they\nthe girlfriends I've had ok the\ndifferent ones yeah and but\nwas when in a very long time she noticed\nalso how how toxic my mom was towards me\nand I thought I didn't even think\nanything of it because that was such a\nkind of low tier toxic nough so to say\nwhere I didn't even does your mom being\nnice\nyeah yeah exactly and and I did it like\nthat was so out of my filtration but she\nmentioned that night she was like dude I\ngot so infuriated I wanted to like kind\nof scream back at her or punch her but I\ndidn't even notice that and she had to\nhighlight that because usually it's so\nmuch worse who said I want to scream at\nsomeone and my girlfriend at that time\nso she felt like screaming at your mom\nyeah in punch sugar yeah at my mom\nbecause my mom was trash-talking me so\nmuch like so I was doing the cooking and\nstuff like that and yeah working and\nstuff like that so she said I I think\nshe said something along the line like\noh I I hope you take care of him he's so\nuseless he doesn't even know how to cook\nand take care of himself and things like\nthat but yeah it got totally out of my\nradar I didn't even think of it that\nmuch how does it feel to have someone\nwho wants to defend you like that it\nfelt nice it's like it felt really nice\nbecause in that time as I said I was\nreally living the world and I think\nthat's maybe why I'll also filtrated her\ntalk even better than ever\ncuz I guess I guess no matter if I\nignore her and stuff like that it still\nsips in through my ears no matter what\num no matter what I do and they even if\nI pretend not to hear her or put like\nearphones and earplugs in my ya ears\nthey still go through I still get\naffected by it but there I didn't even\ncare about it so it's sure and\nand so tell me about you guys were\ntogether for five and a half years\nthat's a long time yeah yeah and they\nactually moved in immediately even\ntogether but yeah we talked about a lot\nbefore and met before that as well in in\nwhen did your breakup\num three years ago and when you happy\nfor the time that you all work together\nyeah yeah what what ended up happened\ndid you feel like you had substance or\nRestall ghost hi\nI realized also I picked up a lot of\nthings like I realized but I don't know\nexactly at what order it becomes um but\nI realized I picked up some toxic nest\nfor my mom that I said to her and she\nsaid it back to me ah like I think I\nrealized my toxic naissance stopped\nmyself but but then I realized that she\nwas quite toxic in in in the same way as\nmy mom beep in in a different way I mean\nit was a little bit more toxic\nrelationship in the end that kill it I\nwould say what was toxic about your\nrelationship or it was actually much\nmore on to that than that there was some\nthings we didn't really agree on and\nlike what so will William here's here's\nwhat I'm trying to do so I'm seeing the\nbeginning of your relationship where\nyou're happy\nthere's someone who cares about you is\ndefending yeah and I'm wondering like\nwhat happened to that relationship yeah\nI think it started fading out it\nreference point like it's faded out more\nand it started becoming heavy being in\nthe relationship ship two in the end\nlike it really didn't like yeah\nsomething I kind of Google because I\ntried a lot because I fear I think I\nhave like fear of embedment and stuff\nlike that so I tried to a lot to get\nthis relationship to work we even broke\nup like yeah three times the third time\nI really got the courage to really end\nit but it took more maybe it was things\nfrom the past that got back to me again\nbut he took more to actually be in the\nrelationship like he consumed so much up\nmore energy what was hard about the\nrelationship\neverything I mean I don't know if it\nmakes sense but it's yeah and we didn't\nreally see like we did before as well\nlike the yeah like the sparks of being a\nnot really getting a lot of vagueness\nfrom you I'm getting a lot of\nconclusions and a lot of vagueness yes\nand I really do understand you gave me a\nlot of color and substance to the\nbeginning of your relationship yeah but\nI'm sure you know a lot of color and\nsubstance at the end you call it talk\nyeah we tried to Stan yes sell stocks we\ntry to so I tried to get it to work for\na long time cuz well no that's way here\ntrying to get to work our relationship\nto work that we had what was not work so\nwhat I'm hearing very clearly is your\nefforts in the hopelessness but I'm not\nhearing like what the problem was that\nthere was like for instance we didn't\nagree on like the dividing parts of like\nfixing the house cleaning and cooking\nlike those trivial things and and tell\nme how did you guys disagree about that\nwell\nI'll break up with her there was a lot\nof reasons a lot of reasons\nthey're from trivial to more complexed\nbut yeah sum it up it was like consuming\nmore energy than giving it up\ntell me tell you why mmm there I don't\nknow how personal it is like I I don't\nwanna say it without her permission and\nstuff like that okay that's that's\ntotally that's good so yeah it's it's\nit's too hard for me to actually say\nit's here okay but you know what they\nare yes I would say so yeah for sure cuz\nI was the one proposing to even break up\nto you and stuff like that yeah so I I\nkind of raised those things to get it to\nwork but it didn't so that's why I was\nlike yeah so can you tell me what you\nknow we you said after a couple of years\nit started to become harder like what\nbecame harvard uh to be in the\nrelationship yeah what about the\nrelationship came hard yeah I mean to\neven um I don't know it felt like it\nhindered me a lot to like she was so shy\nso whenever we had to meet friends I had\nto be the one contacting and stuff like\nthat and I started irritating about\nthese stuffs as well like there was a\nlot of things I started to get irritated\nabout and stuff like that is good you\nfeel like she wasn't pulling her weight\nin the relationship like she was yeah\nher fair share\nyes yes definitely that's one of the big\nones well that's one of the bigger\nreasons\ncan you just map out the other bigger\nreasons like I once again you don't have\nto say anything that you're concerned\nabout yeah I I mean is that okay to\nshare with us or is that not okay [ __ ]\nwell first let's cuz I don't want you to\nsay things that you don't want to say\nbut like if I ya know I'm gonna skip\nthat because I okay want her to me first\n- yeah let me okay then let me say this\nbut we went on a psychologist to get a\ntry to try to fix it as a co well that's\ngood so yeah we really tried a lot of\nthings but yes have you been dating now\nyeah you gonna pick up three years ago\nright yeah yeah yeah I've been on some\ndates and yeah I have yes somewhat\ndisappointing but yeah but one of them\nwas quite nice I would say um but I I\ndon't think it's gonna lead to anywhere\nyeah why not cuz she doesn't really want\nto have anything serious and you were\nlooking for something serious yeah I\nwould say so but I've been thinking a\nlot about just being happy and stuff\nlike that - in in the relationship so\nthat's kind of what we agreed and now as\nwe are where we are\nyes okay but yeah I would definitely\nwant a more serious um I wouldn't\nhere I actually got a lot of things\nfrom your community it's an awesome\ncommunity so I'm actually digging into\nwhich yeah sparked some more new hopes\nfor me as well and I've actually done\nsomething else that has made me feel so\nmuch better now as well so I'm actually\nmore at the yeah it's been good but yeah\nI just made future itself what have you\nbeen so it sounds like you started\nfeeling better after hmm because at the\nvery beginning you said you started\nfeeling better after being like active\nin our community then you started to\nslip back so yeah well yeah but slipping\nback was even before or even in the\ncommunity but I tried an SSRI\nalternative which helps a lot so yeah\nnow that just lifted me up a lot and I\nfound\nthink that correlates to me a lot\nsomeone linked some sea PTSD if you know\nwhat it is yeah yeah and it resonates\nextremely much with me so I'm actually\nreading a book about it now so good in\nhopes and so far 40 50 pages in and I\nfeel like it's describing me literally\nyeah so what's the book that it it's\ncalled from well see PTSD from surviving\nto thriving cool yeah okay so when did\nyou start to get better because it\nsounds like you started getting better\nrecently so it sounds like there was it\nwas when I took this alternative I I\ndon't know if it's better it just it\njust removes the debuff so to say by I\ndon't know what happens if I stop it or\nlike the wound is still there tried to\nheal and heal right so it's gonna be\ninteresting to see when I stopped doing\nthat for a while what what's gonna\nhappen as well so I'm at you sir are you\nfeeling better nowadays I am feeling\nbetter when I've started taking it yes\nhow long have you been taking it one and\na half month okay hmm and and so it\nsounds like you now in your psychologist\nis aware that you have C PTSD or no I\nactually called her up and mention it\nwhen I got to know about it and we\nactually took a session again and stuff\nlike that cuz she was not really\nsurprised if I fall him back but I told\nher that I've fallen back to the battle\ntracks and stuff like that but I'm\nreally confused are you or have you\nfallen back are you doing better I'm\nsorry I feel after up taking the\nalternatives I feel better\nlike I have energy to do things now yeah\nit's not a big weight I can't even do my\nhobbies I can't even game I couldn't\neven game before like II I got disgusted\nby me\nplaying ADA because I okay anything I\ndid was just horrible water yeah\nsigh even though when I forced myself to\ndo things I couldn't but now I actually\ncan do things good for you man yeah\ndefinitely\nso yes I am better but I wonder if I'm\nbetter only because I'm taking them and\nthen when I stop I come come back\nexactly where I was before like yes that\nwhat I can help you with so what can I\nhelp you with mmm I was wondering if you\nif you knew where to go next\nfantastic from my point of view yeah\nokay and that I can certainly help you\nWilliam it sounds like you're doing\nbetter yeah and what I'm hearing from\nyou is fear that the only reason you're\ndoing better is because you have this\nartificial medication that's tampering\nwith your neuro chemistry and that\nyou're not actually doing better hmm so\nnow let me tell you what healing looks\nlike okay so like I guess what I'm\nhearing from you is can I still get\nhealed or is this another shield yeah\nlike because the medication feels like a\nshield and that's I think exactly what\nit is and can you be fully healed and\nmaybe what you're looking for me is\ndirection and how to get fully healed or\nhow to get healed and what's the role of\nmedication how do you move forward and\nthe short answer is that I think okay so\nhere we go okay and then I'll give you a\nchance to ask questions then maybe we'll\nmeditate and we'll wrap up does that\nsound okay yep okay so I'm gonna start\nby sharing with you something called\nbunch of Goya theory which is gorgeou\nmeans sheath like what you put a sword\nin you know like a sheet and then bunch\nmeans five so the idea here is that you\nhave five layers of being so when we\nthink about William William is like has\na physical body and then William also\nhas\nthoughts like those are separate things\nright like if I if you lose an arm or\nyou still William yep if you have a body\nand then unfortunately like your\ngrandmother it sounds like she's got\ndementia and I you know it's a terrible\nthing to deal with you know she has a\nphysical body but like who she is as a\nperson has sort of slipped away right so\ndo you see that like who a person is is\nnot like mind or body\nit's like mine bus body plus actually\nother stuff so a couple thousand years\nago Yogi's or Ayurvedic physicians\ncalled vidiians unclear exactly you know\nwhat they were said that basically there\nare five layers of being so the first\nlayer of being is physical the second is\nenergetic the third is emotional the\nfourth is intellectual and the fifth is\nspiritual and I think in order for you\nto be healed you've got to get like\nhealing done on all of those levels okay\nso let's talk about each of your\nproblems wonder if I should draw this\nout can you hold on a second I'm gonna\ngo grab do you want iPad do you want\ndiagrams planets okay give me a second\nokay let's just take a quick break it\nrun to the restroom if you need to I'm\ngonna grab water and then I'm gonna grab\nmy iPad okay can you see we good to go\nlet's check in with twitch chat can you\nall see that okay all right\nso William your joshimuz how do you get\nfully healed right yeah and we're yeah\nyeah so yeah I'm gonna tell you how you\ncan get fully healed okay so it starts\nwith this bunch goorsha\nokay so you have physical energetic and\nwhat I'm gonna do is break down your\nquote-unquote\ndiagnosis amongst these and so you're\ngonna see how all of the things that are\nwrong with you not I mean all but that's\ngrandiose so I'm gonna show you the\ndifferent essentially you've got like\nfive layers and what's going on is that\nof your layers has been attacked and\ndamaged in different ways so the process\nof filth all healing actually requires\nyou to to heal each of these layers and\nwe'll sort of it requires you to heal\neach of the layers and then the other\nproblem that I'll try to show you is why\nyou feel hopeless because the things\nthat you're healing are actually not on\nthe layer that the damage was done and\nI'll explain what that means okay so the\nfirst thing is is you have this sense of\nsluggishness right so let's do like dye\ndiagnosis here okay and then let's do\nlike treatment over here so if we think\nabout sluggishness do you think that\nthat's physical energetic emotional\nintellectual or spiritual your body\nbeing heavy physical okay so sluggish I\ndon't know actually in no way I yeah\nwait it's an energetic\nvery good so it's actually on more than\none and okay so let's think about like\nso just talking to your psychologist\nhelp you with your feelings of\nsluggishness if it helped yes does it I\nmean it came\nyeah okay but so so not as a hell not as\nheavy as before as well okay so so this\nis a good example of like if we have you\nknow emotional treatment here so if we\ndo medication that gives us a lot of\nhealing right if we do talk therapy\nso that's actually the emotional mind\nright so if we do emotional treatments\nfor physical problems we get a little\nbit of benefit but do you see how\nmedication helps way more than talking\nabout your feelings mm-hmm so the other\ninteresting thing okay so we'll get to\nthat so the other thing that you can do\nis have you ever done chi gong or prana\nI am do you meditate with us on stream\nI've meditated for a while yes okay so\nthere are some kinds of meditation that\nare called Brown ayam or in the Chinese\nsystem what's your ethnicity by the way\nyeah it's Chinese and what part of the\nworld are you in Sweden okay so like if\nyou do pranayama or Qi Gong these are\nspecifically meditative practices that\nare aimed at boosting your energetic\nself or your chi or your prana\ndoes that make sense mm-hmm so it's like\nnot like meditating on you know the\nnature of things or stuff like that it's\nnot an intellectual meditation it's like\nan energetic meditation so if you guys\nhave ever heard of the wim HOF method\nhave you ever heard of wim HOF no so wim\nHOF is this guy who learned this like\nform of I think Tibetan meditation where\nlike he can now do things that are\nphysically impossible in terms of like\nresisting cold so he'll go and like sit\nand die yeah and so the thing is like\nwhat he does is like physically not\npossible you can't be in hypothermic\nwater for an hour and like not lose\nfingers but that's literally what wim\nHOF is capable of doing what wim HOF\ndoes is pran I am so like vish it\nabsolutely works there's also data that\nsuggests that doing Brown I am actually\nmakes you resistant to heart attacks\nwhich I can go into the physiology of\nlike\nhow that works but because it's actually\nreally fascinating the point is that you\ncan actually do things through Braun I\nam and chi-gong that will boost your\nenergy I don't know how else to put it\nbut like when you feel sluggishness if I\nwere to do blood tests I may find\nvitamin D being low right so that's an\nexample of something that leads to\ndepression low level vitamin D levels\nlead to depression it's possible that\nyour vitamin D deficient but you just\nfeel sluggish if I take you to a doctor\nand they listen to your lungs and I take\nyou to like an orthopedic surgeon and I\nget him to like test your strength\nnothing is physically gonna be wrong\nwith your body you get that when you're\nsluggish but yeah something it feels\nlike literally like your sluggishness is\nan energy problem and there are some\ntechniques what the yogis realize like\nthere are some techniques that you can\ndo to boost your energy because you're\nnot doing something physical it's like\nthey're working specifically on the\nenergetic body another good example of\nthis is yoga or Tai Chi and there are\nstudies that show that yoga and Tai Chi\nis superior to exercise its meaning\nthings like arthritis and if you go to\npeople who are experts in yoga and you\nask them why do you think that yoga is\nsuperior to exercise because then both\nof them you're moving right so like why\nis yoga superior to Tai Chi in some\nclinical trials there's a great paper by\nfor example Chen Chen Wang in the New\nEngland Journal of Medicine from like\n2010 12 where she does a trial on\nosteoarthritis and compares Tai Chi to\nexercise and finds that Tai Chi is\nsuperior and so the question is that\nboth of these are physical practices\nscientifically how is it that Tai Chi\noutperforms exercise because you're\nmoving your body in both cases does that\nmake sense but how that you should get\nthe same effect but clearly\nscientifically we are finding that Tai\nChi is not the same as exercise and if\nyou ask Tai Chi masters what they say is\nyeah it's because we work on an\nenergetic level not just the physical\none what does that mean\nno one has any [ __ ] idea like\nscientists have been trying to find\nevidence of chi or prana and they've\nnever been\nto find it all we know is that when you\nincorporate when you design a practice\nthat's based on this hoity-toity\nunscientific principle of energy it\nactually outperforms purely physical\npractices that is a scientific fact so\nmy point is that in terms of healing\nyourself you can do these things okay\nand what that's gonna do over time is\nwhen you take out the medication you're\ngonna lose the benefit of the medication\nyou with me yeah but if you do these\nthings in the meantime this is gonna\nmake a very slow plus very very slow and\nif you do this for six months and then\nyou stop medication you're gonna have\nlike a plus that's left over and you'll\ndo better without medication does that\nmake sense\nmm-hmm okay so basically the thing about\nenergetic practices in Bronte um is that\nthey're gonna heal you that it's like\nit's like a regeneration buff you're\ngonna heal like one hit point every week\nand so if that's all you do when you're\nfeeling super depressed and sluggish\nit's not gonna be finished enough for\nyou to notice any difference with me\nyeah I can't see your face now that's\nwhy I'm asking\noh okay and at the same time it's\nbecause I have the iPad pulled up gotcha\nso oh actually but maybe yeah I have to\nhave it below but at the same time it is\ngonna heal you over time the other\nproblem is that if you are sluggish\nyou're not gonna have the time or energy\nto be able to do yoga or pranayama\ndoes that make sense yeah so what we\nhave to do is start with medication so\nthat you feel more energy and then you\nuse that shield or the artificial energy\nboost of medication to start to do other\nthings that are gonna lead to more\nlong-term healing you good with that\nyeah yeah okay now we're gonna talk\nabout other things so then okay so this\nis fine but is your problem restricted\nto physical and energetic stuff no where\ndoes see PTSD go and will explain what\nthat is in a second where do you think\nsee PTSD fix fits on\nand like emotional absolutely okay\nso let's explain what see PTSD is can\nyou tell us what it means complex PTSD\nand what makes something complex PTSD\nversus regular PTSD um I'm event that\ncontinuously happens over a period of\ntime rather than just one event\nexcellent so let's say that you know I'm\nwalking down the street and I walk past\nsome of the riots that are going on and\na police officer shoots a rubber bullet\nand I'm carrying my groceries which\nactually happened to a lady and the the\nbullet hits me in the face and you know\neven people have lost eyes and stuff so\nthat's a one-time event that leads to\npost-traumatic stress disorder all you\nneed is a single event to end up with\npost-traumatic stress disorder\npost-traumatic stress disorder affects\npeople in particular ways it's\ncharacterized by flashbacks nightmares\nthings like that but their intrinsic\nsense of self is not necessarily\ndestroyed by a singular event right\nbecause if I walk down the street and\nlike I'm dr. K and I'm like I feel\nconfident in Who I am as a human being\nand something traumatic happens to me\nthat's terrible and it could be\ndestroying me as a human being but it\ndoesn't have to destroy me as a human\nbeing\nwhat complex PTSD is is when trauma\nhappens to you over and over and over\nand over again so when William tells us\nthat he is an eight-year-old boy who is\nscreaming at his mom to stop and banging\nhis head against a wall and she\ncontinues to yell at him for an hour and\na half and that [ __ ] happens day after\nday after day after day that is a whole\ndifferent ball game\nfrom being like shot once or being\nrobbed or being raped or whatever that's\ncomplex PTSD okay so now let's think\nabout what are the treatments of complex\nPTSD what do you think medication is\ngoing to do for that\nit just gives you this temporary booth\nbuff that we talked about like right so\nthat's kind of like talking for emotions\nthough talking at like acting on an\nemotional level for a physical problem\nonly gives you like one point of healing\ndoes that make sense\nhmm and so medication for an emotional\nproblem only gives you one point of\nhealing does that make sense yeah yeah\nright so I want could I add something as\nwell sure so I think what we tried to\ncure was like regular PTSD so to say\nwith my psychologist but and that's why\nI guess it caused so much confusion why\nI'm still feeling as I did and stuff\nlike that excellent so you're you took\nyou took the next part right out of my\nmouth the real truth is that complex\nPTSD doesn't go here it goes here and\nthis is where PTSD goes because with\nwhat complex PTSD what happens is that\nyour sense of a human being gets [ __ ]\nthat's a spiritual problem this goes\nback to ghosts why am I here right\nthat's not emotions do I deserve to live\ndoes that make sense like\nthat's not an emotional issue that's\nlike a spiritual issue what do you think\nabout that huh yeah yeah it makes total\nsense cuz it's it I mean it didn't\nreally help me so it's example so this\nis why talk therapy is gonna be 1 plus 2\nplus or three pluses hmm what do you\nthink okay makes sense 1 plus right so\nyour psychologist can help you here if\nyou had regular PTSD but the\npsychologist is only going to be a 1 +\nover here and this is the biggest\nproblem that I think actually your\npsychologist can't help you with three\npluses but they have to do that kind of\nwork so this is the biggest problem that\nI see with like a lot of quote unquote\nmental health diagnosis is that like so\nthe reason that I'm an effective\npsychiatrist is because I actually don't\ndo a whole lot of psychiatry what I do\nis a lot of spiritual work because I\nthink people like you when I said that\nif the core of your problem will is or\nWilliam is that like you don't even know\nif you deserve to live so we can deal\nwith the suicidality and the negative\nemotions and shame and all that [ __ ] all\nof that stuff is over here right so this\nis shame you know feels bad man right\nthat's all emotional stuff and now we\nget to another problem which is that\nyou're an analytical guy so what you try\nto do is essentially like ant like you\nuse analytical treatments for emotional\nproblems and this is the worst is that\nwhen you ask yourself like what you have\nthis feeling of being a ghost right and\nthen what happens is you start asking\nyourself questions about do I deserve to\nbe here you start to use your analytical\nmind to solve a spiritual problem and\nthat doesn't actually get you [ __ ] or\nmaybe oneplus does that I guess this is\nthe reason why I can't where they listen\nto it as well like any emotions as that\nfeel would Lincoln is say more about\nthat so like I try to listen to my\nemotions why\nam i failing sad and [ __ ] right now but\nit's more like a constant noise and and\nit's it's more because it's on the\nspiritual level rather than the\nemotional or either one so eat your\nanalytical an analytical approach to\nyour emotions is gonna get you even if\nit's emotional the analytical approach\nis not going to help very much and if\nit's spiritual it's not going to help\nvery much the whole reason that people\nlike you have trouble getting fully\nhealed is because your treatments do not\nline up with the sources of your\nproblems\nright for a physical problem you need a\nphysical treatment for an energetic\nproblem you need an energetic treatment\nfor an emotional problem you need talk\ntherapy for complex PTSD you need to\nfigure out why am I here and how do I\ndeserve to live now that's not going to\nhappen to them through talk therapy\nthat's gonna happen through something\nlike meditation right and how does\nmeditation help you have to sit and you\nhave to feel that you and like it's kind\nof hard to describe or happiness in a\nrelationship right so during the good\nyears with your golf girlfriend because\nwhere does happiness in a relationship\ngo here it's not just emotional maybe\nit's emotional right so maybe maybe goes\nover here too I'm not really sure okay\nbut the key thing is that I think when\nyou were happy in the relationship the\nreason that you felt more human and less\nof a ghost's the reason you saw the\nworld in color is because she gave you a\nsense of belonging what do you think\nabout that know for sure for sure and so\nwhat happened is she answered this\nquestion for you do I deserve to live\nand in the way that she interacted with\nyou as a human being made you think that\nthe answer is yes and as their\nrelationship declined your sense of\ndeserving to live was was still young\nand fragile so two years of a\nrelationship with a shy girl who doesn't\nunderstand quite as much about life as\nlet's say someone else does could not\nstrengthen you enough she couldn't do\nin two years of loving you and making\nyou feel like you belong she could not\nundo 22 years of emotional damage and\ncomplex PTSD which makes perfect [ __ ]\nsense right and then when when the\nrelationship goes sour it's not enough\nand so can you be fully healed\nabsolutely now I feel confident because\nI've talked myself into it and I've\nconvinced myself in the way that you get\nfully healed is that you do this and\nthis kind of goes back to earlier when I\nwas saying okay like it actually like\nyou have lots of different problems\nabsolutely and so fully heal doesn't\ncome from medication it comes from all\nof this [ __ ] because you have [ __ ] going\non on every part of your being right the\nonly thing that I'm not sure is it\ndoesn't sound like you have an\nintellectual problem what what is that\nexactly\nso I don't hear like strong cognitive\nbiases about the way that you view\nyourself hmm right so like some of the\npeople that I talk to like a good\nexample of this like a couple weeks ago\nwe had interviewed sweet Anita and\nSweden EDA felt like she doesn't deserve\nto like take care of herself so\ncognitive bias goes over here oh I guess\nI've worked\non that part absolutely and that's why I\ndon't think we see it because you did\nyeah CBT or psychologist yeah right\nself-compassion helped a lot extremely a\nlot and meditation helped a lot in that\npart too yep I would say right so the\ncognate so let's just think about this\nso in in emotion creates a cognitive\nbias does this make sense like the\nemotion is on the emotional level and\nthen you feel like you're a piece of\n[ __ ] and then your analytical mind\ncreates justifications for why you're a\npiece of [ __ ] but that's a separate part\nof your mind and you can use self\ncompassion sorry guys this is getting\nmessy so self compassion is going to\ntarget this and CBT which is cognitive\nbehavioral therapy is gonna target the\nanalytical construction based on the\nroot of your negative emotion does that\nmake sense yeah okay questions you wrote\nmeditation at the spiritual it's an a\nkind of general meditation or what knows\nI have been meditating for quite a while\nyep so you need to do meditations that\nare geared towards discovering your\nsense of self so this is it's like this\npeople call this meditation to self\ncompassion like Metta meditation is over\nhere so that's like self compassion like\nloving-kindness meditation yeah right so\nthere are lots of different kinds of\nmeditation and they work on different\nlevels there are also some meditations\nlike I'll ask people to do investigative\nmeditations like what is the sound of\nthe breath that's like\nkind of an intellectual meditation so\nyou need to do like Who am I and in\nparticular there are a few powerful\nmantras that will help you answer this\nquestion okay but that's the kind of\nmethod I'll teach you something today I\njust gotta think about this the first\nthing that I need to do is check in with\nyou though does this make sense it makes\na lot of sense yeah I'm actually really\nhappy to actually even see it in picture\nand then and noticing and seeing the\nparts like because I believe I've come a\nreally far away even in these like\ntwenty-one years even though I have like\naimlessly gone somewhere I think it\nstill learned me something along the way\nand it makes sense when adding\neverything because yeah it's maybe it's\nmore like all these sections I have to\nwork on and there's like one last piece\nI haven't which I guess is like the\nspiritual which I haven't really dealt\nwith so yeah it actually makes much\nsense and yeah and so here's here's why\nI think your hopelessness is completely\nunderstandable because when you have\ncomplex PTSD and you go to a\nprofessional and they give you a\nmedication that's not gonna work and so\nbasically the the basic problem that\nthat I think the reason that you're\nhopeless and it's not your fault I think\nyou've actually done remarkably well\ngiven the hand that you were dealt it's\nactually [ __ ] amazing is that you're\nlike all of your treatments are like all\nover the place you're trying to solve\nstuff with some courses from like other\ncourses and so your effect size it's\ngonna be kind of like you're you know\nI'm continuously like trying to heal\nyour right arm even though the damage is\nin your left leg and the issue is that\nyou get a little bit of bandwidth you\nget a little bit from here you get a\nlittle bit from here and then over time\nthough it feels like it's not really\nworking because you're not targeting\nyour treatments towards what you've done\nyou are actually the if that's not even\nentirely true because I think you've\nactually like\ncuz you had problems here and here too\nit's just you've done you've actually\nfound good treatments right so you had\nemotional feelings of and this is\nexactly why it's beautiful so you had\nemotional feelings of shame and then you\nsay self compassion helped with that and\nthis is the mistake this is the\ndiagnostic mistake that people make when\nsomeone has complex PTSD and they've\nthey're filled with shame and they get\ntreated with self compassion they think\nthey are fixed but they're not fixed\nbecause they never got to this hmm right\nand so then you get hopeless because you\nsaid okay I have complex PTSD I have all\nthese negative emotions I learn self\ncompassion and I'm not fixed and then\nhopelessness is completely reasonable\nbecause complex pts you thought you did\nthe treatment for complex PTSD and\nyou're not better and so then you're\nhopeless absolutely man you should be\nhopeless because you thought you did\nwhat you needed to do and you did a lot\nwhich you can tell us and you're like\nhey I actually grew a lot there hey the\nmedication is actually really helping\nand you're not fully healed and so then\nyour your question is beautiful now we\ncome back to your original question can\nI become fully healed in the answer and\nit's completely reasonable for you to\nask that question because you did this\nand you did this and you talked to a\npsychologist and you found yourself not\nbeing fully healed yeah and then you\nstart to question your like if I talk to\nthe psychologist more if I add on more\nmedications or if I learn more self\ncompassion\nwill I be fully healed and the thing is\nyou actually know the answer to that\nwill and the answer is no you're not\ngoing to be fully healed not from that\nyeah and so I feel like this picture and\nthe overview if it feels like it's in\ncapture kind of any problem I guess\nand absolutely like it's an overview of\neverything basically yes and this is\nwhat the Yogi's learned they said that a\nhuman being can be divided into these\nfive layers and that an attack on one\nlayer deserves a treatment on that same\nlayer and that a strong goorsha or one\nstrong layer can buffer or protect you\nother layers so when I deal with people\nwith cancer right that's a gigantic\nattack on the physical and the energetic\nand if they are deeply spiritual people\nand have a lot of emotional support they\ndo way better hmm\nwhen when your grandmother so brief is\nan emotional attack right it's a\ndifferent color yes it's good so grief\nattacks you here and so when that\nhappens your physical it almost\nreverberates so you get energetic damage\nand you get physical damage and there's\nstudies that show that if someone loses\na loved one and I give them a vaccine\ntheir immune response to the vaccine is\nlower essentially vaccines become\nineffective in people who are in grief\nand that's a physical effect based on an\nemotional insult it's an energetic\neffect based on an emotional insult when\nyou go to see your grandmother and she's\nnot there on the inside that's an\nemotional blow which contributes to your\nsluggishness you see that and so it's\nall connected and so the cool thing is\nthat you can like strength in one area\nand it'll kind of protect you from the\nothers and that's how like people this\nis where resilience comes from so\nsomewhere in here will William I think\nyou're actually very strong\nintellectually and that has basically\nbeen like how you save a lot because\nyou've been emotionally [ __ ] you've\nbeen I don't know if like you're\nphysically active or whatever maybe\nyou're strong physically as well but\nlike spiritually like you know you\nsomething's been met missing and you've\njust basically your intellect has been\nlike carrying the rest of your sheets\nand that's why you're alive because\nsomewhere in there there's something\nhere that is like you know keeping you\ngoing hmm\nokay final questions thoughts no I'm\nactually really really happy and glad\nhoo-uh yeah I didn't expect too much cuz\nI felt very hopeless and stuff and I\ndidn't expect you to even have an answer\nand stuff like that but yeah well\nsometimes I surprise myself it's yeah\nthat's that's awesome yeah III mean I\ndon't think I can fix you but I can give\nyou this so now you just think about\nmeditation I'm glad that I've given you\nsome hope which was not my intention and\nfor which I apologize yeah other than\nthat I don't know no okay so now the\nquestion is I feel like okay so I feel\nlike that's sort of enough but I also\nfeel like I should give you the first\nstep in the meditation practice for how\nyou discover whether you deserve to be\nhere okay\nso I have a good answer I have the\ntechnique that I think you eventually\nneed I just don't know if you're ready\nfor it and I think the technique what\nyou need so I very rarely feel this way\nbut sometimes I'm inspired to give\nsomeone a mantra but a mantra or mantra\nis something that's usually given in a\nvery specific way and I feel like I know\nthat so sometimes when I work with\npeople I feel this inner sort of\ninspiration that this mantra is going to\nhelp this person I just don't know if\nyou're ready for it yet so let me just\nthink about this and let me think about\nthe prospect of giving a month over the\nInternet and giving it to people who are\nnot ready for you I just have to think\nthrough this because I thought that\nholds it huh\nis it cuz if not enough meditation\nexperience or what is it that is holding\nthat back I don't know if you're capable\nof understanding the month right yet\nbecause I just don't know where you are\nspiritually but there's a part of me\nthat says that you're ready for it and\njust go for it\nbut how if you just think about whether\nI can come up with something else that\nis will do the trick\nhold on I'm going to get a minute okay\nyeah no where's\n[Music]\nyou\n[Music]\nokay we'll try this I'm not gonna I'm\ngonna ask you a couple questions then\nwe'll just see where this I don't know\nwhere this so I'm giving you okay so if\nif we ever you know if we ever had that\nhave the opportunity to meet in person\nWilliam I'm gonna teach you a month or\nup on that day but we never meet that\nthen someone else will show up and\nthey'll teach you what you need to know\nso I want you to sit up straight you're\ntall right\ndad no no no you're not they would talk\nno whatever\nokay so just sit okay so sit up straight\nround out your shoulders pull them back\na little bit go okay close your eyes and\nI want you to feel your hands just feel\nthe presence of your hands\nI'm gonna ask you a couple of questions\nokay so now hold one of your hands up in\nfront of your face and look at it just\nlook at it for a second okay\nsee that I'm gonna ask you a question is\nthat you hmm what do you think yeah I\nmean it's a container for me yeah it's a\ncontainer of you yes but it's not you\nhmm all right so put your hand down\nclose your eyes so now let me ask you\nsomething if I have a container that has\nlet's say I have a box and in the box is\nbread is the box the same thing as the\nbread no okay so now I'll ask you again\nor let's just reflect for a moment so\nfeel your hands\nand and don't touch your hands just keep\nthem palm face up in your lap so like\nkind of like like this people watching\nright so just keep them palm face off\nokay or what you can do is lay your\nright palm on top of your left thumb\nactually do this lay your right palm on\ntop of your left palm and sort of make\nlike sort of like a circle and let it\nsit in your lap let your hands rest in\nyour lap and I want you to ask yourself\nthe question are these are my hands me\nactually separate your hands place them\non your lap and then ask yourself is\nthis me like are you your hands what do\nyou think\nI mean I would say no okay so then guys\nclose good yeah now put your hands\ntogether your right hand on top of your\nleft hand\nlet your thumbs touch so you're doing\nthis yeah\nokay so you're you're you're basically\ndoing this yeah okay so now I'm gonna\nhave some kind of a weird question\nabsolutely a leading question so don't\nget led just really pay attention to\nyourself when your hands are together\nand you form that circuit do you feel\nlike they're more of you yes nice\n[ __ ] weird right yeah I mean I like\nit's I think it's the posture with the\narms that does it a lot and like I'm\nlying myself yeah yeah absolutely so now\nlike now here's your question okay so\nwhat the [ __ ] is that\nlike that's just [ __ ] weird\nnow is your sense of your body being\ncloser to you have anything to do with\nthe position of your hands I mean it\nfelt like I just took more space and\nyeah you're you're right it's just weird\nright like it's weird so now here's the\nquestion\nso now close your eyes hands part feel\nthe disconnection of you feel that you\nare not your hands okay and now I want\nto so now bring your hand up in front of\nyou look at it and look at it now is the\nhand that you see or you or less you or\nthe same amount of you is when you are\nclosing your eyes and your two hands are\nin your lap\num maybe even less yeah it's [ __ ]\nweird none\nso I'd answer but like you're going on\nyou're feeling right you're not telling\nme what I want to hear maybe you know I\nwas trying to feel what I felt on the\nother arm like I was comparing what I\nsaw and I was comparing what I I still\nhad my other arm on the lap so I was\nreferring to those points yeah that's\nBrooke that's good good innovation ok ok\nso like now I'm gonna ask you question\nso now we're gonna reflect okay so like\nwe'll be feeling closer to and further\naway from what's that because you've got\na sense of something right it's like\nfurthest here yeah closer in your lap\nand even closer when they're together\nyeah it's a point we had posture as well\nyep but worry what is the thing that you\nare getting closer to when you do these\n3 things like myself if I can explain it\nyeah so what is that yeah it's you're\nnot supposed to answer you're not\nsupposed to answer so now William we so\nthe first meditative practice is that I\nwant you to become familiar with this\nthing so do this practice so you can\nlook at your and you're already doing it\nright because it's good that you're\nmaking a comparison so you know you can\nlook at your hand\nor you can look at your face in the\nmirror and then you can close your eyes\nand then try to just I don't know how\nelse to put this\nbut like move on so there's there's like\nI want you to imagine a road where like\nthe regular world is over here in that\nsense of Eunice's over here I want you\nto don't even necessarily try to you\nknow find what is over here just learn\nhow to move back and forth between them\nright so there's this there's this and\nthere's this so you can do and you can\ndo it by looking at yourself in the\nmirror you can close your eyes in front\nof a mirror and just kind of be in front\nof it and then you can do this and sit\nup straight and then feel that closeness\nto you what when you say learn you mean\nlearn to have this feeling without doing\nthat nor I'm saying that just become\nfamiliar with the weird idea that you\ncan come closer\njust move further and closer away from\nyourself and get familiar with that room\nokay okay and now I'm gonna ask you so\nnow sit up straight\nyeah can you sit with your legs crossed\num they are yeah oh they are oh oh but\nyeah sorry like like this yes thanks\nyeah now next next thing is can you put\nyour right heel on top of your left\nthigh\ncan you sit like this or if you can't do\nthat from a flexibility standpoint don't\nworry I can okay now grab your other leg\ndown right oh okay okay yeah don't worry\nyeah so now I want you to sit like this\nokay also the thumb touching each area\nyeah yeah and now so relax and now feel\ndo you feel closer to yourself again\nyeah it feels like it feels like another\npart is attached thank you it's more in\nthe below as well yeah yeah good yep\nokay so now I'm going to ask you\nquestion William does this person does\nwhat you feel deserve to be okay\nyou\nI don't know her yes that's the right is\nokay so now this is your practice okay\nso you can just sit with this person\nthat you are and you're right that it\nfeels more attached it's cool but I\nthink you're doing it right so if you\nguys are wondering how the Yogi's came\nup with the yoga postures this is how\nthey did it this is where would that us\ncome from it's because they're able to\ndetect certain things about the self for\nlack of a better term that facilitates\nconnection to the self\nthat's why meditative postures this is\nthe posture by the way that Buddha and\nShiva she was you know she was well\nliked he's like one of the Hindu gods so\nShiva and Buddha use this posture this\nthis it's called buyer of a mudra which\nmeans fierce or terrifying this is\nactually what this would theorize means\nand that's the translation by Adama so\nit's it's a it's a mudra of intensity\nbecause it brings you very intensely to\nyourself and it's also kind of like\nsevere and it can be scary and\nterrifying but yeah you're okay if\nyou're feeling more attached that's good\nyou're doing it right so you just to\nplay around with this man that's all you\ngot to do and try to find out just try\nto get get man Gow you don't even have\nto find out who you are or anything like\nthat occasionally I want you to ask the\nquestion about whether this person\ndeserves to be here but you don't after\nyou're not necessarily looking for an\nanswer I don't want you to figure out\nwho you are any [ __ ] you know yoga\ncalendar spiritual stuff don't worry\nabout any of that I just want you to\nhang out with that dude yeah for a while\ndo the practice I would say if you want\nto sit if you can sit for like you know\nI tell people to start with three to\nfive minutes and you've done a\nremarkable amount of connection in like\nless than 60 seconds so the quality of\nmeditation is more important than the\nquantity of time that you meditate the\nreason that quantity of time is\nimportant is because you want to train\nyourself for having high quality\nmeditation on a more often basis but 60\nseconds of what you did is actually fine\nif you can get there do you know what I\nmean by\nout there yeah yeah okay so if you can\nget their grant and then ideally you\nwant to do this like 15 to 20 minutes\nlike at least three days a week ideally\neven every day or five days a week or\nsix days a week and and just hang out\nwith yourself\nand then you know one day we'll meet in\nperson I hope or someone else will meet\nand if you've been doing this practice\ndiligently I'm gonna be able to tell and\nif I can tell I'm gonna give you a\nmantra oh cool\nand I do you mean by you can tell though\nit's the same way that I because here's\nthe thing William I don't know if you've\ndone this notice this before but\nsometimes I teach people to meditate and\nthey have these weird experiences and\nthen everyone at home is like I don't\nknow what the [ __ ] this guy is talking\nabout so like I don't know how I know\nhow to ask you questions and teach you\npractices that are gonna help you\nunderstand something about yourself but\nI just know and sometimes based on the\nway that you answer me I can tell that\nyou're doing it right or you're doing it\nwrong because what I'm asking you to do\nbecause your words cannot translate your\nexperience so when you say that like\ncrossing your legs makes you feel more\nattached I know you're doing it right I\ndon't even know what the [ __ ] that means\nbut I know it's is similar to like what\nI feel and it's the whole reason that I\nasked you to do it the reason I asked\nyou to sit that way is because I wanted\nyou to feel more attached but I didn't\nknow what to call that and that looks\nlike it's our time okay all right so any\nlast questions no I don't think so okay\nsay good luck to William you gonna say\ngood luck William no no luck for William\nokay\nsorry would ya\nall right dude seriously though thank\nyou very much for coming on you know I\nthink you can absolutely get healed\nnuttin I think I shouldn't be the one\nthanking you really um really yeah well\nI'm glad it's helpful and and you know\nit sorry for being well you're welcome\nand you know sorry for being general but\ndon't give up hope because I really\nthink you can yeah I think you can get\nthere okay yeah take care of man thanks\nokay bye bye\nokay all right so let's do okay so\nhopefully that made sense guys I don't\nknow and if for those of you that the\nmeditation didn't work don't worry about\nit we teach a lot of we teach a lot of\ndifferent things\nokay so um I just want to go ahead and\nyeah so can I say can you get going now\ncan I finish talking no it's really\ndistracting I'm having trouble getting\nmy groove can't give me some space\nNo okay I don't even know if you\nunderstand what I'm doing but okay you\nwant to set my lap that's fine\ncan I have a kiss\nNo okay alright so let me just\n[Music]\nall right so guys let me explain\nsomething to y'all okay so that you know\nwhat when you guys like when we were\ndoing fundraising like part of what we\nwant to do is map outs in the disciplic\nbunch course your theory for you guys so\nthat you can make it more accessible\nwhat are you doing\nI can't I'm trying to wrap up with them\nand I've got a feel and have to collect\nmy thoughts and if you're threatening me\nwith your tongue in your finger then I\ncan't do that\ngo get out of here no no I think she\nunderstands that you guys are watching\nokay okay so um yeah so French coursethe\near is very very helpful and I highly\nhighly you know I don't know how you\nguys would be able to do that but you\nknow it's something that we want to\nteach a little bit more comprehensively\nit's really hard to just like sit and\nlecture about it it you're just so we're\nworking on how to make that information\nmore accessible to you guys a couple of\nother things so you know we've got I\nthink we're still figuring out what\nwe're doing on Wednesday\nwe've got JD and on Friday on Wednesday\nour coaching platform launches so thank\nyou very much for all of your
