which we're going\nto talk about in just a couple of\nseconds is like I'll lay it out for you\nguys what the you know what what we're\ngoing to do and what our plan is um so\nmoney raise past 75,000 is going to be\nlike subsidizing our coaching program\nfor people who can't afford it and also\nseed money for the healthy game\nscholarship which comes to our 100K\nMilestone so Gabe do it for Gabe do it\nfor Gabe um 100K Milestone is uh a\nscholarship and then also because you\nguys need to be entertained and your\nappetites are are are are great what\nwe're going to do um\nis dank Moses has offered himself up to\nto go on a virtual date during covid\nwhich we will do play-by-play commentary\nof in 100 G okay and this is the thing\nis like Moses cuz like Moses likes to\nput me on the spot and have me do things\nfor you guys but he didn't think that we\nbecause he was like yeah I'll I'll do\nthat at 100K and we were like 50k back\nthen right so I don't think he thought\nthat we would get it and it's fine if we\ndon't no big deal because you guys have\ngiven us plenty so I I'm grateful for\nthat and also if you guys want to I kind\nof want to do that because that'll be\nfun and then Moses will will learn what\nit's\nlike to D da on command yeah so we'll\nsee also because you know we should help\nhim find love twit chat Let's Do It um\nso uh our so platform so our coaching\nprogram like so I know we ask for money\nfor support but I I want you guys to\nunderstand this we started working on\nthis back in October or November and\nwe've just basically been trying to do\nit ourselves so it's been really awesome\nto have support because support buys us\na lot of stuff and so our our coaching\nprogram is actually set to go live on\nJune 3 um we wanted to launch it in may\nwe originally wanted to launch it in the\nmiddle of May but I don't know if you\nguys know this but launching real things\nactually takes like effort difficulty\nand accountants and lawyers and like\ntaxes yep and like what do we do like\nhow do we like is it legal to offer\ncoaching in New Zealand because that's\nwhere some of twitch comes from and so\nwe had to sort out all that kind of crap\nI think it's all sorted\nhopefully um and so I want to show you\nguys something real quick okay so\nhere we go let me do this\nquick okay so this is what our roll out\nlooks like so like I know that you guys\ndonated to support our coaching program\nand we're grateful for that but like\nwhat you guys donate for is actually\nready to launch and and we're going to\nlaunch it in a week okay so week one we\nhave 36 spots open for individual\ncoaching and nine spots open for group\ncoaching\nup to eight people up to so nine groups\nwith up to eight people per group okay\nso what that means is that at the our\ngoal is by June 10th to actually be\ndelivering coaching Services to8 people\nand I know it sounds I don't know if\nthat number sounds big to you guys or\nsmall to you guys but seeing as how we\ndid fundraising for something I think\nit's pretty cool that we're actually\nhopefully offering like we're going to\nstart actually helping people like in a\nweek um so then and cuz have to do like\nstress test it right because we built\nlike this platform and stuff um and so\nthen at the end of week two we're\nopening up 36 more individual slot or at\nthe beginning of week two 36 more\nindividual slots and nine more groups to\nhopefully help 216 people week\nthree we're going to open up 35 more\nspots and nine more groups for 323\npeople and then week four our group\nstuff is going to be tapped out because\nwe don't have the supply of coaches to\ndo more of\nthat and so we're going to open up 57\nmore individual spots and this is what\nwe hope to do so this is this is what I\nwant to say your donations it is my\nsincere hope that one month from now\nwill actually support the platform\ninfrastructure and stuff like that to\nactually help 380 people from our\ncommunity that is really what we hope to\ndo one month from now and we'll have the\nnext group of um coaches and training by\nthat yeah so we we're reviewing\napplications so if you guys have signed\nup to be coaches we're thrilled um we've\ngotten hundreds of applications and\nwe're going through those and trying to\nfind people that we think would be a\nreally good fit for our community um and\nuh yeah so so like that's the thing is\nlike right now we've got a limited\nnumber of coaches and and really what\nthe fundraising is for is to help us\nkind of iron out these things and then\nalso to like train future coaches cuz\ntraining them is a big investment just\nso you guys know these coaches that\nwe're launching with we started training\nthem in November of 2019 so they've been\nin training now for like seven months\nand they're phenomenal we've been\nworking together every week um for it\nlike an hour and a half at a minimum and\nthey've been seeing clients in our beta\nand they've been helping clients and I\nthink we've showed you that data before\num so this is like we're going to do it\nlike it's like it's right around the\ncorner and so hopefully nothing falls\napart fingers crossed to a chat you know\nthose you know those the the internet\ngods that like tank our Discord and our\nstream at times like hopefully they're\njust okay with this stuff why tempt\nthings no I mean I I'm not tempting it's\nnot tempting it's it's throwing myself\nupon the mercy of the internet Gods okay\nso a couple of things to note about this\nokay so if there's no so when we launch\nour coaching program if you like sign up\nand there's no slots we don't have the\ninfrastructure yet to like properly\nweight list people so just check back in\na week right like I know that that's not\nhow professional companies run but like\njust check back because we you know we\nhave to build this well yeah yeah yeah\nthere's going to be some kind of weight\nlist but like just check back and we're\ngoing to post updates on Twitter and\nDiscord we'll try to also update our\ndevlog from time to time so that people\ncan know what we're up\nto um and so the next thing that I want\nto talk about for a minute is like so\npeople may be wondering okay what about\nlike individual coaching or group\ncoaching um and and like you know what's\nthe difference so so let me just tell\nyou guys okay so the first thing is that\nour goal is AOE healing right so if we\nhave um you know a dozen coaches to help\nyou guys if we think about it like if\nthey work one-on-one with you guys they\ncan only work with a certain number of\nclients and so the first reason to do\ngroup coaching is because we can\nactually help more people than\nindividual coaching so then the next\nquestion becomes is individual coaching\nworth as much as group coaching or can\nyou benefit because if you have\nindividual is that better than group and\nthe short answer is like somewhat so\nhere are the advantages of individual\ncoaching so you get one person who you\nmeet on a weekly basis who helps you\napply and Implement what we teach on\nstream so this is not like educational\nstuff like if you guys watch stuff and\nyou like learn about meditation or you\nlearn about emotions or you learn about\nAlexia or you learn about addiction or\nlike I have the sucar like you guys know\na lot of the stuff so the role of the\ncoach is to actually support your\nlearning and individually help you\nproblem solve and Implement things over\ntime and the way that I explain it is\nlike you're going to learn something\nlike okay like I I figured out oh I'm\nI'm I'm Lexy which means I don't\nunderstand my internal emotional state\nand then you're going to try to go do\nsomething in the real world and you're\ngoing to try to figure out lexyy on your\nown and then you're going to fail and\nthe role of the coach is to help you get\nback up when you fail and get you to try\nagain because here's the thing about the\nGaming Community like I don't think you\nguys I think you all underestimate what\nyou're capable of gamers can do anything\nonce you can work out for a day you can\nwork out for a week right you can even\nwork out for a month the problem is that\nwhen you stop working out after two\nweeks of working out you never start\nworking out\nagain right can you stop that that's\nvery distractive I'm trying to like\nGroove go ahead and be okay right so\nlike when I really think about it the\nreal point of of like the coaching\nprogram is like because I I think the\npro it's not that you guys are lazy it's\nthat like\nwhen you start to\nimprove something gets in the way and\nthen you lose all confidence in yourself\nand you don't even try again like that's\nwhat I want coaching to help you through\nright just get through that bump and get\nyou back to trying again because here's\nthe crazy thing you guys do try again\neventually so what we really want to do\nis shorten the amount of time to like\ntrying again that's what we're really\nfor um and so they're going to teach you\nlots of stuff they'll work with you\nthings like that um so that's what\nindividual coaching is about now here's\nthe reason so getting one-on-one time\nwith someone is actually really valuable\nand it's like dedicated it's your time\nyou can talk about you know whatever is\ngoing on um just a reminder it's not\nlike mental health treatment so it's not\ndesigned to diagnose or treat a medical\ncondition and we're trying to train our\ncoaches to understand when there could\nbe a psychiatric problem going on and\nthen they'll try to support you and\nfinding the appropriate help\nthere so why group coaching so the\nreason for group coaching is because I\nthink that like when you get a group of\npeople who struggle through something\ntogether they can actually learn in a\nsense faster than oneon-one so when we\nteach\npeople um you know like let's say like\npeople are talking about procrastination\nyou can work one-on-one with your coach\nand like work on procrastination but\nwhen it's a group of you who are all\nworking on procrastination together you\ndon't need to find the whole solution\nwith your coach you bring a piece of the\npuzzle someone else brings a piece of\nthe puzzle a third person brings a piece\nof the puzzle and then you guys like\nwork through it kind of together and\nthere's sort of like a party XP bonus\nthat comes with group coaching so group\ncoaching is also really really effective\num I've been running groups now for a\ncouple of years and like I it's\ninteresting there was a group that I was\nrunning actually literally yesterday and\nI actually asked them the\nquestion if you think about it would do\nyou guys think you would have gained\nwe're on like week 10 or 11 of of the\ngroup and I asked them\nif do you think that you've gained more\nfrom this group or you would have gained\nmore if you had 10 weeks of working with\nme oneon-one\nand the answer was awesome the answer\nwas I'm not\nsure and that's enough of an answer for\nme right like because I think the main\nthing about the groups is like you guys\nare going to learn from each other and\nthat's like very very valuable like and\nI just can't o overestimate that so I I\ndon't think that group coaching or\nindividual Co coaching is better or\nworse than something\nelse um I think it's it's just like\nthere are different services and they're\nlike different kinds of things it's like\nyou know is a multiplayer game better\nthan a single player game well like no\nit's just like they're going to be\nbetter at different things what there is\nsome evidence though for um like what we\ndid was we looked at like the AA model\nfor example and to see what the impact\nis of having a\nsponsor on people's lives versus the\nimpact of having like the support group\nand they have different impacts and they\ndifferent kind of suitability for\ndifferent people but in general the\nshared lived experience of somebody\nthat's gone through it with you the\nsupport of that person that has gone\nthrough a video game addiction or has\nalso had to kind of put their life\ntogether through these kinds of\ncircumstances that are very pervasive\nwithin the kind of demographic that\nyou're in um means so much so if you're\nsomebody that really wants want to like\nwork one onone maybe um your life like\nyou're not comfortable with like a more\npeople maybe individual coaching is for\nyou if you're somebody who really\nbenefits from lots of ideas and lots of\ninput lots of support and you know\nyou're going to have eight new people\nrooting for you if that is something\nthat's really important for you group\ncoaching could be great for you the\nother thing about group coaching so I I\ncan't underestimate this point so the\nother big difference about group\ncoaching is that in group coaching you\nget to help someone else that is huge\nright cuz like even individual coaching\nsometimes people will drop out if\nthey're feeling depressed or sad or they\ndon't feel like they're worth it right\nbecause sometimes when you guys start to\nmove forward in life all these thoughts\ncreep up and they say oh you're never\ngoing to amount to anything you're\nwasting other people's time all this\nkind of stuff the cool thing about group\ncoaching is you can't drop out of\nsomething if some other people are\ndepending on you cannot you cannot drop\nout of group coaching please God we\nhaven't built it for lots of\ncancellations it's very complicated\nplease don't drop out of group coaching\nmake the commitment to yourself make the\ncommitment to your coach make the\ncommitment to your group that you're\ngoing to show up and be there yeah so\ngroup coaching is great cuz like you get\nto help other people and then you get to\nfeel good about yourself cuz like when\nsomeone tells you hey man I was really\nstruggling with this and what you said\nactually really helped me like that's\nincredibly powerful for them and for you\num and then a crazy thing happens after\ngroup coaching people start to develop\nvalue in who they are it's crazy and you\nknow I'd love to do that and be able to\nshow it but um okay going live next week\nyou guys we're really really excited and\nagain thank you so much for funding the\nplatform we've actually already spent\nhalf of that and we're just hoping that\nyou know we could make some of that back\nso we don't go in the hole later but\nthank you for your support um group\ncoaching huh okay it is distracting your\nright um so thanks for your support and\nthen also we're really excited to be\nable to offer these sessions at such a\nlow price\num you guys are the best okay so next\nthing is um so the if you guys are just\ncurious so we're hoping to train the\nnext coaches at an accelerated rate and\nand I'm going to be training them\nhopefully on a daily or like multiple\ntimes a week basis and so we hope to\nhave our next batch of coaches out like\nprobably within three months at the\nearliest and I know that we may you know\nmore people may want coaching but like\nwe're really committed to like high\nquality coaches and sometimes that takes\ntime and a big part of our our training\nis that so what we basically do is we\nhave coaches go through like an\neducational portion where I teach them\ncertain skills and how to talk to people\nand we explain like principles around\nGamers and stuff like that they\nbasically like are sitting in class with\nme and then we also go through a\nsupervised coaching portion where they\nactually work with CLI cents and then\nlike every week we talk about their\nclient talk about their sessions and we\nsort of do like a play byplay It's\nalmost like replay analysis of their\ncoaching sessions and like currently I'm\ndoing all of that personally so they get\nlike you know I work with all of the\ncoaches to like you know help them\nbecome effective over a period of a\nminimum of two months of like supervised\ncoaching and the coaches themselves are\nin this group they learn from each other\nit's just a really cool yeah thing do\nyou want to talk a little bit about what\nmakes a good coach I see people that are\ninterested in becoming a\ncoach\num yeah so I think the most important\nthing for being a good coach is first of\nall you have to have been through it\nright like you have to know like I think\nthe reason that our coaches do a good\njob is because they know what it's like\nto be in your\nshoes uh the second thing is that you\ncan't be at the bottom of your Barrel to\nbe a good coach right so like the\ncoaches that we're looking for people\nwho have like started to put their lives\ntogether and can keep a schedule and\nshow up every week right because like\nwe're investing a lot of time and energy\nin teaching these people stuff so you\nknow like we want them to show up every\nweek and then the other thing is that\nlike a coach has to like once you have a\ncommitment to a client you have to show\nup every week so you know you have to\nhave some of your [ __ ] together\nbasically and then also like not have\nhad your [ __ ] together in the past is\nbasically what we're looking for right\num and then I mean I think honestly\nthose are the two most important things\nlike there's no particular degree like\nyou don't have to have you know like I\nmean we get a lot of people who are\ninterested in becoming psychotherapists\nor are psychotherapists or have formal\nMental Health Training we get a lot of\npeople who are like you know graphic\ndesigners and they just want to help and\nthey're inspired by our mission they've\nalways wanted to help people and like\nthey just couldn't spend six years\ngetting a PhD so like that's fine too Y\nand and I think the whole point of the\ntraining is that we teach people a core\nset of skills that I don't think are\nspecific to a therapist like they're\nlike human skills right that's what we\ndo at healthy Gamers like we teach like\nhow does concentration work how does\nemotion work like how does all this\nstuff work and these are common\nexperiences for all humans and and\nreally it's just like you have to be\ncommitted to our mission it helps if\nyou've you know been on The Struggle Bus\nyourself and it's like actually kind of\nimportant that you sort of have your\n[ __ ] together because people are depend\nare gonna be counting on you yeah um and\ncannot you can't let people down that's\nthat's a no no the other thing I would\nsay is I've seen just this like kind of\nalmost Indescribable motivation of\nservice and like wanting to be of\nservice to others wanting to help people\nthat's what that makes a really great\ncoach I think um yeah yeah and also you\nknow I I mean we pay our coaches yes so\nlike that's a big part of this too so\npart of the reason in my experience that\nwe pay\npeople dodged astrology PhD thanks for\nthe gifted Subs um that's pretty awesome\nthough astrology PhD can you actually\nget that that's pretty sick uh so the\nthe reason that we pay our coaches is\nbecause I've noticed in my personal\npractice that when I see clients for\nfree and when stuff is done for free or\nwhen people volunteer their time they\ndon't feel beholden to provide a high\nquality service over an extended period\nof time like if someone is volunteering\ntheir time they can be committed but\nlike on a given day they're going to\nwake up and they're going to be like\nwell I don't feel like doing this today\nand\nthen you know I'd say at least 50% of\nvolunteers offer less service than like\npeople who get paid and then the other\ncool thing that we're trying to do is\nlike you know pay people so that if\nyou're a gamer and you're committed to\nhelping other people and you like can't\nyou know you can earn money um so you\nknow we're you know it's and this is\nalso why we charge clients by the way so\nwe're trying to create other avenues to\nmake Co free but we'll charge you know\nas low of a price as we can and we want\nto pay coaches as high of a fee as we\ncan um because we want the best coaches\nand we want the most clients and we want\nto help the most people that's really\nthe goal and I don't think I so I've\nworked in institutions that are based on\nphilanthropic funding and I think they\nvery very quickly lose sight of their\nlike actual work right so like if you're\ndependent on donations then like you\ncan't reliably deliver a service because\nthe donations dry up then like you're\nout of business right and and we really\nvery much appreciate all of the\nfundraising support and donations but we\nalso don't want to be like and this is\nwhat I'm saying like we started building\nthis in November because we never wanted\nto be dependent on anyone's outside dime\nright and the fact that you guys are\nsupporting us are like is awesome and we\nlove it but this just I mean it's\nawesome but like there's a like we're\nnot we didn't start this a month ago\nwhen we started fundraising we're\nlaunching in a week because we started\nbuilding it six months ago you already\nspent that money\nyeah it's just you\nknow okay so um a couple of thanks so\nthank you guys for everyone who's uh um\nyou know gifted subs and so big

can't can't offer\nthat all right\nBachelorette dude like the E\nBachelorette yeah or Bachelor\nsorry yeah okay\nBachelor healthy Bachelor no but if if\nwe want to do healthy Bachelor then we\nhave to offer like relationship\ncounseling okay that's your job you know\nit's interesting so I once I've worked\nwith one couple that went to a marriage\ncounselor or relationship counselor to\nnot end up in a relationship it's really\nfascinating story so like two people\nwere super into each other and it had\nfelt deeply in love but recognize that\nthey're terrible for each other so they\nactually went and got a marriage\ncounselor to help them not be together\nit's the weirdest thing I've ever\nheard okay so POG you easy Dodge maybe\nthey just oh\nzil wow gifted Subs bro thank you you\nguys thank thank you yeah thank you guys\nvery much okay can we um answer\nquestions now yeah so quickly um I've\nhave about a 10year career working in\nvarious media and Tech startups just\ncompleted an MBA started this company Dr\nk um is almost like the extreme opposite\nwhere\nhe\nhe didn't have great grades took a\nlittle while to get into Medical School\nfinally got us act together landed at\ntop residency is now a faculty at\nHarvard Medical School also started this\ncompany um just so you have a little\nbackground on our career he's an MD mph\nand I'm an\nMBA okay so let's start at the top all\nright you guys ready for question\none no guys look\nso I appreciate the distractions we of\ncourse appreciate the donations but\nlet's remember I\nmean some people are going to shoot me\nfor saying this but like let's remember\nthat we're here to answer questions\nright so we will take a brief break from\nthanking everyone while we actually\nanswer questions which is what you know\npeople I think are supporting um\nokay so how do I know the career I'm\ngoing to college for will ultimately\nmake me happy at it I'm going to be a\nseconde computer science\nstudent you have no\nidea I think you should count\non your college degree being like a\nsecond Ary or tertiary thing think about\nexperience think about what you want to\ndo and then you're you're going to learn\nbasically in two ways you're going to\nlearn from experience and you're going\nto learn from the\nclassroom experience is way way way more\nvaluable we just crost 100K no way oh my\nGod all right Gabe I hope you're happy\npay for gab's\ncollege all right\nGabe that's remember you still have to\napply for a FF though bro yeah\nseriously we said you know if you can't\nwe said that if you can't afford to go\nto college we'll cover you but you know\nwhat I've been thinking about quickly\nkind of related to this question but I\nfeel like student loans in general is\nsuch a broken way for people to get kind\nof that early start because what it's\nsupposed to help you with right is to\nkind of invest in yourself and set you\nup for a career but I wonder if there\ncould be instead of like student loans\nlike life loans like maybe College isn't\nit but here's 20 grand a year for four\nyears for you to just figure it out\nabsolutely I would love to see something\nlike that happen I would I think I think\nit would be awesome if we lived in a\nworld where you could give an\n18-year-old 20 grand that they could\nspend on\nSteam because that's what they're going\nto do man just give them a pile of cash\nit's a loan\nright yeah but like 20 grand in my bank\naccount is 20 grand in my bank account\nright and then that interest\nrate that interest rate is something\nthat I can use all my games to play to\nignore okay well I think it would be a\ncool idea I think it would be a cool\nidea too sorry for being cynical because\nit's I mean like college like speaking\nof things that are broken right like we\nknow Healthcare is broken but college is\nbroken too well so I think the problem\nthat happened with college is when\neveryone could got a guaranteed loan to\ngo to college colleges realized that\nthere's no reason to keep the cost of\ncollege load right right so like\neveryone was told you have to get a\ncollege degree and then you'll be happy\nin life and we're going to get to that\nquestion in a second and you'll be\nsuccessful in life and so if you look at\nCollege tuition the reason that it's\nballooned is because there's no price\npressure to keep it down so like college\nadministrative fees are like 400% of\nwhat they were like 30 years ago and\nadministrative fees by the way includes\nthings like salaries for people who are\nlike deans of colleges and so there's\nlike no price pressure so then what\nhappens is like they can charge $70\n$70,000 a year for like you know\nteaching you Spanish one in one\nbasically what happened with Healthcare\nright you had like a trapped pool of\npeople that you know they have insurance\ndon't don't get me started on healthare\nbecause I'll go on a rant that is not\nthe purpose of why we're here but if you\nguys want to understand why the Health\nCare system is broken I will bust out\nthe iPad and I will draw you guys a\ndiagram of why the healthcare system is\nbroken let's do that at the end but\nbasically for your college degree I\nthink think you cannot count on your\nmajor to be first of all what lands you\nthe job or gives you the experience you\nneed okay they want to do it can you go\ngrab where's the I'll teach you guys why\nHealthcare is broken I'm gonna answer\nthe question I think I the kids were\nusing okay so how do I know the career\nI'm going to for college will ultimately\nmake me happy I'm going to be a\nsecond-year computer science student so\nhere's the first question that boggles\nmy [ __ ] mind okay\nwhere did we get the idea that happiness\ncomes from a\ncareer like just think about that right\nthere are people out there like not just\npeople most people think that the key to\nhappiness in life is a particular career\nit's like what the [ __ ] that's what\n[ __ ] our priorities from day one the\nidea that a career will make you happy\nlike you're screwed then and\nthere forget about computer science or\nanything else like we're we're in a\nsociety where we presume that a\nparticular career is going to make us\nhappy and it's\nlike wait hold on a\nsecond right so the other thing that\nthat we also did very subtly is we said\njust think about okay just run with me\nokay twitch so I'm a fan of capitalism\nso like don't pin me don't Peg me as a\nsocialist like just listen to what I'm\nsaying before you lump me into a\nbucket what I'm saying is\num okay so somewhere along the way like\nI I just really want you guys to pause\nand think about this we grew up with\nthis idea that you have a job and your\njob earns money and then like you go\nhome after your job and then you do fun\nstuff like we're taught this basic\nParadigm that there's like work and\nthere's enjoyment there're like work\ndays and they're\nweekends I don't accept that premise for\na moment and I don't believe that your\ncareer has to make you happy here's what\nI believe and I know it's going to sound\nreally crazy and it's actually kind of\ncapitalistic so you know if you're a\nsocialist you're going to hate me and if\nyou're a capitalist you're going to hate\nme because I bizarre I think that\nthey're attributes of both things which\nyou're good I know it's like\nmindboggling so here's what I believe I\nbelieve that if you do something that\nyou love you're going to perform at a\nhigher level than if you do something\nthat you don't love and I think that the\nmarket\nvalues things that are done at the\nhighest\nlevel and so I actually think the best\nway to become successful and offer value\nto the rest of the world is to get\nreally really good at like something\nthat you love right and and before you\nguys say that's weird like think about\nlike why is twitch a thing like why does\ntwitch even exist it's because someone\nrealized like oh I actually really like\nplaying video games and that's human\nbeings value that and like so we're\ngoing to like make a platform where\npeople can stream video games and like\nnow it's a gigantic\nthing so like I don't accept that your\njob has to be something that it like you\nsacrifice for your job and then you you\nkind of like go home and then you have\nfun afterward like I think the goal is\nto like find something and there's like\na ven diagram okay so there's this\num there's this like it's not like you\ncan do anything so I think that there's\nlike overlap between like if you you\ntake the Dozen things you love because I\nthink you love more than one thing and\nthen you like think about what offers\nvalue to the rest of the world and\nthat's where you put your money into\nthat's what healthy gamer is about like\nI don't I don't know if you guys\nrecognize this okay so I'm a\npsychiatrist that's a job that the\nmarket offers a particular value for\nright like I trained and I offer a\nservice and I charge a fee for that\nservice and then I had a grand\nexperiment and the grand experiment was\nlike even though this is not a thing\nwhere you can make money I feel in my\nheart of hearts that I should not just\nhelp people who are investment bankers\nnothing against investment\nbankers or people who have substance use\naddictions right so I help like Heron\naddicts or people with schizophrenia I\nwant to help people who are Gamers and\nthat's what I want to do there's no\nmarket for it there's no diagnosis for\nit insurance doesn't pay you anything\nHospital doesn't pay you anything my\nboss doesn't pay me anything I said I'm\ngoing to start streaming on\nTwitch and the reason I believe I\nbelieve what I believe is because hey\nguys we've raised $100,000\nand like how did that happen there's no\nmarket for this what is the\nmarket like it's not a job like what am\nI a twitch streamer like not really am I\na doctor like not really like I'm not\nlike a\nstreamer right so like the the main\nthing here is that like figure out what\nyou love that helps other people and\nmakes the world a better place and then\ngive it your all be really good at\nsomething yeah and I think not only will\nyou be\nsuccessful you will be happy but that's\nnot a career it's like a Dharma right\nand so then now the question is how do I\nfigure out my Dharma well we go there I\nthink it's also a matter of patience\nright you you've put in what five six\nyears into finding this space in the\nworld I mean so like when I was training\nto become a psychiatrist I started\nasking people like what do you guys\nthink about video game addiction and no\none understood what the [ __ ] I was\ntalking about or what they were talking\nabout right one lady who's a brilliant\npsycho analyst told me I think the\nreason that people get addicted to video\ngames is the same reason they get\ntattoos and I was like lady what are you\ntalking about like those are not related\nat all and anyway I I so so here I think\nmaybe what Cy's point is then so that\nyour question is like how do I find what\nI love and how do I find what has value\nto the world and cruy spot on that it\ntakes patience like my journey started\n16 years ago so it takes time to figure\nit out right and I had a career along\nthe\nway like I had\ncareer you know which I'm sort of\nshutting down by the way FYI so we're\ngonna spend more time on healthy gamer\nbecause this is a thing\nnow um okay so like I feel like people\nare past the healthcare thing so do do I\nneed to do that or are we done let's get\nback to it let's stick to Career that's\nwhat we said we're going to do\nokay B bonus Healthcare\nrant okay go back to RIT go back to\nReddit no but they're saying do it do it\nplease everyone's saying do\nit stick to Career mes can Paul see we\ncan do this now because you guys have\nsupported Boomer Dr K because Boomer Dr\nK doesn't know how to do these\nthings healthare\nDLC okay legendary pancake oh my gosh\nthe last\nword I I don't know how to see the poll\nusually they can see the poll but let's\ndo another question while we're waiting\nokay so the short answer is um how do I\nknow that a career I'm going to for\ncollege will ultimately make me happy it\nwon't and you shouldn't think that a\nparticular career will make you happy\ndon't plan on that at all so so I think\nyou should try to find something that\nyou're interested in and curious about\nand offer some value to the world and\nthen finding happiness is like I know\nsounds cheesy but comes from within\nright like so so you know you can find\nlike a a a a degree in computer science\nis not going to make you happy the kind\nof job that you get afterward is can\nheavily influence your happiness but\nlike that's that you're not going to\nknow that from the get-go right like you\ncould end up working for let's say Trip\nAdvisor and like building stuff that you\nthink is cool or you could hate Trip\nAdvisor because what you really want to\ndo is make a video game\nor you can be like the people who help\nus develop our apps and and like our\ntechnology backend and like their\nprogrammers and stuff who have like a\nskill set and they're they like I think\nthey enjoy what they do because you know\nthey're a part of our mission so I hope\nthat they feel somewhat fulfilled I mean\nI'm not really sure um and so I think\nit's like an evolving process so like I\nwant you guys to step away from the idea\nthat a decision you make today is the\nright decision or is the wrong\ndecision because\nlife is like a long-term game it's not\nlike you make a decision today and then\nyou're screwed for the rest of your life\nit's Evolution right like I built a\ncareer and now I'm walking away from it\nbecause of you\n[ __ ] she is too by the way she dunked\nher career yeah she's actually\ncompletely walked away from her career\nyeah because of you [ __ ] and because\nof me [ __ ]\nactually well so here's the thing I when\nit comes to career stuff I would plan\nfor like what's the second thing always\nuse like the job that you're going to\ntake or the degree that you're going to\npick or whatever for as like a means to\nan end right because you're not really\ndoing it for that first job out of\nschool you're doing it for kind of the\nlong term so everything you do think\nabout it for the long term where you\nwant to be years out from now and it\ndoesn't have to be a super crystal clear\npicture it can be a general sense of\nlike I just want to help this kind of\nperson or I just want to start this kind\nof company\num and then figure out kind of the\nskills you need and the experience you\nneed and experience is not necessarily\ndoing it well it's just giving it a\nshot yeah I mean I disagree with that a\nlittle bit because I think sometimes\nit's hard to know what the long term\nis in in the short term so I think you\nhave to take the next best\nstep right and and just\nanyway Tina Tre says 37 and still no\nclue what I should do absolutely oh wait\nare you talking about me or are you\ntalking about\nyou for a second there I I read that I\nthought you were talking about me and I\nwas like you're damn right yeah like but\nthen I realized the club\nokay Health later\nokay okay so we're going to do\nHealthcare rant later okay great okay\nall right got them okay then let me turn\nthis\non all right so next question um\nhow to choose a career when everything\ninterests you but you can't make a\ndecision for example I graduated e\neconomics High School thought it was\ninteresting right now I'm in college\nstudying occupational health and safety\nbut I'm also interested in other fields\nlike Computer Sciences and such although\nI realize choosing a career now doesn't\nhave to be F final I feel like I'm\nunfocused any tips on getting focused\nand making a\nchoice so this is a\ntrap um College like choosing kind kind\nof your trade is a trap you can combine\nall of that stuff like that sounds like\nyou might really like something like\nBusiness Development and a digital\nHealth company or something like that so\nyou can think about kind of the\necosystem you want to work in but also\nthen like what your particular skill set\ncan be to support something like that\nI'm scoot up a little\nbit well if I scoot up then when you do\nyour hand gestures you're going to just\nsmack me\nif we do that we'll get banned and then\nwe'll disappear like a puff of smoke\nwith $100,000 bye\ncalculated okay so so I I kind of agree\nwith what gruth is saying but because\nlike so I'll give you guys another\nexample um so you know myself right so I\nlike video games and I like mental\nhealth and I like helping people and I\nlike to meditate and so like instead of\nthinking about that is like choosing\nbetween those\nthings it's about like sort of putting\nthem together in some way and you don't\nknow that at the get-go right so\nbasically like when I started training\nas a psychiatrist in year two of my\nresidency I started like focusing on\nvideo games on the side because I was\ncurious about that and then I started\nworking on it like a couple hours a week\nand then it became a little bit more and\na little bit more and like five years\ndown the road I found fertile ground for\nit and you kind of combine stuff now in\nthis person's case like it's kind of\ntough right because economics\noccupational health and sa safety and\ncomputer science like it's a stret even\nfor me\nto combine those things but so simple to\nme actually how so occupational health\nand safety like I I don't know what what\nis that first of\nall it's like Occupational Health like\nhow to keep employees like safe and\nhealthy so you know like okay so that in\nTech like that makes total sense right\nyou can create technological solutions\nfor encouraging occupational health and\nsafety that is that's a market like that\nthat has real value in the world\neconomics absolutely who doesn't need\neconomics if you're building a business\nyou have to have some sense of Economics\nso so I I think the other thing to\nremember is that when you train in a\nparticular discipline it's not just\nabout the content it's about the\nskills right so like if you train in\neconomics it's not just like markets\nthat you're learning about you're\nlearning about mathematics and modeling\nso mathematics and modeling like we have\nyou know we do we do math matics and\nmodeling at healthy gamer in terms of\nlike okay economics right now in this\nenvironment where like there's just so\nmuch like the economic climate right now\nis fascinating I think anyone who cares\nabout that and can understand that is\ngoing to do really well in kind of\ncreating a new business and a new\nmarket yeah completely agree and and\njust to kind of zero in like you know so\nif you want to study computer science\nlike people are saying in chat like that\napplies to any field because that's true\nso this is where you stop and you think\na little bit like you do a little bit of\nForward Thinking and you think like okay\nwhat are the things that are the most\nwhat step is going to give me like the\nmost moves down the road so I would\nthink that like you know studying\nprogramming in some way or computer\nscience is like maybe a good idea but\nthe other cool thing about this and this\nis why I think it's sort of like a silly\nthing to restrain yourselves to\neducation is that you can learn how to\nprogram without getting a CS degree in\nfact I'm pretty sure that Google and\nMicrosoft no longer require bachelor's\ndegrees to work for them like they just\nhire people based on the skill set that\nyou have and then and then this kind of\ngoes back a couple months ago we did\nlike at the beginning of covid we did\nlike a I did a brief thing about how to\nget the job of your dreams I we can do\nthat again today if you guys want to but\nit's actually like a pretty simp it's\nnot an easy process but it's like\nactually a pretty simple process of like\nhow to get the job of your dreams and I\ncan walk you through that I've actually\ndone that with people and they're like\nthey have jobs now there's also by the\nway a couple of resources in our Discord\num if you if you want like a real kind\nof road map um make sure you join the\nDiscord Okay so we've got two dlc's\ntoday that's\nfine and what's a\nDLC what's a DLC twitch\nCH Boomer yes guilty guilty what's the\nfemale version of Boomer\nsee this is what I love about twitchchat\nwe can ask them what a DLC is you're not\neven getting an answer no just okay no\none tell her twitchchat okay we're just\ngonna keep\ngoing the opposite of a boomer is Ken no\ndude dude a Karen is so\ndifferent\nokay so um so I but this is a really\ngood problem to have to choose a career\nwhen everything interests you like my my\nbaby sister for example she\nwas debating between whether she wanted\nto be an astrophysicist and like do like\na math major and go on that side or if\nshe wanted to go to film school and she\ndecided to pick Film School um because\nthen she could make movies about\nspace what she's\ndoing um okay so I'd say you know just\nthink a little bit about like which of\nthese which what content interests you\nthe most and then you can also do like a\ncalculation about like you know what's\nyour starting salary going to be if you\npick one of these disciplines and then\njust take the next step forward and then\nyou can kind of you know you can work\nthrough it\nlater\num how do you find a solid group of\nfriends good question and how do you\nmove from friends to close friends I\nfind it hard to connect with others\nsince I don't feel like I click or\nrelate to them as well but I'm not sure\nif I'm expecting too much for a click\nbasically a common sense of humor values\ninterests or that I should develop the\nfriendships anyway since it can still\nhave value I'm in University right now\nand I know it's a good time to make\nfriends but it feels like people aren't\nthat interested and don't reciprocate\nthe effort to become friends which is fa\nFair since they're not obligated to be\nfriends with me but it is incredibly\ndemotivating since high school I've\nnever really felt like I belong also\nwhen I become friends with someone I\noften run out of things to talk about\neventually so any advice on that would\nbe appreciated as\nwell\nthoughts yeah um\nI'm more thinking about like running out\nof things to think about or talk about\nand I I know that that happened to me\nwhen I was so busy or focused on a\nspecific thing that I I didn't know what\nwas going on in the world anymore but\nwhen I'm like engaged with like what's\ngoing on in the\nworld I have more to talk about because\nI know about more things that are\nhappening and they're more relevant I\ndon't know\nyeah so I have kind of like two answers\nto this and they run contrary to each\nother the first is that you know I think\nsometimes like you it just takes time to\nfind your people yeah right so like I\njoined a fraternity when I was a\nfreshman and I ended up finding my\npeople within that fraternity but that\ntook actually three years like I felt\nlike an outsider in my fraternity for\ntwo years and then it was actually when\nI moved into the frat house junior year\nthat I really like got close to these\npeople that I had known for years and so\nsometimes like it you know so sometimes\nit just takes time to find your people\nor like have the circumstance where\nyou're ready to engage and they're ready\nto engage and this is about momentum too\nright like once you start one thing like\nyou make friends with one person then\nlike that kind of like you reach out to\ntheir Network you\nknow yeah there you're saying something\nvery lucid and they're typing Dr Chad\nthundercock I don't know what that means\nI think they've stopped paying attention\nto what you're saying and what I'm\nsaying\ntoo guess next question then no no we're\ngonna still answer the question it's\njust we got to give him a second to like\ncalm down right what the what does Dr\nChad Thunder like why why would that\nmean anything to\nanyone can I can I make sexually\ninappropriate comments oh\nWhy Stop Now Dr Chad thundercock is what\nhappened last night\noh I don't know what it was\ntoo when when we watch Netflix and fell\nasleep uh yeah okay that was a good time\nall right okay so um anyway so going\nback to the the serious\nquestion um at least I got her a high\nFive Guys she's a good sport um\nso yeah so the other thing is that that\nyou know this person says I want to read\nout what this person says so but I'm not\nsure if I'm expecting too much for a\nclick or that I should develop\nfriendships I'm in University right now\nI know it's a good time to make friends\nbut it feels like people aren't that\ninterested and don't reciprocate the\neffort of becoming friends I think this\nis a really important point so I think\nas a human race we are getting worse at\nmaking friends yep so social media and\nTechnology the things that make you feel\nawkward are not like specific to you\nthey're actually the result of a brain\nthat spends more time interacting with\ntechnology than like interacting with\nother human beings so I think\neveryone's ability to make friends skill\nis like Five Points lower than it used\nto be like 15 years ago so it's like\nliterally harder to make friends now\nbecause other human beings like don't\nknow how to do it properly you don't\nknow how to do it properly and then you\nguys all feel anxious and you're in your\nhead the whole time and then you feel\nawkward and they feel awkward and then\nit's just like it's harder it's just\nharder it is interesting because for us\nit's easier to keep our friends with\ntechnology but for you guys growing up\nwith this it's much\nharder yeah I um yeah so one or two\nother things okay so the second thing is\nthat like when I when I become friends\nwith someone I often run out of things\nto talk about eventually so you\nshouldn't go into that relationship\ntrying to check off things to talk about\nright like maybe what you should do is I\nknow it's super awkward but just be\nsilent and let them talk and then when\nthey talk when they start doing because\nright now like this person is doing all\nthe heavy lifting in the relationship\nit's like okay this person I'm asking\nquestion asking question asking question\nand then like they stop talking for a\nsecond it's like boom second question\nthird question fourth question fifth\nquestion and you're like not giving the\nspace to like participate in the in the\nconversation so just be quiet and let\nthem carry some of the heavy lifting and\nthen like they're going to feel super\nawkward when you don't say anything and\nthey're going to start getting anxious\nabout themselves when you don't say\nanything and then they're going to try\nto say something and then you respond by\nbeing super excited and appreciative and\nthen they're like this person likes me\nand then you guys talk about that and\nthen it becomes natural because then\nthey don't feel anxious you have to\ntolerate that awkwardness for like a few\nlike like 15 30 seconds where you're not\nsaying anything and then like they feel\nrelieved and then they're going to be\nrelaxed and then you're going to feel\ngood and it's like it's fine so just\nlike be silent don't do all the heavy\nlifting let them do some of the\nlifting got it so you like don't try too\nhard if it's not clicking just don't\ndon't invest more into kind of like a\ncircle of friends that's not going to\nhappen okay so\num all\nright should we let's go down a little\nbit because people posted stuff like\ndays\nago okay so I recently started working\nmy first job after studying\nengineering uh I was also employed by\nthe company that I'm currently working\nfor during my studying time and the job\npays decent the colleagues are great and\nthe work is challenging on a regular\nbasis but it's not what I wanted to do\nwith the degree and I also don't believe\nthat my work is even remotely related to\nmy Dharma as I'm also struggling with\nself-worth depression and all that jazz\nI was wondering where to focus first\npick up therapy again and use that to\ngrow as a person or finding a better\nfitting job or train for it first for\nthat matter or to find an act on\nzadarma um assuming this would be this\nwould lead to a greater sense of\nfulfillment maybe help self-confidence\nissues and act as an amplifier for the\ntherapy success what's your\ntake um also thanks for all the great\nwork you were doing with healthy gamer\nGG already helped me getting some\ninsights on how I work internally though\nthis can be intimidating or disgusting\nat times that's\ntrue okay so basically I think the\nquestion is I I got a job studied\nengineering pays decent colleagues are\ngreat work is challenging on a regular\nbasis but it's not what I wanted to do\nand I don't believe it's related to my\nDharma also I'm like dealing with\nconfidence and depression and so forth\nwhere do I\nstart I mean I think the career is not\nyour issue so I don't think you need to\nmake a dramatic career change I would\nfocus on figuring out the other stuff\num I think finding Therma is a really\ngood place to start\nso i' I'd offer a slightly different\nperspective I agree with gruy that I\ndon't think that your career is the\nproblem right now because if it's\nchallenging on a regular basis I'm\nassuming that's a good thing um if you\nlike your colleagues and if it pays\ndecent I wouldn't move quite yet so the\nfirst thing to understand is that if\nyou're struggling with depression or\nselfworth because this guy is like\nstarting to understand how they work let\nme ask you guys if you're\ndepressed how do you think that affects\nthe quality of choices you make about\nyour\nlife right so the first thing to\nunderstand is if you're trying to figure\nout like where to go in life you need a\nmap or a GPS that's functional and if\nyou're depressed your mind is not going\nto be thinking clearly so the first\nthing you should do is probably do do\nsomething like find a therapist and I\ndon't think it's coincidental that's\nthat that's the first thing that you\nthought of like in terms of your\nresponse so work on your depression and\nselfworth a little bit and like get your\nmind clear-headed because a clear-headed\nmind can make good decisions and you're\nright though that working on your Dharma\nis going to give you a sense of like\nconfidence and satisfaction so you can\ndo it that way too but the other thing\nto remember about Dharma which I don't\nhaven't done a good job of explaining is\nyou don't find your Dharma your D finds\nyou right and I think that if you're\nfeeling somewhat directionless and you\nhave low self worth your Dharma is\nwaiting for you to like get your [ __ ]\ntogether before it presents itself\nbecause if you've got low selfworth like\nit's you're not ready to do it right\nlike I I couldn't have started a healthy\ngamer a decade ago because I wasn't\nready I just wasn't ready even though I\nliked helping people like I just wasn't\nready\nso first focus on yourself you know\nstart to get a little bit clear-headed\nit sounds like you're learning a lot\nabout yourself so continue learning a\nlot about\nyourself and then Dharma will present\nitself when it's ready and you can\ncontinue looking for it and then like\nalso like over time as you start to get\nlike clearheaded the last thing that I\nwant to say and I I think you've already\naddressed this is that you know you\ndon't have to do you don't have to do\nthem sequentially so if your work isn't\nfulfilling like what is it that's\nmissing for your work and how can you\nstart start doing a little bit of\nthat right because this person says I\ndon't feel like it's aligned with my\nDharma it implies to me that they know\nwhat their Dharma\nis and kind of go from\nthere\n[Music]\nokay\num so let's do this one sure I'm\npreparing to give the GMAT so I can get\nan MBA and eventually immigrate to\nanother country I have a problem being\ndisciplined with self-studying and\npreparing on my own have seen your\nprocrastination video I realize that I\nfall in the first category and need to\ngrieve my loss of expectations of a high\nscore but I'm unable to do so I want to\nbe able to achieve that the the I don't\ngive a [ __ ] mental state for this test\nis that's when I perform the best I know\nI'm capable enough to score very high\nbut I feel like I'm getting in my own\nway\nand getting in touch with my head too\nmuch what can I do you want to give this\none a shot or you want me I mean I kind\nof feel like taking it but you want to\nsay something because you've actually\ntaken the gmap I I still remember the\nquestion this was like seven years ago\num that I got wrong it was the very end\nbecause I just panicked and I didn't\nreduce 65 over 13 like I still remember\nthat and if I had gotten that question\nright I would have gotten a better um\nGMAT test but guess what it would not\nhave changed a single thing about my\nlife I would have still gone to the\nbusiness school I went to I would still\nlike it wouldn't have changed a damn\nthing\num yeah 65 over 13 yeah not many things\nare divisible by 13 it's a [ __ ] trick\nquestion right that's the whole GMAT\nanyway um think about exactly how your\nlife is going to change depending on\nyour score and if want it\num if that is what is really important\nto you then yeah I think I think try for\nit I don't\nthink I don't think not giving a [ __ ] is\na good way to go I think you have to\ngive a [ __ ] about becoming who you're\nmeant to\nbe so I'm going to unpack this for a\nsecond okay so I want you guys to look\nat this I think we should just keep\nposting the questions here I want to be\nable to achieve the I don't give a [ __ ]\nmental state for this test is that's\nwhen I perform the best\nokay I know I am capable enough of\nscoring very\nhigh this is the\nproblem you can't have this thought and\nthis together because then you will not\nreduce 65 over 13 right this is the\nexpectation that you create for yourself\nand you make it sound like a good thing\nright so this is the real problem you\nguys think about it we say things to\nourselves and our parents say things to\nus and we think it's a positive thing\nlike when we say I have potential we\nmake it sound like a positive\nthing but it's not a positive thing it's\na burden it's an\nexpectation right it's like when you say\nyou know you're cap of scoring very high\nI don't think I don't think you're\ncapable of that capability is a\nhypothesis it's not a reality like you\nguys get that like capability is not a\nreal thing it's a\npotential it's not\nreal So when you say I'm capable I think\nyou're envisioning a perfect world where\nyou're disciplined and you sit down\nevery day and you study and all that\nkind of stuff and like sure but like you\ndon't have that discipline so why do you\nthink that's capable it's like for for\nsome reason we take certain attributes\nof oursel we fantasize them away and\nthen we're left with something that\nisn't who we are and we base our\ncapability on this fantasy of who we\nthink we are that you're not it's like\nif I imagine in my head that I have\nwings and I was a unicorn I could fly\nI'm capable of\nflying yeah man that's kind of true but\nyou're not a unicorn with wings bro so\nyou can't fly so when you fantasize\nabout this person that you could be and\nthen you think about the accomplishments\nthat you make and then you call yourself\ncapable of making those accomplishments\nbut like that's not\nreal right so when you say you're\ncapable I don't think you are start with\nthe idea that until you have a good GMAT\nscore behind you you're not capable of a\ngood GMAT score to me this sounds like\nhe kind of got a good one good score\nonce and what he can't do is be\nconsistent well you're assuming it's a\ndude but sure\nokay so so I mean I I think the way that\nyou start is by acknowledging that you\nmay not be able to get a good Gat score\nthe way that you start it's not don't\ngive a [ __ ] mental attitude it's the it\nit's the sitting down and studying and\nsaying I'm going to try to get the best\nGMAT score that I can and like I'm going\nto just study today for a certain amount\nof time until I can't study anymore and\nif that's an hour that's great if it's\ntwo hours that's great if it's 5 hours\nthat's awesome and then tomorrow I'm\ngoing to wake up the next day and I'm\ngoing to try to study and then it's just\nyou you don't worry about what you're\ncapable of because capability puts your\nmind in the future and then you're no\nlonger in the present and what you need\nto be in to study is in the present you\ncan't be in the\nfuture so get rid of this idea of\ncapability that's your problem maybe\nthere okay switch to\nam oh there we go sorry chat good over\nyes\nthis way towards the door okay okay no\nno but but then now I'm in the middle\nand you're kind of awkward and behind me\nit's weird it's okay I'll be like this\nokay all\nright any study tips for standardized\nexams absolutely so I think study first\nthing in the morning okay so your mind\nis freshest so if you guys want DLC\nnumber three will teach you guys how to\nstudy so um\nso study uh better to study first thing\nin the morning or first thing after you\nwake up and what I would try to do is\nlike don't worry about a particular goal\nworry about an action so it's not about\nlike scoring a certain amount of score\nit's about studying a certain amount\namount of time so I'm going to do 50\npractice questions today it's not like\nI'm going to get 50 practice questions\nright because when it comes to\nstandardized tests we're score oriented\nwe're not action Orient\nright the\nwork\num\nokay also\nsleep yeah sleep is good I I took naps\nand then I could like wake up and um I\nwould take my practice questions do some\ndo something else eat something take a\nnap and then when I woke up and like\nreviewed my questions I\ncould process them back I'm also a big\nfan of napping when you're like studying\nfor a standardized test so I would wake\nup like super early like I would study\nfrom like 4:30 to like maybe 8 or 9 and\nthen I would like hang out for a little\nwhile just relax like eat watch\nsomething I'd take a nap in the\nafternoon and then I'd like go to a\ncoffee shop when I woke up at like 5:00\np.m. and bang out two or three more\nhours I agree with this a lot this\nworked for me too because the other\nthing that kind of phes you about like\nwhen you take these exams is like when\nyou go into that stupid room I don't\nknow what they're doing nowadays if you\ncan take them just people\nwho sorry people are saying like 20\nminutes I'm not talking about 20 minute\nthat man I'd sleep for like two or three\nhours yeah get the rim like take a nap\ndude and just when you wake up it's like\nall right like I'd wake up around 4:\n4:30 like brush my teeth and then like\npack a bag pack a snack and go to a\ncoffee shop just get your ass out the\ndoor like don't worry about studying\njust get out the door and go to a coffee\nshop and bring your books with you in\nthe studing I know it sounds weird you\ndon't study for 3 hours what you do is\npack your bag and walk out the door and\ngo to a coffee shop and then once you\nsit at the table with your cup of coffee\nin the books in your bag like what do\nyou think is going to happen and then\nyou got to be careful like so cell\nphones weren't so bad when I was\nstudying but then like you know you\nsilence your cell phone you put it away\nwhatever so you got to watch out for\nthat but stud the other thing I got this\ntip from you too was so the GMAT in\nparticular um weights verbal scores\nhigher than the Quant scores and I\nremember you used to tell people to read\nthings like the New Yorker like read\nthings that are really dense and boring\nlike The Economist and whatever about a\ntopic that you don't like that much so\nlike Art reviews and Museum reviews and\nlike when you get so not exactly the\npractice material but like exercise that\npart of your brain that's just digesting\ninformation that you're not very good at\nokay\num which one yeah how do you get over\nthe fear of not achieving your full\npotential career-wise you can work at\nsomething every day forever and not\nachieve your dream and that terrifies\nme you know I think this kind of goes\nback to what I was saying earlier like\nwhere do you get the idea of full\npotential like what does that even\nme\nlike you know like I I don't I I\nliterally don't know what that means\nlike it's not a thing like full\npotential is not a thing like are we at\nour full\npotential I don't know like I could\ncertainly plus play fewer video games\nand spend more time like creating\ncontent and streaming more and sleeping\nless and browsing Reddit less and\nwatching twitch less am I at my full\npotential no I think the problem is that\nyou guys are so caught up with full\npotential like you're not focused on\ngood enough it's\nlike you know like think about the last\nyummy meal you had was it perfect did it\nachieve its full potential no but it was\nlike probably pretty good it was like\ngood enough\nman so now people say I'm not okay with\ngood enough excellent point so let's\ntalk about that for a second\nthe reason that you're so so the more\nashamed of yourself you are the more you\nneed to reach your full potential to\nmake yourself feel better and I want you\nguys to think about like selfworth is\nhere and the more shame you have the\nhigher you need to\nachieve to like even it out and end up\nhere so something really silly something\nreally dangerous happens is your shame\nincreases and you have the option to do\nthis you say it's not enough so I'm not\ngoing to do it you have the option to do\nthis and you say it's not enough so I'm\nnot going to do it and as you miss those\ntwo opportunities shame\ndecreases and then this oh it's not\nenough I can achieve\nmore so the only thing that moves you\nforward is\nperfection and then you're\n[ __ ] right because like this is what\nreally happens shame down here do this\ngood oh like hey I actually like that\nwas pretty cool like I actually did\nsomething for myself\ntoday\nbum oh like maybe maybe I can do okay\nfine like bum and then you didn't even\nachieve as much something funny happens\ncan you take solace in\nthat and then like oh I'm I'm not\nashamed of myself like oh like maybe I'm\nreally capable of things and like maybe\nI can like do that next thing\nwhoa crazy man get rid of\npotential it's this problem of\nescalating\nimpossibility do we have a video about\nthis I don't even remember I don't think\nso okay so I I know I've lectured about\nit before it's like the more behind you\nfall the more impossible your task\nbecomes and the way that I explain is\nlet's say you've got a month to study\nfor a final right like you have to study\nlet's say one hour a day for the next\nmonth and like 30 hours and you'll be\nfine for your Fin and so okay I got to\nstudy for 30 hours no big deal I can\nwait a week so you wait one\nweek and then or let's say you wait two\nweeks because you're a procrastinator\nand now instead of studying one hour a\nday you have to study two hours a day so\nthe less time that you have the more\nwork that you have to do and then you're\nlike I don't know if I really want to\nstudy two hours a day all right so then\nanother week goes by and now you have to\nstudy four hours a day or like 4.25 and\nyou're like man that's a lot of of\nstudying like I don't know like you put\nin an hour here you put in an hour there\nand then like 3 days go by and the final\nis 3 days away and now you've got to\nstudy 10 hours a day you're like oh [ __ ]\nI have to study 10 hours a day you like\nthink about gramming and you're like man\nput in like an hour or two and it's not\nenough and then like one day goes by now\nyou to studied 25 hours in two days and\nthe closer you get to the end the bigger\nthe pile is and then like studying 25 or\n30 hours in 2 days is too much then you\nfeel overwhelmed and you're like [ __ ] it\nI can't do it I should have started a\nmonth ago man I wish I would have\nstarted a month ago and then you beat\nyourself up over that and then like you\ncan't even study 25 hours because you're\nlike beating yourself\nup it's the problem of escalating\nimpossibility and then the problem is\nlike when when there's one day away and\nyou've you've dug really deep and you've\nstudied 10 hours and there's one day\nleft and you need to study 20 more and\nyou're like that's impossible I can't do\nit then you feel bad about\nyourself and you cram and cram and cram\nand you wind up with a c you end up\npassing class you're [ __ ] beating\nyourself\nup right like that's the problem of\nescalating\nimpossibility and so the more ashamed of\nyourself you feel the more Herculean you\nneed to do to feel good about yourself\nright it's got to be like you can't just\nbe successful like when you're 25 and at\nhome and like broke and like all of your\nfriends have jobs and maybe none of your\nfriends have jobs because they're all\nyou know broke like you and then like\noccasionally you meet like real people\nwho like have jobs and [ __ ] and then\nlike you've got to you can't just you\ncan't just get a job at that point right\nlike you can't make 25 a k 25k a year\nlike doing sales at a pest control\nbusiness like you can't go face those\npeople who like graduated from college\nand got careers and say like yeah I work\nin Pest Control it's like a it's like a\nstep forward for you but it's not enough\nyou're you're not ready to talk to them\nuntil you walk in and you say yeah I\nstarted my own multi-million dollar\nconglomerate what's\nup that's what you need because that's\nyour potential and unless you can get\nthat you're not going to move a single\nstep\nforward and that's what screws you right\nso start with Pest\nControl start with the lowest thing that\nyou can possibly do and like let go of\nyour [ __ ] egoo because your ego is\nnot helping it's the ego that wants to\nwalk in and say like look at how big I\nam\nlook at all that shame it's gone no it's\nnot gone you're cloaking it with ego\nshame still there man you guys see that\nhow like the ego like compensates for\nthe shame like the two exist\ntogether let them both\ngo don't just get a job so here's the\nother thing right so like a lot of\npeople a lot of times people are saying\nthink I'm saying like just do this just\ngo get your F go just go make friends\njust go get a job just just go find a\ngirlfriend no no I'm not saying just go\ndo anything in fact I'm not even saying\ndo anything at all what I'm saying is\npay attention to the thing that holds\nyou back from acting and study it and\nlearn it and conclude for yourself\nwhether this thing is holding you back\nand then try to take action and see what\nhappens that's the\nstrategy don't just like go do because\nif you guys could just go get a job you\nwould have done it by now what's holding\nyou back is not a lack of capability\nit's a lack of understanding and that's\nwhy this is like great right because you\nguys are good at understanding if we had\nto make you guys disciplined and like\nnot lazy we would fail can't do that but\nwe can teach you something because y'all\ncan learn because y'all are [ __ ]\nsmart so that's the hand that we're\ndealt that's the hand that we're going\nto\nplay respect for smartness not\ndiscipline just go do it is for people\nwho have high discipline\nscores sorry for the rant\nokay all these questions are the\nsame okay you pick them\nokay oh I like the how I stop feeling\nlike I'm better than others well that's\na good one where is that okay how do I\nstop feeling like I'm better than others\nand stop stop constantly comparing\nmyself to\nothers I mean I feel like this is more\nmy wheelhouse you want to talk about\nthis it's more your wheelhouse no it's\njust like psychology stuff I mean I was\njust in a room with 120 other people\nthat all thought they were better than\neverybody\nelse\num and that's what business goal really\nis you know and the people that did the\nbest there and that I have seen\nconsistently are the people that\nrecognize that they have something to\nlearn from everyone so it's almost like\nto be better to continue being better\nrecognize that to keep that edge you\nhave to keep learning and\neveryone has something to teach\nyou wise words I I mean I I'd say that\nyou those were the people that were\nactually the\nbest yeah so I think that it's like like\nif you just think about the concept of\nSo when you say how do I stop comparing\nmyself the first thing that you have to\nlook at is like when you feel better\nlike why why does your mind think that\nyou're better and what does that do for\nyou so feeling better like feeling like\nyou're smarter than other people like I\ndon't know if you guys have seen the\nsubreddit I am very smart but it's a\nbrilliant subreddit but like just think\nabout like what psychological function\ndoes feeling better than someone else\nserve and and what what it serves is\nthat actually you don't have confidence\nin yourself because the confident person\ndoesn't care about what the other people\nare doing what you actually have is like\nshame so what what since you don't have\na a true sense of your own capability\nyour sense of worth comes out of\nsuperiority of other people like you\ndon't have that intrinsic sense of value\nso like you have to your value is\nderived out of comparison it's like you\nknow if I have a $5 bill and I don't\nknow what that's worth and I compare it\nto a $1 bill and a $10 bill it's like\nthe worth of the $5 bill is like out of\ncomparison of those two things what\nabout\npeople that have like parents that are\nconstantly comparing like is that like a\nlearned behavior yeah so when you have\nparents who constantly compare you to\nother people it makes you feel shitty\nabout yourself and then you start\ncomparing yourself to other people and\nfeeling Superior because that's how you\ndeal with your low sense of selfworth\nright because they don't acknowledge you\nas a human being they acknowledge you as\nsomeone in reference to someone else\nright it's like you don't have intrinsic\nvalue your sense of self is dependent on\nhow we compare you to other people like\nthat's what you're teaching the kids\nyeah right like that's like it like\nthat's what happens and then you get all\nthese egotistical Indian\nkits and then they're like oh\nsorry goad tell me tell me tell me how\nare they you tell me you tell us what's\nit like being married to\none oh\njeez I feel like I just have to mock you\na decent amount no no I mean but did you\nguys see like I said I feel like this is\nin my wheelhouse and she was like do you\nsee how this like you feel like\neverything is in your whe wheelhouse\nlike there it is right it's like as much\nas I try to escape being an egotistical\nIndian man it chases after me and like\nthis is the thing you don't have to\nconquer it you just have to like\nrecognize it and sort of try to keep it\nin check some of the\ntime I'll\nhelp biggy g123 says that doesn't help\nwith stereotypes about our race yeah you\nknow\nit's the experience that I grew up in so\nit's what I know it also like so like no\njoke so I grew up there were five people\nin my town in Texas there were five\npeople who were in my grade who were\nIndian three of them are\ndoctors it's like come on man three out\nof five are\ndoctors yeah and they went to med school\non time yeah I went I was the reject I\nwent to med school\nlate like they were done with with\nresidency when I was starting med school\nand there was some shame there but you\nknow you get over\nit\nokay yeah so just to answer this\nperson's question how do I stop feel\nfeeling like I'm better than others and\nstop constantly comparing myself to\nothers so what you have to find is why\nyou need to feel better than others\nbecause that's a response of your\npsychology that's a need that your mind\nis fulfilling for you by creating those\nthoughts it's protecting you from\nsomething so find where the source of\nwhy you feel like you need to be better\nthan others is and then the comparison\nwill go away as you heal that\nthing right you got to find like why do\nI feel like I'm not good enough that's\nthe question you've got to ask yourself\nand then like if you want to do like an\nexercise like stop and think about when\ndid I start to feel like I wasn't good\nenough when did I start to compare\nmyself and what happened around that\ntime you got to dig into that comparing\nyourself I think is also kind of\na you know if there's only five slots\nopen for something right you have to\ncompare yourself because you're trying\nto be be good enough to be in one of\nthose five slots so I think if you're in\nthat kind of rat race it's hard not to\nyeah so I mean she's she's spoton right\nlike so the other thing that we have to\nremember is that our society chains us\nto compare this person was talking about\nIndian stereotypes but like literally\nlike even now my mom like Compares me to\nother people people and it's like I\ndon't I'm confused\nlike anyway and and it still bothers me\nbecause like that's a leftover hurt from\nwhen I felt like she wasn't treating me\nlike a person it's like I shouldn't it\nshouldn't even bother me she wants to\ncompare me fine like it's no big deal\nit's not you know no sweat off my back\nbut that's a leftover hurt that I have\nfrom like it triggers my shame from\nbefore anyway but I I think we have to\nremember that our our society literally\nlike Compares us and so social media\nmakes this worse so before we used to\nhave like sort of a informal hierarchy\nand we would occasionally like Elevate\nsome people like very explicitly right\nlike some people would get Awards or\ntrophies or like have the highest GPA\nvalid dictorian class president and the\nrest of the people like only 10% of\npeople or less got an actual like\nphysical representation of their value\ncompared to the other students now with\nsocial media it's like how many\nfollowers do you have it's like almost a\nway for our brain to rank our value as\nhuman beings in comparison to other\nhuman beings and so that's why I think\nthese problems are getting worse with\nmental health because like social media\nlets you like feel bad as a human like I\nam less accepted than I was yesterday\nbecause what I posted got fewer\nlikes right so we've like formalized\nthat process and reinforced a society\nthat compares us and so it's hard harder\nto not compare yourself and then like if\nwe think about it the more like just\nkind of tying things together you know\nthe person who gets bent out of shape\nbecause their post has less likes\ndoesn't have an intrinsic sense of\nconfidence because if they did they\nwouldn't give a [ __ ] how many likes they\nget right so it's like it all Loops back\ntogether so social media basically\nenhances that\nDynamic let's do this\none okay where's the line yeah so\nwhere's the line between supporting a\nfriend and acting as a therapist I find\na lot of the time I want to be there for\nfriends and people I meet in life when\nthey come asking for help they share\ntheir problems I talk with them and help\nthem untangle some of the uncertainty\nthey're feeling but at the same time I'm\nconcerned about overstepping and acting\nmore as their therapist I'm unclear\nabout where exactly that line is I feel\nthe term therapist is used quite\nliberally these days which creates some\nconf\nconfusion what do you\nthink this is more your\nwheelhouse okay um\nso you know so a lot of people think\nthat what we do on therapy I mean on\nstream is therapy so let me explain like\nI agree that therapy is used somewhat\nliberally and people have like sort of\nlost sight of what true therapy is so\ntalking to someone about their emotions\nand their life is not therapy that's\nwhat we do right we talk to people about\nemotions or therapy I mean uh emotions\nor feelings or heart or whatever like\nthat's why I think what we do is better\ndescribed as coaching because it's not\nanyway so like just because you talk to\nsomeone about emotions and support them\ndoesn't make you a therapist like that's\nthe job of a friend right is to help\nthem talk through things and understand\nthings I think the real issue is like\nare you trying to help them and I'm not\njust saying this for legal purposes but\nreally like a therapist is a oneway Rel\nrelationship that is designed to support\nsomeone with like a particular\npsychological issue and the way that we\noften times describe those is like a\ndiagnosis right so the first thing about\na therapy relationship versus a friend\nrelationship is it two-way or is it\noneway if it's two-way it's not\ntherapy sometimes those people need your\nsupport and sometimes you need their\nsupport if you are having a one-sided\nrelationship with someone then you\nshould really consider why do you\nconsider that a\nfriendship cuz then it's like more of a\ntherapy sort of role\nright so when you have a friend it it\nthere should be some amount of two-way\nto it\num the second thing is that like if you\nhelp people un untangle things in their\nlife like that's great like I think you\nshould continue doing that and maybe one\nday become a therapist so I started like\nhelping people figure themselves out\nwhen I came back from India the first\ntime and felt like I understood\neverything in the world and at the age\nof 21 I sort of became like a you know I\nwas a camp counselor but I would like\nhelp younger kids and stuff like that um\nand and so like I started like helping\npeople at the age of 21 and sort of\nfinding my Dharma and I was going to\nbecome a monk and like help people that\nway so it's it's fine that you have that\ncapability I think if someone needs your\nhelp you should try to help them but be\na little bit careful because like call\nit what it is is it oneid is it\nfriendship and do they support you in\nsome way and I think if those things\nhappen it's not whether you have an\nemotional conversation with someone and\nwhether you untangle things that's not\nwhat makes something a therapy or a\nfriendship what makes it a therapy or a\nfriendship is whether it's one-sided or\ntwo-sided and also like whether you're\nactually trying to like help them fix a\nlongstanding like psychological issue\nbecause if you are doing that chances\nare even though you think you're helping\nyou may be a little bit out out of your\ndepth and you may actually be like doing\nthem a disservice because they may be\ngetting emotional Band-Aids from you\nwithout ever like exploring it with\nsomeone who's more competent than you\nare maybe you're competent you can help\nthem in that way I'm not saying that you\naren't but that's something that you got\nto think about right like if they\nthey're calling you every week like\ncrying about their problems like maybe\nit's time to have a conversation with\nthem about like hey is this like like\nwhat's going on between us like I'm\nhappy to support you but like I feel\nlike every week we have this\nconversation I'm happy have this\nconversation for the next couple of\nmonths every week if you want to but I'm\nwondering is there something else like I\ncare about you is there something else\nthat we could do to like really help you\nwith this or do you feel like this is\nenough so I think in my in my experience\nI prefer friends who kind of overstep\nand then I can be like uh this is kind\nof more than I need from you um as\nopposed to friends who are afraid of\nkind of getting their hands messy\num because it shows you care right like\nif you're willing to take that on\num and I think in in my my strongest\nfriendships are all ones where we've\nkind of played therapists but for a\nlittle while and it you kind of have to\nrecognize like hey this has been going\non for like month or two for now have\nyou thought about seeing somebody\nit's funny oh sorry I got distracted and\nwas reading twit chat okay they're\nfunny um wondering when actual incel\nStream So I have a crazy idea guys I\nknow sorry for derailing you H it's okay\nI have a crazy idea that there's no such\nthing as a true\nincel that a potential Insel it's like\nthe the true the mythol it's like\nactually a unicorn because what happens\nwhen we get insults on streams they turn\nout to be decent people what happens\nwhen we get dudes with wuss on stream is\nthey turn out to be decent people like\noh it's crazy guys it's almost as if all\nof these like constructions that we make\nabout people oh people are just\npeople great but if there is a real\nincel out there I'm waiting for\nyou\nokay you can have Adam but are there\ntimes that you feel like you've been my\ntherapist or played that role no\nwhy cuz I mean you give me plenty of\nsupport right so it's where where is\nthat\nline yeah I don't think I've ever been\nyour therapist yeah I don't think so\neither so so like here's why so like\nbecause I'm personally invested in your\nrelationship right right so like when\nwhen like a therapist as a therapist\nwhen someone comes in with like let's\nsay a marital conflict I'm 100% on their\nside but I can't ever be 100% on your\nside because I have to protect my side I\nprotect your side I know and I protect\nyour side but like I can't with\ntherapist it's like I'm 100% on their\nside like I can't ever be you know in\nterms of our conflict I think this\napplies to others too right like there's\nthere's a point at which like you\nknow I I might be waiting out of my\nelement here but even like for substance\nabuse stuff right you're going to have\nyour friends that like do that with you\nand it's sometimes against their\ninterest or their side to like encourage\nyou to get\nsober right so I think you also have to\ndecipher like where other people's\ninterests are to see where and when\num that advice is worth taking you know\nwhat I just realized tell me I never\nwatch our stream our stream is really\ngood is it yeah okay I really like\nwatching twit chat react to our stream\nbut I just it's kind of weird but I\ndon't watch it but it's actually pretty\nfun all I know is when I lean my head I\nget head leans when I put on my glasses\neverybody types glasses so it's it's\nlike a\nweird no no no I'm not talking about\nmyself I'm talking about you guys\nresponding to her like that's\nentertaining [ __ ] it\nis not talk no I'm not talking about my\ncontent I'm talking about like y'all's\ncontent this interaction is it's fun to\nwatch\nokay oh my God I can't imagine how bored\nI would be if I was just listening to\nmyself rant and soap\nboox one day maybe if I get good enough\nat this you'll\nunderstand I I think you have that\npotential oh yeah I thought potential\nwas a construct yeah you you have the\npotential to be be me one day oh\nno\nokay um world only needs one so I think\nmaybe we'll we'll do one more question\nand then we'll transition to twitar\nwe'll take a quick break and then or I\nmean you can keep going if you want but\nI need to pee me too um transition to\ntwitar we've drank a lot of water how do\nyou choose do you want are we doing\nbooze okay how do you choose we should\ndo boo 600k we have done this let's\ncelebrate okay how do you choose a path\na path that is financially more stable\nand might turn into a passion but you\ndon't know fully and something you enjoy\nbut money isn't great doing it for\nexample I'm going into computer science\nand know nothing about it and I'm\nstarting at level zero I also have a lot\nof experience with personal health and\ntraining but I think it might be more of\na hobby than my true\ncalling yeah Financial Security I think\nis the heart of this question right like\nhow do\nyou make that transition if you don't\nhave like a financial\nfallback is that that's what I got out\nof it what did you get out of it I'm a\nlittle bit brain dead but what what I\nkind of got is that like so if you're\ninterested in Fitness and personal\nhealth I think like we've been saying\nearlier like don't those the two aren't\nmutually exclusive right so if you like\ncomputer sence then go for it and then\nyou know you can still do fitness and\nhealth like that's going to be important\nlike you don't think that when you end\nup working get one of these what are you\ntrying to do just tell me what you're\ntrying to do do it I'm trying to make\nsure that what you're talking about is\nnot what he wants to hear and I have\njust confirmed that that is not this\nisn't about personal health don't talk\nabout med school anymore what no it is\nthe question it's about financial\nstability like how do you make that\ntransition how do you choose a fa path\nthat is financially more stable might\nturn it into a passion but you don't\nknow fully and something you enjoy but\nmoney isn't great doing\nit this is what I'm starting with I I\nalso have a lot of experience with\npersonal health and training but think\nit might be more of a hobby than my true\ncalling that's why I'm talking about\npersonal health okay okay\nso um so so like you know if you are\ninterested in personal health and\ntraining and you're like majoring in\nksai because commai is going to get you\na job I don't think that those two are\nmutually exclusive and like if it's a\nhobby that's great and like I I you know\ncuz like for example there are fitness\napps right like if you were designing a\nfitness app do you think you would\ndesign so let me put it this way would\nan app developer who understands Fitness\ndo a better job at designing an app than\nan app developer who doesn't understand\nFitness maybe yes maybe no the second\nthing is is someone who wants to make a\nfitness app who owns gym going to be\nbetter equipped to make a fitness app\nthan someone who understands\nprogramming right so I think that like\nFitness and Technology are like really\nreally in line right now you know could\nyou learn how to code like a heart rate\nmonitor or something else right like\nthere's a lot of stuff around technology\nand fitness that go hand inand and the\nlast of which is if you enjoy\nprogramming and then you end up working\nfor a company that's like you know\nyou're a programmer and there are a\nbunch of [ __ ] programmers around who\nlike spend their free time on Twitch\ndrinking Mountain Dew and eating Cheetos\nlike maybe you can teach them something\nabout t Fitness I want Cheetos okay so I\ngot the financial stability question and\nI think this is a really hard and really\ngood question because we had Financial\nfallbacks that let us do what we're\ndoing and when you don't have that it is\nabsolutely if you have to like focus on\nthe rent if you have to focus on your\nbills that's why I think people should\nbe able to get non- student loans like\nI'm not a student I'm not I don't want\nto learn I just want to try um so I\nthink you can if you want to start a\nbusiness try to at least get it started\nand look into things like sbir grants\nwhich will fund small business um the\none thing I have learned is that there\nare so many resour resources available\nin this world that people just have no\nidea about so look for things like like\nif you have a calling try to figure out\nhow you can make it a real thing and not\njust a hobby are they just chatting\nabout chips\nnow yeah I I don't think there's a\nCheeto emote so Doritos it is and and\nthey're doing Doritos man Freo get on it\num sponsorship\nopportunity I will eat Cheetos for money\nthis I will do um so I think creating\nthat Financial fallback you can either\ntry to save up for it and take stuff on\nI think upwork and those kinds of\nplatforms are really good ways to kind\nof wade into freelance world and try to\nget some extra money while seeing if\nyou're good at it\num so you can try to create like a side\nhustle that way you can also if a side\nhustle isn't the right way for you if\nlike trying to save up more if you're\nalready working crazy long hours and\ndon't have more bandwidth for that I\nthink you can also have really honest\nconversation with whoever you are\nemployed with to yeah chips\num about things like advances or bonuses\nor other ways you can kind of\nrestructure that Arrangement uh there\nare resources in the Discord by the way\nabout how to do this and um another\nthing that you could probably do\nis this is risky but you could ask to go\nfrom like an employment status to a\ncontractor status because that\nwill let you take home more of your\nactual paycheck and will help you phase\nout into something else and that way\nlike your employer sees it coming you\nkind of can put yourself on like a\nsix-month contract or something like\nthat with your work and try to move into\nsomething else and if it doesn't work\nthen you've already been there um and\nyou can try to go\nback it's super risky but if if you're\nsome if so I work best under pressure\nif you're someone like that the risk can\nactually help light a fire under your\nass if you're not like that then that's\nnot the right way for you but look for\nmoney or save money preferably do both\nand I think there's there's ways you can\ntackle either\nside do you just want to watch chat\nreact to random [ __ ] no I just know\nwho's streaming what iard heard the\nphrase employment status to contractor\nstatus and it's like one of those things\nwhere I just like it sounds like what\nyou said was really important and really\nhelpful and I just couldn't I was\nreading twit chat and I even tried\nclosing my eyes but I saw twit chat when\nmy my eyes\nclosed so what she said was probably\nreally important I'd pay attention to it\nbut I have nothing else to say okay\nlet's take a break we're gonna go grab a\ndrink um and we'll see you guys back in\na\nmuted Boomer\nBoomer muted\nBoomer okay\nTwitter so let's see how do\nI how do I find Twitter\nquestions\ntwitar did you guys do yall do\nthat\nokay oh Moses was telling me to tell you\nguys to stop donating is is we were\nhitting close to\n100K Moses was furiously dming me on\nDiscord okay I'll tell you guys to\nstop okay how do I find\ntwitcher hold on let's see if Dr K can\ndo it by himself\nokay I found our\nTwitter hold\non Twitch can you guys help me with\nthis oh here we\ngo okay great so uh Zach do you want to\nH\nokay found\nit okay let's let's keep going Mrs K\nwill be with us in a\nmoment\nokay okay after Twitter okay cool man\nthanks Zach um so I got a quiet paying\njob let me see if I can do this let's\njust do this\none so I got a quiet well-paying job\nright after uni graduated three years\nlater than my peers but it doesn't\nreally push me to learn anything if I\nquit outside my current job I have zero\nvalue and I'm not even scared because\n75% of my current salary goes to the to\nthe bank account and I can\nlive I can live off it several years if\nneeded comfort and avoidance\neffort type\nprocrastination prevent growth I avoid\nany outside pressure and good at it and\nI'm not internally\nmotivated live to get by never\nexperienced well-being so can't strive\nfor it so I'm on the way\nto so I'm on the way to have harder and\nworse paying jobs as time\npasses this is really confusing why are\nyou on the way to have harder\nand worse paying jobs okay so let's\nstart with this okay one second okay so\nfirst of all good for you for graduating\nthree years later than your peers and\nstill like putting your life together\nand not getting like bent out of shape\nbecause you're quote unquote later see\nthere's the\ncomparison and it sounds like now that\nyou have your needs met you're not\ninspired to do anything extra and that\nmakes a lot of sense right so like if we\nthink about this\num I forgot what ail yeah there we go\nthank you cheers cheers cheers you guys\nthank you\nokay sorry it's a little\nstrong foul concoction I'm\nsorry oh my God I feel like the strink\nshould be called The Devil's\ndiabetes it's made with Coke Zero oh my\nGod\nno no no no I I'm glad you made I mean\nit's like better than what I would have\nmade I'm don't don't let my disgust with\nthe beverage be interpreted as any\namount of lack of appreciation for you\nyou're\nawesome it's just the Devil's diabetes\nis the devil's diabetes like what you\nknow you just came up with a new drink\nand it's school it's like lots of\nalcohol zero calories it's Coke Zero\ntastes awful it's a lemon yeah um the\nlemon really does\nhelp um sponsorship opportunity\nseriously freit Coca-Cola where are yall\nokay um because now we actually have to\ndo this thing now we now we actually are\ndoing this coaching thing no no I mean\nwe were doing this coaching thing anyway\nyeah we've been doing it what are you\nwhat do you mean no I know but like now\nwe've got we're gonna\nhave almost 400 of you guys are gonna be\nable to work with a coach within a month\nand I'm so excited about that but I want\nto get to where we can help 10,000\npeople someone's telling me to kiss\nyou you want to do sign no that's okay\nsome things we keep private yeah um okay\nso this this person's question on\nTwitter\num so has a quiet well-paying job\ndoesn't really push you to learn\nanything if I he's making money storing\nit in a bank account doesn't really know\nlike what to strive for basically seems\nlike he's complacent he or she um okay\nso\nuh 200k C gold kiss no we're not going\nto just have more and more stretch goals\nwe're really happy for everything you\nguys have yeah anything on top of this\num we mentioned this before but I\ndefinitely want to say it again is just\ngoing to go to subsidizing free services\nand padding the scholarship fund so yeah\nif you want to contribute it will not be\nwasted but like we're done we're done\nasking you guys for money yep right so I\nmean we're done you have given enough\nright and we're we're very very grateful\nfor that yeah but um yeah so just going\nback to this person's question so I\nthink it's important to recognize that\nlike sometimes when you have your needs\nmet it's hard to move forward in life\nright and like this is where like\nbecause a lot of times it's\num I'm getting distracted\nby okay I'll I'll take over what is the\nquestion they want you to kiss them is\nthat why you're distracted yes because I\ndo want to kiss them I know I I really\nwant to hug everyone in this is why he\nwants to do the retreat this is why I\nwant to do the retreat because I want to\nweep with all of\nyou be so\ntouchy it's be a lot of touching lot of\nfeeling you can sleep alone because\nyou're going to be covered in\nCorona canor virus canor virus our\ntwo-year-old calls of the canora\nvirus canora\ncanola okay I can't read this thing it\ndoesn't have to P\nquit 75% of my\nyeah I I feel like I know a lot of\npeople in this position okay quiet wellp\npaying job they're financially very\ncomfortable just kind of nothing to live\nfor nothing to do and if they leave this\njob no it's not like they know where\nthey would go is that the gist of it I\nthink so\nyeah so thoughts on how to respond yeah\nso it sounds\nlike it sounds like kind of a lack of\npurpose right um and I think\nvolunteering um is a good thing to do\nand also one of the things that I have\nbeen really grateful for from my friends\nin this position is their advice and\nmentorship and guidance on healthy gamer\nso if you want to help a friend out that\nmight be wanting to start something or\ndo something or go out on their own be\nthat person be that Financial safety net\nfor them um I'm like such a huge\nbeliever in just sharing the wealth so I\nthink that's a really good place to do\nthat invest in a friend invest in a\nperson invest an idea invest in a cause\ndo something good for the world you know\nwho else is good with sharing the wealth\nand investing in a\ncause who twit chat\nyeah I thought you were gonna be like so\nanother person wants me to pay for their\ntuition I thought that's where that was\ngoing no no no no no no it's twitchchat\ndude ttat awesome twitchchat is the real\nhero yeah um you yeah so\nso here's what I'd say like I I'd really\nwonder what this person so practically\nright so this is supposed to be advice\nso practically I'd wonder who do you\nhang out with yeah because I think a lot\nof complacency comes from your peers yep\nand so are you around people who like\nthink and want to be better and grow are\nyou like basically around office drones\nor like do you just have your friends\nthat you game with cuz they're not going\nto pull you forward I think this person\nneeds to try to find people who like\nChallenge and Inspire them and get them\nto ask questions and think about things\nand like engage them intellectually\nbecause this person sounds like\nintellectually like they're\nstarved and so so really think about who\nyou hang out with and can you hang out\nwith people who are curious about stuff\nand like really you know like make you\nthink about like something\nelse um and this kind of goes back to I\nthink a big symptom of like our problem\nin this society which is that we make\ngoals that are based on like careers and\nfinancial stability to the\nexclusion of like\npersonal growth or Dharma or anything\nlike that and I think it's good to have\nfinancial goals and try to be secure and\nstuff like that like I mean like like\nwe've said to you guys before I mean we\nstarted with this and and gruy spot on\nthat like you know it was okay because\nso I started out with a goal of like\nFinancial Security and like we were\ngoing to do healthy gamer in a way where\nlike we could support it because I\nliterally no one has done this before\nyou know we're we you know we did this\nfor months without any kind of\nfundraising or anything like that and\nlike we weren't planning on\nfundraising um and and so like Financial\nstability is a fantastic place to start\nso in a sense like this person feels\nlike they're at the end of their road to\nme but you're not at the end of your\nroad you're actually at the beginning of\nyour road yeah you're complacent because\nyou've like you know like no dude you're\njust starting like now you've like built\nyour base and you have your economy\nrunning and then you can actually start\nto like grow and expand yeah and so the\nquestion is how do I figure out like\nwhat to grow and expand towards and so\nthen what you need to do is like\nsurround yourself with people who like\ncare about\n[ __ ] and as you surround yourself with\npeople who care about things hopefully\nyou'll move\nforward you're not thinking like this\nperson has a problem in I say like a\nproblem of lack of thought it's a lack\nof inspiration they're searching for\ninspiration I think they're actively\ntrying figure out how to search for\ninspiration yes and I think changing\nyour Social Circle is a good way to do\nthat yep right so in my case what\nhappened so it's interesting you know\nand hopefully this doesn't come across\nas egotistical but like literally I\nfound myself at Harvard Medical School\nand I was like holy [ __ ] these guys like\nreally they're [ __ ] try hards and I\nwas like maybe I should try TR hard too\nbeing surrounded by try hards is like I\nmean it can be toxic in some ways but I\nreally kind of took it as inspirational\nand you know I have like other friends\nso one of my buddies started a mental\nhealth startup while he was still in med\nschool before residency another one of\none of my friends like after residency\nmoved out to California and she's doing\nher startup and like when you you're\nsurrounded by people who like you know\nare trying to do things and make things\nit gets you working\nright and it gets you like there's also\nso I found this a lot when I was I went\nfrom startup life to kind of like\ncorporate life where people are when\nyou're around a lot of risk averse\npeople that just kind of want to put in\ntheir time and get out and go do\nsomething else that can rub off on you\ntoo in a really bad way so I mean I\nthink especially if you're young um\ndefinitely save up definitely have like\na Roth IRA and a 401k\nlike I I worry about this generation a\nlot because you don't first of all you\ndon't know what resources there are\nsecond of all you get dinged on fees\nleft and right and third you guys aren't\nfinancially Savvy enough to know where\nto put your money and it's\nnot there are ways to kind of grow your\nmoney to create those kind of financial\nsafety nets for you in the future so if\nyou do want to start something in the\nfuture um you can and it's not going to\nbe like millions of dollars but it'll be\nenough for like three months four months\nrent okay so wasted seven to eight years\nin Dota 2 now my 23-year-old bought that\nADHD ass someone's been paying attention\nyeah has responsibilities I've actually\nthought a lot about things and gotten a\nlot of help from watching your channel\nbut I haven't been able to do any\nconcrete work on my situation and my\ngoal of living independently I felt\nempowered when I learned that my\nstrength Li in managing as many things\nas I can while failing at none but I\nstart as a master planner and can't\nquite follow through on things y please\nadvise me on how to work and on it and\nalso on deciding what to commit to yep\nthoughts I mean you're the Vata I work\nvery\ndifferently so I think the problem here\nso I'm going to go ahead and and copy\npast to this okay\nokay copy\npasta\nokay um so I felt empowered when I\nleared that my strength lies in managing\nas many things as I can while failing at\nnone but I start as a master\nplanner and can't quite follow through\nokay going to highlight that I haven't\nbeen able to do any concrete work okay\nso let's look at this for a second okay\nso the problem isn't follow through the\nproblem seems to be starting so there's\na big difference between\nplanning starting and finishing and when\nI see this sentence I haven't been able\nto do any concrete work on my situation\nI think you've got planning and you\nthink that the problem is follow through\nbut oddly enough what I want you to do\nis actually start stuff and go ahead and\nfail them like I think it's better for\nthis person to start and\nabandon compared to plan and not start\nyeah so what I would love to see this\nperson do is actually start a bunch of\nthings and then not follow through but\nat least start them so you'd rather they\ncancel yep yeah I'd rather them fizzle\nout get good at starting and fizzling\nout and then then try to bring balance\nand follow through into\nit does that make sense like just got to\nget started this person hasn't started\nwhen they say I can't do concrete work\nyeah because you're you're planning and\nyou're concerned about not following\nthrough because in the past you haven't\nfollowed through and that's what keeps\nyou from getting started whereas what\nlike each of these are discrete like\npsychological or neuroscientific skills\nstarting a task and overcome overcoming\nprocrastination is a different\npsychological or mental skill from\nstaying on top of a task and seeing it\nthrough to completion so don't confuse\nthe two and just get\nstarted and when you say you have a plan\nso I'd say like take one of your plans\nand break it down into like what's the\nlast step and this is kind of cool so\ndon't start with the first\nstep what is the last step before your\nplan is\ncomplete and then go to the step okay\nwhat needs to be done before you do that\nand then what needs to be done before\nyou do that and what needs to be done\nbefore you do that and at some point you\nhave to ask yourself can I do this today\nand if the answer is no then go back\nwhat do I need to do before I can do\nsomething today and then you work\nyourself backwards to the first thing\nthat you need to do can you do this\ntoday and when you find the thing that\nyou can do today you do it\ntoday I think there are some specific\nthings though that you do right like\nwhen you're when you settle into like\nyour admin work and stuff like that you\nturn on music you eat light because you\ndon't want to get sleepy there are like\nsome specific things that you do to kind\nof get into like the just bang it out\nmode right as AATA I'm sorry I wasn't\npaying attention\nwhat so as this person's AATA I'm\nalready Tipsy there's not that much in\nit okay I'm a lightweight whatever so if\nyou're a v that these are things that\nhave worked for him in particular so he\nlistens to music he shuts himself off\nright like no\ninterruptions um he doesn't check his\nphone he he also plans to to when he\nsettles in he's like I'm just gonna like\nwatch a replay or I'm just gonna like he\njust watches DOTA for like 15 20 minutes\nand then and then he starts right so you\nkind of settle into that flow State he\nalso does this thing where he like won't\neat too heavy because then he'll get\nsleepy so if you're trying to like get\ninto like a mode where you're like just\nexecuting executing executing those are\na couple things that he does I'm so I'm\nso temperamental and finicky I'm tell\nlike he's the most high maintenance\nperson in like I've ever met and then he\nlike gets on our kids because like\nthey're so picky oh man I'm so hard to\nlive with you don't no I you okay all\nright kind of a diva okay\nso yeah so I'd say like focus on getting\nstarted and then you know fail a couple\nof times and then you'll figure out and\nfollow through afterward but do these do\nthese very specific things to like try\nto get into a flow\nState okay how do you deal with pressure\nto choose profession to follow being at\nn 18 or 19 years old don't do it it's a\ntrap just don't do it just pick\nsomething just pick something that\nsounds good to you at the time and\neverybody else happy then do what you\nwant yeah\nand like you don't have to you don't\nhave to commit to oppress uh a\nprofession commit to oppression and\ncommit to a profession at at 18 or 19\nyears olds it's silly [ __ ] yeah I\nmajored in neurobiology and I started my\ncareer at the age of 27 or 28 I want to\nbe a [ __ ] political journalist and\nlook at where she is\nnow right not a political journalist I\nthought you want to do like political\nlike\nstrategy yeah because political\njournalists make [ __ ] money I'm really\nglad I'm not a political journalist\nright now but I I'm a political person\nand so when Healthcare pisses me off I\nget to do something about it you guys\nare keeping track of the DLCs right\nbecause I forgot are you going to do\ndrunk dlc's absolutely dude best drunk\nDLC is best DLC hello Dr K I had as you\nsay an easy life my parents who love and\nsupport me and didn't had big big\nsuffering in the past right now I'm\nstudying economics psychology and\ndiscovered through you that I love\nhelping and inspiring people I would\nlove to work as a coach in companies in\nthe future the problem I'm having is I\ndon't know how to get the skills I need\nto become a coach can I take this one\nand also I don't know how to really help\npeople I see it is my Dharma okay this\nis\nlike when you have somebody's attention\ndo not ask them something that you can\nGoogle yourself like do a little\nhomework before you ask kind of general\nquestions\nI I get this all the time where people\nare like I you know I want to apply for\na coach where do I do that like just\nlook on my website for like a second you\nknow like try and then when you if you\nemail me and you say I have looked at\nthe website I want to be a recovery\ncoach I think I have these\nskills would this be good that is going\nto go so much further but don't don't\nwaste somebody's time and attention on\non something you can easily\nGoogle I I I\nmean\nokay I think it's a legit question man\nlike hold on a second okay okay before\nyou roast this guy back to the Stone\nAge so he says I would love to work work\nas a coach in companies in the\nfuture like I don't think he want become\na coach yeah but he's not talking about\nnecessarily about us no that wasn't so\nwhat is he supposed to\nGoogle how to become a\ncoach okay let's Google\nit you want to screen share we are\nscreen\nshared oh hey\nit's the\nioc what are the requirements to become\na coach okay fair enough right like just\nGoogle things so if you guys um so this\nis this is where I sort of work so I'm\nfaculty at you know Harvard Medical\nSchool in mlan hospital and mlan has a\ncoaching Institute it's good SEO on\ntheir\npart okay\nfair\nfair okay so I'm going to try to answer\nthe question anyway because I remember\nwhat it was like to be that interesting\nhe's had an easy life he's had no major\nsuffering and he had a chance to get a\nreal question answered by\nyou so\nI I'm with you okay I'm I'm with you in\nthe sense that if you're asking someone\na question it really helps to do your\nhomework ahead of time because I get all\nkinds of like hairbrain questions and we\nanswer a [ __ ] ton of them and we\nprobably shouldn't fair enough but like\nI'll tell you guys this if you guys like\nask me a question if you have done\nthought or research like I'm going to be\nmuch more prone to help you than if it's\nlike something you could Google so I'm\nwith you there I'm I'm I'm with her um\nat the same time I think that like you\nknow becoming a coach is sort of it's\nlike sort of an unclear landscape right\nso so like I would say that if you want\nto help people and you want to become a\ncoach there are a lot of different\navenues that you can do so if you want\nto you know work with us you can sign up\nwith us but coaching is an emerging\nprofession you can go sort of the\npsychology route so you can become like\na therapist you can go to social work\nschool get a PhD become a medical doctor\nor a\npsychiatrist or you can go to uh\ninstitutes like The Institute of\ncoaching and there are different\nprograms like that are run by the ICF or\nInternational coaching Federation which\naccredits certain programs some of these\nthings are\nscams um and so you know that's how you\ncan become a coach I think if you want\nto help people that's awesome dude I\nthink you should help people um and you\nknow if you guys are interested in\nin\nyeah I don't know that's what I have to\nsay I feel like you were a little bit I\nme the guy's just trying to help people\nand he's like he's been giving he's been\ngiven everything in life so he doesn't\nknow how to Google things so I would say\nstart doing your own Google\nit's a good good answer good answer\nokay all right I may get get some hate I\nhave a well-paying job job is cool live\nin a foreign country I was bored of my\nhome country I'm grateful for my current\nsituation being raised by a single mom\nwasn't easy yet I feel stuck demotivated\nEtc I'm not sure why should I travel\nor yes\ntravel okay so I'm going to offer some\ngeneral advice because I think this is\nimportant if you guys feel a general\nlack of motivation you should maybe like\nwork with someone else to help you get\nto the bottom of that\n[ __ ] okay okay let her in let her in let\nher\n[Music]\nin Ruth is absolutely but she's got a\nbit though good catch twit\nchat genually\nimpressed where is that little\nbaby where's that little\nbaby babies are\nthere she was amazed because we have two\nthat's right there are two ofby babies\nwatch\nthis a is hey what happened to your up\nto your nose A is for she's got like all\nthese injuries yeah because her\nfingernails the\nmosquitoes Evie A is\nfor yeah okay no that didn't go anywhere\nall right so if you guys are struggling\nwith like a lack of motivation I I think\nit's not like you know I think it's\nworthwhile to spend some time exploring\nthat with someone so either see a\ntherapist or you know like find our\ncoach find a coach because like that's\nwhat we're trying to help people with\nand and try to get a sense of like why\nis it that you like I I want I want you\nguys to just look at this for a second\nokay\nso okay like so we're going to play game\ntwit chat and I want you guys to tell\nme what do you guys think this person\nwhat do you think this person should\ntalk about\nokay like why what should this person\nfocus on with a coach or a\ntherapist can you guys tell what the\nimportant sentences that may reveal the\nthe person's source of lack of\nmotivation\nhere what do you\nthink I think it might be he was bored\nin his home country so he went to a\nforeign country and is still kind of not\nfeeling something\nokay let me put it this way what\nstatement in this in this tweet is out\nof place and does not belong in the\nTweet by single mom\nbeautiful did you know Mommy\nright it's like why is that so I think\nyou've got to like dig into that so I\nwant you guys to understand that\nmotivation is is like an emergent thing\nright so like motivation happens when\nyou are functioning well if you guys\nhave psychological weights like\ninspiration happens when your mind is\nlike functioning well and you like have\nthe freedom to be inspired if you're\nworn down and you've been grinded to\nlike a nub like you can't be inspired\nright so so I want you guys to think a\nlittle bit about this if you guys are\nlacking motivation or inspiration you\nneed to really think about what is it\nthat grinds you down prevents you from\nlike finding like kindling that flame\nit's like a flame that gets extinguished\nby [ __ ] on top\nso you want me to take care of that I'm\nkind of trying to say something we can\nswitch in okay I'll finish and then I'll\ntake care of child okay so so if you're\nlacking motivation\nfirst first unburden yourself right like\nfirst like sort through like when you\nsay it was wasn't easy being raised by a\nsingle mom and you've done well go ahead\nand and work on that like think through\nthat like unburden yourself of that\nbecause you don't have to carry that\n[ __ ] around again and then once you're\nfree of that then you can fly like\nyou're not weighed down anymore like\ndon't be encumbered and move around at\n25% movement speed bro let go of that\nand then like motivational find you\nokay all right I think we're going to do\nI think those are the\ntweets\n[Music]\nso okay great thanks\nH qu in\nhere qu what's up\nccnc okay\nwhat are we doing we're doing I think\nwe're doing calls with\nMoses also no subtext on these questions\nI don't know what that means we're going\nto just call him let me switch to\nspeakers so you can hear I just realized\nthat all this time I've had headphones\non headphones\nhey do you want to do\nheal\nfirst uh it just depends on whether\npeople want me to be more inebriated or\nlesson rated during the healthcare\nrant so maybe poll number\nthree M ha is all in my face\nand can I bu that yes\nalways you want to see an emot emot Dr k\nno I've done this for them before Oh I\npopped my collar and was playing DOTA\nwith an Indian accent okay this is hero\nhero okay let's let's do good boy Dr K\nwhat good boy what are you doing to me\nI'm hting your ha are you taking away my\ndignity I don't know oh middle part yeah\noh God please not the middle\npart anything but the middle\npart twitchchat know our rule about\nfacial hair no but you can tell them if\nyou want to so I one time asked gruy if\nI could grow beard and she says if you\nget to grow it I get to grow\nit because Indian people are hairy\nincluding Indian\nwomen all right Moses what's up what's\non Deck\n[Music]\nrup actually ask\nquestion effectively working as a c that\nokay so a lot of things are going to\npiss you off like a\nlot and the things that you have to do\nis channel that anger\nproductively\nso like I would always get really\nfrustrated\nby process and inefficiency and like if\nsomebody says they're going to do\nsomething by Friday and then Friday at\nnoon um you know they're like can I I\njust need until Tuesday and you're like\nif you need tell Tuesday tell me like\nbefore the deadline so I would get\nreally frustrated um and I\nthink I think um the key to some of that\nfor me was saying like Okay this isn't\nworking how do we fix this this isn't\nworking how do we fix it and go from the\nperson that's just yelling at everybody\nto the person that is like not afraid to\nfix the stupid problems that nobody else\nwants to F can anybody hear me or is\nthis just busted no I think you're\naudible I think the sound was can they\nhear me now I think they should be able\nto hear me I fixed it that is right that\nis more the P the guffa in me is just\nlike oh there's too much to do I'm gonna\njust go to sleep and for that I'm not\neven kidding changing my diet helped me\nbecome I'm more ftha now than I was gffa\nbecause I eat way more meat and way less\nDairy than I used to um I also eat like\nconsistently spicy foods but that has\ndefinitely put me more in the ftha\ncategory but I'm way more productive\nthis way um but like when I have a more\nguffa heavy diet like I just want to veg\nout watch my shows I'm not really\nmotivated and it's that's frustrating\nfor the fifth side of me because I have\nmy task list in my head for everything\nthat I need to\ndo so if you're Kaa dominant I would\nwatch your diet and if you're btha if\nyou're btha\ndominant move that anger into being\nproductive like what can I fix instead\nof like what sucks about\neveryone can I share something that I I\nthink uh so I think the other thing\nabout gfab Bas is that they sit on their\nanger right so gaffas tend to propagate\nlonger situations that are bad because\nof their inherent resilience so so it's\nlike gfas because of their High HP pool\ncan just sit there in Poison yeah and\njust take damage every turn and they're\nlike yeah I got a big HP pool so I don't\nneed to move anytime soon yep so kaap do\nfeel anger but then also like sit in it\nfor a while and that like as they stew\nso they like let things like build up\nand stew and it gets worse and worse and\nworse and worse and worse and then they\nlike explode so really try to process\nwhat's happening to you throughout the\nday and like work on it more\nproactively what's next Moses cool um do\nyou have any tips for how to ask for a\nraise no none for\nyou that's why I said these questions\ndon't have Subs it's important for our\naudience okay never ask for a\nraise um all right if you have really um\nI think it's important for for you to\nconstantly demonstrate your\nvalue without asking for a raise so when\npeople are like when you do ask for a\nraise there's all this value that you've\ncontributed so a couple of my favorite\nways to do this are to send subject line\nemails so things like the subject line\nis we just crossed 100K and then I would\nbe the boss right and I would forward\nthat to everyone and say like yes we\nwere doing it and then you know they see\nwhere that came from or send emails that\nare like um coaching program is live and\nI see where that came from or you know\njust got a big content partnership deal\nlike and like tell us tell tell us what\nyou're\ndoing um and your boss will see the\ndollar figures attached to that like\nsaved this amount of money got this\namount of Revenue saved this amount of\nlike you know man hours and whatever\nprocess it was and I yes clickbait in\nreal life do that [ __ ] um because your\nboss is going to forward it to their\nboss and I think the extent to which you\ncan make your boss's life easier is\ngoing to be the extent to which your\nboss is going to go to bat for you and\nwhen you ask for a raise don't position\nit as asking for raise position it as\nyour future at this\ncompany yeah so I I'm going to presume\nfor a second that we're not talking\nabout our relationship with\nMoses yeah and and so so it's it's a\ngood question right like how do you ask\nfor a race these are just like real\nexamples I don't I don't know what you\nguys do I don't know what your living\nsituations are so so here's what I'd say\nso a lot of times you have a job\ndescription and what I like what I think\nyou should do so like generally speaking\nthe way that you ask for a raise is you\nhave a performance review on a certain\namount of time and there's a separate uh\ndiscussion about like accelerating\nperformance reviews so you can ask for\nraises earlier but let's assume that you\nhave a performance review once a year so\nhere's the way that you ask for a raise\nso you take a list of your job what\ndon't listen to do not ask for a raise\nin your performance review okay fine so\nhere fine let I think my point still\nstands okay um so here's what I think\nyou should do like often times your your\nbosses will like when you get hired for\na job there's like a job description\nright so I'm like talking about\ngenerally speaking like a corporate or\nwell\nstructured organization so they have\nlike\nprocesses for performance reviews and\nraises and usually what happens if you\nwork for like a middle manager like they\nhave to get the raises approved by the\nupper managers so so what you want to do\nis you want to take your job and so\nbasically for you to get a raise you\nneed to be able to make a strong case\nand furthermore equip your direct report\nto make a strong case for their direct\nreport right cuz like they have to clear\nthe raises by their boss so that's sort\nof what I'm assuming so if that\nstructure doesn't apply to you then like\nyou know take this with a grain of salt\nso when you get hired for a job you've\ngot a job description so you take that\njob description and you put it in a Word\ndocument and then like as you're\nthroughout the year you're going to do a\nlot of things that are outside of that\njob description and the week that you do\nthem you make a note of it so you keep\nthat in a do doent and you kind of say\nlike okay this week like my job\ndescription is to you know filter\npatients through the Ed and on this week\nthis person was like missing so I ended\nup doing this work and then I ended up\ndoing this work and EV eventually you\nsort of end up doing things that are\noutside of your job description and I\nthink when guuy says demonstrate your\nvalue to the company the key thing is\nthat when you do that you should keep\ntrack of it yes right I'm not saying you\nshould get taken advantage of by the man\nI'm saying if you do something for the\nman that the man is not paying you for\nyou write it down somewhere right the\nman owes you this is his tab so the next\nthing that you do is in terms of the\nstuff that you do for your job\ndescription you write down how you have\nexecuted on that with as many numbers as\npossible so so what you do is you kind\nof say like okay here are the first six\nmonths of where I worked where we\nprocessed 50 patients in a 4-Hour period\nin the emergency room after I came on\nwe've processed 56 patients in a 4-Hour\nperiod in the emergency room and then\nwhat happens when you go into your\nperformance review you have everything\nlaid down and then you take your\ndocument and then you like trim it up\nand you clean it up and you say hey I\nthink I deserve and if you don't do this\nduring the performance review that's\nfine yeah I I don't know anything about\nthat but then you go to them and you say\nlike here are the reasons why I believe\nlike I'm doing like I deserve more money\nand then if they say oh yeah we're sorry\nwe can't pay you and then you turn\naround and you ask them the question so\nI just want to\nunderstand in the future I did all of\nthese extra things in the future so it\nsounds like you guys can't afford me to\npay for this stuff so help me understand\nif you want me to continue doing this\nstuff in the future is it a part of my\njob or is it not a part of my job so in\nthe future if you ask me to do something\nand it's not a part of my job or I'm not\ngetting compensated for it like do I\nhave the right to say no it's kind of a\ndickish move you can piss some of your\nbosses off but I'm a little bit tipsy\nand I think like you should lay it out\nto them that you are doing work that\nyou're not getting compensated exited\nfor or rewarded for when you do it well\nyeah and and just lay it out for them\nand just be like okay so like like you\nguys are asking me to do stuff that's\nnot a part of my job so I just want to\nunderstand are you expecting me to do\nthis going forward because it's not a\npart of my job and then you put it to\nthem you're not saying like I'm not\ngoing to do it you're not throwing a\nhissy fit you're just asking them to\nlike put their money down on whether\nyou're doing something extra or\nnot the the people that I know that have\ngotten\nthe best raises um are the people that\nconsistently demonstrate their value and\nit's never surprise when they ask for\nmore if you if the performance review is\nthe first time that you ask for a raise\nthat budget is already gone right your\nyour supervisor should have seen it\ncoming should know your value should\nhave already made that case for you and\nyour performance review should basically\nbe the closure the final step to\nsolidify by whatever that raise is good\nadvice and I also think that asking for\ntitle bumps is probably going to be more\neffective than a raise so if you are\njust wanting a raise right that means I\nwant more money to do the same thing but\nif you want a different title that's\nwhen the stuff that Al is talking about\ncomes into play I'm also doing this I'm\nalso doing this I'm doing a lot of this\nI'm doing it well it's bringing in value\nI think my title should include that I\nthink this would be the approp roate\nlike salary\nbump and then you can go from there so\nshe brings up a really good point like\nso I think the other thing is that you\nsay that like in terms of the title bump\nthe way you justify it is that you know\nyou kind of say that like I'm doing\nthings that are actually not a part of\nmy job description so I don't I would\nlike a title that's commens do them yep\nand and so like what you're asking your\nboss to do is just lay out like let's\nget all all on the same page about what\nI'm doing for you and what I'm not doing\nfor for you and what I'm paying what\nyou're paying me for and what you're not\npaying me for and then let's get on the\nsame page about like are you are you\ngoing to start paying me for this stuff\nand if you're not going to start paying\nfor me like you're not allowed to be\nupset if I stop doing it or no longer\ncare about doing it well I think I think\nthere's a distinction to be made there\nbecause every company wants somebody\nthat's going to fill in the gaps and be\nhappy to fill in those gaps those are\nthe most valuable people in any company\nbut people that do that and then\nwithhold it I I don't personally want\naround right because that means that you\nwere a team player and now you're greedy\nand now you're not so I would say how\ncan we get my compensation structure to\nlet me be the most valuable to you guys\nbecause right now I'm only bonused if I\ndo this so that means that if I could\nsupport you know this department which\nmakes more money but you're only\ncompensating me to support this other\ndepartment I I feel like that's not in\nthe best interest of the company I think\nthat is going to get you a lot further\nand the other thing that you have to do\nyou have to do is impress your boss's\nboss and that person is going to be the\nperson that approves the budget for your\nraise that is why the subject line\nemails are so important because your\nboss when you send that to them they're\ngoing to forward it to his or her boss\nright so then that your boss's boss is\ngonna see oh Al's doing such a great job\nhe pulled in a 100K for this fundraising\nmonth he has you\nknow stayed sober on two out of three\nstreams this month um he you know\nwhatever like then if I send that out to\nlike whoever we don't have any overlords\nthank God right now\num but when you send that out you know\npotentially all would get a\nraise would you like a raise well I\ndon't get a salary so be nice to make a\nsingle dollar you will not I mean I\ndon't send me an email can I have like I\ndon't even want to raise can I just get\na salary\nno let's start there okay how about a\ndollar or another drink maybe we'll see\nno can I actually have another no I have\nbrought you mint I have brought you\noranges I have brought you ice I have\nbrought you a drink but you don't pay me\nanything okay pay myself anything get me\na drink okay I'll get you a drink you\nbut you make them better than I no you\njust sit what did you call it Devil's\ndiabetes it was delicious oh okay all\nright is anybody else seeing\nthis oh but you know what you should get\ndrinks with your boss socialize let them\nget to know you as a person let them let\nthem in be invested in your life and\nyour success also have children with\nthat no that's how you get them invested\nin your life and your success you want\nto raise hey everyone GNA raise just get\nyour boss pregnant except for you\nnothing that's the way that you the way\nthat you tie your boss and your future\ntogether is by having children with them\nMoses we're gonna need an HR\nprofessional uh you need more than\nthat okay oh wait do you really want me\nto make you drink because I don't know\nhow you make these they're so good pour\nthe wine bottle over for you yeah\nokay are you sure you want yes please I\nlove you\nso all right I will be\nback also just beg for [ __ ] just beg\njust beg if they say no or if they say\nit's your turn just\nbag and put on your puppy puppy dog ears\neyes whatever okay no really her her\ndrinks are better than mine i' just be\npouring her a bottle of wine it's okay\ngrat I got her something can I show you\nwhat I got\nher oh wait are they gone oh they're\ngone\nwhat I didn't say anything all right\nwhat's the next\nquestion where you going show them the\npackage huh where are you showing them\nthe package I can't I can't tell cuz I\ncan't see anything yeah I'm going to I'm\ngoing to show them what I got her oh\nokay I mean you can just do that\nfirst oh be careful about the address\nyou know on the thing yeah there's going\nto be no matter oh\nokay I'll open it down here\nI this GL wait people are saying Lily no\noh that's cool wait how did you make it\nso\nfast nothing I'm doing\nnothing oh hello Lily how are\nyou she put ice in\nit nothing nothing nothing you have a\njanky fridge that like you have to use\nlike the freezer TR is for right now wa\nsay say hi to Lily she is in our chat\nhey Lily how are\nyou how you doing\nLily oh she's in our chat I'm like\nwaiting for her\nvoice\nLily thank you so much for kicking this\noff girl you don't even know what You'\nstarted this is amazing Lily was our\nfirst\ndonation so thank you very much\nLily okay\nall right so what's next\nMoses\num did you guys ask like questions about\nlosing your passion for your\njob losing your passion for your job\nyeah people that have had zero passion\nto begin with\ndang yeah I mean so we can talk about\nlosing your passion so I think I've\ncertainly lost my passion for especially\nwhen you go from startup stage to\ncorporate Overlord stage that happens a\nlot I lost my passion during this\nstream so here's the thing to remember\nright so if you lose your passion you\nhave to look at what other psychological\nthings could be going on that prevent\nyou from like feeling the passion that\nyou first felt so like let's just say\nhypothetically that you were a producer\nfor a twitch stream and then you tossed\nout a a crazy promise that if if you\nraised $100,000 over the course of a\nmonth that you would go on an eatee and\nthen once that that absolute fiction\nbecomes a reality like it can have a\npsychological consequence that would\nresult in in maybe you losing your\npassion hey am I supposed to take this\nquestion\nseriously yes joking as because Z and I\nare not going take it seriously right\nI'm I'm getting this drink you under the\ntable I don't want to you've been able\nto drink the whole reason we're together\ntoday is because you drunk me under the\ntable 16 years ago 17 17 years\nago okay what's the question 17 years\nago in\nAugust got some big anniversaries coming\nup you know that right yep okay that's\nwhat the box is\nfor oh sweetie yeah I was showing them\nyour gift because I have to wrap it\nproperly cuz cardboard boxes apparently\ndon't aren't sufficient oh my God this\nwrapping you guys I'll take a picture\nI'll show it to you guys all right so\nwhat are we\ndoing oh wait answer the question like\nwhat what do you do after you lost your\npassion how do you get it back or what\nlike how do you recover I guess yeah so\nI think the three strikes rule is good\nlike give give yourself and the company\nthree chances to get it back and like\nyou got a specify what that is\nso as an example I was really passionate\nabout this startup that was basically um\nlike in bar entertainment in like trivia\nquestions and stuff like that so if you\nlike go to a happy hour um this was in\nAustin it was a really fun little\ncompany that essentially what they were\ntrying to do was sell in\nsponsorships to people who wanted to\nreach bars and restaurants it's like\nkind of complicated but\nessentially it was really fun the\nculture was really fun the product was\nsupposed to be fun we were supposed to\nbe essentially entertaining people at\nthe bar who like you know just to kind\nof pass the time while they were there\num and then it got Acquired and the\nintegration was painful the kind of new\ncorporate structure was painful the\ncompany became um very much\nabout revenue and recurring Revenue and\nso they wanted to take this thing that\nto me was very creative and very fun and\nmake it predictable and recurring and\nprocess oriented and so I\ndefinitely\num I definitely lost my passion for like\nthe creative side and what I found\nwas I wasn't going to do this for\npennies anymore so I\nnegotiated um a relocation bonus and a\ntitle change that basically doubled my\nsalary and doubled my\noptions um and came with a relocation\nbonus and then like for that I basically\ngot to move my career to New York City\nand that was super exciting so that was\nlike a way to kind of reignite my\ninvolvement in\nthere but I think just give yourself a\nchance and give the company a chance to\nfind the right place for you\nis that good enough yeah I think that\nwas good all right um someone was kind\nof asking you about having the mental\nfortitude to drive like through like\nfailing in college and being successful\nmedical school and they referred to like\ngetting rejected main times but like how\ndo you actually deal with getting\nrejected because people sent out like\n100 over 100 like job applications they\ndon't hear back right so like how do you\ndeal with just like that essentially so\nthere is a there is actually a cheat\ncode for\nthat which is that you don't send out a\n100 job applications you haven't sent\nout a job 100 job applications you just\nsend out one job application at a time\nthe cheat code to dealing to having the\nfortitude to get through rejection is\nthat you don't look at the long term you\njust look at the short term you look at\nevery application on its\nown the first application is no\ndifferent from the second which is no\ndifferent from the third which is no\ndifferent from the fourth which is no\ndifferent from the fifth which is no\ndifferent from the h\n100th so I'm not saying that you\nshould ignore data but I'm saying when\nit comes to filling out a job\napplication that's all you should do\nwhen you fill out 100 job applications\nand you get rejected from 100 of them\nthen you should sit down with that data\nwith a clear head and change your\nstrategy but when it comes to filling\nout the 101st changing your strategy\nshould inform the way that you do the\n100 in first but you don't think about\nthe 100 that you've lost\nbefore right does that make\nsense\nright like because really what's the\ndifference between the 99th and the\n101st job\napplication right like yeah I'm not\nsaying you should ignore evidence but at\nthe same time don't let your past\nfailures weigh you down like every game\nof DOTA that you play is different it's\na new game of DOTA it's not affected by\nand so this is actually forget about\nDOTA for a second so you know if I flip\na coin and it's like heads five times in\nthe row in a row what's the likelihood\nit's heads on the sixth\ntime\nMoses 50%\nABS I actually okay cool right so what's\nthe likelihood that you you get five\nheads in a row over six\nflips it's like one one divid two to the\nsixth power right so like don't confuse\neach coin flip with the pattern of 1 / 2\nto the 6th pound that's the way that you\nget through it\nI also think that changing your strategy\nis key here um if don't fall for traps\ndo not compete in things you cannot win\nso what you did was up and move to\nBoston start knocking on doors yep and\nthat was way better than filling out you\nknow your 170th job application because\nyou knew that wasn't a race right so I\napplied for 130 jobs and didn't got one\ninterview in a city that I wasn't\nwilling to move to and then like\ndesperate times called for desperate\nmeasures so I just moved to Boston with\na suitcase and then like tried to make\nsomebody saying traps everywhere and I\nwant to say yes there are traps [ __ ]\neverywhere don't fall for them there are\ntraps for your time for your money for\nthe way you go about your life don't\nfall for them don't do it hey some dude\ndoated 500 100 bucks after we hit our\ngoal strong work M thank you it's all\nfor Gabe at this point but thank\nyou all right uh Moses what's next oh\nfollowup questions like did you guys\nhave tips for like kind of getting your\nfoot in the door\nfor like a job yes go for it\n[Music]\num you want to network with people that\nbefore you have something that you want\nto ask you want to build relationships\nbefore you ask for something you never\nwant to send an email or you know make a\nphone call or send a slack or DM or\nwhatever it is that you guys do you\ndon't want to do that and say like hey\nsuch a big fan love what you do can I\nblah blah blah don't ask for something\nin your first communication ever you\nalways want to offer that you're there\nand like the the people that I rely on\nas mentors I know one day I will be\ncalling in a favor but the thing is I\nthink one day they're going to call in\nfavors with me too and even if the power\nDynamic is um you know they big shits\nwherever they are and I'm kind of this\nrecent graduate doing this funky thing\num there there are levels of expertise\nyou can offer just because of being who\nyou are and knowing what you know and\nthat that's not necessarily going to be\nconventional wisdom and certainly not\ngoing to be business\nadvice so I'd say like if you want to\nget your foot in the door like do your\nhomework yes so I get all kinds I'm\ntempted to even just read going back to\nlike Google your [ __ ] before you ask\nyour question like don't roast people no\nno I'm not GNA roast people do Moses do\nyou think it's okay if I read like one\nor two lines of an email\nuh without identifying the person this\nis actual an email that I\ngot yeah maybe I have to be able to find\nit because I got hundreds of these but I\nmean I get emails that are like have you\never thought about doing something on\nyou know motivation and it's like yes I\nrealized you know what I'm like I never\nthought about that exactly well like\nhave you thought about you know doing\nsomething and it's just like the most\nbasic amount of homework\nokay I I can't find um the email but\nlike I got an email once from a dude who\nlike kind of said hey why don't we spend\nsome time talking I'm a smart guy why\ndon't we spend some time talking and\nthen I can tell you how I can help\nyou right and I was like [ __ ] like that\nall the\ntime like he didn't lay out like what\nhis skills are and it's like why the\n[ __ ] would I spend an hour of my time\ntelling you about what my my needs are\nso that you can start to make a case to\ntell me how you can help me the two main\nways you can help somebody or by saving\nthem time or saving them money like in\nthe business\nworld so do not send somebody a\ncommunication that is going to cost them\ntime or money send them a communication\nthat said hey I saw that you're trying\nto do this thing I came across whatever\ndon't just [ __ ] link them the article\nand make them read the damn thing just\nbe like\nI think you should do this reference\nhere boil things down be the person\nthat's going to save them time and money\nand they'll respect your opinion for it\nand say hey I'm thinking about doing\nthis thing what do you think so Dr jyn\nsays hi can I has job please that's\nactually better than what the email I\ngot was yeah the email that I got was\nlike why don't you invest your time in\nhelping me figure out how what kind of\njob I can apply for in your company\nit's like what the [ __ ] man so like the\nthe emails that I respond well to are to\nthe people that have done their homework\nlike sometimes I'll get emails from my\ncollege kids and they'll be like hey\nlike I've watched your stream I learned\na b and c and I'm trying to do X Y and Z\nand it's clear to me that they've done\ntheir homework and then I feel like\nhelping the kid because it's like if\nyou've done your homework like I I love\nto help because I remember when I was\nlike you know didn't have anyone to help\nme and like I'm not going to spend my\ntime figuring out how to help someone\nbut if someone comes to me with a\nspecific question I'm going to do my\nbest to help them right right and if\nit's like like people will and I I sort\nof like you know with the clients that I\nwork with we talk about how to do this\nright so how to do your homework so that\nlike there's a huge difference between\ntelling someone hey can you help me\nfigure out my life and laying out in a\nshort amount like I don't want to read\nlike a page because I don't have time\nfor that [ __ ] but hey I've done XYZ this\nis the specific problem that I'm I'm\nrunning into can you help me with ABC\nthat's how you get your way in the door\nso for the people that have worked with\nus there are people that have offered us\nlike specific assistance with things\nthat we may need it's someone who says\nHey like the way that you get I love\nyour content I'm a big fan I've learned\nABC if you guys ever need help with dot\ndot dot this specific task please let me\nknow and that person goes into a\nspecific folder they go into a very\nspecific folder of like [ __ ] that at\nsome point when we need that's the first\nperson that we're going to email right\nbecause they get us they understand us\nthey know what we're trying to do and we\nknow what they can do like if you want\nto get your foot in the door somewhere\npeople have to know like what they're\nbringing in like sure you get your foot\nin the door but like why would I invite\nyou in if you're like hey man if you\never need help setting up your Thor like\ngive me a call and it's like absolutely\nman so like you set your foot in the\ndoor and then it's like if I need help\nwith getting my thunder like I've got a\nguy okay I might be checking those\nemails but yes so the way that you get\nyour foot in the door is by\ndemonstrating first of all that you know\nwhat the [ __ ] these people are doing\nsecondly by offering a particular way in\nwhich you can assist them and gruy said\nit brilliantly you either offer them\nlike you either either save them money\nor you save them\ntime and\nthen like you kind of go from there I\nwould also encourage you guys to just\nlook at um some of the big losers and\ngainers on like the S&P the NASDAQ like\nyou're going to see who needs help right\nnow and you're going to be able to see\nlike here let's just do\nit pull out my Yahoo\nfinance all right the losers on mine\nright now are JetBlue and\nSouthwest let's\nsee okay all right foot in the Thor nice\ndelicious baked foot yes roasted foot\nbut you're going to see like some of the\ncom I don't know I don't know if this is\ngoing to be helpful but\num if you look at like kind of who's\nwinning and losing in the market you'll\nsee who who the companies are and\nthere're going to be people that have\nlike nobody has ever heard of right so\nthere's going to be some companies that\nare hot that a lot of people are\nemailing look for the ones that are less\nsexy because nobody's emailing them and\nyou're going to have a way higher chance\nof getting your foot in the door with\nthem yeah I mean I I think the main\nthing is like a lot of people are trying\nto get the foot in the door so the thing\nis that you have to think put yourself\nin the shoes of the person who owns the\ndoor or and ask yourself like what could\nthey possibly want that I can give them\nand be really specific about it and\ndon't start your email apologizing do\nyou need\nsomething okay hello take care\nof\nokay\num poo mom absolutely what's Zack are we\nshould we move to Texas a speech man\nyeah there's actually

highly\nrecommend that you see a therapist about\nyour problems or work with one of our\ncoaches like and drive your therapy\nabsolutely well put right so like if\nthere's something that you're

much uja uja icbe\ndonated $100 Thank you very very much\nfor everything that you do what am I\ndoing 14 donated 75 bucks I feel like\nit's close enough honestly all of the\ndonations are awesome yeah seriously\nlike we we feel an obligation to call\nout some of the higher donors but the\nthing that I'm happiest about Moses do\nyou have the number of like how\nmany um small donations there have been\nthat's actually the number I'm happiest\nabout yeah so I'm just going to read a $\nfive doll donation question if that's\nokay for everyone you've been probably\nask this so don't do this [ __ ] do not\npreface your email or whatever with an\napology for however busy they are it\njust takes more time to read through it\nso you've probably been asked this\nquestion before but overall do you think\npsychologists are better at\nPsychotherapy or psychiatrists honestly\nprobably well so the the evidence is\nthat I don't think that either one is\nbetter I think that's actually what the\ndata shows that the outcomes from social\nworkers psychologists and psychiatrists\nare about the same if you actually look\nat the\ntraining psychologists are better\ntrained post training\nat therapy than psychiatrists are the\nhours of training that psychologists get\nfor therapy is probably greater than the\nhours of training that psychiatrists\nget um psychiatrists get a lot more\ndiverse training right so like we learn\nhow to treat heart attacks and deal with\nstrokes and like deal with physical\nproblems which psychologists don't get\npsych huh wrapping ankles wrapping\nankles yeah somewh you\nknow so so but I I think the main thing\nthat if you really look at the data it\nsuggests that generally speaking like 10\nyears out the difference between a\nsocial worker a psychologist and a\npsychiatrist is not really that clear um\na couple of things to remember is that\ngenerally speaking and I don't like I\ndon't mean to be insightful here but um\nlike isn't inciting bad feelings but I I\nthink that generally speaking it is\nharder to become a psychiatrist than it\nis to become a psychologist or social\nworker so it's it's easiest to become a\nsocial worker harder to become a\npsychologist and harder to become a\npsychiatrist some people can make the\nargument that because it is more\ndifficult that speaks to some amount of\ndiscipline\nor intellect or what some combination of\nall of the above that in theory makes\npsychiatrists more cap capable but I\nwill be the first to say that I worked\nwith very competent psychiatrists very\ncompetent psychologists in incredibly\ncompetent social workers and I have\nworked with incompetent social workers\nincompetent psychiatrists and\nincompetent psychologists so I think the\nindividual person W matters way more\nthan the degree this is true in life do\nnot trust the credentials trust the\nperson but also recognize that\ncredentials mean something right very\nspecific thing don't use it as a\nshortcut in an end all be\nall\num so Anonymous has donated $100 thanks\na lot Alis\n4,926 93 shushana 301 thanks a lot low\nDPM\n10,000\num my cool man is trolling us with his\n$361 donation here's the rest of my co\ncheck SpaghettiOs money thank you for\nhelping so many people you're probably\nhelping yourself by not spending all of\nyour Co money on SpaghettiOs\nTBH although eat some fruit when I was\nin high school SpaghettiOs thinn it out\na little bit a little bit that parmesan\ncheese a lot of black pepper a little\nbit of red pepper not too\nbad uh so Angie donates $10 and asks\nlove everything you're doing here though\nwill it be possible for non- US citizens\nto become in training coaches anytime\nsoon absolutely so like in\nour soon I don't know but like depends\non where you are every country is a\nlittle bit different yeah and we want to\nroll it out basically we want to roll\nout internationally as fast as possible\nwe have to do it kind of Step by Step so\nit's not necessarily we flip the\ninternational switch but we kind of have\nto flip this which is strategically for\nthe countries that are most business\nfriendly where we don't have have to\nlike set up like whole new locus of\nbusiness it's just yeah so the thing\nthat you guys have to remember out\nInternational is like we have to go to\neach country that we want to operate in\nand comply with all of the legal stuff\nwhich involves paying lawyers to figure\nout what the laws are and then go\nthrough the process of complying with\nall their stuff right also we have to\nget our own systems to comp it's yes we\nwant to expand internationally that's\nthe mission and like we've already moved\nHeaven and Earth to get people who don't\nget it to support this um to pay you\nknow our coaches that are abroad already\nto figure this out um and we will\ncontinue to because it's important and I\nfeel like the rest of the world needs to\ncatch up so we have an international\nFocus from day one yeah right so like we\neven moved our streaming times to be\nmore EU friendly right and we're doing a\ndond door stream instead of a barbecue\nstream and and so we definitely want to\nlike we recognize that like mental\nhealth is not like an American problem\nlots of jokes can be made there lots of\ndigs can be made there but um you know\nso we want to do it it's just like we're\npretty committed to offering a high\nquality and aboveboard service so if\nyou're a coach from a foreign country we\nwant you to be able to like legally get\npaid and like not get in trouble with\nyour government because we're doing\nsomething Shady Shady off the side and\nlike sending you money by PayPal which\nhonestly when it was just the two of us\nwas fine was fine we did you know we\ndon't want to get like but now it's your\nmoney you know I don't want to be like\narrested when I fly to a country and I\nlike walk into the airport and there's a\nwarrant because of like tax evasion in\nyour country or some [ __ ] yeah we really\nlike to travel we'd like not to be yeah\nreally traveled in years but yeah toino\nSheen thanks for the $100 donation thank\nyou Dr k for everything you do you're\nmost welcome bro thank you for your\nsupport\num watermelon donated five bucks I'm\njust going to call this out French date\nget your pogs Out Boys POG champ I don't\neven know what that means French date\ntell you half this [ __ ] doesn't make any\nsense that's me okay so Lord shuku for\n$10 donation training the coaches do you\nhave in mind LGBT people as common\nvictims of the status quo and how to\nmake the sessions a safe space like\nusing the proper pronouns and things\nlike that I I know this is going to\nsound weird but the answer is yes and no\nso my biggest experience with human\nbeings is that like what brings us\ntogether is way more common than what\ndivides us so I like working with people\noffice no no it's like a political thing\nbut it's not it's like it's like the\nInsel thing like why do we keep on\nhaving fake Insel you're right it's\nbecause they're not like incel is not\nlike a real thing like you can call\nyourself an incel and sure you can\nidentify with that but at the end of the\nday I fundamentally believe that we're\nall [ __ ]\nhuman and whether you're a man trapped\nin a woman's body or a woman trapped in\na woman's body or a man trapped in a\nman's body I'm not saying that your\nexperiences of Life aren't different and\nthat like you suffer in unique ways\nbased on your gender based on your\nethnicity based on your minority status\nbased on your socioeconomic class I'm\nnot saying that that is not\ndifferent but like the whole point of\nour coaching program\nis for us to treat everyone the same yes\nright and if that involves like if it\ninvolves accommodations for specific\npeople absolutely if your experience of\nlife makes it different for you to\ninteract in the world that's absolutely\nsomething that we want to understand but\nhere's the crazy thing I don't think\nthat we standardize that\nteaching the way we're training our\ncoaches is to acknowledge that each\nperson that you meet is an individual\nand not judge them based on their LGBT\ndon't judge them based on their Religion\nDon't Judge them based on their\nethnicity don't judge them based on\ntheir country of origin or their\ncapacity to speak English treat them\nlike a human being meet them as a human\nbeing and don't Define them as LGBT to\nbegin with\nright and so like in a sense do we have\nLGBT specific education like not really\nand maybe that's something that we need\nto work on and like I'm open if if\npeople think that that's a problem by\nall means like let us know and we'll try\nto do better I'm not saying that I'm\nright I'm just sharing with you what is\nmy internal Compass like when an LGBT\nperson comes into my\noffice I treat them as a human being and\nwhen they say like if you guys don't\nknow what this is like so like I I one\ntime had a transgender patient that like\nblew my mind and I talked to them for a\nwhile and I realized like oh this is\nwhat it means to be transgender and if\nyou guys want to understand what it\nmeans to be a transgender person I've\ngot a great exercise for you so if\nyou're a man works I think better for\nmen or that's what I can identify or\nunderstand better if you guys want to\nhear it's like a really interesting\nexercise if you're a\nman get some articles of women's\nclothing and put them\non like put on high heels put on a dress\nand put on makeup and if you feel really\n[ __ ] uncomfortable with no one else\nin the room now you know what a\ntransgender person feels\nlike because every day when a\ntransgender person wakes up and they put\non those clothes they feel the way that\nyou do in lipstick and high\nheels right so like I arrived at that\nunderstanding not by treating this\nperson as different but by genuinely\nasking this person what is your like\nwhat is your experience of the world and\nI think whether you've got a Abus of\nparents or single parents or you grew up\nin this country or that country or\nyou're transgender we have to start by\ntraining our coaches with the ethos of\ntry to meet this person where there's at\nand don't assume because I think this is\na really big problem don't assume that\njust because they're LGBT you understand\nthem because you went through the LGBT\ncurriculum right an LGBT person is not\ndefined by their LGBT status or\nlgbtq like should you appreciate that\nshould you appreciate that this\nperson's experience of life has been\ntraumatic because the society that they\nbring that they live in doesn't allow\nthem to be who they are absolutely you\nshould appreciate that but I think it's\nactually a disservice to our coaches and\na disservice to our population if a\nCoach checks a box in their mind in\nterms of who you are and then starts\napplying a protocol of a script about\nhow you treat these people I think\nthey're actually doing you a\ndisservice you're a person and your\nexperiences are unique and I know this\nis kind of a mindblowing like Revelation\nbut not all lgbtq people have the same\nexperience of\nlife like wow that's crazy\nman treat them as individuals and that's\nwhat we try to\ndo that assumption is\ndevastating it it really is and I think\nthere are good reasons for that\nassumption sometimes right so like I\nthink that like anyway we can get into\nlike I don't think that the lgbtq\nmovement is bad I see this with like\nwomen's stuff too people are like oh\nyou're a woman blah blah blah apply for\nthe women's Venture Capital funds do the\nwomen in MBA stuff I'm like [ __ ] you and\nyour tiny slice of the pie I'm part of\nthe whole\nthing don't don't relegate people to a\nslice of the pie if they're like just\nand everybody is part of the whole\nthing okay so shushu Pana said donated\n$1,000 also been a Serial support of the\nstream almost there t term $234 56 good\nluck Moses vote\nyeah um Moses are you nervous how are\nyou feeling\nso am I nervous about tomorrow the E\ndate is the E tomorrow\nno I was like that's a long time to put\ntogether a biodata like Moses we have to\nsearch the internet we have to figure\nout our high school\nGPA yeah so stopka uh 32 with the\ndonation of 200 bits I'm just starting\nmy search for mental health professional\ndo you have any advice as to how I\nshould start my search yeah so I think\nthe main thing to remember about finding\nmental health professional so you can\nuse like websites like Psychology today\nor whatever if you're in the US you can\nalso talk to your like your doctor and\nand ask for referrals so those are two\nmain areas the one thing I would really\ncaution you guys to remember is that\nmental health professionals are about\nfit so if you don't like one it's not\nthat you don't like therapy it's just\nthat you don't like that therapist so\ntry a\ncouple so Brawl online $100 thanks for\nthe uh here this is this is a donation\nstream now money laundering\nPOG okay\num and uh okay so the last word I've\nbeen practicing third eye medit for $100\ndonation I've been practicing third eye\nmeditation for every day for about three\nweeks and has done wonders on me but I\nwas wondering if there were any\nProgressive steps or higher levels to\nthe laser beam I should do or if it it's\nalways the same thing love you both\nthey're absolutely different levels dude\nthat's just level one man there's like\nway more levels to third ey aakra sad\nwhich means third ey spiritual\ntechniques unfortunately I don't teach\nthose on stream because of you know\nsafety concerns because they can be\npowerful why are you typing this is It's\nYour I'm trying to because they're\nalways like what are you\n[Music]\nsaying yeah there are more Advanced\nTechniques\num\nso yeah so we're going to have to think\na little so like I think you know if we\ndo something I know you guys don't like\nthe retreat but like I I want to teach\nmore advanced meditation but I I don't\nwant to do that on stream because it\nreally I've been taught that it can be\ndangerous and there's scientific\nevidence that doing like meditation\nwithout being prepared can be like\nmentally damaging so you know if you if\nyou've done our stuff fantastic\nhopefully you can find a teacher for\nmore advanced practices and at some\npoint we may start teaching that\nstuff um legendary pancake I have bad\nanxiety and my girlfriend has bad\ndepression and relies on me for most of\nher happiness I love her a [ __ ] lot it's\nbeen a a bit better since we started\ntalking about it but my anxiety tells me\nto end the relationship almost every day\nwhat what do I do so I I think it's\nimportant to remember that like a good\nrelationship is\nnot doesn't involve just\nlove right so a good relationship has to\nhave two human beings who can adequately\nsupport each other and I've been working\nrecently with a patient of mine about\nsomeone that they are very much love\nwith and\nlike the the takeaway from that patient\nis that you guys may be right for each\nother just not right now yes right so\nlike I think it's hard for you to have a\nhealthy relationship with someone who is\nreliant on you if you don't have the\nstrength to be their Rock and I don't\nthink you should blame yourself for not\nhaving the strength to be their Rock\nbecause sometimes people need you to be\na bigger Rock than you can be or even\nthat can exist\nright sometimes like if you have\ncodependent\nrelationships their strength needs to\ncome from them and can't come endlessly\nfrom you that's not actually good for\nthem so I'd say continue talking and\nlike recognize that like you know and\nrelies on me for most of her happiness\nthat's got to change because you can't\nbe responsible for most of someone's\nhappiness over the course of an entire\nrelationship right she's got to take\nindiv idual anxi uh individual\nresponsibility and you've got to take\nindividual responsibility you can't be\nthe treatment of her depression you can\nabsolutely be a supportive partner for\nher her treatment of depression but you\ncan't be the treatment for her\ndepression and she can't be the\ntreatment for your anxiety she can\nsupport you as a human in terms of your\nwar with anxiety But ultimately you've\ngot to fight that war and ultimately\nshe's got to fight that war or she's got\nto recruit people who can help her fight\nthat war like mental health\nprofessionals would this be a good\ncoup's counseling\ncandidate yes but I don't even think\nit's a couple's problem I think it's\nlike an individual problem right the\nwhole point is that like the the unit\nhere that they need to be working on is\nnot them as a couple it's them as\nindividuals I agree I\nagree like this is some of the thing\nthat you were talking about earlier with\nlike the line between therapist and\nfriend right you can't be everything and\nat some point you're doing a disservice\nby being everything\nyep right so be be what you can for\nanother person and just because you love\nthem doesn't mean that you\nshould fill the slots that you can't\nfill like love is not a substitute for\nlike a medical degree so that you can\ntreat\ndepression just different things right\nso be a supportive boyfriend if you can\nor girlfriend if you're a woman\nand like that's what you can do and if\nyou need to lean on like if they need to\nlean on you for emotional support that's\nabsolutely your job it's not your job to\ntreat their depression and it's a great\npoint that like you know there's a\ndifference between being a friend being\na partner and being a\ntherapist so you know get a [ __ ]\nprofessional if she's got bad\ndepression okay so waldemar 88 I'm tired\nof being a programmer I've not had\nenough patience thus far to study\npsychology how do I figure out what is\nmy Dharma to find my direction in life\nhere is my monthly food food\nquote I'm tired and I have not had\nenough patience thus far to study\npsychology how do I figure out what is\nmy Dharma I think figure out so if you\nare employed as a programmer somewhere\nfigure out what extended leave looks\nlike your place of employment see how\nwhat needs to happen for you to get like\ntwo months\noff without you having to go on\nmaternity leave um I think that could\nhelp you a lot to figure out like I\ndon't know what the point of studying\npsychology is for this person but I\nthink a little bit of time off would be\nreally\ngood yeah so you know I would say if\nyou're tired of being a programmer like\nexplore what is so this is the problem\nis people like they make a diagnosis\nabouts without any understanding of like\nwhy that diagnosis is true so I think\nthat like if I was working with this\nperson the place that you there's so\nmuch here that you can find answers with\nthis person is looking for answers\nthere's so many like there's so many\nanswers right in this question I'm tired\nof being a programmer first question is\nwhy when did you get that way what is\ntired of being a programmer feel like\nwhat about being a programmer is tiring\nexactly and as you find those answers\nthen you'll find your compass\nright it's the reason that you don't\njive with being a programmer that like\ntells you where you should go everyone's\nasking where should I go but no one's\nasking how did I get here everyone's\nlike Dr K what should I do and it's like\nstop buddy like let's not even focus on\nthe future for a second let's focus on\nthe present and focus on the past\nbecause that's where you're going to\nfind your answers so when did you get\ntired of becoming a programmer what got\nyou into programming in the first place\ndid you have an ideal that if you were a\nprogram or you a particular way do you\nhave that same ideal about psychology\nbecause if that's what's driving you\nyou're going to be unhappy as a\npsychologist\nanyway Nelsa why is being a programmer\nthe defining thing that you\nare\ncool okay XM thank you for the $500\ndonation Max Z for the $20 donation I've\nalways struggled with finding a job\nthat's right for me or even a field that\nI would want to work work in it feels\nlike I never had any indicators in which\ndirection to go now I'm stuck in a\ndeadend job and still don't know what to\ndo any\nadvice you want to go I think you have\nsomething to say absolutely man so this\nis exactly what I'm saying right you\nguys see it's the same\nquestion I've struggled finding a job\nthat's right for me so what is wrong\nabout those jobs that's where you have\nto start I have I have something to say\nnow so on the Discord Moses tell me if\nI'm wrong but I put this um I shared it\nit's from my business school and it\nhelps you understand what you want in a\njob and what will be fulfilling in a\ncareer it's that career quick kickoff um\nquestionnaire Moses but if we link that\nin the Discord I think that'll help a\nlot of this go ahead yeah so I I think\nlike yall have a problem you guys are\nlooking for a treatment without a\ndiagnosis the diagnosis is in Discord\nthis is the basic issue right like\nyou're like any advice yeah I'd figure\nI'd figure out deeply what the [ __ ] is\nwrong with what you've done so\nfar because I want you all to think\nabout this you can't know something is\nwrong without a\ncompass right so like one of someone\nshared something really brilliant in in\na group that I run and they were saying\nthat like so so one person was making\nmusic in the group and they were saying\nlike yeah the music isn't good and I\nbeat myself up because like it's not\nwhat I sound like and someone else\nresponded with like you know that's\nreally awesome because that means you\nknow what good music sounds like you\nhave a compass that's telling you what\ngood music sounds like and what you make\nisn't aligned with that yet so just\nfollow that Compass because you know\nwhat good music is and as long as you\nkeep chasing that that is the guiding\nforce that is eventually going to make\nhelp you make good\nmusic brilliant so if you're in the\ndead-end job look at what part of your\nsoul is telling you that this is a dead\nend job and explore that because you can\nfigure out like you know if I look if I\neat a piece of food and it's like this\nfood isn't good and then I ask you in\nwhat way is the food not too good and\nand then if you dig into that and you're\nlike the food is too salty okay now I\nknow what direction to go the direction\nthat you guys are looking for I know\nI'll let you go in a second the\ndirection that you guys are looking for\nis in your very\nquestion so look there\nso this is also like a supply demand\nthing right so what do you have to give\nand what do people want so I would\nsecond things like upwork or Fiverr or\ncatalant depending on kind of where you\nare in your career put your skills out\nthere work on a few projects and figure\nout where you're most valuable and that\nmight be where you can charge the\nhighest rates but it might also be what\nkinds of jobs you get the best feedback\non and I'll tell you even if even if\nyou're just a great writer people need\ngreat writers it might not be the kind\nof writing that you want to do it might\nnot be this lovely Pros or poetry or\nwhatever that you want to write but\npeople need good writers and if that's\nwhat your talent put that out there um\nand I think you have to kind of also be\nopen to shaping like there's no Purity\nin kind of art creative anymore so you\nhave to kind of be open to well this is\nwhat you have but this is what they want\nand you have to kind of shape it to that\nso as long as you know that that's the\nprofessional manifestation of what\nyou're good at um then you can if you\nwant like a pure expression of your art\nthat's going to have to be on the side\nat least until you get your name and\nyour reputation\nout do you know what only fans is people\nare typing only fans\nI've\nheard but it's basically where people\nwould get naked pictures of you I\nthink\noh we have we have a strict no nudes\npolicy in the kenoia\nhousehold okay hello Dr K Mrs K I suffer\nfrom cptsd so that's complex PTSD and\ntreatment resistant depression from an\nabusive childhood I feel uncomfortable\nand normal and and comfortable and\ndangerous chaotic situations can I still\nhave healthy relationships absolutely\nyou just need to work on that like so\nI'd say if you actually have a diagnosis\nof complex PTSD that's something you\nneed to work through with a therapist\nright and you have to understand like\nlike understand why you feel comfortable\nin in chaotic relationships and\nuncomfortable in normal relationships so\nlet's just think about this for a second\nI feel uncomfortable in normal in I I\nfeel uncomfortable in normal\nrelationships and comfortable a and\ndangerous or chaotic relationships can I\nstill have healthy relationships\nabsolutely all you have to do is\ntolerate the discomfort for a time and\nthen the discomfort will go away so I I\ndon't know how else to say this but like\na lot of times we let Comfort or\ndiscomfort guide our actions that's a\nbig [ __ ] mistake\nyep right if you can learn to tolerate\ndiscomfort what you're capable of in\nlife is like very different so you can\nhave a healthy relationship that you're\ngoing to feel uncomfortable in for a\ntime and then hopefully with like a good\ntherapist they can help you feel\ncomfortable with that relationship but\ndiscomfort doesn't mean that you have to\nretreat from the relationship do you\nwant to talk about what a good therapist\nis like like what kinds of specific\nthings people can ask to find a good\ntherapist honestly it's tough because\nlike I think it's fit right so like\nhere's a good therapist when you sit\ndown with someone and you feel like\nthey're capable of over time\nunderstanding who you are the most\nimportant thing is for a therapist to\nget the job of a therapist is not to\ngive you advice we don't give advice\nwhat we help you do is understand\nyourself so if you feel like they\nunderstand you then that's the most\nimportant thing and the second thing is\nlike if if you have a problem with a\ntherapist what makes a good therapist is\na good client like this is I know it's\nkind of crazy this is important but like\nsomewhere along way clients sto taking\nresponsibility for like what happens in\ntherapy like I hate to break it to you\nguys but I'm only 50% of what's in the\nroom when I sit with a\npatient I can be the most brilliant\ntherapist in the world and if the client\ndoesn't help me then like I can't fix\nthem right so what how do you be a good\nclient so you tell the therapist if\nsomething is not working for you that is\nthe most important thing you can after 6\nweeks you can say hey I feel like you\nunderstand me but I don't feel like\nwe're getting anywhere and I don't feel\nlike this is like I feel like it's a\nwaste of my time I love it when clients\nsay that because then just like all\nthese people who are in dead-end jobs I\nask the question why is this dead end\ntherapy what's wrong with this therapy\nwhy is this therapy not working for\nyou and then as we dig into that it's\nlike yeah because like sometimes you\njust talk too [ __ ] much and I have\nsomething to say and you get on your R\nin you soap box and you tell me about\nwhat's wrong with them R and then I'm\nlike thanks for letting me know and then\nI shut the [ __ ] up and then 6 weeks from\nthen we're moving\nforward right but they've got to tell me\nright you got to tell your therapist if\nyou feel like things aren't working and\nthen you guys have to work on it\ntogether and that's a good\ntherapy you have to think about your\ntime and your money too right you don't\nneed to be throwing good time after bad\ngood money after bad money so think\nabout\nI hate I hate using your language but\nlike join the doc side\nno tell your therapist I think this is\nwhat I want to work on and tell your\ntherapist that's not going to work for\nme and here's why I've I've also had bad\nfit with therapists because they didn't\nget me um they didn't get me culturally\nand so they didn't understand why like\nliving in an extended family and all\nthat stuff was going to be important to\nme and I think think anytime you feel a\nvalue judgment or something like that to\nme that's like strike one but you have\nto give the therapist a chance to kind\nof come out of their own value judgments\nthey're human you also have to give them\nClues you have to lead them you have to\nyou really have to lead them to water so\non my end as a patient that's kind of\nwhere I was I think on his end as a\ntherapist having that feedback is super\nimportant don't be that person that\nwalks out of a hair salon with your head\nshaved off and they ask you\nis this what you ask for and you say yes\ndon't do\nthat right it's a therapist's job to\nhelp you but it's your job to let them\nknow what is working and what isn't\nworking yes they\ncannot they only know what they know\nright so it's your job to tell us stuff\nand our job to help you figure it\nout so um quote donated $150 I'm a\n28-year-old classical musician who just\nstarted figuring out his mental figuring\nhis mental [ __ ] out and I'm about to\nchange my profession good for you man\nI'm very anxious about my age and\nfrustrated about the fact that some\ndoors stem fields are almost closed to\nme now yeah so like I don't know what's\nclosed to you at the age of 28 I don't\nthink anything's\nclosed like the oldest dude in my\nmedical school class when was in his mid\n30s I think or maybe even 40 like a\nfirst year medical student was like 40\nyears old stanfield's like you can be 28\nlike I know that doors so I am very\nanxious about my age and frustrated\nabout the\nfact that some doors are almost closed\nto\nme what I deduce from all of those\nqualifiers is that no door is actually\nclosed so what are you frustrated about\nbecause doors aren't actually closed\nyou're frustrated your frustration is\nreal but that [ __ ] comes from in here it\ndoesn't come from\nthe outside\none of the people that I'm most excited\nabout in my business school class he is\na professional drummer he plays with\ndifferent\norchestras I'm really excited about his\ntransition into um the gaming space he's\ngoing to basically be running consumer\ninsights and product in gaming spaces\nbecause he knows how to read a room he\nknows how to react to an audience he\nknows how to understand whether or not\nthe performance is clicking with\nsomebody and I think there are a lot of\nskills in there in being a musician that\nare really translatable if you figure\nout what they are if you figure out how\nto talk about them and if you figure out\nlike what exactly you want to\ndo okay so next um purple platus purple\nplatypus thank you for the $250 donation\nsorry for procrastinating keep up the\ngreat work great stuff\num so\ncpvs $100 how do I make the decision if\nI have found the right

be um you know mindful of of people's\neffort and sort of the boundaries that\nwe set so I want to make sure that if if\nyou you know if we set a certain param\nif we made a promise we want to keep it\nso I'm going to I'm going to shift a\nlittle bit okay\num okay so what can I do to proove my D\nand focus\non doing things I avoid I feel worthless\nand I know why but haven't been able

enti\nand focus on doing things I avoid I feel\nworthless and I know why so let's stop\nthere so I don't think you feel worth I\ndon't think you know enough of the why\nright so like so dig into really why you\nfeel worthless and the second thing to\ndo so the second step is to catch the\nfeeling of worthlessness as it Alters\nyour behavior so you can say okay I feel\nworthless because I had an abusive step\nthat fine then what happens is when you\ntry to engage a behavior notice that\nworthlessness rise up within you you and\nnotice that it says oh no you don't need\nto apply for a job you're never going to\nget it they're never going to interview\nyou're a piece of [ __ ] and then say like\noh that worthlessness comes from the\nvoice of my father or my stepfather or\nwhatever and then catch it in the moment\nthat's the second step that requires\ntraining it requires DH\nabsolutely so practice your DH like\npractice meditation can you keep your\nmind one-pointed for 20 minutes at a\ntime learn thoa fix Point gazing or\ncandle gazing can you stare at a candle\nfor 20 minutes you have to learn it\nproperly without blinking can your\nattention be fully focused on a candle\nflame for 20 minutes with no\ndeviation if you know why you feel\nworthless if you catch the worthlessness\nand if you practice your D I don't think\nthat you're going to have a problem

business\njournals read need\nprogramming or can I tell you what this\nreally means go ahead this really means\ntell our designers what to do in a way\nthat they understand okay read or\nwatch gaming\nconference me understand design\nprinciples okay fine so here's what\nwe're going to do gaming\nconference search up gaming design\nprinciples\ngaming design\nprinciples look at this you guys see the\nauto complete y'll see this [ __ ] that's\nwhat I'm saying just [ __ ] Google\nthings okay\nbeautiful\nokay look at this this is what we're\ngoing to do I'm going to give you guys\nan example\nfour keys to\nfun okay now yall ready you guys\nready okay so at some point you guys\nknow that you have to write a cover\nletter a resume right this is what we're\ngoing to say on our resume and we'll get\nto\nthis so you're going to say internship\nbecause that's where you have to start\nat new game\ncompany and then what you're going to\nsay is\nso you're going to go to the company\nyou're going to intern there for a while\nyou're going to read this document and\nanything that in this document that\napplies to your job you're going to pick\nout and then you're going to be specific\nwith it so\nused so when you're\ndescribing your job at the company\nyou're going to say use the Buster\nprinciple to\nzoom\nin\nto use the Buster principle\nto let me think about how to phrase this\nI'm searching for information to process\nuse the Brer principle to better\nunderstand or so to hold on to\nimprove\ncosmetic monetization\nusing the\navailability ability\ncisti\nspecifically targeting\nnegativity\nbias this is going to be on your resume\nand then you're going to say C appendix\na and then you're going to add an\nattachment when you apply for your job\nthey're going to ask you for a CV and\nthen you're going to ask them do you\nguys mind if I submit an\nappendix and they're going to be like\nsure or they may be like we're not sure\npeople don't usually do that and Absa\n[ __ ] Loop me so what appendix a is\ngoing to be you're going to read this\ndocument and then you're going to\nsummarize the Buster\nprinciple\nso game designers\ninadvertently make the game too hard and\ngame good game design inherently\ncaptures lazaros 4 keys to\nfun and you're going to write about it\nyou're just going to read this document\nand this is the cool thing okay I'm\ngoing to move back to twit chat make it\nspecific yeah yeah so this is the cool\nthing so I don't want you guys to just\nBS so you're going to read that document\nand you're going to actually like\nbecause you're a [ __ ] gamer you're\ngoing to take the things in the document\nthat you think are interesting that you\nunderstand and you're actually going to\nwrite about\nit and then then what you're so you guys\nget that like it's not just making [ __ ]\nup like you can't just make [ __ ] up I'm\ndoing that now but hopefully that's are\nam I losing y'all or y'all good\nhere is mic blowing out\nokay good okay\nso like the thing is that when you guys\ndo this\nokay like you can read that document and\nthen you can start doing this and you\ncan start putting together your cover\nletter and then what happens is when you\nguys put together your cover letter you\ncan like check this off right once you\nwrite that appendix and then we're going\nto talk about getting an internship and\nthen what you're going to do is you're\ngoing to ask your intern bosses like\ntheir bosses at your internship you're\ngoing to say hey I'd like to this is\nwhat you do you go to your bosses at\nyour internship after a month and you\nsay I'd like to use design principles to\nhelp deliver high quality work I'd like\nto try to figure out how to use\nFrameworks of design principles to\nactually Implement like a design change\nor can you guys help me understand how\nto use designing principles like how\ndesign principles actually go and create\nthe game that yall are working on is\ndoes that make sense hopefully it makes\nsense so you're going to go to your\ninternship and you're going to use these\nwords and you're going to say I want to\nlearn this thing and then you're going\nto observe that thing you're going to\ntake some notes and then based on the\nnotes that you write that you take and\nbased on the PDF that you write and the\nappendix that you write up like whatever\nyou think is interesting you're going to\ncombine that in some way to make this\nstatement specific to your\ninternship okay\nso let's keep\ngoing okay so once again like\ninternship ask for a complex problem\nthat they need to chunk up right or just\npay attention to what you're doing at\nyour internship you're going to see a\ncomplex problem and pay attention to\nwhen people like chunk things up and how\nthey tackle a complex\nproblem when you see this happening\nbecause it's going to happen in any\nworkspace ask hey this is really cool\nhow you guys are dividing this\ncomplicated task of fundraising for\nmental health and dividing it in into\nmultiple stream days with new content\ncan I get\ninvolved that's what you say do you guys\nsee that because here's the thing\nspecific questions get good\nanswers this signals that you understand\nwhat's going on you're not just walking\nin you're saying hey can you guys teach\nme how to do this you're expressing\nappreciation you're expressing\nunderstanding what this tells you what\nthis tells your boss is that I don't\nhave to teach this kid from day one he\nunderstands what's going on and maybe he\ncan\nhelp\nright okay and then you're going to\nwrite a community\nguide and try to get it up voted and\nthat too is like maybe this is 50 to 100\nhours you're going to make a bunch of\ncommunity\nguides okay so this we're going to gloss\nover for a second so what we're going to\ndo is start with an\ninternship\nship game design at small or medium\ncompany well also what is similar\nexperience or similar experience\nbeautiful good cat right so you may be\nable to get this after the internship so\nwhat you're going to do is you're going\nto find a small company so what we're\ngoing to do is like go to steam green\nlight\nokay how does\nthis we're going to go to steam Early\nAccess you guys with me chat\nokay so what you're going to do is look\nat all of the Early Access\ngames publisher\ndragons\nokay then okay it looks like this didn't\nwork so you're going to look at the\nEarly Access games we're going to go\nthrough\nokay and you find which which Early\nAccess games are you interested in oh\nlet's do I Dracula Genesis that looks\npretty cool okay publisher morning this\nis a test donation for\n$88 okay so then what we do is we say\nokay look look there's a\nlink cool\nteam okay\nfantastic so then what we're going to do\nis we're going to go through all of\nthese\ngames oh cool there's another PowerPoint\nso read that [ __ ] so we're going to go\nthrough all of the steam Ator games\nwe're going to find their developers CU\nthese are small potatoes and you're\ngoing to email them right press\nkit subscribe find some way to contact\nthem DM them on TR Twitter take 50 indie\ngame companies and message them and\nbasically what you want to say in your\ncover\nletter you're going to take this job\ndescription and you're going to say this\nis what I'm interested\nin so this is what you're going to say\nokay we'll do it this\nway do you post this on later hello game\ncompany my name is XYZ and I'm\npassionate about video games and very\ninterested in\ninterning with\nyou because\nI\nlike specific detail of your game\nJohn I have a background\nin using design principles to deliver\nhigh quality\nwork C appendix\na I also\nhave experience\nin oh\n[ __ ] representing player experience and\nneeds and discussion\nc community\nguides a through\nD\num I\nalso have been\nstudying current gaming Trends and\ntastes in the global\nmarket and here we go again am I losing\ny'all twit chat is this boring for y'all\nI can't tell so I got to see this real\nquick okay so current gaming Trends in\nglobal\nmarkets okay and now you guys ready for\nthe next thing you guys ready for it\nthere we\ngo here we go look at\nthis look at this [ __ ] look at\nthis okay\nso you read\nthis and then you\nfind what is interesting about\nit\nplease so now you've got an interesting\nchoice you\ncan reach out to whoever wrote\nthis\nindustry trends\nand ask them for an\ninternship or you can write your\nthoughts into\nappendix\nB and then you you\nsay and then you find the thing you find\nthe thing on this\nlist that you're the weakest\nin right\nso um so what's the here that you're\nweakest in okay so game design role I'd\nlike to inter turn with you and\napply\nmy you know novice because you don't\nwant to oversell yourself background in\ndesign principles and\nGlobal gaming Trends\ninto actual game design\nyou don't want to oversell yourself you\ndon't want to say you're the best person\nfor the job you don't want to say you're\nsuper\nexperienced I was hoping you\nyou had an\ninternship\nopportunity\nwith that would give me a chance to\nlearn actual game\ndesign and the then what you do is you\ncan\nsay even though I have limited\nexperience in actual game\ndesign I hope the above\nappendices indicate that\nI you know\nthere then you clean it\nup right so I hope that IND indicate\nthat I have am capable of producing so\nlet's let's rephrase this okay so here's\nour I am capable of\nproducing work that is thetically\nappropriate and internally to\nI can take\ninformation from\nmarketing sources and use them\nto\nenhance and use them or no let's and\nintegrate them with\ndesign principles or not I can not I can\ntake I am interested\nin I disagree with this\nwhat your work is internally coherent\nthematic work appropriate And Trades off\ndifferent values against each other as\nneeded so this this is asking you to\njust have a strong point of view that is\nsupported by something so this is mostly\nabout you saying like I evaluated this I\nevaluated this I see the pros see the\ncons pros the cons I think this is what\nwe should do this is what's the risk\nhere is what we have to gain the end so\nI think that's down here\nright did we miss something well I think\nwhat that should demonstrate is a\nsituation where you kind of had to make\na hard decision and\nwhy that decision was the right one the\nkey thing is D trade trades off\ndifferent values right so this this is\nbusiness speak for had to make a hard\ndecision with you yeah so guys my point\nis that like you can\nstart so I'm gonna switch this for a\nsecond okay so like\nthis so\nso how can I say this okay so the first\nthing is that like you guys can start\nwith this right and like literally what\nI've done is I've sat down with this and\nI don't like make it up over the course\nof 15 minutes you actually have to stop\nand look at each of those things and\nunderstand what what they actually mean\njust like Ruthie is saying often times\nthese people have actually had to learn\nprogramming so many game designers so we\ncan go back to laws page\nokay um so let's do\nthis so I don't see this here but often\ntimes they'll have like like jobs will\nhave Proficiency in a particular\nprogramming language right right so\nthey'll say like proficient with Excel\nor I mean that's not our progage but\nlike you know proficient in CP or Java\nor whatever people use now and and then\nand then what happens is like you have\nto start like enrolling in those classes\nso while you're doing this business\nspeak like whatever crap you know you're\nreading stuff about PDFs you're learning\nabout the industry like you just\nactually have to sit down and read the\nentire PDF and then read another one and\nthen read another one and the cool thing\nabout this is that the problem that you\nguys have when it comes to getting out\nof your rut is this is at the end of the\nday when you look\nat\nthis you never get to check anything\noff right you can't find the job of your\ndreams because you never get to take a\nstep forward you can't take a\ndemonstrable step forward but at the end\nof the day when you apply for an\ninternship you can check that I mean get\nan internship which right imply so\nhere's here's apply for\ninternship and then like let's say like\nrequired qualifications okay and let's\nadd like coding in language ABC so then\nlike you start you\njoin the healthy gamer coding Workshop\nyou get certifications right so there\nare like you know like let's say you're\ndoing something marketing so there's\nlike Google\nanalytics certifications so you get like\nthese independent certifications which\nthey'll say on the job description\nthey'll say it over here like requires\nlike Google analytics certification this\nkind of thing or like proficiency with\nABC and then like you literally Google\nthat stuff you sign up for it and then\nbecause you guys can do anything for one\nmonth you cram because y'all are good\ncramming and then you like learn Google\nanalytics certification and then 3\nmonths from now you guys have checked\noff like 20% of what this has right and\nhopefully starting in the fall you'll\nhave an internship and while you're at\nthe internship then you're going to talk\nto them about this stuff share your\nappendices you know actually learn\nthings and then like a year from now\nyou'll have completed the internship\nwhat happens for a lot of these guys is\nthey actually do such a good job like I\nthink two or three people did such a\ngood job at the internship that they\noffered them a job they're like hey man\nyou're doing really awesome like it\nsounds like you really are learning a\nlot of different stuff and you know\nreally motivated they'll offer them a\njob so you work for that job for a year\nand then when you apply to Riot games a\nlike after you work for them for a year\nand then you can say yeah I did an\ninternship with this company they\nactually offered me a job right at the\nend of my internship humble brag right\nbut it's a statement of fact I worked\nwith them for a year but I found that\nthe reason that I'm not happy with my\njob is because I identified\nproblems and offered I wanted to explore\na range of solutions with my bosses but\nmy bosses like really wanted to do\nthings their way and I'm looking for a\ncompany where I can communicate like\npossible solutions and get good feedback\nwhat don't don't don't ever diss your\nlast boss okay or your last management\nteam yeah yeah I because it shows it I\ndon't know it's just I I I don't I mean\nso all this stuff has to be like worked\non a little bit okay but like my point\nis you can say like hey I'm really\ninterested in you don't have to diss\nyour last boss that's a good point you\ncan say I'm really interested in working\nfor a company you know they had one\nproduct and so they had pretty like\nnarrow Solutions and like next things\nbecause it's a startup and I'd really\nlove to be at a company that you know is\ndealing with complex problems where I\ncan like think about Solutions and then\ndiscuss them with a\nteam right does this does that make\nsense to you guys like that's how you do\nit that's like literally how you do it\nand then you you chip away at each of\nthose things and then you look at each\nthing and then you kind of figure out\nokay what's the first step to doing this\nthing I don't know I don't know if that\nwas too much sure if you guys like\nweren't able to follow me like I'm\nbecause I wasn't reading twit chat I\nalso think that like when you do apply\nfor that internship and they ask you\nthat where do you want to be in a few\nyears you'll have a really good\nanswer so so I think here here's the\nmain thing like here's the key thing to\ntake\naway the job of your dreams the job\ndescription for the job of your dreams\nmost people see as an obstacle it's not\nan obstacle it's a [ __ ] road map\nit's a road map and so you look at it\nand you start Googling stuff and I'm\ntelling you if there's something you\ndon't understand Google that exact\nphrase and then add the letters PDF to\nthe end I'm serious and that is how you\nwill like like you guys want to play you\nguys want you want to test me your dhma\nPDF Dharma is technology\nlike what on\nEarth okay so let's\nfind let's let's just pick something\nrandom so\nayic doas\nfor\nprofessional it's like\nlike it doesn't even have to be mental\nhealth because ayurve is system\nmedicine\nright practical ayurva self-development\nindex\nof 226 Pages holy hell this looks\ngood right like like seriously just\nstart that's how you guys\nstart hold on lay\nokay okay and so the the the job\nrequirements for the job of your dream\nis not an obstacle it's a road map and\nthen you start with it you learn things\nalong the way you take notes you\nsynthesize them into clear like\nstatements and then like along the way\nyou may find that actually you're very\ninterested in gaming Trends and\nmarketing and you're not actually\ninterested in riot games and as you\nreach out to the people who publish that\nreport you can say hey I'm a 24y old\nliving in the US with a degree in XYZ in\ncomputer science don't say that you\nhaven't been you don't have a job right\nso you can say I have a a degree in\ncomputer science I find myself more\ninterested in\nlike how can I say this I find myself\nmore interested in Global Marketing\ntrends for computer games as opposed to\nactual programming which is what I\nwanted to do do you guys have any\ninternship opportunities\navailable and like you just shoot things\nout again and again and again and again\nand now we get back to this question of\nwhat do you do after 100 rejections do\nyou guys see how like I'm expecting to\nget rejected from that who the [ __ ] in\nsome did you guys even see the the email\naddresses\nhere for that\nPDF Fairfield International like look at\nthis like Astron\nde these guys aren't going to get back\nto me cha entertainment. de they're not\ngoing to get back to me\nwuga are they G I don't know you're just\ngoing to email them all and you're going\nto copy and paste this email copy past\nit\nbaby and say I'm interested in like any\nkind of internship opportunities that\nyou Ma may have and then you kind of\nacknowledge like you can even use\nphrasing\nlike look like you can say that I'm I'm\ninterested in an internship because I\nrecognize that my background in actual\nprogramming doesn't does isn't a perfect\nfit so I'm not asking for a job do you\nguys have an internship no I wouldn't\nsay that okay I would say I'm a\nprogrammer transitioning into consumer\ninsights I'd love to help you guys\nfigure out your player strategy for the\nnext year what how can I help you so\nsomewhere along the way this is also an\nimportant step in the process try to\nfind someone who can actually help you\niron these things out\nyeah right like try to find a mentor\nmaybe you guys can find that on our\nDiscord or not that maybe something for\nus to think about but like the whole\npoint that what holds you guys back is\nthat when you think about working at\nRiot games that feels far away and the\nthing that I want to tell you guys over\nand over again is like it's not far away\nand if you can check something off if\nyou can move 2% at the end of a month\ntowards a job at Riot games like that's\nawesome\nall it's going to take is 50\nmonths right that's four years like sure\nthat sounds like a long time but like\nwhere were you four years ago and where\nare you now like four years from now\nlike what are you going to be doing like\nat least move forward in some\nway we're going to do um more Discord\noffice hours or I will and I can help\nyou guys like at your resume\nspecifically or job application\nspecifically um Moses and I are going to\nfigure out the right time and place and\nformat to do that\nbut I want to get you guys good jobs\ny'all are smart capable people but don't\nlet us down be reliable do what you're G\nto do what you say you're going to do\ncome through be proactive put that brain\npower in the right place I understand\nthat it's about passion and that you you\nhave to be motivated and passionate and\nfeel purposeful in what you're doing but\ndo that first only apply to stuff where\nyou feel like that's going to be true\nfor you and then pull through I want\npeople saying that people from the\nhealthy gamer Community are legit I want\npeople saying that people from the\nhealthy gamer Community do what they say\nthat they're going to\ndo there was an emote thing but it\ndidn't let me share anything it's\nweird okay guys we're um so listen\noverall thank you guys so much it looks\nlike we we've raised a th $3,000 over\nthe course of the last couple of hours\neven after we hit our our 100K goal\nwhich first of all is amazing that we\nhit that like I really can't I really\nhad no idea we were GNA do this um and\nand thank you guys for continually\ndonating um and uh and yeah I mean like\nI I don't know how else to say this but\nlike thank you guys because we're here\nfor you and it feel I don't know how to\nsay this but like it feels awesome to\nknow that y'all are there for us because\nyou know you tell us what yall need and\nwe're going to work on it if it's\nHealthcare stream DLC that's fine it's\nif it's like literally how to sit down\nand start the process of finding a job\nthat is what we will do yes I'm telling\nyou guys like this methodology like this\n[ __ ] over here like not an\nexaggeration someone that I did this\nwith and who did this crap for like two\nyears is now making $300,000\nand like I it's not all fluff and\nmirrors okay like they actually went\nthrough and read the 100 page PDF over\nthe course of two days and took notes on\nit and then they looked at each of those\nlazaros four things of success and they\nPDF that [ __ ] and they PDF that [ __ ] and\nthis is the other big thing about\ncollege you don't need college to learn\nsomething you can just PDF that [ __ ]\nuntil you're blue in the face and then\nyou learn it and then like don't make\nthe mistake of going and posting on\nReddit when saying I'm very smart and\ntell like oh like you posted this on the\nLeague of Legends subreddit did I let\nyou know that this sounds like Lazaro's\nfour things Four Keys of Happiness let\nme tell everyone on Reddit how brilliant\nI am don't [ __ ] post on Reddit to\nshow people how smart you are that's not\nwhy you're reading the scrap it's a\nwaste of your brain space post on Reddit\nbecause you want to demonstrate to\npeople that you're able to communicate\nwith the with the community end game end\ngame don't let your ego get a hand of\nthis the reason you're learning all this\ntrap is not to show off to your friends\non Discord it's so that you can actually\nfind a [ __ ] job and if you let your\nego get in the way it's a waste of your\ntime and you're not actually going to\nlearn yeah right don't show up okay so\nthank you guys very much uh we've raised\n$100,000 our coaching program is going\nto go live next week
