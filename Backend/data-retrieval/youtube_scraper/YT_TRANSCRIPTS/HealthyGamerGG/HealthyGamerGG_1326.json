    "transcript": "so can you tell me am i calling you Kate\nor Kaveri no I was calling you Katerina\nwhen I was first informed that you were\ncoming on stream\nyeah even coming Kate gaze okay I'm so\nKate can you tell me a little bit about\nyou know what's going on with you\nnowadays and and if there's something in\nparticular that you want to talk about\num what's going on with me nowadays hmm\nwell there's a lot there's a lot of\nstuff going on back there or you know me\nto a chat no reading to a chat no okay\nokay uh they're either gone they got a\nreally good I can't see him if I don't\nget turned you don't get to read them\nyou don't get to read them this is that\nI can't because I only have one monitor\nand i have this full screen mm-hmm you\nshould really get a second monitor okay\nanyway I have one ah I can't figure out\nhow to plug it in I think it's like\nreally it's like I don't know anyway\nit's I three morons actually in this\nroom Wow look at you three monitors only\none of them works I don't know let's me\ngoing on lately a lot of [ __ ] I guess I\ntook two months off of streaming\nrecently because of recent events okay\nuh yeah those're no we can talk about\nthem okay um well it's pretty pretty\npretty gnarly dr. Kang\nbasically I you you said you don't know\nany of this right nope I didn't even\nknow how to pronounce your name until\ntoday by the way I'm not laughing about\nthe situation I you should though that I\njust like nervous laughter sister we\ntalk a lot about how laughter is a\ndefense mechanism against overwhelming\ninternal emotions yeah yeah I use\nhumor is a big defense mechanism that's\nthat's a that's a really really big\nthing I make lots of jokes that I should\nnot make um but for anyway I guess well\nwhat happened was I I had a boyfriend\nand I cheated on him with several people\nokay yeah and it's yeah that long story\nshort\nokay yeah and Josh I can imagine that\nthe internet was not kind to you in that\ncircumstance oh no even and we're best\nfriends they love me the people love me\nokay they're really mad just yeah it's\nyou know sorry I think it's it's not\ngood to cheat on people and also I don't\nknow that it's the Internet's place to\njudge I think the judgment that you\nreally you know I think you aggrieved\none person right as far as I can I want\nlike like you you really messed with one\nperson right so like your boyfriend um\nyeah but I hurt other people in the\nprocess\nI can imagine well yeah definitely\nespecially the boyfriend my ex boyfriend\nnow but okay do you want to talk about\nthis or also not talk about this I mean\nI don't I don't know if there's really\nmuch to talk about besides like I don't\nknow what is there to talk about you\nknow I kinda that's a great question can\nI can I try to answer that sure yeah so\nsometimes I [ __ ] up and I'm not I'm not\ntrying to say that you did or didn't\n[ __ ] up that's entirely I did for good\nthat's for sure so so I think you know a\nlot of times when people make mistakes\nmy sound is quiet okay let me try to fix\nthis hello okay I don't know how I can\nfix this okay maybe hopefully this is\nbetter\nright now I can also turn up the game\nsorry Kate oh you're good Joey is this\nbetter\noh yeah fix it hello yep\nI think way better turns out that maybe\none of the kids was playing with the the\ngame dial on the back of my microphone\nbut we're just kind of going back to you\nknow why people screw up I think often\ntimes people make a mistake and then\nthey don't really understand what led\nthem to make that mistake and\nunderstanding why we make mistakes in\nlife so I think a lot of times what we\ndo is we just punish people for mistakes\nright but we don't necessarily learn\nfrom them or what we learn is something\nlike a very very surface level\nespecially when it comes to something\nlike cheating on a partner which is like\nwe just learned that don't do it again\nbut what I've come to appreciate is that\nwhen we make mistakes that they're\nusually like there's something that's\ndriving you towards that behavior and I\nthink understanding where that behavior\ncomes from is like really really\nimportant because if you just tell\nyourself like oh I shouldn't do that\nagain like that doesn't actually change\nbehavior in my experience feeling bad\nabout yourself and sort of a moral\njudgment is not really a great way I'm\nnot saying it doesn't work but I'm\nsaying that you know when I when I work\nwith I'm specifically thinking about I\ndo a lot of addiction psychiatry so I\nwork with a lot of people who will\nrelapse and then we'll mortal they feel\nbad about themselves they'll hurt a lot\nof people in the process they'll sell\nbelongings that or their family members\nfor the sake of like you know purchasing\ndrugs so that they can get money and do\nall kinds of things that are morally\nreprehensible and at the same time you\nknow feeling like a piece of [ __ ]\nsometimes makes them more vulnerable to\nthe addiction yeah and so sometimes it\ncan yep go ahead sorry yeah well it's\nthey're happy of course when they feel\nwhen they feel bad it's you know feeling\nbad is gonna make them want to do some\n[ __ ] coke or whatever they're\naddicted to right so I think the the the\nquestion about you know whether this is\nworth talking about or not really you\nknow is about like whether there's\nsomething to be gained I really have no\nintention of making the internet think\nworse of you then than they do or\nanything like that yeah I honestly I\ndon't think okay so I mean otherwise you\nknow Kate if if you don't want to talk\nmore into that and maybe try to\nunderstand because you said you cheated\non your boyfriend with several people so\nthat makes me think that there was\nsomething going on inside you that you\nreally and and so to try to understand\nthat if you think that's valuable and\nyou feel like this is a safe enough\nplace to discuss it we can do that\nbecause I I think one thing that we\nhaven't talked about much on stream is\nlike why do people cheat and it happens\nall the time\nokay sure\nwell yeah one thing is I don't want\npeople to think that I'm trying to like\ngarner sympathy\nI guess just because like obviously you\nknow we talked before this and you know\nI struggle with mental health issues and\num I think that yeah I made the decision\nto cheat you know I made a decision hurt\nthose people\nI [ __ ] up it wasn't you know my mental\nhealth decision but but that's not to\nsay that it didn't you know obviously I\nmean yes and as I'm sure you know like\nmental health kind of can really mess\nwith your head yep yeah yeah I don't get\nthe sense that you're looking for\nsympathy here or anything like that I\nmean I have no idea if people are\nsympathetic to you or not because I\nignored twitch at as best as I can while\nI'm talking to someone I think the main\nquestion Kate is like what do you feel\nsafest doing and what do you feel is\nmost productive like I mean I guess like\nlet me put it this way do you understand\nwhy you cheated yeah yeah I took two\nmonths off stream and just kind of\nprocessed things and tried to understand\nyou know\nmy own therapist too and we we talk\nabout it a lot and yeah I understand now\nlook I can talk about it if you want\nit's whatever I\nI find myself being curious about what\nyou discovered about yourself because I\nthink that could be helpful for people\nokay so I well for me I mean there's a\nlot of factors and a lot of things but\nit's it's several different things a big\npart of it was my um my\ndepersonalization was something I really\nstruggled with what do you mean by\ndepersonalization can you explain\nsomething else yeah that's like\ndepersonalization for me was like I'm\nfeeling like a like a passenger in my\nown body like kind of you know how when\nyou look and when you interact with the\nworld in life your eyes are kind of here\nyou know your vision is here but it kind\nof feels like what I do personalized\nlike my visions back here like I'm super\non autopilot and honestly I feel like\nfor the past or not now but like for six\nmonths I just felt like I was a shell of\na person like I was new in living you\nknow what I mean and I think know what\nwould weigh in by that I don't know what\nyou mean um it just felt like my body\nwasn't my own I guess like I was there\nand I was just kind of like passively\nliving while my body just did things you\nknow like I wouldn't I didn't think\nabout anything I didn't process anything\nlike that you know and that is I deeper\nties when I get stressed or anxious and\nI think the anxiety of my job and [ __ ]\nlike that which is my job is you know is\na twitch streamer mm-hmm okay yeah which\nis pretty a pretty you know pretty scary\nsometimes and then and then cheating\nalso things I do that too um\njust triggered my depersonalization\nstuff\nyeah so that's so that that's your\nunderstanding of it I mean there's more\nbut you know it's it's a lot like you\nknow obviously I wasn't happy my\nrelationship and I depressurize all\nthose feelings away you know it's just\nit's just mainly what it was to\nsummarize it was I just kind of told all\nmy thoughts and feelings to [ __ ] off you\nknow okay I didn't process it anything\nor I didn't think about anything and I\njust like totally lived on autopilot you\nknow okay look can I just think for a\nsecond yeah thank you for sharing that\nby the way how are you doing I can\nimagine that this could be rough to\nshare no I'm okay\nokay I'm good strong work Thanks I'm\ngonna just think about what you shared\nand try to piece together a couple of\ndifferent things\nare you depersonalized right now um no\nI'm I've been trying to work through D\npersonalising I still do sometimes but\nit's mostly when I when I get really\nanxious or stressed and I feel pretty\nrelaxed right now and I have coping\nmechanisms with it like like grounding\nmechanisms you know and so I'll like\nsmell something strong or touch\nsomething that feels funny I just don't\nlike it I'm I fidget even stuff good or\nI go outside and you feel the ground um\nso one thing that I want to be careful\nabout is you know you mentioned earlier\nthat you don't want you're not looking\nfor sympathy and and I'm gonna if it's\nokay with you Kate I'm gonna point out\nwhere I think that something you say may\nbe misinterpreted and may lead to people\nhating on you so one thing that I want\nto point out very explicitly because I\ndon't want people to walk away from this\nwith like an incomplete understanding or\nan unfair judgment and if they want to\njudge you for cheating I think that\nthat's fair but you know one thing I\njust want to point out is that sometimes\npeople think that if you D personalize\nand you're like watching yourself move\nthat removes responsibility from your\nactions what do you think about that I\nagree but I mean what can i I guess I\njust don't know what to do except for\nlike that's what happened you know I did\nmake the decision to cheat it was me you\nknow that wasn't like my my mental\nhealth or my depersonalization making\nthe decision that was me but I it was\nfull and anxiety inducing obviously and\nso I it like triggered my [ __ ]\ndepersonalization whatever and which is\nsome why I've always had I realize now\nin the past and stuff and then yeah so\nI'm I'm what I'm just pointing out is\nthat I don't\nI don't hear you saying although I was\nafraid that people could interpret what\nyou said is it's not my fault because I\ndepersonalized\nokay so I just wanted you know like they\ncan exist together yeah\nabsolutely that's exactly what I want to\nclarify because I'm afraid that without\nunderstanding that we can understand\nbetter what that means but you know I\njust don't want to have people coming\nacross with the idea that you're\nabsolving yourself from blame by\ndepersonalization yeah cool so let's\njust think a little bit about this so\nyou were saying that you weren't you\nsaid obviously I wasn't happy in my\nrelationship so that too is not obvious\nto me well I mean if you're cheating on\nsomeone you're probably not happy people\na lot of people a lot of people think\nthat but in my experience that being\nunhappy in a relationship is not the\nonly reason that people cheat it's a\ncommon one but sometimes people cheat\nout of ego or narcissism or the fact\nthat they feel like they can right so in\nin in in some really uneven power\nrelationship like in uneven power\ndynamics I've seen one partner cheat\njust because they feel like they're\nentitled to yeah I work with a lot of\nexecutives so yeah I mean not to you\nknow bash executives as a whole but\nsometimes people tend to be a little bit\nnurse I also work with a lot of\nphysicians so so let's just think about\nthis for a second so I'm gonna try to\nunpack what I understood so it sounds\nlike you had some feelings and those\nfeelings were hard for you to tolerate\nand processing and experiencing my\nemotions and feelings I use humor as a\ndefense mechanism and I am really bad at\nprocessing sadness as an emotion great\nyou know who else is bad at processing\ntheir emotions\npretty much right so\noh yeah so I think what what happened\nwhat sounds like you had some you know\nauthentic feelings of unhappiness or\nmaybe insecurity or god knows what else\nand then as you started to d personalize\nyou kind of shunted those feelings off\nto the side and then what I'm guessing\nis that cheating somehow you know\nbalanced or covered or helped you forget\nit about the negative feelings yeah yeah\nand I think I think when you're in our\nlong relationship like that feelings of\noh god I can't end this you know like it\nI you know I don't want to say stuck but\nyou know what I mean like when you're in\na long relationship in you even if\nthings might not be working you want to\nkeep working at them you know what I\nmean because you know you care about\nthat person and you've been in the\nrelationship for a long time yeah um can\nyou tell me a little bit about the\nrelationship he was we dated for for a\nlong time and I met him before I started\nstreaming everything and I guess I don't\nknow we what is a long time mean it's a\nlong time bye boomer standard sir\nstreamers no no Sumer standards what is\nthat\ncouple years okay uh but the couple\nmeans to yeah okay and a long time we\nyeah especially because you know we\nstarted dating when I was young so and\nwhen you when you start dating some\nyou're really young and I also started\ndating him this is actually kind of\nimportant [ __ ] so no I think for you at\nleast someone analyzing my brain we met\nmonths after my dad\ndied and so kind of in the wake of that\nwe start dating and how old were you\nwhen you started dating 18 we met on my\n18th birthday yeah\nso I was 18 when we started dating and a\nfew months after my dad died and he was\nvery comforting um but I I don't know\ntwo major things relaxed in the\nrelationship um one I have vaginismus\nand so our sex life was pretty not good\nWow I'm really being open about this\nwell can you explain to us what\nvaginismus is yeah vaginismus is\nbasically like so it's it's a so it's a\nmental thing like a lot of people who\nwere sexually abused had vaginismus\nand it was it's like basically he's\ncannot explain it's like a mental thing\nwhere basically you Jenna broke vagina\nbroke it to work okay let me it's hard\nto fit things in there let me try to\ngive a different definition of it sure\nyeah you should do that no I think\nyou're doing great it's just you know\nvagina broke is you know I think you did\na funder fellini what depersonalization\nis I think you've explained a lot of\nthings really well so there are two\nissues that I have with with your\ndefinition of vaginismus first is vagina\nbroke and second is that you think it's\na mental thing so in my experience\nfashion business is not purely a mental\nthing\nvaginismus yeah well you physically it's\na physical thing too but I think it's\ncaused by mental stuff usually but how\nmy therapist and I talked about it it's\nlike I guess it is a physical thing too\nbecause we talked about it like um when\nyou're you know sexually abused and you\nit's like muscle tension there\nI don't know okay I'm I'm gonna just\ninterrupt you and explain and then we\ncan talk about your how you and your\ntherapist have talked about it\nso vaginismus is spasm of like the\nmuscles of especially the entrance of\nthe vagina so essentially what happens\nis like you know your body has a lot of\nmuscles and and you know different kinds\nof openings like I know this this\nreminds me of beavis and butt-head but\nliterally it has sphincters and and\nsphincter is like a circular muscle that\ncontracts and relaxes this is gonna get\nso taken out of context but it really\nisn't really to understand no no I'm not\nworried about it\ntaking being taken out of context for\nyou I'm worried about you guys that are\ngonna I know I'm giving him so much but\nseriously I mean this is important to\nunderstand because I think vaginismus is\nsomething that's like not like people\ndon't a lot of people a lot of women\nwill have a gene is amiss and they don't\nunderstand they just think that they're\nthey think actually exactly like you\nthink that my vagina is broken but it's\nnot that your vagina is broken it's just\nyou have a medical condition that needs\nsome kind of treatment and then you're\nable anyway so what happens is\nessentially you have spasm of the I\nthink mostly the outer muscles of the\nvagina which make it which make your\nessentially your vagina like clamp down\nand then you can't really you know\ninsert anything into it and when you do\ntry to have sex it's often very very\nvery painful because or doesn't work\nbecause your your that muscle is like\nclamped down very hard and so you just\ncan't engage in any kind of sexual\nrelations and so it's it's so I really\nthink about it as muscle spasm is really\nwhat it is and and you know Kate is spot\non that a lot of times\nvaginismus I think has if you look at\nlike the population of people who are\nvaginismus and now I'm kind of curious\nabout like how common of a problem it is\nand I think it's important actually it's\nsometimes a kid is really common - yes\nso so a risk factor for vaginismus is\nthe sexual trauma and and this is where\nonce again we kind of get to the fact\nthat like you know a physical thing is\nnot just purely\nphysical thing nor is it purely a mental\nthing it's like her her body has trained\nor has been programmed to like have that\nthat muscle spasm in sort of a\nprotective way or whatever it may have a\nmental component to it in terms of as\nyou get anxious then your body is gonna\nstart to spasm more you may you know you\nmay have like an anxiety attack or\nsomething like that like your heart rate\nincreases blood pressure increases\nmental stuff in your head has all kinds\nof physical effects on your body yes in\nfact yeah so so vaginismus is one kind\nof vulnerability that saw a particular\nbody and has to respond to a mental\nstressor and we each have our each of\nour bodies is like a little bit unique\nin the way that it responds to strengths\nso when we're mentally stressed\ndepending on the kind of stress that we\nfeel our body is going to do different\nkinds of things some people will get\nbutterflies in their stomach\nsome people will start to hyperventilate\nsome people will have a panic attack\nsome people will emotionally shut down\nor D personalize some people will have\nvaginismus some people will you know\npiss themselves like all like the body\njust does all kinds of crap that like we\ndon't want it to do because we're just\nthat's just the way our body works based\non mental stuff and so so it sounds like\nyou have vaginismus and and I forgot how\nwe got onto that so it sounds like you\nwould you started dating your boyfriend\nwhen you were eight our issues are ear\nissues okay my vaginismus or sex link\nwasn't very existent okay and and also\nuh but we weren't we didn't I don't know\nhow to word this I wasn't well I'm\nreally bad at accepting my emotions and\nprocessing my emotions already and I\nthink that he wasn't good at doing you\nknow he also wasn't good at that sure\nand so we I guess we didn't talk about\nour emotions at all which was my fault\nbecause I wanted you know I wanted\nsomeone who was there for me mostly I\nthink subconsciously but I didn't admit\nthat to myself it was a lot of like\nfeelings I had\njust kind of pushing them away like what\nwere the feelings that you had like I\nwon't have sex but like whatever or you\nknow I want to have someone who's there\nfor me emotionally but whatever you know\njust kind of pushing it was he not there\na problem\nit sounds like he was very comforting\nafter your dad passed away was he not\nthere for you emotion no because the\nthing is my dad died like I dealt with\nthings in a humorous way so I would just\nmake jokes about it all the time so then\nyou know and I'm also pretty I don't\nknow I'm pretty good at dealing with\nemotional trauma have practice that's\nsad sorry Matt laughing nervously um but\nyeah we weren't I guess we just weren't\nreally we didn't really connect\nemotionally just not very good at\nhelping me with my anxiety which was the\nbiggest thing and I had a lot of anxiety\nwhat were you angry about I relationship\nanxiety a lot which is like um you know\nwhat is that really annoying I don't\nknow I guess just like I'd relationship\nanxiety like thinking maybe he wouldn't\nlike me anymore or you know maybe he\nwouldn't maybe he's gonna lose feelings\nfor me or you know whatever I think in\nthe beginning of the relationship I\nlatched so much onto I want this to last\nforever I want to marry this person that\nanything that could threaten that scared\nthe [ __ ] out of me and and then which is\nwhy as it moved on even though I know I\nshould have ended the relationship like\nwhile ago I didn't because it when I was\nhe personalizing so I was like whatever\nproblem doesn't exist and - I just\nwanted to make things work because when\nI was [ __ ] 18 I decided I'm gonna\nmarry this guy so you know yeah but why\ndid you want to make things work because\nI I loved him and I cared about the\nrelationship and I think uh I don't know\nmy I think um because he was the person\nit was there for my dad died like he\nkind of filled the void that my dad left\nI guess in a way you know someone who to\nspend time with who was there for me who\ntook care of me you know he would cook\nfor me sometimes and you know like he\nwas very very caring and very you know\nlike yeah so I guess it was did you feel\nlike you owed him um yeah I guess I owe\nit to him to keep my promise\nI guess what was your promise that I\nthat we'd get married and that we never\nvery good this is so weird to talk about\non the street what's weird to talk about\nI don't know this is the most\nemotionally vulnerable I've ever been on\nscreen like this is should I only really\ntalk about my therapist do you want to\nstop no it's whatever it's good it's\ngood to talk about things I think um you\nknow maybe I have a slight advantage\nover you because since I'm a Boomer\nsometimes I forget we're on stream I I\nwas forgetting to I think that was why I\nwas like it only it only helps to ignore\nthe thousands of people who are watching\nyeah I guess it's also scary cuz I don't\nwant to embarrass my ex boyfriend\nbecause maybe his friends are watching\nyou know what I mean so that's that sure\nso you you don't want sure good I mean I\nthink it's good that you don't want to I\nmean it's like he's coming on stream so\nhe didn't say you know yeah so so let's\njust think a little bit cuz I I think so\nlet me say this Kate I think that a lot\nof what people are gonna be taking away\nI I hope that what they take away is not\nspecific to you or your boyfriend I\nthink the whole whole reason that we\nstream to begin with is because what we\nfeel applies only to us actually applies\nto a hell of a lot more people like if\nthere's a single person who's watching\nwho actually hat has vaginismus and is\nsuper super embarrassed because they're\n18 years old and like just thinks that\ntheir vaginas\nand like just think about if you're a\nwoman who feels like your vagina is\nbroken like how much shame comes with\nthat and the fact that yeah shame is a\nbig one how some I don't know\nwell there I guess because I was\nsexually abused as a kid you know and a\nlot of shame came from that like I\nremember it I stupid\nI mean it's not that it you know it's\nsilly I guess I had this memory of when\nI was a kid and I was looking at these\nlike apples to apples cards and I was\nlike probably like seven or eight or\nsomething and when I was sexually abused\nI was like it was from like four to six\nit's like for a couple years and I was\nlooking at this like apples to apples\ncard and it was it said I'm pure and I\nremember thinking I looked at it I was\nlike crying thinking that I'm not pure\nand I'll never be pure because of what\nhappened to me and I guess that memory\njust sticks in my head of like shame\nfeeling ashamed for something that I\ndidn't ask for you know um yeah it's a\npowerful memory don't click around close\nyour eyes no no no tea you're gonna\nyou're gonna make like take this\nDragonite just close your eyes okay tell\nme what you feel it's hard to keep feel\nlike it's hard to keep my eyes closed\nabsolutely I'm looking I know and what\nyou want to look so so looking so let's\nexplain why we close our eyes when we\nmeditate oh yeah so I I hadn't thought\nabout that so if you if you want to open\nyour eyes to feel safe by all means open\nthem sorry for nothing\nsorry for what I interrupted you you\nknow no it's good I'm glad you did\nbecause you just taught me something\nabout you know when people\na history of sexual abuse closing your\neyes can make them feel vulnerable which\nis something that I should I should\nremember the reason that I was huh\nknow that about myself that closing my\neyes well that's what we're here to do\nthe reason I was asking you to close\nyour eyes is because I think generally\nspeaking when it so here's what I see\nyou you don't it's hard for you to sit\nwith what's on the inside and if we\nthink about our sense organs the purpose\nof our sense organs is to take our\nattention and put them to the outside\nright that's like literally what they do\nlike if I open my eyes and I see\nsomething then a fraction of my mental\nattention goes to the outside thing so\nwhat what instead of closing your eyes\nsince that maybe makes you feel a little\nbit vulnerable I want you to take your\nteacup and place it in front of you\nokay and I want you to look at the\ngrains of the wood on the teacup yes is\njust stare at the grains of your teacup\nand then tell me how you feel right now\nI guess I feel relieved like to be\ntalking about something that I guess I I\nfeel I feel happy because I know there's\nso many victims of sexual abuse who\nprobably watch this dream and I feel I'm\nhappy that they're not alone like no no\nno cuz it's scary it's scary to talk\nabout that stuff but if I was watching\nthis I know I'd be like wow that's\nreally cool you know that someone who\nwent through something similar to me is\nlike I can look at them but I guess to\nbe honest I also feel kind of guilty\nbecause this guy comes off we're gonna I\nthink but I feel bad anyone who has to\nrelate to me because I don't want them\nto think that they're a bad person\nbecause they have stuff in common with\nme and you feel like you're a bad person\nyeah yeah keep acting at the teacup\nokay now what do you feel no no so I'll\nask a leading question now is this the\nfeeling that you had when you were seven\nyears old and you looked at the\napples-to-apples card and it said pure\num I guess yeah ashamed I'm like tainted\nI can feel like I'll never be the same I\nfeel like I have like you know the\nScarlet Letter the book uh-huh\nI feel like I look at a on me forever\nyou know\nyeah do you think that you cheating on\nyour I'm gonna ask you another leading\nquestion\nokay so feel free to say no but do you\nfeel like you were destined to hurt\npeople because you are tainted I'm happy\nto hear that now I'm going to ask you\nsort of a weird question I'm hot because\nI think everyone has a lot of good in\nthem no one's really evil or a bad\nperson and I think everyone at their\ncore is like everyone maybe not everyone\nbut most people want to do good and I\nthink I'm one of those people where did\nyou get that idea where did you get the\nidea that you have a core of goodness I\nguess it's something that you kind of\nknow something that only you can know\nbecause if you can only know what if\nsomeone is good if you only know if\nyou're good placed on your actions when\nno one else is watching and I guess I'm\nthere when no one else is watching and\nso I think I'm a good person too I guess\nI guess I think both at different times\nyou know both what I'm a good and a bad\nperson okay then I guess we all are - so\nKate I'm gonna push you a little bit\nfurther okay so and if this is hurtful\nat some point you let me know and I'll\nget back pain is important sometimes I\nthink so I'm I'm gonna put together a\nversion of you which is going to\nbe like just half of you right so this\nis the person who looks at a card that\nsays pure and then thinks deep down that\nthis doesn't apply to them that you're\ntainted the person who has a brokerage\nina the person who you know cheats on\nsomeone who supported them and comforted\nthem and and there's that person how can\nthat person feel like they're good\nbecause that's that's not all there is -\nso tell us what else there is what else\nwhat have you show me the rest of it and\nthen yeah I like to cook for people I\ndon't know it makes me happy to make\nother people like feel good and like\ntake care of them sure I like to show\npeople music make them happy I like to\ndrive people around I like to help\npeople when they're sad I love when\npeople come to me when they're sad or\nanxious it makes me really happy to help\nthem because they trust me and I guess I\nguess I know that I have a really hard\ntime opening up to people interesting\npeople and I'm glad that they have\nsomeone to trust and open up to and I'm\nalso glad that I can be that I'm glad\nthat I can experience that side of them\nbecause recently I've been trying open\nup to myself more and everyone else and\nreally talk about my feelings because\nI'm really bad at being sad and it's\nbecause of my PTSD you know and all my\npassionate cuz you know like that was\nreally hard and then my Papa died he was\nmy mom's dad when I was 11 and then my\ndad died and you know it's just like a\nlot you know for someone young to go\nthrough and so from all that I guess I\njust became really good at like D\npersonalizing and like pushing all my\nbad feelings away and not thinking about\nthem because it was easier now that I'm\nreally\ntrying to open up and process my bad\nfeelings and tell people when I'm\nanxious and sad and like not just deal\nwith it on my own I guess\nwell so many thought yeah I don't I\ndon't think you lost your train of\nthought I think your train of thought is\nforming no I mean I I think I think the\nthoughts in your mind are not like a\ntrain that you lose it's like a tree\nthat's growing and so thoughts start to\nsprout and then they're kind of like\nhalf formed but they're not like really\nfully formed yet and you're just in the\nprocess of like growing your\nunderstanding about yourself that's\nreally beautiful yeah I'm big about\nnature analogies I love analogies dude\nno it's interesting there right so we\nblame ourselves for not speaking clearly\nor not understanding ourselves we we\nexpect of ourselves an omniscient\nunderstanding and also a perfect\narticulation but but we're just figuring\nourselves out as we talk you know like\nwe're learning about ourselves while\nwe're explaining ourselves to other\npeople yeah which is why it's so\nimportant to talk about your feelings\nbecause you can learn so much about\nyourself - yeah Oh putting on it feels\nreally can I ask a I'm sure so we you\nmentioned that your grandfather passed\naway when you were 11\ncan you tell me about that you said oh\nthat's a lot for a kid to deal with yeah\nwhat I mean obviously but you know what\nwas he was like my main father figure in\nmy life um my my papa\nis what I called him he was my my mom's\ndad and I lived with him up until I was\nlike seven or something so we and I\ndidn't live my parents my mom's a\nlesbian my parents got divorced when\nthey I was six months old and so my dad\nalways lived like two hours away but\nhe's always very like it was never the\ndynamic of like oh it is my dad care\nabout me it was always more the opposite\nwhich makes me feel guilty now -\nespecially that he's dead that\nhe was always kind of looking for my\naffection rather than me looking for his\noh and try that my pop yeah my papa was\num was yeah go ahead sorry I'm just no I\nwas just curious though in what ways was\nyour dad looking for your affection you\nwould try to like buy me stuff or try to\nlike I don't know he just I think he\nalways felt that he cared about me a lot\nmore than I cared about him and I think\nthat was true to a certain extent and I\nthink a big part of that is because I\nwas really young and dumb and I really\nwish that he could see now that he's\ngone like how much I [ __ ] care about\nhim you know like even even when he died\nlike I don't think my brother thought I\ncared that much you know it was like I\nguess that was another way to call like\ngod I'm so terrible expressing my\nemotions and like how I feel about\npeople that like my own brother thought\nthat I didn't really care that much that\nmy dad that I did like God I'm [ __ ]\n[ __ ] that what I'm getting better\nwhy didn't your brother think that you\ndidn't care that your dad passed away I\nthink cuz I joke around a lot Kyle this\ntoo though my brother um but I don't\nknow I guess cuz I was so [ __ ]\n[ __ ] I was 17 when he died you know\nlike I was a senior in high school I was\njust like not focused on him I would\nwhen I was in place and shows I'd forget\nto tell him about it even though that's\nall he wanted to do is just see me\nperform and sing and you know what do\nyou what are you feeling now I just kind\nof stressed out yeah you seemed amped up\nso go back to looking at your teacup oh\noh okay nothing just discord lighting\njust look at your teacup for a second\nand then tell me what you feel\nokay the grains I feel like I I should\ngo back to explaining about my papa\nI also I don't know I think I just lost\nmy feeling I have a habit of doing that\nyup trying to make myself laugh or\nfeeling something else really quick and\nand losing the feeling what do I have a\nlot of trouble crying if I ever feel\nlike crying I I like cry for like 20\nseconds and then it's done it's really\nhard for me to cry unless it's out of\njoy or Kate can you hold on a second so\nbeautiful my two-year-old seems to be\nhaving a meltdown I'm gonna be right\nyeah yeah let's go pee if you need to\nyeah hey Frankie how you doing I'm doing\nwell\nokay strong work so far how you feeling\nyeah I'm good I just you know had a\nlittle bit of a hoof in the bathroom but\nit was good good yeah what was those a\nlittle bit of like what is that I'm\ngonna anxiety that's not a real word\nyeah what what were you anxious about I\nfeel um maybe it wasn't I guess it just\nwasn't really the right feeling maybe I\nthink it was I was overwhelmed with my\nemotions and also I feel good because I\nopened my discord and I just saw a\nmessage from like a viewer that just\nsaid like like I I love you and I just\ndon't know and then my mom's are\nwatching and and they're they just they\ntext me and said they're crying and they\nlove me and they're proud of me so so I\nguess it's like overwhelmed but happy\nyeah so it sounds like there's a lot of\npositive emotion and a lot of negative\nemotion that's swirling around inside\nyou like a washing machine I love\nokay so let's go back to your pop pop\npop tell me about your Papa uh he's\npretty cool he's kind of epic cool guy\nyeah my mom was at work a lot growing up\nso she definitely liked my mom and I\nwere really close growing up but my dad\nwas you know I seemed like every weekend\npretty much my mom worked a lot but we\nwere so really close but my papa was\nlike always home when I was home you\nknow and when you're like when you're\nreally really young that's when your\nhome the most often and he was just\nalways there for me\nmy brother and I talk about this a lot\nlike how my dad more raised my brother\nand my Papa more raised me and that\ncaused a lot of differences in us and\nlosing way and um one thing is like my\ndad was kind of he he was an alcoholic\nand so he wasn't always that nice to my\nbrother um and you know kind of would he\njust wasn't that nice and or supportive\na lot of the time you know he was\njudgmental of him and you know the kind\nof parent who would be like I don't know\nI I wasn't there but long story short he\nwasn't a nice woman and my Papa just\ntreated me like I don't know I think\nhe's the reason I'm so like extroverted\nand bubbly and um curious now like the\nreason I have any cheese he treated me\nso patiently he taught me to read when I\nwas like really young really really\nyoung like I think it's headed reading\nwhen I was like 2 or 3 or something like\nreally young he just answered all my\nquestions was always so patient\nencouraged me to be curious I really\nliked dancing and singing as a kid and\nlike acting and stuff so I would like\ndance and sing on the fireplace for like\nhours and you never ever make me stop\nyou just sit there and support me and\nencourage me and you know make me sleepy\nsoup and he was just so lonely yeah he\nwas just so amazing and then he got\ndementia which was holy [ __ ] like wow\nyou know he got the men\nyeah hold on a second yeah well holy\n[ __ ] Wow let's translate that okay um\nholy [ __ ] Wow is roughly translated -\nthat was very hard for like I don't I\nthink I think I went up like two years\nso like nine year old k2 process sure I\nmean I miss rent like we were two peas\nin a [ __ ] pot it was always Katy and\nPapa always together hmm\nand and what what was it like - I mean\nwhat did you understand back then\nunderstand yeah well I don't know I just\nknew that I was watching the person who\nraised me and Wow I was watching him\ndeteriorate and I didn't understand it\nfandom he died when I was like 11 I was\nlike two weeks before I started middle\nschool I think and um and I remember\neveryone like flew down all my family\nflew in and he's in the hospital we all\nknew he's gonna die it was like a long\nlong process you know true where you\nknow like I'm sure you or you know a lot\nof people watching and probably dealt\nwith you know um people they know having\ndementia or Alzheimer's and um so hard\nseeing them like forget about you of\ncourse like as a kid I didn't really\nunderstand it but I'd also you know gone\nthrough a lot of the kids so I think\nmentally\nI'd already learned how to do\npersonalized and how to push things away\nso it was like you know I didn't feel\nlike I was them at the time yeah and but\nI remember wind whenever would use in\nthe hospital and everyone know he was\ngonna die like that night road knew how\nclose poplin I worry about everyone is\nin his hospital room there's like a lot\nof us and and I remember they're all\ntaking turns saying goodbye to him and\nholding his hand and everyone kept\ntelling me go go hold his hand\nI wouldn't and I just would not I just\nkept saying no no I don't like I don't\nwant to and I think obviously like that\nmakes a lot of sense with how I handle\nthings now just like pushing things away\nit's not real don't worry about it just\ndon't help us understand what makes\nsense to you now\num do cousin together for us um it makes\nsense now because how bad I am at\nexpressing and processing my emotions so\nI just kind of ignore them and focus on\nsomething else when you say you're bad\nat processing emotions is that like\nbasically like you saying my vagina's\nbroke someone's gonna break an emotional\nprocessing unit no I used it actually\nwhen I was in high school I used to\nthink of my brain like a broken clock\nlike I just did not understand like I\njust did not understand how to process\nemotions or how to how to be and there's\njust I think it was just because of like\nthe sexual abuse thing really really set\nme up for failure in that department so\ncan I just say something I don't think\nthat you're bad at processing emotions\nwhat do you think about that\nI don't maybe I'm open to your\ninterpretation an opinion so so here's\nhere's what I think happened I think\nwhen people get sexually abused and I\nknow this is gonna sound kind of weird\nbut I'm not even so sure that there may\nhave been more there than that like I\ndon't want to point to that as the\nsmoking gun but I think what happens is\nso the reason that you D personalizes\nlike so this is well understood and\npeople who have trauma from a young age\nthat they dissociate and they D\npersonalize and that's essentially a\nprotective mechanism yes it is and and\nso I think rather than thinking about it\nis you being bad at processing emotions\nwhat I want you to understand is that\nyou almost have like an emotional\nresistance and every time like with\nsexual trauma essentially what it does\nis it like jacks up your emotional\nresistance and so you're like immune to\nany kind of emotional damage the problem\nis that that also makes you like color\nblind to all kinds of stuff and what I'm\nhearing from your life is that you\nessentially\nlike our leveling up your\ndepersonalization skill was like it's\nlike Oh like let's let's like let's love\nlike let's buy this skill when you're\nsexually abused and then when Papa dies\naway it's like yeah let's dump some more\npoints into that scale and then your dad\npasses away and it's like yeah let's\ndump some more points into that skill\nand then then the tricky thing in life\nis that like what makes life hard is\nthat we use the skills that we're best\nat which sort of makes sense right like\nthat's how [ __ ] works like you just do\nwhat you're kind of good at because\nthat's what you lean on it's not like\nyou wake up one day and you're like I'm\ngonna instead of walk I'm going to swim\nacross the ground you just don't do\nstupid things like ignore things that\nyou're good at your body's like this is\nhow we move from point A to point B if\nwe are on a solid surface and that's the\nskill that we use because that's what\nwe've used our entire life and what I'm\nhearing from you and I think it's really\nawesome that you piece this together for\nyourself but I want to kind of even dig\na little bit deeper and recognize that\nyou're not bad at processing emotions\nbeing resistant to your emotions has\nbeen a survival skill for you yeah\nbecause watching yeah so watching you're\nyour best friend in your primary\ncaretaker start to crumble from the\ninside and like him to not recognize you\nlike that [ __ ] is enough to traumatize\nyou you know even without the sexual\nabuse and the sexual abuse is enough to\ntraumatize you any one of those is\nenough to [ __ ] you up for life and then\nyou toss in like a little bit of that\nvaginismus and now we're vaginas broke\nmotions are broke yeah and then get the\ninternet hating on you\noh that's great love that honestly\nthough I'm so lucky that I'm good at the\nsurvival instinct of it's not my friend\nyes so I want to explain this I would\nthis exactly my point is it's not luck\nit's like lip it's not luck that you're\ngood at this\nit's something that you have your brain\nhas and psyche and stuff is like leveled\nup it's like you're not immune to\nemotions because of luck you're immune\nto emotions because you've leveled that\n[ __ ] up your entire life yep and yep yes\nI mean you've got a lot of hurt in there\nsomewhere in the OL noggin but yeah I\nthink when I when I lost my Papa like\nthe it was really hard to I don't know\nthat's when I started becoming like a\nweird kid you know like hey not that\nthese things are weird but people I also\nwent to a Catholic school so that was\nreally hard too because I saw all the\nsame people all the time and they were\nreally judgmental especially like my\nidol lesbian mother so they all [ __ ]\nhate like judge me because of that\nand I dealt with that a lot in middle\nschool in elementary school and then I\nalso like the the sexual [ __ ] they\ndidn't know about that stuff but because\nI grew up in a Catholic environment it\nmade it way worse than I felt super\nimpure you know and I felt even more\nshamed because of all the Catholic stuff\nbut I also got really into like like\nrole-playing online you know like I got\nreally into the internet life when my\nPapa died um you know and then they\ncould pay man I don't really know\nwizard101 and take down and making\ninternet friends because I didn't like\nthe people that I met in real life you\nknow or I got really into horror movies\nwelcome sister embrace us for we didn't\nreally the Internet's\nand you belong here and I got really in\nthe horror like I love horror movies\nscore I love that stuff and I think it\nwas because death at a young age you\nknow and then what I got what you keep\ndoing that where you say you know what\nis that I think there's value to what\nyou say I just I I'd like to understand\nthe rest of it [ __ ] see okay so a way\nfor me to connect people when I talk to\nthem to make sure they're on the same\npage as me maybe I don't know you know\nokay so so you you became one of us yes\nand I got really into that and now\nactually through all this like the last\ntwo months I've realized that I win my\npapa died so handling my Papa's death\nwhich I didn't even realize I was\nhandling that until I went to therapy\nand I talked about like we talked about\nhistory of depression whatever and I\ntalked about how I was pretty depressed\nin middle school and I didn't know why\nuntil she was like when I do pop then I\nwas like oh right before I started\nmiddle school she's like I was like oh\nall right like that's why I was so\n[ __ ] sad in middle school my papa\ndied right and I feel like losing him\nversus dealing with my sexual abuse\nversus dealing with my dad dying versus\nlike this I would compare my papa\nand this situation dealing with these\nlast two months the most similar to each\nother how they feel and a big part of\nthat is because I guess I've kind of\ntaken to like I want to watch horror\nmovies again and you know like scare\nmyself again I don't know how to talk\nabout this okay yeah no I mean I think\nit's just it's growing that that trees\ngrowing that's all so tell me when you\nsay when you say this is the most\nsimilar that you felt to I mean this\nfeels the most like when your your Papa\ndied how do you feel right now or over\nthe last\nor you know how's that been for you well\nit's really weird um it's really weird I\nguess it they're not like super similar\nI would just compare it to that more\nthan the other stuff that I've gone\nthrough and you know when my dad died I\nalso was going through my first real\nbreak up at the same time like we broke\nup like just a little bit before so that\nwas very hard so it sounds like this\nmost recent relationship was all coming\noff the back of a breakup and your dad\npassing away it was a it was months\nafter but yeah okay okay it was pretty\ngood but can you tell me a little bit\nabout your dad's passing and what that\nwas like for you I was in high school\nand I actually had just seen him that\nweekend we my brother and I and he lived\nwhere I live now in the town I used to\ndo hours away and we would come up here\nsometime because to go Disney and stuff\nand we would stay at his place and I\nwould uh I don't know we have seen this\nplace when we had to spend time together\nand the last time I see last time I ever\nsaw him was Friday and he died on a\nSunday or Monday it was a 16th of\nOctober 2017 um and we we had gone to a\nto a hockey game and like spent the\nwhole weekend together the weekend\nbefore and in that weekend Kyle and I\nwent out to go to Disney and he cooked\nus breakfast and it was really nice and\nit was really good and I remember\nfeeling like wow my relationship with my\ndad right now\nis really good like I feel good and I\nfor a while I actually thought I he's\nbipolar\nand I thought I was bipolar as well for\na while but I was like nah I'm not\nbipolar and then now my therapist thinks\nI might be by anyway that's a good point\nI was really relating to him based on\nlike how he felt emotionally and we were\nlike having deep talks finally about our\nemotion\num even though you know sometimes he was\none time for it he was drunk and I was\nvery uncomfortable about that but\nwhatever after that when he died I\nremember because I had gone through a\nbreakup right and after the breakup I\nwas like cuz it was a long-distance\nrelationship - so after that breakup I\njust kind of wanted to go go go go go go\ngo I never want to be home kind of\nscared of being alone scared of being in\nmy room because that's where we always\ntalked on you know on skype and and so I\nwas dill go go go go for however long it\nwas like a month or two and then mmm\nwhen my dad died it was like wolf\neverything kind of stopped and I didn't\nhave energy to go go go and how did he\npass away hypertension and alcoholism\nwas though okay so I didn't fix cutely\nor was it like do you just he drank\nhimself like he drank his whole life but\nthe thing was he had just gone to the\ndoctor like a few weeks before and got\nhe was bragging everyone like clean bill\nof health\nit was seven I mean no sudden we we all\nkind of we tossed around the idea of\nlike god dad drinks have [ __ ] on and\nhe smokes a fuckton and like you know\ngeez you know but it was sudden I was\nvery I was surprised I guess I knew it\nwould happen but I did not know what\nhappened then I guess what death is you\nknow what's gonna happen but you don't\nknow what Kate can I ask you and sorry\nif this question is insensitive but if\nyour mom is a lesbian\nhow did your parents get together where\ndid you like so mom was Catholic as well\nand she was raised that being King is\nwrong and so she fell in love with my\ndad and how she describes it is she's\nnot bisexual because I've asked her this\nquestion because that's confusing she\ndescribes it as um basically she fell in\nlove with my dad who he was as a person\nbut she was always like attracted to\nwomen you know what I mean\nI had sex and they had children but it\nwasn't until after they got divorced and\nshe actually divorced him because of his\nalcoholism not because she was lesbian\nafter they got divorced she was like I'm\na LESBIAN I'm gonna live my life as a\nlesbian yeah that I hope that explains\njust sort of a job and my mom has been\nwait the same woman\ndawn who's my second mom for like 10 or\n11 years now so she's been here for a\nwhile and she's is really nice socks\ngoing from three parents to two but you\nknow still got to it's okay yeah um okay\nso you just so how you feeling right now\ngood you you you look like you feel good\nmm-hmm\nanything in particular that you want to\ntalk more about no I mean I guess\nthere's a lot of stuff to talk about but\nI don't know what I don't know is there\nanything you were like anything that's\nstuck out to you yeah so let me um let\nme try to explain how I understand what\nthis conversation has been like because\nin a sense it's been all over the place\nyeah and and I think that that's okay so\nlike sometimes you know when we talk to\npeople there's like a particular thing\nbut I think in your case the main theme\nthat I'm getting at is you know this\nidea of emotional processing and the\navoidance of emotions and for us to try\nto understand that like it's not that\nyour brain is broke and it's just that\nyou know vaginismus I think is one\nexample of emotions being manifested in\nthe body so I talk a lot a lot about\nthis because people don't understand\nwhat their emotions are I don't think\nyou understand what your emotions are\nyou know you feel a lot and I think that\nyou're just not ready or capable yet of\nsitting with what that feeling is and\nputting words to it but I'm getting the\nsense that there are large pockets of\nemotion that have been present through\nmany parts of your life because we'll\nsee you get emotion\nnatira and and like you can you have\nlike stories you have pictures right so\nit's almost like the way that you\ndescribe your life is depersonalization\nso you can't tell us how you feel but\nyou can paint us a picture of a seven\nyear old girl looking at an\napples-to-apples card you can paint us a\npicture of an eleven year old girl and I\nknow you're feeling things I'm just\ngonna keep plowing forward okay so so\nyou can paint us a picture of an 11 year\nold girl who doesn't want to tell their\ngrandfather goodbye and I imagine that\nyou feel some degree of guilt over that\nyou know you can like like there's a lot\nthere's a there's a parent who's who\nlongs for your affection and and you\nknow tried to win you over and you\ndidn't honor that in the way that maybe\nyou should have and so you feel guilt\nover that and and so you can paint us\nall these pictures and that's that's I\nthink actually is a really good\nrepresentation of what your life has\nbeen like you don't know exactly what\nthe person in the picture is feeling but\nyou can get as far as yeah death sucks\nam i right and like that's kind of like\nwhere you are right now and I think it's\ngreat that you're you know at least you\nyou're accessing them and so it's sort\nof like I don't know if you've ever been\nto like a really delicious restaurant\nwhere you eat something like you know\nmaybe like really good guac and then\nlike you don't know exactly what's in\nthere but you know it's really delicious\nand you're like is that a little bit of\ngarlic a little bit of lime a little bit\nof cilantro is there like some onion\npowder in there and so and it's like\nwhat's in there right what's in there\ndude exactly and and I what what I'm\nseeing from you is that you know you\nyou've figured out that like there are\nemotions in these areas and you can\nconnect to some degree of shame or some\ndegree of being impure I was actually\nreally happy to hear that you know you\ndo have a sense of your goodness and\nthat you can sit with this like\ndichotomy of like 'hey i can be a piece\nof [ __ ] sometimes\nbut i'm also like a fundamentally good\nperson\nor I can believe that about myself but\nthis this experience like with that was\nso hard I thought I was a bad person for\na long time and then in high school I\nrealized like no I'm not I am just\nemotionally closed off because I thought\nit was a bad person in the sense that\nlike you know girls that I be friends\nwith would be like your [ __ ] you know\nyou're insensitive cuz I make jokes that\nwere me and or I would just like I was\njust really bad at expressing my\nemotions you know and so they thought I\ncame across was really cold like I will\nnever forget there's this one [ __ ]\ngirl\nI'll never get this she said to me if\nshe said to someone else actually kate\nhas no empathy and that is burn in my\nhead forever especially because god damn\nit I have held that girl's hair while\nshe threw up no one else would I am so\nbad at watching people throw up sick but\n[ __ ] like she would she would throw up\nand I would hold her hair I've been in\nlike five plus times that [ __ ] dude I\nhave empathy okay I just don't express\nthe same way yeah but yeah I really was\na good person later it's officially cuz\ndo you get sick when other people throw\nup that's an expression of empathy\nexactly so I think you know as is common\nis that a lot of people who have you\nknow are emotionally closed off will\nhave physical manifestations of their\nemotions like vaginismus or like you\nknow sickness in their stomach or like\nthey'll have GI problems or things like\nthat\noftentimes but anyway just kind of going\nback to go ahead sorry I was like\nAudrina thought and then I got\nsidetracked by that story oh well I was\ntalking so I was just talking your sense\nof goodness and I think I were you were\nkind of thinking about oh yeah this\n[ __ ] thought that I wasn't a good\nperson but I was because I held her\n[ __ ] hair while she beaut and how dare\nshe oh there she and I think it's really\nremarkable that you you do have a sense\nof goodness because I've met many people\nwho have been through half of\nwhat you've been through and they're\npretty convinced that there are other\npieces of [ __ ] on the inside\nessentially that that seven-year-old\ngirl in the way that she felt kind of\ncarries with them so I'm kind of curious\nabout really two or three two things\nthen I can offer a couple of other\ntopics one is like the one emotion it's\nkind of interesting you know there's one\nemotion that I think has been very very\nabsent over the course of our entire\nconversation and I'm kind of curious if\ntwitch chat can figure out what it is\nI'm gonna look at twitch chat is that\nokay let's see what they say\nokay ah beautiful they got it right away\nyeah that's so good twitch chat I'm very\nimpressed because it's usually the\nemotion that we see the most stuff\nactually on this stream yeah I do not I\ndo not I'm not at all yeah so that's not\nhow we work right so so so let me just\nlike I was oh my god wait that's\nimportant actually could I tell you\nbrothers really quick sure\nI was like terrible I was a terrible kid\nreally really bad angry outbursts like a\nlot a lot of really angry outbursts like\nI would just have these meltdowns just\nlike don't talk to me yeah like really\nterrible when I was a kid but then they\njust went away like I don't feel him\nanymore I feel I think I don't know I\nmean I get angry sometimes but I think\nI'm good at expressing my anger in a way\nthat's not angry did that make sense\nsure but do you feel anger sometimes\nyeah but I just feel anger about any of\nthis stuff because it's just sad okay so\nyou know not I mean different people\nexperience different levels of emotion I\nfeel anger towards that girl who [ __ ]\nI see that there we go\nyeah and and so far you know if I want\nto ask a cut like so here's the first\nthing so let's just think about this for\na second so you say that I don't really\nfeel angry and sure you have anger bits\nof anger here and there but generally\nspeaking I think that you know some\npeople\ncertain emotions more than other\nemotions and and it just seems like\nthere's a remarkable absence of anger in\nso much of what you're saying like I\nknow this sounds kind of weird but\noftentimes children who have parents who\ndie or angry at their parent for dying\nit's not logical but it's oftentimes how\npeople feel you know oftentimes people\nwho end up in relationships where they\nfeel stuck which it sounds like you felt\nstuck and we're not saying that that\njustifies anything that you did or\ndidn't do but oftentimes people will\nfeel anger towards the person who keeps\nthem stuck or they will feel anger\ntowards themselves I'm curious do you\nfeel anger towards your ex-boyfriend or\ntowards yourself towards myself\nsometimes that that's been really really\nhard I wanted to talk to you about that\nthat's been really hard over the past\ntwo months like dealing with cuz I dealt\nwith trauma before but dealing with when\nmy dad died and my boyfriend broke up\nwith me\nyou kind of know how to deal with that\nstuff you know like okay this [ __ ]\nhappened to me I didn't do anything\nwrong I just have to sit and be sad and\nI can do whatever I want with that\nsadness with those emotions people\nunderstand what I'm going through I just\nlost a parent you know like it was hard\nbut this is so different because I\n[ __ ] up I made the bad decisions I'm\nthe bad guy I'm the villain here there's\nno way that this story can make me be\nthe good guy I'm the bad guy here you\nknow and and um I guess that's just so\nbeen so hard to deal with and it's been\nit's really hard to grapple with being\nangry with myself because I think I've\nalways been really good at loving myself\nthroughout everything pretty much also\nskill you level out by the way hmm\nalso a skill do you leveled up by the\nway yeah definitely yeah I think I'm\nvery confident and good with myself\nwhich is good\nit's real you know I'm very proud of\nmyself for levelling it up but I felt\nlike cuz I guess\nyou go through all this trauma and\nyou're bad at expressing it the person\nthat you feel like is always there for\nyou the only person you feel like you\ncan trust is you and so I guess I just\ngained a lot of confidence in myself in\nmy kid I can teach myself can you tell\nus how you leveled up your self-love\nbecause I think that's something a lot\nof people struggle with I remember when\nI was in middle school and I really\nreally was dealing with it I think I\njust like kids just looked at me like I\nwas weird you know they were not very\nnice to me and it was hard for a while\nand I really didn't like myself for a\nwhile but then the way I did it was just\nfake it to you make it I just it's\nreally like I just acted like I used\ninstead of using self-deprecating humor\nI've always been a very person you know\ncomedy focused person so I always abused\njokes and humor to cope with stuff and\nwhatever as you can see obviously it's\nlooking a lot but I was I would um make\njokes about how I was the best make\njokes about how I'm the [ __ ] you know\nand maybe that's not the best way to go\nabout it but eventually it's like when\npeople when you force people to view you\nas confident by telling them you're\nconfident then you become confident and\nthat was probably not the best way to go\nabout it but I think it was a\ncombination of that and trust in myself\nafter dealing with so much [ __ ] that I\ncan always get through it and I have the\npower to get through this and I don't\nknow that explains it very well yeah\nsorry I think how did you develop the\ntrust in yourself that you're gonna get\nthrough it\nexperience not like just I have so\nI thought I can get behind yeah cool so\nyou were saying something about anger\ntowards yourself because you are at\nfault here so in the past I survived so\njust to kind of catch people up so\nhere's what I remember the frame of the\nconversation so in the past you've been\nable to get through it because you\nrecognize that like this wasn't your\nfault this was just bad [ __ ] happening\nto you and you've survived it before so\nyou're you can survive it again but this\ntime it's different because it's not bad\n[ __ ] happening to you it's you you're\nthe villain and so it's not the same\n[ __ ] yeah it's really it's been so hard\nto deal with\nnot that I what's been hard to deal with\nI guess going through something really\nhard but I'm not the victim you know\ndoes that make sense yeah makes a lot of\nsense um so I think what's hard about\ngoing through something when you're not\nthe victim very impressive by the way\nthat your psychology has not done some\nsort of mental gymnastics to make you\nthe victim that's usually what people do\nseriously I'm not that's not a joke it's\nlike yeah no I'm not I'm not victim um\nthe hardest part is definitely the hurt\nI put these people I care about through\ncuz I care so much about the people that\nI hurt and yet I still did it and\ngetting wrapping your head around that\nand just to regret and the hindsight is\ntwenty-twenty you know looking back and\nthinking god I [ __ ] could have done\nit differently and I didn't and just\nkind of it's easy to be upset with\nyourself it's easy to hate yourself it's\neasy to not trust yourself because no\none else can so why should you you know\nand and it was really hard because I had\nbeen\none there from me the whole time they\ncut through all my whole life and now am\nI even there for me anymore like do I\neven love myself anymore do I even trust\nmyself anymore you know and and that was\nthe main thing I struggled with I'd say\nstruggled yeah you use the past tense\nfor that so have you come to summit yeah\nI have forgiven myself it was like\neveryone else around me had to forgive\nme and I did too which was weird\nthat was something I never dealt with\nbefore I thought I'd die I'd deal with\nbut I you forgive yourself understanding\nwhat did you learn why and that I won't\ndo it again I think that's the biggest\nthing I having confidence that I won't\ndo it again is the thing that helped me\nforgive myself the most and I have that\nconfidence now where does that\nconfidence come from understanding why\ndon't you understand why I did it and\nwhatever lots of things um feeling stuck\nnot communicating my feelings not\nprocessing what I was feeling choosing\nto push that away and now I'm making a\npoint to be brutally honest which not\noption but you know my therapist says\nit's like a pendulum so when you when\nyou have so much force and resistance\none way and you're like [ __ ] I'm lying\nabout [ __ ] all the time and then you\njust you'll you know swing the other way\nso right now I'm in a more of a brutal\nhonest kind of area where I want to I\nover communicate which is I'm trying to\nwork on finding a balance sure right now\nI don't know why I was asking you you\nknow what why did you do what you do and\nwhat did you understand about yourself\nand so tell say you felt stuck\nyeah I felt I don't stuck I felt I felt\npulled a lot of things but but no anger\nanger towards myself I guess it's like\nthe anger I feel is very like God okay\nyou're such an idiot but then when I\nfeel anger a lot of times I'm able to\njust like feel it for a second I just\nkind of laugh about it okay okay cuz\nit's like [ __ ] I'm a dumb [ __ ] like I\n[ __ ] up holy [ __ ] but you know\nsometimes you have to laugh at yourself\nyou know [ __ ] stupid you are\nsometimes yes or anything that's\nimportant I think um you know I'm\nnoticing something that I think is maybe\nwhere your confidence comes from I think\nyou own who you are yeah yeah I accepted\nI guess I accepted that I was a liar I\naccepted these labels I accepted that I\nwas a liar that I was a cheater I\naccepted that I did not prioritize\nanyone but myself even if I didn't do it\nfrom a malicious place my the outcome\nhurt people very badly I accepted those\nthings and I accepted that I did it and\naccepting that and accept it I'm able to\nforgive myself because I didn't push the\nblame onto anyone or anything else\nexcept for me and accepting that blame\nmakes it easier to move on because it's\nit's like the restores balance I suppose\nyeah I think that's a very very\nimportant principle which is that if you\nyou know if you blame I don't even know\nhow exactly it says but if you blame\nsomeone else for your problems you first\nof all aren't in control of your life\nbecause it's there\nfault not yours and the other\ninteresting thing is that if you make\nexcuses for yourself or other people\nthen you can't forgive because if\nthere's an excuse there isn't a sin and\nif there isn't a sin\nthere's no capacity for forgiveness so I\nthink of a big problem that I hear a lot\nfrom our community is that like how they\nasked like how do I commit I mean how do\nI forgive myself how do i more and how\ndo I move past this and the first\nproblem is that they make excuses and so\nif I make an excuse like there's nothing\nto move past from because there's it's\nnot my fault there's no need to accept\nwho you are and it's a really powerful\nthing to stop making excuses for\nyourself and also a very hard thing\nbecause a lot of times making it not\nmaking excuses for yourself is to let\nthat part of you that feels like you're\ntainted take control and then beat the\n[ __ ] out of you which is not the same\nit's a really fine tightrope to you know\nnot let your shame take over but like\nlet it have a seat at the table because\na lot of times what people will do is\nthey're like I'm a piece of [ __ ] and\nthen they start like this whole like\nrant about how they're awful people and\nthat's not mourning or acceptance that's\njust you ranting yeah I guess the reason\nI'm not angry with myself anymore the\nreason I don't blame my I mean I blame\nmyself but you know the reason I'm not I\nunderstand myself and I think I think I\nlearned that especially in the past in\nthe past month specifically I deserve\nunderstanding just as much as everyone\nelse does the understanding that I give\nto my friends when they come to me about\na problem or a mistake they made the\nunderstanding I give to people in the\ninternet who make mistakes the\nunderstanding you get to anyone when\nthey are honest and vulnerable with you\nI deserve that too and I deserve to give\nmyself that and I think by allowing\nmyself to understand myself it was a lot\neasier for me to move on from it do you\ndeserve forgiveness from others maybe\nnot I think that's a person-by-person\nyou know I think that's up to everyone\nto decide that's a good like oh yeah I\nthink\nI have a lot of friends that I lost\nthrough who will never forgive me and\nthat was awful like people that I love\nlove now will never talk to me again um\nbut that's okay\nit's consequences like people people\nfrom my life outside you know who had\nnothing to do with twitch not my\nroommate so here it's been wonderful but\nother people like I one of my best\nclosest friends there were two weeks\nwhere he didn't even talk to me now\nsince then we have become very very\nclose but and not like that I know\nthere's like a joke like no it's not but\num but I I think there's just so much\nloss in such little time of respect for\nmyself from other people\nI felt like my job was gone my so many\nmy you know longest relationship was\nover my other relationships were gone\nlike so much loss and the biggest one\nwas the loss of respect for myself and\nlove for myself but I gained it back and\nI feel good now and I accepted that I'm\nthe reason I lost those things and I can\ngain them back if I want to strong words\nThanks I kind of feel like that's a\nthat's a good place to end but what are\nyou yeah no no yeah we can do whatever\nyou want no it's just a you know I\nreally liked what you said there because\nit's sort of like so I like that you\ndon't feel like you're entitled to\nanyone elses forgiveness because I don't\nthink you are I think it's fair to\nexpect others to try to understand and\nand we've had there's it's interesting\nbecause I remember actually we had a\nstream with this guy named LS now a\ncouple of months ago and there was this\none point where he was kind of sharing\nso he he would he was like bad as a kid\nand would like I think he was like in\ncourt or something as a child\nand I don't remember the exact or maybe\nit was a school like tribunal or\nsomething and then everyone was kind of\ntrying to figure out like what to do in\nterms of punishing him and then there\nwas only like one person in the room who\nwas like we need to be asking ourselves\nwhy this kid is doing this [ __ ] in the\nfirst place because people don't usually\ndo this and and I think a lot of people\nare very quick to judge and I'm not\nsaying that people should not judge I'm\nnot saying you're entitled to\nforgiveness but I do think the world\nwould be a far better place if along\nwith our judgment we tried a dose of\nunderstanding and and I think it's it's\na really tricky I mean you really walk\nin a tightrope Kate which makes me think\nthat you're you really have grown and\nand I respect you because you don't\nbelieve that you deserve forgiveness\nfrom other people because you don't no\none deserves forgiveness forgiveness is\nfor someone else to give if they want to\nyou're not entitled to [ __ ] from anyone\nelse when it comes to forgiveness\nand and I do think you should try to\nforgive yourself but that too is not\nsomething you're entitled to myself yeah\nI see that that that's abundantly clear\nto me and you know just in terms of you\nknow so I I know that there are concerns\nabout how the internet feels about you I\nhave no idea what's gonna happen after\nthis and I hope that you know you they\ndon't attack is fine I hope they don't\ntake you guys I mean hasn't happened yet\nbut I'm sure it will one day knock on\nboys and and you know if you do kind of\nstruggle from some of this stuff from\nfrom time to time then then or if\nthere's some kind of aftermath and we\ncan support you through that feel free\nto let us know but overall I think it's\nbeen awesome talking to you I think it\nwas awesome that you shared as much as\nyou did about so many different things\nso sometimes I teach people how to\nmeditate are you interested in that\nyeah I when I have panic\naxé I meditate I meditation kind of yeah\nI can see that\nso in a sense I actually already taught\nyou a technique do you have a sense of\nwhat I'm talking about\nNo so like when I was asking you to look\nat the Oh Cup and I don't know if you\nnoticed but I think your your more\nemotionally accessible and you're able\nto articulate sometimes a little bit\nbetter when you're looking at the cup\nand and maybe that's just my perception\nbut so I'd say maybe well so I'd\nrecommend a sensory technique for you\nbecause it sounds like you do those\nalready let me think\nwhat's funny what's funny about it\nit's me it's my buddy you know it helps\nit helps me out what come to you are you\ndrinking green I just got this like\nreally nice authentic Japanese green tea\nleaves unusual good let me just think\nwhat are we gonna teach you in terms of\nmeditation what do you what do you want\n- is there something in particular they\nwant to get better at or learn there's\nso much I want to get better at and\nlearn holy [ __ ] um toss a couple things\nout there well honesty is a big one\ncommunication I think I'm getting really\ngood at those though I think I'm getting\nreally good at being honest and\ncommunicating and I think something else\nI really want to get good at is uh\nprocessing my emotions you know like\nreally really thinking about what I feel\nwhy I feel it and expressing those\nemotions to other people I have a really\nhard time with that and I'm getting\nbetter but okay that's that's a big one\num I want to get better at not be\npersonalizing because that that's it's\nit just makes life feel so\ndull you know like you don't remember\nhalf of the like alright the last six\nmonths I mean it's not that I don't\nremember it but it's it just feels like\nlooking back at it feels like like it\nfeels different\nyou know that make sense sure so I think\nwe're gonna try to build on I'm gonna\ngive you a focus but I think let's build\non your teacup because your teacup is\nyour buddy it's your tea couple of help\nyou the only thing that I'm struggling a\nlittle bit with is sometimes I ask\npeople to meditate along basically to\nhave our viewers meditate along I think\nit's gonna be a little bit trickier\nbecause I'm gonna ask you a couple of\nspecific questions which they're not\ngonna it's not gonna apply to them so\nwhat I'd like you to do is sit up\nstraight and actually refill your teacup\nbut don't drink it yet\nand will also give people actually I'm\ngonna run to the restroom and I want\neveryone else to grab a sensory object\nthat they can look at and or something\nthat they can drink or eat preferably\ndrink so something that you can take a\nsip of that has flavor\nwell it doesn't need flavor and then\ngrab a sensory object that you can look\nat that as a lot of well yeah yeah we're\ngonna meditate together yeah so why\ndon't you guys grab that Oh we'll just\ntake a really quick break I'm gonna run\nto the restroom and then we'll get\nstarted\ncamera turn off the camera while you\nmeditate okay no while I go to the\nbathroom oh yeah yeah well you go to the\nbath I wasn't going to [ __ ] up your\noverlay or anything okay I'll be in\nthere I'm not sure if it's gonna [ __ ] up\nmy overlay either but let me do this oh\nno wait it dropped out of the call when\nI did that okay I'm gonna leave that\nhere for a second and then I'll be right\nback okay\ncome on man go pee\nall right twitch chattin are your back\noh well a lot of people watching okay\nalright let's see I'm eating almonds mmm\n- we will do ASMR meditation Joshi\nreturneth so guys grab your stuff so am\ni doing something wrong\nI think she returneth hello hello\n[Music]\nalright so okay so what I want you to do\nso we're gonna go ahead and begin so I\nwant everyone do is sit up straight so\nyou you I noticed you sit with your\nknees up I want you to just pause for a\nsecond close your eyes unless you feel\nvulnerable again and I want you to feel\nthe curvature of your back yeah is it a\nhand\nno no just with your sense of self and\nthen then what I want you to do I don't\nknow if you can do this or not but\nyou're sitting cross-legged or yes okay\nI want you to take so when you sit\ncross-legged and what I want you to do\nis take your is which of your legs is on\ntop is your left leg on top of your\nright leg on top okay so I want you to\ntake your right ankle and I want you to\nput it if you can above your left hip\nlike it's all the way up uh-huh yeah now\nwhat happened to your back when you did\nthat it straightened weird huh okay good\nso can you hold that for a little bit\ngood so now what I'm gonna ask you to do\nis so I'm gonna ask you a couple of\nquestions and essentially what this\ntechnique is gonna be is I want you to\npick the focus of your what you're gonna\nlook at okay and it's place your focus\nin front of you and then I'm going to\nask you to evoke an emotional memory\nokay yeah I'll tell you which one pick\nbut for people at home so just like\nthink about a\npoint in your life that was emotional\nand then as you what we're gonna do is\nyou may experience feelings and try to\nlike work through that memory and if the\nfeelings get to be too much or they feel\noverwhelming and you can't separate them\nout I want you to focus on on the object\nthat you're looking at and as you stare\nat that object start to process those\nfeelings and explore them further\nbecause as you so the reason that things\nfeel overwhelming is because you're\ngetting a flood of emotions all at once\nand when you direct your attention\ntowards an external object your\nattention is not looking at the\noverwhelming amount of feelings anymore\nand so what it does is narrows the\nspectrum of what's overwhelming you two\nthings that is then gonna be under\nhopefully understandable as long as you\nkeep your attention on the cop does that\nmake sense that makes any sense but okay\nso I want you to think about your your\npapà being in the hospital okay okay and\nthink a little bit about you know\nthey're there they're coming to tell you\nthat you know it's time to say goodbye\nand maybe you should come and say\ngoodbye and everyone's taking their\nturns and think a little bit about how\nyou felt when that was coming and\neveryone was kind of going in and out\nand then they came to you and they said\nwhat you can answer um they just told me\nto go hold his hand and think about how\nyou felt when they said that what did\nyou feel hmm it says in denial that's\nnot a feeling that's you reflecting back\nwhat what did you feel like doing when\nthey said come hold his hand\nas I felt scared right so so good you're\ndoing it so like you're looking at the\ncop and and so you've identified an\nemotion which sort of as like obvious in\nretrospect but like you you it's the I\nfelt like running away that's the\nexperience of the emotion it's not a\nhypothesis it's not like an analysis I\nwas in denial no you weren't in denial\nyou were afraid mm-hmm right and and\nwhat were you running away from what\nwould have happened if you had gone into\nthe room and held his hand I'd have had\nto say goodbye and I'd have to let my\nfamily see me in an emotional state and\nyou didn't want them to see you that way\nwhy not because I want to be viewed as\nstrong and I have trouble being\nvulnerable emotionally with people so\nwe're getting into analysis but good so\nI want to be feeling strong no that's\nokay so I'm gonna point these out to you\nright so do you see the difference\nbetween I want to be few too strong\nthat's from in here that's wrong and\nthen there's the analysis on top can you\ntell the difference between those two\nthings\nright one is like it's like a raw\nfeeling of like I want to run away I\nwant to be viewed a particular way and\nthen you can dig into that you know the\nwhy and the how and the what with your\ntherapist do you want to continue\nexploring pretty good okay so just tell\nme what else so what did you say to that\nwhen they said come to Edison skip\nsaying no I'm okay\nI don't want it and how are you feeling\neach time they said hey it's it's time\nsoon any I wanted them to ask me again\nbecause I wanted to say\nand what kept you from saying yes I\nscared of what\nsaying goodbye why did you want to say\nyes because I knew I had to say goodbye\nI didn't want to close your eyes sit\nwith those feelings\nwhat are you feeling you can describe a\nphysical sensation if that's easier said\nregretful did you say goodbye no want to\ngive it a shot right now\nno I think I think I did it over the\nyears in a way yes oh I don't think\nyou're ready yet so what I saw there was\nfear did you feel it came up again like\nyou open your eyes they flashed open\nyeah there it is yeah that was fear\nright hmm I asked you do you want to say\ngoodbye and what did you feel\nthere absolutely you're not right to\ntake advice but you absolutely have to\nwhen you're ready but I don't think that\nhe needs to you don't need you can still\nsay goodbye when you're ready that makes\nsense yeah yep yes all right so now you\nget to drink your tea and just taste it\nfor a moment so before you do this\nbefore you taste it actually I want you\nto just as you taste it recognize that\neverything that you just felt is just a\npiece of you and in a weird way I want\nyou to try to deeper\nand lies a little bit as you taste the\ntea just notice what's real and anchor\nyourself in the reality of the taste of\nthe tea\nrefreshing yeah and where is the fear\nwhere's the fear of saying goodbye not\nthere okay where'd it go I drank it it's\nweird huh so that that's okay\nso I feel like this was way easier than\nI was expecting it to be I don't know if\nhey I don't know because I mean I I\nthink you know we access some very real\nemotion especially when I asked you you\nknow are you do you want to say goodbye\nnow not like you saw at least I can see\nit but I think you did a really good job\nbecause I think you you you know by\nfocusing on the cop oddly you managed to\nuncover a couple of things which are\nsort of like obvious but like you know\nthe fact that the way that other that\nyour parents perceive you or your family\nperceives you like that's been important\nto you you know there's a lot of\nactually really important stuff there to\nexplore further and I think about\nmeditation is like sort of a compliment\nto therapy it's not necessarily a\nsubstitute and a couple of things to\nfurther explore ideally with your\ntherapist or on your own through\nmeditation or however you want to do it\none is this idea that you wanted them to\nkeeps asking right and there was a part\nof you that did want to say goodbye or\nnot that want is not the right word\nthere's a part of you that still knows\nthat you need to say goodbye but that\nyou absolutely don't want to and when I\nthink when I when it comes to you know\nall of the emotions that float around\nand guide your behavior and trigger your\ndepersonalization it's now I'm actually\ngoing to teach you something that will\nhelp you okay so as long as you're\ncarrying around this fear of saying\ngoodbye to your grandfather your\nthreshold to D personalized is going to\nbe higher a [ __ ] sorry lower so I want\nyou to think about depersonalization is\nlike a bar like a debuff bar that fills\nup and if it fills up all the way then\nyou D personalized yeah\nthis stuff around your grandfather is\nlike it like fills up your bar at 20% so\nall you need to get is 80% to tip over\ninto depersonalization it's like a 20%\nfills up your you know your poison meter\nor whatever and like after a certain\namount then you get poisoned yeah yeah\nso so this is why it's important for you\nto let go of this stuff because you know\nI I don't oh I don't think that's saying\ngoodbye is gonna be nearly as bad as you\nthink it is yeah and I think that in a\nbizarre way saying goodbye is going to\nbe a way for you to actually reconnect\nwith your Papa but I don't think it's I\ndon't think you can understand that\nuntil you do it yeah yeah I think you're\nright I think I anything goodbye is\nnecessary and I will yeah I guess it's\njust hard your loss is so hard to deal\nwith like in general not just people\ndying yep it's really hard to deal with\nyou look spent yeah yeah it's kind of\ntiring to talk about your emotions for a\nwhile yeah yeah cool any questions for\nyou before you wrap up for the day no I\njust want to say thank you so much like\nthis has been a really cool experience\nyou have a really cool way of delving\ninto people's brains and I feel really\ngood and I'm glad I came on so thank you\nvery much you're very welcome and thank\nyou for coming on because I think um you\nknow I I think the whole point of this\nis it's not me that's doing it right\nit's you or us and and you know talking\nabout things like I'm really happy that\nyou know we had a chance to talk about\nsomething like vaginismus because that's\none of these problems that like people\njust go their entire life but\nthat they're broken and and let me just\nsay this to you guys if you feel\nfundamentally broken in some way shape\nor form about your body your mind your\nbeing your worth as a human being you\nshould definitely go talk to probably\nactually start with a doctor because the\nnumber of things that make people feel\nlike they're not like other people and\nthat they feel like they're\nfundamentally broken so here's the\nreally cool thing decent chance that\nsome kind of doctors somewhere can\nactually help you with that [ __ ] and\nthen you don't have to be broken anymore\nbut the problem is that you never tell\nanyone about it because you feel so\nshamed because of how broken you weren't\non the inside and sometimes that stuff\nis like actually physical like you know\nyou can get treatments for all kinds of\nstuff I had a guy one one time who had\ngone his entire life with skin sound\nkind of it's gross but like basically\nanal leakage\nand he just yeah it sucks because he\nwould just you know and and like that\n[ __ ] got fixed in his life was different\nafterward and so he just thought he was\nan incompetent human being because like\npeople don't go around [ __ ]\nthemselves and he does so like he's a\npiece of [ __ ] sort of makes sense no pun\nintended and and you know like so get\nstuff checked out like even if you think\nit's like super super embarrassing and\nlike you're completely alone and no one\never has this problem and something is\nfundamentally wrong with you if you\nthink that something is fundamentally\nwrong with you get that [ __ ] checked out\nyeah life knowing what is wrong because\neveryone has their own struggles that\nthey're always going through everyone\ndoes knowing what is wrong is the first\nstep in improving yourself cool yeah\nyeah I can get behind that yeah awesome\nKatie thank you so much thank you\ngood luck Thanks and and I hope that the\ninternet does not hate you and also feel\nsympathetic for you because you didn't\nwant them to do that yeah\ntime they can do whatever you know\nthey've got a mind of their own\npurchased they're showing take care\nadios yeah bye bye dad I'm chattin and\nchattin is finished\nalrighty oh my god\nI see a $10,000 donation what the [ __ ]\nokay hey okay I will check okay so um\ncall me Carson fog absolutely man\nall right so first of all and so many\ndifferent things to say I just need to\nprocess for a second I'm feeling\noverwhelmed\nyou\nso the first thing is like I don't want\nyou guys to go through life like\nthinking you're [ __ ] up\nright and it's like really sad like I\ncan just because that's what happens\nright like I I remember feeling this way\nwhen I was in my early 20s and I guess I\nthought oh man it's totally aced by the\nway that she was like yeah two years ago\nI was young and it's like lady you're\nstill young they're like 20 but you know\nit's it's I just wish that I could read\npeople's minds and like see people on\nthe street who think that they're broken\non the inside and just tell them like no\nyou're not broken like that's just not\ntrue right and I want you guys to think\nabout you know seven-year-old Kate and\nyou know looking at like an\napples-to-apples card such a powerful\nstory and then just seeing pure and just\nlike thinking like that's not gonna be\nme like I'm not like that\nthe thoughts and feelings that we have\nthe things that we believe to be true\nabout ourselves the aspects of worth\nthat we treat as facts or born in such\ninsidious places and then they just grow\nlike our entire life right like in and I\nthink Kate is really in the minority\nhere because she's incredibly resilient\nusually people get way more [ __ ] than\nshe is like by if they have what\nhappened to her and I just don't know\nhow else to say that it's just like I've\nseen complete train wrecks this is what\nwe used to call [ __ ] life syndrome you\nknow anyway but and like so just stop\nand think about if you feel like you're\nan awful piece of [ __ ] or like a waste\nof space or that other people are better\nthan you and you don't deserve\nforgiveness or any of this kind of crap\nyou don't deserve to be happy because\nyou're a waste of space and you just sit\nthere and play video games all day and\nlike all this kind of crap about\nyourself just know that's just not true\nlike I understand that you feel that way\nand just like Kate did when\nshe was seven she felt like she was\nnever gonna be pure is not good and and\nlike I don't we can't blame her for\nfeeling that way because she had things\nhappen to her which made those feelings\nfeel true and you guys have had [ __ ]\nthat's happened to you which makes your\nfeelings feel true and I'm not saying\nthat your feelings are wrong what I'm\nsaying is that you shouldn't form a\nconclusion about who you are as a person\nbased on that feeling right of course\nshe feels tainted for the rest of her\nlife and of course she feels weak for\nnot saying goodbye to her grandfather\nand she's still not strong enough and\nshe's not strong enough right now and\nthat's [ __ ] okay why does she need to\nwhy do we expect ourselves to have all\nof the strength that we're going to gain\nover the course of our life now like\nwhere did we set up that expectation\nit's okay for her to not be strong\nenough and it's okay for you to knock\nthese socks off right like and and do\nwhat she do what she did like how did\nshe like start to love herself it was\nsort of like you know accepting that\nshe's like she was like yeah I'm kind of\na dumb [ __ ] and that's not like her\nbeating herself up it's actually like a\npositive sort of thing and it's kind of\nlike I I think that's the answer it's\nnot fake it till you make it because\nthat's not really how it happens that\nleads to imposter syndrome it's not\ngetting other people's validation it's\nactually like accepting that you are\nflawed in some way and we see this in\nlike Alcoholics Anonymous where they\nstart every meeting with with you know\nhi I'm so-and-so and I'm an alcoholic\nwell when was the last time you had a\ndrink 34 years ago it's like how are you\nstill an alcoholic and it's like no man\nI'm still an alcoholic and and so I want\nyou guys to really just stop and think\nabout you know do you feel broken and do\nyou feel like you're unredeemable and\nrecognize that those feelings are real\nand they come from a very real place but\nthey come from a place that is\nincomplete they come from an\nunderstanding they're born at the age of\nseven after you\nsexually abused it's born in a\nseven-year-olds mind cannot understand\nthe nuance that is life in that feeling\nin you is primitive because it doesn't\nhave qualities and it's not logical and\nit like doesn't make sense but it feels\nvery real it feels fuel it feels real\nand start to explore it and see where\nthat came from and and don't just\nbecause you feel that way and it feels\ntrue does not mean it has to determine\nyour destiny or the the next phase of\nyour life it doesn't have to and all you\nhave to do is you know take your teacup\nand look at it and go back to like\nexploring where where was that feeling\nfeeling born for you where did it come\nfrom\nyeah because it's just not fair for you\nto live your life like that and you just\ndon't need to and I just don't think\nit's fair and I don't want you to do\nthat to yourself because you deserve\nbetter\nyou deserve to treat yourself better and\nyou deserve you're just like this is the\nproblem right it's like so many things\nso many of the people that we work with\nlike they start to get better and then\nthey don't believe they deserve to be\nbetter so they actually stop trying and\nit's so [ __ ] mean right like you guys\nhave actually spent times of your life\nwhere you've started to become good\npeople but then you stop and the voice\ninside your head tells you I'm not a\ngood person and like I don't deserve\nthat so I'm gonna stop and it's so\n[ __ ] insidious I hate it so much oh\nmy god but it happens we did a interview\nmany many months ago when we were a tiny\ntiny stream with this guy named crucify\nand I think he illustrates that well but\nand like I mean come on dude like cut\nyourself some slack\ncuz if I mean if as long as you believe\nthat you don't deserve to do better\nyou're theirs I mean people are like how\ndo I put my life together you start by\nacknowledging that you deserve a life\nthat is worth living like that's where\nyou start do you believe that about\nyourself do you believe that you deserve\nto be happy\nor at least that you deserve a chance at\nhappiness and if the answer is no like\nthat's your [ __ ] problem where did\nyou learn that where did you learn that\nyou're you don't deserve a chance to be\nhappy anyway I don't know where to go\nfrom there I'm smack - OH\nI have to work today\nafter this okay think about this okay so\nlet me just collect my thoughts for a\nmoment here\nboomer is learning boomer learn a--the\nokay alright so\nokay so call me Carson you magnificent\nbastard dead thousand dollar donation so\nnow we're gonna say something okay so\nyou guys don't make you [ __ ] deserve\nhelp well call me Carson [ __ ]\ndisagrees and he says you guys\nabsolutely deserve help and he's giving\nten thousand dollars to us so that we\ncan give you what you [ __ ] deserve\nwhich is help you magnificent bastard\nthank you very much and for all of you\nguys who believe that you don't deserve\nhelp call me Carson night vision and\nsprin [ __ ] beg to disagree and\nthey're putting their money where their\nmouth is and so y'all if you think you\ndon't deserve help like I'm not gonna\naccept that excuse because a lot of\npeople disagree so yeah you for those of\nyou who don't believe that you you know\nfor those of you don't believe you\ndeserve help you can go [ __ ] yourselves\nI'm putting putting words in called me\nCarson's mouth and also night vision\nthan everyone else who's donated and we\ndon't wanna we also don't want to forget\nlike all the other people who are you\nknow to have donated six dollars and\nninety cents\nnice one kono gaijin but you know like\nevery little bit helps and we're really\ngrateful for it\nso so if most is this also say on the\naltar of sacrifice for twitch we're\ngonna make them a [ __ ] bio-data and\nwe're gonna send it we're gonna like\ntweet it out and we're gonna see what\nkind of person on the internet wants to\nhave a date with Moses then we're gonna\ndo a virtual date and then we're gonna\nwe're gonna pop us a [ __ ] popcorn\nand we're gonna eat it and enjoy it is\nis he giveth of himself it's good I\nthink I think we may actually hit 100k\nokay so thanks to our Lando Blakely for\nall the gifted subs bro and just just a\nreminder that so we actually hit our\nfull funding goal for the month so we're\nreally grateful for that so massive\namount of subs Orlando Blakeley thank\nyou very much and yeah so let me just\nshare a couple things so the may is\nmental health awareness month and you\nknow we've been streaming on Twitch for\nlike six or seven months now and we try\nto raise awareness for mental health\nissues like every time we stream but\nwe're really asking for some support to\nbuild some of the services that we think\nour community needs and at the top of\nthe list for the services that we think\nthe community needs one is that like\none-on-one work matters and I think that\nI just can't you know streaming is a\npowerful and important but I think that\neveryone sort of you know deserves the\nopportunity to have what people who come\non here on stream cloth which is that\nfor a compassionate and authentic human\nbeing to like listen to what they have\nto say and try to support them through\nthat through it\nand I can't do it for all of you I just\nlike it's like literally time and space\nconstrain what I can do so I I'd love to\ndo it for each and every one of you if\nour communities 20 people would be\nawesome we'd be done but it's bigger and\nI'm sort of glad that it's bigger\nbecause that's what that's what we need\nright now right like that's who we are\nwhere the I wasn't kidding when when I\nwas trying to virtually embrace Kate\nwhen she was like 11 and joined the\nInternet's and came home to her people\nbecause that's us and we're all a little\nbit broken and we all deserve a little\nbit help a little bit of help and that's\nwhat our coaching program is is\ntherefore so we'll see if this grand\nexperiment works I wouldn't have asked\nfor money until we knew it was working\nbasically\nso we collected a bunch of data I\ndesigned a study I designed a lot of you\nknow Harvard Andy instruments and I'm\nconfident that it actually can help\npeople which is why we're actually doing\nit so the you know all the testing and\nstuff was on our end but now that I've\nnow that we've actually helped we had\npeople enroll in our beta program and\nthey worked with coaches for eight\nmonths and those people felt like it was\nhelpful\nand so now that I have now that I'm\nconfident that this can help in some way\nshape or form like now it's about\nactually providing it for you guys so so\nit's fully funded now so thank you guys\nvery much it 100k we start a scholarship\nfund and we're gonna have Moses's edate\nso the other thing guys is anything else\nwe we raise after 75 K is actually going\nto subsidize free coaching and so we\nrecognize that a lot of people so we're\nmaking coaching super cheap you know\nit's gonna be like way cheaper than\ngoing to a therapist because it's not\ntherapy but and and we're still\ncommitted to offering you know services\nto people irrespective of their ability\nto pay\nand we're kind of working on on that and\nso yeah and so we're committed to that\nand you know we really try to make our\ncontent as easily accessible and\navailable as possible and then one last\nthing to think a little bit about is\nthat on Friday so I don't know exactly\nwhat we're doing on why is everyone\nsaying\nkeemstar is that a person course that\nlike a word\nI can't tell see I don't know if you\nguys are talking about people or like is\nthat like POG how do you guys see how\nthat's confusing because when you're\nlike pogchamp like i don't know if\npogchamp is a person or just something\nthat people say because\npogchamp countess sounds like sounds\nlike keemstar like as a keemstar a thing"
