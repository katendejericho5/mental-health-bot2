    "transcript": "technical problems aside let us begin I\ndon't know what we're so uh first of all\nwhat do i what what do I call you what\ndo you go by\nuh I guess a lot of people call me pokey\nokay you want it to be very personal and\ncall me by my name\nit's Iman Iman okay what what do you\nprefer\num I guess I've always kind of felt like\npoki is fine for whatever situation but\nif someone's going to try to be very\npersonal with me like me the person then\nI guess\nIman makes more sense okay so then what\nwould you prefer I do do you want me to\nbe personal do you want to be personal I\nthink I enjoy I like talking with people\ninstead of characters in general so I\nthink I'm leaning towards Iman but at\nthe same time I don't know if you want\nto be Iman today or you want to be poki\ntoday I think I should be Iman I feel\nlike it only makes sense both of us are\nreally quiet I'm sorry can you say that\nagain I think it makes sense to be Iman\nokay so then let's let's talk to you Mon\nso can you tell me a little bit is there\nsomething in particular that you wanted\nto talk about today or something that we\ncan help you with and I say we because\ntwitch chat is actually pretty good at\nthis by now oh that's really cute I\nthink you have a lovely community and\nyou do a really good job of moderating\nthem I think from what I've seen at\nleast I don't think there's really\nanything in particular because I feel\nlike all my issues are very convoluted\nokay yeah together that's what we're\nhere for so so I think that that's\nactually what I think what we do what I\ntry to do is just untangle things for\npeople because I think most people are\npretty good at problem-solving they're\nintelligent they're capable and and it's\njust it's really ignorant\nand not understanding that tends to be\nthe problem for most people so when you\nsay your issues like that's like a heavy\nword like what what do you mean by\nissues first starters do you know how I\ncan prevent myself from crying during\nthis absolutely whoo uh maybe actually\nhold on okay do you let me start with\nthis what's wrong with crying I've just\nbeen crying a lot okay so but what's\nwrong with that where did you get the\nidea that you're not allowed to cry hear\nthat crying is bad I guess just in\nmoments where it feels like it doesn't\nmake sense okay like now okay so let's\njust pause for a second what are you\nfeeling there is actually a really funny\num picture meme on the subreddit I think\nI can make me motivated\nif anyone either was watching my\nstreamer has seen it or it's like\ntherapist asks you to open up and then\nit's like this um glass panel and inside\nthere's a bunch of dishes that are like\nso close to falling out and you're like\nI can't and they're like why and then\nit's just a picture of that hmm\nbut it sounds like that's not what\nyou're experiencing it sounds like it's\nthe opposite right that the dishes your\npanel is so high and the dishes are\nstarting to spill over the top yeah I\nguess what are you feeling right now do\nyou do you know I guess the nervousness\nand I don't know why especially for the\nlast like two weeks I feel like just\nlike very sensitive and like on the\nverge of crying very often and I don't\nknow okay yeah and in the crying is a\nbad crying let's start there so so I\nmean I'm not the kind of person that is\nof the opinion that like crime is a bad\nthing I often feel like it's really good\nand like cathartic or like therapeutic\nand it kind of like allows you to let\nyour emotions out but it almost feels\nlike I can never get to that point where\nthey're all out\neither that or like they're just like\ncontinuously we're generating yeah oh\nyeah oh man that sounds rough so what\nI'm what I'm hearing from you is that\nyou're not you're not opposed to feeling\nfeelings it's just it seems like there's\na never-ending well of like negative\nfeelings and even if you let yourself\ncry like you can cry for a while but\nthen like at some point the crying's\nsupposed to like make you feel better\nand you're supposed to stop right like\nit's not just like I've experienced yeah\nit's like what the [ __ ] it's not like\nthat I was told at some point that this\nwould get better yeah and everyone says\nthat once you let it out then it's out\nbut you're like but then it's back like\ntwo hours later yeah so so what I'm\nhearing from you is that you don't have\na bucket that's full of water you have a\nfaucet yeah that sounds rough I guess\nmaybe I I don't really know why cuz I\nhaven't really experienced this before\nand that's why I like I guess that's\nlike it's like my first question right\noff the bat and I I saw it like oh this\nwill be fine maybe I will tear up at\nsome point so I don't know why like I\nliterally just say hello and I feel like\ncrying yeah\nI think for a second okay so my first\nthought actually can you think for like\nanother second sure\nI'm gonna guess some tissues I was not\nprepared\nyou\nI'm sorry how do you pronounce your name\nagain Iman Iman do you feel lonely let\nme rephrase actually do you feel alone I\ndon't know I guess it's not really\nsomething that I think about because I\nam like physically not alone because I\nhave like my roommates and stuff and I\ndo have like good friends that I can\nvent to when need be so in that aspect I\nfeel like it's not like I don't really\nfeel alone in that way maybe in more\ncomplicated ways that I do for example\nlike in terms of the things that I have\nissues with I maybe sometimes feel like\nI deal with those alone or that there\naren't like people in similar situations\nyeah it can be really confusing when you\nfeel a certain way that you're not\nsupposed to feel yeah or I think\nespecially one of the reasons I was\nnervous to talk to you today with\nbecause I feel like a lot of things I'm\num I like shouldn't be justified in\nfeeling because I am also like very\nprivileged and lucky to be in the\nposition that I'm in and that's also I\nlike initially many weeks or months ago\nwhen we were talking about potentially\ndoing this sort of thing I just feel\nlike people don't want to hear someone\nlike me complain like understandably so\nI think that's part of it\nI'm gonna think about how so yeah so I'm\ngonna just say what I said again which\nis it can be confusing to feel things\nthat you're not supposed to feel right\nso so what I'm getting from you is so\nthe first thing I'm gonna say is that\nI'm here and I'm with you\nand at least for a little while\nyou're not gonna be alone and I'm okay\nwith who you are and I don't really care\nthat you have privilege like I don't I\nmean part of the advantage of being a\nboomer I mean I know who you are I know\nyou are but I also don't I you know I\ncome from worlds I feel like I'm an\nalien on Twitch because they're all of\nthese you know they're yeah they're\nthey're all these things that I've done\nderstand about you guys and twitch and\nlike you know I identify with pieces of\nit but but there's a lot of stuff that I\ndon't understand so the first thing that\nI want to talk to you about is because I\nthink this is this is the problem right\nis that that you you shouldn't be alone\nbut you are I I like what I'm getting\nfrom you is like a sense of like shoulds\nlike it's a case of the shuds like you\nshouldn't feel this way because you're\nprivileged but the interesting thing is\nthat like when Wood Wood Buddha but the\nwhatever said that all human beings are\nentitled to two things and those things\nare suffering and death and that's like\nreally really interesting because you\nknow we have this idea that we say money\ndoesn't buy happiness but it you know\nsure as hell helps but at the same time\nlike I mean I've worked with a lot of\npeople who are very successful and very\nprivileged and the one thing that I've\nseen is that like I don't think that\nbeing privileged or successful is makes\nyou invulnerable to suffering and\nsomewhere along the way we started\njudging people who have things that we\ndon't have and we started gatekeeping\nsuffering for them and I think that's\nactually really really toxic\nright it says that like just because you\nhave something that I don't have you're\nnot allowed to suffer and this is a\ntango that we all started playing\nespecially the people who are the halves\nand the people who are have-nots it's\none that we both do\nbut in my experience like I hate to\nbreak it to you Iman Iman right I hate\nto break it to you Mon but you know no\namount of privilege power Fame or money\nis going to be an antidote to your\nsuffering and in fact that's exactly\nwhat would they learned so he was\nwealthy powerful either jokes earlier\nabout people in chat said Queen when\nthey referred to you and I think it's\nactually really bizarre because that's\nthat's literally what what the was like\nwhoo there was a king and he woke up one\nday yeah it was like tired of his\nprivilege I wanted to see what it was\nlike to live otherwise and I think he\nbecame really poor yeah so I don't know\nthat he wanted to see what it was like I\nthink he actually woke up one day and\nfelt exactly the way that you do which\nis that he cried and then the next day\nhe cried in the next day he cried and\nthe next day he cried and he didn't know\nwhy it wouldn't stop and then he's like\nthings are supposed to make this better\nand then he looked around at him and he\nsaid okay like maybe having more\nfollowers on Twitter will make me feel\nbetter maybe being able to eat tastier\nfood will make me feel better maybe\nhaving a more loving marriage but he had\nall those things so he was kind of\n[ __ ] in a way that very few people are\nis he had everything I don't know if you\nhave everything or not it sounds like\nyou have a lot but there may be some\nsome things in your mind that you tell\nto tell yourself like I don't know in\nterms of you know if you have kids or\nrelationships or things like that and\nwhat you think about that but a lot of\ntimes you know people who are privileged\nor successful in some way like they look\nat that like that dimension of their\nlife where they're lacking and they say\nthis is what's gonna bring me happiness\nbut booth does uniquely yeah not gonna\nwork\nhate to break it to you yeah I'm very\nmuch a problem solver brain and I also\nagree it's probably not gonna work yeah\nI actually think it gets really bad\nbecause I become very like kind of\ncompulsive about those issues yeah it\ndoesn't really make a difference at the\nend of the day cuz I'll just become\ncompulsive about something else\nonce one thing you stall with brilliant\nso let's I can keep talking about Buddha\nbut I can't let that slide so where does\nthat compulsivity come from\nwhy are you compulsive helped us\nunderstand that I think I just have a\nproblem-solver brain and it's served me\nfor so many years I can't really turn it\noff what does that mean problem-solver\nbrain help us understand that um I may\nthink that it spawns from the wrong\nthing but I always thought that I came\nfrom like like having a strong love for\nmathematics and going into engineering\nand I mean my life was school and so it\nwas always about like problem solving\nmin maxing trying to be as productive as\npossible trying to do my best in all\naspects et cetera et cetera\nand I feel like when it comes to content\ncreation what makes a content creator\nreally successful is a lot of being able\nto problem-solve\nand being able to min/max and learning\nwhat works and doesn't and changing and\nevolving etc and so because it has\nserved me for so many years it's\nsomething it's it's a part of me that is\nkind of hard to turn off but I have\nnoticed especially as of late that it's\nmore so like not trying to like fix good\nproblems per se or or helpful problems\nit's just like being obsessive about the\nnext thing that I can fix it make better\nyou you thought that slot hmm you've\nthought about this a lot\nvery insightful so let's let's let's so\nlet's try to take the next step okay so\nwhen you don't problem-solve\nhow do you feel what does that mean not\nproblem so exactly alright so you've got\nto learn exactly what would they learned\nokay and so the good news is that you\ncan get better I think it's just gonna\nhappen you're gonna have to do something\nthat you've never done before which is\nto not try right literally I don't know\nhow to do that yeah so we'll try to help\nyou we'll try to help you not try so\nlet's let's talk about this for a second\nso you said so let me okay I'm gonna ask\nyou about the tangled stuff okay so so\nlike when you say things are tangled can\nyou help me understand like what like\nwhen you wake up and you're crying on a\nparticular day like what kind of\nthoughts are you having or what kind of\nfeelings are you having it's just you\nknow when something is so tangled it's\nlike where do you start\nsure yeah just give me something\nanything yeah I think a lot of it has to\ndo with like like if my personal life is\ngoing well like with my friends or like\nmy relationships people in my life then\nit's like okay well then I need to\nproblem-solve in terms of like work and\nthen I'll just like think about its\nso hard not to cry you haven't fixed\nthis freak so let's stop and think about\nthat for a second the first thing that\nyou come on here and say is you say\nproblem solve for me fix something for\nme help me not cry when you when you\nnotice when you set a problem for\nyourself and in Iman says I don't want\nto cry and then you start crying how do\nyou feel about yourself like what's that\nlike we saw frustration right like ah\nyou were supposed to [ __ ] help me\nwith this why is it so happening\nI mostly frustrated with myself\nabsolutely why are you tell me about\nthat how do you how do you feel about\nyourself I feel like I'm doing something\nthat I shouldn't and that's not\nsomething that um works with the kind of\nperson that I am like I really don't\nlike to do things that I actively feel\nare things I shouldn't do ever okay but\ndoesn't mean that I don't make mistakes\nobviously but like when I know something\nis like very clearly like right or wrong\nand I feel like in this situation like\nit just does not compute to be cry and\nso to see myself react that way it's\nvery frustrating okay so what I'm\nnoticing is like I'm just gonna tell you\nwhat I heard okay so look at it with me\ncan okay so you have a should Iman\nshouldn't be crying right now I don't\nknow if it can you hear crying in the\nbackground you guys hear that huh never\nright okay my kid is crying she's having\na little meltdown so there is a should\nand you are not that should and that\nfrustrates you so I think if you want to\nget to the bottom of this we have to\nstart with like do you remember a time\nwhen you were younger where you felt\nlike you should be something and you\nweren't that thing I think only to give\nsome context basically like my parents\nimmigrated from Morocco to Canada when I\nwas like about four and I think my whole\nlife I've kind of just like grown up\nwith this feeling that I am like a very\nindebted to them for that because they\ndid they did it to give me and my\nbrother about her life and so a lot of\nmy life has just been like trying to\nmake my parents proud and that's\nsomething that means a lot to me and\nthat also goes hand in hand with the\nlike you know doing the right thing sort\nof thing and that's I like things that I\ngenerally feel like my parents would\ndisapprove of like I just can't bring\nmyself to do I don't drink I don't do\ndrugs like I I just like generally try\nto stay away from stuff that could ever\nresult in them being disappointed in me\nbut I think also that has probably\nprevented me from ever like like going\nout and experiencing much in life I also\nfeel like now I am very indebted to like\nmy community and to my viewers for\ngiving you the life that I have and so\nfrequently it just feels like I have all\nthese\nlike telling me what they expect from me\nand also the problem is the problem\nsolver Amy has created like a system\naround me that depends on me like as you\ncontinue your years in being a content\ncreator you start like delegating things\nyou get a PA you have an agent you have\nmanager you Beauvoir and so I feel like\nthere's all these people that rely on me\nto do what I need to do in order for\nthem to do what they need to do and I\nguess recently I've just been thinking a\nlot about all the all those things and\nmaybe it's starting to feel a bit\noverwhelming okay so I feel like this\nshould and should not come from a lot of\ndifferent angles and even now doing this\nin front of you although like you know I\nam trying not to look at chat and have\nthis just be an experience between us\ntoo it's very nerve-wracking because it\nfeels like anything I do there will be\nlike some way to twist it negatively and\nthat is another reason why crying is so\nfrustrating cuz it's like I mean being\nvulnerable in and of itself isn't easy\nbut also everyone that's just gonna\nthink that I am a fake crying Amon\nAmarth\nare you mean how far are you from\nperfect fairy do you want to be perfect\num I don't think that's possible\nwhy do you strive for it because does\nlife makes sense any other way than to\ntry to be I guess your best self\nmy friend yeah because here's the crazy\nthing okay I'm gonna say something you\nmay not make any [ __ ] sense you are\nperfect what do you think about that I\nfeel like that's the kind of thing like\nyou say to someone and you like\neveryone's unique the way they are like\nyou're perfect the way you are I guess\nthat's what I hear\nyeah absolutely right because I don't\nthink you understand that but I want you\nto just think about this and I do say\n[ __ ] like that but it's not it's not\nbecause I'm trying to be positive it's\nnot positive I'm not I'm not trying to\nprop you up I'm trying to talk about\nwhat you are now not what you could be\nlike the only thing that exists in this\nworld is what is right so like take a\nlook at your tissue look at your tissue\nis it a good tissue is it a good tissue\nor a bad tissue or is it it's a good\ntissue but why it's it's like got some\ngunk on it right it's like wet it can't\nabsorb what it should be able to absorb\nright it did its job no but but it's not\nperfect because if you if you crime or\nof someone else cries more like they\ncan't use that tissue so the question is\ndid you do your job like you're not\nperfect right I'll accept that but did\nyou do your job did you do what you can\ndo did you do the best that you could I\nfeel like I don't know what that is yes\nno for me to say like what is enough\nabsolutely and and this is the thing\nyou've got to understand what is enough\nis exactly what you are right so like\nwhen you look at the tissue you say it's\nenough it did it did what it was\nsupposed to I'm content with it is it\ncompletely dry no can it hold its\nmaximum amount of tears no but it's held\nwhat's what it's needed to for now and I\ndon't blame it for not being drier when\nit's gonna sound [ __ ] weird okay so\nif I lose you let me know and if you\nwant to prime or let me know\nI'm trying to be a little bit\nphilosophical and help you understand\nthis intellectually because I think your\nyour mathematical mind is something we\nhave to leverage that's one of your\nstrengths and in the idea like if you\nthink about an equation like an equation\ncan only kind of be what it is right\nactually that's not true that's a bad\nexample you could derive the equation\nand you could turn you to another\nequation yeah or or I mean we can't say\none plus one is three because that's\nwrong that actually reinforces the idea\nof should and objective truth so what I\nactually want you to be able to do is\nlook at your life and say one plus one\nis three that what you are even though\nit's not enough what the [ __ ] is my spot\nif I randomly decided to turn on so did\nanyway I I'm gonna bring you there\nhopefully but I just put you to think\nabout this idea that like like you know\nthe only thing that can exist is like\nwhat you are like you can't be anything\nelse like I can't make you so like some\npeople like feel like they should be an\ninch taller right and they're like oh\nI'm short and it's like yeah man I get\nthat like I get that you have good\nreasons for wanting to be taller even\nthat you should be taller or that being\nshort sucks but like you literally can't\nbe any height but what you are right and\nit's not just height that is determined\nby like our karma in our biology\nit's like circumstance and you kind of\nfeel like you should do certain things\nand like I just think that that's wrong\nI don't think you should do anything I\nthink that you are I know [ __ ] that I\nsay but I mean really it's not that\nyou're perfect it's that you are like if\nI say you know the pen is here and we\ncan say that this pen is perfect because\nit's it's exactly where it is it can't\nbe anywhere else I get like it literally\ncannot be anywhere else that that\nexistence is is it's not could be like\nthe pen can't be anywhere else like it's\nhere and like now it's\nhere like it can't be back over here it\nis here right the possibility of the pen\nbeing here is like is not a real thing\nbecause I move it over here but like\nwhere's the pen it should be here or\nshouldn't be it's stupid it's here it's\nhere and in your mind\nsomewhere along the way and I get I get\nthat I think it's brilliant that you you\nknow discovered that it's adaptive for\nyou that it helps you it supports you to\nstrive for perfection is responsible for\nyour success and okay really anyway um\nso I think what we've got to get to is\nlike the the bottom of like where you\nget this idea that you should be\nsomething and my hypothesis and we'll\nlook for this okay so like oftentimes my\nhypotheses are wrong so I'll say my\nfirst hypothesis is that somewhere along\nthe way you felt like you were something\nand someone and you really knew what you\nwere and that someone important to you\ntold you that you shouldn't be that and\nthen what happened is like you\ncalibrated away from yourself and\ntowards that thing and then over time\nyou calibrated towards should should\nshould should should and that's what you\nthat's what you kind of like set your\nyou know your zero towards that became\nyour true north and then somewhere along\nthe way like you got left behind is you\nbecame pokey Eamon got left behind I can\nsee what you meet and where you're\ncoming from I think it's kind of hard\nfor me to think of a moment or like I\nfor sure like knew what I wanted to be\nI've been thinking about it recently and\nI do know that for quite some time I\nkind of try to separate the two but\nmainly in order to like um protect\nmyself kind of like\npeople would theorize or say like or try\nto try to twist a lot of stuff like a\npublicly I'd be like oh like all they\nsee is like pokey like they don't know\nme personally and I'm like that's kind\nof how I separated the two to kind of\nlike make myself feel better but um the\nkind of theory that I came to recently\nis more so that not that like I know or\nknew what I wanted to be but that I just\nhaven't given myself time to like\nidentity develop because I've spent man\nthat's that that makes perfect sense to\nme like that's that's like literally\nwhat I'm saying is that like so a long\ntime ago and I think you've been doing\nthis way longer than you realize or I\nmean I think you do realize it but like\nway longer than before I mean how long\nhave you in streaming on Twitch six or\nseven years and it is it okay to ask\npeople how old they are on Twitter is\nthat not okay yeah okay I also think\nabout that I'm 23 and it's like some of\nthe most formative years of my life I've\nspent like working to the point of\ngiving myself health issues and just\nstressing about like pleasing others and\nwhat others think and not accusing\nmyself anytime to just like live life\nand figure out who the [ __ ] I want to be\nor I'm happy with mmm\nyeah man I think\nthat [ __ ] figured out all on your own\nbut I've only gotten not far and I've\nonly gotten that far from freaking\ncrying for a week straight\ngood for you so let's think about this\nright so what I'm hearing is also a\nsubtle should that I should have spent\nmore time on identity to develop yeah\nthat that - it's not like oh I can just\nlike look at myself and Vic oh this is\njust like how I've ended up it's that is\nlike I feel like talking to pokey and\nIman and I think the point here is that\npokey doesn't let Iman grow and you're\nbeating yourself up for being pokey too\nmuch but that in and of itself is pokey\ntalking right I mean the thing is like I\ndon't see it as like I don't know I\ndon't like see it as an alter ego or\nreally if you like the problem\nno go for it I'm just gonna say I feel\nlike that problem solver part of me\nisn't necessarily like only part of like\nmy work side or yeah no no no no it's\nit's it's not it's not part of your work\nonly like as this what I'm saying like\nyour your tendency to gravitate towards\nshould started way before he started\nstreaming on Twitch and I think you're\nspot on that you know I didn't realize\nhow young you were but I mean if you\nstarted streaming on Twitch at the age\nof sixteen you're damn right that like a\nlot of identity development is gonna be\nkind of you know like stunted to be\nblunt right so like like 16 to 23 is\nwhen when you know people go to college\nand like I don't know who the [ __ ] I was\nuntil I was like 28 least two years yeah\nand and so like you know so I think it's\nokay to not know who you are at the age\nof 23 like people think that 23\nis adults but like not really I mean\npeople are like developmentally younger\nbecause I think the challenges that we\nface are likely far more complex what\nwe're is what are we're psychology and\nbrains are assaulted by on a daily basis\ngrowing up has changed like it's not\nlike we're living in the woods and like\nit's the same [ __ ] [ __ ] every day you\nknow it's like it's issues of identity\nand confusion and and what the world is\nlike my grandmother did not know that\nother places existed it gets a bizarre\nthing to think about but like she like\nliterally did not know that other\nlocations were real things like she grew\nup in her village and she had heard of\nplaces but they were like Neverland or\nstories like Bombay was like a place\nthat people went like it was a story\nlike she had conceptualized that it was\nactually a geographical location where\nthere are stairs and doorways and cars\nand people and that the world was like a\nplace it was like a myth but now the\nworld has become a real place and\nthey're in it like even compared to you\nknow 20 years ago the opinions that you\nhad to deal with were like localized to\nthe people that you met but enter the\ninternet where now you can get judged by\nhundreds of thousands of people are\nmillions of people and you used to deal\nwith the judgment of the kids in school\nit's like the same thirty [ __ ] kids\nand now you have millions of people who\ncan judge you know much about preteens\nand teens in this day and age the other\nfather mental health yeah they're\nthey're really it's it's bad and it's\ngonna get worse and anyway but so this\nis this is the thing you want III think\nI think even the way that you beat\nyourself up for not having developed\nyour identity is another shot so we got\nto get to the bottom of the should and\nyou're absolutely right that should is\nadaptive okay so oddly enough I feel\nlike I'm well equipped to help you\nbecause the people that I work with in\nmy day job I think have very similar\nproblems to you which is that they've\nflagellated themselves into success and\nthey're like they wake up one day and\nthey're they're you know you're\napparently Twitter oil tea and\nand you know in their case they're like\nmanaging director at like Goldman Sachs\nor they're like a physician at Harvard\nMedical School and and they wake up huh\nand they say the same thing they're like\nbut I am all of these things like why do\nI deserve like why am i crime guy\nshouldn't be [ __ ] crime and then I\ntell them like well maybe you should\nlike stop flagellating yourself and stop\ntrying to be better and they're like I\ndon't know how to do that I don't know\nwhat that looks like\nthat's that's me smiley yeah right like\nI don't know what acceptance and this is\nanother one of those you know yoga\ncalendar flower kind of things like\naccept yourself man no but like you\nliterally like that's not like a thing\non a yoga calendar that's something that\nyou literally it's like the pen right\nlike you can't be anything but what are\nits like silly like you literally you\ncan't be an inch taller you can't be\nmore developed in terms of an identity\nperspective you can't be any of those\nthings because you are what you are you\nthe past is what it is you know we're\ntalking about engineering and\nmathematics like if you build a\nstructure in a particular way that\nstructure can either bare away or it\ncan't bear weight like you can't what\nshould bear is actually completely\nirrelevant because either it's capable\nor it's incapable it's a fact but you\ndon't view yourself as a fact you view\nyourself as a fiction you view yourself\nas a should you're not a building you're\nan architectural diagram you're like a\nbuilding who looks at an architectural\ndiagram like a different building and\nsays I shouldn't be that but that's like\nit's like little like a building can't\nbe visas anything about what it is but I\nalso feel like I'm a building but I am\nthe architect of the building that is me\nso I can change myself to ideally be\nwhat I would like to be but I know that\nisn't really feasible in a lot of\naspects but in some of them no because\nit's it's a reasonable ocean so it's a\nreasonable thing to think because you've\ndone that right you've been a building\nwho says I want to be one-story taller\nand then you figured out how to like get\npeople to build you another story and\nthen you said I want to be one-story\ntaller\nand you figured out how to do that you\nfigured out how to do that so the funny\nthing is that you've actually given\nyourself evidence to believe that you\ncan be something that you are not and I\nstill think this goes all the way back\nto like I mean so\nI'm thinking about how to say this tell\nme about your indebtedness to your\nparents could I also mention one other\nthing sure um when I think about I guess\nall of the stuff we've talked about\nnamely I guess um my lack of like giving\nmyself a break over all these years\nmaybe one of the reasons I cry so much\nis like I feel like I'm mourning over\nthat I was like it's it's so weird I\ndon't really know how to explain it but\nlike I feel really sad for myself yes\nabsolutely because in what I'm telling\nyou I stopped at 17 18 19 20 21 22 it's\nthat's a brilliant of this I'm telling\nyou like so I'm I'm gonna go back to\nthis this idea right so like there was a\nMon when you were very young and and\nthere was something that you knew you\nwere and I'm not talking about like you\nknew you were you know wanted to be an\nengineer like and then like there was\nlike something that someone told you\nlike hey you should be something\ndifferent and then you you went towards\nthat thing and then like a little voice\ninside you said like hey that's not who\nI am and then this other boy said no no\nbut that's not me you should like you\nshouldn't be what you are you should be\nwhat these people tell you to be and\nthen you went further and further and\nfurther and further and further away\nfrom that voice and I think what you\nfeel right now is pity you feel pity\ntowards yourself you're mourning because\nlike there was like a little girl in\nthere who like had feelings that were\ncompletely fair and legitimate and pokey\ntold her to shut the [ __ ] up and sit in\nthe closet because we have [ __ ] to do\nand so morning morning is exactly what\nyou have to do and let's just think\nabout what mourning means right\nbecause mourning is not about should\nlike let's just think about what is\nmourning if we think about acceptance\nand and should\nwhat does mourning mean when do we more\nI know it's so kind of weird has like\ndied or passed yeah but just think about\nthat like when I'm so my dad passed away\na few years ago and and I remember like\nmourning him yeah it's all good please\nI'm cool with that he's cool with it\nyeah so sorry I mean I appreciate the\nsentiment but you know so if we think\nabout that like if I'm mourning do I\nthink to myself he should still be alive\ntoday I guess okay so when I've\ncompleted morning do I think that to\nmyself\nyou've accepted exactly because should\nis the opposite of morning like should\nas saying that this person should not be\ndead but they [ __ ] are right and so\nyou can tell yourself that they should\nbe alive and it's like you can say it's\na it is a tragedy and you can say like\nthey should be alive but like should\ncannot exist with morning and morning is\nthe process of taking should to\nacceptance so you should absolutely be\ndoing that I think it's awesome that\nthat's the way that you feel because\nthat means you're doing it right so give\nyourself a pat on the back you're doing\nexactly what you shouldn't be doing good\njob I'm on a plus I don't want\nvalidation from that though I don't want\nvalidation from just feeling like I'm\ndoing what I should be doing I think\nevery everyone's aware of that right so\nthe way so it's good that like yeah\nbecause I mean yeah because I'm giving\nyou the A+ and I'm laughing at it and\nthen you're noticing the absurdity of it\nand then you're saying I don't want\nvalidation from it and I'm giving you a\ncaricature a hyperbole a validation\nbecause I'm giving you a [ __ ] A+\nwhich is what you wanted all your life\nand therein we see that the beast within\nyou is fed so Imani I said this a lot of\ntimes about my frustrations with taunts\ncreation which is that there is no\nrubric and like you know my whole life\nI've just loved school and it's just all\nabout rubrics and finally feeling like\nokay when I score at 90 or above like\nthat means I did good I did my job and I\ncan go play video games and rest at\nnight but you know when I'm stuck in a\nposition where there is like numbers\ndon't stop there is no you've done\nenough and I don't know how to set that\nfor myself at all even though and I am\nDubLi who's that's how you pronounce the\nword or EE frustrated with myself\nbecause I know it's do we okay perfect\nI'm DubLi frustrated with myself because\nit's something that I've known for a\nlong time but it's just a problem not\nlike I don't know how to solve yeah so\nso it's actually doubly and the way that\nyou solve it is by using the word DubLi\ncuz that's you can't you're not allowed\nto say w so like literally really like\nthe way good you should [ __ ] say it\nthat way because it's wrong I'm English\nwhat was the second language I learned\nand there are so many words that I just\nlike can't properly pronounce like that\nso my bad but no no you're missing the\npoint\nno English is a second let me let me\nrepeat back to you what you said and you\ntell me which statement is wrong right\nyou correct your homework so you get an\na-plus English is the second language I\nlearned it's hard for me to pronounce\nall words correctly my bad\nwhich widget where's the problem say\nmany Mon my bad or the whole the whole\nthing really just a my bad right you're\ndoing it wrong go [ __ ] yourselves I'm\ndoing it do bleep like that's that's how\nyou learn it right by telling that part\nof you that's like hey you should be\nsomething else you're like now\nI'm gonna do this today and that's what\nacceptance is it's there we could go\nback and talk about your past but like\nyou know that's what you've got to do\nyou've got to like like think like think\nabout this like think about the thing\nthat you should be doing right whether\nit's like you pick something and then\nyou don't do it and then you you look at\nthat beast because here's the thing look\nwhat happens when you feed a beast\nbeautiful what have you been doing -\nshould your entire life feeding if that\ngrows and it grows and it grows and now\nyou've hit your breaking point because\nthis thing has grown so big it's this\nit's like a wolf that's the size of an\nelephant and you just can't feed it\nenough anymore and it's hungry and it's\nsaying Eamon it's not enough I'm still\nhungry you should eat better and you're\nlike how how much better do you want me\nto be and it's like I don't and it's\nlike I don't know but give me more food\nfind some way to make yourself better\nthat's the compulsion and you're like\nokay I fixed I fixed my relationships\nand it's like I want more and you're\nlike okay I'm gonna become a successful\ntwitch streamer it's like I want more\nokay and then you put yourself up on the\naltar of sacrifice and you say I should\nbe better because you fixed everything\nelse in the outside world and then you\ngive it yourself and you say oh I should\nbe better and then it's like ah good now\nI'm satisfied because you're never gonna\nfeel better right you can always feed it\nyourself you know always find something\nabout yourself that isn't good enough\nand it's just growing and growing and\ngrowing in the way that you stop is you\nstop feeding the beast and then it's\ngonna hurt because it's like it's gonna\nfeel hungry and hunger doesn't feel good\nand then you sit with that and so I\ndon't know what it is but like there's\ngot to be a thousand things that you\nshould be doing like what are they\nI should probably like call my parents\nmore I should make more content I\nshouldn't like diversify I should make\nsure I'm responding to these emails and\nthese projects and these sponsor\nliaisons and blah blah Blee blah and on\ntop of that there are so many people\nthat like rely on me doing these things\nnot only that but they require a lot of\ndirection from me but also I hired them\nto do the stuff so it only really makes\nsense and it's just like an endless list\nyeah so what is one thing that you\ncannot do today okay I mean I don't know\nI I will respond to work stuff good for\nyou\nhow does that feel I mean to be honest I\nhave been having these like episodes of\njust like indulging and not doing [ __ ]\nfor a solid like 12 hours like I guess\n24 hours if you include sleeve and\nthat's what well like feel really nice\nin the moment sort of a bit guilty I\nstruggle with a lot of that guilt yeah\nlike well just like flip-flop back and\nforth between like how long can I go\nwithout feeling guilty feels so good\njust play video games for no reason with\nno one watching and then at some point\nit's like I'm really guilty I need to\nlike do all this stuff that's what needs\nto change right so like what you need to\ndo is don't flip-flop don't flip-flop\nbalance the problem here is that you've\ngot a seesaw and you're like Iman needs\nsome time to herself and then pokies\nlike no you don't get [ __ ] time any\nminds like but I feel good and pokies\nlike no no no you guys like you need to\nbe you need to be in the middle right\nyou need to say like okay I'm gonna do\nthis for awhile and the dog that's\nhungry you're gonna tell the dog like\nhey man I know it's gonna hurt you're\ngonna get fed tomorrow and I'm not going\nto neglect you like pokey\nserves a seat at the table - like she\ndeserves to be there and she's bitter\nhelped you out a lot and you're not\ntrying to tell her that she's a bad\nperson but at the same time like Iman\nneeds some time to herself and like you\ncan sit with both of those right like\nyou can sit with like I am NOT going to\nlive up to my responsibilities and I'm\ngonna feel guilty and that's okay I\ndon't have to give in to the guilt and I\nalso don't have to try to conquer it\nlike this is the problem that people\nhave is they try to conquer their\nnegative emotions and you started you\nstarted like from the [ __ ] get-go\nfirst words out of your mouth how do I\nnot cry how are we doing oh we're okay\nwe're on the right track how did we do\nthat just talking no letting it it's not\njust talking in correct answer now how\ndo you feel\nnotice how do you feel\nscrambling for correct on answer trying\nto compute good soup that [ __ ] you're\nnot gonna find it anything you say I'm\ngonna say you're wrong that's good I\nguess like challenge there's a word I'm\nlooking for that I could find but it\ndoesn't matter this is the kind of like\nback and forth that I feel is actually\nconducive or constructive to what I need\nI'm trying to figure out how your\nsquirtle related with that it's\nsquirrely there's squirrel eNOS in there\nsee damn it your money come on no see\nsee even now you're saying but I'm like\nthat statement is saying I'm doing the\nthing that I should be to grow to be a\nbetter person I mean this does feel nice\nthough I know it feels nice but like do\nyou see how deep it is it's like even\nthen the reason you're okay with it\nbecause because beneath all of the\ndiscomfort you're actually growing\nyou're actually moving towards should I\nthink also it just kind of feels nice to\nnot cry for like three minutes\nyeah focus on that and not so much think\nabout oh this is going in a good way yes\ngood yeah right so that's that's the pen\nhere you're like oh like for that pens\nactually like we're fine with the pen\nbeing here it doesn't need to be\nanywhere else and you're absolutely\nright that that feels good and so now\nI'm gonna have a crazy crazy thought for\nyou it's not because we're talking it's\nnot because you're venting it's because\nyou are being where you are that's why\nyou're not crying and that's why you're\nlaughing and this is what would the\ndiscovered he called it bliss and people\ndon't even know what that means being\nwhere you are is bliss and being where\nare you thinking about where you should\nbe is suffering so you don't you're not\ngetting better at this you can't get\nbetter at this you can't level up you\ncan just do it or not do it in a given\nmoment and no amount of doing it before\nit is actually untrue but no amount of\ndoing it because your brain can change\nand there's neuroscience at Bolton and\nall that [ __ ] but just pretend for a\nmotor work with me no amount of doing it\nis going to change the fact that you\nhave to do it today and now like this is\nthe battle that you have to fight right\nis like you have to say like okay\nthere's a part of me that wants to be\nbetter and like I'm just gonna talk now\nI'm gonna do the thing into here and now\nbecause if you think about all of those\nshoulds those shoulds are about the\nfuture they're not about now they're\nabout like I should do this so that this\nperson can do this I should do this so\nthat this person can do this and then I\nhave to do this and I shouldn't call my\nparents more because why should you call\nyour pants more because they could die\none day and if they died one day and\nthen I'd be guilty because I didn't call\nme oh my god yeah oh my god yeah that's\nmy brain except like you know for\nanother like two minutes yeah absolutely\nand then you get exhausted to that in\nthe brain's like hey next thing the next\nthing to beat ourselves up over beat\nherself up beat yourself up beat ourself\nup and you're absolutely right that this\nis instrumental to your success\nabsolutely right because unless you beat\nyourself up\nso you have a high degree of neuroticism\nand conscientiousness from the Big Five\npersonality kind of if you know what any\naction is but what that means is that\nlike you're you're basically like a med\nstudent you're like a [ __ ] trihard\nmedicine I hate these kids okay no I was\nnot a med student\nI was an end student and there's a\ndifference okay all the same stem is all\nthe same all the STEM fields disagree\nbut okay all you get where you're coming\nfrom if I didn't go into NJ I would have\ngot into med I know you don't have to\ntell me that\nMuraki\nyou know Moroccan immigrants coming to\nthe US or Canada like come on thinking\nabout that so much I've literally not\nonly been like daydreaming but just\nregular dreaming fantasizing about like\ngoing back to school\nplease tell me you're not going to\nbecome a dog no I I don't think I could\nbecome a doctor but yes just like going\nback to school and I know I shouldn't be\nlook it is not ideal seems like you\ndon't you don't get to you don't get to\njust change the words and still have the\nthoughts I know I know I mean you know I\nwas gonna call you a four year but\nthat's okay that's you actually calling\nattention to it which is fine that's\nbeautiful that's what you should do you\nshould know that that's you noticing it\nthat's I think it's my brains way of you\nknow again trying to problem-solve like\noh I'm not happy with the way my life is\nhow about I go back three years when I\nwas in university doing engineering and\nwhatever maybe then I would be well I\nmean I no no no I I don't know that\nthat's just problem solving because that\ncould be you mom that could that could\nbe him on saying I actually want to go\nback and have some of those experiences\nthat I missed out on because I deserve\nthem maybe it's problem-solving maybe\nit's that I don't know what do you think\nI think when it's specifically in\nregards to like going back to school\nit's it was just like that sentiment of\nlike life being simpler because I could\nlive by a rubric but I do think in\ngeneral when I just think about the\namount of time that I've been streaming\nI think about those also quarantine has\nreally made me think about I guess all\nthe experiences I probably missed out on\nespecially because I had a lot of\ntraveling plans for this year and I felt\nlike that was one of the ways that I\ncould simultaneously do my job but\nexperience new things and feel like I'm\nlike growing as a person or allowing\nmyself to develop some sort of identity\nthat I'm happy with or experience good\nand bad and now feeling like I guess I\ncan't get to do that it further imposes\nthe fact that I really haven't gotten to\nin the past and I just feel sad\nI'm gonna think for a second so\nsometimes I have these this is one of\nthose moments can she hear me I guess\nnot\nso I can say this I'll just wait for\nthis is one of those moments can you\nhear me no huh and this is one of those\nmoments I have these moments sometimes\nwhen I'm talking to people and generally\nspeaking in my day job but remember this\nisn't psychiatry okay\nso I have these moments where someone\nsays something important and profound\nthat I just have this emotional reaction\nthat it's gonna sound like a complete\n[ __ ] and I just I couldn't care less\nokay but good like like I mean I get\nthat you had all these ideas about\nyourself and like but even then it\nseemed like it's so subtle it's it\nbecause it's the same [ __ ] it's like\nyou're trying to figure out how to be a\nbetter you mm-hmm you're like oh like I\nhad this like frankly it infuriates me\nactually a little bit what do you think\nabout like you know I was gonna travel\nand still work but like you're still\nfeeding that same beast you're trying to\nfind you're not that's not actually\ngonna I mean it's gonna help the little\nIman in me was like I found a compromise\nexactly yeah but I think the problem is\nthat that you don't deserve a compromise\nyou deserve Iman Iman needs to get her\nseven years back like traveling and and\nstreaming it's not like I'm not saying\ndon't do it right because if that sounds\nwonderful and fun and all that good\nstuff it sound like a great idea and at\nthe same time like don't confuse\nyourself that that's I mean it's a step\nin the right direction but it's not the\nroute like the route is that like you\nshould be able to travel and not work I\nwill have a lot of people telling you\notherwise that's fine so so\nbut then then we get back to like okay\nso like Oh what are you telling me Amon\nare you telling me that you're living\nyour life for others huh yes but to be\nfair that's also like where I derive the\nmost satisfaction okay fine so I don't\nthink oh yeah yeah so I don't think that\nyou should ignore others and I think\nthat's part of your entire MA\nso daughter mine is the son script word\nfor duty so I think that I to have to\nlive my life for others I don't think I\ncan just stop streaming now and I think\nthat that's fine but at least I\nacknowledge and I think this is what\nyou've got to think about is like it's\nokay to do things for other people but\nyou should understand sizz not that you\ndon't don't do things for other people\nit's that you devalue yourself for maybe\nnot wanting to do those things there's a\nhuge difference between saying I'm gonna\neat I'm sitting there for getting my\nafternoon coffee I used to have this\nproblem all the time it I trained at\nthis place called Massachusetts General\nHospital and so I was I was at MGH and I\nwas sitting there getting my 4:00 p.m.\ncoffee because I was tired and\noverworked and all that [ __ ]\nand I'd get my coffee and then in in the\nlittle display case they'd have like\nthis like healthy muffin and they have a\nchocolate chip cookie and I would have a\nstruggle every day and the turnout that\nthe bran muffin was actually pretty good\nand and so I would eat the bran muffin\nand there's a big difference between\nsaying I'm gonna eat the bran muffin\neven though I want the chocolate chip\ncookie and saying I should want the bran\nmuffin over the chocolate chip cookie\nand I think there's a big difference\nbetween doing something because you\nthink it's the right thing to do and\nbecause it's a sacrifice and beating\nyourself up because that's not something\nthat you don't want to do I have no\nproblem with you trying to support your\ncommunity or do things that are like\ngood for the people on Twitch which is\ngreat I'm behind that 100% but I want\nyou to be honest with yourself about\nlike he's that actually what you want\nand if you say let I'm willing to make\nthe sacrifice I mean I make sacrifices\nall the time my\nand does this thing where once or twice\na week she wakes up at like 3 or 4 in\nthe morning\nshe can't go back to sleep she comes and\nyou know we tried to put her to sleep\nfor a while and then she's like at 5 in\nthe morning she's like daddy I want\nnoodles and I wake up and then I'm up\nwith her from like 4 to 7 and and you\nknow it's absolutely but you try getting\nwoken up at 4 in the morning yeah I mean\nit sounds cute it's wonderful and it\nmakes me feel like a good dad and this\nalso it also sucks you know so so like I\nthink that the issue here is not that\nyou're not willing to do things that\nsuck the problem is that I think you\nbeat yourself up for not wanting to do\nthem mm-hmm and this still goes back to\nI mean if you want to go back to the the\nTrail of Tears we got to go back to like\nlike what was life like for you as a kid\ncuz I mean that's where all this started\nmm-hmm the indebtedness like it's\ncrushing he sounded so heavy when you\nsaid that that word and should you be\ngrateful like absolutely did they do a\nlot for you absolutely but I can tell\nyou something else that if you really\nwant to like get emotional that they\nwould be do they know how you feel it\nwould destroy the\ndamn it would destroy them\nand you have to tell them because I want\nyou to you know what do they want for\nyou come on they want me to be happy I\nknow that and are you sometimes right so\nare you gonna and this is the the other\nthing is like print it's pretty smart\nespecially your parents I think they\nknow yeah baby\nmaybe not why don't you tell them how do\nyou feel I don't know it's even hard to\ntell you how I feel I think it's very um\n[ __ ] stranger the Internet\nI feel like it's a very convoluted for\nstarters and also I really really I\ndon't like to worry my parents so even\njust telling them like oh I had a bad\nweekend or I'm crying or whatever it is\nlike especially for my mom that will\njust worry the heck out of her she'll be\nringing me every like hour and if\nanything that just makes me feel more\nstressed out cuz now not only am I like\nsad or stressed or whatever it was\ninitially but now I am worried about her\nbeing worried and also kind of irritated\nit's just it's a big mess it does not\nfeel like the kind of process that um\nyeah I guess I've just learned to deal\nwith it on my own\nyeah so you remember earlier when I was\nlike talking about this this moment\nwhere you were in maan or you were pokey\nand that you should do something and you\ndidn't do that and you did the thing\nthat you should do and so that being the\nperson that you wanted to be uh-huh I\nthink we just found it like in a weird\nway like this makes perfect sense to me\nbecause what I'm hearing is that you\ngrew up in a household that and I'm not\ntrying to blame your\njust every household I mean my kids are\ngonna be screwed up like don't you know\ndon't believe yourselves about that so\nthe children of Psychiatrists I don't\nknow if you guys you guys ever met\nchildren of psychiatrists but all [ __ ]\nup and and so it's just it's it just an\ninevitability there's no such thing as a\nperfect parent like I mean you've done\nphenomenally well on so many metrics and\nlike you're also tortured and like we're\nall tortured late if that works right\nand and what I'm also hearing from you\nis that fundamentally like you know when\nyou expressed your feelings to your mom\nit sounds like you felt responsible for\nworrying her and then so there was there\nwas like I want you to imagine\nsix-year-old him on who's like I don't\nfeel good but if mom knows then she's\nnot gonna feel good and so you were\nprotective of your parents and by not\nshowing them like you shoved yourself in\nthe closet there's like crying him on\nand then there's happy him on and then\nwhat happy him on did is she took her\ncrying him on and she's like get into\nthe closet mom's coming what you've been\ndoing your entire life my friend yeah I\nthink you should talk to your parents\npardon I think you should talk to your\nparents yeah I maybe what what what\nhesitation do you have what do I say\nokay I can help you with that okay give\nit a shot you let me know how this\nsounds\nyour parents are still together yeah so\nI think you start by telling them that\nyou're grateful and you can add whatever\nsource so tell me their story of moving\nfrom Morocco to Canada um yeah when I\nwas four in Morocco it's actually funny\nwhen I was really really young I hated\nit's like school or like doing anything\nlike when I was little I was real wild\nand then we moved to Canada\nand then I became an angel sounds good\nbut I became very like studious it was\nall about like doing what I had to do\nand yeah that's just how I grew up my\nmom is a teacher and my dad is like an\nengineer but also taught at a university\nat some point so they were always like\nvery supportive when it came to school\nand that was like you know like I would\ndo on school I would get validation from\nthem and that was like my cycle of\nhappiness I guess and um oh they were\nalso like pretty strict it's like oh you\ndon't go out late like no boys in the\nhouse like you don't hang out with too\nmany boys do this you do that a lot of\nstuff that especially in like high\nschool my friends what do or could do I\nwouldn't but also like maybe I had like\na little while of like being rebellious\nor angry about that sort of stuff but\nespecially in like my later years of\nhigh school by just kind of learned to\nplay around it do you know what that\nit's not a saying that people use\noutside of gaming I don't I don't\nrepresent all people outside of games\nwhat do you get what I mean oh nice they\nplay around I'm not sure what you mean\nby that\nbecause I don't know psychologically or\nlike you yeah I don't know Oh what I\nmean is kind of just a work around it in\na sense work around but I know actuality\nlike sono idol mm-hmm so my wife for\nexample wasn't allowed to have boys in\nthe house either but she her weight\nwould which the way she worked around it\nis that she took a ladder and would\nleave it in the backyard so that people\ncould climb up the ladder and come in\nthrough a balcony that's a workaround I\ndon't know if that's a to Mickey\num for me I mean like sometimes I would\nsneak out to like get McDonald's with my\nfriends but I was never really\nrebellious so what do you mean my\nworkaround was just like I found\nhappiness online via just gaming and I\nlove to game so much I was like\noh well my parents want me to stay at\nhome all the time anyways so sure I\nguess I will forego whatever else and\njust stay at home and make funds online\nand then when I was seventeen that's\nwhen I started streaming and that was\nalso my way of like not being so sad\nabout missing out on other things it was\nlike oh I found something else to do and\nbe excited about yeah so I'm gonna try\nto keep things practical I'd love to\nexplore that further but I'm gonna try\nto keep things practical and hopefully\nyou know you I know you want a rubric by\nthe time we end this so no so no but I\nlike rubrics too I feel frustrated if\nthere isn't some sense of progress at\nthe end of it so we can we can be\npartners in crime there so thinking a\nlittle bit about it I mean I would start\nby just talking to them about like I\nwould start with exactly what you told\nme which is that you're grateful and\nalso feel indebted to them that you need\nto be happy in life and then you can\neven you know add color like you kind of\ndid to mine like I don't know I mean I'm\nthe son of immigrants as well so there's\nlike a powerful story there in my mind\nabout sacrifices that they made to come\nhere and I mean my parents you know\nwe're in like had to borrow money for\nthe plane ticket and and because they\ncouldn't afford a plane ticket and so\nthey came here with like two suitcases\nin debt and and you know it's it's it's\na powerful story of like a lot of\nsacrifice and like I remember my dad\nwhen he was like in high school like\nthey had they like singing class and so\nhe went to singing class like all kids\ndo and then like his say is his music\nteacher thought that he was like\ntalented so he's like you should come\nand you know join like this like Club\nand so they joined the club and they\nwent to go compete and they won so he\nwon first place for singing and he went\nhome and he he showed his my grandmother\nthe trophy and can\nguess what she did or what she said she\nsaid it probably wasn't important\nbecause I wasn't related to academics\nreally close she snapped it in half\nthrew it away smacked him upside the\nhead and said what the [ __ ] are you\ndoing wasting your time you should be\nstudying more mm-hmm\nyeah and so he did study more and he\nbecame a doctor and he came here in debt\nand I know exactly how you feel\nin terms of that indebtedness and I know\nfor me it manifested in a different way\nbecause I didn't do a good job I didn't\ndo well in school I failed and I was\nfilled same for letting them down\nand then and then eventually I became as\nI put it all Indian parents dreams and\nall Indian kids nightmare by becoming a\nharvard-trained physician and then I\nbecame I became that which I loved and\nwhat I loved growing up was like my\nparents would get tell me some random\nperson who I'd met once and their their\naccomplishments maybe like someone so\nson was like doing this like oh oh yeah\nit's so-and-so like mm-hmm yeah go for\nit I'm just gonna say like many years\ninto content creation even making like\nsix figures plus a year my mom would\nstill hit me with the are you gonna go\nback and get your degree next semester\nyou know it's like probably yeah but\nimagine how happy she's gonna be Iman\nwhen you tell her that you're gonna go\nback to school maybe that's\nsubconsciously oh boy that runs deep\nmaybe but going going back to you know\nhow to talk to you I mean I think you\ngot to talk to him and just tell them\nthat like you know I'm grateful and I\nfeel indebted and I feel like I need to\nbe happy but there's a part of me that\nisn't and hear what they have to say and\nyou're gonna it's unclear what you're\ngonna get like maybe your mom will start\nbreaking down in tears and then you can\nbreak down to tears little you guys can\ncry and all that stuff\nand and and yeah and then you good then\nthis is the hard part right you've got\nto sit with that and then you got to ask\nher mom why are you crying and then\nshe's gonna say something just because\nyou're suffering and then I'm gonna say\nwell I'm crying because you're crying\nand then you guys have to figure out\nlike how are you what are y'all gonna do\nabout that oh that's hard to imagine\nyeah absolutely and this is the thing\nI'm on I think you're playing a slow\nplayer game you got to start treating\nyour family as party members instead of\nNPCs I'm serious\nright like you're carrying all of this\nweight like I can't a mat I can't tell\nyou just the thought like if I had a\ndaughter in your situation it would be\nso hard I would just be livid that she\nwas not talking these things because\nthat's what I'm here for right I don't\nwant her to protect my feelings I want\nto be able to do something about them\nlike when my kid wakes me up at 5:00 in\nthe morning like of course I'm furious\nbut it's also like I'm glad you woke me\nup because you're two and a half years\nold and you can't make yourself instant\nnoodles I don't want you to try years\nold\nyeah but I'm 23 years old and so it\nfeels like I am old enough to the point\nthat like I should be able to deal with\nthese things there it is my parents\nthere it is where did you hear the word\nyeah yeah but here's you shouldn't like\nI mean I still rely on my mom for [ __ ]\nlike you know she still tries to do my\nlaundry and it's like it's weird I mean\nyou want to talk\nabout being like not independent I'm 37\nsensibly professionally successful\nindependent and I live with four women\nwho all in some capacity take care of me\nyou want to talk about I don't know what\nMoroccan culture is like but in Indian\nculture like men are incapable of taking\ncare of yourselves and I'm so incapable\nof taking care of myself that like one\nisn't enough - is it enough three isn't\nabout you need I thought I'd to breed a\ncouple to get my needs met and it's a\nbeautiful it's a beautiful scary thing\nthe day that you have a daughter that's\nold enough that can do something for you\nit's it's like wonderful but it's also\nlike hey can you go get me that thing\nfrom upstairs and they're like\nabsolutely dad and then they go in the\neditor like yeah okay I can get used to\nthis but you got to tell him I'm on and\nyou got to sit with her like worry and\nanxiety this is where the problem solver\nin you rec needs to recognize that like\npart of your reluctance to deal with\nfeelings probably comes as modeled\nbehavior from her and can you guys sit\nwith the idea that like there's parts of\nyou that are unhappy but like your life\nis good and you need to share with that\nwith them too like don't give them one\nseesaw like one part of the seesaw the\nproblem here is that you're you're only\ngiving them one half of the seesaw\ngive them both they'll be able to handle\nit talk about how okay maybe they can I\ndon't know I mean I think they could I\njust think it's so hard for me to I\nguess I guide\nlong matte path of like every time I\nmentioned something is not well you guys\ndon't need to freak out like I am NOT\ndying if like I sneeze once you like you\ndon't need to call me every two hours if\nI'm having a bad day it's fine so now\nI'm confused mm-hmm for two reasons the\nfirst is you say what do I say to them\nand because you seem to have a really\ngood answer the second thing is you say\nI should know better and it sounds like\nyou absolutely fine do your exactly your\nspot-on right you need to sit with them\nand teach them because you are an adult\nactually that is the statement of an\nadult is in recognizing that like you\nneed to explain to your parents and say\nlike and so now I can give you some\nlanguage around this okay so take notes\nso when I tell you that I'm unhappy or I\ncry what do you guys think is going on\nand what do you think you have to do\nabout it and and just explore that with\nthem which is gonna be a really\nconfusing question like I had a two and\na half hour conversation with my mom the\nother day about like some really basic\nstuff about like understanding your\ninsides because she just doesn't like\nI'm assuming that Indian Moroccan\nculture because I understand a little\nbit about Moroccan culture like pretty\nsimilar in terms of you have your option\nof stem field no boys in the house you\ncould also perhaps be a lawyer if you\nwant to be a little bit edgy yeah so so\nin our case it wasn't edgy my dad said I\nhave an older brother and he told he\nsaid that one of y'all is gonna be a\ndoctor and one of y'all is gonna be a\nlawyer and I hate what I used to say my\nmed school interviews and they're like\nwhy do you want to be a doctor like what\nbrings you here and I would say well yes\nso I tell them that my dad told me that\none of y'all has to be a doctor when it\nall has to be a lawyer and my brother's\nolder and he got to choose first and he\nwent to law school so here I am yeah and\nso talk to them about you know what are\nthey thinking like and then asked\nexplicitly like some and I think you\nshould share like everything that you're\nsharing with us right which is that you\nsometimes hesitate to share things with\nthem because of how much it hurts them\ntell them that and so like what do you\nguys think about that\nand then like is it okay for me to like\ntell you that I'm not doing okay and\nlike I know it hurts you but like I'm\ngonna be okay\nlike I'm not so worried about it oh you\nknow how like how they say if you have a\nchild you shouldn't be overly protective\nof them especially when they're like\nsuper super young and be too scared of\nthem getting sick because the only way\nyou build your immune system is by\ngetting sick every now and then when\nyou're young I I feel like I guess\nthat's what happened to me in terms of\njust like general life experiences\nabsolutely beautifully point and am I'm\nnot supposed to be am I supposed to be\ndoing that I was just thinking am i\nraising my kids wrong oh I don't know I\ndon't know you know it's it's really\nit's okay you'll find out in like ten or\ntwenty years don't worry about it\nabsolutely that's the approach I'm\ntaking right yeah I guess maybe that's\nhow I see it yeah absolutely I think it\nmakes sense I think you are overly\nprotected and and by overly protected I\nthink what you've been protected from or\nwhat you've been insulated against this\nto a certain degree your own feelings\nand emotional expression and and so\nyou'll be thrilled you can tell your mom\nI'm on that that you know I spoke with a\nguy who happens to be a psychiatrist and\nhe said he he said I was just like all\nof the middle-aged you know Middle\nEastern and or South Asian or Asian\nattorneys I'm just like that and that I\ndon't know how to emotionally express\nmyself or connect with you guys on an\nemotional level and I'm also very\nfinancially and professionally\nsuccessful and I'm deeply unhappy I mean\nI don't think you do\nbut I don't think you're deeply unhappy\nbut I think you've got to connect and\nthis goes back to loneliness like I\ndon't understand you know I think you\nspeaking of things that you've missed\nout on and things that you owe yourself\nI don't I don't believe that you need to\nhave an NPC relationship with your\nparents like that's like I mean it\nsounds like you're alone from them you\nyou know they're they're NPCs and you\nhave scripted interactions with them\nit's not like you know it's like you\nwalk up to them and it's like take your\npick\nI am doing well and then she responds\nwith when are you going to college and\nthen it's like it's like literally like\na [ __ ] NPC you go up to them and then\nyou right click them and then they say\nthat like come on like what do you think\nabout going to college next semester and\nyou know like in games you can have\ndialogue with people you can have the\nsame [ __ ] dialogue over and over and\nover again and those are the\nrelationships we have with our parents I\ndo want to say though that like I also\nfeel bad because it's not it's not\nentirely their fault I also feel like\nand I'm here whatever it's about fault\nalso it just makes me really sad because\nlike I left Canada three years ago and I\nmoved out from home at 18 for University\nanyways but I also feel like it's\nexponentially more difficult to do these\nkinds of things with that considerate\nand with like language barrier to some\nextent because I feel like that kind of\nthing would translate so much better in\nperson and I was actually hoping to I\nwas planning on visiting them a week\nbefore the quarantine started and I was\nhoping to like perhaps get to tackle\ncertain issues but then that didn't\nreally get to happen either and I like I\ncan't tell whether I'm like putting it\noff by wanting to do it in person or if\nlike I really think that that would make\na difference but I guess it's just\nsomething that I feel has also stunted\nstunted my ability to do that with them\nsure do you meditate yes\nI was doing really good up until two\nweeks ago and then I started crying a\nlot there might be a connection it might\nbe connection right so so come on I\nthink you're very spiritually adapt I\nthink you have a mind that's that's well\ndesigned for spiritual exploration so\nand I really would would recommend that\nyou continue to not miss necessarily you\nhave to meditate but I think so a couple\nof things so you're now we talk about\nkardama familiar with karma come on yeah\ncould you just sure define it yourself\nsure I know so so when I look at you I\nsee a certain like you were dealt a\ncertain hand in life and I think that\nthe hand that you were dealt is sort of\nlike geared toward spiritual growth and\nand what there are a couple of things\nthat I look for and people who are like\nprone towards kind of spirituality and\nit everyone is prone to their own kind\nof spirituality I think you're prone to\na very particular kind that's actually\nlike with us because I think you have a\nlot of the struggles that he had like\nliterally like literally right so if we\nthink about what worked for him like he\nif we think about you know his starting\nposition in a particular game like your\nstarting position is actually somewhat\nsimilar and so his solutions may apply\nlike you know if you I don't know what\nkind of games you play but if you have a\nparticular star can there's like a\nparticular strategy that's like\noptimized for you know winning yeah and\nand so I think that the other thing is\nyou're very self-reflective I don't know\nif you've done therapy or other kinds of\nactivities or you kind of do this kinda\nstuff but your ability to catch your\nthoughts and notice what you're doing\nfor example when you said I don't know\nif that's like me just making excuses\nfor myself that I want to do this in\nperson and I want it to be perfection\neven my profession is it that amount of\nself reflectiveness I think is very\nhelpful for a particular kind of\nspiritual growth which is the kind of\nthat I I like which is not so much about\nGod or devotion or anything like that\nit's it's really about understanding\nlike how you work it's actually a system\nof engineering it's not like religion\nI'm serious so I mean what I think about\nit as is like mechanisms of the mind and\nin your case you have a particular thing\ncalled a some scar\nsome scars like sort of a ball of\nundigested emotion or like a background\nprogram that's kind of running in your\nmind that flagellates you for not being\ngood enough that drives you forward but\nat the same time it's just like a\nprocess that's running on its own and\nlike you know processes that are running\non their own can be like good for our\ncomputer but then also there are some\ntimes where we need like\ncontrol-alt-delete and like end task and\nyeah a filthy Mac user but disgusting\nalso an eternal struggle between myself\nand my wife but anyway so I think you've\ngot this thing right and I think you're\nable to see it like you're able to see\nthe should and and so I think that's\ngood and I would just recommend that you\ncontinue pursuing spirituality and like\na pretty concrete way because that's\nwhat you'd like to do and and really\nkind of focus on the stuff because I\nthink you'll get a lot of yield out of\nit but in terms of you know should it be\ndone better in person I think yeah like\nI think could you be avoiding absolutely\nbut I think it also you know being able\nto hug I don't know if you hug your\nparents but of course I mean some some\nbrown people don't some Asian people\ndon't yeah so yeah so like I for example\nnever my parents never kissed me like\nit's weird like like I had to like like\nwhen I was 18 or 19 I was like I'm gonna\nstart kissing my mom on the head cuz I\ndidn't know what to do and now I'm all\nabout the kissing with my kids but\nanyway so so III think that you know\nphysical distance may actually be\nimportant and you just have to decide\nlike this is also where I think you're\ntrying to set up the perfect\nconversation which now that's a problem\nright because like you shouldn't let\nperfect to get in the way of like\nstarting a conversation yeah and so if\nyou want to do it but that too is like\nKarma so this is like this is you're\ngonna moan so I didn't even explain what\ngot my eyes but you know karma is kind\nof your circumstances is one way to\nthink about it and the way that I think\nabout it is it's really just the\nprinciple of cause and effect so like\nyou know if I\nso if I walk into a bathroom that's\nflooded that is a circumstance but at\nthe same time if I turn my bathtub on\nand you know put the stopper in and let\nit fill up and overflow like that\ncircumstance is created by something\nthat I did so now you're gone well like\nkovat is part of your karma because it's\na circumstance it's something in the\nexternal environment it's not something\nthat you control and at the same time\nlike karma is kind of tricky because\nit's sort of like you can shape your\nenvironment over time so you do control\nyour environment to a certain degree but\nyou also don't control your environment\nto a certain degree and and for you to\nthink a little bit about like like right\nnow so you can't have that conversation\nduring koban so maybe there's some kind\nof so now do you want to have it are you\nnot going to have it\nyeah I'm really unsure yeah so I think\nthink about it how are we doing in terms\nof untangling by the way I think good\nI'm crying a bit less I want to soon\ngood but in general I I mean going into\nthis conversation has again being\nreflective I feel like most of my life\nI've been so busy being grateful for my\nparents and the fact that they've for\nthe most part been like very loving and\nsupportive that I would have never even\nthought that anything in regards to my\nrelationship with them would be\nunhealthy I guess I just put it upon\nmyself to just deal with the Cork's I\ndon't know yeah it's a good way to it's\nnice to I guess delve into that yeah I\nmean what I'm so dealing with the courts\nis interacting with an NPC like you\naccept them as who they are like if you\nreally want to understand acceptance\nthink about the way that you approach an\nNPC because they're not going to change\nright and you just accept them for who\nthey are it's\nyeah yeah but also like it was I thought\nI was doing it for them you know you are\ndoing it for them and that happens to be\nthe wrong way to do it yeah Prabhas like\nthe whole point is that like you should\ndo things for them and they should do\nthings for you but your relationship\nwith them is one-sided and like that's a\nproblem and I can I can assure you as a\nparent that like you know I want a two\nsided relationship with my kids like\nthat's what they want\nyeah and just think about how happy\nthey're gonna be when you share with\nthem that you're unhappy and then you\nshare with them that you're happy right\nand they want to help you get there you\nmight say anyway this is something like\nin terms of the tangled ball that we\nkind of didn't get to or something that\nyou feel like is left unaddressed\nI'm sure could I go to the bathroom real\nquick yeah sure thank you I guess I'll\ncheck quick chat while we're waiting\nmaybe I should go pee too\nno I don't really like Pierre I don't\nlike drinking I gotta eat some of them\nfirst but is Cowell Niranjan no no yeah\nI'm gonna get food I like talking to him\non she's cool\nOh is she hard on herself\nyeah yeah but I mean not not while I'm\ntalking to her right that's like really\ndisrespectful guys I don't I don't mind\num I'm gonna drink on stream but like\nit's not fair to her like you think\nabout it like if you guys came on stream\nwhat would you want me to be lucid or\nwould you want me to be and hit like yep\nhe created okay so it's it's not that I\ndon't mind being festive but I you know\nlet's let's think about why we do this\nright so the stream isn't isn't about I\nknow it's bizarre it's not about an\nentertainment right like so the one way\nthe thing that screws me is when I start\nthinking about anything except what the\ndrink the stream is actually for and the\nstream is to help the person that we're\ntalking to nothing more nothing less\nand anything else that happens in terms\nof donations and stuff which is amazing\nand I'm grateful for it don't get me\nwrong but like that's not why you do it\nright you guys should donate and support\nus because of what we do with the person\nthat we're talking to and also donate\nbecause you think it's entertaining cuz\nwe'll do that from time to time but like\nlet's not forget what our primary\nautonomous is to help the person there\nbecause when we help that person like\nyou think about it right because it's\nAoE healing so if I like you know if I\nmiss Cass to heal like not only does it\nnot help that person but then it like\ndoesn't help any of you guys like I\ndon't know how anyone is helped by me\nbeing a drunken [ __ ] on stream\nentertain sure and that's something that\nwe're willing to do and sometimes it's\nimportant to last we'll laugh but like\nhow many of you guys have relationships\nwith your parents where you guys treat\nthem like NPCs and the second thing is\nwhere they treat you like an NPC right\nwe haven't even gotten there but like\nthe other thing is like I mean I was\njust getting on role talking to myself\nwhich I sometimes do but the other thing\nwhich is kind of tricky here is that you\nknow you learn how to treat them like\nNPCs in a particular way like because\nthat's how they treat you because they\ndidn't see him on they saw pokey\nengineering major in a couple of years\nit's gonna be I mean I don't know what\nyour relationship status is but like\nit's gonna go from no boys to like why\naren't you married yet\nlike that's what happens like one day\nflip a switch yeah yeah and you're 23 so\nyou may be a bit young but I give it one\nto two years and if it hasn't started\nand you don't have a boyfriend then\nthey're gonna and it's not like a\nboyfriend it's like single now okay\nmarriage when child when yep yeah see\nthat's an NPC it's like when you go to\nthe NPC and it's like you're you're like\nlooking like you're like open the vent\nlike you know the vendor menu and it's\nlike where's the child where is the\nmarriage like I like one of those please\nlike can you you know that dialogue\noption is like not like they're like\nclicking the dialogue what when are you\nmarried and then they like look at your\nresponse and your responses no and\nyou're like no no I'm looking for the\nresponse to transition yeah it's like\nit's like you're trying to unlock the\nwrite like you know it's like you're\ntrying to unlock a higher tier of\nresponse from the NPC it's like why\ndon't we have to do to get him on to say\nyes exactly it's like I have to go\ncomplete this quest find Moroccan lawyer\ncheck bring Moroccan lawyer to him on\nJack come on we want you to come visit\nyou go home there's some random dude\nthere he seems awkward you seem awkward\nat the end of a quest failed yeah you go\nto you go to the NPC and you're like\nokay what are you married yet and\nthey're like oh [ __ ] we failed the quest\nso you know then you know what you do\nwhen you fail the quest right and Wow is\nyou go and you pick up you band in it\nyou pick it up again it's and they're\nlike hey I'm on you should come home for\nyou know whatever you come home it's not\nrocket lawyer it's Moroccan doctor\nexactly they're like let's try yeah and\nthey're gonna keep doing it because\nthey're treating you like an NPC it's\nit's it's unfortunate right we don't\ntreat we don't we treat people as\ncaricatures anyway\nI was just talking to a chat it's okay I\ngo on long rants to twitch chat is all\nfull so come on help me understand a\nlittle bit about like you know I'm kind\nof I'm not sure whether I'm not sure\nwhere to go from here I'm happy to\ncontinue talking if you want to I'm\nhappy to kind of summarize or if you\nhave questions or things like\nyeah we are yeah I think there's some\nother things that maybe we could delve\ninto a little bit namely especially as\nof late and I don't know exactly why as\nof late but I feel like I have a lot of\nI feel very jaded and I feel like I yeah\nI mean yeah\noh and I feel like I have a lot of\npent-up a resentment and regards to like\nI don't want to say like streaming\nbecause streaming isn't what bothers me\nbut um a lot of the things that I've\ncome of stream okay and I think it's\nresulted the jaded Ness in me feeling\nvery defensive okay I didn't but I know\nwe'll have to you know unload that one\nstep at a time\nyeah you know no so so defensive so you\nknow sometimes I can be a real [ __ ]\non stir I didn't mean to like literally\nlaugh in your face when you said Jaden\nbecause I just like I was like what the\n[ __ ] do you think you're like talking\nyeah sorry when I said that it was\nbecause I was referring to I guess\nanother aspect of my life yeah no no I\nget it but like this is the thing right\nthis is the background process this is\nyou don't just whip yourself in one\ndimension this is the shoulds because\nlike when you live a life of shoulds\nyou're gonna be resentful like so this\nis a okay okay so funny at this point it\nsounds like a disease you have a really\nbad case of the show it absolutely is a\ndisease there's prescribed yes yes\nthat's what I do as I prescribe things\nfor the case of the show I'm writing a\ncouple of books and one of them like one\nof the one of the chapters is a case of\nthe shirt of what it could us I call it\nlike I talked about it like it's a\ndisease because it [ __ ] is\nokay so like first thing to understand\nis like so let's think about where Jaden\ncomes from okay so anytime you have a\ncase of the shuds you end up with one or\none of two things\nshame or resentment if you fill if if\nyou give in to the shoulds and you\naccomplish what you should do you end up\nwith resentment and if you don't\naccomplish what you should do you end up\nwith shame right and you've got a\nhealthy dose of both like you feel\nguilty for not doing it\nand once the should is there you're\nyou're stuck with one of those like I\nhate to break it to you but that's why I\nthink about it as a disease because\nthat's the only thing that can happen\nbecause either you sacrifice of yourself\nand then you end up resent resenting\nright like I should have a kid that's\ngonna lead to Jade Yeah right all of the\nthings that we're forced to do in life\nor that we we don't do of our own\nbecause should is not a sacrifice\nshouldn't sacrifice are very different\nthings\nsacrifice is a choice should is like a\npressure and so the second that that in\nso I think the thing is you're gonna\nhave more resentment and when you say\njaded what I hear is resentment because\nyou gave of yourself something that you\ndid not want to and you like are\nfrustrated about that you were pushed\ninto giving I don't know how much of\nthis applies could be completely wrong I\ndon't know what so like when you said\njaded I was like yeah damn right right\nlike it's not something new it's it's\nthat somewhere along there I mean so\nthis is my hypothesis is that somewhere\nin there that jaded Miss that resentment\ncomes from doing things that you\nactually did not want to do and you\nmentioned something about streaming and\nI think this is a great example of like\nsomething that on the one hand you do\nwant to do something that you recognize\nis your Dharma something that you\nrecognize this fun and is something that\nyou don't want to do in some ways or\nthat you don't want peace of it but you\nforce yourself to take that piece of it\nmaybe because you don't know how not to\nor maybe because it's worth it but\nthere's a part of you that says I don't\nwant this yeah yeah\nI think I'm stuck in that place yeah and\nand so we can talk more about that but\nlike absolutely and then you feel\ndefensive and we can talk about what\ndefensive is so so give me more and this\nis the tricky thing now what I'm gonna\nask you to do Aman is don't give me even\nthough they're wonderful don't give me\nyour conclusions give me raw data right\nso and I know you gave a wonderful\nsummary so that was fantastic because\nthat got me started and I have a\nframework but maybe you've biased me in\nsome way and maybe I already think I\nknow the answer maybe not so tell me\nwhat do you what do you mean by jaded I\nthink a lot of the stuff that has\noccurred especially over the last two\nyears has left me jaded both via the\nways people have treated me people that\nI know as well as like randoms online\nhave you been treated dad dad dad dad um\n[Music]\nso many people I I just feel so like\nused and abuse the amount of people that\nwill like um be so nice to me and then\nask me for help and behind closed doors\nlike as you know whether it's selfish or\nnot I really enjoy being of use to\nothers I get a lot of validation from\nthat and I feel like it's good for\neveryone but then like at any given\nopportunity will throw my name under the\nbus or make me the butt of a joke or\nwill what's the word\nnot appeal to anyways well I guess like\nappeal to or take advantage of the\nmountains of people that are ready to\nhate me at any moment and then I think\nit also makes me really jaded to know\nthat jaded to know what that regardless\nof like how someone will treat me\nprivately the public aspect of that is\nso different because there's business\ninvolved that sounds fun yeah\nwell like I don't want to say I agree\nbecause it's just my feelings but and\nlike there you go and validating him on\nagain no I'm just so used to people in\nvalidating me that I just start doing it\nto myself all the [ __ ] time yeah it's\ngot to change my friend because you're\nallowed to be resentful oh okay thank\nyou you just worry about you to drop an\nf-bomb oh I'm so sorry no I'm but I\nthink it's a sign of progress a plus\n[Laughter]\nyeah and there's like two sides of it\nthere's like people where I feel it's\nlike manipulative in the sense that like\nthey want to be on my good side\nprivately but then publicly they want to\nappeal to the people that hate me as\nwell and I've literally had very popular\npeople say very rude things about me\nhave their viewers harass me and then\nthat very same evening or next day they\nDM me being all nice or asking for help\nor whatever it is and that is such a\nfreaking brain boom for me because like\nmy reflex is like if someone asks me\nsomething I want to respond I want to be\nnice I want to like do the right thing\nthat's what like I should do and that's\nlike what I enjoy doing but that also\nhaving to like calculate weight but this\nthis person like has no genuine care for\nme like they just want to say stuff\nthat's gonna get like clipped and\nshipped or have people laugh at or\nridicule me or whatever it is like they\nwant their cake and they want to eat it\ntoo\nand then there's the flipside sorry when\ndid where do you get your idea of what\nthe right thing to do where did you get\nthe idea that helping people is the\nright thing to do\nwell to be fair like it makes me feel\ngood and I'm being helpful to someone\nelse so it just feels like the right\nthing to do\ncan I tell you a story so I think we\nhave a really messed up view of right\nand wrong so this is this is a train\nwreck of a story because I use some\nscript names and it's hard for people to\nfollow so there was a long time ago in\nIndia and I butcher the story every time\nI wouldn't try to keep it quick because\nI I really want to get you talking again\nand hear what you have to say but I just\nwonder I just can't help myself because\nthis infuriates me I like her stories so\nthere was a king in India a couple\nthousand years ago and he has a couple\nof kids and his eldest son is blind and\nthen he has another child who's younger\nis also a boy but is not blind and so\ngenerally speaking in ancient India you\nknow the throne passes I was gonna say\nthis today because people call you\nroyalty so I was like maybe this applies\nto you have to mix up so pay attention\nso the so you know generally speaking\nwhat would happen is the throne would\npass to the eldest son but his eldest\nson is blind so the king is kind of\ntrying to figure out he's like what\nshould I do\nso he ends up saying you know ultimately\nconcluding that the kingdom is best\nserved by a king who can see because\nthey would go into battle on chariots\nand archery was a big part of warfare\nand you have to be an archer and like I\nknow that there's an anime here there we\nhave blind archers but for the most part\nit's the knight good looks like an anime\nthing it's not a real thing yeah so he\nhe you know passes over his first son\nand passes the throne to his second son\nthen everyone's kind of okay with that\neldest son is somewhat resentful because\nhe felt like he deserved that creator he\nwas entitled to it and it's we'll see if\ndeserving or in being entitled to\ncertain things as part of what you\nexperience and then like things are\nactually okay though because you know\neldest son can't really raise an army\nand fight a war because he's [ __ ]\nblind so then you know so the the king\nwho's\nthe younger brother G has children and\nthen the blind he's also kind of a king\nthe blind prince or whatever has\nchildren as well and then the blind\nking's children are very resentful\nbecause they felt like they got a bad\nbeat and they felt like my father should\nhave been king and so I should have been\nking but he got robbed and I'm getting\nmugged\nso they were filled with jealousy and so\nwhat happens is that so there are two\nsets of gun cousins one of those sets of\ncousins is called the bond Ava's they're\nsort of the good guys they're the people\nwho are actually kings and then the the\nbad guys are the Kauravas and they're\nthe jealous people and so what happens\nis they're jealous for a while and they\nthey actually try to kill their cousins\nhere there and then eventually what they\ndo is they come up with this plan to GAM\nbecause they know that the eldest son of\nthe bond Ava's like has a weakness that\nhe can't turn things down so if they're\nlike hey I'm yeah okay so they're like\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna\ninvite the the guy who actually rules\nthe kingdom over for a gambling night\nand then we'll like yeah gamble thrown\nabsolutely so that's what they do and\nand they they kind of they don't really\ncheat per se but they've got someone on\ntheir side who's like really good at\ngambling so he kind of advises them and\nthey end up the the good guys end up\ngambling away the kingdom because that\nguy's a [ __ ] dumbass supposed to be\nhero that he's a [ __ ] dumbass and and\nthen and then eventually what happens is\nthat one of their that one of the\nPandavas advisors sort of stops in he\nsays instead of gambling away the\nkingdom why don't we put some conditions\non it and what you can say is that if\nyou guys win this hand you guys get to\nrule the kingdom for 13 years but after\nthose 13 years we get the kingdom back\nand during those 13 years you have to go\nincognito and if they find you and they\ncan discover where you are it resets the\nvlog so you basically have to go\nincognito mode for 13 years and if you\ncan successfully hide for 13 years you\nget to come back and you get to take\nthat back\nand so everyone agrees to this before\nthe bat the bet happens they end up\nlosing they lose the kingdom they go\ninto hiding\nthirteen years pass the governor of us\ntry to find the bond of Oz so that they\ncan reset the timer but they fail and\nthen thirteen years are over bond of us\ncome back and they say to the Kauravas\ncan I has my throne back please and what\nare the Corolla say yes they say no I'll\nsay [ __ ] you so it's ours now it's mine\nbut even such a good job hiding yeah\nthey broke oh yeah come on they broke\nthe rules they were nice to you in\nprivate and meet to you in public and\nwhat did you say you said yeah sure take\nit right you can have the best of me and\nyou can treat me like [ __ ]\nanyone will get there in a second so\nthen the bond of us are like okay you\nkind of have a fair argument right like\nbecause your dad was the older brother\nand so like it is you did kind of get\nrobbed and it's not your fault he's\nblind so let's do halfsies you guys take\nhalf the kingdom we'll take half the\nkingdom and what are the core OS a they\nprobably say see your minds learning\nokay right answer so they say [ __ ] you\nand the bond of us say okay fine we can\nlive with that because we're good people\nI'm on they're good people they're\ngivers they're helpers just like you\nthey're helpers right and other people\ncan be [ __ ] but we're gonna be nice\nto them and so they say fine\ngive us we're five brothers in it's our\nDogma it's our duty to rule because\nwe're kings right we're princes we're\nroyalty I should rule something so give\nus five villages you guys take the rest\ngive us each one village so that we can\ndo what we were born on this earth to do\nwhich is to rule in govern and y'all can\nhave 95% of the kingdom just give us\nfive percent what are the core I must\nsay I think\npoint they just say sure whatever but I\ndon't know yeah maybe they also still\nsay [ __ ] you absolutely right because\nthat's how people are\nthey say [ __ ] you terrible it is and it\nleaves me feeling so jaded\nthat people can do that and get away\nscot-free huh\njaded is that how you feel and they\nprobably feel I don't know a word worse\nthan jaded yeah right so it's almost\nlike the story is relevant to your\nsituation\nbizarre mm-hmm so then the bond of us\nsay like they're kind of confuse and\nthen and then there's a guy named\nKrishna he was the guy who advised the\nthirteen-year condition by the way so he\nsays absolutely this is unacceptable you\nguys can't accept this answer so Krishna\nsays you have to fight like it's it's\nnot acceptable like you can't if someone\npromises you something like be a giving\nperson is one thing like it's one thing\nto say that you were owed something and\naccept less and it's another thing to\neven accept way less but at some point\nyou have to draw your line in the sand\nand being a good person is not the right\nthing to do I don't know where to draw\nyeah yeah absolutely I get that right so\nthat's what we're gonna try to teach you\nhow to do and then the story sort of\ncontinues and on the eve of battle so\nthey like rap you know martial their\ntroops and they get everyone together on\nthe eve of Adam one of the brothers is\nlooking across at these people who are\nwho are nice to him when they did when\nthey Deanna people who are is his\nfriends and his teachers and and people\nthat he cares about in respects and he\ntruly believes her friends and he says\nyou know what it's not [ __ ] worth it\nlike it is not worth it to kill these\npeople that I care about and my friends\nfor the sake of like what you call\njustice says like I just don't want it\nlike it's not worth it to actually shoot\nan arrow and kill that guy he can be an\n[ __ ] but I don't want to kill them\nand then krishna says no you have to\nfight it's absolutely worth it because\nit's not about like being a nice guy\nlike life is about doing your dharma\ndoing your duty\nand in this case your duty is not to be\na nice guy and somewhere along the way\nwe we've we've conflated being a nice\nguy with doing your duty right and you\ndid it with your parents your duty to\nthem is not to protect them that's the\nnice thing to do absolutely because like\nhow is it not the right thing to do to\nprotect your parents but it's not your\ntournament it's not your duty you don't\nowe them license you owe them honesty\nand you owe them the chance to make your\nlife better even if it hurts them mm-hmm\nso there's a point where you got to draw\nyour line in the sand and being a nice\nis not the right thing you've got to do\nwhat's right and if people don't meet\nyou right I'm not saying like you burn\nall bridges because I'm not a fan of\nthat right so like my Road tends to be\ncommunication not you know fire and\nbrimstone but but I've also been\nseverely burned that way too burned in\nwhat way\nlike even if someone like if I try to\nspeak to someone about an issue\nprivately\nsome people will out that some people\nwill then judge me for trying to resolve\nsomething privately it just feels like\nwhether I respond don't respond it\ndoesn't matter what I do it will be\ntwisted and used against me to make me\nlook do you feel powerless you saw the\npowerless in the situation what I'm\nhearing for me more than anything else\nis that you don't have any kind of\nagency like no matter what you do you\nget [ __ ] yes that sounds awful I don't\nknow I feel bad saying that cuz like\ngorgeous I don't like I don't want to\nlike play victim like both because I'm\nnot perfect\nand because I have privilege but that is\nyou shouldn't be complaining come on is\nthat what you're saying yeah get in the\ncloset\ngood now you're learning get in the\n[ __ ] closet\nyeah I'm on you're not allowed to have\nfeelings like who the [ __ ] do you think\nyou are I'm having feelings being hurt\nby people your Twitter OMT who the [ __ ]\ntold you you get to have feelings\nand this is this is the crazy thing\nabout twitch right like this is what\npeople don't understand is that people\nlook at you and they look at streamers\nand they look at the audience and then I\nthink that there's a power dynamic\nbetween these two people that one of\nthese people is stronger than the other\nthe whole [ __ ] point of twitch is\nthat we're all equal right like what we\nsee here is like a terrible power\ndynamic because how do you even fight\nagainst that they are formless they're\ninfinite number mm-hmm and you're half a\nperson because half of yous in the plaza\nyeah like what's the real pout like if\nthe Internet is mad at you\nI learned this the hardening when I did\nan open Q&A on my discord live on stream\nand boy did I get [ __ ]\nreally yeah actually Aquarius experience\nbut like there were 300 people in a disc\nor chat we were just talking and I was\nanswering questions and one guy decides\nthat he's gonna start dropping and bombs\nand he just he just doesn't say anything\nexcept for the n-word over and over over\nagain and and he says it in a way I mean\nlike there's a small part of me that\ncan't blame the guy because you know I\nappreciated what he was doing because\nyeah I know it's like you know strike\nwhile the iron's hot and he said it like\nchugga-chugga-chugga-chugga\nchugga-chugga-chugga-chugga temperature\nso he he grabbed anyway so he and so\nthere was a part of me that thought it\nwas hilarious like I can't you know if I\nsaw that on LSF I would have laughed\nmm-hmm so I can't blame the guy but like\nthat's like there's just no way that\nlike an individual person can fight\nagainst the multitudes like you just\ncan't like you can't win against reddit\nyou get you can be you can be logged by\nreddit and you can be loved by twitch\nbut you can't win against them right\nit's like a Hydra like you chop off one\nhead like that's like what I'm hearing\ncome use the story the Hydra you chop\noff one head and grows two more you\nargue with someone on reddit and it's\nlike boy are two people downloading for\neveryone like like it's it's amazing\nit's like it's like every villains story\nbrought to life\nanything you send them away like only\nmakes them stronger Iman any kind of\ntalks it even this I worry feels like\ngiving people ammo for whatever it may\nbe\nyeah so I'm gonna try to say something\nabsolutely crazy which is given as much\nammo as they want to because whether\nthat ammo lands or not is on you they\ncan shoot but it's your choice whether\nyou get hit they can send you venom and\nthey can send you toxicity and and by\nthe way maybe this is famous last words\nright because maybe I don't know because\nI've never been on the bad end I mean\npeople criticize me and stuff but like I\ndon't think it's been anywhere near what\na lot of and I'm grateful for that\nplease don't please don't kill but but\nyou know it's easy for me to say so I\nacknowledge that but I do believe that\nlike the funny thing is that like I\nthink that I do a lot of I mean I think\nthe cool thing and what I mean by give\nthem ammo is that I think that twitch\nisn't evil right like sure it's this\nHydra but like sometimes the Hydra\ncotton see and that's actually what I've\ndiscovered in the month of May is like\npeople are donating like thousands of\ndollars I think the Hydra is like\namazing it's powerful but it's not evil\nit's just like twitch can be a force of\ngood and power and support and I think\nthat's what that's why you're successful\nbecause it's not if you think about like\nyou know the Hydra has a lot more heads\nthat are licking you than it does that\nare like biting you that's true you know\nand sometimes it's easy to forget that\nit's so easy to forget that and that\ncomes down to attachment and a couple of\nother things but I mean I don't think\nthat you should let you know if it's\nlike if it's being a bad Hydra you've\ngot to smack it on the nose and soon\nHydra that you should feel and I want\nyou to feel empowered to say things to\nspeak your truth in like you know if the\nconsequence has happened the consequence\nhas happened you know it's kind of like\nsometimes you got to be you know tank\nman is anyway so there's like this very\nfamous photo from\nTiananmen Square of like a dude with a\ngrocery bag standing in front of a line\nof Tanks and and anyway if you it's it's\nold now but like there's just there's\nlike it's you've probably seen the same\nsentiment can be found and take your\npick of anime when the underdog stands\nup and you just got a you know you got a\nhold hold your line sometimes and like\nif the tanks roll over you they roll\nover you like I'm not saying like\nbecause you are powerless like you can't\nyou can't stop a line of tanks with a\nhuman body but like you know that\nshouldn't stop you from speaking your\ntruth sorry I've been talking for a\nwhile no it's okay you know so there's a\npart of me that says like if people are\nmean to you in private\nthen you should let them know that it's\nhurtful and if they want to air that\ndirty laundry then like then you're done\nwith them so much unnecessary drama\nI've gone to the point where it's just I\njust I avoid where I am aware enough to\navoid what does that mean if I feel a\nsituation even where I am wronged and\nperhaps I should tell someone like why\nare you messaging me like this when you\nwere just talking [ __ ] however long ago\nI don't even feel like I should do that\nbecause that's like an open invitation\nto perhaps creating more drama and so\nit's like maybe I will just have no\nfriends and so I have no expectations of\nanyone that's sad way to live life\nyeah but maybe I will get hurt less that\nway you will get hurt less but I\nunderstand it's like it's better to have\nloved than not to have loved at all you\ntake the risk no no no no but let's not\naccept that right like let's make it\nlet's let's study that let's be\nscientific so like you've got a choice\nand and I don't I don't think I mean I\nmean I'm with you that you know I\npersonally believe it's better to have\nloved and lost than to never loved at\nall but it's easy for me to say that\nbecause I'm really lost\nI started out nothing and it it's\ndifferent like I'm in a different place\nbecause I had nothing for a long time\nand then I've gained a lot I don't\nreally know what it's like to lose you\nknow I was like there's a difference\nbetween losing your money and like being\nbroke from the get-go and so I don't\nreally know what it's like to lose like\neven on twitch like I'm still in the\nhoneymoon phase I think you know people\nfavor it I'm just ignorant like I just\ndon't know like I don't know you know\nthat's what everyone tells all all the\nboomers tell me like you did savor it\nwho's the boomer now which boomer but\nyeah I mean I I don't know so I think\nyou know you can try that right like you\ncan try ignoring them you can try not\nbeing connected to them and then there's\nsomething in me that says that like\nactually if we if we challenge people in\nthe right way and and we sort of diss on\ntheir defensive miss that maybe they can\ngrow and like I don't know I'm just like\nI don't know what would happen because\nyou say it sounds like when you take\nissue with them they like Eric publicly\nand it creates more drama sometimes yeah\nand what about the other times sometimes\nthey react very defensively I think also\nbecause like I don't know it's like\nbehind my back\nit's easy to make fun of me but directly\nto me perhaps they're intimidated on\nsome level and if I come to them with\nlike oh like this thing is not okay\nthey'll just be very defensive be mad\nmake a bigger deal out of it privately\nand publicly whatever it is it's going\nall sorts of ways and the only times\nthat ever like mm-hmm really goes well\nis if someone is like closer to me or we\nhave a more legitimate a baseline\nfriendship as opposed to just like being\nfriends or knowing each other or being\non good terms but actually that brings\nme to the other point of like kind of\nbeing jaded or feeling bad because even\nthough I have a lot of like good friends\non Twitch I never ever feel like anyone\nwould risk standing up for me\ncuz it could be bad for business and I\nmean that's nice and fair when it's just\nbusiness\nbut sometimes what do you think about it\nit kind of sucks mainly because but like\nI understand a lot of people just like\ndon't like that's not part of their\npersonality but it is like part of my\npersonality if I ever saw one of my\nfriends being wronged it's just like in\nme to wants like stand up for that or\nbeing like or say like that's not true\nthat's not fair above all blah\nand sometimes feeling like that would\nnever be reciprocated or never really is\nreciprocated kind of feels bad so kind\nof like that whole area of my work like\non it when it's just me streaming to my\naudience and like having a good like a\ngood time like that's fine but then\neverything past that feels like such a\nheadache and that's just\nthe iceberg honestly I think for a\nsecond of course take all the time you\nwant I have no plans this is not plans\nyou\nman this is complicated\ndo you say that often during these kinds\nof sessions I don't know I try not to\npay attention I guess if I didn't say it\noften what does that mean for you I\ndon't know I guess you sounded taken\naback or surprised or something I guess\nit does not mean much it is what it is\nit is what it is I think it means\nsomething just maybe it validates my\nsituation to some extent I think so that\nfeels nice hmm do I do I say validating\nthings often I have not kept track I\nthink you are not trying to tip the\nscales in any way okay but this feels\nlike a nice conversation not paying\nattention to how validating it may or\nmay not be it I just feel like it's nice\nto have a back-and-forth about things\nthat I don't frequently talk about so\nthere are a couple of different things\nhere and I don't know I so Iman I want\nto say if your game with it maybe we can\ndig into this more later just because I\ntend to need so the more complicated it\nis the more I want to be at a hundred\npercent and I don't know how long I can\nstay at a hundred percent because I\nthink this could be another like I can't\nthere's no way that you're gonna get\nthere's no way that I can put forward my\nbest self over the course of the next\nhour and a half that's okay\nand at the same time I think we can\ndefinitely start talking about it but I\njust so like there are a couple of\ndifferent dimensions here okay so the\nfirst is that\nand this is I don't mean this make this\nsound as invalidating is it is its gonna\ncome across but why do you care right\nlike what's your skin in the game like\nwhat is it about the drama and the\nthings that are said on Reddit and the\nthings that are said about you and not\nto your face that bother you\nthere's something about ego and identity\nand respect and whether that respect\ncomes from the outside or whether it\ncomes from the inside like your worth\nand we're on the axis of like within\nthem on and outside of them on it comes\nfrom mm-hmm and I think unfortunately\nlike you being Moroccan doesn't really\nhelp with this and like I know that\nbasically Thai for parents and Indian\nparents because it is like they do tell\nyou right Oh so-and-so is getting\nmarried right like oh and this is\nhappening this is happening this is\nhappening so we're kind of ingrained and\nyou're not gonna be Caucasian or\nHispanic or whatever it just depends on\nwhat kind of parents you are but\nculturally like at least South Asian\nEast Asian and sort of like Middle\nEastern cultures are very very big into\nimage and in that respect is something\nthat can be like measured with like a\nmeasuring stick right it's like not only\nis that person a doctor it's like they\ntell me which school he went to and like\nmy tariff I mean I tell my mom you know\nmy mom doesn't thankfully she doesn't\nmake that mistakes you didn't talk about\nme you're just great right so and and so\nI think the first thing is about like\nwhere your attachment to this whole\nissue so I think there's there's\nsalvation if you become unattached from\nit yeah yeah right so that's one option\nbut then there are a couple of other\nthings because I just don't think it's\nlike you know it's it's a shitty answer\nto say just care less so so like while I\nthink that that's true I don't think\nthat that's like sufficient or we're not\nanywhere near there yet because not\ncaring means that you have strengths\ncoming from in here and I just don't\nthink you have that mm-hmm and that kind\nof goes back yeah God so what we were\nsaying before which is my lack of time\nbeing able to develop a sort of identity\nthat's kind of how I've related the to\nwhich is just like the way to not care\nabout what people\nthink is just to like be confident\nenough in yourself absolutely right so\nthere's yeah so so I think the other\nthing is when we talk about\ndefensiveness like that's the ego right\nlike so when someone gets defensive\nthat's their ego activating that's them\nsense of like wanting to fight back and\nI think part of what you're running into\nis that you activate the egos of other\npeople because they know they did\nsomething wrong and then very few people\nhave the wherewithal to like recognize\nwhen their ego is active in that the\nwords that are coming out of their mouth\nor by definition\nwrong because their mind is butthurt and\nthe more butthurt you are the more\nincorrect things you're gonna think and\nthe more incorrect things you're gonna\nsay but that's not something that they\nteach us that when your ego is active\nthat's you being hurt and then like\nanything that comes afterward you know\nso my kid at 4:00 in the morning came\nand slept with me in our bed and then\nshe does this thing where she doesn't\nsleep like in line with us she either\nsleeps perpendicularly or she sleeps\ntopsy turvy and she just won't stay on a\npillow she just like once she just moves\naround and then she kicked me in the\nface at like 4:30 because she's just\nshe's like hungry and she's like not\nsleeping well and stuff and then like\nyou know I felt hurt and I wanted to\nsmack her and like you know I want to\nsmack her because you get kicked in the\nface by like you know an almost\nthree-year-old and she's actually like\nyeah it's a reaction and it's the hurt\nis gonna lead me to do things that are\nlike not good to do and I think that's\nwhat you're running up against is when\nyou hold someone accountable they're\ngonna feel hurt and they're gonna feel\ndefensive and they're gonna attack and\nthen you feel defensive because you're\nbeing attacked and you feel hurt so like\nhurt and offensiveness and ego all tied\ntogether and so then there's another\nissue here which is like how do you\nrelate to people can you actually become\nbetter voicing your feelings can you\nphrase things away in dms that and here\nI'm thinking calculated now it's like\nI'm sort of almost tapping my when I\nguide people who or when I talk to\npeople who have like problems with like\ncorporate boards like\nsay I'm working with CEO and like the\nboard doesn't like him and something's\ngoing on like that's what we're kind of\ngetting into how do you how do you write\nan email in a way that if someone\nforwards it cuz that's gonna happen\nright because it's on paper and really\nyeah it's like how do you write an email\nthat can't be taken out of context or\nprotects you from being taken out of\ncontext intersects the most Oh like to\nthe audience they don't consider that\nthe fact that if something were to be\nshown publicly I mean like depending on\nwhat it says that someone would have\nneeded to be extremely calculating and\nto some of them they would consider that\nlike being fake they would need to be\nvery calculating in order to have\nsomething be shown publicly and not\ncause any issue typically but then also\nthey want you to be like real and never\nshow any sign of like being calculating\nor strategic or what they would deem is\nlike disingenuous or fake but then\nthat's the very stuff that they accept\nor think is normal or like or think is\nacceptable do you kind of get where I'm\ncoming yeah I get I think I get where\nyou're coming from so Waterman sucks\nthat just sounds exhausting yeah like\nit's like there's so much work into like\neach thing that go like each word like\nso normal human beings get to talk yeah\nright like other people get to DM back\nand forth what are the [ __ ] they want\nbut you don't get to do that I just wish\nI could feel like\nI could be worthy of the benefit of the\ndoubt and I just feel like instead it's\nthe complete opposite it's like how can\nwe manufacture this to make it look like\nshe is some like devil succubus sting\nmonster that is trying to kill people I\ndon't know what happened to mom can you\ncan you tell me what happened so many\nthings have happened Nick one there was\nthis one like for example this one video\nthat went kind of viral where someone\nwas like talking about like the dark\nside of pokey maid and saying oh she's\nactually a really bad person because of\nlike this and not and they took a lot of\nclips from my stream and it's amazing\nwhat like ominous music and someone\ndelivering lines very well will say\nprior to very specific cut up clips with\nno context not to say that I am perfect\nor I go about things in a perfect way\nbut it definitely made me look very bad\nand also just like that in combination\nwith scandals about things that are like\nnot in my opinion like super super\nimportant so things like that will occur\nand then that will make me feel like oh\nevery little thing that I say can be\nlike used against me or clipped out of\ncontext or whatever it is and like I am\nnot worthy of any sort of benefit of the\ndoubt and then the cherry on top is that\nalmost any time someone has created a\nmassive issue like that for me in my\nlife at some point or other they slide\nin the DMS with a massive apology like\nthat video even though it amassed I\nthink millions of views has now been\ndeleted because the guy himself felt\nlike the video like didn't really make\nsense it wasn't very fair to me and you\nknow what that doesn't\ndelete the hundreds of thousands of\nshitty things that people have sent to\nme said about me thought about me\nor the way in which it has jaded me so\nyeah that easy Lorena\nI'm leaking why are you leaking what's\nwhat's coming out what's leaking\nyes I'm you just like pent up feelings\nand regards a lot I don't know what what\nfeelings sadness it's like I pity myself\nyou pity yourself what about you as\npitiable I don't know are you not saying\nbecause you don't want to provide people\nwith ammo or do you really not know oh I\nguess just like I want to say my\nsituation but it has a lot of upsides as\nwell so see there it is again yeah there\nit is the pens in this hand\nit should be in this hand it's so I mean\nreally like I asked that question about\nammo for a reason because I think what\nyou feel you do not feel as fair to say\nI don't feel like anything is fair to\nsay yeah that's you Shing him on into\nthe closet right and now we're kind of\nat a dangerous crossroads because like\nwhat you're telling me is actually true\nthis isn't in your head and that's why\nthe [ __ ] is complicated because if you\ndo talk about how you actually feel\npeople will crucify you they're waiting\nthey're out there what is this [ __ ]\ncomplaining about alright or they'll use\nthe c-word yeah and I think it's\ninteresting I remember first sort of\nencountering this with dev and mash and\nsort of like we were talking about why\npeople are toxic and and I think like\nyou know what I what I told him and and\nwhat I still think I kind of believe\nbecause I remember who I used to hate\nright because like I've felt that do I\nmean being 25 years old and you know\nhave nothing but 80 medical school\nrejection letters to show for what\nyou've done in life is not like it's not\nit's like a dark place to be right not\nhaving a job being supported by mommy\nand daddy and you know like not even\nlike not even Kentucky not even helping\npeople like Matt contributing like doing\nnothing and I think this this is why I\nlike mental health is a problem because\nlike these people don't have it like\nthese people their hatred doesn't come\nfrom evil right it's like the Hydra like\nthe Hydra acts like depending on how you\ntreat it\nI think the crazy thing is that I think\nthose people are like they're hurting\nand they don't know what to do with that\nit's like they're like children like if\nyou look at children of a like who are\nabused like and there was a great stream\nwith LLS about this where he was kind of\ntalking about like he used to act out\nand be a bad kid and like no no one ever\nasked a lie mm-hmm no one ever like\nwondered like they just punished him\nbecause he did things that he wasn't\nsupposed to no one ever asks why I know\nthese people who hate you they so with\nDevin's case I think what what happened\nis like what I hate the most night even\nstill life I feel it today when I see\nsomeone doing something that I feel like\nI'm capable of but haven't done it\ninfuriates me when someone's better than\nme and they do something that's fine\nbecause they're better than me but when\nsomeone's not better than me and they do\nsomething that I could have done except\nI didn't do it and they did do it boy\ndoes that make me live it because then I\ndon't have an excuse right then my\nweaknesses become exposed and then like\nthat's just too painful I don't know how\nto sit with that pain we don't know how\nto sit with pain no one ever teaches us\nand then they attack actually so often\nwhen I see people that are like\nobsessively attacking me I I just I mean\nthere are many emotions but a big part\nof me just like wants to reach out are\nyou okay what's wrong\nyeah why are you being this way and then\nI realize if I do that they'll probably\njust take it as an opportunity to just\nsay where's things directly to me or\nscreenshotted or do whatever sure so\nit's become sad oh you know I mean not\nto go into the Lions Den but like if\nthat happens again send them my way I\nwould love to talk to Sirius I told the\nsame thing to Devin like these people\ndon't show up\n[ __ ] infuriates me I know they're\nreal toxic as we've had to in cells come\non stream there weren't real insults\nwe had a guy with a [ __ ] wife who he\nwas like he's like a normal dude it's\nlike where's the fucked-up-ness like\ngive me give me like gimme give me the\nworst part like I want the drags right\nbecause they deserve a spot too mm-hmm\nand we need to understand that we need\nto help them make any send them my way\nokay I'll link them here yeah I'm\nserious like like the guy who made that\nvideo and so I think there's a couple of\nother things that I just want to say\nbecause I it's complicated there's so\nmany threads here there's something so\ndevastating about getting an apology in\nprivate I can't tell you the amount of\ntimes and in the moment it feels nice\nand then long-term I realize wait this\nperson got off scot-free\nand the amount of resentment is\nsomething like do you accept their\napology what else am I gonna do I mean I\nvery much appreciate it and I think it\ntakes some sort of courage to do that\ntoo but it like in the moment I don't\nrealize what they would never apologize\npublicly yeah so you know what else am I\ngonna do like that comes back to the\nparma right like\nsometimes it's okay to say I don't\nforgive you you don't have to like no\none is entitled to forgiveness something\nlike somewhere along the way we thought\nthat people were entitled to forgiveness\nthat's not how it works I think it's\nmore so like I expect forgiving them -\nor like accepting the apology - then\nmake that situation go away but now I've\nrealized no there is still some\nresentment within me so then that that\nforgiveness is fake you do it because\nyou're supposed to do it you do it\nbecause we've been trained to say it's\nokay when someone apologizes right and\nwe do it all the time and like yeah it's\na real problem like no one is entitled\nto forgiveness like I know that this\nplace is supposed to be positive but I\nreally think that oh man does positivity\ninfuriate me because it's so [ __ ]\ndishonest sometimes yeah I mean to be\nfair really not intentionally like all\nthose times I really thought oh they\napologize this is very nice okay let's\nall move on with our lives yeah so I\nthink I think there's so I think you're\nhalfway there so I think I think\nforgiving is good but I think it's gotta\nlike be actual forgiveness right so I\nthink that the problem isn't that you're\nforgiving the problem is that you're not\nsaying the rest of it the problem is is\nyou saying because it's kind of you know\nbecause they apologized and then and\nthen you said something really brilliant\nwhich is like it doesn't change the fact\nthat there were hundreds of thousands of\nmessages thoughts like it doesn't change\nthe damage it doesn't undo the damage\nand somewhere along the way we started\nbelieving that an apology undoes the\ndamage like if I'm driving down the\nstreet and I'm walking down the street\nwith one of my kids and the drunk driver\ndrives by and like you know runs over my\nchild and kills them heaven forbid you\nknow I hope that doesn't happen knock on\nwood\nand then that person comes to me and\nsays I'm sorry and then I say I forgive\nyou it doesn't change the fact that you\nknow there's such a damage has been done\nan apology does not wipe away the damage\nand the issue here I'm on is that like I\nthink that somewhere along the way we\nstarted believing that forgiving wipes\naway the damage because true forgiveness\nis part of that mourning is part of that\nacceptance but even then I don't think\nthat anyone is owed like your own and\nI'm sorry but you're not they're not\nowed mercy from you and somewhere along\nthe way like you decided that you were a\ngood person and this is what a good\nperson does but like I think that's your\nproblem like you do you deserve an\napology absolutely do they deserve your\nforgiveness absolutely not\nI don't really know how else to go about\nit yeah that's tricky right because\nwe're not talking stuff right I mean I\nthink it starts with speaking your truth\nand and that too is like in the dm's and\nyou can say like I appreciate your\napology but like I don't know that the\ndamage you've done like has been fixed\nright I'm\nwhy'd you feel remorse in that situation\npeople will just be defensive and be\nlike wow this isn't good enough for you\nand I'm not turn around back yeah I\ntried to apologize but she was a total\n[ __ ] about it you know it's there's no\nway that so you can't win right so and\nthis is this is where I think the\nbiggest problem this kind of comes back\nto the beginning of detachment is that\nyou're playing a game where someone else\nyou're playing a game that like someone\nelse determines who wins and who loses\nmm-hmm like this is why you feel\npowerless because you're playing a game\nwhere like no matter what you say\nsomeone else can do something with it\nand that's exactly the [ __ ] point\nthat's where detachment comes from the\ngame is rigged and yet we continue to\nplay it true we put our feelings in our\nlives in our sense of self into the\nhands of others and then we [ __ ] and\nwhine but it feels like that's such like\nan inherent part of the job it isn't in\nhere it's not just a part of the job my\nfriend it's a part of life yeah every\ntime you like when you're year three you\nin the third grade and you do your math\nhomework and you like get a grade back\nlike that's you giving power to the\nworld like at some point very very\nquickly it goes about it moves away from\nlearning to grades happens so fast no\none gives a [ __ ] about learning everyone\ngives a [ __ ] about grades it's about the\noutcome it's about the perception mm-hmm\nlike when when people talk about\nMoroccan doctors they say like oh this\nperson is a doctor like everyone talks\nabout that person like they're a doctor\nlike no one talks about the people that\nthey sing right and live it's like\nthere's value that a doctor is greater\nthan other human beings it's like it's\nnot greater than other human beings\nthey're just people everyone's just\npeople everyone does their part but we\nelevate some and it's not about the\nactual thing in its\nperception of the thing or the opinions\nof others and I mean oh you know I think\nlike you're just you're playing a game\nlike in that you feel powerless because\nyou can't wait like how do you win\nmm-hmm\nand this is a party that's really really\nfaking throwing whatever you want under\nthe bus but somehow making it out\nlooking nice but I don't think that is\nthe way I would be okay with winning\nyeah that's not right I'm just stuck\nsuffering yeah no you don't need to stop\ncaring no you don't need to do that good\nside what was that what is that what\ndoes that tell me think for a second\nyou know maybe I don't need to do\nanything that's exactly right\nnow almost let it slip away you don't\nneed to detach you need to do absolutely\nnothing just sit with your suffering let\nhim on out of the closet that's the sign\nyou almost let it slip away almost you\ndon't need to do anything because you're\nperfect\nright I mean like the rest of the world\nlike haters gonna hate man right we've\nbeen saying it for I don't know I don't\nknow yeah satchel you don't need to do\nanything you know like if like here's\nthe thing so now we're gonna wrap up\nokay I'll teach you to meditate if you\nwant but you are what you are him on and\nI think part of I mean my understanding\nis that you're you know for the most\npart pretty authentic and I don't blame\nyou if you want but and if you think\nabout it like you know what what's also\nbeen responsible for like bringing you\nto where you are is like is actually you\nit's not it's not you playing the game\nand and so you you you are perfect and\nwhat you give to twitch is actually like\nwhat most of twitch loves and then like\nwhat some people do is they hate what\nyou did because it's authentic it's like\nwe hate the person who does the thing\nthat we're capable of and we don't do\nlike the problem is that like you're a\ngenerally positive person people [ __ ]\nhate that they hate that because they're\nlike I tried to be a positive person and\nI didn't end up as twitch royalty like\nthat's not fair and then they try to\ntear you down but you you can just be\nwhat you are and like like that's what\nyou are and like people love you for it\napparently you know I think you're\nawesome and I don't know if you've been\nfaking it you're doing this for you know\nif you're farming views or whatever I\nhave no idea like if I tried man I feel\nlike if I was faking things I should be\ndoing a way better job I think I think I\nthink yeah I don't and I think the thing\nis if you really really stop and you\nlook the world loves you for who you are\nlike I'm serious it's not it's not I\nknow I say positive sounding [ __ ] but\nI'm not trying to say positive sound you\nshould I'm just saying like can you get\nto where you are by being who\nnot or by being who you are cuz it's way\nharder to be who you're not than it is\nto be who you are I don't think you can\nget to where you are by being fake fake\nhere and there sure but like your true\ncolors eventually show up\nI mean twitch is really good at sniffing\nout false in this vitami yeah I mean\nwhen you dream for so many hours yeah\nyeah you\nI mean so I mean I think at the end of\nthe day you're spot-on it sits in that\nsigh and don't lose that in that moment\nyou understood like in that moment you\nunderstood because like maybe I just\ndon't need to do anything here\nabsolutely and then then that thing\ncomes up and so I know you should do\nthis and you shouldn't do this and you\nshould do this no don't do anything just\nbe yourself [ __ ] slack off for a day\nor two and the people are gonna hate you\nbecause you you spoke out of turn you're\nlike yeah well no yeah exactly\nand this is the cool thing right this is\nthe cool thing is when you say oops\nwhat is the hydrogen like absolutely\nit's really cool like it's really really\ncool like people come on here and air\ntheir dirty laundry over and over and\nover again and like what do they get\nthey get hugs yeah I do really love that\naspect when people see the humanity in\nyou yeah like take a chance to see the\nhumanity in yourself\nlast thoughts questions I feel like I'm\nwiped oh no my eyeballs are wiped this\nis very very nice I have you know see\ndifferent therapists and stuff but I've\nnever really got into this aspect of it\nespecially in regards to my family or\nwith someone who like understands the\nspace you know how often are you gonna\nfind a therapist that streams just about\nnever and then you have to go into\ntrying to explain this beast of a thing\nso it was very nice talking to someone\nwho who gets it\nwell you're very welcome it was an\nabsolute pleasure from I mean I love\ntalking to new people it's make you feel\nlike that's a you people I mean I I love\ntalking to ya but you know I I have\noddly enough I I think the reason I say\nyou people is because I identify more\nwith the audience than the streamer I\nview myself as twitch chat personified\non stream as opposed to an actual stream\nwork I really don't think about myself\nanyway maybe there's a lesson somewhere\nin there but my brain is too fried to to\ntease it apart all right you're frying\nyour brain no no I mean I think it's\ngood like you know I I like I like fried\nfood from you know it's just I i I've\ncome to acknowledge my limits but yeah I\nreally appreciate what you've done I you\nknow Iman just to be honest I'm I found\nmyself to be a little bit surprised but\nI guess I shouldn't be because you know\nhaving watched her scream a couple of\ntimes I'm I never realized you were\nhanging on to so much and I feel sad\nthat you've been hanging on to it and I\ndon't think you deserve that I think you\ndeserve to be able to have fun and I\ndeserve I think you deserve to be more\nfully who you show us I want to think\nthe same thing\nand feel deserving of that well said see\nthat's a statement of where you are\nright you didn't say I should you said I\nwant to it's an acknowledgement that\nyou're not capable with that that's\nactually step forward so it makes me\nvery happy to hear you say that\ndo you want to meditate or we just kind\nof are we done what do you think oh\nabsolutely\nhow about you just tell me how no no\nwe're going to do have any no we're\ngonna I should be able to express myself\nwithout giving in to that feeling\nvoguing guilt or anything on your part\nno shoulds allowed yeah\n[Music]\nokay I'm not quite sure if this I don't\nlet me let me just think for a second I\ntry to tailor people's the meditation\nthat I teach teach to both be\nintroductory and also to apply to like\nwhat people are dealing with I'm tempted\nto teach you chanting but I want you to\ndo something particular with chanting if\nthat's okay you've ever chanted before\nI'm chanting heard of this done this\nokay all right okay all right so home\nchanting is home is composed of three\nsyllables ah ooh and mmm okay so what\nI'm gonna do is I'm gonna chant over the\ncourse of one breath start with ah go\nthrough ooh and end up with hmm\nand so just listen okay\nyou\nand at home should be listening to\n[Music]\ngot it I heard the ah I don't know if\nyou lagged out oh i lagged out or maybe\nit's not transmitting okay let's try\nagain\n[Music]\ndid you catch that or no I still only\nheard the ah oh [ __ ] okay\nwell there it goes that it's just I\ncannot imagine okay so let me do the ooh\nand let me do and maybe discord actually\nI'm not sure if it's going on let me\ncheck\nlet's see what people are saying it's\nthe gate on this chord I thought so yeah\nso I think I think they can hear it\nbut let me see if come on alright so\nwe're just not going to worry about that\noh okay I'm okay yeah I can't eat I'm\ndoing this okay attention okay so I'm\ngonna it's it's so I'll do the oh so\nactually you can do it this way too so\nwe'll do three separates\nooh\n[Music]\nJr those I turned on your stream and I\nheard it they okay so ah over the course\nof one breath okay we're gonna do five\nrounds - let's do seven rounds I'm a\ndropout just because my throat is\nscratchy when I talk too much\num chanting is argh and Aman I want you\nto pay attention to two things the first\nis that chanting is about vibration not\nabout sound so you're gonna feel kind of\nanxious and maybe weird or whatever I\ndon't know if you have any like history\nof performing or whatever but it's fine\nto feel those things but focus on the\nvibration and specifically try to pay\nattention to where do you feel vibration\nand it may change with different\nsyllables and really just try to kind of\ngo into that vibration and the last\nthing that I'm going to ask you to do is\nafter the seventh round after the\nseventh round I want you to pay\nattention to like what you feel on the\ninside and then try to tell me so think\nabout it and then try to notice what's\nwrong if there's something inside you\nthat's like not right right so just just\nfeel what you are and try to figure out\ndoes anything about this feel wrong like\nis any anything incomplete should is\nthere should somewhere in what you feel\nafter the practice okay all right so so\ntake a deep breath in so close your eyes\ndeep breath in\nand begin\n[Music]\n[Laughter]\nbig deep breath again\n[Music]\nmore energy\n[Music]\ngood take a second in and out I now will\nbegin begin again just like that\n[Music]\n[Laughter]\nbeautiful focus on the vibration\n[Laughter]\n[Music]\ngood two more make them count\n[Music]\ntake a breath just a breath and down\nlast one long deep calm and full\n[Music]\n[Laughter]\n[Music]\neyes closed sit with it\nand now to try to find what's vlog what\ndo you feel you can answer if you do you\nfeel like something like how do you feel\nnow I feel like especially near the end\nof like every time we would do it like\nmy exhaustion came through yeah\nbut I feel like um it was nice to kind\nof get into it because it feels like a\nmental reset yeah so I think you you got\nto do something like this and if the\nexhaustion is coming through that's\nreally good it's not the exhaustion\ncoming through it's the exhaustion\ncoming up because I'm on you're very\ntired you're very very tired stop saying\nstuff this can make me cry I mean I'm\nI'm sorry but you know and I think you\ndon't let yourself you don't let\nyourself sit down\nyou don't like other people get to take\na break but you don't ensure there's a\npart of that that's like streaming and\nbusiness and stuff like that but I'm not\ntalking about business I'm talking about\nup here and so you've got to let\nyourself feel that and and let it\nbecause you don't let yourself be tired\nand that's not fair sorry back to square\none good I mean so so what I tell people\nis when they meditate what comes up is\nwhat needs to come up because meditation\nis about relieving the pressure on your\nmind and when you when you create less\npressure so if I depressurize a chamber\nright and I reduce the pressure then it\nbecomes closer to a vacuum and when you\nhave a vacuum more stuff can come in so\nlike there's stuff in you that you've\nwalled off and shut off in the closet\nthat when you meditate you know each\nround of meditation like towards the end\nas you enter quietness and the pressure\nand drops from the chanting you this\nthing starts to come up I mean this is\nwhy I think chanting is a good technique\nfor you because you're gonna you can't\nsit there you're not ready to sit there\nyou're not ready for the closet to be\nopen you're not ready for that glass\nwall with the pile of dishes on the\nother side you're not ready for the wall\nto come down what you want to do is take\na peek inside and each round you chant\nyou peek inside you peek inside\nyou peek inside it's like there's\nthere's you know there's a frightened\nAman who thinks that there's a monster\nin the closet and if I open the door\nshe's gonna freak the [ __ ] out but if I\npeek inside I'm gonna just look real\nquick I'm gonna shut it right away is\nthat okay\nI opened a new shine I hope I shut and I\ndo that a couple of times then like\neventually like Iman is gonna be okay\nwith me like like really looking inside\nand then then like maybe like looking\nand be like hey do you want to just peek\nreal quick and then you have to let\nyourself be comfortable with that that\nexhaustion and let it come up and yeah\nso I hope that helps I think you're\nawesome I I do I do genuinely think\nyou're perfect but not in like a twitch\nroyalty soared away like in a you know\nbroken and normal human sort of way yeah\nand and I think we're all we're all\nwhere we need to be and and sometimes\nwhere we are or not sometimes usually\nit's painful and I'm sorry to say this\nto a chat but you can you can be a\npopular streamer and it doesn't mean\nthat you don't have feelings like that's\nwhat we think right and we think that oh\nif I once I do this if I graduated from\ncollege once I find a girlfriend I\nhadn't thought of all these different\nthings once I do this then I'll be happy\nonce this'll happens then I'll be happy\nthe part of the story that I don't tell\npeople is that I actually got happy\nbefore I started in that school like my\ntransformation happened before and then\neverything after that has been like\nimmaterial in some way I stopped playing\na rigged game I remember a moment in\nmeditation where I just started I didn't\nused to cry very much or like I hadn't\ncried like a decade and then there was a\nmoment meditation where I just wept and\nwept and wept and it was kind of like\nyou know the catharsis that sometimes\nhappens here I had this catharsis where\nI realized like I'm not any of the\nthings that I wanted to be and that I\nshouldn't be and I'm just not like I\njust don't live up to that standard and\nI just fully accepted that in\nit was okay that like I like looked\naround as I go [ __ ] I'm still here like\nI don't need to be any of those things\nlike I'm just what I am and like it's\ngonna be like it was it was before\ndeciding to apply for the third time and\nand so it was that the second it was the\nsecond after the second year I applied\nto med school and didn't get
