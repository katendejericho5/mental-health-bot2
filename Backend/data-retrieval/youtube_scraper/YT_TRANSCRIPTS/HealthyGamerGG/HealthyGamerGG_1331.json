    "transcript": "yeah man thanks for coming on so can you\ntell me a little bit about you know is\nthere something in particular you want\nto talk about today or something that\nwould be hey we have the same headset oh\nreally oh the sign Houser yes yeah it's\nreally comfortable I like it a lot yeah\nit's good um you know I was just gonna\nsay tell me a little bit about you know\nhow can be helpful and and what you want\nto talk about today um so I guess the\ntopic was supposed to be like gaming\nburnout okay um so I guess a little bit\nabout my background is that I'm from\nHawaii after I graduated high school I\nworked for my dad as an intern for a\nyear and then I got fired cuz you know I\ndidn't I didn't want to do it I got\nlucky with the game League of Legends\nand I got flown out a free trip to\nSweden and then I started my league pro\ncareer by joining well going to the TSM\nhouse and then I played pro for like\nfive years and then I've played league\nfor like ten years and I've had like you\nknow ups and downs and I get into\ndetails as we talked about wow so you're\na pro league player um I used to be used\nto be okay yeah so I've I haven't been\npro for like four years now three years\naround that time yeah I worked with a\nfair number of people who were kind of\ntransitioning out of being pro yeah I'm\nLeague overwatch mostly a little bit of\ncsgo a little bit of Rainbow six but\nyeah so tell me a little bit about yeah\nso when you said gaming burnout what do\nyou mean by that um it's just one of\nthose things where you play the game\nsame game for a long time and you don't\nwant to play it as much but then your\nfans want you to play it and it also\nbrings you income so instead of doing it\nfor fun it becomes your job because\ngoing from casual to pro\nyeah I don't I don't see how else to say\nit I feel like that's common knowledge\nat this point yeah so you feel like you\nhave to play the game um there was a\ntime yeah that I felt like I had to play\nthe game and I thought about it for\nyears on end that you know would I be\nokay without it should I not play it for\nthe good of my mental health because\nplaying it was hurting me because uh so\nwhen you play the same game\nthat's a controlled by the developers\nwhere they control every patch how the\ngame has changed like whatever they want\nto do sometimes they make changes that\nare bad and a riot is always accompany\nabout changing and so whether it's good\nor worse some of the changes they've\nmade have made it the experience much\nless enjoyable like what at this\nso in League of Legends there's this\nthing called funneling and what that is\nis that instead of having a standard\ngame of you know five people versus five\npeople like there's one person top\nmiddle two people bottom and one that\ngoes around the map yeah jungle and so\ninstead of having that standard thing\nthere's a role called support which is\nthey basically you know they have their\nbottom they support their other laner\nthey wrote their job is to help them get\nas strong as possible now instead of\njust having one support in the game the\nconcept of funneling is there's two\nsupports and what will happen is\nthere'll be another support in a and a\nLane where they're by themselves and\ninstead of becoming someone strong their\ngoal is to make someone who is roam roam\nroaming around strong and the cod so the\nconcept is like okay cool that's their\nthat's their strategy but it's a very\nstraightforward and like hard to counter\nstrategy if you make mistakes again it's\nreally unique and it it\nwhat it does is it enables that one\nperson to hard carry and it's very\nunfund to play against because they\ndon't even have to play it perfectly but\neven if you play it perfectly you can\nstill lose the unsay it's a very common\ncheese ela boosting strategy and because\nI've played the game for so long there\nare some games where I feel like I\nplayed it perfectly and I'll still lose\nwhich will happen either way but I felt\neven more so against the strategy and\nthat was just one of the many things\nthat just turned me off from playing the\ngame and just made me like you know\nplease my mind are you kind of saying\nthat it lowered the skill ceiling of the\ngame to sort of have a strategy that\njust was kind of lopsided and yeah so um\nit lowered the skill ceiling not because\nof the person only getting all the farm\nbut because of the person who's giving\nthem all that instead of playing the\ngame normally and you know getting\nstronger like your skills tested you\ndon't have to you can literally put\nanyone in that position of giving the\nfarm to that person and all they would\nhave to do is just they wouldn't have to\nfocus on macro at all they just have to\nhelp that person and it's it\nconsiderably lowers the skill ceiling\nbecause usually you'd have a skilled\nplayer in this role because they're\nthey're considered a carry but instead\nthey're given the support role which is\nI'm not trying to say support is easier\nthan caring but when you don't have to\nfocus on blasts hitting which is what\ngives you money in the game I'm a boom\nboom and I'm not now much of a blower\nokay I just so I'm with like ADC and\ncarrying and in the mid and jungle one\noh yeah basically they you just turned\ntheir brain off and just give all the\ngold to the jungler yeah so just as a\nreference for how much of a Boomer and\nhow little of a boomerang I am I've\nstarted playing dota probably like let\nme think about this 14 years ago okay\nthen you know more than enough so back\nwhen when you know I was I was there\nwhen MOBAs were born boy yeah me too so\nokay so I see so it seems like some of\nthe changes that the developers make\nhave it really kind of taken some of the\njoy out of the game for you yeah it's\nit's kind of like it's not completely\ntheir fault because it's the player base\nthat also abuses it so yeah sure but I\nmean isn't isn't the game developer\nresponsible for creating the setting\nthat then players are gonna abuse or not\nabuse yeah you know I think players are\ngonna be pieces of [ __ ] right you're\ngonna cheese they're gonna cheese\nwhatever they can\nyeah for sure I mean and I think that's\nwhy like good developers are so\nimportant because they're gonna create\nthe setting through which you know\nthat's gonna dictate a certain kind of\nbehavior yeah I want to say it's hard\nfor them to balance it because it's such\na there's so many champions in the game\nbut I guess what really irritated me as\na pro player is that they would hold\nthese riots summit me these these player\nsummit meetings where pro players have\ncome in and pro players that give their\nadvice and and a lot of players that\nplay the game a lot have their concerns\nbut there's also like the lower level of\nplay where people have their concerns\nbecause what works and lower skill level\ngames doesn't always work at high and\nvice versa and so they would hold these\nwe would have these meetings where like\nwe could give them feedback and there's\nsome things that were clearly broken and\na lot of the time it wasn't listened to\nand that's what frustrated me because\nit's like why why am I going to this\nit's not even like being considered\nbecause it just gets written off by\ncertain people in the balance team sand\nup okay go ahead yes all right guys\noh and uh a lot of people have expressed\nlike similar opinions and I just feel\nlike there's some people in the balance\nteam that are actually just smoking weed\nor getting in a hot ox and just be like\nwhat if we did this and that's how\nstrongly I feel about it\nyeah so let me just see if I'm hearing\nyou I'm kind of getting the sense that\nso I just just\nI've been jotting a couple things down\nas you've been talking so this is just\nliterally the words that I wrote down\nand let me know if these kind of feel\nright so feeling forced to play in a\nparticular way being forced to play a\nparticular game for money for fans kind\nof struggling with the sense of illusion\nof choice where in theory you could stop\nin theory they'll change the game in a\ndifferent way but that you're kind of\nforced what I'm getting from you is sort\nof a sense of being forced into\nsomething yeah it's kind of like the\nfeeling of let's say you post on Twitter\nevery day for the idea of getting likes\ngetting it popular and like oh yeah I\nfeel good so many people like my tweet\nand sometimes you tweet about stuff and\npeople are like who cares shut up but\nit's like your Twitter account so it's\nkind of its kind of like that - yeah so\ncan you say you said that sometimes wall\nhurts you use the Oh a lot can you tell\nme what you meant by that sorry if I\ndidn't give you enough second um it's\nit's been a double-edged sword for me\nbecause it's obviously created a career\nfor being everything and putting me\nwhere I am today but uh so there are\nmany ways of explaining of how it hurts\nme for\nwhen we were talking about the changes\nwhile I was a pro there's the concepts\nof two verse wanting the top planar so\nthey would switch bottom in top and that\nwas a meta that was a meta they were\nconstantly trying to fix for like three\nyears and that's something that hurt me\nwhen the jungler gang stuff\nyou're constantly yeah I'm a I'm a top\nplayer usually the top player top laners\nhave to deal with most of the harassment\nthroughout the game because for junglers\nthey I just have to you know farm creeps\nand worry about the enemy jungler the\nmid laners they have a short lane so\nthey don't get punished as hard top\nminers have the long Lane so there's\nmore risk to me bottom liners have their\nsupport but top laners were left all\nalone\nwe're basically left all alone and we're\nforced to pick characters that will\nallow us to survive drift less resources\nbut at the same time you're also dealing\nwith the enemy top laner where if he\nabuses that the higher level play it\ngoes the harder it is so sure I just\nthere's just so many factors and things\nthat I don't want to get too far into it\nand and so if we think about gaming\nburnout is it sort of this idea of being\nforced to play in a particular way being\nforced to play a game that the meta has\nchanged away from what you want it to be\nbeing forced to play League of Legends\nfor your financial well-being for the\npeople that have supported you feeling\nkind of an you bet you owe them or that\nyou know they've supported you so that\nyou should give them what they want is\nthat what you mean by burnout No\nthat's just me expressing my pain I\nguess what burnout really is is that\nI've played league of legends for like\n12 hours a day for four five to six\nyears doing my pro career and um I guess\nwhat the burnout is really comes from is\nnot only playing it so much and grinding\nit so much but I guess what it comes\nfrom is not knowing how to take a break\nI think that's what really creates it\nfor me okay buzz so I pardon me which\niris if I'm a bit confused so you said\nduring your pro career so when was was\nthat some time ago or as are we talking\nabout now are we talking about gaming\nBurma burnout a while ago um it was a\nwhile ago and I think I'm still kind of\nburnt out today as a gamer because I've\nplayed games every day of my life\nbasically so what is the burnout that\nyou so like let's just think about that\nright so that sounds kind of confusing\nto me and I'm gonna question your\nformulation of it so it makes absolute\nsense and I've dealt a lot with pro\ngamer burnout and streamer burnout and\nthings like that actually my day job I'm\na burnout specialist so do a lot of\nstuff work would burn out with like\nInvestment Banking with entrepreneurs\nwith physicians you know these you know\nthere's like the 40-hour Work Week and\nthe funny thing is that like many\nphysicians just find that to be\npreposterous so like in residency the\nexpectation is that you work 80 hours a\nweek and the residency is what you do\nafter med school when you actually learn\nhow to be a doctor and so you have the\nthe national medical accreditation\ninstitution which is called the ACGME\nand they basically had to pass a law\nthat said that you can't work your\nresidents more than 80 hours a week on\naverage so what that means is that like\nwhat what residency programs do is\nthey'll have some weeks where people\nwill work like a hundred hours a week\nand then they'll have like a research\nblock where they were supposed to be\nworking like 50 hours a week\nand and it ends up like people work 80\n90 100 hour weeks depending on whether\nyou're a surgeon or psychiatrist or you\nknow it just depends on what you do and\nso the you know it's strange because\nlike in some you know you're kind of\nsaying that 12 hours five to six days a\nweek is between 60 and 72 hours of work\na week and oh no I'm talking like seven\ndays a week\nsee yeah it's big I don't have like a\nspecific number but it the lifestyle was\nwake up play all day sleep right so so\nthat that is like I think often times if\nit may have been more than 12 hours\nright so like it may have been eight or\nsixteen and I think we should talk about\nthat lifestyle because that's a\nlifestyle that you don't have to be a\npro gamer to do it right wake up start\nwith YouTube switch to some gaming watch\na little bit of twitch go back to gaming\nback to a little bit of youtube learn\nsomething philosophical on YouTube for a\nlittle while you know pull out your\nswitch in bed browse Reddit and then\nsleep it's like a it's like a full day\nso we can talk about that lifestyle I'm\nsorry did you want to say something okay\nyeah that's the idea of it but it's\nharder in a way because you're competing\nat the top level so there's just more\nstress involved sure instead of instead\nof it sounding like something were you\nyou know it's just the casual lifestyle\nit's very much more stressful because um\nyou live with other people on your team\nand you you deal with each other because\nof the gaming house such and such and\nyou're just all trying to figure out how\nto win yeah so if you want to we can\ntalk about that because I have some\nexperience doing consulting for\nprofessional organizations for like\nphysical sports and eSports and I don't\nknow where people got the idea that\ntwelve hours a day seven days a week\nmakes you a better player than ten hours\na day six days a week right so like\nthere's this huge assumption in the\nworld of eSports that the more you play\nthe better you get and that the harder\nyou grind the more you perform I don't\nknow that that's\nactually the case what you thinking I\nthink it really depends cuz I I can't\nsay that I've seen players who've played\nlike there's a Korean player we played\nagainst and he was late to scrims cuz he\nwould just be playing all night all day\nhe'd sleep for like four hours and just\nplay for the rest of the day I guess the\nthe key word here is being efficient\nabout the time he put in yeah and also\nalso efficiently resting yeah I\ncompletely agree and and so some of the\nconsulting work that I've done has been\naround you know even like having people\non the same pro team talk about their\nfeelings with each other because a lot\nof times people get frustrated and upset\nwith each other and that like ultimately\nthe more frustrated and upset you are\nwith your teammates the harder it is to\nhit a flow state and the one thing that\nI've heard time and time again whether\nit's with working with NFL players or\noverwatch athletes is like getting into\nthe flow state is what wins you games\nand the more you can stay in the flow\nstate it's it's being able if you're in\na best-of-five like losing one game and\nbeing able to forget about that and\nfocus on the second game completely\nindependent of whether your tournament\nlife is on the line or not it's just\nplaying the best game you can play and I\nthink a lot of that has way more to do\nwith not just it's just not the number\nof hours you put in it's about being the\nbest you it's like you said like kind of\nusing your time efficiently making sure\nyou and your team are harmonious like if\nyou guys lose a game like are you guys\nblaming or is everyone blaming the top\nlaner because they to view one top and\ntheir ADC got fed and then they lost or\ndo they recognize that the reason that\nthe ADC got fat is because you didn't\nhave enough support and and are you guys\nplaying to win are you guys playing to\nlike you no blame each other so I think\nthere's a lot in in the realm of eSports\nthat I think is actually in its infancy\nand if you look at organizational\npsychology and in different\norganizations like I forget what Ray\nDalio is there's a hedge fund manager\nnamed Ray Dalio and he he wrote an\nexcellent book called principles and he\nruns one of the most successful\nruns in the world and just kind of\ntalking a little bit about like how he\nruns his company and I think there are a\nlot of ways to run organizations that\ncan improve efficiency and eSports is\njust really really behind and you get\nguys that are former pro players that\nknow the game really well but really\nhave no background in organizational\nbehavior or management or anything like\nthat anyway now I'm granting but um but\nyou know dyrus let me let me toss\nsomething out so like I so are you burnt\nout today because you were a pro five to\nsix years ago like why are you burnt out\ntoday\nso a few months ago\nI took a I decided to completely stop\nstreaming for three months\nlike just completely stop to see if I\ncould feel better or get better and I\ndid feel better about things but I\ndidn't feel like it made too much of a\ndifference basically like I like I said\nbefore my life as I wake up I eat I\nstream and I sleep but I also have a\nhave a girlfriend so their girlfriends\nin between also and so it started to\nbecome where I need to manage my time to\nthe point where I can at least do my\neveryday adult responsibilities and I\nthink one of the reasons why I feel\nburnt out is cuz since I've played so\nmuch games it's really hard to find a\ngame that's as fun as the time I enjoyed\nLeague of Legends like I'll enjoy some\ngames for a few days but a lot of the\ntime and this year and you'll hear a lot\nof people that play games say this is\nlike oh man what what games do I play\nthere's no good fun games at play man I\ncan't wait for a new game to come out so\nI can play that and you play it and it\nonly lasts so long and the you just feel\na lot of emptiness because you don't\nhave a game to get addicted to now for\ntoday specifically the game valor end is\nout so that's what I'm currently\naddicted to right now and\n[Music]\nhow do you like that it's just a cycle I\nlove the game I think the only time I\nfelt discomfort in the game is when they\nthey changed the headshot sound and when\nyou shot them a head is like there's\nlike a mute like a sound like you\nplaying like a music counts ound keep\nplaying and then like I forget whatever\nsound but they changed it to like this\nloud plate crunching sound and when you\nheadshot people you'd hear that but they\nthey took it off but for that day was\nactually like one of the worst days I've\nhad in like the last month just because\nof that small thing how do you\nunderstand why such a small thing could\naffect you so profoundly because I\njoy in the sound cues when I you know\nI'm rewarded for playing well and the\naddiction sound cues and video games are\nactually super big to me if if they're\nlike badly done or poorly quality no\nmatter how good the gameplay is or no\nmatter how good everything is the sound\nis like a huge part of my gaming\nexperience\nare you tired right now darkness a\nlittle bit but I always sound like this\nand what is like this\nmonotone Low Energy when you say always\nwhere you like this as a kid depends on\nwhat time as I was when I was a kid\nI go ahead\nI'm sorry you were saying thank you by\nthe way so your question is\nam I always like this as a kid yeah\nwe're you always like this as a kid\num there's times where I was super\nenergetic but because I was teased and\nbullied throughout my school years I\nbecame more shy and had anxiety with\ntalking with people I was very awkward\nwhat happened when you became monotone\nwith respect to the bullying um I think\nthat's just my natural voice for when I\ncame Molitor I get that I mean so you\nit's interesting because you said I used\nto get excited and then and then after\nthat sentence literally you said I would\nget Boyd oh yeah and so it's strange for\nthose two sentences to come back to back\nI'm very bad at explaining things and\ntelling stories but basically I'm not so\nsure I agree with that but go ahead\num so throughout my school life I used\nto be nice to all the kids in class\nbecause I wanted to be funny I wanted to\nmake people laugh I want to make people\nhappy and there are some kids in my high\nschool that would take advantage of my\nkindness even though I was like even\nthough I was like the biggest kid in\nclass I started to get bullied and out\nof getting bullied I would get angry and\nthey would tell on the teacher and tell\nme that I needed\ningor management because I would get mad\nat them and yell back at them and so I\nhad I had anger management in elementary\nschool and I basically just used it as\nan excuse to get out of class and so\nI'll ask you again\nokay what happened to the bullies when\nyou became monotone\nI guess I has nothing to do if if I\ninteresting really so I think that I\ndon't think you're a bad storyteller I\njust don't think you're consciously\naware of what you're saying so when you\nsay I'm a bad storyteller what I hear is\nthat these dots don't feel connected and\nI shouldn't tell a more complete story\nright you know yeah but actually I feel\nlike the dots are very connected what\nwe're what we're literally hearing so\nlet me tell you the story that I hear\nhere's a kid who's expressive and what\nhappens when he is expressive um I got\nbullied and I got sad you got bullied\nand you got saddened not just bullied\nright what did when you expressed things\nyou got bullied and how did you respond\nto that that bullying angry you and\nthat's expression mm-hmm and then when\nyou expressing so you expressed\nsomething first the first time you get\nbullied you express something else and\nthen what happens I got angry and then I\nwould get sad because I was angry and\nthen and then what are the teachers do\nbut he put me in anger management which\nis a class that teaches you to do what\nto control my anger and become monotone\nsee that uh yeah yeah like like\nliterally literally just think about\nthis for a second iris literally you\nwere put in a class that taught you how\nto take what's on the inside and not\nshow it to the people on the outside oh\nso that kind of like am i is that does\nthat sound like a stretch to you no that\nmakes sense yeah and and it's kind of\nweird I mean it's like I couldn't get a\nmore perfect answer from you in terms of\nthe poll this guy was actually taught\nthis because it was weird cuz you said\nso I think dyrus I don't think I mean\nthere are a couple of statements that\nyou made about you know that are a\nlittle bit devaluing like I'm not a good\nstoryteller I don't think that\nnot a good storyteller I think that\nthere are things that your mind is\npiecing together which consciously you\ndon't understand but I think you\nunderstood this all along because you\nyou actually it's strange to say I used\nto be an excited kid and I used to enjoy\nmaking people laugh and then I got\nbullied and I asked you a little bit\nabout like have you always been this way\nand so your mind is already piecing\ntogether\nmonotone monotone miss being excited as\na kid and getting bullied like those\nthree those three sentences are linked\nin your mind in some way and you're just\nnot entirely sure how they fit together\nand because you're not sure how they fit\ntogether you can't tell a clear story\nabout it but if I ask you the stories\nright there is that am I being too\nabstract I'm sorry oh no no you're\nyou're completely correct that's that's\nexactly how I am I'm not able to tell it\nclearly because I don't think you\nunderstand it clearly right so I think\nthat you know it but you don't\nunderstand it and and and the answers\nare there you just have to learn a\nprocess of accessing them and now I'm\ngonna share with you something that's\nreally kind of bizarre so this isn't I\ncould be completely wrong here but like\nyou're telling me that you're burnt out\nright and you're telling me like when I\nasked you originally about burnout you\nsaid 12 hours a day for like five to\nseven days a week and when I pressed you\na little bit further it's basically\ngaming all day every day\nTSM House pro gamer all this kind of\nstuff but like it's weird because it's\nlike why the [ __ ] are you burnt out now\nlike when I my first answer your first\nanswer to when did you experience\nburnout as you talked about something\nthat you haven't been a pro now for four\nyears right mm-hmm and and I'm not\nsaying that you aren't burnt out now I'm\njust saying it's kind of strange that\nyour answer it's like oh yeah why are\nyou sad and someone says yeah you know I\nhad a I had a really a toxic\nrelationship four years ago and it's\nlike sure that probably has something to\ndo with it but it's strange that the\nburnout has kind of lingered so long\ndoes that make sense\nhey oh good\nI I guess that my my lifestyle from four\nyears ago the only thing that's change\nis that instead of it being super high\nskill and competitive and stressful and\nbeing in a team environment and went\nfrom that to just putting all my time\ninto streaming and at the same time it\ntook up my time which was good for me\nbut um I went through a lot of pain at\nthe end of the year cuz I I stopped\nplaying and I had a relationship where I\nbroke up end of the ears meaning which\nyear um end of my pro career okay\nand when I stopped playing pro I broke\nup so I felt a lot of pain during the\ntime and then I got over it\njust one just a roller coaster of\nemotions throughout the next years I\nmoved out of the TSM house i i i lived\nwith uh one of my former teammates i had\nto learn how to take adult\nresponsibilities because i never i\nalways ignored all of that because the\nteam would take care of it paying rent\npaying for sounder you sound like a\n[ __ ] top laner let me just think\nabout it right the roller coaster being\ndone with the pro team moving out losing\nyour girlfriend you're alone\nI think a lot of people can relate with\nthat so I think a little people can do\nyeah but I yeah I am I do have the top\nplanar mentality yeah I know and he\nwould keep going at it and I didn't mean\nto interrupt\noh so two men I'm sorry so I I moved\nfrom the TSM house which was in LA to an\napartment near them and then I lived\nthere for two years and then I moved to\nAustin Texas for two years and now I'm I\nbought a house in Wichita Kansas and so\nnow I live in Wichita\nwhich it's okay Kansas hmm do you feel\nlike you're left all alone oh no I\nI've had a girlfriend for the last three\nyears sure I understand you have a\ngirlfriend do you feel like you've been\nleft all alone as like a player this\nperson or just do those words mean\nsomething to you do they resonate with\nhow you feel\ndo I I feel like because I'm not a pro\nanymore\nI've learned that there's a lot of\npeople that lose interest in me because\nI'm not pro which is understandable but\nthe ones that have pretended to be\ncloser than they really are have also\nshown and I there's like there's like\nthree different phases of it the first\none is I'm a pro player lots of fans\npeople talk about me every day when I\nwas a pro confession here when I was a\npro I would do things like look up my\nown name that's a that's something where\nI enjoyed the intention the attention\nand so that was the first phase I would\nstop being pro the second phase was I\nwould I'm just a streamer I would I\nretired I was still relevant as a\nstreamer and I kept streaming every day\nand slowly as I played more and more I\nlet I cared less for the for being good\nat the game and with that people also\nstarted to care about me less and it\nslowly became this thing where I was\nscared of being irrelevant I was scared\nof you know losing value of being\nrelevant and so I thought to myself for\na long time like what what matters to me\nmost and so it was hurting me and I so I\ndecided to quit League after a certain\npoint and then the last phase was still\ntrying to decide do I care about being\nrelevant or do I care about what's happy\nlike what's good for me but they're all\nconnected in some kind\nway so it's just like it's like if you\nbehind your PC there's a bunch of cords\nand it gets all over the place that's\nhow that's how I feel about my different\nphases of life like it's just the cords\nare just everywhere and I don't know how\nto that's [ __ ] burnout buddy I'm gonna\ntell you something doesn't sound\nabsolutely crazy I don't think it has to\ndo with your pro career I don't think\nit's any of that [ __ ] I think it's all\nthe cords being untangled I think life\nis overwhelming like you don't know what\nto do you don't know what's gonna make\nyou feel good you don't know what you\nshould do you don't know how to make\nmoney you don't know how to have fun I\nask you do you feel like you're left all\nalone and then you say I have a\ngirlfriend and then I ask you the same\ndamn question again I'm not trying to\nbeat you up here\nright [ __ ] myself at any point no no\nyou're completely fine and then you say\nI have a girlfriend and then I ask you\ndo you feel left alone and you're like\nI'm not sure what that means then I ask\nyou a third time do those words sit with\nyou and you say yes and there we see\nyour confusion because you're like in\nsome part of your mind you're thinking\nto yourself I shouldn't feel this way\nbecause I have a girlfriend like in what\nwhere is feeling alone come from because\nI've done the things I'm in Wichita I\nhave some real friends I recognize I\ndon't I have some fake friends I figured\nout who those are because you're solving\nso many problems like you're doing so\ngood right and that's why it's so\n[ __ ] confusing you've moved to\nWichita you figured out sort of what\nyou're gonna do for your mental health\nyou've got this girlfriend you're\nplaying Valerie it's it's a lot of fun\nand like you're you're checking all the\nboxes but like you feel wrong you feel\nalone and burnt out and like there's a\nlot of [ __ ] tangled up behind the\ncomputer and you don't know what plugs\ninto what and what goes where in which\ncord does what you know it's all there\nin some way but it's just not fit\ntogether yeah\ncompletely agree what are you feeling\nright now\na bit of relief well maybe a tear in my\neye a little happy I guess\nyour daughter that one yeah hmm\nsensitive to sound huh yeah I am\nsensitive to sound yeah I see that I\nthink you're a really sensitive guy what\ndo you think I've been told that a lot\nbut I've always tried to put up the\nfront of you know I'm holding it down\nyeah monotone I hold it in a law huh I\ndon't think this is burnout\nI think it's bourbon bourbon cuz here's\nhere's what was confusing to me right is\nthat you say okay I ask you the first\nquestion and and really I'm not trying\nto say you're stupid or anything I'm\njust pointing out what your mind is\ndoing okay so just try to pay attention\nI asked you like about burnout your\nfirst thing is you talk about life is a\npro and that was four years ago\nwhich is that the source of your burnout\nand then you say well I sort of\ncontinued that lifestyle I wake up every\nday I still do all this kind of stuff\nokay so like maybe it's the lifestyle\nmaybe it's streaming and you were like\nyeah but I've placed programming with\nstreaming that makes sense to streamers\nget burnt out all the time and then\ncomes the really confusing thing which\nis that you say I took a break for three\nmonths and it helped a little now that's\nreally confusing because if it's the pro\ngaming and if it's the streaming and you\ntook a break from it then that should\nhelp a lot so either you're doing your\nstandard thing where you sort of\ndownplay the impact of things you say a\nlittle bit like you say maybe a tear in\nmy eye right you have this tendency to\nuse like small words mm-hmm\nso maybe it's that but I think I think\nit just it's a clue that it's not\nactually those environments and I know\nthis sounds completely crazy but I think\nyou carry the burnout with you and I\nthink that one of the most confusing\nthings about being a human being\nespecially when you've been entrained to\nnot feel what you feel on the inside and\nif you really want to understand this we\nhave to talk about your internship with\nyour dad's company okay right and I\nthink we've got a lot there but but that\nyou're a guy who has taken what you feel\nand you\nshafted aside for the sake of other\nthings for the sake of not getting in\ntrouble in class you've taken your\nexcitement in your joy and you put them\naside because of your fear of bullying\nyou've taken your frustration when\npeople bully you and you try to defend\nyourself and then the teacher like\nbrings down your neck and then you got\nput in an anger management class and\nthose kids are like [ __ ] you dyrus you\nsuck and then you're not allowed to say\nanything and you become a pro player\nwe're like no one cares that you're\ntired no one cares that you're left all\nalone in the top light in a shitty\n[ __ ] meta where it's to be one top\nlike no one [ __ ] cares they're like\n[ __ ] liars yeah that is the general\nidea but I don't want I want to say this\nbecause that would be disrespectful\ntowards of people that have cared for me\nlike there are a lot of people have\nsupported me in my community that have\nwatched me for a long time and have\nsupported me for a long time so I don't\nwant to forget about sharing coz it's so\neasy to focus on the negative yeah so\nI'm I'm so let me be clear I'm glad you\nsaid that I'm not trying to paint\neveryone with a bad brush although I am\ndoing exactly that the reason that I'm\ndoing that is because I'm amplifying\nbecause you're suppressive mm-hm so I'm\ngonna blow things out of proportion\nokay and then I think somewhere in the\nmiddle between you downplaying things\nand me like up playing things we're\ngonna arrive at somewhere near the truth\nwhich is not that it's it's not that\nit's your your kids I mean they're your\nparents teammates Mike my kid is\nshouting my name in the background but\nmy it's not your teammates fault that\nthe meta is that way but I think it\nstill speaks to I think they're hunting\nfor her because she's looking for me and\nshe usually wants nothing here but I I\nthink somewhere along this is like it's\nthe feeling of being left all alone\nright and there's something about a\nfeeling there's something about a burden\nthat you carry with you there's\nsomething about what you feel in terms\nof burnout that actually is not because\nyou're a pro player\nor because you're a streamer because if\nyou took a three-month break that should\nhave made a big difference if that's the\nsource of it so this is the really crazy\nthing is that when we think about life\nand we think about why we feel the way\nthat we do we tend to attribute the way\nthat we feel to external things you say\nthe reason I'm burnt out is because I\nwas a pro is because I'm a streamer you\nknow the reason that I'm unhappy is\nbecause my wife doesn't do XYZ or my\ngirlfriend doesn't care about me enough\nfor the reason that I feel alone is\nbecause I don't have a girlfriend right\nI feel so lonely because I have no one\nto love and no one loves me and all this\nkind of [ __ ] and then the funny thing is\nthat you've done some of those things\nthat are supposed to make those feelings\ngo away and then it's kind of confusing\nand then you end up with all the cords\nbehind your PC because this is how\nyou're supposed to feel and I'm sure\nthat you do feel I mean I'm not sure but\nI imagine you feel loved and appreciated\nby your girlfriend and all that stuff\nlike you have all the positive things in\nthe relationship that the girlfriend is\nsupposed to give you and yet you still\nfeel left alone and that's exactly my\npoint it's not the girlfriend it's not\nthat you are pro player it's not that\nyou're a streamer this is something that\nyou carry within you it's something you\ncarried for a long time and now this is\nkind of cool because what this means\nit's kind of cool and it's kind of\ncrappy because on the one hand you don't\nhave to change anything in the outside\nworld you don't have to be a pro again\nyou know what this means is that you are\nnot you are not forced into playing\nsomething for your fans or your money or\nwhatever like you can if you need money\nand streaming is the way that you're\ngonna get it that's fine but the\nfeelings that you have inside are not\ncontrolled by what happens on the\noutside so the cool thing is like that\nshould be a little bit liberating and it\nshould also be really really confusing\nbecause then like what the [ __ ] are they\ncontrolled by really any thoughts so far\nare we good questions I I feel like\nthe three-month break I I feel like one\nof the reasons why it didn't really help\nas much but helped a little bit was\nbecause I don't know how to take a break\none of the things my girlfriend has\nmentioned to me is that I should try and\nfind another hobby because my mind is so\nreliant on playing games and because all\nother than playing games all only other\nthing I do is watch anime or read manga\nor watch TV shows and um I can't I can't\nreally find anything else that holds me\nup the same way for example when the\nValerii change happened I was having a\nreally shitty day and I don't know\nthere's not my favorite TV shows there\nthere's no episodes out I don't know\nwhat to watch like what it was yeah so\nwe're gonna talk about dopamine\nexhaustion and and how your brain may\nreally not be helping you right now but\nI want to point something else out to\nyou I don't know how to take a break is\nthat something in the outside world or\nis that something on the inside is that\nwithin you were that something in the\nenvironment I think that's mostly within\nme because if I had if I had to choose\nlike my parties and life like gaming is\nlike top three sure pop - what does that\nhave to do with not knowing how to take\na break so I don't I don't know\ndo to feel relaxed I guess okay I\nbeautiful sentence okay and therein lies\nour problem what to do to feel okay\nwe're gonna help you out dyrus I'm gonna\ntry so I'm gonna give you another\nsentence I should learn a new hobby is\nthat something on the inside or\nsomething on the outside it's something\ntold from now\nand it's something that on the inside\nit's like yeah I should do that but then\nI though a hobby is external right\nlike like the point here is that you\ndon't know how to take a break and say\nyour girlfriend says learn a hobby but\nlike and I'm gonna say the last thing so\nnow here's the beautiful sentence I\ndon't know what to do to feel relaxed so\nthat implies that your relaxation comes\nfrom something on the outside does that\nmake sense I don't know what to do to\nfeel relaxed yes I think that is\naccurate right so the the thing the\nhypothesis that I'm asking you to\nentertain is that you were looking for\nfar too many solutions on the outside\nand if we look at it like the more that\nwe look at your problem you say I'm\nburnt out because I was a pro player I'm\nburnt out because I'm a streamer but\nthen if we want to be really scientific\nabout it then removing those things\nshould relieve your burnout but when you\ndid that for three months it didn't\nreally relieve your burn out and in fact\nwhen you did that so that didn't work\nand then when we asked you why it's\nbecause I don't know how to take a break\nthat's the answer the answer is it that\nyou should find something else to\ndistract you and you kind of say like\nokay I need an anime or manga or\nwhatever but like the point is that you\nhave things to distract you you have\nshows you can play valent you know how\nto engage your mind\nbut despite engaging your mind and\nwatching anime and and and reading manga\nand playing valent and whatever you\nstill carry this feeling of being left\nalone of feeling burnt out like that's\nsomething you carry within you and no\namount of doing any [ __ ] outside is ever\ngonna fix that like finding a new hobby\nis not going to fix that it's just gonna\nteach you to be distracted from it like\ndo you see how your mind moves from\ndistraction - distraction you have to\nrotate because as the dopamine from\nvalence starts to get like like as you\nbuild up tolerance from the dopamine\nrelease from Valerie you have to move to\nanime and then you build up tolerance to\nthat and then you have to move to manga\nand then you build up tolerance to that\nand then you you you cross your fingers\nand you hope that by the time you burn\nthrough your three there's something you\ncan watch\nNetflix and by the time you burn through\nthat by then your dopamine will have\nlike recalibrated with valent you can go\nback to square one\nmm-hmm and what we see is a generation\nof people that move from distraction to\nthe distraction - distraction YouTube\nreddit twitch gaming YouTube reddit\ntwitch gaming our anime manga D&D I\ncan't tell you how many times that I\ncatch myself just clicking on Twitter\nover and over Twitter list just our\nsociety is like yeah man you want you\nwant another hit like let me show you\nTwitter let me show you read it like\nhere man like oh yeah that cocaine is\nreally good actually really try a\nspeedball toss some heroin in there a\nlittle bit of tic toc I've told a lot of\nmy friends this that so in Hawaii\nthere's a lot of drug trafficking and\nevery person I knew had some kind of\nconnection to drugs and when I was in\nmiddle school now sad I got peer\npressured into trying some drugs and I\nhad tried a bunch of drugs and I always\ntold my friend I asked my friends do you\nknow what the number one drug of the\nmall for me is and the reason why I\ndon't do drugs\nit's just video games video games is my\nstrongest addictions that you don't do\ndrugs\nyou just don't ingest substances big\ndifference yeah what we're addicted to\nis avoidance right it's like all these\nthings and like I'm with you man like\nyou know my dopamine gets going - it's a\nbeautiful story but I think that dyerson\nthat your answers are not it's like\nnothing on the outside man it's all on\nthe inside and this is a good person\noh yeah go ahead so what do i what do i\ndo yeah like that's the best question to\nask it's a great question okay so the\nanswer unfortunately is a little bit\ncomplex but the second but the first\nthing is that you've done a big part\ntoday like because just in realizing\nlike you know that the answer is not on\nthe outside is gonna be huge because I\nthink so far for most of your life\nyou've been looking for answers on the\noutside mmm-hmm and I think I mean in\nsome ways it's gonna feel it's gonna be\neasier than you think it is but you\ncan't really do it which makes it hard I\nknow it sounds kind of weird and I know\nI I completely understand that statement\nso please explain it to us because it's\nlike when you see someone do something\nit's easier said than done because\nthere's so many complex things that go\ninto it some people just have a knack\nfor it I just understand certain parts\nof it and for others it's it can be\nsomething as simple as like whistling\nyou know you some people just naturally\ncan whistle and when I was little I\ncan't I can't whistle now I can never\nwhistle but for some people seem simple\nbut maybe there's some kind of feeling\nin my mouth for shape that I'm supposed\nto make to whistle but I can't do it\nbecause I don't I just doesn't click\nwith me it's a beautiful example so\nhere's the thing I think whistling is\nthe perfect example so I think it's like\nwhistling in the sense that you got a\ntry and you got a try and you got a try\nand then one day you're gonna do it\nthat's really how it works and and\nthat's why you know people talk about\nenlightenment you've heard of\nenlightenment it's like you know in the\nBuddhists and Hindus talk about it a\nfair amount je n'ai I'm sorry could you\nrepeat that you're familiar with the\nconcept of enlightenment yay or nay you\nknow your problem like Buddhism yes yet\nmissionary Christian like being stuck in\na closet for two hours I see who you\nreally are I like that something like\nthat there's this idea that like you\nknow people reach this moment of\nrealization where they discover their\ntrue self and then they feel like\nthey're blissful and happy and and\nthey're suffering all goes away and [ __ ]\nlike that and I think that the\nwas like realization comes in moments\nright I'm sure there have been times in\nyour life or like if you think about\nyour pro league career we're in the\nprocess of becoming a pro like one day\nsomething clicked for you and then you\nunderstood something that you didn't\nunderstand for and then you became\nbetter because of it does that make\nsense\nI understand the concept yeah okay\nand so the tricky thing about you know\nhow do you learn to take a break which\nis I think what you need to do you know\nit's it's hard it's kind of like\nwhistling you just have to keep trying\nat it for a while and then you'll kind\nof like you'll hit upon it one day and I\ncan give you some I'll give you some\nmore structured answer than that okay\nokay\nI don't know there is one thing that\nI've been missing this entire time that\nI wanted to mention that's also caused\nall this so when he offends there's\nnegative reactions and positive\nobviously but I think one of the things\nthat causes me to be stressed out and\nirritated as when I stream or maybe go\npost something on Twitter there's like\ntwitch Ted you know how twitch attack\ncan get it under everyone's skin maybe\nsomeone asks the same question you've\nbeen as hearing for four months a good\nexample is when I when I stopped playing\nLeague of Legends several years ago I\nkept that getting asked play League when\nare you playing league and I put out\nlike two videos I put a command for it\nI've expressed it so many times and I\nget told the like I swear to God if\nthere was a command that triggered every\ntime I've been asked the same question\nof the common question of when are you\ngonna play league right now the common\nquestion is are you and your girlfriend\nstill together that one's the common one\nnow but I swear to god it it's been\nasked that at least in the five digits\namount of times and that that is\nsomething that really just gets to me\nand I've been trying to gnome out what\ngets to you about that let's talk about\nthat\nfor sharing by the way yeah I wanted I\nfelt like something was missing in all\nthis yo you're absolutely right and I\nwonder if twitch a can figure out what\nit is what bothers you about that\ndon't look at twitch chat by the way\nthey're pretty good at this by now i i\nhave twitch chat off I made sure to not\nhave it on this entire time no Matt home\nyeah of course not um so when I first\nbecame quote-unquote a pro famous I\ndidn't see myself as it but people come\nup for autographs like you know I'm\nhappy to answer all the questions talk\nto them but after a long time it's like\nI still do like doing it a little bit as\nlong as people are happy I'm happy but\nthe constant questioning of the same\nthing over and over just just gets to me\nand I start to act more negatively\nnegatively and let's say someone asked\nhow are you doing and instead of being\nlike I could easily just be like fine I\nend up ignoring it or maybe if I'm in a\nbad mood I act negatively so let's just\nlet's forget about your reaction let's\nrewind a little bit\nthey risk and ask and ask how does that\nmake you feel dyrus when they asked over\nand over and over again it's really\nirritated bitter and I guess being asked\nthe\nquestion over and over and having to\nanswer it over and over again what's\nirritating about that what does that\nmean what kind of question gets why do\nyou have to answer something over and\nover and over again because if I'm\nstreaming I feel like I should interact\nwith my chat sure that's why you're\nstreaming but let's just think about\nthis for a second okay like what's let\nme just think about whether I want to\njust tell you or trying to walk you to\nit because I don't know how to ask the\nquestions the right way\nso I'll ask you this Cyrus has there\nbeen a time in your life when people\ndidn't listen all the time I actually\nI'm actually a very special case for\nthat there's been many instances where\nI've said things and not not just people\nasking the same question over and over\nbut just like even people that I know\neven in a competitive environment when\nI'll say something and it's just\ncompletely ignored in throughout my\ncareer I want to go under the age how\nold are you now tires if you don't mind\nme asking\nI am 20th alright so we're gonna go back\nto 18 or the the latest I'm gonna let\nyou go as to when you quit your\ninternship or you got fired tell me\nabout how you were not listened to\nbefore\nI'm thinking about it though it has\nhappened um I guess the easiest example\nI can think of is I've had friends who\nbecame in relationships and I was always\nin the middle of it I guess I would\nbecause I was good friends with both of\nthem so I'd kind of be like in the\ntwilight zone\nand I would tell them certain things\nlike if you do this this is gonna happen\nor you shouldn't do this it's this is\ngonna happen and they don't listen\njust like whoa what was the point of\nsaying in the first place\nyou know why I ask me if you're not\ngonna listen and I've had that situation\na lot in many different scenarios is\nluck is is in the twilight zone does\nthat feel like left all alone\nnot not really that's fine about it add\nas much I'm just trying to understand\nwhat by what what you meant by that term\nnot everything has so connected by the\nway yeah okay you know yes so let me ask\nyou can I ask you a couple questions\nyeah can you tell me about how you ended\nup can you tell me a little bit about\ngrowing up in Hawaii um so I grew up and\na\nI had my mom dad grandma auntie and\ncousin living in the same house we lived\nright across like a college and a school\num growing up my dad gave me the belt\ncuz I what happened was that I drew\nyou know those videotape cassettes I\nthrew one at my cousin and she was\nlaughing so I was like oh she likes this\nso I threw another one she started\nbleeding crying and then I got the belt\ncuz yeah I was dumb kid but I'm Hillary\nI was like three years old three four\nyears old and so growing up in that\nhousehold\nmy grandma would babysit me the video\ngames that my parents bought for me\nbabysit me I guess I kind of bullied my\ncousin a little bit at the start but\nthen I stopped I was actually kind of a\nmean kid growing up so that when when it\ncame to some things but I immediately\nstopped after a certain point like there\nwas a time where I his thing yeah go\nahead\noh there there was a time where I've now\nnow I think back on it I was kind of\nmean but I never was like trying to be\nmean it was just I was just saying or\ndoing whatever I felt like I was more\nfree as a kid uh what did what did you\nwanna say why do kids why are kids mean\nI mean aside from the general fact that\nall all kids are [ __ ] me cuz I didn't\nknow anything I don't know any\nboundaries\nthe only boundaries i falled were the\nrules that were set to me mm-hmm\nlet me ask you something do kids do\nsomething big so when a kid speaks and\nthis is gonna be sounded kind of a\nstupid question so it may not even make\nsense when a kid speaks is a kid able to\nspeak because\nknow something or because they don't\nknow something they just do because I\nwant to sure but the capacity of speech\nfor a child is that because of something\nthat a child knows or because of a child\nwhat a child doesn't know because they\nknow how to speak right so like if I\nhave a if I have a kid that goes peepee\non the potty versus peepee somewhere\nelse like is it because the kid knows\nwhere to go peepee or kind of doesn't\nknow know where to go peepee I'm being\nyour kid here yes it's a dumb question\nso I'll just be instead of asking you\nquestions I'm just gonna say it so I\nthink kids are taught things right kids\ndo what they're taught to do that's how\nkids learn\nso like you know if you're a mean kid I\ndon't think that's because you didn't\nknow better any better I think it's\nactually exactly the opposite it's\nbecause that's what you knew mmm-hmm\ndoes that make sense like kids do things\nso like you know I've worked with kids\nthat will so I one time worked with a\nkid that would tear holes in stuffed\nanimals and put pieces of candy inside\nthe butthole that it would make for the\nchild I mean so they would make a bottle\nin a stuffed animal and it would soft\ncandy in there or why do you think that\nkid does that like a three and a half\nyear old the story may be making a\npinata no it's because someone did that\nto that child oh yeah that was a very\nthat makes sons yeah yeah how do you\nfeel\nright now diners um just one of those\nextreme examples it kind of reminds me\nof uh when destiny makes those extreme\nexamples it's kind of token back I guess\nyou know do you think about you being a\nmean kid\nyou know I guess I would\nI didn't know anything but after what we\nsaid it doesn't seem like to be the\nright thing to say\nyeah absolutely I know it doesn't feel\nthat way to you but remember that like\nwhat we're the whole theme of this\nconversation dyrus is that things don't\nappear to make sense for you for you\neven though you understand them mm-hmm\nright even when we think about like\nburnout and when we think about you know\nI think well there are a lot of things\nhere that you understand that I just\ndon't think you know you understand and\nI'm not surprised at all you were a mean\nkid and I knew you were gonna be a mean\nkid the second you said two words give\nyou any any idea what those words are\nmaybe twitch chat knows when I get\nirritated when people repeat themselves\nnope the belt okay how do you understand\nwhat am I trying to say\nany idea\nbecause I got the belt at a young age\nthat caused me to be afraid and I'm not\njust afraid buddy no no you're missing\nthis so like you got the belt and what\nwas your dad being to you in that moment\nmean to me absolutely\nso kids learn what they're taught okay\nright rude and I think I think it's\nweird because you say I used to be a\nmean kid until one day I woke up and I\nwasn't anymore\nand I think that's the day that you\nstarted to think for yourself in some\nway but I think you were just doing like\nyou were throwing objects at someone and\nyou thought it was fun until they\nstarted getting hurt and like you didn't\nunderstand any better right like you you\njust it's so interesting that you\nremember you have such a clear memory as\na three-year-old because I don't know if\nyou know this but like three olds don't\nreally have good memory I I have a few\nplate I remember standing on the scale\nand I'm being like oh I'm 50 pounds how\nthree years old and birth oh I think\nthree is when I started to be conscious\nof things and I think well they're\nwritten conscious i-i thinkt one of the\nreasons why i remember a lot is because\ni played video games and i remember a\nlot of video games well that's I don't\nmaybe that's not it I I think that I can\nremember video a lot of video games\nbecause I was I played a lot of video\ngames yeah so I think I don't I think\nit's the other way around I think you're\nyou're demonstrating that you had\nmemories way clear of video games at a\nvery young age right so so\nanything you just remember videogames\nbecause you became conscious at a very\nyoung age it's not the other way around\nvideo games aren't the causative factor\nit's just that yeah yeah yeah yes yes I\nmean and so I I'm hearing that you learn\nyeah I mean so when you weighed yourself\nat the age of three and you were 50\npounds how did you treat yourself and\nhow did other people treat you they\ndidn't mean anything it's just a memory\nokay can I just think for a second oh go\nahead\nyou\ndarris I'm not getting the sense that\nwe're gonna be able to tie this up with\na nice neat and bow program in the next\n30 minutes I mean there are many\nquestions that I want to ask I think\nwe're getting on the important stuff but\nlike we can just get to the points like\nthe stuff that really matters well I\nmean I think all of this really matters\nI'm just I'm just not sure we're gonna\nyou know so in my mind the tying up the\nbow is in teaching you how to take a\nbreak it's about helping you be more in\ntune with your internal environment it's\nabout not suppressing the things that\nyou feel and making sense of things that\nyou don't understand it's a tall order I\njust don't think it can be accomplished\nin the next 30 minutes alright and I\nthink that there's just so much here\nthat is like low-hanging fruit like I\ndon't think you appreciate all right I\nwould love it if you could learn to\nappreciate or explore I mean I could be\nwrong here that let me put it this way\nso I think you feel the way that you do\nbecause it's not burn like you carry the\nburn out with you it's not because of an\nexternal thing it's because of an\ninternal thing I think you get\nfrustrated with people because you\nhaven't been listened to and like I can\nimagine a child in so many situations\nthat you've described being frustrated\nbecause they aren't listened to I can\nimagine when your dad pulls out the belt\nyou try to explain to him I thought she\nwas having fun and him not giving a [ __ ]\nlike I I can see your genuine confusion\nI could imagine a three-year-olds\ngenuine confusion or not even having the\nwords to be able to say that but just\nlike trying to explain to like your dad\nas he like pulls off the belt that like\nyou didn't mean to write because you\nremember that you remember that she was\nlaughing and you remember why you threw\nit again and you remember that there was\nno malice in your heart and you got beat\nfor it and that you had a different side\nof the story and then we can\nfast-forward a grade-school when\nmy kids make fun of you and they bully\nyou and then you fight back and then the\nteacher comes over they go red they they\nprovoke you and they bully you and then\nthey go tell on you and the teacher\ncomes over and then what do you try to\ndo you try to explain and you say no\nthey started it\nand the teacher doesn't listen then we\nalso get this complex that you've been\nshowing us a little bit of about like\nhow you're not good with your words and\nyou don't understand like you know you\nsaid that a couple of times like I'm not\nbeing clear or something like that\nmm-hmm\nand I and I think that somewhere along\nthe way like you started to feel like\npeople don't listen to you and then we\nknow this because I'll ask you these\nquestions I'll be like you know I sort\nof asked you know a bunch of different\nways and then I said dyrus do you feel\nlike you have them and listened to and\nyou're like all the time and if it's all\nthe time do you see how that means that\nyou carry it with you it's been with you\nall along if it's all the time it's not\nan external environment it's you does\nthat make sense yes that makes homes and\nand so the and and then when we think\nabout being burnt out it's like there's\na sense of confusion about your life and\nand there's a sense of being left all\nalone and I don't know where that comes\nfrom but I think that I mean I think it\ncomes back to like this story I mean I\nthink we're gonna find a lot I mean I\ndon't really know but the story that you\ndescribed to me about your your dad and\nhis company like can you just tell us\nthat like what happened in high school\nand and and it sounds like you got I\nmean when you say you got the belt so it\nsounds like that wasn't a one-time\noccurrence oh it was only one time it\nwas only one time it's interesting yeah\nokay um okay\nso in other ways um I mean sometimes I\ngot yelled at for doing dumb things\nsounds pretty normal\nOh in third in third grade you took me\ninto or he put me in baseball cuz uh you\nknow it'd be good\ngive me a hobby growing up just give me\na sports early maybe I could be an X\nhomerun hero you know I'll go MLB but um\nso we went to baseball practice and all\nour teammates weren't there like they're\nthere at another basketball game\nwatching like friends or family be in a\nbasketball game and we were there and we\nforgot they told us and so I showed my\ndad my math homework and I thought it\nwas right but he said it was wrong and\nso we got irritated me for half-assing\nit which I always did I always have\nasked things a lot but I would always do\nthem and he's like all right boy let's\nlet's play catch you know and so I\nplayed catch with him and my form was\nlike a little off I also was scared of\nthe ball because when the baseballs\nbeing thrown at you I just you know a\nflinch I'm not as used to it I'm scared\nof being hit sure and so he got here at\n8:00 he got irritated that I was\nflinching the story's probably clear\nfrom him but basically he was irritated\nat me because I was flinching I wasn't\nyou know thrown the ball right kind of\nbeing a [ __ ] and one time he threw it\nhard and it hit my left eye and I got a\nbruise on my left eye and I and I I fell\nover and I remember the lying when he\ntalks about today's like damn boy I\nthought I killed you I was scared to\ndeath and he told me that he learned a\nlife lesson there and he started to be\nnicer after that but\nyeah that I really hurt hit getting hit\nby baseball in the eye so that was that\nwas another time where he was I mean\nharangue angry to me but he he he\nactually learned something like a big\nthing about that dyrus you're laughing\nwhat's funny about that because when we\ntalk about it my dad laughs about it and\nI think about it as a as a vent were I I\ndidn't cry I was just like in pain and\ndyrus was me about it it's just the\nthing I can look back on just as an\nevent wow he looks so terrified I say\nlike that because I don't I'm asked a\nquestion and you're not giving me an\nanswer and so I'm bludgeoning to you\nhere are my baseball's what's funny\nabout it\nI'm not sure he's a lot sister it seems\nfunny to me about on now on yeah so let\nme tell you the story that I heard yeah\nthere's this one time yeah I took my\nthird grade kid out to the out to play\nbaseball and that that dumbass hadn't\ndone is his math homework right and so\nhe was like he's such a [ __ ] [ __ ] he\nlike didn't know how to catch and so I\nthrew the ball at him and I threw harder\nand harder and harder knees flinch I\nokay and then and then I I popped him in\nthe head and boy I almost killed him and\nthen I learned my lesson so I think I\nthink what was funny to me is because my\ndad for the first time in my life I\nrealized that my dad was super scared\nfrom it and that's something I that's a\nside I've never seen him I am super\nscared of what God\nthought he really hurt like killed me or\nsomething you know you're telling me for\nthat for the first time in your life in\nthe third grade you saw a sign from your\ndad that he cared about you know he God\nthat just makes me feel so bad thinking\nabout that way I understand remember I'm\namplifying because you're doing yeah\nright right so so dyrus here's what I\nwant you to notice okay okay you can\nfeel like a bad person for thinking or\nsaying those things and I may be\namplifying right like I may not be\ncharacterizing it like please you\nhaven't told me the thousand stories\nabout your dad when he did demonstrate\nthe scary I don't think your dad was an\n[ __ ] mm-hmm okay but like I want you\nto just notice notice the stories that\nyou're saying is the story that you told\nme is not funny\nwhen your dad tells that story the lack\nof this the fact that he laughs is also\nnot funny like that's not funny man I\nunderstand that we laugh at it and\nthere's a very good reason that we laugh\nat it we laugh at it because humor is a\ndefense mechanism and because sometimes\nwhen things become morbid we laugh\nbecause that's the only way that we\ncan't deal with it but the problem is\nthat like you know your dad laughs\nbecause it makes him uncomfortable but I\nreally do think that there's something a\nlittle bit like there's something a\nlittle bit off about this whole picture\nright there's there's something a little\nbit off about it you know you laughing\nbecause your dad was scared of hurting\nyou like what the [ __ ] it's\nand and I'm not a few yeah go ahead okay\num you can continue so I I'm not saying\nI'm not saying that I'm painting a\npicture of reality and I'm not trying to\nshame you and I understand if you feel\nguilt or shame or that sounds bad and I\nunderstand that like most parents are\nlike not perfect and I'm sure that your\ndad loved you and I'm sure that in a lot\nof ways he was a good dad and he tried\nhis best and like all that kind of stuff\nI'm not trying to turn him into a demon\nbut I am pointing out that I think\nsomething in your life left a couple of\nscars oh yeah my my parents were\ndivorced I forgot to mention that okay\nsure\nand and what I see in you today is\nbecause I like my whole point here so\nlike I'm gonna try to sort of wrap\nthings together okay not to say that\nwe're done because I don't know how to\nhow you fix this but here's the first\nthing that I'm noticing that your\nburnout sure has a lot to do with your\nlifestyle and stuff like that but that's\nsome of your burnout you carry with you\nit's like it's on the inside it's not on\nthe outside and that no amount of\nhobbies anime gaming Netflix or\ngirlfriends because it sounds like you\ndo pretty well for yourself\nI am very first of all probably kind of\nthing yeah but no amount of that stuff\nis gonna make that [ __ ] go away because\nyou've been like that's like a statement\nof science like it's a statement of\nempiricism because you've tried it all\nright you've tried three-month breaks\nyou've tried watching anime you've found\na really fun game you have a girlfriend\nyou're doing all of the things that\nshould make the feelings go away but\nthey don't go away so the first thing to\nunderstand is that burnout is coming\nfrom here not something on the outside\nokay and what is burnout the two themes\nthat I'm hearing from you are feeling\nforced to play feeling forced into\nthings and that I think is tied to\npeople not listening I think somewhere\nalong the way like you sort of learned\nthe lesson that people don't listen and\nit hurts and so you've got to go back\nand you've got to explore that hurt like\nwhen people should have listened and\nthey did\nwhen riot listen didn't lists they\nshould have listened and they didn't\nright when your teammates should have\nlistened and they didn't when [ __ ]\ntwitch chat should have listened because\nyou've answered a thousand times and\nthey didn't and you're gonna see this\npop up because I can predict that the\nconflict that you have with your\ngirlfriend is about her not listening I\nthink I don't want to get\ndeep into the bat because uh yeah but I\nI I want to say that we feel differently\nabout things sure and I all I I just\nwant to clarify that yes this a lot\neverything you just said yeah I feel\nthat way but I just want to clarify that\nI'm also not the perfect human being\nwe're not talking about her being right\nor wrong and we're not talking about\nwhether she does listen or she doesn't\nlisten what I'm saying is that you were\nsensitive to people not listening and\nthat you were going to perceive y'all's\nconflict in early in your relationship\nis her not listening or anytime that she\ndoesn't listen that's going to hurt you\nmore because you're already wounded\nthere does that make sense it's not even\ngonna be like like it's reasonable for\nher to not listen sometimes like\npartners aren't perfect but what I'm\nsaying is that you've kind of got like a\nparticular vulnerability like that's the\n[ __ ] in your armor right that's that's\nyour weak spot that's where you get\ncritically hit okay you're critical hits\nare around people not listening feeling\nforced into things that you don't want\nto do and feeling left all up and those\nare the things that we've heard you in\nsome way kind of talk about when I ask\nyou you know maybe when have you not\nbeen listened to in your like all the\n[ __ ] time right so that tells us like\nthat's a weak spot and that's where you\nget critically hit and so as you go\nthrough life but the problem here is\nthat anytime we get critically hit we\nlook on the outside and we say like oh\nman that weapon hurts a lot but the\nproblem isn't that the weapon is\ncritically hitting you the problem is\nthat you have a weak spot it's not about\nthe weapon it's about you I think I kind\nof create that weak spot sometimes you\nabsolutely create that weak spot that's\nmy whole [ __ ] point\nokay excellence is that this stuff you\ncarry with you and comes from within you\nand that no amount of finding a hobby is\ngonna keep you from creating that weak\nspot and this is the really tricky thing\nbecause you actually have control over\nthis you\nabsolutely create it and that also gives\nyou power right if you're responsible\nfor something if it's truly your fault\nand this is a big problem that people do\nright as we blame things for we blame\nourselves for things that were not\nempowered for like it's like either you\nhave the power we feel powerless and we\nblame ourselves those two things cannot\nfit together those two things don't work\ntogether if it's your fault then you had\nthe power and if you're powerless it's\nnot your fault but that's not what we\ntell ourselves we play this a really\n[ __ ] up game where we're like we blame\nourselves for this but we feel like\nwe're powerful us know and so I do think\nyou can control it I mean control it in\nthe sense of I think you need to heal it\nit needs healing right it doesn't it's\nnot like and so the question is how so I\nthink the first thing that I would say\nis notice that look for these three\nthings in your life and notice when they\npop up are you feeling left are you\nfeeling like a [ __ ] top laner is this\nthe [ __ ] top lane all over again well\nyou're trying to do stuff and like\nyou're trying to pay bills and no one's\nhelping you pay bills and you're\nsupposed to take care of this and you're\nsupposed to take care of that and you've\nbeen left out in the wind that's a\nfeeling you should look for number two\nfeeling is like wonder when do people\nnot listen so look for those things just\nnotice them within yourselves and as you\nnotice them recognize that those may or\nmay not be applicable to the actual\nsituation that some of this is coming\nfrom you it's not actually that the you\nknow the dagger is like an a piece of\nepic gear it's that you have a weak spot\nlike it's not like the problems aren't\nin the external world they're in here\nand the first thing you've got to do is\ntrain yourself to look within instead of\nlook outside okay\nsecond thing is to think back to where\nthat that weakness became exposed\nbecause you have to go back to like when\nthis started like so when are the times\nin your life and you did a good job\ntoday like when were you not listened to\nright and I'll ask you questions like\nwhen else was your dad mean to you I\nwould imagine that the belt was used a\ncouple of times you're like no one\nactually wasn't surprising but fine\nright sometimes the belt is a one time\nthing and then you laughed and you're\nlike oh by the way and so\nyour mind is linking that to your dad\nbeing mean even though you say it while\nyou're laughing and he laughs about it\nand you even sort of demonstrate like\nthat he cared about you after that and\nwas nicer to you so even though that\nstory has a positive spin you gave me\nthat answer when I asked about your dad\nbeing me so there's some part of your\nmind that equates your dad being mean\nthere and the more that I push you on\nthat you're like yeah you're making me\nfeel like an [ __ ] and you're making\nme my dad look like an [ __ ] and then\nyou feel protective and defensive which\nis fine but my point is the story isn't\nfunny right what jokes are funny\nlike dr. Kaiser boomer hahaha that's\nfunny\nright like memes like I also Google\nmyself but the reason I googled myself\nis because people make fun of me and\nthey just do a really good job and I\nthink it's actually where these people\nare very creative yeah that shit's funny\ngetting hit in the face with a baseball\nby your dad who's pissed at you for\nbeing a [ __ ] that's not funny\nand so somewhere along the way like you\nbecome disconnected from your internal\nenvironment that - you've got to like\nreconnect with like you've got to you\nknow get in touch with your feelings bro\nyou know cuz there's a lot there and\nthen like last thing is like you should\nthink about seeing a therapist if you\naren't already\nyeah I've I've been I'm actually been\nconnected with one that I'm going to\nstart good doing yeah and something that\nI told him well that him but my\ngirlfriend told me to do also and I\ndon't think that I definitely should do\nand and so I it's like work on this\nstuff right like start to talk about\nthose things and start to talk about how\nyou feel because end of the day I don't\nthink you have to live a life where you\nfeel burnt out and the last thing which\nwe don't have kind of too much time to\ntalk about is I think your brain has a\nlot of signs of dopamine exhaustion\nwhich is like when when you sort of get\nhit with dopamine time and time and time\nagain through extensive years of game\nand stuff like that stuff can feel blase\nmonotone or less fun and and then I you\nknow I I think that like doing something\nlike a dopamine fast may be a good idea\nor like a dopamine cleanse\nwhat are you kind of like you can really\nrecalibrate your brain and then the last\nthing that you can do is and I've talked\nabout that before on stream like it's on\nYouTube and stuff and I'll give people\nmore details about that but the last\nthing that you can do is meditate and if\nyou want to learn some meditation I can\nteach you today okay you have it all\ngreens with meditation I've been told to\ntry it before and I feel like I've\npretended to do it but I'd never really\nyou know I feel like giving it a shot\ntoday or maybe pretending or do you want\nto bow out oh no\nI'll try whatever the her hmm actually\nthere are cases reports of meditation\ninduced psychosis so but I don't think\nthat's gonna happen with you I hope no\nyeah but yeah so let's let me just think\nI want to\ntechnique that I think is gonna be a\nlittle bit hard to learn because it\nfeels super awkward but I feel like it's\nthe right technique for you is it okay\nif I we try that yeah I'm gonna teach\nyou something called bellows breath okay\nso if you need to blow your nose you can\nstart by blowing your nose I can't but\nso I want you to sit up straight and I'm\ngonna demonstrate once okay so what I'm\ngonna do is take 30 breaths I'm gonna do\n30 strong exhalations where I push the\nair out and then I'm gonna kind of have\nlike a super quick and shallow\ninhalation and then I'm gonna push it\nout again push it out again push it out\nout again so I'm gonna like basically\nforcefully exhale 30 times so I'll just\ndemonstrate and then let me know if you\nunderstand it it's gonna feel weird but\nI'll just start\nthat makes sense forcefully\nexcelling 30 times yeah we're out in it\nwithout inhale you have to inhale right\nokay exhale without inhaling yeah but\nthe emphasis is gonna be on the exhale\nso what I'm gonna ask you to do is let's\ntry five breaths where you kind of boom\nboom boom boom boom that's what I want\nyou to do so\nclose your eyes forcefully exhale good\nright so now we're gonna do it again\nthat's perfect\neven it'll out a little bit right so you\nwent boom boom boom boom boom\nso do try to make it even five more in\nthat order or just just making it even\njust make it even okay okay good\nso you're noticing that the breath is\ngonna go a little bit more shallow as\nyou go towards the end so now I want you\nto space them out just a little bit\ndon't go quite as fast five more a\nlittle bit slower okay good any history\nof asthma\nNo okay so now we're gonna do 15 okay\nand just focus on one two and go at that\npace that you just went oh girl\nokay I might've lost count that's okay\ndon't worry about it losing counts\nperfectly fine so how do you feel right\nnow do you feel silly or anything no I\njust feel fine okay so now what I'm\ngonna tell you to do now we're gonna\nreally learn the practice okay so now I\nwant you to go for 20 breaths and if you\nlose count actually you just you just\nbreathe I'm just gonna let you know it's\ngonna be about 20 breaths and I'll tell\nyou when to stop and what what the real\npractices is after the 20 breaths you're\ngonna enter a space in your mind that I\nwant you to just sit in and notice that\nlast breath after you're done with the\npractice you're naturally gonna take a\nbreath and just be completely in that\nbreath as much as possible okay\nthat's focus so you giving me the cue or\nI'm gonna give you the cue I'm gonna\ntell you when to stop and I want you to\nleave your eyes closed I'm gonna tell\nyou when to open your eyes again and\njust sit in the space after the practice\nand whatever comes up let it come up\ntry not to engage with your thoughts so\nif you have a thought that's fine but\nthen just like let it go and just focus\non the way that you feel okay okay it\nsounds kind of weird until you do it\nalright so close your eyes deep breath\nin and begin\ngood\nand now we're gonna begin again 20 more\nI'll keep count and I'll count down from\n5 4 3 2 1 to signal the end and keep\nyour eyes closed and sit with that last\nbreath let's begin again 5 4 3 2 1\nthat's it\none last time 20 breaths I'll count down\nfrom five go ahead and start five four\nthree two one\nnow I want you to take a deep breath in\nfor three seconds and out for three\nin four five and not four five\nand now in four seven and out for seven\nslow slow slow\nand you're ready open your eyes come on\nback to us tears\nyou\nwe feel\nfeel like I took a nap and\nwoke up why did you feel like you were\nasleep\nwhat is that\nit kind of felt similar to the tingling\nsensation of dreaming why do we why do\nwe describe meditation like sleep right\nit's kind of weird what was your mind\ndoing during that practice try not\nanything and what are you trying to not\nthink about anything or were you not\nthinking about anything\nI think that I would\nimagining like a background and that was\na what do you mean by imagining a\nbackground space\nlearn to like a view of a sunset just\nimagining backgrounds and thinking of\nnothing else okay yes I I think you know\nit's interesting because people often\nsay like what she said they use sleep or\ndreaming to kind of describe it it's\nbecause this our conscious mind which we\noperate with most of the time being on\nactually turns off for a little while\nand that's why we call it sleep you\nweren't to sleep but it feels like you\ntook a nap right there's some amount of\nrejuvenation but the most important\nthing is that it sounds like you stepped\noutside of your mind for at least a\nlittle while for moments here there and\nin my experience of this practice that\nfirst breath after the 20 exhalation is\nlike very very soothing calming and kind\nof like outside of mind I kind of get\nenveloped or wrapped up in that breath\ndoes that make any sense or your\nexperience could have been different\neveryone sort of experiences a different\nI think it was the birth after you told\nme to stop is the one where I felt the\nmost cuz I think the last couple of\nbreasts were it was like three seconds\nfive seconds seven seconds I'm thinking\nabout breathing in that amount of time\nmm-hm rather than just doing it\nnaturally yeah because as I direct your\nmind it turns on and then when it\nbecomes natural it can turn off and so I\ndon't know that this is the right\ntechnique for you but I think that other\nkinds of techniques could be very\ndifficult because I think your mind is\ngonna need lots of stimulation and is\nalso going to need to be quite exhausted\nto be calm so I think if I were to sit\nthere and ask you to observe your\nthoughts maybe that's gonna be difficult\nfor you\nso kebab potty or bellows breath is good\nbecause it's like something that's kind\nof active does that make sense you have\nthis period of intense activity which\nthen exhausts you and lets you enter\nthat state whereas if I tell you to go\nstraight to that state your mind is\ngonna wander through the\ntired huh yeah unless I'm unless I'm\ntired\nyou'd be surprised even if you're\nphysically tired or mentally tired\nsometimes the mind wanders more at those\ntimes but you can try it when you're\ntired okay so kind of focus exhaustion\nor expending the energy of the the mind\nor emptying your gas tank so that you\ncan sit in that emptiness is sometimes\nwhat works for people like you so give\nit a shot you can practice it I'd say\nthree to five minutes starting three to\nfive days a week if you want to be a\ntry-hard\nLeague of Legends pro then you can you\nknow grind it out five minutes a day for\nseven days a week\nI'll do it casually because I think that\nit's like one of those things where I\nguess so there's people are caffeine\naddicts I only drink one cup of coffee\nat most a day because I feel like I get\nthe most out of it sure sure or people\nthat are drinking alcohol they drink a\nlot that gring gain tolerance but the\nless tolerance you have the cheaper it\nis to get drunk sure you know I don't\nreally think meditation works like that\nand in fact I mean I think I think the\none thing that I really like is that it\nsounds like you're gonna make your own\nexploration for it which i think is\nexactly how you should do it okay any\nquestions for me before we kind of wrap\nup for the day any last thoughts no I\njust want to thank you for having me\nthat's been a very big eye-opener and I\ndidn't feel like I could feel this way\nfeel what way play\nmy point of view changed what instead of\nlooking at what's on the outside it\nreally is more on the inside I've been\nlooking for answers in the wrong places\nyeah and I think that's why so\nbeautifully put\ndyrus because I think the basic reason\nthat we don't move forward is because\nit's not because we suck right like and\nthis is the really sad thing is that\nwhen we look for answers in the wrong\nplaces and we don't find them and we\ndon't get better we start to think less\nabout ourselves right we start to think\nof ourselves as incompetent and lazy and\nyou know like but it's not it's not that\nyou're lazy it's just that you haven't\nbeen taught right you don't know where\nto look and like it's not your fault\nthat you're looking in the wrong place\nand it's not that you suck or anything\nlike that it's just you know if I if I\ngo fishing in a bathtub I'm never gonna\ncatch any fish but like that's how we\nlive our life as we go fishing in\nbathtubs every day and then we think\nthat we're incompetent fishermen it's\nlike it's just not how it works man yes\nI mean yeah not getting of all kinds of\nscenarios or you can catch a lot of\nstuff out of your bathtub but anyway but\nlisten man I'm glad that this has been\nhelpful for you I'm sorry I couldn't\nguide you a little bit more I mean I\nthink it is a big step to recognize that\nit's on the inside and I really hope I'm\nhappy to help you you know down the road\nor I really hope you can find someone to\nhelp you in that internal exploration\nand the crazy thing Dyer says I'm not\neven so sure that you're gonna need that\nmuch help because the last thing that\nI'd share with you is I think you and I\nthink a surprising number of people on\nTwitch on I mean I think we're all\nactually very intelligent and very\ncapable I think the idea that we even\nneed someone's help comes from the fact\nthat we've been fishing in a bathtub our\nentire life and not catching any fish\nmm-hmm and and all we need to do is\npoint you in the right direction and\nyour natural intelligence your natural\ntendency to like learn and grow and\nreflect and analyze and to put your\nminds to something and accomplish it all\nof those strengths are gonna support you\nin this way you they were just pointed\nin the wrong direction\nyou know I think it's good that you're\nseeing a therapist because I think\nthat'll facilitate things yeah I think\nlike all of this stuff I've been\nthinking about for I guess the last\nthree to four years but it's like oh\nmaybe it's this or that but by you doing\nthis it's really solidifies the fact\nthat yeah I really shouldn't be fishing\nin a bathtub I really I really shouldn't\nbe it's it really ties a bow on it like\nyou said well I'm happy to hear that\nbecause I was afraid but yeah man so\nlisten I wish you all the best of luck\nand you know keep us posted and if I can\nhelp you in some other way let me know\nand and you know if the meditation\ndoesn't work out for you or something\nlike that and you want a different\ntechnique just shoot me in DM or\nwhatever and and good luck man thank you\nthank you so much I appreciate it alone\nall right take care of man I have a good\none peace\nall right dyrus pong dyrus is great man\noh man I hope I hope I really hope\nthings work out for him Dyer's pod do I\nneed to tell you guys that y'all should\nmeditate along when I teach other people\nmeditation or is that kind of like deal\ndoes that understood at this point\nyou\nokay good understood I don't okay so\nlike yeah I mean so in the future you\nknow I just realized it I didn't tell\nyou guys to go along with it but y'all\nshould y'all should do it too I'll try\nto remember to say it okay so let's\nthink a little bit about let's kind of\ntry to recap so I think the key\ntakeaways from from listening to dyrus I\nthink is stuff that you know hopefully\ny'all caught as I was explaining it to\nhim so that so I think we have to be\nreally careful about how we solve\nproblems and we have to be careful about\nyou know the answers that we come up\nwith if they don't really fit and we\nshould be scientific because you know if\nyou think that I think burnout is a\ngreat example in it like we asked about\nburnout and it says okay it was because\nI was like a pro-gamer fine and then it\nwas a streamer fine and then I took\nthree months off and it helped a little\nbit it's like wait what you know it it's\nkind of like if I say like yeah why are\nyou why is your hair wet and it's like\nyeah because I'm in the shower and then\nsomeone else is like okay well why is\nyour hair wet it's like I'm it's because\nI'm in the bathtub and then even when I\ngo outside and it's a sunny day like I\nget rained on or something I had the\nanalogy fell apart in my mind but my\npoint is that like you know you should\nbe critical about the notions that you\nhave about where your problems come from\nand oftentimes we're we're thinking\nabout that and he absolutely meant just\nthat you know that's that's one one hell\nof an aborted fetus of an analogy let me\ntell you what it just didn't do it\nthanks for the donation\ndyrus and in Skull Kid so yeah sometimes\nsometimes thoughts come out is stillborn\nand I don't know how else to put it it's\njust sometimes dr. gay has brilliant\nrealizations and sometimes he has just\nreally frankenstone me and little\nhomunculus five children and that's what\nwe're here for right\nit's for the it's for the walls of oh\n[ __ ] man\nlyza age says dr. dr. k I wanted to\ndonate to honor the memory of my friend\nwho took his life four years ago\nyesterday I can't see the rest of it but\nyou know work is incredible and I I hope\nwell dude I'm sorry that your your\nfriend took his life four years ago can\nI just talk about that for a second I'm\ngonna say something that I I've been\nthinking a lot about suicide recently\nand I have a patient who killed\nthemselves about a year ago and I have\nanother patient who I'm afraid is gonna\nkill themselves in the next year or two\nand it it's kind of rough right like\nwhen we think about suicide and we think\nabout it's it's rough when people take\ntheir own life and you know the crazy\npart of me is like there's a there's a\npart of me and as especially as I think\nabout the people that I work with it and\nwe have this assumption that suicide is\nwrong and I don't think you guys should\nkill yourselves but I also feel like the\nmore that I understand people who\nstruggle it makes sense to me right if\nwe if we're being really honest about it\nlike some people suffer and the person\nthat I'm worried about now has been\nsuffering for years and they have tried\nso so hard to get better and they're\nthey're trying and like every day for\nthem is a struggle and it's not like\nevery day is a struggle like every day\nis a struggle it's like every day is\njust torturous it's like they wake up\nevery day and they're like in like they\njust it's like another day of torture\nand you know there are bright spots here\nand there they have some physical\nillness too which you know really\ndoesn't help they have bright spots here\nand there we're trying to figure out you\nknow how to help this person and when\nit's not really working like nothing's\nreally working and and and we have to\nacknowledge that that feeling is real\nright like I think sometimes it's a\nlittle bit ignorant for us to assume\nthat I mean I think I think it's just\nuncompassionate to say to everyone yeah\nyou should absolutely live I think you\nshould absolutely live but I think you\nshould be honest with yourself because I\ndo think that there's hope\nbut I think that it's also important to\nacknowledge that like some people really\ndo suffer and when I've worked with\npeople who are suicidal the crazy thing\nis like it's not you know it's a game\nthat they've been trying to play for\nyears and years and years and then like\neventually they just don't want to play\nit and that's not crazy\nright like I think this is one of the\ncraziest things about suicide as we\nthink about these people is mentally ill\nwhich sometimes they are but we kind of\nsay it like when we say that that's\ncrazy you're kind of invalidating like\nwhat they feel and what they think and\none of the things that I've learned as a\npsychiatrist is that being suicidal is\nnot crazy and and the really bizarre\nthing is that the more that I think\nabout suicidal people is not crazy but\ncompletely sane that's when you can help\nthem and that's where a actually comes\nfrom it's really bizarre it's not that\nhope like hope doesn't come from\nignoring your situation and pretending\nthat something else's can exist that's\nfantasy hope comes from starting where\nyou are fantasy is all about your mind\nwhere you want to end up right I can\nlook at the top of Mount Everest and I\ncan fantasize about when I reach the top\nbut it's not about where I am it's aware\nabout I imagine I can go and when you\ntell a suicidal person took that\neverything's gonna be okay you know\nthat's that doesn't feel real to them\nand what I really think that if you guys\nare struggling with suicidality you\nshould absolutely see a professional and\nand get help with that because it's not\nfair for you to have to deal with that\nalone and I do think you can get to the\ntop of Mount Everest\nbut I think getting to the top of Mount\nEverest and being free from your\nsuicidality and like being free from\ndepression and loving and enjoying life\nstarts with an acknowledgement that like\nyou were filled with despair and you\ndon't know where to go from here and\nthat's tough but I know it sounds\nabsolutely crazy but like I mean come on\nlike if you want to be a good\npsychiatrist you have to meet your\npatients where they're at right you\ncan't just pretend that their reality\ndoesn't exist you have to say hey man\nlike I get that you're suffering and I\nreally do see it like honestly it's not\ncrazy to me that you're thinking about\nkilling yourself because I've been\nworking with you for two years now and\nwe've been trying so hard and I feel\ndespair but I'm your [ __ ] treater\nlike you're the one who's actually\nliving it every day and I get that your\ndespair is absolutely real and I don't\nknow that even I have hope for you but\nyou know what I want to keep trying and\nI want you to keep trying because I\ndon't want you to give up but I don't\nblame you if you do because I do think\nthat we're getting somewhere like we're\nmaking a little bit of progress and we\nhave these high points and if you can\nhave one good day in two years then you\ncan have two good days in the next two\nyears\nbut let's be honest like if that's the\nway you feel that's the way that you\nfeel and if we want to fix something\nthat's broken let's start out by\nadmitting how [ __ ] broken it is right\nthat you need a new engine and you need\nnew tires and you need new axles and you\nneed new seatbelts and you need a new\nsteering wheel like fine like I get that\nthat feels impossible to you but if you\nare willing to give me a chance I'm\ngonna keep trying and I need your help\nto keep trying that's how I feel is that\nit's not it's not crazy right like the\nto call a suicidal person crazy is just\nnot helpful\nthese people aren't crazy they're\nsuffering this is their reality and and\nthis is what we need to understand like\nI think this is one of the biggest\nproblems that has happened with our\ngeneration is we call people like\nespecially men who kill themselves we\nsay it's a mental health problem it's\ndepression and that's like such a\n[ __ ] cop-out answer right like if\nsomeone is in so much despair that they\ndon't see a way forward and they feel\nburdened with like responsibility and\nyou know they feel like they can't do\nanything in life like that there's no\nway for it and they've been trying for\nso long and they've just they just can't\nthey have no answers and they've been\ntrying it for five years six years 10\nyears 12 years and then they kill\nthemselves and like oh yeah that was\nillness no it's not illness like that\nperson just needed a little bit of help\nneeded a little bit of a bright point\nneeded a little bit more support and we\ndidn't give it to them it's not illness\nit's like oh yeah it's a chemical\nimbalance in your brain not my [ __ ]\nfault that's it's really dangerous what\nwe've done to men especially because\nthey committed suicide more than women\nand I see this a lot with men is that we\nsaid oh that's a neurochemical imbalance\nlike it's not your fault man it's a\nneurochemical imbalance but you know\nwhat it's not my fault either because\nit's a neurochemical imbalance oh yeah\nit's a neurochemical imbalance it's no\none's fault it's just\nyou know it's like no one's fault and so\nwhen when no one's at fault no one needs\nto take responsibility and that's where\nI think we we've [ __ ] up basically as\na society with this whole generation\nwe've let all you guys down because what\nwe've done is we've labeled you with\nillness you said oh yeah you're\ndepressed it's a [ __ ] neurochemical\nimbalance boomers are like go see a\npsychiatrist and get an SSRI not my\n[ __ ] problem it's it's the biggest\ncop-out and I mean don't get me wrong\nlike I have a [ __ ] psychiatrist and I\nbelieve in mental OSA I'm not saying\nmental Luce isn't real\nI'm not like I prescribe medications so\nI think you guys should all definitely\ngo see psychiatrists and therapists and\nhelp with those things because we know\nthose tools can help my point is that\nthat's not the answer it's part of the\nanswer and that there's a whole other\npart of it there's a whole other part\nabout meaning and caring and like we\njust look at dyrus dyrus isn't burnt out\nbecause his coach made him play too much\neSports he's not burnt out because of\nyou guys\nhe's burnt out because no one listened\nwhen they needed to he's burnt out\ncuz he's a [ __ ] he's been a [ __ ]\ntop laner in his whole life like he says\nhis parents are divorced what I want to\nknow is like where was his mom when his\ndad threw a baseball into his face right\nlike what happened like why didn't\nsomeone stick up for him when the\nteachers put him in anger management but\njust think about that for a second right\nkids come up to you and bully you and\nthen you fight back and then they stick\nyour ass in anger management where the\n[ __ ] is his lawyer abandonment it's not\nfair and it's not right and then the kid\ngets labeled with anger management\nproblems it's an illness it's a\nneurochemical imbalance in your brain\nyou have anger management problems\nyou're just broken in here man\nit's not your fault but you're just\n[ __ ] broken and the normal kids are\nover here so learn how to manage your\nfeelings we're gonna teach you some\nuseful skills fine there's some useful\nskills\nI'm not saying an anger management is\nbad but I'm saying that like where we're\ndoing something very very dangerous by\nprotocol izing and pathologizing a lot\nof normal experience we're absolving\nourselves a responsibility right I still\nremember I talked about this with Anita\nthat you know it's kind of bizarre but I\nwas working with a guy who's in jail and\nthe reason he was in jail is because he\nstarted selling drugs at the age of 16\nbecause his three older sisters said\nthat what a man does is provide and you\nhave to provide for your older sisters\notherwise you're not a man so how the\n[ __ ] does a 16 year old provide for\nthree adult women since drugs and then\nhe gets suicidal only then I come in and\nI talked to him and like I talk\nfor a while and I realized man this guy\nis so [ __ ] a pill is not gonna fix\nthis this is not a neurochemical is\nthere a neuro come chemical balance\nabsolutely will medication help him but\nis it gonna fix it no this guy needs to\nunderstand that like you know he was not\ntaught that adult like 16 year old boys\nshould not be financially responsible\nfor three adults and you think about\nthis you go back to an Eden you just\nthink about what she was taught she\nloves her mother and her mother sounds\nlike she had very serious challenges and\nwe're not gonna blame her for that and\nat the same time what was in either time\nwhat were we taught\nwhy are kids mean because they're taught\nto be me what were you guys taught how\nwere you taught every [ __ ] time you\nyou go fishing in the bathtub you're\ntaught and then like society looks to\nyour parents like why haven't you\ngraduated yet like why did you fail out\nof college like why don't you have a job\nI haven't you moved out\n[ __ ] boomers are like these kids\nnowadays like they're not buying rings\nand they're not buying houses and they\ndon't know how to work like what what\nbirth [ __ ] man\nwhy do you think that is where do you\nthink we learned how to be lazy oh yeah\nwe learned it from the boomer generation\nbecause they had everything handed to\nthem\nthis bizarre do you think maybe maybe\ninstead of us being an entire generation\nit's an entire generation right you\nthink like maybe an entire generation\njust learned the same [ __ ] lesson\nwhich is completely the opposite of what\nthe generation before us learned it's\njust like we went 180 no generations\nkids learn what their parents teach them\noh it's it's not like we all grow up in\nAmerica speaking English an entire\ngeneration grows up speaking Swahili\nthat's not how it works we speak English\nbecause you [ __ ] guys speak English\nwe were taught our values because you\nguys taught it to us and the world is a\ndifferent place and that formula doesn't\nwork anymore\nbut no oh it's mental illness Oh mental\nillness yeah just absolve yourselves of\nall responsibility [ __ ] mental\nillness so yeah I mean I don't mean once\nagain don't get me wrong mental and this\nis real I think we should treat it\nseriously I think if you guys are\nfeeling suicidal you should get help but\nalso cut yourself a break because you're\nnot broken in here the reason that you\nfeel that way is completely legitimate\nand if you've been struggling for a\nwhile those struggles are real and if\nyou feel like you're in despair that's\nnot your fault it's our fault\nbecause life is a multiplayer game boys\nand girls\nit's a multiplayer game twitch is a\nmultiplayer platform it's all [ __ ]\nmultiplayer so how can you blame\nyourself like sure do you should you do\nmore absolutely but it's a [ __ ]\nmultiplayer game\nso get get the help that you need and\nmore importantly help out the person\nthat needs it right ask the question\nthat like people aren't willing to ask\nif you ask them when how are you doing\ntoday look actually look them in the eye\nbe like how are you actually doing today\nlet that question mean something an AoE\nhealing is not about like me you know\nspraying AoE on all of you guys I mean\nit is but like what a Oh a healing is\nreally about I think if you really look\nat it deeply it's about like you guys\nbecoming hewers to I mean all you have\nto do become a healer is like fix\nyourself and then it'll come naturally\nlike just fix yourselves I mean just fix\nyourself something just fix yourself\nmillennial [ __ ] boomers fix yourself\njust know well I'm saying like all you\nhave to do is fix yourself focus on\nyourself let you be your Karma let you\nbe your focus you can come first stop\n[ __ ] putting other people first\nright I'm talking to Anita you can come\nfirst sometimes like sometimes like 10%\nof the time you could come first\nyou can come first and you should you\nshould come first right cuz like you're\na [ __ ] entitled millennial Jenn's e\ntick tock YouTube twitch person you're a\nspecial snowflake like it's so weird\nlike we we I mean I'm all for special\nsnowflakes and that people can be\nnarcissistic but at the same time like\nso just think about this for a second\nwe're essentially like telling a\ngeneration of people that they should\ngrow the [ __ ] up\nno like take yourself seriously like\naccept responsibility for what you do\nright and accept responsibility for what\nyou do wrong and don't take\nresponsibility for what other people do\nwrong\njust because someone calls you a special\nsnowflake doesn't mean that you're doing\nsomething wrong\nlike should you be narcissistic\nabsolutely not should you focus on\nyourself absolutely should you give\nyourself that the credit that you're\nworth absolutely anyway all right so\nthank you guys very much and yeah so may\nis mental health awareness month and\nwe're doing a big push\nI saw low DPM gave us a bunch of gifted\nsubs man low DPM has been supporting our\nstreams since its inception in October\nand a huge thank you to you know man or\nwoman or anything in between that you\nare we really appreciate the support so\nhere's the thing we're training coaches\nbecause we want to spread this message\nfor each and every one of you who's out\nthere if you need to talk to someone\nlike me we're gonna try to train someone\nright so they're not like level 60\nhealers they're like level 20 30 40\nhealers depending on which one they're\npretty good they can they can raid with\nyou guys you know cuz you guys aren't\nroute level ready for levels and game\ncontent anyway y'all are twelve five and\nten and twenty so so this is what our\ncoaching program is about and that's why\nwe're raising money is [ __ ] insane\nthat in seven days we were eight to\nraise $10,000 I didn't know if we were\ngonna even raise like I didn't know I\nmean we've never made this much money on\nscreen before like nowhere close to this\nand it's it's amazing it's amazing and\nwe want to fix this right so like some\ntime ago doctor case showed up on Twitch\nand he started streaming and then people\nreached out for help and they were like\nand then I felt bad because I had to\nturn not just turn people away I\ncouldn't even answer my [ __ ] emails\nand so I was talking to a friend of mine\nand and she was like yeah like there's\nreally she said oh like either you\nduplicate yourself or there's nothing\nyou can do and she meant like you can't\nduplicate yourself because that's\nphysically impossible and so you\nshouldn't feel bad about it because\nyou're just one person she's trying to\nbe supportive and then I was like you\nknow what you're right either I\nduplicate myself or there's nothing I\ncan do in which case everyone gets let\ndown the world continues people continue\nto be suicidal and despaired and\nand then nothing I can do I did the best\nthat I could I did a good job\nI helped people every day for 40 hours a\nweek 50 hours a week 60 hours a week\nthat's enough and it should be right I\nshould be content with that but I'm not\nI'm not because I I mean when I was\nfailing out of college and all that [ __ ]\nand you know full of despair and I\nrealize that's probably sort of an\ninsult like it wasn't a thing back then\nbut I was a nerd that's what we called\nit and then nerds became cool and Game\nof Thrones became mainstream in gaming\nbecame mainstream and then the thing\nthat I was has become an insult\num which is an interesting and you know\nanthropological kind of analysis but and\nand so like you know cuz there are\npeople out there like me like you guys\nare like me like we're the same that's\nwhy this works right this works because\nlike I am you and you or me and that's\nthat's why I have hope because we're no\ndifferent and so I was like you know\nwhat you're right I'm gonna I'm gonna\nduplicate myself and people like oh\nthat's the same like you're so brilliant\nit's like no guys I don't think you guys\nunderstand I'm actually not that\nbrilliant and you guys get if I'm you\nyou or me that means we can duplicate\nthis we can clone this [ __ ] right it's\nno longer like an MMO\nit's an RTS and we're gonna build a\ncouple of like barracks and we're gonna\nstart churning out priests because I'm\nnot a hero\nI'm just a regular unit like we're gonna\ntake an RTS strategy it's not like a\nsingle-player game like it's not like\nZelda or your link running around and\nyou're like one of a kind\nit's like [ __ ] Warcraft 3 and we're\njust gonna churn out\nyou know infantry and we're gonna do it\ncuz I think that's good enough cuz I\nthink y'all are amazing and I have faith\nin y'all it's crazy I know oh my god\ntwitch chat is so toxic oh my god like\npeople gamers are so toxic new school\nshooters this that no I don't I don't\nbuy it\nthugs ugh absolutely zigzag absolutely\nso that's what our coaching program is\nthat's why we're raising money because\nwe also understand that a lot of y'all\nare broke but we also apparently on\nthat a lot of you guys are not and\nthat's pretty awesome that y'all are\nwilling to help and so we're gonna try\nto make things as affordable as possible\nand we're gonna make try to make things\nas fast as possible and as good as\npossible and so we're doing a bunch of\nHarvard's Andy stuff behind the scenes\nin terms of research study design and\nresearch and outcome measures and\nquality assurance and all that kind of\n[ __ ] because at the end of the day like\nhow do you determine whether a coach can\nactually help someone like how do you\nmeasure that how do you measure whether\nsomeone can actually be helped so a lot\nof this is gonna fund you know kind of\nlike our quality metrics and research\ndesign and stuff like that and we've had\nI've asked for a couple of people's help\nand thankfully I just tweeted it out and\na couple people from our community of\nvolunteered to help us and that's been\nactually fantastic and at some point we\nmay get like NIH grants and [ __ ] like\nthat but yeah so that's what we're doing\nand I'm just grateful for your help\nbecause here's the thing I can't do it\nright like cuz this is the thing you\nguys got to remember if I'm peon then I\ncan't save you so what I need is a bunch\nof other [ __ ] peons\nand we can do it together like when you\nif you guys have played war 3 or if you\nguys have played in RTS right you've got\na little stuck about Starcraft 2 it's\nlike if you've got like one SCV like one\nSCV can't do [ __ ] we need a bunch of\nSCV's and if we've got a bunch of SCV's\nthen we can do a lot of stuff and that's\nwhat healthy gamer is about is it if I'm\nan SCV you're an SUV and you can do it\ntoo that's what we're about and so thank\nyou for your help everyone who's been I\nsaw someone else gifted a bunch of subs\nso thank you for all of the monies and\nyeah so let's figure out\nokay so this Friday we have polka mein\nand I'm still confused about so we're\ngonna do drunk I guess drinking a ma\nwith dr. kay so I'm just gonna stream\nfor a while and we're gonna shoot the\n[ __ ] you guys can post questions on\nreddit and yeah so here's the link for\nthe reddit if you guys have so a couple\nof kind of outgoing things okay so if\nyou guys want you can post your\nquestions there and we're just gonna up\nvote down vote right so that you guys\ncan you know we'll see when we'll answer\nthose questions and then there's gonna\nbe drinking involved because we hit that\nstretch goal because stupid us we you\nknow I was like oh yeah like we can do\nlike drinking MA like no one's gonna\nwe're not gonna raise $4,000 so some\n[ __ ] like that\nand I think we've also hit the benchmark\nfor learning to play League of Legends\nand then we're gonna talk to polka mean\nand I'm still confused about you know I\nthink it depends on what she wants to do\nabout whether I'm inebriated or not\nbecause I feel like that's kind of a\ndick thing to do right to be drinking\nwhile I'm talking to someone I feel like\nit's not fair to them but anyway\nwhatever she wants to do and thank you\nvery much to her for offering to come on\nand support us and yeah so yeah so\nthat's gonna be Friday and we're excited\nand I think hopefully we've got some\nmore stuff coming up so Friday will be a\nlong stream it'll be a little bit more\nchill we may hop on discord for a while\nand talk although I've been burned by\nthat too a chat\nfor those of you who have seen the thing\nthat was were there for what has been\nscrubbed from the internet when like\n7,000 people swarm into discord and\nsomeone realizes that they can be a\ntroll and and I mean I don't I can't\nreally blame you for that because I was\nlaughing on the inside but please don't\ndo it again can we be clear about that\nlike don't do that again and also I can\nappreciate you for who you are man I\ndon't I\nblame you for it but I also forgive you\nfor it and please don't do it again\nyeah that's life so thank you guys very\nmuch I'm gonna go ahead and sign off\ntoday because I've got an appointment in\nabout 20 minutes and love you guys you\nknow we've got a lot of good stuff\ncoming I'm gonna take next week I'm\ngonna stream and stuff but I'm not\nhaving any of my clinical appointments\nand stuff and I'm gonna focus on\nbuilding stuff for y'all because people\nhave asked me for things so I'm gonna\njust take a week off where I'm gonna\nlike write and work on my books and\nmaybe make webinars and all that kind of\nstuff we've got webinars and stuff\nplanned the other thing is that you guys\ncan pop on our discord if you guys want\na goal added to this you guys should let\nme know what that is so you guys can\npost suggestions and if we're cool with\nthat\nyou know we'll do it we can add those\nkinds of stretch goals and I think we\nhit our 9000 which is a stream on lying\nwhich will probably be like a bonus\nstream well I'll talk to you guys about\nwhy people lie why we lie why we lie to\nourselves how to detect lying and\nsomeone else I can't it's not like a\nmachine that doesn't work like that but\nto understand what goes on in someone's\nmind when they lie and why they lie and\nso that for you to be able to you know\nsee if you can see that going on in\ntheir mind then you can sort of deduce\nthat they could be lying or maybe lying\nor probably our line so we'll we'll\nwe'll talk about that\nso other thoughts you know a little\nstuff that's a little bit off script is\nlike I was thinking about doing\nsomething about sociopathy because a lot\nof people asked about that or other\ntopics that you guys want me to just\nkind of talk about we can do that so\nthank you guys very much\nand best of luck and stay safe and if\nyou guys are really struggling with\nsomething like suicidal
