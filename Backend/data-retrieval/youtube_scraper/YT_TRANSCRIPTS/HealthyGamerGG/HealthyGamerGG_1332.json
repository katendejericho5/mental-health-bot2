    "transcript": "the funny thing is that we were gonna\nstart fundraising today but it turns out\nthat we have actually I mean so we had a\ncouple of goals so let me just see what\nthey are real quick so we we had a\ncouple of why milestones for fundraising\nand the milestone so this is what we\nkind of decide is that for all of our\nfundraising milestones we want them to\nbe like fun things right so I and they\nshouldn't be things that I'm gonna do\nanyway so it's not like\nso we're thinking about teaching about\nparticular topics we may add those if\nyou guys want but like the the goal is\nto do things that are kind of fun and\nengaging and that we don't normally do\nand so we had a couple of goals like\nlike an AMA so not really Q&A I mean it\ncan be whatever you guys want so if you\nguys want to ask me personal questions\nif you guys want to do like sort of a\nmarathon Q&A kind of stream if it want\nlike it can be whatever you guys want so\njust you know anything is kind of fair\ngame there's an LSF react a livestream\nfail react stream and I don't understand\nwhat that means exactly like I don't\nknow if I'm gonna be reacting to a clip\nor I'm just browsing LSF I don't\nunderstand if it's like me or other\npeople or what I'm confused about that\nbut anyway I don't have to know what it\nis I just apparently have to do it and\nso that is so that so we had a couple of\ngoals right so like we were thinking at\nfive hundred dollars and fifteen hundred\ndollars or whatever and it turns out\nthat Lilly Pichu awesomely gave us like\nthree grand so she has single-handedly\nlike funded you know just a gigantic\namount of stuff and has gotten our first\nfew milestones met so a huge thank you\nto Lilly you know we all think that\nLilly is awesome and we really support\nher and we hope that Lilly one is is\nreally taking care of Lilly too and I\nthink that that whole revelation from\nthat stream I think has been really\nhelpful for me to to really\nconceptualize people is like virgin air\nversion B and so gigantic thank you to\nLilly for being so supportive and then\nlike funding us our coaching program\nbecause then we can coach people and\nhopefully help other people so\ngigantic thank you to lily Pichu\ngigantic thank you to her community for\nbeing such an awesome community and like\ngetting along with us and supporting us\nthere like wholesome and positive so\nlike I think that it's really\ninteresting because watching Lily's\ncommunity and interacting with Lily's\ncommunity you can kind of see how like\nparticular people grow particular\ncommunities right so like and it's\nreally amazing to be able to see what\nLily can create for her community and\nwhat her community can create for her\nand like how twitch is not about\nindividuals it's about like a symbiotic\nrelationship and so we're very very\ngrateful and yeah Lily's awesome and I\nhope that she's happy and that she finds\ntrue love and maybe one day we'll check\nin with her about that and yeah so thank\nyou guys very much for the gifted subs\nwe greatly appreciate it and we are\ntrying to raise money for this so today\nso yeah so like just to kind of recap\nwe're raising money for our coaching\nprogram which is set to hopefully launch\nactually in May so we want to start\nhelping you know our people with actual\ncoaches these are all coaches that I've\ntrained and we've been running our beta\nso our beta is basically finished now\nand our beta looks really good so we\ncollected a bunch of data and we're\noptimistic which is why we're gonna move\nforward with the coaching program and\nwe're also gonna try to you know we know\nthat people aren't may not necessarily\nhave money to even pay for coaching\ncoaching is gonna be like relatively\ncheap but we're trying to pay all of our\ncoaches sort of a living wage and we're\nalso trying to you know make it\naccessible and so it really helps to\nhave some funding support for people who\ncan't afford coaching so we're trying to\nyou know it's nice to be able to raise\nmoney so a couple of things so thank you\nguys very much for all of your donations\nand subs and all that kind of good stuff\nso we're gonna be doing I guess we're\ngonna be releasing my crying in the\nshower playlists but I think I've to\ntell you guys a story about this okay\nfor a few minutes so last year in August\nso in August of 2019 why is everyone\nsaying easy dodge what am i dodging am i\ndodging something\nokay\nso anyway so last August we had our\nfirst retreat and this was back when\nlike healthy gamer was like smaller and\nso we were all like you know we were all\nhanging out in Yosemite National Park at\na cabin and we would go like hiking and\nstuff and we talked about our minds that\nwe talked about how to communicate with\npeople and all the stuff that we\nnormally do on so we're just doing it in\nperson\nand we were like cooking together and\nlike hiking together and like we would\ntell ghost stories and look at stars and\nwatch bats and things like that\nother cool thing about our retreat is we\nall brought our gaming stuff so like we\nbrought gaming laptops and things like\nthat and so you know the goal is not to\nlike pull you guys away from technology\nthe goal of the retreat was actually to\nhave everyone bring their technology and\nfor us to be able to explore okay do we\nwant to spend time gaming or do we want\nto spend time doing other stuff and\nlet's not try to restrict gaming let's\ntry to figure out can we find something\nthat is enjoyable and fun to do that we\nfeel naturally motivated to do so that\nour our gaming equipment gathers dust it\nturns out that it did and we actually\nhad a couple of people who for example\nwe're like playing mobile games\nthroughout the day and we kind of talked\nabout that and how other people felt and\nit was like one of these mobile games\nwhere you're kind of like grindy so like\nyou have to tap a few buttons every 15\nminutes and then a lot of it's on\nautopilot and it was fascinating anyway\nso we were at the retreat and we started\ntalking about things that normal people\ntalk about like what kind of music do\nyou like and I guess some people were\nwere surprised to discover that I really\nlike super super sad music and like yeah\nso like I had this what I call crying in\nthe shower playlist and so then we were\ntalking about feelings and how it's good\nto feel feelings and how I like to\nlisten to sad music because it makes me\nfeel sad because deep deep deep down I\nknow I'm positive and wholesome and all\nthat [ __ ] but deep deep down I have this\nvery deep and profound sadness which I\nkind of like so I think that when I was\nlike struggling in life I felt that kind\nof like you know I don't people I don't\nthink people use this term very much and\nanymore but I was super emo and it was\nnever really quite a goth but look like\nwas definitely moving in that direction\nand so was super emo and super sad and\nso\nyou know a lot of people were listening\nto upbeat music and when it was like my\nturn I would play like super super sad\nsongs and I still like satin songs like\neven to this day you know when I when I\nlisten to them I enjoy feeling sad which\nis a strange feeling but yeah so we're\ngonna release our my crying in the\nshower playlist and so the joke from the\nretreat it was kind of an inside joke\nwhich was like yeah I really enjoy\ncrying in the shower and listening to\nmusic and I spend a few minutes every\nmorning just like being in the shower\nand being sad by myself dodged what am I\ndodged what what's dodged the Oh should\nI be thanking people for subbing thank\nyou guys very much okay let's do that so\nthank you skaros for gifting all the\nsubs man we're very grateful and I'm\nsorry that we're dodging we're not\nmeaning to dodge\nokay Oh dodging the so you guys didn't\nget the gifted son got it got it got it\ngot it so that means that I'm always\ndodging right I have a 100% dodge rate\nbecause I don't receive any and as the\nperson who runs the channel so I case oh\nwe're gonna do the crying in the shower\nplaylist we're gonna do the LSF react\nstream and then I guess we're doing the\ndrinking it we're not going to do the\nregular when we go straight to the\ndrinking am a stream okay so I so this\nis the other thing that my team has told\nme apparently and if you guys are happy\nwith this let me know we're gonna do\ntext-to-speech which I've been told that\nlike I guess we've been avoiding that\nthis entire time because it's true take\nknow so so I I think what we're gonna\nwe're not gonna do a heroin am a stream\nthat is dangerous and you guys should\nnot do heroin and this may be a good\ntime to do our disclaimers so just to\nremind you that my name is dr.
