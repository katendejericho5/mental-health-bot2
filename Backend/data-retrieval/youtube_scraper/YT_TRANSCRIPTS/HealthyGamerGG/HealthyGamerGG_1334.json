    "transcript": "all right so I guess I will actually\nstart I you should get used to being a\nbit more responsible like you and so yes\nthis is for educational purposes only\nand so yeah if you have a problem please\ngo see your doctor but yeah thank you\num so my name is will Co is uh a lock\nand yeah I'm 40 years old and you know\nwe met when I was in my psychiatry\nresidency about so I started at Harvard\nabout eight years ago nine years ago and\nat that time you know I I was raised\nJehovah's Witness and so I was not into\ndrugs I had only smoked pot about five\ntimes in my life and I was a believer\nyou know and what we were taught which\nwas that psychedelics were dangerous\nthey were illegal and they were\naddictive and you know and so I got into\nthe mental health field I thought I was\ngoing to be an academic researcher and\njust just in case anyone's wondering I\ndid not have long hair I did not have\npiercings I did not have jewelry back\nthen I think a lot can in for that and I\nyes I was this traditional guy who was\nlike going through the hoops of life and\nbeing like I'm gonna be you know if I\nget all these degrees and I go to all\nthese great institutions I'll be happy\nand I kind of hit like a low the second\nbig low points of my life and I was like\nI achieved all these things that I told\nmyself I wanted to achieve and I was\nstill not happy and so yeah I went into\ntherapy for the first time meaning\nreceiving my own therapy and um the\nstory is that then I started doing\npsychoanalysis and I was analyzing my\ndreams and my childhood can you just\nbest explained us real quick about\npsychoanalysis is OSs psychoanalysis is\na form of psychotherapy it's kind of the\nmost traditional where you're like\nlaying on a couch and telling your\ntherapist about what's going on\nbasically and so my childhood best\nand kind of did the opposite of me after\nhigh school where he decided to not go\nto college you just worked and was in a\nband and partied but after the financial\ncrisis in a 8:09 he ended up deciding to\ngo back to school so he's going back to\nschool into college his first year of\ncollege as I'm like having this like\nlife crisis at my in my early thirties\nand he gets introduced to psychedelics\nand one in particular called DMT and it\nconvinced me to even read about it he\nwas like DMT is what's made in the brain\nand it's what causes us to dream so I\nwas like what and so then I went at our\nlike our little search engine and I\ngoogled this and I searched it and I'm\nlike oh my god it's true like all these\ngovernment labs in the 50s and 60s were\nputting most of their psychiatric money\nand research into psychedelics I'm like\nthat was the first time where I'm like\nwait does the government lie to us or or\nyou know or they not at least only\nalways truthful and so you know I would\njust say to you that within you know\nanother six months a year from that I\nwas just so curious and I connected to\nthe psychedelic research community and\ngot involved in the training and so I've\nbeen trained by maps so for those of you\nguys that don't know Maps is the\nmultidisciplinary Association for\npsychedelic studies and they're the main\nfunders of the psychedelic research it\nwas founded by a guy named Rick Doblin\nand it has completely 100% funded\npsychedelic research from young\ndonations and just an interesting tidbit\nas they succeed to be you know a\nprescribed Abul medication it'll be the\nonly the second time in history a\nmedication was brought to the market by\ncompletely by donations and so it's a\npretty big deal what's the first game\nyeah\ndo you know plan B which is the plan B\nis the medication\nyeah which which will you know allow\nsomeone to prevent in a pregnancy the\nmorning it's like the morning-after pill\nis what people call it interesting\nand so yeah that's kind of in so yeah\nonce I discovered psychedelics and read\ninto them I just got more and more into\nit and then I was able to luckily have\nan experience taking MDMA legally in a\ntherapeutic setting in 2017 which was\nlife-changing to me and this was part of\nthe training for maps for therapists and\nI'm happy to talk about that and it's a\nbeautiful thing because I can then talk\nabout doing this psychedelic without you\nknow saying oh my god I did something\nillegal and get in trouble as a doctor\nand I think education is very important\naround psychedelics I've also had a\nnumber of experiences legally with\nketamine as well as a treatment which i\nthink is a wonderful treatment works\nvery different I've also had experiences\ntaking ayahuasca in Peru where it's\nlegal as well and so I can talk about\nthose experiences these days you know I\nhave a clinical practice in Southern\nCalifornia and Los Angeles\nI am a big believer in public education\nI think everyone should know about these\nmedicines no had about how to use them\nresponsibly and no note that I call them\nmedicines I think when they're in use\nfor for healing you know I think it's\nthe most powerful thing we have in our\ndefinitely in the mental health\npsychiatric bracket in terms of\ntreatment and so it's very exciting to\nbe involved in this stuff and I provide\nketamine assisted therapy for many of my\nclients so that's that's the only fully\nlegal if you want to call it therapy\nwith psychedelics that's available in\nthe US right now without being in a\nclinical trial and yeah and I provide\nwhat people call like psychedelic\nintegration therapy which means like if\nsomeone has gone out to a retreat or has\ndone illegal underground therapy I try\nto help them through the in process the\nexperience so it can be you know\nhopefully a healing one for them\nsure awesome man so thank you so much\nfor that introduction so generally\nspeaking when people come on stream like\nI'll ask them sort of questions about\ntheir personal life and and their\njourney and things like that I you know\nand since you're coming on sort of as an\nexpert I could ask you more personal\nquestions like I was curious about a\ncouple of things that you said\num one was that that was the second that\nwas like your you had a myth like a\nsecond life crisis and so I'm curious\nabout what your first thought was and\nthen there's also like more kind of\nexpert oriented questions about like\nwhat's the difference between DMT LSD\npsilocybin ketamine ayahuasca ibogaine\nlike you know like and and what do you\nthink so kind of like more treatment\noriented questions or expert questions\nor like like sort of like what your\njourney has been more specifically what\ndo you do you feel like we should go in\na particular direction\nsure I've just got to say something\nbecause or else that's gonna distract me\nbut I just opened up this twitch thing\nI've never been on it before and it's\nlike trivial like interesting interface\nbetween all this stuff it's it's really\ncool yeah anyway I guess that's what\nmakes me a Boomer I'm curious creameries\nbut I'm assuming it just means I don't\nknow yeah I don't know a lot of things\nif you're a Boomer a Boomer is someone\nwho is respected and loved by the twitch\ncommunity basically yeah so twitch is\ninterface so so let me just explain one\nor two things about twitch so twitch I\ndon't know exactly how many people we\nhave watching right now we can just look\nreal quick okay so we've got about 2400\npeople watching and then twitch also has\na chant which means that there's there\nlike people that are posting things in\nchat like there they may be posting\nreactions or questions things like that\nand that's how we know whether twitch\nchat is happy with what we're doing or\nsad what we're doing I try to steer\nclear of looking at numbers or twitch\nchat while I'm actually streaming unless\nI'm like interacting with them like\nanswering questions or whatever so right\nnow let's see what they're saying well\nit's a boom right I don't have glasses I\ncan't read anyway okay fantastic see he\nunderstands what a rumor is he's one of\nus it'll fit in it'll fit right in he's\nhe can feel the boom Earnest inside but\nso what do you think well do you want to\ndo you want to talk like a little bit\nmore\nlike about your personal journey or do\nyou want to like maybe start with more\nquestions or like about more details\naround different kinds of treatment and\nwhere you think the field is going sure\nI'm happy to talk about you know I I\nlove talking about stories you know I\nthink stories bigger picture is what\nleads to healing you know could I sit\nhere and talk to you about the you know\nthe brain MRI studies with LSD and you\nknow that that you know the default mode\nnetwork is suppressed during MDMA\ntherapy sure but but I think what people\nreally care about is why these things\nwork so much better than your you know\nSSRIs Prozac etc and so I think stories\nreally matter in terms of what you know\nwhat happens to people tell us and how\nto heal for sure so you know my my first\nyou know big life crisis I would say was\nin my late 20s I was a medical student\nat UCLA and my dad had gotten diagnosed\nwith with cancer in in the middle of my\nPhD time and so you know that was a\nfirst big wake-up call of like you know\nmy dad was healthy it wasn't something\nthat was expected and it was like you\nknow that dreaded phone call as a young\nman like you know the moment we learned\nthat we died it's like oh [ __ ] we\nrealized oh my god our parents aren't\ngonna be around and so I got that\ndreaded phone call and then I was you\nknow living in DC at the time working in\na laboratory and it was just a big low\npoint and you know my dad ended up\nliving about two years and he ended up\ngetting like rounds of chemo and blood\ntransfusions and but it really was ended\nup impacting my mental health and at\nthat time I'll say so I didn't actually\ndecide to become a psychiatrist until\nthe end of medical school which you know\nwe don't have to get into the details\nbut I at this point in my life like\nmental health was not on my radar I've\nnever been to therapy like I didn't even\nthink about you know I didn't know what\npsychology was or Freud really so I I\njust got\ndown and then unconsciously because I\nwas like hiding my feelings and didn't\nknow how to process them I ended up\ndeveloping this really bad flying phobia\nwhich lasted two years\nthere was a two-year period where I did\nnot fly whatsoever\nand it was really embarrassing to me at\nthe time when I was I was actually\nfinishing my PhD towards the end of my\ndad's life when he was dying and I\nactually ended up taking a boat across\nthe Atlantic because I was too scared of\nflying and then when I got to New York I\ntook a train across the country to go\nback home because I was too scared so\nthe flying phobia had just taken out\nalkalete hold over my life and and so\nyeah that was you know my first big\ncrisis and then but you know like I\ndidn't know how to heal and so I was\njust like okay power through keep on the\ngoals like okay I graduated then I got\ninto Harvard and I'm like okay that's\nwhat you know it was a few years later\nafter that where I hit my low because I\nwas just like I'm putting hoop after\nhoop after hoop in\nwhen I sure yeah sorry go ahead I just\nswitched to these two terms I call them\nperceived values versus true values to\nme true values are the things that we're\nborn with that we you know the things\nthat we want to how we want to express\nourselves in our lives what we want to\nspend our lives doing and then I think\nof person where it's like culture\nreligion family you know capitalism\ntells us X Y Z this is what you're\nsupposed to do um this is what you're\nsupposed to do in life and then I think\nthis you know in perceived values can\nbecome so ingrained that they seem true\nand so what I realized for myself was\nthat I was all these coops that I had\nput in front of myself they weren't\nmaking me happy because that's not what\nI actually wanted to be doing I didn't\nwant to be a professor and how did you\nrealize that\nwell it's interesting cuz I'm actually\nfast forwarding quite a bit so I mean\nthe actual realization of that didn't\ncome until the end of residency which\nyou know when I knew you which was\naround 20 2014 and so it was through\ntherapy it was really through looking at\nmyself looking at my life so how would\nit be all how on earth can we understand\nlike what how does one develop a phobia\nof flying and like what happened with\nthat because you said it lasted about\ntwo years so I presume that you still\ndon't have it like what's your\nunderstanding of what happened there so\nwith you know I I think it was about you\nknow so I actually flew home when my dad\nwas diagnosed when he collapsed and that\nwas from DC to LA and again it was that\ndreaded time like went right on kayak or\nwhatever and I'm like let's get the next\nflight out and I remember in my mind\nmeaning I don't know objectively if it\nwas true that it was like the bumpiest\nworst flight I'd ever been on and when\nwe were in the middle of you know the\nflight across the u.s. very bumpy and\nthe pilot went on the you know on the\nintercom and he was like oh sorry there\nwas a plane that flew too close above us\nand I\njust like are you [ __ ] kidding me\nlike like you guess that happens like\ncome on guys and then so I you know so\nsorry I'm just like getting distracted\nbut it's which thing is so that's\nfascinating I'm gonna get it not look at\nit don't look at it will resist what how\nare you looking at on your phone yeah\nit's in it's on it's not on life Isis I\ndon't even know what these words mean so\nwhat happened was then you know I I\nstarted associating right instead of\nletting you know we're going we're\ncovering a lot right now but you know\nwhat we want in a healthy situation you\nknow when we experience a trauma is that\nor you know what we call a trauma is\nthat we want to be able to fully express\nthe emotion physically it's like if you\nif you have a clear glass wall and a\nbird flop eyes into it right and it\ncollapses it's done for a second it gets\nup it shakes it like chirps and then it\nmoves on with its life then it starts go\nhunting worms again it doesn't sit there\nand it's like mmm ruminate II oh [ __ ]\nlike I've gotta look out for for other\nglass now for the rest of my life it\nlike it has the experience it shakes it\noff and it moves on and our culture you\nknow I think of six basic emotions we\ndon't know we can get into it later if\nit matters but we have a cluster of\nemotions that we have started calling\nthat we've started judging as being weak\nright and to me those are sadness fear\nand shame it's like you know the if\nyou're feeling those they're weak you're\nnot a man and so we don't get that\nopportunity for catharsis right because\nwe're told from a young age boys don't\ncry hide it you know and so then we\nstart locking in all of these\nexperiences in our body\nyear after year experience after\nexperience and they build up and and\nthat has to go somewhere and so you know\nwhat happened was that I had all this\nstuff all these feelings about my dad\ndying and I didn't know where they\nexpressed them I didn't have people\nthat would listen that could listen the\nway I needed them to listen and so it\nbuilt up in and then so the psyche the\nunconscious like tries to put that\nsomewhere right and that's somewhere\nsometimes is you know depending on your\ngenetics and your upbringing\nlooks like alcoholism or it looks like\nan eating disorder it looks like PTSD\nyou know for me that cluster of things\nat that moment of my life\nlooked like a phobia and and I prefer to\nthink of mental illness in these\ncategories of just like again because of\nyour unique traits it expresses this way\nbut I don't believe in like I used to\nbelieve but I don't anymore that there's\nthese like hard evidence DSM diagnosis\nthat like are genetically predisposed\nand you can never be healed from them\nlike psychedelics have shown me that\nlike almost without exception the\nparadigm of mental illness that we have\ncreated is especially the categorization\nis a lot of baloney you know and I think\nthat you know we can do really deep\nhealing by revisiting you know these\npast experiences and so that's where\npsychedelics come in right because\npsychedelics you know what I'm basically\nsaying is we need to allow the emotion\nand the the movement to come to the\nsurface so that we can deal with it so I\nlike to think about psychedelics as\nevocative therapies as opposed to\nsuppressive therapy right because like\nhe's impressive you can even see that in\nour in our in our the categories of our\nmedications the psychiatric medications\nantidepressants anti-anxiety what are\nthose say anti sadness aunty fear if\nyou're feeling something numb it down I\ndon't want to see it\nright and we as a mental health you know\nfield like that's that's we're not even\ntaught how to deal with increased\nemotions we're taught how to suppress\nthem and that's where psychedelics that\nis why they're so effective like we're\nseeing you know MDMA and psilocybin have\nboth been lit labeled and we can talk\nabout what this means in a second the\nFDA has labeled them as breakthrough\ntherapies which means they get like an\naccelerated approved\nthrough the FDA that's the only two\ntimes in history that that designation\nhas been used for a mental health a\nprimary mental health condition and so\nyou're seeing we're seeing rates of like\n60 70 plus percent of people healed\nafter one to three treatments with a\npsychedelic with psychotherapy in\nbetween and like you know as well as I\nthat that those numbers are like unheard\nof yeah in psychiatry you know so a good\nnumber in psychiatry is like 30 30 35\npercent yeah you know yeah so that's\nthat's crazy man you know it's so\ninteresting so I think a lot of why\nwe've grown is because our my personal\napproach is like very aligned with yours\nso I think of I don't think a mental\nillness is an illness like I don't think\nthese things are broken within people I\nthink these are adaptive mechanisms that\nhave kind of gotten out of control so\nthe way that I understand anxiety for\nexample is we all have a future\nfunctioning capable of capacity within\nour brain to predict problems in the\nfuture right like that's what our brain\nis designed to do and if we anxiety is\nsimply that future problem predicting\ncapability like gone out of control and\nlike you know even depression or I\nstruggle with some things like\nschizophrenia which in my clinical\nexperience have been like more like an\nillness like I have trouble seeing sort\nof the value of that especially with\nsome of the negative symptoms like\ncognitive you know cognitive problems\nand things like that but I think for a\nlot of these kind of neurotic conditions\nor feelings of like depression or\nanxiety or whatever like they're they're\njust our bodies and minds way of trying\nto express something and we don't let\nourselves express it and a lot of the\nwork that we do on stream the reason\nthat we kind of ask personal questions\nand I think part of the reason that\nwe've grown is that we see a lot of\ncatharsis like on on stream so we talked\nto people we sort of evoke emotions we\nask important questions and then people\noftentimes have catharsis which i think\nis a good word to\ndescribe it where they will sort of have\nlike this emotional moment and the other\nthing by the way we'll just in terms of\nlike things that we were taught like you\nknow I remember working with\npsychoanalytic supervisors and stuff\nlike that and then them talking about\ntherapy is like a really long-term thing\nlike patient had a breakthrough after\nlike two two-and-a-half years and then I\nremember thinking is like like a\nresident you know because I'm I'm the\none who's being taught so I'm not an\nexpert I'm like what the [ __ ] were you\ndoing for the first two years like if\nthey had a breakthrough it like three\nyears and one of the things that I've\ncome to believe is that like I don't\nthink that our paradigms as well as like\nmedication I don't think that you know\npsychotherapy needs to be this long and\nprotracted process that that you know\nlasts years and years I think that you\ncan use certain tools so I personally\nuse meditation to evoke a lot of emotion\nand and like when you empty your mind\nlike whatever's down there so you have\nthis suppressive mechanism right that\nkeeps all these emotions down and then\nwhen you empty your mind it creates a\nvacuum and whatever's down below comes\nup on its own and and so that's been\nsort of my personal experience and also\nmy experience teaching meditation of my\npatients is that like it accelerates the\nrate of therapy which I doubt it\naccelerates it at the same rate as is\npsilocybin and things like that but you\nknow I mean I I'm aligned with what\nyou're saying but yeah so a few things\nyou know I on this anxiety piece which i\nI've come to as a meditator I think you\nyeah I'd be curious to get your thoughts\non this but I've started essentially\ngrouping you know what we call mental\nillness into two places anxieties or\ndepressions because what we want we what\nwe want to be in theory is fully present\nwe want to be in flow right right I\nimagine you know when we're engaged like\nif we're on a on the first date when\nwere you only like the person or if\nyou're playing a game and you're really\ninto it you're not thinking about stuff\nright you're just in flow or where you\nare and so I like to think of anxieties\nof as the category meaning I'm not\npresent because I'm living in the future\nI'm worried about something\nor depression I'm not present because\nI'm worried about something in the past\nthat happened and interestingly I think\nwith with psychedelics what we're give a\nlot of thought to it is are certain\npsychedelics better for certain things\nand we'll get to that and I'm glad you\nasked that in the beginning and you know\nI like that you mentioned meditation you\nknow I think the things that\npsychedelics facilitate memories\nemotions etc that we need to bring up to\nheal they're only doing something that\nwe are completely capable of doing\nanyway like the human body the psyche\nthe Spirit is completely capable of\ndoing that type of work it just is\nfacilitated by something like\npsychedelics but it can also be\nfacilitated by a meditation or it can be\nfacilitated by holotropic breathwork etc\netc yeah great those are the two points\nI wanted to make so first of all I agree\nwith you completely so i intent alil 'no\nsin to future-oriented and past oriented\nwhich I call worry and reverent which I\nI mean no surprise that it's basically\nexactly what you said that that because\nI even try to in my language I found\nthat it's useful to step away from\nanxiety and depression\nbecause they are medicalize terms so I\nuse worry and regret so if you look at\nlike literally if so I a lot about this\nstuff so if you guys have watched its\nown stream like literally the cool thing\nabout anxiety is that like if you look\nat any anxious thought it is it is when\nyour mind is not in the present it's in\nthe future and some people even say well\nI have anxieties about the past but if\nyou really tunnel down into that what\nthey're really doing is something\nhappens like oh I went to a party\nyesterday I looked dumb so people won't\nlike me and won't invite me next time\nand they'll think that that's like\nworrying about the past but it's not\nreal technically it's not worrying about\nthe past if you really pay attention to\nyour thoughts you're worried about the\nfuture consequences of a past action and\nso all worry is future-oriented mind and\nall regret is past oriented mind and\nliterally if you can be in the present\nwith your mind anxiety cannot exist in\norder for anxiety to exist you must be\nthink\nin the future and so part of what I\nthink is really powerful is like people\ndon't realize that like they think about\nanxiety is something that you have to\nyou know grapple with and treat and and\nthings like that and my my general\napproach to anxiety is twofold one is to\ndig into the underlying things that make\nyou anxious and this kind of goes to\nwhat you were talking about about like\nyou know there's a certain amount of\npersonal stuff and there's a certain\namount of like environmental stuff that\ncauses mental illness to manifest in a\nparticular way so in the Eastern system\nof Vedic psychology they talk about\nthese things called some scars which are\nessentially like unprocessed traumas and\nthat some scars manifest as particular\nthings they're like they're kind of like\nyou know subconscious psychological\nconflicts I think like the psychoanalyst\nkind of had a sense of this and so you\ncan kind of work on the root or what you\ncan actually do is change the function\nof your mind in the moment which is\ncompletely ignoring the root and\nliterally turn off the anxiety by\nfocusing on the present and when I work\nwith people with like procrastination\nand things like that like you can sort\nof deal with the subconscious origin of\nyour fears which is a more long-term\nprocess and in the moment you can learn\nhow to like literally shock off or\novercome procrastination by\nunderstanding like the mechanism of how\nmind works but anyway I'm with you a\nhundred percent in terms of like your\nfoam formulation it's like I think great\nand I also agree with you by the way and\nthis is something I'm curious about\nthat you know one thing that I realized\nsome time ago is that any substance that\nwe put into our body is only capable it\ndoesn't create anything it only\nactivates things right so if we think\nabout our alcohol like that activates\ngaba receptors like cannabis activates\ncannabinoid receptors it doesn't create\nsomething new in our brain it only turns\noff or on what's already there and so\nany experience that you can have through\na psychedelic it's my belief and this is\nkind of where I'm curious that you can\nattain something similar through\nmeditation and I know that you know when\nI talk to people who have had psychosis\nhas had like psychedelic experiences I\ncan relate to them through my personal\nspiritual experiences which sound varies\nin some ways and also very different I'm\nkind of curious do you think that\nbecause this is something that that\npeople have sort of asked about and\nthere's been some debate about do you\nthink that anything that you can attain\nthrough meditation you can attain\nthrough psychedelic use and vice versa\nyes I just want to put a footnote on\nmentioning something about psychosis\nbecause it's something that it just came\nback to me that you had mentioned yes so\nyeah I think we sounds like we\ncompletely agree on that that you know\nyeah things are just unlocked by\ndifferent experiences external to the\nbody or internal to the body right like\nso yeah we can put things in like unique\neven together that is basic as sugar and\nwhatever we eat for meals as you said\nalcohol um I really like that way of\nlooking at it I haven't haven't quite\nworded it that way and you know I'm just\ntrying to think of like my mind's at the\nsame time like wait can we add something\nthat wasn't there which is interesting\noh there ain't just a quick tangent\nbecause like what about sensory\nstimulation like the vision or touch can\nadd something to us technically right\nthat's external like a trauma so so\ncould a chemical do that I don't know\nanyway it's it's it's more of like maybe\nan intellectual topic but you know the\npiece about psychosis is that I actually\nI do believe that that you know perhaps\nthat at least a good amount of what we\ncall schizophrenia or psychosis could P\ncould be just an incredibly complex\ndefense mechanism meaning you know I I\nhaven't worked at least anyone who is\ndeeply deeply suffering from\nschizophrenia who hadn't had a really\nreally rough set of years in their in\ntheir early life and you know I would\nthink of it as you know the uh the\nunprocessed traumas again because of\nthat person's mixture of genetics and an\nupbringing end up creating a reality\nbecause that created reality as painful\nas it may appear to someone on the\noutside could be more less painful than\nhaving to sit with what actually\nhappened and I know that that's you know\nkind of what the early psychoanalyst\nused to believe so people used to do\nlong term therapy with schizophrenia not\nthat it worked very well we didn't see I\nmean that it that it had very good\nresults but quite honestly there aren't\nmany studies with psychotherapy that\nwork and you know consistently had a\nhigher rate with any mental illness and\nStingley stan grof who is someone who\ncan I just jump in for a second so like\nour discord seems to be lagging like a\nton oh there we go seems to have fixed\nitself is there anything you can do to\nimprove your like Wi-Fi or like position\nor anything like that I think everything\nis off except for let me see the other\nthing we can try doing is using a\ndifferent platform okay I mean all my\ndevices are off of Wi-Fi except here\nokay all right\nno problem let's let's keep going sorry\nyou see you were saying that\nschizophrenias could be an incredibly\ncomplex defense mechanism yeah and so\nyou know stan grof who probably most\npeople here have not heard of is he's\nstill alive I didn't he's nearing 90 he\nwas a he was it's like in some ways the\nThe Godfather of psychedelic therapy and\nso he he was you is a guy from the Czech\nRepublic and he was a training\npsychiatric resident all right as a\nplane flight ain't flying overhead if\nyou hear some noise de said if he was\ngonna he was took me a minute but you\nknow so Stan was training as a\npsychiatrist when Albert Hoffman the the\nscientist who discovered LSD was\nand to put it into practice and so Stan\nwas one of the first people who actually\ndid legal psychedelic therapy and he\nended up doing between it's estimated\nthree and four thousand LSD sessions\nwith patients completely legally and\nhalf of those were in the United States\nand just for anyone that's wondering\nthat's like unheard of like that is a\nlarge large number of people to have had\nexperiences with Stan interestingly his\nfirst wife actually had schizoaffective\ndisorder which is which is a kind of a\nmilder form I would say of schizophrenia\nand and in part of those 3,500 cases and\nin Stan's personal experience with his\nwife and other people they actually\ntreated numerous people that had what we\nwould nowadays call schizophrenia and he\nreports that and he has reported that he\nhad a lot of success with people right\nand these were not large-scale you know\ndouble-blind placebo-controlled trials\nbecause those dead-like\nplacebo-controlled trials didn't even\nreally start until the 1990s and so I\nthink there is some evidence from within\nyou know the the psychedelic research\nfrom that time period that actually\nsupports that that you know a lot of\nschizophrenia at least should be looked\nat in the future in terms of potentially\nbeing treatable by psychedelics you know\nI don't think it's anything that you\nknow we'll get into like in the next few\nyears but you know maybe in 10 or 15\nyears it's worth looking at because what\nif this group of people we've\nessentially in some ways the\ncapitalistic system has said these\npeople are so useless to the\ncapitalistic machine to make money so\nthey're like the homeless population\nlike what if even 20 percent of those\npeople could be living a pretty normal\nlife if they had a you know a big\nsignificant healing experience with a\npsychedelic like what does that mean\nabout us as ultra in our society hmm\nyeah it's interesting so I think we so\nI'm just wondering like there were a\ncouple of general threads so you\nmentioned kind of this this thing with\nyour phobia and we kind of got up like\nwe sort of bounced around a little bit\nso what ended up half\nlike with your like what's your\nunderstanding of so you you kind of said\nthat you know the phobia was sort of a\nmanifestation of like internal emotions\nthat didn't have any other way to come\nout and and that to sort of makes sense\nto me because I'm kind of envisioning\nlike this pile of stuff that you know\nwould affect so many different\ndimensions of your life so it's almost\nlike your brain kind of like packages it\nup and just gives you like a very like\nintense slice of emotion with like one\nthing so it kind of packs all that\nemotion into a particular fear so what\nended up happening with you are you\nstill afraid of planes and and if not\nlike what changed not at all I mean I\nit was gradual so I started my personal\npsychotherapy around my dad and that\nstuff in 20 I guess I was probably 2014\n2013 and I continued it I took a little\nbreak in the beginning of residency\nbecause the first year of residency was\nso challenging and then I doe back into\ntherapy you know when I had the second\nmental health crisis but you know this\nwhole thing about catharsis and the body\netc I had no idea you know what that was\nback then right I was of a lot of people\nyou know the mind of a lot of people\nwere I'm like you know illness is only\nthe mind right right where I've started\nthinking that the mind and the voice in\nthe body are actually three different\nlevels of healing that are necessary and\nthat simply heating the mind is one step\nbut it's not the whole step you know and\nin the beginning I what do you mean by\nthe voice so I believe you know that\nwere these physical beings right and I\nguess I'll give you the examples so\nthere's a book called The Four\nAgreements I'm not sure if your if\nyou're familiar with it I thought it's\nlike the spiritual wellness you know\nanyway they talk the guy talks about\nthese four agreements and the forth\nagreement I think is being impeccable\nwith your word and I remember thinking\nabout that and I and I didn't agree and\nI was like you know especially this day\nand age of people posting\nquotes in memes etc like in many of them\nin my you know circle of friends and\ncolleagues or even myself\nit seemed hypocritical because some\npeople would post some beautiful quote\nand then act like an [ __ ] the next\nweek and I'm like there's this like this\nthis discrepancy and so I intention\nknows because to me there's one level of\nunderstanding it's like I know here what\nI need to do and how I need to you know\ntreat my fellow man but then when I get\ntriggered I'm gonna behave a different\nway so I actually liked you know sort of\nuh adjusting that agreement with\nactually being impeccable with your deed\nit almost it felt more powerful to wait\nand see what people were like by the way\nI got to know them and I saw them\nbehaved towards me other people over the\ncourse of time and so to me is like but\nyou need the mind right you need the\nmind to heal because that's like a first\nlevel the voice I add because I think\nour voice is how we make ourselves known\nto the world how we announce ourselves\nit's like this is who I am this is what\nI want this is how I'm gonna engage with\nyou and there's a level of healing\nthat's a difficulty that that is to like\nexpress what we feel right and we know\nthere's a whole history in psyche you\nknow we can get into psychology why that\ncan happen but you know it you know if\nif I'm doing if I'm treating you know\nsay a young woman who is in an abusive\nrelationship right and through the work\ntogether that we do in therapy she\nrealizes oh I don't want to be an\nabusive relationship before I want to\nstand up for myself but it's another\nlevel to go home if she's like living\nwith that person and vocalized that and\nbe like I'm leaving you I don't need\nthis anymore\nright so it's one level to here and\nhe'll hear that but then we have to\nactually be able to speak from the heart\nand you know lastly it's then - like the\nbody why I think of that as differently\nand it's at two levels am i moving\nliterally with integrity and and and\nallowing my body to just be but I also\nthink that you know saying that there's\na healing level to the body is am i\nspending my time moving\nabout the world in a way that I most\nlove am i spending that time in a job\nthat I really care about that I'm\npassionate about am I you know going to\ncollege just because my parents told me\nto do we took go and I actually really\n[ __ ] hate this and I would actually\nrather be doing something else and so\nyou know and it's harder to act and move\nbecause I feel like as we heal things in\nthe mind it's like we're we're fighting\na narrative within our mind but actually\nonce we go to the level of the voice and\nthe body those tests are almost outside\nof the mind and they're out in the real\nphysical world and I think there's a\ndifferent level of of difficulty doing\nthat yeah I mean that once again it\nwords from my own heart but so let me\nask you a question well like so let's\nsay that someone is fighting these\nstruggles right so like this is you're\ntalking about essentially like twitch\nlike this is who we are\nwe're people who are not moving our body\nin a way that is like aligned with our\ntrue values where people who don't\nexpress our emotions and we may even not\nlike we may not even be clear in the\nmind like in fact I mean I think many\npeople aren't so how do people start\nsorry that you cut off a lesson so how\ndo people start okay so this is um no\nthis is great we're getting like deep\ninto the philosophy so if you know so\nthe other thing that I like to think\nabout is so the things that need to be\nhealed or realigned are the mind the\nvoice the body and I like to use the\nword alignment because what are we\naligning to right or in the psychedelic\nworld you hear the term psychedelic\nintegration but I've never heard of a\ngood definition of what that actually\nmeans it's almost like a buzzword now\nbut because what are we integrating to\nand so I like to think about the heart\nright I think it happened you know that\nyou know not to get I don't know how\nmany people on here follow chakras etc\nbut you know the heart is the part of me\nthat I think about note that knows like\nlike it cannot get off course you know\nit's kind of like the GPS that's\ninstalled in us the moment we're born\nand it is like this you know\nwe're starting here this is where you\nwant to be at the end of your life or\nthis is how you want to live with your\nlife and that part to me I like to think\nabout it again it is it will not fear\nand the things that can veer on or off\nare the mind the voice of body and I\nactually think of emotions then as not\nbeing like I don't think of don't yeah I\nwant to get rid of sadness or I want to\nget rid of fear because to me he you\nknow the what we call painful emotions\nare actually the GPS signal like it were\nif we're driving and we go on the wrong\nStreet\nthe GPS is like no turn around here make\na u-turn go back you're going on the\nwrong direction\nand so to me sadness fear shame are\nemotions that tell us you're going off\ncourse come back to where you want to be\nbut we began learn to judge the emotions\nwe've learned to to to want to get rid\nof them where I'm like I actually want\nthose things because if I didn't have\nanxiety and fear and sadness when I was\nlike living this life I didn't want to\nlive I would still be doing that and I\nwould be miserable and so so when I when\nI think of the healing I think of like\ngetting back on on that path and so I\nlike to think about you know when the\nmind boughs to the heart when the voice\nboughs to the heart when the body boughs\nto the heart that is the flow state to\nme so so it was like good saying like I\ndon't know what my heart says how do I\nfind out how do I find that out\nbeautiful and so and that that is a\nchallenge right and I and I would say\nit's listening to the body so the\nemotions are also not to me the body is\nwhere we feel emotion and that those\nsignals are all also never wrong a\nproblem can be mixed in there because\nonce we start adding Western medications\nright if we start feeling again\ndepressed or sad and we take\nantidepressants it can numb us so then\nwe can lose connection to our body or if\nwe take stimulant\nright a lot of people are on ritalin or\non adderall and adderall increases\nanxiety so all of a sudden like the\nnormal signals from our body are getting\nall these mixed-up things from what many\nof the doctors out there are prescribing\npeople so I would say step one to\nreconnecting to our hearts is to try\nwhen safe is possible to try to build a\nconnection with the body and start\ntrusting it again and being like my but\nthere's nothing wrong with my body it's\njust trying to tell me something and\nthat's bad in the Western world as a\nwhole it's a new concept so I'm gonna\ntry to push you a little bit on this\nbecause I'm gonna like envision\nsomething for a second okay like if\nyou're talking about stories so I want\nyou to imagine a 24 year old guy who's\nliving at home with his parents in his\nparents basement finished two and a half\nyears of college before dropping out\nplays video games all day\nhis overweight doesn't eat healthy\ndoesn't know what he wants and is deeply\nunsatisfied with his life but feels\nabsolutely stuck\nanytime he tries to go out into the\nworld it hurts\nanytime he thinks about his life it\nhurts what does that person do how does\nthat person begin he doesn't even know\nwhat he wants or okay so I would start\none of the things that I am big on right\nnow is is watching the mind and starting\nby saying you are not your mind so I\nlisten to narratives very closely when I\nam working with a client because you\nknow and the reason I mentioned this is\nbecause you said and I believe that many\npeople out there believe I don't know\nwhat I want and and this comes from the\narea of like I think we create our\nreality based on our thoughts and if I\napproach the world say being like I\ndon't know what I want that supports\nthat what you know that basically says\nmy body's not I I don't have a\nconnection to my heart I don't have a\nconnection to my body so first I would\nstart saying you know I feel like it's\nit's difficult to know what I want right\nor I'm learning how to how to\nhow to figure out what I want so you\nknow I would say that most everybody\nalso has a certain number of things that\nthey do enjoy maybe it's a small number\nof things but I would start by saying ah\nwhen I have had these experiences in the\npast or when I have these experience\nnowadays it may only be 5% of my living\nday but these things have brought me joy\nyou know what you know why is it why\ndoesn't my life look more like this\nand so that's trying to just you know\npiece together the puzzle so one would\nbe like a practical just like well can I\nspend my more of my life you know doing\nthese things that I like so that's one\nlevel yeah it's interesting it's it's\nhard a little bit but I like I like that\nyou're pushing me on this and you know\nfor me I was actually really overweight\nI'm open about this I've liked some\npictures out there or I'm like hey Devon\ndrew pounds more than I weighed right\nnow about 15 years ago you know and so\nyou mentioned the weight thing because\nthat was in some ways for me a way of\nignoring my body right I was like\nfeeling discomfort or anxiety and I\nwould eat so another way of actually\ntrying to make choice points and what we\ndo and how we spend our time is saying\nah if I am doing a behavior and that\ncould be like porn that could be\nspending a lot of time you know too much\ntime on a game or something like there's\na level where we usually know like this\nis fun or I'm doing this to escape I'm\ndoing this to ignore something\nso another thing become aware of when is\nmy behavior shifting towards perhaps\njust wanting to ignore what's happening\nout there because that could usually be\na choice where a choice point was\npossible you know I my friend how did\nshe lose the weight by by doing the\nhealing it happened it was very gradual\nyou know I first I actually I was living\nin England so I moved to England to\nstart my PhD and this is an interesting\nstory\nso I weighed 235 pounds at my maximum\nand I'm like 150 155 right now but when\nI\nlived when I moved to England I was at\n235 and it's funny because in grad\nschool in England you have a lot of\nforeigners coming in and yep two major\ncategories you have Americans and you\nhave Europeans and British food is\nreally unhealthy so it's funny though so\nthe Europeans that go to grad school in\nEngland end up gaining a bunch of weight\nbecause the food that's served is really\nunhealthy but the Americans end up\nlosing weight because food is portioned\nat school and so in order to like keep\nfeeding myself I would have had to ask\nfor double portions and I was like too\nembarrassed that happened to correlate\nwith me just doing getting out of\nmedical school and having people\nactually respect me intellectually and\nit was it was a time of just like\nfeeling appreciated and so it was kind\nof both of those things happening at the\nsame time you know so that in some ways\nstarted my healing even before my first\nyou know big big mental health crisis\nbut that's to say it's just like again\nit's building the relationship with the\nemotions in the body and being like okay\nlike I'm avoiding this by doing this and\nand and then once we can identify some\nof those it's like okay well why am i\navoiding this is it because I'm scared\nam i afraid of being rejected by friends\nor girl or or whatever and then and then\nlooking at that mean like if that's\nsomething I can work on because I would\nactually really rather be over here\ndoing this but it's scary to go from\nhere to there this is easy right\ncomforting myself with food I know it\nworks or comforting myself with again\nporn are comforting myself with this it\nworks but in the short term right but\nwhere I want to actually have my life be\nis over here and to me that's the\nhealing work how do I get back to here\nto trust you myself to building my\nconfidence to to feeling like you know\nall of us at some age we're like you\nknow life is a miracle and I can achieve\nanything and then the world outside of\nus starts making ourselves doubt and so\nhow do we then build that back up as\nadults and being like no I am capable of\npretty much living any life I want to\nlive\nyeah it's interesting I'm just\nremembering actually we had an interview\non Wednesday where it was kind of\nbouncing around for a while but then the\nperson I was talking to said this one\nsentence that for some reason just\nreally bothered me and and and she said\nsomething like I don't have a voice like\npeople don't listen to me or people\ndon't yeah and and that was something\nthat I for some reason it resonated with\nme and I took issue with it and I really\nchallenged her on it that her words have\nno meaning and and that it was it was\nweird it was like kind of a random thing\nwhich usually is like what happens and\nwhen we talked to people on stream is\nlike we're just kind of bouncing around\nfor an hour and then like something\nhappens where we catch on something and\nthen some kind of catharsis comes out of\nit and that I think was the start of her\ncatharsis a couple of days ago so it's\nfascinating I think a little bit about\nvoice and and I I really like the way\nthat you frame that you know the\nnegative things that we feel but if\nsomeone says I don't know what I want in\nlife the negative things that we feel\nare actually signals that are pointing\nus in the right direction right and and\nit can be something as simple as like I\ndon't want to be ashamed of the way that\nI look and and so you can sort of\nsuppress that through video games or\nmedications or other things or you can\nevoke and sort of sort through that and\nuse that as your navigating compass to\nlike get back to where you really want\nto go and make a positive change which\nis I think a beautiful way to put it so\nI'm kind of curious yeah and I started\ngonna go ahead it's gonna say I think\neach emotion has a healthy version of it\nin an unhealthy version and the I guess\nmaybe like a healthy game or an\nunhealthy gamer yeah boomer joke and no\none's gonna think no no but but we'll\njust to jump in for a second that's\nexactly why we chose the name that we\ndid because like everyone is talking\nabout video game addiction and they're\ntalking about it is is like a one\nunidirectional negative thing like a\ncouple months ago Trump said something\nlike video games are the reason that\nschool shootings happen and you know\npeople demonize video games and stuff\nthat and and my goal is not to like I\ndon't think that it's like an\nabstinence-only kind of thing right it's\nlike if someone's addicted like is\naddicted to sex like our goal is not to\nmake them celibate our goal is to help\nthem be like a healthy person like an\nintegrated person someone who enjoys\ngames and derives pleasure out of them\nbut also that the games don't get in the\nway of like all of this other [ __ ]\nthat they don't become exclusionary and\nand so I mean I'm glad you kind of\npicked up on that because that's\nabsolutely those precisely the\ninspiration behind what we're trying to\ndo we're not really even treating video\ngame addiction we're just trying to help\ntotal our people good yeah that's to me\nwhat leads to some of the initial stuff\nanyway like I'm you know yeah I've never\nplayed video games really because\nhonestly I suck at anything but I\nyeah we what makes you feel like your\nvideo game playing is inadequate well\nwhy do you think that hosted me therapy\nor do we are we gonna do therapy in my\ngame addiction no on your avoidance of\nplaying video games so why you feel like\nlike Nintendo is what I had in\nelementary theory and like I just sucked\nit all the fighting like Aaron would\nkick my ass and it made my self-esteem\njust drop like I just was horrible okay\nno all right god oh well so so healthy\nand unhealthy right so I would say what\nis healthy you know why would I you know\nI think there's a healthy version of\nshame and there's an unhealthy version\nof shame there's healthy sadness there's\nunhealthy sadness the healthy and\nunhealthy for me comes from the choice\nthat we make after experiencing it it's\nthe part of free will of being a human\nbeing that is one of the coolest parts\nof this larger video game that we're in\ncalled the human experience like if I\nhave shame over something and that shame\nleads me to go back onto a path that\nleap that is in the line with my heart\nthat's healthy shame if I experience\nshame over something and I feel worse\nand then I end up\ndoing behaviors that that make me\ndisconnect from people like diving into\nalcohol or something else then it's\nunhealthy shame because I'm using it to\nfurther pull myself away is the way I\nlike to do it I like to believe that\neveryone's trying their best and\neveryone wants to be in alignment and\nand you know and I think there's a\ntremendous amount of judgment from the\noutside world so when you were talking\nabout this you know this conversation\nthat you were having earlier in the week\nyou know you know I think I'm like knit\nagain when I listen to narratives you\nknow narratives are usually another\nbeautiful sign of where the root of the\nproblem is like if someone's like you\nknow I remember myself I used to tell\nmyself and I still struggle I would say\nlike I'm single and I'm dating and I\nlike I still like I think you know\nultimately you're such a catch are you\ntrying to hit on me no but maybe one day\nyou know one of the things that you know\nI used to tell myself and I'm still\nworking through at some level is like I\nknow you know if I go to a party I I\nwould you know I uppal years ago I would\nbe walking into the party being like oh\nthis is gonna be one of those parties\nwhere I'm gonna like see someone a girl\nI like and I'm not gonna talk to her and\nthen I'm gonna go home and feel shitty\nabout myself or oh I shouldn't even go\nto that party cuz like these people who\nwere cooler than me are gonna be there\nand then like but what I realized is\nlike I don't know I'd like to think of\nthese three positions right so and years\nago I was in his position of and then at\nsome point I started talking myself out\nof it being like oh my career is more\nimportant you know dating is a waste of\ntime you know if it's not helping me\ntowards this goal but what I was\nrealizing there was a narrative I built\nfor myself that narrative was I don't\nwant to be in a relationship and I don't\nwant there sorry I'm not in a\nrelationship\nand I don't want to be in one the\nposition I want to be in is I want to be\nin a relationship and I'm in one mmm\nbut that wasn't happening there's this\nposition of pain in the middle which is\nsaying I admit that I want to be in a\nrelationship and I'm not in one mm-hmm\nbut the less acutely painful position on\na daily basis would be to say tell\nmyself I don't want that\nlike I'm not capable of that so then\nthat narrative starts saying I'm gonna\nhide I'm gonna shrink myself I'm gonna\nmake myself small so what I think of the\nhealing path it is it is necessary to go\nthrough this middle experience but it's\nreally hard because usually at some\npoint in our life we built a life around\nourselves that supports that that\nnarrative of here right at some point I\nwas surrounding my friends that were you\nknow that were cooler than me or that\nfelt that they were better than me and\nthen at some point I was like as I was\ndoing the healing I'm like all these\npeople like if they're not supporting\nlike Who I am in my heart goodbye and\nthat and that was one of the harder\nthings as I transition through my\nhealing step after step is trusting\nmyself it was saying I know what's right\nfor me and all these people around me\nare a lot of them they're wrong and that\nwas a big step of trusting myself and\nand I think as a young man if I try to\nthink back when I was in my early 20s I\nthink that would have been a big one is\nto just is to really just learn you know\nto have emotions to express them because\nlike men especially are you know again\nif you if you're sad if you're crying if\nyou're scared you're weak and I'm like\nyou know up until when I started my\nhealing seven eight years ago I hadn't\ncried in like 15 years and I will say I\ncry most you know at least once or twice\na week and I love it I'm where I was\nliving in New York City up until\nDecember and there was many points in\nthe last year that I was living there I\nwould be on the subway its crowd in rush\nhour I would see a cute girl or whatever\nand if I was going through something and\nI was sad I let myself cry and you know\nand it felt so good to be like I don't\nhave to hide anything like I am just Who\nI am and it maybe seems paradoxical but\nthrough that like I wasn't I was just\nmore and more free to be who I was you\nknow I mean and I was just like [ __ ] all\nthis like I am this human being I have\nemotion\nand yeah my life has been only better\nyou know but it's step by step and\nawesome yeah thank you so much for\neverything how are you feeling right now\nreally good yeah I really love like I\nthink about my Dharma and why I'm here\nand to me it's it's to be a healer but\nyou know the kind of like when we\nstarted I that's why I love stories\nbecause you know I realized after some\ntime like talking to my patients or\nafter giving a public talk or something\nthat people come up to me and especially\nmen and I love it when they do this cuz\nthey're like oh my god thank you for\nsaying this like that's me and I'm like\nI started realizing this is everyone and\nso that's when I started being much less\nafraid of being me cuz I'm like I'm\nmyself and this is another thing that I\nthink about is like you know some some\npeople so I talked about my traumas or I\ntalked about like I gave a talk actually\nlast December about how like like my\npenis size and when I was like younger I\nwas like super self-conscious about my\npenis size and like I never hear guys\ntalking about this and it was\ninteresting because it's one example\nwhere there's two things that happen\nafter I give a public talk and I'm open\nabout something people or they'll email\nme and they'll say one I'll either say\nthank you for being strong or number two\nthey will say thank you for being\nvulnerable and I realized that depending\non where I was in my stage of healing\nsomething those that one or the other\nused to feel true but once I had my real\ncatharsis after you know whether it's in\nwith my therapist or whether I have you\nknow I was in an ayahuasca retreat is\nboth of those stopped resonating because\nI'm like I'm not actually being\nparticularly strong I'm just being Who I\nam or number two I'm not being\nvulnerable like vulnerable to what if I\nif I tell someone that I had a flying\nphobia if I'm on a date or if I tell a\ngirl like hey when I was like you know\nfor a lot of my adult male life I was\nlike self-conscious about my penis size\nand that girl decides to like not date\nme\nlike that's not vulnerable like I would\nactually thank you like I wouldn't even\nwant to be dating someone who who would\nwho would leave me for that so I\nactually think of it as a favor like it\nnot even then I'm being bolder bomb just\nlike thank you like like don't wait by\ntime yeah absolutely I mean I think it's\nbeautifully put and I think that's what\npeople you know that's where people want\nto be can you tell us a little bit about\nthe ayahuasca retreat yeah so ayahuasca\nit's interesting so you know maybe that\nwe can talk a little bit about a\ndifferent shirt different target\npsychedelics and and first of all you\nknow I wanna I want to say I like to\nthink about psychedelics there's five\ngeneral like I think legitimate uses of\npsychedelics and legitimately meaning\nthey're distinct uses of them so I think\nof healing which we're talking about any\nsecond would be kind of spirituality or\nenlightenment third would be recreation\nand fun fourth would be kind of like\nexploration of human potential or\nwanting to think of new ideas and fifth\nwould be abuse or addiction and I don't\nagain I'm not someone who judges anyone\nbut I just like to tell people will be\nclear about why you're using it that's\nall we need to do like don't say that\nyou're gonna go out and just do it at a\nfestival and that equals healing there\nis mixes between them right fun if you\nhave a really fun connected experience\nthat can be healing or you know\nspirituality enlightenment is on the\ncontinuum of healing but I think it's\nuseful to think of them that way so\nalong the lines of that so I also like\nto think of the different categories of\npsychedelics as being there they're not\nthey're also on a continuum meaning like\nthe in effects are very different you\nknow you have something like MDMA which\nI like to describe as I mean people call\nit a heart opener right it's a connector\nyou there's a trusting feeling when\nyou're diving into trauma I also like to\nsay that MDMA stays on the plane of this\nconsensus reality meaning for the most\npart 99.9 percent of the time it's gonna\nhave some you know the experience you\nhave has something to do with this birth\nto this death you know meaning it does\nnot get what we call transpersonal or\nnon ordinary on the other end of the\nspectrum is Iowa\nwhere you will have people have\nexperiences and they'll say oh my god I\nrelived a past life or I had my death\nthan my rebirth or you know I was\nconnecting with spirits that were\ntalking to me about my past you know\ndead relatives or something like that\nand so those are kind of on opposite\nends of the spectrum and and you know I\nI just like to have people at least know\nthat basic because if I'm someone who\njust wants to like feel less depressed\nfeel less anxious and say I come from a\nrelatively conservative background like\nright I was I was Jehovah's Witness and\nso even though I had left the church\nwhen I was in my teens the history of\nthat trauma stayed with me so for me to\ngo straight into something like\nayahuasca would be a big deal if I just\nwant to feel less anxious because like\nlike to get all sorts of other\nexperiences like spirits and stuff I\nwasn't ready for that and so you know\nwe're something like MDMA which is more\ngentle and again it just stays on the\nplane of this reality I think is you\nknow an interesting way to think about\nit okay so now to actually answer your\nquestion\nso ayahuasca for those who don't know\nthere's a lot of it in the media and\nit's it's a mixture of a bunch of\ndifferent plants that comes from\nAmazonian culture so the Amazon in Peru\nor Brazil or Ecuador or Colombia and\nit's a it's a psychedelic tea that plant\nhealers used to use or that still use\nthat has been around for a thousands of\nyears at this point it's thought and you\nknow some Westerners went down I think\nit was like in the early 90s and then\ngot connected with the tribes tried this\ntea and we're like oh my god this helps\nso much and so it is an incredibly\npowerful healing tool and it is like my\npersonal like I don't want to say\nfavorite favorite it's just my preferred\ntool for healing myself right now\nbecause it's like now that I've learned\nto work with it it is very powerful and\nit's out there a lot in and you just\nwant to be really mindful like of all\nthe ayahuasca retreats because there's\nall sorts of advertisements and people\nclaiming it's going to do XYZ for you a\nlot of them at this point are in it for\nthe money or the the people facilitate\nthe experience don't really know what\nthey're doing they don't emphasize like\nthe preparation of the person in the\nweek's calm or the you know help after\nthey they're just really in there to get\npeople in you pay us a two or three\nthousand dollars and then you go home\nand you know there's only one or two in\nthe world that I completely trust\nbecause you know I I really think that\nall these other things that we're\ntalking about are so important to the\nhealing process and the psychedelic is\nlike this it's powerful but it's still\nonly like a little step in the tool of\nyour of your own ability to heal\nyourself so so can you tell us a little\nbit about like the other ones so you\nsaid that you know MDMA is not quite as\ntrans personal and sort of enhances\ntrust you know has very promising uses\nfor like preliminary trials for like\nPTSD or something like that and kind of\nenhances the therapeutic relationship\nayahuasca is very transpersonal has more\nof a spiritual kind of experience what\nabout things like ketamine psilocybin\nibogaine yep LSD that would literally\ntake another hour but let me at least\nsummarize so ketamine is an interesting\none you know it's interesting because a\nit's the only one that's legally\navailable right now B by the way how our\naudience is from the EU about ah\ninteresting\nyeah actually ketamine I believe is also\nlegal right now in the EU I don't know\nhow many actual mental health\npractitioners are using it my guess\nwould be very few and the ketamine is an\ninteresting one it comes from its\nhistorical use has been in anaesthesia\nand so it's an anesthetic because it\ndissociates and meaning it dissociates\nthe body from the mind and if you get\ncomplete disconnection you can cut into\nthe skin because you're not going to\nfeel pain and you can do surgery about\ntwenty years ago now there was an\northopedic surgeon who was doing a bunch\nof procedures on his patients and then\ndecided to look at his data and then\nfound just by chance that the people who\nwere depressed and suicidal who\nhe used ketamine with we're feeling less\ndepressed and suicidal and that's how it\nreally entered the knowledge of\npsychiatry because it was just found\nthat oh my god this happens to work I\nmentioned that because ketamine is on a\ngradient right like you would have to\nuse really high doses to do complete\nanesthesia on someone and that is not to\nme the area where we want to be for\npsychedelic healing um I guess I maybe I\nwant to introduce this this concept of\nthe what we call the liminal space the\nword isn't important but basically you\nknow if we think of ourselves as here as\na human being with a body with an ego\nthat's like me and my isolated again\nmind and body you know I like to think\nI'm also that place that we look at deep\nin spirituality religion or even without\nthose like like even people who are say\noften agnostic or like at least there's\nsomething there could be something\ngreater so I don't like to make it you\nknow denominational so there's this\nplace that most people believe you know\nis that place that we come from and\nwhere we will go after we die so there's\nthese two positions and I like to think\nabout psychedelics can connect you on a\ncontinuum from one to the other and some\nof them do it very intensely and some of\nthem do it gently or more gradually and\nI happen to think that the powerful\nhealing aspect of psychedelics is when\nwe're on the liminal space meaning you\nhave some awareness of this and you have\nsome awareness of this and if you can\nride that then you can do the healing\nwork there and so that's a long-winded\nway of saying like ketamine and you know\nI think all psychedelics dose matters\nalong that continuum but ketamine is one\nwhere it's very important and because\nit's getting more use and it's out and\nthere in the media like I'll assure you\n99.9% of people doctors using ketamine\ndon't understand what I'm talking about\nright now and they're just like okay\nwell let me just inject this and we'll\ncharge people $500 or whatever like this\nit's a it's a really intimate science of\nhow this works and so I try to actually\nhelp people stay on that liminal space\nright because it's like how\nhow can I you know again have access to\nboth of these things at the same time on\nthe other end of the spectrum the smoked\nversion of ayahuasca which is called DMT\nor there's this other compound that\npeople refer to as toad because it's\nit's five Meo DMT which is if you like\nthere's this Sonoran frog in in Mexico\nwhere they used to use this frog\nmedicinally or they still do some some\nindigenous where you milk the I think\nit's the salivary gland and you can get\nthis compound it's that psychedelic out\nof out of the toad and those two the\nsmoked versions are the most powerful\npsychedelic that you could ever\nencounter you go from here to here you\nyou start going into it intensely within\n15-20 seconds and you are completely\nhere for about I don't five to eight\nminutes but again it's weird because of\nthe five to eight minutes don't matter\nbecause up here time time ceases to\nexist so I've had people that experience\nit and they're like I experienced every\nsingle event from the beginning of time\nto the end of time during that that\nabsurd observed outside time that was\nfive minutes you know and I'll mention\nthat because I rarely now find a healing\nusefulness of going from here to here\nlike doing this is it interesting is it\nmagnificent you know can it remind you\nof you know the bigger picture sure but\nyou still got to come back and like work\nwith these you know these narratives and\nthese painful things in everyday life\nand so I'm someone who actually is much\nmore of an advocate for lower doses and\nit's just you don't see that much out\nthere right now because people part of\nwhat pulls people to psychedelics is the\nstories oh my god like did I wasps guy\nand I saw this like Panther didn't\nappeared and it like converted into my\ngrandmother and you know people tell me\nthose stories and I'm like well okay but\nhow does that help you in a daily basis\nyou know yeah absolutely I think that's\nit's a great point I mean I think it's\nalso interesting to kind of think a\nlittle bit about staying connected to\nlike the person that you have to come\nback to and if you have an experience\nthat is completely unrelated to the\nperson that you live\nof your life as like it's gonna be hard\nfor that experience to actually help you\nin some way you know yeah so we're we're\nalong that continuum is like psilocybin\nand LSD I think of is kind of right in\nthe middle of the continuum but again\nthese are all these are dose based right\nand so you can get it actually a\nbeautifully ideal LSD or psilocybin\nspace that rides the liminal but um you\nknow I think it most dose is that you\nknow even if people use like double a\nnormal dose you're still yes you're\nstill riding the limit I like like with\nthose two and so then it becomes more of\na time preference right LSD I don't\nthink is ever gonna go down as a\nconsistent psychedelic therapy cuz it\nlasts so long you know it's like a 10 or\n12 hour experience and it'll never fit\nlike you know the nine-to-five work\nworld of my dog no doctor doc doesn't\nreally work 9:00 to 5:00 but you know\nit's not gonna work for just the\nhealthcare profession we're something\nthat's why you're like MDMA you know\nmaybe things could potentially you can\nget them down in like six hour sessions\nsure and that's another place where\nketamine is actually powerful if it's\ninjected and it's done in a medical\nenvironment you can be in and out in\nlike 90 minutes to two hours so okay so\nwe'll I'm wondering like I have one or\ntwo other questions for you but like\nmaybe what we can do is hop on discord\nand I'll walk you had through how to do\nthat in a couple minutes I just have one\nlast question for you so let's say like\nthey're gonna be like so first of all be\nprepared for you know the the flow of\npeople you know googling your name at\nthis point you may get a bunch of\nrequests and if you need help with that\nyou know we can I can I can try to help\nyou with that\nafterwards I have to deal with thousands\nof people contacting you for me I did it\nthank you yeah of course we have to have\nyou on but so so let's say like people\nare interested in this right so like\nyou've been talking about psychedelics\nand they're people who are watching our\nstream who are like yeah how do I start\nlike how do I do this this all sounds\nwonderful what do I do about it\nso it's interesting I will honestly say\nthere isn't\nmuch that is too helpful out there right\nnow it honestly it's something that\nwe've talked about what I want to do\nsoon but again I'm a Boomer so I don't\nknow how to do it is I actually want to\nstart putting out educational videos out\nthere for people that just take them\nstep by step in the process and and so\nhopefully in the next like six months or\nso right now be open like most of what I\nwhat's Google about me is my clinical\nwebsite silent I don't really have room\nfor new clients right now but at some\npoint I want to link that to you know\nnotice I want to do this pretty soon in\nthe next two or three months and I\nactually want to put out a priest URIs\nto help people understand like it all\nlikes how to do them responsibly etc etc\num I mean there's really yeah there's\nnot really much I can point to out there\nI mean Maps is an interesting thing to\nlook at just in as their organization\nbut and yeah I mean they'll have\ninformation on conferences and stuff but\nagain if you followed this conversation\ntoday like honestly like it's it's this\nis much deeper than any of the stuff out\nthere that that you can find and so um\nso what I'm hearing is that there isn't\nreally like a good clean way for someone\nto there's not a phone number that\nsomeone can call where they can find a\ntherapist take MDMA kind of graduate to\nayahuasca over time and that that's that\ninfrastructure hasn't been formed yet no\nyou know but yeah it's like you know\nagain and the reason why I really\nemphasize I like to talk the way I talk\nis because I don't it this isn't hey\nthere's there's a lot of nuance but it's\nnot so complex like I and like Rick\nDoblin the founder of maps I'm not\nsomeone who is like psychedelic healing\nand therapy should only be done with\ndoctors and psychologists you know I\nthink people should be free to explore\ntheir own consciousness if they're not\nhelped hurting other people and so I\nwould say if you're you know set in\nsetting is a term that's thrown out\nthere a lot meaning you know the\nexperience of a psychedelic I think is\ndetermined in some ways by set setting\nand dosage meaning set is like where the\nperson is like mentally where they are\nin their stage of lie\nyou know is this a huge peak of anxiety\nright now because maybe I want to wait a\nweek or two before trying it so if you\ncan manage where you are setting is like\nwhere I am taking the psychedelic and\nwho I'm with am I gonna have a sober\nfriend that I really trust can they sit\nwith me for six or eight hours and and\nare we gonna do this you know at\nsomeone's house and it's quiet or out in\nnature and you don't want if you're\ndoing something for healing don't do\nthat in the middle of a concert or a\nshow because that can turn really bad\nright it's so many other people and\ninfluences dose is the third one like\nyou know if don't don't overdo it you\nknow and so if you start gently with all\nthree of those this is how you learn how\nto do it right at some stage that's what\nI did right because there is still no\ntraining process for psychiatrists on\nhow to do this a lot of this was me just\ngoing out and experimenting finding\nketamine doctors who treated me and the\nearly ones I'm like I would never go\nback and I wouldn't recommend them and\nthen just learn in the process I've been\nto more ayahuasca retreats that I cannot\nrecommend people to go to then ones I\ncan you know so what I'm trying to do is\nlike you just put together my experience\nout there for people to try to hopefully\nhave them not have to go through the as\nmuch trial and error as I had to sure so\nI think unfortunately what I'm hearing\nis that like I know a lot of people out\nthere I get questions about psychedelics\na lot and you know some people think\nthat because it has this powerful\ntransformative potential they kind of\nthink like oh if I go to a white\nayahuasca retreat I'm gonna be fixed and\nI'm hearing the very opposite that\nthere's a lot of nuance there's a lot of\ngrowth there so a lot of like we're\nturning to the person that you are and\nthat this is not really like a magic\nbullet yeah definitely not a magic\nbullet because I actually I mean I could\nI think I got at least five emails this\nweek that were like I went to an\nayahuasca retreat I did this and I feel\na hell of a lot worse like in it it's\nreally sad because that is only in my\nmessages that are about that are only\nincreasing in the last six months year\nand and yep you know we want to be\npurple you know so I actually think the\nbest thing to do is if you can get\nsay a cluster of again this is just for\neducational purposes if you can get\nthree or four people who you really\ntrust friends that you can be open with\nthat you know that you can cry in front\nof her you can at least be open about\nyou know micro dosing is the whole topic\nwe haven't talked about but it's\nbasically taking small amounts of\nmushrooms like a 10% dose a 15% dose and\nsay you do you know if I were to you\nknow maybe take that with a close group\nof friends and we just get together on a\nSunday night I guarantee you it's less\nit's less jarring than the first time we\never got like drunk or passed out you\nknow it's just now we're like used to\ndrinking but that first time where we\ngot really drunk if you think back was\nprobably pretty damn scary yeah you know\nbut it's Tufted in the culture we're\nlike again a 10-15 percent microdose\nwould be so gentle compared to that you\nknow and so I think you know again just\ncreating potentially your own safe\nsetting to do things and explore your\nconsciousness you know so over time\nunfortunately will I've had similar\nemails and and one thing that I'll let\npeople know I've actually encountered\npeople who have PTSD from using\npsychedelics so they'll develop anxiety\ndisorders or will be actually crippled\nand disabled after having some very very\ndifficult experiences during trips so I\nthink you guys have to be really really\ncareful absolutely so will if you've got\nyou know it sir also you know try to not\nnot build the story kind of as you were\nsaying that LSD equaled my suffering\nright it's LSD plus difficult things\nthat came up that I couldn't process led\nto this suffering meaning you don't have\nto necessarily be terrified of going\nback to that place if you can set up\nthings for yourself in the future where\nyou know you have more support\nabsolutely man so if you've got time\nwhat we're gonna do is just hop on our\ndiscord and then give other people a\nchance to ask questions sure all right\nso I'll walk you through that process\nokay so let me just we're gonna set that\nup we're gonna take like a why don't we\ntake a two or three minute break\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\nyou\nendure for an hour\nokay cool\nessentially oh it coming today messages\nin this channel\nI think at the bottom says like I don't\nhave permission to send messages in this\nchannel\nhey hi I can hear you hi dr. Weil hi dr.\nkay my question is how do you know if\nyou're in a good space mentally to make\nuse of psychedelics to hear from trauma\nand maybe even understand yourself\nbetter\nit's there one more time sorry I I was a\nlittle thrown off by I thought it was I\nwas gonna see something good\noh no problem my question is how do you\nknow if you're in a good space mentally\nto make use of psychedelics to you from\ntrauma and understand yourself better\nyou know I would say it's\num it's a great big question first of\nall and second I would say in terms of a\ngood space I would say oh can I\nam I in a really bad or dangerous and\nthen if you're if that's no meaning if\nyou're suicidal for instance never\nor if you're in a really big cry and you\nhave no one to really reach out to not a\ntime to take psychedelics no otherwise I\nwould actually say you know hey can I\nmake changes again I have people in my\nlife that I trust that I can talk to\nabout my experience and it could even be\nwith me during it it would be more like\ncan I met what can I maximize an\nexperience that is out to be good you\nknow cuz I you know every time I go into\none have a pretty good amount of anxiety\nand fear you know but I don't\nnecessarily think that that's an\nunhealthy thing but to basically be able\nto go into something and say I respect\nit enough because difficult can come up\nis a good thing to have healthy fear you\nknow so does that help her\nyeah that helps so if I understood you\ncorrectly it's to have a good sense of\nwhere you are and in life in terms of\nlike if you're not an any extreme and to\ngo in with the healthy amount of maybe\neven fear is that oh yeah so I mean I\nalso heard him kind of say like having\nthe right support structure right so\nlike I'm envisioning our 24 year old\nwho's sitting at home and playing games\nall day like I don't know that that\nperson has the right support structure\nto help him make that experience like\nproductive right cool thanks for your\nquestion\nthank you or is he just like ready for\nround two\nit can people see me or noses voices\nvoice only okay oh sorry hey hey I'm\nsorry I was hearing the stream hello\nthanks so much for the whole the whole\nshow it was amazing my question is\nbasically this I'll do a comparison to\nmake it like better to make it feel more\nlike understandable but it's basically\nlike this there's healthy choices we can\nmake in the setting of therapy or\nsomething in in the pursue of getting\nbetter like like healthy dieting like\nmaybe exercise and how would the use of\npsychedelics fit here and what I mean by\nthat is basically if you if you do\nexercise maybe you have a better like\ncardio respiratory situation maybe you\nyou can have or and then in case of diet\nyou can improve your diet and maybe you\ncan feel better because of the diet and\nhow would psychedelics do maybe how they\nchange in the brain or how would they\nchange basically your your either your\nconsciousness or how you see it it's\nbasically that thanks\nyeah and so yeah I think of psychedelics\nas one of the tools\nDeeley in a whole box that we have with\nmany different tools of different\nvarieties that we can use at different\ntimes of our life\nPlus through those ups and downs you\nknow cuz I've done a tremendous amount\nof healing in the last seven or eight\nyears I still have time from time to\ntime that I struggle you know it's much\nless than it has been before in my life\nbut it's some still come up and so I\nthink and just think of them as one of\nthe tools in your toolbox I think is the\nway to do it and and and you know I\nthink just having a variety of things to\ngo to is the ideal place and never bling\nthat one thing is gonna be the answer to\nall of my problems because there's a lot\nof people that are like psychedelics\nlike a percent everyone should do them\nand I actually don't believe that you\nknow I think that some people could\ncould find the air healing tool could be\nmeditation or could be else that that's\nnot so good\nyou\nI don't mean to be like like super like\noh my god but I just wanted to ask\ni I can't understand that is it is it\ntrue and I agree with that I just my\nquestion was more of like how did two\nworks or how so well I think he's asking\nwhat's the mechanism right so like\nrunning improves our cardiovascular\nhealth effects are like insulin glucagon\nbalance increases are based on a bottle\nof great what's your understanding of\nthe mechanism through which psychedelics\naffect change okay so I would say that\nunlike what you'll read out there is I\ndon't think it is the neurotransmitters\nit is not is not serotonin and fixing\nserotonin levels I really love to think\nof this as the catharsis a stored up\nmotional trauma because you know I kind\nof think about like life is a movie room\nat any one point in our life we are\naccumulation of every single moment\nthat's ever happened to us\npink of like if there's slides in that\nmovie reel that have not been fully\nexpressed emotionally slides have more\nof an impact on our everyday life as we\ngo back and we can heal these right I've\nnever said that this your this is gonna\nmake you forget something that's\nhappened or make it go the impact of\nthat past thing on your current life\nwill be much less and so I think of it\nyou know as also this is a new paradigm\nof thinking it's molecules in cells it's\nactually a psychological way of healing\nand catharsis okay thanks so much man\nnow I understand thank you that was\ngreat\nyou're welcome great questions awesome\nman thank you there is some misc we're\nready for the next\n[Music]\nyou do\ncan you guys hear me yes well I actually\nhave a question about panic disorders\nand anxiety is there a way to do\npsychedelics safely if you have like\npanic disorders or are prone to be fee\nbe afraid basically\num would say well I'll share that I\nsuffered from panic disorders from my\nflying phobia so I never had a panic\ndisorder hanok attack until the middle\nof my flying phobia and they continued\nfor some time\nafter I started my healing work and\nthey're gone now I haven't had a panic\nattack in\nyears\nso I will say you know as long as better\neverything is medically safe and it's\nlike a true panic attack it's not it's\nnot some other you know cardiac disorder\num they yeah because you know a panic\nattack is I kind of think about as an\nelevated level of fear right something\nin the past has in care therefore that\npart is playing a bigger game you know a\npart in our everyday life so something\nis legitimately fearful today if I\nalmost get run over\namplified because of this past thing and\nso then it puts the body into fighting a\npanic attack\noh you know I just think that normally\nwhen we have these we're not in a\nposition to really be held or we're not\nbeing held emotionally or that we don't\nhave an understanding of this and say\nthe original trauma and so I actually\nthink psychedelics can\nbroad statement numbness recommending\nthis for you you know MDMA you know for\npeople with PTSD so the main clinical\nstudies right now for MDMA or Molly or\necstasy is with other people more on in\nthe non-medical world has been used for\nPTSD and and so many of the patients in\nthe studies have had panic attacks and\nhave had them healed from from you know\nambien and I want to also emphasize\nsomething that I didn't say clearly is\nthat you know III think about\npsychedelic assisted psychotherapy I\ndon't think of it as psychedelic therapy\nmeaning psychedelics are you know one\npart of a comprehensive long-term\ntherapy relationship so in the maps MDMA\ntrial for instance you take you're doing\ntherapy every week for four three times\nover the course about four months you\ntake MDMA but but really the foundation\nof the healing is is this extended\npsychotherapy\nright so um yeah that's great actually\nso will what I'm hearing you say is is\nthat like so the short answer is if you\nhave an anxiety or panic disorder your\npersonal experience right so you're not\nmaking a medical you're not medically\nadvising people but you're sharing a\npersonal experience that you had a\nphobia and you used it and you found it\nwas helpful and secondly that it can be\ndone but the the cornerstone of\npsychedelic assisted therapy is the\nideas that the psychedelic does not do\nthe therapy in and of itself you just\ndon't get high and/or heal that there's\nlike a process I mean what I'm hearing\nyou say kind of time and again is that\nlike this crack kind of expands your\nconsciousness allows you to experience\nthings in a different way in order to\nreally facilitate that healing you have\nto translate those experiences in a way\nthat like affects your daily life and\nthat's usually done through the right\nkind of support network and it can be\nmedical but it also is not exclusive to\nmedical people like you've seen\nexperiences of psychedelic assisted\nhealing with people like shamans or\nother friends or people that you can\ntrust is that a good way to put it so I\ndon't know if we have one thing I didn't\ntalk about and but maybe I'll mention\nactually an equation to come I think\nthat equation is the emotional memory\nselection you're cutting out a little\nbit but yeah I'm not sure what to do\nabout that but it's weird cuz I think it\nwas better on the video call I'm not\nsure why this is can you try saying that\nagain\nmaybe we'll just wait - next okay why\ndon't we why don't we take one more\nquestion maybe we can hop back on a\nvideo call and you can share that\nequation with us and then we'll end does\nthat sound okay okay we'll take one more\nquestion thanks Jordan good questions\nready for the next one I think and they\nwere good oh great okay perfect okay all\nright we'll I'm gonna call you again on\ndiscord okay okay so you should get a\ncall right now and then you can tell us\nyour\nlike\nbefore explaining it to him Oh God can\nhe join\nwell I abandoned him in ER oh you made\nit\nawesome will can you hear me\nthere we go okay can you turn on your\ncamera perfect tell us there's a beat\nlike I feel like this is important so\ntell us this equation thank you not this\nis actually it's whatever I judge me I\nwon't just fight like well I didn't read\nmany of the messages on Twitch but just\nbased on the questions and the\nengagement I think this group of people\nreally gets it so I really yeah been fun\nto do this so yeah I'm happy to actually\ngo into this and so you know I think\nthis catharsis thing is again this\nreally came from from my experience of\nmy own healing and so I think of three\nthings that are necessary for emotional\ncatharsis or release is that if we have\nthe emotional memory of something that\nhappened come with the narrative memory\nmeaning the the body experience of the\nemotion plus the memory of you know\nsomething that happened early in life\nthat that fits that situation plus the\nthird critical thing is is an empathic\nsetting and for me empathic is very\ndifferent from sympathy right you know\nsympathy is like me telling a story\nabout kind of getting bullied and\nsomeone's like that must suck like that\nyou got bullied I'm sorry but just okay\nlike some random person on the street\nright where I think of empathy is when\nsomething hit like when we have an\ninteraction with someone where we feel\nthat that person understands our\nexperience he understands our experience\nand often that's not even verbal so it\ndoes it's like the word sometimes can't\neven distract but we're just like this\nperson gets me like like they know how\nhard this\nand when those three things happen I\nthink that's when tears come when when\nthe body can shake when the fear leaves\nthe body and you know just in case it\nisn't clearly connected that usually\nhelp is [ __ ] up to begin with because\nthe people who are supposed to be\nempathic to us parents brothers and\nsisters friends weren't so then that\nrelease didn't happen it's stored in the\nbody and that's where the set the\nsetting thing is important in the set\nsetting in dose because if we can\nrecreate an environment where we are\nwith psychedelics helping emotional\nmemory and narrative memory come\ntogether and then we have a setting\nwhich is M Pathak that's why we get\nthese huge catharsis and people are like\nyou know this thing I was walking around\nwith for 20 years is now gone\nand so I actually think it's a very\nsimple equation and it's why I'm so\npassionate about education because you\nknow I actually think most of the people\nthat are psychedelic therapists and who\ncall themselves a psychedelic therapist\nout there don't understand what I just\nsaid and I think it's really simple and\nI think you know in the heart the hard\npart is that culture is not empathic\nright now right we don't live in a\nsociety that's in topic and so if we can\nactually heal society and just become\nmore empathic people we get rid of the\nthe need even for psychedelics right\nbecause I think ultimately it's it's\nthis screwed-up culture that we've been\nliving in that caused all of these\ndiscrepancies to begin with inability to\nto express emotion well well so first of\nall dude I'm with you 100% let me just\nmake sure I understand so it's sort of\nlike having kind of a mental sort of\nexperience of emotion the the bodily\nexperience of emotion and then having\nempathy which I think you're right the\npeople here get it because I think so\nthe funny thing is that our tag for\nhealthy gamer like our tagline is AoE\nhealing and AoE means area-of-effect\nand so there's this idea in videogames\ncan you hear me I lost you use an area\nof effect\nhealing ah so there's this idea in video\ngames that when a character takes damage\nlike there are some characters that are\nhealers and some characters that take\ndamage and so what you do is you target\na particular character and then you cast\nlike a healing spell and then you heal\nthat person if they're like being\nattacked by a monster and they're there\nare some things there are some spells\nthat are area-of-effect so anyone within\na particular radius gets the benefit of\nthe healing spell and the interesting\nthing about us is that like we're about\na Oh a healing because I think the\nreason people find this helpful is\nbecause they feel empathy for the people\nthat come on stream so when when I am\ntalking with an individual somehow\npeople feel they resonate with what they\nsee they resonate with like the\nexperiences of another human being and\nthey themselves I was really skeptical\nabout this and some people post about\nthis kind of stuff on Reddit and the\ninternet and they kind of say that oh\nlike the stream is like really changing\nme and it's helping me and I'm confused\nbecause I've never really thought that\nyou know I just find it hard to believe\nthat you can watch something on the\ninternet and be changed and the really\nfascinating thing is if you like tunnel\ndown into it I think they're feeling\nthat empathic connection and and so it\nmakes a lot of sense to me and it's a\nbig part of I think what we what we try\nto do here and what we're some sort of\nfumbling our way through and the the\nlast thing will I just want to say cuz I\nknow I know you've got to get going and\nI want to be respectful your good times\nthank you so much for coming man I think\nit's been awesome having you I think\nyou're able to really talk about this\nstuff\nin a way that very few people can sort\nof from a scientific expert as well as\nlike personal experience as well as kind\nof clinical practice about like\nimplementing with with actual people and\ntrying to see change and healing and one\nof the things that I've come to realize\nis so many people that I talked to who\nclaim to be analytical and logical or so\nhow can I say this so blunt with their\ntheir beliefs about psychedelics right\nit's not nuanced at all like people\nhaven't tried to tease apart the\nequation of how healing works people\ndon't really think about the liminal\nspace and\nand why is dosing important what is\ndosing do the different spectrums of\ndifferent psychedelics so like I mean\nyou really blown my mind in terms of the\ndepth of your knowledge and just how\ncomplicated this stuff is and it makes\nsense to me that this is complicated and\nif we understand this equation then like\nthat's really what brings about\ntransformative healing it's like really\nunderstanding like how this whole\nequation works so thank you so much\nyou're very welcome I do want to say\nsomething back to actually both the the\nthings that you sort of said right now I\nmean yes III totally think that\nexperiences as long as their\ninterpersonal can be empathic and\nhealing and you know I think that III\nthink of our current mental health\nsystem was born out of a culture that\nwas already bad at empathizing and so\ntherefore the system that we created\nwithin it the system of suppression\nmimicked the culture and so we're not\ngetting the healing because the people\nwho built the system didn't get it and\nso I think you know especially you know\nI learned to trust myself right and I\ncan say I know my body I know my\nemotions but at some level I always knew\nthat right like and so I would say well\nlistening right now that this resonates\nwith is trust yourself at its deepest\ndeepest level you know just because\nsomeone has a medical degree or a PhD if\nit's really not resonating with you like\nthey could be completely wrong you know\nand so so really the healing is an\nultimate trust of yourself and you know\nand just just Rhian and the other thing\nyou know I just think about in general\nwhether it's with psychedelics or not is\nthat the healer that you're working with\ncan only take you as far as he or she\nhas done their healing and so you know\nand there's a lot of what we call\nwounded healers out there meaning people\nusually go into the healing fields\nbecause they're wounded and many of\nthose have not put in the time and the\nenergy into their own work and so I\nthink yeah you'll find\npeople with or without the degrees and\nthe training that can be healers in your\nlife the last thing I wanted to say at\nleast was like it's interesting this\nidea of the healer within the video game\nbecause it almost makes me think maybe I\nshould react video games if there's a\nhealing avatar maybe I can go in there\nEren good enough we're gonna do we're\ngonna do game extreme well in his 56k\nconnection and he's gonna get crushed\nbecause he lags so hard\ndone but will on a very practical note\nyes so like I think I'm I'm sure\neveryone would love to see you play\nvideo games but you know just in terms\nof spreading your message if there's any\nway we can practically support you all\nI'll shoot you a quick email but in\nterms of if you want to make videos and\nthings like that you know we figured a\nlittle bit about how to do that I'm not\nsaying they're great but you know they\nseem to have you know there we have a\nlot of views and stuff on YouTube but in\nterms of infrastructure and stuff like\nthat we're happy to support you because\nI think you know will I've always\nrespected you but I think even with our\nlike last conversation that we had sort\nof about reconnecting I mean it's just\nso much of what you're saying I want to\nlike really really actively support\nbecause it's so fascinating to hear\nsomeone come to all of the same\nconclusions like you'd be surprised like\nI basically say all I mean I feel like I\nsay a lot of the things that you've said\non stream about so when people ask me I\ntalk a lot about alexithymia and and\nsort of people not recognizing their\nwhere their emotions are and like what\nthey're feeling and especially for men\nlike I start with the body first and\nforemost because men understand emotions\nvery easily like they don't understand a\nfeeling of being rejected ashamed and\nunlovable but they do feel yeah man she\nlike I asked her out and she kicked me\nin the nuts like that's what it felt\nlike and even our language as men in\nterms of expressing emotions is very\nvery physical and then all of the other\nmen that you're talking to know exactly\nwhat you're feeling and so your emphasis\non sort of the body and and we do like\nwe do more meditation than yoga on\nstream but sometimes we'll do yoga and\nstuff like that so I just want to\nsupport your message and thank you so\nmuch for coming on awesome thanks a lot\nit was a lot of fun take care do you\nhave like social stuff that you\npeople to subscribe to or anything like\nthat like a Twitter or YouTube or any of\nthat [ __ ] I mean all I have so far is an\nInstagram maybe maybe that's a Boomer\nthing but maybe more to come in the feed\nI did make a twitch account 0-0 yeah so\nlet's I mean if you are active on your\nInstagram and you want to grow your\nInstagram you can tell us what your\nInstagram is and then we can people join\nit will see you Andy so just my name MB\nso WI LSI UMD ok great awesome in all\nright take care everyone thanks for\ncoming on OK twitch chat oh there we go\nthanks Moses\nokay so that was will wills awesome I'm\na big fan yeah so you know you guys tell\nus like you guys want to do a little bit\nmore of that lest that you know if you\nguys want like more people we have more\nrights oh okay\nyeah will is awesome dude so so you know\nit's interesting I think he has a\ndifferent impression of when I knew him\nso I knew will in his final form which\nis his current form I didn't really know\nhim so he's finished residency I think\nin 2014 ages which is the year that I\nstarted so I'm pretty sure he had\nrelatively long hair and some of those\npiercings maybe not quite that many\npiercings when I met him\nso we'll kind of see ya so thank you\nguys very much for coming you know there\nare a lot of other guests that we can\nthink about having on in terms of\noffering their expertise on mental\nhealth and and stuff like that\nand yeah so let's just think about a\ncouple of fascinating things that we can\ndo right like so oh my god so I'm\nlearning more about psychedelics and I\nthink it would be cool I would love to\nsee a clinical trial where people take\ngamers and then give them psychedelic\nassisted treatment and just see what\nhappens like in terms of their ability\nto re-engage in life like that\nvery cool interview I mean uh sorry a\nvery cool trial because I think a big\npart of you know what I believe is that\nlike you know at NASA Sarah is not gonna\nfix your problem like an antidepressant\nor anti-anxiety medication is not gonna\nfix your problem it'll help if you have\ndepression or anxiety but you really\nhave to do this like like formative\ngrounding kind of work right you have to\nlike get through this stuff and talk\nabout your some scars talk about your\npast Rama's come to terms with them\nlearn how to grieve learn how to face\nshame this is a big part of Dharma and I\nknow we get a lot of questions about how\ndo I find my daughter about how do I\nfind my Dharma and I think the\nfascinating thing from will is that like\nyou guys already know your Dharma like\nyou've taught yourself you've come to\nbelieve because you have taught yourself\nthat you don't know what your daughter\nMaya is because you the narrative is\nthat you were directionless and and if\nwe really think about it what will was\nsaying I think is really spot-on that\nlike what we can actually do is like\nstop and think about you know when you\nhave a particular emotion or when you\ntry to do something and you feel\nsomething like when you try to leave the\nhouse and you feel ashamed about\nyourself\nwhat is that shame like where does that\nchain come from like what why do you\nwant to leave the house like explore\nthose things and in that I think you\nwill find your daughter Bob yeah I also\nreally liked his point about like good\nemotions and bad emotions right like\nit's not shame has become something that\nwe avoid but like whether it makes it\ngood or bad and this is also a big point\nbehind Dharma is that like those\nemotions are there right fear is there\nit's just about whether you face it and\nwhether it it pushes you in the right\ndirection or the wrong direction so you\nknow I think it's like so much soft land\nand it's fascinating to me personally to\nhear that Will has come to so many of\nthe conclusions that like I felt like I\ncame to myself one is that I never\nreally thought of myself as a wounded\nhealer right but like if we think about\nit like that actually makes a lot of\nsense because for you know like a decade\nof my life or more I was a [ __ ] just\nsocked at life like\ngame was a game that I was not winning\nand and I think that like we\nunderestimate the value and this is we\nunderestimate the value of what that can\nlead to and just the idea that like I'm\nalmost beginning to think that when we\nthink about a successful person and a\nperson who struggles we place more value\non the successful person the person\nwho's had always had a 4.0 GPA Lincoln\nHigh School College med school whatever\nright and we say that that life is\nbetter than my life because I'm failing\nbut hearing will it's been fascinating\nto think that because I've kind of\nalways thought this about myself that\nthe reason that I can help people is\nbecause I've gone through it and and\nI've never really realized until today\nthat like actually the best people to be\npotentially psychiatrists or medical\ndoctors or whatever right are the people\nwho have struggled and that they have an\nadvantage over the people who are always\nperfect and when I see you guys\nstruggling like it's so hard for me to\ntry to convey this I'd love to\ntransplant this thought from my mind to\nyour mind but you see your your struggle\nas a failure and I see it as like part\nof making you who you're supposed to be\nand in it just has to happen that way\nthat's what gutter my is all about this\nis your life and this is what's been\ngiven to you and you're gonna live\nthrough it and you're gonna be stronger\nbecause of it like you can't be the\nperson that life needs you to be the\nperson that you are and it's hard to\ndescribe but like you know when you\nstruggle with all the shame if let's say\nyou have emotionally neglectful parents\nor tiger' parents or whatever like you\nhave to understand that like unless you\nhad those experiences you're not able to\nbe the parent that your child your\nfuture child who has yet who is yet to\nbe born and you have to have sex in\norder to do that at some point but you\nknow cross that bridge when we come to\nit\nbut understand that like your\nexperiences turn you into the person\nthat the world needs you to be turns you\ninto the people that your child needs\nyou to be\nand and whether it's like a friend or\nyour child or you know a random person\non the internet who your Steam friends\nwith and the one reason they don't kill\nthemselves today is because when they\nlike message you you respond when no one\nelse in their life responds like just\nrecognize that right it's not about your\nGPA it's not about your income it's not\nabout any of that [ __ ] it's about the\nperson that you are and your true self\nwhich no one can take you away from and\nit was so fascinating to hear like we'll\nsay like oh it's so awesome that you're\nvulnerable and he's like vulnerable to\nwhat like what does that even like\nhe abandons that entire premise of\nweakness because it's true it's false in\nand I try to abandon that premise to you\nguys like look at me and you say I'm\ndifferent from you but my whole point is\nthat I'm not right like there's no\ndifference between me and you like it's\nit's abandoning the premise that I am\nsuccessful then you were a failure like\nI don't think you guys get it like I'm\nstill the failure that I used to be like\nand nothing has changed and and you're\nthat failure is kind of born out of like\nthe fertilizer success is born out of\nand fertilizer or failure and you guys\nare just earlier along I'm 37 and for\nthose of you feel old like we have to be\ncareful about comparison but you know\npeople say like oh I'm 21 and I'm not\ngoing anywhere in life it's like yeah\nand like that's that's fine that's okay\nthat's just part of your journey and\nyou'll get there you'll get there just\nkeep trying and listen to what we'll\nsaid and listen to that inner voice and\nwhen you feel shame recognize that it\nbelongs there that you have every right\nto be ashamed and like will says you\nhave a choice between whether you make\nthat shame healthy or unhealthy shame\nisn't bad right shame is what tells you\nlike oh if I if I was supposed to stream\ntoday and I like overslept and was like\n45 minutes late and then you guys only\ngot an hour and 15 minutes because we'll\nas a patient right now a client like I\nshould feel shame absolutely and I\nshould use that shame to correct my\nbehavior and I used to be late to crap\nand I know everyone jokes about me being\nlike three minutes late or five minutes\nlate or whatever but like that\npunctuality came out of shame of being\nlike not respecting people's time\nand so make it into healthy shame if you\nfeel a certain way like recognize you\nfeel that way for a reason recognize\nthat that's your internal compass like\ntelling you that something needs to\nchange and then listen to it and then\nmake the smallest possible change that\nyou can don't get confused about like\nturning it into a grand transformation\nthat you're gonna fix yourself today\nbecause will says that too he says it's\nnot like you take LSD and you're healed\nhe's like people work over the course of\none month or four months or three months\nor whatever and they use psychedelics\nlike three times and every week they're\nin therapy it's a gradual process and so\nmake one tiny step today like I don't\nknow what time it is where you guys are\nbut like do something for yourself today\nlike in the tiniest little thing so\nsomeone says whom in Panda says what if\nI have a shitty compass that that is\nthat exact exactly what will is saying\nthat is a false narrative that you\nshould construct for yourself you don't\nhave a shitty compass you have a good\ncompass you just think it's shape pay\nattention to it and you'll realize like\noh it's like it's not that like it it\npoints it it always points the direction\nthat it's supposed to go it's just you\njust don't realize that it's always\npointing East instead of pointing north\nthe compass works fine it's just not\ndoing exactly what you think it's doing\nyou can navigate just as well with a\ncompass that always points east but if\nyou think that a compass should always\npoint north and you don't recognize your\ncompass for what it is then you're gonna\nhave a lot of problems but all you need\nto do is calibrate and recognize how my\ncompass always points east so if I\nwanted to go north I can still go north\nif I want to go east I can go east if I\nwant to go south or west it works just\nas well it's just different\nright so you so start start with the\nidea that you're not [ __ ] up just like\nentertain that notion for a moment Oh\nlike what if I actually know what I do\nwant to do what if I know exactly what I\nwant to do but because of society's\nvalues right like so exactly I forget\nexactly what we'll call them like true\nvalues and like inherited values or\nsomething like that instead of\nlike believing that you know what you\nwant you just what you want is different\nfrom what you're inherited values are\nit's different from what your parents\nwant you to be it's different from what\neveryone at school was so impressed with\nsome people and you were not that thing\nand so you decided Oh like I don't know\nwhat I want because I don't want that no\nyou know what you want and like this\nlike this person who says I'm one of my\ncompasses busted no this is exactly what\nwas saying there's the part over here\nwhere you believe that your compass is\nbusted and it hurts and then over here\nyour compass is right and you're killing\nit and then in the middle is the idea\nthat oh my compass is actually\ncompletely normal but I'm [ __ ] it up\nanyway do you guys see that because if\nyou believe that your compass is busted\nyou've got an excuse you can retreat\nfrom the pain its lidocaine\noh my compass is busted it's not my\nfault it's so much harder to admit to\nyourself that I know exactly what I want\nand I'm just too weak to get it I\nhaven't been able to do it yet that's\nexactly where you need to go is to say I\nknow what I want I've always known what\nI want but I haven't been able to\naccomplish it and also that weakness is\nnot like oh I'm weak don't use that as\nan excuse to like get over here we're\nlike you're not capable of doing\nanything understand that weakness is\nsomething that you can own and that you\ncan change it's not an attribute on your\ncharacter sheet it's like an action that\nyou can take right if I roll a d20 and I\nhit or I miss it's not like I'm a hit or\na miss er that's just on that roll it's\nnot an attribute on your character sheet\nit's just a particular result of a\nparticular moment in time weakness is\nnot something that you are it's\nsomething that you are in a moment it's\nan outcome it's not an attribute so\ndon't have the courage to think for a\nmoment that your compass is not busted\nhave the courage to think for a moment\nthat you're not broken and you're\nplaying you oh but like I don't want to\nbe broken no you what you want to be is\nlike\nbroken and successful what you can't\ntolerate it's beautiful\nwhat you can't tolerate is that middle\nstate so if I am not broken and I'm a\nfailure I have no excuse because that's\nwhere you like you have to understand\nyou can't make a change in your life\nunless you fundamentally believe that\nyou have agency to make change and if\nyou have agency to make change that\nmakes you responsible if you're\nresponsible you can't hide behind\nanything the problem is that you're\n[ __ ] hiding you're hiding from your\npower you don't want your power because\nif you have power then it's your fault\nyeah so like take your power admit it's\nyour fault and then do better\nforgive yourself along the way that goes\na long way right okay\nso thank you guys for coming I don't I\nguess I should meditate I don't really\nfeel like meditating I'm riled up but\nmaybe I should anyway\nokay so let's let's make a choice right\nnow let's choose to not give in to our\nfeelings of being riled up and not going\nto meditate and let's exercise our\nagency and do it anyway even if we don't\nfeel like it no no we're not going to\ngive in to that right that's exactly\nwhat we want to do so our meditation\ntoday is going to be different though I\nwant you to don't close your eyes I want\nyou to in this state think about where\nthe where your agency lies think about\nwhat you're capable of think about the\nthing that you are not doing that you\nare capable of that you can absolutely\ndo\njust take a moment and do it with your\neyes open\ntake a moment to think what is it that\nI'm actually what is it that I like\navoid responsibility for that I actually\ncompletely am responsible for it and I\nwant you guys if you guys have you can\nopen up notepad or grab a pen and a\npaper and I want you to like physically\nwrite it down\nokay so I wrote something down now I\nwant you to close your eyes sit up\nstraight\nand try to see that thing try to see\nyour agency\ntry to see your capability\nand then try to see your judgment\nthat you blame yourself for not doing\nthat thing\nyou\nand try to see your resistance is you\nintend to do something what gets in the\nway\nyou\nand now notice how hard it is\nnotice that when you close your eyes and\nbreathe in and out\nagain and out\nand then\nand out one more time\nnotice how ethereal the judgment and the\nresistance are in this moment maybe even\nthe goal is ethereal\nif it feels real to you if it feels\nheavy if it feels present then sit with\nfat and give it the respect that it\ndeserves\ngive your weakness your fear your shame\nthe respect that it deserves that these\nare powerful things within you\nbut I find myself and not feeling those\nthings\nmyself feeling that my resistance in\njudgment\nhe's like a shadow on a wall and\nprojected to be much larger than it\nactually is like a tiny figurine with a\nlight shining on it casting a gigantic\nshadow\nthat when we stop and we look at the\nthings that hold us back they're far\nsmaller than they appear or as you look\nyou recognize that it is gigantic either\none is fine\nyou\nyou\nand now prepare yourself to move forward\nif your fears and shames and the things\nthat hold you back or in reality farce\npother laughs because it's [ __ ]\nhilarious\nyou've been be you're held back by that\nbig [ __ ] hilarious look at how much\nof a noob you are being held back by a\nfigment of your imagination and then\nprepare yourself to take action and if\nyou're held by it backed by something\nthat is gigantic gargantuan massive if\nthe shame or trauma or fear is very real\nand very powerful then respect it and in\nthat respect find forgiveness for\nyourself because if it is a ray boss\nyou're gonna wipe respect that the\nchallenges and struggles that you face\nare real and banya mentis and it\nthat make you weak to not be able to\nclimb Mount Everest it's just hard to\nclimb Mount Everest so find some\nforgiveness for yourself\nbecause not everyone climbing Everest\nisn't easy doesn't mean that you're\ngoing to give up it just means that you\nneed to be prepared\nit's the final boss and so that little\nthing that you think is so easy for you\nto do that everyone else does so\neffortlessly\nwhether it's eat a piece of fruit a day\nor wake up on time or start that work\nthat you're procrastinating on recognize\nthat that is not avarice and that that\nis the final boss and that what you need\nto overcome it is not judgment towards\nyourself not berating yourself for being\na piece of [ __ ] but that you need to\nmentally prepare the way that you do for\na final boss check your inventory make\nsure you're well stocked on potions make\nsure you're not lagging and then get\nready to Zone in new Zone in play your\nfinal boss music and try to do that task\neat a [ __ ] Apple while you listen to\nyour final boss music because that's all\nthere is is moments in time there is\nonly the boss that you face now and give\nthat final boss everything that you've\ngot give this moment everything that you\nhave and see what you can accomplish\nrecognize that failure is a possibility\nin success as a possibility\nbut the real failure is not zoning in\nmost of your life your problem is that\nyou don't Zone in you don't even try so\ntry to find the smallest nugget of\ncourage and Zone in\ncome on back and think concretely for a\nmoment now we return to the conscious\nmind think concretely about what are you\ngoing to do today in the time that you\nhave do one thing one thing Zone in and\nrecognize that every minute that goes\npast from this moment until when you\nZone in your chances of success decrease\nso we're going to raid a CH a chubby\nsend it\nokay and try to do that thing the\nsmallest thing whatever it is if you\nguys feel like procrastinating\nprocrastinating Chevy take care guys\nonce again this is Mental Health\nAwareness Month we're gonna be trying to\nraise some money so if you guys can\ndonate we'd really appreciate it we're\ntrying to raise $75,000 to support our\ncoaching program which hopes to go live\nin about ten days to two weeks and we're\ngonna try to help people like we're\nactually trying to create that\nconnection that will is talking about so\nwill says like if you want someone you\nneed someone in your life who's like\nnon-judgmental doesn't have to be like a\ntrained professional\nand that's exactly what that's the\nspirit behind the coaching program is so\nfascinating to hear them say that so\nwe're trying to train people to do\nsomething like what I do and it turns\nout that that's expensive to do so if\nyou guys can support us we'd really\nappreciate it and yeah we have a bunch\nof people we've had 500 people apply to\nbecome trained coaches so thank you very\nmuch oh god\nwait I can trade because there's an icon\nthat's covering my stream chocolate no I\ncan trade what happened"
