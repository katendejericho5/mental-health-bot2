    "transcript": "mm-hmm so I'm I'm gonna use like an\nanalogy with food okay okay so I was\neating eggs and toast this morning\nand I was sitting next to my\ntwo-year-old and she wanted to buy to my\neggs and I said sure honey take a bite\nof my eggs and then I asked her can I\nhave a bite of your eggs and she said no\nbecause you're my eggs daddy and I was\nlike how is that fair is that I mean I\nrealize that it's like really apples and\noranges and night and data compared to\nwhat you're talking about but is that\nthe general sentiment that you're\nletting these people in and they're not\nletting and they're pushing you out\nokay let's do this all right hey so am i\ncalling you milena is that right yeah\nthat's my name\nthat's my real name and twitch name and\neverything okay Oh anyone twitch mm-hmm\nokay cool\nso how are you handling Kovan um right\nnow I'm in Sweden and I'm stuck here\nokay I'm separated from my fiancee okay\nwho's best aney okay about that yeah\nyeah exactly\nso that kind of sucks but it's it's okay\nwhat about you yeah so I am NOT\nquarantined from my partner we are\ntogether so I'm actually with my family\nwe move from Boston to Texas actually\nfor the duration of kovat because we\nhave a relatively small place in Boston\nand I have two young children and so\nthey need a place to run around so we\ncame down here for a little while so\nit's been yeah it's been interesting you\nknow we had to ship down some stuff and\nmost of our stuff is still up there and\nthings like that but so like I\nunderstand the topic today is like trust\nissues can you help me understand what\nthat means\num so I would say especially since I got\nout I'm not sure if it's because I'm\ngetting like older or if it's because\nI've been on the internet or or if it's\nbecause I've been traveling like outside\nof Sweden or if it's because I've been\nin America a lot I feel like a lot of\npeople lately it's been like\ndisappointing me and it feels like I've\nmet like a lot of people that it's like\nit's always like turned out really\ndramatic or I felt like they've like\nbecome really mean basically and it just\nmakes me feel like like it's like hard\nfor me to like trust people okay and I'm\nnot sure if it's because I've been like\nnaive in the past or if it's like sure\nyeah\nyeah it can be hard if like people you\nknow if you give someone your trust and\nthen they don't you know treat it well\nand they hurt you in some way or it can\nbe hard to trust me\nyou kind of get like betrayed you know\nwhen you trust them yeah and it feels\nlike it's been like happening like\nalmost like if like I'm like a lot like\noh yeah lately yeah like in like just a\nyear it's been like a lot of really like\ndramatic events and stuff wow that\nsounds wrong yeah I don't know it's I'm\nvery like surprised and it's I remember\na few months ago I felt like like it may\nbe like sad especially like scared like\nmeeting new people and stuff no\ninteresting so you've found yourself\npulling back a little bit because of\nwhat had happened and can you tell me a\nlittle bit about what what happened over\nthe last year you said like uh several\nevents what do you mean by that yeah and\nif there's anything you're not\ncomfortable sharing just let me know I'm\njust I don't yeah I don't think it's it\nwould be like good to like talk about\nlike very varies like specific things\nokay because there's like people that\nmaybe don't want that information to\nlike come out like Foley but there's it\nhas been out like the information it's\nlike out there for sure but I used I\nused to feel like I think something that\nwas like really good about me was that I\nused to like see a lot of positivity me\nlike positivity and stuff in people and\nnow I feel like I don't do that as much\nanymore and it's kind of I don't know\nhow to say like the old turnings Nazi\npositivity and people anymore\nit's um hmm\nI I just feel a bit scared it's almost\nlike it almost feels a bit trippy I\ndon't know it's like it's just like so\nmuch it's just like intense I don't know\nhmm what's intense about it like it\nfeels almost like a bit unreal so it\ndoes it feel unreal because it's very\ndifferent from the way that you've seen\npeople before so you're kind of like\nlooking at like the world seems like a\ndifferent place to you or is it is that\nwhat you mean I'm I'm a little bit I'm\ntrying to attain it what's unreal about\nthat um I'm not sure if maybe it was\nlike that before it but I use couldn't\nreally realize it but I see so the issue\nwas like and this kind of goes back to\nearlier you were kind of saying like you\nwere wondering now whether you were\nnaive before or I mean do you believe\nyou were naive before what you are now\nlike that's what I've been told by\npeople so I don't know people tell me\nlike it's just like how the world is\nsort of but he just like kind of sucks\nbecause I really feel like I mean well\nit's a lot of people and I would I would\nsay that I'm pretty like genuine and\nlike very generous yeah so it's tough\nespecially like we're the kind of\nrelationship that me and my fiancée us\nand everything - what kind of\nrelationship do you hear in your field\nwhat is that you have an open\nrelationship and help I mean so I have a\nI have an idea of what that means what\nwhat do you mean can you help me\nunderstand what that means like like\nwe're able to like see people both\nromantically and sexually like outside\nof themselves it's basically yeah okay\nand and your relationship with DES you\nsay he's your fiance and so you guys\nhave a romantic relationship yeah can\nyou help me understand a little bit\nabout is that something that you're\ninterested in talking about today or do\nyou want to talk kind of more about\ntrust and other people I think\neverything just like goes like okay so\ntell me a little can you just tell me a\nlittle bit about your relationship with\ndestiny\nlike how you guys met and we met so I\nwas a friend of him okay like what is it\ntwo years ago and you guys are watching\nit on YouTube so I didn't know what\ntwitch was and then I yeah I I found out\nthat he had Instagram so it takes him\nthere and then we start chatting and\nthen he I was at UCL at the time\ntraveling around like in a van\nhe was like living life being very happy\nprobably like yeah like one of the most\nlike happiest times I've ever had\nyeah and then Charlie look at that time\num so so like five years ago\nI went to New Zealand with my mom and my\ntwo sisters and we went there because\nI'm a huge slaughtered ring-spun so yeah\nwe went there and when I got there I\nfelt like I felt like that's like where\nI'm supposed to be so I saved up a lot\nof money for about three four years\nstill when I was in high school and then\nafter high school I worked a lot to like\nget over there and my whole plan was\nbasically it's like go there and like\nstarted life here because I wasn't\nreally want to do there in New Zealand\nand how old are you now I'm 21 I'm 22 in\nthe summer 21 and 22 okay oh yeah I'm\ntrying to this summer\nokay and and so you had this idea to\nmove to New Zealand when you were like\n18 um\nno like 16 16 okay yes so then you saved\nup money for three or four years and\nthen then what happened they I went\nthere we bought a car or like a van and\nwe lived in that one basically and just\nlike travelled around I really like\ntravelling I'm really into traveling me\nand my partner at the time thanks okay\nso you guys traveled around New Zealand\nand that was one of the happiest times\nof your life what was happy about it\ncool yeah I'm I'm very I'm very much of\na person that really really like\ntraveling and I really like I don't know\nthe people are very nice very like open\nand like genuine and like happy and\nadventurous and everyone just likes to\nlike do fun things and create fun\nmemories and I would say that I'm like\nthat kind of person as well I've never\nreally felt like I belong in Sweden\nwhere I come from hmm\nI don't I've never really felt like it\nfit in what\nwhat about feeding the Sweden hasn't fit\nwith you um I think it's it's just like\nI ever never really felt like I'm not\nsure if it's because of like if my I\ndon't know I would say that I sort of\ngrew up with the idea of that Sweden\nwasn't really the place for me to be and\nI'm not sure if it has to do with has\nthat been the feeling that you've had\nyou just kind of always known that yeah\nyeah cool that was a kid like very young\nyeah so I was just like planning to let\ngo there and everything and that was\nsuper fun and then Stephen came down and\nthat was really really good and then\nyeah who's Steve destiny see you were\nyou're travelling in New Zealand mm-hmm\nand and destiny came to visit you\nyeah oh wow this is that the first time\nyou all had met yeah okay you're making\nthat sound so matter-of-fact but I think\nit's quite remarkable is that it's\nConnect Gracie it's kind of like I'm\nlike yeah that you yeah that I found him\nMegan started like what she's like\ncontent and stuff and then I got in\ncontact with him and then yeah he flew\nall the way down there and that was\nreally good and we got along really well\nand then we continued talking and then I\nused like flew over to him and then we\nlike been travelling around together and\nlike doing stuff okay and so you said\nyou were traveling in New Zealand with\nyour partner at the time right so when\ndestiny came to visit you you guys were\nfriends or was there a kind of a\nromantic element to the relationship so\nthis person that I was together with\nback then he\nand I reword together for about four\nyears and we had a polyamorous\nrelationship which meant that we could\nlike date multiple people at the same\ntime okay now we decided that hmm I\nsorry what's the difference between the\npolyamorous and open or is there one I\nwould guess that polyamorous means more\nthat you can like have feelings for\nmultiple people at the same time and\nstuffing you like date them okay well\nyou think it's like dating I guess like\nI think the labels are like bad I just\nthink she's like I'm very like okay sure\nand and what so but I'm just trying to\nunderstand when you use the word open\nrelationship and use the word\npolyamorous or those the same thing or\nthose different I would say that we\nmaybe used open now because we're not\nlike living with like a third person or\nlike dating another person at the moment\nokay so it's just like we're dating each\nother we're not dating anyone else\nthey're like whenever we go to see\npeople we can like have feelings and\nstuff for them as well or like have some\nsort of romantic relationship with them\nbut we're not like like living with them\nbecause I think both of us would see\nliving with someone it's like more of a\ndating thing for us so okay so so like\nlike like a polyamorous relationship\npeople sometimes like live together with\nlike multiple partners yeah I think we\ncan do that if you want sure I think\nit's just it's very non-monogamous\nthat's maybe that's like a better word\nfor a non-monogamous really so an open\nrelationship is a little bit more like\nprimarily monogamous but open is that\nyeah I guess I would say maybe like a\nnon-monogamous is the right word to use\nI don't know it's just words okay like\nwait where yeah we can see multiple\npeople at the same like yeah okay same\ntime and so okay so you you started so\nbut you guys were when Dustin he came to\nvisit you guys were friends or was there\nlike a romantic element to that no I\ndidn't see anything romantic it was a\nfunny thing maybe like we texted and\nstuff and it was fun and yeah I do\nunderstand why he was coming to visit\nyou\nlike why he did that yeah he probably\nthought it was like a fun idea and I\nthink he needed a break like from\nstreaming and like from yeah like\neverything in his life at the moment and\nhe lives somewhere in North America\nright he lives in California\nokay okay so you thought that he was\ncoming to see you because he kind of\nneeded a break to recharge and and yeah\nand that's not of a sick fun yeah\ncertainly it's a very nice place it's\nlike it's like a great looking like\nvacation home was he on there for about\ntwo weeks okay so it sounds like you\nguys had a lot of a lot of fun sounds\ngreat yeah yeah it was fun we did like\nadventure stuff and like some beautiful\nthings like mountains like just like\nreally really fun I'm very adventurous\nI like planning like adventurous stuff\ncool though that's what we did you\nstrike me as somewhat of a free spirit\nyeah I'm like I'm very um I like to\ntravel I'm like very I have a lot of\nlove to give mm-hm and iced tea or\nwhatever yeah and yeah that's I feel\nlike I figure out like what the meaning\nof like my life is sort of it's just\nthat yeah I don't know it just gets me\nsad when I see people like being like I\ndon't know\nyou know like about the trust thing\nwhatever yes all right\nMalita I mean I'm honestly a little bit\nconfused cuz I really don't understand\nwhat you mean by that because I don't\nyou know you're saying that and we don't\nhave to talk about it cuz you mentioned\nthat you kind of don't want to mention\nit but I'm confused by what you mean by\nthat\nokay right so like let me just tell you\nwhat I heard so I'm envisioning you know\nMolina traveling around New Zealand\nbeing very adventurous free spirit never\nreally tied to Sweden and and that's\nkind of who you are and I'm I see that\nperson and I understand where she's\ncoming from and I feel like I know her a\nlittle bit and then something changes\nand I can see how like that person could\nchange a little bit if if she gave her\ntrust too easily or too freely or maybe\npeople took advantage or something like\nthat I'm not so sure that I quite see\nthat way because I think you're a giver\nlike I think wait what are you talking\nabout I'm talking about you I think\nyou're a giver\nyeah yeah I would say so yeah and I\nthink that would even like probably call\nme a fixer I like I like I like like you\nlike make people happy around me yeah so\nyou know it's interesting fixer has such\na negative connotation to it right yeah\nmaybe yeah\nbut Adam I'm not sure if it's like a\ngood thing and I think you probably you\nprobably can't fix anyone I don't know\nabout thoughts on the past but now I\nfeel like I maybe I can't can I tell you\nsomething completely random and\nunrelated to what we're talking about\nany interest in religion or spirituality\npsychedelics okay so I just like to\nshare with you like a concept from the\nHindu tradition that I think actually\nkind of describes you pretty well I'm\nnot saying that it's not really real\nit's just a way of conceptualizing\npeople so when I look at you what I see\nis something called Shakti Shakti is the\nSun script word for energy in the\ninteresting thing in the Sanskrit\nlanguage is that energy is a feminine\nword so the idea of energy actually has\nlike a feminine connotation to it and\nit's sort of like kind of a I mean this\nis gonna sound yeah it's kind of weird\nso like energy is just sort of a\nfeminine word and and this could be my\nyou know very much a bias of the culture\nthat I was raised in or studying some of\nthese things but I feel like I've met\nsome women who were just givers and\nseemed to almost give out their energy\nto other people and I've also noticed\nthat so the other thing about Shakti is\nit sort of like a maternal kind of\nenergy or it can be and this may have\nsomething to do with you know primitive\ncultures and when they think about\ncreating life like that is like a very\nenergy intensive process and it's like\nthe woman who creates life so spend a\nlot of academic study around like you\nknow 5,000 years ago when people were\nliving in India they sort of felt like\nenergy is of feminine quality which is a\nlittle bit different in Western culture\nand so sometimes I meet people who I\nthink have\nshucks D so shucks D also is the word\nit's the word for energy it's also the\nword for goddess and so that that like\nthere are some kind of maternal or\nmaternal figures that sort of give\nenergy out to other people and you\nstrike me as one of those people who\nsort of gives of themselves to other\npeople and then like and and kind of\nthere's this idea that like all energy\nin the universe comes from the goddess\nit's not actually doesn't come from God\nit comes from the feminine version of\nGod and just listening to you and\ntalking to you and even looking at you I\nsort of that where Chuck T comes to mind\nbecause you seem to me to be a very\nenergetic and giving person and other\npeople I would guess so people who I've\nmet who seem to have a Shakti like yours\nI'd say that you're almost like a light\nthat people are attracted to and it's\nlike they're drawn to you because you\ngive so freely and then people who are\nkind of hungry come and want a piece of\nyour energy and you give it so freely\nfreely to them and they live in a world\nwhere energy is not freely given and so\nit can be very very intoxicating for\nthem to like be in your presence because\nyou so you are open in a world where\nmost people have trust issues does that\nmake sense at all\nyeah does that fit at all with kind of\nyour experience about people kind of\ncoming to you to take your radiance for\nlack of a better term yeah yeah I would\nsay so can you tell me in what way it\nfits with you like what resonates about\nthat\nI feel like like in situations for\nexample when if I've had like a really\nclose relationship with someone and it's\nlike really good and really fun and they\nfeel like they get like help from me and\nstuff and I like like doing that with\nthem and I like to like make them happy\nand stuff it's really like it happens a\nlot that something happens that makes\nthem do something really mean or like\nhurtful towards me and then a time goes\nby and they come back later and it feels\nreally weird yeah I don't know it feels\nreally strange that's that's a very\nthat's a great description so I think\nthat's kind of what I envisioned that\nalmost like a mother right a mother is\nsomeone that you have a conflict with\nbut then like you always kind of go back\ndoes that sort of make sense like it's\nalmost like that kind of psychological\nyeah maybe and it just yes if it feels\nlike I'm getting used somehow so it\nsounds like the relationship is lopsided\nso one of the hard things unfortunately\nfor people who have this Shakthi is that\ntheir relationships often become\none-sided and oddly enough I don't\nnecessarily think that's a bad thing\nonce you understand it like once you\nunderstand that you have something to\ngive anyway well we'll maybe get there\nmaybe but can you give me an example\nbecause I'm just still having trouble\nsort of envisioning like can you give me\nan example of this happening um I think\nit's like the people that I get\ninterested in like romantically not like\nat the time now but like you have it's\nhappened in the past and stuff then\nthere's also like friends this is\nsomething that people just like\ngenerally know but like because of all\nthe drama that's happened like between\nme and Stephen and like other people\nthat gets involved with like us\nromantically or like sexually whatever\nthere's been a lot of people getting\nreally jealous probably and turn out\nlike being really mean or trying to like\nsabotage and stuff and that feels really\nshitty because I feel very generous and\nI've never done anything to them\nlike that's bad or can you give me an\nexample of sabotage what does that mean\nlike trying to make me feel bad how do\nthey try to make you feel bad they try\nto make me feel jealous Horace I think I\nthink what gosh no I feel like wait\njust like being really mean and stuff\nfor like tried to make me feel bad that\nthey had some sort of romantic or sexual\nrelationship with my partner basically\nby saying mean things are tried to like\ntell me that they're sort of like the\none instead of me or something like that\nbasically so when someone says they're\nthe one instead of you or like they're\nnot saying it but they meet like they\nmean it by their actions and stuff\nencounter and I'm gonna so let me let me\ntell you can I explain why I'm asking\nyou such specific questions so you're\nsaying that people you're talking about\nyour experience of people's actions\nright you're saying they try to make me\nfeel bad they try to make me feel\njealous whereas in my experience often\ntimes people don't try to make someone\nfeel a certain way usually when people\nmake other people feel bad that's like a\nconic it's not the intended consequence\nit's like almost like collateral damage\nso for example let's say that I had a\nrelationship with destiny and I felt\nlike I was in love with him I may make\nyou feel like I'm the one or I may make\nyou feel like I think I'm the one but\nthat's not because I'm trying to make\nyou feel a certain way it's because I\nwant destiny all to myself does that\nmake sense and so I could understand how\nyou would feel that way but I don't\nnecessarily know that they're intending\nto make you feel that way like I've had\ngirls basically like shutting like the\ndoor in front of me with like that\nperson and him in the room like like\nclinging on him and stuff and like\nlooking me in the eyes and like shutting\nthe door in front of me and tada make me\nfeel how does that make you feel like\nI just don't understand like why\nwhatever he done like I think so okay so\nwhy I really like this her relationship\nand I know there's a lot of people like\nnaming and stuff on the internet that\nI'm the one getting all of this like\nlike yeah the extra but the free\nrelationship whatever like I know the\none who's getting to see people and\nstuff a lot of people think that but\nlike wait what have you been going with\nthis so you were telling me that someone\nshut the door in your face and I'm like\nsomeone you there's a physical room\nwhere Destiny's in it and there's\nanother person and they shut the door in\nyour face oh yeah so I mean I think the\nmost like the the best thing about this\nkind of relationship for me is that I\nmake it possible for my partner that I\nlove to like experience multiple things\nin life and not just me you understand\nfor the rest of her or his life or\nwhatever right and and I also feel like\nI really do love him so much and it\nmakes me happy thinking that he can like\ngive that happiness to other people as\nwell\nso when people start like being really\nmean and stuff and like this star job\nand stuff and they they absolutely don't\nhave to it makes me really sad why don't\nthey have to start drama because I think\nthey like probably hopefully get but\nthey like can or one like I hope they\nknow that what they can get out of it\nyou know yeah but what if they what they\nwant is exclusivity then I guess it's I\ndon't know I don't think it's like it\ndoesn't have to like me and me right now\nwe're like yeah I completely agree with\nyou so I'm just so I'm gonna put myself\nin the shoes of the person who closes\nthe door in your face for a moment right\nso I'm imagining if I want exclusivity\nwith destiny then it's on me to try to\nget it and part of that involves closing\nthe door in your face right and what are\nyou feeling right now you look like\nyou're getting a little bit\nI'm sorry today no it's okay I'm curious\nwhat you're feeling\nit's I think it's just really unfair\nwhat's unfair about it it does seem\nunfair to me too it sounds to me like\nyou're being open but the other people\nthat you invite into your relationship\nor not being as open as you are is that\nwhat feels unfair about it yeah because\nI don't know like I don't really know\nlike I guess like that is makes me feel\nlike I'm losing hope and people around\nme I don't know because I just want\neveryone to like be happier I mean it's\njust like everything it's really\ncomplicated I don't know or I don't know\nall right when they don't when they do\nthat it's just really unfair\nwhat's unfair about it because I feel\nlike I'm just like giving them a lot of\nlike happiness it's also the other way\naround they could be they could be like\npeople getting jealous of him as well\nlike because they want to be with me and\nI'm like I can't like even though like I\ngive them almost like oh I can't I don't\nknow it just feels like I don't know I\ndon't get it\nyeah let me see Mike I understand you\nyeah I know it's really it's really like\ncomplicated it's like a lot but what\nwhat's complicated about it it seems\nlike it's hard for you to understand\nthey were like not understand but like\nit's hard to like explain maybe yeah so\nlet me see if I understand so I'm gonna\nuse like an analogy with food okay okay\nso I was eating eggs and toast this\nmorning\nand I was sitting next to my two year\nold and she wanted to buy two my eggs\nand I said sure honey take a bite of my\neggs and then I asked her can I have a\nbite of your eggs and she said no these\nare my eggs daddy and I was like how is\nthat fair\nis that I mean I realize that it's like\nreally apples and oranges and night and\ndata compared to what you're talking\nabout but is that the general sentiment\nthat you're letting these people in and\nthey're not letting and they're pushing\nyou out like you're letting this person\ninto presumably your home I don't know\nexactly if it's your home or you know\ncuz you say that Dustin's your fiancee\nbut and so I'm I'm a little bit you know\nI'm confused about the logistics of like\nwho's living where and you know where\nare you and is that your home\nlike I live in Sweden so I'm only like\nvisiting him Thank You Missy\nso there's like there's someone who\nshuts the door in your face and in a\nsense I mean I guess I have a certain\npossessiveness when you use the word\nfiance like I feel like you have dibs\nyou have the first right to destiny if\nyou want someone else and maybe that's\nwrong maybe that that's not a friend\nit's not really boyfriend that seems\nkind of but partner I guess I don't know\nI don't know it's just words to me yeah\nbut I mean I'm wondering like who's got\ndibs right like does it do you get like\nso you're the one who is that like if\nyou're if you're in a relationship with\nsomeone who's your fiance like you sort\nof you know let other people into your\nrelationship right but it's still you\nletting the men they don't have a right\nto come in it's like you you're choosing\nto open the door and they're you're\nletting them walk in if they want to but\nit's still your door to open or close I\nguess like the only boundary basically\nthat I haven't they were like the\nboundary that we have is that if there's\nsomeone that we were interested in there\nwere like doing some romantic or sexual\nthing with if they don't respect our\nrelationship or or it tries to like\nsabotage it or whatever or doesn't like\nhates the other one like that's like the\nboundary basically and it feels like\neverything is going well until there's\nlike some point it doesn't and it's and\nthen I feel like I was like I don't know\nshe's really I think it's really sad\nwhat's sad about it because I I used to\nhave like a lot of hope for for people\nto just I don't know I think it's like a\nbeautiful thing that there's not really\nlike any I don't see love in some sort\nof\nwhen it comes to relationships basically\nI think that's really for me that's\nstrange\nand so if love isn't control what's\nhurtful about someone closing the door\nin your face what makes it hard for you\nto just appreciate that there you know\nthat that person and destiny are about\nto share something beautiful why is that\nhurtful to you it's not like that it's\nused more I don't think I don't think he\nthinks that because like that person is\nnot really respecting us by being mean\nto one another like to any of us\nbasically so like that person is not\nrespecting you guys I wouldn't say so if\none of it like if that person starts to\nlike get really mean and stuff for it\nbut is closing the door in your faces\nthat mean I would say so okay like try\nto make me feel bad try to make you feel\nbad yeah why do you think they're trying\nto make you feel bad because they\nprobably wants him for themselves but\nhow but see in my mind those are two\ndifferent things\nwe know so so maybe this is it so I'd\nlike to clarify this in my mind like\nlet's say there's a pancake and just\nbecause I want to eat the pancake\ndoesn't mean I want to take the pancake\naway from someone else does that make\nsense so you so in my mind you're kind\nof just because somebody wants destiny\ndoesn't mean that they want to hurt you\nlike they get mean in other ways as well\nlike one of them made fun of me for\nbeing Swedish because they wanted me to\nfeel like [ __ ] like why do you think\nthey won't hurt you because they they\nprobably wants to be in my position and\nwhat is your position like the person\nthat lives for them and sees them every\nsingle day so you get to like spend my\nlife with them in that way\nokay\nand that makes sense to me so it sounds\nlike they're jealous yeah and so let me\njust take a step back so it sounds like\nI feel like I'm getting it now so thank\nyou so much for explaining let me see if\nI get it okay so you have this kind of\nyou know view that relationship so you\nlove destiny in destiny loves you okay\nand that you guys have this open\nrelationship and you think it's a\nbeautiful thing to be able to love and\nto be loved and you think that it's you\nknow beautiful to share that love and\nfor other people to experience destinies\nlove because you've experienced it as\nwell and it's a wonderful thing and you\nwant to share that so you're kind of\nyou're inviting everyone to the table\nand let's all meet together right yeah\nyeah absolutely\nand and so everyone kind of brings it's\nlike a potluck so everyone brings\nsomething and then we all share what we\nall have to bring\nyeah and so you also have this idea that\nlike other people can come to the table\nand share in the way that you do yeah it\nworks it works sometimes but it feels\nlike most of the times things has gone\nlike really bad and like really horrible\nreally bad and really horrible I would\nsay so or like it's been like it's been\nI would say it's horrible because I feel\nI feel like I feel like tired or I feel\nlike that and it feels like it's like\nreally like affecting me pretty hard\nwhat feels bad like the the way I start\nto view people around me starts to come\nreally negative and every time there's\nlike a new person coming in I get really\nscared instead of like being happy as I\nused to be yeah and what not what do you\nthink about that why do you think you're\nstarting did you think it's really\nbecause I feel like I've gotten like\ndisappointed\nso much so many times so I start to like\nfeel really scared and that's like more\nthings happening and yeah and do you\nalready\nand are you afraid that at some point\nyou're gonna have to change the way that\nyou view people yeah but I think it's\nthe worst waiter you may be well it's\nnot fun it's not it's not like I don't\nknow there seems like everyone has so\nmany issues and it's like everything is\njust chaos like everyone is putting is\nlike their issues and everyone else\naround them instead of least I don't\nknow I think it's really sad I think\nit's sad too\nI think it's sad that the world isn't a\nperfect place and that people aren't\nperfect is there a part of you that\ndoesn't want to be in a polyamorous or\nopen relationship not if I'm gonna get\nhurt by people like this so you know\nthat but that's it like it's not like I\ndon't I don't think about it but I start\nto like it scared that I'm going to like\na bad path what's a bad path it just\nstarts to affect me like mentally really\nbad I guess but more like experiences\nthat's like really horrible yeah so if\nwould you be willing to be in a non\npolyamorous relationship you would feel\nreally strange to me like try to control\nmy partner [ __ ] it comes for my partner\nfrom feeling things for other people\nah interesting so you think that a non\npolyamorous relationship involves\ncontrolling your partner's feelings yeah\nfor me it does huh that's not my\nimpression of most monogamous\nrelationships I don't know it seems like\nthere's a lot of jealous hint stuff and\nwhy is there John I'm confused why's it\nhave you been in a monogamous\nrelationship before\nhowever so what's your understanding of\nwhat a monogamous relationship is\nbasically want to be with one person\nromantically and sexually you want to be\nwith one person what do you mean by the\nword want like that's that's what you\nlike the way you choose time yeah so I I\nlike the word choose said two-year-old\nis outside my window now he's confused\nso I think I'm a little bit curious you\nknow that you're do you feel like you\nwould be a less good person if you chose\nto be a monogamous relationship like\nyour take I haven't thought about it so\ncan I share with you what my\nunderstanding of a monogamous\nrelationship is so I don't think it's\nabout controlling anyone's feelings in\nfact I don't think it's about\ncontrolling at all I think a good\nmonogamous relationship has nothing to\ndo with control a good monogamous\nrelationship has everything to do this\nchoice so it's when two people choose to\nengage in a romantic and sexual\nrelationship only with each other and I\ndon't think that there's any controlling\nto feelings like I don't think that so I\ndon't think it's reasonable to expect\npeople to control their own feelings let\nalone have your partner control your\nfeelings that sounds like a toxic\nrelationship to me when one partner\ntries to control the the way that the\nother partner feels that sounds toxic to\nme I'd say that that people have\nfeelings towards other human beings\nthat's completely normal I can be\nromantically or sexually interested with\npeople that are not my wife she can be\nromantically or sexually interested in\npeople that are not me that's completely\nreasonable human beings have feelings we\ndon't really control our feelings what\nwe control are our actions and so I\nthink\na monogamous relationship is a choice\nthat your actions that you're going to\nrestrain certain certain feelings and\nnot choose to act on them for the sake\nof supporting a particular relationship\nwhat do you think about that make you\nsay that one more time\nthe last thing yeah so like it's not\nabout controlling your feelings it's\nabout controlling your actions for the\nsake of your relationship right so I\nchoose to not act upon the impulses that\nI have towards other women because I\nvalue my relationship more than a\nrelationship with another woman okay\nwhat do you think about that I guess it\nmakes sense what makes sense about it\nthat it's about like your actions for\nthe other like I don't know I don't know\nwhat to say\nsure did I because I don't think minami\nmonogamy is about control like that\nthat's my main point I think it's about\nchoice right it's sort of like I mean I\ncan choose to live in a van and drive\naround in New Zealand and that's I'm not\nsaying that that's good or bad I'm\nsaying that or I can choose to have a\nhouse and live there every day and sleep\nin the same place every day I'm not\nplacing a value judgment I'm just saying\nthat they're different you think a lot\nof people should like use it as some\nsort of control absolutely I I think\nthat people are [ __ ] and I think\nthat being in a polyamorous relationship\ndoes not protect you from [ __ ] and I\nthink that being a monogamous\nrelationship does not protect you from\n[ __ ] although arguably yeah although\narguably being in a polyamorous\nrelationship protects you less from\n[ __ ] because there are more people\ncoming in and out of the door of your\nrelationship does that make sense\nI just think statistically like you know\nif yeah with me I mean I'm not trying to\nadvocate that you should be in a\nmonogamous relationship or are you\ngetting that\nNo okay it's just your perception of a\nmonogamous relationship is different\nfrom the way that I see it and so what\nare you thinking let me just think for a\nsecond\nso no part of you wants to be in a\nmonogamous relationship of course I\ncould I could like I could probably be\nhappy with one person but I don't really\nI don't feel like it's necessary for me\nto like like try to like tell my partner\nthat that partner and I can't see anyone\nelse than me yes so that actually sounds\na lot like monogamy oddly enough so when\nyou tell me why so because I think that\nin my wife I don't think at least I mean\nI don't think I've ever you know my I'd\nlike to think that my wife doesn't see\nother people because I tell her not to\nshe doesn't see other people because she\nchooses not to all right I mean I should\nspeak for myself so my wife hasn't told\nme that you know you're I'm not allowed\nto see other women it's just we sort of\nmade a mutual choice that we're not\ngonna do that so I don't get the sense\nthat I'm controlled by her at least not\nin this aspect when it comes to how much\nI play games and things like that she\ndefinitely is very controlling you know\nlike so that's the thing is I mean you\nkeep on using the word control when when\nyou talk about a monogamous relationship\nand certainly there are people who are\ncontrolling but I just don't know that\nthat's restricted to monogamy so help me\nunderstand what do you mean by fiancee\nare you guys engaged to be married can\nyou help me understand a little bit\nabout how y'all decided to do that so we\ncan continue dating each other what does\nmarriage have to do with that because\nI'm the Swedish citizen I see so just\nfrom a logistical perspective it's hard\nfor you to visit him so often unless so\nit's kind of like if if laws\ndid not prevent you if you lived in the\nUS and you had a green card or something\nlike that would you guys be getting\nmarried I don't know\nthat's that's another dimension okay but\nlike yeah so I'm just hearing that that\nso it seems like it's primarily a legal\nthing it's not like you guys know we\nlove it should want to get married okay\nso you guys so you value the instant\nlike that marriage means something to\nyou yeah of course okay I agree we go\nthrough a lot to like be able to like be\ntogether oh yeah yeah yeah what does it\nmean to you to go through so much yeah\nlike with the person yeah that we become\nreally strong I would say what are you\nfeeling now\nand some sort of a happy accident notes\nif there's like we go through a lot of\nthings together if we become really good\nI don't think I've ever got through so\nmuch with so much in the fact that you\nguys have stayed together through it all\nseems to be really important yeah\nbecause it sounds like last year the\nlast year of your life has been really\ntough yeah but we always come out\ntogether which is really cool it sounds\nlike you can really count on him yeah\nyeah I really really do love him so much\nI used to I used to get scared when like\nmore like bad stuff happens because I\njust want us to be together so bad mix\nwhat are you afraid of I'm scared that\nI'm not gonna be able to uh should I go\nthrough it go through a while and just\nthank you more like difficult scenarios\nthat could basically be other people or\njust [ __ ] pandemic or like his\npaperwork like all of this stuff but you\nso you know there's like a lot of like\nscary stuff then yeah baby you're not\ngonna be strong enough yeah where do you\nget that idea because I'm not sure how\nmuch I can push myself right all right\nwhy are you pushing diesel because\nbecause because that because it's really\nimportant for me and for him to to do\nthat help me understand what so when you\nsay the phrase push yourself I think\nabout like when I push myself there's a\npart of me that wants to do something\nand there's a part of me that doesn't\nwant to do something and so the part of\nme that wants to do it pushes the part\nthat doesn't want to do it that's what\npushing yourself is right what is the\npart of you what do you\nwant to push yourself to do what do you\nmean practically does that look like in\nyour relationship or in your life if\nit's like it's just like a really hard\none to climb I guess what's the mountain\naankhen having trouble understanding\nwhen you're combining a lot of feelings\nand imagery so I get the sense that it's\na tall you know there's a long road\nahead of you right and it seems really\nawesome that it's actually been a long\nroad behind you too and you guys have\nbeen through it together and y'all are\nstill here y'all are still together and\nthere's still a long way to go that I\nunderstand but I'm not quite sure what\nthe mountain looks like it could be a\njust think about it like being me like\nleaving New Zealand or like going to\nAmerica away from like a lot of friends\nmmm\nSweden or being away from my friends in\nNew Zealand or having a lot of audience\non the internet or having not being able\nto work because I can't work in America\nby giving up a lot of things you know\nWow crazy people and like go through\nlike a lot and then now have long\ndistance that I don't know when it's\nkind like this like a lot of things yeah\noh my god\nvery intense yeah it sounds overwhelming\nactually I mean issues of yeah I mean it\nsounds like being stuck in Sweden is\nreally rough on you\nyeah I don't want to be here you never\nwanted to be there no can I just think\nfor a second\nit's so scary yeah I mean cuz you don't\nknow what's gonna happen right you don't\nknow what you're gonna like you're\nthinking about what you're gonna give up\nand what you're giving it up for and you\ndon't know when it's gonna happen or\nwhat's gonna happen or I mean I can just\nimagine that like if you're giving up\nyour friends in New Zealand and Sweden\nto move to America and you're streaming\non Twitch and or there are other\nstreamers that have been part of the\ndrama between like involving you and\ndestiny or it's like non streamer people\nthere's three men on streaming people\nyeah so just kind of like you know what\nI'm hearing from you is that you're\nengaged in this world right this world\nof destiny and and open relationships\nand and streaming and some of that stuff\nhas been awesome and is amazing and is\nlike really really a solid foundation\nfor you to build on and some of it\nsounds like it's been kind of like\nreally toxic and hurtful and what I'm\nthe thing that just hearing everything\nthat you said the thing that kind of\nworries me the most is you're you're\nsort of diving into all of that really\nquick really fast yeah yeah you're\nreally going yeah I'm only 21 I think\nit's like a lot of it's a lot you know\nwhat do you think about when are you\nguys gonna get married do you know if\nKovac wasn't happening y'all talked\nabout him I was supposed like why I'm in\nSweden it's basically because I had to\ndo an interview but I can't do because\nthe American Embassy is closed I see and\nand what do you think about getting\nengaged at the age of 21 doesn't it\ndoesn't like to me it doesn't really\nmean like I'm like becoming something\ndifferent like it doesn't really do that\nfor me like what it means is probably\nbut I'm going through a lot for a person\nthat I really love and that I really\ncare about and then I want to be bit and\nhow long do you guys think you're gonna\nbe together well here for the rest of my\nlife sure\nyeah I hope so too it sounds like it's a\nstrong relationship that you've talked\nto him - yeah I'm a huge fan of\ndestinies he's it yeah you know yeah I\nthink it's a right to be honest milena\nI'm a little bit impressed he's in love\nwith you right that's not easy to do\nfor him yeah yeah that was that was also\nstruggled for a long time but yeah I\nthink yes I think we like came to a\npoint where it's like okay\nI think that y'all's relationship is\nreally special yeah that's why I'm like\nI can't like I'm not gonna give that up\n[ __ ] no yeah that's worth fighting for\nmm-hmm just something in particular I\ncan help you with I think you may be\nlike I felt I feel like I don't really\nunderstand myself that well like why I'm\nthe way I am because I feel like like\nwith all of this experience\nit feels like it's very hard for me to\nlike find people that that has gone\nthrough something similar or that it's\nlike really similar like minded to me so\nI feel a little bit lonely with it yeah\nand I feel like I'm not like it yeah you\nfeel alone mm-hmm a bit like with with\nthat like\nwith my life I don't know it's just\npeople are like if I talk to people that\nI used to know like five years ago it's\nlike we don't have anything to talk\nabout and if I really like have a lot of\nthings that I feel like I want to vent\nabout it's like they don't know like\nwhat to say or like they don't really\nknow like they they don't know like they\ncan't understand what do you feel like\nventing about today probably that I'm\nscared you're scared of what what are\nyou afraid of\nmaybe like going in the wrong direction\nwhat direction what is it what what does\nthat look like tell me what the direct\nit's like the way the way life is now\ncompared to what it was about like two\nyears ago is very different and there's\nlike a lot of really cool things but\nit's very very very intense what do you\nknow what's intense about it but there's\nit feels like there's no like time to\nlike process because just like new\nthings all the time happening that gets\nme and I feel like every time something\nnew happens I feel like I get like wait\nlike I feel like I get shattered because\nof it because I feel like oh not another\nlike another thing happening can you\ngive me an example of a new thing that\nhappened recently that made you Saturn\nthe whole Kittery no drama for example\nmake me really sad what is that I don't\nknow what it's kind of a person you know\njust streaming okay what happened what\ncan I say she basically was lying to a\nbunch of people about what and really\n[ __ ] hard to court and I'm sorry like\nher she lied to a lot of people and\nstuff about then about what like\nromantically sort of she cheated on\npeople basically that's what she did she\ncheated on people mm-hm\nwhat does that have to do with you know\nit just it just makes me sad to like see\nthat a person that I am close with can\ndo something like that I see yeah\nbecause I never thought that like I\ndidn't know any like about anything and\nthen we just like came out and it's also\nreally sad that someone might get so\nmuch hate from the dead as well and\nstuff and it's just like really hard\nKaterina I don't know what I hate yeah\nhow do you feel about that I don't think\nanyone deserves that much hate no matter\nwhat they do from so many people I don't\nthink the judgement of the Internet yeah\nit's just but it's just like insane it's\njust crazy and there's\nwe said that so many people can be so\nmean about things they're not like\ninvolved with at all and then that\nsomeone that I care about and really\nlike I love Kate I do like seeing her\nlike doing something like that makes\nthem really sad and then like seeing\npeople that got hurt by it\nfeeling sad it makes me sad too I don't\nknow I just it has nothing to do with me\nbut I just feel sad about like watching\nthings like happening yeah it seems to\nme like you're also someone so this\nhappens with people who have Shakti by\nthe way is that they take on the heart\nof other people so it's almost like so\nthe people that I work with who have\npowerful Shakti's I kind of think of\nthem like a sponge they so they can be a\nwonderful influence for a family or a\ncompany or a relationship because they\ncan absorb a lot of the hurt of other\npeople and that's part of what draws\npeople to you is that you know by by\nhaving you be a part of their\nconversations and things like that they\nactually feel better because it's almost\nlike there's a transfer of their\npainting to you does that sort of make\nsense\nthey say one more time yeah so like it's\nalmost like they're transferring their\npain to you so I kind of think about you\nlike a sponge that's absorbing something\nso if I have like water that's spilled\non the table and I take a sponge and I\nwipe it across the table there's no more\nwater on the table but the water is in\nthe sponge and you are that sponge and\nwhere there used to be like water on the\ntable like now that's filled you're\nholding that and so a lot of people who\nare who have shucked be like you do I\nsee this pattern where I have to teach\nthem how to squeeze out the water from\ntheir sponge because they take it in so\neasily from other people and it's kind\nof like you know you we were talking\nabout this earlier about you giving you\ngive and you also absorb negativity from\nothers and you're very sensitive to\nnegativity you're probably also very\nempathic that's another way that people\nput it and I'm wondering if the reason\nthat you're scared so so I'm sorry you\nwere saying that maybe the way to you\nmaybe the way that I could help you is\nby handling the intensity right\nyou were talking about intensity and all\nthis twitch streaming stuff it's a lot\nof drama on twitch yeah and it sucks I\nfeel like I don't really know what the\n[ __ ] I'm doing here because it because I\ndon't I don't really see myself as being\nlike it's which person like I'm not a\npart of that why are you a part of it\nthen because I the way they are and the\nway they do things and the way people\ntalk and the whole community and all\nthey're like that we call it like the\nvibes from everything is just like very\nlike not from where I come from I'm\nyou're you're you're not built for\nstreaming you're built for being in the\nvan that's driving across New Zealand\nyeah so why are you a part of this\ncommunity\num because it sort of lis just happened\nbecause I'm dating a streamer so and and\nthen I think the the main thing for me\nto do it the first place was to sort of\nmake more people happy with my words or\nwith to like show them like the\nadventures that I do to like make them\nhappy or maybe like try to make them\nfeel like they can get out of there like\ncomputer like chair and like go on an\nadventure sort of because I do that\nbecause it makes me really happy\nso how long have you wanted to make\npeople happy\nI just think that's just my nature it's\njust like how I work I guess mm-hmm I\nthink I've always been like that since I\nwas very like young can you tell me what\ngrowing up in Sweden was like um and two\nsisters two younger ones my mom is very\nvery she's always been very depressed\nvery dramatic very emotional and she's\nbeen putting it out on her kids a lot my\ndad is very he's a happy person but you\ncan tell that he he he gets I can tell\nthat he gets really sad about really\ndramatic sad people so he kind of just\nlike shuts off and like he doesn't\nreally show a lot of feelings in that\nway but like you talk about feelings\nshut off by a dramatic\nyeah like he doesn't if whenever my mom\nwanted to talk to him about something\nshe was like being very very dramatic he\nwould just like go up to his bedroom and\ngo to sleep and she would have sit and\ncry or like take it out on us basically\nthat's like the whole when it comes to\nfamily\nhow would your dad react to you when you\nwere happy I don't remember that\ndid you see you so that you've always\nsort of wanted to make people happy can\nyou tell me a little bit about when you\nsaid your mom was depressed and\nemotional and something you said\nsomething towards for kids what do you\nmean by that\nlike I think she sort of did not think\nabout what to say to her kids she wasn't\nshe said she would tell I don't know she\nwould tell me a lot about her like\nherself feeling really bad stuff how\nwould you feel when she told you those\nkinds of things that it was my that I\nwas supposed to take care of her mm-hmm\nlike make you feel happy you felt a\nresponsibility to make her happy so like\nuh like I became a little bit like your\ntherapist the kid\nsix seven since you were what hold on\nlet me see if I can switch overs since\nyou were seven cuz you're in Europe\nright yeah hmm so it sounds like from a\nyoung age you started to feel like you\nwere giving that energy to her actually\nwhat about to your dad\nhe he was just like a lot on his own\nsort of we're like a little bit like he\nI think the best thing probably like\ngrowing up was probably what my dad even\nthough he doesn't really he didn't\nreally talk about a feeling since though\nhe we ate we used to have a country\nhouse where he grew up so he took us out\nthere and that was probably the best\nthing in my whole childhood because I\njust got to be in nature and just being\nlike alone like taking walks like going\nthis way like it was like being close to\nnature was really important and like\nwatching movies for them and like him\nlike taking us like on walks and stuff\nwas really good even though he didn't\ntalk about feelings and stuff and my mom\ndid it really like come with us on that\nat all she didn't like it hmm\ndo you think maybe the reason you\nenjoyed it was because your mom wasn't\nthere wait what do you think maybe the\nreason hold on let me see if I can\nswitch servers again because it's like\nwe're lagging yeah let's go straight to\nEurope let me just check it real quick\nall right so do you feel like any chance\nthat you reason one of the reasons you\nliked being traveling with your dad was\nbecause your mom didn't come with you\nactually you weren't around her I\nremember we wanted her to come all the\ntime but she didn't she was busy\neverything and I remember there was like\num she if I'll actually focused a lot\nabout I like on like random people all\nthe time I remember that she had some\nsort of friend from another country\ncoming up where about two weeks and she\ntook two weeks like vacation from her\njob because she wanted to like show him\naround in Sweden and I remember I felt\nreally sad because I felt like she never\ntook two weeks off to like be with us\nand yeah I remember I was really sad\nabout that it's funny and maybe this is\na little bit too much of like you know\ntherapist Steve but I I mean it sounds\nto me like now I understand why it was\nso significant for destiny to fly\nhalfway across the world to like hang\nout with you for two weeks why because\nit sounds like it's the exact opposite\nof what your mom did right I mean it's\nlike your your mom would spend go out of\nher way to spend time with a random\nperson from another country but she\nwouldn't come with you to like a cabin\nin the wilderness and and you know so\nshe was prioritizing this random person\nand like for destiny to fly halfway\nacross the world and and spend time with\nyou like he was you like you mattered to\nhim he wanted to be with you and that\nsounds I mean I can sort of see does\nthat seem real that feel related to you\nat all or not really we're lagging hold\non yeah [ __ ]\nis it my entire third I'm not sure if\nit's an Internet to be honest it could\njust be the discord service and maybe\nwe're like how do what do you what do\nyou mean by that like that it's like\nwell I mean I just died so let me try to\nshare a couple of thoughts I don't know\nhow well these are gonna land with you\nso I apologize I'm happy to sort of have\na follow-up conversation to kind of dig\ninto some of this stuff but so the first\nthing Melina is that you know I think\nthat let me just think for a second\nI think it's interesting that you grew\nup in a place where it seems like you\nhad to have your happy feelings on the\noutside and your sad feelings on the\ninside that's kind of the picture that I\nget and I think it really mattered about\nme being said it probably mattered more\nabout other people being said of me\nabsolutely right so that because you\nalso said so it's it's not only your mom\nbecause you kind of said that you were\nsort of your mom's therapist from the\nage of seven you were you would try to\ncomfort her you would try to make her\nhappy but you also said that your dad\nshut down anytime someone approached him\nwith negative emotion and he would\nwithdraw from it so funny yeah so the\nfunny thing there is I'm in imagining\n7-year old you and you have a pile of\nfeelings some of which are good and some\nof which are bad and so if your mom sort\nof takes all the good feelings because\nthose are the ones that you show her\nwhere do you put the bad feelings and\nusually what happens in a relationship\nis you show those feelings to the other\nparent right so like if if like\ntwo-year-old once again if two-year-old\nif I yell at my two-year-old she runs to\nher mom for comfort so anytime like one\nparent puts pressure on a child usually\nthat child turns to the other parent to\nbalance that pressure the tricky thing\nabout your situation\nis that I'm hearing that I can imagine\nthat you probably when you were very\nyoung tried to share your negative\nfeelings with your dad but you noticed\nthat he retreated from them and so you\nhad to be happy with your mom and you\nhad to be happy with your dad and and so\nthat's sort of makes sense because this\nwhole time we've been talking to you and\nit seems like all you really care about\nis other people's happiness like when we\nask you like you belong in a van in New\nZealand and camping and in nature in\nwilderness and why are you streaming\nit's because you want to make other\npeople happy that's what you said so\nyou're sacrificing yourself for the sake\nof making other people happy\nand would you say that you're someone\nwho does that yeah\nand then we get to the polyamorous\nrelationship and so there's a\npolyamorous relationship painful for you\nwell not working out with other people\nyeah yeah so let me ask you again is the\npolyamorous relationship painful for you\nyes and and if we ask you why you do it\nyour answer is because you really love\nbeing loved by destiny and you want to\nyou want other people to experience that\nlove so I think we have another case of\nsomething actually being quite painful\nfor you and it sounds like it's been\npretty rough over the last year and\nyou're willing to do it to make other\npeople happy to give other people the\nopportunity to be loved by destiny what\ndo you think about that\nso I think the tricky thing for you\nMelina's I wonder how we you would feel\nif you started putting yourself first I\ndon't know I'm not sure if I've ever\ndone that yeah what do you think about\nthat\nit tells me that itself it huh something\nI don't know what's going on with this\nserver hold on one second let me see if\nI can do this no I can't\nI'm also yeah okay let's just let\ngoddamnit\nwe're right at the climax okay\nall right try again how does it use put\nyourself first something inside me tells\nme that it's self so now we get to push\nyourself because you said earlier that\nyou were pushing yourself and I think\nwhat you're pushing what you have to\npush against is the part of you that\nfeels like you're being selfish\nwhat do you think this is I saw what\nfeels unfair to you because other people\nare being selfish in your polyamorous\nrelationship and you are not\nand so it's like other people are coming\nand it's just like with the eggs like\nshe takes a bite of my eggs but I don't\nget a bite of hers mm-hmm right that\ndoesn't work so milena I'm gonna share\none anything any thoughts or questions\nno I think it's\nso can I share with you like a story and\nI guess we have maybe somewhat of a\nconclusion for you mm-hmm so I think\nyou're a wonderful person and I think\nit's wonderful that you put other people\nfirst but I think unless you get to be\nreally really good at what you do you're\ngonna get you're gonna continue getting\nhurt if you continue to be in the\nsituation and I'm not trying to say you\nshould or shouldn't do anything it's\njust I've worked with a fair number of\npeople who have been an open or\npolyamorous relationships and there's\nusually like a lot of hurt I don't know\nhow else to put it\ncan you hear me okay yeah okay so my mom\nonce told me that if you want to be\nhappy\nyep okay let me just think about where\nto start with this so in Hinduism there\nare two incarnations of with this\nparticular God named Vishnu one of the\nincarnations is this guy named ROM and\nROM was sort of like this idea of like\nthe ideal human being so he was just and\nhe was kind and he was Noble and he was\nhonest and he was giving and ROM story\nis that he this is gonna be great\nactually that's a great sir so what\nhappens is he decides that there's a\nprincess that he wants to marry and then\nthere's another king that wants to marry\nthat same princess the princess's name\nis see that so they actually have this\nkind of competition where the winner of\nthe competition gets to marry see that\nand so rom ends up winning the\ncompetition because see factually\ndoesn't let this other King this other\nguy's name is Robin she doesn't let him\ncompete so gonna have a contest in the\nwinner of the contest get Sita's hand in\nmarriage so Rob wins he ends up marrying\nSita and see that doesn't let this guy\nRobin she doesn't let him compete so\nRobin gets pissed because he's like\nthat's unfair I should be able to\ncompete too and so after Rama and Sita\nget married Robin actually kidnaps her\nand takes her to his Island where he\ntries to get her to fall in love with\nhim and then Rob essentially raises an\narmy and fights a war kills Robin and\nthen brings seatback\nwith me so far mm-hmm so once he comes\nback something funny happened so ROM is\na king at this point in Cephas a queen\nand his court really doesn't like Sita\nand Rama's like what's wrong what I\ndon't understand like why don't you guys\nlike her and they say well she was kind\nof like living in Robin's house for a\ncouple of years like you never really\nknow what happened maybe she was\nunfaithful to you and Rama Rama says\nwell she says she's not an unfaithful\nand and I don't I mean she says she was\nfaithful and I believed her\nso like I don't see why it's a problem\nfor you guys and despite Rob's best\nattempts to convince this court that\nshe's we should be everything should be\nfine now because I fought a battle and I\nwon and I killed the bad guy and I came\nhome with the Queen like everything's\ngood right this is how the story ends\nhis court is basically like now we just\ndon't trust her they're haters they're\nlike the internet and so rom decides\nthat he's going to put the needs of the\nkingdom ahead of his marriage and\ndecides that it's it's better for a\nkingdom to have a queen that they can\nlove and respect even that's more\nimportant than like whether she was\nfaithful or not so he ends up divorcing\nher what do you think about that\nI don't know okay so now let me tell you\nabout the other incarnation okay so a\nthousand years later the same God\nsupposedly incarnate as another person\nnamed Krishna and Krishna is different\nfrom Rama even though it's sort of\nsupposed to be the same God in two\ndifferent bodies Krishna\nyou know grows up and has a couple of\nwives and up to maybe a thousand\ngirlfriends so he maybe was it sounds\nlike he was in a polyamorous\nrelationship yeah and so part of the\nreason that he actually had a thousand\ngirlfriends or what some people say is\nthat like there were a fair number of\nwomen who were unsupported and so he\nended up marrying them maybe was a\nplayer unclear actually he was a player\nthe stories also kind of described as a\nplayer but he like supported a lot of\nwomen and had like lots of wives and he\nalso does like all kinds of like\nrelatively shady things\nso whereas ROM would never lie like\nKrishna would let me try to come up with\na quick story so in ancient India there\nwas a code of war but am I losing you by\nthe way I don't know I can't tell okay\nso is this code of war where you\nbasically are not allowed to fight after\nthe Sun Goes Down so like everyone wakes\nup in the morning once Dawn once the Sun\nis above the horizon you start fighting\nand then you fight all day and when the\nsun goes down you stop fighting no sneak\nattacks no nighttime attacks nothing\nlike that so it was like a code that\npeople adhere to so one day Krishna\nrealizes that there's going to be an\neclipse and so it's gonna look like the\nSun is gonna go down so he goes to his\nhis army basically he's an advisor he\ndoesn't actually fight himself and he\nsays by the way something funny is gonna\nhappen today the Sun is gonna go down or\nit's gonna look like it gets dark and\nthen you guys are gonna everyone's gonna\nwant to stop fighting and I want you\nguys to stop fighting for like ten\nminutes\nand when the other army puts their\nweapons away I want you to pull out your\nweapons and then basically slaughter\nthem while they're defenseless and then\nhis troops are like but wait so you want\nus to violate the code of war and he's\nlike no no no trust me you're not\nviolating the code of war but just do\nwhat I say and so sure enough the\nEclipse happens the Sun appears to go\ndown\nor it gets dark like the Sun is going\ndown so everyone stops fighting\neveryone's kind of confused because it\nhappened a couple of hours early but\nmaybe they lost track of time and\nkrishna's side waits for everyone to put\ntheir weapons away and then he gives the\norder and then his troops basically\nslaughter like thousands or tens of\nthousands of unarmed people and they win\nthe day and then krishna says by the way\ntechnically we didn't make a mistake\nlike technically we did exactly what we\nwere supposed to do so good job can you\nsee how rama and krishna are different\nlike if I sort of made it clear that\nthey're kind of like different people I\nthink you have to explain a little bit\nso like Rob is a super noble guy like\nRob would never do that\nhe's a good guy he cares about other\npeople krishna doesn't give a [ __ ] about\nother people\nhe'll adhere to the code of what he's\ntechnically supposed to do but he puts\nhimself first\nright rom puts other people first and\nit's not that krishna puts himself first\nat the expense of other people he's not\na bad person\nbut he doesn't like adhere to a code\nhe's sort of have you heard this phrase\nthe ends justifies the means no so\nthat's a phrase that means like you know\nif you have to steal to feed your family\nthat's okay like the end goal is the\nimportant thing even if you have to do\nsomething bad in the middle like it's\nokay to do something it's okay to do bad\nthings for good reasons does that make\nsense so Rob is someone who would say\nit's not okay to do bad things for good\nreasons and Krishna is someone that it's\nokay to do bad things if you're doing it\nfor the right reasons what do you think\ndo you think it's okay to do bad things\nfor good reasons another guy would do it\nI completely agree yeah so I think\nyou're more like ROM than you are like\nKrishna yeah so there are two things\nthat I leave you with my mom once told\nme something very very wise when I was\nfifteen she says if you want to live a\ngood life live like ROM and if you want\nto live a happy life live like Krishna\nso I put the same thing to you milena\nthat you\nI don't really know but sometimes I\npretend to be a wise person when I\nscream on Twitch so what I would tell\nyou is that I think the person that you\nare who's incredibly giving and you put\nother people ahead of yourself\nthe world is filled with a lot of people\nwho will take advantage of you and I'm\nit's sad that you had to learn that\nlesson but I also think that the world\nis filled with lots of good people too\nin fact I believe that it's not good\npeople are bad people that everyone has\na good side and everyone has a bad side\nthat's what I believe so I believe that\nwe all have ROM within us and we all\nhave Krishna within us and I think\nyou're in for a lot of suffering if you\ndon't if you continue to sort of\nmindlessly put other people first so I\nput other people first too but I'm just\nreally mindful about the way that I do\nit like I think you know some people\nthink I'm a good person I think I'm kind\nof like a good person kind of but I also\nset limits like I'm not going to\nsacrifice some things about my health\nand well-being for the sake of helping\nother people and I think going forward I\nwould really encourage you to think a\nlittle bit about whether you can be a\nlittle bit more selfish and what that\nwould feel like because I think you're\nlearning I'm right yeah go ahead sorry I\ndon't know how I can do that yeah I\ndon't know how you can do it either I'm\nnot even sure that you should do it\nwhat I think you should do though is I\nthink you have this reflexive part of\nyou that probably started when you were\na child where you started putting other\npeople ahead of you and I think that\nthat's actually not healthy for people\nit's not even healthy for the people\nthat you do that for and I don't know\nmaybe I can explain this real quick so\nyou know if you have a relationship\nwhere one person does all of the work\nand one person does all the relaxation\nthat's not healthy for either person\ndoes that make sense yeah and so I\nwonder if like all of these\nrelationships that you engage in you're\nsharing your food and they're not\nsharing theirs I don't know if that's\nactually good for them it's like it's it\nfeels like it's every\nI don't know if is like it's a lot of\npeople yeah so I think you've got to\nmake a decision about whether you want\nto continue being taken advantage of\nbecause it sounds like that's what's\nhappening would you say that that's fair\nno no how would you describe it you\ndon't think you're getting taken\nadvantage of yeah yeah you think so okay\nyeah yeah so I think you've got to think\na lot about whether you want to let\nyourself do that and I think if if you\ndon't want to be taken advantage of I\nthink part of what that means is being a\nlittle bit more selfish and I don't\nthink being selfish is a bad thing\nthat's the whole point of all of this\nstuff is I think you've got to think\nabout it you know when you let someone\ninto your life because you want them to\nbe loved by destiny are you willing to\nhave them shut the door in your face no\nokay\nisn't that being selfish though aren't\nyou depriving them of destiny's love I\ndon't think it's okay to me good I don't\nthink it is either\nand I don't think being selfish is a bad\nperson especially someone with you\nbecause the last thing that I'll share\nwith you is this is what I see with\npeople who have Shakthi is that they get\ndrained dry by the hungry people that\neveryone wants a piece of you and you're\nso loving and you're so kind that\nthey're just gonna suck you dry and you\nhave to learn you have to learn how to\nlike when to give and when not to give\nand that should be under your control\ninstead of it being like completely\nrandom and under their control because\notherwise I think you're in for years\nand years and years of suffering and\npain what like your situation is could\nit be what situations could what like\nyears of suffering pain like I know like\nmore what situation could it be where I\nhave to like think more selfish I mean\npersonally I would start with the two\nthings I would think about would be\nstreaming in your relationship so I'd\nthink about everything that you do\na transaction you're giving something\nand you're getting something because\nthat's what it is right if you don't if\nif streaming opens you up to drama\nyou're what you're helping a bunch of\npeople but you're also opening yourself\nup to drama so like which one do you\nwant to do like is it worth it or is it\nnot worth it that's one example I think\nthe other thing which I think you guys\nare it sounds like y'all are already\nexploring is like being a little bit\ncareful about who you let into your open\nrelationship yeah and the last thing\nthis is gonna be the hardest one is if\nyou feel hurt by something can you ask\npeople to make a sacrifice so that you\nfeel less hurt I guess I can ask do you\nfeel comfortable asking yeah so let's\nsay that there was someone that you felt\nlike was toxic for your relationship\nwould you feel comfortable asking that\ndestiny to like remove them from your\nlife or see less of them or anything\nlike that or would you feel like that's\ncontrolling I don't think he would be\nvery happy with it\nokay so beautiful so notice I asked you\na question and what was your answer he\nwouldn't be happy with it which is not\nselfish exactly that's that's exactly\nwhat I'm saying that's what you need to\nthink about right so then you know I\nmean if you guys are married in my mind\nthat means that y'all are special and\nthere are other people that are less\nspecial than you are in the relationship\nthat could be a problem on my end right\nthat you guys love each other yeah so I\nin in my mind that sort of means that\nlike so you the way that you're putting\nhim first I think he should put you\nfirst right that's the only way it works\nit's like you're saying like he wouldn't\nbe very happy with it and and that's so\nthe question is like are you okay with\nthat\nis he okay with that are you guys in a\nrelationship where it's okay for him to\nbe happy because and because think about\nthe opposite like if you don't talk to\nhim about that you're unhappy\nright if there's someone toxic in\ny'all's relationship you're unhappy and\nhe's happy he's fine with it\nand if you talk to him maybe he becomes\nunhappy and then do you become happy or\ndoes it end up somewhere in the middle I\nwould feel so bad yeah and I think it\nwould be happy about him not being happy\nyeah so I in my mind it's not asking him\nto necessarily do something I think the\nhealthiest thing to do is have a\nconversation about it\nmm-hmm right and and to me it seems very\nclear that you put him ahead of you yeah\nI would say so I feel like I give up a\nlot of things yeah I think he does that\ntoo sure and that's how a marriage works\nyeah right so even an open one so I\nthink about marriage is giving 60 and\ntaking 40 you give 60 and he takes 40\nand he gives 60 and you take 40 that's\nthe only way it works so but I mean I\nhopefully you caught that right like the\nyour first thought is not about you it's\nabout other people\nit doesn't make you anything that makes\nyou a good person for by all means and\nI'm not saying that you should become a\nselfish [ __ ] I'm not saying that you\nshould try to control destiny I'm saying\nthat if something hurts you and you're\nin a relationship I would advise you to\ntalk to your partner or fiancee about\nwhat's painful to you because you're not\nremember once again it's not about like\nyou controlling him and making giving\nmaking him give something up in my mind\nit's about you sharing your feelings\nwith them and then hopefully he'll\nchoose what you would choose like if he\ncame to you and he said hey you're in\nthis relationship with this person it's\nvery hurtful to me what would you do I\nwould probably try to talk about it and\nlike see if there's any if there's\nanything we could do or if there's any\nmisunderstandings or perfect yeah so I\nthink that's what we're talking about\nright but I would be careful because\nthen I would imagine just based on your\nthoughts that you wouldn't even bring it\nup for with him because you're afraid\nthat he wouldn't like it\n[Music]\nI think I'm better at doing that now\ngood and I think you better I think yeah\nyeah you think what I think if maybe it\nwas worse before maybe yep I can imagine\nI think you're I'm sure you're better\nnow Molina I think you still have a\nlittle ways to go\nmm-hmm why do you think that because I\nthink it's hard to undo a life an\nupbringing and a life of putting other\npeople first I think it's hard to be\nless selfish I mean more software sorry\nbecause you've you've been a giver your\nentire life and it can feel very very\nbad to not be a giver yeah but I'm I'm\nhappy for you I'm hopeful for you and\nI'm rooting for you\nI'm rooting for destiny I'm a big fan of\nboth you all at this point so I hope you\nguys finally working huh why is that why\nyou're a big fan of you were four ugh\ndestiny both or anything I'm a big fan\nof destiny because I just have a lot of\nrespect for him like I think he's uh I\nthink he's one of the very few people\nwho practices what he preaches so I\nthink that he doesn't take things at\nface value in the conclusions that he\ncomes to are really like thought-out and\nhe's very open-minded so I respect him\nfor that I just personally I like him\nlike I enjoy watching his stream like I\nfind him to be entertaining why am i fan\nfor you because I think that you are a\ngood person\nI'm not so sure he is but I think he\nchooses to be good and I think he\nchooses to be good yeah which I respect\nmore than someone who has to be good\nwhich is you so I think you're not\nactually in control of your goodness\nwhich i think is actually a problem but\nI think that you're a wonderful person\nand I think that the world needs more\npeople like you and the world would be a\nbetter place if there were more people\nlike you but unfortunately the world\nisn't filled with people like you\nso I think you're in for a lot of hurt\ndoesn't mean that you can't live\nfulfilling life I think it'll just be\nyou're gonna have to make a lot of\nsacrifices if you continue living the\nway that you used to and I think it's\ngonna be hard because you know you the\nfirst thought that you have is about\nother people yeah and that's that's a\npainful way to live it's not my place to\nsay that you should do this or should\nshouldn't do that I mean that's for you\nto decide all I really want you to do is\nnotice when you think about other people\ninstead of yourself and especially if\nthere's one person in the world that you\nshould be able to have and this is my\nvalue so this is my bias there's one\nperson in the world that you should be\nable to have a conversation about your\nfeelings about even if it negatively\nimpacts them it's your fiance or husband\nyeah right that's the one person that\nyou should not feel alone from whereas I\nfeel I can probably feel a lot like you\nprobably would hold a lot of stuff\nbecause of the way that he you're\nconcerned about his reactions does that\nmake sense any other thoughts or\nquestions I think I think it's good I'm\nreally happy that I got to talk to you\nme too I I'm afraid that I wasn't very\nhelpful to you but I really I don't know\nI don't know if what I said I felt like\nI wasn't very clear today no see it's um\nsometimes this is a little bit hard for\nme to follow I think especially with\nlike language stuff yeah but it's okay\nlike I feel loved everything yeah so\nyeah thank you and you know if you have\nany other questions or you want to\nfollow up at some point I'd be more than\nhappy to\nand I really moline I wish you all the\nbest like I know covent sucks\nand all that stuff but I really hope\nthat you know things do work out between\nthe two of y'all I'm sure they will it\nsounds like both of you guys care a lot\nabout each other I think so yeah yeah\nyeah and yeah I'm really happy that you\nhave someone in your life like that and\nI'm really happy for destiny that he has\nsomeone is life like you thank you take\ncare okay thank you so much bye\nalrighty [ __ ] I didn't meditate let me\nactually message her real quick secret\ndo you want to meditate I can teach you\nsomething\n[Music]\nokay we're about to taining hold on\n[Music]\nwhat about the meditation yeah do you\nwant it so I teach people meditation\nsometimes on stream or you introduce\neight it comes in periods okay they do\nthat do you would you like to do some\nattitude is there some kind of\nmeditation that you like to do I don't\nthink it there's like any specific ones\nthat I do it's just more like I don't\nknow I think it they're like a little\nbit in my own way can I try to teach you\nsomething yeah okay so this is I'm gonna\ntry to figure this out myself as we're\ndoing it okay so I apologize for that so\nI want the people who are watching it\nlike it follow along but I'm just gonna\ntry something if it doesn't work well\nI'll teach you some very focused\nbreathing or something like that so I\nwant you to close your eyes I'm gonna\nask you to explore some stuff within you\nokay great see already the breath\nchanges so you're already doing it this\nis fantastic so I want you to just\nnotice what are you doing how are you\nwhat's changed when I focus on it yeah\nlike like do you feel different um yeah\nhow do you feel what's different we've\nbeen talking for almost like an hour and\na half right so how do you feel\ndifferent now like like all of the\nthings that I usually think about when I\nwhen I think you know you're gone yes\nbeautiful right so you guys can see it\nlike especially we can see your your\nclavicle like a collarbone the the the\nright side of your neck so because of\nthe shirt that you're wearing you can\nactually see the way that you're taking\na breath really very easily so that's\nvery helpful actually so I'm gonna ask\nyou to look for the part of you that\nwants to make the world a better place\nlook for that part inside you the part\nof you that wants other people to be\nhappy can you find it\nokay yeah what does that feel like I\nthink that's where I usually feel stuff\nmost from where it's either like a\npressure or I feel I don't know this is\nwhere I feel anxious or this where I\nfeel like really like if I feel a lot of\nlove I feel it from there as well yeah\nso then I want you to just think about\nthis when you feel a lot of love for\npeople is that just a positive feeling\nin your chest or is there also a\nnegative feeling that comes with it\nthere's a negative so let's just pause\nand think about that for a second\nright that's kind of strange because\ngenerally speaking when like what I\nthink about you know when I'm loving one\nof my kids I don't have a negative\nfeeling that comes with that does that\nmake sense but I do imagine that when\nyou feel some amount of love sometimes\nyou feel something negative with it what\ndo you just can use can you help us\nunderstand a little bit and this may be\nhard can you help us understand like\nwhat the positive feels like and what\nthe negative feels like but they're\nalmost like two sides of a coin the\npositive is like that I want people to\nbe happy and I think that's good you\nmight want that and that makes me happy\nyeah but I also feel like I'm not in the\npicture yep what does that feel like in\nyour body what is not being in the\npicture feel like in your body very\nsmall yes and like that's worth it sort\nof yeah right so I want you to just\nfocus on those two sensations I want you\nto find the love in the positivity that\nyou feel towards other people and then I\nwant you to at the same time notice that\nfeeling of not being\nin the picture\nman that's such a good summary for our\nentire conversation and because milena I\nthink that's beautifully put because I\nthink when you put other people first\nyou remove yourself in the picture from\nthe picture and I think the whole thing\nis that for you to truly be peaceful I\nthink you have to be a part of that\npicture that's what you did with your\nmom right you set your own feelings\naside you let the whole picture the\nwhole picture is dominated by her and\nnotice whenever you I want you to think\nback to like when she was struggling and\nyou were able to help her how good you\nfelt about yourself how good you felt\nabout her and then also try to catch\nthat little part of your sacrifice what\nyou gave up in order to do that you gave\nsomething up from you and find that\nlittle thing can you find it where is it\nhmm it's like in the back I don't know\nlike it's like I don't know\nit's kind it's hard to describe it it\nfeels like it like pulls me back a\nlittle bit yeah it does pull you back\nright because it helps it keeps you from\nbeing this perfect person it's perfect\ngiver and how do you feel about that\npart of you\nsomething I realize that I do whenever I\nlook at a picture and myself as a kid I\nget really sad yeah\nand that's like the same feeling I get\nwhen they think about this yeah\ndoes your childhood was very sad\nit's gonna want you to sit with that\nfeeling and I think what you've got to\nstop doing is trying to push it away so\nI want you to understand this milena\nthat you have a six year old or seven\nyear old inside you that wants to make\nthe world a better place for everyone\nelse but no one takes care of her right\noh that wouldn't make destiny very happy\nthere she is again\nalways looking to help others but she\nneeds someone to take care of her too\nthat person has to be you so right now\nthese two feelings of caring for others\nand neglecting yourself for removing\nyourself from the picture from feeling\nlike you're not in the picture that's\ngot to change\nand I want you to sit with these two\nfeelings and just let them be and see if\nthere's some way that you can let both\nof them coexist so take a deep breath in\nand notice that the front of your chest\nand your back both change they expand\nthey move away from each other and then\nas you breathe out they come together\nbreathe in they move away and breathe\nout they come together breathe in\nand breathe out and I'll let them\nnaturally come together let them sit\nwith each other let them mingle together\nnow Melina I don't know exactly how to\ndo this but I just asked you to try I\nwant you to take that part of you that\nputs that loves other people\nunconditionally the part of you that's\ncapable of love and I want you to turn\nit towards yourself because all of your\nlove always is going out is going out is\ngoing out and then inside is a six or\nseven year old girl who gets neglected\nshe's the one who's giving giving giving\nand give that to yourself send it from\nyou to you\nand now for the last phase I want you to\njust try to notice your whole body we've\ntalked about things we've felt things\ntheir feelings their thoughts emotions\nphysical sensations just notice all of\nthose things and take a moment to\nrealize that you are actually none of\nthat that's all in your body it's all in\nyour mind\nbut that there is a part of you that is\nunderneath or above all of that and can\nsee all of these things happening and\nthat that place is a little bit\nseparated it's a little bit peaceful\nand now you can kind of take a little\nbit of a time out from everything that\nwe've done and just sit with that part\nand just watch your body let it do\nwhatever it wants now whether it be\nbreathing a certain way feeling a\ncertain way no problem good and when\nyou're ready let yourself come back\nto Sweden to Cove it'd to uncertainty\nstreaming toxicity longing for a van in\nNew Zealand that is your life and it's\nokay because you're you and you have\nthat peaceful part of you you have that\nloving part of you that you have the\nfoundation of your relationship with\ndestiny and you guys have been through a\nlot\ndoing okay mm-hmm\nit's very nice good I'm glad you enjoyed\nit I don't really know how you can do\nthat every day but do it just because I\ntried to teach people meditation like a\npractice they can do every day I'm not\nquite sure but what I would say to you\nis I want you to notice that those two\nsides of the coin whenever you find\nyourself like struggling to make a\ndecision should I talk should I not talk\nshould I say this or I feel hurt try to\nfind both of those parts of yourself and\ntry to bring them together and I think\nthat'll help you it's interesting I\nnever heard someone tell me this tell\nyou what that I seem to put myself away\nfrom link because of other people did I\nwant to make them happy\nyep oh yeah it I don't think people\nnotice it no they take it for granted\nyeah that's what's unfair about it so I\nfeel very surprised which was kind of\nwhat I really like it really happy that\nbut you know you sort of told me that\nyeah so I'll leave you with one last\nthing I want you to do a google image\nsearch of durga durga is d you are GA\nall of the MU in a second and just take\na look at it and let me know what you\nsee you know if it resonates with you at\nall what you think that person\nrepresents and then yeah we can I'm just\ncurious\nbut because I I think that that's you\nwhen I see you I see the guy inside you\nand so let's see what your reaction it's\nmay be yeah but anyway thank you so much\nfor coming on Melina I really am rooting\nfor you and I hope everything works out\nand stay safe and stuff thank you so\nmuch and if there's some way we can\nsupport you just let us know\nmm-hmm take care of thank you okay\nso let's do this real quick\nso let's just do this let me show you\nguys\n[Music]\nso this is God can we do a full image\nsearch on the dog I guess what I can\nshow you guys this\nso this is durga if you guys are\nwondering but i think she kind of really\nembodies that absolutely so this guy\nwho's saying there were guys like do i\nhave to do everything around here\nabsolutely we'll go back to that real\nquick let me show you guys this right so\nyeah man like don't you guys like don't\nyou guys realize that's what Molina's\ndoing she's doing like 15 things she's\nlike taking care of her and everybody\nlike when when when people were trying\nto symbolize people like Molina they\nrecognize that there are some you know\nwomen especially who were very badass\nand took care of everything around them\nand they realized that like two hands is\ninsufficient to capture the essence of\nwho Molina is taking care of right so\nhere's so this is a good one see what\nthis is right so she's also like\nstabbing people with Spears and [ __ ]\nswipe it's quite a game of thrones kinda\nit's like a fantasy RPG mythology\nand Tiger symbolizes our friendship the\ntiger King oh yeah man oh man that's too\nfunny okay let's see if we can do let's\ndo questions so we do questions here we\ngo okay\ngot a question hello hey hey okay so if\nyou're very empathic how should you live\nleave relationship in reference to like\nthe difficulty of feeling the pain they\nfeel and like did you say how should you\nleave a relationship yeah because we\nwere like milena can can do it milena\ncan like be in that relationship and she\ncan hold on and stuff but some people\ncan't handle relationships like when\nthey were very empathic yeah so it's\nlike the pain that you feel when you\nhurt someone uh-huh is kind of like it\ndoesn't help when you want to break up\nwith them ah excellent question okay so\nthere are two kind of answers the first\nis that if you are an empathic person\nthere is a general way that you should\nlearn how to manage your emotions and\nthen the breaking up is like a\nparticular instance of that so there's\nlike a general principle and this is a\npractical application does that make\nsense yeah okay so first of all the\ngeneral principle is that you have to\nthink about yourself like a sponge so\nthe thing about a sponges you absorb\nthings from other people and the goal of\na sponge is not necessarily to stop\nabsorbing it's to be able to wring the\nsponge out so if you want to break up\nwith someone what you really need to do\nis have a place where you can wring\nthose emotions out because if you try to\nif the emotions are too much for you to\nbear then you won't be able to break up\nwith them right that's the basic problem\nyeah yeah I mean by place huh what do\nyou mean by a place to wring them out\nyeah great question so that can be\nanything from Fran\nor other kinds of emotional support to\nlike physical practices like meditation\nor yoga to seeing a therapist you just\nneed some way to let the emotion inside\nyou out because what's gonna happen is\nas you fill up with their hurt your\ndesire to comfort them is gonna take\nover because they're hurting and it's\ngonna not let you break up with them\nyeah that's what happens exactly so what\nyou need to do is take that hurt on and\ninstead of responding to it on your own\nyou need to like wring it out with\nsomeone else\nso that can be like talking to a friend\nand just sort of talking to them about\nlike hey like I'm really afraid that I'm\nhurting this person and I really want to\nhelp them and and I don't want to break\nup with them but like I feel like I have\nto but I don't want to hurt them you\nneed some place to process those\nemotions outside of giving in to the\nrelationship okay yeah so so that can be\nI mean as bizarre as it sounds it like\nthat doesn't have to just be one thing\nso I think a little bit about like you\nknow strengthening yourself in terms of\nlike do you do yoga\nyeah yoga helped a lot absolutely right\nso you say helped like it's in the past\ntense so I when I started the the\nwebinar it really like helped a lot then\nnow it's just like helping good yeah so\nso I would say like if you can like try\nto even go to a yoga class because I\nthink doing an hour of yoga three times\na week\noh you can't go to yoga class that's\ngoing never mind that doesn't help yeah\nbut I would say that you know doing a\nformal yoga practice can help a lot and\nthen think a little bit about a couple\nof I mean do you have social supports\nyou can lean on I have I have family I\nguess I have people I can talk to but my\nmy issue then becomes like okay but then\nI actually like I can leave my emotions\nlet's say with them and I can talk to\nthem about the hurt that I may feel but\nyou know the hurts still gonna\nthere it's just gonna be like less\nabsolutely and that's the beautiful part\nso that I think the next thing is is to\nrecognize that this is gonna be painful\nright and you have to develop and this\nis why I like yoga and meditation is\nimportant that you have to develop the\ncapacity within yourself to tolerate\nsome of that pain until you bring the\nsponge out wring the sponge out so\nyou're gonna absorb a bunch of water\nyou're gonna have to hold it in your\nsponge for a while and then you're gonna\nwring it out over there and then you're\ngonna come back and you're gonna mop up\nmore and then you're gonna go over there\nand you're gonna wring it out and you're\ngonna come back and you're gonna mop up\nmore and as you start to understand this\nabout yourself it'll actually become\neasier because the problem is that when\nyou're a sponge and you don't have a\nplace to wring out you look at this\npuddle of water and you're like I can't\ntake care of all this water so the\nprocess of breaking up with this person\nis gonna hurt them so much it's too much\nheart for them to handle it's too much\nhurt for you to handle so you don't\nactually break up with them right yeah\nso what you've got to do is recognize\nthat like you can manage that amount of\nwater if you can wring yourself out a\ncouple of times and while you're\ncarrying that sponge from the puddle to\nwhere you're gonna wring it out in the\nbucket or the sink it's gonna be painful\nbut the last thing that I would do is\nconsider telling your social supports\nthat hey I'm gonna try to break up with\nso-and-so and I'm gonna need to lean on\nyou for a couple of weeks can we set\naside some time to like talk like every\nother day or something like that and set\nup like a formal structure to it and\nthen go through the process a structure\nso like a schedule with like the friend\nor whatever yeah so like you decide how\nformal it is but just first of all\nsignal to them that you want to do this\nand see if you can get them to like\nunderstand that you are expecting\nsomething from them over a couple of\nweeks okay right like you don't want to\nlike start day 8 and they're like they\nstop taking your calls because they\ndon't have the emotional bandwidth and\nthen you're kind of [ __ ] because\nyou're halfway through the process and\nthen some ways taking your bucket away\nokay okay okay yeah I'm good with that\nokay awesome okay good luck fantastic\nquestion\n[Music]\ntake care\nready hi hey how you doing - good\nalright so my question is how do you\ntransition to being more selfish instead\nof instead of putting putting people you\nlove and care like first without\nneglecting them afterward well let me\nthink about that so first of all there\nare a couple of different things in that\nquestion so how do you get to be more\nselfish without neglecting them so you\nhave to so this see that question is the\nproblem because you think that putting\nyourself first is neglecting them do you\nsee that like you're tying neglecting\nthem with being selfish together that in\nand of itself is the problem because\njust because you're being selfish\ndoesn't mean that you're gonna be\nneglecting them right if we think about\nsupporting another human being there's a\nspectrum there's like 100 percent\nsupporting them and 0% of supporting\nthem let's say like less than 10 percent\nsupport is neglectful but like there's a\nbig middle range there where you can\nstart to take care of yourself and\nprioritize yourself without being\nneglectful does that make sense sure I\nfollow\nright so why do you think that being\nselfish is gonna neglect other people\nwell it's a that sense that like people\nrely on you you know it is like mental\nsupport or like any kind of support or\nlike just being out there and like if\nit's people you know for a long time now\nyou like have a change to be more about\nyourself and like less like you more\nfocus on the own circle\nbecause that makes yeah so I think you\ncan do that right so like you start to\nfocus on yourself and then you recognize\nI think it's useful to have\nconversations with people so like if you\nthink about who are the people that are\nrelying on you right now just start by\nlike picking two or three of them and\nthen like having conversations with them\nand say like hey I'm going through some\nstuff right now I really want to be able\nto support you but I may not be quite as\navailable as I used to be could you have\na conversation like that sure but I\nthink like you get that like go through\nlike some sort of like realization what\ndo you want to achieve before you do\nthat but that's just me well there is\nyour problem so I don't think you know\nyou don't have to go through any\nrealization of what you need to achieve\nbefore you start setting boundaries with\npeople who are emotionally dependent on\nyou you don't need to do that like I\nunderstand that you're feeling you need\nto do that but like do you see how\nthat's the part like how much you\nsupport less so I think dude I think the\nproblem is that you spend so much of\nyour time supporting other people that\nyou never give yourself the time or\nspace to figure out what you want to\nachieve you've got it backwards\nwhat do you think about that yeah like\nthe whole meditation thing really like\nresonated what you did with their Molina\nso yeah I can't agree with that yeah so\nthe first yeah go ahead sorry I'm done\nyeah yeah I mean so the first thing is\nthat you got it like like set aside some\ntime for yourself\neven if you don't even if it's a waste\nof time right because you probably feel\nguilty if you're like okay why am I not\nemotionally supporting this person if I\nam like not working towards anything do\nyou have those kinds of thoughts oh yeah\nsure yeah\nso you got to let yourself think that\nbecause you you know what you're working\ntowards is figuring out what you're\nworking towards and you can't do that if\nyou're consumed by helping other people\nright like here's the problem you play\nRPGs sure okay so like the problem here\nis that you help you spend all of your\nmana\nlike healing other people and then when\nit comes to like self development your\nown right so it starts by like reserving\nsome of your mana pool for yourself and\nthen letting people know that like hey I\ncan't answer my phone every time you\ncall I'm working on a couple of things\nand all I call you back it like within\nan hour - or shoot me a text if you need\nto talk like right now right now I'm I\nguess I never thought about those things\ncuz when you like so far deep in you you\nknow you don't like really raise the\nquestion absolutely you are a hundred\npercent correct the deeper in you are\nthe harder it is to see right so this is\nwhere you got us take a step back and\ntry to set some set some boundaries\nwhich are gonna feel awkward but have a\nconversation about it and be like hey I\nwant to continue to support you but I'm\nworking on a couple of things is it okay\nif we like like I'm a big fan of\nscheduling because scheduling lets\npeople know that they're a priority like\nwhen I come to someone and I say that I\nam taking time out of my day to be\navailable for you it's hard for people\nto feel like you don't care about them\nand more importantly it's hard for you\nto feel like you don't care about them\ngot it yep okay other questions no\nthat's it okay good luck man\nthank you thank you all right let's do\none more\nHey\n[Music]\nthe person's mic isn't working so I'm\njust gonna ask it for sure\n[Music]\nessentially is like being a sponge and\nego are they tied together because both\nwant to make like other people happy ego\ndoesn't want to make other people happy\nso they can be tied together but let's\nlet's start by understanding this ego\ndoesn't want to make other half people\nhappy ego wants to make yourself feel\nbetter so if we look at Malina\nI think Molina's ego is actually quite\nactive so she doesn't come across as\negotistical but I think her ego is quite\nstrong and we see her ego because she\ndoesn't view herself as a selfish person\nright so like her ego is about being\nthis like sulphate selfless loving\ncaring want to make the world a better\nplace and it's not that she's that's\nfalse it's just the ego kind of takes\none part A one real part of us and then\nlike uses that to like shut down\neverything else so if we think about you\nknow let's say like a league of Legends\nor dota player who feels really really\nlike they're good at those games and so\ntheir identity revolves around that like\npeople who are doctors have their\nidentity revolve around the doctor so\nour ego tends to build on the things\nabout us that are true and positive and\nin doing so it like shoves away a lot of\nnegative and darker stuff that then\nbecomes hard to work on so the sponge\nand the ego can become related because\nyou can start to develop an ego around\nbeing a sponge oh look at how helpful I\nam look at how wonderful I am look at\nhow much I want the world to be a good\nplace all of these other people are\nselfish but I am selfless I'm a good\nperson\nand I want everyone to be happy and I'm\nwilling to sacrifice myself to other\npeople and then when you try to tell\nthat person oh maybe you should try\nbeing a\nlittle bit more selfish their ego rebels\nagainst that because if they derive\ntheir value from being a selfless person\nand you threaten to take that away then\nwho are they they're no one does that\nmake sense yeah you said they answered\nthe question and he also says that he\nloves you okay well I love him too but\nnot in a polyamorous open relationship\nkind of way all right thanks a lot no\nproblem okay"
