    "transcript": "if you weren't paying attention to your\ndad what are the chances that you get\nbeat if I wasn't paying attention to my\nfather yeah I always I was always paying\nattention to my father that's the first\nthing I did I step in the door good so\nmy point is that you are always paying\nattention and why is that because even\nbefore you remember there were times\nthat you weren't paying attention and\nwhen you weren't paying attention you\ndidn't see the look because you were\nplaying with your Legos and then you got\nbeat so you learned from a very very\nearly age you always have to pay\nattention because that is survival\nmechanism think about it like\nevolutionarily like in one scenario you\nget beat and in one scenario you don't\nget beat so your six-year-old brain\nlearns I have to pay attention and now\nwhat's happening is you haven't learned\nto stop paying attention or you haven't\nrealized that you're still paying\nattention\nwell let's see if we can help you out\nwith that what what are you nervous\nabout let's start there talking about\nwhat what are we talking about uh\nPTSD and trauma I'm just this is\nsomething that like I keep well I kept\nbottled up for a long time so just\nletting it out it's nerve-wracking but\nit's something I feel like I need to do\nwhy have you kept it bottled ah I'm\nscared scared of like cuz it if you keep\nit bottled up it's like it's your burden\nto bear I guess I've been vocal about\nthis on my stream a couple of times and\nstuff and every time I let it out I just\nget so emotional and I get so like and I\ndon't really like as a streamer like you\nwant to entertain your chat you don't\nwant to like burden them with your\ntroubles you know but I can't do my job\nand entertain if I'm feeling the way I\nfeel does that make sense sure I'm not\nso sure that I agree with this idea of\nentertainment so I think part of the\nreason that twitch is such a powerful\nplatform is because it's not just one in\ngames right it's fun and games most of\nthe time but there's enough of reality\nin there which is why I think it's like\nlike I think there are other platforms\nout there that are a little bit more\nsoulless like it's not about like\nthere's no human connection there's no\ninteraction and part of what I think\nmakes twitch actually amazing is that\nit's it's the stuff that I'm guessing\nthat you perceive is unentertaining like\nburdening twitch chat is actually part\nof what makes them form a connection\nwith you and it's not entertainment but\nit's like you know like their movies\nthat are really good that are not fun\nright yeah and what makes them good it's\nbecause like there's something about\nlife and reality and like it's a blend\nof like fun stuff that we do and also\n[ __ ] that's\nso I don't mean but I'm with you like I\nknow that you know I'm sure you feel\nburdened to like entertain people\nbecause that's why they watch right\nwow that's gigantic bottle of water yeah\nit's I I'm too lazy to have a cup to go\ndownstairs to refill it so I just have\nthis and it keeps a cold it's like a\nthermal water thing so there's like ice\ncubes in there how much water does that\nstore I have I have it's a lot I drink\nthis whole I try to drink this whole\nthing once a day to keep hydrated nice\nwell let me see yours\nbut like don't you get tired of like\nhaving that glass and just refilling it\nwith water all the time yeah I do and it\ngets like warm it gets like hoop warm\nlike room temperature you know I mean\nthis is this is some temperature [ __ ] I\nhave here yeah so I mean I get that\nyou're nervous so like is there you say\nthat you you do let this out on stream\nfrom time to time yeah because I feel\nlike if I can let people in on the\nthings I've gone in my life it can help\npeople go through or it can help people\ngo through what they're what's going on\nin their lives because everyone has some\nsort of trauma everyone has some sort of\nlike so they everyone has demons in the\nskeletons in the closet so if I can\nshare my story and share my skeletons in\nthe closet maybe it can help somebody\nelse absolutely man that's an Elsa it\nalso helps me to get through it because\nI I've never been vocal about what\nhappened in my childhood to anybody\nother than my girlfriend and my stream\nokay I've never told anyone\nexcept for my girlfriend and thousands\nof people on the Internet I haven't told\nlike my closest friends I haven't told\nlike family I mean so twitch chat was\njust trolling me about like I was like\nyeah twitch chat I'm gonna trust you\nguys and they're like law what like\nyou're trusting us and I'm like\nI'm trusting you because you were\ntrustworthy it's kind of a mind-boggling\nthey don't understand that yeah but yeah\nyeah my torch dad knows more about me\nthan my family than my friends that my\nfamily than anyone\nstrong worked twitch at talk about being\ngood listeners so okay can I and you\nknow if I ask a question that is too\nfast or you don't want to answer but I\nfind myself being curious when you say\nlike stuff that happened to you that you\nknow your friends don't know I find\nmyself being curious like what what\nhappened to you man\nso me and my family we grew up in a we\ngrew up in poverty we're really really\npoor and I don't really know if it was\nthe poverty that drove my dad to the way\nbecame or if it was just he was he was\ngonna become that way either way I think\nbeing poured definitely made it worse\nbut he she was an alcoholic a raging\nalcoholic he was she was abusive\nemotionally and physically towards me\nand my mother\nyeah that's he\n[Music]\nhe beat me and my mom\nand emotionally he you know he'd say a\nlot of things\nit-it-it berry from day to day and yeah\nhow do i I mean do you want a story\nthere's like feel like telling one I was\njust kind of listening there for a\nsecond I to be completely honest and\nwhat am i calling my calling you coconut\nB you can just call me Coco Coco so Coco\nI mean just what you shared actually\nsort of like knocked me over emotionally\nto be honest I didn't I just didn't have\nwords in my head for a little bit yeah\npeople say that so I was just kind of\nprocessing you know it's kind of\ninteresting because you didn't really\nuse a whole lot of like language but\njust something about the way that you\nsaid it I think carried a certain weight\nto it mmm you know cuz you kind of said\nhe was a raging alcoholic and he was\nphysically and emotionally abusive and\nthat sentence isn't I mean it's a bad\nsentence but it's not like I felt\nsomething from you and like what do what\ndid you what did you feel that's what I\nwas trying to figure out\nI think I think what I felt was a weight\nlike it's you know like you can say you\ngot punched and you can say you got\nslugged mm-hmm like what's the\ndifference between getting punched and\ngetting slugged can you slug sounds more\nfunny interesting Lex I got you know I\ngot slugged by that guy like you might\nlaugh but you know that guy punched me\nlike it's like oh smart move\nyeah there's more umph yeah so like I\nmean I didn't perceive that as is funny\nI perceived it as like maybe a piece of\n[ __ ] no you know you each carry\ndifferent connotations to certain words\nand they just sounded it just sounded\nheavy it sounded give me a second I'll\ntell you what I heard I heard a certain\nsense of finality to it I heard a\ncertain sense of inescapability to it I\nheard a certain sense of you trying to\nunderstand and like try to figure out\nwhat was going on maybe almost you\ntrying to forgive him by understanding\nthat poverty may have had a role to play\nthat you're not sure if it was his fault\nor if it was all his fault or how much\nwas that his fault and was he under\npressure but that it was his fault to a\ncertain amount but that there are other\nfactors that went into it I saw I heard\nhurt on you I also heard almost and you\nknow this is all just me projecting\nright because like I can't really know\nany of this [ __ ] but I I heard almost\nlike more heart with you watching the\nway that he treated your mom\nI heard powerlessness\ninevitability\nyeah\nthat sounds about right yeah\nand I think something about what you\nshared carried all of that uh so my\nfather is he's now dead yeah\nhe pretty much drank himself to death he\nhad cancer liver cancer it started in\nhis throat and my guess it's because of\nhis use of cigarettes and then it's um\neveryone was saying it's gonna be okay\nlike it's literally nothing serious you\nknow one surgery will fix it but then it\nspread everywhere and like in an in span\nof beer he he died you know from going\nfrom it's nothing serious and the\ndoctors all saying it's it's not it's\nnot gonna be a big of a deal to him\ndying and it's not it's not the pain\nthat he caused me and my my mother that\nhurts me it's cuz this all happened when\nI was 14 me my mother we ran away from\nhim\nwe was put ties with them we had no\ncommunication I'm 21 now and what's\ncrazy is I don't think I was emotionally\nmature enough to understand everything\nthat was going on and now that I'm 21\nyou know when you're a kid and like an\nadult can tell you the sky is purple and\nyou're like okay it's purple you know\nwhy cuz they're an adult you just\nbelieve and then when you become an\nadult you yourself you're just like that\nguy was full of [ __ ] this guy wasn't\npurple what did he tell you that was\nfull of [ __ ] what did they tell you that\nwas [ __ ]\nit wasn't what he told me it's what he\ndid like he had always uh back to the\nemotional part he would always looking\nback he pretty he mirrored he was a very\ninsecure man he projected his\ninsecurities onto me and my mother but\nme I think emotionally I actually I\ndon't know I think my mother and your\ntwo different types of things but he you\nknow I didn't really do that good in\nschool\nand he would just what am i why why did\nI make you or or why are you my son or\nyou know call me a bunch of swear words\nand always question what I'm doing with\nmy life and always told me I'm wasting\nmy time and why couldn't you get an\na-plus why couldn't you do this better\nwhy couldn't you know and if it weighs\non you sand could never be good enough\nfor him yeah and now that I'm grown up\nhe did nothing he didn't do anything he\nhe spent all the money on cigarettes and\nalcohol tons of money and he would scold\nme for wanting to buy a chocolate bar a\n$1 chocolate bar which every kid wants\nchocolate every kid wants can't write\nbut he would turn it around into\nsomething like how dare you ask for him\nhow dare you ask for this dad can I go\non this field trip how dare you ask to\ngo on the field trip you know what did\nthat how did you feel when he when he\nsaid that\nI felt like holy [ __ ]\nmaybe I am asking for too much you know\nmaybe I am a piece of [ __ ] mm-hmm\nwhy am I asking to go on the field trip\nwow I'm so uh why I'm so spoiled because\nhe would call me spoiled and I'd be like\nI am spoiled I believe them cuz he's my\ndad and I loved him used to love him\nI don't I don't know I I don't really\nwhen I try to recollect my memories I\ndon't really have any with him except\nnegative experiences how does it feel to\nrealize that\nuh it's just messed up it's it just and\nthis goes back to when I said when he\nwhat he passed away it's there's no\nthere's no fairytale ending there's no\nyou made a mistake and you're able to\ncome back and we were able to meet up as\ngrown men and talk about it there's none\nof that it just could all ask me like\nyou got robbed man that's the sense that\nI'm getting you got robbed of so many\nthings there's possibility of good\nmemories with your dad\npossibility of a dad possibility of a\ndad who supports you\nthe possibility to tell your dad to go\n[ __ ] himself which I don't know if you\never there yeah yeah did you yeah 100%\nhow did that feel - what pretty bad\npretty bad I mean it's like I said it's\njust no potential\nthere's nothing it's he's gone and that\nI think that hurts me even more cause\nit's just cuz I cuz a crazy thing is is\nmy dad I found this out for my sister\nshe's not really myself she's my\nhalf-sister she was she was from a\nfailed marriage previously of my\nfather's but I consider my sister and\nshe told me think a few months I think a\nmonth ago she told me my father was\nabused as a child - he was he was beat\nreally bad by his father\nand when I heard that at first I I\nlaughed cuz the irony\nyou know you get beat as a child by your\nown father and that you become into him\nmm-hmm and then it broke me because you\nknow he knew what that feels like\nhe knew oh [ __ ] he knew what that felt\nlike to get hurt and he did it to me\nso I I just\nthat's heavy man because you know I I\nwonder if there was some part of you\nthat you know there's some comfort in\nobliviousness right there's like there's\na difference between making a mistake\nbecause you didn't know where it wasn't\nunder your control or maybe it was the\npoverty or maybe it was the alcohol or\nmaybe he you know maybe you were a\nspoiled kid and and like those are all\nlike good explanations like they're safe\nexplanations yeah but if you know what\nit's like to be hurt and you do it to\nsomeone else it's like so much more\nintentional yeah well that's kind of\nhurt like way more yeah that and now\nthat I'm more emotionally aware and I\nthink very emotionally aware Coco I'm\npressed to be honest by the way if I'm\ntalking about being grown up at the age\nof 21 I was like damn son I know I mean\nit's more than fourteen it's more than\nfifteen you know yeah but let's be let's\nI mean maybe in your case you really are\ngrowing up but in my case I was like\nbasically developmentally 14 when I was\n21 it's not an exaggeration and I think\nwe're you know we're not adults at 21\nlike we call ourselves adults but like\nhow many 21 year olds know how to pay\ntheir taxes in my mind you're not an\nadult until you learn how to pay your\ntaxes I paid my taxes we'll see your\nyour separate your different cocoa\nyou're not one of us then\nwhy I think I've done a lot of critical\nthinking and I got a lot of what has\nhappened in my childhood and because of\nthe experiences and the ranges of\nemotion I felt I more emotionally\nintelligent very much so\nand I I do a lot of self-criticism and a\nlot of self thinking and the reason why\nI came to you is because I feel as if my\nworst fear is becoming like my father\nah that's my worst fear we can help you\nwith that\ncan I just think for a second yeah yeah\nfor sure\nso I'm gonna just think out loud okay\nI'm gonna try to imagine some of your\nthoughts and I'm gonna try to imagine\nsome of your reservations and I'm going\nto try to address them the short answer\nKoko is I'm not worried about you\nbecoming abusive at all and I've known\nyou for all of 15 minutes so what the\n[ __ ] do I know\nnot much and so I think the challenge\nhere is that you see some amount of like\nI said at the very beginning I mean\nafter your first kind of couple\nsentences I said there's a certain\ninevitability to it right and what I'm\nhearing even in that question is an\nissue of inevitability like your dad got\nbeat when he was a kid really bad and so\nhe beat you really bad and even though\nhe knew what it was like he still did it\nand and so there's a part of me that\nwonders like I'm just trying to put\nmyself in your shoes like is it possible\nto break that cycle because it seems\nlike it isn't like there's a certain\nsense of you know powerlessness about\nthis whole thing does that resonate with\nyou at all\nit scares me yeah so I think it's\ncompletely reasonable that it does and\nthat's actually why I have faith in you\nbecause it scares you so I don't think\nthat your dad I don't think when he was\n21 I would be really really surprised to\nhear words like what's coming out of\nyour mouth come out of his mouth I think\nyour dad was maybe we can't capable of\nall kinds of things and I really don't\nknow him I never met the guy never will\nso this is an unfair judgment but he\ndoesn't seem to me someone who's very\nself-reflective he wasn't right and so\nin my mind power comes I mean our whole\nethos is that power comes from awareness\nlike this is what confuses people they\nsay like what do i do once I understand\nthen I say like I kind of say you don't\ndo anything you just understand it's\nvery like a weird idea for people that\nunderstanding is enough so I think the\nthings that\nwhat do you play Coco that play rust not\ntoo familiar with rust can you tell me\nabout it\nuh it's pretty much you spotted naked\nwith a rock and then you go kill other\nnakeds with rocks okay it's like a huge\nlike you know like the saying like crabs\nin a bucket yeah each trying to pull\neach other down yeah yeah it's it's\nliterally just people pull each other\ndown for no reason this may sound kind\nof weird but do you feel abusive when\nyou're playing rust yeah I kill people\nand like I take like it you know\nminecraft you know how you can farm and\nyou like get you have a box and you put\nall your farm in the box and you like\nand you start upgrading you go from dirt\nto stone to like obsidian whatever\ndiamond rusts like the same concept you\nlike it's really like satisfying to the\nbrain because you can like you start\nwith a rock and then you slowly progress\nand you go from like a primitive Rock\nplayer you're on that island and then\nyou progress and you like start getting\nyou get a bow and then you get like a a\nhandmade like handmade yoga gun and then\nyou go from that to like a double-barrel\nshotgun you just progress and as you're\nprogressing in order to progress you\nhave to kill other real players and you\nhave to take their stuff it's either\nthey take your stuff or you take their\nstuff so it's you against them yeah is\nthere a particular if you played\nMinecraft before yeah I have like 2000\nhours in Minecraft so do you do the\ngames feel different to you yeah I love\ngames where it's like open world\nsurvival games I love that concept like\nalmost huge fan of dayz minecraft rust\nglass noises no I think that game [ __ ]\nwhy it just doesn't really look that\ngood I don't know I I checked it out\nlike I haven't played it but I'm just I\nthink I'm just really addicted to rust\ngot it\nfair enough I mean I just think it's\nkind of like you know this is this is me\nbeing a little bit academic and Freudian\nbut you know it seems to be like so I I\njust know that some of my friends play\nlast oasis and they're just like super\ntoxic humans\nfor us is really bad it's pretty toxic\nso oddly enough yeah I think that's not\nnecessarily a bad thing so I think\nsometimes we need outlets for certain\nfeelings that we have and I'd just be a\nlittle bit curious I don't know that we\nneed to go talk about this or if this is\nme really connecting dots because really\nnone of this stuff is supported by\nscience or very little of it but there\nis some evidence that people are drawn\nto video games for particular reasons\nmusic and so you know they're different\nlike six subtypes of like kinds of\ngamers so there's like the Explorer so\nthis is someone who enjoys games where\nyou like explore things there are people\nwho are more interested in narrative\nthere are people who are more interested\nin competition there are people who are\ninterested in progression you know there\nare so many different kinds of video\ngames like there are people who are\ninterested in like strategy and tactics\nand so the question is does that\ncorrelate to our personality and this is\nreally the first time that I've ever\nwondered about and I'm not please don't\ninterpret this like this because I'm\nabout to say something that I think can\nvery easily get taken out of context but\nwhether there's an abuser that is\ngrowing within you that finds an outlet\na trust hmm I mean my first game was\nStarcraft it was Starcraft 1 and the\nStarcraft 2 and then I got into dayz and\nthen I got it to rust but what you said\nabout like I thought about this too I\nwas like man I didn't like in rust like\nI have a rock that guy's a rock we gain\nnothing from killing each other I kill\nhim anyways and I thought about this I\nwas like why did I kill him like I said\nthere was another like time and rust\nwhen someone builds like a sign is like\na rust lemonade shack I broke it and I\ndon't I just broke it because I wanted\nto break it and I thought about I was\nlike why do i why do I enjoy doing that\nlike why did that make me happy to\ndestroy someone like what someone built\nyou know what I'm saying yeah it could\nbe because I just wanted to entertain\nthe chat and like like oh look it's a\nlemonade chat\nStan let's break it you know or it could\nbe because I had a puce and I'm just\nabusing a pixelated rust and I don't I\ndon't know which oddly enough I think\neven if that latter thing is true so I'm\nreally curious about that too I'd love\nto catch you in those moments cocoa and\nactually talk to you about like what's\ngoing on in your head mm-hmm\nand maybe we can do a little bit of that\nnow but oddly enough I think that that's\nokay so I think we have like tendencies\nand I think that video games can\nsometimes be a healthy way for us to\nlike work out our tendencies like they\ncan satisfy a part of us so that we\ndon't have to do that in the real world\nI'll get it it's it's like break like\ndominoes you know you set all the\ndominoes up you spend hours doing it and\nthen you just break it and it's super\nsatisfying to do it\nyou know so it doesn't matter to you\nthat it is someone else do you break\nyour own dominoes yeah I I would like\nmake well I was terrible at making Legos\nbut I would do what I can to make the\nleg goes as a child and then I would\njust break it or like I would how does\nit feel to break things feels like I\ndon't know it just you build it up and\nthen you break it like I would I would\nmake like a big base in Minecraft and\nthen I'd spend like hours doing it and\nthen I put TNT inside the base and I'd\nblow it all up and it felt good to do\nsatisfy what's satisfying I don't know\njust seeing it all just like blow up and\nlike the darts like coming out of the\nsky and you're just like oh and like I\ndon't know hmm is that weird\nis that like odd yes [ __ ] okay I think\nit's okay I don't think it's bad so you\nasked me if it's weird right so is it\nodd is it outside in the norm I just\nthink about so like let me let me\nexplain what I mean I don't mean to be\njudgmental there but you asked me a\nquestion and sometimes in other people\nis that okay no you're fine okay\nso like let me just put it this way when\nI see most people who play with Legos I\nsee the operative part of playing with\nLEGOs is the building not the breaking\nlike ie like that like even I'll go into\nadults homes and I'll see they'll have\nlike Legos on shelves instead of\ntrophies mm-hmm right yeah and I think\nabout like why like you know when I\nthink about like breaking apart Legos\nlike generally speaking the reason most\npeople break I mean I don't know about\nmost cuz I've never done a study about\nthis but when I think about like\nbreaking Legos I think about the goal of\nbreaking Legos is so that you can build\nthem again like there's the there's\nenjoyment in the building and then like\na lot of times like you know for example\nlike my kids get really bent out of\nshape if I try to put their Legos away\nbecause they've built something and they\nwant to keep this truck or whatever that\nthey put together I want to lose a\nlittle bit distracted like more like\nit's a little bit destructive but I do\nthink it is I mean generally speaking in\nmy singular anecdotal experience most\npeople who play with Legos are into the\nbuilding is opposed to the breaking does\nit mean you're damaged in some way\nplease don't interpret it that way all\nI'm saying is that it does seem to be\ndifferent from most of what I've seen\nabout why people use Legos what do you\nthink about that I think there's some\ntruth like I've thought of like why I do\nthe things I do in rust or I thought\nthat things like like you know in\nMinecraft I would go in grief people\nlike I would like there'd be like a\nwooden base and I'd be like man [ __ ]\nthis guy and I'd wide his base on fire\nman he would type in Chadwicks why the\nhell did you do that I said [ __ ] you\nthen I ran away yeah I don't I think\nthere's some truth to it truth to what\nwhat do we say what are you saying cuz I\nthink I did it because I felt powerless\nlike at the time like I was 13 and there\nwas I had no control I had no control\nover my life I was super insecure I\nstill am super insecure I'm still like\nbattling through that and it felt I\nthink that's why we go to video games no\nto like have an outlet to like have some\ntype of control it feels really good to\nget good I don't like it to become\nreally really good at a game and have\ncontrol in the video game because you\nhave no control in your life ok so just\npause for a second Coco I'm gonna ask\nyou a magic question are you getting the\nsense that I'm saying this what do you\nmean like all the stuff that you just\nsaid are you getting the sense that\nthat's coming from me or is that coming\noh no that's coming from me okay because\nI just all I was saying is that I think\nit is unusual like that most people when\nI hear them talk about Legos\nthey talk about building or they seem to\nemphasize building and so you ask me is\nthat weird and I said yes I'm not\ninterpreting what that means I get the\nsense that that interpretation is coming\nfrom you hmm right so like I haven't\nsaid anything about you being powerless\nas a thirteen-year-old like that shits\noh you know I'm saying that I mean I\nthink it's a good insight and I would\nagree with it and it's a hypothesis that\nI had which maybe you picked up on but I\njust was a little bit confused because I\nhadn't shared that with you yet so then\nlet me ask you this like you know that\nfeeling that you get before you break\nsomething down yeah like you want to\nbreak it down what you want it to be\nbroken you don't want it to be the way\nthat it is you want to take something\naway from someone yeah do you remember\nfeeling that way at home or at school or\nwhen you were growing up no not really\nnow\nI wanted to take someone's stuff yeah or\nmaybe like more related to your dad like\ndid your dad ever like evoke that\nfeeling like I know you couldn't act on\nit uh so you are basically asking if I\nhad any like negative I wanted to do\nsomething negative to my father is that\nwhat you're asking me yeah yeah yeah a\nlot of times I when he would hit my mom\nI would envision me picking up the golf\nclub next to me and hitting him with it\nor I would envision me hitting him\nreally hard in the head and stopping him\nor I would try to like figure out a way\nI could physically stop him how did it\nfeel to not be able to do those things\nthey still haunt me to this day the\nfeeling the feeling of not being able to\nprotect my mom and not being able to\nstand up and do something about it and\npowerless like I'm not like what kind of\nson am i if I'm not able to protect my\nown mother so Coco that makes I cannot\nimagine that you would feel that way I\nthink anyone in that situation any\nthirteen-year-old who's watching one of\ntheir parents hit another one of their\nparents is gonna feel ashamed and guilty\nthat they didn't do something to protect\nthem and that's what I'm hearing you say\nyeah you're aware that you feel this way\nlike this is not new to you right no no\nokay\nso now I'm gonna ask you so like\nsometimes people come here and I'm not\nquite sure what what our goal is here\ntoday but my sense is generally speaking\nI try to help people possibly explore\nthings that they haven't explored before\nand so the the takeaway from that whole\nstory is that\nyou were not good enough of a person\nright like you weren't good enough you\nweren't strong enough and so you blame\nyourself for that right yeah I wonder if\nthere's actually like a weird shadow to\nthat light or that object which is that\ndo you blame yourself at all for like\nnot being an [ __ ] and not being evil\nenough and being too good to not hurt\nyour dad like you wish I was more evil\nabsolutely I mean if if that's what it\ntakes to be able to prevent him from\ntouching my mom from hurting my mother\nif that if that's what it takes then\nabsolutely but yes 100% in my mind those\ntwo three different things and maybe\nthey're not to you but like like so not\nbeing able to stand up to your dad for\nyour mom's sake makes me think like you\nare not good enough right like you're\nnot like honorable enough or protective\nenough you're you're missing a positive\nquality with me hmm\nya know like I'm following it okay but I\nwonder if there's also like some sense\nin you that you're missing a negative\nquality like you're not evil enough to\ndo a bad thing and I wonder if you blame\nyourself for that like what is the\nabsence of a good thing like I'm not\nable to sacrifice for my mom and one is\nthe absence of a bad thing it's like I'm\nnot enough of a bastard to hit him over\nthe back of a head with a golf club like\nyou see how ones like a good person and\none's a bad person\nyeah like which one of those resonates\nwith you or both both of them do cuz\nit's I don't know if it's because I\ndon't know if it's all like I'm such a\ngood person I couldn't hit my dad I\nI just felt fear okay I was terrified\nwhat were you afraid of\nthat you would that he would hurt me\nback but she he did anyways sure so like\nwhat's the point then like you might as\nwell you might as well do something you\nknow and so that's what I'm like it's\njust like it's just a constant back and\nforth and I think a lot of my\ninsecurities stems from my childhood\nwhat do you mean by insecurity what are\nyou insecure about not being in control\nlike of my own like mind in my own body\nand not being in control of like what's\ngoing on like how my like how like how\nmy emotions lead me to do something I\nwouldn't want to do such as like happen\nyeah like I have like random emotional\noutbursts and like that weed me to\nhitting holes in the wall what do you\nthink is going on there\nwhat do you mean by rain can you give an\nexample of a random emotional hoppers\nlike something that's so like miniscule\nsomething that's like a minor thing like\na random annoyance like like something\nI'm arguing about with my girlfriend or\nsomething like a problem I'm having with\nsomebody right I get really angry like I\ncan go zero to a hundred for no reason\nin it and then it pisses me off even\nmore because I'm just like you're acting\nlike your father now hmm so then I get\nmoring I can see why you're so concerned\nabout being becoming an abusive parent\nJim yeah because it sounds like\nsometimes you're not in control No\nI'm more worried about you becoming an\nabusive parent now what do you think\nabout that I think I agree with you\nI think maybe my statement earlier of\nhaving faith because you're good or you\nknow you try to emotionally explore was\nmaybe a bit premature what do you think\nI think so too\nI'm glad we're on the same page so we\nshould take this seriously right maybe\nyou aren't as good of a person as as dr.\nK thought you were what do you think\nyeah and that's why we're here today\nbeautiful well I'm glad you're here\ntoday man I really hope I can help you\nout in some way I'm glad you're having\nme so let me think can I teach for a\nlittle bit instead I ask you questions\nwould that help you know yeah I mean I\nknow you've shared a lot so I kind of\nwant to take the pressure off\nthere are a couple of different angles\nto this the short answer first of all\nCoco let me start by saying I am still\nconfident that you can become a warm and\nloving parent who is not abusive so let\nme start there I don't think you're\nhopeless I think it's gonna be a steeper\nroad then I thought it was gonna be what\nis it like to hear that was that sigh\nrelief okay so I think I think it's\ngonna be your it's gonna be an uphill\nbattle but I think you can do it and\nfurthermore I think you're on the right\ntrack I still have faith in you although\nI'm recognizing that this isn't going to\nbe as easy as I thought it was so the\nfirst thing that I'm going to share with\nyou is actually something about\nneuroscience so when you take so our\nbrain has emotional circuitry like the\namygdala and the hippocampus and there\nare studies that show that different\npeople the activity of their emotion how\ncan I say this their emotional responses\nvary compared let me just think okay so\nI'll just I was gonna try to simplify\nthings but I'm not gonna simplify things\nit's actually easier to explain if I\ndon't simplify there is something called\nborderline personality disorder have you\never heard of it borderline personality\ndisorder yeah I think I've heard of it\nokay do you know what like you know like\nin the media there's kind of this common\nconception of a crazy ex-girlfriend yeah\nlike you don't like the attributes of a\ncrazy ex-girlfriend like they flip out\nright it's small things they stalk you\nthey show up here they do this there's\nlike something about them that's like a\nlittle bit crazy or very crazy and I'm\nnot I'm not trying to say that women are\nmore so than men or anything like that\nbut I'm just pointing out that this is a\nstereotype that a lot of people\nunderstand and I think it illustrates\nsome neuroscientific concepts so the\nstereotype in common media of a crazy\nex-girlfriend is actually clinically\nwhat we tend to call borderline\npersonality disorder so these are issues\nthese are people that have generally\nspeaking the following buckets of issues\nokay so the first is that they have a\nfear of abandonment so whenever someone\npulls away from them they kind\nlike flip now the second thing is that\nthey tend to be like emotionally like\nzero to a hundred very quickly so in\nstudies of people with borderline\npersonality disorder they take a\nparticular emotional insult and they do\nit to someone with BPD and someone\nwithout BPD and what they find is that\nthe the activity level of the emotional\nparts of their brain spikes way faster\nand also stays elevated way longer than\nother people\nso if a healthy person gets let's say a\nbad performance review at work they're\ngonna get bummed out over the course of\nthe interview where they get the\nperformance review like it's gonna\nhappen like thirty minutes into the\ninterview they feel really bad about\nthemselves and they're gonna feel bad\nabout themselves for like between one\nand three days for someone with BPD they\nstart to feel bad about themselves sixty\nto ninety seconds in the interview even\nbefore they get the bad news they start\nto like feel really terrible about\nthemselves and then they they beat\nthemselves up for an entire week so\nliterally the brains of people with\nborderline personality disorder or more\nemotionally responsive to small stimuli\nand stay more emotionally responsive for\nway longer than a normal person's brain\ndoes that make sense\nyeah that makes sense what do you think\nis the number one risk factor for\nborderline personality disorder trauma\nabsolutely so what what we've come to\nunderstand is that borderline\npersonality disorder is like it's not\nlike an infection right look they don't\njust wake up one day huh are they bad\npeople no no I know it no oftentimes\nthey are perceived at bad people because\nthey do things and this is why I'm\nexplaining this to you because I don't\nthink you're a bad person they do things\nthat are perceived as crazy by other\npeople because other people don't\nunderstand why they behave the way that\nthey do and the other thing that people\ndon't understand is that BPD people are\nnot stupid or crazy or knots or bad\ntheir brains literally wired this way to\nprotect them from certain circumstances\nso I'll give you just a\nsimple example why is it that a normal\nperson gets feels bad about themselves\n30 minutes into a performance review\nwhen your boss is telling you you've\ndone a [ __ ] job at a B & C whereas the\nperson with BPD within 90 seconds of the\nstart of the interaction the person with\nBPD feels like their [ __ ] like how the\n[ __ ] does that work your boss comes in\nthey say hey like how are you doing\ntoday what'd you have for lunch and at\nthis point the person with BPD starts\nthinking oh I'm an absolute piece of\n[ __ ] oh [ __ ] I'm gonna get fired how did\nthey even know to think that does that\nexperience relate to you at all by the\nway like can you understand that yeah\nyeah I think I do so Alex what way do\nyou relate to that the fear of\nabandonment okay so I'll explain to you\nwhy people with BPD are the way that\nthey are so I want you to imagine I mean\nin your case you don't have to imagine\nwhat it's like to grow up so for people\nwho haven't grown up with abusive\nparents imagine what it's like to grow\nup in an abusive household let me ask\nyou this how likely like let's say you\nget home from school one day was your\ndad at home when you got home yeah how\nlong would it take you to know if you\nwere gonna get beat that day did give me\nthe look absolutely so now we get to the\nlook is actually something that has been\nscientifically validated so what this\nmeans is that people with border like so\nin your case what your child brain was\ndoing is interpreting information and it\nlearned how to predict how someone is\ngoing to behave based on how they look\nat you so a look is way more significant\nto you than it is to the average person\nand that's absolutely a survival\nmechanism do you get that yeah like you\nhave to know the minute you walk in the\ndoor which of your dads you're gonna\nyou're dealing with where is he on his\nspectrum so there's a really really\nfascinating study it's my favorite study\non BPD where they take people they take\npeople with BPD and they show them a\nface\nexpression so like this so like how long\ndoes it take me to change from going\nlike this to this second it's like a\nsecond yeah\nso then what they did is they filmed\nthat that one second and they broke it\ninto 100 frames so if we think about it\nlike it halfway through the second I'm\nhalfway through smile and halfway\nthrough frown I'm kind of like this\nright and if you show my face to a\nnormal person who's halfway between\nsmile and halfway between frown what do\nyou think they interpret he's happy and\nthen he's frowning on the contrary they\ndon't know what the [ __ ] to interpret\nokay whereas you can show someone with\nBPD\n20 frames in so when this person is\nstill smiling 80 percent but they only\nhave 20% of anger in their face a person\nwith BPD picks up the anger whereas a\nnormal person they have to be eighty\npercent angry before they they pick up\nthe anger that's interesting that's\nthat's fascinating fascinating this is\nthe look you know exactly what the look\nis and other people who haven't grown up\nwith abusive parents don't understand\nthey like their brain literally cannot\nprocess that degree of information to\nlike interpret how someone is going to\nreact this is a consequence of your\nbrain adapting to trauma so now we get\nto why do you blow up it seems random\nit's not random\nit's because all you take is a very very\nit takes a very very small signal for\nyou to pick up and get emotionally\nactivated and then everyone else is\n[ __ ] confused because they're like\nI'm 80% happy and 20% upset your\ngirlfriend can be eighty percent happy\nand 20 percent upset and you're gonna\npick up on the 20% upset and that's what\nyou're gonna react to absolutely\nabsolutely and why do you do that is it\nbecause you're an uncontrollable\nemotional person no it's because like\nliterally I want you to think about this\nthere are two Coco's\none who goes home and pays attention to\nthe look and one who goes home and does\nnot to pay attention to the look and\nwhat happens to those two Coco's what\nhappens to one who pays attention he\ngets emotional okay what are his chances\nof getting beat on the week like Barry's\nokay super sporadic sure if you weren't\npaying attention to your dad what are\nthe chances that you get beat if I\nwasn't paying attention to my father\nyeah I always I was always paying\nattention to my father that's the first\nthing I did I step in the door good so\nmy point is that you were always paying\nattention and why is that because even\nbefore you remember there were times\nthat you weren't paying attention and\nwhen you weren't paying attention you\ndidn't see the look because you were\nplaying with your Legos and then you got\nbeat so you learned from a very very\nearly age you always have to pay\nattention because that is survival\nmechanism think about it like\nevolutionarily like in one scenario you\nget beat and in one scenario you don't\nget beat so your six-year-old brain\nlearns I have to pay attention and now\nwhat's happening is you haven't learned\nto stop paying attention or you haven't\nrealized that you're still paying\nattention and you haven't realized it's\nnot that you're like emotionally\nunstable no it's that you're emotionally\nyour ability to detect negative emotion\nand other things from people is way\nhigher than the average person even far\nbeyond what you're consciously Cape like\naware of and so then your girlfriend\ngets really [ __ ] confused but the\nproblem here is that you respond to the\nway that she's feeling which she doesn't\neven know herself she's not conscious of\nit and you're not conscious of it but\nyou put you detect it and then the part\nof your brain that form when you were\nsix to protect you from getting beat\ntakes over oh my god that's insane cuz I\nI remember like I'd walk I always walked\nhome from school so I'd walk home might\nopen the door and the first thing I do\nis sometimes he wasn't home sometimes he\nwas I let's get\nentire house and look for him I would\njust I would not like look at him lately\nlike I would try to just get a look at\nhim\ncuz the doors really wowed by the time\nI'm in he already knows I'm in the house\nyou know so I try to just get a look at\nhim and I first thing I do is I'd look\nat his face always and if he gave me the\nlook I was like oh I'm getting my ass\nkicked that's fascinating\nthat's it's weird what's weird about it\nwhat's because I didn't I didn't I\ndidn't know this I I wasn't conscious\nabout this I I had no idea like I wasn't\naware of what I was doing you know but\nthen you brought it up and it just makes\nsense\nI'm just trying to protect myself\nabsolutely so now the question is if you\nwant to change you're afraid that you're\na particular kind of person right yeah\nand so now what we have to do is we have\nto ask ourselves like when you blow up\nfor no reason is it truly no reason or\nare you just picking up on something\nthat you're not consciously aware of and\nyour girlfriend is not consciously aware\nof\nI think it's thing it's number two I'm\nnot a way I'm picking up on something\nand right so what and the person doesn't\nrealize what I'm blowing up for and I\ndon't realize when I'm blowing up for\nbut it's because I picked up on\nsomething that the person isn't even\naware of yep and just think about this\nwhen you went home when you were like\nseven or eight years old like\nconsciously like just think about the\neight-year-old if I were to ask you Coco\nis an 8 year old what are you doing\nyou would say I don't know like the 8\nyear old has no conscious do you see how\nlike the survival mechanism of your\nbrain has nothing to do with\nconsciousness mm-hmm like as the 8 year\nold doesn't understand why he's checking\nevery room in the house yeah and then I\nasked you like Coco what are you doing\nand you say I'm looking for my dad and\nthen I'd ask you why are you looking for\nyour dad and then you're like I don't\nknow like 8 year olds don't understand\nwhy they do things with me yeah\nso that part of your brain evolved and\nsort of like leveled up to a certain\ncapability and then like set itself\naside and started operating autonomously\nthat's how our brain works and then your\nconscious mind developed after the age\nof 14 15 16 so it's started growing over\nhere but it was never aware of like this\nother like it's like a program that's\nrunning in the background yeah it is\nright and then and then you think you're\na bad person because the conscious you\ndoesn't understand that like when you\nhit control-alt-delete\nand you look at the task manager there\nare all kinds of these processes that\nare that are running and you just have a\nprocess you have you literally have a\nsurvival process it's not like a I'm an\n[ __ ] process or I'm an evil person\nit's literally a survival process and\nthen there are a couple of other things\nlike you have you do have I mean I\nimagine so one thing that we see is you\nknow trauma is correlated with what we\ncall emotional instability which i think\nis a terrible it's the second worst term\nin medicine the number one term in\nmedicine that I think is dumb in\njudgmental is incompetent cervix which\nif you guys know what that means it's\nlike anyway when women are pregnant\nsometimes you know they have this thing\ncalled a cervix which has to open up so\nlike the uterus is different from the\nvagina and the cervix is like the door\nbetween the uterus and the vagina and\nthe baby is in the uterus and then the\ncervix opens up during birth so then the\nbaby passes through the uterus through\nthe cervix into the vagina and then out\nand then an incompetent cervix is a\ncervix that is like too loose and so\nlike it doesn't keep the baby in the\nuterus so you can have like a premature\nbirth and it can end bad but the word\nincompetent is just like it's like your\ncervix is [ __ ] dumb no it's not dumb\nanyway it's just anyway so like\nemotional instability I think is a\nreally judgmental term that I don't\nthink is fair it's not that you're I\ndon't think like even sensitivity is is\nlike has a negative connotation to it so\nI would say this Coco your brain is\nemotionally primed so you're like like\nyou know when you play rust and you're\nprimed for conflict and you're looking\nfor it yeah so you're paying at\nto every little thing in the environment\nbecause that could mean you get beat\nyeah and so that's what your brain is in\nterms of motions you're looking for\nthings you're always on the lookout\nbecause when you weren't on the lookout\nyou got beat hmm so it's not that you're\nemotionally unstable it's just that your\nemotions do react more quickly and part\nof that is all go ahead\nI think me living in New York like has\nelevated that to because in New York\nwhen you're walking by yourself at 2:00\nin the morning you're always looking\naround you're always making like some\nguy looks at you up and down and looks\nat your shoes right oh I don't it's\nfunny you say that about emotion and\nbeing able to judge someone cuz like\nwhen we go out to a party or we'd go out\nsomewhere I get one look at group of\nguys and I'd be like it's gonna be a\nlong night yeah it's gonna be a long\nnight so I will tell you this Koko I\nhave walked up and down the streets of\nNew York and I have never once thought\nabout anyone looking at my shoes like\nI've never once noticed what people are\nlooking at or not I mean I I have once\nor twice like I can tell when people are\npredatory and or mentally ill like have\nschizophrenia and things like that but\nyou know like because that's what I've\nbeen primed to look look at but I'm\ngenerally oblivious to things like that\nhmm and so this is just like your brain\nis prone to survival mechanism now the\nproblem that you run into is that your\nbrain evolved to function in a hostile\nenvironment right now the problems that\nyou run into and this is where you need\nto grow and change is not that you're a\nbad person\nbut you're no longer in a hostile\nenvironment so your brain is freaking\nthe [ __ ] out when it doesn't need to\nanymore that doesn't make you a bad\nperson doesn't make you emotionally\nunstable it just means that you need to\nlearn and you need to intentionally\nteach your brain how to respond\ndifferently because hopefully your\ngirlfriend doesn't be and she's not\ngonna be mm-hmm\nright hopefully is very very patient\nwith me yeah so so hopefully that's the\ncase and it's just gonna take you some\ntime to like learn that and you can\nintentional\ndo that to speed up the process like you\nknow hopefully most people like to learn\nhow to get over this at some point but\nwe can definitely help you understand a\nlittle bit about how to do that so I\nwonder if I mean I let me just pause for\na second and ask you one or two\nquestions so the first is what do you\nthink about our conversation so far I\nopening okay\nvery very eye-opening because you're\ntelling me things I'd even realize it's\nabout the whole emotional thing like it\nit makes sense\nit makes complete sense the first thing\nI do is look at a person's face and\ntheir body posture and I I can like tell\nhow they're feeling just like this yeah\nI get one read very common in trauma and\nI think in order to understand it my\noutburst we have to you know go deeper\nthan that deeper in what way cuz cuz my\nmy my idea was like I just had these\nrandom emotional outbursts that's what I\ninitially said to you right yeah and\nthen you talked about this idea of order\nline personality disorder and you're\nreacting you're in a hospital I feel I\nhave not changed or I've been able to\nfix this is cuz it varies I haven't had\none in two weeks but I have I have\nnightmares\nit's are flaring it flared around when I\nleft I couldn't sleep in a room with the\nroom was dark because as a child my dad\nwould strain and would come in the room\nand beat me up in the dark so I couldn't\nsleep in a room that was dark too I was\nlike 13 14 I was terrified of the dark\nnow I could sleep in the dark but when\nwe left and ran away from my father I\nstarted having emote the emotional\nnumber one the emotional outbursts well\nyou know what we talked about and number\ntwo I started having nightmares I've\nrecreated scenarios that my father has\ndone and scenarios that never happened\nbut still terrifies me and\nit happens once a week okay Coco are you\nseeing a therapist\nno hear us I had an evaluation done like\nfour for ADHD but that's was that even a\ntherapist I don't even know but probably\nyou're the first maybe\nyou're the first so a couple of concrete\nthings okay the first is that you know I\nreally think you should see a therapist\nby the way I don't think you have\nborderline personality disorder like\nthere's a you know I'm not diagnosing\nthrough something I'm using that as an\nexample of generally speaking so I used\nthat because the studies on BPD are\npretty good but essentially this is\ncommon of trauma so you don't have to be\npeppy PD but like my conception so a big\npart of the way that I view mental\nhealth which is like sort of different\nfrom some of my colleagues is they view\nit as an illness and it's absolutely\nlike an illness in the sense that it\ninterferes with your life right because\nyou don't want to have these emotional\noutbursts it's maybe puts a strain on\nyour relationship or things like that so\nI get that it's like not good for you\nbut the more that I've come to\nunderstand mental illness the first\nthing that I start with is that this\nperson is not crazy and the more that\nI've adopted that mindset the more I've\ncome to learn that like our mind does\nthings to protect us and it just doesn't\nknow any better\nright because your responsiveness to\nlike subconscious stimuli or like\nliterally a survival mechanism freedom\nand so now the question is so now this\nis kind of sort of sort of the second\npart is like now I'd like to ask you\nwhere you want to go so there are two or\nthree different directions one is that I\ncan talk to you about your thoughts and\nfeelings and we can hear stories about\nyour past and sometimes people feel like\nemotionally unburdened for that\nsometimes people watch for people\ntelling really heavy [ __ ] and they cry\nand they have this beautiful moment at\nthe end and all this kind of stuff we\ncan talk about your past and you can\nshare the dark parts I'm happy to talk\nto you about that leaning a little bit\naway from it because what I've actually\nlike to do is help you I get the sense\nthat you've explored some of those parts\nyourself in terms of getting to the\nemotions some people struggle and\nreaching the emotions it doesn't seem\nlike you\nyou've done a lot of good work around\nthat so the next two things that we\ncould do is to help you reinterpret and\nunderstand the impact of that stuff on\nyour current life so to help you tunnel\ndown into what precisely is an emotional\noutburst what are the sequence of the\nsequences of events and how can you\nunderstand like what that process is\nbecause once you know to look for it\nlike in rust that is camouflage right do\nyou how does yeah do you know how to\nspot camouflage if a bush is green and I\nmean it's pretty obvious of a guy just\nhiding in a bush okay so like my point\nis that generally speaking like you know\nthere are people like there are things\nthat are camouflage that are hard to see\nand once we learn how to spot camouflage\nwe come better we become better at like\ndetecting it and then we can act on it\nso I think that what's going on in your\nemotional outbursts is that there's a\nlot of stuff that you're blind to and\nonce we teach you how to not be blind\nthen you can start to control it\nbecause right now the problem is like oh\nI have this random emotional operation\nit's not random you think you're just\nlike you wake up and you're like in the\nmiddle like in the middle of a four-hour\nstream you just have an emotional\noutburst you're like taking your third\npiss of the day or you're refilling your\nbottle and you like just have this\nemotional outburst I mean maybe you do\nthat's what it feels like yeah so I\nthink that there's actually but that\ndoesn't make sense to me because like\nyou're not I mean human brains are not\nrandom right like you don't just you\nknow wake up one day and decide to dress\nlike a chicken and pretend and make\nmonkey noises like that's random like\nthe human brain responds and generally\nlike when do you eat when you get hungry\nwhen do you get sad when you talk about\nsad [ __ ] or you listen to sad [ __ ] or\nwhen you stop distracting yourself and\nyou're sitting alone right like there's\nan order to our mind and our thoughts\nand so you just don't get you're sad at\nrandom times when you watch a sad movie\nlike there are things that trigger our\nthoughts and emotions in particular ways\nwhen do you feel like eating pizza when\nyou see an advertisement for pizza or\nwhen you smell someone else eating pizza\nthere's like order to our mind so I\ndon't believe that your emotional\noutbursts are random\nI think the reason there are a couple of\nprinciples around that so I'd like to\nhelp you maybe understand your emotional\noperas the third option and this is kind\nof opening a different can of worms so\nmaybe like Session two or like you know\ntwitch stream to is to really talk about\nyour fear of abandonment and where that\ncomes from and sort of thinking about\nrelationships but I leave it up to you\nI'm happy to just listen and then you\nknow as you talk about things maybe I\ncan bring up a couple of other things so\nif you want to just tell us about you\nknow what it was like to run away at 14\nwhat you understood I mean all that\nstuff I think is gonna be interesting\nalthough I don't know exactly where\nthat's gonna go and this option number\ntwo is for us to dig into the emotional\noutbursts and maybe try to get some\nunderstanding of them because I think\nthat when I look at you I see one one\nfoundation to all of your fear and it's\nthat you're not in your control\nyeah and so if I think about how can I\nhelp this guy the simplest way is to\nteach you to help you see that you can\nbe in control and if I can do that\neverything comes tumbling down all of\nyour fears about being an abusive father\nwill come tumbling down\nand the third is to talk about a man in\nit what do you think we've got about\nmaybe 15 20 minutes left so we can kind\nof tie things up okay\nmaybe half an hour do you feel like it I\nthink by me telling what cuz like at the\nstart you're like I don't think I have a\nfear of you becoming like your father\nand then after I told another story\nalright I told you more about myself you\nunderstood more and you're able to you\nknow get more insight and more knowledge\nto me so I think by me telling you my I\nthink telling you more about me and my\ncharacter can help you help me sure\nbeautiful so what do you want to tell me\nabout your character so my fear\nmy fear of abandonment I think comes\nfrom cuz like you mentioned like people\nwith borderline personality disorder\nlike they get very emotional when people\nleave yeah right I think I do that too I\nthink I can I think I've done that and I\nhave I've done that in the past before\none other it's ex-girlfriends or it's\nsome you're the crazy ex-boyfriend I'm\nnot crazy and they're like oh like\nstalking the profile and like go into\ntheir house I'd never done anything like\nyeah I've never done anything like that\nbut I feel some type III definitely feel\nemotion but more from friends from like\npeople I conserve good friends and\nex-girlfriends because if relationship\ndoesn't work then [ __ ] it doesn't work\ncan't do it we got to move on but with\nfriends it's more of like when I\nbefriend someone I see them as like a\nbrother or a sister like I it's either\nwere associates or were very very very\nclose and when that person when there's\nthe threat of that person weaving and\nweaving my life I can get very emotional\ncan you tell me about that I get\nfrustrated because it's like can you\ntell me an actual instance like who are\nwe talking okay do you talk to me about\nsomething okay so me and this guy knew\neach other for I'd say two years and we\nwere really good friends we went to the\nsame high school we were on the same\nwrestling team really good friends we\nwent to each other birthday parties we\nhung out all the time blah blah blah uh\nhow old were then when you guys became\nfriends\noh we were we were fifteen when we\nbecame friends and then we were friends\ntold were seventeen and then I remember\nwhen we became seventeen he started to\nkind of drift away he kind of got\ndistant in our conversations and he\ndidn't check up on me as often as he did\nand\nI got really really angry and I got\nreally angry and I saw him in the\nhallway and I pushed him for no reason\nand then after that he blocked me and we\ndidn't talk after that\nso when you say for no reason mm-hmm\nhelp me understand are you detecting a\nreason now or at the time did you think\nit was no reason at the time I detected\nthe dozin right no reason I think I\nthink what happened now I was telling\nthe story of like what I thought back\nthen not like yep now like I think now\nwhat happened is he just found new\nfriends\nhe just cuz in high school and college\nlike people just you know like they they\nbounced around from social circle to\nsocial circle people change and I think\nlike he found his own like group his own\nlittle group cuz he he leaned more\ntowards uh what's what's the thing\ncalled when we argue debate team he\njoined a debate team and I continued\nwith wrestling hmm so he was more busy\nwith his schedule and I was busy with\nmine and I understand that now but back\nthen I just chalked it up as she hates\nme but he was just busy with his own\nthing yeah so let's let's not think\nabout now because that actually doesn't\nhelp us very much let's think about then\nbecause if we think about you know I\nokay I put you remember what we talked\nabout with Minecraft blowing up the tnt\nbuilding whatever I destroyed our\nfriendship yes I decided to destroy the\nfriendship and by pushing him and also\ninsulting him and just like kind of\nclowning him I destroyed our\nrelationship I destroyed it before he\ncould destroy the relationship because I\nfelt like that's what he was doing at\nthe time okay that's very common for\npeople with BPD hmm so let me share with\nyou some thoughts so once again I'm not\ndiagnosing you cuz I yeah over the\nInternet\nbut you understand that right I'm just\ngonna share with you information so\nhaving worked with some people with BPD\nand this also doesn't necessarily to be\nPD this is oftentimes people with trauma\nthe thought of someone leaving you can\nbe so painful and it can also be so\npowerless\nso sometimes it's kind of like this\nsentiment well if it's gonna happen\nlet's just get it over with like some\npeople especially in the histories of\ntrauma more so than BPD some people kind\nof you know have this mentality that\nlike I sure know not some people most\npeople actually assure no is easier to\ndeal with than an uncertain yes you know\nyou just like tell me do you like me or\ndo you not like me like let's just get\nit over with because right now I don't\nknow and it's the not knowing that's\nkilling me yeah that has nothing to do\nBP that's just normal okay right so like\nsometimes what happens is like what we\ndo is like when we're we're not sure\nwhere things are going but we don't\nthink they're going in the right\ndirection we like put things to a climax\nlike we put things to a test and it's\nlike what is he gonna do when I push him\nis he gonna like try to fix things or is\nhe gonna like let things go\ndoes that make sense yeah that makes\nsense so let me ask you this like so so\nwe used a very interesting phrase which\nis that he's he didn't check up on me as\nmuch so generally speaking when I think\nabout two friends I don't think about\ntheir interactions is checking up on\neach other does that make sense say that\nagain so you used the phrase he didn't\ncheck up on me as much mm-hmm he like\nstops checking up on me yeah but like I\nthink about checking up on is not like\nlike you didn't say he like stop texting\nyou\nright you stop texting me stopped like\nhe just kind of like fine went ended on\nthing I\nI completely I had her sent what you're\nsaying my point is that like used a\nparticular phrase which I don't usually\nthink about when I think about friends\nhmm like I'm gonna like you know play\ngames with my friends tonight but like I\ndon't check up on them during the day\nright like I message upon discordant\npsych hey man what do you want to play\nlike I don't envision that is checking\nup on does that make sense yeah that\nmakes sense so who do you check up on\nwhen do we I use the word like check up\non as in like just like you know if you\nhave a friend that you consider close to\nyou yeah hey man how you doing how's\nwork going how's how's uh how's your\nparents doing like you know smart like\nchecking up on them you know I\ncompletely agree so you're using it\nappropriately but how is the question so\nlet me put it this way like checking up\non is a sign of like how is your\ninteraction with your friends I\ncompletely agree that's checking up on\nI'm not saying it's not how is that\ndifferent from the way that I interact\nwith my friends like what is yours if I\nif I message you and I'm like hey man\nyou don't play games tonight versus if I\nmessage you know like hey man how are\nyour parents are they doing okay with\nKovan like what does one message imply\nin another message not imply one message\nis just you're trying to hang out yeah I\nguess the other message is you trying to\nbe like you you trying to like hey man\nlike how you doing I guess yes what's up\nlike I would say that one is about\ncaring and one in a not so when I think\nabout mentally when I think about who do\nI check up on it's the people that I'm\nworried about it's the people that I\ncare about does that make sense\nyeah and even the way that you interact\nwith people it sounds like you actually\nlike give a [ __ ] about them like you\ncare yeah so let's if we assume that the\nfray is checking up on associates with\ncaring what does it mean if he stops\nchecking up on you he doesn't care is\nthat how you felt yeah right so then\nlooking back looking back I think he was\njust we were both in high school and\nlooking back is fine now you understand\nthat but how did you feel back then I\nfelt like why is this piece of [ __ ]\nghosting me like what did what did I do\nwrong it feels like he doesn't care he\ndoesn't care about me he doesn't care\nabout you right and if he doesn't care\nabout you then what does that make you\ndo makes me want to like hurt him not\nyeah yes you want to loot Lee because\nwhat does it like to be not cared about\nfeels terrible\nin what way it my dad hurting me right\nyeah because it's even worse with\nfriends because I think the people that\nit's hard for you to get away from are\nthe ones that led you to believe that\nthey care mm-hmm it's like you\nunderstand that there's associates and\nyou don't emotionally invest in them at\nall no but once you open the door\nbecause it's hard for you to do that\nyeah it's really hard and then you let\nsomeone in and you start caring about\nthem and they start caring about you and\nthen like it can be it can feel really\nhurt I'm just gonna toss a sentence out\nthere and you let me know try to think\nback to you being 17 and whether it felt\nthis way you were supposed to care yeah\nafter all we've done together you were\nsupposed to care absolutely beautifully\nput\nand I I saw him like my brother you know\nlike I said it's either Associates or we\nwe even called each other brothers yeah\nit's either associates or it's you're\nvery very close to me there is no\nin-between I can't juggle that so when\nit's now I'm very like I'm very picky\nwith like who I let into my life and who\nI opened the doors for because it's the\nones that's closest to you that can hurt\nyou the most so oddly enough Coco I'm\ngonna suggest to you a different\nstrategy okay so the problem so let me\njust let's walk through that strategy so\nyou're more selective about the people\nthat you let into your life\nright so like ergo fewer people are\ncoming into your life what is the\nlikelihood that they will leave oh\nyou're talking about right now look not\nreally that like not really likely but\nthey're gonna leave right like just\nthink about it like you're 21 you're\ndating a girl like what's the chance\nthat you're gonna marry you pretty high\nokay I know you think that what's the\nchance that 21 year-olds marry their\ngirlfriend pretty well gonna happen\nright I'm not saying that your it's\ngonna happen to your case I mean when I\nwas 21 I was dating a girl and she's the\none that I ended up married were\ntogether 16 years later so knows I'm not\ndisputing that but I'm saying\nstatistically you're letting fewer\npeople in but because of stuff like\nyou're 21 right so like people are gonna\nbe like your friends are gonna be like\ngraduating and moving and things like\nthat like all that kind of [ __ ] is gonna\nhappen in the same way that you look\nback on high school and you say people\ngrow and they change you're still 21 man\nlike people are still growing and\nchanging so those people are the people\nthat you choose to let in are gonna\nleave your life and it's gonna hurt when\nthey do that and the problem is that\nwhen they leave your life for completely\nnormal reasons what are you gonna do how\ndid you respond to being hurt in high\nschool what do you do now\nI pushed them\nyou bet what's happen now I would just I\nwould just think about the good times we\nhad that's really that's really nice to\nhear I think though that what you would\ndo is probably more of what you're doing\nnow so here's the pattern that I'm\nseeing pretty open arms lots of people\nin and out you get hurt a couple times\nnarrower arms I'm more selective fewer\npeople in and out chances of people\nabandoning you less but it's still gonna\nhappen cuz you're 21 yeah and when you\nget hurt again narrower very few people\ncoming in and out so I think over time\nyou're gonna isolate yourself I think a\nbetter strategy is for you to when you\nperceive that someone else is pulling\naway from you having a conversation with\nthem\ndon't just mourn and think about the\ngood times like you can actually change\nthem leaving if you change the way you\ntalk to them right if you were 17 and\nyou were kind of saying like hey men you\nhave time to chat and then like not just\nchat cuz like I'm sure you made good\nefforts right you would check up on him\na couple times it started becoming\npretty one-way and you sort of saw\neverybody I try I try to hang out with\nthem and like you wouldn't give you the\ntime of day oh you'd say yeah and then\nyou just ghost me absolutely right and\nand so then like I think what you need\nto like learn how to like not just push\nhim away at that point or say like [ __ ]\nhim he's not worth my time because\nthat's like another sort of impulse\nright like when we get hurt we're like\n[ __ ] that he's not worth my time\nyeah it's to actually like authentically\nshare with people what you feel and it's\nhard when you're 17 but like you know\nit's to sit down with the guy and say\nlike hey man like we've made plans three\ntimes and you've ghosted me three times\nlike I understand that people grow and\nchange and you've got a new batch of\nfriends and you're in a debate club I\nthink that's awesome but to be blunt\nlike I thought we were really tight and\nI know that it's not it's not like you\nhate me or anything but like frankly\ndude I miss you like it's hard for a\n17-year old male to tell another 17-year\nold male who are platonic and close that\nthey miss each other our society has not\nmade it easy for us to say things like\nthat yeah but if you feel like people\nare\nleaving your life like rather than like\ntry to maneuver around it which once\nagain your brain is gonna do because do\nyou see like how your brain shut down\nany kinds of attempts at direct\ncommunication about how you feel because\nif you told your dad how you felt\nnothing [ __ ] didn't matter yeah so\nyou have literally shut off a particular\npath of interacting with people and the\nreason that you shut it off is because\nyou had such a big influence in your\nlife with which that path of\ncommunication was useless but imagine\nthis for a second right like if you base\na strategy about how to live your life\non the interactions with your dad you're\n[ __ ] yeah cuz thankfully people are\nnot your dad oh thank god and so you've\ngot to learn a different way of\ninteracting with people right it's to\nlet people know like hey man like I'm\nfeeling like we're drifting apart in\nthis relationship\nI mean it's some hard [ __ ] to say but\nit's kind of like literally telling\npeople hey man I feel like we're\ndrifting apart and I value our\nfriendship\nand I want you to be a part of my life\nit's like if you say that to like one of\nyour friends on discord like what the\n[ __ ] like they don't even know what to\ndo with that right but then you can\nmodel with that the chances are you feel\nthe same way and then like they're gonna\nsay something to you they're gonna say\nlike yeah man I'm really busy like\nactually it turns out that like my dad\nhas cancer and I don't have enough time\nand then it's like oh [ __ ] and then you\nunderstand cuz there's a part of you\nthat feels like you were a piece of [ __ ]\nbecause remember your dad a long time\nago you started believing that you're a\npiece of [ __ ] and now this is where we\nget into the psycho now this is\npsychobabble kind of stuff so you have a\npart of you that starts with the idea\nthat takes the truth that you're a piece\nof [ __ ] and then what it does is it it\nlike you've got some sort of lethal\ncombination of shits - it's the perfect\ntornado you know part of yourself\nbelieving that you're a piece of [ __ ] an\noversensitive or a highly primed sensory\nsystem that detects any kind of\ndiscomfort so even if people are 80%\nhappy with you in 20\nsad with you or frustrating 20% sad\nyou're gonna you see how that's like\nthat's a double whammy yeah those two\nthings combined to make it hard for you\nto engage in relationships if we def we\ntook away either one you'd be fine it's\nthe combination of the two and that's\ngonna change the way and then the third\nthe third like if you want three strikes\nand you're out the third strike is that\nyou have not been taught how to relate\nto people with your feelings because\nthat entire process was [ __ ] a waste\nof time when you were growing up like\nyour mom maybe tried talking to your dad\nand they're like please don't hit Coco\nand your dad was like [ __ ] you and then\nsmack turn and then smack to you and so\nthen your six-year-old brain was like oh\ntalking to people is a waste of [ __ ]\ntime\nwhat's way better is for you to\ninterpret to mind-read and then adjust\naccordingly which is exactly what you do\nyou mind read oh this person doesn't\ncare about me oh I'm gonna do this and\nI'm gonna do this like you never\ninteract with them you interpret it\nbecomes truth in your mind you know\nexactly what their thoughts are and then\nyou just adjust your behavior without\never directly communicating with them\nwith that I said to her because I was\nthinking about your girlfriend is that\nwhat you do with your girlfriend yeah\nabsolutely\nyou know what's in her mind I don't know\nwhat's in her mind but like I look at\nher face and my mood can insulate just\nlike that right so now I'm gonna give\nyou something super super concrete okay\nwhich is when you look at her face and\nyour mind shifts like this I want you to\ntry to see what the mind has had what's\nhappened in your mind and all even even\nif you don't seek if you can't piece it\ntogether what I want you to do is tell\nher in that moment I'm not sure exactly\nwhat happened but something just shifted\nin my mind and I'm feeling kind of like\nantsy or stressed out just communicate\nwith that to her and then the cool thing\nis because she's not your dad she's\nactually hopefully gonna like help you\nwork through that and then maybe you\nguys can have a conversation about it\nand maybe you'll feel better and then\nyou don't have to\nlet that shift control and that's where\nyou're gonna get your power back makes\nsense that makes so much sense\nThank You dr. kay thank you for watching\ncoca I still have faith in you man I\nthink you're gonna be okay\nit's gonna be you know it's gonna be\nhard like it's hard to do that but just\nstart with catching catch the shift as\nbest as you can\nmm-hmm and then shirt like like catch it\nand communicate like you don't need to\nfix it you don't need to get her to do\nanything you don't need to do anything\nyourself catch it and communicate that's\nreally all you need to do questions so\nnot just my girlfriend but just like\npeople in general like if I get it's\nlike second nature like if I can look at\na person to say it's first nature its\nfirst Nate if I can look at a person's\nface and my I can't it's it's not like a\nthought process it just happens\nyeah it just happens anyway how do i how\ndo I control that if it's just impulse\nit's it's like drinking water you don't\nyou know you don't drink water in your\nnose you drink in your mouth yeah see\nyou can't control the first step you can\ncontrol the way that you respond to it\nso this is it's kind of weird but when\nyou say its second nature it's not\nsecond nature its first nature what you\ncan actually control the second nature\nyou can't control the way that your face\ninterprets I mean the way that your\nsenses interpret their face because\nthat's been programmed in that process\nis running what you can do is control\nthe way that you respond to that that's\nwhere the control comes from you can't\nand maybe over time you can actually you\ncan over time rewire that brain that\npart of your brain there's good data to\nsupport that but it takes a couple of\nyears but what you can you can also do\nis like you can catch it and then you\ncan choose not to respond in the way\nthat you normally do which honestly the\nway that you normally respond is by\ndoing nothing you see that like you do\nsomething way down the road from when\nyou know the problem arises does that\nmake sense\nmm-hmm there's like you notice point a\npoint B\nsee point D point e point F you notice\nlots and lots of things and your brain\nis interpreting lots and lots of\ninformation you act around like X Y & Z\nand at that point like that's where the\nemotional outburst comes from nowhere it\ndoesn't come from nowhere\nit comes from 97 percent of [ __ ]\nbuilding up and then you just overflow\nyeah like I want you to imagine it this\nway let's say my trashcan is full and\nthen I throw one banana in the trash and\nthen the banana spills out and then I\nscratch my head and I'm like holy [ __ ]\nit's completely random sometimes I throw\none banana in the trash and it doesn't\noverflow and sometimes I feel like it's\ncompletely random like my my trashcan is\nrandom like one banana can make it\noverflow sometimes it's not how it works\nman it's not random you're overflowing\nand you're just not aware that your\ntrashcan is filling up throughout the\nday so the solution is to catch as\nlittle the any point that you can catch\nit and then I would say start with your\ngirlfriend because that's kind of easy\nlike it's weird to do this with other\nhumans but you have to pick someone\nthat's kind of like intimate that you're\nclose with you can pick your mom or\nsomeone who can be patient with you it\nsounds like she's patient and then you\nknow she comes home one day and then you\nsee her like you're telling her about\nyour day and she's texting and then you\nget like jealous or pissed off at her\nbecause it feels to you like she doesn't\ncare because if she cared she wouldn't\npaying attention and then what you do is\nyou catch it and then as best as you can\nyou try to explain it to her and gonna\nsay like I don't know why like and this\nis what you have to be careful because\nthis is where like the abusive part of\nyou could come in if you try to control\nher behavior and make her stop texting\nthen you go down the abusive Road\ngotcha so you don't want to control it\nyou just want to acknowledge and say\nlike I'm not saying and then you have to\nlet her do that right like you have to\ngive her the power to sort of say like\nhey I'm not saying you should stop\ntexting but right now in this moment I\nfeel like you're not really paying\nattention to me and I just really want\nyou to and then it's like you guys have\nto work out like - sure she stopped\ntexting right now or should you learn\nhow to manage your own feelings and then\nshe's\nfinish your texting and then she'll like\nyou guys will connect in 15 minutes and\nthen you guys can talk about it\nhow's a question yeah I think she should\nso if she's texting and I see her and I\ndon't like that she's texting I\nimmediately catch myself and I say hey I\ndon't really like that you're texting\nit's bothering me I have a feeling do\nwhat I shouldn't say put the phone down\ndo I just say how I'm feeling absolutely\nand in fact what you want to say is I'm\nnot asking you to put the phone down I'm\ntrying to share with you the way that I\nfeel okay right so sure okay you don't\nwant to guilt-trip her into putting the\nphone down which is what's gonna happen\nso you even need to collect correct on\nthe opposite side and then like if\nthere's an impulse to you that's like\nput the [ __ ] phone down [ __ ] you\nneed to notice that - I don't think I\ndon't think like that okay good I have I\nam like that's just like like why is she\nnot paying attention to me yeah like I\nlook at her face I'm like oh she doesn't\nreally care what I'm saying her eyes are\nyou know right I know I know that see\nbut you don't this is the thing you\ncan't know your brain tells you you know\nbut you literally cannot know what's in\nsomeone's head but that's not what your\nbrain tells you your brain is like I see\nthat look in her eyes and I know like\njust pause and think about that for a\nsecond can you like can you read minds\nno but you feel that way yeah right so\nlike like people who have had a history\nof trauma can become mind reader's\nthat's what they feel they start to\nbelieve that the thoughts are facts\nright and looking back on it now like\nyou recognize that that your body just\nlike you know he grew into a different\nperson because you guys met when y'all\nwere 15 and then like he was 17 and then\nlike y'all are different people but back\nthen you knew that he didn't care about\nyou you see that difference yeah I see\nthe difference and you're gonna have it\nnow - you're gonna know that she doesn't\ncare about you and then you can also\nlike let her know cuz it's gonna be\n[ __ ] weird for you got to get\nlike some kind of like background about\nthis conversation and that you're gonna\ntry something new I'll just have her\nwatch a stream she's not watching right\nnow because I asked her not to but I\njust have our watches sure right and\nthen and and so you're right like so you\ngotta be really careful because you\ndon't want her to act what you want to\nbe able to do is separate because this\nis exactly your goal so just listen\ncarefully separate your emotions from\nother people's actions and your own\nactions separate decouple emotion and\naction oh that's so hard yes and here's\nthe thing Koko once you can do that you\ndon't have to worry about being an\nabusive father anymore okay I'll try you\nwith me yeah I'm with you because it's\nthe abusive father is gonna come from\nuncontrolled emotion it's gonna come\nfrom emotion leads to action and there's\nno control in between so you can\nliterally train yourself to uncouple\nthose things by sharing your feelings\nwith her and asking her not to put the\nphone down mm-hmm and then saying can we\ntalk about this in 15 minutes and then\nas you learn to wait 15 minutes or five\nminutes or 60 seconds it starts with as\npathetic of a time amount as you want to\nthen it becomes 90 seconds then it\nbecomes 10 minutes then it becomes 15\nminutes hey can we check in about this\ntomorrow and then one day you're gonna\nwake up in your emotions don't control\nyou dad that'd be the best day ever but\nit's gonna be hard and it's gonna be\nslow so catch it and communicate this\nstep one you ready to meditate yeah I'm\nready to try really try to get this\nthing under control okay good so we're\ngonna start sit up straight I have a\nreally really hard meditation technique\nfor you okay mmm close your eyes I want\nyou to notice your breath\nso unfortunately Coco this technique is\ngonna be hard and I'm not going to give\nyou any training wheels so I want you to\ncan you tell the difference between the\ninhalation and exhalation like like I'm\ninhaling and exhaling mm-hmm can you\ntell the difference it's kind of a silly\nquestion I know but it's a simple yeah\nobviously so I want you to find the\nmoment where inhalation becomes\nexhalation\nokay\ncan you find it find the moment\ninhalation becomes exhalation yes\nit happens when I mean it happens when I\ninhale and then when I feel like I've\nbeen held enough I exhale I am not sure\nokay\nso let me ask you something is there a\nmoment where you pause the breath yeah\ndon't pause okay let the breath flow\nnaturally from inhalation to exhalation\nI'm doing it and now catch the moment\nwhere one becomes the other well that's\nweird\ngood that means you're doing it right\nslow down breathe through your nose\nslow slow slow breathing way too fast go\nslow I understand why you're breathing\nfast because you're trying to collect\nmore data at the transition yeah let\nyourself sit in the exhalation is\ninhalation and then sit in the\nexhalation and then notice that\ntransition\nby way too fast\nI think you're doing better if you feel\nlike you're breathing too fast then slow\ndown don't get lightheaded take a break\nfor a couple of breaths if you need to\njust breathe normally and then return to\nthe technique\nI think I'm doing it okay what are you\ndoing tell me I'm inhaling and then\nbreak before I hit spring I'm exhaling\nand I'm catching it again on the inhale\nI'm sorry can you say that again I'm\ninhaling and then before it hits like\nthe top I'm exhaling and then it like\nbefore it like I'm switching it over and\nover again so how are you exhaling if it\nhasn't hit the top yet cuz I'm just I'm\njust letting it out what is that what do\nyou mean by the top is that not the end\nof the inhalation and I am I supposed to\nbe going at the end of an inhalation\ncan you I think you're doing it right\nbut maybe let's just understand our\nterminology so what I'm hearing from you\nis that you are catching the moment\nwhere inhalation becomes exhalation yes\nsir yeah yeah okay describe that moment\nto me it feels I don't know it feels\npretty good it feels like I feel really\nrelaxed it feels awkward too though I\nhave never breathed like this before and\nwhat feels awkward about it because like\nI feel like there's like a rhythm with\nbreathing and I'm like I'm just like\nbreaking that rhythm so I'm just not\nused to this pattern of breathing like\nthis rhythm of breathing and what is the\nrhythm of breathing that you're doing\nare you doing something a rhythm across\nmultiple breaths are you changing the\nway that a single breath is breathed I'm\nchanging the way that a single breath is\nbe and how are you changing it I when I\ninhale I use the exhale\nI think I'm not explaining myself\nproperly that's okay it's because it's\nhard to describe they're just it's it's\na lack of sufficient words in our\nlanguage it has nothing to do with you\nknow your capability so it sounds to me\nalmost like you are starting to exhale\nwhile you are still inhaling yeah yeah\nokay so I think you're doing\nyou're doing this call it's what you're\ndoing is somewhat impossible but I think\nyou're doing it right because do you get\nthis like you can't inhale and exhale at\nthe same time that's like literally not\npossible yeah yeah but you're doing it\nright and so now what I want you to\nnotice is that what you're noticing is\nthat there's a phase where inhalation\nand exhalation overlap right\nbut if inhalation and exhalation overlap\nover a period of time that is not the\nmoment where inhalation becomes\nexhalation right I guess so let me put\nit this way I want you to zoom into that\ntransition and find where exactly they\ncrossover perfectly okay by the way\nsometimes it takes people a couple of\nmonths to do this yes I'm like I feel\nreally relaxed but at the same time I'm\nlike getting frustrated because I feel\nlike I'm not doing it right no you're\ndoing it right it just takes practice so\nthis - so very good Toma have I done\nsort of now I want you to notice your\nfrustration right so notice your\nfrustration and then step away from it\nand do three more breaths where you look\nfor the moment of an inhalation\nexhalation okay just focus on the\npractice notice that you're frustrated\nmaybe I'm not doing it right you're\ndoing fine by the way I'm telling that\nyou're doing it right but just notice\nthat frustration let it be separate from\nyou and return your mind to where you\nwant to go\ndo you feel the frustration I don't\nreally feel it right now no good where\ndid it go I don't know I just breathed\nthis I don't know I wonder I wonder if\nthis can help you the next time you add\na tiny little piece to the to the trash\nmm-hmm so now we're done so now I'm\ngonna explain us a couple things to you\nfantastic job Coco first of all it's a\n[ __ ] weird exercise okay so part of\nit is like we're exploring things like\nit's like trying to explain to someone\nyou know if I take my kid and I put them\nlike in the water for the first time in\ntheir life and I ask them how it feels\nlike I asked them how does it feel how\ndoes the water feel different from the\nair they're not gonna have words to\ndescribe their experience even though\nthey're feeling it does that make sense\nand then they may even get frustrated\nwhen they try to describe how water\nfeels different from air because then we\njust don't have language for so you're\nso let yourself get frustrated so be it\nbut return to this practice and this\npractice is gonna help you in two ways\nthe first is that it's training you and\ncatching it's training you to notice\nthat which you have never noticed before\nwhich is gonna be like that's your rock\nin rust right that's where you get\nstarted and sure you can upgrade you can\ndo fancy meditation you can become a\ngood communicator you can decouple your\nemotions from your actions and all that\nstuff you can wonderfully build up over\ntime but your rock the thing that you\nstart with naked man whether rock is\ncatching catching is where it all begins\nand you were doing it today because you\nnotice things about yourself that you've\nnever noticed before you see that yeah\nthat's the [ __ ] point it doesn't\nmatter whether you figure out the answer\nor not it's not about the answer it's\nthat you're training yourself to look\nman so just do that and the second thing\nbonus little side advantage is that as\nyou experience frustration if you look\nfor the transition of the breath it will\ngive you\npower over the frustration that's down\nthe road okay questions no questions\nawesome man thank you so much for sure\nthank you dude\nthank you so much very welcome and thank\nyou so much for coming on and sharing\nhonestly I think that's the only time we\ncan do our work is when people are\nauthentic and like had the courage to\nsay what I was shaking last night like\nmy hands were shaking last night I was\nshaking when I came on I was a nervous\nwreck I was like oh my god how am I\ngonna like I'm gonna really go on here\nand but I feel so much better I feel so\nmuch better\ngood I I cuz you can't solve a problem\nif you don't know the question it's\nimpossible to solve it so it's like my\nentire life I'd be like oh there's emo\nbut the trash cans overflowing I don't\nknow why it's overflowing why is it\noverflowing I put a banana in there I\ndon't know and my entire life was based\non that and now like no it's you're just\nnot taking out the trash dumbass you\nknow yes perfect so this is why I have\nfaith with you for you Coco because if\nyou can learn how to take out the trash\nyou're not going to be an abusive father\nit's that simple is it easy\nno but there's absolutely a way forward\nabsolutely okay and you've got years I\nimagine before you become a father never\nknow yeah yeah so you've got some time\nso I'm glad you came on today really\nreally happy with how you're feeling and\nI'm great kid to you as well so good\nluck man thank you so much dr. kay Thank\nYou Brad take care yeah my pleasure\nall right\n[Music]\nmmm okay let's see\nwe got time for questions can we do like\nthree questions yeah let's do it okay\nsorry midstream hey okay hey what's that\nmean\nalright so my question in grants to\nstream so say I'm making an effort and I\nmean effort sort of like reflexive\nlistening\nsort of like taking from the\ncommunication stream so I'm again effort\nto communicate to a person like how I\nfeel but then I noticed that person\ncomes like defensive so quotations like\nwhy are you questioning me like why do\nyou care so much for me those type of\nresponses what would be like the most\nlike safe strat to respond other than\nlike I care for you dude or like I I'm\nworried about you ah so this does\nrequire like you have to level up your\ncommunication past level one\nso so there are two things right so how\ndo you reflectively listen - why do you\ncare for me how do you reflectively\nlisten - why do you care for me I guess\nlike I give me I would give reasons as\nto why I would care that's not\nreflective listening right sure yeah\nokay yeah so like literally how do you\nreflectively listen like if I say so\nlet's play this game okay you're what am\ni calling you buddy\nI assumed zero so Xiao Xue Xue okay so\nstill I care about you now you play your\nfriend we're gonna roleplay\nso you play your friend and I say Zil I\ncare about you wait like why so why do\nyou care so much about me like I like I\ndon't like I don't need you it sounds\nlike you're kind of confused as to why I\nwould care about you yes\ncan you help me understand why you're\nwhy you think it's strange that are like\nwhy you have trouble like help me\nunderstand why you think that I wouldn't\ncare about you\nI think because like okay I see like I'm\ntrying trial play like the other\nperson's like yeah like they have like I\nguess like their own sort of like\nreasons as to why\nokay sure and then you reflectively\nlisten to those it's like the way that\nyou reflectively listen to a question so\nthis is the thing you guys think\nreflective listening is hard because you\nall get caught up and then you try to\nprovide reassurance no man it's\nliterally it sounds like and then you\nfill in literally what they said let's\ntry it again\nso Zil now you try it\nI'm gonna play your friend and you're\ngonna play you okay so like hey man like\nso I I feel as if like you're you're\nbeing more distant and I I noticed that\nyou've acted differently around me\nversus other people and I just want to\nknow why is that okay so I don't know\nwe're gonna have to talk about that\ncommunications though but so I don't\nunderstand like why like I don't\nunderstand why you would care about like\nwhat I think like I don't understand why\nyou think I'm like why you care about me\nlike what what difference does it make\nwhether I treat you a certain way or\nanother way I guess like to pard a like\nthat difference kind of feels makes me\nfeel kind of you're answering the\nquestion it's not reflectively listening\nwrong okay gotcha\nwhat is reflectively listening gonna be\ntrying to understand it's like oh I'm\nsorry that no be like it's literally\nliterally say it sounds like and then\nrepeat the words that I say let's try\nagain yeah okay Zil express your caring\nfor everybody we'll get you there hey\nman like you it it seems like you you've\nchanged a bit you've acted differently\naround me I don't know why you care man\nlike I don't know what the big deal is\nlike I don't know why you would care\nabout like how I act around\nso you're saying that you don't\nunderstand why I care about you yeah I\nmean that's what I'm saying man like I\ndon't understand why you care so why do\nyou think that is though that's not\nreflective listening actually okay I\nmight need I'm I needed a refresher in\nterms of like this contact so it's it's\nliterally okay we're gonna try it one\nmore time okay I'm gonna play you and\nyou're gonna play your friend okay the\nproblem is that you're responding to my\nquestions instead of repeating them\npretend that you're repeating bond and\nyou just repeat like you should be a\nmake yourself into an NPC people in chat\nare saying like NPC simulator simulator\nand you guys think that this is easy\nit's not [ __ ] easy\nI trained six years to learn how to do\nthis okay gotcha okay so let's try it\none more time I'm gonna be you and\nyou're gonna be your friend okay so hey\nman like I'm concerned about like how\nour interactions have been going\nrecently it sounds like you know I feel\nlike you're kind of treating me\ndifferently why should that matter to\nyou like why do you care so much about\nwhat I need to do like don't need to\nworry about y'all so it sounds like\nyou're feeling like I shouldn't care so\nmuch about what you I shouldn't care so\nmuch about what you're doing I should\nreally pay more attention to like how\nI'm acting yeah yeah so can you tell me\na little bit about how you think I\nshould be acting differently well I\nthink you should try not to worry about\nme\nI see so you think that I shouldn't be\nworrying about you very much yeah and\nhelp me understand why I shouldn't worry\nabout you very much\nbecause I'm trying to do my own things\nlike I got my own problems like I don't\nneed you to care about me like I'm an\nindependent person yeah so you're you're\nan independent person it doesn't sound\nlike you need my help yeah\nso how has this been so far so now I'm\ntalking to you you got so we did like\nthree three reflective listening\nstatements yeah right so like you just\nroll with it whatever he says you just\nrepeat it back\nyou don't answer his questions you don't\nsay like yeah man you do need my help\nyeah man like if you if he says like\nyeah you should like why don't we talk\nabout you for a minute and then you say\nyeah okay let's talk about me for a\nminute what should I say differently all\nright so so the safe strats sort of like\nrolling with it like continue rolling\nwith it to you not answering questions\nrepeating questions right yeah yeah yeah\nit's just you don't answer his questions\nyou just reflect them back like I want\nyou to imagine that like you have 100%\ndamage resistance and anything he sends\nyour way you just bounce right off you\nsend it right back to him okay right\nit's like and the problem is like when\nyou let something in and then you give\nsomething back out you can't have 100%\ndamages this is resistance it's like\nyou're like you know you've ever played\nan RPG where you have a defend action\nyeah like we guard yeah and when you\nguard you can't attack you can't cast a\nspell when you're guarding the only\nthing you can do is guard and so the\nsecond you start answering his questions\nyou're no longer guarding reflective\nlistening goes away gotcha okay so just\nguard and keep cockpit and so basically\nwhat I do is like I'm a turtle right so\nlike way to do therapy is like you're a\nturtle or you're an NPC bot that's also\na turtle and you show up in you guard\nwith people and then they get really\nconfused and then they explore things on\ntheir own if you never say anything in\nsomeone's like talking to a blank wall\nbut you're kind of encouraging them to\nkeep talking and then they'll figure\nthings out on on their own basically\nwhat I do you want to see a good example\nof people figuring [ __ ] out on your own\ngo back to the beginning of the stream\nand then listen to Coco's first\ninterpretation that I even pointed out I\nwas like I didn't\ngive you any that [ __ ] man that all came\nfrom you that's what happens when you\nguard constantly as people start\nleveling up it's weird yeah good luck\nyeah all right thank you\nI'd also be careful about your initial\nstatements because they're very like\njudgmental and defense provoking yeah\nyeah yeah like yeah\nyeah right like so yeah well I mean\nthink about those but I guess I guess\nI'll repeat them just like sure I'll\nclarify\n[Music]\nyeah repeat them go I don't know I guess\nlike the the like what what makes it\njudgmental I guess so so repeat what you\nsaid originally because I you know hey I\nfeel as if you're you feel like you're\ndreaming or like you're acting\ndifferently around me versus other\npeople I just want to what yeah so I\nwouldn't use the word why why invokes\ndefensive --mess so I feel like you're\ntreating me differently so I would say\nand I wouldn't make a comparison to\nother like what do you mean when you say\nlike when you say you're treating me\ndifferently from other people like that\nsmells of [ __ ] like what are you\nactually talking about like what does he\ndo\nto other people that he doesn't do to\nyou or vice versa\noh god yes like for some reason or like\nfor example like that's gonna set off\nhis [ __ ] meter does that make sense\nyeah yeah so what does he actually do Oh\nlike it's like hanging out less okay so\nI would say that right I would say hey\nman like I feel like we don't hang out\nas much as we used to and I noticed that\nyou still hang out with like a lot of\nthese other people and I'd like to hang\nout more don't cloak it in [ __ ]\nbecause that's gonna make people\ndefensive tell people what you want and\nbe transparent with that gotcha okay\ngood luck man thank you\nif it's a sheen no big deal all right\nwe're ready for round two hey man so\nyeah my question is earlier industry you\nmentioned that it's okay or it's good to\nsatisfy destructive urges and tendencies\nin video games like cocoa doesn't rust\nmy question is why is it good and is\nthere something you can learn from what\nyour tendencies are in games destructive\ntendencies and your tendencies in real\nlife like is there a correlation yeah so\nfirst of all I wouldn't say that it's\ngood so that's what I said I would walk\nthat statement back a little bit I think\nI mean I may have said it's good but I I\nthink what I was doing was wondering so\nI like I think it can probably serve\nsome purpose to have a healthy outlet\nfor some of your frustrations so let me\nput it that way but I think that the\ntricky thing about your question is you\nknow there's a difference between using\ngames as an outlet for your frustrations\nand using games as a feeding source for\nyour frustrations right like you can use\nit as a way to like decompress some\nemotion or you can use it to rile you up\nemotionally um does it does a sit\ndestructive or toxic behavior not\nreinforce that behavior in some way in\nreal life absolutely so I think it's\nlike I don't understand it very well\nmyself man to be honest like I don't\nknow but I've just noticed that like\nsometimes when I'm feeling bad you know\nit's satisfying to crush a noob on the\ninternet and like sometimes I feel\nbetter about that I think you've got to\nbe careful about letting your emotions\nout in video games which I think can can\nbe healthy and also like there's some\nkind of balance which I'm not really\nsure about about like when does that\nbecome toxicity right when I make a\nsmurf and all I do on video games is\nlike crushing noobs like that's not\nhealthy but I think occasionally\ncrushing a noob from time to time I want\nto say that that's healthy because it\nfeels so damn good\nyeah okay all right so I don't really\nknow I mean I think it's something that\nwe as a healthy gamer community should\nexplore together is it the same thing as\nthe Germantown what's it called\nschadenfreude or something yeah maybe\nbut I don't know that schadenfreude is\nhealthy to begin with right oh so just\nsomething about something about a\nspecifically Coco's case where he's like\nplaying games like rust makes me feel\nlike he has an outlet for some of those\nfrustrations that is less damaging than\nwhat he would do in the real world\nthat's just an instinct that I have and\nI want you guys to understand that like\nhalf of what I say is not substantiated\nby science or even like any kind of\nexpert opinion sometimes what I offer\nyou guys is just instincts and opinions\nthat are just mine so I don't stand\nbehind that statement it's more of a\nhypothesis that I would love it if you\nguys could explore that and like try to\nfigure out is there a good limit to it\nis there an unhealthy limit to it like I\ndon't really know it's something I'm\nreally curious about okay yeah that's\nthanks a lot man thank you\n[Music]\nready for the next Hey yes please and\nwhat am i calling you by the way lily\nmooie-mooie\nso Mui so how can you help someone with\nPTSD so I think that's a tricky question\nbecause I think you have to understand\nlike depending on what your role is you\ncan or can't help them alright so the\nfirst thing to understand is that\nsomeone with PTSD may need treatment and\nmay need like a professional therapist\nand just because you care about someone\nor just because you love someone doesn't\nmean that\nyou can actually provide them with what\nthey need right if someone's having a\nheart attack and you were to ask the\nquestion like how do I help someone with\na heart attack it's like you can do\nchest compressions but what they\nprobably need is like a medical doctor\nwe're hacking you out then find a right\nway to get that do they want to get that\nwell\ninnocent yes but at the same time\nthey're very scarce you okay so I think\nyou can start by like talking to them\nabout what they're afraid of\nright so the short answer that I would\ngive you is that you should meet them\nwhere they're at so if you have concerns\nabout them start by sharing those\nconcerns and say like hey I noticed that\nyou're suffering a lot because of this\nand this and I did some reading on WebMD\nand I'm wondering like have you ever\nthought about whether you have PTSD you\nstart with like your concerns and like\nwhy you think they have PTSD and give\nthem some chance like don't say I think\nyou have PTSD because of XYZ start by\nsaying hey I'm concerned this is what\nI've noticed and then like give them\nlike does that bother you start with\nlike a super open-ended question so what\nhave you noticed about this person that\nmakes you concerned they have PTSD well\nwhen I talked with her she used to live\nwith me here in the frost dome but she\ngot back home so her mom wanted her back\nand now she lives in a different country\nso every single time I talk with her she\nalways kind of whispers a little bit\nshe's scared of being too loud or if she\nhears a little bit of cracking like\nunder floor she stops talking like it's\nlike breathing almost like she just gets\nquiet completely sigh and and it's like\nI want to help her admit you know be\ncomfortable and not being scared and so\nshe can feel relaxed because she's a\nchild you know it's sad to see that how\nold is this person she's white teen\nyeah so I'd steer clear of the term PTSD\nokay so like if you're with a\nfourteen-year-old you also have to\nremember that like cognitively and\nemotionally like did you watch the\nstream with Koko a little bit I was very\nbusy okay\nthat that's okay so I was just gonna say\nlike if you imagine so Coco told us that\nlike him and his mom essentially ran\naway from their dad at the age of\nfourteen he and supporting a\nfourteen-year-old is very different from\nsupporting an adult so everything that I\nsay is about supporting like adults so\nwith a 14 year old I would just start\nwith something really really simple so\nthe way to support them is very\ndifferent it's just creating a safe\nspace where they can talk to you if they\nwant so I wouldn't mention PTSD or try\nto get them to do anything the way to\nsupport someone or help someone with\nPTSD is by making them feel safe with\nyou because a lot of times when people\ndeal with trauma like what they feel is\nvery alone and they feel very unsafe\nthat's why she speaks very quietly\nthat's why she doesn't you know it\nsounds like this person like stops\ntalking when they hear the floorboards\ncreak yeah she did tell me that\nyesterday when I talk protected she\nlikes talking with me and another guy\nbecause they listen to her then I think\nyou're doing great yeah I was just\ncurious on how to help her out of their\nhome and support her because yeah so so\nI think first of all you're already it\nsounds like they're supporting her\npretty well and I would you know the\nmost I would ask her and maybe you guys\ncan talk about that is sometimes I've\nnoticed that you seem pretty scared like\nyou won't speak up very much\nor you like speak very softly and then\nstart with something really really\nsimple like what do you think about that\nor do you feel scared or something who's\nsuper super super simple and then give\nher a chance to talk and if she chooses\nnot to talk that's okay you don't have\nto get her to talk so this is another\nthing that I'll share with people a lot\nof people think that helping people\ninvolves getting those people to receive\nto actually get help but remember that\nlike you know some people can be\nstruggling and it can be enough to know\nthat you care so I have you know I was\nworking with a patient of mine who was\ntrying to get one of her family members\ninto therapy and years later she decided\nto go into therapy and now years later\nthat person has come back and expressed\nso much gratitude she's like I know I\nturned you down every time you told me I\nthe therapist but it actually like\nreally mattered to me that you cared\nenough to keep mentioning it to me\nand I know I got frustrated with you and\nI know that I got angry with you but\nlike it's really nice to know that like\nyou you knew that I was feeling like\nalone and you tried to help it's kind of\nlike you know if you invite someone over\nfor like you know let's say you have\nlike you're having people over you're\nhaving a party and you may have one\nfriend that you invite over all the time\nand they always say no even though the\nperson doesn't come it can still feel\nreally nice to be invited and be wanted\nyeah thank you and so a lot of times\nwhat happens is when we think about\nsupporting other people we think about\nwhether our support lands in a\nparticular way so you can think like oh\nthis person never comes over I should\nstop inviting them and instead you\nshouldn't stop inviting them you should\nkeep on inviting or even just have a\nconversation with them say hey by the\nway I've noticed like I've invited you a\ncouple of times and like I know you've\nbeen busy or whatever do you want me to\nkeep inviting you and then they're gonna\nsay yes or no and then you just keep\ndoing it but you don't you maybe have\nlike like other than support her like\nthat maybe make the Calgary get out of\ntheir innocence yeah I mean I think that\nhas way more detail than I can kind of\noffer right so the question is what is\nher situation what is wrong you know\nwhat are her resources what are her\noptions so I think you know really like\nit's like I mean you may be able to do\nsomething on all of those fronts but not\nknowing more about the situation I can't\nreally say what I can say is that\nsupporting even though it doesn't create\na whole lot of change can count for a\nlot like I literally have patients that\nI see in my office that the reason that\nthey don't care they don't commit\nsuicide is because they have one friend\nwho keeps on inviting them to parties\neven though they never go like all it\ntakes is one person to care about you\nfor you to like feel like there's hope\nand\nthat's true that's very true I I know\nthat already that that's what I was I\nwanna do to her it was this I don't mean\non the professional anything and I don't\nwanna give her any wrong advice I don't\nwant to make her think something there's\nwrong and I don't I don't want it to get\nhurt because she is a kid and it's\nreally hard for a kid to go through all\nthat kind of trauma so that is exactly\nwhat I would say to her what you just\nsaid is like hey like I know that I I\ncan see that your life is hard right now\nor I'm thinking your life is hard right\nnow and you can even tell someone like\none of the nicest things that you can\never say to someone is I want to help\nyou and I don't know how like see we get\nso concerned about how to help people\nyou're like how do I support her\nsupporting people is not about the house\nit's about wanting to in the first place\nthat make sense I guess yeah it's\nbizarre you know just having her know\nthat you're there and you want to\nsupport her and then she'll guide you\nright if you say I want to help you and\nI don't know how she'll say actually\nthis is enough like it's just nice to\nhave someone to talk to\nshe's probably gonna say something like\nthat cuz she's 14 and she's not gonna\nunderstand her own feelings thank you\nand so then if she says it's nice to\nhave someone to talk to\nthen you know that your duty is to be\nthat person for her to talk to don't\nguide her just be a space that she can\ncome to and feel safe okay and then when\nshe's ready to make a change she'll let\nyou know sorry I keep talking over you\nit's like anyway I can't thank you I'm\nsorry she just always let her like if\nshe like she always says that when she\nlike she wanted to tell me about\nsomething to happen with her mom or\nsomething she did to herself she want me\nto read something part of her diary\nwhere she's like talking bleep\nspecifically about really scary details\nabout what you want to do and and I was\njust curious what do I do if that\ninformation she just listen to it should\nI call something what should I do with\nthat I mean if you're concerned for her\nactual like life or safety you can\ndefinitely call someone like that's\nsomething you should do I'll you know\nlike if you're concerned for her like in\na physical sense like if\nit's like you know if there isn't like\nan imminent threat\nyou can always encourage her I mean I\nwould in any way I would encourage her\nto speak to a professional\nso she's hopefully yes so you can even\nstart with someone that she knows so\ninstead of telling her to see a\ntherapist you can tell her like to talk\nto her pediatrician yeah I wanted her to\ndo that but the thing is her mom keeps\ncoming into picture up if she calls her\ncrazy if you want to do that and then\nshe gets she goes I mean she's gonna see\nher pediatrician at some point anyway\nright no okay\nyeah so I think a lot of these like come\ndown to the detail of the situation I\nthink the takeaway though is that it\nsounds like you're actually doing a\npretty good job of supporting her and\nthen maybe try to like just continue to\ntalk to her and give her a space for her\nto listen for you to listen and for her\nto speak and then you can
