    "transcript": "right do you like see how that if I'm\ntrying to make something happen I'm the\none who's exerting the power you presume\nthat you have the control to make\nsomeone love you otherwise you wouldn't\n[ __ ] do it you actually have the\ncontrol they don't have the control what\nyou're terrified of is giving them the\ncapacity to not love you do you see that\nthe control is actually in your hands\nnot in theirs and that's why it's so\n[ __ ] frustrating because the control\nisn't actually in your hands but in your\nmind that's what you're trying to do\nlike just think about it for a second\nI'm trying to make someone love me I\ncan't do that\nI have I would screen share my desktop\nbut I have deep brocco lactic as well I\njust picked that up like a week ago\nGalactic's a lot of fun man yeah how are\nyou where are you handling kovin um it's\ninteresting because like I feel like I\nsaw a lot of this like coming not kovat\nspecifically but I just knew there was\ngonna be some type of scenario that was\ngonna be kind of like catastrophic if\nthat sounds weird I kind of just yeah\nI've felt that way for a while and so\nlike when this finally happened I wasn't\nvery surprised and I don't know I didn't\nit wasn't really any shock for me kind\nof like when it went along with it just\nfine I'm introverted as is so I don't\nhave a problem with not leaving the\nhouse for extended periods of time so I\ndon't know things that other people\ndon't know\nmm I think I pick up on things that\nother people don't pick up on the clues\nare all there just some people can't\ninterpret them I feel like so you were\nfeeling like you kind of had a sense\nthat something was gonna happen and that\nwas sort of based on logic\ninterpretation of information and kind\nof subconscious processing I are they\nboth Lee without getting too political I\nwas just looking at the state it's like\nwhere we're going as a country got and\nyeah it's just like so you're not like a\nseer no no no no no that's this pointing\nI mean there is definitely like a vibe\nthat I felt but but I definitely tied it\nto like logic and reason right I would\nyou why'd you type to logic and reason\nwhy do I attach it to a logic why do you\ntell why do you tie your vibes to logic\nand reason Oh\nnote the the I know what you're saying\nyou know the chicken didn't come before\nthe egg usually so I don't like to say\nthat I justify the way I feel with logic\nsure but but the problem I don't know I\nokay well I could be wrong we're getting\nso maybe we can circle back to that yes\nhmm yeah so sometimes I think just I'll\nkind of share one or two thoughts about\nthat I think we underestimate where our\nsources of knowledge like where we get\nknowledge from and yeah I feel like I'm\naware of like being skeptical of where\nI'm pulling my information from cuz I'm\nvery I feel like I have a lot of like\nmeta thinking that I've kind of like had\nfor a very long time which I'm huh kind\nof ties into like anxiety and everything\nthat I heard I feel with people but I\njust feel like I'm picking up a lot of\ninformation that a lot of other people\ndon't in usual situations yeah so I just\nthink it's interesting that we default\nto assuming that we're picking up that\ninformation through things logic where\nactually that in and of itself is not\nlogical right that we attribute the\nsources of information to things like\nrationalization or subconscious\nprocessing but like what is that how do\nwe observe some conscious process\nexactly yeah and that's I feel like\nthat's exactly what I was trying to say\nis that I can't I am very open to the\nidea of like where my being a seer sure\nright anyway yeah so what are we talking\nabout today oh gee um so I know that the\nsex Edition is probably gonna be like a\nbig thing on the hot list smoking\nmarijuana I definitely want to touch on\nthat but I don't know there's a lot of\ndifferent things that I have going off\nwith me my but basically I've been like\ndepressed for like the last I'd say at\nleast three or four years and and\neverything is kind of tied together I\nused to have a really good sense of\nself-worth okay I feel like that got\ndeteriorated over time from\nkind of going through these relationship\ncycles okay\nevery single time I went through like\none of these little relationships and\neverything like that it would kind of\njust fire all the control afterwards if\nthere was like a breakup or whatever I\nkind of I kind of noticed that I'm going\nthrough these patterns what's the\npattern get into a relationship invest\nemotionally very deeply after that's\ndone like that if we go our separate\ndecided to be to say that I'm kind of a\nvery emotional person\nwhat's contradictive about that because\nusually with people who are like the I\nfeel like the stereotype for someone\nthat's like very promiscuous or it could\nbe interpreted as promiscuous could be\nlike they're very callous they don't\ncare about people's connections or what\nthey're doing to the people around them\nI feel like I'm very very focused on the\nconsequences of my actions\nall the time so sounds exhausting\nit is and I can't really turn it off\nvery well what do you mean it serviced\non the consequences of your actions\nhelp us understand so I feel like from a\nRick a really early age I I saw like the\neffects of like like basically going\nthrough your life without analyzing or\nbeing aware of like the the things\nyou're doing to the people around you I\nI had like my father was kind of\nbasically the model of like what I\ndidn't want to become how so well okay\nso my my dad and my mom were never\nmarried I'm from a military family so\neveryone is in the Navy my mom wasn't a\nNavy my dad was in a Navy my stepdad was\nin the Navy but\nway they they basically met didn't you\nknow didn't get married or anything like\nthat my dad like got dishonorably\ndischarged from the military for drugs\nback then it was like he was on the\nhospital floors he was a nurse as well\nbut I think he was like doing liquid\ncocaine but anyway blog story sure he\nwent through like rehab and everything\nlike that and my mom got pregnant with\nme and then he left and did his own\nthing and it's kind of left us you know\nto our own devices over the years and so\nand so I kind of just kind of wanted to\nmake sure like I always took into\naccount other people in my life so I\ndidn't want to become like him and what\nis he like um so I would characterize my\ndad is being kind of scared of his\nemotions and probably good at ounce of\nlike some toxic masculinity thrown in\nthere I feel like he's done a lot of the\nsame mistakes that I've made in my life\nbut like he was not aware enough to\nrealize what he was doing and so that\nnow his life has kind of come back full\ncircle and these things that he's done\nin the past they're kind of like\nstarting to haunt him I feel like he's\ngetting older and I think he's kind of\nrealizing that so og you said that you\ndidn't want to be like him why write\nabout him did you know well I didn't\nwant to not take into account other\npeople's lives that I'm ruining like so\nruin me basically my mom's been like\npretty scarred from it from like four\nshe's still like you know like you can\nsee certain things about people that\nchange over time and like obviously I\nwasn't alive to see the change but like\nI know it's affected my mom very\nprofoundly and then like what does the\nfact of your mom very profound it's just\nI feel his disregard for taking to\naccount like other people's feelings I\nshouldn't do that by just carrying only\nabout himself being selfish I don't know\ndoes that look like so you're giving me\nconclusions all right you're saying like\nhe didn't care about people's feelings\nbut I'm like what how do you how do I\nknow like what did he do or not do right\nright so I mean okay so the relationship\nmy mom did everything for my dad like\nreally took care of him when everyone\nelse kind of abandoned him is that what\nwas going on in his life that everyone\nabandoned him basically getting\ndishonorably discharged from the\nmilitary\nit was pretty scandalous everyone that\nhe was on the floor with that was in on\nthem passing out drugs on the hospital\nfloor basically went to like federal\nprison except for him and I have\nsuspicions that maybe I don't know that\nhe didn't go to then he didn't go to\nfederal prison because he bribed people\nout or something is that one of the\nthings that you also don't want from him\nyou don't want to be a rat oh I don't\nparticularly care about that facet of it\nand so after he was dishonorably\ndischarged how did he meet your mom wait\nhe didn't know your mom already at that\npoint yes no no no they were together\nwhile they were in the military and like\nthey weren't married but that happened\nyou're gonna have to excuse me I'm like\nI'm really like jittery right now I'm\nkind of like really really nervous I\ndon't know if you can tell yeah we can\ntell help me understand yeah why do you\nfeel nervous what do you think is going\non well let's try what do you feel just\nuh well it's just a lot of pressure just\nthe topic and this the whole thing is\nkind of helped me understand what\npressure you feel um I worry about\ntalking this openly about these very\nintimate\nin my life and I worry about it coming\nfull circle obviously I'm not using my\nbut like I'm a I am a nurse and so like\nI've just you know my interactions with\nthat the community is interesting I\nlosing my license or you know just\nappearing to be so dysfunctional in a\nway that like it they could come and\nhaunt me essentially I understand that\nyou're afraid and I'm wondering whether\nmaybe the first thing that we should do\nis help you with that fear right because\nI'm in auditioning i I don't want you to\nbe like like keeping this fear at bay\nover the course of the next hour sure\nlike I just don't think like that's good\nthat sounds like it's painful to me and\nI don't want you to suffer\nsure and and so is it okay if we try to\nkind of address that for a moment okay\nso the first thing is how would talking\nlike this how would this lead to losing\nyour license um I don't know this is\nmarijuana it gets involved like things\nare very very in the gray area as far as\nlike what can be done legally sure to\npeople you know and so maybe we\nshouldn't talk about marijuana sure\nthat's fine too\nwould you would that how would that help\nyour fear if at all\nwell I still want to talk about things I\nthink I'm just trying to I'm getting\ncomfortable at all it's just um I think\nthat as we go on I'll get more\ncomfortable yeah yeah but dude I don't\nwant you to lose your license because\nyou came on stream like that would be a\nroyal [ __ ] right now so just context\nlike I I'm at a point where I'm pretty\nmuch a I I don't care anymore so it's\nI'm moving into a different career just\nthat sounds really bad I'm I'm in\nactively a full-time student in college\nright now just moving towards a\ndifferent career and that's for a\ndifferent there's like yeah there's a\nlot going on in my life\nit's there's a lot so it sounds like\nyou're pretty overwhelmed and you're\ndealing with a lot yeah is it too much\num I would say so what makes it feel\nlike it's too much I feel like I can't\nget ahead I I feel for like every feel\nlike I'm treading water and I'm going\nnowhere and I'm getting tired of\ntreading water not in the the I know how\nthat sounds but like I don't feel like\nI'm getting anywhere all the I just feel\nlike all the advantage and disadvantages\nare weighted against me\nsure I mean the way I live right now is\nnot ideal I'm living in like a five not\neven five hundred square foot like\nstudio apartment with my mom and like my\ncats dying\nI can't Scott cancer\nyeah\nis everything it's just very hard right\nnow and like it sounds really bad but\nlike this Kovach thing is just like I\ndon't even like that I don't even feel\nlike that's even messing with me like\nI'm just dealing with all these other\nthings that have gone on with my life\nlike I lost I don't know I've lost a lot\nand this is like basically what a lot of\nmy problems with sex and everything\ncomes from this because once I get into\nthese these spirals like I get to a\npoint where I just don't care to what\nI'm doing to the people around me um and\nthen you become like your dad\nyes and so there's a lot of\nself-loathing that goes with it because\nyou're becoming the very thing that you\ndon't want to be yes you don't want to\ndo what other people what he did to you\nand your mom yes and you can't stop nope\nyou know this is gonna sound kinda\nrandom but maybe I'm trying to cut the\ntension a little bit because I can see\nyou're Stern I wonder what it feels like\nto become a vampire what kind of vampire\nthe Bram Stoker vampire or are we\ntalking like Twilight vampire I wouldn't\nwant to be a twilight vampire vampire\nbut I mean what I'm hearing you say oh\noh gee is that your ear you can feel\nyourself becoming a monster\nyes and you can't stop the\ntransformation yeah I I really do like\nit sounds really weird but I I try my\nbest to be the best person that it can\nbe and I feel because I don't know I\nfeel like I'm working against that and\nso like again feeds into that that\nself-loathing\nyou're working against what being that\nI'm working yes yeah okay sorry what I'm\nseeing from you og is that you know I\nthink you seem exhausting to me yes yep\nand you say you've been depressed for\nthree or four years I mean I'm sure that\na psychiatrist somewhere could diagnose\nyou with depression but what it feels\nlike is that you've been fighting for a\nlong time and you're just getting worn\ndown yep and it can be very very hard to\nfight and struggle and get up every day\nand try to shift the mountain of\n[ __ ] that your life has become and\nwhat I'm envisioning is a guy who wakes\nup every day walks outside of his house\nor 500 foot studio apartment with living\nwith your mom and outside your door is a\ngigantic mountain and then you do your\nwork for the day which is pushing\nagainst the mountain yep trying to get\nit to move and then after a day of\npushing and pushing and pushing in the\nmountain not going anywhere you go back\nto your 500 foot studio apartment where\nyou live\nyour mom and you go to bed and then you\nwake up the next day and then you walk\noutside and you start pushing against\nthe mountain and it's not right it seems\nlike an exercise in futility it seems\nlike there are parts of you that say\nthat you have to try you have to change\nyou have to do better you have to do\nmore and then you walk outside and\nthere's just this [ __ ] mountain\nsitting there and you know that you have\nto move it and so you start pushing and\npushing and pushing but it doesn't go\nanywhere and you feel stuck and you feel\nlike you're not making progress but you\ndon't want to be the guy who gives up\nbecause your dad did that too\nyep and that's I feel like that's a big\nproblem that I have is I can't let go I\ncan't let go of things it's really hard\nfor me too what is it that you feel like\nyou should let go what is it that you\nhold on to I feel like sometimes like I\nfeel like I need to be able to give up\non things that I'm working on like I\nwish that I could give I know it sounds\nreally cathartic or like saying uh well\nbut I mean I wish that I could give\nmyself a break but you know I'm not\nquite sure how important this is oh gee\nbut you make a lot of comments about how\nway how the things you say sound a\ncertain way have you noticed that yep I\ndid now you pointed it out I do notice\nit now yeah what do you think is up with\nthat\nwhy would you need to tell us that what\nyou're saying is not cathartic because\nthat's basically what you're doing I\nhave this bad habit of always trying to\nbe in other people's heads bad eyes all\nthe time\nokay so that's fine but why is it\nimportant for you to correct the\nperception than other people have\nI yeah I don't want to be seen a certain\nway I I feel like I'm very probably way\ntoo much in tuned with caring about what\nother people think yeah how do you want\nto be seen today you know I'm to the\npoint where I don't want to focus on how\nI want to be seen I just care about how\nI want to see me because that's I feel\nlike that's what matters how do you see\nyou exhausted yeah pretty bad person are\nyou a monster I I wonder like it makes\nme think like with everything that's\nhappened to me that like I wonder if\nthere's like a breaking point and every\nperson and it doesn't matter it's just\nacross the board I wonder if there's\nbreaking points and people where it\ndoesn't matter like there's a point at\nwhich everyone cracks are you broken um\nI don't know I keep on breaking over and\nover again so I don't know if there's a\nstate of it I don't know what's the\noriginal thing to get put back in\ntogether\nyeah I mean you're laughing about that\nbut that sounds [ __ ] terrifying to me\nyeah you know what I'm hearing is a guy\nwho's been broken time and time and time\nagain to where like you know the first\ntime something breaks you can take the\npieces and you can kind of like fit and\nback together right yep but what I'm\nhearing from you is that you've been\nshattered beyond all recognition like\nliterally that's what you're saying that\nyou've been broken so much that we don't\neven know what you're supposed to be\nanymore\nyeah maybe\num sorry I have my sense of humor is a\nlittle off good I'm glad so it's how I\nwon in one bright point I've seen so far\nactually there are a lot of bright\npoints about you but it's the one that\nthe it's the easiest to pick out so tell\nus about this whole cycle about\nrelationships and getting into a\nrelationship and investing emotionally\num I I think I just give my all that's\nit like that's the best way I can\ndescribe it is I just I I feel almost\nlike powerful when I'm in relationships\nbecause I feel like I could do anything\nthat I was ever required to do to make\nthings work like in like for example one\nof my relationships I stopped what I was\ndoing I dropped out of college well I\ndidn't drop out of college but long\nstory short I was I had a really shifty\nliving situation with with my friends\nbut they blew our rent money on drugs\nand so we were getting evicted and so I\nwas talking to this one girl and she\nsaid to come to Tennessee and that you\nknow I could live with her and it would\nbe great and that I can go to school\nover there and so I dropped everything\nI've sold like everything I could to fit\neverything in my car went across the\nnation to try and make things work and\nafter like two and a half years of like\ntoiling out in the Sun doing manual\nlabor to like make things work it didn't\nwork out and it's ironic because I I'm\nstill in touch with that woman and the\nshe had the exact same thing happened to\nher or it's actively going on and so\nit's it's weird I don't look at the\nexact same thing where you're in a\nrelationship with someone where you love\nthem and they could care less so used so\nI wear in this relay you said that last\nlast I understood you moved across the\ncountry to be with her for Tennessee\ny'all were together for two and a half\nyears I didn't hear anything you were\ndoing manual labor out in the Sun and I\ndidn't hear anything about love like one\nperson loving and one person not caring\nI mean I loved her and I was willing to\nwork as hard as I could to make things\nwork but I it's like a tug-of-war where\nsomeone's not pulling on the other side\nif you don't have that tension things\njust fall apart like like I put in this\na much effort you reciprocate you should\nat least match my effort it was always\nlike a black hole of me throwing\nemotional investment just into whatever\nyou know it is so why were you guys\ntogether for two and a half years then\num well things were okay in the\nbeginning there was a point of which you\nknow there was tension on that rope that\nmetaphorical rope and you know she tried\nand I tried and you know things were\nfine and as time went like to keep\nthings short and brief like I'm very one\npolitical or I'm of one political\nmindset and she's of the other and that\ncaused a lot of friction so and then\nyeah okay so the first thing is I don't\nthink you necessarily need to keep\nthings brief okay right so so like and\nbecause let me just explain to you for\nexample why I'm a little bit curious\nabout the situation because on the one\nhand you say that there's kind of this\nrelationship of you throwing love into a\nblack hole you're not being reciprocated\nand on the other hand I'm hearing that\nlike essentially the source of y'all's\nproblems is a political disconnect yeah\nbut there was a lot that happened\nbeforehand\nI sorry I'm like I was very\nself-conscious about time I to go into a\nlittle bit deeper so she had a really\ntraumatic experience growing up she\nshe you know she had basically got raped\nand she imprinted a lot of the things\nlike she would have flashbacks and then\nshe would imprint essentially that\ntrauma on to me so like that resulted in\nlike a whole bunch of number of weird\nwonky things having to be done and\nworked within the relationship like what\nlike basically we just didn't have sex\nanymore because she imprinted those\nexperiences on her onto me and like I\nwas like okay that's fine\nwe we won't have sex anymore but I was\nlike that\nI was so willing to keep the\nrelationship like alive and yeah and I\ndon't know the point at which like she\nstopped caring but like that's basically\nwhen things got really bad because once\nwe broke up\nI know I'm hopping around a lot there's\njust so much towards the end I was still\nin nursing school and I had like six\nmonths left of nursing school and she\ndecided to still see other people while\nwe were still living together and\nso it was really hard I I finished\nnursing school I passed I did my boards\nuh-huh but that's a blanket man it was\nit was really hard was it when fully\nactive with the people she was seen\nwhile y'all were living together yes and\nlike that was the most frustrating thing\nabout it because that scenario like\nfrustrating in that there the thing that\nI can't stand the most is when like\nhypocrisy and like I will hold myself to\nlike a huge high standard to make sure\nthat I am NOT a hypocrite and anything\nthat I try to anyway so yeah like\nessentially she had told me that this\nexperience in her life and affected her\nin such a way that she couldn't have sex\nwith me anymore\nand there was this disconnect and that\nshe was seeing other people\nhey in the house or whatever and like\nI'm still living there and then be like\nit kind of just feels like why would it\nbe acceptable to see other people in\nthis way when this is the dynamic that\nyou like I don't know it I wasn't my fit\nfeel that she isn't having sex with you\nwhen y'all are together and she's right\nthat was it was [ __ ] awful\nthat's it and like that went on for six\nmonths I would be like on the phone with\nmy my best friend at the time like day\nin day out just like in tears it's like\nthis is [ __ ] terrible like but I got\nout of it I think someone feels about\nthemselves after an experience like that\nI feel like [ __ ] and like I think that\nlike well I know personally that my\nself-worth was severely damaged from\nthat experience and because it calls\ninto question for me like what I put up\nwith and what I didn't have to put up\nwith\nand that I didn't advocate for myself\nand a way to protect myself and so I\nshould've oh gee you're doing two things\nright one is that that hurts your\nself-worth because I can imagine that\nyou're kind of feeling like what's wrong\nwith me right like why is this woman\nlike who I'm giving so much into the\nrelationship and she's not willing to\nhave sex with me because of this made-up\ntrauma [ __ ] and I'm hyper I mean I\nhave no idea what was real and what\nwasn't or anything I'm not saying that\nshe wasn't right traumatized but I can\nimagine that if I were in your shoes I\nwould feel like something about that is\n[ __ ]\nright so I think you call it ever\naccuracy my mind formula formulates that\nas something that's coroner quote made\nup which is unfair but it's an emotional\nthought it's not a rational one right\nlike I mean it just sounds like [ __ ]\nso you feel bad about yourself right so\nlike what's wrong with you and then you\ndo something else which is that you beat\nyourself up for feeling bad about\nyourself right there's a difference\nbetween self-loathing and lack of\nself-worth does that make sense\nyes I feel like I have both going on no\nno you have bought into the other yep\nvery good right so in terms of your\nfeeling overwhelmed so og let me just\njump in for a second okay so first of\nall I think you can get better and I\nthink that I think that the mountain\nthat you're trying to move you're\nactually making forward progress like\nwhether I just don't think that you're\nable to perceive it right now so what\nI'm hearing is a guy who's actually\nincredibly resilient incredibly strong\nincredibly smart and incredibly\nreflective I'm hearing someone who I'm\ntalking to someone who I think is mortal\nwho cares about other people who wants\nto be a good person and not out of\nselfishness but like genuinely like\nwants to be like good and successful in\nkind other people and wants to be like a\nforce of like good and positivity in in\nthe P\naround him yes and yes that's who you\nare right and I think some things are\ngetting in the way of that and and our\ngoal here is like so the tricky thing\nthere is that it's hard to reconcile\nbeing that person with hating yourself\nlike that's that's the real rub it's\nlike there's some there's a part of you\nthat feels like you're a piece of [ __ ]\nand hates yourself because of it and\nthen there's a part of you that strives\nto be better and like wants to be a good\nperson and actually you know goes bends\nover backwards to accommodate people\nthat you care about and really just\nprolongs what sounds like in some\nsituations like sort of toxic kind of\nthings which we can think about right so\nso in in a bizarre way oh gee I think\nthat you're somewhat responsible for\nyour circumstances which is sort of a\ndouble-edged sword so I think a big\nproblem that a lot of people have is\nthat they don't like you know you kind\nof say when you when you look outside\nyou said something about that the\nadvantages and disadvantages are stacked\nagainst you so that sort of makes sense\nand can be comforting in some way\nbecause it's like not our fault but it's\nalso kind of like doesn't give us a road\nforward because then like what do we do\nabout that right if life is just [ __ ]\nyou over then like you can't really do a\nwhole lot about that but yeah go ahead\num and so like that's a dynamic that\nI've been having to deal with it's like\nI I so like to add to that stack of\n[ __ ] like I lost pretty much two of\nmy best friends at the beginning of the\nyear just to get that's like a whole\nnother thing but um how did you lose\nyour best friend how does one lose the\nbest friend um essentially like they got\ninto it a friend group that didn't\nreally care for me and I sent like I've\nknown these people for like one of them\nI knew for I've known over for 15 years\nand the other one I've known him but I\nwasn't friends with him until about like\nfive years\nand I've known him for 15 years - and\nlike the reason why I feel like I'm very\nhyper concerned about what other people\nthink of me is because I've I lost two\nof my friends essentially and two\npossibly like the circumstances that I'm\nin and I can't like I don't feel like\nthey understand or feel the like the\nweight of everything that's going on in\nmy life and they all they see is dude\nthat [ __ ] you know is staying with\nhis mom and you know not gonna go\nanywhere you know that's a that's a real\nfear for me they abandoned you because\nyou're a loser sure that's yeah I mean I\nwouldn't put it so harshly but yeah yeah\nthat embodies the idea perfectly though\nyeah I mean that's what I'm hearing you\nsay you're just saying it in more words\nyeah so oh gee I mean I'm kind of\nnoticing a pattern here it sounds like\npeople yeah people suck my interactions\nwith people that's yeah I usually feel\nlike I have like a an interaction where\nI'm giving a lot and never receiving\nyeah\nso let's stand about that for a second\ngo ahead sorry and that kind of ties\ninto a lot I I might be like assuming a\nlot but I'm positive that probably feeds\ninto like the behaviors I have around\nlike sex what are some of those\nbehaviors\num\nI'm trying to think of where to start so\nme being a person that's very very\nconcentrated on like consequences of my\nactions I'm having to deal with feeling\nlike what are the behaviors oh it's just\nok actual verbs of what I'm was\nbasically going on is just like ace I'm\nusing okay I'm using four different\ndating apps widely technically five if\nyou conclude if you include Facebook's\ndating services and I'm basically\napproaching it like a salesman\napproaches like leads and sales while\nusing like a law of averages just to try\nand you know basically go through five\ndifferent apps and go for a numbers game\napproach rather than actual and\nemotional and what are you looking for\num anything anything something is better\nthan nothing\nis basically what it comes down what are\nyou getting what am I getting um I'm\ngetting interesting like interactions\nwith people I would never normally\ninteract with I'm getting sex I'm\ngetting like an emotional temporary like\nan emotional band-aid I feel like it's\nthe best way to describe it\nso what happens when you have sex it\nit's basically a different form of drug\nfor me my problems\ntend to just evaporate out of my head\nand I don't think about those things\nanymore and I'm kind of free for that\ntime and that that's kind of the reason\nwhy I smoke so much is that it puts me\ninto like a mental state of which I\ndon't feel burden\nanxiety or like the pain of like\neverything that's going on around me\nis that why you consider yourself\naddicted to sex no it's the the\nfrequency it's the number of people and\nit gets very out of hand the worse\nthings are for me and that given the\nsituation so like like the relationship\ncycles\nand everything that I go through it gets\nparticularly bad can you walk\nso when I went to Tennessee and that\ndidn't work out and you know [ __ ] was\nhitting the fan and I was in nursing\nschool and like everything was just like\nputting that downward force on me like I\nhad to just have some type of like\nescape and so again like I know anything\nfrom everything okay I felt like I just\nneeded to be away from so I'm in my\nsecond okay sure so I want you to I want\nto explain to you why you're trying to\nmove mountains so what are you explore\nare you running away from what hailey\nno no [ __ ] don't try to be Freudian I'm\nasking you I asked you like what were\nyou trying to get away from him what was\nyour answer everything okay\nhow do you fix that fixing my\ncircumstances around me no I'm asking\nyou how do you fix everything oh let's\nsay I come to you oh gee and I'm your\nfriend I'm the one best friend that\ndidn't abandon you I'm gonna say oh yes\nmy life is falling apart what do you say\nI don't know how can I help\nwhat's going on well so what's going on\nis everything is going wrong yeah it\ndoesn't sound like you're very you know\nyou can help by fixing everything can\nyou help me fix everything\nno I see what you're saying what am i\nsaying that I need to if I want to make\nchange in my life I needed to approach\nit in a systematic way an organized way\ninstead of just saying everything is\nwrong there there's no way to solve\neverything I need to actually probably\nmaybe have a plan of attack\nmaybe sure so I think you're even you're\nyou're moving you're moving way too fast\nbuddy\nyou're on the highway already so I'd say\nthe first thing is like if you're even\nmoving one step ahead of where I am so I\nthink the first thing to understand is\nthat like if you're if everything it\nlike so if we just listen to what you've\nsaid today\nokay your cat has cancer you live in a\nstudio apartment you're addicted to sex\nyou're making a career change so\nobviously something with the nursing was\nnot working out yeah that was a whole\nnother story to the shirt yeah so so and\nwhat what you feel is overwhelmed right\nbecause every dimension of your life\nyou're getting [ __ ] like your friends\nare abandoning you your cat is dying you\nknow interesting that you chose to be a\nnurse with all this business with your\nfather and and I don't even know what's\ngoing on there yeah yeah they're\neveryone's nurses in my family yeah my\nstepdad my mom and my dad we're all\nnurses it's like I don't know it felt\nlike can I keep talking yes yes sir I'd\nlike you to just try to listen if that's\nokay so I think the issue here is that\nlike when you look at your life I think\nit makes sense because you look at your\nlife and you see a life where they're\nlike there's like good evidence that\neverything around you is kind of falling\napart but the challenge is that like\neverything is not something that you can\nfix right so like I understand that\nyou're talking about a plan of attack\nwe're not even there yet let's first\nunderstand that the reason that you\ncan't move a mountain is because you\nyou've made a monolith of all of your\nproblems and so no wonder because like\nyou wake up every day in your mind ask\nto self the question okay what's wrong\nbecause that's what our mind does our\nmind tries to help us out and then your\nmind is like well everything is wrong\nso there's the problem-solving part of\nyour mind that's like okay oh gee what's\nwrong and then oh gee says everything is\nwrong and then the mind is like okay how\ndo I fix that and oh jeez like I'm not\nsure and then your mind doesn't know\nwhat to do and then then you're sitting\nwith this like sense of like\nimpossibility of like fixing everything\nin your life and then you end up coping\nright so when when anytime I see someone\nthat has multiple addictive behaviors I\ndon't think about addiction as the\ndiagnosis I think about it as a symptom\nso in your case what you're addicted to\nis avoidance right so like whether you\nget that through a substance or a sexual\nrelationship or video games or whatever\nare reading a warhammer book\nthe other tricky thing here is that like\nthere's a spectrum of something like\nwhen you when it's not that bad we call\nit coping and when it is bad we call it\naddiction but I think it's it's\nartificial that these things are binary\nit's like they're on a spectrum so the\nquestion is like what are you running\naway from and and when you say\neverything like I don't think that's\nsomething you can fix I think if you try\nto solve everything in your life and\neverything being wrong is the problem\nyou're gonna feel this way for the rest\nof your life it's an issue of conception\nof what your problems are\nand I think if the core of it is anyway\nI'm gonna pause for a second so any\nthoughts about that um I I would say\nthat that when I said everything I feel\nlike it's just the way it it's\ndescribing my feelings I feel it yes and\nlike I don't rationalize it in my head\nas like I can't win or that you know I'm\nnot attacking my problems like I can do\nsomething about this problem like I\ndon't look at it as one big giant I try\nnot to so let me jump in for sex which\nis exactly why I think a plan of attack\nis not your problem so you're saying\nthat if I'm gonna if I feel like\neverything is the problem in my head I\ndon't actually think everything is a\nproblem I recognize that my cat is dying\nI don't have friends on making career\nchanges because the interesting thing is\nthat oh gee you actually seem very\nadaptive to me right so like I think you\nthe plan of attack is actually not where\nyou're you're missing out you're saying\nyou're assuming that I'm saying you need\na plan of attack no I don't think you\nneed a plan of attack because you've\ndemonstrated so you say you kind of\ntalked about this relationship where you\nmoved across country right to be with\nthis woman you spent two and a half\nyears with her and then you described\nyou six months of a period of time where\nshe's [ __ ] other dudes and she won't\nwouldn't [ __ ] you for two and a half\nyears and the troll part of me was like\nhow the [ __ ] can you be a sex addict if\nyou\nnot having sex in a relationship but you\nknow I didn't say that right right right\nand so I mean while that was going on\nlike I was going on my little like to\ntalk back about the behaviors if I had\nto like describe like what that was like\nit was like like three days out of the\nweek I saw three different women and I\nwas just going through apps like it like\nan addict sure like that's so so my\npoint is that like so this looks like a\nbad scenario right like everything that\nI just described seems like a bad\nscenario but I actually think there's a\nlot of good stuff here so let me here\nlike this I know this is gonna sound\nweird but so the first thing is that you\nwere in a situation where you took\ndrastic changes and just didn't sit\nthere so you decided to like up and move\nand try to make something of your life\nyou moved across country you know you\nsold whatever you needed to you took\ndrastic steps I think a lot of the\npeople that watch twitch and watch our\nstream wish they could do what you did\nthey feel stuck because they're the ones\nthat don't ever move out they don't move\nacross countries they there aren't\nthey're talking to a girl but they don't\nhave the balls to actually try to make\nit work so the first thing is that\nyou're adaptive and you're willing to\nmake change which i think is a huge plus\nthe second thing is that you try for two\nand a half years to make this\nrelationship work like I know a lot of\npeople that are like I'm not gonna get\nlaid I'm done in six months right or\neven three weeks or three day night I\nreally did love her and that's like so\nwe'll get to that all that crap in a\nsecond do it my point though is that\nlike once again you're your so this is a\nguy who's adaptive willing to make\ndrastic changes willing to like it\ndoesn't give up easily right and then\nalso like even though things are really\nreally bad like manages to finish\nnursing school even though you're living\nwith someone who won't [ __ ] you and will\n[ __ ] other dudes and you mean like you\nmanaged to not drop out like what the\n[ __ ] man that's amazing\nI shall OTT of your other streams and\nlike I don't remember your guests name\nbut like I really resonated with his\nsituation and that like well I think you\nwere talking about how like there's an\ninevitable fee\nthat you're gonna run into failure right\nand I'm kind of getting in there I\nprocrastinate like sure well do terrible\nterrible and I just feel like as I'm\ngoing further in academia like I'm\ngetting that reality check the further I\ngo guys and what as if I don't change\nsomething about my behaviors I will not\nbe able to keep so so my points it no G\nabout sharing all these positive things\nis I think you actually demonstrate\nthrough your history that you're pretty\ngood at developing a plan of attack\nthat's not where your problem is so I\ndon't think your solution is to get\nbetter at a plan of attack because I\njust think just take any one thing let's\njust take the one thing about moving to\nTennessee you wake up one day and you\nrealize that you're you're drug addict\nroommates have used all your rent money\nfor drugs and you're being evicted I\nwould just fall apart and roll around on\nthe ground outside for about a few days\nbefore I even know what no what to do\nand you start plan of attack I can't\ntake all this stuff to Tennessee where\nam I gonna go what are my options okay\nTennessee there's something there that I\ncould make work I can't make life into\nlife\nlemons into lemonade right and then\nyou're like I can't take all my [ __ ]\nbecause I only have a car so I have to\nsell some [ __ ] it's not leaving on the\nside of the road it's actually some so\nyou made a little bit of money you sold\nsome stuff like there are all kinds of\nproblems you could and then you move\nacross country you move in with her\nshe has trauma okay plan of attack how\nare we gonna do that we're gonna be a\ngood boyfriend we love her we're gonna\nsupport her we're not gonna pressure and\nher into sex we're gonna try to make\nthis work plan of attack all right now\nwe're breaking up there's something\ngoing on\nshe used to be emotionally invested in\nthe relationship there's no more tension\nin the rope she's not emotionally\ninvested in the relationship things are\nnot working out we're gonna break up you\nguys break up okay now she's [ __ ]\nother dudes plan of attack what am I\ngonna do I'm gonna [ __ ] other chicks\nright plan of attack is not your problem\nyour problem is not that like this is a\nmonolith that needs to be broken down\nthere actually that's your problem is\nthat you need to change the perception\nthat everything is wrong in your life\nbecause it is the perception that\neverything is wrong in your life that is\nmaking you feel overwhelmed because\nyou're actually really good at managing\nproblems\nthat's the bizarre thing you actually\nhave a bizarre amount of forward\nmomentum and change in adaptation in\nyour life I know it doesn't feel that\nway to you but it's which is fair so my\npoint is that like this needs to start\nwith your feelings not with your attack\nnot with your actions you don't need to\nbe doing things differently you need to\nbe feeling things differently because\nyou're actually it sounds like you're\nyou manage you just manage really really\nwell man so so like and now we get to\nlike where do these feelings come from\nright so we can talk about you know the\nsex addictive behaviors and I'm sure\nthat that may be titillating but in my\nmind like I don't I don't know that like\ndiving down into the way in which you\nlike or you know on five dating apps\nlike I'm sure that's worthwhile to talk\nabout but I don't think that like\nspending an hour talking about the way\nin which you use dating apps is gonna\nhelp you yeah right\nso like if we're really here so now we\nhave a fork in the road which is like do\nwe want to satisfy the voyeurism of\ntwitch at and and you know like like do\nwe have a conversation about like how do\nyou get laid because people like how the\n[ __ ] I wish I don't find dating apps\nright listen up to it right so that's\nabsolutely a conversation that we can\nhave but I mean I think at the end of\nthe day I try to do live streaming as if\nI'm having a conversation with one\nperson and I try to help that person\nit's like my biggest question for you og\nis how many people have told you or have\ndemonstrated to you that you're not good\nenough ooh that one hurts a lot a lot I\ndon't know that feeling would definitely\ndrive deep in probably feeling like the\nway I do about my dad is definitely like\nI wasn't good enough to you know have\nthose types of like father/son\ninteractions or to have enough\nlike investment into my life that you\nknow so if you're not I want you to I\nwant to ask you something when when your\nex-girlfriend when you started to feel\nlike you weren't good enough for her\nhow hard did you try oh my [ __ ] oh [ __ ]\nno I like we tried very hard\nI don't know out okay so so how how\noverwhelmed so the the harder you tried\nif I were to draw a graph where the\nx-axis is trying hard in the y-axis\nsorry the x-axis is let me think about\nthis\nso let me just ask the question in a\ndifferent way yeah the more that you\nfeel you felt like inadequate or that\nyou weren't good enough you tried harder\nright yeah and and when you were trying\nreally really hard how overwhelmed did\nyou feel I felt like I was always like\npushing against a wall all the time\nright so like this is gonna sound really\nbizarre and I hope this makes sense your\nproblem oh gee is that you're pushing\nagainst a wall and that's futile and so\nI want you to just think about this the\nproblem isn't that you're unable like\nthe problem is it that you're weak the\nproblem is that you're pushing against\nsomething that is immovable your\nsolution is not to like get stronger so\nyou can push the mountain the solution\nis to stop trying to push them out like\nI don't know if you know how to\ntranslate that into your actual life but\ndo you see what I'm saying you're\nsetting up a situation where futility is\nthe only result but just let's just\nthink about this so you feel like you're\nnot good enough so you try extra hard\nand the harder you try the more\noverwhelm do you feel in the more\npowerless you feel the funny thing is\nthat that feeling like you wouldn't feel\noverwhelmed or powerless if you weren't\npushing does that make sense like\nthere's there's a futility like you just\nthink about this the harder you try\nyou're like giving everything and you're\ngiving everything and you're giving\neverything and nothing is working and\nnothing is working and nothing is\nworking and everything is wrong in your\nlife and there's nothing you can do and\nyou wake up every day and it's just a\nslog and you can't take it anymore\nyou've been doing this for years and\nyou've been trying and trying and trying\nand all of your effort is futile you're\nworthless it's a whole big mess of\nworthlessness and it starts with you\ntrying because just imagine this for a\nsecond if you didn't try then are your\nactions futile\nI see what do you see explain it to us I\n[Applause]\nthink what you're talking about\nis that if I set an expectation of win\nor fail if I don't have expectations of\nwinning or failing and trying is kind of\nlike implied into you know conquering\nwhatever it is that I'm trying to\napproach but if I get rid of the\nexpectation then there is no there is no\nstruggle that's not exactly where I was\ngoing from it I think this is a this is\na problem of you watching too much of\nour content it's a little bit of a joke\nso I'm glad you've learned a lot yeah\nbut I'm gonna try to I'm gonna try to\nlike actually mold it a little bit more\nwhat I or what I want you to understand\nis that you were setting up a problem\nfor yourself that you cannot win right\nsure and so like this is what this is\nwhat exhausts frustrates and makes\npeople want to give up is you set\nyourself up against an unsolvable\nproblem and then you try a lot and then\nyou like feel like a failure over and\nover again even though like the game is\n[ __ ] rigged the problem is that not\nthat life sets the advantages and\ndisadvantages against you that are like\nagainst you it's that you're setting\nyou're setting yourself up for absolute\nfailure and and the problem is that when\nyou set yourself up for absolute failure\nyou give forth absolute effort and you\nlove a hundred and ten percent and you\ntry a hundred and ten percent and you\nput up with all kinds of [ __ ] that is\nreally like unreasonable to put up with\nwhether it's like yeah I mean I don't\ndon't even get me started there there's\nall kinds of weird signs that like\nthere's just like there's a pattern of\nlike people [ __ ] you over right yes\nthe thing is like I don't think you're\nthat dumb I think it's because you set\nyourself up for people [ __ ] you over\nbecause you give in too much into the\nrelationship when you should say I\nshouldn't try to push against this wall\nanymore\nyou try to make her love you when\nthat's not something you can do right\nright I learned that yes yes but I don't\nthink you did so like you learned\nactually what you learned is that you\ncan't make her love you but you're sure\nas hell gonna try the next person and\nyou're sure as hell gonna try the next\nperson and you've been learning this\nlesson over and over and over again with\nindividual people but you haven't\nlearned it in general because you tried\nto get your two best friends to love you\nyou tried to get this girl to love you\nand you tried to get your dad to love\nyou and the reason that you try is\nbecause you're trying to get everyone to\nlove you because at the core of it you\nfeel like you're unlovable and this is\nthe thing is that has to come out root\nand stem right and I feel like a lot of\nit is like I can't love myself like\nthat's something I'm really trying hard\nto do is like have compassion for myself\nand yeah the self-loathing right so like\nnot only you're unlovable\nyou beat yourself up for being unlovable\nand all of these behaviors like do you\nsee the patterns of trying like putting\nyourself in situations where people\nessentially take advantage of you and\nthen you're like oh [ __ ] that I'm not\ngonna let these people take advantage of\nme you move across country and you let\nsomeone else take advantage of you and\nthen you're like [ __ ] that I'm done with\nthat now you're over here and then you\nlet someone else take advantage of you\nthis pattern is actually of your own\nmaking I don't think you're that unlucky\nlike this is not random chance like when\nwe see this pattern over and over and\nover again I think you're creating it\nyeah I was I feel like I was like I\ncouldn't quite I don't know it's like I\nfelt like I was responsible for a lot of\nlike I was like this can't just be a me\nthing or it them thing I should say out\nthere I'm definitely a part of this\nproblem and I just I need to figure out\nwhat exactly so yeah the question like\nso now like what I really want you to\ntunnel down is I think there are going\nto be some cases where if we tunnel down\nI would make this prediction that there\nare some moments where you feel\nunloved and someone is mistreating you\nand in that moment instead of\nacknowledging their mistreatment what\nyou do is you try to make them love you\nby like giving more yep because the\nthought of being unlovable is so\nintolerable to you because you've been\nhurt this way over and over and over\nagain that like that becomes the spot\nthat you try to protect and this isn't\nsomething you know okay I'm gonna just\nfeel it's just feelings it's cool yeah\nso like I want you guys to understand\nthis like if you have a weak point right\nlet's say I take an arrow to the knee\nand then like the next day I take an\narrow to the knee and the next day that\nI take an arrow to me what happens is I\nstart protecting myself like I'm going\nto put like armor over my knee because\nlike that's where I keep on getting hit\nright make sense\nthe problem is that the way that you try\nto protect yourself from feeling unloved\nis to put yourself in situations where\nthat are untenable and will make you\neventually feel rejected it's like\nyou're you're putting on armor that has\na bull's-eye on it right like you're\ncreating these patterns where you're\nessentially letting people abuse you\nlike over and over and over again like\nyou're creating abusive relationships\nfor yourself you're creating situations\nof abandonment what are you over and\nbest because instead of like the problem\nhere what I'm telling you og is the\nproblem is not not trying hard enough or\nnot being strong enough it's trying too\nhard it's pushing against a wall that\nyou can't move I yes and like what a\nthing that I'm afraid of too is that I\nworry about what happens when I turn\nthat engine off beautiful that's your\n[ __ ] problem that's exactly what you\nneed to do you need to face that fear\nyou need to accept that there's a\npossibility that people may not love you\ninstead of trying to control them and\nmake them love you you have to accept\nthat maybe they don't\nand this is the [ __ ] paradox thing\nthis is why Zen is so paradoxical when\nyou start doing that people will start\nloving you when you accept that people\nmay not love you and that you can't make\nthem love you when you let go of that\ncontrol and you let go of that paranoia\nand you're also going to stop tolerating\nthe abusive behavior because you're\ngoing to say to yourself okay this\nperson is not treating me right I can't\nmake them treat me right and they don't\nlove me so be it therefore I don't have\nto double down and invest twice as much\nin the relationship Oh like I'm pushing\nagainst this wall and it's not moving\nbecause it's attached to a bank and the\nbank is 500 like thousand square feet\nand it's made of brick in cement and I\ncan't push it oh maybe I should stop but\nthat's not what you do because like when\nyou feel the resistance of someone not\nloving you when that feeling of not\nbeing loved arises within you you push\nharder and harder and harder and harder\nand harder and it doesn't cause the\nmountain to move and it just leaves you\nexhausted\nI think you figured me out dr. kay what\ndoes that do for you though I figured\nyou out fantastic\nI'm gonna go have lunch now go [ __ ]\nyourself and like the problem I I feel\nlike I feel like I come to like very\nsimilar conclusions just I feel like\nyours is your conclusion is super\neloquent and like how it compasses\neverything it's just I'm like I'll get\nto the point where like okay like the\nproblem is coming from me how do I stop\nthis how do I like exactly yes so how\nwhat do you do with this man what do you\nthink it's hard I have to be like\nwilling to let go of a lot how do you be\nwilling to let go I'm gonna help you\ndon't worry my point is that everything\nup until this point is worthless without\nthe next step you get that but I've not\nhelped you 1% like helping you is gonna\nbe binary today we can go 99% of the\nroad but unless we can help you with the\nnext step this doesn't help at all\nyou with me okay like showing you what\nyour problem is like shirred good\ndiagnosis proceeds good treatment but\nlike good diagnosis with no treatment is\nworthless so there are two solutions\nokay the first thing is I want you to\nrecognize this as it's happening and\nstop pushing there are going to be\nmoments and I don't even I'm not I'm not\ngonna say they're going to be moments\nwho it cuz I just don't accept this for\na second who in your life right now are\nyou trying to win over thank you maybe\nnot good\nare you trying to win over myself it's\nlate okay I'm I don't know I'm trying\nI'm really trying not to like personally\nam I my goal well my challenge right now\nthat I'm trying to work through is just\ntrying to be independent because I've\nyou've kind of tapped into like a lot of\nmy codependency issues that I've had\nthroughout yes\nand my thing is I just want to be\nindependent\nI don't okay KITT yes I'm trying to be\nindependent how do you try so what do we\ndo what's our solution to that in that\nregard um I need some source of like\nlove that it's not coming from external\nsources like I need it correct look no\nso remember that the goal here is to\nstop trying right yes so you're trying\nto be independent so what should you do\nnot care about being independent\nabsolutely you should accept that you're\nnot ready to be independent and being\nindependent means not relying on\nexternal sources of love so what should\nyou do not care in correct\nyou should care you should rely on\nexternal sources of love whatever\ndirection you're going in your head\nright now you need to move in the\nopposite direction okay yeah because\nthis is can I just get young thing that\nI feel like I have a problem like the\nreason I feel like another thing that\nties in my self-loathing into this whole\nlittle cycle too is like hey the stigma\nof everything I'm doing but be that's\nokay if it's important it'll come back\nsure\ncontinue though I'll come back I'll\nremember it okay so like this is exactly\nmy point\nright so like like you're trying to be\nindependent and how many times have you\ntold yourself that uh like every day\nlike when are we going to like\neverything's kind of like a little bit\nof like avoidance right now yeah so when\ndid you start telling yourself that you\nneed to be independent as soon as my mom\nprobably got into the apartment that was\na correct no well it has been going on\nI'm feeling predominantly that way right\nnow\nyeah you're telling me that when you\nwere growing up you didn't have thoughts\nthat I need to get on I need to get by\nwithout my dad because he's not going\ndidn't know really right I didn't feel\nthat way as in I felt like I had to win\nhim over as in like I didn't think of\nhow do I go about my life without this\nthing I went about my life thinking how\ncan I get this thing and you also didn't\nhave I'm a little bit surprised that\nactually means I'm wrong but so but you\ndidn't you didn't eventually conclude\nthat like you need to get on without\nyour dad like he's not gonna show up and\nthat you need independence um I have\ndone a really good job of just like out\nof sight out of mind with my dad for a\nlot of years now because there was a\npoint where he is gonna be who he is and\nwhatever right so that speaks to me of\nindependence okay right so like at some\npoint you gave up on him and you decided\nlike it seems to me like you learned how\nto be independent and you had to become\nindependent because he wasn't [ __ ]\naround like he wasn't around right\nyeah anyway so I mean I think ultimately\nthat's not you know I so I have like my\nsense\noh geez that all this crap is related so\nyour desire for your independence your\ntendency to be codependent your hunger\nfor people to love you has to relate to\nlists like general ID like why do people\nneed to feel loved by other people why\ndo you need to make other people love\nyou go ahead you ever thought yes I\nremembered what I was going to say\nso like the stigma was a and then B is\njust like the way it makes me feel\nknowing that I have to approach\nsomething external and it can't come\nfrom within me like everything like\nthese these drugs like sex and\neverything like that in order to make\nmyself feel happy or content I have to\napproach something external and it can't\nsomething with it\nthis is gonna be really confusing but\nlike that is what you need to accept\nbecause I know this is gonna sound\nreally [ __ ] weird but I want you to\nreally run with me for a second okay\nokay when you make try to make someone\nlove you who is in control they are\nincorrect no okay go ahead think I'm\ngonna ask the question again when you\nmakes when you're trying to make someone\nlove you who is the agent that has power\nwhere is the action it's in my desire to\nwant to make it happen so it's yeah it's\nnot even your desire your exerting\neffort on another human being to make\nthem love you right do you like see how\nthat if I'm trying to make something\nhappen\nI'm the one who's exerting the power you\npresume that you have the control to\nmake someone love you otherwise you\nwouldn't [ __ ]\ndo it you actually have the control they\ndon't have the control what you're\nterrified of is giving them the capacity\nto not love you do you see that the\ncontrol is actually in your hands not in\ntheirs and that's why it's so [ __ ]\nfrustrating because the control isn't\nactually in your hands but in your mind\nthat's what you're trying to do like\njust think about it for a second I'm\ntrying to make someone love me I can't\ndo that but even I'm trying to make that\nimplies that like I'm trying to make a\nchair I'm trying to make a bowl of\nnoodles I'm trying to make a life for\nmyself I'm trying to make a light that\nturns on like who's in control in all of\nthose statements so this is me fighting\nagainst that metaphorical wall again yes\nabsolutely yes but the thing here is\nthat what you need to do is stop trying\nto be independent stop trying to control\nother people because that's still you\nthat's you being independent because you\nare not actually in a relationship with\nanother human being who has thoughts and\nfeelings you have all of the\nrelationship that you're bearing on your\nshoulders you're pulling the rope\nentirely there's no tension on the other\nside because you're owning all of that\nresponsibility you're taking all of that\nresponsibility and you're trying to make\nthem love you and you're pushing pushing\npushing pulling pulling pulling so much\nlove into the void do you see that it's\nall one-sided\neverything about this is one sided with\nme okay when I push against the wall\ndoes the wall push back like my physics\nbut I see what you're saying no it does\nnot it's most in your scenario it's\nmostly just me exerting effort the walls\njust being there yeah and actually if\nyou want to go like really five head you\nthrow in physics because you're right\nthat whatever you throw in no matter how\nhard you try what is the result\nyou stay the same because this\nex-girlfriend exerts an equal and\nopposite force to make sure that the\nrelationship doesn't move forward right\nso you're actually right both cases are\ntrue now we see why your life is futile\nbecause you set up this like we\nyou're you know psychophysics\nexperiment where you're exerting a lot\nof futility because you're trying to\ncontrol everything you are living in a\nworld where there is your assumption is\nthat there is not an equal and opposite\nreaction I am making her love me there's\nno agency on her her end because you\ncan't surrender the fact that people may\nnot be able to love you\nonce you surrender that people may not\nbe able to love you and furthermore that\nyou're not an island unto yourself that\nyou can't be independent right now and\nthat like I hate to break it to you\nbuddy but what you need is love like you\nget that like you need someone to love\nyou in the way that you love them yeah\nthat's the way it feels essentially yeah\nand so the like don't ignore your\nfeelings and say like just think about\nthis for a second you're hungry and\nthirsty for love you've been hungry and\nthirsty for love theoretically your\nentire life right and and and every time\nsomeone doesn't love you it hurts and so\nyou go and like the way to take someone\nwho's hungry and thirsty is we don't\ntell them you need to be independent of\nhunger and thirst like that's doesn't\n[ __ ] work man right you need to be\nloved in the way that you're gonna get\nloved is by recognizing that you can't\nmake someone love you and then you've\ngotta roll the dice and I can almost\nguarantee you that for patterns as baked\nin as yours are there's someone right\nnow in your life that you are trying to\nwin over and you do it every moment when\nyou think about how other people\nperceive you because in that moment\nyou're not letting your you're not even\nletting us judge you you're saying like\noh this like statement I know it sounds\ncathartic but it's not you're trying to\ncontrol our perception even now yeah let\nus think whatever the [ __ ] we want about\nyou let us see you for who you are and\nand be let yourself be free from the\npossibility that we think you're an\nawful person\nor that your idiotic free yourself and\nwe think you're a dumbass\ntwitch ad thinks you're a dumbass so\nwhat let go of trying to control other\npeople's perceptions let go of trying to\nmake other people love you and once you\ndo that you're gonna stop investing your\nenergy into a futile problem and if\nyou've not investing your energy in a\nfutile problem lo and behold you may\nstart investing it in things that can\nactually like start to bear fruit and\nthen like oh what the [ __ ]\nwe're actually like not treading water\nbecause we're moving in a direction the\nenergy investment of treading water and\nmoving in a direction is basically the\nsame the problem is that like you're in\nthe ocean and you found an island and\nyou're pushing against it instead of\nlike actually moving somewhere else or\nlike getting out of the water the\nanalogy is falling apart at this point I\nguess I understand that so very\nconcretely I want you to think about\nyour relationships and notice within\nyourself like when do I feel unloved\nthat's what you have to tap into I yeah\nit hits me really quickly you know I'm\nalways a big proponent of you know\nactions speak more than words and like\nthat's the first thing I look at is like\nare they behaving in a way that shows\naffection now so okay yeah so now we see\nlike why you have relationship cycles\nright because like you come in and like\nwhen you perceive an action that's an\ninsult to your like self-worth you have\nto emotionally invest to like balance\nthat I don't know if that makes sense\nbut like someone does something like\nthey don't return a text and then you\nfeel unloved and then like then the\ncycle begins and then you have to invest\nmore in the relationship because you\nhave to get them to love you and then\nthey don't return another text and then\nyou have to get them to love you even\nmore do you see that like that's the\ntrigger\nthe biggest thing is that you have to\nacknowledge like when they don't return\nthe text you have to catch it then and\nthere that sometimes people just don't\nreturn texts and it's not because like\nthere's something wrong with you but the\nproblem is that you have like been hit\nit like you have been hurt so many times\nthat your fear that you're unlovable\nstarts to see things in the shadows that\nare not there right it's like walking\noutside when it's dark outside and\nseeing a rope on the ground and thinking\nit's a snake it's an analogy that's from\nan Ayurvedic textbook that doesn't\nreally translate here because we don't\nhave snakes in America but and we do but\nanyway it's like yeah no not not in\nBoston yeah but I see so let me just be\nvery very concrete okay so the first\nthing is for you to recognize the\nfeeling of being unlocked and then\nrecognize that that feeling of being\nunloved is gonna push you to engage in\ncertain behaviors and you have to\nisolate those you have to see what they\nthose are and then the third thing is to\nrecognize that the stuff going feeding\ninto the feeling of aunt being unloved\nmay be incorrect this is a cognitive\nbias right sometimes people just don't\nreturn text that doesn't mean that they\ndon't think you're a good person\nyes yeah I I feel like I actually with\nthe example of texting I feel like I you\nknow I'll feel the emotion and I feel\nlike I'm very good about catching those\nalready because I will rationalize it\ndown and I'll address it with logic like\nno no no you know people are busy they\nhave things going on their lives that\nyou are not the center of their universe\nyou know they have you know who are you\nto them whatever you know like oh you\nwere doing great until that last\nsentence who are you to that yes you're\nunlovable to them you're not worth it to\nthem see you are not the center of their\nuniverse you were doing great\neverything was rational until that\nunlovable some scarf popped up and said\nyou are not worth their time\nyou see how that happened I hope you\nguys caught it on Twitch at first couple\nthings were rational third thought was a\nsome scarf\nthis [ __ ] is subtle in its deep my\nfriend you're doing very good but it's\nstill trickier it's trickier than you\nare I try I tried really hard to catch\nit though good and so you should keep\ntrying\ncuz it's good you you caught the first\ncouple but I'm not supposed to try\nexactly now we get to the next thing\nright which is which is when you would\ndon't actually wrestle when you\nrationalize it you don't actually deal\nwith it emotionally the question that\nyou need to ask yourself is you know\nsure you can rationalize they don't have\nyou know they can't be around all the\ntime but what does it feel like to not\nbe a priority for them and sit with that\nfeeling because then like then you throw\nyourself a pity party and like don't do\nthat like it's okay to like not be for\nsomeone's priority can I sit with that\nfeeling can I sit with the feeling that\nI don't feel like a priority to them and\nI don't want that to change my action I\nactually don't want to try I don't want\nto try to protect myself from that hurt\nbecause that's one option right I'm not\ngonna text him again [ __ ] it or I'm\ngonna get I'm gonna try to get them to\nlove me more like don't do anything just\nsit you need to not do anything notice\nthose feelings of rejection and just sit\nwith them for a while and it's gonna\nfeel bad it's like you ever cleaned out\na garbage disposal oh yes pretty mucky\nyep so like you know the feeling when\nyou first put your hand into the garbage\ndisposal where you like almost gag yeah\nand then like what happens the few\nseconds after that you're like my hands\nalready wet might as well go the entire\nyep we're right so like the first three\nseconds of putting your hand into a\ngarbage disposal or the worst part and\nthen once you're in the filth\nit's then you can then you're fine you\nget what I'm saying yes so you need to\nput your hand in the guard I mean\nobviously not way it's all on or\nanything right yeah but yeah but like\nyou need to sit in the filth which are\nnot ready to do and what you'll realize\nis like sure it's mucky but like\nafter time it's not going to be that bad\nright an acknowledge that your unlovable\nand acknowledge that you can't be\nindependent and acknowledge that in\norder for you to be healed you need to\nbe loved and then the most terrifying\nthought is that that's not something\nthat you can guarantee and understand\nthat for the rest of your life there is\na chance that when you die you will\nstill be broken and if you can do that\nthen you'll start to move forward it's\nit's really hard for me to like quit or\nlike not even quit like it's hard for me\nto give up on things like yes it's\nreally hard you're like I I teach\nmartial arts on the side\nI run a judo program at a university\nhere and like there's so much there's\nthere's so many times where I'll just\nteach hurt like I'll be hurt like I have\na grade two sprain in my left ankle\nright now and I'll still teach on it I\nhaven't teach taught recently because\nthey close down all the classes and\neverything like that because of kovat\nbut like like I'm always I don't know\nit's really there's the trying again yep\nso now beautifully said so oh gee I\ndon't know exactly what this is gonna\nlook like for you but I think what you\nshould do is notice those things about\nyourself where you don't want to give up\nand then try to give up or if you can't\ngive up then give up on giving up and at\nleast accept don't try but say like oh\n[ __ ] it this is not gonna work like I'm\na dumbass and I'm gonna teach on this\nthis messed-up ankle because I'm so\nattached to this that I'm not willing\nlike my pride is so big that I'm not\nwilling to like look feel ashamed in\nfront of people because I have an injury\nbecause I'm the teacher and I was\nsupposed to be invincible\nthat's this complex in my head and it's\ntoo big of a ball for me to restrain you\ncan do that too or you can actually sit\nout your judo class if you're injured\nthat's those are the reps that you need\nto do you need to start by giving up\nlittle little little things and it's\ngood that you notice that that's\nbeautiful so now you just like make\nyourself as best as you can not teach\nthat\npseudo-class and then give up something\nelse and then give up something else and\nthen give up something else until you\nain't doing [ __ ] until you become what\ntwitch at is just sitting around doing\nnothing all day instead of being this\ntrihard [ __ ] that you are you see\ntwitch at trying hard doesn't doesn't\npay you guys have the winning strategy\nthe the really sad and ironic thing is\nthat twitch chat tries really hard to\nthat's the problem is they try so so\nhard and then they feel overwhelmed and\nexhausted because you're trying so hard\nman and it's just not working any way\nthoughts or questions before we wrap up\nno thank you very much for having me on\nI really appreciated it I really loved\nyour insight into what's going on in my\nlife so so can you recap for us oh gee\nwhat you understood about our\nconversation today or what you think was\nrelevant or helpful\nWaku as much as you can so understanding\nI think a big thing that we talked about\nwas understanding what is futile because\nin my life like I am approaching it in\nsuch a way where I'm becoming the\nproblem because I'm not accepting that\ngiving up is acceptable to me and I'd\nlike dealing with feeling these emotions\nof not being lovable\nand then how do you like going like the\nrelationship between being unlovable and\nlike the freedom that it brings of like\naccepting that you can go through your\nlife and be unlovable but at the same\ntime like it frees you from the burden\nof trying and failing and trying and\nfailing and avoiding those cycles also\nwhat else we we went over essentially it\nlike those cycles and depth of like\nwhat's going on understanding that you\nknow someone's not going to pitch in to\nthe pot with their emotional investment\nif you're doing all the work there if\nyou're that you're you know if you're\ngonna just put fifty percent in if they\nput fifty percent in that seems pretty\nnice yeah so that's that's actually next\nlevel [ __ ] so now like I want you to\nreally think about this other\nrelationship right this two-and-a-half\nyear relationship yep I think the\nbiggest problem with that relationship\nis that you let her get away with giving\nless than 50% because you wanted the\nrelationship to work so hard that you\ngave a hundred percent and thereby you\nlet her off the hook if you want to feel\nloved and if you want a relationship to\nwork out you can't do all of the work\nyou just can't right you've got to let\nher do her part the problem is that if\nyou let her do her part\nyou're ceding control that she may not\ndo it and then the relationship could\nfail in your seating control you see\nthat yes and I it's always weird because\nI always feel like I'm never in control\nyeah and so that's thus I'm fighting\nagainst those invisible walls again\ntrying to gain back that powerlessness\nyes so you've got to let yourself be\npowerless yeah that's it's I don't know\nthere's so much other things that like\nhave contributed to like me being where\nI am absolutely yeah and like\nthe good news og is that when people\nhave problems that are everything it's\nbeen my overwhelming experience that if\nyou can you know grab this one thing\nthat a lot of things in your life will\ncome tumbling down\nin terms of barriers I've seen that yeah\nbut beautifully point yeah my whole\nthing is like I if I'm to give up I just\nwant to be able to do it with grace I\ndon't know but that's probably like ties\nit into caring what other people think\nbeautiful see now you're getting there\nyou have to give up giving up with grace\nyou have to fail like a dumbass you have\nto let yourself feel like a dumbass you\nsee like how ingrained it is every\nthought that you have this attachment is\nright behind it it's recursive man it's\nlike Inception you can go as many layers\nas you want to and like it's always\ngonna be there I want to give up with\ngrace\nI want to fail magnificently right\nbecause that yeah it's the implications\nthere it's just underneath the surface\nabsolutely yeah that's how it is good\nyeah often yeah I say things out loud\nand then I'll be like oh I didn't know I\nfelt that way well that makes sense you\nknow good that's good the other thing\nthat you can think about doing I don't\nknow if you've seen a therapist but you\nshould maybe see a therapist and talk\nabout your dad yeah that's another thing\nthat I'm dealing with too is just like\nnot not having medical insurance is\ncrazy but the university offers a a not\nfree well it is now but they were it's\nlike co-pays like 15 bucks it's nothing\nsure but we've been I'm I've already\nmade progress though you got that yeah\nbut I could focus on that next time\nso other thoughts oh gee I thought that\nwas a beautiful summary but if I mean I\njumped in there so I didn't yeah you\nshould play Final Fantasy 7 okay\nit's really really good like they've\ndone a wonderful job you can tell like\nthat's something that I really like care\nabout nowadays it's like actually seeing\neffort in video game so you can actually\nsee the effort saying you're like oh\nthere was passionate developers that\nwent into this game and you can see like\nhow passionate they were you can see\nthat in Final Fantasy 7 it's not just\nformulaic soulless cobbled together\nworks by the gaming executives but a\ngame made by gamers I'm with you dude\nfor sure yeah you got like a bad\ncorporate takeover with video games it's\npretty terrible but no that game is\nwonderful I think you'll really like it\nif you play deep rock lactic that's a\nreally fun one too yeah yeah okay cool\nman thanks for the recommendation and\ngood luck yeah and we're rooting for you\nyes sir thank you again for having me on\nI really do appreciate it Oh actually\nhold on a second let me think about\nmeditation let's do meditation I keep on\nchatter oh can I ask you yeah real quick\nso with Ayurveda so I tried taking like\na lot of the Osho quizzes and everything\nlike that and I can't really find like a\nreally good one cuz I get like mixed\nresults but like half the time I come up\nreally strong on like Vata and then\nother times I come up like predominantly\nnot pizza with the cough ah yes so I\ndon't know because the ones I've been\nlooking at lately it's been cough uh\nyeah so so do you remember it have you\nseen like any of the stuff that we've\ndone I rather did you watch the webinar\nwomen I've watched I think I watched it\npart of that I think I might watch that\none yeah so like if you guys watch that\npart of it anywhere what's your question\num what would be a good way to like\ntailor like cuz like my big thing I'm\nADHD too so it's like\norganization is really important for me\nand like I was like I've noticed there's\nsome things they're like oh that fits\nperfectly with me and like you know with\nthese you know the dough shows and\neverything like I\nother sign yeah okay yeah I'm I'm like\nfor context I'm sitting down but I'm\nlike I know that they bring in a lot of\nlike body type like characteristics into\nI'm like 6 foot 3 yep and like - yeah\nbut I'm kind of lanky at the same time\nyep yeah so for those of y'all watching\nit anyway so what's your question and\nthen before I die I just what would what\nwould you recommend as far as like cuz\nlike there's different diets that they\nrecommend I don't know like I'm trying\nto look for like a template of like how\nI can kind of organize myself yeah very\ngood so let's start by understanding\nwhat you're though shot so you have a\nvery round face and a very sharp nose\nright so you're kind of like a vodka\ncough OH which like I haven't done a\ngreat job in explaining about the\ncoupler because I kind of make them out\nto be opposites but they're not they're\njust three different axes right right so\nyou also have a very very classic story\nfor a vodka cava which is that you stay\nin relationships and bad situations for\nlonger than you need to that's your\ngoverness that's the down side of\nresilience other people would have left\nthat relationship way earlier than two\nand a half years but you have the\nstaying power to push against that\nmountain for way longer than other\npeople do and we see the botanist\nbecause you're not in a relationship for\n10 years but you have frequent cycles of\nthe same thing so you have fluctuation\nof like you find yourself in bad\nsituations very very often in in\ndifferent bad situations very very often\nso we hear that from your like story\nright like roommates and then this girl\nand then friends who abandon you and\nthen switching careers and then becoming\na nurse and then like not become like\nnow you're in school again but that's a\nwhole nother but you're not you're not\nfull hot because you actually complete\nyour nursing degree you're gonna finish\nschool like you've got you see the\ndifference like this is vodka and cava\nthere's a lot of career changes but\nthey're not half-finished career changes\nlike bizarre and people may think that\noh at least getting a nursing degree is\nbetter than not finishing a nursing\ndegree to which I would ask you like we\nremember that it's not really better or\nworse it's just like is it better to\nfully finish a nursing degree if you're\nnot going to be a nurse\nor better to abandon it and halfway yeah\nthat's a yeah so in terms of what to do\nfor hagatha I'd say eat warm foods of\nlike medium moisture make sure your\nbowel movements are somewhat regular\nmake sure you're not constipated and you\nwant them to be a little bit yeah so\nlike warm foods is the most important\nthings you want to eat things that are\nsour so sour fruits are gonna be very\ngood for you okay yeah I eat a lot of\nmango as is good just naturally so-so\nmango so actually you should do citrus\ninstead of mango so mango is kind of\ncreamy okay right so like you want foods\nthat are a little bit lighter than that\nso mango actually increases Scotland\nbecause it's like thinking creamy\npudding mango avocado these are fruits\nlike so pomegranate citrus those are\nbetter tart fruits for you okay\nberries also good\nI mean mangoes look good for you but I\nrather would say you can get a little\nbit of mileage yeah there's yeah mango\nand marijuana go together though yeah\nyeah okay so great question and then I I\nmean I need to do like more Ayurvedic\nstuff about what you guys should do if\nyou have jobs I I love it because it's\njust like I'm from the western side of\nlike the spectrum and how we like look\nat medicine and then I see the eastern\nkind of like take on it and it's not\nthat like I feel like oh this is very\nweird and abstract and it's not true I\njust feel like they have a different\ncontext of like realizing things that\nlike Western medicine want because\nthey're they can't make the same leaps\nand bounds yeah so it's just a different\nkind of setup yeah and I I appreciate it\nthough like I like the whole the system\nit's really like interesting to me\nokay I have a meditation practice for\nyou sure ah you're gonna get you're so\nscrewed okay so I don't want you to sit\nup straight all right okay it's gonna be\nso simple and so hard so sit up straight\nclose your eyes and I want you to\nobserve your breath\nso I want you to breathe three breaths\nwith full observation now as you observe\nthe breath is it changing are you\ncontrolling it\num I follow it from like my lungs and I\nfeel it pass through all my Airways I\njust feel it okay close close your eyes\nyeah so is the rate or depth of your\nbreathing changing once you start to\nobserve it are you breathing differently\nnow that you're observing it yes okay I\nwant you to stop stop changing the\nbreath just observe it without changing\nit\nbreathe exactly like you were while\nwe've been talking okay yeah all right\ndon't slow it down don't deepen it\ndon't make it artificially shallow see\nit's really it's kind of a having a hard\ntime cuz I don't know if the problem is\nI'm trying to breathe normally and I'm\ntrying something and I think that's tied\ninto this meditation technique I see\nwhat you you're doing so do it close\nyour eyes this is really hard for me\nokay\nhow's it working this is really hard\ngood that means you're doing it right\nit's it's because like the first\ninstinct I have is to think how do i how\ndo I breathe normally what is my normal\nbreath pattern like but the problem is\nit's like it's kind of like a\nSchrodinger's cat thing cuz you don't\nknow like you'll never ya know hold on\nso now let's think you're doing it right\nso now tell so what first of all what's\nSchrodinger's cat thing explain yourself\nbecause I keep on cutting you off so it\nit's like a talking about the observer\neffect in like under like they use it\nit's like an example to explain like\nquantum phenomenon or shenanigans like\nthat but essentially the the cat inside\nis in a state of like either being alive\nor dead and the observer effect is view\nopening that box and realizing what it\nis but at the same time like you could\nnever know that possibility without\nobserving it so I think that's analogous\nto this meditation exercise because I\nwill never truly know what my normal\nbreathing pattern is because in\nobserving it I am actually tainting the\nexperiment mm-hmm so what I'm hearing\nfrom you is that you can't observe\nwithout exerting at least a tiny bit of\ncontrol yes so what do you think and\nthen you were also kind of talking about\nnot knowing what your normal breathing\npattern is yeah because it's like I so\nwhat what should you do about that\nI kind of like one a shortcut the whole\nthing and just not think about the\nbreathing at all okay what is that mean\nthat means like the because I feel like\nI'll never truly be able to observe a\nnormal breath because that lingering\ndoubt of whether or not I'm exerting\ncontrol good a situation good so you've\nleveled up beautifully done so now\nyou're ready for the second part of the\ntechnique which you did very good so now\nI'm gonna frame it for you a little bit\nokay so the first is that you should do\nthis technique in two ways one is to sit\nand do it with your eyes closed and the\nsecond is to sneak attack it so huh like\nso throughout the day see if you can\ncatch your breath and observe it without\nit noticing that you're looking see if\nyou can notice it without changing there\nbut it's got to be a sneak attack\nbecause if you start to observe it it's\ngonna change so sneak attack it and do\nboth and see what you could figure out\nvery cool I like it\nit'll reinforce that mental thought\nprocess of being able to let go\nhopefully yes yes right it'll also\nreinforce the thought process of you\ncatching yourself throughout the day and\nnoticing what's going on inside you\nright so it's to hold an awareness of\nwhat you're looking for throughout your\nday and once you can once you start\nsneak attacking the breath and trying to\ncatch it here there you can also also be\non the lookout for the feeling of\nunluckiness\ngood luck ma'am yep thank you again for\nhaving me take care thanks for being on\nhere okay\nall right\nso I don't know if I I hope he's not\nwatching okay so oh gee if you're\nwatching you have to stop watching\nactually and I won't say all right let's\nsee what do we want to do now do you\nwant to do to have time for a question\nbut maybe not let's see if we can hold\non see if we can oh yeah okay great hey\nwe have time for a question - yeah sure\nlet's do it let's do questions you know\nyo man what's up what's up so I have to\nget to kill questions so the first one\nis or do we approach this situation in\ndifferent ways when we feel stuck in\nlife where we we should start and if we\nshould adopt new ways of thinking or\nreflecting that's the first one so how\ndo you approach feeling stuck in life\nyeah well so I think that depends a\nlittle bit about how you're stuck but\nI'd say the first thing you know the\ntakeaway from this week is that a lot of\npeople are not stuck because of what\nlife gives them but because of what they\nput on themselves good right so the\nfirst thing is like what is your\ncontribution to being stuck and should\nyou change your thinking\nabsolutely and oftentimes you want to\nchange it in kind of like the way that\nlike if you've been thinking that\nthere's this particular way to get out\nof being stuck like let's say you don't\nhave any money and you're your thought\nis like you know I need to get a job I\nneed to get a job I need to get a job\nlike if you're still stuck after having\nthat thought that you need to get a job\nyou need to maybe have a different kind\nof thought so like just imagine take\ngetting a job off the table and asking\nyourself like okay how do I get money\nlike if like it's not just about getting\na job like where else can I start to\nmove forward because if your mind has\ncome up with some\nand those haven't worked for you is\nlogical as they may seem just let go get\nsolution okay so the second question is\noh do I make fenugreek seeds tastes\nbetter because when I drink sometimes\nseeds with water in the morning huh I\nneed to make look lots of effort to\ndrink it because it that stays yeah so\nI'm sorry what was your question so\nfenugreek seeds tastes bad or water\ntastes good no fenugreek this bed or how\ncan I make it this but you can't make it\ntaste better\nwhy do you want it to taste better so I\ncan drink it more often\nwhy can't you drink it because it tastes\nbad yeah because it's are hard to\nswallow so or you soak them overnight so\nthey're soft yeah okay but taste my\nteeth are do you chew them sometimes\nokay so if you chew them they're gonna\nbe better but like my bigger question to\nyou what's your name buddy no no Sonu no\nwhy is it that you let things that you\ndon't enjoy control your actions it's\nalready done you could be so why is it\nthat like something tasting bad keeps\nyou from doing it why can't you eat\nthings that taste bad yeah because I\ndon't know I have to think about it good\nthen think about it that's exactly what\nI want you to do so this is I have a\nmeditation practice for you today you\nknow okay what do you have in your house\nthat you don't like to eat what those\nthings like what like doubles like it\nfell that's and things like do you have\nlike something in your house right now\nthat you can go pick up and eat and put\ninto your mouth I think so okay\nso go and eat that thing go go do it now\nand then don't ask yourself yeah so like\nI'm gonna tell you what to do so I want\nyou to ask yourself like what is it\nabout this that I don't enjoy and can I\ndo this or does the lack of enjoyment\nlike hold me back from doing it because\nthe reason that your stock may be very\nvery different from the reason that og\nis stuck and also the same because it\nsounds like you don't let yourself do\nthings that you don't enjoy and if you\ncould do the things that you don't enjoy\nthen you wouldn't be stuck anymore so it\nis you that's holding yourself back\nbecause you don't like something like\nyou're not gonna move anywhere in life\nif you don't do things that you don't\nlike if you can free yourself of being\nrestricted by the things that you like\ntoo then life becomes really really easy\nyeah so go and eat and for those of you\nat home I want you guys to spend as long\nas you can eating things that are a\nbalanced diet and also the things that\nyou liked the least so the next time\nthat you make a meal or you good I mean\nno one's going to restaurants nowadays\nbut let's say you go and pick up food\nyou're gonna order food right if you go\nand get takeout you're gonna have\noptions between things that you like and\nthings that you don't like and the funny\nthing about us is we always order the\nthings that we like so I want you guys\nto practice ordering the things that you\ndon't like or eating the things that you\ndon't like okay and if you get good if\nthe things that you don't like no longer\ncontrol you then how would your life\nchange you know do you have any idea\nyeah I think I would be morality like\nand a lot of things I can take like\nsometimes I I don't like to study but I\nneed to do it but if I could just\nobserve the feeling of not liking to\nstudy I think\nI could study for example good so\nthere's a there's actually like a pretty\nextreme meditative practice called a\ngory sadhana so sadhana means spiritual\npractice gore means fear and aghori\nmeans no fear so these are people that\nas part of their spiritual practice do\nnot let fear control what they do so\nthey live in cemeteries practice\ncannibalism in all kinds of other weird\n[ __ ] they tend to be like pretty\ninfamous but there's like a spiritual\npractice that kind of says that like if\nyou want control over yourself you have\nto do things that you sort of find\nrepulsive I'm not saying that you guys\nshould do things that you find repulsive\nbut I'm saying that like think about how\nbad you how much your life is restricted\nby the things that you like or don't\nlike and if you could remove that if you\ncould like everything equally and\nplaying a video game was no different\nfrom studying imagine what you could\naccomplish yeah and if you want to start\nwalking that road\nit starts with little little things like\nordering the food that you like the\nleast on the menu that's very true\ngood luck man ready for next\nit is difficult\n[Music]\nhello hey time hey dr. K I was wondering\nif your body can become addicted to a\ncertain emotion\noh that's an interesting question what\ndo you think well we see addiction\naddiction the behavior right is usually\ntriggered by the lack of emotion in the\nwhen you are young or something like\nthat right we're basically reacting to a\nsense car so but but there is like\naddiction to alcohol so we're when\npeople try to go cold turkey or alcohol\nthe the body reacts right because yeah\nit needs that alcohol it has been for\nfunctioning for so long with the\nsubstance the body that basically needs\nto stay alive so if you have been like\n[ __ ] touch our co-workers or said like\nthat you made become addicted to that\nyou don't pay off that you get for the\n[ __ ] talk or whatever yeah so I mean\nthat makes sense to me so I wouldn't\nreally call that an addiction but let me\njust try to clarify a couple of terms so\nI I think everything you said makes\nsense\nthe first thing is that I don't think\nthat people use addictive behaviors when\nthey're not feeling anything\nI think they usually use addictive\nbehaviors when they are feeling\nsomething negative because the addictive\nbehavior takes away the feeling of\nnegativity so oh gee like sometimes\nengages in sexual relationships or\npeople use substances because they feel\nsad or lonely or on law\nor whatever with me I think a lot of\ntimes you aren't aware of what the\nemotion is but usually I think about\naddictive behaviors as making bad\nemotions go away all right with me or\nnot with me yeah yeah it's coping quiet\nyep exactly that's a great way to put\ndescribe addiction now so then your\nquestion is like can your body be\naddicted to certain feelings and I mean\nI I was kind of envisioning like sitting\nin a chair like can I get addicted to\nsitting in a chair I mean the short\nanswer is sort of like I don't know if\nit's really an addiction but I think\nthat generally speaking the mind and\nbody are drawn to things that satisfy\ncertain needs\nso shit-talking your coworkers I\nwouldn't really call that an addiction I\nwould call that like satisfying your ego\nand you could call satisfaction of ego\nyour addiction but that sounds like so\nyou can definitely have repetitive\nbehaviors that create common feelings in\nyour body I just don't know that I would\nquite classify that as an addiction does\nthat make sense\nlike I think it makes sense that you\nwould frequently shit-talk your\ncoworkers because you feel better and\nthen you will you will seek that feeling\nbetter over and over and over again but\nin my mind like even though those two\nthings sound the same I feel like there\nare different words to describe those\none word just hasn't been invented yet\nbut I think though like the mechanism of\naddiction and the mechanism of ego is\nbeing like separate neurological\npathways like there are different parts\nof the brain ok but like emotions right\nlike they'd be a collagen right sure and\nlike we have so much cortisol so much\nstuff so can we get it like addicted to\nthat cortisol level it takes behavior\nto reach that that cortisol like get\nstressed purpose yes sort of but once\nagain I wouldn't quite use the word\naddiction because addiction means a\nspecific thing neuro scientifically so\nbut can you get into patterns where you\nlike so like there are adrenaline\njunkies right so adrenaline junkies are\nin a sense addicted to certain kinds of\nbehaviors because they like the feeling\nof like adrenaline pumping through their\nveins\nso reward so I would call it reward\nchasing as opposed to addiction because\nreward chasing involves like under if we\ntalk about reward chasing addiction is\non you know all addictions are reward\nchasing but not all reward chasing is an\naddiction oh I see you know got it so\nlike I don't yet I mean just because I\nlove to play a video game\ndoesn't mean that I'm addicted to a\nvideo game even though I like that\nfeeling like I mean I recently I've been\ntalking about deep rock collective cuz\nthat's what I've been playing because I\ncan play for like 25 minutes at a time\nwhich is nice cuz I have kids but like I\nlike to play it I enjoy it because we\ndefinitely have reward circuitry that\nreinforces behaviors but not all reward\ncircuitry that reinforces a behavior is\nan addiction but can people do people\nwant to engage in a behavior that\nrewards them in a particular way whether\nit be physiologic or psychological\nabsolutely or their hormones involved\nabsolutely can you get can you want to\n[ __ ] talk your coworkers because it\nmakes you feel good like in making pumps\nup your ego absolutely do people do that\nkind of [ __ ] every day does it kind of\nlook like an addiction absolutely but I\nwould still say that neuroscientific Lee\nthe mechanisms the circuits in the brain\nthat are activating are different and\nthen the circuits that activate during\naddiction okay cool thanks yeah great\nquestion man thank you"
