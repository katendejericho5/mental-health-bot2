    "transcript": "I'm cool to talk about whatever yeah so\nwhat's it like to talk to evil people on\nthe phone oh I think that I have become\nsomewhat it would callous be the right\nword um I feel like Oh\nfor three years huh yeah I've been doing\nit for three years also initially there\nwere times where a scammer would say um\nI play a grandma character or I do all\nthe characters I try to be like a\ngrandfather and they would say something\nlike I'm if you don't go to the store\nand buy me a gift card I will come to\nyour house and shoot you and the first\nfew times I heard that you don't know\nwhat to say and there's this moment of\nwow how could another person say this to\nit\na human being and then I think the more\nthat I've done it I just\nmaybe I'm desensitized so you said that\nthere's a moment where you and then you\nmade a facial expression oh and so what\nwhat do you feel unless you in that\nmoment I think for me it there's times\nwhere when I talk to them I feel\nsearching for the right word\nyou can feel shocked and wonder how\ncould a human being say that to someone\nhow could a person get to the point\nwhere they feel it's okay to threaten an\n87 year old grandma for a gift card I\nguess that's what goes through my mind\nyeah so that's a little bit abstract\nright because like you're on the other\nend of the phone and they're telling you\nthis but I don't hear anything personal\nright you're asking how could someone do\nit's like you're watching the news like\nyou're not participating how could\nanyone do this to another human being\nwhich is a little bit strange like I\nwould expect that if I was on the phone\nwith someone and said I'm gonna come to\nyour house and I'm gonna kill you even\nif I was pretending I would imagine that\nI felt like some kind of personal yeah\nremorse yeah yes kind of yeah and some\nof the a few of this gamers I've talked\nto you I I think they don't care at all\nthey're they're okay with they want me\nto be afraid and they want me to sure to\ncry and capitulate and listen to\nwhatever it is they want and I suppose\nthat's the hardest part is where there\nare times that I know in order to keep\nwasting the scammers time in order to\nkeep like doing what I do I have to play\na character who is scared and sad and\nwill take their abuse and sometimes\nthat's really hard to what's hard about\nworks work through well it's it's\nterrible you have you have someone\nyelling at an old man and someone who is\nlike verbally abusing you and and trying\nto manipulate someone to give them money\nand you have to act like this is okay\nI'm just gonna keep going along with it\nand and I think I'm fine with it because\nI know that I'm educating people about\nthe scams I'm wasting the guy's time at\nthe end of the day I typically also\nsomething that we've been doing lately\nis I'll like by the Google Play card\nthat they want and I my background is in\nsoftware dev so I coded a fake Google\nstore and I've redeemed the Google Play\ncard and then they get really really mad\nat me so I know in the back of my mind\nthat there's gonna be some how do you\nfeel when they get mad at you there yeah\nI admittedly there is a little bit of\nlike a I don't know justice is the right\nword because it's now really justice but\ndon't ask me that question um I don't\nknow I don't know what it is but it's\nthere's something satisfying about\nsaying well you thought that you could\ncontrol the situation and manipulate an\n87 year old man but actually we were\ncontrolling the situation for the past\nfive hours and and you just got scammed\nit's like we've we flipped the table and\nkind of got back at the scammers in a\nsmall way I guess can I ask you so you\nwere saying earlier that you become\ncallous over time do you feel a whole\nlot of empathy like in general yeah or I\nthink in general I'm I hate I don't like\nmaking statements like this but I feel\nas though I have empathy and I don't\nlike staying that because I don't like\ncoming I don't want to come across like\noh yeah I'm great arrived I'm a really\nnice person or something but I do think\nthat I think about people and I very a\nlot of the times when I talk to scammers\nI Iram in the back of my mind this is\njust another person who you know is\ngoing through who knows what and I don't\nknow the story that they got him here\nbut yeah so kit let me let me ask you so\nthose seem like thoughts right okay\nright so what I'm curious about is do\nyou do you when you say when I ask you\ndo you feel empathy your answer was sort\nof I think I do but I don't want to say\nyes because that seems arrogant or\nsomething yeah I just don't want to come\nI don't want to sound like I'm saying\ndude I'm the nicest person on the\ninternet found the most humble person\never because obviously that's not the\nquestion I'm asking right I'm not asking\nif you're a nice guy or you are you\nconcerned that maybe you come across as\ntoo nice or not nice enough\nI don't know okay yes I think that I met\nwith empathetic I think I will answer it\nmore straightforwardly sure you think\nyou're empathetic what makes you think\nyou're empathetic let me I get empathy\nand sympathy mixed up sure so to me so\nlit so so let's define me great great\npoint right so sympathy is feeling kind\nof bad for someone empathy is feeling\nwhat they feel okay yeah I think that so\nsay that again sympathy is that sympathy\nis feeling bad right so I'm over here\nand you're over there and and I feel bad\nfor you and empathy is sort of I feel\nbad with you\nright so empathy is the capacity for one\nhuman being to like feel another's pain\nso like if I'm watching TV and someone\ngets hit in the nuts I feel a visceral\npain within myself does that make sense\nlike like putting yourself in someone's\nshoes yeah exactly so like for example\nwhen I see I would say that I'm that I\nam empathetic or I have yeah absolutely\nokay so I'm gonna toss out kind of an\ninflammatory hypothesis and I think that\nit you know I and please give me a\nchance to explain myself\nso as we become callous I think it like\nwe sort of lose our capacity for empathy\nright and and you kind of like I'm just\nnoticing that in your job or for lack of\nit I mean I'm you know in your stream\nwhich I'm just gonna call a job because\nI don't know what else to call it so\nlike in your work okay so like water\nweight are you thinking that screaming\nis not a job\nno I it's just I was implying that like\nI don't know because you mentioned that\nyou have a background in software\ndevelopment so I don't know if this is\nyour job or not it is my job now just\nkidding we posit yeah so so in your work\nyou've had to become callous and as a\nresult of callous you sometimes feel\nless empathy right and you have a couple\nof like abstract statements and even\nwhen you\ntalk about empathy you use the word to\nthink a lot like it sounds like the the\nthe manifestation of your empathy is\nsomething that I'd call cognitive\nempathy which is it sort of like an\nanalysis of someone feeling bad as\nopposed to feeling bad yourself and like\nkind of like in essence capturing what\nthey feel hmm\nright so interesting and and some of\nthat actually relates to a term that is\nmisunderstood which is sociopathy right\nso that's the inflammatory hypothesis so\nwhat I want to tell you myself that was\nbad it doesn't sound bad\nso I test very highly on the sociopathic\nscale just as a disclaimer and what that\nmeans it doesn't mean like sociopathy\nisn't bad in and of itself so\npsychiatrists tend to test very highly\nand part of testing highly on the scale\nis actually controlling or not feeling\nemotional or like having a lot of\ncontrol over the amount of emotional\nempathy you feel so the part of what\nmakes psychiatrists good at their job is\nthat they don't actually when someone\ncomes into my office and they feel super\nsuper depressed and I see people for\nlike ten hours a day who are all\ndepressed if I have in a big valve in\nterms of like the faucet of empathy is\nopen I'm gonna get destroyed\nso psychiatrists trained themselves to\nactually like acquire some degree of\nlike walls between them and another\nperson and those when we think about the\nconcept of sociopathy I'm not calling\nyou sociopath because once again I'm\nsaying I test highly on this I think\nthat that when you talk about feeling\ncallous that in some way is similar to\nlike how sociopaths feel right because\nthe interest if we think about a\nsociopath and you ask them like you know\nif you think about them like how do you\nknow what kind of people are their\ncallous people interesting I will say\njust for the sake of conversation I was\nspecifically talking about just the\nscammers yep because like I have kids\nand there's time the other day my my\nyoungest was really excited about\nsomething that was on the table and one\nof the older ones in a very evil way\npushed\npush the youngest away and I cried just\nbecause my I was remembering my\nchildhood and my my little ones face was\njust devastated it's like why could why\ndid this happen to me and I cried\nbecause I was like like it was so many\nemotions whatever oh gosh I think this\nis a terrible thing - not terrible\nthat's the wrong word but I very much\ndon't I don't want my kids to get hurt I\ndon't want them to have to go up against\nlike to me what I saw and what does to\ngo up against yeah so what I saw in the\nyoungest of the boga clans eyes was just\na complete unexpected you know I don't\nwant to use the word malevolent but just\nuse own just a tear yeah I'm the level\nand act like why would my betrayal yeah\nlike why would my older sibling do this\nto me\nand I didn't like seeing that I've been\nbetrayed and it's terrible and even\nthough it was a small thing it was just\none little thing well it was just you\ncould say it was just getting knocked\nover right versus someone it's not like\nyour spouse cheats on you or something\nyeah but for for my young kid that was\nprobably maybe the first time or one of\nthe first times that they've been\nbetrayed and I yeah so all those\nthoughts and flooded into my mind anyway\nit was all that was to say I still think\nthat I I don't feel like I'm callous in\nmost situations another way I could\ndescribe it is um and sorry I talk a lot\nso if you can just stop me but um when I\nfirst started streaming but I still try\nto do this today but sometimes at the\nend when I would talk to a scammer\nafter I said you know gotcha I I wasn't\na gold right after all I'm just the\nnormal guy wasting your time I would ask\nthem why are you doing this\ndo your parents know that you're doing\nthis I would try to have a\nheart-to-heart conversation beautiful.i\nand I would I really wanted to somehow\nreach in to their life and and even if\nit was a 1% chance that they might think\nabout it at night and and it would get\nthem to change I would do that almost\nevery time and it made some people\nreally upset because they wanted me to\njust yell off the scammers and say look\nafter you you know you suck but I really\nwanted to do it because I felt like\nthere's mistakes I've made that people\nreached in and said hey you made a bad\nchoice but you can be better like why\ncan't I do that to a scammer why can't\nwe do that for people that felt right\nbut over time it's becoming harder and\nharder for me to do that maybe that's\nanother way to to say I'm callous or\nlike it's harder to still have that same\nhope oh yeah like these this guy can\nchange or this girl can change because\nI've been doing it for for 3 years and\nyou run across so many characters\nrespond um most of the time there's\nprobably three different responses one\nis this arrogant like scamming is\nawesome I make hundreds of million\ndollars of hundreds of millions of\ndollars a year and I have like 16 what\ndo they call it they they're sleeping\nwith girls all the time and their life\nis perfect and they always bring up the\nmoney thing like they make tons and tons\nof money which I just think there's a\nlot of evidence to say that's not true\nand sure but of course they want I think\nthey want to feel special and they want\nto take away anything I'm saying and\njust say\nI love my life things are great so\nthat's one probably the majority of this\ncamera what do they even do with you on\nthat level yeah I would probably half of\nthem would wooden some of them would\njust hang up and say we're not scammers\nand they would just hang up you know and\nthe other half would respond to me so I\nwould say 50% just hanging up 25% would\nrespond to me and say I love my life and\nthen maybe 25% would get a little bit um\nyou could tell that their voice changed\na little bit and they would they would\ntell you something like well this is the\nonly thing that I can do to feed my\nfamily or something like that and then\nit was an even less percent of people\nthat would just tell you I'm a scammer I\ndon't make any money but honestly I'm\nnot sure what else to do and like get\ninto a really really actual real\nconversation that's maybe like 2% or\nsomething and you say that your viewers\ndon't like that well I think I think the\ncommunity that I have now is fine when I\ndo that I think there's just a\nespecially when I first started and it\nwas so new there were people there's a\ngroup of people that come in who I am\nthis is my perception of it I talked a\nminute about how a minute ago about how\nthere's a a nice feeling right of\nrevenge or something yeah when when you\nget back at the scammers whatever it is\nand I think there's a lot of people who\nwant to see that happen and then when I\nstart sympathizing or empathizing or\nwhatever and saying hey you're a person\nyou can do better than this what do you\ntell your kid what do you tell your kids\ndo you want your kids to have to do this\nis this the world that you want to\ncreate for the people start thinking\nwait a second like kit this guy doesn't\ndeserve anything he's a he's a filthy\nfilthy scammer who needs\nyou know what do you want a comments\nwhat do you take away from them okay by\nhumanizing the person you're talking to\nwhat do I take away from chat or what\nare we having from I think to some for\nsome people I'm not saying the majority\nI'm not saying the majority I think\nthere are some people that hmm maybe\nit's harder for them to hate that person\nor harder for them to feel as though\nthey I don't know what the right word is\nyou haven't thought about this before\ncuz you give myself a very important\nright what is that feeling the revenge\nfeeling or the yeah I think that for\nsome people you know their their family\nhas been affected by scams sure maybe\ntheir grandma got scammed\num and then Here I am saying this is\njust another person who could make\nbetter life choices and deserves a\nsecond chance\nand I don't think so doesn't say what I\nhear that when your mom just got scammed\nyeah you know oddly enough kid I be I\nmean I don't have any data to support\nthis but I'd be surprised if most people\nwho watch what you do resonate with you\nbecause they have been victims of some\nkind of scamming or someone they they\nknow has been victimized I think what\nyou're talking about is a feeling of\nrighteousness right it's like just like\nyeah there's people who like let that\nuncomfortable for me to accept this but\nthere are people who've said that yeah\nlike they've called it justice porn yeah\nabsolutely and it puts me in kind of a\nweird situation or has put me in a weird\nsituation at times because while yes I\nthink that it's important to waste their\ntime and\nto keep people about these scammers and\nand I don't ever want to say that it is\nacceptable for them to do what they're\ndoing I do genuinely believe that every\nperson has value and that everyone\nshould be treated that way and sure I\nthink that if most people thought about\nit they would say well yeah that's like\nthat's the way our justice system works\nright if people if you get in trouble\nyou're still treated as though you have\nsome sort of I mean I could be wrong but\nsome sort of something that you might be\nable to bring to the world so you have a\ndefense against you and it's all these\ndifferent things but we had a couple of\nthings that if I can just jump in for a\nsecond one is I want to explain a little\nbit more about what I meant and ask you\na couple of questions about callousness\nand sociopathy because I want to just\nclarify that I didn't mean to imply that\nI think you're a sociopath it's what I\nwhat I really meant to understand is I\nthink that so this is a big problem with\nwith the idea of sociopathy is we kind\nof label people as sociopaths are not\nsociopaths I don't think it's binary\nlike I look I'll be a little bit more\ntransparent so when I was talking about\npsychiatrists I think that callousness\nand essentially sociopathy is is a\nfunction of the mind that can be grown\nand adaptive in certain circumstances\nright into a certain degree like like\nall physicians have to learn how to deal\nwith death and like deal with it in a\nvery neutral way in order to do their\njob and it doesn't surprise me at all\nbecause I actually have the same\nexperience that you have with your kids\nwhich is a whole years ago I used to be\nvery very emotionally like level and not\nmany things would upset me or bother me\nI could watch like movies and stuff with\ngore and and all kinds of bad things\nhappen go yeah people it didn't bother\nme at all\nin fact I was probably even a little bit\nlike titillated or you know the\nextremity like watching an extreme\nemotion or extreme situation made me\nfeel a little bit more because most of\nmy experience of life was like just me\nbeing dead in the inside yeah and but\nafter having kids and also I think after\nsort of starting to practice psychiatry\nI found that I\nmore walls up for my emotions with\npeople and then there was some amount of\nlike emotional build-up that would\nhappen with people which then would\nstart pouring out in other situations\nand especially like with my kids and\nstuff so like I find myself getting\nteary eyed and stuff at all kinds of\nrandom and so I think it is I'm kind of\ncurious about sort of talking a little\nbit more with you about you know being\nclosed off in calais in one situation\nand being open and feeling in another\nsituation I'd also be a little bit\ncurious you said that you know you said\nsomething about being betrayed and when\nyou saw you know like one child it's not\nso much of your kid was malevolent\nalthough like there was some malevolence\nin there right so there's a little\npretty young yeah sure I don't know if\nthey intentionally tried to this is a\nvery big difference sure absolutely\nso but there was something about that\npicture that feels malevolent even if\nit's not you know one of your kids being\nmalevolent maybe the other kid doesn't\nhave a perception of malevolence but\nthere's you know level and somewhere in\nthere right maybe between the lines and\nso you said it reminded you of something\nthat happened to you I'm very curious\nabout that and part of the reason that\nI'm curious about that is I'm curious\nwhy you do what you do um I don't think\nI do what I do because of the probably\nbiggest betrayal thing that comes to\nmind so it would probably be two very\ntips tricks but I'm happy to talk about\neither or both and then the last kind of\nthing that I want to talk to you about\nis do you think your job is fun\nyeah yeah for the most part what's fun\nabout it very much enjoy it um I like\nthat every day is a different like story\nare different I don't know what to\nexpect every day and novelty yeah you\nknow I I think occasionally some P and I\ntotally understand this for for some\npeople you once you've seen a couple of\nmy streams and you've seen that there's\nprobably five or six different main scam\njust let's say and after you've just\nseen let's say I'll say a dozen whatever\nit is you could go alright well I kind\nof know what's gonna happen now like I\nknow I have a general understanding of\nthe way the scams work and I think some\npeople are like oh he just does the same\nthing every day\nbut for me it's it's always a different\nperson I'm talking to you on the phone\nsure I try to play a different character\nwe do a lot of weird different things\nand I like that I also really like um I\nlike making people laugh and I I think\nthat to some degree there has been a\nsense of I don't know if I want to say\npurpose but it feels like I'm I'm\nproviding for my family I'm doing\nsomething that I enjoy and believe in\nI'm educating people I'm able to help\npeople laugh and and learn about things\nand I feel like it meets a lot of yeah\nthat checks a lot of things off the list\nso I'm very grateful for that very\ngrateful for that I'm curious do you\nfeel like a predator no I I don't think\nso\nyou mean then I talking to this cameras\nyeah yeah people have asked me before\nlike yeah do I feel like I'm I don't\nknow taking advantage some people have\nsaid that I I am taking advantage of\nthem and like I don't know that you're\ntaking advantage of them\nI don't think think so um do I feel like\na predator\nI don't know if I bet anyone's asked me\nthat particular question predator as in\nit makes me think of like a lion or\nsomething like I'm stalking them and so\nI wasn't thinking so much lion I was\nthinking spider okay like trying to trap\nthem and um Chad says confirmed\nsociopathic predator and this is what I\nmean by challenging is this okay that\nI'm asking you these things oh I don't\ncare okay yeah no this is interesting I\nI really like to think I really like to\nthink about stuff so um yeah I don't I\nthink that I have ever thought of myself\nas a predator or like I was doing\nsomething wrong I did have some serious\nconversations with a friend of mine\nwho's also just likes to think in the\nvery beginning so three years ago let's\nsay is what you know is what I'm doing\nwrong let's say like that was sort of\nthe topic what am i you know am I so you\nwould if we're straightforward about it\nI lie on the phone every day right I\ntalked to this gamer and I pretend to be\nan 87 year old man or whatever it is for\nfive hours or whatever I lie and at\nfirst there were times where I would\nthink oh gosh I mean a pretty big I\nthink it's fairly important to fairly\nimportant is wrong I don't want it I\nthink it's very important not to lie I\nthink something that I I teach my kids\nand that everyone generally would would\nsay to their children you don't tell\nyour kid you know what a great thing to\ndo son or daughter like lie that's\nthat's great so that was something that\nwas hard for me for awhile like it\ngosh I'm lying every day and the way I\nsort of justified it or the way that I\nthought through it with with one of my\nfriends was that one\nI do typically tell them at the end I do\nnot always but in the beginning I always\nat the end told them that I was actually\nme and I I sort of like stopped lying\nyou know and explained the whole entire\nsituation and part of that was a mental\nthing for me to say okay well I'm not\nlying anymore like no but then I also\nwent in talking to my friend thought\nwell maybe this is just I think there's\na word for it so you might know um sort\nof like it I don't want to say for the\ngreater good because I think that's like\nmisquoted a lot but but that can I don't\nthat kind of vibe but maybe that's the\nbest oh I meant to say the ends justify\nthe means I think that's misquoted a lot\nthe the but further greater good you\ncould kind of say yeah like okay so I\nlied to a scammer for a while so I could\nkeep them on the phone and educate\nthousands of people about the scam I\nfeel like there's a so what that I'm\ngonna ask you something okay so what it\nsounds like no no I'm just an ER I\nactually really appreciate that you talk\na lot you shared a lot of thoughts and\nit really honestly it's it's it's really\nawesome so let me ask you something so\nright now what you're doing is\nessentially providing a lot of reasons\nwhy your behavior is good right yeah\nbecause I'm a predator so my protection\nokay so I was trying to say yeah I don't\nthink I am and here's why but absolutely\nright so so so I didn't okay so maybe to\nclarify so I'll ask you again do you\nfeel like a predator leader doing this\nbut just so it's clear I didn't think\nthat you were calling me a predator so I\nmisspoke well get in there at some point\num no I don't think that I mode\npredator I don't feel like I'm a\npredator okay I don't when you're\ntalking to you Scambler do you feel like\nyou're hunting hmm I've been hunting\nbefore it's not gosh you know maybe\nthere's definitely times where I don't\nknow if I'm supposed to say that but\nthere's definitely times where it feels\nlike I'm a few steps ahead of them and I\nknow exactly what they're gonna do and\nI'm I'm laying my traps if you will or\nlike I there's days where it feels like\nI what was the term I can play them like\na fiddle and and it's like I hate maybe\nthis comes across really weird but yeah\nit's like I can do whatever I want I can\nhave them sing songs I can have them\nyeah you can so you can really just so\nyou're a person troll now who can\ncontrol other people you can play them\nlike a fiddle\nwell I've only experienced that with the\nscammers absolutely right\nso so these are your words right there\nthere are moments where you can feel\nlike you can play them like a fiddle and\nwe're talking about yet so I would say\nthe concept is or at least as I've\nbefore we're going to jump in I want you\nto ask I want to ask you what are you\nfeeling when I say that it's like kind\nof an inflammatory and almost like an\nattack I feel uncomfortable yeah yeah I\nfeel like I shouldn't be saying it\nbecause I deserve let's talk about why\njust you know maybe it feels wrong it\nfeels like a bad like oh yeah I can\ncontrol people like it feels like that\nher like a bad guy in a movie would be\nthings yeah yeah I can control people\nyou know kit who else can control can\ncontrol people\nthere's a lot of jokes but I want to say\nbut uh you know so I can do that so a\nlot of times you know on stream I'm\ncapable of bringing people in a\nparticular way and I I choose to use my\npower for good instead of evil but like\nI'm I can I mean so I have a skill to\nessentially like shape the behavior and\nperceptions of other human beings that's\nwhat a small actress does yeah and and I\nthink the more you especially the more\nyou you know how people think and the\nmore that you experience that I'm sure\nyou can ask questions and lead people\nany which way and I think I'm I've\nexperienced that with with the scammers\nbecause I know for the most part let's\nsay 90% I know what they want I know how\nthe scam works\nI know I know what's driving them I'd\nI've learned all of these things and so\nyou can use it you could say against\nthem to waste their time and do whatever\nit is you want and so I would say the\nsame thing I've used it in a way I\nviewed it for good rather than -\nabsolutely\nso that's unclear about this okay so I'm\nglad that you're saying that because I'm\nunder stand that you feel uncomfortable\ncuz I think what you're doing so I'm\njust gonna ask you is it fun and your\nanswers were there's novelty there's\nhumor there's purpose I support my\nfamily\nthose are all positive things right and\nand so it is it so so when I ask you is\nit fun your answer is involved like yeah\nit's something new every day you know I\nsupport my family it's funny there's\nlike humor to it and and I think there's\nalso like this undercurrent of like I\nthink why people watch us because\nthey're watching a hunter right like I I\nthink I think that just because you're\ntrying to like I think it's very I think\nyour moral approach is doubly important\nbecause there's an underbelly to this\nthat is not positive so I think that\nyou're a good person because you don't\ngive in to those feelings of\nrighteousness and you try to go the\nextra step\nactually help people but I think there's\nabsolutely some amount of you know\nsatisfaction from playing people like a\nfiddle because that's how human beings\nwork right the other thing if we think\nabout it the more I'm asking you about\nthe stuff and more uncomfortable I make\nyou feel the more and it's I mean I\napologize for doing this but I'm kind of\ndoing it on purpose\nI'm sort of manipulating you even now\nright sure so I'm like as the discomfort\ncomes up you say more and more positive\nthings like you're like you know I'm\ntrying to help people and I think that's\nhow you've dealt you've reconciled your\nown internal conflict because I think\nthere's a there's a part of you that is\nlike darkness on the inside right\nbecause we all have that sure yeah yeah\nand I think there's been plenty of times\nwhere if you think to yourself oh gosh\nam I like is this well not as much more\nbut when I first started like is this at\nthe cool like am I like am i doing\nsomething wrong here\nyeah use like it's good but I I had to\nwork through that quite a bit because I\nthink there's so that what I think is\nreally respectable about what you do and\nI think what makes you a good person is\nthat struggle so like I want to kind of\ntry to be clients panics I guess have\nyeah so so I think we have the\nperception that good people don't have\nbad pieces right when I asked you is\nthis fun you're like yeah I do it\nbecause I'm trying to help people I'm\ntrying to like educate people about\nscamming this is good about what I do\nthis is good about what I do this is\ngood right what about it this is good at\nwork yeah I think part of that um is\nbecause there are things that are not\nfun so I never I I think I was starting\nto say well here's the reasons why it\nwhat isn't here's the times where I feel\nlike it's fun but there's other times\nwhere it's it's not fun and I also think\nin general yeah there's probably some\nfun whether it's a dark way or whatever\nyou want to call it when you're in\ncontrol of the situation you can get\nthem to sing Britney Spears or whatever\nit is yeah how does that feel like that\nyeah good I don't know I suppose it's\nbecause I again I still think it's\nbecause there's value in it\nlike I see it as I'm keeping them on the\nphone why can't you let why can't why do\nyou have to see value in it\nright why is otherwise it just feels\nlike I'm manipulating a human being and\nthat doesn't feel right yeah so but do\nyou see what your mind is doing there's\nthe feeling of manipulating a human\nbeing and then the rationalization comes\nin and says let's balance them let's\nbalance that's what you're always\ntelling me like here's the way I balance\nit here's the way I balance it here's\nthe way I balance oh yeah and and oddly\nenough that makes you feel like an evil\nperson but that's actually what makes\nyou a good person because a good person\nis not someone who lacks negative\nfeelings a good person is one who\nstrives to balance like that sense of\nlike because you're you're a [ __ ]\npredator man right like that's what you\ndo like do you agree yeah I live\nmanipulate evil people but you're\nabsolutely a predator for evil people\nyeah right look let's be clear like\npeople you war people into your trap and\nthen you pounce which is what people are\nlooking for they're looking for you to\npounce and then what you do [ __ ] kit\nthen you be nice to them and you try to\nhelp them and then it's like and then\neveryone who's watching like sees this\nlike Snow Leopard to jump out of a tree\nand like grab a monkey and then starts\ngiving it like an oil massage and\nthey're like this is not what I signed\nup for yeah why isn't he tearing them\ntheir limbs apart and feeding it to his\nchildren yeah absolutely\nthat's a good description there\ncertainly have been times where\nespecially when I come up against\nsomeone who just feels completely I\nthink there's been a few times\nspecifically that I have met maybe a\nsociopath which I believe is someone who\nlacks empathy sure yeah it's the one way\nof yes\nyeah yeah or there have been people who\njust do not care at all about any\npersons feeling whatsoever and that has\nbeen weird and uncomfortable to come up\nagainst and so with those people there\nhave been times where I'm thinking I\ndon't I don't know if I can have a\nserious conversation with this person\nand tell them what they're doing is\nwrong you need to stop and so I'll\npounce and set the trap or whatever you\nwant to call it or I'll just end the\ncall and I'll leave them thinking gosh I\nruined it\nI could have scammed this person and\nI'll just I'll just end it because\nthat's thinking I can't\nI would rather so here's another on that\nline of thought there have been times\nwhere I've revealed to them\nI call it revealing like yeah taking my\nmask off which by the way like licking\ncan we just for a minute comment on the\nfact that you actually like me we're\nlike you literally become about it right\nlike your identity you see you wear\nsomething and then you go out for the\ngreater good and and you you know it's\nthe world that makes you put the mask on\nright like the world calls you to do\nthis because some people are being like\nscam like yeah absolutely yeah yeah I\nfeel like that's really humbling I don't\nknow how to take compliments very well\nbecause I I just feel like a normal guy\nbut but yeah I appreciate that that's\nwhat that's he's so extraordinary well\nthanks anyway what we're talking about\nOh so there's times where I I do\nappreciate that I don't want that to\ncome across whatever it's just hard for\nme to that's a whole their topic I\nsuppose that's a whole other because I I\nthink the simplest answer is I think\nthat I'm just a\nEveridge person who I you know I think\nI'm a maybe at the root of it is like\nwhat I was saying before I think\neveryone is everyone has value everyone\nhas things that they can do that are\nthat are\ngood and how did you Murray and I how\ndid I learn what the value thing or yeah\nhow did you like so it seems like you\nreally do have a central belief that you\nI don't even know if you I think you you\nconvince yourself of that right like\nthat's a conclusion they probably and\nand and you kind of worked to that and\nat some point you almost chose to set\nthat yes north on your compass yeah I\nthink there's times where you look at\nthis is all I haven't answered a lot of\nthese questions before it's kind of fun\nto think about but I think to some\ndegree when you look at I come across\nsome evil people and you could say the\nworld is terrible why should I have kids\nwhy should anybody do anything\nwhy would like gosh it's just this\nterrible evil place is full of heartache\nand misery or whatever like you could\nyou could have those thoughts or you\ncould say I guess there was a moment\nwhere I said like no I just refused to\nbelieve that that had to be acceptable\nand I said if there are people who can\nbe evil there has to be and I'm not\ntrying to say anything special about\nmyself I just think there was a everyone\nmakes a choice every single day and says\nam I gonna do something that's a little\nbit good or a little bit bad and it\nfeels like why can't why can't we choose\nto do better why can't we be good and I\nwant that for my kids in my family and I\nwant there to be good let me ask\nsomething and why was it so emotional\nfor you when one of your kids knocked\noff the thing for the other kid probably\nbecause they saw bad\nwhat is that evil I think it was a silly\nmoment to some degree because I don't\nwell try think about it describe it to\nme it was one of the first times where I\nwatched the whole thing take take place\nwhere I saw something bad or malevolent\nor whatever I mean they're young so it\nwas one of the first times that they\njust saw evil and there was this look on\ntheir face if I don't understand why\nthis happened and I wonder if I wonder\nif the reason it struck you is because\nin that moment you saw your younger\nchild start to formulate a world where\nthis struggle that you talked about was\nnot true and what I'm sorry this is\ngonna be really abstract but you know so\nthis is what I'm hearing from you you\nkind of talk about people making a\nchoice right you're saying that all\nhuman beings have value and and that\nsort of presupposes like and that\neveryday like you have a struggle and\nyou have to make a choice to be like a\ngood person or a bad person and so like\nthat I think is like absolutely what\nI've been trying to point out to you\nabout your own psychological process is\nthat it's lopsided towards positivity\nbecause I think you know that there is a\nnegative person inside you right\nthere's the hundred think that I could\ndo terrible evil things absolutely and\nit isn't because you recognize that\nbeast what is within you that's why you\nrecognize that people have value so like\nit's not that people have in very\ninherent value it's that they have the\nhope for value right that any person can\nbe turned around because if if it is\nhopeless for others then what does that\nmean for your own internal beast do you\nthink that there is a reason why certain\npeople get concerned with certain\nphilosophical questions like you all of\nyour abstractness has to do with like\nthis axis of good and evil of like value\nin forgiveness and can someone be bad\nand can we forgive them or should they\nbe you know should we crucify them and\njust like Pinos there is there\nis there forgiveness or is there like\nrighteous justice about putting them in\nthe race and in my sense is that all of\nyour abstractions and and now like so I\nconclusions that are really really\nunfair because I like it's like a snap\njudgment right so the reason this isn't\nreally a conclusion it's really like a\nhypothesis for you to think about is it\nokay if I share like my hypothesis about\na couple of things and just a company\ncomes over I might disagree so yeah\nabsolutely you're completely and and and\nyou're you're gonna be the judge of\nwhether this is right or wrong it's not\nmy place to make a conclusion like\nyou're the one who knows right so I'm\ngonna share this with you and then I'd\nlove to hear your reflections about like\nwhether I'm way off base or it resonates\nso the first is like you know I I think\nwhat I think you are a good person I\ndon't think you're a sociopath but I\nthink that you do have this part of you\nthat like we all have and this is the\nproblem is like people don't get this\nand this is why I'm harping on this is\nbecause people feel like bad people\nbecause they have bad feelings and by\nbad feelings I don't mean anger and\ndepression I mean like you know\nschadenfreude means so schadenfreude is\na german word that involves getting\npleasure out of the suffering for from\nof others expelling the b c and h oh i\nsaid i speak a little bit yeah so the\nyou know i think it's interesting\nbecause like like human beings have that\nright like when we watch about like if\nyou look at like some you know some\nsubreddits right like there's a lot of\nthere's a lot of satisfaction over like\nwatching the idiocy of others and i\ndon't know how that is but I think it's\nwired into us because human beings just\nthat's like a you know it's not like a\ncultural thing it's like you can take\nhuman beings from all over the world and\nthey're gonna get satisfaction out of\nwatching someone else like [ __ ] off in\nsome way and then I think we also have\nparts of us that that are I mean some of\nus are hunters right and I think that\nlike just because you feel let that\ndegree of satisfaction I think it's part\nof the reason that people watch what you\ndo because there's a certain like\nrighteous satisfaction out of being able\nto like you know dhamaal or someone\nwho's\nlike an evil person and so we have these\nparts of us that we generally view as\nlike dark or negative right like the\ncapacity to hunt the capacity to like\ntake advantage of someone the capacity\nto manipulate someone and and goodness\nor badness doesn't come from having\nthose thoughts so like for example\npeople with OCD sometimes people have\nobsessional thoughts that are negative\nyeah they like walk around and like they\nhave OCD which means their mind like\nthinks about killing other people and\nthen this person feels bad because\nthey're like I don't want to have these\nthoughts but our mind doesn't we don't\ncontrol what our mind thinks up right\nlike that's but we we blame ourselves\nfor the thoughts that our mind gives us\nand for someone who has anxiety they're\nlike I want to just be able to interact\nwith normal human beings at a party but\ninstead instead my mind is like oh\nyou're a dumbass shut up right you look\nlike an idiot no one here likes you like\nthat's that doesn't that doesn't mean\nwe're actually bad people thinking\nnegative thoughts doesn't make us bad\npeople doesn't make it true our thoughts\nare not true you know what I think is\nactually an I would agree with that yeah\nyeah so what I think where goodness\ncomes from is not about what your\ninternal impulse not about what your\ninternal impulses are but about the way\nthat you act and form them like the way\nthat you act on them in the life that\nyou want for yourself right so I think\nthat's part of the thought of okay why I\nsaid well you have a choice every day\nlike you perhaps so this is where it's\nexactly so I think your worldview comes\nfrom this struggle that you have within\nyourself right because let me ask you\njust go ahead kiddo if you became a\nscammer how successful do you think you\nwould be I choose not to answer the\nquestion\nabsolutely that's good I don't need I\nfeel like with everything that I have\nlearned that I could be very successful\niver good and I think think that I don't\nthink that I could ever actually do it\nthough I feel like I would it would be\nit would throw away all of my morality\nand everything that I absolutely so when\nyou say answer your question I couldn't\nactually\ndo any medicines let's be clear about\ndefinitions you're capable of doing it\nyou choose not to and that's where good\nyes comes fun sure right yeah that's\nyeah it's very interesting I think that\nthat's yeah I think that I would agree\nwith what you're saying that and that's\nwhy I say that idea of now though where\nwe get value from what all that stuff I\nstill don't fully understand I think if\nI can try to summarize it is well every\nday you can choose to do something that\nis going to make things worse and bad\nand evil for you or those around you or\nyou can choose to do things that are\ngood for you and your family and those\naround you and that gives that brings\nvalue maybe yeah so I would change\nactually I'm that might be sort of my\nweird thought yeah so so now I think we\nget to maybe what we talk about next\ntime which is where does this come from\nright and I think that like like in your\ncase I'd be really really curious about\nyou know what your upbringing was like\nwho took advantage of you and whether on\nsome level you're trying because like\nyou know from a Freudian level what we\nkind of say is like some people have\ndaddy issues like right so what we mean\nby that is like like oftentimes or you\nknow some women especially will have a\nparticular relationship of where their\nfather like didn't treat them with\nrespect and then that translates in some\nway into their like current romantic\nrelationships the point here is that\nsomething about your upbringing in the\npast shapes the way that you live your\nlife today and that's kind of like a\npsychological Freudian like kind of a\nnegative cast to it I think that's the\nsame side that's a different side of the\ncoin but is essentially the same coin is\nwhat Mahatma Gandhi said which is be the\nchange that you want to see in the world\nyeah I absolutely agree with that\nstatement"
