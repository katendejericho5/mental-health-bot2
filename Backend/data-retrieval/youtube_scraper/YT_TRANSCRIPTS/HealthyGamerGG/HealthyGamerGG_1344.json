    "transcript": "I want you guys to think about how\npeople become successful and generally\nwe have this idea that success has a\nformula has a formula what\nright and following dr. K is a Boomer is\nnot the success or the formula for\nsuccess so success has a formula and it\ntends to involve things like\nfollow-through discipline a certain\namount of just do it miss right just do\nit\npogg it involves intelligence\nconnections networking and most recently\nbrain hacking body hacking life hacking\nlike oh my god OMG if you do all these\nthings you will be successful right so\nlike the fundamental thing like you can\ntake whatever you want to you like any\nsort of perspective on success in the\nbiggest problem with perspectives on\nsuccesses that like in the West we\nbelieve that there is one way to do it\nso I know that sounds kind of simple but\nlike you know everyone says kind of like\nyou know like obviously there isn't one\nway to do it but if you'd pick up if you\ngo to the self-help section or you go to\nthe business section of like a bookstore\nwhich those are you know going out of\nbusiness and whatnot which you can't do\nright now because of coca quarantines\nlike no book says by the way this is\nonly gonna work for like 20% of people\nlike no book says that right if you look\nat any article no one says like some\nsome may say like this may not work for\neveryone with the presumption is that\nthis is gonna work for like most people\nand we have this idea that success has\nlike a particular formula and if you\nread enough books or you do enough\nthings then you'll then you'll you'll do\na good job so I Irv a the starts from a\nfundamentally different place okay I\nrather starts from this idea that\nsuccess is based\non aligning individual cognitive\npersonality with external strategy and a\ngood example of like someone who sort of\ndoes this is like myers-briggs right so\nmyers-briggs is a good example of\nsomeone who believes that there isn't a\nformula for success they say that if you\nunderstand your personality type and\nthere are lots of different personality\ntypes then you'll be better suited to\nlike be successful because you're not\nplaying the same game as everyone else\nlike you're a different character and\ndifferent characters have different\nstrategies for success that concept\nfundamentally comes from iron either\nbecause myers-briggs is based on Carl\nJung and Carl you of most of Carl Jung's\nlike coroner quote novel theories are\nbased on a study of like Eastern like\ntheory and consciousness so I Rea that\nbasically says like you don't\nnecessarily need this stuff to be\nsuccessful like you actually don't\nreally need this like this is not the\nway to do it right and I fully believe\nthis because I am still lazy\nI suck at follow-through I don't have\ndiscipline I don't like to just do it\ndebatable whether I'm smart or not\ndebatable whether I have connections or\nnot I don't really do a whole lot of\nbrain hacking body hacking or life\nhacking I do do a lot of that stuff sort\nof but in an ir by that perspective so\nthe the Ayurvedic strategy for success\nis to understand who you are and instead\nso it has kind of three steps right\nunderstand who you are and some of y'all\nare pretty good at this and this is\nwhere you guys mess up step number two\nis don't try to be someone else see this\nis where you guys screw up because when\nyou say I'm lazy your answer your once\nyou make that diagnosis of laziness your\nanswer becomes how do I become unlace II\nyour answer becomes if I'm undisciplined\nhow do I gain discipline you are\nfundamentally trying to be something\nthat you're not and then\nthis is where step number three is like\nplay the hand you're dealt so what you\nneed is not a method to like overcome\nprocrastination or like a method to be\nless lazy what you need to do is figure\nout how can you be successful and use\nyour laziness as like fuel to move you\nforward instead of like a hurdle to like\nhold you back or like weight to hold you\nback and that may sound like super super\nbizarre right like how can you use\nlaziness for you but I still maintain\nthat a lack of follow-through can\nactually be an advantageous attribute\nand you can will kind of get to that so\nnow we get to the second thing okay so\nlike how we're are by than allopathic\nmedicine different okay so\nso how are our brother in allopathic\nmedicine different so allopathic\nmedicine is Western medicine so let's\njust compare and contrast them so higher\nViva and now we'll Pathak medicine\nokay so what allopathic medicine does is\ntakes one thing right so let's say\nsickness and then what it does is divide\nit into other things physical sickness\nmental sickness then what it does is\ndivide further let's say like cardiology\nnephrology so that's like kidneys heart\nkidneys and then like let's say like\northopedic surgery right so bones and\nmuscles and then it takes mental health\nand it divides it into addictions\ndepression and then it takes addictions\nand it divides it further into\nbehavioral addictions and substance used\naddictions right so like what allopathic\nmedicine does is it tries to like take\nsomething big and break it apart so\nyou're gonna have like so for example\nI'm sick and then allopathic medicine\nasks okay in what way are you sick are\nyou sick like do you have an infection\nor is this like a chronic health problem\nand then if you have an infection like\nwhat's infected or your lungs infected\nis your nose infected is your stomach\ninfected is your is your skin infected\nis your brain infected do you have\nmeningitis like where is the infection\nokay like depending on the infection\nwhat is the organism is that this\norganism is a bad organism is that this\norganism and then based on that we get\nsmaller and smaller and smaller so we\nbreak things apart and we zoom in and as\nwe break things apart and zoom in we\nsort of end up with like a discrete\ndisease entity we try to make disease to\nbe the tiniest most perfect resolution\nthing that you have so you have a strap\nmeningitis or you have a pneumococcal\nmeningitis in a certain that has a\ncertain antibacterial scent I mean\nantibacterial agent sensitivity right so\nan antibiotic sensitivity and so this is\nthe infection this is the treatment so\nin a person is not involved in that\nright so like the the goal of an\nallopathic of alka Pathak medicine so\nthe person is up here and the goal is to\nget to the disease down here and that a\ndisease has a treatment so it doesn't\nit doesn't matter whether you're like\nyou're you or you're me like the thing\nis if you're treating a bacterial\nmeningitis you're treating a bacterial\nmeningitis the unit of treatment is not\na human it's a disease and so that's\nwhat we mean when we say that like\nallopathic medicine is not about\ntreating people it's about treating\ndiseases so our vet actually is it kind\nof says like completely different things\nso what I Rebecca says is that okay so\nwe have let's say the approach of our\nevent is different so let's say that we\nhave memory we have skin and we have\nweight so we're gonna take these three\nlike really different things and we're\ngonna see is there any system to\ncorrelate them into something bigger and\nthen we're gonna take this fecal oops\nwe're gonna take this big thing and then\nwe're gonna take another thing over here\nlike ah\ndiet preferences okay and we're gonna\ncombine those two and see if we can come\nup with something even bigger so this is\nhow our in other words I Rebecca says is\nthere any correlation between someone's\nmemory and the type of skin that they\nhave is there any correlation between\ntheir mental like cognitive fingerprint\nlike and their weight is there any\ncorrelation between how constipated\ntheir they are and how their heart\nfunctions so what Ayurvedic tries to do\nis is it takes individual pieces and\nthen it tries to construct patterns and\nWestern medicine does the opposite it\ntakes a whole thing like when someone is\nsick and it tries to divide them into\nits component pieces so if you have an\ninfection you've got coffee and you've\ngot fever and you've got this and you've\ngot this let's treat coughed with this\nlet's treat fever with this let's treat\nthis with you know the third symptom\nwith the third thing and so what happens\nis like over time you know as people\nbecome sick in western medicine they\nhave a lot of targeted treatments for\neach of their problems so you've got two\nmedications for your blood pressure\nyou've got one medication for your\ndiabetes you've got an asthma\nhailer and then you've got like physical\ntherapy for your knees and then you also\ntake like tylenol because you have\narthritis so over time like the like\nwhat we do is we treat individual things\nso we've got like a treatment here a\ntreatment here a treatment here and a\ntreatment here and so people end up with\nfour treatments right this is how\nWestern medicine works what I rather\nsays is is there any correlation between\nthis is there a broad pattern that we\ncan observe and if there is that pattern\ncan we treat this and thereby improve\nthis improve this and improve this if we\ntreat sort of the overarching pattern\ncan we sort of address all of the\ncomponents at the same time and so what\nour vet that comes up with over here is\nsomething called doshas so these are\nelemental balances so what I rather says\nis that people who are prone to ulcers\nare also prone to anger and irritability\nand are also a medium build and also\ntend to like lose their hair earlier\nthan people who like so so this is\nsomething called bitthe okay so like\nanyway so--but that has some some\ncorrelated physical and mental\ncharacteristics umm Vata has some\ncorrelated physical and mental\ncharacteristics and kapha has some\ncorrelated physical and mental\ncharacteristics and by improving the\nthree doshas in and of themselves you\nactually treat all of this like the\ncomponent symptoms and there's actually\ndata that supports this okay so now what\nwe got to do okay I gotta fix this\nokay so this is what I did so I got to\nfix my thing\nI need more space let's do this\nso let's move these down\n[Music]\nget that out of the way\nerase this let's fix this okay now comes\nthe tricky part\nwhat is can dr. K do this\n[Music]\nwe\nwe missed a why\nso\nokay so IRA better I rather believes\nthat we all have a door shake or\nelemental balance and what that means is\nthat we've got these three forces called\nVata Pitta and kapha and that Vata Pitta\nkapha have each like a certain level and\nthat their levels sort of determine what\nattributes we have that are physical and\nmental\nokay so let's talk for a second about so\nVava is like characterized by air v is\ncharacterized by fire and Gotha is\ncharacterized by earth they each also\nhave second elements but we won't get\ninto that so the first thing to\nunderstand is like what what Ayurvedic\nphysicians observed is they notice like\nsome people are kind of like air or kind\nof like the wind and what that means is\nthat their mental thinking is what I'd\ncall dynamic so if we think about the\nwind like how does the what what is it\nwhat are the properties of wind so it\nblows really hard and then it stops it\nblows in a different direction and then\nstops and then it blows over here and it\nblows over there it can blow hard or it\ncan blow light it can just it's it's\njust very variable right if we compare\nthat to something like fire despite urn\nin one direction then randomly turn\naround and burn in different direction\nand then randomly turn around and burn\ninto third and then it stops and starts\nup again no so fire is sort of driven\nfocused unidirectional\nright these are like fundamentally\ndifferent like properties like their\ndynamic ways of kind of thinking and\nthey looked at gafas which is earth and\nthey noticed like okay there's a third\nkind of person who doesn't like move in\na particular direction in sort of a\ndriven and focused way they're actually\nlike very stable and constant so they\ncan also move like earth can move too\nlike you I mean you can think about you\nknow I mean I guess we don't really\nthink about earth moving but they sort\nof noticed that there were kind of three\nmental types and they what they tried to\ndo is like assign them certain kinds of\nelemental values because that's what\nthey saw so the other thing with gafas\nis they're also water so the other way\nyou can think about like you know water\nsort of always finds away so like I\nthink about guffaws is kind of being\nearth in water so water is gonna like\nmove slowly and surely so if you think\nabout the way that like a riverbed\nchanges over time like a river is going\nto like cut into the ground beneath it\nit's gonna be slow and steady so maybe\nthat's a better way to put it slow and\nsteady\nright so we actually have like three\nsort of mental qualities so there are\nthose people that are super dynamic and\nthey kind of get excited about things\nand then they forget about things and\nthen they lose they buy a guitar and\nthen they they don't play the guitar and\nthey're bit those who sort of buy a\nguitar and then kind of like play it for\na while and are sort of driven and\nfocused and then they're coffins that\nare slow and steady so the decision to\nbuy a guitar happens after months of\ndeliberation but once you get a guitar\nyou're gonna like practice like oh like\nevery day for years and years and years\nso the three basic like mental\napproaches okay so the other thing about\nAyurveda is that each person has a\ngeneral like a natural stat in each of\nthese so your Vaught does a certain\nnumber your Guf has a certain number\nyour bit does a certain number and then\nyour diet your environment and other\nfactors can actually alter those levels\nso you can get bata buffs and Botha\ndebuffs and bit the buffs and fit the D\npuffs and cuff up puffs and buffs and\ndebuffs so the second thing that they\nnoticed is that like\nVata people tend to be slim in angular\nright so they noticed like certain\nphysical court correlations like most\npeople who have dynamic minds also tend\nto have like a lot of unnecessary body\nbodily movement so even if you guys like\nlook at me like I move my hands a lot\nwhen I talk like even if you look at my\nhandwriting my handwriting is erratic\nright like so dynamic and erratic like\neven if you look at this II like this\nlittle thing goes beyond the left like\nguffaws are not gonna write like that my\nhandwriting is about that my movement\nserve I thought my mind is about that\nand so like even there are certain\ncharacteristics like my nose is like\nvery angular and curved and sharp so I\nalso tend to be slim like if you look at\nmy arm it's like thin right and so\nRafa's tend to be slim and angular\nbit.this tend to be a medium build and\nthen guffaws or what we call big boned\nright and if you just look at people on\nthe street you'll see that there are\nlike three kinds of people there are\npeople who are sort of heavyset and\nbig-boned there are people who are slim\nand like they can kind of eat whatever\nthey want to and they may get a little\ndad got but they're not gonna like get\nfat right and then there are people who\nlike even if they eat super healthy are\nstill gonna be like pretty like heavyset\nand it doesn't mean that they're fat or\nskinny\nit's like slim or sort of like you know\nbig big boned I mean that's kind of what\nwe call it right there colloquial terms\nand the problem here is that much like\nsuccess our society tends to think that\none is better than the other so we place\nvalue judgments on the pit to build we\nsay that the most attractive people is a\nsociety we place a value judgment and we\nsay that people who are like kind of a\nmedium build not too skinny and not too\nbig bone or actually like the most\nattractive we also have a bit the bias\nwhen we think about success so when we\nthink about the way to be successful we\nthink about being a bit tough so we\nthink like okay you should be like you\nshould study hard and you should like\nlearn fast and you should be focused and\ndriven and be like a fire\nthat's just like you know burning\nconstantly for a long period of time and\nthen eventually you'll become successful\nit's like focus so let's talk a little\nbit about how these different doses\nrespond to stress because I think this\nis a good way to kind of understand like\nwhich one you fall into so vodkas\nrespond to stress by getting worried\nbit.this respond to stress by kid\ngetting irritable and got fussed\nspond respond to distress by getting\nisolated let's say and the other thing\nif we're talking about mental health\nstuff so this is anxiety anger\ndepression okay so if we think about\nlike people they respond to stress in\ndifferent ways okay yeah so everyone has\nall three that's the other thing so it's\njust different levels so like what why\ndo you respond to the most so some\npeople like let's say you know kovat is\nhappening and so some people are gonna\nlike think in different ways so like\npeople who are quarantined some of them\nare going crazy because they're worried\nabout what's gonna happen in the future\nlike they're thinking like oh my god\nlike this is this is awful like I'm\ngonna lose my job this is gonna happen\nthat is gonna happen I'm gonna do this\nI'm gonna do that like they're thinking\nthey're worrying about this they're\nworrying about that this person is gonna\ndo this this person is gonna do this so\nthey worry about all kinds of things bit\nthis start to get pissed they're like\nman this sucks like screw this guy screw\nthis guy screw the quarantine screw\ntrump screw this screw the world screw\nkovat like a screw all about you guys\nsee how those are like fundamentally\ndifferent like some people just get\npissed at everything and some people\nstart panicking about all kinds of\nrandom stuff and those people like\nfundamentally respond to the same\nstressor in like very different ways\nright and then guffaws get sort of\nisolated and depressed and they're like\noh my god this is terrible I sucked\neveryone sucks everything sucks it's not\nworry it's sort of like this sentiment\nof being like depressed and isolated\nthey beat themselves up a lot they're\nnot like worried about the outside in\nthe future they're worried about like\nthis here and now\nso I suck at lie\nI'm not gonna be able to handle Co vid\nyou know look at all these other people\nwho are applying for loans and like\ngovernment programs and I'm not gonna\ntake advantage of those like do you guys\nsee how these are like fundamentally\ndifferent ways to look at stress the\nlast thing that we'll look at is memory\nso vodkas tend to learn quick and forget\nquick bit does sort of have a medium\nmemory in terms of how look quickly\nthey've learned and how quickly favor\ndad and gafas learn slow and never\nforget okay so this is like you know\nwhen some people say oh this person has\na memory like an elephant and and so\nthat's sort of the cuff of memory and\nthen the Vata memory is like super easy\nlike they're super dynamic they kind of\nsavate those are oftentimes perceived as\nwhat we call quote unquote smart so when\nI was in med school like I would you\nknow show up so what you do in med\nschool in the US as you change rotations\nlike every couple of months so you'll do\nlike psychiatry for like six weeks and\nthen you'll do surgery for like three\nmonths and then you'll do you know like\nfamily medicine for a month and then\nyou'll like deliver babies for two\nmonths so you're kind of like moving in\ndifferent fields of medicine so you can\nfigure out what you like and so you can\nalso learn basics of each of those\nthings and so people like I people were\nalways impressed because I seem to learn\nthings very quickly and so people\nthought I was quote-unquote smart it's\nnot that I'm smart it's just that I\nlearned things quickly but then also\nlike two months after I left the\nrotation I would forget everything I\nlearned like I wouldn't remember any of\nit whereas my Kaufer colleagues they\nsort of took some time to kind of get\ngoing right so they sort of had a slow\nacceleration in high top speed vodkas\nhave a fast acceleration in a low top\nspeed and bit those are sort of in the\nmiddle and and you can kind of see that\nin terms of their mental qualities as\nwell okay so it's not that like a Vata\nis better than cough ah our cough is\nbetter than bit or bitna is better than\ncough ah although we do perceive it that\nway when we think about this we think\nthat like bit de is essentially the way\nto be successful\nand so the problem that a lot of people\nrun into is that they try to be bit\nthough when they should be like you\nshouldn't build your strategy to be bit\nthough like you're not a bita so if you\nhave trouble sort of like picking up a\ntask and getting sort of semi excited\nabout it relatively quickly and then\npounding it out day after day after day\nafter day after day like you're not\ngonna be successful so let's look at\nwhat I call the curve of work so how\nshould you structure your life so the\nfirst thing is you figure out and I\nthink there are some resources on our\ndiscord like Ayurvedic tests that you\ncan sort of take to to do some\npersonality analysis and figure out\nwhich one you are so you kind of figure\nout okay am i wrought that person am i\nbit the person or am i cuff a person you\ntry to figure out okay which one likes\ndescribes me the best and then depending\non which one you are you should set up a\ndifferent strategy to become successful\nin life so what are those strategies\nlet's just think through these okay\nso the first thing is I'm gonna describe\nsomething that I call the curve of work\nokay so the vatta's work curve looks\nlike this nothing a bit this work curve\nlooks like this oh crap looks kinda bad\nbut let me try to read you that\n[Music]\nmaybe that was a bit the curve and a\ncough a curve looks like this okay so if\nyou think about like how should these\npeople become successful what we we look\nat this person we say this person lacks\nfollow-through they become bored easily\nand if you guys are wondering like you\nknow if a large percentage of y'all are\nvodka as opposed to fit the ricotta\nthat's not a coincidence\nso electronics actually raise your bata\nso if we think about like the function\nof mind since we started using things\nlike Twitter and reddit our mind has\nbecome more dynamic literally the amount\nof time it spends on a particular\nthought or focus before it moves to the\nnext thought or focus is decreasing\nright so like a hundred years ago like\nwhen people used to live in cabins and\nlike read books and you know like the\npace of society was slower and so their\nmind like was relatively more focused on\na particular thing because you didn't\nyou know there weren't like that many\ndynamic things going on now what happens\nis our mind is like moving faster and\nfaster and faster because there's\nTwitter there's reddit\nokay this post is boring oh my god like\nthis post is like 6,000 words like I'm\nnot gonna read that wall of text let me\nfind something that's like 200 words or\neven something that's like six words let\nme go to Twitter and find like 15 words\nand an image let me find a meme that has\nthree words and an image and then let me\nmove to the next one let me move to the\nnext one let me move to the next one so\nwhere our mind is becoming more Vata\nwhich is why most of the problems that\nwe see that are increasing tend to be\nVardhan related so a good example of\nthis is like ADHD is a very like BOTS\nthe diagnosis it's a mind that\nfluctuates very very quickly so the fit\nthe curve tends to like build up slow\nand then they also like do a good job\nfor a while and then eventually they'll\nwant elect transition careers so if you\nthink about like very successful people\nyou know there's there's a growing\nsentiment that if you stay in one job\nfor 10 years you're not gonna advanced\nas much as if you stay for like two or\nthree years and then move to a different\njob and\nstay for two or three years and then\nmove to a different job and that climate\nperfectly suits the pizza so if it that\ndoesn't stay in one job for 20 years\nthey're like okay what's next\nso there's a strong sense of what's next\nand that can be good and that can be bad\nlike we may think so on average that\nseems to work pretty well in our current\nsociety but it's very possible that bit\ndoes you know move jobs where if they\nhad stayed with that company that\ncompany would have continued to grown\nand become successful and they would\nhave like done a good job and then gafas\ntend to you know ramp up pretty slowly\nbut once they ramped up they can hit\nlike a really high top speed and they\ncan they should really kind of stick\nwith it so the problem is that like\nguffaws are gonna think that oh I should\nmove jobs and really they should stick\nwith it so the people that I work with\nthat are cough is like it takes them a\nyear or two to sort of figure out how\nthe place works and then they start to\nlike really advance and it's really hard\nto stop them once they get going so the\nother way to think about this is a Vata\nis a monkey app it does Tiger and the\nkava is an elephant right and this isn't\nlike it's not like Tigers or better than\nmonkeys or elephants it's just each of\nthese animals has different strengths\nand weaknesses and if you want to be\nlike successful you just need to\nunderstand what your your what your\nstrategy for success is monkey brain\nabsolutely tigers are better than\nLucky's interesting so would you guys\nsay that so let's think about how you\nshould so so how can you structure a\nstrategy for your own success that suits\neach of these throw shots so the biggest\none with Vata is do lots of things okay\nso what I'd say about this is juggle\nlots of balls\nso understand that as a Vata you're\nnaturally going to get bored and when\nyou get bored you should have another\ntask ready for you that you can engage\nin so the biggest problem that vodkas\nhave is they're like okay I'm gonna\nlet's say I'm gonna learn how to program\nand then once they start like for like a\nday or two they're programmed very very\nintensively and they're super\nenthusiastic and they actually make a\nlot of progress right so like I talked\nto people who will say that like I do\n90% of my work in 10% of my time like\nI'll procrastinate till the last minute\nand then in 24 hours I'll write like a\nreally like a pretty good paper like I\nmay get a B but like I'll write a paper\nin 24 hours that takes other people like\nthree months to write I'll just bang it\nout so if you think about that that's\nactually like really amazing right it's\npeople think about that as\nprocrastination and is that like it's a\nbad way to work but if you really stop\nand pause and think about it if you can\ndo three months of work within 24 hours\nthat's actually an amazing skill just\npause and think about that what that\nmeans is that theoretically you could do\nlike one semester in one week and if you\nfigure out how to harness that energy\nproperly instead of college taking eight\nsemesters in four years you could be\ndone in eight weeks like that's what\nvodkas are capable of it's bizarre but\nthe problem is that we don't try to play\nto our strengths we don't try to\nstructure a life that involves intense\nperiods of work\nfollowed by rest so this is the way that\nyou should structure your life if you're\nabout that so I know some authors for\nexample that have like very successful\nVaught that kind of lives where they'll\nlike go to a like they'll go get an air\nB&B in the wilderness for two weeks and\nthey'll write like a hundred thousand\nwords and then they'll come back and\nthey'll spend the next four months\ntrying to write five thousand words and\nthat's / - that's that's fine like you\njust understand how you work and then\nbuild a strategy that sort of basis your\nstrategy should be based on what your\ncognitive style is so let's look at\ntheir curve for success so the curve for\nsuccess of a Vata involves still looks\nlike this but this is where what Matt\ndoesn't need to do is have three\nactivities that they do right and then\nwhat happens is by the time you get\nbored of the third one you're gonna get\ninterested in the first one again and\nthen by the time you get bored of the\nsecond one I mean the first one again\nthen you're gonna go back to this one\nand if you think about it like but over\ntime this is what you guys try to do and\ninstead your productivity could look\nlike this so this is about the\nproductivity and this is what I do so\njust think about like me for a second\nlike I still maintain I'm telling you\nguys I'm super lazy like so lazy and the\nway that I function is I have enough\nrandom stuff in my day to keep me\nstimulated and excited so I do research\nI do clinical work with patients I\nstarted streaming like why do you guys\nthink I did a webinar instead of like\njust continuing to stream or like why\ndid I start why am i doing like\ndifferent random things like more\nlongitudinal stuff instead of interviews\nlike why do you guys think I'd do that\nwhy don't I just do like 15 hours of\ninterviews a day like every day it's\nbecause I find it boring it's like I'm\ngetting tired of streaming streaming is\nboring I want to do something else so\nlet me try this webinar thing and the\nkey thing for Vata is that when you get\nbored of something you want to suit your\nmind one wants to switch to something\nelse but you don't\nactually have to switch to something fun\nthis is the really key thing that you\nhave to understand you don't have to\nswitch to something fun to make your\nmind feel relieved you just need to\nswitch to something else that you find\nsomewhat interesting and that can\nactually still be a productive thing so\nI'd say that like a good example for\nIbaka's not to get a big guitar but get\na guitar buy a book about like poetry if\nyou're interested in that and then like\nget a video game console and then like\nsign up for like a programming seminar\nand the cool thing about that is like\nwhen you're tired of programming you'll\nget like all you need to do is not like\nforce yourself to not play a video game\nit's like okay instead of playing a\nvideo game let me at least pick up the\nguitar or am I ready to pick up guitar\nyet and for some people three may not be\nthe magic number there may be a fourth\none in here right like you don't know\nlike you have to figure out what your\nmagic number is my magic number is like\nfour or five things if I do more than\nfour or five things I tend to like I\ncan't do them all properly and if I do\nlike less than three things it's like\nawful I'm bored all the time and I suck\nat all of them and so is about that what\nyou want to do is like maintain a high\nlevel of success and interest in lots of\ndifferent things and the cool thing is\nthat like over time if you do this for\nlike two years you're actually gonna\nhave a lot of different projects that\nare going well it's bizarre so let's\nthink about fitness strategies for say\nso this is like pretty standard okay\nthis is like discipline so kind of focus\non one thing and then you know I mean I\nfeel like people sort of understand the\nbitthe strategy so focus so don't get\nlike so like for business it's important\nto somewhat learn how to say no\nso this is important for bid those right\nbecause you don't want to take on too\nmuch and like if you're doing too many\nthings like bit those are actually gonna\nstruggle so you have like your variety\nstreamers on Twitch and then you have\nyour streamers on Twitch who play like\nthe same game every single day and they\nplay it for hours and hours and hours\nsome of them may baby cuff actually so\nwe can we can look at that we can\nanalyze streamers if you guys want to\nand then yeah okay so what is their\ncargoes success look like it basically\nlooks like this right so like over time\nspan it's gonna be like that so you're\ngonna have basically like two things and\nthen you're gonna continue and then\nthere's gonna be you know that then the\ngreen curve is gonna start here and then\nlike sometimes like bit this will never\ncome back to the black curve so another\nimportant thing about the the Navotas is\nthat like they come back to the same\nthing so like what VAT does if you want\nto grow in a particular direction\ninstead of digging like a thousand Wells\none foot deep what you want to do is\nlike pick five wells and big dig one\nfoot down in your first well dig one\nfoot down in the second well third\nfourth fifth and after you do the fifth\nwhen you get bored of the fifth thing\nyou may come back to being interested in\nthe first thing and dig your second foot\ndown there right so rotate your\nattention because your mind is dynamic\nbetween different projects with with bit\nthose what you want to do is like keep\nyour attention on one thing and then\nlike gradually transition to something\nelse because you're gonna want to move\nup and out eventually so good examples\nof fit those are like you know I'm\nworking with someone right now who's an\nengineer and like he's been working like\nas a as an electrical engineer for a\ncouple of years and like now he's moving\ninto like finance and management so he's\nlike okay that was fun for a while I\nreally enjoyed it but now I want to like\ndo something different and it's not like\nhe's a Vata where like after six months\nthe bot does like I want to quit my job\nhe's like okay now I'm ready for\nsomething different so if you're a pizza\nyou want to like move you know every\ncouple of years and then let's talk\nabout guffaws so guffaws are\nslow and steady and the main thing here\nis don't get distracted by the success\nof others understand that you're a late\nbloomer if you're a cuppa okay you're a\nlate bloomer\nand so understand that like it's just\ngonna take you more time it doesn't mean\nyou're bad it doesn't mean you're not as\nsmart it's just gonna take you more time\nyour mindset is just like it takes you\nmore time and it doesn't mean that\nyou're bad or worse but the problem that\ncop is the most common problem that I\nsee cop has run into is they compare\nthemselves to either vadas orb it does\nand they say like oh man these people\nare learning this so quickly like I\ndon't know why I'm not like I'm just\nmust be dumb and guffaws what they\nreally need to learn how to do is\nunderstand that it's gonna take them a\nwhile to get up to speed and once you\nget up to speed you're gonna be an\nunstoppable force but like that's your\npath to success\nso if oddly enough you know the guff a\npath to success isn't actually that\ndifferent it's really just ramping up\nand then the key thing is that like over\nhere so I want you guys to like imagine\nthat you're a toughie and then over here\nyou compare yourself to fit those and\nvodkas and what cuff us see as they look\nover here and they're like oh look at\nthe Vata hit their peak over here and\nthe bit they hit their peak over here\nand like I have like so what they do is\nthey're like oh these two people are\nbetter than I am but they're not better\nthan you are they just have different\naccelerations and velocities so as a\ncouple what you need to do is find\nsomething that you like and then stick\nwith it and then like don't get\ndistracted by other people who are\nmoving on to bigger and better things\nbecause you'll do great as long as you\njust stick with what you're doing and\nyou know this idea of like bigger and\nbadder is like just steer clear of that\nthat's the biggest problem"
