    "transcript": "and so I think now is actually a really\nimportant time for learning how to\ncommunicate because unless you learn how\nto communicate things your relationships\nare going to be strained right so let's\nstart by sort of asking why does like\nextended periods of time with certain\npeople lead to like a straining of your\nrelationship whether they be parents or\nloved ones spouses you know we\nquote/unquote need space so if we think\nabout it like why do we need space it's\nbecause there's some kind of build up\nthat is happening in the relationship\nwhere we use coping mechanisms like\ngetting space from someone that causes\nthat build-up to kind of decompress\nright so over time something builds up\nbetween people so question is like what\nis that and chances are usually it's\nlike some degree of emotion so our goal\nin the communication topic today is\nfirst of all to learn how to effectively\nlisten and second learn how to\neffectively speak and what what I mean\nby this is let other people know what's\ninside right and if we think about this\nthis has two parts one is for you to\nknow what's inside because unless you\nunderstand what's going on in you how\nare you going to effectively communicate\nthat to someone else and second is for\nyou to convey it how do I say this\nconvey\nit it being what's inside in a\nnon-judgmental way so like if someone is\nbothering you one of the most effective\nlike communication skills is to let them\nknow how they're bothering you without\nyou causing defensiveness right like\ninstead of saying hey you're really\nannoying you want to be specific about\nin what way they're annoying and this is\nwhy I like emotions sort of has to come\nbefore communication because a lot of\nlike effective listening and effective\nspeaking is knowing you yourself what\nyou're feeling so let's start as we\nusually do by understanding how does\ncommunication normally work okay so what\nI mean by this is generally speaking the\nway that communication works is some\nperson a speaks and then person B speaks\nand then person a speaks again and\nperson B speaks again and person a\nspeaks and person B speaks and so like a\nlot of times what's happening is like\ncommunication is actually waiting for\nthe other person to shut up\nso you can say what's on your mind this\nis how communication usually works and\nif we think about like like so let's\njust use an example of like people with\ndiffering political opinions okay so\nlet's say that this is their sort of\ninternal emotional state for lack of a\nbetter term so person a says you know\nsome kind of political statement right\nand person B doesn't like really listen\nto that statement like as soon as they\nas soon as person a is here person B\nstarts to formulate their response\nright and what they respond to is this\nand then when person B is here person a\nstops listening and doesn't really try\nto understand but then like goes over\nhere and there's all kinds of stuff like\nstraw Manning and different kinds of\nlike political tactics that are used but\ngenerally speaking these people aren't\nreally communicating they're sort of\nmonologuing at each other and if we look\nat what happens emotionally with this so\nlike with the first statement this\nperson gets a little bit pissed right\nand then this person when they hear that\ngets a little bit pissed and then they\nget a little bit more incensed and then\nover here we get even more incensed and\nthen this over here becomes more\nincensed and then over time like the\namount of listening that's happening\nbecomes less and less and less and\nthat's as the emotions build up here\n[Music]\nright like this becomes this is just\nworthless this is not actually\ncommunication it's just like yelling at\neach other and then you get into like\nTwitter Wars where you know everyone\nthinks that they're right and everyone\nthinks that everyone else is wrong and\nno one's really communicating to each\nother with each other and this is part\nof the reason that that political\ncommunication is like so difficult to\nlike it's it's so hard to convince\npeople politically because this is kind\nof dynamic because you're not actually\ncommunicating with anyone you're just\ntalking at them and they're talking at\nyou so how do we change this so way that\nwe change this is by trying to create\nthis situation someone else says\nsomething so we're like how do we change\nthis improve communication so person a\nsays this and what person B needs to do\nis actually say the same thing and then\nperson a will say something else and\nperson B needs to actually say the same\nthing in person a says something else\nand then person B says the same thing\nand so then you may ask a question when\ndo I get to share my opinion\nand the short answer is you don't write\nyou don't get to share your opinion but\nyou're saying but but what about my\nopinion don't I get to speak to the\nshort answer is no because what we're\ngonna teach you first is how to\neffectively listen and when you're\ntrying to effectively listen you're not\ngoing to try to convey your opinion so\nthat's the first thing that I want you\nguys to abandon if you learned this one\na simple principle then your\ncommunication is gonna be doubly\nimproved don't worry you'll get your\nchance later but listening does not\ninvolve sharing your opinion like sort\nof duh but that's not the way that we\nthink we're like a conversation is\nbetween two people right it's like me\ntalking and then them talking and then\nlike us talking together actually if you\nwant to effectively communicate you\ndon't want to have a conversation\neffective communication involves one\nperson speaking and then the other\nperson reflecting okay so how does this\npractically happen so there are two\ntechniques we're going to talk about\ntoday one is reflective listening okay\nand the second is validation and what we\nwant to avoid is our opinion we want to\nand then we avoid our opinion and\nproblem-solving okay these are this is\nwhat we want to avoid and this is what\nwe want to do so what is an example of\nreflective listening let's say someone\ncomes to you and says hey I feel super\nlonely now your response may be like I\nfeel super lonely to actually we don't\nwant to sympathize either I know it\nsounds bizarre so let's think about how\nwe respond so person number one\nsays I'm feeling lonely in person\nnumbers to 2's responses what first of\nall like if we want to be good listeners\nwe're gonna sympathize so we're saying\nI'm feeling lonely too\nor not even - I'm feeling so much more\nloneliness or yeah sure let's stick with\nyou okay so sometimes this leads to one\nupmanship okay the second thing that\nthey can say is why don't you dot dot\ndot\nthey problem solve right this is problem\nsolving and then the third thing is I\nthink you should data thought this is\nsharing your opinion all of these are\nbad so instead what you want to do is\nsay this where how that sucks\nand then what we're gonna do is followed\nby so these two things are followed by\nan inquiry okay can you tell me more\nand then this person what does person\nsay so this is this person is here and\nthen this that's your statement to be\nhere okay then then they say I have\nnothing to do okay\nso then instead of saying okay so we can\ngo this way oh why don't you download\nthis game I think you should do this oh\nyou've got nothing to do wait\nyou hear how little I have to do that's\nbad\ninstead what you say is it sounds hard\nto have nothing to do let's let's do\nthis do you feel that way right and yeah\nabsolutely talking like an NPC is\nabsolutely right and so if you think\nabout this this sounds like super super\nbizarre but if you guys actually listen\nto like my twitch streams this is\nbasically what I do for an hour and a\nhalf right and people like oh dr. K is\nlike such a good communicator yeah it's\nbecause like I don't share my opinion I\njust kind of reflect back what they say\nso they're saying this and you say this\nso validation so reflective listening is\nactually just repeating back their words\nbecause sometimes what will happen is\nthey'll actually you'll reflect\nsomething back and they'll actually\ndisagree with you and so what what\ngenerally happens over the course of\nconversation is you start here or they\nstart here and you start here and then\nas you guys talk past each other they\nstart going this way and you start going\nthis way and then you guys are like\nreally far apart so with reflective\nlistening is they say this and then you\nreflect back and then you start to hear\nthis way but they're saying no actually\nlike and that's not true I don't feel so\nlonely and then you follow them and then\nthey go this way and then you're like oh\nI thought you were there but no let's go\nback over here and then eventually\nsometimes what you can do is you can say\nhey by the way I think you should\nconsider this and then if this is the\ndynamic of communication that you've\nbeen doing they sort of naturally will\nstart to follow you you see that like if\nyou guys have kind of like tied\nyourselves together all of these points\nthen when you suggest something they're\nmore likely to follow you because you've\nbeen following that because human beings\nhave this\nvery simple idea of like mirroring what\nthey do to you if I walk up to someone I\ntell them hey man you suck the other\nperson is gonna be like yeah man you\nsuck too but if I say hey man you're\nawesome what are they gonna do are they\ngoing to say hey man you suck no if you\ntell them they're awesome they're gonna\ntell you you're awesome and so if you\nlisten to them and reflect to them and\nyou make them feel heard they're more\nlikely to listen to you and this is\nwhere like like I don't know if you guys\nI remember reading about you know this\nthis guy who is african-american who\nlike convinced KKK people that like the\nKKK was dumb and the way that he did it\nwas not by like yelling at them and\nbeing like hey KKK people you guys are\nidiots what he did is he like went and\nbefriended them and then like when you\ntake a racist person and like they\nbefriend someone of like you know the\nrace that their discriminatory against\nthey're like well actually like this is\nkind of silly like why I mean this\ndude's pretty cool like maybe all black\npeople aren't bad and and that's because\nthey use this technique not this is the\ntechnique of political argument and all\nthat happens at the end of this is\neveryone thinks that everyone else is an\nidiot and no one changes minds when you\nuse this technique it actually changes\nprofoundly like how people kind of see\nyou and and how they they see themselves\nand that you guys can actually\ncommunicate okay okay so this is how we\nessentially learn to listen better right\nand like you can say but I'm not saying\nanything and like yeah you're not saying\nanything because you're listening like\nthe goal of phase one is not to say\nanything it's just to listen and make\nthem feel heard and make them feel like\nyou guys are on the same page because\nyou are this will also increase your\nunderstanding of their viewpoint because\nyou're not trying to convince them of\neverything so you actually like spend\nthe time to like learn what they say\nright you kind of follow along and then\nyou're gonna deepen your understanding\nof them and here's the thing if you're\nif someone is trying to convince you of\nsomething are you more likely to listen\nto\nthey say if you feel like they\nunderstand you or are you more are you\nmore likely to listen if you feel like\nthey don't understand you and that's\nkind of like it's kind of silly because\nlike obviously if someone understands\nyou you're more likely to listen them so\nthen the question becomes if you want to\nbe an effective communicator how do you\nconvince someone that you understand\nthat right so now we're sort of\ntransitioning to phase 2 which is\nsharing your opinion and sharing your\nfeelings and if you want to convince\nthem if you want them to listen they\nneed to believe you understand them in\ntheir view point not to attack their\nviewpoint right so like when you attack\ntheir viewpoint they're like oh this\nguy's attacking me I don't want to\nlisten to him let's put the walls up and\nI'm like there's a lot of numerous\nstudies that show that when you attack\nsomeone's viewpoint like it doesn't\nmatter how dumb it is or how incorrect\nit is they are going to double down and\nwe'll ignore the more like the more data\nyou present the more convinced they\nbecome that they are right so presenting\ndata and an argument with someone that\nyou disagree with has the opposite\neffect is what people think and then\nlike this is where is is people get\npolitically divided everyone thinks the\nother side is stupid right the\nconclusion conclusion is like people\nwhose support X Y Z are dumb and it\ndoesn't matter you can present as much\ndata as you want to it's like it's gonna\nbe irrelevant it's not gonna change\nanyone's mind the first thing that\nyou've got to do and like if you guys I\nmean I like politics because I think\nit's a good example of how like people\ndon't effectively communicate you don't\nget anywhere so how do you convince\nsomeone that you understand them because\nif you understand them they're more\nlikely to listen to you so even when I\ntalked to like gamers who have went and\nseen mental health professionals\nsometimes what I hear is that like you\nknow the psychiatrist didn't\nunderstand gaming and so what they say\nis I never went back I hear this story a\nlot right so if you guys see how like I\nnever went back is because of this one\nleads to the other so they shot off from\nanything that the psychiatrist's had to\nsay so what we need need to do is we\nneed to start by convincing someone that\nyou understand them because if you\nunderstand them they're likely to listen\nand the way that you do that is by\nfollowing this path right where you just\nstay with them okay so now I'm going to\nask you guys a question\nwhat is the right answer how do you\nreflectively listen to this statement\nI'm a complete piece of crap and I have\nno value in life okay\noption one is know you're amazing you\nare awesome I love you or two sounds\nlike you feel like you're worthless or\nthree I feel really worthless what's the\nwhat's the right response if we're\nreflectively listening\nright so so you guys got it right it\nsounds like you feel like you're\nworthless so this set is really bizarre\nbecause our instinct is that when\nsomeone says oh I'm a worthless piece of\ncrap our instinct is to try to support\nthem and boost them up but that's\nactually so I want you guys to think\nabout this for a second right when I say\nI'm worthless that's me going this way\nand when you say you're awesome which\nwhere you go in you're going this way\ncompletely opposite directions right so\nthen they're gonna think like like it\nand think about this like when you feel\nlike a piece of crap and someone tries\nto reassure you at the beginning so\neventually you can kind of get there so\nwe're gonna kind of table that for a\nsecond but when someone says like yeah\nman I'm really ugly and then someone\nsays like when your parents tell you no\nyou're beautiful\nlike how seriously do you take that\nyou're like screw you like you don't\nunderstand me at all and then like what\ndo you do afterward even though they're\ntrying to be supportive what do you do\nafterward you ignore everything else\nthey have to say because you're like\nthis person doesn't get it\nlike they don't get it so you start by\nstaying with them right you start by\ndoing this and it feels kind of weird so\nthen let's get to phase 2 okay so after\nyou do this for a while so let's say\nlike you give this like 10 or 15 minutes\nsomeone's asking you how long do you\nthat I mean something I'd say somewhere\nbetween 5 and 15 minutes then we get to\nphase 2 which is learn how to\neffectively speak okay so how to\neffectively speak so there are two\ncomponents here one is understanding\nyourself and what do I mean by this like\nif someone at home is irritating you or\nyour friends are irritating you you have\nto understand like why they're\nirritating you if you have done\nlike what's irritating so we had a\ncouple of days ago oh I think we had\nsomeone on stream he was talking about I\nthink it was the set the the dude who\nhad the major setback the PhD student\nand he was kind of saying that like when\nhe was unemployed his parents once every\ntwo weeks would call him and ask him\nhow's the job search going and that\nwould piss him off right I know I\ncertainly felt the same way because when\nI was unemployed and looking for a job\nlike the worst thing to do was when your\nparents ask you for an update and you\nhad no update to give and like I\nremember just thinking like I'll give\nyou an update when I have something\ndecent to say but out of time they asked\nthat question I felt like all of this\navoidance that I was playing so many\nvideo games to ignore the fact that I\ndon't have a job and here they come\nalong and they ask me if I have a job\nand then I can't ignore it that I can't\nignore it anymore stop letting me stop\nmaking me look at it I don't want to\nlook at it right like I'm trying to\nignore it and here you come trying to be\na concerned parent\nscrew you so the first thing is you have\nto understand yourself so you can't if\nyou go to your parents and you say I\nwant you to stop asking me if I found a\njob yet and and then like they're\nthey're not going to understand right so\nyou have to understand yourself so this\nis where like you have to figure out\nokay if you find something frustrating\nand this is gonna happen when you guys\nare stuck with other people at home\nfrustration you start with frustration\nright that's the first thing you're\ngonna feel and then you have to ask\nyourself where does that come from and\n[Music]\nthen you're gonna come up with an answer\nright like because I haven't found a job\nyet and then you ask yourself why does\nthat bother you\n[Music]\nand then you kind of like play some of\nthis game where you try to track back\nlike what's the actual emotion that you\nfeel and then you come back to your\nparents and you say you start by holding\ntheir viewpoints so when you speak this\nis the first thing start with their\nviewpoint okay\nthe other way that you can do this if\nyou guys are having this kind of\nconversation here\nthe other way to do this is to summarize\nwhat they said so you stop right here\nand then you summarize this is also\nholding their viewpoint okay\nor summarize what they've said so you\ncan say something like you know with\nyour parents like let's say that so\nlet's use this job example right so your\nparents tell you I think they asked you\nhave you found a job yet or how's the\njob search going and then you you say\ncan you please stop asking about me that\nquestion it's frustrating and then they\nsay but we're just concerned about you\nlike we just want to make sure you're\ndoing okay and we want to try to help\nyou and that's like that's them going\nthis way and you're like yeah I don't\nwant your help I don't need your help\nI'm fine and they're like yeah but we\nlove you and like we're just a little\nbit worried and then you're like no I'm\nfine everything's okay so you guys are\ngetting further further along so the way\nthat you start is by actually looping\nback around and going here right and\nthen what you do is you say I know y'all\nare concerned are concerned and that you\nlove me period\nI feel like so then then what you would\nyou say something like this I feel\nashamed\nevery time you ask that question because\nI haven't made any progress then you can\nkind of go on to say you know you guys\nasking I'm not saying I know that you\nguys want to ask and that you guys are\nconcerned and you have every right to\nask okay come on\ncan you go to mama Thank You lovey so\nlike when you say like hey every time\nyou ask me about my job I know you guys\nare concerned that I'm doing okay and I\nknow that you all want to help but I\nknow it's bizarre but it actually has\nthe opposite effect of helping what it\nwhat it does is it actually makes me\nfeel more ashamed and it highlights in\nmy mind that like I haven't made any\nprogress and it makes me feel incapable\nso I was hoping that instead of asking\nme like every couple of weeks like maybe\nI could let you guys know when I have an\nupdate for you does that kind of make\nsense like does that sound and they're\nlike when you sit when you do that and\nwhen you kind of tell them every time\nyou ask it's sort of it doesn't actually\nhelp it actually kind of bizarrely it\nhas the opposite effect and I'm trying\nto figure out and then then the so you\nkind of say your piece and then the\nthird thing so remember step one is\nsummarizing okay then step two is say\nyour piece in step three is ask them\nwhat\nthey think now this is the crucial part\nbecause they've said this you've said\nthis they've said this you've said this\nthey've said this and then you switch\nthings up you go over here and now this\nis really really critical because this\nis their opportunity to do one of two\nthings right either they go he etre or\nthey go here and now the tricky thing is\nthat if they go here then what you need\nto do is actually go back here and then\nthey're gonna go here and then you're\ngonna go here and then they're gonna go\nhere and then you're gonna go here so\nyou're kind of back to square one and\nthen you try it again right so then\nthey're over here and then you go here\nand then you check in with them you\nlisten again and then they're gonna go\nhere and you're like okay so then you're\ngonna listen to them for a little while\nright they go here you go here and then\nyou're like all right let's third time's\na charm so you go here and then what\nhappens is something magical is gonna\nhappen they're gonna go here and then\nonce they do that then you move here and\nthen they go here and then you go here\nand then they go here that's right\nthat's it right so then you can move\nthem further along it's getting confused\nokay sorry okay so what I mean by that\nis like so so you listen to what they\nsay and you summarize what they say and\nthen you share your opinion and then\nyou've got to check in with them and see\nif they understand what you said because\nif they just continue thinking their way\nthen you have to stop and you have to\nlike listen to what they say and then\nlike try again but if they don't\nunderstand if they're not able to\nreflect back you can't keep moving\nforward okay\nso draw the maps\nmaybe we'll try that okay so let's say\nthat you know they're over here and\nyou're listening to them and then you\ntry to go over here and one of two\nthings is going to happen either they\nwill go this way or they'll continue\ngoing this way and if they go this way\nif they go this way then you can keep\ngoing and you can keep leaving them\nright that's scenario number one but\nscenario number two is they're talking\nover here so then like you can't keep\ngoing this way you have to have deviate\nand go back this way and then you're\nlike alright let's try this again I\ndon't think you guys get it when you ask\nme questions you think it's helping but\nit's actually hurting and they're like\nno but we love you so much like we just\nwant to help and then they're like yeah\nI don't think you guys get it I know\nthat you feel that it's helping and I\nknow that you're trying to help but what\nI'm telling you is that it's having the\nopposite effect and then eventually\nthey're gonna be like oh you're saying\nit's having the opposite effect and then\nyou're like yes yes that is exactly\ncorrect and they're like oh no but like\nwe love you and then you're like no\ncome back this way and they're like okay\nthis is what communicate effective\ncommunication actually looks like okay\nit's it's a laborious process at first\nbut this is just because this is not how\nwe're trained to speak like once you get\ngood at this you can do it all the time\nit becomes easy okay so let me just\nthink about this okay\nso let's go back to this okay so first\nthing that we've talked about is learn\nhow to effectively listen so what that\nmeans is reflecting a reflective\nlistening and validation and then learn\nhow to effectively speak so the first\nthing is you've got to understand what\nis frustrating for you like I'll give\nyou guys another example like so let's\nsay that someone says a joke that's\noffensive to you and then you say like\nhey man I don't think that's very funny\nand then what's their response their\nresponses oh what's the matter can't you\ntake a joke\nand they're gonna keep saying that and\nthey're gonna think that you're an idiot\nwho can't take a joke until you\nappropriately vocalize what is offensive\nabout that joke to you and that is that\nstarts with a summary right so that\nstarts with a I understand that you\nthink this is just funny because dead\nbabies are like a funny thing to you and\nI sort of get how like if you actually\nhaven't dealt with a dead baby like you\nwould think that that's funny because\nit's sort of crass and it like it's sort\nof like triggers something but I\nactually work in a neonatal ICU where I\ntry to save babies lives and sometimes\nthey die and every time they die it kind\nof like it's hard on me because then I\nhave to go and tell their parents that\nthe baby is dead and that's certainly\nnot funny and so when you talk about\ndead babies like my experience is just\nso different from yours that like that's\nsomething that I struggle with every\nevery day right and like when you\nexplain something like that and like\nlet's say you're in a break room right\nbecause this is where a lot of these\nlike offensive jokes kind of happen and\npeople like oh that's just so funny like\nyou just don't get it\nright like oh like you can't take a joke\nand it's like no man like I want you to\nunderstand where I'm coming from and\nthen you can ask them does that make\nsense to you so this is where even with\nthe dead baby joke right so they're\nstarting here okay so this is dead\nbabies her her right and then you're\nlike oh I kind of get you so this is the\nfirst thing so your instinct is to go\nthis way but you can't go that way what\nyou want to do because you want to go\nlike this you know like yeah I sort of\nget that like you know it's sort of\ncrass and it's kind of like emotionally\nalarming but here is what my experience\nis and then you have to ask them right\nhere sorry you have to ask them right\nhere do you get does so this is the big\nproblems we usually don't say that we\njust assume we're right right\ndoes that\nmake sense to you so anytime you share\nyour opinion you have to ask people to\nyou so like can you actually get here or\ndo you end up over here and if they say\nyeah it makes sense to me or if they say\nlike no I don't quite understand then at\nleast you're evoking that sentiment from\nthem like you're revoking that there's a\ndifference and if you think about it\nlike if someone says yes that makes\nsense to me then either they're gonna\nshut the hell up because then it doesn't\nlike it doesn't make sense for them to\nsay yeah I that makes sense to me and\nthen for them to continue making jokes\nor they're gonna say like no it doesn't\nmake sense to me and then you guys can\nat least agree that you're not on the\nsame place and then you can say can I\ntry to explain it again that's your next\nquestion right so then you're like okay\nI'm with you it is it okay if we go this\nway is that okay and then they're gonna\neither say like something like oh it's\nreally not that big of a deal and they\nmay make some kind of like other sort of\nlike wigglies statement where they try\nto change the subject and then you can\nkind of point that out to them so you\ncan say I I hear you saying that it's\nnot a big deal so once again we're gonna\nreflect okay I hear you saying that it's\nnot a big deal\nbut I don't think you're hearing me\nbecause my whole point that I'm trying\nto explain to you is that it actually is\na big deal to me are you understanding\nthat this is actually important to me\nand then usually at that point they just\ntuck their tails between their legs and\nthey run away because you've dominated\nthem and and so someone is asking what\nif they're right so this is not so I\nwant you guys to understand this for a\nsecond which of these sides is right\nright like is this right or is this\nright\nthere's no rightness or wrongness\nthere's no rightness or wrongness here\nlike this is where there's no sense of\nright or wrong this is about being on\nthe same page or not being on the same\npage okay\nit's about like communication is not\nabout right or wrong you got like your\ngirl got to understand this very\nimportant okay this has nothing to do\nwith right and wrong and if you think\nthat this has to do with right and wrong\nyou're missing the entire point the\nwhole point of the communication\nexercise is to go from here to here the\npoint of the communication exercise and\nlearning how to communicate is so that\nthis doesn't happen\nwe're not presuming any kind of\nrightness or wrongness so someone's\nasking how would you respond if they if\nthey say they don't care so then you can\nsay like I mean I would reflect that\nback to them right so that like that's\ngonna make them sound like an so\nyou can say so so it sounds like you\nbasically don't have any sense of caring\nabout what I think or feel and that like\ngenerally speaking the opinions of some\npeople or their experience of life is\ncompletely irrelevant to you right you\njust reflect back if they say I don't\ncare man if you want to get bent out of\nshape you can get bent out of shape and\nthen you can say yeah so it sounds like\nyou really don't care if you go around\nlike upsetting other people or like\nimpacting their lives in a negative way\nand then they say yeah man I don't care\nand then like who's the at the\nend of that right so like I think once\nagain it's its reflection summary\ninquiry so this is our this is our\nsummary okay and we'll go to questions\nso I'm gonna cue people up for questions\nwhile we're summarizing so we're gonna\ndo Luca the loped shawl and tadeas\nand here's our summary so step one is\nreflection step two is inquiry actually\nlet's say summary so you guys get that\nyou have to reflect a lot okay so maybe\nactually step step two is reflection\nstep three is reflection right and at\nthis point they feel you understand then\nwhat happens is summary so you summarize\ntheir point you don't try to pick it\napart you don't disagree with them\nremember like if you're trying to\nconvince them from the get-go this is\ngonna fall apart the goal here is not to\ndominate them or convince them or poke\nholes in their argument\ntheir goal is genuinely to understand\nbecause if you're actually going over\nhere but you're pretending to go over\nhere that's not going to work you\nactually need to be with them and try to\nput yourself in their shoes and if you\ndo this well then they are really\nconfident you understand them and now\nthey're primed they're right then what\nyou do is inquire are you willing to go\nthis way with me and then if they say\nyes then you make your point or share\nyour perspective is maybe a better way\nto put it and then either they're gonna\ngo this way\nor they're gonna go this way and then\nyou have to either either things or\ncheck you're done and then you can even\nask them a question like ask them to\nsummarize right because then if they\nsummarize well then you were really\nconfident that they understand you and\nthen you guys are on the same page and\nthe way you ask them to summarize is can\nyou tell me what you heard like can you\ntell me what you understood for and what\nI said like what did you understand like\nwhat did you catch about what I said and\nso then when you ask them to summarize\nlet's say you're going like so they're\nthey're going this way and soon you're\nlike okay and let's go this way they're\nlike sure let's let's go that way so\nthey go this way and then they they like\nget halfway there and they start going\nover here and then you're like a real\nword hold on\nthis is what I was kind of saying can\nyou follow me and then you ask them to\nsummarize again and they're like oh yeah\nso you said this this and this but then\nI thought you were saying this and then\nyou're like no no man this is what you\nheard this is what you heard me say but\nwhat I'm really saying is this and\nthey're like okay now I got right so\neach of these points is kind of like the\nsummary happens kind of over here and\nthen if you guys deviate at some point\nyou got to come back to this and is it a\nlaborious process absolutely but I want\nyou guys to think about this for a\nsecond how laborious like a political\nconversation where you disagree with\nsomeone is just as laborious it just\nfeels better and you feel more righteous\nand it accomplishes less but you can\nspend just as much effort doing\ncommunicating the other way and you're\njust not going to get anywhere like it\ndoesn't it doesn't really matter so I\nthink this is way better so hopefully\nthat's helpful okay let's do questions I\n[Music]\ntried to or people not Luka I've got\ntime for maybe two questions okay Judith\nDennis and Salvatore"
