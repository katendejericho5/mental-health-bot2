    "transcript": "okay I think we're good now so it looks\nlike we are able to screen share there\nwe go okay we back sorry about the\ntechnical difficulties guys let's go\nahead and dive in okay I'm still just my\nmind is boggled that like I do this\neveryday and I set it up the same way\nevery day and sometimes it works and\nsometimes it doesn't it's like if I\nconnect to reflector and then it like\ngoes into sleep mode it like can never\nconnect again no matter how many how\nmuch we do that's okay we can lose\nviewers okay so let's start with\nemotions okay\nso this is what we're talking about\ntoday so we're gonna start off actually\nby thinking a little bit about behavior\nand how we work so a lot of times we're\ngonna dip a little bit into mechanics of\nmind so a lot of times we make decisions\nright but then the question is what goes\ninto decisions so like what are the\ncomponents of decisions so sometimes\neven if something is irrational it may\nnot eat just because something is is\nrational doesn't mean that it is\nactually that you do that thing so\nyou're even if you something is\nrationally a good idea it doesn't\nnecessarily mean that you do it so what\nare the three things that kind of go in\ndecision-making one is rational and\nthere are habits and other stuff that\nwe're not going to get to today but\nthese are essentially components of the\nmind so even if you know something is\ngood rationally you may have an emotion\nthat keeps you from doing it so a good\nexample of this is social anxiety so\nlet's say that like in social anxiety\nyou know rationally you can say everyone\nlikes me because they're your friends\nright so let's assume that you're going\nout with your friends and then but your\nemotions say no one likes me\n[Music]\nokay and the third thing that makes\ndecisions for you the third part of your\nmind is your ego or sense of identity\nbut then this then you have this kind of\nthought I am an unlikable person and so\nthese are I mean the other kind of\nemotional thought is like another way to\nthink about this is this may not even be\na thought necessarily it's just you know\na sense of fear or worry so this this\ncould actually be an ego ego statement\nas well the point here is that like\nthese are the three things that happen\nright so you have like physical\nsensations of anxiety you have kind of\njust this emotional you have like a pit\nin your stomach or you have sweaty palms\nor things like that and so all three of\nthese things are in conflict and so a\nbig problem is that you know when I work\nwith people and technologies social\nmedia gamers etc they say I know what I\nneed to do but I just can't do right you\nknow you need to study you know you need\nto apply for a job so this is part of\nset with the question is this is\ninsufficient to get you guys to do what\nyou need to do and so the question is\nlike what do we do about that right like\nI can sit here and then like the problem\nis that youth like when you think about\nyour problem solving strategy here you\nfocus on number one rationality number\ntwo rationality and number three\nrationality right number four maybe you\nwork on habit five willpower you can do\nall kinds of stuff over here actually\nbut most of the arguing that you do with\nyourself is in your head and\nand is on an intellectual level but\nthat's kind of insufficient because the\nproblem actually is not here the problem\nis here or here and we don't really get\ntrained to deal with these two things so\ntoday what we're gonna talk about is\nemotions okay\nso question is if you're unable to do\nwhat you want to chances are it's not\nthe rational that's holding you guys\nback because in my experience most like\ngamers and like you know people tend to\nbe smart it's not an issue of IQ it's an\nissue of like not understanding that\nthere are things holding you back in\nyour mind that are irrational because if\nit you know that those are those are\nemotions so so then let's think about\nyou know why or why is it hard to deal\nwith emotions so why are emotions\nhard to deal with so the first reason is\nbecause most of us are Alexa thymic in\nalexithymia is the inability to\ndetermine your internal emotional state\nso a lot of gamers that I talked to say\nthat they're in control of their\nemotions they feel like they're in\ncontrol of their emotions and when I\nkind of ask them like what do you mean\nby that\nand they'll say like okay so so give me\nan example of being in control they're\nsaying like I can watch a sad movie and\nI won't cry I can watch a scary movie\nand I won't feel scared\nI like tend to be you know like emotions\ndon't affect me I can go to the funeral\nand like I'll be sad but I'm not gonna\nbe like crying like other people and so\nwhat they mean by in control you're not\nreally in control of your emotions\nyou're just suppressing them and the\ninteresting thing about emotions is if\nwe look at the brain our emotions\nessentially we can turn up the volume or\ndown the volume on our emotions\naffects all emotions so if we look at\nlike gamers this is also why they don't\nfeel that positivity like they look at\nother people and they're like wow that\nperson really has a zest for life I\ndon't have a zest for life I feel kind\nof stuck I feel like a lack of\nfulfillment and part of that is because\nyou know imagine there are different\nlike channels right so they're different\ntwitch channels you can watch but if\ntwitch is muted it doesn't matter what\nkind of twitch channel you're watching\nyou're not gonna be able to hear what\nyou know what they're saying you're\ngonna get you like just a fraction of\nwhat other people are capable of feeling\nbecause your emotions are just turned\nall the way down if the question is why\ndo we suppress our emotions and or why\nare our emotions suppressed so then the\nquestion is why suppression there are a\ncouple reasons for this one is that it's\nadaptive and protective so a lot of\ngamers will have various things that\nhappen to them when they're young um\nthat that the emotions hurt and when\nyou're young unless you have someone who\ncan help you navigate those emotions\nyou're going to learn how to suppress\nthem especially through video games so\nlet's say go sample is you get bullied\nyou know you have abusive neglectful\nparents is another good one or people\naround you then even if you don't get\nbullied and you don't want to have\nabusive or neglectful parents you have\nparents that talk about your potential\nand how smart you are and then this\nactually makes you feel what right it\nmakes you feel bad unless it makes you\nfeel good and the question is what what\nwhat is this bad it makes you feel shame\nmakes you feel fear that you can't\nlive up to expectation and so then the\nquestion is like when they tell you\nyou're such a smart kid so like if the\nodd thing is that even parents can be\nsort of like loving and kind it's just\nlove is not a substitute for like\nemotional competence right they can be\nsupportive or do what they think is\nsupportive and it can still place a\nburden on you this is why like we all\nhave kind of little emotional traumas or\npsychological complexes or some scars\nand it doesn't mean that our parents did\na bad job it just means that we weren't\ntaught how to deal with them like deal\nwith the what they did to us and what\nthey did to our psyche so if we think\nabout it like we don't want to feel this\nso what we end up doing is all of this\nresults in suppression because if you\nsuppress then it goes away so how do we\nsuppress okay first is video games so\nthere are studies that show that when\nyou play a video game it does a couple\nof interesting things there are there\nthe two parts of the brain that are sort\nof govern emotional and especially a\nnegative emotional experience or the\namygdala and hippocampus okay\nso when we're feeling bad these two\nparts of our brain are like kind of lit\nup and so these two parts of our brain\nare lit up whenever we're feeling bad\nand then when we play a video game\nthere's studies that show that the\nactivity in these regions actually end\nup getting the activity goes down so\nwhen we play video games these turn off\nand when we spend a lot of time playing\nvideo games we learn how to turn these\nthese things off and they they start to\nturn off all the time\nwe also suppress the rest of our\nemotions so we kind of get that\ndopaminergic satisfaction from playing a\nvideo game so it's kind of like\nrewarding and addictive but it doesn't\nmake you feel happy or excited do you\nguys get that so video games reward us\nwithout necessarily like creating\npositive emotion so there there are like\nmoments of positive emotion in video\ngames right like you can like win a\nmatch of like let's say you're you're\ndown and League of Legends or something\nand then you guys they could come back\nand then you feel like excitement at the\nend and there's there is somewhat of an\nemotional rollercoaster when you play\nthose games there's also a lot of rage\nin Tulsa City that bubbles up and if you\nthink about it like if you don't really\ncare about a game of League of Legends\nlike why is it that you feel so\nfrustrated or toxic or angry with your\nteammates it's because you have this\ngigantic pile of emotions that are like\nthat you've been suppressing for a while\nand it starts to come out so if we\nreally look at video games what they\nactually train us to do is suppress our\nemotions\nthat's neurologically like what they do\nto our brains they just turn off those\nparts of our body and then what happens\nis like if a brief a part of our body is\nturned off if we shut off a part of our\nbrain we lose competence with that part\nokay so let's think about this like good\nexamples of this or forgetting a\nlanguage other things are like you know\njust skill decay in general like whether\nit's like learning that forgetting to\nplay music or you know forgetting\ncertain information or knowledge and\nremember the brain is an efficient organ\nso if it's not using some thing it's\ngonna like stop prioritizing it so over\ntime is\nvideo games or other forms of like\nsocial media or technology suppress our\nemotions suppress our emotions suppress\nour emotions then we like forget we\ndon't understand what we're feeling\nanother important part about suppression\nis kind of cultural so there's a\ncultural impact and what do I mean by\nthat and maybe actually if we think\nabout it what I should do is this take\nthis move it down here okay we're gonna\ntake this up here so this is a second so\nwhy do we suppress because of a cultural\nimpact to so men are taught to suppress\nmost emotions right so if you think\nabout the traditional like guys locker\nroom right like we don't express shame\nor fear we're basically taught to only\nexpress one emotion which is anger and\nso like you know when when when you get\nrejected by a girl if you say like yeah\nI'm if you tell your bros that you're\nlike yeah I'm afraid that I'm never\ngonna be loved and that like no one will\never love me like no dude says that\nright when you get when you ask her girl\nout she says no that's not what you say\nbecause you don't even understand that\nyou feel that like you feel some sense\nof badness and then you get pissed and\nyou're like yeah [ __ ] her you know like\nand then your bros are like they're\ncompletely fine and they get like toxic\nand they're like yeah like she sucks\nlike forget about her man like you're\nbetter than that like all this kind of\nlanguage but we don't talk about what\nyou actually feel so we suppress fear\nshame you know all these kinds of other\nemotions like we even suppress sadness\nlike you don't tell your friend like hey\nyeah man I'm feeling like super sad\ntoday you're you know what what we do is\nwe like so we detect these emotions\nwithin each other we recognize them and\noftentimes men use physical language\nto express emotion so we don't know like\nwe don't know these words these are like\nquestionable toss but physical language\nwere very familiar with like how did it\nfeel when she dumped you man felt like a\nkick in the nuts you say that and then\nall your you're like I friends are like\nyeah man I know exactly what you mean\nright when you saw her for the first\ntime how did she make you feel I felt\nbutterflies in my stomach right so\nthat's like a physical representation of\nall kinds of emotions apprehension\nexcitement vulnerability right this is\none that especially men don't talk about\nyou feel vulnerable you feel exposed\nthere are all kinds of emotions that go\ninto this you just don't know what they\nare and so this kind of like this leads\nto a big problem because not only are\ngames reinforcing our brain to not\nexperience or understand emotion but\nthen we also have like all of these\nphysical sensations because the emotion\nis gonna come out in some way so your\nbody is psychosomatic and what I mean by\nthat is that your mind and your body are\nconnected and so like physical thing\nental representations are gonna have\nphysical effects and physical effects\nare gonna have mental representations\nand what do I mean by that like if\nyou're sick mentally how it like if you\nhave the flu mentally how do you feel\nyou feel crappy right mentally you feel\ncrappy you don't feel interested in\nthings things aren't quite as fun like\nyou don't even like anger and\nirritability and stuff like that is\ngonna all kind of be suppressed and on\nthe flip side if you're mentally not\nfeeling well that's gonna manifest with\nokay\nwhere is where is the rest of my family\nthere's the family can you close the\ndoor thanks I'm so\nso what was I saying yeah so mentally\nyou're gonna have physical\nrepresentations too so if you feel\nanxious like you have to if you have\nworried thoughts in your head the other\nday when we talked about anxiety we\ndidn't really talk about physical\nanxiety but it's gonna have physical\nsenses sensations right yeah where my\nteammates is right and so these two\nthings are intrinsically linked and men\ntend to experience a lot of emotion\nphysically like if I asked someone what\nemotions are you feeling right now\nthey're gonna say I don't know but if I\nask them physically what do you say\nthey're gonna they're gonna definitely\nbe able to say things like pit in my\nstomach tightness in my chest\n[Music]\netc and then oftentimes on stream or\nafter meditation I'll ask them what\nhappened to the pin in your stomach what\nhappened to the tightness in your chest\nand people will feel better it'll feel\nless so we're actually gonna hang on to\nthis we're gonna bring it down okay and\nnow we're gonna go to the next service\nand then the question is how so the\nfirst thing that we've got to do so\nlet's assume that all this is true right\nso let's go back to this for a second\nand remember that our goal here is to\nmake better decisions or not make better\ndecisions to implement better decisions\nand so if we think about what's keeping\nus from implementation it is actually\nit's not that rationally we don't know\nwhat to do it's that emotionally we're\nnot sure what to do or like our emotions\nare controlling part of part of our\nbehavior so that's why this is important\nso the first thing to understand is that\nwhy is it hard for us to function\nemotionally and that's because we're\nLexA finding we literally like it's hard\nto control something or deal with\nsomething if you don't know what it is\nor where it is so the first thing to\nunderstand is that we're Alexa thymic\nwhich means that we don't understand\nwhat our emotions are and if we don't\nunderstand what they are you can't do\nanything about it because good diagnosis\nprecedes good treatment actually there\nare some things you can do but it's it's\nineffective\nit's not like a long-term strategy and\nso why are we Alexis I make that has to\ndo with a lot of our brain and using\nsome technological tools that create\nsuppression and the more our brain gets\nsuppressed the more we become color\nblind to our internal emotional state\nwe're also for the most part especially\nmen more so than women are culturally\nlike taught to not understand or express\ntheir emotions so not only do we have\ntechnology but we also have this\ncultural impact and that results in our\nour feelings of alexithymia so the\nquestion is what do we do about it right\nfine dr. K I accept everything you're\nsaying what do I do about alexithymia\n[Music]\nit's allergies not covet guys don't\nworry so the first thing is to recognize\nthat you are feeling an emotion we're\nnot even going to try to define it yet\nthe first thing that you've got to do is\nfigure out oh there like it there are\nemotions at play here okay there are\nsome things that you can do to clue\nyourself in what that emotions are at\nplay and what are those things okay so\nthe first thing is physical sensations\n[Music]\nso let's say you're waiting for like a\njob interview or you wake up one day and\nyou know that your parents are gonna\ncall and you feel stuff okay that's why\nI've been hanging on all that for all\nthis time so the first thing is physical\nsensations so if you start to feel\nphysical sensations understand that\nthere is an emotional equivalent so this\nis a clue\nthat you're feeling something so then\nyou can go look for it right so we can\nleverage our rational mind to\nhypothesize what we could be feeling\nokay the second thing that the second\nclue is umbrella terms and what do I\nmean by that we have ways of conveying\nin general that we don't feel good\nstressed frustrated overwhelmed and\nunfortunately nowadays anxious a anxiety\nhas become a catch-all term for all\nkinds of emotions now it's not even\nnecessarily worried and so a lot of\ntimes since we don't have the resolution\nto capture the emotion we're aware that\nwe feel stressed but like what does that\neven mean like what does it mean to feel\nstressed like what is the emotion that\nyou're experiencing when you're stressed\nand there are all kinds of things there\ncould be like uncertainty around the\nfuture there could be fear that you're\ngonna fail you're you're gonna lose your\njob there could be concern that people\nare gonna ostracize you there are all\nkinds of things right you could be\npissed off at someone you could be\nashamed about something like Oh\neveryone's gonna find out that you're an\nimpostor all of these things like like\nyou say that you're stressed and then\nyou someone asks you how's work going\nand you say work sucks sucks is another\ngood one right what does that mean like\nwhat's bad about work what is the\nnegative emotion that work causes you to\nexperience is it a is it a sense that\nyou were being taken advantage of or is\nit that you were victimized is it that\nyou feel powerless is it that you feel\nhopeless there are all kinds of things\nthat that could make work suck but we\ndon't understand so that's the first\nthing that we've got to do is recognize\nwhen we're feeling emotion and these are\nour clues so step one is recognize that\nyou're feeling an emotion\nstep two is try to diagnose that emotion\nokay and so then what we do is we say\nlike okay we take something like stress\nand then we're gonna hypothesize so you\ncan do something like you know you can\nask yourself okay about shame fear anger\nsadness what else\nhope or hopelessness feelings of power\nor agency or powerlessness right any of\nthis stuff could be going on and then\nlike literally go down the list and then\nask yourself so I do this on stream and\nyou guys may grieve that's another good\none right so regret that there's another\ngood one there all kinds of yeah so so\nand someone saying that frustration is a\nlower form of anger I completely agree\nso frustration is like mini anger and\nthen another one oh this is another\numbrella term embarrassment it's usually\nshame right so we have like lighter\nversions we've got the diet version of\nshame which is embarrassment we've got\nthe diet version of anger which is\nfrustration and so like you if you're\nfeeling stressed out you just literally\nyou ask yourself are you feeling any of\nthese and you can like literally just go\nthrough the list and then if that\ndoesn't work there's even another option\nthat you can do so this is one thing\nthat you can do if that doesn't work you\ncan ask yourself what would someone in\nmy situation feel and the crazy thing is\nthat we're way better at asking this\nquestion okay and this has to do with us\nbeing sort of more cognitively empathic\nthan emotionally empathic two kinds of\nempathy cognitive empathy and emotional\nempathy\nemotional empathy is what we sort of\nthink of as regular empathy like you're\nsomeone who has a lot of empathy but\nthen there's another kind of empathy\nwhich is cognitive so it's not that you\nactually feel what other people are\nfeeling it's that you can rationalize or\nanalyze what someone else would be\nfeeling so you can like sort of\nanalytically predict emotions but you\ndon't actually feel them and so if you\nask yourself what would someone else in\nmy situation feel like if someone was\napplying for a promotion and they they\nmay not get it because there were two\nother candidates who maybe are more\nqualified how would they feel they feel\nmaybe a shame they feel hopeless they\nfeel powerless and so if you ask\nyourself what someone else would be\nfeeling you can get like you can check\noff a couple things oh maybe it's this\none maybe it's this one maybe it's this\none maybe they feel regret because they\ncould have worked harder earlier there\nare all kinds of things okay\nso then once you sort of figure out okay\nlike maybe I'm feeling shame maybe I'm\nfeeling hope maybe I'm feeling power\npowerlessness then the question is how\ndo I deal with it okay so now the\nquestion is like okay let's say you go\nthrough this process and you understand\nthat you're Alexa thymic and you figure\nout okay maybe this is what I'm feeling\nhow do we actually check this box so\nthat your decisions aren't as impacted\nby your emotions so the short answer is\nthat you have to process it so I want\nyou guys to recognize that like in your\ndecision-making process\nwe have rational thoughts - emotions and\nthen let's say + - ego equals decision\nright or not even decision maybe if\nactually action is maybe better and so\nwhat that means is that like you can\nincrease this variable as much as you\nwant to right but if this variable is\nlike you want to decrease this and then\nyour action will be what you want in the\ncase of negative emotions the opposite\nis also true right we can have emotions\nlike head over heels in love\n- rational thought + - ego equals action\nso this is also true right so head over\nheels and love is the emotion and then\nthe rational thought is person is not\ngood for me right we can think these\nthings - and this is absolutely a common\noccurrence but my point is that these\ntwo things are oftentimes opposed and\nthen sometimes they're not opposed right\nand when they're not opposed then action\nbecomes very easy so when your your\nrational mind and your emotional mind\nare aligned if your ego is also aligned\nor your identity's line then action\nbecomes easy and this is the thing that\nI want you guys to understand like a big\npart of what I advocate for so people\nthink that you need remember y'all\nsolution is this this is a crappy\nsolution in my opinion like sure habits\nare good sure willpower is good but what\nI'm saying is just make the decision\neasier for yourself by reducing this\nvariable if you reduce the impact of\nthis or you reduce the impact of this\nthen your decision making process is\ngoing to get way easier it's just gonna\nlike\ndon't need willpower if your emotions in\nyour rational thought are aligned so if\nyou digest your emotions like decisions\njust start to become easy for you like\nit's just easy I don't know how else to\ndescribe it it's just easy\nso for example when my kid walks in I\nexperience different emotions I\nexperience some amount of joy and I\nexperience some amount of frustration\nand whether I let those emotions control\nme or not depends on my awareness of\nthose emotions so if I just recognize\nand I'm like okay you know like I'm\nfeeling a little bit annoyed and then\nlike that thing loses power over me okay\nso how do we process it so the question\nis how does this happen\nhow so the first thing awareness and\nthis is because awareness proceeds\ncontrol you cannot control that which\nyou are unaware of just think about that\nfor a second okay if you've ever had\ndental work done and you've had your\nmouth numbed up your control over the\nnumb of your mouth just goes out the\nwindow like you can try to control it\nyou can sort of move your tongue around\nbut like your capacity to control it\nproperly and not bite your tongue if\nyour tongue is numb like you can sort of\nroughly direct it but you lose all of\nyour fine like motor capability you lose\nall of your precision so I want you guys\nto realize that you're moving through\nlife without any kind of emotional like\ncontrol emotional precision or any\ncontrol like that is precise over your\nemotions so your emotions are just\nrunning amok within you and as your\nemotions start to run amok and they're\njust doing whatever the hell they want\nyou then the only solution that you know\nhow to do is just turn it off right it's\nlike if I can't control like what\ndirection like let's say I turn on a\ngarden hose and there's a lot of water\ncoming out of the garden hose the garden\nhose is going all over the place and\nthis is how you feel like when you try\nto ask a girl out or you go you apply\nfor a job or your parents ask you how\nyou're doing or whatever like there are\nall kinds of situations that just turn\nup the emotional knob and then there's a\ngarden hose that's like just flopping\nall around getting everything wet and\nthe only solution you have is to turn\nthe water off you go and replay video\nand so you're just like oh my god I\ncan't deal with this I can't deal with\nthis like I'm gonna go home\nthat's all you can do so you have to\nbecome aware right you have to\nunderstand where the garden hose is you\nhave to understand where you know when\nthe water is coming out and like just\nthink about this for a second how easy\nis it to control the water out of a\ngarden hose if you're holding it with\nthree fingers right the amount of effort\nthat's required to actually control the\nwater flow out of a garden hose is\nminimal provided you're actually holding\nit in the right place right like does\nthat make sense to you guys it's like\nit's actually quite easy you just need\nprecision and this kind of comes back to\nthis like I don't like it when people\nuse willpower because willpower is an\nimprecise solution I don't know what the\nI don't know what the analogies is with\nthe garden hose I'm just saying that\nlike controlling something once you're\naware of it and you understand how to\nhold it properly becomes very very easy\nand so that's what I really think you\nguys should focus on so the first thing\nis to become aware of as crazy as this\nsounds this accounts for like do I\nactually write out like honestly between\n25 and 40 percent in my estimation just\nbeing aware something accounts for 25 to\n40 percent in some cases some believe\nthat this is sufficient for 100% I think\nover time it is like right now when I\nwhen I felt my emotions I just felt them\nand then they went away oh you\nacknowledge it and it's gone so once you\ntrain yourself it can get close to a\nhundred percent but let's start with\nit's gonna at the beginning account for\n25 to 40 percent and I know that's crazy\nall you need to know is what the problem\nis and you can think about that like you\nknow awareness precedes control is\nanother example of diagnosis precedes\ntreatment and I say this all the time\nand I think it's a beautiful lesson to\nlearn from medicine is that it's hard to\ntreat a disease that you've been\nproperly diagnosed and so like diagnosis\nis half the battle like treatment\nafterward it becomes relatively easy if\nyou have a problem with your car and\nyou're just saying like yeah my car is\nbusted and then like you take it to a\nmechanic in the car is like and then the\nmechanic is like what's wrong with it\nyou're like yeah I don't know it's\nbusted\nwhereas if you say yeah I mean whatever\nI drive I hear this clunky sound or it\nmakes this noise or one of the tires\nseems way smaller than the others\nyou guys can clearly tell that like\nawareness of the problem is very very\nefficient at solving the problem the\nsecond thing that you can do is work on\nthe body okay so what I mean by that is\nwe know we are physical sensations so\nthis is where you can do stuff\nphysically so I think this is why Yoga\nis good so yoga improves anxiety\ndepression and by the way this is not\njust because it's physical so this is a\nmind-body practice so in clinical trials\nyoga tends to outperform exercise so\nexercise is great for anxiety and\ndepression but evidence suggests that\nYoga is superior in even some amounts of\ntrauma so I've worked with some people\nwho like will do sort of yoga informed\ntrauma programs and it seems to help a\nlot so in addition to therapy and stuff\nthey add yoga and somehow like we don't\nknow exactly how it works but we do have\nclinical evidence we have scientific\ntrials where that will take a hundred\npeople with anxiety and we'll have 50 of\nthem do yoga 50 of them do exercise and\n50 of them do nothing and we'll compare\nthe results and what we'll find is that\nexercise and yoga outperform nothing in\nyoga performs outperforms exercise in\nsome studies so what we mean by that\nit's like work on the body so they're\nalso meditative techniques that\nspecifically work on the body so I think\nyoga is a good example of one but\nanother thing that I recommend people do\nis that they breathe into the emotion\nokay so like if you're feeling so we can\nkind of do this very quickly okay so if\nyour feet whole months right\nso if you're feeling\n[Music]\nif you're feeling a tightness in your\nchest or a pit in your stomach or\nconstriction in your throat then all I\nwant you to do is just breathe into that\nspace so when you breathe in notice that\nyou can feel the breath in your body\nlike you can focus on the temperature\nand you can kind of feel the cool air\nkind of going down and into your body\nand literally what I want you to do is\nbreathe in to the tightness in your\nchest and then breathe out so it's\nactually relatively simple you just\nfocus on that sensation with your\nattention and then you breathe into it\nand then you breathe out you breathe in\nthat coolness and you breathe out the\nwarmth like you breathe out that\nnegative energy and that technique is\nactually pretty good like it literally\ndissolves the emotion within you because\nremember guys that the the physical\nsensation that you have correlates is\nsomewhat equivalent to the mental\nemotion right so if we reduce this then\nwe're going to reduce this that's just\nhow it works and then so we can work on\nthe body then the third thing that we\ncan do is is sort of met work on the\nmind what I mean by this so therapy is a\ngood example of processing emotions but\nyou can also have like conversations\nwith friends you can work so like you\nknow this is why what we're training\nrecovery coaches to do so recovery\ncoaches you can like talk to people on\nour discord just trying to think about\nwhat's available to you guys right talk\nto people on discord\nand so like you can you can also do\nother kinds of you know processing\nactivities like you can join a men's\ngroup or a women's group I pick men\nfirst because I think our audience is\nstill like 70% male you can just submit\na support group it doesn't even have to\nbe gender specific you know if you've\ngot an addiction problem then you can do\nsomething like refuge recovery or AAA or\neven if you're addicted to video games\nyou can do CGA a I mean they're a good\norganization I don't really agree with\ntheir methodologies but not to say that\ntheir methodologies are wrong it's just\nnot what I choose to do so like you know\nyou can do and you can also meditate for\nsure you can also do other exercises\nlike journaling or like writing reflects\nur sizes right so like Jordan Peterson's\nself authoring program I think has a lot\nof emotional processing that kind of\ncomes along with it I would imagine so I\ndon't really know too much about the\nprogram but yeah so that there's like\nthis kind of stuff right so then like\nlike then people kind of ask how do I\ndeal with these emotions like this is\nhow you deal with them first you notice\nthem second you work on the body and\nthird you work on the mind and so let's\ngo ahead and take we're gonna have time\nfor a couple of questions okay so we're\ngonna do mani Seth\nTony and Connor and we'll do two\nquestions okay\n[Music]\nit looks like we've got Connor oh hey\nhey so you can give the example of Alexa\nmake thick there any other examples of\nemotions besides that what do you mean\nbesides what uh one example that you\ngave Alexa mythic yeah Alexa thymic yes\nthe next by mimic what other emotions\nbesides that are there if well so\nalexithymia is not an emotion\nalexithymia is being color blind to your\nemotion yes yes sir does that here\nquestion I think the emotions are like\nfear shame anger frustration grief\nregret and the problem with people who\nare Alexa thymic is that they can't\ndetect any of them mm-hmm does that work\nyeah yeah I think does that answer your\nquestion yeah so is it so is it with\nlike we talking about the brain is there\nlike a like a different set of like that\nkind of philosophy or is it just that\nparticular what do you mean by jet in\nthe brain is there a different set of\nphilosophy um let me think like um so\nyou give the example is there um let me\nthink Israel uh I don't know exactly\nwhat I'm trying to say do I think okay\nwhy don't you tell moment to compose\nyour thoughts sometimes it can help to\nwrite out your question and let's move\non to someone else Connor uh yeah can\nyou me yep cool so lately I've been\ndoing trauma processing and it kind of\nset off this like chain effect of like\noh boy the opposite of like lack of\nemotions right and so yeah um so I kind\nof got to this state of like like for\ninstance I went to a friend's yesterday\nand had like this initial like just\nshutdown of everything like I would like\ntunnel vision and it was like just\nautomatic right it was like and yeah and\nso that happens quite frequently video\ngames was actually like it helped quite\na bit in the kind of like reducing a lot\nof the physical\nactions and stuff but now I'm kind of in\nthis state where it's like I don't even\nknow like I don't feel like any emotions\nor like if occasionally I'll be like in\nbed at night and I'll just be super sad\nbut that's like the only emotion that I\ncan ever feel and I think like yeah so I\nguess just like how to combat the or not\neven combat but like that automatic\nresponse because it's like almost like I\ndon't even have a choice in it it's just\nlike yeah you you don't you don't have a\nchoice in it I don't think you should\ncome bat it so what you're doing so\npeople have a history of trauma\noftentimes dissociate during the trauma\nand after the trauma and dissociation is\nan adaptive and protective mechanism\njust like video gaming so when the\nemotional when when when your garden\nhose it's not even a garden hose it's a\nfire hydrant when your fire hydrant is\nbusted open and there's water all over\nthe place your brain is like oh crap\nlet's just shut it all off they're like\npulling the plug on like all of the\nemotional circuits and that's absolutely\nprotective and and adaptive and it's\nprobably because you started like\nturning that on right through doing like\ntrauma focused work right so this is\nideally where you have an expert like a\ntherapist who will help you through this\nbecause it's really hard to manage on\nyour own which I do yeah yeah so I think\nthat the issue there is that what you\nwant to do is like bring up emotions in\na controlled environment where you feel\nsafe and then like it's hard to stop a\nfire hydrant on your own but if you've\ngot like two people working together you\nmay be able to manage some of those\nemotions right and even as it comes to\nthe sadness so it sounds like you you're\nyou know your fire hydrant is mostly\nclosed up but there are some cases where\nthere's like water leaking out right\nwhich is like when you're laying in bed\nat night you start to start and feel a\nsense of overwhelming sadness so I'd say\nthat all of the things that we talked\nabout you can do when you feel that but\nI would not go like you know walking\naround and opening up that fire hydrant\non your own because your bodies your\nbody or your mind are telling you hey\nman that's too much for us right now\nyeah and and there are other things like\nyou know going to a retreat or like\ngoing for a hike or things like that can\nalso be really good at emotionally\nprocessing it all happens kind of\nsubconsciously in that in the background\nbut you know a lot of people deal with\ntrauma\nthrough like finding themselves kind of\nactivities right yeah I think in your\ncase I think you're actually on the\nright Road and unfortunately part of the\nprocess of processing that trauma like\nin order to process the emotion what\nwe're doing is we're actually shining a\nlight on it so you experience it more\nand then you can try to sort of explore\nthat sadness a little bit but be careful\nI would start really with physical stuff\nbecause physical stuff tends to be\npretty safe cool yeah I can do that for\nsure\ngreat question man good luck to you bye\nthank you appreciate it I'm glad you're\nseeing a therapist it's I mean you're\nyou know taking taking control of\nyourself and taking control of your life\nsometimes it's not a solo player thing I\nmean solo that's all again same good\nluck to you man I wish you the best\nthank you\ndo we have Seth yep can you hear me yep\nI'm okay so I just had two questions or\nit's just I could ask one if you want\nbut uh so is there like a thing we're\nover time like as a child I generally\nfelt I don't know if this is alexithymia\nor not but like over time I felt that\nemotions and just my general sensations\nand feelings and experiences have lost\nlike like their potency almost like it\nalmost feels like yeah it feels like um\nyou know like I I guess like over time I\neven would lose track of like positive\nexperiences because like I would be\neither maybe too analytical like I would\nstart to notice like oh you're having a\ngood time you're smiling you're laughing\nand then it would take away from it so\nit's almost like you're you say\nawareness precedes control\nit's like awareness also kind of\nscrutiny unless it's like a synthetic\nfaulty form of awareness that I'm you\nknow at me like my mindfulness or\nsomething er so what is that that like\ncould you explain that sure so there are\ntwo things I think that are going on one\nis that like I mentioned earlier\ngenerally speaking when we suppress\nemotions we suppress all emotions right\nso like what I want you to imagine that\nyou yourself like you have an internal\nvolume control for all of your emotions\nin order to protect us from the bad\nsounds we're gonna turn down the good\nsounds to because we just we just know\nhow to turn down the volume mmm so what\nyou're describing about like over time\nyou've lost like a zest for life or\nthings seem to be less fun\nfor you that makes sense to me and I\nhave that I see that experience a lot\nwith video gamers and it's just because\nthey turn down the volume on everything\nyeah and it's a dramatic sorry yeah god\nit's not even dramatic either it's it's\nalmost subtle like it's just part of the\nexistence it's it's almost absolutely\nright so like if you think about if if\nyou gradually turn down the volume on\nyour TV over years and you don't turn it\nback up at some point it becomes normal\nto have like a muted or very quiet TV\nyeah like you think it's max volume\nright you don't even recognize that\nvolume control as a thing because it's\nentirely subconscious you just think\nthat's how the TV works\nhmm I wouldn't even think that you\nrecognize its max volume it's just you\nyou don't you think that that is the\nonly volume that the Catena TV is\ncapable of it's not max or it's not low\nit's just the volume of the TV period\nright yeah that makes sense\nright yeah so so so that's one thing\nthat's going on the second thing that\nI'm glad you noticed is that this is\nwhat happens when you start to develop\nawareness of feelings is it creates\ndistance between those feelings and\nthose feelings have less power over you\nright so there's actually a fourth\nvariable to the equation of intention\nlike you know intention to complete an\naction and that's so the three variables\nright now we're like rational thought\nemotions an ego in the fourth one is\nawareness and as awareness increases the\nvalue of everything else goes down\nrelative to awareness and then when you\nbecome perfectly enlightened then your\nawareness is a hundred percent and then\nyour actions are can be like instantly\nimplemented hmm so in your case you may\nactually be experiencing both that as\nyou gain awareness of excitement the\nfeeling of excitement kind or not the\nfeeling of excitement the impact of\nexcitement starts to go down which is\nnormal\nsee I think yeah like an early age I\nthink like say order to understand like\nit was because of social like capital or\nwhatever like I wanted to be popular in\nthis and out whatever I tried to start\nunderstanding other people through\nmyself so I don't know if like I taught\nmyself some type of mindfulness or\nawareness or something this was like in\nseventh grade or like middle school I\ntried to start like I would witness what\nmade me feel insecure and then I\nlook inside myself to see the process\nand then I would try to like\nreverse-engineer it by seeing other\npeople and so like I started to distance\nmyself from like maybe social\ninteraction in like a weird way because\nthey're just breaking everything down\nyeah so that's that's you stepping away\nfrom emotional empathy and stepping\ntowards cognitive empathy hmm so your\nunderstanding of emotions has become\nmore and more analytical which in turn\nincreases your colorblindness because\nyou can analyze your emotions but you're\nnot exactly sure like what you feel or\nhow you feel\nyeah huh so I think you should continue\ndoing you know the mindfulness stuff and\nit's okay for you to you know be mindful\ntowards your positive emotions and it\nkind of like you and then over time as\nyou kind of do that sort of stuff\nyou can actually start to control how\nmuch you want to feel that emotion hmm\nthe last thing is like when you're fully\naware you can kind of choose to jump\ninto the water or get back out whenever\nyou want to and that's when things get\nfun so is the the like autonomous\nprocess that I've created is it possible\nthat maybe it just kind of filters that\nposit because I generally feel that it\nfilters out the positive ones and then\nthe negative ones stay so like if I'm at\na party having fun it'll take they'll\ncreate a distance from the having fun\nbut it won't be I don't really create a\ndistance to negative things I only\ncreate a distance to the positive you\nyou do create a distance to negative\nthings the difference is that your your\namount of positive emotion is like 10\nand your amount of negative emotion is\n90 oh and you're subtracting 80 from\nboth sides does you so it's just that\nyou have more negative emotion built up\nwhich makes sense because you haven't\nbeen processing emotion for what sounds\nlike years and years and years and years\nbecause that [ __ ] is just piling up yeah\ngot it\nyes cool thank you all right good luck\nman thank you\nokay mica or Tony Mike are you ready to\ngive it another shot I mean I think so\nso um um there's no a word or phrase\nthat identifies certain groups of\nemotions that you feel are suppressed so\nwhether it be on like the few or\nwhatever that might be so I don't think\nthat there are groups of emotions that\nyou suppress I think like I said\nalexithymia turns down the volume on all\nof your\nemotions so I get and and so I don't\nthink that there's like differently it's\nnot like there's a different word for\nlike suppression of anger and shame in a\ndifferent word from some fresh thing\nlike happiness and excitement I think\nit's just suppression oh just all of\nthem in general although it can't be a\nspecific one that you just feel like no\nI mean it could be right so your brain\ncould have adapted to being very good at\nsuppressing a particular emotion mm-hmm\nlike it's possible right so like the guy\nearlier who's talking about trauma there\nare some things for example that\ntriggered dissociation and that\ndissociative process could be triggered\nby specific emotions in fact we know\nthat mm-hmm so like that's what the idea\nof triggers so your brain can't find you\nto a particular thing and I guess the\nclosest thing to what you're describing\nis trigger would be the word that yes\nyes yes sir yeah yeah so actually now\nthat I think about it I mean yeah but I\ndon't think there's a specific word for\nlike suppressing anger okay but your\nbrain can trigger dissociative or\nsuppressive mechanics with some emotions\naround moreso than others absolutely\nokay thank you\ngreat question man Tony you around yeah\ncan you hear me yep so my question is is\nkind of dealing with like previous\nemotions so I kind of resonate a lot\nwith your eStore in terms of I had\nstruggles with college and dropped out\nand like my thing was to basically\ncompletely dissociate to the point of\nlike not even eating or like it was bad\nbut now I feel pretty good but to use\nyour analogy it feels like I kind of\njust like leveled up past the debuff so\nI still feel like I have that like yeah\nlike some scar there so how to deal with\nthat when like I feel pretty good I made\na lot of progress but it's still holding\nme back yeah so I think first of all I\nagree with you that it is holding you\nback right so you're doing pretty well\nand what I'm telling you man is like\nonce you cleanse that debuff you're\ngonna be like an absolute beast in real\nlife so I think you should absolutely\nwork on that right just doing good in\nlife is not actually like what we're\nshooting for where she asked for\ncleansing all the debuffs and where you\nend up is where you end\nbut like as long as the debuff so that\nyou should work on so question is how so\nI think like I said you know there are a\nlot of different things that you can do\nI think therapy is a great example of\nsomething that you can kind of talk to\nsomeone about when you were feeling bad\nand work through and process those\nemotions and tell your story and things\nlike that\nI think narrative is another good\nexample so you know doing narrative\nexercises about like sort of just\nwriting about that time of your life\nwill probably bring things up for you\nand you'll feel that emotion and then\nit'll kind of affect you and then it'll\nkind of like wither away yeah so the\nother thing I want you guys to remember\nabout emotions is like you don't feel\nthem forever\nso if I if I'm walking down the street\nand then you know I get scared of a dog\nI feel that dog creates a certain amount\nof fear in my mind like let's say it\ncreates a fear of 20 and then the more I\nfeel that fear the more that fear kind\nof goes down because our mind naturally\nlike you don't stay scared forever right\nour mind naturally sort of processes\nprocesses that fear we return to\nequilibrium the problem is that we feel\n20 we process - and then we store 18 and\nthe next day you're failing out of\ncollege you feel more shame so you get\nplus 20 shame you process - and then you\nBank 18 and so what you have is like you\nhave all this banked stuff which all you\nhave to do is like process it and feel\nit and like you can breathe into it or\nwhatever I don't know if there's some\nway that you can evoke it can you evoke\nthe feelings that you used to feel uh\nit's very much like like it's completely\nblanked out it's almost like I was\nsaying about this Saturday like I don't\neven remember like like any of that and\nI try not to think about it at all\ninstead of processing it so I probably\ncould but it's like it's difficult\nbecause I don't want to feel that crap\nthat I felt yeah so if you're if you're\nnot so I would really say like in your\nsituation you should work with someone\nmm-hmm right so that can be a coach\nthrough us or a therapist and and it\nkind of depends on on you know whether\nyou have a clinical diagnosis that you\nwant to work on or not because if you\nhave a clinical like diagnosis like PTSD\nor trauma or things like that then\nthat's really something that you should\nsee a mental health professional about\nbut\nyeah I mean I'd say like it's hard to do\nit solo like the other thing that you\ncould I mean if you want to do it solo\nI'd say the things that you can do you\ncan drive try journaling so you can just\nstart by writing about that part of your\nlife and then kind of focusing on the\nfeeling so what are the emotions that\nyou felt and then the other thing that\nyou can do is just continue to meditate\nand do yoga and stuff like that and then\nyou'll start to process those emotions\non your own because remember that your\nbody like naturally wants to return to a\nhealthy state and you don't after like\nif you get a cut like you don't have to\ndirect the healing you need bodies just\nyou just don't have to get in the way\nand if you facilitate healing by like\nyou know keeping it clean and stuff like\nthat and just kind of practicing\npositive stuff if you do yoga and\nmeditation for a period of two or three\nyears it'll clear out a lot of that crap\nyeah makes it a smell yeah awesome in\nthanks for your question yeah thank you\nthank you for all you're doing so\nalright guys so we're gonna wrap up for\ntoday I'm sorry we don't have sort of as\nformal of a meditation practice\nhopefully you guys can do sort of that\nbreathing into the the chest or just\nbreathe into that part of your emotion\nand a combination of you know we got a\nlittle bit interrupted but I really do\nhave to run but we'll see you guys\ntomorrow let's do a quick poll\nwhat do you guys want to talk about\ntomorrow\nI think communication was at the top of\nthe list we can do I are better we can\ndo what else can we do with mental\nhealth stuff so we can talk about you\nknow my perspective on depression or\nADHD or trauma we can do mechanism of\nthe mind so this is understanding like\nwhat are the pieces of the mind or we\ncan talk about kovin how to manage\nyourself\nin communication is like how to talk to\npeople okay so it still looks like it's\npredominately communication okay I can\nget behind that all right so it looks\nlike it's heavily in favor of of\ncommunication but that the mechanism of\nmine IRL and mental health are evenly\nsplit insecurity ego okay let's let's\ntry this again I'm just gonna knock over\nit off the list and let's put you go in\nthere see what happens now\noh man it's close looks like egos\nwinning okay so we have a new winner\nwhich is ego okay okay so we may still\ndo communication and the reason for that\nis because I'm just thinking through\nwhat order to do things in that kind of\nso I don't want to treat things like\nindividual topics right I want things to\nbuild on each other and I think talking\nabout emotions and then link like well I\nwanted to do emotions before\ncommunication for sure and so then the\nquestion is is it better to do ego\nbefore communication or communication\nbefore ego\nwhat's gonna be better so let me think\nabout that we'll definitely do those two\nover the next two days it's just what\norder we want to do them in\ncommunication with people that have a\nbig ego right so then the question is do\nyou want to e go first so you want to do\ncommunication for it will not only do\nthose two so thanks for coming guys let\nme just think about it let me think\nabout how I want to structure that and\nwhich one should come first but will\ndefinitely hit both of those up and Alex\nyou keep on sending me these gigantic\nmessages but buddy I don't I can't read\nthat during a live seminar so good luck\nbuddy I'll try to get to it if I can so\nI'll see you guys tomorrow thanks for\ncoming and you know I think we really\nappreciate all of the donations and\nstuff on on Kofi there was a question\nabout are we gonna continue this it just\ndepends so whether we continue this or\nnot us frankly depends on how much\npeople get out of it and like how many\npeople use it right so right now I'm\njust thinking about how to spend my time\nand I want to spend my time to do the\nthing that helps the equation for how I\nspend my time is most value for most\nnumber people so if it's like super\nsuper valuable like I could I could\nwith one person at a time and helped\nthem immensely over the course of six\nmonths or I could do a webinar where I\ncould do a twitch stream so basically\ndepending on how popular this is we're\ngonna prioritize it more or how\nunpopular is we'll prioritize it less so\nif you guys want to see more of this\nthan what I suggest that you do is you\ntell people that you know or you talk it\nup or you advertise it for it right so\nwe haven't asked you to do that yet and\nI wasn't planning on asking for it but\nI'll just let you guys know from my\nperspective you know five hundred people\nor six hundred people or seven hundred\npeople do this and four thousand people\nwatch our streams were more likely to\nprioritize streams over this so I'm\ntrying to kind of figure out how to work\nbut if the numbers for the webinar get\nhigher and higher and higher then we'll\ndo more and more webinars because that\nseems to be what what helps people so\nsort of a simple mathematical equation\nwe have a limited resource so how should\nwe invest it that that people will\ndecide so tell your friends and then if\nour numbers go up then we'll probably do\nmore but it at this point you know I\ndon't know how much longer we'll\ndefinitely do the two weeks but then\nwe'll kind of reassess and maybe try\nsomething else or maybe continue this\nwe'll see so take care guys"
