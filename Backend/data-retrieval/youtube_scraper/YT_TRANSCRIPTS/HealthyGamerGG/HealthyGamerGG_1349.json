    "transcript": "this is a little bit this is gonna be a\nlittle bit tricky because we're gonna do\npseudonym us car so there's about a two\nto three ratio so like 62% of people\nwant to do something else\n32% want to do seer Namaskar so we're\ndefinitely gonna do Syrian mus car I'll\nteach you guys maybe one other thing but\nI want you guys to understand this very\nclearly so sooner in a mus car is like\nthe thing that you should do every day\nit should be like brushing your teeth\nand so we definitely want to do that\nevery day but I will teach you guys\nother stuff so we we learned a backbend\nkind of awesome we can learn we've done\na couple things on stream like the Basia\nwhich we can do I'll definitely start\nteaching you guys Brown I am and so will\nteach you guys more stuff I get that\ny'all ready for something else but I\ndon't I would I don't want you guys to\nforget that like some things should be\ndone every day and be a little bit\ncareful so when you think about why your\nmind wants to learn something besides\nSurya Namaskar like what is it are you\nguys getting bored of it are you curious\ndo you want to learn more do you think\nmore is better so think about all those\nthings like where does your curiosity\ncome from and I think ultimately Surya\nNamaskar is really the most important\npractice but since you guys want to\nlearn something else and we've been\ndoing it for a week I'll teach you guys\nsomething else okay so let's let's start\nwith yoga all right okay hopefully this\nwill be a little bit better cuz I'm back\nat my old set up with more stable\ninternet okay\nall right you guys right so let's start\nso start by standing up straight feet\nshoulder-width apart close your eyes\njust feel the stability of kind of being\nhere for a second and we're gonna apply\nour same rules as before so you guys can\nwatch me do it if you don't feel\ncomfortable watch one round and if not\nif you all feel kind of ready to go then\nyou can do it with me so let's start by\nputting our feet together anchor\nyourself in your instability no must the\nposition and then we're going to begin\nso arms up biceps to your ears feel the\nstretch\nfeel your body waking up feel your back\nand then bend down to touch your toes\nfeel the stiffness let your head hang\nand then right leg back and look up good\ntry to keep your palms flat toes curled\nback straight and look up left leg back\nlook up push-up position stay straight\nand then down toes knees chest forehead\nand push up hips to the ground\nfeet flat shoulders out neck curled up\nyou\nand then to downward-facing dog are both\nawesome put your heels flat into the\nground and that right leg forward\nlook up it sort of put your you can move\nyour hips a little bit to feel stretch\nin different areas you should form a\nline between your two hands and your\nfoot and then we're back up to touching\nyour toes as you exhale let yourself\nsink further see how much further you\ncan go compared to what we started then\nback up nice and straight and then back\ndown so now we're going to turn I'm\ngoing to go ahead and do one round\nsideways okay just so you guys can see\nwhat things look like from a sideways\nangle now we'll begin round two so now\nwhat we're going to do is incorporate\nwell let's do round two and then we'll\ndo round three with some specific\nbreathing okay so let's begin again up\ngo a little bit faster this time\nfeel the stretch down see so as you\nloosen it up you're going to kind of be\nable to go down a little bit more right\nleg back right so this is sort of right\nleg back and then you can kind of sink\nin a little bit or up just feel that\ndifference left leg back push up\nposition so you want to stay nice and\nstraight further up you go the easier\nit's gonna be but we want to stay nice\nand straight okay and then down toes\nknees chest for them but it's a little\nbit of ear\nand then feet flattened hips down push\nup shoulders rounded out\nand then feet toes back on the ground\nand then downward-facing dog if that's\nwhat this posture is I don't really know\nso try to put your butt in the air heels\ndown so you don't want to be like this\nheels down right leg forward look up\nand then feet together hang down tuck\nyour toes come back up fingers towards\nthe sky feel that stretch and then back\nto baseline then must stay position okay\nand now we're gonna do round three all\nright\nso round three we're going to\nincorporate a little bit of breath so\nwe're going to move a little faster this\ntime and what I want you guys to do is\nessentially with each alternate pose you\nwant to breathe out and breathe in now\npractically what you're probably going\nto have to do we're probably gonna take\nbreaths in between but when we go up\nwe're going to breathe in when we go\ndown we're gonna breathe out when we put\none leg back we're gonna breathe in when\nwe go down let me think about this\nso yeah that's not gonna quite work so\nwe want to I'll tell you guys to breathe\nin or breathe out and glue John Nelson\nshould be excavation okay so for most\nposes we're gonna kind of do opposites\nof breathing in and breathing out and\nthen for some cases we're gonna kind of\nrecenter and relax and start with a full\nbreath okay so I'll explain so the first\nlet's adopt our position then start\nright breathing in and then out right\nback out\nother go down and breathe in brush up\nand breathe out\nbuddy then I put it out breathe in and\nout and then back to centre\nlet's do another round okay we're gonna\ndo two more\nit can maybe doing the breath song but\nwho cares so breathe in out left leg\nback in go in out in now and then back\nto these\nin the third round okay so get ready in\nout in out in out in out in out back to\nbase\nnow we're going to go back into\nshavasana so go ahead and lay down\nand feel the vitality kind of coursing\nthrough you is your body wakes up let's\npump it now been breathing well moving\nin rid of some of the sluggishness\nand now go ahead and come back it's\nApril 1st probably should have done\nsomething for April Fool's but I didn't\nso we're gonna go ahead and sit up\nlet's go ahead and build on our\nmeditation practice from yesterday so I\ndon't want you guys to take your middle\nfinger and place it over your forehead\nstart to peel the energizing between\nyour eyebrows\nand come back down now focus on your\nforehead spot between your eyebrows\nand now let yourself come back back to\nthe world it's April 1st you may have\ntasks to do today\nthe covin pandemic is very active in the\nworld and it's time to learn about in\nParma ok so welcome back guys let's get\nstarted\n[Music]\nok so do I even need to wear or even\nthink I need to wear headphones why do I\nwear headphones alright so let's see\nshall we\nI feel like we should get into let's\ntake a quick break I'm gonna get a\nlittle bit of water ok and let's see you\nguys\nI love these poles man it's gonna give\nme a second to set up reflector and\nstuff anyway so ok let's take a quick\nbreak we'll resume so it's 9 26 my time\nwill resume at 9:30 ok so we'll have\nplenty of time don't worry\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\ncan we do today's lecture with full\nIndian accent okay we can try but it's\ngoing to be a good one okay we can do it\nabout Dharma Dharma we can do it\nblack screen cap I prefers okay we can\ntry we let's let's try to do the full\nscreen we can do the full accent okay\nfull lecture lecture lecture okay let's\nlet's take let's do pole pole you know\npole pole Smith his friend of mine Paul\nPaul\nlet's do okay April 1st lecture in\naccent or not no ice no Paulie\ndoctor he likes the pole\noh my goodness it's 50/50 it's 50 P free\nah looks like you guys lose accent folks\n50 248 maybe the closest pole in history\nteam natural ok sorry guys 50 49 ok\nthat's ok baby will stream today in\naccent sad yeah you guys can blame your\nyour colleagues for wanting to you know\nlearn things and be professional okay\nnot my fault all right so let's talk\ntoday we're gonna talk about the pattern\nmodel okay\nso bad handwriting POG totter MA\nso Dharma is the son script word for\nduty or responsibility\nand why is harm important so generally\nspeaking the compass that we use in life\nin terms of like what we're trying to do\nand what we're trying to not do is to\navoid pain and seek pleasure okay so\nthis is like this is basically how we we\nlive our life and this is the way that\nour brain is wired okay so this is the\nresult of brain wiring and if we think\nabout this for a second you know what\nare the foods that we enjoy eating and\nwhat are the foods that we don't enjoy\neating generally speaking our brain\ngravitates towards foods that are\npleasurable and away from foods that are\nlike unpleasurable so we you know tend\nto like sweet fatty things and avoid\nbitter or astringent things astringent\nis actually one of the tastes that we\ndon't really talk about very much in the\nWest but there are more than five tastes\nso astringent is the taste of like\nunripe fruit so if you guys have like an\nunripe fruit like you know it's sort of\nsour but it also makes your mouth kind\nof pucker or dry that taste is called\nastringent so this is kind of how we're\nwired like if we think about you know if\na child falls down and gets hurt that is\ngoing to be painful and then the child\nis going to avoid that and if a child\nmakes a step forward and is successful\nyou know we're gonna praise the child\nand then the child is really gonna like\nthat and then they're gonna kind of see\ngo towards that right so neuro\nscientifically we're wired to avoid pain\nand see pleasure so what does that what\ndoes that kind of mean for us like I\nthink the challenge here is that if if\nwe're wired to avoid pain and seek\npleasure what that means is that\nessentially we're\ngoing to avoid bad boring painful stuff\nright like this is kind of this sort of\nmakes sense like we don't want to do\nsomething that's gonna make us feel a\nshame we don't want to do something\nthat's gonna make us feel fearful so\nlike basically what we tend to avoid is\nboredom number one frustration number\ntwo what was the third thing and wordy\nnumber three right so like sure you can\ntalk about emotions like fear shame\nanger but generally speaking when people\nare avoiding tasks this is not actually\nwhat their experiences this is what\ntheir experiences right if I ask you\nlike why don't you go to the library day\nand study your answer isn't gonna be\nfear shame or anger it's gonna be\nboredom like I'm bored this is boring\nboring boring boring boring boring\nboring boring boring boring why don't\nyou apply for 50 jobs because it's\nfrustrating frustrating frustrating\nfrustrating frustrating frustrating\nso with this meet that like the tricky\nthing though is that if we think about\nmoving forward in life moving forward in\nlife tends to so let's just talk about\npleasure for a second actually so let's\ntalk about pleasure and so what we do is\nwe seek pleasurable activities right so\nthis includes video games YouTube like\nsocial media and then like you know\nstreaming services this can also include\ndrugs it can include eating unhealthy\n[Music]\nthe last thing here I'm gonna add is\nhard right and things that are kind of\npleasurable or things that are easy\nright so let's include hark okay\nso what this means is like your brain is\nkind of wired to pick this category more\nthan this cat oh sorry the other way\naround your brain is wired to pick this\ncategory more than that category and\nwhat this results in is a grand old\nfeeling of being oh stuck I may have to\nswitch to the other notes that therefore\nyou are stuck so your life is sort of\ncategorized by you know picking this\nstuff over this stuff and so this is\nthis results in you kind of being stuck\nin life you can't move forward so then\nwhat happened this is you guys like ask\nthese questions right we ask all these\nquestions like how do i how do I switch\nthis around is there some way that I can\nswitch things around how do I get\nmotivation willpower discipline all this\nkind of stuff right this is where you\nguys think the answer is because what\nyou do is you observe some people in the\noutside world and the people that that\nactually manage to do this your\nperception is that this is motivation\nwill or this one or all that good stuff\nor smart your perception is that this is\nbasically pick your positive trait that\nyou do not have that's what our mind\ndoes right we\nlook at this curve and we say like oh\nthat person is and you can you can\ninsert whatever you want to you can\ninsert any positive trait that you like\nit's kind of interesting right and you\nsay oh like that person is disciplined\nand I'm not and that's why this person\nhas is successful when I'm not okay now\nthe question is is so like the problem\nwith this is like how do you how do you\nget this stuff right I mean this stuff\nup here on the top right like how do you\nget this it's hard so you guys can talk\nabout like we can talk about motivation\nwillpower discipline we have and you can\nwork on those things and those do help\nbut what I really like about Parma is if\nyou guys want to turn this thing around\nthought of us the easy way to do it\nso Dharma is the force that allows you\nto pick this stuff over this stuff\nwithout willpower motivation etc Dharma\nis the thing that naturally causes you\nto not necessarily seek pain but let's\nput it accept pain and give up pleasure\nthis is what the enema allows you to do\nokay so let's talk a little bit about\nhow that happens so I've told this story\nseveral times but like let's let's talk\nabout something that's a little bit more\ntimely so let's say that you're you know\nso I've seen some of these things on\nsocial media and stuff but let's say you\nthat you're a doctor and so if you're a\ndoctor you do a lot of things that\nactually like really suck so good\nexamples are 24-hour calls other\nexamples are dealing with insurance\ncompanies one of my least favorites\nokay Oh etc\nso and then like nowadays you know like\ndoctors are even like separated from\ntheir own families because of COBIT and\nstuff like that and so the question is\nlike how are you able to do this so\nthere's definitely like you know a lot\nof things that allow you to do this so\none is money\none is prestige right there are all\nkinds of things that like will gravitate\ntowards this so you can say this is kind\nof long-term stuff but generally in my\nexperience when you're actually on call\nand you know when you're in our 22 of\ncall when you're like at our 22 and then\nlike why why is it that you're able to\nlike function there it's because you\nknow there's a patient who needs you\n[Music]\nand if you guys think about this like\nyou actually do a good job when there's\nsomeone who needs you so if you think\nabout it this causes you to be your best\nself\nthis is what kind of brings the best\npart out of you right like you won't\ncook a meal for yourself but I mean I\nmean I'm sure a lot of you do but if you\nthink about like you know cooking a\nfresh home-cooked meal for someone who's\nsick that's that allows you to like wake\nup or go to the grocery store or cook\nfor them and deliver it to them like if\na friend of yours needs help moving\nmoving or they need help with this or\nthat or like you your best self often\ncomes out due to someone needing you\nbecause that's like your duty or\nresponsibility and I'll give you guys\njust kind of a another sort of classic\nexample so this is the one that I\nusually use so let's say that there's a\ngun okay and let's say here is me and\ngenerally speaking you know our response\nis to run away from the gun I suppose I\nshould label this in case people don't\nhave audio because what does the gun\nmean the gun means pain death suffering\nkind of lost opportunity and so\nbasically what I want to do this is\nmoving okay is run away from the gun\nand if we think about it this is a\nno-brainer like facing a gun can be\nreally really hard and our instinctive\nreaction is to run away right so then\nI'm running away from this so what\nhappens if my kid is involved right so\nsuddenly like this actually gets worse\nlike everything here increases once you\nadd my kid to this scenario but how do\nmy actions change right suddenly instead\nof running away moving toward the gun so\nif you just think about it like this\nisn't complicated the stimulus is the\nsame in fact the stimulus is even worse\nbut our natural inclination changes\ndrastically\nonce our power mode becomes involved and\nthis is the essence of it like it's not\nthat complicated\nDharma is that which allows you to\naccept pain and give up pleasure and the\nproblem right now is that you guys don't\naccept pain and give up pleasure you\navoid pain and you seek pleasure which\nkeeps you doing these kinds of\nactivities and so the secret of Dharma\nis that once you find your Dharma like\nyou're able to do you're able to make\nthis choice more and more and more right\nthis choice becomes easier you start to\npick this instead of this and so the\nquestion that becomes so we're gonna see\nif okay so hmm I wonder if we should do\nquestions as we go so let's just pause\nthere for a second I'm gonna invite\nCasper Thomas and Lucas okay let's have\nthem do hop in to do questions and then\nI'm gonna keep talking so we're gonna\ntry something a little bit different\ntoday okay so try to keep try to keep\nyour\nquestions topic focus please\nso that's okay you can accept pain and\naccept pleasure so let's let's just\nthink so then the question becomes so\nnow a lot of people have a question for\nme which is like I've talked about\nantara a lot on stream so then the next\nquestion becomes how do I fine what's\nwrong with this find my the Dharma okay\nI see we're getting a lot of questions\nhold on do I need to turn off screen\nshare to talk to people let's see let's\nsee what happens yeah I pick randomly\n[Music]\nyeah sure it would be smarter to grab\nthe kid and run but I mean my point is\nthat that I'm facing the danger whereas\nbefore I was running away from it and\neven if that involves running away from\nit but it's like I'm gonna put myself\nbetween the kid in the gun so let's talk\na little bit about and we'll see this is\nthis working in terms of questions do I\nneed to turn off screen share let's see\nfor a second okay\nokay I don't know why people aren't able\nto get in I'm gonna invite a lot Elias\nThomas and Joe\n[Music]\nokay I don't know what's the deal there\nokay here we go\nEliza's in the room\nisn't this is kind of distracting\nabsolutely so I'm trying something new\nwe're gonna see if we can sort of flow\nquestions in and simulate more of a\nclassroom environment cuz usually when I\nteach I'm kind of like I answer\nquestions as people raise their hands so\nI'm gonna try that and see how this\nworks okay now everyone's flooding in\nalright so we'll give people just a\nsecond and then we'll get how do we find\nour Dharma we'll try this and then at\nthe end I'll pull you guys about whether\nyou want to take questions at the end or\nyou guys like questions in the middle am\nI free to speak or yeah go for it\noh okay so I guess my question is like\nthe presumption of Dharma is that you're\ngoing to be like more motivated to seek\ndiscomfort because you're doing it for\nlike the benefit of somebody else but\nwhat if like you aren't\nI mean suppose somebody isn't motivated\nto help others like do you like is it\npossible that there are people like that\nin Chapter one including me and what\nwould your Dharma be in that case so\nyour Dharma isn't necessarily to help\nother people my point is that Dharma is\nwhat allows you to accept pain and give\nup pleasure so for example we'll get to\nthis in a second so I think that the\nreason I use the example of helping\nothers is because it's something that\npeople can clearly understand like in my\nscenario why I would want to avoid a gun\nand then why I would want to step in\nfront of a gun like it in one moment it\nflips around what my natural inclination\nis and what I do right so but that's\njust one example of Dharma there are all\nkinds of Karma's so the second thing is\nlike what if your entire mo what if you\ndon't like helping people\nI don't think helping people is Dharma\nso the question is is there anyone in\nlife that you have a duty or\nresponsibility to support or help and if\nyou don't that's okay so I think that\nlike this is also where I haven't harm\nup to my kid because I have a kid if I\ndidn't have a kid I wouldn't have much\nto a kid\nso I don't think that it's just helping\npeople and we'll kind of get to that\nlike how do you find your Dharma I think\nyou can absolutely have a tottemo to\nyourself or you can have a Dharma to a\ncall like a calling right so you can so\nwe'll kind of get to this but I think\nthat like for a lot of you guys your\nDharma is actually to study and grow and\ndevelop yourself and we'll talk a little\nbit more about how to focus that but\nyou're the hard one doesn't have to be\nto help other people like there are\nmonks who are sitting in the Himalayas\nwho are like sitting in caves and\nmeditating all day that's their Dharma\nbut their Dharma doesn't involve any\nother people they don't see people for\nlike decades and that's completely fine\nhmm okay thank you right so you can be\nlike an author in a cabin in the woods\nand in your heart you have a story to\ntell and that's what you devote yourself\nto and it doesn't involve other people\nit's just there's a story that lives\nwithin you that you need to like birth\nand bring into the world which is a\ncompletely acceptable thought ah yeah\nthe author example makes it clear Thanks\nyeah so it doesn't have to be to help\npeople that's just the simplest example\nthat people can understand great\nquestion thank you thank you all right\nwe're gonna go with Alexander yeah near\nme yeah yeah all right um so I'm just\nhaving some difficulty figuring out what\nmy Dharma is I guess sure because I I'm\ndoing all kinds of things in my life\nthat like I don't know I feel like I\nstarted doing them because my parents\nwanted me to like I'm 29 and I work as a\nsoftware developer\nand I'm building a house and I don't\nknow just like a lot of things are going\nright but like I'm still getting over\ndepression it's though so I don't I\ndon't know what my Dharma is in all of\nthis I guess it's just their short way\nto put it and it's still very taxing\nsometimes like I'm I'm really rough hard\non myself and yeah I don't know I just\nthink is like I don't see my Dharma in\nthis situation that they're still\ndifficulty and like doing all these\ntasks and not feeling like pressured and\nyeah yes the first thing is\nyou know whether you feel difficulty or\nnot is irrespective of your Dharma right\nso the whole point behind Dharma is it's\nthat which allows you to choose the\ndifficult path instead of the easier\npath now in your case I think that this\nsort of makes sense\nand I don't know exactly what so we'll\nkind of get to how to find your Dharma\nthat's really why we're sort of doing a\nlecture about this but you know I I\nthink that my question to you would be\nlike is there some is there any kind of\ncalling that you have like what is it\nthat that when you kind of when you\nthink about your life and you think like\nI wish I dot dot dot how do you finish\nthat sentence mm-hmm and the answer is a\nnegative that's not sufficient right I\nwish I didn't work as a computer\nprogrammer like that's not a sufficient\nlike the question is I wish I what yeah\nI I wish I could travel more or could\nhelp people more like yeah okay I want\none of those like I feel strongly about\nboth of those I think the traveling is\nmostly because it just gets me into a\nplace where I feel more comfortable so I\ndon't think that's like the right one I\nthink the right one is like helping\npeople more because like in the past\nI've needed help okay and okay like I\ndidn't get it for a very long time until\nlike two years ago I finally did but\nyeah so Alexander I think unfortunately\nanswering your question is gonna take up\nbecause it's sort of an individual\nexplanation and I want to focus on broad\nprinciples that apply to other people so\nI'd say like hopefully the rest of the\nlecture is gonna be helpful to you but\nI'd say that further and we'll kind of\nget to this like I'm gonna talk about a\ncouple of things which I want you to\nkind of keep an eye out for the first is\nthat karma and karma are related and\nwe'll get to that and that you know your\nDharma is not something that it's not\nlike you wake up one day and you find a\nDharma and then you're set for life like\nthat's not how it works\nit's sort of an evolving process where\nright now your thought are Mazda find\nyour Dharma and oddly enough I wouldn't\nsay that you should focus on helping\npeople unless you actually have a way to\nhelp people like that it's gonna come\nlater so I've always wanted to help\npeople too\nbut helping people involved becoming\nqualified to help people in a particular\nway first right so like one thing that I\ncan just think of is if you're a\nprogrammer there are a couple hundred\npeople on our discord that are like\nmeets and they don't they want to learn\nprogramming so I think our mods actually\nput together a programming workshop so\nthat's an example of like a group of\npeople in our community stepped up and\nrealize that they're like hundreds or\nthousands of people in our community\nthat are stuck and that they can\nactually help them by teaching the\nprogramming I think that that's a\nwonderful example of like living your\nDharma in the moment\noddly enough I'd recommend that if you\nshould if you want to travel you should\nprobably travel actually rather than\ntrying to help people because trying to\nhelp people just sort of randomly it's\nnot like it's not like I'm gonna go you\nknow I'm not gonna go looking for people\nI mean I guess unless I'm Batman I'm not\ngonna go looking for people who are like\npointing guns at other people and try to\nstep in their path like arbitrary\nhelping arbitrarily helping people is\njust that's not Dharma alright I use\nthat because I have a specific duty and\nthe issue is that you probably you want\nto help people but who do who do you\nhave a specific duty to help do you have\nanyone not you should be it's kind of I\nguess like we'd have to get pretty deep\ninto it but I've been two years sober so\nI go to like a a meeting so like there's\nopportunities there yeah so that's so\nthat's the kind of question you should\nbe asking yourself right it's like what\nwhat in this moment who can I help and\nif the answer is like not really many\npeople then I would focus on travel okay\nyeah alright take care man thank you\nyeah a nice trip buddy thanks David\nhello Hey okay so you can hear me yep\nsorry little nervous so my question\nisn't as broad as I don't you might not\nlike but uh about like a little over a\nyear ago my grandpa passed away and I\ndon't know so now it's just me and my\ngrandma and I feel like I have a Dharma\nto kind of like step up and like fill\nthe shoes that\ndid around the house sorry I'm just kind\nof like but my mom isn't kind of like\nshe doesn't want that she's kind of like\nshe's taking on their responsibilities\nlike I'm the parent like I want you to I\ncan go on and live your life and do all\nthat stuff but like I want to figure out\nlike how I can start that conversation\nwith her start which conversation with\nher like that I'm okay like setting\naside my life for now like to kind of\nlike help her out because I feel like\nthat's like what I have to do okay so I\nthink I mean so your question is not\nyour question is about how to have a\nconversation with your mom about what\nyou feel your Dharma is well like I feel\nlike I have a Dharma to her and I'm not\nis that like reasonable sure what is\nyour Dharma to her to to provide as\nshe's she's smoked for a long time so\nshe's like had really bad lungs and she\nneeds like oxygen tanks and so and what\nis she what is your mom advocating that\nyou do she she says that she doesn't\nwant to like she she actually broke down\nonce and saying that they she doesn't\nwant to have to put that was\nresponsibility onto me okay\nand so but what does your mom want you\nto do I'm not sure I'm the prep chef\nokay so you said earlier that you're she\nwants you to kind of like go live your\nlife and don't stay back because of her\nright and your grandmother you kind of\nsuggest you kind of suggest to that so I\nthink the first thing is that like you\nguys need to have a conversation about\nwhat your wants are right so you should\nask her what do you want my life to be\nand what do you should think about what\nyou want your life to be now let me ask\nyou something so Dharma allows us to\naccept negative emotions or avoid\nnegative emotions accept them okay so if\nyou left your family how old are you\nDavid\n21\nokay and what are your options for\nleaving your family like what would you\ndo I'd have to I guess find an apartment\nI just live by myself okay like would\nyou go to school or get a job or like\nwhat is what if you lived for yourself\nwhat would that look like I I do have a\njob but it's closed down because of\ncovent sure but what would living for\nlike is not sacrificing for your family\nwhat would that look like for you I'm\nnot sure really okay so if you moved out\non your own and started to live your\nlife how would you feel probably good\nlike pretty bored because there's not\nlike my grandma to just like if I'm on\nthe computer I can't just like get up\nand go talk to her what I want and then\nlike if I live on my own it's just kind\nof like I'm just there by myself okay so\nI so at first I hadn't understood your\nquestion to be sort of like a conflict\nof Dharma like do you live your own life\nor do you live a life sort of helping\nout your family and I thought that there\nwas a conflict there but the more that\nI'm asking you it doesn't seem like\nthere's actually a conflict there okay\nlike what do you think I like I'm just\nnot so like I don't know how to feel\nabout it okay so so my thought is that\nthe first thing that you should do is\nand I think you asked a good question\nyou were like I'm trying to figure out\nhow to talk to her you've got to talk to\nyour family about this stuff mm-hmm\nright like you guys have to sit down and\nyou got to say mom I'd like to try to\nunderstand what the next five years of\nour lives are gonna look like and then\nyou guys have to sit down it sounds like\nyou guys and this is hard because people\nyou know don't oftentimes don't have\nconversations like this and there are\nall these feelings of guilt and stuff\nlike that and and then you can you guys\ncan run through different scenarios so\nyou can say like option one is I stay at\nhome and then how does that make you\nfeel and what does that look like how\ndoes that make me feel how does that\nmake grandma feel and then option two is\nthat I move out of the house how does\nthat make you feel how does that make me\nfeel how does that make grandma feel and\nwhat is that\nlike and just because people so the the\ntricky thing here is I I mean I was\nshooting for some point which I don't\nthink your is applicable to you but I I\nwant you guys to notice that in David's\ncase what path I mean he says that\nmoving out makes him feel pretty good\nbut like I was envisioning that moving\nout would make him feel guilty yeah if\nwe really think about karma Dharma lets\nus accept guilt that's exactly what it\ndoes right so right now you not moving\nout it has something to do with guilty\nlike keeping you at home you see that\nit's actually avoidance of the guilt\nthat keeps you stuck at home and so you\nwould think that the right thing to do\nis to stay at home but now this is where\nyou really have to tunnel down into\nyourself and ask yourself am I staying\nat home because it's the right thing to\ndo or am i staying home because if it\nstaying home protects me from guilt\nbecause the right thing to do may\nactually be to move out but like moving\nout involves accepting that guilt and\nlike letting your family fend for\nthemselves or acknowledging that like\ngiven your your family's earning power\nspending a few years going to college\nand getting a decent job and making like\n60 K or 100k a year is actually gonna be\nfar better for your family starting at\nthe age of 25 I don't know what kind of\nwork you do or how much you make or\nthings like that but it's a very it's a\nvery possible scenario that investing in\nyourself is the best thing you can do\nfor your family mm-hmm also\nunfortunately I don't really know how\nmuch longer she has left because she's\nshe's getting up there and she's been\nit's like she's smoked her entire life\nso sure so you don't know how so so all\nthat tells me is that it would make you\nfeel more guilty if you left yeah and\njust because you feel guilty doesn't\nmean that it's the right or the wrong\nthing to do so this is why you need to\nhave a conversation with your mom and so\nI'm gonna leave you with one last\nquestion if you were have you graduated\nfrom college no okay I did go for a\nsemester but then I I deserted so so\nthen let me ask you something when your\nmom passes away what do you think will\ngive her more come\neffort seeing you living at home working\nwhatever job you're working are well on\nyour way to like becoming a successful\nhuman who can provide for your family in\na very comfortable way okay right so\nDharma is tricky and and I'm not saying\nyou should abandon your mom but you\nreally have to think about like what is\nyour Dharma to her and what is her\nthought about to you what has heard the\nhunter MOT to you it's to provide for\nyou and set you up in a life that is\nlike that you can be successful and have\nkids of your own and to create a she\nwants to create a life for you that is\ndifferent she wants you to have a life\nthat is different from her life right\nshe wants you to be healthy and stable\nso that your kids don't have to worry\nabout worrying about you hmm\nthis is a conversation that you need to\nhave with her and as bizarre as it\nsounds I'd be really careful because\nthis is the tricky thing everyone says\nthe right thing to do is to stay with\nyour mom for her last year's where she's\ninfirm and needs your help and is dying\nand then Jill never gonna see her again\nmakes perfect sense is kind of like\nobjectively correct and your Dharma may\nbe different your Dharma may be to start\nto build a life for yourself and\nrecognize that it's your karma in her\nkarma that she doesn't have much time\nleft on this earth so you call her every\nday or maybe you stay at home or\nwhatever you guys have to talk this\nthrough and figure out like what the\nwhat the path is because I'm pretty sure\nthat you know what as a parent I can\ntell you that like I could give two\nshits about my own happiness like I\ndon't want my kids to take care of me\nlike I don't care about that like I want\nthem to live their lives and be\nsuccessful like that's what's gonna make\nme happy like does it make me happy to\nsee them every day absolutely but like\nthat is pleasure my Dharma\nfulfilling my Dharma to my kids is\nletting them live their own lives and\nthat's gonna be so much more satisfying\nthan just having them around\nI'm getting some kind of feedback so for\nme\nI'm not sure but look alright David so\nthink about that okay and I think you\nhave to have a conversation with her\nokay and and that conversation is\nimportant now because if she doesn't\nhave long to live then you've got to\nreally think about what does she want\nhow secure or worried is she gonna be\nabout your future when she passes away\nand probably the best thing that you can\ndo for her is for her to not worry about\nyou when you're passing went when you're\npassed when she passes away and I had to\nmute you so we can't hear you but you\ncan turn it on again because you were we\nwere getting feedback okay sorry about\nso so closing thoughts before we give\nyou the boot yeah I guess I'll talk I'll\nread it we'll try to have more talks I\nguess but okay gonna take a while good\nluck man thank you bye okay we're gonna\ngo ahead and do Joe Joe if you're around\nand then we're gonna get back to the\nlecture because this stuff wait do you\nwant go for it jack yeah sure I can hear\nme yep awesome\ncool so yeah I kinda have like two\ndirections I might want to ask questions\nin one is sort of confirming like if I\ncan have a Dharma to like sort of them I\ndon't want to call it an abusive\nrelationship because I think the person\nthe more I look into it the more I think\nthey might have like some semblance of\nlike DPD but it seems like for\nhistorically my relationships I've kind\nof been in longer than people would\nrecommend you know like people are like\nwhy are you still with this participant\nI'm just like I don't know I just feel\nthis obligation and then another another\none is a sorry yeah my connection seems\nlow at the moment so I'm on the only so\non so the other one is so kind of after\nlike finding you and was in a rut for a\nwhile and kind of used some Dharma and\nmeditation and stuff that kind of like\n180 which was cool and then I I sort of\nrealized that well\nI don't know it people just started\ncoming to me for help like I don't I\ndon't understand it and sure yeah I've\nhelped people in this discord and my\nfriends and all kind\nI sort of abandoning my like career\ndream of being a project manager that\nI've wanted for like two years and I\njust want to be a life coach and I want\nto like start my own business so I took\na leave of absence from work because\nit's kind of like too distracting and\nI'm just purely focused on that but I'm\nstill not so I feel like that's my\nDharma is to like just become a life\ncoach and to help people and kind of do\nwhat you do and the issue though is I'm\nI have a lot I need to do to like be an\nentrepreneur and like launch a website\nand like there's it I don't know it\nseems like it's my Dharma but I'm not\nreally doing the thing you know that I\nneeded sure so so those are our we're\ngonna get to answering your question in\na moment but Jo so first of all huge\ncongrats on on turning your life around\nand being inspired and helping other\npeople that's awesome so that's like the\nwhole you know there's a Oh a healing\nand then there's also training other\nhealers my sense is that I would not\nabandon a career for the sake of your\nDharma until it's absolutely ready right\nso like I think this is where you have\nto be really really careful because if\nyou actually want to be successful at\nhelping people you may need like\nfinancial stability in order to build\nyour thing off of the ground yeah so\nlike I'll give you a good example I\ndon't think that like I think that the\npeople who suffer the most and get the\nmost stuck in life are paid yoga\nteachers so people fall in love with\nyoga and they're like oh I love yoga I\nwant to do this all day every day I want\nit to be my job and then they like try\nto like become a paid yoga teacher and\nit's a pay very well and then all kinds\nof other things like get in the way of\nthem being able to just teach yoga\npurely it starts to become a business\nthey have to worry about paying bills\nthey start worrying about marketing they\nbecome entrepreneurs and some of them\nreally like it and some of them are very\nsuccessful that's probably like 1% and\n99% of them are kind of like hustling\nand moving from paycheck to paycheck and\nit's not a very good life I also think\nthat in general helping other people\nshould not be a livelihood so I think\nthat\nyour incentives are gonna get really\nreally misaligned if you depend on\nhelping people for your income okay I\nknow that sounds really weird so I'd say\nthat also if you're if your dream is to\nbe a product manager like I don't know\nwhat you mean like not it so really it\nwas the first thing that resonated with\nme as far like I've just been doing\ncustomer service for like so long and\nthen and then this thing sort of opened\nup and like I kind of looked at some of\nmy core like values you had an exercise\nthat you told people to do at some point\nlike right down when you last felt\nfulfilled and I found a lot of my values\nfrom that and then I looked at the\nproject management I was like oh this\nchecks about half the boxes and then I\nlooked at like just talking to people\nand like and just either like a mentor\nmentee relationship or like whatever\ntypes of stuff\nthose were way more hooking into all my\nvalues so yeah this is what I would say\nif you if you're on the path to become a\nproduct manager I would actually\nrecommend that you select what's what\nwouldn't what would be okay I so I'm\ncompletely so it's like I'm I have I\nhave tried to hit that ceiling like so\nmany times and I just I've given up\nlike I just can't okay so I mean I think\nthat's a little bit different I mean my\nthought would be that you know if you\nwant to become a life coach go for it\nit's a crowded space and it's hard to\nmake money and and so you know generally\nI also think that like helping people is\nsomething that you can definitely get\ncompensated for but I think that like\nyou should be careful about your\nincentives so I think part of what makes\nhealthy gamer good is that I have a job\nthat supports my family this is my side\ngig and I find that having it as your\nside gig allows you to not have perverse\nincentives around helping people yeah\nI think what I want to do is create is\nlike sort of get the ball rolling so to\nspeak like deploy like the website get\nstuff kind of out there get this sort of\nfoundational work done and then go back\nto work and then kind of make still do\nlike 40 goes week Joe are you looking\nfor my blessing are you looking for I'm\ntrying to understand why I'm so I want\nto do the foundational work and then go\nback\nresume by working my career but what I\ndon't understand is I'm not like so it\nseems like it's my Dharma but I'm not\ndoing it like I'm like I'm I have time\nand I'm not doing it I'm doing I'm\nchoosing to do other things yes so that\nI'm not quite sure so I I don't know I\nthink this is I don't know if it seems\ncompellingly overwhelmingly the case\nthat it's my Dharma but it doesn't seem\nto be having the impact arm it does so\nthen I I don't think it's I think you\nneed to explore more of what your\nautonomy is I think the other way to\nthink about it is like instead of\ninstead of getting either pleasurable\nthing which is like getting your life\ncoach website off the ground which would\nbe satisfying and gratifying to you you\nshould do the difficult thing which is\ndevote yourself to being a product\nmanager and understand that like the\nreason that being a product manager\ndoesn't work for you is because it's not\nin service to something else right so\nbeing a product manager is going to\nserve your goal of helping other people\nand then you start helping people like\nin the way that you have been on our\ndiscord signed up to be a recovery coach\nor something like that like that's a\ngreat way to you know I wouldn't abandon\nI mean I sound like you don't have much\nof a product manager career right now\nbut I would consider like you know Bill\nand we'll kind of get to this but like\nbuilding up your yourself first before\nyou start helping other people helping\npeople comes actually like is in the\nsecond phase of life which we'll talk\nabout but and I mean it sounds to me\nlike you're actually so you're it's a\nlittle bit unclear to me what your\nquestion is so it sounds like you\nformulated a plan that you feel good\nabout what you really want to do is you\nwant to get this stuff off the ground\nbut I think it's gonna be like I don't I\ndon't know how successful you're gonna\nbe because I don't know what separates\nyou from any of the other coaches on the\ninternet like how like just because you\nhave some experience helping people like\nI started helping people when I was like\nvery young to like basically when I came\nback from India at the age of 21 and and\nlike over the first time I came back\nfrom India and then like I still was\nhelping people here there but it didn't\nbecome a career for me for a decade\nlater and not really my Dharma for 15\nyears later so can you do it earlier\nabsolutely but I would say that like\nlike we'll get to this so\nkind of talked about a couple of these\nthings okay yeah sure yeah it's it's\nmostly that I just don't know if the\nDharma is working or not is really my\nquestion and that's yes then I don't\nthink you've really found your Dharma\nyet if it's not working then then we'll\nget to that okay\nall right take care cool thanks Elias\nunfortunately I'm gonna have to give you\nthe boot because we're almost a time and\nthere's still a couple of important\nconcepts I'm putting that yeah okay\nthat's fair I figure that's fair take\ncare of Yap I don't get off no no it's\nokay it's it's it's it's my my my choice\nokay so let's kind of go back to\nscreen-sharing oh god did I just bust\nthe lecture come on okay that took way\nlonger than possible so let me just\nstart by actually asking you guys a\ncouple of questions okay so what I'd\nlike to do oklets so when I ask a\nquestion in the middle so we'll talk\nabout that I think that that's actually\na little bit tricky and maybe we want to\ndo that again but but what I'm really\nhoping for which I should have been a\nlittle bit clearer about and I don't\nknow how I'm going to filter questions\nis I'd like to ask you guys questions\nthat are not quite as personal but are\nrelevant to sort of the topic that we've\ncovered so far in the future okay but\nthat's that's okay okay so let's get to\nhow do I find my Dharma so we have to\nthink about whether that's possible so\nI'm trying to simulate sort of a lecture\nright where like I asked I'm talking\nabout something in someone raises their\nhand and I want to be able to call on\nthem and so they can ask kind of a\ntopically relevant question so but we\ntried that\nso let's we'll go a little bit long\ntoday so how do I find my Dharma\nso the first thing is that there are two\ntwo different topics that I want to\ncover today one is kind of how you find\nyour Dharma and the second is the\ntomokawa so in in the Sun script system\nthere are four stages to life okay so so\nif you don't know what your entire Maya\nis like Sanskrit kind of gives you a\nprescription so there are four stages\nokay first is student\nwhich is Brahma Jharia householder sorry\n[Music]\ncarajás - from third is transition by\nnot press\nokay so if you guys if you guys didn't\nrealize bad handwriting + complicated\nson script words are a terrible\ncombination shadows okay so\npronunciation sin yes okay there are\nfour stages and basically where you are\nin life dictates your generals your\nentire mo so the first stage is to\nstudent so this is where your Dharma is\nAgra brahmacarya is to learn develop and\ngrow so this is when you kind of like\neat like the first age of life like when\nyou're 21 you're not supposed to be like\nout saving the world right that's\nsomething that I am 37 so I I spent you\nknow 15 years or longer like basically\nyou know probably the first 30 years of\nmy life basically focusing on myself and\nI didn't do that intentionally it's just\nwhat happened so I went to India and I\ndecided to become a monk at the age of\n21 and my teacher said no they're like\nyou have to go finish your education so\nto understand that like your Dharma and\nhelping people that's gonna come later\nso your karma is going to determine your\nautonomy which we'll talk about in a\nsecond but really if you guys are if you\nguys are stuck the first thing to\nunderstand is that like if you want to\nhelp people you can't really help people\nright now right like you're not in a\nposition to help people like David wants\nto support his family but\nhis capacity to support his family is\nvery limited so what you guys really\nneed to do is focus first on learning\nlearning developing and growing and and\nyou know a couple days ago on stream I\ntalked a little bit about like how to\nprepare for medical school like how to\nbe a good medical student and I tried to\nexplain to people that like what I try\nto explain to medical students is that\ngenerally speaking they want a z' and so\nlike they've gotten a's and they're\noriented towards a's their entire life\nno i mean this is the first 25 to 30\nyears of your life should be spent doing\nthis so until you're about thirty you\nshould be a Bromwich Anja\nit doesn't mean between the ages of so I\nguess if you guys want to do it that way\nlike well we'll say this will say zero\nto twenty five to thirty okay that's\nmaybe a better description so in terms\nof a medical student like their job is\nnot really to help anyone yet but like\nthey're also focused on grades so the\nquestion is what is their you know what\nis their daughter MA and what I try to\nexplain to them is like you should\nforget about grades and understand one\nday that you're gonna be you know\nsomeone's going to depend on you to save\ntheir life and so what you should be\ndoing is preparing for that fictional\npatient in the future one day someone is\ngonna walk into your door or you're\ngonna be at the mall or you're gonna be\nat a wedding in the first tier of being\na medical doctor there were two I dealt\nwith three medical emergencies where I\nwas the only doctor around like I went\nto two weddings and there were like\nmedical emergencies and then they were\nlike is there a doctor around I was like\n[ __ ] so understand that like as a\nmedical student\nyou know people are worried about grades\nand they're worried about success and\nthey're worried about a B and C don't\nworry about any of that which you should\nreally be doing is understanding that\nfor four years as a medical student\nyou're going to be taught medical\ninformation and whether you receive that\nmedical information well or not\ndetermines whether you were going to be\nable to save someone's life or whether\nsomeone's going to die and so that's\nreally the way that you should function\nand in terms of you guys you should be\nthe same way so you should understand\nthat for most of y'all y'all are\nbromwich ideas\nso what that means is that your purpose\nright now your real Dharma is\npreparation you don't know what that\nchallenge is going to look like you\ndon't know what you are gonna be called\nto do but you should prepare and grow as\nmuch as you can and by as much as I you\ncan what does that mean how do you focus\nit will kind of get to this later too\nbut I mean I think you that you guys\nshould absolutely acquire some kind of\nprofessional skill right so let's take I\nthink it was not David but that last guy\nI forgot his name was it David\nanyway so so that guy was kind of saying\nI'm not actually a product manager yet\nand then my response to him would be\nlike you should actually you know\nconsider becoming a product manager\nbecause at some point people may need\nyour help or you may realize okay I\nreally want to do a life coach and I\nneed to support myself while I grow my\nbusiness or I have a family or whatever\nand then he's not going to have any\nfinancial income to support himself and\nthen he's gonna have to Joe or yeah Joe\nand then he's gonna kind of be stuck so\nhe has to understand that like he has to\nsupport himself in his eventual Dharma\nof helping people like that's my path\nand I think you know it's worked well\nfor me because I don't have to I don't\nlike a case in point as like we're not\ncharging for the webinar like right so\nwe may charge for stuff I'm working way\nless so I'm working about 25 percent of\nwhat I did when I started twitch\nstreaming in October and that's still\nokay but like I'm working less and less\nas we start to make more and more money\nso that I can do stuff like this instead\nof seeing patients I'm spending more\ntime on healthy gamer but that like at\nany point you know I'm not dependent on\nthis income and I think that really like\nyou can support your Dharma if you're\ndependent on your internal for your\nincome which you absolutely can be at\nsome point it just compromises what\nyou're capable of so your purpose should\nreally be to learn and to develop and\ngrow and what does that mean so that\nmeans like acquiring a professional\nskill\n[Music]\nit also means like becoming personally\nstable and what this means is SWA the\neye or self study right so the\nbrahmacari are traditionally in India\nlike they included a lot of yoga and\nmeditation you would actually go to like\na temple in the in the wilderness or an\nashram and that's where you do your\neducation so you're taught like about\nlike everyone learns I read that\neveryone's learners yoga everyone learns\nmeditation and that stuff is actually\nlike more important than learning\nmathematics or finance or things like\nthat so like your guru would teach you\nall that stuff they teach you\nmathematics they teach you science they\nteach you medicine they teach you to\nmeditate they teach you yoga it's like a\nfull package whether you're staying at\nthis place where a monks live and that's\nwhere you're learning that's where\nschool is so in your case you guys\nshould absolutely gravitate towards a\nprofessional skill you should endeavor\nto become personally stable you should\nendeavor to become healthy so that means\nphysically mentally and spiritually and\nthe question is why it's because at some\npoint you guys are gonna face some\nchallenge right so let's go back to Joe\nonce again like when he starts his life\ncoaching business if he isn't like\nmentally stable and he starts helping\nother people and their stuff kind of\ncomes on to him then he's gonna really\nstruggle to like maintain a high level\nof performance like if he's not\nphysically mentally and spiritually\nprepared to try to help other people and\nhe may be able to handle like whatever\nkind of you know I'm not saying it's\nsmall but like whatever he's handling\nright now is it scales up and it becomes\nmore important and like let's say that\none day someone comes to him and says\nJoe I want to pay you a thousand a\nthousand dollars a week to work with me\nwhenever I want to work with you and\nwhat is Joe gonna say is he gonna treat\nthat person differently because they\nhave money is he gonna be compromised by\nmoney like what's gonna happen and so\nyou really need to become personally\nstable professionally stable and healthy\nand I want you guys to I was talking to\nto someone\nthis weekend they were kind of telling\nme that like you know when was the last\ntime they felt like their harmony their\nKarma and they were walking down the\nbeach great story and they saw someone\nwho was like strut like kind of drowning\nand they jumped into the water and they\nkind of helped them out unclear whether\nthey would have drowned whether they\nsaved their life or things like that\nunclear but they basically sort of saved\nthis person's life and the issue is that\nthat person takes care of themselves\nphysically like that's an important part\nof how they live their day but like if\nthey hadn't been a good swimmer and they\nweren't physically in shape they would\nnot have been able to do that and I was\nkind of asking them like what would have\nhappened if you didn't jump in and he\nwas like well they're a bunch of like\noverweight people who were watching for\nthe shoe from the shore and I would have\nbeen just like that so you don't know\nwhat challenges life is gonna throw at\nyou so you've got to just prepare for\nall of them and I want you guys to\nreally think about that and like think\nabout what are you preparing for like\nkovat is a good example of like you\ndon't know what the world is gonna send\nyour way so you guys should be preparing\nfor all of it\nprepare to make income because you don't\nknow what when you're gonna need money\nprepare to become personally stable and\nhealthy because you don't know what life\nis gonna call on you to do so the second\nphase is householder so this is when you\nmake money you have kids and all that\nkind of stuff so then you become like\nkind of professionally successful you\ncan start a family things like that and\nthen you start to transition away so\nthis is when you become helpful so after\nyou've made your money after your kids\nare kind of taken care of this hermas\nsort of these two that are mothers kind\nof settled then you kind of transition\naway and so I'd say like a beautiful\nexample of this is Bill Gates so Bill\nGates is a guy who like made his money\nlike raised his kids and now he's like\nfocused on helping the world the kind of\nDharma of service when people are asking\noh but I don't feel like helping people\nI don't really know if that's the kind\nof person I am I say yeah absolutely\nyou're not in a phase to help people yet\nthat happens later right so like I help\npeople because I'm sort of I mean I'm\nkind of here and here but actually\nhelping people comes later in life once\nyou're established and once your feet\nare firmly on the ground then your\ncapacity to help people\nincreases astronomically it doesn't mean\nthat you should turn people away if they\nneed your help tomorrow but I'm saying\nthat the kind of granddaughter Maya that\neveryone is envisioning where it's like\nParma with a capital D of like helping\nthe world and making the world a better\nplace for most people that comes later\nin life once they're established so\ndon't worry about that now which you\nguys should really be focusing on is\nthis in the last phase of life is son\nyes which is sort of like really\nrenunciation so that's when you kind of\ngive it all up and you devote yourself\ntowards like meditation and spiritual\nenlightenment and God and whatnot so\nmonks take Sun yes so you kind of you\nkind of give up you sort of say like\nokay I don't want any of this stuff I'm\njust gonna do like meditate all day so\nthose dudes in the Himalayas who are\nmeditating in caves they don't really\nhelp a bunch of people they don't really\ndo a whole lot they don't have kids\nthey're just taking some yes so you kind\nof go you kind of just go and focus on\nyourself okay so if you guys are some\nkind of saying how do I find my Dharma\nthe short answer is focus on this for\nnow just focus on growing and now we get\nto the last thing which I'm going to try\nto cover in about five minutes so the\nterm on in karma and a lot of people say\nhow do I find my karma and the short\nanswer is you don't your Dharma finds\nyou\nright so in Soviet in in the u.s. we\nwatch television and in Soviet Russia\ntelevision watches you so the short\nanswer is like for those of you guys who\nare worrying about helping people like\nwe can see for example that your karma\nis going to determine your thought of\nmine what do I mean by that karma is\nkind of like circumstance or the hand\nyou're dealt in life and basically like\nthe the Dharma that you have is going to\npresent itself to you and you just need\nto be ready for it right so like if\nyou're walking down the beach and\nsomeone is drowning like that\nit's not something finding your Dharma\nin that moment has nothing to do with\nwhat you've sought right so Dharma is\nnot like Sean like Dharma presents\nitself right there definitely exercises\nyou can do to kind of like start to\nthink through what your Dharma is but\neven now your Dharma is presenting\nitself and we can see that from David so\nlike you know who here is is has the\ncapacity to help people like David does\nlike who here as David's Dharma david\nhas his Dharma because it was given to\nhim I have my Dharma because it was\ngiven to him given to me do we think\nabout like what's my entire mats to help\ngamers well like how did that happen\nright just think about this for a second\nyou know I spent years of my life kind\nof being addicted to video games and\nsucking at life and dealing with shame\nand all that kind of crap and I thought\nthat all of that stuff was a waste of\ntime but that's my Karma those were my\ncircumstances and I lived through that\nand I'm glad that it went that way\nbecause if I had a 4.0 GPA and was like\nawesome at life from the get-go I\ncouldn't actually help you guys so like\neven the things that you think when you\nwhen you live your life and you're like\noh I can't find my daughter my I'm\nsitting at home I'm not doing anything I\nwant you guys to understand I was in the\nsame exact boat in my 20s and I wasn't\ndoing anything and despite that or even\nteens that was part of my karma and that\nreinforced what my Dharma was gonna be\nand so my god about was to sort of suck\nat life and then I had certain\nopportunities and I made good choices I\ndecided to you know spend time and get\ninto yoga and stuff like that but even\nthat I was drawn to it it felt like a\ncalling to me and then I still invested\nthat time and that energy into learning\nthat stuff and then I was like okay well\nnow I'm like married and like I'm in\nlove with this girl I wasn't married but\nI was in love with this girl and I was\nlike now what am I gonna do I'm not\ngonna become a monk that's like re I\nmight as well become a doctor and so I\nwas like okay like I'll become a doctor\nand this is this is the other\ninteresting thing so we think of Kurt\nlike jobs as goals this doesn't actually\ninspire you to put your best forward\nwhen a job is a means\nto an end then you're gonna put your\nbest foot forward when your job becomes\npart of your Dharma your job isn't your\nDharma but it becomes part of your\ntournament so I've decided okay like I'm\ngonna become a doctor and like I didn't\nwant to be a doctor because that was my\ndaughter my it wasn't like I'm gonna\nsave lives that was ego I was just like\nI'm gonna do this thing because it's\ngonna support the other things that I\nwant to do and and you know so I was\nlike okay fine so I sit what kind of\narbitrary to be honest like it was like\nwhy I become a doctor it's like kind of\nwhy not and oddly enough that why not\nness allows you to become detached and\nonce you become detached it's easier to\nact because like I was just like okay\nI'm gonna become a doctor I'm gonna try\nthe hardest that I can and if it happens\nit happens if it doesn't it doesn't and\nB D okay but kind of going back to the\nharmonic Karma because I feel like I'm\nkind of scattered so what I mean is that\nyour Dharma is going to present itself\nand all you really need to do is prepare\nand act when the time is right and your\nyour Dharma is determined by your Karma\nso we can see this very clearly in David\nDavid's Dharma is very clear because his\nKarma has given him a certain set of\ncircumstances my Dharma is very clear\nbecause I have a set of circumstances\ngive me a second and so your Dharma will\nbecome clear when you are given a set of\ncircumstances and we can see that this\nwith jo21 second\nand so I want don't want you guys to\nworry too much as crazy as it sounds\nabout finding your Dharma with a capital\nD because we can sort of see it emerging\nlike it we can see it emerging with\nDavid we can see it emerging with Joe so\nbe it so like if Joe wants to help\npeople start helping people but don't\nabandon your life don't give up on your\ncareer just because you like want to be\na life coach like I don't think that\nthat's a good idea I mean I think that\nwhen you're ready you can you know\nyou'll be\nand in the meantime like lightly your\nkarma your karma will tell you what you\nneed to do okay so if you guys are\nlooking for your Dharma that's okay like\ngood you should look and you should seek\nbut at the same time I wouldn't get too\nworried because your karma is going to\npresent your Dharma to you when it's\nyour time and in the meantime your real\nfocus is actually to prepare this is\nyour tournament right now more than\nanything else okay and then karma will\nlet you know when it's when it's time\nlike it'll come knocking and we can see\nit with people right we see it with\nmyself we see it with David we see it\nwith Joe that he shouldn't I mean if he\nwants to build a practices life coach\nhow early cannot can it happen it can\nhappen very early it can happen like\nwhen you're five Dharma can present\nitself at any time if you guys don't\nknow what you're supposed to do don't\nworry about it oddly enough and prepare\nyourself for what may come and there are\nalso exercises and stuff that we can do\nso I'm gonna leave you guys with one\nlast exercise which is how to find the\njob of your dreams okay and I know this\nis sounds kind of weird but this is this\nis kind of what I want you guys to do\nokay so I know where I'm just talking\nabout you know don't focus on finding a\njob at cetera but if you guys are\nlooking for structure for preparation\nthis is what I want you guys to do okay\nso let's do this first location so I'm\ngonna try to tie things together okay so\nlet's say that I want to be I want to\nwork at Riot Games how should you\nstructure your preparation if you want\nto work at Riot Games like you know I I\ndon't know how to do that so this is\nwhat I want you guys to do like I want\nyou guys to think about what you would\nlike doing or what you would like to try\nand then you're gonna so we're\njust gonna go to this website and this\nis gonna tie together a lot of different\nstuff okay so like you were just gonna\nlook like as I like League of Legends\nand I think it's cool and so we're just\ngonna look at this right so like okay do\nI want to be a lead artist not really I\ndon't want to do animation brand new\nmanagement that's kind of cool like\ncreative and IP development that sounds\nneat\nso let's just pick this then what we do\nis we look at our responsibilities\nokay so manage product lifestyle from\ngame concept to launch and post launch\npromote the game its vision and core\nmechanics across right across riot\nensure the game's marketing fit game\nensure the game and marketing fit the\nbrand strategy through partnering with\nRiots global publishing team manage\nin-game content planning blah blah blah\nand then we get to required\nqualifications and then we get to\ndesired qualifications and this sounds\nlike a lot right so like if you think\nabout this this is like oh wow like five\nyears of marketing experience with at\nleast three years in the video game\nindustry oh my goodness this sounds\nterrible okay so now what we're gonna do\nso now what I want you guys to do is\nlike like take this and make these check\nboxes so like start a grab a piece of\npaper turn this into its checkbox turn\nthis into a check box turn this into a\ncheck box turn this into a check box\nturn all of these into check boxes and\nyou may look at this and you may say\nlike oh actually I can't do this like\nthere's no way like I have to get a\nmaster's degree and then five years of\nexperience this is gonna happen a decade\nlater there's no way I'm gonna be able\nto do this that's okay don't worry about\nthat then what I want you guys to do is\nstart the first thing like look at these\ncheck boxes and work like let check the\nfirst like try to figure out how to get\nstarted right so then what I want you\nguys to do is let's look through this\nand let's let's figure out can we do\nanything on this list\nokay produce high-quality game assets\nfor marketing campaigns I don't know how\nto do that\npresent products to all audiences I\ndon't know how to do that manage\ncommunications\nacross a worldwide organization I don't\nknow how to do that requires some travel\noh hey look at this guy's plays games\nweekly on console mobile and PC check\nnumber one just think about that okay\ngreat\nso then let's look at some of this other\nstuff proficiency with net based\nsprinkler brand watch or other\nequivalent tools so then what we're\ngonna do is we're gonna say okay I don't\neven know what that is net base tutorial\n[Music]\nat base comm okay so then we're gonna\nread this we're gonna read this we're\ngonna read this and then can we see\nlet's see\nnet base certification okay is this\nstill let me just make sure this is\nstill streaming okay good so we're gonna\nread this full product details can be\nfound here ah fail let's go back to net\nbase customers okay so we're gonna we're\ngonna see what we can learn here right\nso there may be tutorials so net base\nand then what else do we need\nsprinkler hey on-demand learning public\ntraining set oh look public training\nsessions great right so what we're gonna\ndo is we're gonna do offers virtual\nwebinars okay certification programs\nokay so we're not gonna login here but\nwe're gonna look at that and then what I\nwant you guys to do is you're like okay\nI want to learn I want to be a brand\nmanager at Riot Games because I think\nsocial media is cool and I like I like\nglobal worldwide organization global\nstrategies that sounds kind of neat so\nyou guys already checked number one and\nthen what you're gonna do is like during\nCova dover the next month you're gonna\nlearn these two right and then once you\ncheck these two then you're gonna have\nsome qualifications you're gonna see\nwhat else can i do okay do i have a\nbachelor's degree in marketing\ncommunications or business related field\nokay and then what's gonna happen after\nyou do this is you're gonna be like oh\nthat's kind of cool I actually like that\nand then you're gonna decide like okay\ndo I want to actually do\nkind of stuff or not understanding\nsocial media platforms right so we're\ngonna watch Devin Nash's stream a little\nbit and then we're gonna kind of go from\nthere we're gonna start learning this\nstuff and then the interesting thing is\nlike let's say you've finished half of\nyour college or you dropped out after\none semester then you decide okay I'm\ngonna go to college I'm gonna go back to\ncollege because like I actually do want\nto do this stuff I think it's really\ncool and the neat thing is that right\nnow when you guys go to college like you\ndon't actually care about anything that\nyou learn right you're like ah it's\ncollege but now you're like okay I need\na bachelor's degree and while you're in\ncollege it becomes way more fun because\ncollege is no longer an end it's not a\ngoal you're like oh I need college to\nget a good job it's actually College as\none of the pieces that's required to get\nthe job of your dreams and you're gonna\nmajor in marketing because but but\nthat's weird because marketing is for\nlosers and I want to major in law or\naccounting or medicine or computer\nscience or statistics or mathematics and\nthen while you're going through college\nevery step of the way you're gonna be\ngoing to your professors and you're\ngonna ask be asking them hey do you know\nanyone who uses brand watch or other\nequivalent tools do you know where I can\nget experience understanding brand\ncampaign indicators metrics are\nanalytics you're going to go to your\nprofessors and you're gonna ask them\nthese questions and then your professors\nare gonna look at you and they're gonna\nbe like wow this kid is like super super\nmotivated and they're gonna say yeah\nactually I have a buddy who works in a\ncompany I'm gonna set you up with an\ninternship and then you're gonna get an\ninternship or you're gonna start\napplying for internships and then what's\ngonna happen is you're gonna put\ntogether a resume at some point and\nsince you guys used a month very\nproductively during COBIT cove in\nlearning net base and sprinkler\nyou're gonna on your resume you're gonna\nsay I am Joe David and I'm 21 years old\nand my qualifications are I've completed\ntwo years of college and I have a 2.8\nGPA you don't have to advertise that if\nyou don't want to and then you can say\nnext in the next line but beneath that\nis certified in net base sprinkler and\nbrand watch and you're gonna say like\nyou know completed a marketing project\nused brand campaign indicators metric\nmetrics and analytics to develop a media\ncreative media strategy that's what\nyou're gonna say on your resume and then\nsuddenly six months from now you guys\nare in college again and you've got that\non your resume and do you guys see how\nlike that's a real thing like you're a\nreal person now and when you apply to\nfor an internship in a company they're\nlike oh god this guy actually knows\nsomething in between from now to even\nthree months or six months from now\nwhere you had nothing now you've got a\nresume and it's a real resume and like\nyou don't like you're there and then you\nhave an internship so then what happens\nit like you get an internship and then\nwhat happens is like you you like you\napply for the next internship so you go\nto Riot Games and then you say I'm a I'm\nan undergrad I've done an internship\nwith this company you have a letter of\nrecommendation from your professor this\nis one semester this is like right now\nit's April right so we're gonna go\nthrough the summer and then we're gonna\nenroll in college in the fall we're\ngonna apply now because now we actually\ncare about applying and then come\nNovember of 2020 you're gonna apply to\nRiot Games and you're gonna say I'm\nlooking for an internship I'm highly\nmotivated I'm I'm familiar with brand\nwatch sprinkler this and this I did my\nproject on this and then I did an\ninternship at this company where I\nfocused on using industry trends\npartnerships and branded learning the\nbranded content landscape and I am\ninterested in an internship where I can\nlet's think about this how would I say\nthis I'm interested in gaining knowledge\nof the development the game development\nprocess and life cycle so that I can\nbuild a uniform brand strategy that that\ncombines brain game development with\nlike market analytics to create like a\ngood product that lands well with its\naudience and is also globally branded so\nlike impact multiple markets or some\n[ __ ] like that you say this is what I'm\nlooking for and\nthen suddenly like you're like a real\nperson and like if you're a you know I\ndon't know really know people at Riot\nGames I mean who actually do we're done\nbut you know we've met some of them but\nwhen I think about you know when I'm\nreviewing applications like what do I\nlook for it's stuff like this and so if\nyou guys think about this like you can\ndo this right like this is something\nthat you can manage on your own and and\nit's not hard and like now we sort of\nget to like sort of the the summary of\neverything so we talked about motivation\nwe talked about procrastination we\ntalked about avoidance of emotions we\ntalked about chunking up tasks we talked\nabout and thought about in preparation\nin Bromwich Aria this is everything tied\ntogether do you guys see that so the\nfirst thing is you're not motivated\nbecause you don't understand what your\ngoals are your goals are way too\nabstract you're procrastinating because\nyou haven't chunked up tasks properly\nand you feel like shame and you feel\nbored and you don't know what your\nentire mised so you're not doing\neverything this process combines all of\nthat stuff\nwe're chunking up tasks we're stepping\naway from shame because you're learning\nsomething before you even like you go to\ncollege so you're gonna you're gonna be\nlike the one student in your marketing\nclass which is filled with a bunch of\nfreshmen and instead of feeling shame\nbecause you're 21 and sitting in a class\nwith a bunch of eighteen year olds those\neighteen year olds have no idea what\nthey're doing with life and you're\nshowing up with your professor and\nyou're saying I'm certified and brand\nwatch and sprinkler\nI'd like to better understand Kim brand\ncampaign indicators metrics and\nanalytics can you please help me and\nthen all the 18 year olds are gonna look\nat you really like who the [ __ ] is this\nguy\nand then like that's it\nlike all of the procrastination like\nbecomes way easier the motivation starts\nhappening naturally you're starting to\nprepare yourself for your Dharma and\nthen one or two years down the road you\nmay realize oh actually I don't like\nthis but then that's actually perfectly\nfine because then you just make a career\npivot let's say that what you actually\nwant to do is not brand management but\nyou want to do like game development and\nthen you're like okay I actually want to\nbuild video games so then what you\nactually do is you're like oh man like\nthis sucks because all these people who\nhave built video games are gonna be more\nexperienced than me but I want you guys\nto think about this for a second when\nyou apply for your next job to be a game\ndeveloper you do that some of this\nprocess as well so you\nlearn how to like program or whatever\nand then on your application it says\nthat I want to design video games and I\nhave a background in in marketing\nanalytics brand campaign indicators and\nI believe I offer a unique advantage\nover your other programmers because\nwhile I am developing a video game I\nhave a knowledge of the brand side of\nthings and what kind of video game\ndevelopment will be well-suited to be\nlike marketed globally across you know\nmarket and grow globally in my\nappreciation for metrics and analytics\nallows me to like do an iterative\nprocess of game development that allows\nthe game to be more accessible and like\nbetter played it's not just mechanics I\nunderstand the branding stuff too and\nthen you think about this like so\nthey're gonna get like applications for\nprogrammers right and they're gonna look\nat your application and they're gonna be\nlike oh this guy is disadvantaged\nbecause he understands brand Analects\nknow it's dumb right I don't know what\nmy dream job is fine so pick something\nwhat do you want to do like what do you\nwant to do start there that's fine you\ndon't need a dream job like you're not\ngonna actually like I'm not you think\nthat the first thing that you're gonna\npick is gonna be like what you invest\neight years doing forget about that pick\nsomething that you think is cool and\njust start there and this is exactly why\nI'm talking to you guys about the pivot\nthe pivot is because you don't have to\npick your dream job you just have to\npick a job and if you kind of like it\nyou can pivot into other fields okay so\nlisten last thing we're gonna end with\nso let's stop screen share and give me a\nsecond okay\nlast thing I mean I kind of know the\nanswer to this but let's just ask okay\nso questions at the end or in the middle\nthat's stupid I know the answer but\nwe'll ask anyway because shouldn't make\nassumptions\nI want to just get this data right now\nbut that's that's kind of how we tie\nthings together okay at the end easy\nokay\nso great job today guys we're gonna\nhopefully this makes sense\nwe did meditation earlier but yeah so\nwe'll see you guys tomorrow and I'll try\nto outline some of this stuff like a\nlittle bit more like by the way this\nwhole find a job of your dreams thing is\nactually like a YouTube good thing that\nI've sort of developed but so hopefully\nyou guys can kind of see like I want you\nguys to just think about that and think\nabout your notes for motivation and\nprocrastination and see how motivation\nand procrastination would be affected by\nthis plan okay and we're gonna stream\ntoday in about an hour in ten minutes so\nI got to run thanks guys"
