    "transcript": "as we resist Cravings our brain begins\nto learn what kind of signals do I need\nto send to this Dum to get what I want\nand so the real paradoxical thing that\nwe see in addiction is that the more\npatients resist and fail the more\nintensive their Cravings become so this\nis what's really different about\naddiction right because if we look at\nmost things in life as we fight against\nthings even if we lose we get better\nover time so if I go to the gym and I\nlift a bunch of weight and I can't lift\nlet's say this high amount of weight the\nnext time I go to the gym I'll be better\nat it my muscles will grow my muscles\nwill adapt if I play chess over time\nI'll get better at it I'll get better at\nswimming I'll get better at reading I'll\nget better at studying I'll understand\nmore mathematics more calculus but\naddiction is the one interesting thing\nwhere the more that you fight it the\nworse off you become"
