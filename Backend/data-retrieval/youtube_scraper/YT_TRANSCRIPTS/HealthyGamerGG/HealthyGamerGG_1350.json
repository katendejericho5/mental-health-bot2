    "transcript": "I'm smiling because I think you're an\nabsolute failure and I think that that's\nperfectly okay I think that I was a\nfailure too\nand failure is not the end of the road\nit's the beginning right so now you can\nreally start to live your life because\nyou can you've you have you have burned\ndown potential you've burned down the\nidea of I will always been able to do\nthings faster than everyone else\nall of that expectation and potential\nyou're actually free of it it's a burden\nand every every ounce of projected\nfailure that ounce of projected failure\ncomes from an ounce of expectation do\nyou see that like you can't fail if you\ndon't expect\nwhat am i calling you friend Zack Zack\nand so apologies first of all Zack for\nour setback on Monday I had locate I'd\ngone to a slightly different location\nthat had poor internet so now I've\ndecided to move back to my underground\nbunker but yes I I I'm really I'm sorry\nabout that I hope that was kind of okay\nfor you but yeah that was fine actually\nkind of worked out well I got some other\nstuff that happened at that time so cool\nwell neat so tell me a little bit Zack\ngum you know help me understand a little\nbit about why you're coming on today and\nhow we can be helpful yeah so right now\nand actually the last like three and a\nhalf months or so I've been unemployed\nand living in my parents basements and\nmaking almost no progress in getting out\nof that because I spend pretty much\nevery waking hour of the day playing\nvideo games and watching anime and stuff\nvideo games and anime yes\nfolksy video games okay um browsing\nreddit usual the Holy Trinity yeah\nreddit anime Trinity of not getting\nanyway yeah yeah so like obviously I'm\nin this best situation and things I I\nmean not even a year ago like six months\nago was in grad school working towards\ngetting my PhD oh wow yeah and then I\nhad a whole bunch of stressful stuff\nthat happened over a couple months in\nthere that slowly leads to me dropping\nout and yeah now I have no idea where to\ngo with my life and I'm kind of stuck\nhere can you tell us a little bit about\nthe stressful stuff it's a bit of story\nbecause it was a series of things so for\nthe first year or so of my PhD I had\nmade very little progress in my research\noh are you getting a PhD\nnear the neuroscience branch of\nbiomedical engineering okay I was at the\nUniversity of Utah\nso I was I went there and started\nworking for this professor he was new\nand had some projects and one of them\ninterested me so I was working with him\nand after about a year I didn't really\nmake any progress which was kind of to\nbe expected because it was chemistry\nrelated and chemistry sometimes you just\nnothing works the way you expect it to\nand you don't know why because you can't\nsee the things that you're interacting\nwith but I didn't really get anywhere in\na year and so he was kind of upset I was\nupset that nothing was happening we\nweren't getting anywhere so I had some\nstress that was building up because of\nthat because things weren't going along\nas was expected and there's necessarily\nconflicts between us but it was sort of\nlike passive aggressiveness um we just\ndidn't I was just sort of getting\noverwhelmed well the stuff those happen\nto do and then this was roughly like\nAugust or September what are you having\nto do just lots of work I guess was that\ndifferent from before kind of put this\nhaving to do with classes and research\nat the same time rather than just\nclasses was more than I was used to and\nthen also I would do what I thought was\nan adequate amount of work for the day\nlike maybe six eight hours in the lab\nand he was like you know so such isn't\ndone you need to be here more what I\ndidn't like the idea of spending what\nwould the head abs to be 10 12 plus\nhours a day and weekends in order to get\nall of them okay so when you say\noverwhelmed\nwell we'll help me understand what we're\ntalking about a little bit more\nprecisely so one is that he's upset with\nyou one is you're not accomplishing what\nhis expectations are male-male p.i yes\nokay he is principal investigator by the\nway so you're so you were in someone's\nlab and he was saying you need to be\nhere for like did he did he use those\nnumbers or no but is so the experiment I\nwas working on he wanted me to like each\nsuch each of the tests I would do he\nwanted me to do each test and like\nroughly a day the test though takes\nabout 12 hours to do there's a breaking\npoint in the middle where I'm capable of\nlike pausing it okay not losing any\nprogress at about six to eight hours so\nI was going up to that point and then\ndoing the other half the next day okay\nhe wants to do it like all at once go go\ngo okay one test today and so there was\na differential expectation set in terms\nof what you wanted to do and what he\nwanted you to do yeah okay so just about\nlike any other ph.d program yes you get\nit like kind of to be expected\nyes and so so I'm confused about so it\nwas overwhelming as you had classes on\ntop of that and you weren't doing\nexperiments but during the first half of\nyour first year or what um yeah so like\nI was I mean obviously like in undergrad\nit was just classes maybe I had like a\njob on the side that I do a couple hours\nevery now and then but like I wasn't\nreally doing 12 hours back and I come in\nand I knew like I was gonna have to put\nin a lot of work but I didn't really\nrealize exactly what that meant\nespecially when I was applying to\nschools and people from this school were\nlike yeah like all the professors here\nreally chill they don't make you work\nweekends like other professors at other\nschools it's like wow that sounds like\nso fit for me because I don't really\nlike spending so many hours of my life\non my shirt so I went into this you know\nexpecting to do like some hard work but\nI've through everything else I've done\nand through all of undergrad and\neverything I've always been able to get\nthings done faster than everyone else so\nI was like I'll be able to do the same\nthing\nhere and then yeah then when I sort of\nsat down and realized I'm gonna have to\ndo all my classes I have to teach a lab\ncourse because I have to do ta stuff and\nthen I have to do all this research in a\nday I have to be talking to other\nprofessors trying to get my committee\nassembled and trying to communicate with\npeople from other areas and also have to\ndeal with all the stuff in my apartment\nand paying for rent and everything like\nthat for which it was just a lot of\nstuff and I'm so he's suspending more of\nmy time not doing this sure I want to\njust highlight something that you said I\ndon't know exactly what the significance\nof this is I've always been able to get\nthings done faster than everyone else\nokay yeah I want to just note that and\nokay so so then then what happened so it\nsounds like you didn't want to spend 10\nto 12 hours a day in the lab you had a\nlot ya struggle in terms of life\nresponsibilities classes committee stuff\nteaching it's a lot yeah yeah it was a\nlot so I was to an extent like I mean I\nwould sort of did my 6-hour thing for\nresearch and all my other stuff I was\nlike yeah you want me to do this stuff\nbut it's just not possible and so I just\nread didn't do those things and I did\nthat and then after year we I didn't\nmake any progress so now there's what\ndoes it not make any progress means um\nso I guess I'll have to get a little bit\ninto the specifics for that I was trying\npart of my research was to make these\nspecial particles I guess you could say\nand it was supposed to be just like a\nreplication of what someone else had\ndone and another paper and I actually\ntalked to her in person as well she\nexplained to me the process you were\njust redoing it with a different set of\nchemicals and in theory it should be\npossible and pretty easy and we planned\non it only taking like a month to figure\nit out it's 12 months in no matter how I\ncombined these things and we're buying\nother stuff online and trying other\nthings nothing is working it so did you\nduplicate exactly what she did with her\nchemicals yes\nokay and even tried freaking out okay\nyou know controlling for all of the\ndifferent variables and changing\neverything which there was a bit of\nconflict and he wanted things happened\nfast so he was like just change these\nfive variables all at once if it doesn't\nwork then chop these other five\nvariables and I'm like we don't know if\nthese variables interact with each other\nneed to do them one at a time and so\nthere's a little bit of conflict they're\ntrying to get that settles and again no\nmatter what things I change eventually I\njust have to give in and change five\nvariables at a time and sure enough it\ndoesn't work sure now we don't know why\nwhich one was the faults of that and\nyeah a year in I haven't made these\ndon't know why they don't work or what\nvariables are a factor sometimes I run\nthe same experiment twice and get\ndifferent results and it's just like I'm\ncompletely in the dark no idea what's\ngoing on yeah so yeah so that that\nhappens for like a year or so you know\nyou're not really getting anywhere and\nstill trying things out and then around\nthis time points there was someone\nreminded me about I think it's an NIH\ngrant it's something that like all grad\nstudents apply for and like their\nfreshman and sophomore year some like\nbig national grants or whatever okay and\nI was like oh I had forgotten about that\nand that's coming up soon and I need to\nhave part of my research done so that I\ncan have something to write about in\nthere and I also needs to go get people\nfrom back and undergrad to write me\nletters of recommendation and I don't\neven know who to talk to at this point\nfor that I also have to figure out what\nI'm gonna write about what the\nrecommendations are what the\nrequirements are and so now I have\nanother thing on my plate that I have to\nworry about and that that built up some\nstress and there is other stuff going on\npart of it was you know I just ignore\nthat for a little while and then work on\nthe other things I had to do so of\ncourse it just keeps blowing keeps\nbuilding cuz I'm procrastinating things\nuntil sort of the first major breakpoint\nwas there was a meeting amongst grad\nstudents for this great it was students\nwho had already gotten the grant\nsuccessfully we're teaching those who\nhadn't how to write our papers so I went\nto that meeting and sat down and they\nstarted talking about how to write about\nyour achievements and other things that\nyou've done because that's one of the\nimportant aspects of it and the\nachievements that they listed out and\nthat everyone else in the room talked\nabout we're just so much greater than\nanything that I had done at that point\nthat I immediately got impostor syndrome\nwhat do you mean by impostor syndrome\nlike I felt like I had gotten there by\naccident that I totally didn't belong I\nhad not achieved anything of great worth\ncompared to what these people have done\nand that they were all aware of what\nthey were doing and knew how to do go\nabout their research and that I was\nblowing him dark and that I hadn't been\nmade any progress because I didn't know\nwhat I was doing and that I was\ncompletely lost\nokay and that it was a fluke that I had\nended up in this program because I was\nbig and stupid and didn't know what I\nwas gonna didn't know what to write\nabout and all that other stuff and yeah\nI was I was really overwhelmed because\nso many people I swear like one of them\nlike went to Africa and cured malaria\nand a tribe or something like this is\nwild stuff that they were doing mm-hmm\nit was like what have I done with my\ntime I've gone home and spent my free\ntime playing video games like I've\nalways done I haven't achieved anything\nlike these people yeah see yeah that\nthat felt like [ __ ] at that moment and\njust all the stress of everything\nbuilding up to that point and then this\ncorner core I guess you could say\nmoments of realization even though it's\nnot really reality in the sense I know\nthat it was a cause of syndrome but what\ndo you eat Irishman can you tell us\nabout some of those again like looking\nat it from this perspective I mean now I\nknow that it was just my brain making\nthings up and saying what you know like\na moment of realizing that\nI don't belong here I know now is\nimposter syndrome but at the time when I\nreally stress out like that I'm thinking\nI'm realizing that I don't belong here\nI'm realizing that getting here I wasn't\nthis crazy smart person getting into\nthis program I actually don't belong\nhere\nbut you've always been able to do things\nfaster than everyone else yeah I know\nright like it's it's this weird conflict\nthat goes on in my head but so yeah at\nthat moment I sort of I guess you could\nsay snaps and I packed up my stuff I\nwalked out of the meeting early I got on\nthe train I curled up in the ball on the\nseat and then tried to forget everything\nand pretend that it didn't happen which\ndidn't work but not in the slightest\nand so then I kept feeling stressed out\nand like at some point in there I want\nto see a university therapist to try and\nhelp me through these things good for\nyou and the next major breaking point\nthat I guess was sort of the peak and\ncaused the down spiral was when my pee I\nsaid that I had to he came up to me we\nhad a lab meeting the next day he said\noh by the way the meeting that we had\ntomorrow whoever was presenting isn't\ngonna present it said you're going to\npresent your outline on this spring now\nI had written anything this was like\nfour o'clock in the afternoon I had to\ngo to another lab across campus to do\nmore research that day and had a\nhomework assignment due that night so I\nstayed up until like 3:00 a.m. working\non this presentation once I finally got\nhome and then I go in of course it's\ncrap because I'm super tired and I'd\nhaven't gotten any sleep and he just\nbeats the crap out of me in this\npresentation about how bad everything is\nwhat does he say and it was just I can't\neven remember now this is like six\nmonths ago but\nit was it was like the the topics that I\nwas talking about weren't goods\nI wasn't communicating the right points\nI wasn't explaining it and I was\nspinning in too much detail it wasn't\nsimple enough for like layman's terms\nunderstands I was focusing on the wrong\npoints\nI didn't again like for the achievements\nthat I've done that sort of a big\nportion of this I didn't have anything\nand I didn't know what to talk about\nand also in my presentation he was even\nnitpicking things like my graphs were\ndone in Excel and it's not Matt well\nwhen they should be done in MATLAB\nthat's unacceptable and so I had sort of\nin that looks to the other lab members\nfor like please for the love of God help\nme and none of them did anything they\njust agreed with him they're like yeah\nyou should work on those things I'm like\nokay for support from someone else and\nthey left you out in the cold\nyeah and so again like let's just had\nbeen constantly building up for last\ncouple of months to this point and\nthere's already a breaking point\nso it kept building from there and then\nthis happens so I went home that day and\nI got off the train and I was walking\ndown the side what's in my house and I\nknow why this is so hard to say\nI had looks I had stopped on the\nsidewalk and turned towards the road and\nconsidered walking into traffic\nsure and yeah that was that was a moment\nI didn't what\nwhat are you feeling as you try to say\nthat I hit\noh no it's funny cuz like thinking about\nokay how am I gonna tell the story I've\nbeen through this exact moment several\ntimes in my head I don't really feel\nanything yep then that saying is\ndifferent\nyep very very important observation so\nwhat are you feeling as you say it are\nyou feeling something good are you\nfeeling something bad bad um are you\ngetting a piece of what it was like to\nstand on that side walk a little bit\nit's what I'm feeling is like the\nreality of how severe it was good tell\nus about that so\nrestating you know everything that I've\nexperienced again saying it feels like\nit wasn't that big of a deal\nlike yes there was a lot of stress and\nthings but it's all like I'm listening\nout like things that I guess you could\nsay normal grad students go through lots\nof worker things had to do and I'm\nthinking normal grad students this\nwasn't anything extreme but then\nthinking about that moment there it's\nlike no it was it was a lot worse is\nthat can you just pose us about your\nreality in that moment that everything's\n[ __ ] beautifully put\nwhat does that mean I was in a dark\nplace I wasn't what made it dark join\nwhat I was doing my outlook on life and\nthe world was very negative in what way\nwas it negative I didn't really see much\nof the positives of life and I viewed\neverything I guess from like very\npessimistic viewpoint so to add in a\nlittle bit to that a lot of the reddit\ndiscussion that I was viewing around\nthis time was about corruption and stuff\nin the world and so I was latching on to\nthat things like global warming whatnot\nwhich all helps contribute to it and\nthen it was like I'm a victim of this I\nhad lots of views that academia and I\nactually still kind of agree with these\nthe academia is very corrupt and isn't\nwhat it's supposed to be it's supposed\nto be about doing research to learn\nabout things that we don't understand\nand instead it's about writing papers to\nget money and a lot of papers are just\nmade-up crap\njust so that they can get funded and it\nwas like I am in I went into this to do\nsomething nice and great and it said I'm\nhere in this corrupt situation being\nmanipulated by the people above me who\nare just in it to get money and\neverything is boxing how does it feel to\nbe manipulated\nhow does it feel terrible part of the\nmeat that goes into the meat grinder\ngrinder that is a ph.d program feels\nawful like oh my god how do people do\nthat how do people know it's it's like\nsuper depressing\nit's what's depressing about it tell me\nthe thoughts Zac what were the thoughts\nthat were going through your head\nbecause it's not fair there we go\nright cuz in your head you don't think\nthis is super depressing yeah what do\nyou think in your head stressed out I\nwhat you think in your head overwhelmed\nit's not what you think in your head\nyeah I'm thinking that I put in a lot of\neffort to get here I followed all the\nrules\nI followed the guidelines there we go\nand what you followed the rules and what\nand what happened I got this point word\nthe higher-ups are using minions they're\ntaking my labor they're paying me\nnothing\nthey're expecting needs to do things\nthat I can't do good what else I\nfollowed the rules and what I got but\nyeah I'd say got let down as I\nunderstand you got fuck-buddy yeah\nyou're taking my time did you feel alone\nmm-hmm oh yeah I can only imagine right\nso sitting there is your professor tears\nyou a new [ __ ] in your lab meeting\nand then all of all of the other grad\nstudents are kind of like right no one's\nyeah and then you no one's protecting\nyou especially when the other lab\nmembers are like making progress on\ntheir stuff and I'm not and now it's\nvery isolating to feel like you're the\nonly one going through it because you\nare right everyone else is sitting here\nwhat are you doing yeah absolutely\nnothing you're failing it's like being\nin a classroom of kids who can read and\nyou can't yeah yeah\nwhen we talk about feeling overwhelmed\nwhat were you what were the thoughts\nthere stuff like again this is this is\ntoo much I can't do this too many\nexpectations of me how can I fake it and\nmake it seem like I'm doing the work but\nI'm not how do other people get through\nit\nokay can I I I think those are the I\nthink those make sense I'm gonna so I\ncan't do this\nand how can I fake it I think there's\nanother kind of level to that which is\nthat how can I push off failure you\ncan't do this but I don't want to fail\nquite yet is there anything I can do but\nyou know that the failure is coming you\nfeel if the failure is coming and is\nthere anything you can scrape together\nto prevent going into bankruptcy like\ntoday yeah can I push out this failure\nand push out this failure and push out\nthis failure and each time you push out\nthe failure you try to buy yourself some\ntime to where maybe people won't notice\nmaybe you can pull it together maybe you\ncan fix it and the more time that goes\non the failure becomes more and more and\nmore certain and you push it out and you\npush it out and you push it out and\nyou're faking it and you're faking it\nand everyone's making progress and it's\nbecoming more and more inevitable\nmmm-hmm is that how you felt yeah yeah\ndefinitely how does that feel\n[Music]\nagain like I just belong that I should\nnever have gone to grad school in the\nfirst place and that it was a huge\n[ __ ]\ndo you sell it was the only offer you're\na huge [ __ ]\nI guess both like there's there's a\nperspective of I'm a huge [ __ ] cuz I\ncan't do this but also it was a huge\nbuck up decision to put myself in a\nsituation when I should have known that\nI could've done this I should have known\nlike why did I think that I was so\ncapable I've always been able to get\nthings done faster than everyone else\nyeah and yeah\nthat's a lot Zach yeah so tell us tell\nus what so you're walking home you're\nconsidering stepping into traffic\nwhy didn't you I thought they would hurt\nwhat did you decide to do then so it was\nfear that kept you from stepping in\ntraffic traffic huh was mine it's hard\nto explain if it was really fear is\nagain it was the thought that like this\nwill hurt I really like that yeah I'll\nfigure it out later\nso what did you do enzyme I walked home\nand I lied down a bit I cried and then\nand I think I took a nap or something I\njust like fell asleep then I woke up at\nlike 8 o'clock or something and then\nmade dinner plates of videogames what\ndid you play\nI don't remember okay what are you\nplaying nowadays Prince Cape lots and\nlots and lots of runescape okay and what\nare your parents think right now I mean\nI don't know exactly what their thoughts\nare but my mom has like I say I think I\nfeel like she chides me and like bothers\nme a lot when realistically it's like\nmaybe once every two weeks you'll say\nhey have you been looking for jobs and\nthat's about it but he feels annoying to\nme like yes duh\nwhy is it why is it annoying it's\nbecause it's like I'm in this situation\nand you know I've been in this situation\nbecause I was calling you while I was\ngoing through it all you know that I\nfeel terrible and then I'm trying to put\na little effort at it can't I can into\nit and you're still asking me about it\nespecially right now during the Kovac\nthing it's like what jobs you want me to\nget what is there you\ngot some that like you've you got one\nI'll go find one long like sure lunch\nyou once you hand out to me it's so easy\nto go get one why don't you tell me\nwhere they are\nI've applied for so many and they've all\nrejected me and like it's not that easy\nand I don't know if it's just my head\nbut I feel like they're disappointed I\nknow my my brother he has autism and so\nwe as a family have to take care of him\nbut sometimes because of his patterns\nand things he will end up staying up and\nsuper late and waking up at like 12\no'clock in the afternoon or something\nwhich I mean I do too because I play\nvideo games really late at night but my\nparents will yell at him and be like why\nare you staying up and so late why are\nyou getting up so like that's not good\nfor you and they never say it to me but\nI could feel it directed it and you as\nwell what's it like for them to never\nsay it to you\nit's good question\nit's like passive-aggressiveness\ninnocence i guess it's not the right\nwording but sure that's maybe describing\nwhat it is it's not how you feel ya know\nit just school can i offer something\nyeah yeah there a part of you that's\nlike can you just call me a [ __ ] up and\nbe done with it\nyeah can you just call me out on my\n[ __ ] instead of asking in a polite\nmotherly loving concern how the job\nsearch is going can you just call me\nonce in your life and say why the [ __ ]\nhaven't you found a job yet what the\n[ __ ] is wrong with you mm-hmm\nhow would it feel if your mom said that\njeez the [ __ ] yes yep it would still\nfeel pretty [ __ ]\nbut anything even would also be I would\nknow what they're thinking very really\nwhy don't you know what they're thinking\ncuz they don't talk about it a whole lot\nsure it's why don't they talk about it a\nwhole lot [ __ ] if I know probably cuz\nit's hard but who is it hard for ya it's\nhard for them to talk about it\ncuz I mean I don't talk about these\nthings with them because it's hard for\nme to talk about it so it's gotta be\nhard for them to you right sure\ndo you think maybe the reason they don't\ntalk about it is because you don't talk\nabout it mean yeah so I want you to put\nyourself in their shoes for a moment\nZach your son has been in a competitive\nph.d program essentially washes out you\nsee him sleeping till noon every day you\ncan tell he's struggling and so you put\non your kid gloves and you handle him\nlike the fragile piece of porcelain he\nis right\nthey can see you're hurting they\nprobably don't want to bother you they\ndon't want to ask you hard questions\nbecause they're afraid of how they're\ngonna make you feel cuz they they love\nyou yes no yeah so what do you think\nthey're trying to do I mean how does\nsomeone who loves you respond to a\nsituation where like yours I have no\nidea how are they responding I mean\nagain just try not to mess with it too\nmuch they're so trying to make sure that\nI'm hopefully trying but they're also\nnot trying to interfere too much sure\nthey're trying to give you your space\nhmm how hard do you think they think a\nconversation about this will be for you\nvery I mean we had a conversation once\nyou told me about it while back and I\nremember one this was exactly a couple\nmonths ago but we went to there's a bar\nnearby and we went there and I knew\ngoing down like they're gonna try to\ntalk about it that's why they're calling\nyeah and yeah they I mean I remember\nwhole lot cuz I'm a super lightweight\nand so one single beer puts me out\npretty quickly but I do remember we\ntalked about that and how I was applying\nfor things what I was applying for what\nI wanted to do better at school because\nI haven't technically dropped out I'm\ngonna leave of absence mm-hmm so do I\nwant to go back and I'm like not really\nand then bringing up that they\neventually want to be empty\nEsther's and so they want to try and\nhelp me through this because they can't\nkeep me here forever\nagain like no [ __ ] [ __ ] how do you\nfeel about yourself sack yeah I felt\nlike a huge [ __ ] like how do you feel\nI head off today like I've had so much\npotential and I have drops down to this\nhuge love that that potential yeah\npotential is a bad drug [ __ ] hate it\nwhat are you hearing on it it's like\nit's these high expectations that as\nlong as you meet them everyone praises\nyou but if you don't meet them it's just\nlike faces of scorn and like everyone\nnobody talks about it like I had like\nall my friends were like oh yeah my tell\neveryone like how dare you talk back to\nthis guy he's a PhD student all's crap\nand I'm nobody even talks like this when\nI was like oh yeah you know I think I'm\ngonna drop out I was kind of it none of\nmy friends ever talked about it again\nit's like nobody wants to touch on the\nsubjects that I failed now he wants it\nlike when you have huge potential\neveryone talks about all these like\ncrazy things you're gonna do and then\nwhen you fail to meet that it's just\ndropped that's everything you do feels\nlike failure\nI stopped showing my game status on\ndiscord because I felt ashamed yeah\neverything you do feels like a failure\nfailure how do you feel Zach [ __ ] what I\nmean like again like like I'm a failure\nlike I have Arden a Hellyer yes you like\nit when I'm sitting in my parents\nbasement\nplaying video games so yeah so here's\nthe crazy thing I agree with you I think\nyou are a failure here's the difference\nbetween me and you though why am i why\nare you smiling right now no idea why am\ni smiling I also don't know okay so I\nthink why are you smiling oh I think\nyou're smiling out of defensive this\nbecause sometimes when we deal with\nnegative negative terrible things all we\ncan do is smile otherwise everything\ncomes crashing apart falling down I'm\nsmiling because I think you're an\nabsolute failure and I think that that's\nperfectly okay I think that I was a\nfailure too and failure is not the end\nof the road it's the beginning right so\nnow you can really start to live your\nlife because you can you've you have you\nhave burned down potential you've burned\ndown the idea of I will always been able\nto do things faster than everyone else\nall of that expectation and potential\nyou're actually free of it it's a burden\nand every every ounce of projected\nfailure that ounce of projected failure\ncomes from an ounce of expectation do\nyou see that like you can't fail if you\ndon't expect like you can't see that\nright so like like washing out of a ph.d\nprogram is only an issue if you were\nexpected to be there and be successful\nif you felt like you were like everyone\nelse and if you felt like you could cut\nit there because you're smarter than\neveryone and you can't start with the\nidea that you [ __ ] suck at life and\nthen like that's where like honestly\ndude that's where my life began it's\nlike where you are now like though the\nproblem is that we build this house of\ncards that is potential and it gets\nbigger and bigger and bigger but boy is\nit fragile right that's the imposter\nsyndrome it looks like a house you look\nat it from outside it's tall has lots of\nwalls and lots of rooms\npuff of wind and the thing comes [ __ ]\ncrumbling down and now like that's not I\nwish for you I don't wish for you\nbizarrely that you had succeeded because\nif you had succeeded all you would have\ndone is add another layer to the house\nof cards do you see that yeah every\nsuccess that you had has just increased\nlike you're just stacking the the house\nof cards higher and higher and higher\nand it's a [ __ ] foundation because\nit's gonna come tumbling down\nand I think you can actually begin now I\nthink failure is when you begin because\nnow you have no expectation so you sort\nof expectation still but we'll try to\ndisabuse you of those very soon I'm\nsmiling because I think that this is\nlike good for you I think like this is\ngonna change your life and ten years\nfrom now you're gonna look back on it\nand you're gonna like realize like cuz\nthat's I mean that's what I hope for you\nmaybe ten years from now you'll you'll\nbe no where you'll be sitting at home\nplaying video games and you'll have\naccomplished nothing and then that's\nkind of shitty that's possibility we\nhave to acknowledge that I don't think\nthat this is gonna be easy but I think\nthat like there's a lot of stuff here\nthat's so important and I think it has\nto start with like you accepting that\nyou are a failure like you can talk\nabout victimization as much as you want\nto and I think that that's fair because\nI think there are a lot of things that\nmake me furious about your experience\nand the experience of PhD programs in\ngeneral and at the top of the list is if\na student fails a test whose fault is it\nstudents incorrect PII absolutely right\nthere's one person in that relationship\nwho has knowledge and one person who\ndoesn't it is the responsibility of the\nteacher to help the student along the\nresponsibility of a PI's if your\nexperiment isn't [ __ ] working for a\nyear like how the [ __ ] do you expect a\nfirst year PhD student to figure out why\ntheir experiment isn't working\nlike that's the job of a PI like if your\nexperiments don't work for a year and\nyou're doing what your PI is doing why\non earth are you accepting\nresponsibility your\nyour grad student he's the guy who's\nrunning the lab like if he's telling you\nto change five variables and it doesn't\nwork out like whose fault is that I want\nto say him Vanessa feel like it's me for\nactually doing the five variable\nexperiment and not say no but yeah so so\nI understand where you're coming from\nbut this is where you have to admit that\nlike you have to acknowledge that\nthere's a power dynamic right did you\ntell your your PI that you think you\nguys should do one variable at a time\nyes and what did he say no so what are\nyou like what are your options then\ndon't have any I guess exactly so I\nthink you did what you were supposed to\ndo you raised your concerns with your PI\nand your PI is young and dumb and a\nproduct of his academic environment and\nso he decided to abuse you in the same\nway that he was abused the cycle of\nabuse continues mm-hmm that's like PhD\nprograms and academia in medicine is\nlike that\nit's like these surgeons are like all\nthese medical students cry when I call\nthem a piece of [ __ ] what the hell is\nwrong with them like it's like yeah and\nand they're like but I got called a\npiece of [ __ ] and it's like yeah but you\ndon't have to call other people a piece\nof [ __ ] you can be nicer to them just\nbecause you're abused doesn't mean that\nyou need to abuse others so I mean I do\nI think that you were victimized by your\ncircumstances absolutely but like I\ndon't think in a sense I don't think\nthat that kind of matters like it pisses\nme off and you know when I work with\nstudents I try to take the response like\nI've learned that like if they don't\nlearn that's like my fault\nright and did I really do the best job\nthat I can I mean they're not to say\nthat I'm completely responsible because\nif I like try and try and try and they\nlike go home and don't study and don't\ndo anything that I told them to do like\nthen I put the blame on them but as a\nteacher you know if you're doing what\nyour PI is telling you to do and the\nexperiments are not working out then\nit's not your fault unless you're being\nnegligent like so if you're being\nnegligent in some way and like\nhalf-assing the experiments then then it\nthen it is your fault but that's why I\nasked you did you run it the same way as\nthe previous person did your results\nturn out the same and the answer to that\nquestion is yes\nwhich means that it sounds like you did\na good job because you got the same\nresults a couple of other interesting\nthings that I'm gonna go off on a quick\ntangent but you know the other thing\nthere is that 70% of like studies are\nlike not reproducible so I think that's\na big issue [ __ ] and the last thing that\nI just want to toss your way is like do\nyou know how people win a Nobel Prize in\nscience no actually\nso they actually start with a failed\nexperiment all Nobel praat all most\nNobel Prizes at least that I've studied\nso I've studied fifteen or sixteen Nobel\nprize-winning spare experiments in in\nbiology or medicine and all of them\nstart with a failed experiment what do\nyou think about that why does someone\nget a Nobel Prize because they've made a\nhuge discovery how do you make a huge\ndiscovery what luck sure but what makes\na discovery huge what does it mean to be\na huge discovery either it has a big\nimpact on the world or on the field okay\nbut what determine a huge discovery and\nbig impact are synonymous Yeah right so\nwhat makes something a big impact\nchanges everything it changes what\nsomething not very what does it change\nwhat people thought\nabsolutely so think about this for a\nsecond\nin order to change the way that people\nthink you have to start with a failed\nexperiment and what I mean by a failed\nexperiment is the people who won Nobel\nprizes they did an experiment and their\nresults were not what they expected and\nthis is what separates 99% of scientists\nfrom 1% of scientists instead of looking\nat it as a failure they looked at it as\nan opportunity I'm expecting this result\nand in the process of figuring out why I\ndid not get the result I expected I'm\ndiscovering something huge that changes\nthe way that we\nat science do you get that like the\nbiggest travesty here is that your pee I\nlost an opportunity to win a Nobel Prize\nwhat you don't understand is that you\ndon't you don't have a year of failed\nexperiments you have a year of data that\nsuggests that something about the world\nis not the way that we have conceived\nand if you guys spent the time and\nenergy to figure out what that is that's\nhow you win a Nobel Prize why did you\nguys fail why is it that all of your\nexpectations think about this Nobel\nPrizes come when all of our expectations\nare wrong when we have a thousand\nexpectations for a particular result and\nthat result does not happen and then we\ndiscover why then it changes our\nthousand expectations before that is a\nbig impact so the crazy thing here is\nthat all you see is a failed experiment\nI don't even see failed experiments I\nsee data I see a wonderful opportunity\nto like understand something about how\nthe variables like result in like\ncompounds in a new and different way\nit's exactly why you got into a ph.d\nprogram for the first place and I think\nit's a travesty that that you are in a\nsituation call it luck or call it idiocy\nof your pie or whatever I mean I'm being\njudgemental I mean maybe the guy's\nbrilliant and compassionate and we're\njust getting a biased view it's very\npossible but like I I don't I don't\nconceive what you did is a failure at\nall I think are you a failure sure you\ncan accept that but deep down I really\ndon't think so right I think that in a\nsense you are a victim of your\ncircumstances I think you did the\nexperiments that you were supposed to do\nI think the only real mistake you made\nhere is that you've got a big ego and\nyou have unrealistic expectations yeah\nthere are a couple of other things like\nthis is the other thing is when you're\nsmart like you're gonna rise until you\nequilibria right like if I take an\nobject of a certain density and I put it\ninto a fluid of a certain density what\nis the object I'm gonna do either sink\nor float depending on the density of\nboth of them in relation to each other\nexactly so if I have a gradient of\ndensities a gradient of liquids of\ndifferent densities they're gonna\nequilibria and then if I put an object\nof different of a different density\nwhere is it going to end up\nor whichever one is equal to a sense\nexactly so welcome to academia my friend\nso we're you rise you got accepted to\nthe ph.d program because you were hot\n[ __ ] and undergrad and you're gonna\nequilibria to like where you normally\nbelong and so the higher up you go like\nthe more average you become like\neveryone thinks that such hot [ __ ] that\ndr. K is from Harvard like in Harvard I\nam subpar I'm really like no one even\nknows who I am and like I work with\npeople like you guys think I'm brilliant\nyou guys have no [ __ ] idea I'm really\nnot that smart I think I'm really one of\ny'all I don't think I'm really any\ndifferent from you guys and you guys are\nso confused by that and it's like I\ndon't think you guys have been at\nHarvard it's like you just want to see\nsmart people you should go there and and\nI mean it really I mean I met people\nthat just blew my mind with just how\nmuch knowledge they were able to absorb\nand hold in their head I was like holy\n[ __ ]\nand so the one thing to understand is\nthat the better you do the more you're\ngonna feel in a sense like a failure\nuntil you abandon this whole complex\nright because you're gonna keep rising\nand then you're not gonna be I've always\nbeen able to get things faster than\neveryone else that thought is the\nproblem like if I had to diagnose one\nthing that I could surgically remove\nfrom your brain it is a bad thought\nthere's comparison in there there's ego\nin there there's an expectation of ease\nin there right there's so many things\nthere that are just like so wrong their\npotential like that's the other thing\ngood potential is such a curse such a\ncurse it's such a burden because you\ncan't win with potential either you meet\nexpectations in which no one is\nsurprised or you're below expectations\nin which everyone is disappointed yeah\nit's like average or failure like when\nyou sign up for potential you sign up to\nbe average at best or meet expectations\nget a see a D or an F can't get an A if\nyour potential if you have very high\npotential you just can't you know maybe\nyou can win a Nobel Prize that's the\nonly thing that would be impressive to\nanyone\nyeah that's a very good way of putting\nit that I hadn't talked about before is\nit's you're signing up for average yep\nat this at best now I don't really know\nI kind of got on my soapbox so I'm gonna\njust pause for a by the way do you know\nanything about IRB applications okay I'm\nlooking for someone to do IRB stuff I\nheard yeah institutional review board so\nwe're trying to study healthy gamer so\nwe're doing like research and we're\nlooking for researchers so let's just\nkind of go back to a couple things so\nfirst of all all right so any thoughts\nor questions so far Zack nothing comes\nto mind no okay so we've got two options\none is you can tell us the rest of the\nstory because you actually haven't told\nus everything yet which I would love to\nhear if you're emotionally up for it and\nthe second question is like I think\nthere's a question of like what do we do\nright or I guess the other question that\nI would ask you is like how can I help\nyou or how can my self and twitch chat\nhow can we help you and so what do you\nthink should we tell the rest of the\nstory let's ask twitch @d can you see\nchat yeah I can pull it up okay good\nthat's good that you're raising it but\nI'm gonna tell us what is what does\ntwitch chat want to do do do we want to\nhear the story or do we want to get you\nknow figuring out how to help you what\ndoes chat say yeah yeah see this is what\nI [ __ ] hate about like I always ask\nthem for things and it's like they don't\nhelp both white people happy yeah like\nlike but like they just never they're\nnever satisfied you think having a pie\nis bad\nthese guys they're never satisfied they\nwant everything all the time more more\nMORE okay\nso let's finish the story okay and okay\ncry if you need to\nare you hoping for emotional catharsis\nby the way uh if that's what it comes to\nI guess you know because I can ask you\ncouldn't you know leading probing\nquestions about your emotions but I I'm\nnot feeling that we're gonna get there\nif that's okay with you yeah that's fine\nso tell us the rest of the story so you\nyou went home you you wrapped you slept\nyou woke up you ate dinner and then what\nhappened yeah so woke up ate dinner\nplayed video games went to beds next day\ngo back to doing research and stuff\nobviously feeling very down not able to\nget enough pretty much done getting not\ngetting any progress and I believe it\nwas either the day after or two days\nafter that when I was on the train home\nbrowsing reddit again that I came across\na thread in our league of legends about\na former pro player who had attempted\nsuicide hmm he didn't succeed but they\nhad posted a link to his blog where he\nleft his last no and I read the whole\nthing probably not a good decision if\nit's a why do you say yeah I mean of\ncourse everyone's like if you are in a\nsituation like this please don't read\nthis and after reading it I just it just\naffirmed everything why does everyone\nwhy does everyone can can you pull it up\nI have to go archive that maybe I can so\ntell me tell me why is it not a good\nidea to read that note I'm confused\num because again it's it's a person who\nwas on the verge of suicide and his\nthoughts that he was laying out and I\nrelated with a lot of it and it's sort\nof like it was a confirmation I guess I\nlook of everything that I was going\nthrough and it was like you're justified\nin thinking the way you are and other\npeople went through with it so it's okay\nto go through with it I see okay that's\nokay you don't have to find it I was\njust kind of curious so so I mean it\nsounds to me like\nyou feel like reading it would make you\nmore likely to try to hurt yourself yes\nokay okay I mean there is data that\nsuggests that suicide happens in\nclusters so maybe it is dangerous but\nand what about what you read resonated\nwith you your um\nloneliness the feeling that the world's\nis [ __ ] off and it's not there to help\nyou lots of negative babies feeling oh\nyeah feeling comfort in games and I\nwould say fantasies a whole games anime\nmovies books all that stuff other worlds\nI guess feel like you belong more of\nthose growths than you do the real world\nthat's diving more into them and being\nattached to them and he had said that he\npreferred to be a third party observer\nof things rather than be in the mix of\nthem and so that was like his motivation\nfor wanting to kill himself I didn't\nfully agree with that but like I can see\nwhere he's coming from and it's like\nthis work related to other aspects I\nguess what I did and did not resonate\nwith you about that oddly specific thing\nto remember yeah I I guess I can give an\nexample in that for some games that I\nplayed there's a big speedrun scene and\nI like to observe the meta of the\nspeedrunning and understand why they do\nit but I don't really participate so\nmuch and just be running itself what is\nbeing an observer do um you removes a\nlot of distress of the situation the\nless you do like for me it allows me to\nexperience the joy of having solved it\nquote-unquote or like solve the problem\nunderstanding something learn something\nnew\nthat any risk yeah so interesting what\ndo you think about that it's a good\nquestion I mean I don't like risk in\ngeneral I feel like it's kind of a\nnormal thing yeah for people but we're\nasking you questions that are gonna have\nvery very plain and simple answers okay\nso it doesn't have to be a complicated\nanswer yeah it's just kind of play\nbecause the questions that you ask I\nalways know that you ask things that are\nkind of out of the blue and unexpected\nand I'm hit with them like I don't know\nwhat I think good that's why you're here\nyou're not here to share with us the\nanswers that you already have Zak yeah\nyou're here to learn the things that you\ndon't know so what do you think about\nbeing an observer you say and I think\nit's it may mean it's may sound simple\nbut I think it's very good I'm glad that\nyou're laying down basic assumptions\nbecause that's important I don't like\nrisk fair so what else I do like to work\nthrough problems of things without ends\nyeah yeah with that risk I so like yeah\nI like to go like to work the problems\nof things but if I can minimize or\nremove risk then I like to do so mm-hmm\nif it's something that requires a lot of\neffort I like to give it a shot and put\nin that effort but I don't want to have\nthat ever be wasted okay so having it be\non something that's almost hobby like\ninnocence means that even if I don't\nfigure out either someone else well and\nthen I can look at their answer or it's\nlike yeah whatever I'll just go do this\nwith something else mm-hmm and it\ndoesn't feel like I wasted any time\nagain low risk are you an observer for\nyour life\nsometimes okay there are times that I\nhave that perspective where I observed\nmy own life but and what happens to you\nin those times I sort of just become\ndetached for a lot of the emotional\naspects of it do you still feel the\nemotions yeah I still feel them but not\nquite to the same degree I don't know\nhow to explain it sure we don't have\ngood words for that in English by the\nway yeah so what do you think I mean is\nit a pleasant or unpleasant experience\nto be an observer in one's life kind is\nneutral okay what is it like to not be\nan observer in one's life life is kind\nof [ __ ]\nfeels pretty bad yeah what about when\nthings are good I mean it feels good in\nthe good situations does it feel better\nto be an observer or better to feel good\nin the good situations this means\nspecifically in the good situation it\nfeels good to be in them and not\nobserving them hmm\nI think that's an experiment that you\nshould run I'd love to hear your answer\nafter you actually use your scientific\ntraining to develop a hypothesis and\nsystematically collect data so what\nwe're talking about is exactly what\nwould that talked about so when you said\nwhen I kind of asked what is it like to\nnot be an observant you were like well\nmost of life is [ __ ] so would this said\nthat we're all human being this is the\nfundamental state of life is dukkha or\nsuffering and that the way to get free\nof dukkha and suffering is to become an\nobserver then consciousness and mind are\nseparate things and that even as you\nthat emotion exists within the mind but\nconsciousness is separate of the mind\nand that's hard for us to really\nunderstand but it's kind of like what\nyou said it's hard to describe you still\nfeel the emotions\nit's just there's distance between you\nand the emotions it's like the\ndifference between being in a cage with\na lion or maybe I've just been watching\ntoo much Tiger King or or being outside\nof the cage right the lion is still\nthere and it hasn't changed but your\nposition with respect to the lion\ndrastically changes what you're able to\nappreciate or not appreciate about the\nlion does that make sense mm-hmm and and\nso I how much of an observer have you\nbeen throughout this whole saga with\nwith grad school I didn't really start\ndoing so until at some point in the\ntherapy that was one of those things\nthat they talked about was trying to not\nbe in the storm but be aware of the\nstorm being there you can't make it go\naway but look at it don't be in it in a\nsense yeah which I could only pull off a\nhandful of times at best because it's so\nhard to do absolutely right so this is\nwhy we train like we don't start\nwe don't dump people into the ocean to\nteach them how to swim right we start in\ncalm waters and that's why I like\nmeditation is normally done like we\nstart by observing our breath and we\nseparate our mind from we sort of\ndevelop a sense of consciousness outside\nof mind but something like breath that\nhas like nothing no value attached to it\nand the more valuable things become the\nharder it is to be detached mm-hmm and\nin your case it's it's hard right this\nis what I think is really unfortunate\nyou know we teach this stuff as\ntreatment and therapists do it instead\nof teaching it as a basic skill that\neveryone learns in school which is\nreally where I think it should be taught\nlike it's kind of like okay like a\ntherapist is sort of like someone who\nteaches you how to swim but people don't\nseek out therapists until they're\ndrowning in the ocean it's like kind of\nreally bass-ackwards yeah and and so\nthat's part of you mean that's part of\nwhy we do this right so I'm part of our\ngoal here is to help people understand\nsome of these skills and start to\ndevelop them and and hopefully be\nprepared for when when stuff like what\nhappens to you happen but let's kind of\ngo back\nto your story so what happened the next\nday uh I think X the next day I went to\ntherapy and I told her all about it and\nthen she was like you should go home\ntoday or well it was it was more like if\nlike I think that you should you should\ndecide for yourself but if you think\nthat you shouldn't you should go home to\nit so that was on like a Friday or\nsomething and so I took that day off I\njust emailed my PA I was like I can't do\ntoday above the blah I didn't even like\nreally read much whatever I would just\nsense it and then that day and that\nentire weekend I spent playing path of\nExile non-stop for like 18 hours a day\njust trying to not experience anything\nmathematics I was very good at that yes\nthen I had to go back to work on Monday\nI don't remember a whole lot at some\npoint in there I I just I don't wanna\nsay like forcefully but like convinced\nmy PI like I can't write this paper it's\nnot going to happen and also it was like\nI'm in a pretty [ __ ] place right now I'm\nthinking about either taking leave of\nabsence or dropping down to the master's\nprogram or something like that I've been\ntalking with the therapist about this he\nwas kind of hesitant eventually at some\npoint I had to as I brought up with her\nshe was like dude I'm gonna write you a\nletter to your PI so he understands how\nserious the situation is cuz he's not\ntaking it seriously eventually decided\nwe decided to drop downs the master's\nprogram instead of the PhD cuz I was\nalmost done with my credits and I was\nlike cool finished my credits and now\njust graduate take my degree and go do\nsomething else and then I found out that\nI had to write a thesis still and they\nwere like yeah you got like since you\nhaven't gotten anywhere in your research\nthat's like at least another six months\nbefore you down with that I can't take\nthis for six more months and then that's\nwhen I attempted weep absence and okay\nyeah\nthen moved out came back here and spent\nthree and a half months playing video\ngames and not talking about it how does\nit feel to talk about it today it's nice\nto address it it's like it's been there\nand it's been kind of eating away very\nslowly because I try not to focus on it\nbut it's been sitting there and yeah I\nmean I've been watching a lot of streams\nand trying to appear strains are trying\nto like address it myself but there's\nkind of only so far I can get stuck in\nmy own head mm-hmm\nyeah it's it's nice to address it and\ntalk about it and get it out I guess do\nyou want to move forward\nI guess define that a little bit better\ncuz\nI don't like I want to get out a feeling\n[ __ ] all the time but I also just don't\nreally have any I don't like I don't\nwant to go back to what I was\nexperiencing before of this like super\nhigh effort thing you're just so done\ngood good\nI don't think I needed to find it I\nthink you understood the nuance of my\nquestion and you gave me a very good\nanswer right so there's a presumption\nthat progress is completing your prior\ngoal mm-hmm\nbut it sounds like you don't want to you\nwant to do more than what you're doing\nright now but you don't necessarily want\nto quote-unquote succeed\nyeah she's interesting right because\nthat's not usually how we think you\nthink that if I fail a test what's my\ngoal Cass the next ones yeah there's a\npresumption that you keep going mm-hmm\nright but it's good I'm glad I think\nit's actually a huge step forward that\nyou realize that you may not want to do\nthat so now we're gonna get so how do\nyou think we can help you Zach what\nwould be helpful\num I guess how to like solve these sort\nof emotional attachments I still have\nthat because like you say I there's this\nfeeling that I have to live up to\ncertain expectations even still even\nthough like I failed and there is I\nwould hope eventually a release from\nthat I still feel attached to those\nexpectations\nsure awesome it's the burden of\npotential okay yep absolutely so I think\nsome of this is going to be propagated\nby you and some of it as an echo so\nyou've got a choice you just what was\nyour reaction they're like what we echo\nconfusion okay so so what I mean by that\nis like like so the the burden of\npotential is something that has been fed\nyou\nbeen feeding it every day growing up\nbeing the kid who's always been able to\nget things done faster than everyone\nelse every time you have that thought\nevery time you make that observation you\nfeed the act of the the sort of beast of\npotential now you failed I don't think\nthat you think very often that I've\nalways been able to do things faster\nthan everyone else right so you've\nstopped feeding that echo you start\nstopped feeding that beast of potential\nbut an echo remains it's not the\noriginal sound it's just the like you\nknow it's the after-effects or the\nshadow of that potential which is gonna\nstill be bouncing around in your head\nfor a while the main issue is whether\nyou continue to feed it or not if you\ndon't feed it it's gonna die down on its\nown like you'll start to accept that\nlike you know you should I mean\nhopefully what you'll do is start to\naccept that like you shouldn't plan your\nlife based on what you think you should\ndo or what you're capable of but you'll\nstart to devote yourself towards like\ndoing things that you care about and not\nreally like worrying about whether you\ndo a good enough job you know I think if\nyou have a love for science you should\npursue science but you shouldn't get\nbogged down and getting a PhD does that\nmean you will get a PhD yeah sure why\nnot\nbut it doesn't mean that getting a PhD\nis the goal like the PhD is just because\notherwise like it's gonna be hard to do\nscience if it's like kind of this\nrigorous rat race kind of stuff you're\ngonna like learn whatever skills you\nwant to or learn sign so then you can go\nwork in industry or you can be an\nacademic like whatever it doesn't matter\nbut like if your goal is a love for\nscience then that's what you should\npursue and don't worry about potential\nnow the interesting thing is that you're\nalso feeding another beast which is sort\nof the the beast of like lack of\nself-worth and this is the thing that\nsort of says that because I fail I am a\nbad person like there's a difference\nbetween family like it this beast is the\none that confuses failing at a task with\nbeing a failure so for you to be able to\ntake a step back and realize that like\nonce again if you didn't do well in a\nph.d program and you were\nexactly what your P I told you to do\nlike how on earth is at your fault\nmm-hmm sure if you're like a fifth year\ngrad student and you've got autonomy to\ndesign your own experiments like if\nyou're working in experimental design\nand then the the experiment doesn't work\nthat's different but it sounds like you\ndidn't do anything the experimental\ndesign you were given you were like hey\nmonkey go ahead and perform this dance\nfor me and then do it again every day\nfor ten hours a day and you were dancing\nthe way they told you to and it didn't\nwork out so I don't really think that\nthat's your fault but you don't see that\nright and this is where I think that\nthere's there's a lot here where like\nyou kept on using phrases like stressed\nout and overwhelmed but that's not\nreally those are indicators of amplitude\nthey're not like indicators of like\ndirection or quality does that make\nsense like overwhelmed is quantity it's\nnot quality so what is the quality of\nwhat you are feeling are you dealing\nwith shame probably are you dealing with\nfear are you dealing with anger right so\nshame I'm sure we can all accept like\nthat we've seen pretty clearly that you\nare a failure but are you afraid I mean\nI was I was mostly angry that like my P\nI wasn't taking anything that I was\nsaying seriously and I was like I wasn't\nin control of the situation my input and\nwhy I was taken there wasn't valued and\nI was mad about that and I was mad that\nthings were going the way they were are\nyou still mad I wasn't able to do\nanything yes how mad are you yeah\nnot like crazy super mad but like it's\nlike it frustrated like Oh stupid okay\ngood\nno so now the question becomes how mad\nare you\nand how suppress as your anger question\nI don't feel like it's that surprised I\ndon't know okay\nokay well trusty right so it's good that\nyou you noticed the question it sounds\nlike you actually did some exploration\nthere's a good for you\nare you afraid afraid of what you tell\nme see everyone thinks that I make I\nhelp people but I don't help people I\ndon't make your lives [ __ ] harm wants\nto come on in be on stream I don't think\nyou guys realize how heavy this is\nrecession this is definitely different\nthan I was expecting different being in\nthe hot seat isn't it it's it's it's\nreally different even when you're from\nthe even you're sitting there you're\nlike oh how would I react if he asked me\nthese questions like you usually come up\nwith something then you sit and seat\nyou're like dude I got nothing like yeah\nso are you afraid Zak I'm afraid that if\nI try to branch out of my comfort zone I\ncan't roll it down if I if I try to like\nI spent my whole life in science and\nengineering and chemistry and like these\nare the things that I've always been\ngood at I'm afraid that if I try to go\noutside of that that it won't and well\nI'm afraid that I mean again living up\nto expectations I'm afraid that I'll I\nwon't meet anyone's expectations or what\nI think will be good won't be good to\nanyone else and that that will affect me\nI'm afraid that I won't be able to break\nout of the cycle that I'm in right now\nyeah I'm afraid that whatever I end up\ndoing is gonna fail fairness right so\nnow let's just think about that for a\nsecond so first of all as you say those\nthings do you feel fear yes are you an\nobserver\nkind of right answer right so I think\nyou feel the fear but I think your\nacknowledgment of them so when you're\nfeeling the fear fully and it takes over\nyour mind you can't articulate it does\nthat make sense mm-hmm your capacity to\narticulate only comes with distance\nright so I asked you a question are you\nafraid and then you didn't know how to\nanswer it and then a few seconds later\nthen we talked for a moment about how\nhard it is to answer questions and then\nyou went often you gave like half a\ndozen specific fears that you have\nthat's progress that's what you're here\nfor right so now you know that these are\nthings that you carry with you right\nthese are the different debuffs and\nyou've got to think a little bit about\neach of these D buffs and how you want a\ngear in response to those Big D buffs so\nit sounds like you fought and we haven't\nreally talked about this but I'm sure\nother people have subconsciously pieced\nthis together that he's thought about a\ncareer outside of science he's thought\nabout maybe doing something else right\nand because he shared with us that he\nhas a fear that he's not going to be\nsuccessful elsewhere that's a specific\nfear so that's kind of like okay and so\nthen like if you have a like if you have\na debuff that increases your your\nvulnerability to fire you have to like\ngear up with like fire resistance gear\nright and so as you move in as you\nexplore other career options just be\naware that you're gonna feel less\nconfident than you do in science which\nis gonna be bizarre in a second because\nyou don't feel confidence in science\nanyway but that like that's an\nadditional fear that you have to account\nfor now that fear is not reality like in\ngeneral I think you're gonna be fine\noutside of science I don't think people\nhave a talent for chemistry like I think\nwhat you're good at is probably some\namount of hard work analytical\ncapability experimental design like all\nthat [ __ ] I mean you could be a\nstrategic consultant and all that stuff\nis going to apply you could go into\nfinance if you cared about it and like\nanalyze financial models like in run\nexperiments I saw a really cool video\nfrom three blue one\nyou guys should check it out about\nsimulating pandemics it's like a YouTube\nchannel that's very cool so he does like\nstatistical analyses and he just like\nsimulates like so he has one about\nsimulating pandemics and different kinds\nof interventions and stuff like that I\nthink that the things that make you good\nat science are gonna apply to a bunch of\nfields you could even go into like\nmarketing and branding if you want to\nand just be heavily metric and analytic\nfocus like that's fine I think what\nmakes you good at being you is like not\ncontent specific so I'm good at being a\npsychiatrist I'm also good at like\ncorporate consulting but my take on\ncorporate consulting is I tend to be\nlike an observer of human behavior an\nobserver of people and I try to teach\npeople about themselves so I'm a pretty\ngood teacher I'm a pretty good\npsychiatrist I'm a pretty good\nmeditation teacher and I'm also pretty\ngood consultant but it's like it that's\nbecause I don't define myself by a\nparticular profession I define myself by\nlike a particular kind of skill Sattar\ninterest and in your case I think you'll\ndo fine outside of science provided that\nyou get to do that which you really\nenjoy which is like learning about\nthings and figuring things out right so\nlike in strategic consulting for example\nyou know there'll be a company that will\ngo to like McKinsey or Bane or whatever\nand they'll say like hey we're thinking\nabout opening up a power plant in\nSoutheast Asia which country should we\nopen it in and so what they do is like\nthey just take a bunch of information\ntry to analyze it and then try to give\nsomeone a recommendation we think you\nshould open it in Thailand here are\nreasons a B C and D if you want to open\nit in Cambodia here are the things that\nare different and this is why we think\nyou should do Thailand it's done in\nCambodia\nsomething tells me is act that you would\nbe good at a lot of different stuff\nbesides science and chemistry what do\nyou think I mean yeah I can agree I do\nrent the situation of when I look at\nvarious jobs and I you know maybe yet\nmaybe I can apply my skillset to this\nthen I don't meet the stupid\nrequirements and I can't apply anyways\nbut sure\nright so I wouldn't let not meeting the\nrequirements prevent you from applying\nso not to say that you should apply for\na bunch of jobs where you don't meet the\nrequirements but if there's something\nyou're genuinely interested I think you\nshould write a good cover letter and\nsend it off\nI have master's like a master's in\nchemistry is pretty respectable like no\nmatter where you end up I think you\nshould get your masters by the way cuz\nthat's just that'll be something but\nanyway maybe not but the so the first\nthing is to understand that you have\ndifferent fears and that as you think\nabout how to move forward just\nacknowledge those fears because those\nfears are part of what's keeping you at\nhome playing runescape does that make\nsense what else is keeping you at home\nhmm\nvirus sure I was saying that there's\nprobably another fear which is that\nwhatever I do it'll end up the same way\nthat was that was one of the things\nthat's really I was conflicted with when\nI was thinking about what to do I'm did\nyou drop out or not cuz I was like I\nmean I just had like a severe depressive\nepisode and I haven't fully recovered\nwith it and if I keep going I'm worried\nthat I'll just fall right back in again\nare you still in mental health treatment\nnot right now no okay so I'd consider\ngetting back into mental health\ntreatment but I think that that too now\nyou have a some scar if you you're\nfamiliar with some scars weird the word\na thousand times nice so that everybody\nneeds so so what it is is sort of like a\nball of undigested emotion that kind of\nlingers with you and like colors your\nvision about the future you can also\nthink about it like an unprocessed\ntrauma so this entire experience has\nbeen traumatic for you and so as you\nmove forward as long as that trauma is\nthere like you know if you have if you\nget married to someone and you have an\nabusive husband or wife and they beat\nyou even after you like leave them\nyou're gonna have the fear that the next\nis gonna turn out that way and even the\nmore sicker thing about the human mind\nis you may select for those kinds of\npeople which which is sort of like\nbecause sometimes our mind prefers and\nthis is sort of this goes back to our\nconversation with your mom and your\nparents where like it would sometimes\nalmost be easier if they just called you\na [ __ ] up to your face because at least\nthat makes sense to you if they have\nfaith and hope and who you are and your\npossibility of success how does that\nmake you feel yeah it's like it's just\nwhy yeah right so like like oddly enough\nso like now this is that now we can\nunderstand why of people who have been\nabused seek out abusive partners because\nwhen someone treats them genuinely\nthey're like what the [ __ ] this is a lie\nand then someone treats them the letters\nlike [ __ ] no like ah this is a game I\nknow how to play and so bizarrely our\nmind prefers that which we know to that\nwhich is good for us and you've got to\nbe really really careful because you're\nnot a [ __ ] have you failed sure but\nlike you failed because of a combination\nof circumstance and an experience it's\nnot you aren't a failure but have you\nfailed absolutely and that's okay and so\ngoing forward you've got to be really\ncareful about that in this too I think\nyour your your answer is gonna be to\ncertain degree in observation right so\nyou have to notice that there's gonna be\na part of your mind that's gonna tell\nyou that I'm gonna fail at everything\nI've done but like by the way did you\nfinish second grade second grade yeah\nlike like elementary school sex right\nyes\nthere died succeeded at it I I got\nthrough it what about third grade yes\nfourth grade you know fifth grade where\nyou're saying like got through it and\nsucceeded right yeah\nyes okay so you have succeeded at stuff\nyou graduated from high school yes you\ngraduated from college yep but I thought\nyou were gonna fail at everything you do\ndo you like okay yeah\nwhat do you feel no tell me\nwell like its let me know if you need\nhelp yeah\nyeah I need help so those don't count\nright yeah\nis that what you're thinking like it\ndoesn't count yeah yeah it's it's it was\nstuff that happened earlier it was\neasier just it doesn't count it doesn't\ncount it doesn't count right is that how\nyou feel\nyes yeah so let's just think about that\nfor a second your mind is coming up with\nall kinds of reasons why it doesn't\ncount as [ __ ] second grade who fails\nsecond grade sometimes people do it\ndoesn't count so just now see what kind\nof look at what rigged ass game your\nbrain is playing with you it's funny cuz\nyou say that and like yeah my brains\nrigged my princess ring you're talking\nabout like so tell me how is the game\nranked very good now you're growing what\nam I saying\nI'm saying the game's rigged I I'm\ntaking one single event and I fixating\non it ends yeah and what are you doing\nto all of the other data points ignoring\nthem absolutely right I'm gonna run an\nexperiment Zack and I'm going to say\nthat feeding a plant with beer is better\nthan feeding it with water and I'm gonna\ntake a dozen plants and I'm gonna give\nhim 11 of them water and I'm gonna give\none up a beer\nand after two months I have 11 healthy\nplants and I have one kind of stunted\nplant and what I'm essentially doing is\ntaking my 11 doh the healthy plants I'm\nsaying [ __ ] this I'm gonna dump him in\nthe trash and there's my beer plant see\nI was right all along\nit's the only one that's growing the\ngame is rigged because your\ndiscarding data all the time this is\nwhat how a cognitive bias works and this\nall comes from your emotion because\nthat's like it's irrational so it's\ncoming from your emotion fine you can't\nconvince it otherwise and when I pointed\nout to you rationally even your rational\nmind is like yeah the game is rigged but\nthen the other part of you that's what\ndoes that part saying that parts is like\nof course it's not rigged this is like\neverything else doesn't count this is\nyou know this is what happens this sucks\nand this is the way it is yeah right so\njust see that about yourself right and\nlet's like laugh at it that's kind of\n[ __ ] up yeah yeah right but that's\nthat's how it is so when we have our\nemotions aren't rational so we can't\nexpect them to be rational understand\nthat there's a part of yourself that is\nhurt and there's a part of yourself that\nhas lost confidence now the real\nchallenge is is in your struggle with\nthat part I wouldn't say you should try\nto fight it or overcome it\nbecause that doesn't really work too\nwell what I'd say is you should take it\nwith you just take it with you right\nlike every everything that you do take\nthis failure with you and say there's a\ndecent chance like this part of me is\nsaying like there's a logical part of my\nmind that says that actually I'm not\nreally a family or in this part of is\nlike no [ __ ] you you are a failure\nnothing you could do is right and then\nyou're like okay treat it like a you\nknow like a eccentric uncle who comes to\nall of your family gatherings and you\ncan't get rid of him like eleven people\nare dressed normally and he's wearing\nyou know underwear over his pants\nbecause he feels like he's a superhero\nand like he's just gonna be who he's\ngonna be like the part of you that feels\nthat you're a failure is gonna feel like\nit's a failure and it's gonna take time\nfor you to comfort and reassure that\npart and for him to kind of calm down\nit's like a dog that has gotten like\nriled up and is afraid that like\nsomeone's in his intruder you just have\nto smell you can't take the dog out the\ndog is gonna be with you your failure is\ngonna be with you so carry it with you\nlet it be with you and then also don't\nlet it control you\ndoes that make sense yeah easier said\nthan done but absolutely so how do we\nmake it easier to do\nwhat do you think yeah I got nothing so\ndad I'm trying to come up with so I\nthink this is where as you deal with\neach of the deep as we identify things\nthey become easier to deal with that's\nnumber one so if you're saying I'm\nstressed and I'm overwhelmed you can't\ndo anything with that people don't just\nwake up one day and say I'm on\noverwhelmed now done right so if we\nthink about like you know something like\ntherapy what happens is we help people\nidentify the reasons that they're\noverwhelmed and then it's like we've\nI've used this analogy before it's like\ndetection in a game right like you have\ninvisible things that are attacking you\nand that's overwhelmed because remember\nit's not like quality you don't know\nwhat it is all you know is you're taking\na shitload of damage every round like I\ncan't see it I don't know I'm\noverwhelmed but just the dps is through\nthe roof\nand then once you identify it then you\ncan start to actually like do something\nlike oh there's like this like mob\nthat's here that's attacking me let me\nlike move over this way and then like\nits effect on you lesson so\nidentification is the first thing\nnoticing is the second thing and this is\nwhere we come back to the observer so\nthe more that you can act from the\nobserver the less powerful all of this\nstuff becomes and so this is where if\nyou can develop a meditative practice go\nfor it I think you should consider\ngetting back into mental health\ntreatment if it's an option that'll help\nyou for it\nthen also give yourself some time I\nthink three three months of playing like\nrunescape is not that bad\nI mean not to say that you know it's\ngood or that it's unacceptable I'm sure\nthere are people who have been playing\ngroup scared for seven years and I'm an\naccomplished anything and you know\ncomparison and stuff is bad but I'm just\nsaying like give yourself some time and\ncut yourself some slack\nit's April kovat is going on anyway like\nyou're not gonna finish your semester\nI'd say take some time to take care of\nyourself and work work on yourself like\nyour goal is to like repair damage\nbetween now and the fall of next year if\nyou need to apply for something consider\napplying for something but basically\ntake care of yourself get get rid of the\ndepression you know or handle that try\nto grow the observer try to notice your\nfears and then try to you know get get\nyourself ready by like August if you\nwant to I mean I'm tempted that I'm\nactually tempted to start writing\nletters to people\nis a psychiatrist to let them just play\nvideo games for like a month\nat home like just give them just like a\nyou know burn out Eve thoughts questions\n[Music]\nyes I mean I'm still feeling like I\ndon't want to go back it's fine\nso I'm sort of in a state of like okay\nwhat do I do about that I got you so you\ndon't do anything about that right now\nokay right so you don't have to make\nthat decision today and you don't even\nhave to make it a month from now like\nyou make it and if it's too late and you\nmissed the deadline then you miss the\ndeadline whatever what I'm saying is\nthat like you're it's gonna be really\nhard for you to make so like do you\nacknowledge that your mind is irrational\nright now so do you want to be making\ndecisions with this mind no there you go\nthat's why I'm saying like for a couple\nmonths just focus on yourself and like\ntry to heal and try to get into a better\nplace and then though the answers about\nwhat you do with your career and stuff\nlike that like this is the big problem\nif you plan like they say like okay\nshould I go back to school should I\nswitch careers like to forget all of\nthat that's all that sheet isn't\nunimportant actually right now the\nimportant thing is that your instrument\nis miscalibrated you're a scientist and\nif you don't like tear your scale at the\nbeginning like how are all of your\nexperiments gonna be pretty [ __ ] exactly\nit's the first thing that you should do\nis just tear your scale right tear is ta\nre by the way it's calibrate so you've\ngot a calibrate first and then we don't\nthink about it this way we don't give\nourselves time to heal we don't give\nourselves we just say like oh I'm a\nfailure like yeah so like deal with your\nemotional you know\naftermath first and give yourself some\ntime to heal play some ruse or enscape\nman go for it you know but like don't\njust do runescape for 18 hours a day\nlike find a therapist spend some time\nmeditating you know it sounds like you\nwatch the marked streams and stuff so\ncontinue doing that I'd consider reading\nin your case meditations by Mark\nsir alias have you ever rabbit do you\nlike to read yes so read meditations by\nMarcus Aurelius right there it's like a\n99 cent thing you can get on Amazon I\nlike to read hard copies of stuff it's\nfree because it was written like five\nthousand years ago or something or like\na thousand or two thousand years ago so\nit's in the public domain but you know\nread a little bit and learn a little bit\nand grow a little bit and give yourself\ntime to like heal from the damage and\nunderstand that your instrument is not\ncalibrated or healthy right now so any\nof the decisions this is where people\nlike this is the problem as they get\ninto this self-fulfilling prophecy if\nyou you try to move forward and you [ __ ]\nit up because you're just not ready to\nmove you've got two broken legs and you\ntry to get up and you fall down again\nand then it reinforces the idea that\nyou're a failure and then you try to get\nup again and then you still fall down\nbecause your legs are broken and then\nyou try again and you try again and the\nmore you try the more it becomes true\nthat you were a failure and then you\nwind up stuck because at this point\ninstead of one incident you have a dozen\ninstruments in you have a dozen data\npoints and then your mind which believes\nthat wants to discard good data now now\nit's it's one thing for you to be able\nto see okay I have 12 years of successes\nin one year of failure but once you have\n12 years of successes in 12 years for\nfailure of failure that becomes a way\nharder battle to win even rationally so\ngive yourself time to heal first because\notherwise you're gonna convince yourself\nand you're gonna be true you're gonna be\nright that you are a failure thoughts\nquestions before we wrap up that make\nsense yeah that makes perfect sense I'm\nsorry I couldn't transform your life but\nthat doesn't really happen yeah it makes\nsense okay well good luck man yeah thank\nyou you have any assistly any clothes I\ndon't mean to end things abruptly but\nthat's sort of my schpeel no I mean we\ntouched on everything that I want to\ntouch on since yeah it was it's helpful\nit's all let's meditate actually\noh yeah yeah so sorry go ahead it's the\nthings we do here isn't it\nyeah it's it's good to talk about it\nagain and yeah last thing last concrete\nthing that you should do is have a\nconversation with your parents that's\ngonna be emotionally hard right but you\nneed to ask them I would ask them\nbecause I think the reason you don't\nhave the conversation is because you're\nafraid of what they're gonna say there's\na part of you that knows that until you\ntalk to even though you believe that\nthey think you're a piece of [ __ ]\nthere's a part of you that's holding on\nto hope that they're gonna say something\nhopeful and there's a part of you that\nit's I don't know how else to describe\nthis but it's so hard to hear their\npositivity towards you right now that's\nyeah that's almost exactly I was gonna\nsay is like there's the part that does\nit wants to hear though yeah but you've\ngot to do that right so like it can be a\nsimple conversation I wouldn't have a\ndrink while you're doing it but you can\njust say you know what do you guys what\ndo you guys think about this last year\nI'd love to get your thoughts and then\nyou can share with them like this is how\nthe suit last year is gone for me and\nthen they're gonna always look forward\ndon't worry about looking forward or\nhave you found a job are you applying\nfor a job just to ask them like what\nthey think about your situation\nyou'll be surprised if you can get the\nball rolling it's gonna like the\nconversations gonna go on its own\ngetting it started is really the hardest\npart but and that too is like it's hard\nto do so you just think about that a\nlittle bit but I think right now you're\nyou're trying to make decisions and move\nforward when you've got all this [ __ ]\nlike you're encumbered so you've got on\nburden all that and then becomes way\neasier you'll be back to where you are\nas a key\nokay okay your meditation let's think\nhave you seen triphasic breathing yeah\nokay so let's do that\nso I'm gonna teach you how to breathe so\nI want you to sit up straight okay and\n[Music]\nokay so I want you to first observe the\nbreath in your chest and now I want you\nto focus on your stomach\nand as you breathe in I want you to push\nyour stomach out like expand your\nstomach and suck the air down into your\nabdomen and notice that as you breathe\nout huh sorry I have a focus being\nstupid in my head Oh be stupid in your\nhead go for him\nlet the focus go and then as you breathe\nout notice that your stomach contracts\npulls in\nso you can just focus on the sensation\nof belly moving out and belly moving in\nor you can visualize your belly button\nor navel moving away from your spine\nduring inhalation and then pulling\ntowards your spine during exhalation\nyou can really push it all the way out\nkind of drastically pull it all the way\nand like suck in your spine to where you\ncan sort of where people would be able\nto see your rib cages\nand now what I want you to do is as you\nbelly breathe try to keep your chest\nsomewhat still so there may be an\ninclination to expand everything when\nyou breathe it breathe in belly in chest\ntry to focus the expansion on your belly\nduring inhalation and exhalation let\nyour chest remain still\nso this is the first phase of breathing\nfocusing on the abdomen\nand now we're gonna add the second phase\nas you breathe in and with a full belly\nof air then I want you to forcibly\nexpand your chest or sort of\nintentionally expand your chest\nafterward and breathe in just a little\nbit more so phase one is abdomen and\nphase two breathe in with a full chest\nof air and then out abdominal breathing\nchest breathing and out\nabdomen chest and out\nand do one more breath\nand now we'll add phase three so abdomen\nchest and then raise your shoulders a\nlittle bit spike up your shoulders raise\nyour clavicles and breathe just a little\nbit more and then out it's not going to\nbe very much in that last phase just\nfive percent in with the belly in with\nthe chest and then up with the shoulders\nand out\nin with the belly expand the chest raise\nthe shoulders and out now do three\nbreaths just like that\nlet them flow together let your breath\nbe slow\nif you begin to feel dizziness or\nlightheaded let your breath pause after\nthe exhalation just sit and then as your\nrespiratory drive awakens breathe again\npractice for about another minute\nnow go ahead and finish the breath that\nyou're on let your eyes remain closed\njust feel the person that you are\nyou may have a feeling of failure you\nmay have fear anger shame you notice\nthat those are just pieces of you\neither underneath that all or even\nencompassing all those feelings is the\nreal you that all of the fluctuations of\nthe mind and the self happen within the\nspace of you\nand now sort of feel the outline of your\nphysical form feel your head your\nshoulders your arms almost like a\ntracing\nand notice that the fear and the shame\nand the anger the failure they exist\nsomewhere within your belly somewhat\nwithin your chest somewhere within your\nthroat possibly your head but they\nmostly live in the torso or the abdomen\nand now notice for a moment that that is\nnot the whole you that you have arms you\nhave shoulders you have feet you have\nlegs there's no fear or shame there\nthere's no anger or failure\nbut you were not those things\nand sit with that sensation\nin the world may victimize you may take\nadvantage of you circumstances could\nchange your job applications could be\nrejected you may have a grade on your\ntranscript\nbut that none of those things can take\nyou away from this all those things may\nbe true but they are not this and that\nthis is your birthright to be in this\nplace and that this is who you are and\nyou carry this person with you all the\ntime\nit's not about finding it's about\nreturning\nnow I'll let yourself come back\nit's April 1st\nworld is falling apart and how do you\nfeel today Zach do anything that day\nlooks kind of chill good kind of chill\ndo you feel like playing runescape oh\nyeah I noticed that too right notice\nthat desire that impulse\ndon't become attached to it quite yet\nbut notice it's there do not just the\nnegativity anyway any thoughts or\nquestions for you wrap up for the day\nman\nno awesome dude I feel better now listen\nman good luck\nI really wish you all the best take care\nof man thank you\nalrighty\noh there we go we forgot to ask him\nabout his um yeah go ahead play\nrunescape\nwe're gonna have to wrap up so we're at\nour time for today I know people are\nasking questions and stuff ah how do you\nget rid of the potential version so\nthat's why I like that's a whole like\nthat's a whole hour about how to deal\nwith potential and how to understand so\nhow do you deal with major life setbacks\nI think so let's let's answer that\nquestion okay so how do you deal with\nmajor life setbacks so you recognize\nthat it's a setback you recognize it's a\nfailure that's okay it's not the end of\nthe world that you survive failure and\nyou also notice the damage of the\nfailure so you've got to figure out like\nwhere did you take damage and whether\nthey be emotions whether they be you\nknow the house of cards coming down\nsenses of failure being able to unable\nto move forward you start by identifying\nall of the ways in which you've taken\ndamage and then you recognize that like\nall of those problems that you face or\nall that damage that you've taken is\ngonna make it so that your mind does not\nfunction properly and so then you like\neven if you try to move forward this is\nthe hard thing is that people who face\nsetbacks they try so hard to rebuild\ntheir lives that like you guys know this\nright you guys actually try really hard\nyou struggle very very hard to like not\nplays runescape it's not that you're not\ntrying it's just that you're not\nsucceeding and you don't no one sees the\neffort but you feel the effort like in\nmoments you feel the effort so intensely\nso intensely and so the problem is not\none of lack of trying it's not that you\nguys are actually lazy it's just that\nyou guys are using an instrument that\nlike is not functioning properly so the\nway to deal with a setback is not like\npositive thinking you can do it buddy\nknow it's to recognize okay what what\nwithin me is broken\nwhat within me is busted what have I\nlearned from this experience like am I\nscared of ever trying so be it recognize\nthat see that be like okay how do I deal\nwith that like let me just see that\nthing and let me carry it with me when\nyou go to the job applicant for a job\ninterview for example and you feel like\nyou're not gonna get it\nyou don't like suppress that part you\ndon't say\nlike Oh like there's no use in going\nbecause if you suppress it that's what\nhappens it actually takes control it\ntakes control through suppression it\nexerts its influence in the subconscious\nand then prevents you from acting so you\ngot to bring it to the conscious notice\nit and then like say [ __ ] you to it\nright you say okay\nfine you don't say you can say you say\nokay you're a dog that has been really\nreally frustrated with my whole\nsituation fine you think we're gonna be\na failure maybe you're right maybe\nyou're wrong I'm gonna let you be where\nyou are and I'm gonna go ahead and go to\nthe job interview anyway and I'm gonna\ndo the best job that I can do it let it\nbe with you accept it and move forward\ndon't let it control you and you say\nlike oh just don't let it control me\nlike how do you not let it control you\nyou let it not control you by accepting\nit because so far you haven't accepted\nit and it controls you all the time\nacceptance leads to freedom so\nAlcoholics Anonymous is the most is the\nbest evidence-based treatment to get rid\nof alcoholism there's a great\nmeta-analysis about this recently I\nthink from the Cochrane Collaboration\nin the first law I mean I don't agree\nwith everything around Alcoholics\nAnonymous I think I don't really I do a\ndifferent kind of thing and I tend to be\npretty effective but their first thing\nis that they acknowledge that they're\npowerless in the face of alcohol it's\nlike how on earth does that work like\neven if you don't agree with Alcoholics\nAnonymous or you think there are\ndifferent ways to do it\ntheir first step is to acknowledge that\nthey're powerless in this in the face of\nthis so they cede control and thereby\nget success she's really weird but\nthere's like actually scientific data\nthat suggests that that psychological\nprinciple which by the way is what would\nthough has been teaching or taught a\ncouple thousand years ago but this\nstarted teaching it a couple thousand\nyears ago even before but the so like\nwhat those teachers were essentially\nYogi's right so if you call that\nHinduism or not that's up to you I think\nHinduism is sort of a Western construct\nbut people have been saying that like in\nIndia and China for thousands of years\nand along comes\nand even Christianity says that an a a\nsort of encapsulate that concept and\nthen people take like this\nneurobiological addiction to alcohol and\nthere's somehow a are able to overcome\nit through that concept so acceptance of\nthe thing actually leads to liberation\noutcome absolutely"
