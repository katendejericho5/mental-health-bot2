up let's do our\nlast round so before we do our last\nround I'm going to tell you guys now why\nwe do yoga okay\nthe purpose of yoga is to bring your\nattention to the present so that you\ncan't think about anything else\nit is the preparatory step for\nmeditation right so what we do is we use\nour body is an anchor to keep us from\nthinking distracting thoughts and our\nbody is a really powerful anchor\nespecially when you do all these poses\nand so now for this next round what I\nreally want you guys to focus on is\nadopt as much or as little of the\nposture as you can with the goal not\nbeing how far do you stretch or how far\nyou reach or how straight your back is\nthe goal should be to adopt a particular\nphysical posture your judge of whether\nyou're doing yoga correctly should not\ncome from anything that anyone can see\nwhether you're doing go over correctly\ncomes entirely from here what is your\nmind doing can you keep the posture\nstable but with attention in the present\nor not so you want it to be stable but\nwe want it to be demanding enough to\nwhere your mind is focusing on keeping\nthat posture how it is if you become too\ncomfortable than the mind begins to\nwander if it becomes too difficult then\nyou cannot maintain it for a long time\nyou guys see that the goal is to\nmaintain your mind in the present\nfor as long as possible that's why we do\nyoga okay so now put your feet together\nand we're going to begin again so eyes\nclosed or open if you need stability and\njust feel your body feel it in this\npresent moment feel your palms feel your\nelbows feel your chest your shoulders\nyour knees you can anchor in on the the\ninstability if you want to and now arms\nup now feel how your back is different\nin this position feel the stretch in the\npole kind of beneath your shoulder\nblades in between your shoulder blades\nin your spine and reach up even further\nsee what it does to your body is used is\nyou become ramrod straight see how your\nbreath is constructed and now down now\nonce again feel what your body's tells\nyou tightness in the neck take this in\nthe back with each breath sink deeper\nlook\nnow we're going to go forward right leg\nforward left leg back arms by your sides\nlook up and feel feel your hips feel the\nrelaxation in your back as you slightly\ncurved feel the difference between your\nright palm and your left palm your right\narm and your left arm is one of them is\nbeing pushed up a little bit feel the\nstretch and your right arm is you strain\nto put it into the ground and now right\nleg back push-up position feel the\ninstability begin to come on try to keep\nyour back but then feet straight note\nwhat's in the air you want to be\nstraight and then relax number\nand notice that even though one relaxed\nnow there may not be a whole lot of\nphysical strain your body is still\nsending you signals in the present\nrelaxation can be a signal as well\nmy feet flat on the ground\nso this pointed behind you push up hips\non the ground shoulders rolled out look\nup feel that stretch in your back feel\nthe tightness as we hold a position\nnotice the burning is it begins in your\narms so your body is sending you signals\nnow and then downward-facing dog with\nawesome feet flat on the ground now\nhe'll let your head hang and see how\nthat feels\nand now left leg forward look up\nyou know on the way up then scoot back a\nlittle bit you see in it getting it down\nthen up bombs together ends all the way\nup now relax in this position to then\ncome back now we're going to go into\nshove awesome so go ahead in lay down on\nyour back palms by your sides feet out\nto each side\nnotice your breathing\nslow and deep of its encore\nnow let yourself come back\nyou're I suppose go ahead and set out\njust take a moment\nsee the black space in front of your\neyes as your eyes are closed we're going\nto go ahead and just roll straight into\nmeditation so today we'll be doing a\nthird eye meditation\nyou want to grab a Christian or to try\nto sit in a way that's comfortable\nremember that if you elevate your butt\nthat it'll be easier to sit up straight\nso keep your back straight we're going\nto do charging the laser beam so take\nyour middle finger you place it about\nhalf maybe about a half an inch or a\nquarter inch away from the center of\nyour forehead between your eyebrows\ndon't touch keep your eyes closed\nmove it as close as you can without\ntouching even though you aren't touching\nyou should be able to feel the fingers\njust concentrate on the sensation that's\ncreated in your forehead or possibly\nbetween your forehead and your finger\ngo ahead and relax and continue to focus\non that point of your forehead\nnot begin again put the finger back\nno wax\nfocus on that point in your forehead put\nall of your energy all of your intention\nand all of your attention into that\npoint and push into it with your\nconcentration\nnow third time bring the middle finger\nback the point between your eyebrows\ndon't touch\nbringing down\nso concentrate now relax take a deep\nbreath in and out in and out last one\nvery slow in doubt\nlet's put your palms together in front\nof you and express gratitude towards\nyourself towards the universe that you\nare alive you are here you may be facing\nstruggles the world may be falling apart\nbut that you exist and you are capable\nyou can't move mountains can't even move\nyourself you can be this person then you\nwill do what needs to be done rub your\npalms together in front of you feel the\nheat in the friction drop them over your\neyes with one last inflation and\nexhalation open your eyes and letting\nthe palms come down alright okay alright\nwhat do you guys okay let's take a quick\npoll there's my take a three minute\nbreak\nwhat do y'all think\nokay looks like most people don't want\nto take a break but there are enough\npeople that do so why don't we take a\nthree-minute plate break because there\nare not people like people may need to\nuse the bathroom I think it's perfectly\nfine guys so let's not be impatient\nlet's take a quick break I'm gonna need\na minute to set up reflector and get\nsome water and stuff like that anyway so\nwhy don't we take a break let's be\npatient let's take a moment for a mind\nto go ahead and recalibrate will start\nat in about three minutes okay and then\nwe'll be prepared notice how you feel\nnow and you'll be properly prepared to\nlearn when we get back okay\nyou gotta be carrying\nthere we go\nsaid the fact\nthis is black you gotta be kidding me\nwhat is wrong with this thing this is\nwhat I get from trying to you know make\nsure everything works ahead of time\nokay saved okay I swear guys it's like\nlook I do the same damn thing every\nsingle time and it's just it's finicky\nI'm telling you guys it's not it's not\nmy fault okay let's see if we can um so\nlet's get started okay so today\nhopefully everyone's back we're gonna\ntalk about meditation okay so let's\nstart by talking about meditation it's\nworking box so this is going to be a\nlittle bit of a more slightly more\nacademic lecture okay so a lot of people\nwonder like what kind of meditation\nactually let me go shut the door\nokay I'm pretty sure that their pancakes\nbeing made downstairs and they smell\ndelicious okay\nso a lot of people are wondering what\nkind of meditation should they do and\nlike even what is meditation because\npeople don't really know so we're going\nto start with a little bit of history of\nmeditation so the first kind of\nmeditation was actually developed by\nconvicts\nokay so thumper is a discipline it's\nprobably 5,000 years old but there is a\nform of mysticism and tends to have\nthree parts\nJahna mantra and young fit-up okay\nand so yagna is like a ritual so this is\nlike casting Emma\nritual mantra is like a phrase that\naccumulates energy and this is like a\ngeometric energy accumulator\nso the first thing to understand about\nPanthro\nis that thun thourough is is about the\naccumulation of energy so in a sense the\nfocus is on sort of the interaction\nbetween south and the outside so it's\nlike self outside and contradicts\nbelieve that basically you can do these\nthree things to accumulate particular\nkinds of energy to exert an influence on\nthe outside world so goal of eases\ninfluence the outside world actually not\nnecessarily the outside world but to get\na sort of a tangible benefit so there\nare mantras for example that you know\nlike there are certain kinds of like\nmonth rows and fasts that Hindus do to\nlike get good husbands for example or\ntheir mantras to gain health or mantras\nfor prosperity or things like that so\nlike bunker is like basically it's like\nit's almost like a system of magic okay\nand there are fine thick meditations and\nthe founder of meditations are sort of\ngeared towards\nokay they're geared towards some sort of\naccumulating particular energies to get\nparticular ends and so over here we're\ngoing to have Kundalini Yoga so we'll\ntalk about when doing is in a second and\nso over time the tantrics actually\ndeveloped yoga and yoga is sort of a\nsystem to reach enlightenment okay and\nand so let's just think about this for a\nsecond so yoga the the root word of yoga\nis huge and huge means union or yoke and\nwhat that means is that like yoga is\nessentially like there's this concept in\nEastern religions that our consciousness\nis part of a bigger consciousness called\nbrahman and so then basically the unit\nof existence is consciousness there's\nthis whole sea of consciousness and we\nbecome a drop out of that like we take a\ndrop out of that ocean and we embody it\nwithin a physical form and that's you so\nthere's a part of you that's the\nphysical form but your true essence is\nthis like like tiny bit of consciousness\nso this is the idea that you know\nenlightenment it people call it\nrealization or enlightenment it's not\nlearning it's not discovering something\nnew it's actually remembering something\nold right realization is a new\nperspective on something that you\nalready know it's not gaining new\nknowledge so the process of\nenlightenment is this stepwise process\nto become aware that you are actually\ndivine and eternal and all this other\nlike wonderful beautiful stuff okay but\nthe main thing here is that what yoga is\nreally for is is it's to help us become\none with this thing called the infinite\nor brahmand it's kind of hard to\ndescribe because you have to experience\nfor a month to really understand what it\nis it's kind of like I want you guys to\nimagine this for a second so imagine\nthat you've never been in a body of\nwater\nso you've seen water you've drank water\nbut you've never like been under water\nit's very very difficult to describe to\nsomeone what the experience of moving in\nwater or being underwater is like it's\nlike you can say like yeah you can\nyou're moving but it's like you're\nmoving slowly right like how would you\nhow would someone who has never been\nunderwater like know what slow movement\nfeels like you know you could use a word\nsluggish but like sluggish is not you\nknow doesn't accurate descriptor stand\nBrahman and what that means you really\nhave to experience it so yoga is the\nprocess so the fabrics basically were\nlike okay like there's this they develop\nthis process of yoga and yoga is the\nprocess of becoming one with the divine\nor whatever realization enlightenment\nall all the same thing the other\ninteresting thing about yoga is that it\ninvolves the word yoke so that's kind of\nlike Sanskrit has these dual meanings so\nthe other thing about yoga is that yoga\nalso means freedom so yoga is that which\nfrees you from the thing that binds you\nto life and also that which joins you to\nthe infinite okay so it's kind of weird\nso it's like sort of freedom and\nliberation and like that which is bound\nthrough the process of becoming unbound\nand then in yoga\nthere are we'll get to Kundalini in a\nsecond so in yoga there are four kinds\nof yoga\nso there's karma yoga bhakti yoga\njnana-yoga and Garagiola okay and these\nare paths to enlightenment so what does\nthis mean this means that this process\nof liberation can be attained through\nbasically four four ways so this is the\npath of action so this is the idea that\nif you want to like get to God or become\nenlightened you can just do it through\nactions you can just a queue you can\njust be a good person and do good things\nyou don't have to do yoga you don't have\nto meditate you don't have to worship\nsomeone you can just basically be like a\nsecular atheistic good person and if you\ndevote yourself to actions and kind of\nlike doing a good job you can become\nenlightened\nokay so gotta my Yogi's tend to be like\nactivists like a lot of them are sort of\ncuddler Yogi's so like MLK or Mahatma\nGandhi Gandhi or like good examples of\nkarma Yogi's party Yoga is the path of\ndevotion so the best way to understand\nthis is essentially like religion but\nnot necessarily okay it includes\nreligion but isn't necessary exclusive\nreligion so any religion that we think\nof where we sort of a religion as a set\nof beliefs that if you follow it you'll\nkind of be you know you'll go to heaven\nor whatever like that stuff is\nessentially devotion right so if you're\nif you look at the judeo-christian\nreligion like you devote yourself to the\nideals and teachings of a particular God\nso it can be like Jesus or the Father or\nYahweh or a lot like it can in the\nEastern religions it's like Krishna or\nROM or whoever or Shiva or whatever that\nessentially like devoting yourself to a\nparticular God or ideal is like a way to\nbecome divine the the other interesting\nthing that the Yogi's actually say is\nthat it is not the object of devotion\nthat matters right so like they actually\nsay so there's like person there's\ndevotion\nand then there's object so a lot of\ntimes like religious conflict is kind of\ncentered on the idea that like my god is\nbetter than your God right they say that\nlike okay so like when Hindus and\nMuslims fight like a lot of it has to do\nwith like there's like religious\nconflict going Jews and Muslims fight\nthere's like villages conflict there's\nthis idea of conversion or like my God\nis better than your God but like what\nthe Yogi's actually noticed is that like\ngods change over time they're like all\nthese tons of gods tons of religion it\nactually doesn't make sense that any\nparticular God is like better than any\nother God so there's like Zeus and then\nthere's also like Hades and then there's\nJesus and there's I'm sure a lot of\npeople will find this offensive I'm just\nmaking statements and there's Krishna\nthere are all kinds of gods that have\nexisted in the history of humanity and\nwhat the Yogi's observed and you guys\nare completely inclined to agree or\ndisagree right so remember that the\npurpose of me teaching is to give you\nguys testable hypotheses not knowledge\nwhat the Yogi's observed is that it's at\nthe act of devotion to your particular\nGod that is the important thing and what\nI mean by that is that like they\nbasically looked at religious people or\nthey looked at religions and they said\nsome people who practice religion are\n and some people who practice\nour religion are good therefore it is\nnot the religion itself that makes\nsomeone good or bad it is like the\ndegree to which you devote yourself to\nthe ideal right so they kind of said\nlike it doesn't matter whether you\nworship Zeus or Kali or Jesus or\nwhatever the act of devotion is the\nimportant thing the other interesting\nthing about huffy yoga is it doesn't\nnecessarily include religion it doesn't\ninclude only religion so you can devote\nyourself to a particular idea like\nclimate change right so you can say that\nI'm gonna like if you put your heart and\nsoul and effort in mind behind like a\nparticular ideal and you devote yourself\nto that you will become spiritually\npurified in that process so that's where\nlike karma yoga and puck do kind of\noverlap some but ultimately it's the\nidea that you kind of set a target that\nyou say this thing is more important\nthan I am and that I'm going to become\nan instrument\nof like achieving this thing and that\ninstrument can be God if you're like\nlet's say you're a priest right so\nyou're like okay I'm going to become\nlike an instrument to be like God's will\nor you can be an instrument of climate\nchange or you can be an instrument of\nlike whatever it doesn't matter the I\nthe main ideas that you devote yourself\nto something and in that process so then\npeople may ask like okay can you devote\nyourself to killing other people or\nthings like that the interesting thing\nis that you know there are good things\nthat you can devote yourself to or bad\nthings that you can devote yourself to\nin a sense yes like you can it the\nobject of your devotion doesn't matter\nthe manner of your devotion matters so\nhow you become devoted is very important\nso I know that there are a lot of people\nout there who seem to be for a cause but\nthey're like spiritually bereft right\nthey're like they're not they don't\nactually whatever they devote themselves\nto does not result in then then becoming\nlike humble or knowledgeable or like\nspiritually like grown like less ego\nlike those kinds of things don't work so\nI don't think that that's appropriate\ndevotion is the way in which you devote\nyourself that's actually important not\nwhat you devote yourself to okay so\nthat's devotion okay\nJonnie yoga's the path of knowledge or\ncontemplation and I used to think that I\nwas in jnana yogi but it turns out that\nI'm not or I'm on the path of jnana yoga\nso the path of knowledge apparently is\nvery very hard and very few people do it\nand it's hard to learn it's essentially\ncontemplation so it's like kind of like\nthinking your way to enlightenment so\nit's not quite not logic but it's really\ncontemplation and like logic can come\nout of contemplation but like logic\ncannot make you reflective right so you\ncan like just because you learn\nsomething logically doesn't mean that\nyou change but there's there's a\ndifferent process between reflecting and\nlogic the two may seem related but this\ndoesn't lead to change\nthis does so all I mean by this is that\nif you look at your thought process\nyou'll notice that thinking about\nsomething there like different ways in\nwhich you can think about something and\nsome of the ways in which you think\nabout stuff will like cause you to\nchange and learn something and other\nways like don't cause you to learn and\nchange something and and so Jana yoga's\nsort of the process of like figuring\nteasing that apart and essentially doing\na lot in a lot of reflection about the\nnature of the universe the nature of\nyourself the nature of God and then you\ncan kind of become enlightened\nso the path that I follow is around you\nyou're okay\nin Rajee oh it has eight steps okay so\nstep number one is young on step number\ntwo is neat on them okay so these are\nobservances personal society\nso Yama and niyama or like codes of\nconduct so this is like the closest\nthing to like the ten commandments\nalthough you don't have to follow them\nbecause you're going to go to hell it's\njust these are processes of spiritual\ngrowth and as you move along this axis\nthis is just part of reason my\nhandwriting is bad is because half the\niPad is sitting off of the desk\nhe's gonna be a lot better when I'm back\nat my other set okay so you spiritually\ngrow like through these processes so\nyamas and niyamas soar things like\nahimsa or Bromage arya so himsa means\nnon-violence satya is truth so examples\nare sathya truthfulness himsa\nnon-violence like other things include\ncleanliness so these are observances\nthat you do for yourself and observances\nthat you do towards other people and as\nyou start to become a truthful person so\nif you stop lying\nbut Roger Yogi's are the Yogi's claim or\nbelieve or tell you that they give you a\nhypothesis that as you lie less as you\nbecome less violent you become more of a\nspiritual person I mean what a spiritual\nmean it means moving a step closer to\nenlightenment we'll talk about that in a\nsecond okay you guys are probably like\nwhat is this after you've meditation\nwe'll get there so next thing is awesome\nthese are yoga postures okay so why do\nwe do this because like so remember that\nthe goal here so we're going to end up\ndown here with Samadhi which is\ntemporary enlightenment so the goal of\nRaja Yoga is to level up slowly to where\nyou get to like your last sage which is\nsomebody which is to enter into a state\nof temporary enlightenment and in the\nprocess of that leveling up like it's\nhard like you can't just go you know\nstraight to endgame content some ideas\nlike endgame content and so in order to\nget to Samadhi you have to like level up\nwith yama and the yama and the first\nreal meditative practice that you do\nyes sorry the first meditative practice\nthat you do is actually awesome which is\nphysical postures so today when we were\ndoing yoga I was encouraging you guys to\nnotice that your mind is in the present\nso your mind literally becomes trained\nto like understand what being in the\ndislike and the more time that you spend\nbeing in the present and focused in\nawesome the easier it is to meditate\nafterward because your mind is already\nlike knows how to adopt that stance of\nfocus and in meditation so after that is\nbrown a.m. so these are breathing\ntechniques so a lot of the techniques\nthat I teach on stream or to you guys\nare not actually meditation techniques\nthey're prime so pranayama is a set of\nbreathing techniques that's aimed to\nstabilize your life force or Qi to make\nyour like body and mind conducive to\nmeditation so there used to like kind of\ncalm the mind but they're not actually\ntrue meditation so next is breath the\nhata\nso these techniques are sensory\nwithdrawal techniques okay and so what\nthis means is these are these are\ntechniques that are designed to\nessentially bring your senses into\nyourself so if we think about so we're\ngoing to talk about breathy haaaa\nokay so I think this is an important\nthing to understand sensory\nwith soul okay I'll work on my\nhandwriting as I promised so let's think\nabout this for a second normally our\nattention goes how does our attention\nlike where's our attention so we have\nsight sound smell touch in aesthetics so\nif you think about it like our attention\nnormally like goes into these things\nright so I'm walking down the street and\nI smell something cooking and then like\nmy attention like follows that scent and\nthen my mind starts to think about food\nand or I see something like I'm like oh\nlook there's an advertisement for a\nvideo let's say I'm like on my computer\nand then I'm scrolling through Reddit\nand then I see like oh like on our\ngaming like there's a game that's coming\nout today like Mountain Blade 2 is\ncoming out today Oh interesting it's\nearly access something like my site then\ntriggers my mind and my attention kind\nof like leaves my body like leaves my\nmind and goes into whatever I'm looking\nat so in my mind is occupied externally\nso now my question pancakes exactly\nright so now my question is what happens\nwhen you're it so what happens to your\ncapacity to listen to music when you\nclose your eyes\nwhat do you guys think\nright so now my question okay so let's\nassume this for a second so let's say\nthat I knock out site and then sound\ngets enhanced smell gets enhanced but\nlet's do this try to get some hands\ntaste gets enhanced\nand your kinesthetic sense gets in this\nokay so now my question is like what\nhappens so when we're doing yoga and our\neyes are closed it's easier to feel our\nour body right like it's easier to feel\nthe vibrations so let's say that we\nknock this out what happens to the other\nsenses\nwhat do you guys think\nplus plus very good right so I want you\nguys to think about this for a second so\nfirst of all we're gonna notice what\nthis means what this means so when I'm\nwhen I'm doing yoga and I close my eyes\nand I focus on my body do you guys\nunderstand that that doesn't mean\nthoughts happen right so mine does not\nanywhere in here mind is separate from\nall of this because mind is thoughts and\nI would argue that when you get lost in\nyour mind all of the ease actually\ndecrease does that make sense\nlike when I'm daydreaming or I'm\noccupied in my thoughts my attention is\nactually in the mind it's not in any of\nmy senses and if we think about a lot of\nmeditation techniques they involve using\nthe senses to pull you out of mind right\nso like I almost want you guys to\nenvision it this way that it's mind\nversus senses you guys see that\nso like this this has an antagonistic\nrelationship to the sentences so so\nlet's just think about this for a second\nso if I you know when I'm doing yoga and\nI close my eyes and my kinesthetic sense\nincreases I'm focused in the present I\ncan feel my body in a new way if i close\nmy eyes and really smell food and taste\nfood and i'm not distracted by like\nwatching TV then the experience of food\nenhances so there's an antagonistic\nrelationship between thoughts and senses\nor thoughts and attention so the\nattention can either go here towards the\nmind or it can go to the others in in a\nsense that's true of all the other\nsenses as well like if I'm you know\nbecause we kind of said that if I close\nmy eyes my sound enhances so you could\nargue that if I'm if I'm seeing and\nhearing at the same time and that each\nof those is reduced so there are\nantagonistic relationships between all\nof these so now my question to you guys\nis if I if my attention if my mind is\nempty so through yoga I've managed\nin my mind because I'm not thinking\nabout anything and then I cut out each\nsense where does my attention go what\ndoes it focus on where does it go what's\nhere nope incorrect not thoughts what\ndoes that mean to yourself what is\nyourself what is that to the body no the\nkinesthetic senses the body this is the\nbody enlightenment in the present\nBIGBANG mind reflection cell what a self\nwhat does you say self what is that\nfreedom nothing present what does that\nmean empty just mean what present moment\nwhat where's time in all this what does\ntime have to do or when I when I am\nsensing my body and with my eyes closed\nwith full attention am I not in the\npresent moment so this is meditation\nnow you guys understand what meditation\nis this is true meditation so you guys\nare using all these words and you're\ndescribing to me what it's like to swim\nto someone who's never been in water so\nthis is meditation this is the goal of\nmeditation it's not to be in any of\nthese things\nit's the systematic process of let me\nput it this way this is actually a\nbetter answer this is where your mind\ngoes this is what what it is okay so\nwhat are the words that Yogi's used to\ndescribe this Advait near gyoon Advait\nmeans non-dual\nwhat does that mean we ten\nto think about things that are good or\nbad light or dark positive or negative\nhot or cold and this state is neither it\nis non dual it is just one thing it is\nwhat it is what my first description I\nstill have this description so I wrote\nlike a journal entry about my first real\nexperience of meditation and the title\nof the journal entry was business and I\nwas really really excited because I felt\nlike I had discovered something and I\nsent it to like half a dozen people who\nI knew and I was like read this and like\ntell me if you get it and everyone was\nlike I don't understand what the\nyou're talking about they didn't\nunderstand like what I was saying and I\nwas just talking about like business\nbusiness is what this state is so in its\non script they call it non dual or\nwithout quality so objects or things in\nthe world have qualities right this\nshirt is blue this microphone is up the\nmicrophone is on my head we can describe\nqualities to all kinds of things their\nlocation in space their color their\ntastes their weight there are all kinds\nof qualities that we give to all kinds\nof stuff in the world we can say things\nare good things are bad things are\npleasurable things are painful things\nare present things are past things are\nfuture there are all kinds of qualities\nthat we can ascribe but that this state\nis actually without any quality it is\nthat which is with no quality and that\nis what meditation is okay now let's go\nback so now you guys see how like if you\nwant to get to the state so these last\ntwo are gonna be about this state but if\nyou guys want to get there do you guys\nsee how like you have to train yourself\nto do this process like Xing this out\nand then Xing this out and then Xing\nthis out like this is something that you\ncan train yourself to do so this is what\npractice is okay next is hot enough\nwhich is focus so this is actually\ntaking the mind in\nget on one thing so one pointedness of\nthe mind okay so now let's talk about\npattern number one pointed mind so let\nme ask you guys something\nwhat happens when I when something\nbecomes constant for me what happens to\nmy awareness of it you guys know it's\nactually an AR so sorry it goes away\nperfect right so if I put this shirt on\nfirst thing in the morning I noticed the\nshirt like when I put my deodorant on\nthis morning I noticed the smell and as\nthe smell becomes constant\nI lose it right if you like if there's a\nbackground hum of like construction\nafter a while you like get acclimatized\nto it and it falls away so the goal of\ntottentot is to use one object to push\nall others away so you can't turn off\nyour mind you can't it's very hard to\npush something out of your mind like if\nyou have anxiety and I tell you to stop\nthinking about anxiety that does not\nwork right you can the mind you cannot\nstop the mind all you can do is direct\nthe mind so when someone is having a\npanic attack we don't tell you hey stop\nthinking about the panic just stop\nthinking those thoughts that doesn't\nwork what we do is we direct your mind\nto a different place so we say okay\nfocus on your breath and take slow\nbreaths so you can redirect the mind\nthat you can't stop it can't stop it\nokay so then the question becomes like\nonce you redirect the mind and then your\nmind is focused on one thing what\nhappens when your mind acclimatize this\nto that thing well we'll get to step six\nand seven powder another step six\nah hold on a second\nso moves on does it move on so actually\nwhen you do not enough properly so this\nis what we so this is how our mind works\nokay object one object to object three\nobject four\nso these are thoughts okay so what we're\ngonna do with la donna is whenever we\nhave a thought we're gonna actually\ndirect it back so let's say object five\nis the breath and then we have another\nthought and then what I don't know we're\ngonna be like come back to the breath\nand then we think about pancakes so\nwe're gonna come back to the breath and\nthen we think about handwriting so we're\ngoing to come back to the breath and\nthen over time all we're gonna have is\nthought five and then eventually thought\nfive gets smaller smaller\nand then we're left with this right so\nwhat is this this is this this is the\nquestion mark so all we have is raw\nattention without any focus and then\nyou're left with emptiness and this is\nstep seven gianna this is really\nmeditative\nState okay\nsort of like mindfulness we'll talk\nabout mindfulness in a second okay so\nthis is where a lot of confusion around\nmeditation comes people say I'm not good\nat meditating I can't meditate other\npeople are getting good at meditating\nand I can't do it and when I ask them\nwhat do you mean by that and they say\nlike I can't like people say empty their\nthoughts I can't empty my thoughts so\nthe first thing to understand is that\nnot or not is a verb admit it sorry and\nBeyond is a state so this is so I don't\nknow is something that you can do and\nthis is something that happens to you\nright so when people say I had a very\nproductive meditation session what\nthey're talking about is that they\nentered the state of meditation and they\nhung out there for a while they spent\ntime over here okay other times people\nsay I didn't have a protected productive\nmeditation session and I tried and tried\nand tried and it didn't work for me and\nessentially they spent time here you\nguys seen the difference and so when\npeople say like meditate you guys have\nto understand that meditation is like\ngoing to bed and falling asleep right\nand what do I mean by that like so when\nI say I I went to sleep at ten o'clock\nlast night that is impossible you cannot\ngo to sleep it is impossible to go to\nsleep sleep is not a verb that you do\nsleep is a state of mind that if you're\nlucky you achieve or happens to you you\ncan go to bed I can lay down close my\neyes and pull the covers over my head or\nunder my head but that's not sleep\nthat's going to bed what is something\nyou can do one is something that happens\nto you and that's what's hotter a nun\nTiana's one of the biggest problems in\nEnglish is that like when we teach\nmeditation we don't draw the distinction\nbetween verb and state like we don't\neach that as part of the basics which i\nthink is criminal because like no wonder\nlike people just misunderstand\nmeditation so hard and that's because\nwhat happens is you have people who\nreally understand meditation who then\ntrained people who become certified in\nmeditation and then they go and teach\nother people because you're a certified\nmeditation teacher but a certified\nmeditation teacher does not make you a\ngood meditation teacher because in the\nWest we have like qualifications that\nyou meet but good teachers are gurus\nright and like a good teacher can teach\nand then people don't understand the\nreason that so many people misunderstand\nmeditation is because you have a lot of\ncertified and bad teachers out there\ndoesn't mean that they they're not like\ngood people it just means that they're\nnot qualified to teach but they teach\nbecause they're certified fine so in the\nold system there was no certification\nfor meditation teaching your teacher\nbasically said okay now you are capable\nof teaching like they just assign you\nlike that certification\nwhereas now like we essentially have a\nprotocol for certification if you go\nthrough eight weeks of training your\ncertified teacher it's not an individual\nassessment of like the teachers\ncapability to teach and that's why I\nthink we have a lot of misunderstandings\nokay so let's kind of go back to this so\npattern of Keanu and Samadhi\nokay so beyond is the meditative state\nof mind where it's a no mind state and\nyou're kind of like in this place okay\nyou're over here actually there's\nthere's two phases actually so this is\nEon and this is so much okay so that\nthey're actually like sub levels so even\nin Samadhi they're like further two\nlevels of this so that's kind of beyond\nour scope because you really have to\nexperience some honey they even\nunderstand it's kind of like me saying\nyou know it's like trying to explain\nlike color to a blind person let alone\nthe blind person doesn't even understand\nsight but like trying to explain color\nto them is even like a completely\ndifferent thing\nso the first thing is like you know you\nhave to start by like looking at the\nworld in black and white and that we can\nkind of do like I can I can explain the\nidea that like you can visually perceive\nobjects to a blind person and then once\nyou're able to visually perceive things\nthen like you take the next step of\nexplaining color to a colorblind person\nso we're kind of two steps away so we're\nnot going to go into further states of\nSamadhi okay so let's actually stick\nhere so now so this is meditation okay\nthis is like understanding meditation so\nlet's kind of try to recap a little bit\nso when we think about meditative\ntechniques there are a couple of\ndifferent techniques that we can use or\nactually let's just talk about\nmindfulness for a second so what is my\nboss so mindfulness is actually in\nSanskrit it's called sakshi Wow or\nwitnessing attitude and Sakshi Prague is\nthe first step of not enough so it's\nlike the first achievement sorry first\nstep of beyond so there are actually\nlike a lot of states of mind so Sachi\nBob is kind of like the most basic state\nof pion and there are further levels of\nJohn and even further levels of Samadhi\nso mindfulness is not even it's not\nreally even a meditative state it's just\na witnessing attitude it's the capacity\nto separate so it's the capacity to\nseparate self from mind and observe this\ndifference okay so that like these are\nseparate things\nthere's dit actually what I should do is\nthis so most of the time we don't really\nthink about ourselves is different from\nour mind we don't really think about the\nfact that there's like a gap between\nself and mind like we think that who we\nare is what we think\nso mindfulness is like increasing the\ngap between self and mine and just\nobserving this difference this\ndifference is mindfulness it's not even\nreally meditation and and so mindfulness\nis like a great preparatory exercise but\nthe goal like you'll cultivate\nmindfulness if you do this practice but\nit's not the goal it's just it's like\nthe first realization that self and mind\nare different okay and then as you get\ndeeper you'll do different kinds of\nyou'll get a bit deeper understanding so\nwhat does this mean practically okay so\nnow I'm going to run through a couple of\nthings so if you want to meditate what\nkind of meditation should you do so if\ncouldn't aleni yoga I'm gonna talk about\nKundalini Yoga for a second pause it's\nthere that there are seven chakras and\neach chakra has certain attributes and\nthat working on these chakras will give\nyou certain how can I say the certain\nachievements or abilities so for example\nwhen I'm teaching meditation personally\none-on-one to someone who wants like\nlike okay so then what we have to think\nabout let's just pause reciting so let\nme say this so what I want you guys to\nunderstand is that thun throt is about\nsort of the outside world and yoga is\nreally about the self so nothing in yoga\nhas anything to do with like money or\npower or fame or wealth or any any kind\nof stuff Yoga is just about the\nsystematic process of like being able to\ndo things like this this is what Yoga is\nabout this is what yoga is about nothing\nhere has anything to do with like magic\nor accumulating wealth or power or\nanything like that done through is about\nthat stuff done throw is about\naccumulating a particular kind of Shakti\nor energy and then directing that energy\ntowards a particular goal now directing\nthat energy you could direct it towards\nyour personal\nspiritual practice so the mantra that I\nstarted using myself that my teacher\ngave me so he asked me like are you\ninterested in being like\nmaterialistically successful or\nspiritually successful and I said I want\nboth and he said okay that's fine so he\ngave me a mantra that helped me grow\nspiritually it also helped me become\nmaterialistically successful so I really\ndo I mean it's kind of weird but like\nwhen I think about moving from you know\n2.5 GPA to like being a harvard-trained\nphysician and faculty at Harvard Medical\nSchool I really wonder about\nstatistically how how often that happens\nif the statistical probability is quite\nlow it makes me wonder if there was\nsomething specific that I did to\nincrease my odds and I really do I know\nthis sounds crazy I don't understand it\nmyself but if you just look at it if\nthere's a statistical phenomenon that's\nquite rare either I am one out of a\nmillion or there is something out there\nsome other factor at play that is\nresponsible for my success and I\nsometimes wonder if the month are is\nresponsible for that success because\nI've been tainting this month or now for\n16 years and like my life seems to be on\na generally upward trajectory so who\nknows so Don Thoreau though is about\nsort of directing energy towards a\nparticular outcome yes so survivorship\nbias is completely correct right so it's\nit's very possible so I'm not saying\nthat like I don't think that we have\nenough evidence that month or is\nactually work I don't think so so there\nare so Thunder is sort of about\naccumulation of energy and directing\nthat energy Yoga is about purification\nof the self and moving towards\nenlightenment and Kundalini Yoga is kind\nof in the middle so Kundalini Yoga is\nabout purification of certain chakras\nand as you purify those chakras you gain\ncertain kinds of abilities or intuitions\nof house and what I mean by that is like\nso I'll ask people when I you know when\nI'm teaching them Kundalini Yoga if I\nthink they're good for Kundalini Yoga\nI'll ask them are you interested in\ncontrolling\nimpulses are you interested in\nmetabolizing negativity are you\ninterested in gaining compassion are you\ninterested in exerting influence on the\noutside world or are you interested in\nknowledge and basically depending on\nwhat they pick out of these I'll teach\nthem different kinds of practices so now\nwe got to just talk about neuroscience\nfor a second so lately there are all\nthese different techniques of meditation\nso you can do month or you can do\nKundalini Yoga you can do Raja yoga\nright and even within Raji o you can do\nawesome so you can do physical things\nyou can do breathing techniques you can\ndo sensory withdrawal techniques you can\ndo focusing techniques all of these are\nforms of meditation so which one do you\npick and it kind of depends on what\nyou're looking for so if you want a\nparticular outcome in the in the in the\nmaterial world I would say that like\nthunder is better for you if you want to\ngrow in a very specific way a particular\npart of your capability than I think\nKundalini Yoga is good and this is where\nI believe that different meditation\ntechniques map to different parts of the\nbrain in terms of like what they do and\nso doing a particular meditation\ntechnique I think for example you know\non aa hudsucker techniques which are the\nheart chakra which are the compassion\ntechniques so like Metta meditation is a\ngood example of this I believe that\nthose kinds of techniques actually work\non a different part of your brain like\nthey work on your empathic centers of\nthe brain more so than like let's say\nyour your knowledge kind of centers so\nlike your intuition or your brains\nability to calculate is\ndifferent from your brain's ability to\ncalculate or subconsciously process\nbecause that's where intuition comes\nfrom using your brain's capacity to\nsubconsciously process or calculate is\nfundamentally different from your\nbrain's capacity to be empathic or\ncompassionate and so I think that like\nwas you do these different techniques\nthe best explanation that I can come up\nwith is that it actually Maps the\ndifferent parts of the brain and there's\nvery preliminary evidence of this\nthere's actually a study that was done\nout of UCLA that actually looked at like\nan aha chakra meditation specifically so\ncompassion oriented meditations and\nwhether they're different from a\nneuroscience perspective than other\nforms of meditation likes traditional\nmindfulness and there are studies on\nthings like TM and other forms of\nmeditation which show that there are\nactually different EEG patterns\ndepending on what kind of meditation you\ndo so there's some basic evidence that\nmeditation of there is actually evidence\nwe can we can conclude that meditation\naffects the brain in different ways so\ndifferent meditation techniques affect\nthe brain in different ways that is\nactually a scientific statement of fact\nbut how each meditation affects the\nbrain and in what ways certain\nmeditation techniques affect the brain\nwe actually have no idea we have very\nlittle scientific data for that so I am\nsort of extrapolating or using reasoning\nto connect dots that may be\nscientifically invalid that each of\nthese meditation techniques work\nsomewhat differently on the brain last\nthing that I'll share with you guys is\nthat impulse control is what I do for\naddiction so what I can say\nscientifically here is that when I teach\npeople these impulse control techniques\nthey're their addiction their ability to\ncontrol their addiction in their\nsobriety improves and furthermore\nimproves over groups of people who do\nlike plain mindfulness so does that mean\nthat I'm a better clinician that could\nbe a confounding variable I just need\nmaybe a better teacher it may not be the\nkind of technique that I teach it may be\nlike my personal clinical impact but I\nreally do believe that these type\nkind of do work so like impose control\nof meditation techniques are better at\ncontrolling addictions then let's say\nlike intuition or knowledge techniques\nthese are the techniques that I use for\ntrauma these are the techniques that I\nuse for wealth for lack of a better term\nso when I have a client that comes to me\nthat says that I want to be like more\nmaterialistically successful I teach\nthem these techniques and then for\npeople who just want to understand like\nwho they are and how they work in the\nnature of the universe I teach them\nthese techniques but people just want to\nknow like some people come to me and\nthey're like I want to understand how\nthis stuff works\nbut all I just want to understand all of\nit so this actually is my personal path\nso I do these kinds of techniques and so\nthat's meditation so let's see if we've\ngot what we're going to take a couple of\nquestions so let's go ahead and start so\nI'm gonna start with near critique and\nKevin and Kabir Tech teller okay so\nlet's see if we can get you guys in\nwhich meditations for gamers great\nquestion so I think it depends on on\nwhere you are but I think that you\nshould start with actually pranayama or\nshould the techniques okay people are\njoining great\nhey dr. Kate hey yeah so hi the question\nis so Abby's breath primary pronoun yeah\nis that a bra Nia Donna no technique or\nbut the heretic because it was you\nbuzzing ow\nit sort of inhibits your uh no sound I\nguess like it you focuses on within the\nsong dies down so I was wondering was\ntechnique tennis yes so Brahma refrán I\nsurprised I am is the pranayama so the\nbe the actual humming is upon I am but\nthe Shan Mookie mudra which is this this\nthing that we do mm-hmm the that's a\npratyahara right just like so the Shan\nWilke mudras or pratyahara mudra and you\ncan combine them so there are some\nthings like you know you'll have\ndifferent teachers will have different\nkinds of like Korea's so take like two\nor three different meditation techniques\nand they'll make their own meditation\nbrand TM and they'll say like this is\nmine and this is my special technique I\nthink it's better than all the others I\nmean since my second question is what\nabout the potentially psychosis that you\ntalked about that can occur from\nKundalini Yoga and is there a way you\ncan predict the risk of that in a person\nyeah so that's a great question so\nfantastic question so one thing that\nI'll tell you guys is that meditation is\nnot without risks so there are case\nreports of meditation induced psychosis\nwhich is quite rare of a phenomenon but\nI think that like you know a lot of the\ntechniques that I mean some thankfully\nmost meditation like the world does not\nreally understand like more than than\ntwo percent of meditation techniques all\nof the meditation that's being taught by\nheadspace and mindfulness and things\nlike that that's finally primarily\nbecause mindfulness is what spread\nmindfulness is a tiny tiny part of real\nmeditative tradition and so generally\nspeaking mindfulness and the mindfulness\nbased techniques are very very safe and\nhave a low likelihood don't lead to\npsychosis\nif you go and actually learn Kundalini\nYoga and things like that from a real\nteacher I'm not talking about going to a\nyoga studio down the street\ndoing awesome that's not real I mean\nit's the first step of Kundalini Yoga\nit's that it's kind of like a Kundalini\nYoga is like stretching before a\nmarathon\nlike what you learn at the yoga studio\nis is like stretching before a marathon\nit's not actually the practice it's the\npreparation for true Kundalini Yoga but\nso what's the so the first thing is that\npsychosis is possible and so you\nshouldn't do like hardcore meditation\nwithout the guidance of a Buddha okay so\nyou should have a teacher who really\nunderstands this stuff and then they can\nteach you but anything you do at a yoga\nstudio is fine anything you do with a\nnap is fine anything I teach you is\nprobably fine um I tend to teach more\nadvanced techniques than most people\nlike I do teach like so this this\ntechnique for example is actually a\nKundalini Yoga technique but it's very\nmild basically and so how can you\npredict the risk I'd say it so your\noverall stability so remember that like\nyoga is intended to be practiced by\npeople who are purified right so these\nare people who are truthful they don't\nlie they're not necessarily celibate but\nthey're not lustful they're a lot of the\nmost of the time they're vegetarian\nright so you're like a very like pure\nperson so like if you're having trouble\nwith like addictions or anger or\ndepression or anxiety like you're not\nreally ready for deep yoga practice or\nmeditation techniques so I'd say that\nlike the way that you predict risk is\nbased on the stability of a person so I\nhad a patient once who was very very\ndepressed and they wanted to go on a\n10-day silent meditation retreat because\nthey thought that like through this\nintensive meditation they would get like\na high dose of meditation and their\ndepression will be cured there's a\nchance that that can happen but there's\nalso like that's the recipe for\npsychosis because when you get someone\nwho is ill or unwell or not at peace\nwith themselves and then you give them a\nvery very high dose of meditation and\nthey're gonna run into problems it's\nkind of like taking someone who is\nuntrained and swimming and dumping them\nin the ocean like they're just not ready\nfor it they might learn to swim but then\nmy drone as well so absolutely right so\nthey it's absolutely sink or swim so I\nI'd say you know start with this start\nwith the small stuff and then get to the\nmore extreme or esoteric stuff when\nyou're ready in health\nand then a teacher supposedly will\npresent themselves when you're ready\nokay great question thanks backs out\ngreat day oh this is my son yeah okay\nthis was my first webinar and really\nthoroughly enjoyed what you forgive me\nfor my naive language but so I invested\nmy focus in the lecture that you just\ngave now and my question is sort of\nbranching out of that so I believe that\nmeditation is something as a state of\nmind or whatsoever where you can\nunderstand and also salt right and to\nunderstand is to recognize problems I\nsaw a question in chat which branched\nthis question out of me which is like\nokay do you have a mantra for decision\ndecision-making so what I was what I'm\ntrying to say is I believe that\nmeditation is the kind of state where\nyou can question your own\ndecision-making and question the source\nof your own insecurities and is it how\ndo you derive it down to a mantra or\npractice to solve that what you're\nrecognizing is that yes all right let me\nask you something you said that you\nbelieve meditation is what so I think\nmeditation as a box with a question mark\non it is something that allows you to\nunderstand and also something that\nallows you to solve now what your\nunderstanding is probably your own\ninsecurities or something about your\nimpulses for decision making so let's\nlet's start with this critique have you\nbeen in the box state Oh\npossibly it's hard to say okay so the\nfirst thing is that is that so your your\nquestion comes from a foundation that\nthat box state is a particular thing so\nuntil you know what the Box state is the\nrest of your questions are logical kind\nof like you're building this on a\nfoundation of what you believe a\nmeditative state is\nright right so unless that assumption is\ncorrect or incorrect the rest of your\nwhat you're saying becomes relevant or\nirrelevant\nyeah does that make sense yeah yeah so I\nthink the first step is to get to the\nbox state and figure out whether your\nfundamental assumption is correct or\nincorrect like I agree with how you\ndescribed the Box state as you drew it\nright now I could fully correlate and\nunderstand how cutting out attention in\ncertain aspects increases is another way\nand then you reach this meditative state\nof mind which allows you to sit down and\nfocus on one thing and sort of like you\nknow the way I narrow it down to myself\nis I always think of it as a it's like\nyou're running towards a balance of what\nto internalize and externalize that's if\nI just say it in one line that's how I\nsay to myself okay so what's your\nquestion right so my thing is how do you\nderive of what is a suit suitable mantra\nor a practice based on what you can\nfigure out is a possible insecurity yeah\nso I think that there - - a couple of\nthings so the first thing is that I\nthink something about your conception I\nkind of disagree with which is why I'm\nsaying you have to start by actually\ngetting to the statement and the reason\nI say that is because actually like in\nmy experience you don't need a mantra if\nyou can get to the state so if you can\nget to the state then the insecurity\nstarts to dissolve on its own more in\nthe state a month or will be revealed to\nyou that you can use to kind of\nconsciously dissolve it the purpose of a\nmantra is this because it's given by\nsomeone who has been to the state to\nsomeone who has not been to the state\nand it helps that person because it's\nkind of like formulaic and a protocol to\nin a month absolutely yeah all right so\nthat's why mantra is given by like a\nteacher to a disciple because the\ndisciple hasn't been to where the\nteacher has been because\nonce you get to the where the teachers\nyou don't need the month or anymore so\nif you're talking about following the\ndiscipline of to recognize it for\nyourself sort of like a well it's it's\neither over right so one thing is if you\nhave a particular in secular two paths\none is that if you have an insecurity\nyou do like yoga and meditation and if\nyou meditate long enough you're gonna\nget to the state and the problem is\ngonna be fixed on itself just getting to\nthat state will free you from the\nproblem and that's what we see right\nlike what like so I know that sounds\nabsolutely bizarre but like we have\nclinical evidence of this so you take a\nhundred people with anxiety all of their\nanxieties are different you teach them\nup meditation protocol and eight weeks\nlater their anxiety is clinically\nsignificant there's a statistically\nsignificant clinical improvement so how\ndoes that work it's not a specific month\nor for each of their anxieties or\ninsecurities by getting closer and\ncloser to the Box state it dissolves the\nroot of anxiety so that the particular\ninsecurities actually becomes completely\nirrelevant\nmm-hmm right but that's that's my point\nand we were if you go back and you watch\nthe anxiety lecture you'll see that that\nanxiety has a root so if you get into\nthe box say you don't need a mantra\nbecause you're dealing with it on its\nown the purpose of a mantra is if you're\nunable to get to a box state or you want\nto an acceleration towards a particular\nbox state no no that's a little bit of\nan oxymoron but then you're you're given\na month or up by someone who's more\nspiritually knowledgeable than you and\nthen it kind of accelerates you in that\nway hmm does that answer your question\nso you're gonna go either way it's just\nthem you know you can target a security\nas in security specifically and if you\nwant to target it specifically you\nbasically need a teacher who will tell\nyou how to dissolve that right so that\nteacher doesn't have to be a spiritual\nteacher that's what psychologists do -\nis it knowledge yourself - yeah\nabsolutely\nbut if you want to teach yourself then\nyou don't use a month or how you use the\nyoga path and then you'll teach yourself\nhmm\nokay yes thanks very much much respect\ntake care thank you all right we're\ngonna get a couple other we'll do one\nmore question so first person I'm\ninviting Ryan Lucca and Tristan and Lisi\nso let's see if we can get someone else\nwill do like one or two more questions\nokay Simon with us\nokay so we're inviting more people great\nLisi has joined the room fantastic\nso it'll probably take him a second -\nhey can you hear me\nyou're not gonna you yeah let's see go\nfor it okay so little problems with\nmeditation as a whole\nokay about five about I would say like I\nguess like I try to do it like in the\nmiddle of the day because I'm not very\ngood in the mornings my body's a very\nunstable so I do roundabouts noonish\nmaybe one o'clock here should maybe\nafter lunch and I know we get like three\nminutes into it and then for some reason\nmy chest like feels a lot stress and\nit's my body forcibly tries to pull me\nout of it sure and I and that is and\nmaybe a weights like like way like like\nI deal with that all snoring any history\nof trauma um my bra\nthey trauma say history prom oh yeah\njust like a yeah yeah oh I've tons yeah\nso that's a very common experience for\npeople who have a history of trauma yeah\nso let me explain to you so I think\nlisten your solution is gonna be in the\nkind of meditation technique that you do\nokay so let's understand what happens in\nthe mind with trauma yes so when you\nhave a traumatic event your mind tries\nto protect you from it yes and the way\nit protects you from it is by putting\nlike you know like pressure plates like\nor like putting a bunch of weight on top\nof the trauma to push it down oh okay\nokay so when you do meditation yeah as\nyou open your mind and you relax you\nknow all of that pressure that's keeping\nyour trauma at bay relaxes and then the\nTrop astronomers leaking out yes and\nthen so like as you do like mindfulness\nlike what kind of matter you do like\nmindfulness meditation I've been\nmindfulness have been third i I've done\nchakrams I've done sound I've done I've\ndone one we once we have to use certain\nlike I've done body scans I've done\nvisualization so done\nthose are you have a different like\nthree meditations that seem to work the\nbest almost like the body scanner I got\ninside like but like at least five\nminutes I didn't the other pull down\nwith go usually you're gonna talk\nthere's actually so this is something\nwhere what I'm about to say actually has\ngood scientific evidence to support okay\nso the first thing to understand is that\nyour mind is trying to keep the trauma\nat bay and gel so you do something like\nan open awareness meditation like\nmindfulness where you just let whatever\nis in your mind like flood about right\nso trauma people who have trauma I do\nnot teach the mindfulness because I\nthink mindfulness is a bad thing to\nteach I dried it once and let see my my\nhead is lateesha shaking look at it\nagain if you look at the meditation\ntechniques so there's something called\ndialectical behavioral therapy don't I\nhave to go the dialect of dialectical\nbehavioral therapy is a modification of\ncognitive behavioral therapy that\nincludes quarter quote mindfulness so\nthis is an avid the best evidence-based\ntreatment for something called\nborderline personality disorder and most\npeople who have borderline personality\ndisorder have trauma early in their life\nyes this is the best scientific\ntreatment for people as so you can sort\nof do a little bit of a hop skip and a\njump to say this is the best scientific\nthis is a scientifically validated\nmeditation regimen for people who have a\nhistory of trauma and if you look at\ntheir corner quote mindfulness\ntechniques they're actually not open\nawareness Zen techniques they're very\nsensory grounding techniques so what\nthey actually do is it's not open\nawareness where you're watching your\nmind and you're emptying your mind their\nmind is actually very focused on a\nparticular sensation or bodily\nexperience yeah I found I found one of\nfocusing on like this I've been doing\nsound meditation like yeah three times\nthis week and it's been doing better\nthan any other mentation have done what\nyou need to do Lisi is not empty your\nmind no indoor meditation techniques\nshould not empty your mind at all they\nshould be dominated by one thing and on\nhow as they get dominated by that one\nthing because you know if you dominate\nyour mind with one thing the trauma\nis gonna stay at bay okay $0.10 resumix\nempty your mind your mind is gonna be a\nvacuum and the trauma is gonna come\nrushing in because of the negative\npressure in your mind is this gonna fill\nthe void absolutely so mindful\ntechniques are not good for you so buy\nskins so physical techniques are gonna\nbe the absolute best okay so like body\nscanning is good Yoga is gonna be\nexcellent for you your imagination\nthe Yungas moon brilliance absolutely\nright so your meditation should be yoga\nso when we do yoga together and I tell\nyou to like focus on the present like\nthat's where your that foundation of\nyour meditation and then as you get more\ncomfortable with that then you can start\nrolling in breath techniques but also\nbreath techniques that are very rigorous\nso your brother so much here like the\ntrunk monk to try one we like triphasic\nbreathing yes so that so all of your\nmeditation should demand mental\nconcentration because if you let your\nmind relax trauma is gonna come rushing\nout got it yep really can you hear me no\nyeah listen you does that answer your\nquestion\nthat's absolute perfect okay awesome a\nbeen pulled out of my meditation like\nevery often you watching you don't want\nto keep the trauma at bay and then over\ntime you learn how to let a little bit\nof it leak out in doses they can handle\nbut your mind will handle that for you\nokay you don't have to worry about it\nokay that's perfect my mom take care man\ngood luck yeah okay Simon okay okay yeah\nso my question is actually also related\nto trauma I'm like I think the main\npoint of my question is how like like\ncomplying this Eastern stuff that you're\nteaching us with the traditional Western\ntherapy that takes place because I also\nI have like si PTSD and so basically my\nlike I'm because I'm like still waiting\nin queue to get into therapy I don't\nknow like it will be several months I'm\nactually doing a sort of like self\nexposure at home so I'll be like writing\nabout the traumatic event or I'll be\nlike speaking it out loud in a recorder\nso\nlike trying to do within like small\ndoses so my question is like how do I\ncombine like this self exposure stuff\nthat I'm doing with you know maybe like\nsometimes some type of meditation or\nsome type of yoga to like just heal the\ntraumas faster or more rapidly or\nwhatever yeah so I think that question\nyou know I mean I can I'm gonna sort of\npartially answer it so the short answer\nis that like if you want to combine in a\nclinical way meditation or yoga practice\nwith Western therapy which is like\nliterally what I do in my day job it\nneeds to be with like an actual mental\nhealth clinician right so like a mental\nhealth clinician has to evaluate you and\nthen sort of tell you what they think is\ngoing to be good or not good chances are\nthat the clinician that you meet is not\ngoing to be very knowledgeable about\nthis Eastern stuff because those people\nare few and far between yeah um and so\nthe core your question about how to\ncombine things so remember that\ncombining things involves Western stuff\nwith Eastern stuff and the Western stuff\nactually has to be performed by a\nclinician you got that yeah any\ndiscussion of combining these two is is\nlike it's gonna be incomplete until you\nsee a mental health professional okay so\nyeah so you're basically saying that I\nlike like there is no combination where\nthey meet in the middle it's basically\nlike two wholes meeting well no I'm\nsaying that you can't know where that\ncombination is because you haven't done\nthe Western piece yet okay okay right so\nyou're waiting to see the therapist so\nhow can I tell you how they're gonna\ncombine if you have if you don't know\nwhat the Western piece looks like okay\nyeah well I like I dunno some like you\nyou are correct that it's like better to\ndo is supervised because you don't know\nwhat else might happen to you like\nbreakdowns or whatever mental breakdowns\nbut like I've sort of like yeah just I\njust got like a quick review of what\nwe're supposed to do and it's like\nbasically meet speaking aloud about the\ntrauma and then recording myself and\nthen listening to my own recording and\nlike doing that and basically just\nrepeating the story until like I can get\nlike from 0 to 100 I'm like at a level\nof like 30 in terms of discomfort where\nI'm not comfortable Simon okay so I'm\ngonna answer more of your question but\nlet's just start by saying so I\nunderstand that you read about what the\ntherapy looks like and you started the\nprocess of doing it on your own I don't\nknow if that's a good idea or a bad idea\nbecause generally speaking in my\nexperience therapists add something to\nthe equation right like I don't know how\nelse to put that but like I mean people\ncan grow it like so the majority of\npeople deal with the majority of their\nproblems without a therapist people deal\nwith anxiety and insecurities and low\nself confidence and depression like the\naverage human being deals with all kinds\nof stuff all the time\ntherapists add something to that\nequation so I don't know if it is a good\nidea or a bad idea or I can't gauge the\nefficacy of you doing this stuff on your\nown generally speaking I'm a big fan of\nyou being reflective and trying to grow\nas a human being but like what I'm\nsaying is that you're asking how do I\ncombine eastern and western stuff and\nwhat I'm saying is that you don't really\nknow what the Western piece is yet right\nyou can lead about it you can read about\nit but like reading a book on therapy\ntechniques is very different from\nactually being a subject in therapy does\nthat make sense yeah I mean there is\nthere is still a difference I I didn't\nactually read about it but the\ndifference you're talking about remains\nbecause I haven't been a patient but\nlike the the knowledge that I'm applying\nmyself at home is actually just a quick\nreview I they received from the\ntherapists like I gotta read it online\nlike EJ just told me you're gonna wait\nin a queue and when you arrive this is\nthat stuff we're going on doing so I'm\nnot I'm not saying that what you're\ndoing is bad like I can you know let\nyour your therapist that you're gonna\nsee eventually know that you're doing\nthis but my point is your question was\nhow do I combine Western and Eastern and\nmy first point that I'm making to you is\nthat you don't actually have the Eastern\npeace filled in yet okay it's okay so\ncan we just the like it can I make a\nconcrete example so let's say I'm like\nyes\nno no so dude yeah I don't I just I just\nwant you to understand that\nif you want a comprehensive Western\nEastern treatment plan for your trauma I\nwant you to acknowledge because I don't\nthink we're on seeing eye to eye here\nthat you have not started Western\ntherapy yet okay so you're basically\nlike I think like if I'm reading your\nmind correctly like you're viewing me a\nbit too reckless you want me to slow\ndown a bit no no I'm not viewing you as\nreckless I have a second part to my\nanswer I'm just trying to get like I'm\ntrying to get on the same page about\nwhere you are right okay yes I wasn't\nyou want me to acknowledge that I know\nthat's what I'm doing is more of an\nexperimentation and that I should be\nmore patient and received the whole\nstory from my therapist not that you\nshould do anything I agree with you that\nit's experimental okay what I'm saying\nis that when you so you're asking me how\ndo I compile and combine Western and\nEastern treatment right that's your\nquestion\ncan you yeah yeah right so what I'm\nsaying is that like the western part of\nyour treatment has not really begun or\nis not completely begun yet hmm you see\nwhat I'm saying so if in my answer to\nyou we have to acknowledge that the\nWestern treatment hasn't fully started\nyet yeah right so now I'm going to give\nyou the Eastern proper what I'm saying\nis that you can't like if if I let's say\nthat I say like how do I combine like a\npizza party with a barbecue and then you\ncan say like okay I've like I have\nbreadsticks from the pizza party but I\ndon't have the pizza and we're gonna\nwe're about to talk to the barbecue but\nlike you haven't actually started\ntreatment with a therapist yeah hmm so\ncombining these two is going to evolve\nonce you actually start treatment with a\ntherapist that's all I'm trying to say\nokay okay yeah right so I'm not saying\nyou're doing something bad like that's\nbetween you and your therapist like if\nhe gave you stuff to review and you're\nreviewing it and you're finding it\nhelpful by all means go for it it's not\nmy place to say what you should or\nshouldn't do it's not my place to\ncomment about whether this is a good\nidea or a bad idea\nyou're asking me question about how to\ncombine Western treatment and Eastern\ntreatment and I just want you to\nunderstand that you can't combine those\ntwo until you start Western treatment\nokay okay so yeah yeah yeah I understand\nbut like but\nyou can't combine something that you you\ncan't combine until you have two things\nand you actually have the western piece\nyes okay so let's say let's say it's not\nokay so can I like just reformulate my\nquestion quickly so let's just say\nbecause I journal like a lot like I\nwrite about uncomfortable memories or\nlike and this is not like part of my\ntherapy necessarily it's just like a\nhabit of act up which will help me so\nlet's say I like journal about a bad\nmemory like or just journal like about\nsomething that makes me uncomfortable in\nthe moment like how do I like okay\nassuming that this is not the whole\nwestern part of it but just like a small\npart so how do I like after journaling\nsomething like should ie like do\nmeditation just so I remain with those\nuncomfortable memories like you know\nwhat I mean like yes so that that was\nthe answer that I've been trying to get\nto okay so my short answer for you Simon\nis that much like the last guy you\nshould do primarily physical techniques\nand I don't know so when I work with\npeople like I actually combine the\nWestern and Eastern so based on the\ncontent of your journal or how often you\nfeel physical sensations or what kind of\nphysical sensations you feel I will give\npeople specific meditation regimens or\nyoga regimens so whether it's a\ntightness in the throat having this in\nthe chest or a pit in your stomach or\nconstriction in your stomach tension in\nyour shoulders all of those things in my\nexperience as a therapist I will use\ndifferent techniques for so the nature\nof their trauma and what we uncovered in\ntherapy leads to a different kind of\nspecificity of meditation technique and\nthat's why I was trying to emphasize\nYorkshire I haven't started therapy yet\nso that's fine not saying what you're\ndoing is good or bad now your question\nis how do I use Eastern stuff to\naccelerate the process or supplement my\nprogress and my growth and my healing\nwhich i think is a great question\nI mean the short answer is since you\nhave a history of trauma I'd say that\nyou should do things that are heavily\nlike Earth start with things that are\nphysically oriented just like the last\nguy because we can we know from studies\non PTSD or not so they're also like\nthings like EMDR for example which are\nvery intensive donnas and evidence-based\ntreatments for PTSD so it's sort of eye\nmovement desensitization\nwhich is kinda sad it's essentially\nadharma but like essentially you want to\nfocus on one sense or your body and you\nwant to use that to fill your mind\nbecause if your mind is completely empty\nthen their trauma is going to come\nrushing back now in your case it sounds\nlike you're doing a lot of reflection on\nyour trauma so I would say there are\nother kinds of techniques that may\nbenefit you more but I still think I'm\nnot recommending these but I think like\nbass I think if we had four hours to\nwork together I'm pretty sure or not I'm\nnot pretty sure I would imagine based on\nwhat you're telling me right now that I\nwould probably give you some kind of\nlike intuition or knowledge techniques\nbecause it sounds like you're actually\nable to sit with your trauma so I'm\nalready which is different from listen\nand if you're able to sit with it\ngetting some perspective through like\nmore knowledge oriented techniques like\nthird eye techniques and charging the\nlaser beam and stuff like that I think\ncould help you but I think the safest\nanswer and the most evidence-based\nanswer is to do essentially bodily\ntechniques or techniques that are\nfocused very grounding on a particular\nsense or in your body okay so just to\nlike summarize what you've said like\nphysical techniques so I keep the trauma\nat bay so it doesn't like overwhelm me\nwell if I'm more comfortable to sit with\nthe trauma I will do intuition or\nknowledge techniques yeah but okay so\nthat aren't I definitely do not think\nyou should explore on your own okay so\neither it's a meditation teacher or a\ncompetent therapist or ideally both\nokay got it yeah so I saw and then\nyou're not gonna answer so then you're\nnot gonna answer my next question of\nwhere I can find intuition and knowledge\ntechniques no I mean I'm happy to answer\nit the short answer is when when when\nyou're ready for them someone will\npresent themselves to teach it to you\nright so I got a bigger an awesome here\nassignment is that you're impatient yeah\nI think so that's the biggest problem\nand so we can talk about well I can\nanswer as many questions as you want to\nbut you need to learn how to take this\nslow that's the most important thing to\ndeal with trauma you got to take it so\nyou can't fix it overnight so strong by\ndoing yoga and it's very unsatisfying\nbecause so this is I see\na lot where people who have liked have\nhistories of trauma or bad depression\nthey want something very intensive\nbecause they want to get better way\nfaster which is completely reasonable\nbecause you've been suffering for a long\ntime unfortunately how much you want to\nget better and how quickly you want to\nget better doesn't change the healing\nprocess if I break a leg and I want to\nget back to playing soccer what is like\njust because I want to get back to\nplaying soccer super super bad what does\nthat mean about my leg healing process\nmy brother will heal in his stone time\nexactly and the mind is no different so\njust because you want to try Slyke you\ncan't accelerate the healing process of\nyour leg you can definitely do something\nto support it you can do some things to\naccelerate it but most of it has to\nhappen kind of on its own and so the\nbiggest thing that you need is patience\ngo ahead and start doing yoga do yoga\nevery day for half an hour it's gonna be\ngood for you okay and then you'll be\nprepared for therapy if you do if you\nstart doing yoga today three months from\nnow or six months from now when you see\nyour therapist your body in your mind\nwill be in a different state and you'll\nbe able to actually like do therapy in a\nmuch more powerful way okay okay yeah\nokay good luck man bye\ntake care all right okay guys so um\nwe're gonna wrap up for today\nso thank you guys very much for coming\nthis is day 4 right of our
