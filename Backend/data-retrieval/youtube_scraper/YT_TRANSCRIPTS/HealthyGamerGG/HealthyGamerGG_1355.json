    "transcript": "so can you tell us a little bit so what\nare we calling you buddy\nMiguel Miguel okay so Miguel tell me a\nlittle bit about what's um what's what's\nbeen going on with you recently and how\nwe can help okay so I guess to start I'm\na 19 year old student at university okay\nyou know I was living at living up in\nthe dorms and I was feeling like really\ngood I don't know I guess there's no\nother way to put it I was in a good\nroutine I was doing what I wanted to do\non a day-to-day and then yeah my parents\nkind of forced me back like I assume\nlike a lot of other people do to Cove it\nand then I don't know I kind of just\nwent downhill from there okay yeah I\nthink this is kinda just a theory I\nguess but I think it seems a lot for my\nrelationship with my parents just like\nhow it's preceded this is how I say it\nokay okay yeah can you tell us can us oh\nso what you you seem to be a little bit\nof a unicorn\nMiguel because you know most of us are\nhorses but here comes Miguel who\nactually has a good routine at school\nwhich sounds very very bizarre to me\ncan we actually start with that like how\ndo you develop a good routine at school\nlike that sounds a mythical I did\nI don't know how maybe the other people\ndoesn't seem that good but for me it\nworked really well I just like get up in\nthe morning you know like you food like\ntry to work out take a run or something\ngo to class then afterwards I might\nactually like some kind of stupid but\ninspiring pro-gamer\nI guess for legal legends sure I guess\nafter class I would Matt do my\nmeditation then I just play for a while\nyou know eat somewhere in between and\nthen you know talk to my girlfriend\nsomething like that and then so true a\ntrue unicorn because not only are you\nexercising but you are in or late oh\nhold on a second yeah hello\nturn them up got it\nall right thank you all right\nokay can you can you say something again\nMiguel\noh I can't move my my closer to is that\nbetter good turn it up so keep keep\ntalking Miguel whoa okay good\nbetter fixed okay awesome thank you very\nmuch cool yes so tell us a little bit\nabout you know so how mmm so interesting\nso you wake up you eat something yeah\nrightfully and then you try to exercise\nwhat do you mean by try to exercise I'm\npretty inconsistent with it honestly\nit's like there are weeks where it's\nlike you know five times a week or\nsomething but there also works right\njust like once or twice so okay I guess\nit's kind of whenever I must have a\nwillpower to like get up with like Ron I\nguess do you think it's willpower oh I\nthink getting into the habit of it is\nbut what's up at the habit not really\nnot really yeah okay makes sense and are\nyou interested in university honestly\nnot really I'm kind of just there\nbecause my parents want me to be there\nokay and yeah okay so we can talk a\nlittle bit about that and how on earth\ndid you get a girlfriend how does that I\nthink I got really lucky honestly so\nduring my freshman year college I was a\nlot more outgoing I suppose extroverted\nand I was doing like a lot of party\nstuff like that and I actually happen to\nmeet her like the Welcome Week of my\ncollege experience so then really what\nhappened I accidentally asked her out on\na date I think when I was not completely\nsober I kind of forgot about it and then\nit just went from there oh how does one\naccidentally ask someone out on a date\nwell I was very very not sober\nand then I remember I guess I guess I\njust messaged her and I woke up the next\nmorning and she talks to me like are we\nstill on for today I'm like what are you\ntalking about and that yeah that was\nyour reaction or that was what you\nresponded to her that was my reaction\nokay awesome okay so you can you can\nthank drunk Miguel for helping out sober\nMiguel right yeah and so can you tell me\na little bit so how far are you from\nyour University how far is home away\nfrom the University oh pretty close just\n45 minutes give or take okay and where\nis your girlfriend I feels the same\nUniversity she's like right now she's\nshe lives near the University like ten\nminutes give or take so I'm also like\nthat's all right okay and are you guys\nseeing each other physically no okay\nokay\nthat's just like wanted stuff yeah I was\njust curious you know alright so you're\nyou're back at home and how do you feel\nbeing back at home um I guess I'm sorry\nget used to it but at first it was not\ngreat I guess the first day or two the\nfeeling I had described or how I\ndescribed at least was like homesick\nalmost which is kind of weird being\nhomesick for school nice in school just\nlike I guess yeah I guess school my\napartment like the life sure so um we're\ngonna ask so I'm gonna try to think a\nlittle bit about how to make this\nproductive for twitch at yeah so what I\nwant you guys to do is we're gonna use\nMiguel is sort of a test case for how to\nunderstand how his life has changed and\nwhat's responsible for the change so I'm\nmaking an assumption right so if we're\nthinking about like collecting data\nscientifically we want to start with a\nhypothesis and our hypothesis is that\nyour life at university sounded like\npretty good actually yeah and then it I\nmean since you're here today it sounds\nlike maybe your life at home is is not\nso good in some ways yes and then for us\nto try to figure out so when we look at\nour lives and we think that our lives\nare good\nor not good we tend to attribute them to\ncertain causes so we say that like oh my\nlife at university sucks because I am\nlazy right we'll say things like that or\nbecause I'm undisciplined but what I\nwant you guys to really pay attention to\nis that Miguel is in a sense the same\nperson that he was at home and at school\nso it's not necessarily some kind of\nintrinsic quality that leads to his life\nbeing good or his life not being good\nthere are other factors at play and what\nI want you guys to pay attention to is\nwhat are the variables that have changed\nin Miguel's life that have changed\nwhat's on the other side of the equal\nsign because it's not gonna be like I\nmean I'm sure maybe you feel lazy but I\nwant you guys to just kind of pay\nattention to how his Miguel's\ncircumstance changed how has his mind\nchanged and if his mind has changed if\nhis circumstance has changed then what\nis that going to do to you know this\nlife that he is clearly crushing or was\nclearly crushing yeah okay so that\nthat's what I want you all to pay\nattention to okay and I can't really see\ntwitch chat because I'm you know in my\npotato setup sorry I hope you guys got\nthat so Miguel tell us a little bit\nabout what it's like being at home\nI guess I just feel a lot more it's\nkinda stupid to say I guess but that's\nnot what's stupid to say about that I\njust like where I grew up but I guess\nit's it's like little things it's like\nI'm just absolutely like ten hours\ninstead of like the usual way I'm like\njust sitting doing nothing more just\nlike like a game or like watching\nYouTube or something I thought like go\nback to like the pro gamer type thing ah\nI just not as motivated to play a\npractice like get better I guess mmm I\ntalk to skills a lot more wasted time\nfeels wasted okay so I want you to\nnotice first Miguel two things okay\none is that you feel a particular way\nand one is that you respond to your\nfeelings of feeling a particular way\nyeah help us understand what the\ndifference is\nI guess respond to my feelings of the\nparticular ways like acting on it more\nso maybe like letting it go okay okay so\nwhat what I've heard you say a couple of\nthings that I think are your responses\nto how you feel so how you feel is that\nyou're unmotivated right you feel like\nkind of sluggish the drive is not there\nI mean you would wake up every day you\nwould eat something exercise go to class\nget home like you know try to really get\nbetter at Wow and that sort of spark or\nthat flame seems to be gone yeah what is\nyour response to that flame being gone I\nguess I just let it go away almost like\nup letting it be gone very good so what\nI'm saying so I think your response\ntowards it is actually judgment what do\nyou think about that like I guess you're\njudging yourself for being unmotivated\nso you say I let it go away yeah right\nthat implies to me that you think you\n[ __ ] up and that you said that you\nshould be different so should is a\njudgmental statement does that make\nsense I want you to keep an eye on that\nbecause when people judge themselves\nharshly what do you think it does to\ntheir motivation possibly yeah okay so\nlet's think about this for a second why\ndo you think it kills it even more it's\nkind of like dockwood spiral I guess\nyeah so you beat yourself up and how\ndoes but what is what's the effect of\nbeating yourself up you just feel worse\nso but then then if you feel worse what\ndoes that do to your motivation why is\nthat was that what you is that what your\nexperience has been yeah okay yeah okay\nso let's let's go back to when you were\nat college how much did you beat\nyourself up I mean you're in there like\nbut not like constant I guess okay\nso now we can make an observation so\nwe're gonna collect a data point we\ndon't really quite understand how this\nworks but it sounds like you felt\nconfident about yourself at university\nthat you and that that confidence meant\nthat you were less judgmental towards\nyourself and that that that lack of\njudgment every now and then maybe you\nwere judgmental but then the more\nconfident you felt about yourself you\nsort of felt inspired or motivated to\nlike practice law go to class because\nyou know a lot of people want to go pro\nin law and you know what they do at\nuniversity they wake up and they don't\ngo to class Yeah right\nso like something so there's something\ndifferent here about the downward spiral\nspiral and beating yourself up the\nreason that I expressed some skepticism\nabout that I I agree with you that it\noftentimes leads to a downward spiral\nbut some people actually get a lot of\nmotivation from beating themselves up\nyeah what do you think about that I\nthink I've experienced that sometimes\ntoo how so I guess there were a couple\nof days at university or it's just like\nyeah I feel that like I I think I should\nget up and go do something and I just\nlike force myself into the gym or\nsomething or like go do something that\nmakes me feel better yeah so I know this\nis gonna sound like a random example but\nsometimes I work with especially women\nwith anorexia who are very successful\nand the really interesting thing is that\nlike so a lot of times people with\nanorexia are just incredibly successful\nso it correlates with actually a lot of\nworldly success and most people who have\nanorexia are women and the really\ninteresting thing is that they really\nbeat themselves up for their appearance\nand they think that they do a really bad\njob and they suck at life and then their\nsense that they suck it\nlife actually drives them really hard\nthey almost like whip themselves to go\nthe extra mile and they they never feel\nlike it's good enough and they're always\nstriving to do better it's kind of a\ntorturous and suffering way to live but\nit actually causes them to crush it in\nschool and their jobs and things like\nthat what do you think about that does\nthat make sense at all or a while ago I\nguess this time just different for\nwhatever reason it's just I guess back\nthat azz looking at my life it's just\nI'm not doing anything I'm just like\nplaying games to play games I guess that\nwas the beginning of the pushing towards\nlike interesting so it sounds like you\nstarted to maybe beat yourself up and\nthat motivated you to get started but\nsomehow when you got started and you\nstarted feeling good about yourself that\nwas its own kind of motivation\nconfidence positivity all that kind of\ncrap yeah okay that's so so let's\nunderstand that motivation actually\ncomes from a couple of different places\nand we'll kind of come back to that if\nit is relevant okay okay so next thing\nis I want you to notice Miguel when and\nI want twitch chat to watch out for when\nyou make a judgmental especially self\njudgmental statement or the the word\nthat we're looking for is should okay\nbecause I think should is really like a\ngreat way like does that make sense like\nhow is should a sign of judgment because\nit's like if I were a different person I\nwould have done this or like so in\nbusiness I should have done this yep and\nand so like the opposite what's the\nopposite of judgment huh compassionate\nmmm sort of yeah I can see how it has a\nlayer of compassion so let's just well\nwe'll ask twitch chat will kind of come\nback to that and what's the opposite of\njudgment if it comes to you then by all\nmeans go for it but um so let's kind of\ncome back sorry for that it was that\ntangent okay Miguel oh yeah okay you\nknow so I'm gonna try to okay so now\nlet's talk about you\nso tell me a little bit about what's it\nlike to be back at home is the biggest\nthing is is just like the relationship I\nhave with my family's kind of weird I\nguess my brother you're just preface it\nwell I have four brothers they're all\nhave siblings\nokay my father is my mother's second\nhusband okay so it's not really that\nlike impacts much just like I think so\nI'm pretty tight with them still I think\nthe biggest thing that's like different\nat home is like how I interact with my\ndad's like not good there's like a lot\nof resentment I suppose so it makes\ninteracting hard I would say it's kind\nof taxing what do you resent or does\nheroes enter you resent I do I think\nwhat do you resent that's a hard\nquestion to answer\na lot of things I suppose just like was\nthe greatest probably that's like\nwithout you know what a good upbringing\nagainst I guess but can you tell us yeah\nyour upbringing so that's an oncologist\nmy mom stay at home she's like always\ntaken care of like before kids with me\nI'm a dog too and yeah I feel like my\nbraid talk with my dad it was whenever I\ninteract with my dad it's because I did\nsomething wrong or something like that\nso we always end up with like a shouting\nmatch basically interesting can you do\nthis a particular example come to mind\nah yeah I was like think about what I'd\nsay to you like there was one example\nwhere he just like all right I don't\neven remember what I did so I was like\n10 or something maybe give or take\nI did something wrong and then I [ __ ]\nlike I don't know man like I boarded up\nmy door like I threw like a chair in\nfront of it like scared of what he'd\nlike come say to me he like open the\ndoor and you start yelling at me and\nit's just stuff like that just not good\nhuh\nnot good yeah\nso let's try to understand what's not\ngood about that like that I feel like\nwhenever stuff like that came up which\nwasn't necessary you know just like sure\ndiscipline me but relax I guess I don't\nknow what was he doing oh well yeah\nhello oh oh my my body just went out\nsorry what was he doing you say you said\nsure discipline me but relax a little\nbit so what was he doing disciplining\nyou I guess it was a pointers to side\nwith discipline he just like letting\nanger out I guess okay yeah letting\nanger out yeah sounds kind of passive\nyeah it's that's like I like something I\nknow for sure but I suppose Miguel let\nme ask you something what is someone\nfeeling when they close the door and\nstick a chair in front of it fear why\nare they putting a chair in front of it\nwhat is the purpose of that chair\nI guess distance like hoping it doesn't\ncome I guess they're like hoping it\nstops it I got stops it so I that makes\na lot of sense to me I guess I'm looking\nfor a particular word and I'm gonna\ncontinue fishing for it a little bit\nright what is what is that chair doing\nwhat what purpose so when you're a\nten-year-old like and you think about\nwhen you watch TV and people stick\nfurniture in front of doors what's\nusually on the other side Dave\nyeah so what is the purpose of that door\nI mean what's the purpose of the the\nfurniture in front of the door\nprotection absolutely right and like\nwhat do we usually barricade ourselves\nagainst because that's what you were\ndoing yeah I guess I guess I guess that\ndanger yeah but like what kinds of\nthings do you see on TV\nsponsors zombies and stuff like that\nabsolutely so I want you to just think\nabout this for a second right so I want\nyou to imagine a 10 year old and how\nmuch that 10 year old be feeling for him\nto do something like barricade his\ndoorway really scared really scared\nbecause what's on the other side is\ndanger yeah in a monster yeah I mean is\nthat how it felt to you yeah definitely\nwhat was that like\nI don't know just scared I guess I don't\nknow how else to put it\nwhat's it like growing up with a monster\nat home not good in what way just I just\ndon't feel safe I guess mm-hmm is that\nhow you feel now maybe the song stop not\nthe exact same way as a kid it's it's\ngot better here and there Walt\nit's like I intentionally put a lot of\ndistance myself mm-hmm right so you've\nyou've learned how to put up other kinds\nof barricades\nyeah because chairs behind doors don't\nwork so what are the barricades that you\nput up oh I don't think my girlfriend\nnotice is it's like I interact with them\nit's just like oh I just turned off I\ndon't know it's like an emotional wall I\nguess go monotone it's like try not to\ninteract like as little as possible\nstuff like that okay so generally\nspeaking when we do things like that\nthose are adaptive so what when you when\nyou so you've learned how to not\ninteract with him right yeah so what\nhappens when you do interact with him\npretty good yeah I don't I don't know if\nyou really are interacting with him over\nthe past couple of years does that make\nsense yeah there's exactly one time I\nremember like really interacting with\nthem tell me about that\nso around Christmastime my parents like\nfiled for a divorce they didn't end up\ngoing through with it but I was like a\nlot of certainty my mom kind of like set\nmy dad away so\nwell I was a lot of us for another\npressure he's gonna like set Christmas a\nwhile I guess I just felt really bad so\none got dinner with them I kinda just\nlike you know it's like hunker down feel\nlike okay I'm gonna have a real\nconversation you know I try my best\nit was pretty good hunkering down to\nhave a real conversation sounds pretty\nbad huh yeah what sounds bad about it\nyou should heed to hunker down a real\nconversation why did you have to hunker\ndown my relationship with them which is\nwhat like I have to protect myself again\nstill I suppose absolutely right I mean\nI might like I sort of are you feeling\nlike I'm spoon feeding you don't get it\nbut I mean do what how much does this\nresonate with you Oh resonates for sure\nit's like yeah right so like we need to\nbe because it's so easy I guess yeah so\nI think I think what I'm hearing from\nyou Miguel is that you have a lot of\nfeelings and you don't know how to put\nwords to the feelings and so what I'm\nreally spoon feeding you is the language\nby asking you leading questions but I\nthink to me\nyou know like basically and I I imagine\npeople watching like when I think about\na 10 year old who literally has to\nbarricade in himself inside his room\nfrom his father yeah that's like that\ntells us everything that we need to know\nyou know the rest of it is just defining\nterms but that image I think was\nbeautiful and I mean it was a terrifying\nimage but it was a well-crafted image in\nterms of it captures a lot about the way\nthat you felt and like what you know\nwhat your home situation was like can I\nask a little bit about the you know\npossible divorce yeah why do you think\nthey were getting divorced\nwell I was at the time but apparently\nhe's had like a massive argument about I\ndon't really know honey maybe but yeah\nthere's you want like more details like\naround the relationship or their\nrelationship rather if you're\ncomfortable sharing them ah I give what\nI can honestly I\nI never really knew how they were\ntogether it's like always felt like\noutward appearances you know and then\nthey would always like yellow each other\nlike dad would like threatened with\ndivorce or something when I was like\nright here about that was like 14 or\nsomething like that\nyeah I don't have too much else to say I\nalways do it was like kind of unstable\nbut never to back huh okay what what\nwould they fight about\nthere's always start with like really\nstupid small stuff and then both of them\nare like pretty stubborn so they're just\nescalating escalating never giving it up\nand that yeah it'd reach points where\nit's like I guess what's good for ya\nblah blah blah blah it's like yeah hmm\nlike it wasn't even real stuff they're\narguing about and you said that you said\nsomething along the lines if you don't\nknow how they ended up together\noh I'm not sure I quite I didn't say\nthat but okay so maybe interpreting so\nhelp me understand that a little bit why\nare you but what you know for a child of\nparents who thinks that there's got to\nbe some reason that you believe that so\ncan you help me understand a little bit\nabout you know what you think about them\nis so incompatible peppers I guess\nI mean I've asked like both of them\nabout how it happens they both gave me\npretty different answers but I think\nyeah was not like their temperaments are\nboth like pretty short they're both like\njust different people I guess how did\nthey how did they tell you about what\nwere their answers in terms of why they\ngot together well my mom said something\none of the lines of like so she said\nlike my dad also like didn't really have\nparents growing up like his dad died at\nan early age he was at an early age\nand his mom was like always is working\nworking okay so she said that it was so\nhe could finally have a family that he\ncould like cuz my mom where he had the\nkids at this point and my dad said that\nthey accidentally had me so they just\ngot married so Wow yeah huh\nwhat do you think about that I mean I'd\nlike to believe my mom's interpretation\nmore but I guess it's the realistic part\nof me I guess it maybe knows is a harsh\nword but like those my dad's probably is\nthe real version mm-hmm you know\nsometimes I think it's interesting which\nversion we define is realistic yeah so\nit's it's you know Miguel I see you\nsmiling a lot but I'm wondering if\nyou're feeling some kind of heart\ntalking about these things yeah it's\nkind of weird to revisit all this what\nhurts\nfamily situation just passed but the\nbest I guess I just always overlooked it\nthat sounds a little bit unperson 'el to\nme Miguel I mean you know pardon me for\nonce again hypothesizing but you know\nthe struggle that I have is in terms of\nlike I don't want to bias you but at the\nsame time you know I think it's hard to\ndo this kind of exploration at your age\nso I mean I'm just gonna just say this\nfor a second like you know how how would\nsomeone feel if they learned from their\ndad that the reason their parents got\nmarried is because they were an accident\ndefinitely not good in what way what\nwould they feel squatchin everything I\nguess like what you know like my parents\nreally loved me yes absolutely yeah how\ndoes it feel to say that I was pretty\nhard to say I think I've kind of thought\nabout that like you know passier I guess\nmy dad my parents were like talking\nabout divorce and stuff my dad actually\nsaid something I like really caught me\noff guard um we always used to say like\nI like you to each other\nI've been getting my dad and I was just\nthought of as a joke it was like yeah I\nnever wanted to say I love you to be you\nto me and I just had no idea to process\nthat and I still know mm-hmm does it\nhurt when he says that to you\nwould witnesses what like when he said\nthat to you I guess maybe I was like\ndistance at the time so it didn't really\nbut yeah so when thinking about it I was\ndistanced right that's the barricade and\nso that's why we put up the barricade\nbecause as long as the barricade is\nthere the monster doesn't get to come\ninto the room when did he say that to\nyou he said that like probably a year\nago a couple months like March now so I\nthink probably wrong to summer around\nthe time that they had the divorce and\nalso around the time that you guys had\nthat real conversation yeah and and can\nyou tell us about the conversation well\nthat was like the Coxon that I suppose\nbut that's what he was also like you\nknow I wanna start right worth like our\nrelationship he said like wanted to\nstart trying more yeah yeah and like\ngive you love I suppose like he's\nfollowed that with I love you all so how\ndid that make you feel\nI was just also got so I guess it's\nnothing so me go I'm gonna ask you\nanother question okay when someone says\nI never wanted to say I love you that's\nwhat your dad's words were right\nalong those lines so let's just let's\nactually like examine that statement for\na moment what does that statement mean\nprobably didn't love me I guess\ninteresting so I'm gonna ask you to\nre-examine that right yeah okay so can I\njust think for a second Miguel yeah\nso we've come a far away from motivation\nschedules waking up in the morning and\neating meals haven't we yeah\n[Music]\nso I'm gonna I wanted to ask you a\ncouple of questions but instead I think\nI'm gonna make a few statements and then\nI'm gonna give you a choice because I\ndon't want to lead you somewhere that\nyou don't want to go yeah so I think\nthat you don't know whether your father\nloves you or not and and I don't know if\nyou want to know the answer to that\nquestion I don't know if you're prepared\nto know the answer to that question yeah\nso now we have we have an interesting\nchoice right so like the problem is that\nyou don't know what's on the other side\nof the door it could be a monster it may\nnot be a monster\nyeah the challenge is that in order for\nyou to know the answer to that question\nyou have to take the chair away from the\ndoor and you have to unlock it and you\nhave to open it the real scary thing is\nthat you don't know what's gonna walk\nthrough yeah so we're not going to\nassume that it isn't in a monster and\nwe're not going to assume that your dad\ndoes love you although I do believe he\ndoes but in order for you to let him\nlove you you also have to let him not\nlove you and I don't know if you're\nready for that so it means that you have\nto let him in and then like like right\nnow you have walls up which is why when\nhe says certain things to you you're\nprotected from them yeah but in order to\nlike really you know you don't know if\nit's a fluffy teddy bear on the other\nside or if it's a monster but like\nopening yourself up to one is opening\nyourself up to the other does that make\nsense like you've got a being vulnerable\nbecause right now when he tells you he\nloves you like what what are those words\nlike do to you\nhonestly they either make you feel\nhotter they're like exactly right so if\nwe think about they do nothing to you\nthat's because your walls are up like\nand you know they can't you know in law\nthere's that area where you you know the\nenemies can't walk into\nso like you know your walls are up so\nthey can't enter the thing is you don't\nso in order for those words in order for\nyou to feel do you want to feel loved by\nyour dad just feels like I don't care\nlike either way excellent insight right\nso this is exactly what I'm saying this\nis why I'm instead of asking you a\nthousand questions I'm just telling you\nit's the first thing that I'm\nhypothesizing to you is that you know in\norder to feel loved by your dad you have\nto care about what he feels and I want\nyou to just notice this because this is\nimportant sometimes we choose not to\ncare about stuff because if I don't care\nabout something then it can't hurt me\nbut the other problem is that like if I\ndon't care about it I can't feel joy\nfrom it either yeah so right now you\nhave this barricade which is that you\ndon't care whether he loves you or not\nbecause and that protects you from him\nnot loving you but it also prevents you\nfrom feeling loved by him and as a\nresult of not caring I think you sort of\nend up with something down the road that\nmutates over time into resentment does\nthat make sense so now we have kind of a\nchoice Miguel do you want to and you\nreally don't have to say one thing or\nanother it's not like forget about like\nthis is actually your choice okay I\ndon't want you to say something I don't\nwant you to do something because we're\ntalking twitch or whatever do you want\nto try to explore what bringing the\nwalls down is like or not exactly I'm\nwith you\nhonestly part of me doesn't part of me\ndoesn't there part of me doesn't part of\nyou doesn't good so I tell me about\nthose two parts this is one part that\nlike knows he's trying to be better and\nlike wants to encourage that I guess but\nthere's also the other part that's\nthere's just a lot too I don't know how\nto explain it\nyeah tell me what that part is saying\nhe's hurt you so much just like it's\nbetter you just like try to work on the\nother parts of being at home try to like\nget back to where you were\njust ignore it mm-hmm which way which\npart do you want to listen to today\nhonestly the the part that doesn't want\nto good for you yeah good for you I want\nto come out for a while just what\ndecisions were those do I want a lot of\nthat yeah yeah like I said then hi part\nof me wants to but it's just so hard\nwhat do you resent him for haha a whole\nhot I guess it's hard to pinpoint mm-hmm\ncan I can I give it a shot sure do you\nresent him for putting you in in this\nsituation in the first place I never\nthought of that but yeah definitely I\ncouldn't have to think like this yep how\ndoes it feel to have to think like this\nyeah my apartment doing what I want to\ndo I have to deal with this garbage it's\nhard right do you do you hate him for\nmaking you feel this way really hard\nlike I definitely did hard for a lot of\nlike hatred towards them especially I\nwas like a bit you up here and maybe\nit's not for putting me in this\nsituation but it's there what did you\nhate him for just like oh my god and\nwhat is he\nmy dad I don't know I'm gonna think for\nanother second okay yeah I get water\nyeah of course\noh twitch chat what are we gonna do with\nMiguel what are we gonna do\njust got to make sure the door is locked\ncurious what did you do with the door uh\nI'm speaking outside see you fan yeah\nthere is a rear last time I like a\nserious talk like if the house was with\nlike my dad we're talking about like the\ndivorce mom was just like around the\ncorner listen again no I guess I saw on\nhave you heard by them right now yeah\nwhat do you think would happen if you\nwere heard by them have to deal with it\nI guess\nwithout what would you have to deal with\nwhat do you think would happen what are\nyou afraid of why don't we you why don't\nyou want them to know what you're saying\nright now cuz like I don't even know\nlike precisely how to feel so how am I\ngonna like vocalizes of that what I'm\nfeeling\nwhy do you have to vocalize to them and\nin a clear way what you're feeling just\nlike help with what I'm saying I guess\nlike how Ponder's that what do you want\nthem to understand\nI feel this way that it's like tearing\nme up almost what are you feeling\nthat's hard to say from a physical size\njust like something in my chest\nwhat's in your chest happiness I suppose\ntightness or heaviness yeah tightness\ntightness yeah\nokay so Miguel I'm gonna go ahead and\nask you a couple of questions okay\nokay so I want to come back to the\nstatement that your dad said that I\ndidn't want to tell you that I loved you\nright yeah so and you're interpreting\nthat as he doesn't love you not exactly\nI think yeah so earlier I think when I\nasked you about that you said yeah sort\nof the way that you felt is that he\ndidn't love you when I was I think when\nI was younger like and he would say like\nstuff like I like you stuff like that\nhe didn't that maybe that's like I'm\nsure but now like I think he does that\nmakes it a lot harder to what makes it\nwhy does that make it harder how does\nthat make it hurt to have the\nrelationship I know he's like trying I\nknow that he like you know he wants to\nchange I'm just like not helping that I\nguess hmm should you be doing something\ndifferent\nI don't know there's the [ __ ] that I\nguess very good is that how you feel\ncuz when you say I'm not helping yet\nthat sounds pretty judgmental to me yeah\nthere's stuff yeah I think about this\ntoo it's like part of me that definitely\nwants to like you know help partner also\nchange the relationship it's part of the\nreason why I'm here you then but at the\nsame time just like why do I even need\nto try what's the point\nso you don't need to try I don't need to\nnow let's let's understand that very\nclearly right so yeah a lot of times the\ndecisions that we make in life the ways\nthat we approach life are based on this\npart of us that is like pissed off like\nhave you have you read or seen Twilight\nthe first movie as I read it though okay\nso I too have not read it I think I've\nseen maybe movies one three and four\nokay\nand in those movies that I think at one\npoint there's like you know there's the\nwe're wolf versus vampire thing in the\nlog but at some point I think she has a\nkid and then does okay yeah sorry for\nspoilers I guess and and then I think\nsomething weird happens I don't know\nexactly what happens but then you know\nso if you guys need to tune out you know\ny'all shouldn't do now but at some point\nyou know the the we're wolf dude\nactually becomes like sort of this\nprotector for her kid okay and and this\npart of you that that wants to that\nwants you to stay away from your dad and\ndoesn't want you to try and doesn't\nthink that you need to try I kind of\nalmost view as a protective we're wolf\ndoes that sort of make sense like it's\nlike strong and angry and terrifying but\nalso is like really looking out for you\nand you can count on it yeah like it's\nyou've got this like psychological like\nwe're wolf Guardian who just kind of\nfollows you around is gonna just [ __ ]\n[ __ ] up if it tries to hurt you sounds\npretty cool and but thing is it's kind\nof stupid like it's kind of stupid right\nit just knows it's like it's gonna it's\nlike reactionary it's not nuanced it\ndoesn't you know sip tea with its pinky\nup it you know it I don't know how else\nto describe it like it's not very\npsychologically minded it's it's it's a\nbeast\nit's beast eale and so I think you don't\nhave to you can listen to that thing\nbecause\nthis is what you've had to do so I want\nyou to kind of think a little bit about\nthis and let me know if this sort of\nmakes sense or doesn't make sense but\nI'm envisioning you as a kid in a couple\nof experiences happened that that we're\nwolf in your mind starts to grow and\nover time huh 100 percent there's like\none that comes divine tell us about it I\nforget is it start from something stupid\nagain but like yeah my dad started\nyelling at me like puff my chest up to\nme or something I was so angry and like\nyeah I puff tit back like I squared off\nlike about to fight him or something\nlike that\nof course I back down because I'm like\nnot about to hit my dad but yeah how old\nwere you this was 16 maybe give or take\na year mm-hmm you said you weren't about\nto hit your dad was he about to hit you\nI don't think so he was definitely\npoised like it though he had the thought\nin his mind to him sounds kind of scary\nhuh yeah and so you had to learn how to\nprotect yourself so part of your your\npsyche sort of developed to this like\nprotective mechanism and it sort of came\nout it sounds like it was actually\npretty well developed at that point yeah\nwhen do you think do you remember when\ndo you remember times when you were\nyounger where it started where you\nstarted off being scared and then you\nsort of found this like core or nugget\nof like hatred and anger yeah tell me\nabout it I mean so specific time I could\nthink of but remember like after\nargument or something with them\nyou're like he yelled at me I'd like sit\nin my room just like hitting a pillow or\nsomething like that just like really\nangry yeah and how did you were you\nangry while he was yelling at you it was\nlike boiling over I guess boiling over\nwhen like toward the middle towards the\nend like his but like some points like I\ndon't need to take this you know yep so\nI just want you to notice that like\nanger is born out of hatred I mean sorry\nborn out of hurt right and and so that\nanger kind of arises and it protects you\nso anger is also a protective mechanism\nthat we use\nto Purdue to shield us from other more\nhurtful emotions yeah so when I get\nrejected by a girl it hurts and then I'm\nlike she's a [ __ ] [ __ ]\nYeah right so I think you know Miguel we\nhave a choice here so I think it still\nkind of comes down to I mean first of\nall it's like a no-brainer to me why\nyou're homesick for being away from home\nyeah you know cuz when you come back\ninto this house all of these things\nwhich you've managed to barricade away\nor like more difficult to barricade\nbecause you have a somatic memory you\nhave a memory within your body of these\ntimes and these feelings you basically\nlike you know you may get diagnosed with\nPTSD if you go and see enough\npsychiatrists because what you're I mean\nI I don't know if it's PTSD actually\nisn't the right you may not get\ndiagnosed with that but you're it's\nclearly been traumatic you know like the\nother way you know we kind of think\nabout triggers or flashbacks so now that\nyou're at home all of these emotions are\narising and your mind is not clean and\nfocused the way that it used to because\nall this [ __ ] is floating around now I\ndo have a belief I think your dad does\nlove you and I interpret the I wanted to\ntell you I love you in a different way\nyeah what I interpret so I for example\nMiguel if I like someone and I say I I\nwanted to tell you how pretty you are\nyeah what does that mean about what I\nthink about their attractiveness you\ndefinitely think they're pretty yep yeah\nwhy didn't they say it scared I guess\nsomething gets in the way yeah right\nand what I'm hearing from your dad's\nstatement is your dad doesn't say I\ndon't love you he says I wanted to say\nsomething to you but I didn't know how\nor it was too hard yeah\nwhat do you think about that definitely\nmake sense\nI think like really thinking back to the\nconversation it's like he's still saying\nlike you know well instead of saying I\nlove you saying I like I like you just\nfeel like a positive emotion it's so\nlike probably more there yeah so there's\na huge difference between I love you and\nI like you though right right so you\nlove where I mean I don't know why I\nkeep on using romantic analogies but I\nthink they're more accessible yeah so\nyou know if if your girlfriend tells you\nshe loves you and then you respond with\nI like you boy are you [ __ ] right I'm\nsorry\nyou can say I'll be like to the is like\ncontrary you can all I get you know\nfalse to say like I like you you know as\na thing also absolutely my point is that\nthose mean different things\nyeah yeah right and it's like it's\napples and oranges it's not like you\nknow and and for you to hear I like you\nis also a very important absence of you\nhearing I love you yeah like I mean I\nlike all kinds of things yeah you know\nbut I I also love all kinds of things\ntoo but there's a it's night and day\nyeah and so Miguel in in your case you\nknow I I still you know so you feel like\nyour dad does love you and I don't think\nthat that's defensive so sometimes\npeople feel like their dads like you\nknow the people who are important them\nand should love them love that they feel\nthat they want to believe that they're\ntheir parents love them do you think\nthat you actually genuinely believe that\nyou're your dad loves you or do you\nthink that that's just you like holding\non to like childlike hope I believe that\nyeah so then the question is why why why\ndo I believe that like I said he's like\nmaking changes to try and change and\nlike show that he loves me more\nyeah so I think in other ways even\nthough he didn't say the words I think\nalso when you were growing up there were\nprobably some things that he did that\nmade you feel loved\nyeah can you tell us about those I\nremember there I guess like one of the\nbetter memories I have with my dad was\nlike you know geocaching sort of no it's\nlike we you go to like a location or a\nspot and then like this app gives you\ntips on how to find the treasure there\noh yeah right okay I remember like doing\nthat with them and that was really nice\nlike fun and I don't know he didn't even\nsay like I love you or anything during\nthat but it's just like whoa\nI mean I guess the easy word is loved\nbut yeah probably more do it can I give\nyou another one\nmmm did he make you feel wanted yeah\nlike he valued you being there and he\nvalued your time together yeah for sure\nuh I though it's just like yeah it's a\nfew and far between yeah III wasn't\ntrying to be silent for to be awkward I\njust didn't know how to follow that off\nokay trying to get more out of here no\nno that's why I was like oh [ __ ] he\nthinks that there's more to know it's\njust like I literally don't I don't\nalways you know sometimes it takes me a\nsecond to process - yeah I'm just trying\nto think about so let's pause for a\nsecond okay since we don't know where to\ngo so tell me know what are we talking\nabout today man\nI mean this was the big thing I just\nwant to know like what do I do while I'm\nhere because realistically I just I\ncan't just go back so how do i what do\nyou mean what what is the big thing\nlet's start there just like my\nrelationship with my dad and what have\nwe done with that sport it a little more\nunderstand it like at least a little\nbetter and what do you understand about\nit now that maybe you didn't before um\nthat there's like more conflict in me\nother nights than I know there is I\nthink there is there's like okay take\nyour time\nyou don't have to make sense by the way\nright we can help you with that that's\nwhat we're doing it's just the choice is\nthere whether I want to or not I guess\nis the big thing yep if somewhere down\nthe line I'm like maybe more mature or\nsomething like that and I decide like\nyou know I'm at a place where I can\nfinally go through with this then it'll\nalways be there hopefully I guess maybe\nnot always but the choice will be there\nyep yeah so I and yeah I think so thanks\nfor recapping let me just kind of tell\nyou what I heard so the first thing is\nthat you know I think you've been numb\nto a lot of your thoughts and feelings\nabout your dad and you've also been\nconflicted and I think\ntimes some of that can some of those\nconflicting feelings bubble up like I do\ngenuinely believe that there is a part\nof you that but is afraid that your dad\ndoes not love you there's an older part\nof you that feels like he really does\nlove you but there's a younger part of\nyou that really is not so sure and is\nactually afraid and that the we're wolf\nthe we love doesn't need to really\nprotect 19 year old Miguel so much as it\nneeds to protect 10 year old Miguel and\nI think both of those Miguel's exist\nwithin you yeah in terms of your road\nforward I mean I think to be blunt\nMiguel I think that you have to patch\nthings up with your dad if you want to\nfeel like you're at home at home okay it\ndoesn't mean that you can't be\nfunctional is successful at home but if\nwe think about you being comfortable\nlike what does home mean like home is a\nplace that you you feel comfortable and\nrelaxed and you can be your best self\nand you don't have to like you know have\nto barricade yourself you don't have to\ncheck the door to see if someone is\nlistening you you know you're not you're\nnot at home right now and I think it was\nbeautifully said that you felt homesick\nfor being at school because this is not\nhome for you yeah if you want it to be\nat home for you this kind of goes back\nto like motivation and the downward\nspiral and all that kind of [ __ ]\nis that like as long as your brain is\nyou know spending energy keeping those\nwalls up like just think about this for\na second you got up to get water and\nthere's a subconscious process running\nin your mind that's like let's check the\ndoor yeah there's no way that you can\nlike you can't be motivated because your\nRAM is being taken up by all this crap\nyou know when you wake up in the morning\nthere are feelings of like resentment\nand whatever that have been like stored\nin your room and in this structure for a\nlong time and you're just gonna have to\ndeal with those it's gonna encumber you\nit's almost like you know your your\nhouse is a zone that like is gonna like\nreduce your stats it's like a miasma and\nas long as you're sitting in it you know\nyour damage is gonna be reduced your\nhealth is gonna be reduced well someone\nwas saying the other day that I ran out\nof mana and I think actually man is a\ngreat exam\nfor like cognitive energy the issue here\nis that you're you're like at school you\nknow your mana bar is like max so you\ncan do a lot of things because in each\nthing you do makes it harder for you to\ndo the others but you've got enough mana\nat home really the debuff that you've\ngot as your man is like cut by 50% yeah\nso it's way harder so the question is\nlike what do we do about that so there's\nsome things that you can do to kind of\nyou know buff up your mana bar or maybe\nlike regenerate it throughout the day\nlike you can like we can always talk\nabout like I'll meditate like meditates\nthe session to all of your answers and\nthings like that but but I think at the\nend of the day you know you can't you\ncan do as many band-aids as you want to\nbut I'm a big believer that like the\nroot of the problem is like really where\nthe problem is yeah and you can't\nthere's no you can adapt for the miasma\nthat you're in but ultimately like the\nreal thing that you that your real\nanswer lies and like fixing this [ __ ]\nyeah and I'm sorry to say that but\nthat's just what I believe you know yeah\nI mean that's just how we are I don't\nknow that I don't know that we I mean\nthere's still definitely more things we\ncould talk about but that's sort of my\nsense what do you think about that I\nmean honestly I feel like deep in I know\nthat - it's just like [ __ ] man\nit sucks what's my call I go so like\nback to the pro thing I felt like I was\nin a really good spot I was finally like\nhitting the goals I wanted to and then I\nfeel like I just got like [ __ ] robbed\nor something like came back home I'm\njust not playing well I just don't have\nwhat I had and I want to do something\ntotal and a half the dudes really all\nright yeah so can I say something that\nis potentially cliche and inspiring of\ncourse so I I think I think this is you\nwatch anime course I do come on so you\nknow you're you're not in your Super\nSaiyan form yet yeah how do you get to\nbe a Super Saiyan\nit was anger I think sure like if you\nthink about like you know you think\nabout like you know people who are you\nknow you think about how you like\nattained your final form it's not just\nthrough training right it's through like\na conflict and dealing with your inner\ndemons yeah and I I do believe that for\nyou to be the best if you actually want\nto be successful at all I think the best\nway to do it is to I mean like take your\nfavorite movie scene where you know you\nhave this conflict with your parents and\nthen you're on your final match you're\ndown like two out it's a best-of-five\nand you're down two and you look into\nthe audience and you see your dad there\nand he's cheering for you yeah like and\nthen you go back and you win the next\nthree yeah yeah and so I think the very\nthing that holds you back is gonna turn\nyou into the person that you need to be\nto really be successful okay and I'll\ntake that to heart and I think that this\nis gamez way of giving you that\nopportunity right so you were on a\nparticular track and life and this is\nwhere you don't have to believe in this\nstuff is just the way that I\nconceptualize things because I find it\nhelpful and life is giving you this\nopportunity to take something that\nyou've sort of because the thing is even\nat school and stuff it's still like\noccupying like it's still like debuffing\nyour man a little bit and if you don't\nreally want to be successful at law like\nyou can't be at anything less than a\nhundred percent yeah yeah I think about\nsatire time yeah and and so right now\nlike the problem is in your face and I\nthink sometimes life like you try to run\naway from things and I think life sort\nof says ah and when life says that's the\ntime for you to step up and I think\nyou'll be I mean because of this entire\ntime you've been trying to play lul and\nyou haven't been your perfect self yeah\nand you can't ever be your perfect self\nuntil this thing is settled and just\nimagine how motivating it would be in\nthe morning if you wake up in the\nmorning you see your dad he says good\nmorning Miguel I love you like how would\nyour day change drastically on the\ncontrary it's like I remember I woke up\none morning I was like started\nmeditating and he like walked in the\nmiddle of it I got so bad like I didn't\ndirect it towards them I was just like\noh it's not next time I was just like\nafter like the rest of day I'm just like\ntilted there you go yeah right so so\nunderstand that they whatever tilts you\ntakes energy right the problem is that\nright now that that energy is like\npointed in the tilting direction instead\nof the inspiring direction yeah and and\nwhat you I think what you really need to\ndo is like shift that around we're not\ntalking about creating or destroying\nbecause you can't create or destroy\nenergy you cannot create or destroy the\nenergy of the mind all you can do is\nredirect it and shape it and that you\ncan do through Rican sexualizing right\nyou can change I wanted to tell you I\nlove you at one point you interpret it\nis I love you but I mean sorry he didn't\nlove you and then you can reinterpret\nthat is that I've always loved you and\nI've always had difficulty telling you\nthat okay now I think the challenge here\nis I don't know what you exactly you do\nabout this because I don't know how\nready your dad is yeah we're presuming\nthat the only person that needs to be\nready here is you the other thing that\nthey taught me when I was training to\nbecome a psychiatrist was that it's the\nparent that they don't talk about that's\nactually the problem really right so\nyeah I mean you know I think that in any\nsituations with parents like this\nthere's also there tends to sometimes be\nkind of like this actually I'm gonna ask\nyou what do you think about that um I\nmean I have my like I I definitely have\nmy like fit to deal with my mom still\nbut it's not sure it's probably it's uh\nhow would you say oh I'm D buffing me of\nit but it's something not as bad I did\ndo you have any resentment towards your\nmom for letting your dad create this\nlife for you\nI wouldn't say so I never really thought\nabout it like that but there's something\nthere there's some resentment yeah so I\nthink oftentimes that's a piece of it\nright so you have the the dad who did\nthis to you and then you have your mom\nwho watched it happen yeah and she also\nhad a daughter more a responsibility to\nlike protect you from this or because\nall really like Miguel the really sad\nthing about this is this is actually not\nyour responsibility right that's what's\nreally kind of and that makes sense to\nme that you're resentful because\ngenerally speaking kids are not the ones\nwho respect responsible for like moving\na relationship forward with their\nparents that changes as we start to\nbecome adults but it's really your dad's\njob and he hasn't done a very good job\nit sounds like yeah it's like I guess\nthe way I see it though is like he's\nprobably in a silver spot when he was a\nkid so he just doesn't know what to do\nyeah and I think that's a wonderful way\nto start building a conversation with\nhim so I think that's really good for a\ncouple of reasons like do you feel like\nyou could have a conversation with him\nabout what his upbringing was like like\nhow so do like just back in like like\nhow do you feel about having a\nconversation with him about dad what was\nit like growing up for you I mean yeah\nfairly if I guess through the word again\nif I hunkered down yeah I could okay is\nthere my senses that you have to hunker\ndown less to have that conversation than\nto have a conversation about him and you\nyeah definitely so I think that's where\nyou can start because it has nothing to\ndo like these so the we're wolf doesn't\nnecessarily have to wake up in that\nconversation now you're you still have\nto hunker down because you're gonna\nhunker down any time you talk to your\ndad sounds like yeah but to have some\nkind of space that allows you guys to\nconnect and also for you to like not\nhave to deal with the biggest problem in\nthe room like we're not going straight\nto the raid boss we're starting with\nlike you know cleaning out the trash\nmobs yeah yeah how do you feel about\nhaving a conversation with\nlike would you be interested in that I\nmean yeah it's like feel like a\nnecessity almost at this point what\nfeels like a necessity to you I mean\nthis is sounds like this is like kind of\ncold what this is another way I've been\nthinking about is just like he's like\npaying for my university he's like you\nknow paying for the house I live in like\nthe food supplies like I I'm almost like\nfeel like I shouldn't be allowed to just\nlike cut him off and be like alright\nwhatever deal with this ever what work\ndid yous cut him off should oh god yeah\nright so that's your judgment so I think\nthere's a difference between a VA you\nwon't watch dreams and stuff before you\nnew dog yeah so you know what Hodder ma\nmeans mm-hmm so I think that there's\nself judgment and there's a dharma so\nthose are two different things\nyeah so I do believe that you have a\nduty and responsibility as a son to try\nto repair your relationship with your\ndad but I think is duty is greater so I\nthink if you want to repair your\nrelationship because that's that like\nthat he's longing for a relationship\nwith you and you guys have seen you know\nyou've started like you've seen some\nkind of signs of life there I think you\nshould you should write because I think\nit is your daughter ma to try to nurture\nthat when you're ready and when you're\nable although I don't you know I don't\nexpect you to do it at the age of 19\nyeah and but it's reasonable I think\nthat you that responsibility is\nappropriate for you to bear and and also\nlike you know it's also his Dharma to\nprovide for you because he's your dad\nyeah that's what he gives you and then\nwhen he's old and infirm you provide for\nhim how old is your dad by the way he's\nlike\nseventy okay so that's also a something\nthat's very very tricky right okay\nbecause you guys have such a wide age\ngap that developmentally it's very hard\nfor him to make a change so it sounds\nlike he had you at the age of 51 yeah\nso people tend that was the first time\nhe had a child yeah so like being a\nparent is very very hard it's a very\nsteep learning curve and generally\nspeaking the older you are the more\ndifficult it gets so when you're really\nyoung gets hard when you're really old\nlike just the way that your brain works\nlike it's hard to learn new things so we\ntend to get set in our ways it's not\nthat you can't teach an old dog new\ntricks\nbut that there's a very real\nneuroplasticity issue involved with like\nlearning and changing behavior so you\ncan teach a two-year-old new languages\nlike that it gets harder when you're\nfifteen gets even harder when you're\nthirty\nprobably evens out around there but\nthere's some things about developing a\nchild where like your brain just changes\nlike it's [ __ ] weird I used to be\nable to watch scary movies and like I\ncried maybe once every five to ten years\nand now I try like five times a week\nit's just weird I started noticing\nemotions that I didn't have and I think\nit's literally because like you have to\nlike your brain changes when you have a\nchild that's so in your data and how old\nwas your mom when you were born or how\nold is she now she's like six 60-ish now\nokay forty yeah okay so I think that's\nkind of tricky I think there are a lot\nof other dynamics that could go on like\nlike or your how old are your siblings\nthey're all like 30 ish yeah so so\nthat's some of this stuff unfortunately\nMiguel like you kind of got dealt a\nlittle bit of a shorthand in life in\nterms of like you know it's hard to be\nso your sense of loneliness growing up\nwith siblings who are way older and also\nparents who are farther in age can be\ntricky yeah\nI mean unlike the top of a long one s is\njust like kind of got used to it I guess\nI'm like really introverted but like I\ncan go out of it when I want to yeah so\nlisten man I I don't know exactly what\nI'm trying to tell you but I think that\nwhat I mean to say is that I I think\nthat there are reasons that have nothing\nto do with who you are\nabout why it was difficult for you to\nform a relationship with your dad now\nsome of those things I think are on him\nbut in the sense you guys have the deck\nstacked against you because yeah you\nknow by the time you were 10 he was 60\nyeah so like it's hard to like you know\na lot of the things that fathers and\nsons do may have actually just been\nphysically hard for him at that point I\ndon't know what kind of shame is I'm\npretty bad actually know pretty good\nphysical everyday yeah so so I mean\nthat's good but like when I just think\nabout you know the kinds of things that\nI do with my kids like I noticed a\ndifference between I had my first kid at\nthe age of 31 to 32 and I could just\nmanhandle her physically in a way that\neven now at like 37 it's like harder for\nme to do with my younger kid like I just\nit's weird it's like kind of scary but\nso so I I think um you know in your case\nI think it's a little bit tricky because\nyou guys do have an age gap that's not\nyour fault that's not his fault\nyeah and but I still think you know I I\ndon't think you can get around this man\nI think we can talk as much as you want\nto about waking up on time and setting\nyour alarm and meditating and setting\nall these strategies and behaviors and\natomic habits and all this kind of crap\nyeah I mean I think you've got to become\nyour best version of yourself and I\ndon't think you can do that as long as\nthis is hanging over your head\nI guess yeah I'll take I'll take the\nfirst step at least because I don't want\nthis over my head obviously yeah what\ndoes that first step look like to you um\njust like saying down and talking like\nthat like you said like how his\nchildhood was like maybe just like more\nabout him I don't know more much about\nhim general feels like yeah and\nso there's this chance that could\nbackfire it backfires shoot me a DM\nbecause I don't okay hang in okay and\nyou know you're welcome to come back on\nstream you know a couple weeks down the\nroad or something like that or I mean it\nreally if the conversation ends up\nscrewing you over in some way and you\nfeel like you've you know started a\nticking time bomb please let me know and\nI'd love to help you through that sounds\nfantastic thank you so much dr. kay yeah\nof course man any thoughts or questions\nbefore we wrap up um no those want to\nstake it out\nwe should meditate I've gotten about it\neh yeah okay what kind of meditation do\nyou do um I'm so kind of a bomb I just\nlike guided meditation on YouTube or\nsomething like that I started reading a\nlittle bit more but a little bit\njudgmental there yeah you're all wrong\nyeah right so that's okay so Miguel you\ngot it you got to start where you are\nman you can't expect to be somewhere\nsomewhere else like you're you're you're\nat school you're at home I mean I\nlearned to meditate I meditate the way\nthat I do because I learned at an ashram\nlike I got to stay in India for three\nmonths and we usually didn't have that\nopportunity so guided meditation on\nYouTube I think is quite respectable let\nme just think what are we gonna teach\nyou\nlet me think\nhave you done naughty should be before\nthe the alternate nostril breathing I\ndon't think so okay so let's teach you\nthat let's start there um so I want you\nto sit up straight okay okay you have\nallergies or a deviated septum or\nanything any of that stuff going on okay\nnow what part of the world are you in by\nthe way uh Midwest okay oh yes okay does\nyour dad still work\nno he's retired okay we just think about\nthis so I'm gonna teach you something\ncalled alternate nostril breathing so\ncan you do this what is that\nyeah ah yep\nso index finger down wait index finger\ndown okay yep very good excellent good\njob and take care so what we're gonna do\nis we're gonna use our thumb to block\nthis nostril and we're gonna breathe in\nthrough that one then we're gonna use\nthese two fingers to block the other and\nwe're gonna breathe okay so what I'm\ngonna do it's a little bit weird this or\nblock your right nostril\nbreathe in switch and breathe out\nbreathe in again through the same\nnostril switch out\nswitch now\nin\nswitch out\nin\nswitch out\nin\nswitch out now close your eyes raise up\nyour head a little bit sit up nice and\nstraight good and now continue at your\nown pace remember that you breathe out\nand then breathe in through the same\nnostril before switching that you should\nswitch with a full breath\ngo ahead and finish the round that\nyou're on let your eyes remain closed\nand sit in the stores\nand now from this place Miguel start to\nthink through some of the things that\nwe've talked about today notice within\nyourself your fear notice within\nyourself the fear of being unwanted the\nfear of being unloved and also notice\nwithin yourself the instinctual\nknowledge that you are loved that\nsometimes these things conflict so be it\nnotice the burden you've been carrying\nsometimes it manifests as a heaviness or\ntightness in your chest\nand notice that you can to certain agree\nfree yourself of that burden in moments\nlike this that there is a real Miguel a\ntrue Miguel a pure version of you who's\na little bit distant from and separate\nfrom all of your fears and worries and\nalso your joys and ambitions\nand if you need to in the days ahead as\nyou struggle with motivation or\nscheduling or things like that try to\ncome back to this place because from\nthis place things can get a little bit\neasier you can see them a little bit\nclearer and you can understand them a\nlittle bit better and it's easier to act\nfrom here\ngive yourself the opportunity to come\nback here from time to time and now come\nback to Miguel you're in the Midwest\nyour eyes are open can I share one last\nthought with you Miguel\nI don't think you can actually wait to\nhave this conversation now you were\nsaying earlier that you have lots of\ntime and you can deal with it later I\ndon't think so\nyou may not have as much time as you\nthink\nand also you should not having as much\ntime as you think I want you to think\nabout this you know that you should also\ngive yourself the time to live and exist\nwithin the relationship with your dad\nthat you want it's not about fixing\nthings up and then checking off a box\nit's about checking off that box and\nthen having time to live in that space\nwhether it be days weeks months years or\neven decades\nokay yeah yeah of course man\nwhat we're rooting for all righty\nno no man\nwe love to complicate our lives don't we\nwe love to think about habits and\nmotivation and willpower and discipline\nand all this all this stuff\nsometimes I think unfortunately the\nthings that hold us back are simple and\ndifficult it's not really complicated so\nI want you guys to understand this the\nmind thrives in complicated things the\nmind loves complicated equations right\nbecause and the more you complicate the\nequation the easier it is for the mind\nto avoid that which it wants to avoid if\nyou think about this for a second if a\ngroup project goes wrong whose fault is\nit even if it's your fault\nit's very easy to assign blame to others\nit's way harder to avoid blame yourself\nif it's a solo project and so different\nvariables of the mind are opportunities\nfor the mind to avoid looking at the\nthings that doesn't want to look at and\nso be careful because the more you\ncomplicate the things in your life the\nless likely you are to actually move\nforward I mean that's sort of a false\nstatement because I think a lot of you\nknow a lot of progress in life can be\nmade by optimizing different variables\nbut generally speaking I see a lot of\navoidance carried out through the\ncomplexities of the mind yeah so just\nthink about that so think about you know\nwhen you're struggling in life how many\nanswers do you come up with oh why\ndidn't you finish the project on time oh\nI was late and there was traffic and and\nI had to call the doctor and my dog\nneeded this all excuses right the more\nexcuses that you give the more likely\nthey are to bbs so the more variables\njust think about this when someone when\nyou ask someone when someone doesn't do\na good job what makes you what sets off\nyour BS meter when they say they didn't\ndo a good job for one reason or when\nthey did they said they didn't do a good\njob for five reasons oh it was this\nconfluence of events the microwave\nwasn't working and then I hit traffic\nand then this happened and this happened\nin this habit that's why I'm late I'm so\nsorry right so that's what your mind\ndoes it gives you lots and lots of\nreasons oh the reason you aren't\nsuccessful is because of this and this\nand this\nand this and this and this or what it\ndoes is it oversimplifies things because\nthen it doesn't have to examine the\nopposite is true if someone comes in and\nthey say like oh why were you late and\nthey're like ah I don't know\nzero reasons or five reasons same thing\nall bs why aren't you successful oh I'm\nlazy yeah\nbs not satisfactory right so don't let\nyour mind get away with zero reasons and\ndon't let it get away with five reasons\ntry to find V thing and understand that\nyour compass for finding what's holding\nyou back\nis that the real compass is that it's in\nthe opposite direction of where your\ncompass points so if your point if\nyou're if your mind goes one way what\nyou need to do is look in the opposite\nway you need to head south whether your\ncompass is pointing north that's where\nyou'll find the answers mm-hmm I'm\nwatching this instead of doing my\nhomework okay so now do your homework\nbecause we're done for the day right\nlet's think about anybody have a\nsuggestion for who we should raid"
