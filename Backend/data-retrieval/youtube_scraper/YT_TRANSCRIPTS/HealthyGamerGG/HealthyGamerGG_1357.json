    "transcript": "hey Paul hey how are you let me just\nactually see if can you guys hear Paul\nis he quiet he sounds quite to me say\nsomething Paul mm I shouldn't be hello\nhey hey man hey welcome back thank you\nyeah I wasn't sure if I there would be a\nnext time but there is a next time yeah\num yeah I I mean a lot of people don't\nknow if there's gonna be next time we\nactually don't know I don't know if\nthere's gonna be a next time\nno I kind of got the sense you don't\nknow who's coming on to like an hour\nbefore yeah that's exactly how it works\nyeah and there was there was some talk\nabout whether I should prepare for this\nand I concluded I after thinking about\nit I thought that preparing for it is\nprobably a bad idea\nright have you been doing you know\nthings are mostly the same yeah I can\nimagine I mean oh this is what that's\nwhat you expected on well I mean because\nlike you know so I you know I think the\nirony here is we were talking about you\nyou know starting to date again or\ninteracting with other people and things\nlike that you know and so I was just\nkind of thinking about you know\nirrespective of whether you were\ntransformed and had become a new person\nit's like basically impossible for you\nto have a girlfriend today not because\nyou haven't been transformed but because\nof the coronavirus and probably\neverything is like here in the UK things\nhave been pretty active there but I\ndon't think that that's really been the\nmain reason I haven't got a girlfriend\nI'm perfectly honest it might certainly\nslow things down\nmaybe but I don't think I was on that\nlike fast track anyway but I don't think\nyou were either I think it's an\nunreasonable expectation yeah yeah so\ntell me about tell me about last time we\ntalked like what how was that for you\n[Music]\nI did I did reflecting right so good you\nknow it's definitely there's definitely\nadvantages to the fact that it's\nrecorded because I was you can watch it\nas much as you want I don't I think I\ndid that more than like once maybe twice\nprobably once and then like with busy\nclips thrown in there but um one thing\nthat occurred to me is that I was a bad\npatient the last time why so let me\nexplain this a little bit so I honestly\ncoming on a second time my anxiety about\nit is not anywhere near as bad as it was\nthe first time the last time I had a\ndouble anxiety I had the anxiety about\ncoming on and publicly exposing my four\nballs and potentially saying something I\nguess I still have that to a lesser\ndegree because I mean I could say\nsomething and I might forever regret who\nknows hopefully not so that's well\nlesser degree and then the thing that I\nstill have this time as well is like the\nanxiety of getting the most out of our\nlimited time together because the first\ntime I came on I I didn't know there'd\nbe a second time and this is the second\ntime I'm coming out I don't know there's\ngonna be a third time so it there's a\nhuge anxiety about like wanting to make\nthe most of every moment right because\nyou don't know how many of these moments\nyou're gonna get and it feels like very\nprecious time and that was part of what\n[ __ ] me up so much last time coz and\nsomeone in twitch chat actually said it\nsomeone someone was really switched on\nhe said this didn't go the way this got\nthat that guy expected it to at all and\nhe's absolutely right\nso part of that anxiety manifests itself\nin me having like a bunch of\nconversations with you before I ever met\nyou which is incredibly\ncounterproductive but it's sort of just\na product of the anxiety like I can't I\ncan't stop it it just hurts so in what\nI'm trying to say is in my effort to try\nand keep things on track I actually\nended up doing the opposite because I\ndidn't know what the right track even\nlooks like you did but I didn't and I\nwas trying to keep us on track and in so\ndoing was [ __ ] it all up so I just\nhope that this time I can be a better\nlike patient what makes you think I have\nany idea what track were supposed to go\non and what if you done then we're both\nlost together yeah no but if your claim\nis that you can\nfix me then where am I going with that\nwell it was it figs I guess I was just\nto help me I guess it wasn't a fix\nnecessarily but then then but\nlet's say your claim is that you can\nhelp me I would think that you would\nthen house my claim isn't even that I\ncan't help you\nwasn't it not I thought it was my claim\nwas that that I I think I can help you\nok the claim is also that I'm gonna try\nto help you but there's a big difference\nbetween I think I can do something I can\ndo something and I'm gonna try to do\nsomething and I can do something alright\nI guess the Devils in the details in no\nit's it's it I mean that's not the devil\nthat's the essence of it right so like\nthere's a big difference between having\nan expectation of what I'm capable of\nand trying like there's a big difference\nbetween trying and having an expectation\nall right so just so that I'm clear I\nthink you did fine last time for that\nwhat it's worth yeah well divided\nopinion on that one I guess but in any\ncase I'm still gonna try to do better\nthis time by not trying to like\noversteer things okay I mean you\nexpressed frustration in in being in a\nloop last time or something sure though\nis it okay for me to be frustrated Carly\nwith the philosophical question it's not\na philosophical question I'm not asking\nyou frustrated intuitively you imagine\nthe frustration as a negative thing an\nexact one that's how ask me because I\ndon't want to just start with our\nintuitive conclusions I want us to\nunderstand whether we want to accept\nwhat our intuition tells us beautifully\npoint at all I would like us to have a\nwonderful time together without the\nfrustration okay\nthat's not what I'm looking for here\nokay so I don't think that I'm I do this\nto have a wonderful time if I wanted to\nhave a wonderful time I'd make myself a\ncup of tea and I'd play Jedi Knight or\nJedi fallen order that's what I do what\nI want to have a wonderful time where\nI'd take a bath\nsome eucalyptus and something else AB\nsome salts that I purchased at the\ngrocery store today and I would just\nchill\nso amendable time to figure it out yeah\nabsolutely\nand so let's just think a little bit is\nit okay for me to get frustrated in a\nconversation with you since you're\nasking me I guess it is you know the\naverage person doesn't doesn't even ask\nthat I I just assumed that if they're\nfrustrated and I tend to be an Imagine\nI'm probably right most the time that if\nsomeone is frustrated while talking to\nme I've done a bad job of conversing\nwith that person or at least you know\nespecially if I didn't defuse it or\nespecially if I continue to exacerbate\nit I don't know III I envy the\nconversations you have with like some of\nthe other guests that have been on where\nyou tell them how much you enjoy the\nconversation and I didn't get that from\nyou I got from you was that you were\nfrustrated with me at one point and that\nfeels bad that feels like I didn't do as\nwell as they did or something okay good\nso let's let's understand this okay so I\nmean I wish I had another screen so I\ncould ask to a chat some questions right\nso twitch at you guys see what we're\nrunning across right this is Paul st.\nPaul we met last week right so Paul is\nself judgmental Paul compares himself to\nothers so like let's just pay attention\nto that okay let's also talk a little\nbit about frustration because I think\nactually this is this is fantastic man\nso I think that um Paul it is part of\nwhat I think is holding you back is your\ndesire to create and control the\nresponses of people around you okay\nright so you looked at our laughs and by\nthe way I loved our conversation last\ntime okay I think I think our\nconversation last time was I frustrated\nfor chunks of it absolutely but let's\njust we're gonna talk a little bit about\nwhat it means to be frustrated and and\nwhy I think that that's perfectly\nacceptable and in fact and we're gonna\ntalk so let me just make a note about\nthat okay we're going to talk about\nfrustration but I just want to point out\nto you that I think that you said that\nyou\na thousand conversations in your head\nwith me before so that gets me Paul what\nwe're in those conversations what were\nwe wearing were we in your living room\nor the locality this sort of nebulous I\ndon't exactly recall I'm trolling you\nman so but I think so we should talk\nabout frustration but I just want to\npoint out to you that already as you\nenter this conversation you have this\nidea that you want me to react a certain\nway and you're looking for a certain\nresponse no no no no I wouldn't ever go\nthat far okay I guess I just had some\npresuppositions about the kinds of\nthings we would talk about or need to\ntalk about in order to figure out how do\ni well I guess I'm honestly fixed me\nagain I like that term\nsure okay so what do we talk about\nprobably wrong I don't know but you said\nyou had some preset positions oh well\nyeah but actually so actually that was\nquite a if we don't have to talk about\nthat sort of thing I'd rather not\nbecause some of those things are quite\nactually quite difficult to talk about\nso it seemed like we didn't really need\nto the last time was actually quite\nlight despite the fact that I ended up\ndoing a joke or impression towards the\nend of it the majority of the discussion\nwas quite light and easy yeah so what\nmakes okay so now I'm a little bit well\nyou can I just think for a second yeah\nnow you have me curious about the things\nthat are difficult to talk about well\nmaybe I should never have mentioned and\nI'm also wondering a little I mean so\nthis is so when let me just figure out\nhow to say this and make sense\nso frustration and difficulty is part of\nthe process of growth\nand I think one of the biggest problem\nthat problems that people fall into is\nthat they try to avoid those things\nright so like generally speaking human\nbeings try to avoid negative emotions\nbut it's my hypothesis and sincere\nbelief that like negative emotions are a\npart of life and also a part of the\nprocess of like growth and being like a\nnormal human being so just because you\nwere frustrating to me the last time we\ntalked doesn't mean that I wasn't happy\nwith the conversation like I get\nfrustrated with my kids all the time it\ndoesn't mean that I don't love them and\nthat I don't interact with them and that\nI don't value our time together\nI actually don't wish for a\nfrustration-free life with them as\nbizarre as that sounds\nbecause it's something strange like like\nwith my kids I find that the more\nfrustrated I get with them the more I\nlove them after they fall asleep it's\nkind of a weird sensation but I think\nthat there's like you know there's\nthere's light and there's darkness and\nthere's like you know there are two\nsides of a coin it is completely fine I\nmean the people who I know who live\nlives that are relatively pain free are\nnot the happiest people I know so I\nthink it's perfectly fine for me to get\nfrustrated I think the question is did\nwe accomplish what we set out to do and\nif frustration is part of the price we\npay so be it okay well yeah so I mean we\ngot the actually done if you can see\nthis but I I put a pearl on my wall can\nyou see that what does it say oh they\ngonna get it the pearl\nwhat's which pearl so did we did we set\nout to become what we set out to do well\nI got I got the pearl to put on my wall\nright mm-hmm\nyou can you read that now yeah I have a\nvery protective hopelessness absolutely\nthere it is there it is so we got that\nout of it yeah\nright and then there was also the you\nknow the catharsis or whatever at the\nend which I still don't understand what\nwhat that was you are giving me both so\nI guess where we left up where we left\nit is you told me to notice it and\nawareness precedes control so you know\nI'm sort of trying to keep in mind that\nthat have this protective hopelessness\nas you call it and actually try to\nnotice it so that I'm you know so I went\nto the speed-dating that the following\nweek and I well even before that even so\neven the day after we just when I went\nto the market to get some bread like\nsome girl is serving me and I'm not\ntrying to date her or anything I'm not\ntrying anything at all but ordinarily I\nwould tend to approach it with a sort of\nvery sort of glum look but actually for\nsome reason I just thought of something\nbefore I even opened my mouth and I\nsmiled at her instead and I don't know I\njust feel like I mean she Tom so this\nit's kind of stupid but I just feel like\nmaybe that made the interaction a little\nbetter certainly then obviously I mean\nshe you know she gave me the option to\nhave like a half bread instead of buying\nbuying the whole one if I just which was\nactually I took her up on that offer cuz\nactually I'm a bachelor I don't need a\nwhole hyung get through the whole damn\nthing so I save a bit of money I feel\nlike she might have not even given me\nthe up that option if you thought she\nwas dealing with someone like you know\nwho was withdrawn and already wanna have\na conversation about anything yeah so\nwho knows you know you can't rewind time\nand try it again but I just feel like in\ngeneral and and but the way that the\nweird thing about is like why do I do\nthat why did I what I definitely didn't\nsomething came over me and that in that\nmoment but I think feel like it's kind\nof one-off now though it was something\nthat was with me like right after our\nconversation that's faded to them\nprobably because of the speed dating\nthough so I had the positivity for like\nthe next four or five days but then I\nhad the speed dating and what before we\nget to the speed dating tell me about\nthe positivity we got to talk about\nsmiling by the way do you smile when you\ntalk to people\nyeah no normally no yeah so you got to\nstart\nsmiley smiling his [ __ ] Opie\nlike smiling is like so when I was I\nread this book by Dale Carnegie called\nhow to win friends and influence people\nit's a fantastic book and one of the\nrules that he says is smile and so I\nactually practiced smiling and I know it\nsounds kind of silly but then I found\nthat you know practicing smiling is\nsuper awkward but what I could do is\nlike think about something that made me\nhappy and then I would just let myself\nsmile even though it felt a little bit\nweird that's really what I practiced and\nthen it becomes a genuine smile and I\nfound that ever since I started smiling\nI actually do get better everything\neverywhere yeah I go that I go that\nsense that it would be but the thing is\nI mean intuitively makes sense to but\nthe thing is is getting the genuine\nsmile is the hard part\nyeah because forcing it forcing it\ndoesn't really it's not really\nmaintainable right so let's practice see\nthere you go good job hoping I'll be\nhonest meeting the quality on this court\ntoday is not the best like I can't make\nout your mouth but your eyes are just\npixels for me I don't know if it's like\nthat on the street but maybe maybe it's\nreally oh really low quality interests\nlike almost like oh yeah that's like a\nmillion times better okay there we go\nsee dr. K it's not a Boomer after all I\nlearned thanks I'm glad I mentioned it\ncuz I thought it'd be awkward if I\nbrought it up but no you fixed in that\nah see so what were you doing you\nthought it would be awkward if you\nbrought it up what were you trying to\navoid there well a couple of things one\nof those wasting time on in technical\nissues when we need to be getting on\nwith the fixing me part yeah let's just\nstay focused no no but but see see this\nis the thing there's there's you know we\ndon't need to stay focused because\nyou're avoidance of the awkwardness\nwould have worsened your experience over\nthe next hour it's actually doing it\nagain anyway now I don't know why it's\nit's reverting so okay let's try again\nyou feel like this is a waste of time\nright well unless you know unless it\nimproves for the long term yeah yes like\nright now yeah I'm so right now it's\ncrystal clear and I have\nokay so let's see what yeah if it does\nwhat it did again degrades over the next\n60 seconds okay then how do you feel is\nit mine is it fine the other way that's\nwhy I'm I can see you fine okay yeah\nokay\nso they saw something so yeah I think\nyou should smile so try smiling\ndon't you feel embarrassed\nsmile come on\nlet's see alright so think about\nsomething that's something genuine\nspecify yeah like let's let's see if\nlike you guys I want you guys to pay\nattention so like I want you to think\nabout something happy what's happy okay\nthen just look at my face ready your\nface is a good face so I like your face\nI like your face too man see that's all\nit takes just just okay now close your\neyes close your eyes just think about my\n[ __ ] face let's see there that's\nthink about how silly and crazy I am oh\nthose are good adjectives okay what can\nyou think of like you have a pet not\nanymore\nokay well that's the sad sad face see\nthere's a there you go\nokay good so it's beautiful right so\nthose are real smiles now open your eyes\nso you can play around with it I know it\nsounds weird but but the the key to\nmaking a genuine smile and by the way\nhuman beings are very good at detecting\nfake smiles and so this is like what's\nreally hard about when you tell people\nto smile in interactions is they try to\nthey try to force themselves to smile\nwhich becomes a vague smile and then the\nfeedback that you got from other people\nis weird because they like look at your\nweird-ass smile and it creeps them out\nand then it makes you feel even more\nawkward which in turn makes it harder\nfor you to smile and then you have to\nforce your smile more\nand it creeps people out of them even\nmore so the the key to offering a\ngenuine smile is to like try to find\nsomething that you find warm or positive\nand think about that for a second and\nlet it bubble up and let it show in your\nface and if you start smiling more of\npeople that are gonna start smiling at\nyou back and then you're you know\nservice will improve but you'll also\nfeel better about yourself because we\nhave these tiny little circuits in our\nbrain that when people smile at us we\nfeel better about ourselves because like\nwhen I smile at you like an idiot ready\nyeah no yeah yeah it works how do you\nfeel at this point is getting a bit\ncreepy\nokay I don't know we like delay at the\npoint a little bit okay analyzing over\nanalyzing it's kind of the end of it all\nright it works the first few times\nthough okay good how do you feel when\nyou laugh and smile a little bit what do\nyou notice about yourself anything it's\nkind of hard really no okay okay maybe\nwe can we can shift off of smiling for a\nsecond so tell me about the positivity\nthe positivity of you were saying that\nthe positivity lasts four or five days\nwhat what do you mean by that how do we\nunderstand what that what that is\noh it's optimism I guess I don't know\nit's just it's just I've been searching\nfor like the answer for some years now\nat least like at least a decade yeah and\nyou gave me something new to try so\nthat's optimism because most people I\nasked about it you know friends want to\nhelp you but friends can only help you\nso much they can only you know help you\nbased on what they know and what their\nexperience is like and often that's not\nas helpful as they wish it was yep and\nbut you gave me something genuinely new\nto try you didn't really give me a lot\nof direction it was just like catch the\nhope I mean when you say catch normally\nI cup my hands like this right but\nthat's not what the kind that's not what\nyou mean by cash yeah but I don't know\nhow to do what you're asking me to do\nyou didn't really give a lot of\ndirection on that we kind of wrapped up\nright as you as you concluded yeah with\nthat though it's even though I'm\noptimistic about it it's kind of hard to\nrun with it okay so let's see if we can\ncorrect that deficiency from last time\nso when I say catch the the optimism I\nremember watching some martial arts\nmovie where a guy would catch a fly with\nchopsticks so it's like a fly buzzing\naround like he's like with his his ninja\nspeed he would catch it with chopsticks\nthat's kind of what I mean so what I\nwant you to do is notice within yourself\nwhen the hopelessness arises and if I\ncatch it what I mean is there gonna be\ntimes where you're going to interact\nlike let's take the case of smiling get\nthe person at the checkout counter when\nyou bought the bread you're gonna have a\nthought that like oh let me try smiling\nand then there's gonna be another part\nof you that says no that's just dumb\nit's not gonna do anything you know what\nI'm talking about\nwell I never thought about smiling it\njust happened\nI don't really know why okay no but\ndon't get me right off like oh I should\nsmile here I wasn't trying to do I just\ncaught that I just thought about how\nhopeless something is I don't know so so\nI I know I didn't even think about it\nmade me smile yes so I don't know what\nyou did but you did it you did what I\nasked you to do and it's a little bit\ndifferent for every person well twist\nnot exactly because actually you ask me\nmore literally you ask me to laugh\nalright I never got quite that far like\nsmiling is about as far as I go okay\nfine I know that I necessarily know that\nI would necessarily want to be walking\naround laughing people why not maybe\ncome on don't ask me such rhetorical\nquestions what it's not rhetorical\nbecause you okay come on because you'd\nlook insane wouldn't you so what's the\ndamn is not not insane\nwell presumably that's the adverse\neffect you want people to receive you\nwell not like as a crazy person\nwhoa see there and I think lies the crux\nof your problem you want people to\nreceive you a particular way\nwell so I think it's very common but\nlike so this goes back to like you were\nyou were a little bit upset I don't know\nwhat word to use that you felt like you\nfrustrated me because I did get\nfrustrated and you wanted me to not be\nfrustrated right you wanted me to say\nPaul I've really enjoyed this\nconversation but instead I said Paul\nthis conversation has been frustrating\nso in your mind you are trying to\ncontrol my reaction well not even that\nit was even worse because it's not like\nyou concluded with that it's just you\nwere so frustrated that you just said\nthat you were frustrated it's it's like\nit's even worse\nbut what's bad about me being frustrated\nyeah okay no no so we sort of talked\nabout it but let's let's just play the\ntape through to the end right so this is\nexactly what we need to do I think your\nproblem Paul is that you have some\nbeliefs that you think are common-sense\nor rhetorical which actually need to be\nchallenged because if you challenge\nbecause that's the default programming\nyou have in your mind so what's wrong\nwith frustrating me well that what's\nwrong with it is you might end up having\nmore sympathy for cbt guy than for me by\nthe end of it it did that happen no yeah\nbut who knows by the end of this session\nright so so your fear of frustration is\nthat I will like us yeah look at my face\nfor a minute do I dislike you Paul this\nmoment in time I would think not okay do\nyou think I mean but why not you\nfrustrated me last time yeah so\nobviously it's not excessive for you but\nif I'm on the wrong path and I keep\ndoing the same miss making the same\nmistake then I know then what is gonna\nhappen what do you think is gonna happen\nand she'll not want to know me we're\nokay where do you get that idea\nI mean and and I mean this is just in\ngeneral but it's just like with people\nin general and on someone away from\nthrough your behavior I think I Drive\nmost people away through my behavior do\nyou remember like a particular a\nparticular time where no sort of really\nreally like like so we touched on this\nbriefly like last time like I told you\nlike I had a rough start in my\nprofessional career I lost so I never\nworked anywhere for like a whole year I\ncould I could maybe hold down a few\nmonths at a time and then people would\njust get sick of me and I would I'd be\nlike go what why would they get sick of\nyou just because they thought I had very\npoor social skills is what how they\nwould term it they didn't usually get\nvery specific in ways that would\nactually be genuinely useful to me as a\nself development tool but that's the\ngist of it and that's all I got was the\ngist of it hmm so it sounds like you had\ngood reason to believe that your actions\nand your words and your mannerisms will\ndrive people away yeah the only reason\nthat I can string more than a few months\ntogether now is because I really tried\nharder to do better at that and all must\nbe working yeah oh yeah I'm cognizant of\nit so a lot as you guideline so I think\nthat you know Paul I think you have been\nworking at it and I think the\nunfortunate thing is that people don't\nteach us social skills so I've been like\nI've been sort of tossing around so I've\nbeen writing a couple of books and I was\nthinking about I had this crazy idea and\nstarted jotting some notes that I want\nto write a small manual about\nconversation and just how to talk to\nother people you know I get a lot of\npeople call it common sense but a common\nsense is not always know it's not common\nsense right so I think no one actually\nteaches us I mean I don't think it's\ncommon sense at all\nso the way that I talk to people is\nactually unlearning\ncommon sense so I think being good at\nconversation is not actually doing what\nmost people do conversation is a skill\nthat you can learn and you can practice\nsocial skills can be\nand practiced and leveled up and it\nsounds like you've been a little bit\nmore thoughtful about your social\ninteractions and you're noticing a\ndifference yeah and and yeah yeah and\ndespite that I still do worse than the\naverage person at it but yeah yeah we\ncan progress\nso let me ask you this award there\npeople before you started working that\nyou kind of drove away through your\nbehavior\nyeah I guess so\nMike ooh that's a tough one\nlike I guess even my friends to be\nhonest like I can you sure do you mind\nsharing that with us yeah there's not\nmuch to say about it like so in high\nschool I had friends but but after high\nschool was over we all went our separate\nways wouldn't really keep in touch so\nit's kind of like kind of it's kind of\nlike the same in work you know you're\nall colleagues but the and they'll\ncelebrate your arrival and they'll\ncelebrate your leaving but as soon as\nyou leave you won't hear from them mo\nand again it's all just it's all just\nit's almost like it's just fake you know\nyeah I mean it's it it's fine well it's\nwhat is convenient while you're just you\nput in the same vicinity as each other\nbut it's not very real sounds like they\ndon't really care about you as a human\nbeing they care about you as like the\nmantle worker right yeah yeah at work\nfor sure but there's a big difference\nthough between like so I do think that\nthe high school friends I had were\nfairly all though I don't know why that\nis because obviously the end effect is\nthe same it's like well as soon as we're\nno longer together I think they're their\ndifferences right so in high school we\ndon't no one teaches us how to stay in\ntouch with people that we care about\nwhile we're in high school that too is a\nskill that's learned how to stay in\ntouch with someone that you care about\nwere you were you attracted to any girls\nor anything like that\noh the world that weren't any so in the\narea that in the area that in the area\nthat I grew up we have comprehensive and\ngrammar schools and all that means it's\nlike they easy to get into schools in\nthe heart to get in schools like so so\nthe grammar schools you usually have to\nlike pass it a bunch of extra tests and\nstuff to get into and they're generally\nregarded as like the better place to be\nif you're like above if you're\nintelligent I guess but\nalso single-sex schools mmm because I\nguess the thinking is that you know you\ncan focus better on your work if you're\nnot distracted by the opposite sex so\nit's the same for the so there was an\nold guy school as an all-girls school\nand their grammar schools and that miles\napart and I sometimes wonder I sometimes\nwonder if that's something I should\nregret because my sister didn't go to\nthe grammar schools my sister went to\nthe to the comprehensive and she grew up\nwith guys and girls like normal and\nshe's she's doing it well she's got to\nshe's got a second kid and she's two\nyears younger than me she's on a normal\ntrack right he says she's not an insult\nso you feel bad\noh that's things I mean that's exactly\nit\nI feel like it's a weird really weird\nplace it's like it's almost like I would\nI regret not being able to just do it\nall again or or you just like I almost\nfeel like I want to start from that\npoint like from the high school point\nwhich is which is which is very a very\ndangerous thing to say when you're 35\nyears old but but but you know I I don't\nexactly mean it that way it's just that\nwhen I get I regret I regret that you\ncan't make up for lost time like that's\nnot something you can do because so\neveryone in everyone in my age range now\nlike if you're looking at people I\nactually can date girls are like in\ntheir 30s are looking to settle down\nthey're not looking for like someone\nwho's got no experience that's that's a\nturn-off for them they don't it's not\nhow do you know that how do I know it\nI guess I just picked up I don't know\nexactly I guess I'm I just picked it up\nfrom here and there so so I'm gonna say\nsomething that is gonna be you know\ncould be hurtful it's not intended to be\nhurtful but it is intended to be\nchallenging you know if you haven't\nreally dated much how do you know what\ngirls want I mean does anyone know what\ngirls wanna know that's that's what I've\nbeen trying to figure out for a long\ntime well all I know is that it is\nwhatever it is it's not me that - how do\nyou know that\nwell that's evident how no one wants me\nit's really evident with I feel like I\nhave been over a bunch of things already\nlike I did like a dozen speed-dating\nthings that did a bunch of talking about\nhanging out in bars and going clubbing\nand doing this and that yeah so so so I\ndon't know Paul they ever actually meet\nyou\nI think they meet the person that you\nthink you should be I think I think I\nthink they meet the person that you\nthink that they're looking for and I\nthink I don't I don't know what they're\nlooking for though but sure you do you\njust said you just told us what they're\nlooking for right so you have an idea of\nwhat they're looking for and I think you\ntry to be that person and I think what\nthey're seeing is essentially fake smile\nPaul instead of real smile Paul and they\nfind that creepy which I I mean great\nfake smile Paul creeps me out even when\nI smile excessively at you it creeps you\nout I think this goes back to what I was\nsaying earlier about like you try to\navoid so much to like evoke any kind of\nnegative emotion and another human being\nthat you're like that's not you can't be\nrelaxed and authentic like if you walk\ninto this conversation you're like oh I\ncan't frustrate dr. K because I want him\nto like me I understand why you feel\nthat way\nand you can't make me like you and even\nif you frustrate me like that's not\ngonna stop me from liking you what's\ngonna stop me from liking you is if you\nbecome if you stop giving a [ __ ] and\nstop trying like you can piss me off\nthat's okay you can make me sad you can\nmake me disappoint it you can you can\neven make me angry with you and all of\nthose things I know this sounds\nabsolutely crazy but like just think\nabout this for a second like who do you\nthink are the people that you get the\nmost angry with in life who do you think\nI get the most angry with in life like\nyou have this assumption that if people\nget angry with you they're no longer\ngoing to like you right I think you\ndiminish your chances yeah yeah so who\ndo you think I get the most angry with\nin life if I had to guess I'd probably\nsay the people here around the most like\nmaybe your kids or your wife I'm\nabsolutely absolutely correct\nthe people who pissed me off to no end\nare number one my wife top of the list\nnumber two arguably higher than my wife\nis my younger child older child has just\nreally really awesome\nlike sweet little child is really sweet\ntoo she's just super hard-headed and is\ndefiant and doesn't accept that I am the\nparent and she is the child and it\npisses me off to know it but if I guess\non my part though because I don't have\nany experience of yes very good you\ndon't have any experience about what\npeople want what people don't want my\npoint is that if you actually look at\nrelationships and you think about you\nask a hundred people who pisses you off\nthe most I don't know what they're gonna\nsay but if you actually observe who they\nexpress their anger to it's usually a\npeople that are closest to that\nsometimes it's kind of sad because we\ngive the worst versions of ourselves to\nthe people that were closest to and we\ngive the best versions of ourselves to\nstrangers right you're going to be the\nmost polite to the the person at the\ncheckout counter whereas you'll be you\nknow more demanding of like people that\nyou live with\nwhich is weird like shouldn't it be the\nopposite but it's not so I think you've\nreally got to take a step back and think\na little bit about you know I think fake\nsmile and real smile is really a good\nanalogy of the way that you try it so I\nthe way that you interact with other\npeople seems to me to be based on an\nimpression that you have of what they\nwant and I think the way to find a good\npartner in life is to be you and let\nthem pick like it's not you picking them\nit's them picking you but like be\nauthentic about who you are I don't know\nif that's true it may be if you're\ntrying to if you're trying to convince\nme of that on a subconscious level then\nI would probably find it hard to deny\nbut if you think I go around trying to\nbe a model of someone I have in my head\nthat's definitely case I don't think it\nis quite as conscious as that but I do\nthink that you are very normal you are\nvery very concerned about the opinions\nof others in your interactions you know\nthat's that's correct yeah and the more\nconcerned you are about the opinions of\nothers the less authentic you become\nthough by also be treated yeah so I and\nI think this comes from this core belief\nthat you have that you are not likeable\nby others right so like this comes back\nto this decentralize you know well not\nnot without putting a lot of effort into\nyeah yeah okay and the thing is I don't\nI don't disagree that you have evidence\nto support that view I think you do have\nevidence to support that view I don't\nthink you're a dumb guy I think you're a\nsmart guy so I think your conclusions\nthat you come to have a lot of evidence\nbehind them and I'm telling you to run a\ndifferent experiment right I'm telling\nyou that whatever you did that day at\nthe checkout counter where you were able\nto smile at someone and somehow that was\nrelated to hopelessness you don't really\nknow how it works but that you decided\nto just in that moment be a slightly\ndifferent person and the world received\nyou in a slightly different way yeah\nwell what's the experiment we're running\nthough I think I think you should try to\nbe you if if I'm honest has never really\nbeen a moment it and we prior to this\nwhere I thought I wasn't being me okay\nexcellent observation right so now the\ncase is quite a revelation so so now\nyeah I mean that's why I think you're\nstuck so now we want you to just so now\nwe come to a little bit of observation\nwe can talk about a couple of other\nthings okay so like I've got to ask you\nso I don't know if this is I've got to\nask you Paul and also we should you know\nask twitch chat to like if you want to\nhave another kind of cathartic moment we\nthis is not the direction to go do you\nwant one of those I don't know what's up\nin the script this time do we have to\nclimax with nope I mean I don't know how\nto I don't know I don't know how to\nbring those on but I'm guessing that the\nmore cerebral things are people don't\nget to that but if you want to talk\nabout practicalities we can talk about\nthat but it's gonna be dry and it's\ngonna be less entertaining and it's\ngonna be more helpful so the real\nchallenge about twitch streaming is that\nthere are things that are helpful and\nthere are things that are entertaining\nand there's some that are both and\nthere's some that are neither so if you\nwant to talk about you know the function\nof your mind which is what I really\nthink would be helpful and then we can\ndo that if you want to explore like your\ndifficulties and stuff like that if you\nwant to attack those core beliefs and\ntry to dismantle them that's gonna be a\nlittle bit more emotionally of a roller\ncoaster so we can attack your core\nbeliefs about like you know how you view\nyourself or what we can do is give you\nlike we don't have to do one or the\nother it's just which one we're gonna\nfocus on we can talk to you about how to\nbe more of yourself I love both to be\nhonest but you said you have an opinion\non which won't be more helpful which is\nthe first so let's do that\nokay so are you your mind\nI want I want to say yes even though I\npresume you're coming at it from a\nperspective of no okay so say what you\nbelieve don't don't give me the right\nanswer give me your answer right answer\ndoesn't help anyone give me your answer\nyeah yeah I am my mind yeah okay so like\nlet me ask you something um let me just\nthink about this for a second so if\nsomeone has so so if someone is kind of\nrelaxed and enjoying themselves at a\nparty and if another person is super\nsocially anxious and thinking and\nworrying and thinking lots of thoughts\nabout what other people think which one\nof them do you think both of them are\nequally themselves yes if that's that if\nthat's the way they are okay and let's\ntake the socially anxious persons for a\nsecond and let's put them in an\nenvironment where they're not socially\nanxious so let's say that they're\nplaying like D and D with their friends\nso in both cases they're like eight\npeople around but in one case it's like\nclose friends of theirs in another case\nit's strangers so let's say eight\nstrangers versus eight friends and in\none case one person has a lot of social\nanxiety and their their mind is thinking\nlots of thoughts and in the other one\ntheir mind is kind of just participating\nin the engaging with other people in\nkind of like a more simple way do you\nthink that both of those people are\nequally the same person or do you think\nthat it is a leading question so do you\nthink that the the anxious thoughts kind\nof interfere with like the them being\nthemselves right so I'm actually\noffering a hypothesis as opposed to a\nquestion with that statement so in both\nscenarios it's the same person know that\nI'm asking if like the person s is the\nsame in both scenarios I mean but it is\nthe same guy it's the same guy just two\ndifferent scenarios\nare they this your ask me is the same\nperson this yep like let me put it this\nway if you were to observe the the DND\ninteraction from behind like a two-way\nmirror and if you were to observe the\nparty at interaction from behind a\ntwo-way mirror do you think you would\nget the same sense of who that person is\nor would you say that one observer would\nget to know one liked that person better\nin one scenario as opposed to the other\nI would say that you wouldn't really get\nto know them fully until you observe\nboth okay because they're both facets of\nthat person okay their anxiety and also\nthat comes their comfort\nI completely agree that you would learn\nyou would get a more complete picture so\nbut do you think that one is worth more\nthan the other in terms of like\nunderstanding who that person is I mean\nI can see where you're leading me you're\ntrying to I guess you're trying to say\nthat the person who's comfortable and is\nopen is more being themselves and you\nknow is is out of their shell whereas\neither guy is closed up and and hiding\nthat but yeah do you I mean you can see\nwhere I'm leading you absolutely but do\nyou do you want to go there like do you\nagree with that you know this yeah sure\nokay so I think part of the the reason\nit's hard to agree with that is because\nit implies that the anxiety is kind of\nfalse the anxiety is very real and is a\npart of that person's life but that's\nnot really who they are right the\nanxiety kind of like anxiety is\nsomething that layers on top of you and\nkeeps you from being who you are that's\nmy experience in my hypothesis okay\nright in the same way that depressions\nis not who a person is it layers on top\nof them and keeps them from being\nthemselves anxiety layers on top of you\nand keeps you from being yourself yeah\nokay that makes sense right so like\nI guess the bit that just doesn't isn't\nso clear it's like what is yourself then\nexactly so so that's the question and\nthat's the question we have to answer so\nthe first thing to understand is that we\nare not our mind so our mind is just a\nthinking machine and so in the same way\nlike Paul are you your hand I'm willing\nto it I'm willing to take the whole it\ndidn't really occur to me until I was in\nmy late teens but I'm willing to admit\nthat my body is maybe not me I mean it's\nkind of weird because like a I don't\nthink I'm gonna exist a very long if I\ndon't have my body put sure but your\nbody is not you right there's there's a\nEunice that transcends your body like if\nyou lose a hand do you stop being Paul\nno right\nI mean sure like that's a reality like\nyours life has changed and you may\nchange as a result of it but Paul does\nnot it's not like if you lose an arm you\nlose 20% to Paul like your so Paul and\nin the same way it's not like if your if\nyour mind is if your anxiety goes away\nyou're still you if your anxiety is\nthere you're still you you're just\nburied under the anxiety there's a\nthought yeah this is all the brains in a\njar are also still the person right I\nmean sure you know maybe right so the\npoint the point though is that we have\nsome amount of being or eunice that\ntranscends certainly the body and I am\nhypothesizing and I'm putting forth to\nyou also the mind and if you want to\nunderstand that the best thing that you\ncan do is meditate and and notice parts\nof the mind of the whole mind all of the\nmind right so this is where where\nthere's this idea Yogi's say that we\nwhat we really are is consciousness and\nthat mind is just like the hand it's\nlike a piece of us but that there is\nsomething that exists that is outside of\nmental activity and if you've watched\nstream or if you've meditated before you\nknow sometimes people get to this state\nof mind actually we had a great\non Monday with someone who has tried a\nlot of meditation and like just didn't\n[ __ ] get it because they never\nachieved and no mind state right who's\ndumb oh yeah\nso like if you just look at Dom's face\nlike he got there because he's like oh\nthis is really awesome I loved it\nbecause that's what meditation is and\nit's an experience of self outside of\nyour mind and the problem is that we\ndon't understand that because we don't\nspend a whole lot of time outside of our\nmind\nin fact we spend most of our time inside\nour mind and so we think that that's who\nwe are and so it's kind of like you know\nwe've spent all our life in the water so\nwe don't know what it is to like walk on\nland and it's just we just spend things\nin a particular state so then this goes\nback to you and how are we gonna help\nyou and it's this idea that when you're\nwith someone you have all of these\nthoughts about being a particular person\nright so you don't want to make them\ndislike you so you're careful with what\nyou say you don't want to make them this\nyou don't want to make them that and in\nsome ways that helps you right so it\nimproves some of your social\ninteractions you're more intentional and\nthings like that but it also is not like\ntruly the relaxed and real you and\nsometimes through effort what we\nactually get better at is being the\nrelaxed and real loss so I don't know\nwhich one you're doing but so I think\nthe basic no not right now just I mean\nwhen you're at work for example you said\nthat you've gotten battle with your\nsocial interactions right yeah I I don't\nI don't feel like I've ever been able to\nI used to I used to criticize other\npeople for doing it because it seemed\nlike other people like acts at work\nespecially so outside of London yeah\nright before I came you were about to\nsay you you said I used to criticize\nother people for what yeah so like a lot\nof people have like work personas I\nremember like once jumping in the car\nwith the guy used to work with I used to\nsit next to you and his fiancee who also\nworked there at the moment they were\nwhen we left work and go into that car\nlike\nfor that completely I've never even seen\nhim like this they suddenly became\nthemselves for the first time I even\nwhen he hung around with me at work and\nit was just him and me he still wasn't\nlike that it just he just became\ncompletely not completely completely but\nquite completely different person it was\nshocking to me I was kind of aware it\nwas so it was so thick\nnot just from him but from everyone it\nwas still I could still accept it even\nwithout being able to see the contrast\ncuz I only got to see the contrast in\nthe people who I really obviously got\nclose the question is who are you at\nwork but I thought I was not like them\nand now you can't like telling me that I\nam absolutely but but not only at work\nbut just all the time or something like\nthat yeah I think you were a different\nperson whether you were alone or whether\nyou were with someone that you're you\nknow like speed-dating speed-dating\nsounds [ __ ] awful to me I haven't\nlike never done it but it sounds like\nthere's some of the most artificial\ncontrived inauthentic trash that you can\npossibly do and like right now Paul our\nbiggest problem our biggest and we have\nlots of biggest problems one of the\nbiggest problems that I see in society\nis that we're breeding a culture of\ninauthenticity we're breeding into this\nfull of fake people yep people are\nbecoming more and more fake in social\nmedias making us more and more and more\nfake social media is about showing just\none slice of the pie to the rest of the\nworld and so what happens is the rest of\nthe world looks at one the best slice of\npie that everyone else has and we see\nour whole pie both the beautiful parts\nand the kind of undercooked parts and\nthe parts that sort of collapsed in the\noven and we see everyone else's perfect\npieces of pie and we're breeding a\nculture of inauthenticity we're getting\ndisconnected from who we really are\nand I think that you your interactions\nand social situations are so hell-bent\non controlling because you're afraid of\npeople like leaving that you try really\nhard to not make them leave and then\nlike the the unfortunate thing is like\nthat's a vicious cycle I think the\nreason you feel so stuck is let's just\nplay this through a couple of\nMichael's okay so you're concerned that\npeople are gonna leave so you try really\nhard and the harder you try what happens\nto the quality of your smile the harder\nyou try to smile smile do it so that's\nactually a real one is it yeah well if I\ntold you it's not no it's not okay I\nthought I know I'm curious yeah I was\nyou know I mean this is how I get\nthrough the job interview innit that\nlooked real to me do it again that\nactually looks pretty real but hey this\nis those pixels man okay see there's a\ngood one right and and and so I think I\nthink the more the harder you try the\ngenerally speaking the worse the smile\nlooks and then what happens is it\nreinforces it becomes a self-fulfilling\nprophecy so the harder you try the\ncreepier your smile looks and the more\nthat you drive people away which\nreinforces the idea that you drive\npeople away which makes you try to smile\ntwice as hard yeah most of the most yeah\nright and if you smile twice I mean I\ndid tell you I don't usually try to\nsmile I guess I do with the speed I'm\nusing that as an analogy right so I\nthink you you you be inauthentic you try\nto be the person that they want you to\nbe or that you think they want you to be\nin that in authenticity people detect\nbecause we're good at that and they're\nnot actually interested in you because\nthey don't know you're not a real person\nyour fake smiling them like with your\nwhole being and then what happens is\nlike the more you drive them away the\nmore you double down and the harder you\nhave to try to fake smile the harder you\ntry to fake smile the worse off you you\nthe creepier it becomes and the more you\ndrive people away so this cycle happens\nover and over and over again until it\nbecomes truth in your mind and the truth\nin your mind is that no matter how hard\nyou try people don't like you right and\nin that thing is that that truth is like\nwe're supported by data because you try\nit a little bit and then you tried a lot\nand then you tried like Hercules and\nthen you tried like ten Hercules --is\nand no matter how hard you try the\nresponse is always the same people do\nnot like you you know you know you're\nprobably\nhundred-percent right on that because\none part so I mentioned I went to be\ndating like a dozen times actually got a\ndate out of them\nWendy which which which so out of those\ntwelve of it they were kind of like\nroughly in the same sort of time period\nbut we which if you had to number them 1\nthrough 12 which one do you think I got\nthe data of one yeah it was either one\nor two I don't remember but it was it\nwas towards the start they seemed to get\nharder and harder and I think you're\nthat's why I say you're in the center\nright yeah quite possibly true yeah\nquite possibly true I'll take it so now\nthe question is what do we do about it\nright if you try really really hard to\nget people to like you and and it gets\nthem to not like you what I need you to\ndo is catch that effort catch the effort\ncatch yourself thinking oh if I don't do\nthis they will not confess and instead\nask yourself what do I want to talk to\nthis person about like don't try to talk\nso actually did do that I actually did\ndo that I love speed dating I think some\nof the smiles might have been a little\nfake I don't know okay so tell me about\nthe dating let's talk about that it's\nnot a lot to say but can you tell me\nabout dating in general I mean until\nuntil the last cover the months I hadn't\ndone it for like seven years I put it on\nhold but so I'm not an honoree and I can\nexpert or anything but you just the\ngirls will sit down and you pick a table\naround him and then every four minutes\nyou rotate is that what you're asking\nabout yeah sure and so what was it like\nto go speed dating well this time I took\ncare of the external like you said I'd I\nreally dressed up like what I well I\nguess in this case I was trying to be\nlike what I assumed they want to be like\nso I you know I I don't even like\nwearing like not normally I wear stupid\nfancy colored shirts and stuff I mean\nyeah but I wore plain because that's\nwhat I was advised to do\nyou know the Blazer I just it's been 80\nquid on some new shoes and nothing like\nI would ever normally buy which also\nrecommended by a girl at work so you\nknow they they they I got that took some\nadvice and I dressed myself up in a way\nthat I wouldn't I was comfortable with\nbut would never look like before at all\nsure how did you feel wearing that stuff\nactually felt pretty cool I actually in\na bit also I kind of hated myself as\nwell because I don't because it's not\nreally what I wanted to look like it's\njust what do you want to say and end up\nlooking like everyone else I like to\n[ __ ] I like to look like a clown to\nbe honest I usually wear like ridiculous\nlike allowed colors like they call it\nlike peacocking in like but that's not\nreally what I'm that's not why I don't\nreally know why I just like clothes okay\njust like standing out but also not so\nthat's weird like I mean I like I'm not\nI'm not I'm kind of an introvert\nobviously and I don't have I'm also\nisolated a lot of the time really really\ncome into my own with his Korona things\nI'm already an expert in self isolation\num well what do you mean by you liked\nyeah but I mean but it's not like just\nwearing bright colors just makes you it\nlike people could want to come and talk\nto you anything it doesn't really change\nanything it just changes how you\nperceive probably but it doesn't why do\nyou like wearing bright colors I don't\nknow probably cause I just like bright\ncolors on yeah right so I think I think\nright there is a difference one is you\ndoing what you think the world wants and\none is doing what you want yeah of\ncourse but I but I you know so I do\nthink it's worth exploring I'm not\nsaying that just be you know don't\nchange as a human being and don't\nexplore other wardrobes like I think if\nyou're in the dating scene it makes\nsense to like try to present your best\nself right so I don't think you should\nbe inauthentic but I think that you\nshould be as polished as you can\npossibly be\nyeah I was I was looking pretty polished\nyeah so I think that like a nice blazer\nand a nice pair of shoes is great but if\nyou want to wear like a more flamboyant\nshirt then by all means go for it\nyou know I don't know if you tell me to\nbe myself then I guess I would do but I\ndon't know that it wouldn't net me any\nokay so hold on for a second real goons\nbecause now can we can we acknowledge\nthat you're not actually being yourself\nwhen like do you acknowledge that or do\nyou still think that you're being\nyourself when you go out and date I\nthink I am I thought I was okay but at\nleast in when it comes to clothing it\nsounds like you're not I don't even like\nI don't know I don't even know the whole\nreason I even wear the stupid stuff I\nwear now is because it was originally a\nrecommendation from the very first girl\nat work who actually got me fired we\ntalked about last night\nI don't even know like if I don't have a\nstyle I just I don't care about clothing\nI don't care I wear anything I mean did\nyou dress up for this interview or\nsession or whatever we're doing did you\nthink about what you were wearing when\nyou came on here\nit kind of cuz I mean it's record it\nisn't it so so like I mean how do you\nhow comfortable do you feel with what\nyou're wearing I mean this this is my\ndating outfit without the blazer I mean\nyou know I'm pretty comfortable with it\nokay\nI think you look sharp man I can't see\nthe rest of me but yeah that's all right\nyeah I mean you're right I can't see the\nrest of you are you are you like an\noctopus from below the belt a couple of\npeople who commented but this guy\ndoesn't seem that mean if I if I start I\nmean I you probably did see when I went\ntogether the picture so you may be fat\nthat's okay like most like 40% of the\nworld is overweight a lot of them find\nlove like you can do some things to lose\nweight and you can be more confident in\nyourself absolutely but it also doesn't\nmake you unlovable right like people who\nI do wonder whenever when it it's not so\nmuch the case out in the suburbs but\nespecially in London like all the\ncouples you see on the street\nthey're all\n- good-looking couples like it makes\nsense you don't see a lot of fatties\nwith a girl of any size I mean I think\nyou should look closer I'm looking all\nthe time I think that you have a\ncognitive bias that filters what you see\nno because when I do see I'm like wow\nthat's rare okay\ncould be wrong yeah could be wrong I\nthink I think most of the most of the\ncouples in the worlds and in the world\nare fives they're not eights they're not\nnot yet in the world I'm just saying I\nspent specifically in London though I\nfeel like there's a lot of very\nbeautiful people here and that that's\nkind of what the city attracts sure and\nuh Paul how do you think or how do you\nthink this conversation is going is this\nhow is this opera news a train wreck\nlike last time not as bad as last time\nthere what do you mean by train wreck I\nmean maybe maybe it like comes I don't\nknow maybe I mean a train right because\nthere's no there's no focus I don't know\nwhat should we focus on I thought it was\nterrible last time but they when I went\nback and watched it again I realized\nthat it was it was fine like if I would\njust let go a little bit more it was\nbecause I was trying to oversteer it I\ntold you at the start right so I'm not\ngonna be as bad as I think it is right\nnow so I'm kind of do you think so you\nYouth her you said there were some\nthings that we're gonna be difficult to\ntalk about but that you felt like they\nwere important or something can you just\nhelp me understand what you said earlier\nlike you would you had planned on\ntalking about some stuff but you thought\nit was gonna be oh no I had no I don't\nremember quite what you had said yeah no\nis that what I said was that my anxiety\ndrove me to visit some darker places in\nmy past that I thought I would have\nwould be obligated to talk about in\norder to fix me but obviously that's not\nthe case why is that not obviously the\ncase\nno I'm saying it's not the case I know\nwhy do you why do you say that well\nbecause we've never had to approach\nthose topics and are you fixed hello you\nknow well this is it this is this is the\nanxiety is I feel like I'm pretty like a\nhundred sessions away from being fixed\nand we don't have I know I don't know\nhow many sessions we have but I know we\ndon't have a hundred so do you think\nthat those those dark parts of your past\nor part of what's holding you back\nI don't yet they hold me back\nit may be I never got closure on some\nsome things I don't like I I just don't\nknow what like am I like was I in the\nwrong I like I'm I have fundamentally a\nbad person and is that why I can't\nconnect with anyone yeah so I think if\nthat thought is floating around in your\nhead it's gonna interfere with your\nability to present your best self right\nso the hypothesis we came up with last\ntime was that it's not actually that the\nworld doesn't I mean I don't believe\nthat you can't find love I've I I\nbelieve that what's holding you back is\nyourself and I I think that going\nforward we've got a choice we can\ncontinue to meander as we have been or\nwe can talk about that like whatever the\ndark stuff is and where you got the idea\nthat you're you're destined to be this\nway\nbecause that sounds relevant to me but\nlast week you you seemed pretty\nconfidently that we were on the right\ntrack and we didn't need to talk I mean\nyou seem pretty sure you like with you\nin your convictions you seem pretty\nconfident that we were going in the\nright you know you were handing out\npearls left and right and I thought we\nwere going to end up this week talking\nabout how to catch hopelessness and hone\nthat the only reason you're even aware\nthat there's something else that we're\nnot talking about is cuz I mentioned it\nbriefly in the in the preamble yep which\nI maybe shouldn't have done I mean\nbecause if it's important to talk about\nthat wouldn't you discovered it\norganically like without me just\npresenting it to you I got no no let me\nexplain something organic discovery is\nbased on little preambles\nright that's what that is\nI can't I can't I'm not a mind-reader I\ncan only work with what you give me yeah\nit's just the last week every time I\ntried to give you something you kept\nshutting me down with it see you better\nthat you're mind doing that thing again\nit seems like I was just giving you the\nsame [ __ ] I wasn't wasn't really helping\nwhen I was giving you more stuff I'm\nsorry for shutting you down\nno I don't know it just seemed like you\nall are you absolutely sure about where\nthis was all headed and everything that\nwas last foot you had yeah I know okay I\ndon't know what this week is I'm trying\nto tell you it this week is it just\nseems like you're not listening don't\ntell me you own the plan I think we got\nto talk about the dark stuff Oh only one\nway to find out right we have why do we\nhave to talk about it because we tried\nto not talk about it\nI tried to respect your feelings and\nwe've made meandering for the last\nhalf-hour to 45 minutes is it not useful\nme wondering would you sure does it feel\nuseful to you\nI mean you said you said it wouldn't\nfeel transformative though so I don't I\nguess I'd waylaid the expect little care\nso much about what I said before well if\nI didn't care what you said if I'm not\ntaking on board the things you say was\nthe point in fair point okay the dirac\ndo you want to renege on any of those\nthings is uh what I think we should do\nis let the last conversation be the last\nconversation and for this conversation\nto be this conversation right should you\nlearn from the last conversation\nabsolutely but I don't think that we\nshould let I mean honestly this this\nfeels very avoidant to me and I think\nthat one sign of avoidance is meandering\nconversations right so so it seems like\nthere's something that you really do not\nwant to talk about and it's not my place\nto bully you into talking sweetie\ndaddy's a little bit busy honey the\nultimate of wait it's darling can you\nplease can you please go outside and\nclose the toy\nyour pants are falling down\nokay go put your babies to sleep in the\nother bedroom they can't sleep in here\nthere are too many lights on so you've\ngot a 30-second break to figure out what\nwe're talking about Paul baby please go\noutside daddy's working\nokay can you put your babies to sleep\nand then get going okay thank you what\ndo you think man about I mean you want\nto talk about what you need to talk\nabout I I don't know what I need to talk\nabout what did you said there were some\ndifficult things to talk about what are\nyou referring to can you help close the\ndoor honey thank you it's difficult to\ntalk about the few relationships I have\nhad with women in my life if you can\neven call them that tell me about them I\nmean one wee word he touched on it's\nlike it was getting fired from my first\njob mm-hmm that was probably the start\nbecause there's not much before that\nbecause like I said I went to an\nall-male high school mm-hmm so then yeah\nthat whole thing was just so it was so\nridiculously you it's almost hard to\neven believe it how ridiculous so I well\nI only work there for like six months\nmaybe seven or eight actually but but\none day my boss comes to me and he says\nthat don't go for lunch today you did\nonly did you just stay here he didn't\nsay anything more than that maybe you\nhave to rewind a little bit more than\nthat so obviously I met this girl at\nwork and we still we started going out\nto lunch together like every day just it\njust her and me were you attracted to\nher no not at first and no and from the\noutset she made it clear like she's got\na boyfriend that is just we're just\nwe're just friends that's fine but I\nguess the long story short is like after\na month of doing this then yes I started\nto become a little bit attracted to her\nlike after like a month which was which\nwas awkward for me because I already\nknew that that's like that's not more\nnot acceptable\nbut I told her directly that that's how\nI was how I was feeling and that I hoped\nthat she would push back but she didn't\nand I just made it really awkward for me\nso I kind of just tried to break it off\nlike just let's let's just stop which\nshe didn't want to do either so I\nremember I sent her an email which so\nlike I say we're going out to lunch all\nthe time but like even when I'm supposed\nto be working like half the time I'm\nemailing which is emailing each other\nback and forth so it like we're in in\neach other's heads like a lot of the\ntime what do you mean by all the way huh\nyou said you said it made it awkward for\nme because I started to have feelings\nfor her and and she had a boyfriend\nyeah well so obviously and that's not\ngonna work is it right so so I sent her\nsomething there's a little bit what is\nthe feeling of awkward so it's it's not\ngoing to work is an analytical\nconclusion yeah what what is what is\nawkward mean like what was your\nexperience of awkward\nI mean I don't know what you're asking\ncuz it's nothing more than I already\ntold you the experience is so I'm\nlagging I'm literally walking out to\nlunch with her one day and I'm actually\njust like a few paces behind and I find\nmyself I find myself just gazing at her\nfigure like you know like on a minute\nthis is no good you know I wish do you\nknow up until that point that was not\nreally a problem I was just like it was\njust she was just a friend like 100%\ngenuinely and at some point I realized\nthat that doesn't seem to still be the\ncase like in my head and so when I told\nher this I expected to get a bit upset\nbe like oh yeah\nto conclude the same thing that I didn't\nlook like oh well where did you say her\nI pretty much just what I told you I\njust I don't know actually I don't\n[ __ ] remember it was fifteen years\ntwelve years ago something I don't\nremember what I told her but I told her\nsomething along the lines of I feel like\nI'm getting like a bit attracted to\nsomething I don't know [ __ ] knows what I\nsaid but she the thing is she didn't\nreact the way I expected you just seemed\nokay with that which which I didn't so I\nsent it so I sent her an email which is\na little bit rude and uh in the hopes\nthat that would like force her to like\nwant to break it off so then it'll be\nmutually be easier and it did work but\nwhy did you want her to break it off I\ndon't know I guess because so that it\nwouldn't be awkward\ncuz she's got a boyfriend that's why who\nshe lives with who she came to this\ncountry to be with because they met\nonline and so like it doesn't mean well\nso yeah I didn't want to be any part of\nlike something weird and she was saying\nstuff like she wanted to bake cakes for\nme at the weekend and all this stuff I\nwas like wow this is a bit too far in it\ncuz I mean you he's mm-hmm he's probably\nasked like what are they\nwhat are you gonna like say what the\n[ __ ] is all this like out of it so well\nI wanted I wanted to I wanted to be\ngrounded and and they seemed like things\nwere getting a little bit carried away\nso I don't know what was getting carried\naway we were or she was or something I\ndon't know so yeah okay\nbut look I don't wanna get because it's\na long story at this pace so in any case\nI we've managed them what are you trying\nto fast forward past why are you trying\nto fast forward nothing particularly\nthat I'm not leaving anything out I'm\njust I'm just conscientious that you\ncould digress forever and I wouldn't\nwouldn't add anything to the story so\nI'm not so concerned about the story\nwhat I'm concerned about is how your\nexperience of the story right and that\nthat I mean you keep on using the word\nawkward but like awkward is awkward is\nkind of a description it's not really\nawkward usually means like a conflict of\nfeelings sure there was a conflict of\nfeelings what were those feelings I\ndon't know man but who's getting\nfrustrated now it's like it's like I\nlike her but also I don't like the way\nshe's I don't know I like her that's\nlike and dislike I guess I don't know\nwhat do you like\nI like that she was a girl who was into\nme because that's not happened really\never since\nand what do you dislike I just like that\nit's fake like that it that it that is\nold doesn't sound fake to me I'm sure\nyou dislike something about it but what\nis what is fake to you about it well\nthey they call it leading out lead\nleading you on right cuz it's not cuz\nshe's already she's already comfortable\nshe's old he's like so whatever happens\nshe goes home to her to a boyfriend\nevery evening so like that's what I\ndon't like about it how does that make\nyou feel like a [ __ ] pawn yeah like\nI'm just being\nI'm just being played you know how she\nplaying you cuz she's just using me the\nstroke her ego I guess I don't [ __ ]\nknow yeah I don't know if it's quite\nlike that but I mean I what sounds\nreally you know Paul I think though\nI'm trying to think about how to say\nthis\nI think one of the hardest things to\ndeal with is when you want something\nyour entire life you've always wanted\nsomething and that thing comes along but\nit's like conditional so you but you you\nstart off from there so I think one of\nthe hardest things is when you want\nsomething in life and then it comes\nalong but it's conditional or there's a\npiece of it that you you know it's it's\nkind of like window shopping like you\ncan see it and she's right there but\nthere's something in the way and that\nsounds to me to be almost more painful\nit seems like almost like it's kind of\nweird because here's a girl who's\nclearly into you you tell her she has\nyou have feelings for her but she never\nshe never said that though she made it\nlike I said very clear from the start\nworld the ground we would we're just\nfriends um so she she may have said what\nthe ground rules are but I think she\nmade it very clear that those are not\nthe ground rules because after you\nconfess that you were attracted to her\nhow did she respond yeah I know you\ncould you know you could interpret it\nthat way I mean do you think that that's\nan honor I mean you're the you're the\none who interpreted you but it comes\nback to this colleagues thing right like\nshe's so she's never so she is spending\nquite a certain amount of time with me\nat work pretty much all the time she can\ngiven that our desks are apart it were\nout to lunch which is the time we can be\ntogether and in the interns yes with but\nat the same time she doesn't want to\nsubstitute any of her time with her\nboyfriend to eat with me when it's no\nlonger convenient like she there was no\nafter work or anything like that and\nneither of us was seeking that but I'm\njust just I'm just pointing out like\nyeah how does that really clear now of\ncourse the feel of [ __ ] I mean I\nactually I don't know that it does no\nbecause I neither has wanted that you\njust know it just occurred to me really\none like a month know at the time I\ngenuinely didn't as far as I can recall\nbecause that that's the thing I want as\nsoon as I'd noticed that I was starting\nto feel attracted I wanted to break it\noff that was my reaction\nwhy because I didn't see it working any\nI didn't see it working any other way\nI thought it I thought it'd be more like\nI thought I was being a I guess because\nI genuinely believed in the in the story\nthat we were friends\nand that I was being a bad friend if I'm\nattracted to it that doesn't work that's\nthat's what I believed mm-hmm yeah I I\nthink that that makes sense to me I\nthink that there was conflict because\nyou clearly had feelings for her you\nwere attracted to her and you also felt\nlike she was using you yeah\nwhat is that what you said yes but you\nwere very dismissive yeah no I'm just\nfrustrated because I thought I thought\nwe were gonna get I thought I don't know\nI just thought we were gonna I was gonna\nlay out the story and this is like so\nmuch more of it to tell that takes place\nafter all this yeah frustrating that I'm\nasking you questions instead of letting\nyou continue to tell the story yeah a\nlittle bit okay I apologize please\ncontinue cuz I I'm not keeping track of\ntime but neither am i yeah so okay so I\nsuccessfully managed to break it off by\nspice kind of like slightly insulting\nher a little bit and and we stopped\nseeing each other but we stopped going\nout to lunch was sure away yeah yeah\nexactly\nand that was fine that was it was a bit\nabrupt but you know for the for the\nweeks that followed though it seemed to\nbe fine until so then we come back to\nwhere it where I was so my boss comes to\nme says don't go to lunch today and for\nsome reason I felt really nervous about\nthat and I started drinking like a lot\nof water like too much water like I was\ngetting buzzed off it turns out my\nparanoia was not misplaced though\nbecause it was it was I couldn't even I\ncouldn't have imagined what's about to\nhappen so somewhere during the lunch\ntime when I would have been having lunch\nhe says okay\nit's like it's like a multi-story\nbuilding he says like we're gonna go\ndown to the second floor no I have it\ngoes to the second floor I mean whether\nit's just like a bunch of meeting rooms\nright there's no it's not even a company\non that floor so we go into one of the\nrooms there and they just asked me to\nwait there and then this guy I've never\nseen before\nenters the room\nI would later learned that he was from a\nconsulting company from so this is\nbefore I went to London he was from a\nconsulting company in London so he\ntravelled like two hours up the country\njust to be there and uh for some reason\nin that moment I broke down like I just\ndidn't know what was going on and no one\nwas telling me anything and I just felt\nreally upset or just really nervous and\nI just I almost blacked out like I was\njust started crying and then and this\nguy he was like he was he was excited by\nthat he was he was on it immediately and\nhe was like well what are you crying you\nknow what you know you know tell me what\nyou're feeling in this moment that kind\nof like almost like it was like you do\nin this situation and that that that\nreally that angered me even in that even\nin that moment when I'm like in a really\nbizarre spot just this that he would he\nwould like because because the people\nthat I actually know were not present so\nthe people from my company were supposed\nto be there but were out of the room at\nthis mount it was just him and me and he\nseemed like he just took advantage of\nthe situation to maybe do something that\nhe was wasn't really supposed to do you\njust like poke at me a bit and that that\nsort of frustrated me do you feel like\nany way it can get you now no no no\nthere's nothing to do with that he's not\na licensed psychiatrist or anything he\nwas just some I don't even really know\nbut anyway it turned out that they were\nthey were putting me on suspended they\nwanted to suspend me pending\ninvestigation because they had heard\ncomplaints from this girl that third I\nthink what was the allegation that was\nharassing her was was what they will eat\nhow they termed it\nand they lumped it and because that\ndidn't seem sufficiently lumped in some\nother stuff as well so they also they\nalso tried to pin on me that I was\nsuicidal which is absolutely nonsense\nbut that thing barrette blew out of\nproportion anymore followed where did\nthey get that idea and so they got that\nso a couple weeks prior one of the new\nHR was the only one and she was very\nyoung\nnot much older than me some fresh HR\ngirl III did this this thing you know as\na joke I comment what the conversation\naround it was but I did this motion like\nattended to shoot myself in the head at\none point and she'd mentioned this to\nthem prior to this guy meeting me and at\nthe time she had no concern whatsoever\nbut but weeks later she mentions it to\nthem and they take it's super serious\nlike they think all these guys like\noffice this guy's like a you know a bit\nof a nutcase so how does it feel to be\non the other end of that scrutiny to be\ntreated like that you you you have\nnowhere to run like so let's say that I\nactually was like if you're if you're in\nif you're in a mental asylum it's no\ngood it's no good pleading your case\nright it's like oh you know of course\nyou're or you're the one that's not\ncrazy right you know it's like oh no I'm\nhonestly I'm not mental you know if\neveryone's perception of you is that\nyou're crazy you need to be locked up\nyou have no plea there's nothing you can\nsay to get out of that and it's very\nmuch the same situation that I was in\nit's like well if they if they all\nbelieve the euro you're a suicide case\nthen it doesn't leave nothing you can\nsay but but they weren't sure they\nweren't sure that's they just had this\none girl's word so what they ended up\ndoing was sending me to so they\nsuspended me but with pay pending this\ninvestigation part of that investigation\nwas to send me to a psychiatrist for a\nnumber of sessions I don't remember how\nmany it off somewhere in the country\nlike some miles away in the middle of\nnowhere just this guy who lived in a\nlittle cottage doing psychiatry I guess\n[Music]\nand his main purpose was to figure out\nwhether or not I was actually suicidal I\nthink that's although I used those\nsessions to try and gain some\nunderstanding and like some perspective\nand good for you but I didn't get\nanywhere I don't think I got anywhere\nwith it because I'm still here today\nwondering about it like did I [ __ ] up\ndid she [ __ ] up is it my fault is it her\nfault is it nobody's fault is the\ncompany's fault who's to blame for all\nthis [ __ ] I still don't know it's like\nthis many years later I still don't know\nso in in the it took two months before\nthey finally finally let me go and\nfinally gave me some [ __ ] clothes at\nleast tell me that there's no longer a\njob for me here up until that point I\nwould come in occasionally to meet with\nthese guys again they would come up from\nLondon then they would ask me questions\nand they would try to learn stuff about\nwhat had happened and I couldn't make\nsense of it like what is this what is\nthis all like why make such a fuss what\nwas it like - do you remember what it\nfelt like walking into the building -\nlike a meet with those guys every now\nand then as they kind of need another\none quote and proddin I keep in mind\nthat it's my first job out of university\nI'm pinning everything I still feel like\nif I lose my job here I'm never gonna\nget I'm never gonna work again like I'm\nI don't know what my future looks like\nif I can't if I can't get my job back so\nI go into these sessions I prepare for\nthem I try and prepare all the evidence\nI can to answer whatever questions they\nmight have I would do of timelines and I\nmean I don't have access to any the\ninformation I would have had but it -\nher access to my own memory but I would\ntry to prepare stuff to try and placate\nwhatever concerns they had ultimately it\ndidn't matter at all and I only kind of\ngauged in the very last session what\nactually might have been going on so I\nthink they did they they were just\nconcerned whether or not there was any\nlegal ramifications for - firing one or\nboth of us I think that's what was\nactually going on it wasn't really the\ncase that they gave a [ __ ] about whether\nthey kept me on or her on or whatever it\nwas it was just whether\nand they eventually concluded that\nlegislation at that time was that if you\nhaven't worked anywhere for a full two\nyears no for one year at that time it's\nnow two years but other time was only 12\nmonths then you could you could like\ntake a court their company to tribunal\nover unfair dismissal this and I hadn't\nI hadn't quite made it to 12 but she had\nshe was just in by like a month or two\nand I think so I would say they never\ntold it to me in those terms they let\nthey let a few points around that slip\nduring the final meeting which kind of\nclued me into what was going on but I\nbelieve that's what it was but you know\nmaybe that's just the story I tell\nmyself maybe I really did [ __ ] off\nhorrendously anything but it just is\nit's so bizarre like I've not had an\nexperience like it since and I can't\neven imagine like why go through that\nthat much [ __ ] I'm a junior so she she's\njust a translator\nthe tenor penny the clock in a machine\njust go and get another one like why go\nto that much first why keep me on\npayroll for two months why bring up\nthese people from London I still don't\nknow now it's insane to me that this\nhappened\ndid they really feel like they had a\nmoral responsibility to me and to\nthemselves into the company to make sure\nthat I wasn't actually suicidal before\nletting me go because that's kind of how\nthey painted it but I don't I don't know\nif I can really build if I can really\nbuy it it's just it's just insane the\nwhole thing I know we're not even going\ninto details that's just a sort of like\nthe high level but it is can you give me\nan example of what details you're you're\nnot going into probably not actually\nmost of it's a haze now okay there's\nprobably nothing important so it sounds\nlike okay but but I really wish I really\nwish I knew like whose fault everything\nall of this was what would change for\nyou if you knew whose fault it was\nif it's not my fault then I don't have\nto feel bad about it do you feel bad\nabout it\nI don't know it sounds like this is\nsomething you've been carrying for a\nlong time yeah I don't know if I'm\nsupposed to feel bad about it because I\ndon't even know that we broke it like so\nI broke it off for this girl and the\nnext thing I know I'm being hauled into\na room to try and defend my actions\nwhich was what exactly no waiting yeah\nis that how it feels it's not assuming\nit's just bizarre and like the\nfrustrating thing is so they were\nspeaking to me but they were also\nspeaking to her but I mean I never saw\nher again right they wouldn't they\nobviously wouldn't let us go near each\nother so I don't really know if I'm\nsupposed to feel bad like what if what\nif I was just being played from them\nfrom day one to day 32 day 60 like but\nwhat if what if she was totally happy\nwith it how everything turned out it\nseems unlikely but then I wouldn't have\nto feel bad because I mean I'm the\nvictim in that case but what if what if\nshe actually genuinely so so the other\nthing is sort of the way the reason they\nwere actually more on her side than mine\nfrom the get-go is because of the way\nthe in the way the look the problem was\nreported was that she didn't go to the\ncompany and say look I don't like this\nguy he's been making me feel bad or he's\nharassing me or whatever the claim was\nit's because she was just crying at her\ndesk and then someone quiet oh why are\nyou why are you sad and they said oh and\nthen she told him about it and and they\nthey drilled that point home to me a few\ntimes which is why they're kind of like\non her side and it kind of does it\nfending to neglect to mention that\nactually was a common occurrence for she\nshe was very emotional and frequently\ngot upset about things that I have no\nidea what they would be at her desk and\nit just turned out that one of those\ntimes it was my fault apparently sounds\npretty unfair to me what's unfair who\nwhat's what's unfair to you sounds like\nyou got railroaded I don't know did I\nfeel I did I genuinely do something bad\nI don't know sure I think you did\nsomething bad it sounds like you sent a\nhurtful email\nrest of it I you know seems like you\ndidn't really do anything wrong you know\nI don't know I looking back at it\nprobably that it is would it be it would\nbe just out at most but at the time I\nwas also wondering like probably other\nthings I don't know like I've been a bad\nfriend had been a bad person\nfundamentally like it well I don't I\ndon't know like probably now I don't\nprobably now it doesn't sit with me like\nthat so with that with that level of\ncalm how does it sit with you now I\nguess I guess it's just water under the\nbridge on now but but also not I could\nthink so man I just I just want I guess\nit's like I told you but I just want\nclosure it's like someone tell me please\nsomeone tell me who the [ __ ] is at fault\nyeah so at least I know where I you\nthink do you think this influences your\nrelationships with women now I don't\nknow I don't know I think it does I\nthink I think you've been tiring this\naround for a long long time yet thought\nthat and the rest said that there was\nlike at least one other relationship\nwhich we never we don't have time to\ntalk about but but yeah that was the\nfirst one can I tell you what I see and\nwhat I heard please\nso you talk about closure you talk about\njust wanting to know right you just want\nto know I mean it sounds like you're\nactually if you made a mistake and if\nyou [ __ ] up and if you're bad you can\nlive with that it sounds like no known\nwell I know I don't know how I would\ntake it but if I'd learned that well if\nI'd if I learned that if I learned that\nthat is my fault I don't know what I\nwould do then I guess I want to hear\nthat it's not yeah so you're looking for\nabsolution and it sounds like the\nuncertainty is just really tearing you\nup\nit sounds like torture it yeah not so\nmuch I mean that's the thing like I\nrarely think about it now thank God but\nif I have to think about it then yeah it\nis like that yeah so that doesn't sound\nlike something that you've let go so\ngenerally speaking when we have\nexperiences like this we carry them with\nus and they occupy a space on in our\nmind and they tend to influence or\nburden what we do and what I hear from\nyou is is that you had a relationship\nwhere someone was very clearly\ninterested in you and that you felt used\nyou felt icky by y'all's relationship\nyou expressed your feelings you also\ncared about her and were attracted to\nher and you were hoping that she would\nmake it easy on you you were hoping that\nsharing your feelings with her she would\nsay she would be kind of like she would\ngive you closure right she wouldn't\nleave things ambiguous that she would\nsay yeah we have to stop but she did\nthis yeah and so here comes Paul who's\nlonely and has never been appreciated by\na woman in his life and here comes a\nwoman who's in a relationship and\ndespite being in a relationship and\ndespite having all of these these\nreasons for her to say no Paul she's not\nsaying no that makes it even doubly\ndifficult and now and then you don't\nknow I mean you keep on using the word\nawkward but you don't know what to think\nyou don't know what to feel it feels\nwrong to you but you want it you want\nher\nwanted to continue you want her to bring\nI didn't what it's yeah I wanted to\nbreak up Ian yeah I think there's a part\nof you that wanted it to continue I\ndon't believe that's the case okay not\nat that time I don't know that it's\nworth to go down that tangent but I'll\njust say this when you have a connection\nwith someone who you go out to lunch\nwith every day and you guys are emailing\nback and forth every day and you find\nyourself attracted to them I find it\nhard to believe that there is not some\ncorner of your mind or your heart that\ndoes not want that to continue or want\nmore from that I just find that hard to\nbelieve\nno but it reached a point where I\ngenerally told you\nit generally felt this comfortable with\nit and I wanted to cut it off and I did\nyeah I was just after that yeah so Paul\nI think that I agree with all of those\nthings as well but I want you to\nunderstand that your mind is not\nblack-and-white I think on balance you\ndecided that the relationship was not\ngood for you and it made you too\nuncomfortable but just because it made\nyou too uncomfortable doesn't mean that\nthere isn't a part of you that enjoyed\nspending time with her right yeah oops\nuntil that point yes you're providing\nokay so you're presupposing that I\ngenuinely wanted to come part of me\ngenuinely whether subconscious or\notherwise part of me genuinely wanted to\ncontinue in spite of that and I don't\nthink that's the case okay without\nregret I ended it okay so you decided\nthat you didn't want to be a part of\nthis relationship because of kind of\nthat right unclear boundaries that you\nwere content with friendship and that\nbit of feelings but that yes I heard yes\nthe second one that I haven't told you\nabout went more the way that you're\nimplying which is like so there was a\nsecond girl and it was exactly the same\n[ __ ] set up she has a boyfriend but\nshe's talking to me every day all day\nevery day and this was not at work this\nis slightly different and and yes I knew\nshe had a boyfriend from the start but I\nkind of I wanted to play that [ __ ]\ngame this this time around I wanted to\nplay that [ __ ] game and I wanted\nI wanted to beat him and long story\nshort I didn't but if you've got time to\ngo into all of that\nI don't even even know it it's\nbeneficial to do so but I'm telling you\nthe first time I did no fine I yeah\nthank you for clarifying you're more\nthan welcome and and but I think also\nthere's there's a sense of powerlessness\nabout this there's a sense of confusion\nand bewilderment there's a sense of\ngetting handled process there's anger\nthere's frustration there's confusion\nand I think the the biggest part I mean\nthe thing that seems to be weighing on\neither most is you don't know who to\nblame yeah you tell me what would it\nhelp yeah I don't think Paul I don't\nthink you did anything wrong\nI think but not really I think\neverything that you lo put it this way I\nthink everything you did is forgivable I\nthink that you had feelings you there\nwas I think you had a relationship with\na woman where you guys had decided that\nyou were gonna be friends and that as\nthat relationship huh\nbreaking up again oh sorry I said I\nthink you you did everything you did\nwhat I think was reasonable and also\nforgivable so I think let me just let me\ntell you the story as I heard it okay\nand I'm pretty good at sniffing out when\nthere are cognitive biases and [ __ ]\nand stories so you know take that let me\ntake that for what you had you have a\nbias because you only hear my side but\nyes no no but I mean I hear bias I hear\nonly one side of stories all the time\nfrom people and I still can sniff out\n[ __ ] pretty well that's my pocket\nright so when an alcoholic comes into my\noffice and says I haven't been drinking\nI'm pretty good at sniffing that out so\nhere's what I hear you went to work you\nhad a friend you guys had a connection\nit was purely platonic and you guys\nreally enjoyed spending time with each\nother you guys spent time with each\nother she had made it very clear to you\nthat she was only interested in\nfriendship\nand then something happened between the\ntwo of you which is that you started to\nget attracted to her and chances are she\ngot attracted to you too otherwise you\nknow things would not have perceived\ncan't comment on her end yeah well but\nyeah but I think we can write so I think\nthat that those kinds of feelings and\nstuff evolve all the time when people\nspend a lot of time together you guys\nreally it sounds like you guys had a\nconnection and then you noticed that you\nwere starting to feel attracted to her\nand out of out of actually your duty\ntowards your friendship you shared that\nwith her because you felt like your\nrelationship which was changing and\nalmost out of respect I mean I think\nit's a reasonable thing for friends to\ndo if they start to have feelings of\nattraction because it gives you a chance\nto sort of figure out how you guys are\ngonna move forward as friends and and\nwhether there's something worth\nexploring or not exploring and you were\nexpecting her to pull back and she did\nit and then it also sounds like she kind\nof was was sending you mixed signals\nbecause on the one hand she's you guys\nare going to lunch everyday on the other\nhand you're emailing back and forth and\nthen she tells you she wants to start\nbaking cakes and then I think you\nstarted to feel guilty you started to\nfeel like this isn't right and I'm not\nso sure what you wanted or you didn't\nwant but it just didn't feel good to you\nanymore so you've tried to push her away\nand lo and behold she's actually pretty\ninto you and values your relationship\nand unclear of what how she feels about\nyou\nbut there are also a lot of questionable\nthings about her background too so a lot\nof times people who meet online and move\ncountries are not actually that\nemotionally invested in the person that\nthey move in with or when they move it\nturns out to be like a different kind of\nrelationship than being like a thousand\nmiles away so I know a lot of online\nrelationships that fall apart because\nthey meet someone else who's local I've\nheard that story a thousand times coming\nback to you and what you're at fault for\nand then I think you start to feel\nuncomfortable and you don't really know\nhow to handle it and you want the\nrelationship to end and you've tried to\ntell her things that would drive her\naway and she doesn't get driven away she\ndoesn't get driven away and she doesn't\nget driven away and so then you send her\na mean email because that's sometimes\nwhat you have to do to push people away\nnow I do I think you could have done\na better job with communicating things\nor setting limits with her absolutely do\nI think that you should have sent an\nemail absolutely not do I think it's\nforgivable given the circumstances\nabsolutely right so life is not about\nnot making mistakes it's about you know\nlike making mistakes that are reasonable\ngiven the circumstances because we're\nnot all perfect human beings and then\nthe real [ __ ] show starts you get\nrailroaded you get called into room it's\nnot even your boss it's some guy who's\ndriven two hours up I don't even know\nhow you feel I I mean it sounds like you\nfeel powerless you feel confused you\nfeel persecuted you feel like it's\nunfair I mean that's what I heard I\nheard venom in your voice I heard anger\nI heard I heard a sense of injustice\nabout the way that you were treated yeah\nit didn't matter what at the time I\nbelieved that but all this work in\npreparation I might do to vindicate\nmyself would actually have approached\nlike I like I felt like I felt like it\nwas a fair trial but it wasn't yeah I\nalso I also hear futility I also hear\nhopelessness right that you had hope and\nthat hope was was smashed and I think\nyou carry this with you I think you\ncarry it with you today have you learned\nhow to suppress it absolutely but\nthere's just I mean you know I could see\nthe emotion in your face I'm sure\neveryone who's watching could see the\nemotion in your face I think we can see\nthe dejection and despair in your face\nnow and you just want to be free of it\nyou want to know whose fault it was I\ndon't think it was your fault I think\nactually your conception of it was\npretty good I think sometimes women who\nwere hurt say things I think not just\nwomen people who were hurt to say things\nand I think that you know she someone\ncaught her at a time where she said some\nstuff and then this HR person noticed\nlike this whole thing and so like like\nthe pieces of the puzzle start got put\ntogether and it's not even that those\npieces of the puzzle it's not even the\nlikelihood that those pieces connect in\na certain way\nthe corporation doesn't care about what\nhappened they cared about how things\ncould look because that's how\ncorporations think right then don't\nactually care about the truth they think\nabout you know can we get sued for this\ncould someone make an argument for\ngetting sued and the answer is\nabsolutely yes in their case and I think\nthey played their game which is that\nthey protect themselves and they don't\nwant to get sued and they'll railroad an\nemployer to in the process if they need\nto I think if anyone is to blame it's\nactually your boss and your company for\nthe way that they handled it I would\nlike to think so\nI've never seen anything like it since\nit seems absolutely bizarre yeah and and\nI think the challenge here Paul is that\nI think a piece of this lingers with you\nand I think a piece of it swims around\nin the back of your mind and changes the\nway that you view relationships like not\nin such a grain like I don't think it's\nas simple as like that's the reason you\ndon't have a girlfriend now I think\nthese kinds of experiences happen all\nthe time but is it related though I\nthink so I think it's incredibly hurtful\nwas this was this was this whole\nexposition setting the grounds for\nbecoming an NSL fifteen years later\nmm-hmm\nsetting the grounds I don't think it's\nquite as that tied together and cause\nand effect but I think it could account\nfor 20% of it right when I think about\nRuth when I think about like the person\nwho would have walked out of that door I\ncan think about that person would have\ndifficulty engaging with other women and\nthat's not because you're an insole that\nspeak us the human brain is designed to\nbe pain averse so if we look at the\ncircuits of our brain that are the\nstrongest at learning they're very close\nto pain so if you touch a hot stove once\nit's very very hard to touch it again so\nthe biggest teacher that we have is pain\nand this sounds like an incredibly\npainful experience to you and you've\nbeen [ __ ] avoiding it ever since and\nI can't imagine what kind of other\nthings you've avoided in terms of\nopportunities relationship stuff like\nthat because of your fear of getting\nhurt\nwell it's not like I'm just slapping\nthem in the way left and right I can\ntell you that yeah and I think that's\nthat's exactly what you want I think\nthat you you try to create situations\nwhere you don't want you don't want to\nrisk having to slap a woman away and you\ndon't want to risk having a woman like\nin engage in a relationship with you\nthat could fall apart or end like this\nagain\nso is that true it was definitely true\ncloser to the time I don't even know\nwhere I sit with it now yeah so like I'm\ntrying to get back in there despite\neverything that's happened and yet\nsomehow it doesn't so so I think I think\nlast time our pearl was that\nhopelessness is a protective mechanism\nand I think hopelessness is the defense\nagainst something like this because if\nthere's no possibility of a relationship\nthere's no rodeo that you just went\nthrough yeah but but you're making it\nsound like again like I'm just turning\naway opportunities though I mean oh but\nactually don't come anymore yeah I don't\nI don't mean to say that you're turning\naway opportunities what I mean to say is\nthat I find it hard to believe that this\ncould not have influenced the next five\nyears which in turn oh it definitely did\nyeah definitely which in the turn is\ngoing to have its own impact on the five\nyears after that which in turn is going\nto have its own impact on the five years\nafter that but how is it in fact if it\naffected me today I don't know well so\nwhat I see is a lot of suppressed\nemotion and my my experience as a\nclinician is that when there's\nsuppressed emotion that emotion leaks\nand it affects people in unexpected ways\nand that most of the time they're not\naware of it but if it's leaking you\nshould be able to see it right yeah so I\nthink your hopelessness is a sign of the\nleaking because that hopelessness is a\nprotective mechanism comes from\nsomewhere right and I think it's\nreinforced by all kinds of other logical\nthings like the fact that you've tried\nto date people over and over and over\nagain and it hasn't worked\nbut I do think so let me put it this way\nPaul how does it affect you today I\nthink you still carry the burden and I\nthink it's hard to feel free when you\ncarry that burden and I think it's hard\nto fully engage in a relationship when\nyou carry a burden and that the purest\nand happiest relationships happen with\npeople who feel unburdened or share\nthose burdens it weighs on you so how do\nI take it off I mean I guess it helps to\nknow that you don't think it I mean I\nthink Norman tells me that you don't\nhave to you still are guilty but you\nstarted to take it off by expressing\nsome of these emotions so you've opened\nup that bottle and you're venting some\nof that emotion and so the weight of it\nbecomes less I think it's not the first\ntime I've told this story though but I'd\nnever really makes me feel better cuz\nthe person I tell it to never gives me\nclosure either you're the first person\nto say that I don't have to feel guilty\nabout it yeah I don't I don't think you\nneed to and I think I think it's the\ndifference I think I well let me let me\nclarify okay Paul I think that it's fine\nto feel guilty I think you have you have\nput in the time that you need to with\nthat guilt and I think it's time to let\nthat guilt go okay can I just do that\nyeah just like I mean it's hard but just\nlet it go I mean I I think I think you\nyou tell yourself at this point of your\nlife that like you know chances are you\ndidn't [ __ ] up as I mean I don't think\nyou [ __ ] up that bad I think really\nthe only thing that you did was push her\nin a way that was immature which i think\nis forgivable and I think that if you\nfelt guilty so be it because maybe you\ndid something wrong but then you also\nhave to forgive yourself like the way\nthat you let guilt go is by forgiving\nyourself and and you kind of think a\nlittle bit about the person that you\nwere and you think about how experienced\nin experience you were and you think\nabout you know this is your first job\nout of college and you had been to an\nall-boys school and you\nand had a lot of experience with women\nand so you're bound to make mistakes and\nthen you kind of you know it does feel a\nlittle bit hollow to have someone else\nthat you know yeah you know what I just\nrealized and I don't know maybe you're\ngonna like do a Freudian clap or\nsomething but like [ __ ] I probably\nnever gonna be like satisfied unless\nsheathing is me right and that that can\nnever happen\nyep\nI think what you've been looking for is\nforgiveness from her what you're really\nlooking for is closure from her because\nI think it's incredibly painful to have\na relationship like that and then like\nnot like get taken down to the second\nfloor with some guy from London drives\nup two hours to see you and you never\nget a chance to see her yeah I mean I\ncan't even I can't even say I'm I'm\nsorry it doesn't like it's just you just\ngo and of course they're not gonna give\nyou that opportunity because they think\nyou're [ __ ] crazy\nbut putting that aside she put didn't\nwant to anyway it's just that it just\nsucks you can't just have it you can't\njust you kind of reconcile your\ndifferences and didn't say goodbye you\nknow it sounds stupid but like why does\nit even matter especially now like after\nall this time but don't invalidate your\nfeelings it does suck\nright so there is there is sorrow and\nsadness and unfairness in the world and\nwe can't there are some things that we\ncan't fix and and that's unfortunately\nthat the way the world is and just\nbecause the world is that way I think it\nit we carry that burden for a time and\nthen it's time to let it go you need to\nforgive yourself all you need to cut\nyourself some slack and also let\nyourself hope again that something very\nbad happened to you and it is unfair you\ndidn't get closure and the last thing\nthat you need to have is compassion\ntowards yourself for the circumstances\nthat you've been given even if you can't\nget forgiveness from from her I'm not\nsure that you get compassion from\nyourself\nyou were what in your 20s at that time\nso they're in the early 20s\nyeah so like what you need is compassion\nfrom 35 year old Paul towards early 20s\nfall you're older you're wiser and go\nback and tell that dude that it's not\nhis fault\nhe did the best that he could and now\nit's time to pick yourself up them up\noff the mat and give yourself a shot\nagain there you go good\nSony's quite hard to breathe let it out\njust wanted to come out for a long time\nyou've been holding it for a long time\nso just let it out man it's almost like\nI'm back in the [ __ ] room again\nabsent arrogation room this is the some\nscar you know some scars yeah it is I\nwouldn't know when I first read you\nexplain to reckful what some scar was\nand I was on the other side of the\nscreen I immediately realized that that\nwas the perfect term to describe exactly\nthis and now you know what it is\nfor me too\nI laughed at the start though because\nyou said something like yeah 35 grope\nbut we'll go back and figure I actually\nthought about what I would actually say\nwhat would you say well I don't know I\nwould probably it it's in my nature to\nbe a bit of a troll okay like I've been\nI've been trolling since before the term\nwas even coined like it wasn't even\ncalled anything before so you're the\noats the OG the OT okay [ __ ] yeah I'm\nthe oats\nso I part of me would like be like so so\nthe thing is like so I wanted to break\nit off right well I would probably like\ntroll myself a little bit and say well\nlike no don't do that like go and kick\nthis other guy's ass or something I like\nbut also not so the reason I laughed is\nbecause it was a conflict I didn't\nactually laugh at that laughter the fact\nthat actually that I realized that\nactually this girl isn't even that\n[ __ ] good anyway but she was no she\nwas probably no good for me like it was\nit was it was fine it was fun when we\nwere young but like like touching the\nbeef like she's a [ __ ] nut job anyway\nlike she like I told you she was crying\nthat that's well I don't even know what\nthe [ __ ] about that just like random\nstuff from what I heard I didn't know\nher that well to even know what it was\nbut but she had some problems whatever\nthe [ __ ] they were it was I'm sure she\ndoing fine now\nit's mr. hopes over like I know if she\nwas really that good for me anyway\nso I would probably be like no just get\nthe [ __ ] out of there so it's kind of\nweird to be even hung up about it at all\nnow\nbut I definitely was so two things\nfollow man we're probably gonna have to\nwrap up I'll give you the last word the\nfirst is last time we talked about\nlaughing in its face remember that yeah\nso I'd say if you can learn how to laugh\nin its face so be it sometimes humor is\nall we have left when the world becomes\na terrible terrible place and medical\nhumor is some of the most morbid humor\nthat you can get because we deal with a\nlot of terrible things and so there's a\npart of me that says that when we're\ntalking about authenticity and all that\nother [ __ ] that we were talking about\nfor the first half hour 45 minutes I\nthink I think Paul if you want to find a\ngood relationship it needs to be you\nwith a colored shirt who also shows your\ninner troll just a little bit and it's\ngonna be the girl who can appreciate\nthat it was gonna be the right one for\nyou and I think instead of trying to be\nwhat they want you to be be that person\nthe last thing I know you can disagree\nwith that or they're all kinds of no I\nthought I disagree it's just it's like\nnot really practical well so like so so\nwhat women are in my life right now was\nthe colleagues at work who were just\ncolleagues at work and this is speed\ndates and you can really I mean it's\npretty hard to engineer like a natural\ncontrolling situation informal yeah but\nI mean so that what I'm saying is like\nyou know when you if it feels right and\nit feels natural then do it and if it\ndoesn't you can't force it right that's\nthe forcible smile I'm just saying that\nwhen it comes to the authentic you let\nyou know that's a part of it and then\nthe last thing is you keep on asking\nwhat do I do about it and it's kind of\nsilly that I've been holding on to it\nyou do whatever you just did because\nwhatever you just did is exactly what\nyou need to do right you've been holding\non to this for such a long time and when\nyou think about thirty five-year-old\nyou're going back and it's kind of like\nsaying hey man just let it go man she's\nnot even like she's not worth holding\nonto that hurt for and something about\nthat alchemical process is\nhow you get unburdened and how you move\nforward mm-hmm I almost feel like I'm\nalready over it I don't know if I\nactually am because there's a little bit\ntoo much in one go - probably process\nlike that but yep so it's how it works\nso I think I think the reason that you\nso my experience has been that some\nscars are like dominoes so one injury\nget baguettes another injury baguettes\nanother injury and they kind of build up\nbut then also once you knock the first\none down something has fundamentally\nchanged but I still don't know that I'm\nlike over the second one there's more\nwork to be done\nmaybe maybe no but it's good that you're\nable to laugh and also that you're able\nto notice that you're not over the\nsecond I would trust your instinct in\nthat moment that you're over something\nhere but there's more work to be done\nand that's also how it works man any\nthoughts or questions before we wrap up\nso that's the folks are crying every\nstream then hopefully not but you know I\nI wouldn't I don't really care about no\ncrying but I do care about you facing\nthe things that you need to face and\ngrowing past them and it just so happens\nthat most of the things most of the\ngrowth that people need to do has\ninvolves like- some scars like if you\ncome on and you're an insult like I\nthink there may be tears somewhere in\nthere right you know how do you feel\nphysically\n[Music]\nall right just know I'm all right hmm\nimpressive it's the master of\nsuppressing emotions young\nthere's the Ooty no that's for real\nI think okay I thought it was funny I\nmean it's probably true too but also\nfunny obviously my emotions would not\nsuppress a moment ago but like you you\nalso learned quick recovery I guess I\ndon't know morphing yeah\nbut also I see I was kind of trying to\nsuppress him in the moment it's just a\nbit embarrassing I guess but maybe if we\nwere just in a room you and me and it\nwasn't like a small fraction of the\ninternet watching as well and then I\nwould feel I just [ __ ] go for it hit\nthe wall I don't know Billy and I don't\nreally want to do that\nI'm cameras I think you did that anyway\nI don't I don't think I I don't think no\nI was really trying to I was really\ntrying to stop myself yeah people do\nthat when I mean so what would happen in\ndifferent circumstances I think is\nirrelevant so Paul I think I think we\ndid a good job today\nI'm glad you chose to talk about things\nthat were difficult I think we gave it a\nfair shot at like talking about things\nthat weren't difficult and maybe learn\nsomething maybe you didn't maybe it was\nhelpful maybe it wasn't but this is\nwhere you know my this is the scent that\nI caught and I'm I'm glad you went there\nbecause I think it's where you needed to\ngo it's where I thought from the start\nthat we needed to go but then right I\nsecond-guess myself after the first\nsession mm-hmm do you think that's\nrelevant we do don't you could you said\nyou said like it is at least 20% of\nsomething yeah but I still don't have a\ncurl to put on my wall from this session\nI don't think ya do I\nnope sorry I've got one oh I don't need\nto like wallpaper it the next pearl you\nhave to find on your own oh I did I did\nthe one last time now it's your turn\nokay\ntake care of ball good luck all right\ndog okay\nhowdy guys I"
