    "transcript": "why are we so addicted to our phones\nthat we have to take them with us to the\nbathroom so I think one of the things\nthat we've like lost is the ability to\nbe bored mhm if you really look at it we\ntry to externalize our attention and we\ntry to have our attention constantly be\non like a particular thing and be\nsomewhat entertained because if we\nespecially look at the bathroom it's\nlike what are you giving up right it's\nnot like you're doing any important work\nin there it's not like you're going to\nbe laughing really hard like you know\nsometimes like social media and\ntechnology is about like lots of fun\nlike let's watch some cat videos and and\nso really it's about sort of fast\nforwarding our mind accelerating through\nthat boredom and I think what we've sort\nof found is that there is a device\nthat's able to do that to constantly\nexternalize our attention even though\nit's super low stakes I think we sort of\nsee the depth of the addictive nature\nwhen we're so unwilling to give up\nsomething that's like who cares if\nyou're so innocuous right you don't need\nit you really don't"
