    "transcript": "and the more you guys study yourself the\nbetter off the the closer the gap come\nbecomes between me and you because\nultimately we're all the same we're all\nwe're all lazy mofos okay let's get\nstarted with miss gif time so I'm really\ntired oh I'm sorry man\nwhat Scott what's up with that I don't\nknow why I just get um\nlately I've been getting really bad\nanxiety at night like I I never had\nanxiety my entire life but I can't sleep\nat night anymore because I just get I'll\nwake up and it's not even like it's a\nbad dream and my stomach will be turning\nand I have no idea what to do okay so\nlet's talk about that is that what you'd\nlike to talk I mean is that that seems\nto be to be the most pressing cuz it's\nlike on yeah I'm your mind it's\nsomething that like I mean it's it's\nreally annoying because it affects me\nfor stream for sure cuz I'm a lot more\ntired but when I get a lot of sleep I\nfeel a lot better when I don't get a lot\nof sleep I feel like crap okay so I\nnoticed a couple of things have changed\nmiss keV what things my wall nope oh\nwell yeah your wall is changed too but\nthat's not what I was thinking about I\nwas thinking about the time it took you\nto get a pencil and a piece of paper oh\nyeah I got that pretty quick\nyeah that's my first thing I thought\nabout all are you sure\nso that's a pole\nI'm back okay so then something else has\nchanged what did you just do I made sure\nto not have noises and stuff like that\nso I could focus beautiful well done my\nfriend like you're like a five-year-old\nyeah right so that that's the feeling of\nshame but like that feeling is gonna be\nthere right so let's just okay I'm gonna\ndive in is that okay miss gif mm-hmm\nokay so you feel like a five-year-old\nbecause Here I am and I'm and it's kind\nof my fault because I'm saying like good\njob\nyou got your pencil on time and you\nclose the door and I know I didn't mean\nto make it sound condescending but like\nseriously miss gif I think this is you\ngot to meet yourself where you're at\nright and you you have to set up like\nthis is the difference between sucking\nat life and being good at life it's not\nabout like being ashamed and the problem\nis that shame gets in the way and makes\nus want to not do things that we need to\ndo to take care of ourselves right so\nlike I can feel a shame for like needing\na personal trainer to work out because\nso many people work out on their own but\nif I need a personal trainer I need a\npersonal trainer and in your case I\nthink you've done a masterful job of\nlittle things\ntiny tiny things that are going to\nimprove your you're like output and your\nattention over the course of the next\nhour and you've already incorporated\nthem Thanks and just think about it like\nif if at anyone else if they were in an\ninterview and like if I you know grabbed\nmy like if I just grabbed if I close the\ndoor and grabbed a piece of paper and a\npen like we wouldn't think anything\nabout it right that would just be\ncompletely normal right the only reason\nI'm pointing it out to you is because I\nsee you making a big difference in your\nlife based on one conversation and so I\nactually find that really really\nreassuring because this tells me this is\na guy who if I try to share something\nwith him he's actually gonna [ __ ] pay\nattention and like it will it will do\nsomething there's some people that I\ntalked to where like they don't take\nwhat I offer them and like that's a\nwaste of my time but you are not like\nyou're the very opposite of waste of my\ntime I'm sorry if it sort of feels kind\nof gone\nI really didn't know I know I it's\nthat's fine I don't I didn't care\nokay so do you want to talk a little bit\nmore about attention and suffer you want\nto talk about what keeps you from\nsleeping III think we could do both why\nI think the sleeping thing to me is\nprobably the most pressing thing cuz I I\ncan't sleep anymore it drives me nuts\nlike yeah it's really rough tell me what\nwhat tell me about that what's what's\nkeeping you from sleeping I don't know\nI'll go to bed and then during the night\nI'll just have anxiety like oh oh\nrandomly I'll wake up multiple times\nthroughout the night and I'll be really\ntired\nthe next day because I just can't sleep\nbecause I have anxiety so I'll just\nconstantly wake up I probably Rick\naround 6:00 like 4 to 6 times a night\nand and then sometimes I can't just I\ncan't go back to bed so so tell me what\nyou mean by anxiety\nI think it's anxiety I mean it's my\nstomach is feels like it's turning and\nthen it's like I almost feel like I did\nan ab workout during while I'm sleeping\nokay that's what I feel so stomach feels\nturning so you feel queasy it's it's not\nlike I feel sick I feel like it's like\nmy like if you like flex your abs like\nthat's how it feels like I I feel like I\ndid that the entire time I'm sleeping\nare you dreaming yes so what I always\ndream what kind of dreams are you having\noh the most ridiculous dreams ever I had\na dream there like I had a dream\nyesterday that I had a wheelbarrow that\nwas electric that cuz that was going\ndown my streets and then people were\ntrying to find me or something I don't\neven remember the whole story but I just\nremember I I was really just driving\naround electric wheelbarrow and and when\npeople were trying to find you was there\nsome sort of fearful emotion around that\nlike did you not want to be found I\nremember I don't\nI don't think I was even that worried\nbecause I was in a wheelbarrow to be\nhonest with you I think my one thing\nthat would make me feel weird it was my\none friend while I was dream while I was\ndreaming my friend took my stream and\nwent live on it and I got really angry\nat him I don't know if that would make\nme like my stomach turn though that's in\nthe dream mm-hmm okay so that didn't\nactually happen but you dreamed about\nbeing you dreamed about dreaming and\nyour friend going live on your stream\nyeah okay so so it sounds like you felt\nangry with him in the dream well yeah\nokay then I woke up okay and and so so\nyour your dreams like I don't know how\nelse can you tell me about like another\none just ran like it does it the details\nactually aren't that important just if\nsomething comes into mind if you can't\ntell me about another one that's fine\nlike if nothing comes to mind that's\nokay I'm just trying to detect patterns\nif there are any but you dream all night\nlong basically yeah like my dreams are\nmake no sense they're really stupid but\nI do dream every single all the time all\nright whatever I wake up and like wow\nthat she was terrible and then I go back\nto bed but I it's never like nightmares\nit's never like oh why was just like a\nnightmare it's usually just something on\nthe lines of just something happening in\nmy dream it's like I I know two years\nago I would have the same kind of dream\nand I wouldn't feel queasy I've never\nhad this feeling of my ABS hurting at\nnight oh and I'm the street I'm trying\nto sleep okay and do you have trouble\nfalling to sleep not\nreally that bad honestly it's not a\ntrouble falling asleep I just don't\nthink I get deep sleep ever I I feel\nlike I am very light sleeper like I'll\nwake up and it's like one of my\nroommates opens the fridge so I I'm a\nvery light sleeper and it's really bad I\njust can't sleep at night and it's\ndefinitely affecting my stream I mean\nyou can see bags into my eyes so so miss\ngift what can you tell me about your\nsleeping environment it's it's pretty\ndark it's ah I wish I had a picture of\nit I I think I definitely do it's it's\njust it's in my closet it's it's just\nthe bed that it literally is just the\nbed in the closet and that's it okay\nclose do and it's pitch-black deep okay\nso your bed is in your closet yeah so\nit's like this\nthat's my bed this is my closet and\nthat's the door\ngotcha and do you do you have like do\nyou listen to music or anything before\nyou fall asleep or have a noise machine\nor anything like that\nmm-hmm nothing you have a given re are\nyou hot when you sleep sometimes but not\noften because if it's a closet it must\nnot have like like ventilation right it\ndoes okay\ninteresting yeah you you're in Texas is\nthat right mm-hmm okay have you ever\nslept with a weighted blanket I have\nthree okay and tell me about your\nexperience with weighted blankets they I\nit's the last March I used to get\nterrible anxiety I had horrible anxiety\nevery night it was this the anxiety I\nget it now is like 70% reduced ever\nsince I started taking what was I taking\nI forget um I forgot what I take an\nantidepressant\nI forget what antidepressants called\nokay it's like the very common one you\nprobably know what it is\nZoloft lexapro lexapro prozac so ever\nsince I started taking that it's been\nreduced like 70% I would say but back in\nlike last year around April right like\nin May my anxiety was terrible I've\nalways had bad knotting bad anxiety but\nI always kick in my sleep a lot so I I\ngot an ADHD or I got one of those\nblankets and it's helped me a lot like a\nlot so I have three of them now are they\ndifferent weights yeah so one's 15 ones\n22 and ones 20 how much do you weigh if\nyou don't want to be asking 170 and\nwhich one do you which one do you find\nworks the best for you probably the 20\ncuz I used the 22 for a while and it was\na way to heavy weight so just a quick\nrule of thumb for what kind of weight\nyou want for a weighted blanket you want\nto be 10 to\n10 to 12 percent of your body weight so\nmy had to you know recommend one for you\nwould be 20 pounds yes interesting okay\nso I I was gonna say you're the first\nperson that I've talked to that has like\ndifferent weights cuz usually what I you\nknow people come and I say like why\ndon't you get away to blanket get one\nthat's ten to twelve percent of your\nbody weight and then they just get you\nknow that so that's that's interesting\ninteresting that you know I've tried\nmultiple ones in the 10 to 12 percent\nrange actually works best for you yeah\nno they 822 is way too heavy and I was\nnoticing that I was having trouble\nbreathing when I was sleeping cuz I'm\nlike hey just wait was very important\nyeah and then the light the 15-pound was\nokay but it was is like I was pretty\nmuch Goldilocks and the three bears or\nwhatever it is yeah you know 24/7 yeah\nit's just right that's great okay so so\nit sounds like you don't actually have\ntrouble falling asleep it sounds like\nyour sleep is disturbed and then you\nwake up and then you feel a lot of 10th\nis attention and your yeah it's it's\ntensions the word it's really bad and I\nnoticed that every night it feels like\nmy abs are like I I just feel like I did\nan ab workout and it happens multiple\ntimes throughout the night are you\nworried about something\nsomething that's really on my mind that\nI'm worrying about all the time\nstreaming I mean that's like the one\nthing I would say I worry about a lot of\nstreaming okay and how many of your\nwakening x' happen after a dream during\na dream usually during a dream usually\nmm-hmm is it I usually be dreaming and\nthen it will happen like almost be at\nthe beach I remember okay I remember one\nI was at the beach and there was like a\n70 foot wave that was coming and it was\nthe middle of the summer and I was in\nthe water but I didn't give a crap and\nthere was and the beach the waves came\nand crashed but and then I woke up but I\ndidn't I wasn't scared you weren't\nscared in the dream or you weren't\nscared when you woke up I wasn't scared\nin the dream hmm can I think for a\nsecond\nokay so miss gif I've got a couple of\ndifferent options for you\nall right they range from various\namounts of like conservative and like\nsafe stuff to talk about to like wild\nand imaginative okay okay so one one\noption so first of all I don't know that\nwhat you're feeling is anxiety okay\nthat's just what you're describing\nactually feels to me to be tension\nbecause you're not like so anxiety when\nI think about anxiety I think about\nworry I think about thinking about the\nfuture like generally speaking people\nwho have anxiety or worried about what's\ngonna happen the weirdest thing is that\nso usually people who have anxiety have\ntrouble falling asleep yeah I have no\nproblem falling asleep because their\ntheir mind is active keeps them awake\nthey're like worrying about the next day\nthey're worrying about this worrying\nabout that and they have trouble falling\nasleep you're not actually describing\nthat the other thing about anxieties\nanxiety does affect the stomach but it\nusually affects it in terms of like\nqueasiness as opposed to like tension\nmmm the other thing is that there seems\nto be so I'm not so sure how much\nanxiety like fits with what you're\ndescribing which may be it is anxiety\nbut it's kind of like you're not using\nsome of this more standard language for\nanxiety now I understand that you do\nhave anxiety around the stream so one\noption is that we can assume that this\nanxiety is maybe related to like some\nkind of subconscious anxiety about\nstream we can talk about your concerns\naround streaming we can try to help you\nwith some of that anxiety sounds like\nthat would be like a pretty good use of\nour time and then the hope there would\nbe that generally speaking is the mind\nbecomes more calm in the waking world\nand as the the you know is there's a\nweight off of your mind then your sleep\nwill become more peaceful that's kind of\nlike a no-brainer\nI feel like it's it's a lot I feel like\nit's a lot that I have a lot of uh I\nfeel a lot of stress all the time when\nit comes to streaming and when it comes\nto my life and maybe that is making my\nthis is this was my thought it was that\nI have a lot of stress constantly and\nand I'm super stressed and I'm thinking\nabout streaming all the time because the\nthing is I think the average person when\nthey work right like my dad when he goes\nto work\nhe what he's done with work it's done\nwhen he's done with work he goes to bed\nor he goes home and he watches CNN and\nhe yells the TV went for me I don't ever\nget off work my job streaming is a\nlifestyle it's something where my life\nis streaming I am Miss Kip 24/7 and\nwhile there's a lot of product so that\nthat I really do enjoy there is pieces\nof it that are bad and I think me\nworrying about stuff be worrying about\nstreaming me worrying about if I need to\ndo this what am I going to do tomorrow\nyou know am I still doing this am I good\nenough for this\nI think worrying about all that stuff\nconstantly is is and then I like being\nstressed all day is making me wake up in\nthe middle of the night yeah I think\nthat makes a lot of sense so it sounds\nlike that's maybe what we should talk\nabout today yeah okay so tell me a\nlittle bit about what it's like to\nconstantly be thinking about streaming\nit's uh I don't mind it really sometimes\nwhen I think about the idea of always\nthinking about streaming and always\nthinking about twitch I I don't mind it\nbut sometimes it does suck like you know\nI'm always stressed if I'm like if I\nshould stream or what I need to do for\nstreaming and I think a lot of like\ncompetitive streamers I guess you can\ncall them or people that care about the\nstreams a lot professional streamers\ncare and it's because they they have\nfears that I think are irrational\nsometimes but the fear of you know\nbecoming irrelevant the fear of one day\nyou turn on your stream and no one's\nthere\nthe fear that you know you're not you're\nnot good enough anymore you know you're\nare you really entertaining anymore is\ndo people really care about you mm-hm\nand those kind of fears constantly our\nlumen lumen ating or looming me looming\nyeah and it scares the crap out of me\nand I think about it all day so you're\nafraid that you know right now you're\nstreaming and and you have viewers and\nstuff but that\nit one day you know that's gonna your\nviewership will drop off right like you\ncan't stay relevant forever I feel like\nit's like I it's almost like vines in in\na in a jungle and I feel like I've been\ntrying to grab on to I'm like constantly\ntrying to grab on the vines every day\nI'm barely surviving it's how I feel\nokay so what I'm hearing from you is\nlike kind of a complete lack of security\nin your future right it's not so much\nabout success day to day and it's about\nlike when you wake up in the morning and\nget sort of like you know actually what\nit sounds like\nmiss gift do you watch football no okay\nyou know what a Hail Mary is yeah it's\nlike every play is a Hail Mary right\nyeah yeah yeah that's exactly it feels\nlike every day is like L Miriam you know\nam I actually gonna even be a bit like\nyeah yeah I couldn't think of anything\nno I mean I think it sounds awful\nactually like so what I'm also hearing\nfrom you is that you're living life on\nthe edge right like it's you're you're\nkind of like you're just right on the\nprecipice and if things don't work out\nyou know if you get a couple bad streams\nthan like your viewership drops and this\nhappens and then this happens like\nyou're kind of on the edge of the cliff\nand like there's there's there's never\nno matter how successful you are it's it\nseems to me like it's it's basically\nimpossible from for you to move away\nfrom the edge of the cliff yeah and I\nfeel like a lot of that angst comes from\nwhen I grew a lot last year when I grew\na lot less year in May I started to feel\nlike you know when you double your view\ncount overnight it becomes something\nlike are these people really there for\nme or are they there because of the hype\nand I am terrified that they're going to\njust leave one day and then people are\njust going to [ __ ] on me and be like oh\nyou know you suck like you're dead\nstream and blah blah blah all that stuff\nI think it's not a fun thing to think\nabout it scares me because I don't want\nthem to leave you know I don't want to\ngo back\n- I feel like I've worked so hard and to\ngo back to like half of what I had or\nsomething like that really scares me\nokay yeah can I think for a second\nmm-hmm can you tell me about what what\nit was like to grow so quickly it was\nit's just pressure and it just comes\ndown to pressure and stress because\npeople are constantly thinking that you\nneed to and it's the thing is I don't\neven know if it's people thinking this\nor if it's just me over analyzing it but\nI I constantly feel like I need to be\nentertaining or I constantly feel like I\nneed to be doing something or you know\nthey're just gonna leave and never come\nback or I feel like that you know that\nthey they just think that I need to come\nI need to constantly be I guess the word\nis entertaining and it's just stressful\nand I don't control how entertaining you\nare yeah for sure\nI mean I've seen well III think I mean\nyou can ask my friends off stream but I\nI do always try to entertain there's not\na moment besides I guess right now\nwhere I am NOT trying to entertain I'm\nalways trying to make people laugh it's\nit's my life it's been my life since I\nwas a kid was - trying to make people\nlaugh okay so so that's not the question\nthat I asked though so I don't ask can\nyou try to be entertaining I asked can\nyou control how entertaining you are\nwhat do you mean by that so trying to be\nentertaining is like sort of an effort\nor an action controlling how\nentertaining you are is about an outcome\nbeing\nentertaining is not actually like is\nabout other people's perception of\nwhether you're entertaining or not it\nhas nothing to do it's not the same as\nyour efforts right so like there's a\ndifference between I tell 10 jokes a day\nto try to be funny and I tell 10 funny\njokes a day Oh does that make sense\nmm-hmm yeah so I would say can I control\nif I'm funny or not now so can you\ncontrol whether you're entertaining or\nnot know maybe like it's some days I\nhave it some days I just don't give a\n[ __ ]\nit's really weird which makes sense\nright because I think that's why like so\nif I had to put myself in your shoes and\nI realized deep down that I actually do\nnot control how entertaining I am it\nlogically leads to your fears of\neveryday as a Hail Mary because you\nactually can't control what if you it's\ntrue right make sense because you can't\ncontrol whether they're gonna laugh and\nhere you are spending every waking and\nsleeping moment trying to figure out how\nto make them laugh yeah that's actually\nvery true and you think I got to think\nmore if I think I think I think I think\nI think you're the quarterback who looks\nat the field and says I got to throw a\nHail Mary and every waking minute you're\nthinking how can I make sure that this\nHail Mary gets caught yeah and if I\nthink harder and if I think during my\nsleep and if I think when I'm taking a\n[ __ ] if I think about it worry about it\nstress about it how can I make sure that\nthat Hail Mary wins the reality is they\ncan't say I the more you think about\ntrying to be funny like this I I don't\nremember anything from when I was a kid\nI just don't\nI just remember I was a piece of [ __ ]\nbut I remember why one friend Danny\nhe always he always asked me he's like\nhow do you make everybody laugh or how\ndo you always how are you\nalways being funny and I said to him I\nsaid the key to being funny is don't try\nand that's the problem that he had I was\nlike you always are trying to be funny\nand no one is gonna laugh because you're\ntrying or you're caring too much you're\ntrying to think about it and I think\nback then it doesn't it's different then\ncompared to being extremely right\nbecause I feel that being a streamer I\nalways need to be entertaining\nespecially ever since I grew massively\nbut the reality is in being funny you\ncan't always be funny right it's like if\neverything is good then you know if\neverything is considered everything is\ngood then it's not good it's just\naverage right you want to make sure that\nyour jokes are funny you want to make\nsure that you're being funny and not it\nalmost sounds like you also want to make\nsure that there are times where you're\nnot funny\nwell you because it's it's important to\nnot force it right I mean if I'm telling\njokes seven hours a day or I'm trying to\nbe funny for seven hours it doesn't work\nyou can't be that no one is like that\nand it's you know it's it's not a\nreality but I try to be as much as\npossible entertaining and sometimes I\nfeel like I'm almost like I'm trying to\nforce it when it's just not there and it\nstresses me because I I think that\nthat's that you what you said is exactly\nI think about it all day every day and\nit goes into my sleep where I'm thinking\nabout it all day every day that I need\nto be entertaining because streaming is\na 24/7 job and I feel like I need to be\ndoing that when I was always like that I\nmean I always was thinking that I need\nto be entertaining but not to the point\nnow because you know back then if I went\nto my friend's house and just played\nhalo and I didn't feel like making a\njoke no one gave a [ __ ] well nowadays if\nI go live and I play video games super\nlike why aren't you being funny like\nwhat are you doing like they're like\npoking a stick at me like dance monkey\nhow does that feel\n[Music]\nnot the best but I mean it comes with\nthe job you know you got a you got to do\nwhat you got to do so the misc if I want\nto kind of come back to this core point\nyeah I mean you shared a lot of stuff\nabout you know being funny and trying\nand in controlling and and sort of I was\nkind of confused because I felt like you\nwere saying all the stuff that I'm\nsupposed to say which what part because\nthat I probably think about this all the\ntime yeah does that make sense like I\nfeel like you told yourself exactly what\nit's my job to tell you which is that\nyou can't control the Hail Mary yeah\nit's nice to hear from you though cuz\nyou're I mean you know it like yeah I\ndidn't even say it like you said it\nright you're thinking about your friend\nand it's almost like you're drawing a\nparallel between who you are now and who\nyour friend used to be yeah that\nsuddenly use somewhere along the way you\nstarted trying okay actually you've\nalways tried somewhere along the way you\nbecame trapped by the expectation of\nbeing funny yeah that's it you let\nyourself be bound by it and what you\nused to do is used to just be you yeah\nit was easy to be you and people saw\nthat and then they loved it and you grew\nand somewhere along the way you stopped\nbeing you and you started pretending to\nbe you yeah yeah you started trying to\nbecome the person that they that\nattracted them in the first place which\nis kind of weird because that's sort of\nyou but it's not actually you right you\nstarted instead of being yourself you\nstarted living like up to this like\nideal mischief which is actually like a\nmythological thing like that's not a\nreal thing man because what they saw was\nyou and I think probably that I've\nnoticed this like time and time again\nbecause I talked to a fair number of\nstreamers I don't know if it's a\nselection bias but I think part of what\nattracts people to twitch is not seeing\nsomeone perfect\nit's seeing someone flawed mm-hmm right\nand and I think that this is kind of\nthis is wild because I think miss Kaif\nunfortunately the real problem here is\nthat actually you're [ __ ] smart guy\nthe real problem is that your mind is\nable to see futures for you and perform\ncalculations so many calculations where\nyou crash and burn so one thing I've\nseen about anxiety is the smarter you\nare the worst liang's ideas mmm yeah\nnegativo\nand and so your mind is like calculating\nall of these different options like if\nyou don't do this and if you don't do\nthis and if you don't do this and what\nyou're looking for is the answer right\nyou've got you're like you're a\nquarterback with a five head and you're\nthinking about wind speed and this and\nthat how can I calculate to make sure\nthis pass gets caught but the truth is\nyou can't it's a now misc if we come to\nsomething that's really really wild\nterrifying and crazy which is surrender\nin life you do not control the outcomes\nyou only control your efforts and if you\nwant to be at peace with yourself\nunderstand that the more you stress when\nyou talk about stress what you're trying\nto do is control an outcome it's like\nyou're you're into a girl and you want\nto say the perfect thing to get her to\nsay yes when you ask her out\nhow can I make her say yes in your mind\nlike does backflips and loops and your\ndrawing on chalkboards and your\ncalculating things out and you're taking\nnotes you're stressing about your\nthinking about it thinking about it\nthinking about it thinking about it\nthinking about it because there are\nthese possibilities and one day like how\ncan you figure out a formula so that\nevery day when you stream you're funny\nand people like it and they're gonna\ncontinue to grow and they'll never\nabandon you and you can have security\nfor the rest of your life you are\nsetting up a problem for yourself that\nis so impossible to solve but at the\nsame time you're a smart guy and you\nrely on solving problems you've trusted\nyourself because your whole life you've\nactually been plagued with difficulties\nand yet your mind Feisal\nfinds a way to overcome them whether\nit's a TD in school or this or that or\nwhatever like you've always found a way\nyou've relied on your mind it's\nincredibly powerful it's always showed\nyou a way to like move forward and now\nyou come to the unsolvable problem the\nconstant stress of how do I make sure\nthey stay and you're in an in in an\nindustry where you can't yeah so the\nbizarre thing here is and I think you\nsort of have the first half of the\nanswer yourself which is like what you\ntold your friend is that you can't\nactually guarantee that they're gonna\ncome you can't guarantee that they're\ngonna stay and you can't guarantee that\nyou're gonna be funny and stress as much\nas you want to you cannot control the\noutcomes of your actions and so this is\nterrifying because what what this means\nis that for you to be at peace you have\nto give up control so there is a way\nforward which is that you try to be\nyourself right so like this I know this\nsounds crazy but I know exactly what\nyou're talking about\nhmm because this is where you've had it\nsimilarly right absolutely right from 0\nto 18 thousand viewers in two months\nyeah\nit's terrifying and like I struggled too\nand so the difference between me and\nmany other streamers is I am so [ __ ]\nlucky that I've spent 15 years\nmeditating before I started my first\nstream mmm so I have some tools in my\ntool kit and I've learned certain things\nand the first is that as a human being\nyou learn this in medicine real [ __ ]\nquick it's not just meditation it's also\nin medicine that I can try I can care\nabout a patient as much as I want to I\ncannot save them mm-hmm you just can't\ncontrol like I can I can study I can\nwork but at the end of the day the\ndoctors who get torn alive by themselves\nare the ones who try to control whether\nthey can save a life or not\nthat's terrifying them what's terrifying\nabout it you know it goes back to the\nstreaming thing it's just the\npossibility that you can if you don't if\nyou if you lose what you had or if\nyou're not yourself anymore you can just\nit goes away what goes away everybody\nyour success does people this is where\nyou got to be a little bit careful with\nyour thinking okay because misc if your\nyours twitch success may go go away but\nyou won't go away and now you have\nanother problem where who you are is\ngetting tangled up with twitch you are\nstarting to derive a sense of value and\npurpose related to your viewer count\nwhich unfortunately is exactly how\nsocial media operates like it's not I\ndon't think that it's like diabolical I\ndon't think they designed it like this\nbut it's just like when you see your\nviewer account like you have an\nobjective measure of your value as a\nhuman being and that's becoming like\nit's terrifying but like you know human\nbeings like if you look at a tribe of\nApes they have sort of like a social\nstanding but it's nebulous right there's\nno like there's no quantitative it's not\nlike like a troupe of chimpanzees have\nlike numbers stamped on their head about\nlike what their value in the tribe is\ndoes that make sense yeah and that's how\nwe used to be - right so like used to\nlike if you think about you know 50\nyears ago sure some people were rich and\nsome people had nice cars but some\npeople were really good at making\nbrownies and some people were super nice\nand some people had kids that were like\ngreat at playing the violin and so our\nsense of worth was like really really\nnebulous and so we had some degree of\ncomfort in that because like there's no\nway to like rank like the quality of\nbrownie versus like making ten thousand\nmore dollars in a year yeah you can't\nyou just can't compare that whereas now\nwhat's happened is life has given us a\nway to stamp a number on her forehead\nabout what we're worth\nI also feel like an issue with that is\nit's not only that we're stamping a\nnumber that were worth it's the social\nclimb never ends you know it's that you\nknow like I was content with what I had\na year ago but I wanted a little bit\nmore and I still said that today you\nknow it's it never ends and I'm sure if\nI grow it's still gonna I'm still gonna\nwant more because there's always out\nthere\nexcellent so I'm glad you recognized\nthat you're actually in a good spot\nmiss-ghetti mmm so I also work with\npeople who are you know have net worth\nsome hundred million five hundred\nmillion billion dollars some of them\nwant more it's never enough\nand so now we get to a couple of really\ncore principles so the first is that\nsatisfaction doesn't come from the\noutside it comes from within\nit is much of like a hippie yoga hippy\nOprah kind of thing that that's a like\nthat's literally how it works yeah all\nright and and it's wild to actually\nthink about it second thing is you\ncannot control the outcomes of your\nactions you can only control your\nactions what do you think about that you\ncan't control\nthe outcome of your actions you can only\ncontrol your actions so you can it goes\nback to what you said about making jokes\nor doing things it's you you can't\ncontrol it you can you can you can't\ncontrol if they're gonna laugh or not\nyou just gotta be you\nexactly very good so I'm glad you\nclarified what it is what you control is\nwhether you make a joke and what the\njoke is you do not control whether they\nlaugh yeah this is a terrifying and\ntransformative realization for you to\nembrace fully because our whole life our\nour society and our system of\nfunctioning is based on the idea that\nyou can control the outcomes of your\nactions it's just terrifying cuz what's\nterrifying about it good that means you\nunderstand at Misgav what still you know\nit i I it's the idea that people put me\non this like pedestal of like what I\nneed to be which is like this streamer\nthat you know it always has to be\nentertaining or funny and stuff like\nthat and well a lot of times I feel like\nI am but there's some times where I'm\nnot and I it's terrifying because I\ndon't want to lose them I don't I don't\nwant to lose my people because of they\nthey have too high of expectations very\ngood so two really important things that\nyou said there the first understand this\nyou are trying to live up to the\nexpectation in the mind of a viewer and\ntwitch at at that not just a regular\nviewer twitch at right well just is i\nI've asked them and and I've I've also\nbeen a twitch viewer and seven years\neight years and I know that they just\nthey don't even care like I they don't\ngive a [ __ ]\nexcellent like I I have asked them for\nthey\nhave I I've been there and you know\nstreamers are complaining or thinking\nabout stuff and as a viewer they're just\nlike what are you on about like you are\nfine nothing is a problem we don't care\nbeautiful next step so what I said is\nactually false okay the expectation that\nyou are trying to live up to is the\nexpectation of what you imagine twitch\nat thinks about you yeah it's not\nactually them it's you the expectation\nthat you fail to live up to is the one\nthat you create for yourself it's not\ncoming from the rest of the world yeah\nyou torture yourself by your own\nexpectation it's created by your mind\nbecause twitch chat is actually lovely\nthey're like wonderful people like I\nknow it's crazy no I like I've I I've\ndone plenty of streams for I'm like a\nyou know oh I hang out with my offline\nchat a lot and I'll be like that was a\nterrible stream they're like dude what\nare you one of that was fine I'm like no\nlike it was bad and it's my expectations\nor I think that I didn't do enough I\ndidn't say enough jokes I didn't try to\nbe funny I wasn't saying stuff like it\nwas fine like it was a good stream okay\nhaven't flown good so let's file that\naway because I think the problem is that\nwhen you get that kind of data it like\npasses through you right yeah you're\nlike you you have like a strainer you're\nlike a colander that catches all the bad\nthoughts and lets the positivity flow\nthrough like water the bad thoughts are\nthe pasta and the water are the good\nthoughts and all the reasons that you\nshould trust in your success the fact\nthat you've grown like what you think\nyou've been faking it\nfor a year for two years yeah I haven't\nbeen scamming people no actually what\nyou've been is right that's what they're\nthey're they're latching on to is you\nand then somewhere along the way like\ninstead of just having fun with it which\nis what is responsible for your eyes you\ncreate an expectation for yourself you\ntry to live up to that expectation and\nthereby you [ __ ] yourself do constant\nstress how can I be the Miss gif of\nbefore\nin that what you're looking for is\nsecurity you want them to stay here's\nthe crazy thing you can't make them stay\nin the same way that a doctor cannot\nsave a life in the same way that even\nover the course of this hour I can't\nhelp you hmm\ndo you understand that like when I when\nI was a little horse to order absolutely\nand and they're gonna do what they're\ngonna do and so the other thing that's\nterrifying about this is use the word\nwant that's the problem you want and I\nwould guess that when you started\nstreaming you actually didn't want no I\nwanted okay I want it really bad okay so\nthat's something to be further explored\nbut I think your desire or your\nexpectation so let's stick with\nexpectation so I'm wrong about the one\nbut we can explore that later let's kind\nof stick with this idea of expectation\nso I want you to understand this like\nwhat what effect does expectation have\non an experience for a human being so\nlet's just like pick movies for example\nlike if I have an expectation about a\nmovie what does that do to my like\nexperience of the movie you well if you\nexpect something then it's probably if\nyou think oh it's gonna be really good\nthen if it doesn't live up to that\nstandard or close you're gonna hate it\nand what if it does live up to that\nstandard it won't be as good what if I\nexpect nothing from that movie it's\nprobably better if you think like the\nmovies gonna suck and then you go into\nit and it's actually really good yeah\nunder they go wow those really good\nmovie\nso I remember have you ever seen a movie\ncalled what we do in the shadows I never\nwatch movies okay so I I had no idea\nwhat this movie was like no idea and I\njust watched it and I like absolutely\nloved it even if I knew it's the kind of\nmovie that if you know anything about it\nI think the more you know about it\nbefore you watch the worse it's gonna be\nhmm and so let's just think about this\nfor a second right so now like you're\nsuffering misg if you get that\nyou're suffering intensely in the size\nof your expectations has grown and as\nyour expectations grow your suffering\ngross and the reason that you expect is\nbecause you want security from the\nfuture you're trying to literally just\nthink about this or thing what I'm gonna\nsay sounds crazy out of the context is\nconversation you are trying to control\nthe future\nyes can you control the future\nno so the earlier that you accept that\nso this is where we get to surrender\nokay so if the Yogi's say is for someone\nwho is filled with expectation the\nsolution is surrender surrender\nsurrender surrender acknowledge that you\ncan't control the future acknowledge\nthat there's nothing you can say to make\nthat girl fall in love with you\nacknowledge that you can't make the Hail\nMary acknowledge that there's no way to\nguarantee success and that\nacknowledgement is [ __ ] terrifying\nbecause it's all of your worst fears\nright but something something bizarre\nhappens when you surrender is you start\nto feel at peace the other bizarre thing\nthat I've seen over and over and over\nagain is your life actually does get\nbetter materialistically\nhow do I surrender them so I think you\njust think you focus on the action\ninstead of the outcome so every day miss\ngift the most that you can do is like\nstream and do the best that you can if\nthere's some amount of thinking about\nstuff off stream that's fine like if you\nhave to work off stream to improve your\nstream then so be it\nbut understand that like focusing on the\noutcome and stressing about whether\nyou're gonna be good or not is actually\nlike that doesn't you can't be good\nlike understand that like no matter how\nhard you try and how much you think it's\nnot up to you so some people surrender\nthrough God or the idea of God right so\nthey like put things like on God and\nthey kind of acknowledge that there's a\nhigher power like you see this in a a so\nlike what it's kind of interesting\nbecause a a like really helps people\nstay sober you know what a is alcoholic\nseems and the funny thing about like a a\nis like they achieve sobriety with like\nfoundation of that they're like a flawed\nhuman being and like they're not going\nto be able to do it that's actually\nwhere they start but something bizarre\nhappens to your psychology once you\naccept that you're not in control and\nthat failure is a real possibility and\nthen what happens because the problem\nwith alcoholics is like they [ __ ] up\nwhen they think they're in control does\nthat make sense\nmm-hmm so the more that they think they\ncan handle it the worse off they do and\nwhen they start to accept that they\ncan't control it\nthat they can't handle it they start to\ntreat the alcohol with respect and they\nstay away from it so in a bizarre way\ndoes that make sense kind of it's\nbizarre it's paradoxical it's not how\nour mind usually works and so for a lot\nof people this is like religion and so\nit doesn't it doesn't have to be\nreligion by the way I'm just using these\nas examples so some people will\nsurrender to God so they'll say like\nokay like you know I really want this\njob but I'm gonna pray in God if it's\nlike if it's in line with what you want\nfor me then wonderful I'll be happy but\nthey kind of like let go of their\ncontrol yeah and I've worked really hard\nfor this but at the same time if it is\nin your Divine Will then Soviet so they\ngo down that route so that's like one\nway you can do it the interesting thing\nis that you know it doesn't have to be\nGod it's just the idea that you\nacknowledge that you are not in control\nof the future that you can't make the\nhell marylande\nyou can't make a woman fall in love with\nyou that's the important thing is just\nunderstand that like every day when you\nwake up you cannot street you can't\ncreate a success on stream you can only\ngive what you have to give yeah it's\nlike enjoyment yep doesn't show me like\nI feel like that's pretty much how it is\nor it's like the expectation that I put\nit's it's not even them which is crazy\nlike they don't care but I put this\nexpectation it's super high for me and\nthen but this is the reality where it's\nlike sometimes I will meet the\nexpectations and like I will do whatever\nbut I always I'm constantly thinking\nabout it I think this is what probably\nalso doesn't help me sleep is I'm\nconstantly thinking about it all day\nevery day which actually makes this go\nlower\nbecause like I said when I told my\nfriend Danny where it's like if you try\nyou're never funny if you try anything\nno one's gonna laugh cuz it's not funny\nyou could tell what a jokes forced you\ncould tell when something's not\nauthentic and the that actually makes\nthis go lower and this expectation is\nnot gonna be met you know this is the\nreality and what I have to realize is\nthis is it and it will never be this it\ncan't be this as much as I think about\nit all day when I think about it gets\nworse but as much as I think about it\nall day it this can and will never\nhappen of my expectations and I just\nhave to understand that I am pretty much\nhuman and I don't know if this is also\naffected because of my II do like my ego\nabsolutely yeah he goes absolutely tied\ninto their crap right so right sorry I\nknow you believe it like because because\nwhen you said like what I have to accept\nis that I'm human that's not what your\nego thinks miss gif you're miss gift is\nnot your ego does not expect of you to\nbe human it expects of you to be\nsuperhuman yeah I I expect myself I'm\nlike a yeah right I am the God that\npeople pray to there's like that I don't\nthink my phone that's that I so so so\nthis is where they're a couple of other\nthings okay so I'm gonna give you a\ncouple of analogies so a lot of this the\ngood news I mean there's good and bad\nnews here the good news is that you can\nfix this and most of this is going on in\nyour mind the bad news is because it's\ngoing on in your mind it's harder to fix\nthan something is that is going on\noutside of your mind yeah it's like you\nknow hardware and software yeah but I\nmean like sometimes if there's a bad\nsituation it's external and it's\nrelatively easy to fix fixing yourself\nis sometimes harder okay so here a\ncouple of things so like let me put it\nto you this way so when I select like\nlet's just think about a doctor right so\nlike a doctor who's working in an\nemergency room like when a patient comes\nin let's say you've got a motor vehicle\naccident and like they've got broken\nbones and like you know their heart\ncontusions and things like that you know\nthe doctor is going to do a free\nthat they can but they can't control\nwhether that person survives or doesn't\nright you just do the best that you can\nyou give of yourself what you are as\ncompletely as you can and you leave the\nrest and I'm just gonna use this\nphrasing because I think it's like easy\nto conceptualize you leave the rest up\nto God right you don't have to believe\nin God but you can just say you do the\nmost that you can you leave the rest up\nto fate entropy randomness chaos theory\nGod whatever whatever right there that\nthere's a limit to what you're capable\nof and the rest of it is responsible\nsomeone else is responsible for and I\nthink religious people sort of figured\nthat out right so they called it God and\nand the other thing that you you have to\nremember miss Kipp is that like I think\nthe other real solution here for you is\nI think instead of thinking about ego\nand being someone I I would really try\nto encourage you to reframe what you're\ndoing is service really so like your\nyou're not streaming for yourself you're\nnot streaming to live up to an\nexpectation you're gonna show up and try\nto help people as best as you can okay I\nso like that actually could help yeah so\nlike teenage suicide rate has gone up by\n50 percent in the last decade the\npercentage of people who are NEETs not\nin education employment and training is\nin an all-time high climate change to\nprior mental health has now surpassed\ncardiovascular disease and cancer in the\nUnited States is the most expensive\norgan so more people there's more loss\nof productivity and morbidity and\nmortality so the disease burden of\nmental health is now number one we've\nwe've we've bypassed the effects of like\nMickey D's and and sodas and cancer and\ncigarettes and all that good stuff so\nwe're number one and understand that you\nactually fulfill a very important role\nfor these people right which is like our\npeople is people like you which is that\nthey come to your stream and they're\nlooking for entertainment but they're\nalso looking to like have their day be a\nlittle bit better they want to take a\nbreak from their\nit's almost like they come to hang out\nabsolutely yeah and and they're not\nthere for a show they're there for me\nyeah\nbeautifully put right and so should you\ntry to cheer them up\nabsolutely they're coming to hang out\nyou want to make sure that they have a\ngood time that's fine but understand\nthat like you can't make him have a good\ntime right they have to meet you halfway\nand that's the most that you can do you\ncan just be yourself let go of the\nconsequences of your actions and focus\non what you do the other cool thing\nabout this is there's a beautiful source\nof pride over focusing on your actions\nbecause that's something you can control\nwhen you sleep at night the question\nisn't how many lives did I save today or\nhow many of my patients did I die\nit did died today the question is did I\ndo the best that I can\ndid I like study hard did I pay\nattention am I going to learn from today\nand is it going to make me a better\nperson tomorrow because the patients are\ngonna come tomorrow the viewers are\ngonna come tomorrow tomorrow is gonna\ncome so did you do everything that you\ncan today to make the most of it to\nenrich these people's lives like\nunderstand that people who watch twitch\nsometimes when they watch twitch they\ndecide not to kill themselves like\nthat's a real thing like it's crazy\nright like there are people who watch\nwho are suicidal and something about the\nconnections that we form with each other\nonline keep us from killing ourselves\nit's the biggest thing that I think like\nthe boomers don't get they talk about\nlike all of the evils of social media\nlike I do because now we have good ways\nto stamp like a value to herself and so\nit enhances our shame but the other\namazing thing is that there's connection\nand there's hope and there's strength\nand there are people who get to know you\nand they're people who are connected to\nyou there are people who love you I have\na feeling of love towards twit twit chat\nit was really confusing for a while and\nI was like do I really feel that how can\nI feel that I don't know I don't\nunderstand it but that's what I feel\nyeah that's why I do this it's what\nkeeps me like it's what helps me not\ncare about my viewer account because\nthere are times where I was like okay if\nmy viewer count drops does that mean I\nshould stop\ndo something else I'm like no what the\n[ __ ] is wrong with you like you're not\ndoing it for a viewer account you're\ndoing it because like you have something\nto share and if you can help even if my\nviewer account is one so be it it's\nabout helping not one person that was my\nexact that exactly he's to say good when\nI first started and I think I have\nnoticed what you said was true when the\nmore I I've noticed on days that I say I\nforget what I think or I forget what I\nsay a lot of times and then but\nsometimes people you like can jog my\nmemory and I've realized that a lot of\ntimes when I am thinking about not\nputting on a show but more so just like\nI'm there for them or I'm there to help\nthese people who you know one of these\npeople that I might answer their\nquestion in chat because I sometimes\nforget that I was like a huge pleb I was\nliterally just like them if not worse I\nyou know well I was alone yeah well in a\nlot of ways I'm similar to them and that\nI know that if I can view if a streamer\nread out my message I'm like as lame as\nit sounds and that's what just they want\nto make fun of that it does feel cool\nyou do get infinitive like oh like you\nknow it's a little bit of attention that\nthey might need throughout the day if\nthey got like no one that looks at them\nor no one that cares you know that that\nfeeling of maybe just hanging out with\nthem when playing a video game or just\nhanging out the more I think like that\nthe more I enjoy streaming because I\nfeel like it's not I don't I don't feel\nstressed these expectations are they\ndon't care about the readout they like\nthe reality the real person because that\nmight be why they're there you know so\nI'm sure there are a lot of you there\nare viewers that care about this\nexpectations be sure there hype viewers\nthey were there when I got banned but\nsomething I gotta realize is one that\nwas a year ago like these people that\nare here aren't here because Oh miss\ngive got banned we're here for the\nexcitement I mean I'm sure you know\nthey're there because of me because of\nmy reality\nyeah so now so yeah I think thing\nbiscuits so a couple things I'll kind of\nleave you with okay so the first is that\nI don't here wanting in there I have no\ndoubt that wanting is there but this is\nnot wanting does that make sense\nmm-hmm Bodeen by wanting that so I said\nearlier you kind of said oh I wanted it\nI have no doubt that you wanted it but\nthis is not wanting what we're talking\nabout is not wanting right label to go\non yeah so I think this is about kind of\nservice and it's about like devotion\nit's about like you know hanging out\nlike hanging out is not wanting it's\njust chilling like wanting is something\nelse like it's a desire for like a\nparticular thing or a particular outcome\nand I think so you ask you know how do I\nsurrender well I think you just go back\nto it right it's not about it's not\nabout going to a new place it's about\ngoing to an old place of like why you\ngot into the business to begin with like\nthat's the spirit that's the spirit that\nyou've got to keep alive right it's\nabout like hanging out with people and\ngaming like that's what we're here for\nthat's what twitch was born about and I\nhear like some people kind of complain\nbecause twitch is changing a lot and\nlike some of the spirit of like what\ntwitch was founded on has changed\nbecause people like me show up yeah I I\nthink I think yeah I hear that a lot too\nand also I was there I mean yeah so I\nthink Trident which now is really good\nthough I think people yeah I think it's\none plane yeah so I think the other\nthing that I you know for what this is\nworth I think that at some time you know\nat some point your twitch name like I\nhave I've just difficulty envisioning\nyou is like a 76 year old dude streaming\non Twitch like I just have difficult so\nlike I just don't think that that's\ngonna happen and so I think that your\nstream will probably have a lifespan\nbecause that's usually how things go and\nthis is crazy I think that's gonna be\nokay I think that this is a that things\nare gonna change for you things are\ngonna evolve a lot of people kind of\ntransition and I think that you're\ncapable of that transition too whenever\nit comes yeah right and so have faith in\nthe person that you are have faith in\nthe in the person that you're becoming\nand and that's you know that's that's it\nman surrender let go be what you are\ntoday instead of like trying to be\nsomething else and now something for\neveryone watching so I think this is\nhuge because I think out of all of the\nstreams that I've done this is the thing\nthat I think like relates to the what I\nsee is the biggest problems for people\nwho like reach out to me is understand\nthat expectation is what holds you back\nright understand that so much of why you\ndo not act in life is because you are\nwaiting to act you you're not gonna act\nuntil you can guarantee a result because\nwhen you were ashamed of yourself like\nif you were ashamed and you've never had\na girlfriend you can't handle a\nrejection which in turn means that like\nyou're gonna wait until you can make\nsomeone fall in love with you and when\nyou know you could make someone fall in\nlove with you then you're gonna ask them\nbecause that's the only way that if you\nfeel ashamed about yourself the only way\nthat you're willing to put yourself out\nthere is if you can guarantee a\nparticular result because if you're\nashamed and you can guarantee result\nthen you can do it because you don't\nhave to deal with your shame it proves\nthat you don't have to be ashamed\neverything is hunky-dory\neverything is good and so that reliance\non controlling the future and\nguaranteeing for yourself that you don't\nhave to deal with your shame you don't\nhave to deal with your failure you don't\nhave to deal with your rejection is what\nparalyzes you it keeps you from moving\nforward you are so concerned with being\na failure that you never try maturely\nright that's the crux of it and then\npeople say oh I don't have motivation no\nthe problem is not that you lack\nmotivation the problem is that you are\nso paralyzed as a failure that you're\nnot willing to act understand this very\ncarefully that is not a lack of\nmotivation it's not that you are not\nmotivated to act is that there is a more\npowerful force that paralyzes you from\naction yeah I I had that when I when I\nfirst I want to do YouTube videos and\nstream for or mainly YouTube I wanted to\nYouTube video since I was like 14 15 I\nwas like\nlike I always wanted to do it but I\nalways it was that feeling of what's the\npoint if it's just gonna be failure\nwhat's the point if I do this and then\nit's gonna fail like oh what if my\nfriends make fun of me and they're like\nwow you have a video that has 80 views\nlike you know I always felt that fear\nand then one day I just pretty much\npretty much said [ __ ] it I'm like you\nknow what I'm going to just try this if\nit fails it fails if it doesn't it\ndoesn't and then Here I am today\nso you know that idea of failure played\na big part in why I didn't try something\na decade earlier and I had to wait until\nI was in my mom's basement alone until I\nfinally said you know what I I'm gonna\ndo it now so you know when you say [ __ ]\nit you know what that is\nthat is surrender yeah [ __ ] it is\nsurrender you're right you get it yeah\nso this is for all of you at home who\nare watching who are feeling like you're\nnot motivated understand this very\nclearly it's not a lack of motivation\nand this is why cuz these people are\nsmart right like twitch hat is a super\nsmart and if you give them a problem to\nsolve they'll solve the problem the\nproblem is that you the problem that you\nthink you have is not the real problem\nand that's the other reason you're stuck\nyou look for solutions that increase\nyour motivation it's not an issue of\nmotivation you have motivation just stop\nand think about this for those of you\nwho want to transform your lives how\nmuch do you want to transform your life\non a scale of 0 to 100 it\na hundred the motivation is gigantic it\nis like the Mount Everest some\nmotivation you want to change so much\nwhat do you think that is that's\nmotivation but I understand that there's\na stronger force within you which is\nbigger than Everest\nit's k2 right and the k2 is your fear of\nfailure what's gonna do okay\nk2 is like a harder mountain to climb\nthan Everest I think Everest is actually\ntaller but Katie's like tougher so and\nso in your case I want you guys to pay\nattention to what Miss Kip is saying\nbecause Miss gif says he used to be a\npleb it's ego you're still a [ __ ]\nplop man like we're all plants like\nthat's the thing like we're a community\nof plebs\nand understand that the only difference\nbetween you and miss kif is that misc if\nat some point surrendered and he said\nyou know what I let go of success and I\nembrace failure and when you embrace\nfailure success comes biggest paradox in\nthe universe that's a paradox right and\nso what are you doing now\nmiss gift for you embracing failure I'm\ncalling myself a blood good because in\nyour mind when you stress you're\navoiding failure at all costs gotto\navoid failure can't fail can't crash\ncan't burn Hail Mary after Hail Mary\nafter Hail Mary after hail mere failure\nis not an option\nand it tears you apart on the inside\njust like it tears tore me apart tears\nthem apart it's just how it works so let\ngo be the person that you are and just\nstream like hang out man yeah and once\none day Nell sighs but failure is\nallowed absolutely that's how you learn\ntell you grow good judgment comes from\nwhat within oh sure it's the answer I'm\nlooking for is experience experience\ncomes from what\nfailure absolutely\nthe other way to put it is experience\ncomes from bad judgment yeah so you get\nto be good by being bad there's a saying\nin go so go is like a you know go is\nit's like a board game yeah yeah so they\nsay that the best way to learn how to go\nis to lose your we lose your first\nhundred games as quickly as possible\nmmm that's how you wanna lose a hundred\ngames as quickly as you can and you'll\nlearn go anyway thoughts or questions\nfor me I nothing I I wrote it all down I\nthink I'm good that I learned that to\ntry the expectations never gonna be hit\nall the time and the more I think about\nhitting the expectation the more you'll\nnever hit because your reality is your\nreality and you can't change that you\ncan't become this 24/7 you know\nentertaining person it's it's not only\nyour it's just and it's just my\nexpectations the plebs don't think that\nI think that the reality is my reality\nand that's it I have to be my reality I\ncan't force something that's not there\nit's it's not there you know and I also\nI also have to learn the plebs don't\ncare about the high expectations they\ndon't you know they a lot of them like\nyou said they come here for to hang out\nthey come here just second monitor they\ncome here to have noise and some of them\ncome here because they're upset and\ndistress it's life and you know if I\ncould be there for them then that's good\nand that's what the point of being a\nstreamer is is to be there for people\nwho need it or who are maybe feeling a\nlittle bit lonely and if I could be\nthere for them then that's good and I've\nsometimes forget about that I forget the\nreason to be a streamer it is for that\nreason is to hang out play video games\nand make Chet happy it's not to be this\nentertaining god or air constantly need\nto be doing something that's super\nentertaining and I took I've been\nlearning that a lot lately\nI've I think I've been cutting back on\nforcing stuff or trying to be\nentertaining so I the stuff that we\ntalked to today I have learned I learned\nit pretty much in like December\nI'm kind of start really figuring this\nstuff out and I also learned that I am a\npleb and that failure is allowed and I\nwill fail and I think like we the thing\nyou said about the Hail Marys is very\ntrue it's I am constantly thinking that\nI need to be always throwing Hail Marys\nwhen you know what sometimes you're\ngonna fumble and sometimes things are\nnot gonna go your way but that's okay\nthat's life and you're only human are\nyou only a pleb yeah man we're all plebs\nit's how it works beautifully play so\nbisque if I gotta also like give you\nlike props man like you're so good at\nsummarizing really yeah Bobby it's all\nright here sure but I mean I think you\ndid it last time I think you tied it\ntogether beautifully and I you know I\nthink you so props to you for closing\nthe door props for you for grabbing your\npencil props to you for like showing up\nbecause this is what the result is like\nright when you show up you kind of\naccept it in that moment when you close\nthe door you grab your pencil and you\ngrabbed your paper you accepted your\nreality and you felt a little bit shame\nbecause you had an expectation of what\nyou should be able to do see that but\nthe boring shame yeah right yeah I\nthought you said like you I feel like a\nfive-year-old\nI don't maybe I'm right\nand it's that's it another big thing is\nthat there's so like the window like\nthis the gap between expectation and\nreality is where our shame lives and\nwhat we really need to do insulate that\nshame keeps us from looking at where we\nreally are and there then it keeps us\nstuck because we start to we try to live\nwhere the expectation is instead of\nliving where the reality is and so no\nwonder we don't move forward because we\ndon't start with like where we are you\nsay to yourself oh I should be better at\nthis but like if you suck at it so be it\nit\nstuff that you suck at it and then like\nget better but the people who get hung\nup on where they should be never improve\nbecause they're not like actually moving\nfrom where they are it's like almost\nlike is it like the you know when you\nthink of like a steps they're like\ntrying to skip the first - the first\nstep to the last beautiful beautifully\nput right\nso they say like I want to move from\nstep 9 - 10 no I don't want to I don't\nwant to move from step 1 - 2 I'm better\nthan that yeah I'm at step 9\nI'm smarter than this guy and this guy's\nat step 9 a [ __ ] smarter than he is I\ndon't have to be in step 1 I shouldn't\nbe at step 1 so be where you are be\npathetic be a pleb embrace your plan\nembrace that you suck and then move move\nout of it you gotta meet yourself where\nyou are not where you should be and I\nsee you doing that and like awesome man\nlike I couldn't have said it better\nmyself I really it's beautiful I told me\ngood we good for today\nokay awesome and good luck let's stay in\ntouch you know if you know I've been\ntaking my pills - or my eye I was told\nto get the pills cuz they're best messy\nis that okay one of those the Greece\nGreek fenugreek yeah don't it hmm what\ndo you mean less messy what does that\nmean well seeds are messy I just have\nthe pill Shady's get the seeds get the\nseeds okay I'll get the seeds okay\nthey're not messy just like seeds man\nyeah I also I've figured out why I have\nthe other thing is wait how long have\nyou been taking fenugreek since we last\ntalked and how long is your sleep in bad\nuh six months eight months okay so it's\nnot just since you started the fenugreek\nokay no the fenugreek does I don't know\nif it's helped but I've realized why I\nhave such terrible shits I a peanut\nbutter cereal like five times a day and\nit's ridiculously high in fiber and you\nget like almost all your fiber in one\nsitting so I eat the cereal all the time\nlike it's all I eat so if you're eating\npeanut butter cereal that's very high in\nfiber don't take fenugreek yeah why I\nreal I'm I'm cutting back on the cereal\nbecause okay good it's way too much\nfiber like it's okay yeah okay all right\nlearned I will take the seeds that I\npromise okay no but if you're taking a\nbunch of fiber don't take the seeds\nbecause they're very high in fiber\noh is that what the seeds are there just\nfiber they're not just fiber but they\nare very high in fiber mm-hmm so if\nyou're eating a bunch of fiber just\ndon't take the seeds will figure that\nout like message me or something DME\nwill sort out what you should take but\ndon't take fenugreek seeds and don't\ntake the pills let me just think about\nit okay all right take care of men nice\ntalking to you okay chat\ngood work today thoughts questions oh\n[ __ ] I was supposed to teach him how to\nmeditate damn it\nI just got so into it I got a run to in\nabout like five minutes but we're about\n30 minutes over today\nokay no no like I have like appointments\nand stuff guys I got a I got a play\nI got a play a little bit of Warhammer\nbefore I start seeing my afternoon folks\nso got to do your gaming maybe I'll take\na walk for a little bit all right so\nthat was a lot of fun I hope does that\nmake sense like did you guys follow what\nI was saying earlier about like failure\nand surrender and things like that I\nthink um you know that's really\nimportant okay so yeah so just think\nabout that right so like remember that\nif you guys are feeling stuck like it's\nnot about a lack of motivation like I\nremember when I was you know just\nsucking at life like I wanted so much to\nchange I just did not want to live my\nlife anymore like I just didn't want to\nlive it like I wasn't really suicidal\nbut I was just like I'm tired of us I\nwant to be proud of Who I am I want to\nlike wake up in the morning and like\nfeel good about myself and like feel\nlike you know good physically feel good\nmentally like I want to have friends and\nI want to be in love and I want to be\nlike professionally successful and I\nwanted to like hold my head up with\npride like I wanted to just you know the\nthing that I hated the most is like when\nmy parents would call me and they'd ask\nme like how is your class today and I\ndidn't [ __ ] go to class that question\npissed me off so much and it's just like\nsimple things like oh like what are you\nup to nowadays like I remember I would\nlike go home right for like Christmas\nbreak\nthere's some Christmas party where like\nsocially like you hang out with people\nwho are your parents friends and stuff\nlike that people in the town they just\nask you basic questions like Oh what are\nyou what are you what are you studying\nwhat do you want to do after you\ngraduate it's like you know guys I don't\neven know if I'm gonna graduate but you\ncan't say that do your you know your\ndad's friend and the weird sweater like\nit's so like this the simplest questions\ncan be so shaming and I didn't want to\nfeel that way anymore I'm tired of\nfeeling that way and I knew I was better\nthan that so much shame so meet yourself\nwhere you are let yourself say [ __ ] it\nembrace failure give it a shot and\nyou'll be surprised\nyou"
