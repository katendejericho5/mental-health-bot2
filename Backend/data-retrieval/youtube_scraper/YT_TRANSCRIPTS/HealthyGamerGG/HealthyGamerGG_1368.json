    "transcript": "um I heard what I was listening to what\nyou're talking about\nlisten you're gonna trigger some stuff I\nwas like no no no no no I don't know I'm\ngonna trigger some stuff but I wasn't\nthat will pay attention to yeah when the\nego is triggered yeah yeah ups and downs\nbut I think yesterday I had a I entered\na place where I felt like I was like I\ncan tell that there's two modes that I'm\nin one is very small and activated and\nI'm kind of stuck in a in like this hurt\nanger shame thing and then another which\nkind of doesn't even understand that you\nknow it's like a much more confident\nplace that so I kind of have noticed\nthat when I'm noticing trying okay\ntrying what well one of the practice\nthat you basically gave me was to notice\ntrying yep because I was trying all the\ntime and I noticed I mean I would love\nto share the conclusion you know kind of\nyeah the big reason say that I thought I\ngot it can I do that yeah please\nso I feel that what I uncovered is this\nsense so I wrote it down on this little\nwhite board but so like I decided long\nago that kind of the world and other\npeople are acceptable as they are like I\ndon't really resist what what is the\nexternal world's telling me and then\nlike but because people react negatively\nto me all the time or I felt that they\ndid as a kid that I am unacceptable okay\nI feel like but I know that deep down I\nonly kind of care about the other people\naround me or whatever and I'm not gonna\nhurt them you know and I want to be nice\nand might want to be friends and so I\nfeel like what I noticed is okay I have\nthis inner sense of I just want to be\nnice but then the outer response is\nnever that we just be friends and things\nare simple it's always it in my young\npart or whatever my young mind it's like\nit always goes wrong\nso I decided that\nbasically the problem is somewhere in\nthe middle like there's something going\non that's about me where I can't get out\nthat I want to be friends and want to be\nnice and stuff so what I'm trying to do\nis I'm kind of trying to control how the\nstuff that's in gets out into like your\nbrain yeah you are trying you're trying\nto control that you're trying to control\nother people's perceptions of you that's\na hundred that's what I notice that I'm\ntrying and I also noticed that the\ntrying comes with a sense of panic yes\nabsolutely panicking at a very low level\npretty constantly okay and panic to me\nit's kind of like even if I write\nsomething on my hand in big letters I\ncan't see it because I'm like ruffling\nthrough the papers of how to fix the\nthing like the in panic there's like\nsuch little awareness it's just on one\nthing okay so let me just pause okay\nwe're good are we good on volume perfect\nokay sorry that I was adjusting volume\nso I I couldn't give you a hundred\npercent attention but can you tell me\nthat part again about so you accept\nother people for who they are but\nsomewhere along the way you decided that\nyou yourself were unacceptable that's\nright and that when you interact with\npeople you feel some degree of panic\nbecause so panic is a manifestation of\nfear and fear is related to a particular\noutcome yeah what is the outcome that\nyou're afraid of well okay that's\ninteresting so I guess the outcome that\nI'm afraid of simply is that people are\nnot gonna see the real me okay like that\nbut it's really it's kind of a bigger\nstory where it's my fault\nyou know I'm gonna mess this up again\nokay so tell me about when you started\nmessing things up so as I thought about\nit I kind of realized that my thinking\nthat I messed things up started from a\nvery young age I have lashes of you know\nI remember my uncle John it was hella\ncool with me I remember the people who\nfelt safe and I remember it was a small\nlist of people and I also remember that\ncircumstances changed and that the safe\npeople would sometimes become unsafe and\nI didn't know why so I want you to just\nunderstand for a minute little [ __ ]\nwe're gonna dig into that for a second\nokay but the first thing that I want you\nto understand is that your mind operates\nin different modes yes right so when\nyou're with safe people the some scar is\ndormant okay and and so then that\ncomplex of like I need to make sure that\nthis person likes me I need to be\ncareful with what I say this like all\nthat complex like that's why you think\nabout your uncle because you're some\nscar was dormant and then what happens\nis the some scar activates around other\npeople or some people who you thought\nwere safe do something that activates\nthe where your would be your intellect\nsays oh this actually matches the some\nscar we're actually not safe right now\nthis is that situation yes it looks like\na horse but it's actually a wolf and oh\nmy god we have to be careful it's like a\nwolf and the horses clothing right so it\nand it so let's not get the Indians in\nbad versus it's a bad analysis I was\njust kind of saying that like it looks\nlike you're saying it looks like one\nthing but then your mind says actually\nit's not what you think it is that\nperson is not safe that person is\ndangerous and we have to be back on we\nhave to go back to controlling the way\nthat they think about us\nyeah so tell me about tell me about like\nwho like what do you remember about like\nwhen you started to feel like you had to\ncontrol other people's perceptions\nthat's a really good question give me a\ngive me a second I can remember excuse\nme I can remember being like four or\nfive or whatever and being around aunts\nand uncles and having the sense that I'm\nsupposed to say something and not\nknowing what that thing is\nI also remember pretty clearly the\nfeeling of when I did talk about what\nwas interesting to me which is nerdy\n[ __ ] no one understood what I was\ntalking about and people would kind of\nlook at each other and everybody would\nbe like oh this is weird and so I guess\nI didn't draw the conclusion yet that\nthe the answer or the solution was to\ncontrol but I do remember feeling that\nfeeling that I respond to with the\ntrying at a very young age yeah so does\nwhen did I admit when do I remember\nactually trying though right sure we\ncould we can search you stay where you\nare\nso I want you to just put yourself in\nthe mind of a four or five year old who\ntries to talk to an adult and the adults\nkind of like it's clear that they sort\nof care about you but then they kind of\nyes how does that make the four-year-old\nfeel what happens in the four-year-olds\nmind you're asking about what I think\nand different for you I identify so\nstrongly with the four year old that I'm\nI find that when you ask me that\nquestion I feel yours asking me yep okay\nwhat happens in your mind what happened\nyou're right it's almost worse right\nthat this person like has to love me and\ncare about me and they can't find what\nI'm talking about interesting it's like\nholy [ __ ] I must be so weird and boring\nor whatever that\nlike the deck stacked in my favor absent\nits still screwing it up so so so now we\nsee actually that the some scar is\nenhanced because of their caring of you\nyeah right the the 100 the heart that\nyou feel your like these people they\nhave to accept me yeah but it's clear to\nme that they shouldn't want to yes yeah\nactually as you bring that up I notice\nlike an inherent discomfort with the\nfeeling that someone might accept me or\nwant to be around me because they're\ncompelled to it not that they are\nvoluntarily choosing choosing like I\nhave a Harwich like a hypersensitivity\nto yep so now we get to also something\nso I think when you try to control other\npeople's reactions towards you\nI imagine that that's quite painful for\nyou yeah and you can't help yourself\nokay could I refine I mean this would be\njust you know everyday this could be you\nknow you go and stuff I mean I would\nlove help with understanding what's\ngoing on in my mind actually\nmy sense is that I carry the sense that\nI'm unacceptable with me all the time\nand then I actually am not necessarily\ntrying to control the other person's\nreaction so much as perfectly filter out\nwhat I am putting out there to avoid the\npart that's like the unacceptable me so\nI am in a sense trying to control the\nreaction but from my own locus of\ncontrol absolutely\nabsolutely my presentation yeah so you\nknow great so so I think you're spot-on\nso that's what I mean so what I'm what\nI'm saying is that you're not letting\npeople form a genuine and authentic\njudgment of you as a person absolutely\nnot I feel I've already made that\ndecision on their behalf actually one of\nthe things I noticed with the trying as\nI was you know in the past week is that\nfor example if at work I want to get\nsomething you know I think that\nsomething's really important is the\nright thing to do I will immediately go\nto a line of reasoning that's basically\nlike I know that you shouldn't agree\nwith this idea just because I'm saying\nit I'm so untrustworthy so don't look at\nme look at the evidence in the document\nthat was produced and like the track\nrecord like look at the objective stuff\nbecause if you look at me I know that\nyou're gonna conclude that I'm bad and\nwrong\nyou should do this idea in spite of the\nfact that I'm attached to it or\nassociated with it\ndoes that make sense makes a lot of\nsense right so freezing term in net yeah\nso your conclusion is that in that - so\nyou're trying to filter the part of\nyourself which is unacceptable and in\nyour relying on documentation and logic\nfor people - because if they actually\nsaw you if they're the more they're able\nto uncouple you from your work product\neven more the better of the work will be\nand if they see who you are then they're\nnot gonna have faith in you the you know\nthe work should stand on its own two\nfeet and it shouldn't be like tainted by\nassociation with you right so at which\nslot unfortunately also I think happens\nto be true in terms of like when I think\nabout ideas for myself I shouldn't just\nbelieve what I think because I think it\nbecause that's like you know I should be\na group just so it's unfortunate that\nI've kind of that that that's true\nbecause I but anyway that was it was a\ntangent so so let's go - why do you so\nwhen you filter what does that feel like\nfor you when you filter who you are and\npresent it to the rest of the world what\ndoes that feel like for you yeah it\nfeels terrible what feels terrible it\nwas terrible that mostly what feels\nterrible about it\nhonestly when it feels really bad is the\nbigger picture feeling that I have is\nthat I'm here and I just want to be\nhelpful and I don't want to hurt anybody\nand I don't need anything in return and\nah no matter what I do that will never\ncome across that's what it feels like in\nmy mind like I don't know I feel like I\nwant it did someone my intent is to\nsorry go ahead\nno go ahead it's like the ideas that I\nlike or ones that everybody likes and so\nlike I'm coming and I'm trying to say\nlike hey I think I know how to help like\nwe could do this thing and then it's\ngonna be good for you and you and you\nand you and you and actually everyone\nwins and it's better cuz these people\nare hurting and they'll hurt less and\nlike you all are stressed out you'll be\nless stressed out like let's just do\nthis and it's like there's this idea\nthat feels super pure that's just gonna\nget it's almost like a dog it's gonna\nget kicked it's like this innocent kind\nof thing that for whatever reason I\ncan't so the I when the idea gets kicked\nyou mean that something pure is going to\nget rejected yes yes okay why do you\nthink that's happening my fault because\nthe reason it gets rejected is because\nit gets ended and it ends up getting\nassociated with you well to be honest so\nit's like I already know the end of the\nmovie you brought that up with somebody\nelse before where I'm not this is not\nnow that we're talking about is very\nclear to me that this is not logical but\nI've predetermined that that's how it's\ngonna end okay like there's a there's\nsomething that I have that I want to\nshare with the world and it's a good\npure thing and at the end of the day\nit's gonna get rejected and it's gonna\nbe my fault\nwho did that to you when you were young\nwhat did you share with people that was\nrejected\nyou\nyou\ndamn dude isn't it like everything my\nthoughts my tension is it everything I\noffers to help okay like my mean\nresidents yeah is that how you felt did\nyou feel like your presence was offense\nlike does something come to mind yeah\nyeah for sure\nresidents being effect offensive I think\nlike grade school I fell talking about\nthat\n[Music]\nyeah I have a couple I have a number of\nmemories that are that are around\nfriends that I had when I was young that\nI had falling outs with for various\nreasons and kind of a sense that it was\nmy fault or something I don't know where\nto start is I think it's kind of tangled\nin some stress so why don't you just\nstart with just start anywhere all right\nso that could just give me a memory so I\nremember being really good friends with\nthis kid who lived across the street\nbeautiful was this summer home he was\nolder than me so maybe I was five or six\nmaybe he was eight or nine and I thought\nthat he was the coolest person in the\nhistory of the world and you know we\nhung out like we did stuff so on and so\nforth he would come to my house I would\ngo to his house and then one day he\nasked me he was like hey let me see your\nlaser pen my mom had just bought me a\nlaser pen that's like 90 bucks or\nsomething like that which is a lot of\nmoney when you're that young I don't\nknow why my parents would buy at night\nanyway and so I went to grab it and I\nlike open the drawer where was and it\nwasn't there so long story short you\nknow it was like pretty clear that he\nstole it and like he was just doing that\nhe's a stupid kid like stupid kids draw\nattention to things that that they did\nand I definitely remember ooh\nso I remember that my parents kind of\ngot involved and they talked to his\nparents and it was kind of like he\nwouldn't admit it and like was not upset\nabout it and you know they they were\nlike okay this is you know you can't be\nfriends with him and I distinctly\nremember a feeling like I didn't really\ncare that he stole the laser pen I'd\nrather be I'd rather have a friend and\nso I almost felt like it was my fault\nthat they found out that they stole it\nthat he stole the thing cuz if they\ndidn't find that out then I still would\nhave my friend so you felt responsible\nfor y'all's friendship ending yeah\nI remember feeling responsible yeah I\nremember just feeling like I had this\nthing that was you know kind of\nbeautiful to me or precious to me like a\nreally like a like a really cool friend\nand it was gone and I didn't do\neverything that I could have to stop\nthat from happening mm-hmm and so it's\nalmost as if you had filtered yourself\nand not shared that with your parents\nyeah then y'all would still be friends\nyeah maybe we would yeah I mean I also\nremember later which I think is like\nbuilt on top of this one wound or what\nsure that you know he told me these\nstories about this game clock tower we\nwas like oh yeah you could do anything\nand like I found this woman and like\nkilled her and stuffed her in a basement\nor some [ __ ] and I remembered tell I\nknow it's a kind of messed up and I\ndidn't understand how messed up it was\nat the time and I remember that I shared\nthat in second grade when a teacher said\nsome [ __ ] about like our video games\nviolent or good or whatever I love video\ngames but for whatever reason I\nvolunteered this information but then I\nfound out that was a lie\nso it kind of recontextualized the\nrelationship I had with him in the first\nplace we're like not only did he steal\nthis thing and not care but also lied to\nme about some things that I thought were\nsuper cool so now I've got this judgment\nfrom my younger self or even thinking\nthat he was so cool so you blame\nyourself for thinking he's that you\nblame yourself for him thinking that he\nwas nice to you when he was mean to you\nyes so that I think there's a lot of\nthat yeah okay it's probably separate\nbut I have a lot of that like I noticed\nthat when I look back at myself I really\nfeel not good about who that person was\nin what way what do you not feel good\nabout I just feel like what do I feel\nnot good about I feel like such an idiot\nwhen I think that I'm okay and something\ngets recontextualized as I'm not okay\ndoes that make sense\nmakes perfect sense so let me put it\nlike we're not when I have the slight\nhope that I am acceptable because like\nthis whole some scars about unacceptable\nwhen I have this slight hope that I am\nand then I learned something later\nthat's like oh you were actually wrong\nthere too it's like wow I was such an\nidiot for even like hoping yeah so that\nactually does sound very related\nand just as you tie those two things\ntogether right because what I'm hearing\nfrom you is that you have learned that\nyour confidence and your perception of\nacceptability turns out to be false yeah\nbut that too so I want you to notice\nthis that is very selective would--they\nthat's selective reasoning same or good\nin the place where I'm at I don't even\nsee it exactly right so like that's so\nso if we just think about you know a can\na five year old appropriately judge the\nintentions and quality of friendship\nthat an eight-year-old offers absolutely\nnot it's [ __ ] absurd five-year-olds\nwill get owned day after day after day\nby eight-year-olds going on yeah\nliterally like you just you do not even\nhave your you're playing it's like\nyou're playing a game without a\ncontroller it's like Shrek\nit's like Shrek how little kids can\nwatch Shrek and all these jokes just go\nway over like absolutely awareness and\nso Shrek is running circles around\nlittle kids yeah and and yet so even\nwhen we stop and think about that but\nlike that's not how you see yourself\nright you you have a standard that you\nshould have known better you shouldn't\nhave let him take advantage of you\nyeah in a sense what you're doing is not\nyou're being unacceptable towards\nyourself like you are not accepting who\nyou are\nYeah right and and I think that that's\nthe Crocs so we're talking about other\npeople not accepting you and and where\nthe feeling of unacceptance comes from I\nthink wherever it comes from\nand certainly reinforced by yourself or\npropagated actually by yourself\nI think the linchpin here is that you\ndon't accept who you are it's not about\nactually showing people so it's actually\nfunny because you kind of think other\npeople can't see the real me but what it\nreally is that is that you don't think\nthat the real you is worth showing\nbecause you or you aren't okay that's\nwhy you have to filter because you're\ntainted I agree I agree with everything\non a visceral level except the phrase\nthat I don't think the real me is worth\nshowing it's like I I think maybe what\nfeels more correct is that I've already\nlooked and I know it's not good enough\nkind of thing so it's not that it's\nworth showing it's just that I know what\nI'm gonna show and it's not what it\nneeds to be actually the the thing that\nclicked for me yesterday I was talking\nto a good friend and a guru and he was\nkind of asking about when I chose to\nlook at myself that way when I chose to\nnot be acceptable to myself and that\ndoes seem like the original that seems\nlike that thing that persists like yeah\nmy own yeah god I I completely agree I\nmean I think this is propagated by you\nright so now we have to understand so\neven though Bobby this is this causes\nyou suffering this is how this whole\ncomplex is based to protect you yeah\nbecause if you believe that you are\nunacceptable then you can't then other\nif other people then you have to filter\nbecause if they see what's unacceptable\nit's gonna be a no brainer they're going\nto reject you but this really comes down\nto where so two things right so one is\nwhere that belief comes from and when\nyou started to build your life around\nthat belief\nearly so now I'm gonna ask you when you\nfeel this way at work like when you feel\nlike the rejection is inevitable it's\ngonna be kind of a weird abstract\nquestion that may not sense how old are\nyou actually my sense of internal\nstructure collapses so absolutely I\nthink I must be so young cuz I don't\neven have a sense of like my physical\nbody absolute yeah it makes perfect\nsense so I think what you are that's a\ngood practice I mean I just want to\nshare that because I think it would be\nhelpful for others like if you notice\nthat sometimes you feel like you have\nstructure and sometimes if you track\nthat sometimes you feel like you have\nliterally no structure like that's I\nthink really meaningful cuz that's the\nthing that really clicked for me is it I\nhave a sense of my structure right now\ntalking to you yeah but when I think\nabout being at work I actually don't\neven yeah so I don't have a body so when\na some scar activates it returns your\nmind to the age at which it was formed\nmm-hmm so uh and so I think what's\nhappening is like a four or five year\nold doesn't really have a sense of\ninternal structure right they don't so I\nthink what's happening is like you're\nrevoking these thoughts or feelings that\ncome from there they don't actually come\nfrom the here and now they come from the\npast yeah and so I'll just give you\nanother example so I was I was working\nwith someone and they had a lot of\nsocial anxiety and we were talking\nthrough like what that meant for that\nlike what that felt like for them and\nand then you know like I kept on asking\nquestions and like he was just unable to\ngive me any kind of sophisticated\nanswers like I was asking like what's\nthe feeling and he's like I don't really\nknow like what's the you know so then we\nwere talking about so he wanted to get\nit he wanted to get a job but he felt\nembarrassed to go into like a place and\nask for an application for a job and as\nwe talked to like how irrational that is\nlike it didn't really make a dent and so\nthen like eventually like we got to like\nI pushed him and I pushed him and I\npushed him in his responses I just don't\nwanna\nyeah and that's it right it's not\ncomplicated it's not like Freudian there\nisn't this deep subconscious conflict\nit's just somewhere along the way when\nhe interacts with people when his mind\nformed this idea I just don't want him\nit's like not even a fully formed like\ngrammatically correct sentence the core\nof it is I just don't wanna and that's\nactually enough that can be the end of\nthe road yeah and the interesting thing\nis he's doing way better now because\nlike now he realizes that like in him\nthere's a part of his mind that is just\nnot gonna want to do something and you\ncan't make sense of it it's not some\ndeep subconscious conflict there's no\noedipal want to sleep with your mom and\nknock out your dad or like any of these\ndeep complicated stories it's just\nwithin him there's a seven-year-old who\njust didn't want to go to school because\nhe was bullied and he didn't want to put\nhimself in front of people and he just\ndoesn't wanna that's it it's the end of\nit yeah there's nothing to unpack\nthere's nothing to explore that's it and\nhe carries that seed of I just don't\nwanna with him all the time and there\nare times where that seed emerges like\nmost of the time like he's able to do\nthings with his friends and stuff like\nthat I mean he actually does want to do\nthings he does want to get a job he\nwants to get a job at particular places\nhe thinks the people who weren't there\ncool he'd like to work there he thinks\nit would be fun to work there and when\nhe thinks about walking up to them and\nasking them for a job application via I\njust don't when he gets a case of the I\njust don't want us and that's the some\nscar that activates and the real\nchallenge here is that people think so\nlike Bobby you think this is you right\nyou operate under the assumption that\nthis is who you are like your conclusion\nso you don't treat this as like an\nexternal thing you treat this as you\nyeah so so he just feels like he's a\nlazy [ __ ] because he's got a part of\nhim that just doesn't wanna and he\nidentifies with that he doesn't\nunderstand that that is just a some scar\nthat activates from time to time and if\nyou actually look at your life that you\nare valued by many people\nthat he's appreciated and loved and\npeople think he's cool and funny and\nalso physically and sexually attractive\nand and like all kinds of stuff that he\njust like to do that I just don't want\nis is not able to hold that and so in\nyour case I mean you say that you have\nall this kind of conflict and that\nyou're unacceptable and that you've\ngotten really really good at filtering\nyourself which is probably how you\nrationalize your success but it sounds\nlike you have a kid and you're married\nand you have friends and you have\nmeaningful relationships and also you've\nyou've held a job for years and so\nyou're not so abrasive or toxic that\nthey fired you which they do and so like\nlet's just think about that for a second\nare you so good at filtering that you\nhave fooled all of these people so the\nway that I rationalize it is actually\nwith a sense of duty and responsibility\nto the other people who feel the way\nthat I feel I think somewhere along the\nline I got the sense that I wasn't alone\nin feeling I was unacceptable I think\nthat this is important because I think\nthat I actually grew like this separate\npart with that belief in other words I\ndon't necessarily rational at in other\nwords if you ask me why I think I'm\nsuccessful I would say that like I get\nit I get the struggle I build products\nfor the people who had the struggle that\nI have hmm not everybody has the\nstruggle that I have and I I don't think\nthat I'm better than them at all I just\nthink that if you haven't gone to this\ndeep dark place awful all that stuff and\nyou haven't really looked around you\ndon't get how sensitive it is as a\nfour-year-old as a five-year-old as a\nseven-year-old and so when I'm building\nproducts I'm holding the four or five\nsix seven year olds and all of us like\nin that design a beautiful feel that\nlike do you know that was that's I with\nyou so that's your daughter mine that's\nyour karma so this is how karma and\nkarma relate there's AI so related yeah\nit's crazy so explain that to us\nso I've had experiences in my life that\nhave been painful they haven't killed me\nand for a long time I thought I was\nalone in that and that really hurt and\nso I know how much hurt there is in that\nfeeling and because I know how much hurt\nthere is I know how important it is to\ntend to that and how hungry people are\nfor that kind of tending and that kind\nof attention oh I know that you know\nthrough that negative experience I have\nsomething that you know later on I don't\nknow how it happened inside me but I\ndecided that we're not alone and I can\ndo something about it\nand if I never had the experiences if I\nnever had if I didn't have the Karma if\nI wasn't led to the place where I where\nI was where I made that decision that\nthat's the thing that I'm gonna fix then\nyou know I could never have the the duty\nand responsibility to do it so perfect\nright so your karma even your hurt and\nyour suffering yeah set you up to do\nyour duty or responsibility you made you\nthe person that you are and without\nthose experiences you would not be able\nto have hurt and suffering at the\nforefront of creating products for like\ncreating stuff at which yeah exactly\nright which is kind of bizarre because\nwhen you think about product developers\nat twitch I don't think that that's the\nkind of thing that they would be\nthinking about but I think if you know\nyou've been at twitch for six years into\nwhich is done very well over the last\nsix years I think part of the reason is\nbecause you're keeping something really\nlike like deeply spiritual for lack of a\nbetter term I mean I just call it\nspiritual but maybe psychological\nwhatever at the forefront of the work\nthat you do and it doesn't surprise me\nthat you're successful there so at the\nsame time I feel right is it part of the\nexact same narrative where it's like hey\nthis is the thing that I'm doing and it\nworks and you will never you write to\nothers the people who will find me\nunacceptable you'll never believe me and\nnever let me do the work that I feel I\nhave to do that's where the conflict\ncomes in and where I yeah so you start\nto control and have that shakes of hurts\nwere\ngood so let's talk about that so the\nfirst thing is that I think that these\nthings are not actually like related I\nthink the Dharma and karma is sort of a\ngenuine sense of who you are and I think\nthe unacceptability like the Dharma is\nwhat lets you tolerate and get away with\nyour feelings of unacceptability but I\ndon't believe for a second that having\nthe Dharma that you have makes people\nlike you and then if you've been\nsuccessful at twitch for six years and\nyou've managed to get married and you\nhave friends and stuff like that that\nhuman beings are pretty good at like\njudging other human beings and that\nthere's something that they see in you\nthat they actually do wholeheartedly\naccept otherwise because here's the\nthing you're abrasive right yeah it\ndepends it depends on if I feels it up\nso let's let's just say yes let's just\nsay yes and so just think about this for\na second if for someone who's as\nabrasive as you are they sure as hell\nhave to accept something deep within you\nto have to like work with you on a\nday-to-day basis yeah\nright yeah I am very different yeah in\ncontext but uh-huh but I think\nultimately like I have to agree I mean I\nthink you're what what is my sense I\nhave this sense that the you know I'm\nnot acceptable the people who accept me\nanyway those are the safe people the\npeople who don't those are the unsafe\npeople that's kind of how I've\nrationalized it there's some people who\ncan eat who can accept someone even like\nme yeah so I think that that makes sense\nI don't think that that's really a\nrationalization I think that's actually\njust an accurate observation that for\nwith some people they you know you you\nhave the perception that you show them\nthe real Bobby and they accept you and\ntherefore they're safe and that there's\na larger camp of people who can't you\ncan't let them see the real Bobby\nbecause they won't accept you in and\nthen you're like abrasive and combative\nand you don't understand why they don't\nunderstand what you're trying to tell\nthem and stuff like that and it sounds\nlike actually in some ways you're hard\nto work with yeah that's probably true\nyeah and the bizarre thing is that sure\nthat that's true I'm sure yeah that's\ntrue and the bizarre thing is is that\nonly what to do about it\nyeah we'll get to that yeah so but the\nbizarre thing is that if we really look\nat your situation if you have an\nabrasive person who people continue to\nwork with rather than them being\nunacceptable their acceptability has to\nbe way higher because your abrasiveness\nis making it like harder to deal with\nyou sure yeah so in a really weird way I\nthink like the safe people are way\nlarger that that group is way larger\nthan you realize yeah so I think you're\nright about that yeah yeah so now the\nquestion is like where do we go from\nhere okay so the first is I want you to\nrecognize that you know as we start to\nthink those kinds of thoughts that runs\ncontrary to the perception and\nconstruction that you've made\nright we just say your perception is\nthat you're unacceptable on the inside\nand through a lot of lot of surface\nlevel filtering you can create an\nappearance of acceptability but what I'm\nactually hearing is quite the opposite\nis that on the outside you can sometimes\nbe difficult and abrasive so you're not\ncreating anything like the filter you're\nactually creating like a negative filter\nnot a positive filter and despite\ndespite the negative filter that you're\nputting out in terms of your\nabrasiveness and your you know internal\nsense of your unacceptability people are\nable to see through that [ __ ] and\nstill value working with you in some\ncapacity yeah my real sense actually so\nI have the sense that I'm acceptable\ndeep deep down but no one will ever ever\nknow it like whatever however I talk\nhowever I interface with the rest of the\nworld I in other words like there's some\ngold deep down but there's so much [ __ ]\nbetween the gold which is me or whatever\nthat no one will ever see the good\nalright that's the struggle that I live\nwith every day okay no deep down there's\nvalue and then I want to help and then\nif I if only I didn't if only I wasn't\nsuch a problem that stuff could get out\ninto the world so makes perfect sense\nokay so what I'm hearing is so I'm gonna\nask you a question when so tell me about\nif you remember anything about when\nsomeone didn't dig through the [ __ ] and\nfind the gold when they looked inside\nyou you opened the doors and they just\nsaw a sea of [ __ ] and they like ran away\nI remember feeling misunderstood as a\nkid where so okay I have a really strong\nmemory I don't know if I brought it up\nwhere it was a Sunday and I was playing\nwith my cousin's did I bring that memory\nup mmm-hmm\nI was having so much fun it was the kind\nof childish joyas fun where you know the\nwhole rest of the world is gone and\nyou're just where you are and then on\nMonday it turned out that I had homework\nthat I was supposed to do and I just you\nknow I had you know my pant I was called\nmy pants down and this is maybe the\nthird time that I forgot to do homework\nor something like that and I remember\nreally getting the riot act or whatever\nthat really being like hey you you've\ngot a problem here and this cannot\nhappen anymore\nand so it's kind of recontextualizing\nthat joy is fun with right like whoo\nbaby the riot couldn't my parents and I\nthink the teacher was like not not\nparticularly happy okay I remember one\ntime very clearly I was in fourth grade\nI remember it so well that something\nhappened the teacher said something and\nlike I was actually listening to them\nbut I think I was doing it in an\nabrasive way where it was kind of a\nknow-it-all way and I actually got\npunished just for clarifying like what\nthe teacher had said because I knew that\nsomebody else didn't understand what\nthey said and I just felt like what the\nf you know I'm actually trying to help\nyou do your job and I'm getting punished\nlike that makes him no sense hmm so it's\nalmost thought I was supposed to do and\nI'm getting punished for what I'm\nsupposed to do yeah so what I'm hearing\nis that you offered your gold and they\nperceived it as [ __ ] yeah yeah I feel\nlike when I would think back to my\nchildhood there was a lot of mixed\nmessages like there's a lot of times\nwhen I would be in trouble for no reason\nlike maybe my dad would be having a bad\nday and he was just stressed and I did I\ncouldn't understand that he was just\nventing can you tell me about your dad\nyeah my dad I think that if people knew\nmy dad it would make so much sense out\nof me he he's so okay he's like\nbasically always the coolest guy in the\nroom\nhe's a shorter Italian guy that he's\nfive seven or something like that you\nknow it's like a he doesn't look like\nJoe Pesci at all you know he's skinnier\nand stuff he's more about tough for sure\nbut you know I'm he tells a story where\nhe went to a party one time and a woman\nsaid to him like who are you like I\nyou're somebody right and he was like I\ncould have been somebody kind of thing\nand he definitely like yeah he runs the\nshow it was very clear for like the\nwhole extended family he's like the\npatron by their own and he is very\nvocally critical about kind of like\nanybody being lazy or not pulling their\nweight or whatever\nand so he kind of uses humor but he's\nusing humor to kind of keep everybody in\ncheck and that makes sense\nhe's like policing and what do you think\nthat what you say you said earlier that\nif people like knew my dad they they'd\nunderstand you better how does that help\nus understand you I've said it I said\nI've said it for a long time but I don't\nnecessarily know that I thought about\nwhy I think it sure why do I think it\nyeah what does that tell you about what\ndoes that tell us about you well I've\ngot his blood in me and also I grew up\nas you know under his kind of power and\nauthority and if you see the way that he\nacts you'll you'll sense a tremendous\namount of stress and anxiety as well as\nlike a loud kind of personality\nwhat what what does in what way does he\nact that makes you feel stress and\nanxiety I he feels a lot of stress and\nanxiety like I think that all of his\nexternal stuff is just dealing with his\ninternal state you know the the fact\nthat like his body system is telling him\nlike like flooding him all the time with\nlike threat signals or whatever okay I\nfeel definitely consistently overwhelmed\nby like my body telling me that like\nthere's something really wrong\nhmmm I think he does too what is your\nbody telling you is wrong now sure the\nworld's the world's in a bad spot we got\nto do something okay\nthere's people suffering I think it's\n60% of people are lonely in America so\nit's like two out of three or something\nlike that I don't know some crazy number\nand you feel that in your body I can\nyeah what does that feel like a\ntightness in my chest like a kind of\nburning focus it's a sense of like fire\nand it's like the laser beam right it's\na strong focused energy in a direction\nand it comes with kind of like an\nimpatience mm-hm and a an anger around\nwhy isn't anybody looking at this I kind\nof feel that a lot yeah my dad told me\nhis dad was actually a union organizer\nso not a union leader or whatever but he\nwas the guy who's in the factory saying\nlike what are we doing\nyeah these guys are making all the money\nand we're getting screwed like what are\nwe doing and he was so nuts about it\nthat he actually [ __ ] writes founded\na union yeah it's like that kind of feel\nI feel like I've got that in me you know\nabsolutely you do that's bit that I\nlearned that very late in life\nby the way what is it that's bit tough\nyeah yeah I feel like I've got all five\ntried no [ __ ] that's how I feel but yeah\nwell you're primarily about that pizza\nso I'm sure I mean everyone has some\ndegree of dough shows but if you have a\nfair amount of color in your face for\nexample and then you know we also see\nthat you know you're you're irritable\nabrasive driven focused all bit negative\nattributes and yeah so Bobby I think um\nyeah you're right you know when you talk\nabout your dad I certainly think that\nthat's significant but I'm still a\nlittle bit curious about\nhow he contributed to you becoming the\nperson that you are\nhe thought I was he was stressed all the\ntime that I was not gonna make it I\nremember him walking around just being\nlike this kids not gonna make he's just\nnot gonna make it I'm not gonna this\nkids not gonna make it I remember he\nwould say it is not a one-time thing he\nwould say that a lot just like throwing\nhis hands up ahead this kids not gonna\nmake it I can't protect it what is what\ndoes that do to you what is it was that\ndo to a kid something yeah especially\nwhen I felt deep deep deep down that\nthat was not correct right it's this\nfeeling of there's something down here\nthat he can't see and nothing I [ __ ]\ndo will ever change that\nright yeah how could it be that there\nactually is something good here and he\ncan't see it like he's my you know I\nmean how could it be like there must be\nsomething so wrong in the rest of me\nthat that's what it feels like right\nyeah so what have we been talking about\nfor the past 30 or 40 minutes we've been\ntalking about this absolutely yeah\nthe time about the sense that like\nthere's something so so a lot of things\nare clicking right so you said that\nthere are a couple things one is that he\ncan't see it and all he sees is you\n[ __ ] up and forgetting your homework\nand he also lets you know whatever it is\nlike random stuff yeah so so in that\nthat's actually a significant detail\nbecause it's not so if it's just one\nthing then you end up with some scar\nthat you're bad at homework you're like\noh man I suck at school or I'm not good\nat setting no but in the clouds right\nthat kind of thing like but it's so it's\nit's it's multi-dimensional for him\nwhich also means that you're not\nunacceptable in one way you're\nunacceptable in every way\nyes generalized yet yes and then there's\nalso something subtle which you kind of\nmention some time ago which we haven't\nexplored but there's something that\nbothers you about people who clearly\nyou're not acceptable but they have to\nlove you anyway mm-hmm and that sounds\nlike I mean it sound you know take that\nstatement out of context from half an\nhour ago and plug it in here it fits\nperfectly because we're talking about of\nall people your dad mm-hmm yeah and it's\nkind of like I guess I had the sense\nthat other people we're kind of faking\nit mm-hmm yeah of course so that I think\nis also completely rational for a young\nkid because you trust your parents and\nyou you sort of set your compass like\nyou set the gold standard based on how\nyour parents treat you and if the rest\nof the world is congruent with that\nthat's fantastic and if it's not you\ndon't accept the rest of the world and I\nsee this a lot actually in cases of\nabuse where like when a child is taught\nthat they're a piece of [ __ ] and then\nlike like when they're adults and like\npeople treat them with love and care and\nrespect how do you think they respond no\nwell why not really you kind of can't\nbelieve it right yeah absolutely come up\nwith a story that makes it not the\nsimple truth absent just be that's\nperfect\nit's [ __ ] confusing and bewildering\nto them they do not understand it that's\nall it's so confusing yeah and so then\nwhat they do is is they they start doing\nall kinds of weird acting out behaviors\nto align the relationship with what they\nbelieve about themselves Yeah right so\nthey start doing things that drive their\npartners like I'm just thinking about\nromantic situations where like someone\nis genuinely like loved and cared for by\nanother person and that's so confusing\nfor them so they start doing things that\nshift the relationship towards something\nthat they like or familiar with which\nactually is to try to incite their\npartner to like get angry with them or\nsometimes even like try to get them to\nbe physically abusive I've worked with\nsomeone who literally would like just\nattack their partner because they wanted\ntheir partner to like beat the [ __ ] out\nof them\nand the partner just wouldn't do it and\nit was just really really confusing and\nit took some time to untangle but it's\nwild like what people will do like they\nwant to play the game that they know how\nto play yeah\nand so the funny thing is that if we\nwant to get really sort of you know\nloose associations what do you do at\nwork yeah\n[Music]\nyou\nokay how do I have an original idea\nabout this right now because as you\nasked that question I know I've said\nthings along these lines about my\nbehavior and reflection in the past in\nother words I'm kind of don't mean you\ndon't give me the answer that I don't\ngive me the answer that I want don't\ngive me the right answer answer give me\nyour answer the one that pops into my\nhead when I look at my own behavior is\nlike I'm trying so hard to get the gold\nout and I kind of go up to bed and but I\ndo it in this way that's self-defeating\nyou know absolutely do it in a way where\nand I'm not but the thing is that I feel\nvery blind to what is happening in the\nmiddle you know as do they but if you're\n[ __ ] abrasive at work you're driving\nthem towards unaccepting yeah\nyeah you're trying to make them feel\nabout you the way that you feel about\nyourself because then the world makes\nsense and then on the flip side you're\ntrying to do the exact opposite because\nyou're paranoid and you're fighting and\nyou're conflicted and that's why I like\nit sounds like you're in a state of\nsemi-conscious constant torture yeah\nyeah sounds awful with yeah that's not\nyeah it's not fun it's definitely not\nfun so I mean I you know I don't know I\nmean I think personally it's a little\nbit of a stretch to think that you're\nreally sort of subconsciously kind of\ndriving people towards being unaccepting\nthat's the kind of you know\npsychoanalysis level [ __ ] that I\nnormally call [ __ ] on so I think\nwhat I do right is like I'll go into an\ninteraction I don't think I start as\nabrasive necessarily but maybe I do\nhonestly when I feel more like it's a\npowerful person or a person with power I\nam worse that's for sure so let me ask\nyou something if someone starts to\naccept your ideas is generally accepting\nyour ideas how do you feel\nI think a little bit desperate see this\nis weird right so this makes perfect\nsense this is consistent with our\nhypothesis because what's actually\nhappening is you are getting accepted\nthey're actually accepting your ideas\nand then you get confused and then you\nget desperate why don't they get\ndesperate it's like it's like it's\nthere's a thing here that I've that I'm\nwant so badly and like I can't let it\nget away kind of thing and so what do\nyou do in your interactions with them\nlike dump absolutely dump what does that\nmean\nso there's basically it's like a damn\nthere's like a damn of all these things\nthat I've wanted to share with people\nfor years and years and years and so you\nknow it's like I feel like no one is\never gonna listen sort of thing because\nof because I suck and so if I sense that\nsomeone is listening it's like that dam\njust blows open and all of there's so\nmuch that I want to say and it's very\nvery overwhelming and disorganized and\nthen how do they respond like they're\noverwhelmed and have no idea and then\nwhat does that do to the size of your\ndam well I think once the good comes out\nand it runs them over like if they\nhaven't received it properly then the\nangry starts to come out actually sure\nand then I think the next day what you\ndo is you build your dam higher yeah for\nthe next person yeah first absolutely\nright so now we're seeing like like this\nis all kind of tied together because\nlike what happens is when you get a\nlittle bit of acceptance yeah you flood\nthem with it and so then what happens is\nlike you get back to this kind of idea\nthat like you're reinforcing this idea\nthat you're like they're not gonna\naccept what you have then you have to\nbuild the walls higher yeah and actually\nto be honest it's like it's it starts\nfrom the prenup in other words even when\nI interact with people it's like I start\nfrom the premise that they're not gonna\naccept me and maybe if they accept\nthings it'll be because of my resume and\nbecause of the quality because so I\nfocused the whole conversation on these\nthings that I'm not even sure they when\nI'm talking with you I'm not sure if\nanybody cares about okay so it's kind of\nlike I'm preparing a case for why they\nshould say I'm preparing a case yeah I\nunderstand I killed somebody you know it\nso you'd but then on the other hand look\nat all these good things and me I'm on\nthe balance you can get over you know\nthis dam because of all this stuff over\nhere so Bobby might\nI'm gonna try to offer so first of all\nlet's just take a step back because I'd\nlike to offer you something kind of\nconcrete which I hope will let you move\nforward in a like a at least one serious\nstep because I'm getting the sense that\nwe're sort of teasing a lot of stuff\napart but I'm going I'm getting a\ngrowing sense within me of like what do\nwe do about all of us yeah so first of\nall help me understand what we've\ncovered today and and what you think\nlike where are we\nlike like recap for me what you\nunderstood from our discussion today\ngive me one sec so I had not said\nexplicitly the part about my dad kind of\nmy experiences of my dad giving me the\nsense that there may be something good\nhere but it's like no one will ever see\nit and it's like there's so much in the\nway that's bad I had never explicitly\nsaid that and I think it that's super\ncore\naside from that I think that I'm aware\nof most of what we discussed and I think\nwhat we're talking about is kind of a\ndouble bind where how do I put this and\nI feel like that's where the sense of\nwhat do we do about it comes from even\nin Me's I've worked very very very\ndesperately on you know this this\nproblem in that I at the same time\nbelieve that I'm good and that I'm\ncomplete I believe that I'm like good\nand complete at the same time yep and\nthat that causes me to act in super\nconfusing ways yep to myself and to\nother people\nabsolutely is that maybe the simplest\nway to put it\nbeautiful way to put it right so your\nconfusion this is a problem of confusion\nthis is a problem of someone who is\ntaught that love involves physical abuse\nand then just gets [ __ ] and confused\nbecause there's a part of them that also\nrealizes that they deserve\nhonest and authentic love that involves\nno abuse and there's a part of them that\nalso has learned go when I look for\nacceptance from my dad I think that what\nthe case that I want to provide is I'm\nalmost saying hey Dad I heard everything\nthat you told me and I've started from\nthe premise that I'm not gonna make it\nand so I thought about this which is bad\nand here's the answer I've right I've\nmitigated this problem with myself I've\nmitigated this one with myself and I\nmitigated this one and that's why you\nshould trust me\nin other words I know that I'm bad and\nI've done all this work to like be\nacceptable for this one moment\nwhat do you what do you think about that\nso that sounds like that's a very common\npattern in your life right have you done\nthat was like when you bring up the\nabuse which is not my experience but\nit's like I want someone to hit me so\nthat then right we can kind of get\ncloser I know that the hits gonna happen\nlet's just get it over with and then we\ncan find our way to a place where like\nwe can be okay with the fact that I got\nhit yeah yeah so what I'm hearing is\nlet's just let's just here's what I'm\nhearing from you in terms of like your\nthe premise that you're unacceptable and\ndamage control you're saying okay why\ndon't you guys just tell me I'm\nincompetent to begin with so that I can\nget to all of the reasons why you guys\nshould still value what I'm doing 100\nlet's just get the fact that I'm in\ncompetence completely out of the way\nlet's start scale even if I'm\nincompetent\nI still think you guys should buy this\nblender for $19.99 plus shipping and\nhandling if you buy one right now you're\ngonna get a second one for free\nthat's exactly right right that's\nexactly right yeah I'm the shittiest\nuser of a blender I cut all my fingers\noff you I could blender like you should\ntrust me because I'm an idiot\nyeah no one understands incompetent\nblender customers more than me yeah so\nhow do we how do we get get out of this\nokay so a couple of thoughts okay so the\nfirst is you have to let go of the\npremise that you're unacceptable and I\nrealize that's easy to say and hard to\ndo but the the tricky thing here is that\nwhen you're letting go so why is it hard\nto let go the premise you're\nunacceptable because\nit opens you up to uncertainty and\npotential failure so in a weird way\nyou've got a game plan that involves\nBobby being unacceptable\nyeah and so the problem I think which\nwhat's really difficult is that you sort\nof built a party around you know let's\nsay like you're playing like an RPG and\nyou like build a party that's like all\nmages and then like you built this party\nand then you've come up with the\nstrategy to like still win with all\nmages even though all mages is like\ngenerally speaking a terrible party but\nalso my favorite kind of party to play\nand so I come up with these like super\nconvoluted strategies of like you know\nspamming consumables and buying scrolls\nand stuff early on in the game until my\nmages actually come online and then I\n[ __ ] start tearing things apart\nbecause you can just see see and like\nAoE the [ __ ] out of anything that comes\nyour way and this is why you're\nsuccessful because you came up with this\nsort of like premise that's messed up\nbut then you also have a lot of faith\nand when your strategy comes online yeah\nand that's the bullet points right\nbecause you're like let's call me\nacceptable and let's move to the bullet\npoints because the bullet points like\nthat's when my page may just come online\nand like it doesn't matter\nthat it doesn't matter that we can't use\nswords or armor or we have no healers\nyou guys think that this is busted\nbecause you think that you need a tank\nand you think you need a healer but I\ncan show you without all this stuff with\nmy all mage strategy you can still do it\nyeah so the really tricky thing here is\nthat if you abandon your premise you\nalso abandon your solution and you\nabandon your possibility for success\nyou're re-entering and zone of\nuncertainty that could lead to failure\nonce again so I think that's part of the\nreason you you attach yourself to this\npremise because at the end of the day\nthis strategy Bobby has worked for you\nyeah so once I want to ask does it make\na difference where like you said I can\nshow you that this works and it's true I\ncan show you but not if you don't look\nand I've got this other thing about like\nyou'll never let me show you kind of\nthing sure I think that change your\nanalysis at all in terms of how I should\nthink about it not really because I\nthink it's just it's just that's just\npart of the\nyou know it's part of the complex it's\npart of the mechanism so you have a some\nscar but then you also have these other\nlike coping mechanisms that you've\ncreated in your mind to account for that\nand and and I think that like to unravel\nthe really tricky thing so you know when\nI I'm just trying to think about this so\none of my supervisors once told me that\ngrowing up is the process of abandoning\nwhat works yeah and that kind of struck\nme and I was kind of confused about that\nand then you know is the more that I\nthought about it sort of like well I\nmean when you when you when you're two\nand you throw a temper tantrum like you\ncan kind of get away with that but as\nyou get older there are things that you\nused to do that you have to give up and\nlike later in life so for example when I\ntalk about medical students so medical\nstudents are very very grades oriented\nand that's worked very well for them\nbecause they were the top of their class\nin high school\ntop of their class in college honors\nstudents did excellent like you don't\nhave 3.9 GPA s and did really well on\nstandardized tests and they come to med\nschool and they hit the hospital and\nthen suddenly it's not about tests\nanymore and so they've always tried to\nbe the best and so they ask you over and\nover again how am i doing and we say\nyou're doing fine you're doing great\ngood job good job kid good job and then\nwhen when grades come around what grade\ndo you think they get I mean I've had\nthis experience mmm not a good one so\nthey get an average grade which is in\ntheir mind not a good one and then they\nget really [ __ ] confused because\nthey're like you said I did a great job\nevery day and you I just got an average\ngrade and then we say well yeah that's\nbecause your average because we're\ncomparing you with other med students\nwho are also showing up every day and\nworking really hard and you're now\naverage and it kind of just blows their\nmind so some kids get honors okay and so\nthen the the the the I mean the trihard\nbet they're all try hards they get\nreally confused and they're like you\nsaid I did a great job yeah I asked you\nwhat I need to do they don't say it like\nthis because they're too terrified of\nyou like I've spent my whole life with\nthe professor telling me you need to\nstudy the\nthis this and this and you will get an a\non a test and I came here and I asked\nyou what do you want me to do you laid\nout my responsibilities I fulfilled\nevery one of those responsibilities why\ndon't I get an A and so what we have to\ndo is teach them to abandon what works\nand so what I try to explain to the med\nstudents is that like it doesn't matter\nlike whether like I'm not the standard\nthat you should be judging yourself by\nright you're nodding so it looks like\nyou understood something what are you\nbut what are you thinking so I think I'm\nthe person who asked that question\ndirectly and if I don't get the answer\nthat you're giving me I get very angry\nyep in other words I feel it's\nacceptable to give this person an\naverage grade when you've you know but\nthen the next thing you need to say is\nokay the way to get a better grade than\naverage is to abandon what's worked by\ngetting difficult and that's little\ngrowth you know that's real leadership\nand I've respect that that's a good\nanswer so if I get some dumbass answer\nlike well blah blah blah I get very\nupset yeah so a lot of times the med\nstudents get upset thankfully I've had\nsome years to practice this and so what\nI what I tell them is like you should be\nnot thinking about what I want is your\nsupervising physician you should be\nthinking about your patients needs\nyeah for sure and the the the kids who\nget honors are the ones that actually\ndon't and it's not that they don't care\nabout what I want they do everything but\ntheir focus is not on the grade their\nfocus is on the patient yeah that's my\nstrength is that my focus is generally\non the people who need and that I serve\nthem yep but then when it comes to my\nrelationship with the professor like\nit's contentious its contentious so\nuntil they make it easy for the\nprofessor I'd okay that I need to sit\nand think about that so so the the point\nhere is that like Bobby I think you've\ngot a winning strategy and just like all\nof the med students who have a winning\nstrategy that gets them to that point\nwhat I try to impress upon the med\nstudents is you're no longer studying\nfor a grade like I don't think you guys\nget this one day you're gonna be it's i\nfunny I told this this story yesterday\none day you're gonna be on an airplane\nand someone is gonna ring a button like\na call bell and they're not sorry you're\ngonna hear an announcement where the air\nhosts or the air hostess is going to say\nis there a doctor on the plane\nand then you're gonna be terrified it's\nhappened to me it's the most terrifying\nexperience in the world scariest thing\nthat's ever happened to me and then you\nwait and you cross your fingers because\nyou hope that there's someone else hmm\nright you hope that someone else does it\nno one does and they say it again and\nthen you're like well [ __ ] I gotta do\nthis because this is what I trained for\nme yeah and you hit the call bell and\nthen they go over and you know they call\nyou over and then you go and then like\nlike there's a pregnant lady who's like\nhas bad stomach cramps and then the\npilot asks you this question which is\nshould we land the plane immediately\nthat's what you need to be studying for\nand that's what you should think about\nevery day when you come to the hospital\nunderstand it's not about pleasing me\nit's not about knowing the names of your\nmedications it's that like one day\nsomeone is gonna need your help and are\nyou prepared for that moment because\nit's [ __ ] terrifying yeah is she\nhaving indigestion or is she having a\nplacental rupture where not only is she\nlosing the baby but she's gonna die\nwithin 60 minutes from internal bleeding\nor did she eat too much dairy and in\nthat moment you can't say I mean what my\npersonal fear is I can't say I'm a\n[ __ ] psychiatrist I don't know real\nmedicine Yeah right that's what I'm\nscared of and so that somewhere along\nthe way the med students get that it's\nno longer about the grade and you're\nactually becoming a doctor and that\npeople's lives are gonna depend on you\neven if you're a psychiatrist who spends\nhis time talking to people on twitch if\nI'm on the subway or if I'm on an\nairplane like I can't say I'm sorry I\nspend most of my time on Twitch I can't\nhelp you unacceptable so they have to\nabandon what works and what you have to\ndo is abandon what works and it's gonna\nbe terrifying you have to let go my keys\nso you have to let go of your lists you\nhave to let go of your lists and you\nhave to let go of your unacceptability\nyeah so I said ability then the list\ngoes to beautiful\nright but but there's a lot of comfort\nin that whole package for you because\nthat's what's worked so you have to let\nyourself potentially fail and what I\nmean by potentially fails you have to\ngive other people their agency back\nwhich you take away from them yep right\nyou have to let them yeah right so you\nhave to let them be okay with your idea\nnot being okay that I don't think you\ncan do so that's something you need to\nwork on right so in in the so this is\nI'm gonna go back to kind of the abusive\nperson so the most terrifying thing for\nthat person is actually like accepting\nthe possibility that this person\ngenuinely loves them is if this person\ntreats them abusively and then five\nyears ago from now they leave the person\nin the abusive relationship is actually\nokay with that because they always knew\nit was gonna happen this is a game I\nplayed before I can deal with\nabandonment I know how to do it and as\nlong as you hold onto the possibility as\nlong as you hold onto that idea that I'm\nnot worth loving it's easy to deal with\nabandonment what's terrifying is\nactually like accepting someone's love\nand believing that you're not worth\nabandoning not like carrying those you\nknow putting those walls up and then the\npossibility of abandonment people do not\nwant to do that they say I can't take it\nif I presume that I'm gonna fail at the\nbeginning I can take a failure but if I\nlet myself hope and believe that I can\nbe loved and that I can be successful\nand then I fail I can't do it it's gonna\ndestroy me I'm not that strong so\nsomething very protective about all of\nthis stuff for you yeah right it's the\nsame reason why half of our audience\ndoesn't give it their all when they\nstudy for a test yeah because if you\nstudy for a test and you studied as hard\nas you could and you get a B you're\n[ __ ] dumb but if you're lazy you get\nto hold on to being smart because I\ndidn't give it my all yeah giving it\nyour all is the most terrifying thing in\nthe world because then if you fall up\nshort you're short and there's no excuse\nyeah so I think you've got to give it\nyour all and I think you've got to let\nlet go of control a couple of other\nthings to remember one is that I want\nyou to recognize that this some scar\nexists within you right so it's not\ncorrect it's not wrong it's just a piece\nyeah\nit's like if you're developing a\nstrategy for smash like you know you can\nthere are different characters that have\ndifferent strategies it's not like one\nis the dominant truth it's just they're\ndifferent ways to play the game so in\nyour case you have a four or\nfive-year-old that sometimes thinks this\nall this unacceptability stuff like that\nand it's gonna dictate it's gonna want\nto dictate your actions yeah as best as\nyou can as you see that just notice that\nit wants to dictate your actions but\nthat it doesn't you don't have to let\nthat dictate your actions just see it\nwithin you it doesn't mean it's wrong\nright so like you're in a double bind\nbecause you've got one horse that's\npulling you this way in one horse that's\npulling you this way put the horses\ntogether there's still individual horses\nthey're not different but you can move\nin one direction even though one of them\nis like like you know you can have that\nfour-year-old within you and acknowledge\nthat that person is there and still move\nforward and still speak and still\nrecognize that I don't have to convince\npeople I'm gonna actually just I'm gonna\nchoose to let go of the unacceptability\nand also the absolute cheat code god\nmode of my logic I'm gonna let go of\nthem both I'm gonna share my ideas and\nthen I'm gonna let people like cuz I\nknow that like there's a part of me that\ndoesn't want to just share my idea you\nguys you guys have to listen to all of\nit don't just listen to part of it don't\njudge me halfway or you like I like\nactually and I love watching your stream\ncuz you approach this so differently you\nstart with your idea and you if I were\nyou my stream would have been two months\nof me saying like okay I've thought\nabout this I could have been wrong in\nthis it's like could in other words I\nnever would have shared my ideas cuz I\nwould have just shared this extensive\ncase about like why you should listen to\nme even though you probably do you know\nwhat I mean no like when you'd wait if\nimagine if you started your stream you\nwere like hey I\nno you guys don't spirituality let me\nlike you know and you kind of defended\nthis angle you didn't you're just\ntotally obsessed with why people\nshouldn't believe you and you're just\nattacking these beliefs that you believe\ncould be out there and then after all\nthat then you share your ideas yeah so I\nmean I like such a [ __ ] way to talk\nabsolutely\nso like the reason that I people don't I\ndon't because it doesn't work right so\nlike like this doesn't work I just tell\nyou so Bobbi like let me tell you right\nwhat I think I do you with you right\nyeah yeah so I I think which is so like\nI don't I don't I don't know that I'm\ngonna help you I don't know that what\nyou're gonna say is going to be\nacceptable to you I just I have no idea\nright so what I have is a sense of faith\nin Who I am but I don't have the the\nwinning strategy and not to draw too\nmuch of a comparison between the two of\nus but I think that's the only thing\nthat work because I've tried it your way\nand doesn't [ __ ] work it doesn't is\nthat you be the person that you are and\nyou let your compass of trying to help\nthese gamers on Twitch and 60 percent of\npeople are lonely and you go to those\npeople you go to your colleagues at\ntwitch and you say hey I have this idea\nI'd love to share it with you guys and\nyou don't try to convince them you let\nthem you you know it's it's the cake\nthat's in the display case you're not\nthe person who's giving out samples\nyou're just gonna make your cake you're\ngonna stick it in the display case and\nyou're gonna let them choose and if they\nwant it they're gonna have it you're not\nthe person who's like hey would you like\nto try a hey hey try this oh put a\nlittle schmear this on this\nwhy don't you dip it in here like you\nknow like just take a step back in and\ngive what you have to give and let the\nworld receive it and recognize that\nthere's the four year old the five year\nold who's gonna be terrified about that\nthere's all the whole gold nugget and\n[ __ ] like what you need to do is give\nthem a [ __ ] cake with a gold nugget on\ntop just give them it give it all to\nthem don't try to just give them the\ngold and don't try to hold back the [ __ ]\njust give it all to them because they\nsee it all anyway I know it's terrifying\nI think that there's like you're just\nnot you're not that manipulative to\nwhere you can really hide that much\nBobby you're not very manipulative so\nyou're like no uncertainty you're low on\nthe sociopathy scale like you're a kind\nof strategy of filtering information and\nstuff like that works you just have to\nbe way more sociopathic for that to be a\nsuccessful strategy for you the last\nthing that I'll leave you with is we got\nto talk about your mom okay so another\nthing and I don't know that we have to\ndo this today but one of my supervisors\nonce told me it's the parent that they\ndon't so one parents the smoking gun and\nthere's another parent that they don't\ntalk about and the money is that the\nparent that they don't talk about\nthere's plenty with yeah there's plenty\nthere okay flip though I will tell you\nin Flint if I was a teen I would only\ntalk about my mom sure not talk about my\ndad right so that there's a lot about\nacceptability and and who you became to\nbe and I'm sorry that you know it sounds\nlike there were many experiences where\nyou really did just try to be yourself\nand the world punished you for it yeah\nand and I think you just need to\nrecognize that like that happened to you\nand just because the world has punished\nyou in the past I mean there are\noverwhelming numbers of people who have\naccepted you for who you are\nand yet this some scar has not been\nprocessed because like it's not some\nscars can't fight against each other\nlike that like you you were beloved in\nthe smash community you know it's clear\nthat you know my twitch at likes you I\nlike you you're married yeah your wife\nlikes you presumably you have a\nthree-year-old he's kind of a fan a lot\nyeah and things I'm cool yeah do you\nfeel unacceptable with him dude\nsometimes yeah so notice that right and\nunderstand that's that is past week\nwe're sure I've noticed it more because\nthat was the practice you gave me yeah I\ndo notice it more so but that's not\ncoming from him it's coming from you a\nhundred percent\nright so that you think that I the thing\nthat was said to me yesterday that I\nthink really helped was that it's like I\nat a certain point when I was very young\nI chose to have me be than me that my\ndad saw or that somebody else saw and\nlike I had to remember who that me was\nthat made that decision\ncuz that me is the\nthat's you know does that kind of make\nsense it makes it so I'll put it to you\nanother way so I think what so some\nscars and the things that you cope\naround them are learned behaviors yeah\nso like I think about anxiety I mean not\nall like sometimes it's you know true\nbiological anxiety that wasn't learned\nbut for a lot of people especially the\nkind of anxiety that I see a lot now\nit's like a learned anxiety it's just\nyour brain literally trying to cope or\nadapt to a certain set of circumstances\nand I don't know I mean I think you made\na choice I don't know if I would call it\na choice but I definitely think that you\nI mean yeah you can call it a choice I\nthink it was sort of a subconscious\nchoice maybe it's a good way to put it\nbut I think you learned to accept your\ndad's premise about who you are in the\nsame way that the abuse of the person\nwho gets into an abusive relationship\nwho has abusive parents learn to accept\ntheir opinions like their parents\nopinions of who they are mm-hmm and so I\ncompletely read and that's why we got to\ngo back to like where this started right\nand I think sure maybe it was the\nfour-year-old I think these some scar\nhas been kind of added on to those are\nall pieces that are strengthening it\nyeah but there's just this general idea\nthat like you know you're not acceptable\nnumber one and secondly that there's\nsomething about people that are that you\nlove and respect being forced to\nassociate with you despite your smell\nyeah good way to put it and and just\nnotice those things and I'd say like you\nknow Bobby I think I think you've got\nunfortunately a long road ahead of you\nbut I think you know I have faith that\nyou're gonna do do well not because you\nhave a winning strategy but because I\nthink you're gonna continue to try I'm\ndefinitely gonna continue to try yeah\nthoughts or questions do you have any uh\nI would like to meditate again and have\na practice I did some chanting but I\nonly kind of do it at home like when can\nme I think that feels really good\nlike letting it out as opposed to\nforcing it is a big difference yep\n[Music]\nyeah give me a second I also feel like\nyeah go ahead god no just gonna say I\nalso you know when I've kind of done\nsort of parts of myself like kind of\nthought about what's going on in my\nexperience I think I actually have like\na pretty strong third eye experience\nwhen I am understanding something but at\nthe practice of pointing my finger I\nnever connected the dots between those\ntwo places I guess and I wonder if\nthere's something there that I could let\nme just think for a second\num okay let me just think for a second\nI'm gonna just take a quick ad break\nbecause I've been told to do that one\nand then I just need to think\nand then we'll teach meditation when I\nget and I need to blow my nose and stuff\nso I'm gonna just run to the restroom\nlet's talk about meditation when I get\nback\nyou\nad is still there okay let me think no\nads chat should we do something new or\nsomething old should we do the same one\nagain\nyou\nyou\nso how do we teach you a meditation\nabout acceptability let me think\ndo you want something that's a little\nbit more focused or more contemplative\nso that's a slice contemplative is my\nstrict go-to strategy so maybe that's\nnot like I'm good at it but on the other\nhand I use it to deal with my as a\ncoping strategy not as a yeah so I mean\nI'm not I think sometimes when it comes\nto meditation the goal is for you to\nhave a practice that's easy\nkind of easy for you to do so we can try\nto do something contemplative I'm trying\nto figure to be honest I think that so I\nthink that if I could so there's a place\nwhen I was learning how to how to wave -\nit's like an advanced tech and Super\nSmash Brothers mmm where if you're\ntrying to learn something in a video\ngame you kind of just go into it being\nlike okay I'm gonna I'm gonna beat this\nlevel I'm gonna I'm gonna learn how to\ndo this and it doesn't matter if it\ntakes a week or a month or a year you're\njust kind of gonna kind of do it and you\nkind of explore something that you're\njust gonna keep trying and it's it's\nokay to mess up and I really love that\npart of video games and I'm wondering\nlike\nthere's a way to kind of like just\nrecommit to being me and not worry about\nthe consequences of being me that was\nthe thing that you said last time that\nreally stuck with me I think I live in\nthe consequences of being me and so I'm\ntrying to refocus like where my mind is\n- not five seconds after whatever I'm\nthinking about saying but just where I\ndoes that make sense yeah okay that's\nhelpful\nso I think that we're gonna do something\nthat maybe is a little bit different but\nlet me just think about how to structure\nus how can I\nhow do you feel about breath oriented\nmeditations my breathing sucks so I feel\nreally good about it what is that I\nbreathe very shallowly I find it very\ndifficult to breathe deeply\nI find that uh I kind of feel like I\nlike I don't know if it's gas or\nwhatever but something will build up\nwhen I'm trying to breathe deeply that\ndoes they kind of prevent gets in the\nway then I kind of feel like I have to\nburp or something hmm which doesn't also\ndoesn't work I don't know if that's\nsuper weird but okay first thing that I\nwant you to sit up straight and close\nyour eyes we get a pillow sure hips hips\nabove knees yep very good okay\nso I'm gonna teach you a technique\naround the double bond okay mm-hmm so I\nwant you to notice you but do you have a\ntennis ball by chance or something\nthat's tennis ball shape can you go grab\nit so if you guys have a tennis ball go\ngrab one if you don't have a tennis ball\nwe're gonna try to use your fist okay so\nBobby I want you to close your eyes and\nbreathe in and out through your nose and\ntell me first if you can discern whether\none ball one nostril is more open than\nthe other\nI think my right okay so go ahead and\nblock your lap nostril and breathe in\nthrough your right it does it to any\nfinger it doesn't matter yes so just\nblock one off so it'll be then and then\nafter one breath switch and then check\nthe other nostril full breath\nyeah just confirm whether your left gang\nor right gang maybe left I don't know\nkind of in the middle I think that's\nmore clear okay so then what I want you\nto do is to take the tennis ball and\nstick it under your left armpit kind of\nup into the armpit like push it up yeah\nyou kind of feel it pressing into your\nlike up in there okay kind of make it\nalmost a little bit uncomfortable like\npressure yeah it's a little one guy feel\na little bit of like in the back okay so\nlike almost like imagine if you were\nlike leaning with your armpit over a\nrailing okay good so close your eyes now\nobserve your breath and with each breath\nnotice which nostril is more open and\nthen try to catch the transition so you\ncan put your fist into your armpit if\nyou want\nthe other thing that you can do is lay\ndown on the if you guys are watching at\nhome if that's it's which do you catch\nit I think it did so if it's switched to\nthen move the tennis ball other arm pet\ncan't confirm it yeah switch the tennis\nball now catch it this time\nso the other thing that you all can do\ncuz the fists can be a little bit\nawkward is that you can lay down on the\nside of your open nostril so if your\nleft nostril is open lay down on your\nleft and if your right nostril is open\nlay down on your right it switched again\nare you catching it I think I think it\nwas between two breaths like it was the\nexhale so I want you to focus it the it\nkind of that the back or top of your\nnose because that's where you may feel\nthe switch and you're gonna get one\nbreath in there with both nostrils open\nmaybe a couple\nyou\nyou\nI figured switching really fast\nyou\nit's it's a it starts on this yeah it's\nswitching super [ __ ] fast okay so now\nwe have your problem right so I think\nthis is so you got it so you can stop\nfor a second Bobby so what I'm gonna do\nlet's try to do it slightly differently\nwhich one's open now left okay so I want\nyou to your couch in the back I want you\nto lay down on your left side okay and\njust kind of just just lay down on your\nleft nope just lay down on your left\nside yeah it's it's very strange that\nhis is switching correctly so I think\nthis is the right technique for him I\nwon't be able to hear you\nokay so lay down on your on whichever\nside is open and then watch it switch\nand then come back when it after it\nswitches alright and try to catch\nyourself in the middle of the switch\nyou\nyou\nyou\nyeah it's very strange it normally does\nnot switch that fast yeah\ncan relax [ __ ] how do I tell him to put\na pillow under his head because he looks\n[ __ ] awkward Jesus that looks\nuncomfortable like so stiff\npoor Bobby he tries so hard\nyou\nyou\nokay I think I caught a dude okay so it\nwas quick okay good so first of all you\nknow you can lay down in a more relaxed\nfashion you don't have to like keep your\nheader like you could have like gotten\non a pillow just comfortably\nokay okay so first of all it's very\nunusual that you're you're you're not\nease are switching so rapidly like\nusually it takes like at least like six\n30 60 seconds so but this also is cool\nbecause I think this is the right\ntechnique for you so Bobby you we've\nbeen talking about the double bind what\nyou need to learn how to do is to live\nin between two things to live in the\ntension as opposed to being pulled onto\ntwo sides so there's a tension within\nyou and I think it's clear to me that\nlike you need to live in the space of\nthat transition so there's going to be\none breath in there where either\ninhalation or exhalation things are\ngonna be even in balance before you\nswitch over so just spend time in the\nmiddle of those two things and what you\ncan you can also do is like you don't I\nmean this is weird I've never had\nsomeone who switches so quickly so I\ndon't know that you need to worry about\nthis by the way go ahead I think that I\nlearned very young not to trust myself\nso my left and right hemispheric brains\ndon't trust each other so there's just a\nbunch of like ah I don't know if that\nmakes any sense but I just like as I\nthink through things I noticed that I\nswitched from like what is the meaning\nand how does this make sense\nholistically to well none of the facts\nsupport this and it's like they're kind\nof disagreeing and they're fighting all\nthe time right so you need to find your\ncorpus callosum which is the thing that\nconnects your two hemispheres right so\nyou need to find you need to live in the\nin-between spaces that's so so it's so\ncheering there it shouldn't be a\nbattleground right so I what I want you\nto understand so like imagine that I\nhave to you know if I take like two\nboards and I lean them against each\nother those two boards are opposing each\nother and you could argue that that's a\nbattleground right because one of them\nwants to fall this way the other one\nwants to fall this way but\nI set them up there's actually like\nthere's no conflict that is just the\ntendency of one board and the tendency\nof the other board are creating conflict\nand opposition but in between them\nthere's actually peace and balance and\nyou need to start learning how to live\nin that space and I think this is a\ntechnique that's gonna help you with\nthat just like you said your if your two\nhemispheres don't trust each other\nfantastic so start to learn la live in\nthe in-between spaces do you have any\nidea what that feels like could you kind\nof maybe say a word or two about what it\nmight feel like to live in the tension\nyes I can but I'm not going to okay\nso part of this is tricky because I'm\ntrying to teach you sort of a middle\ntechnique without the beginning and\nwithout the end so this is sort of the\npreparatory technique the main thing\nthough is that the other thing you can\ndo is you don't necessarily have to use\nthe tennis ball if you're switching very\nrapidly you can just observe your breath\nand catch the the switch naturally okay\nso I don't think that you should have it\nping ping pong hang back and forth so\nrapidly so if you want to you know have\nit breathe for a couple minutes and then\nyou want to force switch you can breathe\nfor a couple minutes and then you want\nto force a switch but see if you can\ncatch the natural transition and and\nwhen that transition happens just fully\nimplant yourself in that space with one\nbreath that is both right nostril and\nleft nostril and then you tell me how it\nfeels to live in the in-between okay\nthoughts questions feels good thanks so\nmuch for everything that you're doing\nman\nyeah man it's been a pleasure thanks for\ncoming on a couple times and also you\nknow rescheduling so rapidly for sure\nany thoughts on who we should raid I'm I\nwas thinking I would stream so I mean if\nyou want to yeah we can just raid you\nthat's right Bobby are you streaming or\nMike I'm about to you I wasn't cuz the\ncamera won't let me it wouldn't let me\nyou know you couldn't see me go to Bobby\nwas dreaming okay which underscore scarf\nalright thanks a lot Bobby will raid you\ntake care yeah you too oh wow\nthank you mass stars for the how many is\nthat\nholy 100 gift bomb thank you very much\nfor the you know gigantic pile of subs\nokay so for a couple of things to make\nthings so you know sometimes I struggle\non stream because I'm not sure like what\nto teach because some stuff is very\napplicable to the person and I think\nless applicable to twitch at dodged what\nI'm confused why does people say dodged\noh they dodge the subs thanks for the\nhundred gifted subs really mash stars we\nreally appreciate it so that'll go to\nyou no it'll go to fun something or\nother so I'm sorry if that you know that\nmeditation practice was like odd for you\nguys cuz it's very strange that Bobby's\nlike switching so rapidly but if you\nguys are if you're struggling in some\nway and you feel like you're in a double\nbind that practice could be good for you\ntoo so this practice is part of\nsomething called sawara sadhana so era\nmeans breath or sound and yoga is sort\nof a particular set of practices that\nare sort of a designed to get you to\nenlightenment purely through the breath\nand it's different from be passionate\nbecause sort of sadhana isn't really\nabout doing things with your breath\nwhich is more Brown I am\nit's about observing nuances of the\nbreath so I'll give you guys kind of a\nanother practice so if you close your\neyes and you pay attention to your\nbreath you'll feel the flow of air\nthrough your nostrils right and now I\nwant you to figure out which of your\nnostrils is dominant so one of your\nnostrils is gonna be more open than the\nother\nleft Ganga right gang okay so now what I\nwant you guys to do if y'all ready for\nthe next level this is gonna be hard\nleft gang right gang so if you guys have\nsome practice with this now I want you\nto notice the direction of the breath\nokay within your nose so what I mean by\nthat is okay so if you think about your\nnose like this right so here's your\nright nostril here's your left nostril\ndr. K okay so you can feel let's use\nlike a brush or something yeah so you\ncan feel the breath around here or you\ncan feel it here or you can feel it here\nthere's going to be a dominant place\nwhere your breath is coming out of your\nnostril it's going to be equal both\nsides very rarely does this make sense\nto anyone there's going to be one area\nlike it could be here or here what are\nyou're gonna feel the breath more there\nare five distinct zones\nso what you guys want to do is as you\nbreathe just notice which zone you're in\nright so this is tricky because like so\nsorta silent is hard it's like a more\nsubtle practice and it's like really not\nfor everyone which is fine doesn't mean\nyou're bad at meditation the whole point\nof teaching different meditation\ntechniques is cuz like some people know\nwhat charging the laser beam feels like\nand other people are like I have no idea\nwhat that is\nand other people you do left gang right\ngang and they're like yeah that makes\nperfect sense how do you guys not\nunderstand this so what you guys want to\ndo is just pay attention to the\ndifferent zones of your nose and just\nfocus on that and try to feel what they\nare so what I'll ask you guys is that\nI'll tell you that there are a certain\nnumber of zones in each nostril so you\nguys tell me what are the zones of each\nnostril so I'll say let's let's say five\nokay so five directions that your breath\ncan go within each nostril and and try\nto just see try to find all five in each\nnostril and that's your meditation\npractice right so it's not so important\nwhat it is right now but as you so what\nI want you guys to do is is understand\nso try to catch all five of them the\nzones are what you you need to figure\nthat out I'm not gonna tell you what\nthey are and if you guys don't know what\nwhat I'm talking about that's actually\ncompletely fine\nright so for those of you who think your\nfive had like digital donger that's just\nfor directions buddy where's the fifth\nand do this practice do it throughout\nthe day because you're not gonna like\ndoesn't make sense like if one zone is\nactive that's the zone that's gonna be\nactive right now you can continue\nwatching the breath but it's gonna be\nthe same part that's gonna be active and\nso practice it for a while so listen\nguys I just want to thank you guys again\nfor all of the support and for all the\nsubs and things like that you know our"
